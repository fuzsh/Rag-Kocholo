        "meta_description": "Abstract. Traditional tropospheric ozone (O3) climatology uses a simple average substantially smoothed stratification structure in individual O3 profiles, limiting our ability to properly describe and understand how O3 is vertically distributed at the interface between the mixing layer (ML) and free troposphere (FT). In this study, we collected 1897 ozonesonde profiles from two Chinese megacities (Beijing and Hong Kong) over the period 2000â2022 to investigate the climatological vertical heterogeneity of the lower-tropospheric O3 distribution with a mixing-layer-height-referenced (h-referenced) vertical coordinate system. The mixing-layer height (h) was first estimated following an integral method that integrates the information of temperature, humidity, and cloud. After that, a so-called h-referenced vertical distribution of O3 was determined by averaging all individual profiles expressed as a function of z/h rather than z (where z is altitude). We found that the vertical stratification of O3 is distributed heterogeneously in the lower troposphere, with stronger vertical gradients at the surface layer and MLâFT interface. There are low vertical autocorrelations of O3 between the ML and FT but high autocorrelations within each of the two atmospheric compartments. These results suggest that the MLâFT interface acts as a geophysical âbarrierâ separating air masses of distinct O3 loadings. This barrier effect varies with season and city, with an MLâFT detrainment barrier in summer (autumn) and an FTâML entrainment barrier in other seasons in Beijing (Hong Kong). Based on a Student's t test, daily h-referenced O3 profiles were further classified into three typical patterns: MLO3-dominated, FTO3-dominated, and uniform distribution. Although the FTO3-dominated pattern occurs most frequently during the whole study period (69â% and 54â% of days in Beijing and Hong Kong, respectively), the MLO3-dominated pattern prevails in the photochemically active season, accounting for 47â% of summer days in Beijing and 54â% of autumn days in Hong Kong. These occurrences of the MLO3-dominated pattern are significantly more frequent than in previously reported results at northern mid-latitudes, indicating intensive photochemical MLO3 production under the high-emission background of a Chinese megacity. From a FTO3-dominated to MLO3-dominated pattern, the O3 precursor CH2O (NO2) experiences a substantial increase (decrease) in Beijing but a slight change in Hong Kong. Vertically, the increment of CH2O is larger in the upper ML, and the decrement of NO2 is larger in the lower ML. Such vertical changes in O3 precursors push O3 production sensitivity away from the VOC-limited regime and facilitate high-efficiency production of O3 via photochemical reactions, particularly in the upper ML of Beijing.",

We developed a novel computer vision framework using deep neural networks and clustering algorithms for cloud classification and segmentation from ground-based all-sky images. After a full year of observational training, our model achieves over 95 % accuracy on four cloud types. The framework enhances quantitative analysis to support climate research by providing reliable cloud data.\n\nEnhanced daytime secondary aerosol formation driven by gas-particle partitioning in downwind urban plumes\n\nMingfu Cai, Chenshuo Ye, Bin Yuan, Shan Huang, E Zheng, Suxia Yang, Zelong Wang, Yi Lin, Tiange Li, Weiwei Hu, Wei Chen, Qicong Song, Wei Li, Yuwen Peng, Baolin Liang, Qibin Sun, Jun Zhao, Duohong Chen, Jiaren Sun, Zhiyong Yang, and Min Shao\n\nEGUsphere, https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-887,https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-887, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThis study investigated the daytime secondary organic aerosol (SOA) formation in urban plumes. We observed a significant daytime SOA formation through gas-particle partitioning when the site was affected by urban plumes. Box model simulation indicated that urban pollutants (nitrogen oxide and volatile organic compounds) could enhance the oxidizing capacity, while the elevated volatile organic compounds were mainly responsible for promoting daytime SOA formation.\n\nMeasurement Report: Seasonal variation and anthropogenic influence on cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) activity in the South China Sea: Insights from shipborne observations during summer and winter of 2021\n\nHengjia Ou, Mingfu Cai, Yongyun Zhang, Xue Ni, Baoling Liang, Qibin Sun, Shixin Mai, Cuizhi Sun, Shengzhen Zhou, Haichao Wang, Jiaren Sun, and Jun Zhao\n\nEGUsphere, https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-956,https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-956, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nTwo shipborne observations in the South China Sea (SCS) during the summer and winter of 2021 were conducted. Our study found that aerosol hygroscopicity is higher in SCS in summer than in winter, with significant influences from various terrestrial air masses. Aerosol size distribution had a stronger effect on activation ratio (AR) than aerosol hygroscopicity in summer and vice versa in winter. Our study provides valuable information to enhance our understanding of CCN activities in the SCS.\n\nAn improved Trajectory-mapped Ozonesonde dataset for the Stratosphere and Troposphere (TOST): update, validation and applications\n\nZhou Zang, Jane Liu, David Tarasick, Omid Moeini, Jianchun Bian, Jinqiang Zhang, Anne M.

In this study, we improved, updated, and validated the TOST from 1970 to 2021. Based on this TOST dataset, we characterized global ozone variations spatially in both the troposphere and stratosphere and temporally by season and decade. We also showed a stagnant stratospheric ozone variation since the late 1990s.\n\nMeasurement report: Nocturnal subsidence behind the cold front enhances surface particulate matter in plains regions: observations from the mobile multi-lidar system\n\nYiming Wang, Haolin Wang, Yujie Qin, Xinqi Xu, Guowen He, Nanxi Liu, Shengjie Miao, Xiao Lu, Haichao Wang, and Shaojia Fan\n\nAtmos.

Combined with the surface PM2.5 data, the ERA5 reanalysis data, and GEOS-Chem simulations during Dec 2018–Feb 2019, we found that transport nocturnal PM2.5 enhancement by subsidence (T-NPES) events widely occurred with high frequencies in plains regions in eastern China but happened less often in basin regions like Xi’an and Chengdu. We propose a conceptual model of the T-NPES events.\n\nMeasurement report: Atmospheric nitrate radical chemistry in the South China Sea influenced by the urban outflow of the Pearl River Delta\n\nJie Wang, Haichao Wang, Yee Jun Tham, Lili Ming, Zelong Zheng, Guizhen Fang, Cuizhi Sun, Zhenhao Ling, Jun Zhao, and Shaojia Fan\n\nAtmos.

We measured N2O5 and related species on a typical island and found intensive nighttime chemistry and rapid NO3 loss. NO contributed significantly to NO3 loss despite its sub-ppbv level, suggesting nocturnal NO3 reactions would be largely enhanced once free from NO emissions in the open ocean. This highlights the strong influences of urban outflow on downward marine areas in terms of nighttime chemistry.\n\nCharacterizing the near-global cloud vertical structures over land using high-resolution radiosonde measurements\n\nHui Xu, Jianping Guo, Bing Tong, Jinqiang Zhang, Tianmeng Chen, Xiaoran Guo, Jian Zhang, and Wenqing Chen\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 23, 15011–15038, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-23-15011-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-23-15011-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe radiative effect of cloud remains one of the largest uncertain factors in climate change, largely due to the lack of cloud vertical structure (CVS) observations. The study presents the first near-global CVS climatology using high-vertical-resolution soundings. Single-layer cloud mainly occurs over arid regions. As the number of cloud layers increases, clouds tend to have lower bases and thinner layer thicknesses. The occurrence frequency of cloud exhibits a pronounced seasonal diurnal cycle.\n\nImpact of upper-level circulation on upper troposphere and lower stratosphere ozone distribution over Northeast Asia\n\nZhiheng Liao, Jinqiang Zhang, Yubin Pan, Xingcan Jia, Pengkun Ma, Qianqian Wang, Zhigang Cheng, Lindong Dai, and Jiannong Quan\n\nEGUsphere, https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2023-1393,https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2023-1393, 2023\n\nPreprint withdrawn\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThis study presents the first systematic assessment of observationally constrained UTLS O3 variability over the Northeast Asia region in the framework of upper-level circulation pattern classification. The results indicate that lower-stratospheric O3 exhibits a far stronger sensitivity to upper-level circulation patterns when compared with upper-tropospheric O3. The progression of the East Asian Trough plays a critical role in determining the location and intensity of O3 enhancements.\n\nNighttime ozone in the lower boundary layer: insights from 3-year tower-based measurements in South China and regional air quality modeling\n\nGuowen He, Cheng He, Haofan Wang, Xiao Lu, Chenglei Pei, Xiaonuan Qiu, Chenxi Liu, Yiming Wang, Nanxi Liu, Jinpu Zhang, Lei Lei, Yiming Liu, Haichao Wang, Tao Deng, Qi Fan, and Shaojia Fan\n\nAtmos.

We identify a strong ability of the residual layer to store daytime ozone in the convective mixing layer, investigate the chemical and meteorological factors controlling nighttime ozone in the residual layer, and quantify the contribution of nighttime ozone in the residual layer to both the nighttime and the following day’s surface ozone air quality.\n\nRadiation fog properties in two consecutive events under polluted and clean conditions in the Yangtze River Delta, China: a simulation study\n\nNaifu Shao, Chunsong Lu, Xingcan Jia, Yuan Wang, Yubin Li, Yan Yin, Bin Zhu, Tianliang Zhao, Duanyang Liu, Shengjie Niu, Shuxian Fan, Shuqi Yan, and Jingjing Lv\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 23, 9873–9890, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-23-9873-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-23-9873-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nFog is an important meteorological phenomenon that affects visibility. Aerosols and the planetary boundary layer (PBL) play critical roles in the fog life cycle. In this study, aerosol-induced changes in fog properties become more remarkable in the second fog (Fog2) than in the first fog (Fog1). The reason is that aerosol–cloud interaction (ACI) delays Fog1 dissipation, leading to the PBL meteorological conditions being more conducive to Fog2 formation and to stronger ACI in Fog2.\n\nVariation and trend of nitrate radical reactivity towards volatile organic compounds in Beijing, China\n\nHejun Hu, Haichao Wang, Keding Lu, Jie Wang, Zelong Zheng, Xuezhen Xu, Tianyu Zhai, Xiaorui Chen, Xiao Lu, Wenxing Fu, Xin Li, Limin Zeng, Min Hu, Yuanhang Zhang, and Shaojia Fan\n\nAtmos.

This work investigated the level, seasonal variation, and trend of nitrate radical reactivity towards volatile organic compounds (kNO3) in Beijing. We show the key role of isoprene and styrene in regulating seasonal variation in kNO3 and rebuild a long-term record of kNO3 based on the reported VOC measurements.\n\nACEIC: a comprehensive anthropogenic chlorine emission inventory for China\n\nSiting Li, Yiming Liu, Yuqi Zhu, Yinbao Jin, Yingying Hong, Ao Shen, Yifei Xu, Haofan Wang, Haichao Wang, Xiao Lu, Shaojia Fan, and Qi Fan\n\nEGUsphere, https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2023-1448,https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2023-1448, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThis study establishes an inventory of anthropogenic chlorine emissions in China in 2018 with expanded categories (HCl, Cl-, Cl2, HOCl) and sources (41 specific sources) with detailed spatial and temporal assignments, and emission factors based on localized survey data. This study enhances the understanding of anthropogenic chlorine emissions in the atmosphere, identifies key sources, and provides scientific support for pollution control and climate change.\n\nUnbalanced emission reductions of different species and sectors in China during COVID-19 lockdown derived by multi-species surface observation assimilation\n\nLei Kong, Xiao Tang, Jiang Zhu, Zifa Wang, Yele Sun, Pingqing Fu, Meng Gao, Huangjian Wu, Miaomiao Lu, Qian Wu, Shuyuan Huang, Wenxuan Sui, Jie Li, Xiaole Pan, Lin Wu, Hajime Akimoto, and Gregory R. Carmichael\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 23, 6217–6240, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-23-6217-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-23-6217-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nA multi-air-pollutant inversion system has been developed in this study to estimate emission changes in China during COVID-19 lockdown. The results demonstrate that the lockdown is largely a nationwide road traffic control measure with NOx emissions decreasing by ~40 %. Emissions of other species only decreased by ~10 % due to smaller effects of lockdown on other sectors. Assessment results further indicate that the lockdown only had limited effects on the control of PM2.5 and O3 in China.\n\nTyphoon-associated air quality over the GuangdongâHong KongâMacao Greater Bay Area, China: machine-learning-based prediction and assessment\n\nYilin Chen, Yuanjian Yang, and Meng Gao\n\nAtmos. Meas. Tech., 16, 1279–1294, https://doi.org/10.5194/amt-16-1279-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/amt-16-1279-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe Guangdong–Hong Kong–Macao Greater Bay Area suffers from summertime air pollution events related to typhoons. The present study leverages machine learning to predict typhoon-associated air quality over the area. The model evaluation shows that the model performs excellently. Moreover, the change in meteorological drivers of air quality on typhoon days and non-typhoon days suggests that air pollution control strategies should have different focuses on typhoon days and non-typhoon days.\n\nAggravated air pollution and health burden due to traffic congestion in urban China\n\nPeng Wang, Ruhan Zhang, Shida Sun, Meng Gao, Bo Zheng, Dan Zhang, Yanli Zhang, Gregory R. Carmichael, and Hongliang Zhang\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 23, 2983–2996, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-23-2983-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-23-2983-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nIn China, the number of vehicles has jumped significantly in the last decade. This caused severe traffic congestion and aggravated air pollution. In this study, we developed a new temporal allocation approach to quantify the impacts of traffic congestion. We found that traffic congestion worsens air quality and the health burden across China, especially in the urban clusters. More effective and comprehensive vehicle emission control policies should be implemented to improve air quality in China.\n\nThe unexpected high frequency of nocturnal surface ozone enhancement events over China: characteristics and mechanisms\n\nCheng He, Xiao Lu, Haolin Wang, Haichao Wang, Yan Li, Guowen He, Yuanping He, Yurun Wang, Youlang Zhang, Yiming Liu, Qi Fan, and Shaojia Fan\n\nAtmos. Chem.

Phys., 22, 13753–13782, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-22-13753-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-22-13753-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe report significant global tropospheric ozone increases in 1995–2017 based on extensive aircraft and ozonesonde observations. Using GEOS-Chem (Goddard Earth Observing System chemistry model) multi-decadal global simulations, we find that changes in global anthropogenic emissions, in particular the rapid increases in aircraft emissions, contribute significantly to the increases in tropospheric ozone and resulting radiative impact.\n\nCirculation-regulated impacts of aerosol pollution on urban heat island in Beijing\n\nFan Wang, Gregory R. Carmichael, Jing Wang, Bin Chen, Bo Huang, Yuguo Li, Yuanjian Yang, and Meng Gao\n\nAtmos. Chem.

We find diverse influences of aerosol pollution on urban heat island intensity (UHII) under different circulations. Our results also highlight the role of black carbon in aggravating UHI, especially during nighttime. It could thus be targeted for cooperative management of heat islands and aerosol pollution.\n\nA deep learning approach to increase the value of satellite data for PM2.5 monitoring in China\n\nBo Li, Cheng Liu, Qihou Hu, Mingzhai Sun, Chengxin Zhang, Shulin Zhang, Yizhi Zhu, Ting Liu, Yike Guo, Gregory R. Carmichael, and Meng Gao\n\nEGUsphere, https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2022-578,https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2022-578, 2022\n\nPreprint archived\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nAmbient particles have an important impact on human health, meteorology and climate change. By building a deep spatiotemporal neural network model we have overcome the long-standing limitations and get the full time and space coverage ground PM2.5 concentrations. We open the neural network black box data model by using sensitivity analysis and visualization techniques. This research will help improve health effects studies, climate effects of aerosols, and air quality prediction.\n\nMeasurement report: Distinct size dependence and diurnal variation in organic aerosol hygroscopicity, volatility, and cloud condensation nuclei activity at a rural site in the Pearl River Delta (PRD) region, China\n\nMingfu Cai, Shan Huang, Baoling Liang, Qibin Sun, Li Liu, Bin Yuan, Min Shao, Weiwei Hu, Wei Chen, Qicong Song, Wei Li, Yuwen Peng, Zelong Wang, Duohong Chen, Haobo Tan, Hanbin Xu, Fei Li, Xuejiao Deng, Tao Deng, Jiaren Sun, and Jun Zhao\n\nAtmos.

We found that the physical properties of OA could vary in a large range at different particle sizes and affected the number concentration of CCN (NCCN) at all supersaturations. Our results highlight the importance of evaluating the atmospheric evolution processes of OA at different size ranges and their impact on climate effects.\n\nReconstructed daily ground-level O3 in China over 2005–2021 for climatological, ecological, and health research\n\nChenhong Zhou, Fan Wang, Yike Guo, Cheng Liu, Dongsheng Ji, Yuesi Wang, Xiaobin Xu, Xiao Lu, Yan Wang, Gregory Carmichael, and Meng Gao\n\nEarth Syst.

Taking Beijing as an example, three unfavorable synoptic weather patterns were identified to dominate the compound HW and O3 pollution events. Under the synergistic stress of HWs and O3 pollution, public mortality risk increased, and synoptic patterns and urbanization enhanced the compound risk of events in Beijing by 33.09 % and 18.95 %, respectively.\n\nN2O5 uptake onto saline mineral dust: a potential missing source of tropospheric ClNO2 in inland China\n\nHaichao Wang, Chao Peng, Xuan Wang, Shengrong Lou, Keding Lu, Guicheng Gan, Xiaohong Jia, Xiaorui Chen, Jun Chen, Hongli Wang, Shaojia Fan, Xinming Wang, and Mingjin Tang\n\nAtmos.

Phys., 22, 395–418, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-22-395-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-22-395-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe evaluate methane emissions and trends for 2010–2017 in the gridded national emission inventories for the United States, Canada, and Mexico by inversion of in situ and satellite methane observations. We find that anthropogenic methane emissions for all three countries are underestimated in the national inventories, largely driven by oil emissions. Anthropogenic methane emissions in the US peak in 2014, in contrast to the report of a steadily decreasing trend over 2010–2017 from the US EPA.\n\nMeasurement report: Vehicle-based multi-lidar observational study of the effect of meteorological elements on the three-dimensional distribution of particles in the western GuangdongâHong KongâMacao Greater Bay Area\n\nXinqi Xu, Jielan Xie, Yuman Li, Shengjie Miao, and Shaojia Fan\n\nAtmos.

Results showed that distribution of particles was closely related to horizontal wind speed and direction, vertical wind speed, and temperature. A model for meteorological elements affecting the vertical distribution of urban particles was offered in this study.\n\nGround-based vertical profile observations of atmospheric composition on the Tibetan PlateauÂ (2017â2019)\n\nChengzhi Xing, Cheng Liu, Hongyu Wu, Jinan Lin, Fan Wang, Shuntian Wang, and Meng Gao\n\nEarth Syst.

In this study, we used the online coupled WRF-Chem model to examine how emission control measures during the Asian-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) conference affect the mixing state and light absorption of BC and the associated implications for BC-PBL interactions.\n\nLarge-scale synoptic drivers of co-occurring summertime ozone and PM2.5 pollution in eastern China\n\nLian Zong, Yuanjian Yang, Meng Gao, Hong Wang, Peng Wang, Hongliang Zhang, Linlin Wang, Guicai Ning, Chao Liu, Yubin Li, and Zhiqiu Gao\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 21, 9105–9124, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-21-9105-2021,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-21-9105-2021, 2021\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nIn recent years, summer O3 pollution over eastern China has become more serious, and it is even the case that surface O3 and PM2.5 pollution can co-occur. However, the synoptic weather pattern (SWP) related to this compound pollution remains unclear. Regional PM2.5 and O3 compound pollution is characterized by various SWPs with different dominant factors. Our findings provide insights into the regional co-occurring high PM2.5 and O3 levels via the effects of certain meteorological factors.\n\nAir quality and health benefits from ultra-low emission control policy indicated by continuous emission monitoring: a case study in the Yangtze River Delta region, China\n\nYan Zhang, Yu Zhao, Meng Gao, Xin Bo, and Chris P. Nielsen\n\nAtmos. Chem.

Atmospheric observations and the air quality model were also used to demonstrate improvement of emission inventories incorporating online emission monitoring data. With implementation of the policy in both power and industrial sectors, the attributable deaths due to PM2.5 exposure are estimated to decrease 5.5 %.\n\nThe impact threshold of the aerosol radiative forcing on the boundary layer structure in the pollution region\n\nDandan Zhao, Jinyuan Xin, Chongshui Gong, Jiannong Quan, Yuesi Wang, Guiqian Tang, Yongxiang Ma, Lindong Dai, Xiaoyan Wu, Guangjing Liu, and Yongjing Ma\n\nAtmos.

The threshold of the modification effects of ARF on the boundary layer structure was determined for the first time, highlighting that once ARF exceeded a certain value, the boundary layer would quickly stabilize and aggravate air pollution. This could provide useful information for relevant atmospheric-environment improvement measures and policies.\n\nSensitivity of modeled Indian monsoon to Chinese and Indian aerosol emissions\n\nPeter Sherman, Meng Gao, Shaojie Song, Alex T. Archibald, Nathan Luke Abraham, Jean-FranÃ§ois Lamarque, Drew Shindell, Gregory Faluvegi, and Michael B. McElroy\n\nAtmos. Chem.

We find that increased sulfur emissions reduce precipitation, which is primarily dynamically driven due to spatial shifts in convection over the region. A significant increase in precipitation (up to ~ 20 %) is found only when both Indian and Chinese sulfate emissions are regulated.\n\nGlobal modeling of heterogeneous hydroxymethanesulfonate chemistry\n\nShaojie Song, Tao Ma, Yuzhong Zhang, Lu Shen, Pengfei Liu, Ke Li, Shixian Zhai, Haotian Zheng, Meng Gao, Jonathan M.

Model deficiency was related to the calculation of optical properties. In order to improve it, aerosol size representation needs to be refined in the calculations, and the representation of aerosol properties, such as size distribution, chemical composition, refractive index, hygroscopicity parameter, and density, needs to be improved.\n\nHaze pollution under a high atmospheric oxidization capacity in summer in Beijing: insights into formation mechanism of atmospheric physicochemical processes\n\nDandan Zhao, Guangjing Liu, Jinyuan Xin, Jiannong Quan, Yuesi Wang, Xin Wang, Lindong Dai, Wenkang Gao, Guiqian Tang, Bo Hu, Yongxiang Ma, Xiaoyan Wu, Lili Wang, Zirui Liu, and Fangkun Wu\n\nAtmos.

Phys., 20, 4575–4592, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-20-4575-2020,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-20-4575-2020, 2020\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nUnder strong atmospheric oxidization capacity, haze pollution in the summer in Beijing was the result of the synergistic effect of the physicochemical process in the atmospheric boundary layer (ABL). With the premise of an extremely stable ABL structure, the formation of secondary aerosols dominated by nitrate was quite intense, driving the outbreak of haze pollution.\n\nA revisiting of the parametrization of downward longwave radiation in summer over the Tibetan Plateau based on high-temporal-resolution measurements\n\nMengqi Liu, Xiangdong Zheng, Jinqiang Zhang, and Xiangao Xia\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 20, 4415–4426, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-20-4415-2020,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-20-4415-2020, 2020\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThis study uses 1 min radiation and lidar measurements at three stations over the Tibetan Plateau (TP) to parametrize downward longwave radiation (DLR) during summer months. Clear-sky DLR can be estimated from the best parametrization with a RMSE of 3.8 W m-2 and R2 > 0.98. Additionally cloud base height under overcast conditions is shown to play an important role in cloudy DLR parametrization, which is considered in the locally calibrated parametrization over the TP for the first time.\n\nOzone pollution over China and India: seasonality and sources\n\nMeng Gao, Jinhui Gao, Bin Zhu, Rajesh Kumar, Xiao Lu, Shaojie Song, Yuzhong Zhang, Beixi Jia, Peng Wang, Gufran Beig, Jianlin Hu, Qi Ying, Hongliang Zhang, Peter Sherman, and Michael B. McElroy\n\nAtmos. Chem.

The results show that deep convection in tropical cyclones over the western Pacific transports boundary air parcels with low ozone into the tropopause region. Subsequently, these air parcels are dehydrated when passing the lowest temperature region (< 190 K) during quasi-horizontal advection.\n\nEvaluation of NU-WRF model performance on air quality simulation under various model resolutions â an investigation within the framework of MICS-Asia PhaseÂ III\n\nZhining Tao, Mian Chin, Meng Gao, Tom Kucsera, Dongchul Kim, Huisheng Bian, Jun-ichi Kurokawa, Yuesi Wang, Zirui Liu, Gregory R. Carmichael, Zifa Wang, and Hajime Akimoto\n\nAtmos. Chem.

This study identified that a 15 km grid would be the optimal horizontal resolution in terms of performance and resource usage to capture average and extreme air quality over East Asia and is thus suggested for use in future MICS-Asia modeling activities if the investigation domain remains the same.\n\nChina's emission control strategies have suppressed unfavorable influences of climate on wintertime PM2.5 concentrations in Beijing since 2002\n\nMeng Gao, Zirui Liu, Bo Zheng, Dongsheng Ji, Peter Sherman, Shaojie Song, Jinyuan Xin, Cheng Liu, Yuesi Wang, Qiang Zhang, Jia Xing, Jingkun Jiang, Zifa Wang, Gregory R. Carmichael, and Michael B. McElroy\n\nAtmos. Chem.

During CSs a two-way feedback mechanism exists between unfavorable meteorological conditions and cumulative aerosol pollution. This two-way feedback is further quantified and its magnitude is compared.\n\nA top-down assessment using OMI NO2 suggests an underestimate in the NOx emissions inventory in Seoul, South Korea, during KORUS-AQ\n\nDaniel L. Goldberg, Pablo E. Saide, Lok N. Lamsal, Benjamin de Foy, Zifeng Lu, Jung-Hun Woo, Younha Kim, Jinseok Kim, Meng Gao, Gregory Carmichael, and David G. Streets\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 19, 1801–1818, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-19-1801-2019,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-19-1801-2019, 2019\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nUsing satellite data, we are able to estimate the emissions of NOx (NOx=NO+NO2), a toxic group of air pollutants, in the Seoul metropolitan area. We first develop an enhanced satellite product that better observes NO2 in urban regions. Using this new product, we derive NOx emissions to be twice as large as the emissions reported by the South Korean government. The implication is that the measures taken to reduce NOx emissions in South Korea have not been as effective as regulators have thought.\n\nPossible heterogeneous chemistry of hydroxymethanesulfonate (HMS) in northern China winter haze\n\nShaojie Song, Meng Gao, Weiqi Xu, Yele Sun, Douglas R. Worsnop, John T. Jayne, Yuzhong Zhang, Lei Zhu, Mei Li, Zhen Zhou, Chunlei Cheng, Yibing Lv, Ying Wang, Wei Peng, Xiaobin Xu, Nan Lin, Yuxuan Wang, Shuxiao Wang, J. William Munger, Daniel J.

We propose a potentially key pathway through the reaction of formaldehyde and sulfur dioxide that has not been accounted for in previous studies. The special atmospheric conditions favor the formation and existence of their complex, hydroxymethanesulfonate (HMS).\n\nHigh tropospheric ozone in Lhasa within the Asian summer monsoon anticyclone in 2013: influence of convective transport and stratospheric intrusions\n\nDan Li, BÃ¤rbel Vogel, Rolf MÃ¼ller, Jianchun Bian, Gebhard GÃ¼nther, Qian Li, Jinqiang Zhang, Zhixuan Bai, Holger VÃ¶mel, and Martin Riese\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 18, 17979–17994, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-18-17979-2018,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-18-17979-2018, 2018\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nBalloon-borne measurements performed over Lhasa in August 2013 are investigated using CLaMS trajectory calculations. Here, we focus on high ozone mixing ratios in the free troposphere. Our findings demonstrate that both stratospheric intrusions and convective transport of air pollution play a major role in enhancing middle and upper tropospheric ozone.\n\nDiurnal variation of aerosol optical depth and PM2.5 in South Korea: a synthesis from AERONET, satellite (GOCI), KORUS-AQ observation, and the WRF-Chem model\n\nElizabeth M. Lennartson, Jun Wang, Juping Gu, Lorena Castro Garcia, Cui Ge, Meng Gao, Myungje Choi, Pablo E. Saide, Gregory R. Carmichael, Jhoon Kim, and Scott J. Janz\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 18, 15125–15144, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-18-15125-2018,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-18-15125-2018, 2018\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThis paper is among the first to study the diurnal variations of AOD, PM2.5, and their relationships in South Korea. We show that the PM2.5–AOD relationship has strong diurnal variations, and, hence, using AOD data retrieved from geostationary satellite can improve the monitoring of surface PM2.5 air quality on a daily basis as well as constrain the diurnal variation of aerosol emission.\n\nFine-particle pH for Beijing winter haze as inferred from different thermodynamic equilibrium models\n\nShaojie Song, Meng Gao, Weiqi Xu, Jingyuan Shao, Guoliang Shi, Shuxiao Wang, Yuxuan Wang, Yele Sun, and Michael B. McElroy\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 18, 7423–7438, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-18-7423-2018,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-18-7423-2018, 2018\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nSevere haze events occur frequently over northern China, especially in winter. Acidity plays a critical role in the formation of secondary PM2.5 and its toxicity. Using field measurements of gases and particles to critically evaluate two thermodynamic models routinely employed to determine particle acidity, we found that China's winter haze particles are generally within a moderately acidic range (pH 4–5) and not highly acidic (0) or neutral (7) as has been previously reported in the literature.\n\nSelf-organized classification of boundary layer meteorology and associated characteristics of air quality in Beijing\n\nZhiheng Liao, Jiaren Sun, Jialin Yao, Li Liu, Haowen Li, Jian Liu, Jielan Xie, Dui Wu, and Shaojia Fan\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 18, 6771–6783, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-18-6771-2018,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-18-6771-2018, 2018\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThis paper investigates the modulation effect of ABL meteorology on Beijingâs surface air quality based on self-organizing maps. The self-organized ABL types correspond to significantly distinct pollutant loadings and diurnal evolution, particularly in winter. Anomalous stable ABL conditions are estimated to contribute 58.3 %, 46.4 % and 73.3 % of the elevated PM2.5 concentrations in January 2013, December 2015 and December 2016.\n\nAir quality and climate change, Topic 3 of the Model Inter-Comparison Study for Asia Phase III (MICS-Asia III) â PartÂ 1: Overview and model evaluation\n\nMeng Gao, Zhiwei Han, Zirui Liu, Meng Li, Jinyuan Xin, Zhining Tao, Jiawei Li, Jeong-Eon Kang, Kan Huang, Xinyi Dong, Bingliang Zhuang, Shu Li, Baozhu Ge, Qizhong Wu, Yafang Cheng, Yuesi Wang, Hyo-Jung Lee, Cheol-Hee Kim, Joshua S.

A comprehensive overview of the MICS-ASIA III Topic 3 study design is presented.\n\nLower tropospheric ozone over India and its linkage to the South Asian monsoon\n\nXiao Lu, Lin Zhang, Xiong Liu, Meng Gao, Yuanhong Zhao, and Jingyuan Shao\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 18, 3101–3118, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-18-3101-2018,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-18-3101-2018, 2018\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nDeteriorating tropospheric ozone pollution over India may not only affect local human health and vegetation but also perturb global ozone distribution. This study analyzes the processes controlling lower tropospheric ozone over India using OMI satellite observations (2006–2014) and model simulations (1990–2010). We show that the South Asian monsoon largely controls the seasonal cycle and interannual variability of Indian lower tropospheric ozone via changes in ozone production and transport.\n\nImpact of typhoons on the composition of the upper troposphere within the Asian summer monsoon anticyclone: the SWOP campaign in Lhasa 2013\n\nDan Li, BÃ¤rbel Vogel, Jianchun Bian, Rolf MÃ¼ller, Laura L. Pan, Gebhard GÃ¼nther, Zhixuan Bai, Qian Li, Jinqiang Zhang, Qiujun Fan, and Holger VÃ¶mel\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 17, 4657–4672, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-17-4657-2017,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-17-4657-2017, 2017\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nHigh-resolution ozone and water vapour profiles over Lhasa, China, were measured in August 2013. The correlations between ozone and water vapour profiles show a strong variability in the upper troposphere. These relationships were investigated using CLaMS trajectory calculations. The model results demonstrate that three tropical cyclones (Jebi, Utor, and Trami), occurring over the western Pacific, had a strong impact on the vertical structure of ozone and water vapour profiles.\n\nResponse of winter fine particulate matter concentrations to emission and meteorology changes in North China\n\nMeng Gao, Gregory R. Carmichael, Pablo E. Saide, Zifeng Lu, Man Yu, David G. Streets, and Zifa Wang\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 16, 11837–11851, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-16-11837-2016,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-16-11837-2016, 2016\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe WRF-Chem model was used to examine how the winter PM2.5 concentrations change in response to changes in emissions and meteorology in North China from 1960 to 2010. The discussions in this study indicate that dramatic changes in emissions are the main cause of increasing haze events in North China, and long-term trends in atmospheric circulations maybe another important cause. We also found aerosol feedbacks have been significantly enhanced from 1960 to 2010, due to higher aerosol loadings.\n\nMixing layer height and its implications for air pollution over Beijing, China\n\nGuiqian Tang, Jinqiang Zhang, Xiaowan Zhu, Tao Song, Christoph MÃ¼nkel, Bo Hu, Klaus SchÃ¤fer, Zirui Liu, Junke Zhang, Lili Wang, Jinyuan Xin, Peter Suppan, and Yuesi Wang\n\nAtmos.

The novelty, originality, and importance of this paper are as follows: (1) the applicable conditions of the ceilometer; (2) the variations of mixing layer height; (3) thermal/dynamic structure inside mixing layers with different degrees of pollution; and (4) critical meteorological conditions for the formation of heavy air pollution.\n\nModeling study of the 2010 regional haze event in the North China Plain\n\nM.

Air pollutants outside Beijing contributed about 64.5 % to the PM2.5 levels in Beijing during this haze event, and most of them are from south Hebei, Tianjin city, Shandong and Henan provinces. In addition, aerosol feedback has important impacts on surface temperature, Relative Humidity (RH) and wind speeds, and these meteorological variables affect aerosol distribution and formation in turn.\n\nGround-level ozone in four Chinese cities: precursors, regional transport and heterogeneous processes\n\nL.

These findings challenge models to replicate the trends produced by the SHADOZ and meteorological observations and emphasize the importance of studying monthly or seasonal instead of annual changes for understanding ozone trends.\n\nAir mass transport to the tropical western Pacific troposphere inferred from ozone and relative humidity balloon observations above Palau\n\nKatrin MÃ¼ller, Peter von der Gathen, and Markus Rex\n\nAtmos. Chem.

A prominent anti-correlation between both tracers separates air masses of different origin and genesis. Back trajectories confirm a local convective origin of the year-round humid ozone-poor background. Anomalously dry ozone-rich air is generated in tropical Asia by pollution and dehydrated during transport via radiative cooling.\n\nAtmospheric NH3 in urban Beijing: long-term variations and implications for secondary inorganic aerosol control\n\nZiru Lan, Xiaoyi Zhang, Weili Lin, Xiaobin Xu, Zhiqiang Ma, Jun Jin, Lingyan Wu, and Yangmei Zhang\n\nEGUsphere, https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-375,https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-375, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nOur study examined the long-term trends of atmospheric ammonia in urban Beijing from 2009 to 2020. We found that the trends didn't match satellite data or emissions estimates, revealing complexities in ammonia sources. While seasonal variations in ammonia were temperature-dependent, daily variations were correlated with water vapor. We also found an increasing contribution of ammonia reduction, emphasizing its importance in mitigating fine particulate matter in Beijing.\n\nSix years of continuous carbon isotope composition measurements of methane in Heidelberg (Germany) â a study of source contributions and comparison to emission inventories\n\nAntje Hoheisel and Martina Schmidt\n\nAtmos.

These 6-year time series are analysed with the Keeling plot method for the isotopic composition of the sources, as well as seasonal variations and trends in methane emissions. The source contributions derived from atmospheric measurements were used to evaluate global and regional emission inventories of methane.\n\nWhat caused large ozone variabilities in three megacity clusters in eastern China during 2015â2020?\n\nTingting Hu, Yu Lin, Run Liu, Yuepeng Xu, Shanshan Ouyang, Boguang Wang, Yuanhang Zhang, and Shaw Chen Liu\n\nAtmos.

Phys., 24, 1607–1626, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-24-1607-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-24-1607-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe hypothesize that the cause of the worsening O3 trends in the Beijing–Tianjin–Hebei region, the Yangtze River Delta, and Pearl River Delta from 2015 to 2020 is attributable to the increased occurrence of meteorological conditions of high solar radiation and a positive temperature anomaly under the influence of West Pacific subtropical high, tropical cyclones, and mid–high-latitude wave activities.\n\nAtmospheric turbulence observed during a fuel-bed-scale low-intensity surface fire\n\nJoseph Seitz, Shiyuan Zhong, Joseph J. Charney, Warren E. Heilman, Kenneth L. Clark, Xindi Bian, Nicholas S. Skowronski, Michael R. Gallagher, Matthew Patterson, Jason Cole, Michael T. Kiefer, Rory Hadden, and Eric Mueller\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 24, 1119–1142, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-24-1119-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-24-1119-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nAtmospheric turbulence affects wildland fire behaviors and heat and smoke transfer. Turbulence data collected during an experimental fire on a 10 m x 10 m densely instrumented burn plot are analyzed, and the results reveal substantial heterogeneity in fire-induced turbulence characteristics across the small plot, which highlights the necessity for coupled atmosphere–fire behavior models to have 1–2 m grid spacing so that adequate simulations of fire behavior and smoke transfer can be achieved.\n\nHow Rainfall Events Modify Trace Gas Concentrations in Central Amazonia\n\nLuiz A.

This analysis helps to understand the sources and sinks of trace gases within a forest ecosystem. It elucidates processes that are not discernible under undisturbed conditions and contributes to a deeper understanding of the trace gas life cycle and its intricate interactions with cloud dynamics in the Amazon\n\nFingerprints of the COVID-19 economic downturn and recovery on ozone anomalies at high-elevation sites in North America and western Europe\n\nDavide Putero, Paolo Cristofanelli, Kai-Lan Chang, GaÃ«lle Dufour, Gregory Beachley, CÃ©dric Couret, Peter Effertz, Daniel A. Jaffe, Dagmar Kubistin, Jason Lynch, Irina Petropavlovskikh, Melissa Puchalski, Timothy Sharac, Barkley C. Sive, Martin Steinbacher, Carlos Torres, and Owen R. Cooper\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 23, 15693–15709, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-23-15693-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-23-15693-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe investigated the impact of societal restriction measures during the COVID-19 pandemic on surface ozone at 41 high-elevation sites worldwide. Negative ozone anomalies were observed for spring and summer 2020 for all of the regions considered. In 2021, negative anomalies continued for Europe and partially for the eastern US, while western US sites showed positive anomalies due to wildfires. IASI satellite data and the Carbon Monitor supported emission reductions as a cause of the anomalies.\n\nOzone in the boreal forest in the Alberta Oil Sands Region\n\nXuanyi Zhang, Mark Gordon, Paul A. Makar, Timothy Jiang, Jonathan Davies, and David Tarasick\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 23, 13647–13664, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-23-13647-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-23-13647-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nMeasurements of ozone in the atmosphere were made in a forest downwind of oil sands mining and production facilities in northern Alberta. These measurements show that the emissions of other pollutants from oil sands production and processing reduce the amount of ozone in the forest. By using an atmospheric model combined with measurements, we find that the rate at which ozone is absorbed by the forest is lower than typical rates from similar measurements in other forests.\n\nZugspitze ozone 1970â2020: the role of stratosphereâtroposphere transport\n\nThomas Trickl, CÃ©dric Couret, Ludwig Ries, and Hannes Vogelmann\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 23, 8403–8427, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-23-8403-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-23-8403-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nDownward atmospheric transport from the stratosphere (STT) is the most important natural source of tropospheric ozone. We analyse the stratospheric influence on the long-term series of ozone and carbon monoxide measured on the Zugspitze in the Bavarian Alps (2962 m a.s.l.). Since the 1970s, there has been a pronounced ozone rise that has been ascribed to an increase in STT. We determine the stratospheric influence from the observational data alone (humidity and 7Be).\n\nHigh sulfur dioxide deposition velocities measured with the fluxâgradient technique in a boreal forest in the Alberta Oil Sands Region\n\nMark Gordon, Dane Blanchard, Timothy Jiang, Paul A. Makar, Ralf M. Staebler, Julian Aherne, Cris Mihele, and Xuanyi Zhang\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 23, 7241–7255, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-23-7241-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-23-7241-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nMeasurements of the gas sulfur dioxide (SO2) were made in a forest downwind of oil sands mining and production facilities in northern Alberta. These measurements tell us the rate at which SO2 is absorbed by the forest. The measured rate is much higher than what is currently used by air quality models, which is supported by a previous study in this region. This suggests that SO2 may have a much shorter lifetime in the atmosphere at this location than currently predicted by models.\n\nQuantification of methane emissions in Hamburg using a network of FTIR spectrometers and an inverse modeling approach\n\nAndreas Forstmaier, Jia Chen, Florian Dietrich, Juan Bettinelli, Hossein Maazallahi, Carsten Schneider, Dominik Winkler, Xinxu Zhao, Taylor Jones, Carina van der Veen, Norman Wildmann, Moritz Makowski, Aydin Uzun, Friedrich Klappenbach, Hugo Denier van der Gon, Stefan Schwietzke, and Thomas RÃ¶ckmann\n\nAtmos.

In this study, we measured the release of one important green house gas, methane, in Hamburg. Multiple sources that contribute to methane emissions were located and quantified. Methane sources were found to be mainly caused by human activity (e.g., by release from oil and gas refineries). Moreover, potential natural sources have been located, such as the Elbe River and lakes.\n\nLocal-to-regional methane emissions from the Upper Silesian Coal Basin (USCB) quantified using UAV-based atmospheric measurements\n\nTruls Andersen, Zhao Zhao, Marcel de Vries, Jaroslaw Necki, Justyna Swolkien, Malika Menoud, Thomas RÃ¶ckmann, Anke Roiger, Andreas Fix, Wouter Peters, and Huilin Chen\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 23, 5191–5216, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-23-5191-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-23-5191-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe Upper Silesian Coal Basin, Poland, is one of the hot spots of methane emissions in Europe. Using an uncrewed aerial vehicle (UAV), we performed atmospheric measurements of methane concentrations downwind of five ventilation shafts in this region and determined the emission rates from the individual shafts. We found a strong correlation between quantified shaft-averaged emission rates and hourly inventory data, which also allows us to estimate the methane emissions from the entire region.\n\nTransport pathways of carbon monoxide from Indonesian fire pollution to a subtropical high-altitude mountain site in the western North Pacific\n\nSaginela Ravindra Babu, Chang-Feng Ou-Yang, Stephen M. Griffith, Shantanu Kumar Pani, Steven Soon-Kai Kong, and Neng-Huei Lin\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 23, 4727–4740, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-23-4727-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-23-4727-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nIn October 2006 and 2015, extensive fire episodes occurred in Indonesia, releasing an enormous amount of CO emissions. By combining in situ and satellite CO measurements and reanalysis products, we reported plausible transport pathways of CO from Indonesia to the Lulin Atmospheric Background Station (LABS; 23.47° N, 120.87° E; 2862 m a.s.l.) in Taiwan. We identified (i) horizontal transport in the free troposphere and (ii) vertical transport through the Hadley circulation.\n\nGlobal warming will largely increase waste treatment CH4 emissions in Chinese megacities: insight from the first city-scale CH4 concentration observation network in Hangzhou, China\n\nCheng Hu, Junqing Zhang, Bing Qi, Rongguang Du, Xiaofei Xu, Haoyu Xiong, Huili Liu, Xinyue Ai, Yiyi Peng, and Wei Xiao\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 23, 4501–4520, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-23-4501-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-23-4501-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe build the first city-scale tower-based atmospheric CH4 concentration observation network in China. The a priori total annual anthropogenic CH4 emissions and emissions from waste treatment were overestimated by 36.0 % and 47.1 %, respectively, in Hangzhou. Global warming will largely enhance the CH4 emission factor of waste treatment, which will increase by 17.6 %, 9.6 %, 5.6 % and 4.0 % for Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) 8.5, RCP6.0, RCP4.5 and RCP2.6, respectively, by 2100.\n\nDisentangling methane and carbon dioxide sources and transport across the Russian Arctic from aircraft measurements\n\nClÃ©ment Narbaud, Jean-Daniel Paris, Sophie Wittig, Antoine Berchet, Marielle Saunois, Philippe NÃ©dÃ©lec, Boris D. Belan, Mikhail Y. Arshinov, Sergei B. Belan, Denis Davydov, Alexander Fofonov, and Artem Kozlov\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 23, 2293–2314, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-23-2293-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-23-2293-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe measured CH4 and CO2 from aircraft over the Russian Arctic. Analyzing our data with the Lagrangian model FLEXPART, we find a sharp east–west gradient in atmospheric composition. Western Siberia is influenced by strong wetland CH4 emissions, deep CO2 gradient from biospheric uptake, and long-range transport from Europe and North America. Eastern flights document less variability. Over the Arctic Ocean, we find a small influence from marine CH4 emissions compatible with reasonable inventories.\n\nAirborne glyoxal measurements in the marine and continental atmosphere: comparison with TROPOMI observations and EMAC simulations\n\nFlora Kluge, Tilman HÃ¼neke, Christophe Lerot, Simon Rosanka, Meike K. Rotermund, Domenico Taraborrelli, Benjamin Weyland, and Klaus Pfeilsticker\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 23, 1369–1401, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-23-1369-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-23-1369-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nUsing airborne glyoxal concentration and vertical column density measurements, vertical profiles are inferred for eight global regions in aged biomass burning plumes and the tropical marine boundary layer. Using TROPOMI observations, an analysis of space- and airborne measurements is performed. A comparison to EMAC simulations shows a general glyoxal underprediction, which points to various missing sources and precursors from anthropogenic activities, biomass burning, and the sea surface.\n\nMercury in the free troposphere and bidirectional atmosphereâvegetation exchanges â insights from MaÃ¯do mountain observatory in the Southern Hemisphere tropics\n\nAlkuin M. Koenig, Olivier Magand, Bert Verreyken, Jerome Brioude, Crist Amelynck, Niels Schoon, AurÃ©lie Colomb, Beatriz Ferreira Araujo, Michel Ramonet, Mahesh K. Sha, Jean-Pierre Cammas, Jeroen E. Sonke, and AurÃ©lien Dommergue\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 23, 1309–1328, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-23-1309-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-23-1309-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe global distribution of mercury, a potent neurotoxin, depends on atmospheric transport, chemistry, and interactions between the Earthâs surface and the air. Our understanding of these processes is still hampered by insufficient observations. Here, we present new data from a mountain observatory in the Southern Hemisphere. We give insights into mercury concentrations in air masses coming from aloft, and we show that tropical mountain vegetation may be a daytime source of mercury to the air.\n\nDiurnal variability of atmospheric O2, CO2, and their exchange ratio above a boreal forest in southern Finland\n\nKim A. P. Faassen, Linh N. T. Nguyen, Eadin R. Broekema, Bert A. M. Kers, Ivan Mammarella, Timo Vesala, Penelope A. Pickers, Andrew C. Manning, Jordi VilÃ -Guerau de Arellano, Harro A. J. Meijer, Wouter Peters, and Ingrid T. Luijkx\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 23, 851–876, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-23-851-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-23-851-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe exchange ratio (ER) between atmospheric O2 and CO2 provides a useful tracer for separately estimating photosynthesis and respiration processes in the forest carbon balance. This is highly relevant to better understand the expected biosphere sink, which determines future atmospheric CO2 levels. We therefore measured O2, CO2, and their ER above a boreal forest in Finland and investigated their diurnal behaviour for a representative day, and we show the most suitable way to determine the ER.\n\nHow adequately are elevated moist layers represented in reanalysis and satellite observations?\n\nMarc Prange, Stefan A. Buehler, and Manfred Brath\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 23, 725–741, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-23-725-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-23-725-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe investigate the representation of elevated moist layers (EMLs) in two satellite retrieval products and ERA5 reanalysis. EMLs occur in the vicinity of tropical convective storms and are thought to have an impact on their evolution through radiative heating. We provide a first dedicated assessment of EMLs in long-term data products in terms of moist layer strength, vertical thickness and altitude by comparing to collocated radiosondes over the western Pacific, a region where EMLs often occur.\n\nQuantitative impacts of vertical transport on the long-term trend of nocturnal ozone increase over the Pearl River Delta region during 2006â2019\n\nYongkang Wu, Weihua Chen, Yingchang You, Qianqian Xie, Shiguo Jia, and Xuemei Wang\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 23, 453–469, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-23-453-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-23-453-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nRelying on observed and simulated data, we determine the spatiotemporal characteristics of nocturnal O3 increase (NOI) events in the Pearl River Delta region during 2006–2019. Low-level jets and convective storms are the main meteorological processes causing NOI. Daytime O3 is another essential influencing factor. More importantly, a more prominent role of meteorological processes in NOI has been demonstrated. Our study highlights the important role of meteorology in nocturnal O3 pollution.\n\nFactors influencing the temporal variability of atmospheric methane emissions from Upper Silesia coal mines: a case study from the CoMet mission\n\nJustyna SwolkieÅ, Andreas Fix, and MichaÅ GaÅkowski\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 22, 16031–16052, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-22-16031-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-22-16031-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nDetermination of emissions from coal mines on a local scale requires instantaneous data. We analysed temporal emission data for ventilation shafts and factors influencing their variability. They were saturation of the seams with methane, the permeability of the rock mass, and coal output. The data for the verification should reflect the actual values of emissions from point sources. It is recommended to achieve this by using a standardised emission measurement system for all coal mines.\n\nEnhanced natural releases of mercury in response to the reduction in anthropogenic emissions during the COVID-19 lockdown by explainable machine learning\n\nXiaofei Qin, Shengqian Zhou, Hao Li, Guochen Wang, Cheng Chen, Chengfeng Liu, Xiaohao Wang, Juntao Huo, Yanfen Lin, Jia Chen, Qingyan Fu, Yusen Duan, Kan Huang, and Congrui Deng\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 22, 15851–15865, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-22-15851-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-22-15851-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nUsing artificial neural network modeling and an explainable analysis approach, natural surface emissions (NSEs) were identified as a main driver of gaseous elemental mercury (GEM) variations during the COVID-19 lockdown. A sharp drop in GEM concentrations due to a significant reduction in anthropogenic emissions may disrupt the surface–air exchange balance of Hg, leading to increases in NSEs. This implies that NSEs may pose challenges to the future control of Hg pollution.\n\nTemporal variability of tropospheric ozone and ozone profiles in the Korean Peninsula during the East Asian summer monsoon: insights from multiple measurements and reanalysis datasets\n\nJuseon Bak, Eun-Ji Song, Hyo-Jung Lee, Xiong Liu, Ja-Ho Koo, Joowan Kim, Wonbae Jeon, Jae-Hwan Kim, and Cheol-Hee Kim\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 22, 14177–14187, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-22-14177-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-22-14177-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nOur study investigates the temporal variations of ozone profiles at Pohang in the Korean Peninsula from multiple ozone products. We discuss the quantitative relationships between daily surface measurements and key meteorological variables, different seasonality of ozone between the troposphere and stratosphere, and interannual changes in the lower tropospheric ozone, linked by the weather pattern driven by the East Asian summer monsoon.\n\nRetrieving CH4-emission rates from coal mine ventilation shafts using UAV-based AirCore observations and the genetic algorithmâinterior point penalty function (GA-IPPF) model\n\nTianqi Shi, Zeyu Han, Ge Han, Xin Ma, Huilin Chen, Truls Andersen, Huiqin Mao, Cuihong Chen, Haowei Zhang, and Wei Gong\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 22, 13881–13896, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-22-13881-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-22-13881-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nCH4 works as the second-most important greenhouse gas, its reported emission inventories being far less than CO2. In this study, we developed a self-adjusted model to estimate the CH4 emission rate from strong point sources by the UAV-based AirCore system. This model would reduce the uncertainty in CH4 emission rate quantification accrued by errors in measurements of wind and concentration. Actual measurements on PniÃ³wek coal demonstrate the high accuracy and stability of our developed model.\n\nMeasurement report: Atmospheric mercury in a coastal city of Southeast China â inter-annual variations and influencing factors\n\nJiayan Shi, Yuping Chen, Lingling Xu, Youwei Hong, Mengren Li, Xiaolong Fan, Liqian Yin, Yanting Chen, Chen Yang, Gaojie Chen, Taotao Liu, Xiaoting Ji, and Jinsheng Chen\n\nAtmos. Chem.

The observed GEM concentrations showed no distinct inter-annual variation trends. The interpretation rate of transportation and meteorology on GEM variations displayed an increasing trend. In contrast, anthropogenic emissions have shown a decreasing interpretation rate since 2012, indicating the effectiveness of emission mitigation measures in reducing GEM concentrations in the study region.\n\nTropospheric and stratospheric ozone profiles during the 2019 TROpomi vaLIdation eXperiment (TROLIX-19)\n\nJohn T.

The research presented here focuses on using ozone lidars from NASAâs Goddard Space Flight Center to better evaluate the characterization of ozone throughout TROLIX-19 as compared to balloon-borne, space-borne and ground-based passive measurements, as well as a global coupled chemistry meteorology model.\n\nEvaluation of correlated Pandora column NO2 and in situ surface NO2 measurements during GMAP campaign\n\nLim-Seok Chang, Donghee Kim, Hyunkee Hong, Deok-Rae Kim, Jeong-Ah Yu, Kwangyul Lee, Hanlim Lee, Daewon Kim, Jinkyu Hong, Hyun-Young Jo, and Cheol-Hee Kim\n\nAtmos.

It has several points to note for vertical distribution analysis. Particularly under prevailing local wind meteorological conditions, Pandora-based vertical structures sometimes showed negative correlations between column and surface measurements. Vertical analysis should be done carefully in some local meteorological conditions when employing either surface or columns.\n\nTransport of substantial stratospheric ozone to the surface by a dying typhoon and shallow convection\n\nZhixiong Chen, Jane Liu, Xiushu Qie, Xugeng Cheng, Yukun Shen, Mengmiao Yang, Rubin Jiang, and Xiangke Liu\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 22, 8221–8240, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-22-8221-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-22-8221-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nA vigorous surface ozone surge event of stratospheric origin occurred in the North China Plain at night. Surface ozone concentrations were 40–50 ppbv higher than the corresponding monthly mean, whereas surface carbon monoxide concentrations declined abruptly, which confirmed the direct stratospheric intrusions to the surface. We further addressed the notion that a combined effect of the dying typhoon and mesoscale convective systems was responsible for this vigorous ozone surge.\n\nObservational constraints on methane emissions from Polish coal mines using a ground-based remote sensing network\n\nAndreas Luther, Julian Kostinek, Ralph Kleinschek, Sara Defratyka, Mila StanisavljeviÄ, Andreas Forstmaier, Alexandru Dandocsi, Leon Scheidweiler, Darko Dubravica, Norman Wildmann, Frank Hase, Matthias M. Frey, Jia Chen, Florian Dietrich, JarosÅaw NeÌ§cki, Justyna SwolkieÅ, Christoph Knote, Sanam N. Vardag, Anke Roiger, and AndrÃ© Butz\n\nAtmos. Chem.

In order to reduce and mitigate methane emissions, it is important to know how much and where the methane is emitted. We estimated coal mining methane emissions in Poland based on atmospheric methane measurements and particle dispersion modeling. In general, our emission estimates suggest higher emissions than expected by previous annual emission reports.\n\nContinuous CH4 and Î´13CH4 measurements in London demonstrate under-reported natural gas leakage\n\nEric Saboya, Giulia Zazzeri, Heather Graven, Alistair J. Manning, and Sylvia Englund Michel\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 22, 3595–3613, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-22-3595-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-22-3595-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nContinuous measurements of atmospheric methane concentrations and its carbon-13 isotope have been made in central London since early 2018. These measurements were used to evaluate methane emissions reported in global and UK-specific emission inventories for the London area. Compared to atmospheric methane measurements from March 2018 to October 2020, both inventories are under-reporting natural gas leakage for the London area.\n\nLong-term fluxes of carbonyl sulfide and their seasonality and interannual variability in a boreal forest\n\nTimo Vesala, Kukka-Maaria Kohonen, Linda M. J. Kooijmans, Arnaud P. Praplan, Lenka FoltÃ½novÃ¡, Pasi Kolari, Markku Kulmala, Jaana BÃ¤ck, David Nelson, Dan Yakir, Mark Zahniser, and Ivan Mammarella\n\nAtmos. Chem.

We present an easy-to-use flux parameterization and the longest existing time series of forest–atmosphere COS exchange measurements, which allow us to study both seasonal and interannual variability. We observed only uptake of COS by the forest on an annual basis, with 37 % variability between years. Upscaling the boreal COS uptake using a biosphere model indicates a significant missing COS sink at high latitudes.\n\nDeclines and peaks in NO2 pollution during the multiple waves of the COVID-19 pandemic in the New York metropolitan area\n\nMaria Tzortziou, Charlotte F. Kwong, Daniel Goldberg, Luke Schiferl, RÃ³isÃ­n Commane, Nader Abuhassan, James J. Szykman, and Lukas C. Valin\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 22, 2399–2417, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-22-2399-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-22-2399-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic created an extreme natural experiment in which sudden changes in human behavior significantly impacted urban air quality. Using a combination of model, satellite, and ground-based data, we examine the impact of multiple waves and phases of the pandemic on atmospheric nitrogen pollution in the New York metropolitan area, and address the role of weather as a key driver of high pollution episodes observed even during – and despite – the stringent early lockdowns.\n\nMeasurement report: Characterization of uncertainties in fluxes and fuel sulfur content from ship emissions in the Baltic Sea\n\nJari Walden, Liisa Pirjola, Tuomas Laurila, Juha Hatakka, Heidi Pettersson, Tuomas Walden, Jukka-Pekka Jalkanen, Harri Nordlund, Toivo Truuts, Miika Meretoja, and Kimmo K. Kahma\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 21, 18175–18194, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-21-18175-2021,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-21-18175-2021, 2021\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nShip emissions play an important role in the deposition of gaseous compounds and nanoparticles (Ntot), affecting climate, human health (especially in coastal areas), and eutrophication. Micrometeorological methods showed that ship emissions were mainly responsible for the deposition of Ntot, whereas they only accounted for a minor proportion of CO2 deposition. An uncertainty analysis applied to the fluxes and fuel sulfur content results demonstrated the reliability of the results.\n\nLimitations of the radon tracer method (RTM) to estimate regional greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions â a case study for methane in Heidelberg\n\nIngeborg Levin, Ute Karstens, Samuel Hammer, Julian DellaColetta, Fabian Maier, and Maksym Gachkivskyi\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 21, 17907–17926, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-21-17907-2021,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-21-17907-2021, 2021\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe radon tracer method is applied to atmospheric methane and radon observations from the upper Rhine valley to independently estimate methane emissions from the region. Comparison of our top-down results with bottom-up inventory data requires high-resolution footprint modelling and representative radon flux data. In agreement with inventories, observed emissions decreased, but only until 2005. A limitation of this method is that point-source emissions are not captured or not fully captured.\n\nPositive and negative influences of typhoons on tropospheric ozone over southern China\n\nZhixiong Chen, Jane Liu, Xugeng Cheng, Mengmiao Yang, and Hong Wang\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 21, 16911–16923, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-21-16911-2021,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-21-16911-2021, 2021\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nUsing a large ensemble of typhoons, we investigate the impacts of evolving typhoons on tropospheric ozone and address the linkages between typhoon-affected meteorological conditions and ozone variations. The influences of typhoon-induced stratospheric intrusions on lower-troposphere ozone are also quantified. Thus, the results obtained in this study have important implications for a full understanding of the multifaced roles of typhoons in modulating tropospheric ozone variation.\n\nSpatial and temporal variations of CO2 mole fractions observed at Beijing, Xianghe, and Xinglong in North China\n\nYang Yang, Minqiang Zhou, Ting Wang, Bo Yao, Pengfei Han, Denghui Ji, Wei Zhou, Yele Sun, Gengchen Wang, and Pucai Wang\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 21, 11741–11757, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-21-11741-2021,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-21-11741-2021, 2021\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThis study introduces the in situ CO2 measurement system installed in Beijing (urban), Xianghe (suburban), and Xinglong (rural) in North China for the first time. The spatial and temporal variations in CO2 mole fractions at the three sites between June 2018 and April 2020 are discussed on both seasonal and diurnal scales.\n\nThe CO2 integral emission by the megacity of St Petersburg as quantified from ground-based FTIR measurements combined with dispersion modelling\n\nDmitry V. Ionov, Maria V. Makarova, Frank Hase, Stefani C. Foka, Vladimir S. Kostsov, Carlos Alberti, Thomas Blumenstock, Thorsten Warneke, and Yana A. Virolainen\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 21, 10939–10963, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-21-10939-2021,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-21-10939-2021, 2021\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nMegacities are a significant source of emissions of various substances in the atmosphere, including carbon dioxide, which is the most important anthropogenic greenhouse gas. In 2019–2020, the Emission Monitoring Mobile Experiment was carried out in St Petersburg, which is the second-largest industrial city in Russia. The results of this experiment, coupled with numerical modelling, helped to estimate the amount of CO2 emitted by the city. This value was twice as high as predicted.\n\nAnthropogenic and natural controls on atmospheric Î´13C-CO2 variations in the Yangtze River delta: insights from a carbon isotope modeling framework\n\nCheng Hu, Jiaping Xu, Cheng Liu, Yan Chen, Dong Yang, Wenjing Huang, Lichen Deng, Shoudong Liu, Timothy J. Griffis, and Xuhui Lee\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 21, 10015–10037, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-21-10015-2021,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-21-10015-2021, 2021\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nSeventy percent of global CO2 emissions were emitted from urban landscapes. The Yangtze River delta (YRD) ranks as one of the most densely populated regions in the world and is an anthropogenic CO2 hotspot. Besides anthropogenic factors, natural ecosystems and croplands act as significant CO2 sinks and sources. Independent quantification of the fossil and cement CO2 emission and assessment of their impact on atmospheric δ13C-CO2 have potential to improve our understanding of urban CO2 cycling.\n\nQuantifying variability, source, and transport of CO in the urban areas over the Himalayas and Tibetan Plateau\n\nYouwen Sun, Hao Yinâââââââ, Yuan Cheng, Qianggong Zhang, Bo Zheng, Justus Notholt, Xiao Lu, Cheng Liu, Yuan Tian, and Jianguo Liu\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 21, 9201–9222, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-21-9201-2021,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-21-9201-2021, 2021\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe quantified the variability, source, and transport of urban CO over the Himalayas and Tibetan Plateau (HTP) by using measurement, model simulation, and the analysis of meteorological fields. Urban CO over the HTP is dominated by anthropogenic and biomass burning emissions from local, South Asia and East Asia, and oxidation sources. The decreasing trends in surface CO since 2015 in most cities over the HTP are attributed to the reduction in local and transported CO emissions in recent years.\n\nNew methodology shows short atmospheric lifetimes of oxidized sulfur and nitrogen due to dry deposition\n\nKatherine Hayden, Shao-Meng Li, Paul Makar, John Liggio, Samar G. Moussa, Ayodeji Akingunola, Robert McLaren, Ralf M. Staebler, Andrea Darlington, Jason O'Brien, Junhua Zhang, Mengistu Wolde, and Leiming Zhang\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 21, 8377–8392, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-21-8377-2021,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-21-8377-2021, 2021\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe developed a method using aircraft measurements to determine lifetimes with respect to dry deposition for oxidized sulfur and nitrogen compounds over the boreal forest in Alberta, Canada. Atmospheric lifetimes were significantly shorter than derived from chemical transport models with differences related to modelled dry deposition velocities. The shorter lifetimes suggest models need to reassess dry deposition treatment and predictions of sulfur and nitrogen in the atmosphere and ecosystems.\n\nUncertainties in eddy covariance airâsea CO2 flux measurements and implications for gas transfer velocity parameterisations\n\nYuanxu Dong, Mingxi Yang, Dorothee C. E. Bakker, Vassilis Kitidis, and Thomas G. Bell\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 21, 8089–8110, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-21-8089-2021,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-21-8089-2021, 2021\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nEddy covariance (EC) is the most direct method for measuring air–sea CO2 flux from ships. However, uncertainty in EC air–sea CO2 fluxes has not been well quantified. Here we show that with the state-of-the-art gas analysers, instrumental noise no longer contributes significantly to the CO2 flux uncertainty. Applying an appropriate averaging timescale (1–3 h) and suitable air–sea CO2 fugacity threshold (at least 20 Âµatm) to EC flux data enables an optimal analysis of the gas transfer velocity.\n\nConvergent evidence for the pervasive but limited contribution of biomass burning to atmospheric ammonia in peninsular Southeast Asia\n\nYunhua Chang, Yan-Lin Zhang, Sawaeng Kawichai, Qian Wang, Martin Van Damme, Lieven Clarisse, Tippawan Prapamontol, and Moritz F. Lehmann\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 21, 7187–7198, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-21-7187-2021,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-21-7187-2021, 2021\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nIn this study, we integrated satellite constraints on atmospheric NH3 levels and fire intensity, discrete NH3 concentration measurement, and N isotopic analysis of NH3 in order to assess the regional-scale contribution of biomass burning to ambient atmospheric NH3 in the heartland of Southeast Asia. The combined approach provides a valuable cross-validation framework for source apportioning of NH3 in the lower atmosphere and will thus help to ameliorate predictions of biomass burning emissions.\n\nConcurrent variation in oil and gas methane emissions and oil price during the COVID-19 pandemic\n\nDavid R. Lyon, Benjamin Hmiel, Ritesh Gautam, Mark Omara, Katherine A. Roberts, Zachary R. Barkley, Kenneth J. Davis, Natasha L. Miles, Vanessa C. Monteiro, Scott J. Richardson, Stephen Conley, Mackenzie L. Smith, Daniel J. Jacob, Lu Shen, Daniel J. Varon, Aijun Deng, Xander Rudelis, Nikhil Sharma, Kyle T. Story, Adam R. Brandt, Mary Kang, Eric A. Kort, Anthony J. Marchese, and Steven P. Hamburg\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 21, 6605–6626, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-21-6605-2021,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-21-6605-2021, 2021\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe Permian Basin (USA) is the worldâs largest oil field. We use tower- and aircraft-based approaches to measure how methane emissions in the Permian Basin changed throughout 2020. In early 2020, 3.3 % of the regionâs gas was emitted; then in spring 2020, the loss rate temporarily dropped to 1.9 % as oil price crashed. We find this short-term reduction to be a result of reduced well development, less gas flaring, and fewer abnormal events despite minimal reductions in oil and gas production.\n\nOzone variability induced by synoptic weather patterns in warm seasons of 2014â2018 over the Yangtze River Delta region, China\n\nDa Gao, Min Xie, Jane Liu, Tijian Wang, Chaoqun Ma, Haokun Bai, Xing Chen, Mengmeng Li, Bingliang Zhuang, and Shu Li\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 21, 5847–5864, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-21-5847-2021,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-21-5847-2021, 2021\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nO3 has been increasing in recent years over the Yangtze River Delta region of China and is closely associated with dominant weather systems. Still, the study on the impact of changes in synoptic weather patterns (SWPs) on O3 variation is quite limited. This work aims to reveal the unique features of changes in each SWP under O3 variation and quantifies the effects of meteorological conditions on O3 variation. Our findings could be helpful in strategy planning for O3 pollution control.\n\nSeasonal patterns of atmospheric mercury in tropical South America as inferred by a continuous total gaseous mercury record at Chacaltaya station (5240 m) in Bolivia\n\nAlkuin Maximilian Koenig, Olivier Magand, Paolo Laj, Marcos Andrade, Isabel Moreno, Fernando Velarde, Grover Salvatierra, RenÃ© Gutierrez, Luis Blacutt, Diego Aliaga, Thomas Reichler, Karine Sellegri, Olivier Laurent, Michel Ramonet, and AurÃ©lien Dommergue\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 21, 3447–3472, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-21-3447-2021,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-21-3447-2021, 2021\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe environmental cycling of atmospheric mercury, a harmful global contaminant, is still not sufficiently constrained, partly due to missing data in remote regions. Here, we address this issue by presenting 20 months of atmospheric mercury measurements, sampled in the Bolivian Andes. We observe a significant seasonal pattern, whose key features we explore. Moreover, we deduce ratios to constrain South American biomass burning mercury emissions and the mercury uptake by the Amazon rainforest.\n\nA mass-weighted isentropic coordinate for mapping chemical tracers and computing atmospheric inventories\n\nYuming Jin, Ralph F. Keeling, Eric J. Morgan, Eric Ray, Nicholas C. Parazoo, and Britton B. Stephens\n\nAtmos. Chem.
