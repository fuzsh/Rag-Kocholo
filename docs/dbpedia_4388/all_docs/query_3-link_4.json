        "text": "Former Secretary General of the LegCo Secretariat Kenneth Chen Wei-on has been appointed as vice-president of the Chinese University of Hong Kong, according to sources.\n\nChen, who served in the Legco position for 12 years and retired last month, will be replacing Eric Ng Shu-pui. Ng was sacked by the CUHK Council in December last year.\n\nAccording to council chairman John Chai Yat-chiu, Ng had allegedly failed to observe political neutrality and bypassed him in relation to two incidents that irritated him and other council members.\n\nNg condemned the decision and denounced the council for not giving him a chance to appear before it to defend himself against the accusations.\n\nRead more: Reform resister sacked\n\nThe former Legco secretariat chief encountered controversial issues during the sixth term of the legislature, including the disqualification of six lawmakers - Sixtus Leung Chung-hang, Yau Wai-ching, Leung Kwok-hung, Nathan Law Kwun-chung, Edward Yiu Chung-yim and Lau Siu-lai - in 2016 after Chen declared some of their oaths invalid.\n\nIn 2019, Chen was under criticism by pro-democracy lawmakers for issuing a circular asking lawmakers to vote in writing whether they supported a move to replace Democrat James To Kun-sun with Abraham Shek Lai-him as the host of the bill committee on the extradition laws."
