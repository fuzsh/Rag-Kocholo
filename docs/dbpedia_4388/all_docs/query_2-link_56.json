        "text": "After just about a year in his new role as technology director at Batavia City Schools, Brian Sutton has left for a similar job at another district, and the city’s board has appointed a new director to fill the gap.\n\nThe board approved Wendy Villone to a four-year probationary position as director of educational technology during Monday’s meeting.\n\nShe is to begin Sept. 12, bringing with her more than two decades of experience in education and technology at the Caledonia-Mumford Central School District and at EduTech RIC - Wayne-Finger Lakes BOCES, a district press release states.\n\nVillone was hired at a prorated salary of $88,000, with her full salary to be $110,000, per negotiated collective bargaining agreement. She will fill the vacancy left by Sutton, who was formerly a principal at John Kennedy Intermediate since 2020 before taking on the technology role and charging ahead to deal with a state Comptroller’s audit in July of 2023.\n\nRight off the bat, Sutton was faced with key findings from the audit that he needed to address while aligning with the district’s Strategic Plan. He gave his first report of findings and suggested solutions to the board in October 2023.\n\nThe Batavian asked Superintendent Jason Smith about the circumstances of Sutton’s departure, and if Villone would continue with the work already completed to address the Comptroller’s audit.\n\nSutton left his position for a technology director position at Rush Henrietta School District, Smith said.\n\n“During his tenure with us, he successfully achieved several initiatives, including addressing both the Comptroller’s audit and the technology functional review,” Smith said Tuesday.\n\nSutton's first task was to review the existing structure and services offered through BOCES, including database management, the physical inventory process, technology leadership and how assets are identified and tagged.\n\nThen he had to reestablish a formal leadership in the technology department and implement a formal Technology Committee, with a data protection privacy officer and reviews of data privacy law to ensure that all requirements are being met, he had said during the presentation.\n\nHe had been working with Edutech to ensure that tags were provided on all “products” that come from them, which is a restructuring of Batavia’s inventory system and prices to ensure accountability for all hardware, he said, including district-owned devices, per board policy.\n\nHe was implementing a software program to track software inventory product purchases and related expiration dates. He had also been rearranging and organizing the physical workspace of the technology department and at the storage room at Robert Morris.\n\nAll of these tasks have been items to enforce the existing board policies on inventory control based on the Comptroller’s audit. Not only were hundreds of devices discovered missing from inventory, but the district had been paying their annual fees.\n\nStepping into his own role to provide technology leadership, Sutton is using the functional review audit as a roadmap to prioritize and address issues that were uncovered, he said.\n\nAs a result, he was having weekly technology department meetings with tech aides at the middle and high schools, providing guidance and support to the creation of the digital fluency class at the middle school, and re-establishing the district technology committee with a focus on staff development and learning, he said.\n\nSmith and the board feel confident that Villone will be up to the task at hand. At Caledonia-Mumford Central School District, she managed technology infrastructure, implemented instructional software, and oversaw data security compliance, and prior to that as coordinator of Data Governance she provided training and guidance on cybersecurity and data protection to 47 school districts, the release states.\n\nThe Batavian also asked Smith if he was concerned about a recent rash of departures of administrators, including several assistant principals, the athletic director and Sutton, at the district.\n\n“It's common and expected for assistant principals to transition to principal positions after a few years. For example, I served as an assistant principal for three years before becoming principal at Elba in 2004. Mr. Hussain, Mrs. Torrey, and Dr. McCarthy were all assistant principals at Batavia for approximately three years each, and they have successfully moved on to principal roles, and we are proud of their accomplishments,” Smith said. “As the largest district in the region with a substantial staff, Batavia typically experiences personnel changes during the summer months leading up to a new school year.\n\n\"I'm pleased to report that we've attracted a diverse and experienced pool of applicants, including current administrators from other districts, to fill our open positions,\" he said. \"We're excited to welcome our newest hires to BCSD. I'm confident they'll be a great fit within our community, and I'm encouraged by their enthusiasm, wealth of educational experience, and desire to make a positive impact here in Batavia.”\n\nIn today’s highly technological world, texting has replaced phone calls, emails are standard versus traditional mail delivery, and apps, such as Batavia City School District’s ParentSquare, are common tools used by parents and teachers.\n\nHowever, parent Bob Trombley says this app has been unproductive, ineffective, and downright illegal so far. He spoke to the school district's board on behalf of himself and fellow frustrated parents.\n\n“Although the Parent Square app and many others like it are a seemingly convenient way to communicate for some parents, students, and staff, for many others, it is incredibly difficult to use or to even log into, or receive any relevant information about a parent or a guardian's child. It may be no surprise to you that many class action lawsuits for various reasons have started across the country involving apps that schools decide to use as innovation platforms between parents and teachers and faculty,” Trombley said during the board’s meeting Monday. “Just a simple Google cursory search, you find many, many stories of (eavesdropping on conversations). Although you can say Parent Square does not do that, or we have been assured that they don't do that, you cannot, with a clear conscience, make that statement of fact that they do not do that; you would be speaking to something that you're not absolutely sure of to say that those things weren't happening.\n\n\"An even bigger problem here is that by insisting that parents use this app … you're forcing parent citizens to use only your method of communication,\" Trombley said. \"We don't know if it censors. We don't know if we have a guarantee that any grievances that we have will actually be accepted or make their way across the platform. We don't know if things are filtered out, as parents are saying. We just don't know; that's a massive problem.”\n\nBeyond it being a problem, it’s a violation of the First Amendment, the Americans with Disabilities Act and the 14th Amendment, he said. He wanted to know about those parents who don’t have a device to use an app, and those with a learning disability that might have difficulty using the app. Or those who cannot afford internet access or are “seriously challenged by technology or the ability to understand.”\n\n“You're operating under the authority of the state. You are abridging my privilege as a parent of freedom of speech to communicate the way I want, with staff, with faculty, with teachers,” he said. “You don't have that power. If you want to force faculty to communicate a certain way, you can do that, you pay them, you can't apply your policies to the public as a whole.\n\n“I, personally, have not been able to communicate with my students’ teacher via this app since its existence in the district; my children's mother has had the same issues. I have spoken with many parents. They all have the same problem. We get logged out. We can't get logged back in. Then we don't get all the information. We get a flood of information. No one knows what's going on,” he said. “And in my experience, when I have called the school directly and asked to speak with a teacher, I've been told, ‘No, you're not allowed to speak with the teacher; we do everything through the app.’ When I have requested paper forms, no, sorry, it has to go through the app. Everything is on the app. This is unacceptable.”\n\nHe added that some board members, “in an effort to show sympathy or empathy,” have shared with him that they have struggled with the app as well. He asked that something be done “right away” to fix this because every parent should have an opportunity to decide how to communicate with district faculty.\n\nSuperintendent Jason Smith wanted to clarify that the app was never meant to substitute other forms of communication.\n\n“Any time a parent calls, you will have the opportunity to speak with the teacher,” Smith said, as Trombley interjected that it hasn’t been his experience. “If that's the case, I'll look into that. But under no circumstances were parents meant to ever, you know, replace that phone call. So that's not the expectation. That's not our expectation. So just, for the record, if a parent calls and asks to speak with a teacher, you're always given an opportunity.”\n\nThe Batavian has asked for additional comments from Smith regarding the district’s policy about Parent Square and teachers' understanding of communication with parents.\n\nParentSquare, per its website, is a simple platform for communications between home and school. ParentSquare is designed for whole-school adoption and collaborative use by district administrators, principals, school administrators, teachers, staff, parent leaders and parents at preK-12 districts and schools. Users can share messages about school logistics and student classroom learning along with pictures and files, volunteer requests and class supply lists, calendars and directory information.\n\nParentSquare collects two types of information: personal information your school knowingly chooses to disclose that is collected on an individual basis, and website-use information collected on an aggregate basis as you and others browse its website. The following information is also provided on the app's website:\n\nBasic Information Your School Provides ParentSquare\n\nAdmin Role: We use name, ID, title, phone number, email address, address, group memberships, school memberships and district memberships from school-provided data.\n\nStaff Role: We use name, ID, title, phone number, email address, address, group memberships, school memberships and district memberships from school-provided data.\n\nTeacher Role: We use name, ID, title, phone number, email address, address, classes, section, group memberships, school memberships and district memberships from school-provided data.\n\nStudent Role: We use name, ID, address, gender, grade level, enrolled courses, other enrolled groups, extracurricular activities and family relationships from school-provided data. For schools using StudentSquare, this may include email addresses and phone numbers.\n\nParent/Guardian/Contact Role: We use name, relationship to the student, phone number, email address, address, communication language, group memberships, school memberships and district memberships from school-provided data. from school-provided data.\n\nEmergency-Only Contact Role (if applicable): We use name, phone number, email address and any emergency contact information from school-provided data.\n\nGuest/External Member Role: If provided, we use name, phone number, email address, address, group memberships, school memberships and district memberships from school-provided data.\n\nAdditional Contact Information Your School May Provide About Students\n\nThe School may also choose to provide additional student information such as their English language learning status, enrollment in free and reduced lunch programs, attendance records, lunch balances, bus routes, grades and assignments if the School is using the corresponding ParentSquare feature.\n\nSharing and Disclosure of Information\n\nParentSquare uses the data received from the School for the sole purpose of delivering products and services to the School. We do not rent, trade, or sell or otherwise distribute your information to any third parties and will only disclose information when allowed by FERPA and required a) by applicable laws or government orders or b) to maintain and operate our service or c) when authorized by the School.\n\nParentSquare may acquire information (including Personally Identifiable Information or “PII”) from the school SIS/SMS or other school systems, such as payroll systems, nutrition systems, fee systems, etc, through a School-requested integration.\n\nParentSquare provides links to external websites for purposes which are intended solely to support the school’s day-to-day operations. The School or its users may post links within ParentSquare or StudentSquare to external websites for which we have no control.\n\nAs a former teacher, Alexander graduate Mike Porter liked to investigate particular issues, including science fiction, the paranormal, and aliens, and it led him to questions about if the universe is so vast, \"where is everybody?\"\n\n“We should be seeing signs of everyone. And one of the hypotheses that is well known is what's called the great filter, which is civilizations will appear throughout the universe, but they don't last long because they succumb to various disasters, whether it's an asteroid impact or a pandemic or a nuclear war and things like that,” he said during an interview with The Batavian. “Being a social studies teacher talking about these types of issues with students, I think I kind of started thinking, 'geez, I really feel like humanity is coming to or is at a crossroads, where we can kind of come together, overcome our differences, and address some of these key issues. Inevitably, there's going to be a big rock that hits Earth at some point. Are we going to be prepared for that, the next big pandemic?”\n\nIt was that thinking and those questions, plus prior discussions with a colleague, that led him to write his first book, the science fiction thriller, “The Graveyard Relays.”\n\nWhile working as a teacher in Wyndham, Porter was drawn to a fellow teacher named Daniel with colorful stories of adventure, including one that included his dog and a bear. Daniel had a van that he lived and traveled in with his dog. The dog decided to chase the bear one day until it dawned on the bear that he was bigger and it was silly for him to be running away, so he turned around and began to chase the dog back toward Daniel’s van.\n\nIt made for an exhilarating story. The owner anxiously waited for the dog to get into the van so he could close the door safely behind both of them, leaving the bear outside.\n\nWhile that was a fun story, it served as the basis for Porter’s book, with the dog and bear as metaphors for space research: Porter began to see how pursuing life out in the universe could have the same potential effect.\n\n“I thought, how incredible, in terms of interstellar exploration; what if that were to happen with an interstellar probe where we go out exploring and then accidentally bring something back?” he said. “So it was all these things kind of together that gave me the idea for the premise of the book. I didn't really have experience with the writing realm, like writing classes. Never been in a competition, never really practiced, but I just had this kind of urge to start writing these ideas down and see if it came to anything.”\n\nPorter’s first book evolved in the way his off-grid home has: through a series of inspirations that pushed him on toward a final ending.\n\nJust as he and his wife Nicole went from having no electricity, running water or internet connection at their Salisbury Center house to an abode with all the amenities, the 40-year-old Bethany native fine-tuned his science fiction work, which he began in 2016, from an outline of intergalactic premises to a full-fledged collection of researched characters and planets, a plot and enough action to keep readers turning the 338 pages for a debut in June of this year.\n\nThroughout the process Porter was fueled by an undeniable passion for his favorite topic.\n\n“I think since I was a kid, I’m naturally drawn to it. I loved 'Star Wars' when I was a kid. I think my favorite movie is 'Interstellar.' And I’ve always been fascinated by aliens,” he said. “That’s another thing that I was actually concerned about. Since 2017 there’s been this growing disclosure movement, and I thought, ‘great, I’m writing this book about discovering alien life and it’s going to get blown out of the water because the government’s gonna say there are already aliens here.’ That hasn’t happened yet, but I think that time is probably coming.”\n\nHe’s not certain what that looks like, exactly, but he feels confident that something — of intelligence life form — is out there, or here, with us.\n\nAnd this book hinges on that belief that we aren’t alone.\n\n“One possibility is what has become known as the great filter,” he writes. “This theory postulates that civilizations universally succumb to various apocalyptic events before humanity has the opportunity to detect them. Perhaps there are untold numbers of alien graveyards that are just waiting to be found and exhumed.”\n\nThe Graveyard Relays is a 25th-century documentary series that finds and investigates extinct alien wastelands for education and entertainment. A team led by Marshall Holst, based in the Catskill Mountains, employs ASIP, an interstellar probe leased from the United Nations to cruise the cosmos searching for intelligent life.\n\nMeanwhile, Marshall likes to escape from the “technologically saturated world” and his own stressful occupation by backpacking into the woods of the Northeast with his dog Wadsworth. However, Porter suggests that, just as with the documentary series, there’s no telling what the pair might encounter in those woods, far from the safety of the interneural Net, a hyper-intelligent artificial intelligence.\n\n“There are risks and dangers inherent with exploration,” he writes. “In the same way, as he and his team continue to send ASIP to strange new worlds, there’s no telling what the probe might find … and what it might bring back.”\n\nMichael David Porter grew up in Bethany and graduated from Alexander High School in 2002. He was an athlete of sorts — playing for Batavia Ramparts hockey team from second through seventh grades before moving onto baseball, football, basketball and then track, winning sectionals as a senior.\n\nHe wasn’t particularly into writing, though did some acting in school — winning a Rochester Broadway Theater League Stars of Tomorrow honor for his role in “Oklahoma” and performing in a number of shows at Geneseo State College and Delaware Park. He moved south to Wyndham to become a teacher and also ended up doing a monthly radio show.\n\nSuffice it to say Porter has some creative chops. His parents, Dave Porter, who plays trombone in the Genesee Symphony Orchestra, and Jill, a retired nurse, still live in the Genesee County area, along with other family members, while Porter has since moved to his off-grid place in the summer of 2023.\n\nWhen he interviewed for his latest job as an instructional coach at the Hamilton Fulton Montgomery BOCES, Porter forewarned them that he might not be able to come right in on severe winter days. The local highway super helps out with plowing the homestead driveway, he said, but it could get harsh.\n\nWhy the move to such a modest existence? He and his wife are hikers and nature-lovers who, ironically met online, also like to disconnect from the online world, he said.\n\n“I think it’s important for people to disconnect from technology and get back to nature. People are meant to be active outdoors and studies show that mental and physical health can be improved significantly when people spend time outside,” Porter said, emphasizing a moral for his book. “People should stick together, put down their phones, and go outside.”\n\nHe made purposeful decisions about his book along the way, such as making people vegetarians (though he is not) and using androgynous names with no specific pronouns so that readers could fill in their own details for certain characters.\n\n“I envision a future that is international, you know, I think if we're going to get to this future where there's basically world peace, we're going to have to set aside a lot of our differences and learn to live together,” he said. “And I wanted to be inclusive in that way, so I looked up androgynous names from different nationalities and tried to put a lot of these people on the team, and I also, in my book, avoided using any pronouns for those people. (Readers) hadn't noticed that they didn't notice that I didn't use pronouns, which tells me that it's a very fluid, natural thing. And the great thing is the reader then has the freedom to apply and attribute whatever they want in terms of identity to these characters.”\n\nHe put the book on a shelf, so to speak, for a few years until he was hit with more inspiration. Then, “I hit it really hard three years ago.” That’s when he fleshed out those 56 chapters and scenarios.\n\nThe team has sent ASIP out into exploration and it encounters an unexpected obstacle.\n\nThe team watched from their workstations in horror, each individual feeling deep pangs of terror and guilt. “Yes sir,” ASIP replied. “Preparing to return to orbit.”\n\nWithout warning, Peace accelerated toward ASIP, having apparently transitioned to its jet turbines. The gray, conical beast was closing in fast. “ASIP, there’s no time, initiate your emergency return now!” Marshall yelled.\n\n“But Marshall, my software is being corrupted and the gravity wake could potentially —“\n\n“Now ASIP! Return to Earth now!”\n\nASIP engaged the gravity drive, and from within the Pool, Marshall saw the world go dark, but for a fraction of a second, the haunting image of Peace and ASIP alone together in the gravity bubble hung frozen in the air.\n\nAnother chapter describes a conversation between Marshall and his dog Wadsworth after a crisis occurs.\n\n“Come on Wads, get your things put together. We have to got a trip.”\n\n“A trip? But aren’t we going to have to …”\n\n“I’ll explain on the way, Wads. Grab your food and some toys and anything else you might need for a few days.”\n\nMarshall ran up the stairs to the bedroom to repack his bag with new clothes. He yawned at the sight of his bed as he considered a five-minute nap, but flashing thoughts of enslavement by an alien robot made him decide against it.\n\nBut Marshall, toys won’t be good for a camping trip, and I don’t think we should go camping right now.\n\n“We aren’t going camping. We’re going to the moon.”\n\nPorter hopes that readers give his genre a try and enjoy the stories woven through the book to an ending that he didn’t originally include until both his wife and mother said he needed one that was more conclusive. Though it’s science fiction, there are undoubtedly broader messages about society and a “sink or swim together” attitude.\n\n“The people that do read it, I hope they enjoy it and get something out of it, and maybe at least have some fun conversations for them, and a different way to think about the world,” he said.\n\nThe book is available on Amazon.com."
