We have found that the 3-D fibrous matrix has profound effects on cell spatial organization, morphology, and cell-cell contacts and interactions, which in turn affect cell proliferation, differentiation, and functions. Cells grown in the fibrous matrix maintained better long-term stability, as compared to those grown in T-flasks. For example, ovary luteal cells cultured in the 3-D matrix maintained their cellular function to secrete progesterone, while cells cultured in the 2-D static flask lost most of their response in the same culturing period.\n\nWe have also worked on tissue engineering of human cells for various biomedical applications. For example, an in vitro human placenta model system based on tissue engineering of human trophoblast cells may be developed for drug screening and toxicology studies. More recently, we have developed 3D cultures for high throughput screening of potential cancer drugs and embryotoxic chemicals using engineered stem and/or cancer cells expressing fluorescent proteins for real-time monitoring of cell responses.\n\nIt is important for agricultural and food industries to increase their product values through the uses of modern biotechnology and bioprocesses. Our work has been concentrated on the development of several novel bioprocesses for economical production of high-value products from food processing wastes and agricultural commodities. Our recent and ongoing research projects include fermentation of food processing wastes and plant biomass to produce various carboxylic acids (e.g., propionic, butryric, lactic, fumaric, and malic acids), alcohols (mainly n-butanol), and microbial polysaccharides and polymers, and immobilized enzyme for galactooligosaccharides (GOS) production. These bioprocesses are important to the agricultural/food processing industry and address important environmental issues. One example is the process we developed to convert whey permeate, a dairy waste, to calcium magnesium acetate (CMA) as an environmentally friendly, non-corrosive road deicers. Our propionic acid research has resulted in the development of an industrial process for the production of calcium propionate as a natural food preservative widely used in bakery products.\n\nWe take an integrated approach to solve an important bioprocess engineering problem: a patented fibrous-bed bioreactor is developed to increase productivity and cell tolerance to a high-concentration of inhibitory metabolites; membrane separation and solvent extraction are used to separate and concentrate fermentation products; and genetic and metabolic engineering of production cells are used to further improve product yields and process efficiency. Our technologies also have applications in the environmental area, such as biofiltration of VOC and biodegradation of hazardous chemicals in industrial waste streams and contaminated groundwater.\n\nIn recent years, we have developed several metabolically-engineered strains of clostridia for n-butanol production from lignocellulosic biomass and CO2, which can lower biobutanol production cost and reduce green house gas emissions by more than 50% compared to existing technologies. An economical production process for green biofuels from renewable biomass and industrial waste gas (carbon dioxide) is sustainable and will benefit the biorefinery industry and society.\n\nNovel bioprocesses for value-added products from lignocellulosic biomass and carbon dioxide\n\nCell and metabolic engineering of clostridia and black yeast for enhanced production of chemicals and biofuels\n\nNovel bioreactors for fermentation and cell and tissue cultures\n\nIn vitro expansion and differentiation of embryonic stem cells\n\nMicrobioreactors and microfluidic biochips for biodiagnostics\n\nHigh-throughput screening for cancer drug discovery and embryotoxicity assessment.\n\nRecent and Current Research Funding\n\n“Engineering Clostridia for n-butanol production from lignocellulosic biomass and CO2” Department of Energy EERE - BTI - $1,232,148, 10/1/2015–9/30/2018\n\n“An integrated process for butanol production from cellulosic biomass and CO2 using engineered clostridia in a linear immobilized bioreactor” Department of Energy SBIR Phase I Bio-Missions subaward - $150,000, 7/2/2018–7/1/2019\n\n“Metabolic and process engineering of black yeast for poly(L-malic acid) and malic acid production” USDA AFRI, $450,000, 6/1/2020–5/31/2023\n\n“A Novel Integrated Fermentation Process with Engineered Microbial Consortia for Butanol Production from Lignocellulose Sugars without CO2 Emission” Department of Energy ARPA-E, $1,611,940, 7/1/2021–6/30/2023\n\nBack to top\n\nBack to top\n\ndouble-arrow Publications\n\nS.T.
