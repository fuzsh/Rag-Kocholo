        "text": "(Photo: Zhang Ling from Nanfang Daily)\n\nRepresentatives from government departments, public organizations, and universities gathered with entrepreneurs from Shenzhen and Hong Kong at the Hetao Innovation Center yesterday to discuss the current attractiveness and future development of the Hetao Shenzhen-Hong Kong Science and Technology Innovation Cooperation Zone.\n\nThe event, held to commemorate the first anniversary of a plan released by the State Council for the Shenzhen Park of the zone, sought to promote scientific and technological exchanges as well as cooperation between Shenzhen and Hong Kong.\n\nZeng Jianpeng, director-general of the Hetao Development Authority, stated that since the plan was released, significant achievements have been made in institutional innovation, spatial construction, industrial development, and supporting services. As a result, Shenzhen and Hong Kong’s cooperation on scientific and technological innovation has reached a new level.\n\nInstitutional innovations in the Hetao Shenzhen Park have achieved remarkable results in just one year. The implementation of the preferential tax policy has significantly reduced taxes for Hong Kong enterprises and employees. Zeng mentioned that the Hetao Shenzhen Park has established 13 specialized parks, offering around 1 million square meters of space for scientific research. Additionally, the park provides convenient services for tech personnel commuting between Shenzhen and Hong Kong.\n\n“Many scientific research projects from Hong Kong Baptist University have been transformed into products in the Hetao cooperation zone, which demonstrates the great potential for cooperation between Hong Kong and the mainland. The technologies and talent from the mainland and Hong Kong complement each other,” said Dr. Ken Yeung, director of the Technology Translation Institute for Innovation, Translation, and Policy Research of Hong Kong Baptist University.\n\nProf. Yin Xiaobo, associate vice president of the University of Hong Kong, said that Hetao is a hub for exceptional talent and will provide solid support for its future scientific research platform. The university is planning to build a scientific research center dedicated to original innovation in the Hetao cooperation zone and expand its biomedicine and semiconductor research. “We anticipate rapid development in Hetao as we prepare for the construction of scientific platforms, making it our target location,” Yin said.\n\nDuring the event, the Foreigner’s Work Permit Service Station of the Hetao Cooperation Zone was inaugurated. In a roundtable forum, experts, scholars, and business representatives from various fields exchanged ideas and engaged in discussions about the future development of Hetao."
