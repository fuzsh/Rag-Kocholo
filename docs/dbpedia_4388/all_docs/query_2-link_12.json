        "text": "Abstract\n\nHistological brain slices are widely used in neuroscience to study the anatomical organization of neural circuits. Systematic and accurate comparisons of anatomical data from multiple brains, especially from different studies, can benefit tremendously from registering histological slices onto a common reference atlas. Most existing methods rely on an initial reconstruction of the volume before registering it to a reference atlas. Because these slices are prone to distortions during the sectioning process and often sectioned with non-standard angles, reconstruction is challenging and often inaccurate. Here we describe a framework that maps each slice to its corresponding plane in the Allen Mouse Brain Atlas (2015) to build a plane-wise mapping and then perform 2D nonrigid registration to build a pixel-wise mapping. We use the L2 norm of the histogram of oriented gradients difference of two patches as the similarity metric for both steps and a Markov random field formulation that incorporates tissue coherency to compute the nonrigid registration. To fix significantly distorted regions that are misshaped or much smaller than the control grids, we train a context-aggregation network to segment and warp them to their corresponding regions with thin plate spline. We have shown that our method generates results comparable to an expert neuroscientist and is significantly better than reconstruction-first approaches. Code and sample dataset are available at sites.google.com/view/brain-mapping.\n\nView details for DOI 10.3389/fninf.2018.00093\n\nView details for PubMedID 30618698\n\nView details for PubMedCentralID PMC6297281\n\nAbstract\n\nThe dorsal raphe (DR) constitutes a major serotonergic input to the forebrain and modulates diverse functions and brain states, including mood, anxiety, and sensory and motor functions. Most functional studies to date have treated DR serotonin neurons as a single population. Using viral-genetic methods, we found that subcortical- and cortical-projecting serotonin neurons have distinct cell-body distributions within the DR and differentially co-express a vesicular glutamate transporter. Further, amygdala- and frontal-cortex-projecting DR serotonin neurons have largely complementary whole-brain collateralization patterns, receive biased inputs from presynaptic partners, and exhibit opposite responses to aversive stimuli. Gain- and loss-of-function experiments suggest that amygdala-projecting DR serotonin neurons promote anxiety-like behavior, whereas frontal-cortex-projecting neurons promote active coping in the face of challenge. These results provide compelling evidence that the DR serotonin system contains parallel sub-systems that differ in input and output connectivity, physiological response properties, and behavioral functions.\n\nView details for PubMedID 30146164\n\nAbstract\n\nWe present a method for image registration based on 3D scale- and rotation-invariant keypoints. The method extends the scale invariant feature transform (SIFT) to arbitrary dimensions by making key modifications to orientation assignment and gradient histograms. Rotation invariance is proven mathematically. Additional modifications are made to extrema detection and keypoint matching based on the demands of image registration. Our experiments suggest that the choice of neighborhood in discrete extrema detection has a strong impact on image registration accuracy. In head MR images, the brain is registered to a labeled atlas with an average Dice coefficient of 92%, outperforming registration from mutual information as well as an existing 3D SIFT implementation. In abdominal CT images, the spine is registered with an average error of 4.82 mm. Furthermore, keypoints are matched with high precision in simulated head MR images exhibiting lesions from multiple sclerosis. These results were achieved using only affine transforms, and with no change in parameters across a wide variety of medical images. This paper is freely available as a cross-platform software library.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1109/TIP.2017.2722689\n\nView details for Web of Science ID 000406329500024\n\nView details for PubMedID 28682256\n\nView details for PubMedCentralID PMC5581541\n\nAbstract\n\nElectrowetting-on-dielectric (EWD) digital microfluidic laboratory-on-a-chip platforms demonstrate excellent performance in automating labor-intensive protocols. When coupled with an on-chip electroporation capability, these systems hold promise for streamlining cumbersome processes such as multiplex automated genome engineering (MAGE). We integrated a single Ti:Au electroporation electrode into an otherwise standard parallel-plate EWD geometry to enable high-efficiency transformation of Escherichia coli with reporter plasmid DNA in a 200 nL droplet. Test devices exhibited robust operation with more than 10 transformation experiments performed per device without cross-contamination or failure. Despite intrinsic electric-field nonuniformity present in the EP/EWD device, the peak on-chip transformation efficiency was measured to be 8.6 ± 1.0 × 108 cfu·μg-1 for an average applied electric field strength of 2.25 ± 0.50 kV·mm-1. Cell survival and transformation fractions at this electroporation pulse strength were found to be 1.5 ± 0.3 and 2.3 ± 0.1%, respectively. Our work expands the EWD toolkit to include on-chip microbial electroporation and opens the possibility of scaling advanced genome engineering methods, like MAGE, into the submicroliter regime.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1021/acssynbio.7b00007\n\nView details for PubMedID 28569062\n\nAbstract\n\nThe function of the brain is unlikely to be understood without an accurate description of its output, yet the nature of movement elements and their organization remains an open problem. Here, movement elements are identified from dynamics of walking in flies, using unbiased criteria. On one time scale, dynamics of walking are consistent over hundreds of milliseconds, allowing elementary features to be defined. Over longer periods, walking is well described by a stochastic process composed of these elementary features, and a generative model of this process reproduces individual behavior sequences accurately over seconds or longer. Within elementary features, velocities diverge, suggesting that dynamical stability of movement elements is a weak behavioral constraint. Rather, long-term instability can be limited by the finite memory between these elementary features. This structure suggests how complex dynamics may arise in biological systems from elements whose combination need not be tuned for dynamic stability.\n\nView details for PubMedID 28742018\n\nAbstract\n\nMetagenomics and single-cell genomics have enabled genome discovery from unknown branches of life. However, extracting novel genomes from complex mixtures of metagenomic data can still be challenging and represents an ill-posed problem which is generally approached with ad hoc methods. Here we present a microfluidic-based mini-metagenomic method which offers a statistically rigorous approach to extract novel microbial genomes while preserving single-cell resolution. We used this approach to analyze two hot spring samples from Yellowstone National Park and extracted 29 new genomes, including three deeply branching lineages. The single-cell resolution enabled accurate quantification of genome function and abundance, down to 1% in relative abundance. Our analyses of genome level SNP distributions also revealed low to moderate environmental selection. The scale, resolution, and statistical power of microfluidic-based mini-metagenomics make it a powerful tool to dissect the genomic structure of microbial communities while effectively preserving the fundamental unit of biology, the single cell.\n\nView details for PubMedID 28678007\n\nAbstract\n\nAbnormal axonal transport is associated with neuronal disease. We identified a role for DHC-1, the C. elegans dynein heavy chain, in maintaining neuronal cargo distribution. Surprisingly, this does not involve dynein's role as a retrograde motor in cargo transport, hinging instead on its ability to inhibit microtubule (MT) dynamics. Neuronal MTs are highly static, yet the mechanisms and functional significance of this property are not well understood. In disease-mimicking dhc-1 alleles, excessive MT growth and collapse occur at the dendrite tip, resulting in the formation of aberrant MT loops. These unstable MTs act as cargo traps, leading to ectopic accumulations of cargo and reduced availability of cargo at normal locations. Our data suggest that an anchored dynein pool interacts with plus-end-out MTs to stabilize MTs and allow efficient retrograde transport. These results identify functional significance for neuronal MT stability and suggest a mechanism for cellular dysfunction in dynein-linked disease.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1038/ncomms15063\n\nView details for Web of Science ID 000399053800001\n\nView details for PubMedID 28406181\n\nAbstract\n\nCyanobacteria are important agents in global carbon and nitrogen cycling and hold great promise for biotechnological applications. Model organisms such as Synechocystis sp. and Synechococcus sp. have advanced our understanding of photosynthetic capacity and circadian behavior, mostly using population-level measurements in which the behavior of individuals cannot be monitored. Synechocystis sp. cells are small and divide slowly, requiring long-term experiments to track single cells. Thus, the cumulative effects of drift over long periods can cause difficulties in monitoring and quantifying cell growth and division dynamics.To overcome this challenge, we enhanced a microfluidic cell-culture device and developed an image analysis pipeline for robust lineage reconstruction. This allowed simultaneous tracking of many cells over multiple generations, and revealed that cells expand exponentially throughout their cell cycle. Generation times were highly correlated for sister cells, but not between mother and daughter cells. Relationships between birth size, division size, and generation time indicated that cell-size control was inconsistent with the \"sizer\" rule, where division timing is based on cell size, or the \"timer\" rule, where division occurs after a fixed time interval. Instead, single cell growth statistics were most consistent with the \"adder\" rule, in which division occurs after a constant increment in cell volume. Cells exposed to light-dark cycles exhibited growth and division only during the light period; dark phases pause but do not disrupt cell-cycle control.Our analyses revealed that the \"adder\" model can explain both the growth-related statistics of single Synechocystis cells and the correlation between sister cell generation times. We also observed rapid phenotypic response to light-dark transitions at the single cell level, highlighting the critical role of light in cyanobacterial cell-cycle control. Our findings suggest that by monitoring the growth kinetics of individual cells we can build testable models of circadian control of the cell cycle in cyanobacteria.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1186/s12915-016-0344-4\n\nView details for Web of Science ID 000394057800001\n\nView details for PubMedID 28196492\n\nAbstract\n\nAxonal microtubule (MT) arrays are the major cytoskeleton substrate for cargo transport. How MT organization, i.e., polymer length, number, and minus-end spacing, is regulated and how it impinges on axonal transport are unclear. We describe a method for analyzing neuronal MT organization using light microscopy. This method circumvents the need for electron microscopy reconstructions and is compatible with live imaging of cargo transport and MT dynamics. Examination of a C. elegans motor neuron revealed how age, MT-associated proteins, and signaling pathways control MT length, minus-end spacing, and coverage. In turn, MT organization determines axonal transport progression: cargoes pause at polymer termini, suggesting that switching MT tracks is rate limiting for efficient transport. Cargo run length is set by MT length, and higher MT coverage correlates with shorter pauses. These results uncover the principles and mechanisms of neuronal MT organization and its regulation of axonal cargo transport.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1016/j.neuron.2016.09.036\n\nView details for PubMedID 27764672\n\nAbstract\n\nLight field microscopy has been proposed as a new high-speed volumetric computational imaging method that enables reconstruction of 3-D volumes from captured projections of the 4-D light field. Recently, a detailed physical optics model of the light field microscope has been derived, which led to the development of a deconvolution algorithm that reconstructs 3-D volumes with high spatial resolution. However, the spatial resolution of the reconstructions has been shown to be non-uniform across depth, with some z planes showing high resolution and others, particularly at the center of the imaged volume, showing very low resolution. In this paper, we enhance the performance of the light field microscope using wavefront coding techniques. By including phase masks in the optical path of the microscope we are able to address this non-uniform resolution limitation. We have also found that superior control over the performance of the light field microscope can be achieved by using two phase masks rather than one, placed at the objective's back focal plane and at the microscope's native image plane. We present an extended optical model for our wavefront coded light field microscope and develop a performance metric based on Fisher information, which we use to choose adequate phase masks parameters. We validate our approach using both simulated data and experimental resolution measurements of a USAF 1951 resolution target; and demonstrate the utility for biological applications with in vivo volumetric calcium imaging of larval zebrafish brain.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1364/OE.22.024817\n\nView details for Web of Science ID 000342757000104\n\nView details for PubMedCentralID PMC4247191\n\nAbstract\n\nEarly stages of visual processing must capture complex, dynamic inputs. While peripheral neurons often implement efficient encoding by exploiting natural stimulus statistics, downstream neurons are specialized to extract behaviorally relevant features. How do these specializations arise? We use two-photon imaging in Drosophila to characterize a first-order interneuron, L2, that provides input to a pathway specialized for detecting moving dark edges. GABAergic interactions, mediated in part presynaptically, create an antagonistic and anisotropic center-surround receptive field. This receptive field is spatiotemporally coupled, applying differential temporal processing to large and small dark objects, achieving significant specialization. GABAergic circuits also mediate OFF responses and balance these with responses to ON stimuli. Remarkably, the functional properties of L2 are strikingly similar to those of bipolar cells, yet emerge through different molecular and circuit mechanisms. Thus, evolution appears to have converged on a common strategy for processing visual information at the first synapse.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1016/j.neuron.2013.04.024\n\nView details for Web of Science ID 000321026900013\n\nView details for PubMedID 23791198\n\nView details for PubMedCentralID PMC3694283\n\nAbstract\n\nMultilayer microfluidics based on PDMS (polydimethylsiloxane) soft lithography have offered parallelism and integration for biological and chemical sciences, where reduction in reaction volume and consistency of controlled variables across experiments translate into reduced cost, increased quantity and quality of data. One issue with push up or push down microfluidic control concept is the inability to provide multiple control pressures without adding more complex and expensive external pressure controls. We present here a microfluidic serial DAC (Digital to Analog Converter) that can be integrated with any PDMS device to expand the device's functionality by effectively adding an on-chip pressure regulator. The microfluidic serial DAC can be used with any incompressible fluids and operates in a similar fashion compared to an electronic serial DAC. It can be easily incorporated into any existing multilayer microfluidic devices, and the output pressure that the device generates could be held for extensive times. We explore in this paper various factors that affect resolution, speed, and linearity of the DAC output. As an application, we demonstrate microfluidic DAC's ability for on-chip manipulation of flow resistance when integrated with a simple flow network. In addition, we illustrate an added advantage of using the microfluidic serial DAC in preventing back flow and possible contamination.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1039/c3lc41394b\n\nView details for Web of Science ID 000317937300011\n\nView details for PubMedID 23529280\n\nAbstract\n\nTo cope with poor quality in cryo-electron tomography images, electron-dense markers, such as colloidal goldbeads, are often used to assist image registration and analysis algorithms. However, these markers can create artifacts that occlude a specimen due to their high contrast, which can also cause failure of some image processing algorithms. One way of reducing these artifacts is to replace high contrast objects with pixel densities that blend into the surroundings in the projection domain before volume reconstruction. In this paper, we propose digital inpainting via compressed sensing (CS) as a new method to achieve this goal. We show that cryo-ET projections are sparse in the discrete cosine transform (DCT) domain, and, by finding the sparsest DCT domain decompositions given uncorrupted pixels, we can fill in the missing pixel values that are occluded by high contrast objects without discontinuities. Our method reduces visual artifacts both in projections and in tomograms better than conventional algorithms, such as polynomial interpolation and random noise inpainting.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1016/j.jsb.2012.01.003\n\nView details for Web of Science ID 000304287400006\n\nView details for PubMedID 22248454\n\nAbstract\n\nMany animals rely on visual motion detection for survival. Motion information is extracted from spatiotemporal intensity patterns on the retina, a paradigmatic neural computation. A phenomenological model, the Hassenstein-Reichardt correlator (HRC), relates visual inputs to neural activity and behavioral responses to motion, but the circuits that implement this computation remain unknown. By using cell-type specific genetic silencing, minimal motion stimuli, and in vivo calcium imaging, we examine two critical HRC inputs. These two pathways respond preferentially to light and dark moving edges. We demonstrate that these pathways perform overlapping but complementary subsets of the computations underlying the HRC. A numerical model implementing differential weighting of these operations displays the observed edge preferences. Intriguingly, these pathways are distinguished by their sensitivities to a stimulus correlation that corresponds to an illusory percept, \"reverse phi,\" that affects many species. Thus, this computational architecture may be widely used to achieve edge selectivity in motion detection.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1016/j.neuron.2011.05.023\n\nView details for Web of Science ID 000292410700014\n\nView details for PubMedID 21689602\n\nView details for PubMedCentralID PMC3121538\n\nAbstract\n\nIn the mouse, each class of olfactory receptor neurons expressing a given odorant receptor has convergent axonal projections to two specific glomeruli in the olfactory bulb, thereby creating an odour map. However, it is unclear how this map is represented in the olfactory cortex. Here we combine rabies-virus-dependent retrograde mono-trans-synaptic labelling with genetics to control the location, number and type of 'starter' cortical neurons, from which we trace their presynaptic neurons. We find that individual cortical neurons receive input from multiple mitral cells representing broadly distributed glomeruli. Different cortical areas represent the olfactory bulb input differently. For example, the cortical amygdala preferentially receives dorsal olfactory bulb input, whereas the piriform cortex samples the whole olfactory bulb without obvious bias. These differences probably reflect different functions of these cortical areas in mediating innate odour preference or associative memory. The trans-synaptic labelling method described here should be widely applicable to mapping connections throughout the mouse nervous system.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1038/nature09714\n\nView details for Web of Science ID 000289469100036\n\nView details for PubMedID 21179085\n\nView details for PubMedCentralID PMC3073090\n\nAbstract\n\nA 1 mm(3) resolution clinical positron emission tomography (PET) system employing 4608 position-sensitive avalanche photodiodes (PSAPDs) is under development.

The multiplexing scheme was validated using a simulation framework that models the PSAPDs and front-end multiplexing circuits to predict the signal-to-noise ratio and flood histogram performance. Two independent experimental setups measured the energy resolution, time resolution, crystal identification ability and count rate both with and without multiplexing. With multiplexing, there was no significant degradation in energy resolution, time resolution and count rate. There was a relative 6.9 ± 1.0% and 9.4 ± 1.0% degradation in the figure of merit that characterizes the crystal identification ability observed in the measured and simulated ceramic-mounted PSAPD module flood histograms, respectively.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1088/0031-9155/55/23/001\n\nView details for Web of Science ID 000284261000015\n\nView details for PubMedID 21081831\n\nAbstract\n\nThe surface layers (S layers) of those bacteria and archaea that elaborate these crystalline structures have been studied for 40 years. However, most structural analysis has been based on electron microscopy of negatively stained S-layer fragments separated from cells, which can introduce staining artifacts and allow rearrangement of structures prone to self-assemble. We present a quantitative analysis of the structure and organization of the S layer on intact growing cells of the Gram-negative bacterium Caulobacter crescentus using cryo-electron tomography (CET) and statistical image processing. Instead of the expected long-range order, we observed different regions with hexagonally organized subunits exhibiting short-range order and a broad distribution of periodicities. Also, areas of stacked double layers were found, and these increased in extent when the S-layer protein (RsaA) expression level was elevated by addition of multiple rsaA copies. Finally, we combined high-resolution amino acid residue-specific Nanogold labeling and subtomogram averaging of CET volumes to improve our understanding of the correlation between the linear protein sequence and the structure at the 2-nm level of resolution that is presently available. The results support the view that the U-shaped RsaA monomer predicted from negative-stain tomography proceeds from the N terminus at one vertex, corresponding to the axis of 3-fold symmetry, to the C terminus at the opposite vertex, which forms the prominent 6-fold symmetry axis. Such information will help future efforts to analyze subunit interactions and guide selection of internal sites for display of heterologous protein segments.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1128/JB.00747-10\n\nView details for Web of Science ID 000283559300001\n\nView details for PubMedID 20833802\n\nView details for PubMedCentralID PMC2976456\n\nAbstract\n\nIn the past few years, three-dimensional (3D) subtomogram alignment has become an important tool in cryo-electron tomography (CET). This technique allows one to produce higher resolution images of structures which can not be reconstructed using single-particle methods. Building on previous work, we present a new dissimilarity measure between subtomograms that works well for the noisy images that often occur in CET images. A technique that is more robust to noise provides the ability to analyze macromolecules in thicker samples such as whole cells or lower the defocus in thinner samples to push the first zero of the Contrast Transfer Function (CTF). Our method, Threshold Constrained Cross-Correlation (TCCC), uses statistics of the noise to automatically select only a small percentage of the Fourier coefficients to compute the cross-correlation, which has two main advantages: first, it reduces the influence of the noise by looking at only those peaks dominated by signal; and second, it avoids the missing wedge normalization problem since we consider the same number of coefficients for all possible pairs of subtomograms. We present results with synthetic and real data to compare our approach with other existing methods under different SNR and missing wedge conditions, and show that TCCC improves alignment results for datasets with SNR<0.1. We have made our source code freely available for the community.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1016/j.jsb.2010.05.013\n\nView details for Web of Science ID 000280680100010\n\nView details for PubMedID 20621702\n\nAbstract\n\nCryogenic electron tomography (cryo-ET) has gained increasing interest in recent years due to its ability to image whole cells and subcellular structures in 3D at nanometer resolution in their native environment. However, due to dose restrictions and the inability to acquire high tilt angle images, the reconstructed volumes are noisy and have missing information. Thus, features are unreliable, and precision extraction of the cell boundary is difficult, manual and time intensive. This paper presents an efficient recursive algorithm called BLASTED (Boundary Localization using Adaptive Shape and Texture Discovery) to automatically extract the cell boundary using a conditional random field (CRF) framework in which boundary points and shape are jointly inferred. The algorithm learns the texture of the boundary region progressively, and uses a global shape model and shape-dependent features to propose candidate boundary points on a slice of the membrane. It then updates the shape of that slice by accepting the appropriate candidate points using local spatial clustering, the global shape model, and trained boosted texture classifiers. The BLASTED algorithm segmented the cell membrane over an average of 93% of the length of the cell in 19 difficult cryo-ET datasets.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1016/j.jsb.2009.12.015\n\nView details for Web of Science ID 000276329600016\n\nView details for PubMedID 20035877\n\nAbstract\n\nRobustness of biological models has emerged as an important principle in systems biology. Many past analyses of Boolean models update all pending changes in signals simultaneously (i.e., synchronously), making it impossible to consider robustness to variations in timing that result from noise and different environmental conditions. We checked previously published mathematical models of the cell cycles of budding and fission yeast for robustness to timing variations by constructing Boolean models and analyzing them using model-checking software for the property of speed independence. Surprisingly, the models are nearly, but not totally, speed-independent. In some cases, examination of timing problems discovered in the analysis exposes apparent inaccuracies in the model. Biologically justified revisions to the model eliminate the timing problems. Furthermore, in silico random mutations in the regulatory interactions of a speed-independent Boolean model are shown to be unlikely to preserve speed independence, even in models that are otherwise functional, providing evidence for selection pressure to maintain timing robustness. Multiple cell cycle models exhibit strong robustness to timing variation, apparently due to evolutionary pressure. Thus, timing robustness can be a basis for generating testable hypotheses and can focus attention on aspects of a model that may need refinement.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1371/journal.pone.0008906\n\nView details for Web of Science ID 000274209700002\n\nView details for PubMedID 20126540\n\nView details for PubMedCentralID PMC2813865\n\nAbstract\n\nData acquisition of cryo-electron tomography (CET) samples described in previous chapters involves relatively imprecise mechanical motions: the tilt series has shifts, rotations, and several other distortions between projections. Alignment is the procedure of correcting for these effects in each image and requires the estimation of a projection model that describes how points from the sample in three-dimensions are projected to generate two-dimensional images. This estimation is enabled by finding corresponding common features between images. This chapter reviews several software packages that perform alignment and reconstruction tasks completely automatically (or with minimal user intervention) in two main scenarios: using gold fiducial markers as high contrast features or using relevant biological structures present in the image (marker-free). In particular, we emphasize the key decision points in the process that users should focus on in order to obtain high-resolution reconstructions.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1016/S0076-6879(10)82014-2\n\nView details for Web of Science ID 000283462200013\n\nView details for PubMedID 20888968\n\nAbstract\n\nA closed-loop control system drives progression of the coupled stalked and swarmer cell cycles of the bacterium Caulobacter crescentus in a near-mechanical step-like fashion. The cell-cycle control has a cyclical genetic circuit composed of four regulatory proteins with tight coupling to processive chromosome replication and cell division subsystems. We report a hybrid simulation of the coupled cell-cycle control system, including asymmetric cell division and responses to external starvation signals, that replicates mRNA and protein concentration patterns and is consistent with observed mutant phenotypes. An asynchronous sequential digital circuit model equivalent to the validated simulation model was created. Formal model-checking analysis of the digital circuit showed that the cell-cycle control is robust to intrinsic stochastic variations in reaction rates and nutrient supply, and that it reliably stops and restarts to accommodate nutrient starvation. Model checking also showed that mechanisms involving methylation-state changes in regulatory promoter regions during DNA replication increase the robustness of the cell-cycle control. The hybrid cell-cycle simulation implementation is inherently extensible and provides a promising approach for development of whole-cell behavioral models that can replicate the observed functionality of the cell and its responses to changing environmental conditions.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1073/pnas.0805258105\n\nView details for Web of Science ID 000258560700056\n\nView details for PubMedID 18685108\n\nView details for PubMedCentralID PMC2516238\n\nAbstract\n\nWe present a method for automatic full-precision alignment of the images in a tomographic tilt series. Full-precision automatic alignment of cryo electron microscopy images has remained a difficult challenge to date, due to the limited electron dose and low image contrast. These facts lead to poor signal to noise ratio (SNR) in the images, which causes automatic feature trackers to generate errors, even with high contrast gold particles as fiducial features. To enable fully automatic alignment for full-precision reconstructions, we frame the problem probabilistically as finding the most likely particle tracks given a set of noisy images, using contextual information to make the solution more robust to the noise in each image. To solve this maximum likelihood problem, we use Markov Random Fields (MRF) to establish the correspondence of features in alignment and robust optimization for projection model estimation. The resulting algorithm, called Robust Alignment and Projection Estimation for Tomographic Reconstruction, or RAPTOR, has not needed any manual intervention for the difficult datasets we have tried, and has provided sub-pixel alignment that is as good as the manual approach by an expert user. We are able to automatically map complete and partial marker trajectories and thus obtain highly accurate image alignment. Our method has been applied to challenging cryo electron tomographic datasets with low SNR from intact bacterial cells, as well as several plastic section and X-ray datasets.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1016/j.jsb.2007.07.007\n\nView details for Web of Science ID 000254349100006\n\nView details for PubMedID 17855124\n\nAbstract\n\nAdaptive optics is used to compensate for modal dispersion in digital transmission through multimode fiber (MMF). At the transmitter, a spatial light modulator (SLM) controls the launched field pattern. An estimate of intersymbol interference (ISI) caused by modal dispersion is formed at the receiver and fed back to the transmitter, where the SLM is adjusted to minimize ISI. Error-free transmission of 10 Gbit/s non-return-to-zero signals through standard 50 microm graded-index MMFs up to 11.1 km long is demonstrated. It is shown that a single SLM can compensate for modal dispersion across a 600 GHz bandwidth.\n\nView details for Web of Science ID 000233258800005\n\nView details for PubMedID 16315696"
