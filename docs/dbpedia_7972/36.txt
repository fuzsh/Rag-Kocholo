Stacey, please tell us a little about you?

Certainly, I‚Äôm originally from the UK, London England‚Ä¶ I also spent time in Lincoln Nebraska which is quite the contrast! That is where my dad is from, spending the majority of my youth as a competitive Ice skater as well as actress and model. I currently live in Los Angeles California and I must say I‚Äôm loving it.

Describe yourself in 3 words?

Loving, motivated and kind.

Who has been the biggest influence on your life?

Coming from a working-class family my parents were always my greatest influence and whom created my desire to succeed in life as a way to provide and repay my family for all the sacrifices they made helping me pursue my dreams as a child.

How and when did you start into modeling?

I was discovered at three years old and cast in my first film! Many TV commercials and print jobs followed. When you‚Äôre that young people assume you‚Äôve been pushed into it but believe it or not I have clear memories even at that age of wanting to play dress up and make-believe in front of an audience.I‚Äôm a Leo I was born a ham!

What keeps you motivated to keep training hard and eating right?

I try and remind myself daily that my body is a temple and to treat it as such! It‚Äôs the only one I‚Äôve got‚Ä¶being a child athlete, discipline and exercise/fitness was all I knew and to this day it is very much ingrained in me to take care of myself and maintain a high level of fitness and nutrition. But I‚Äôm not nearly as strict as a lot of fitness enthusiasts I‚Äôm not gluten-free or sugar-free or anything like that but I do try my best to balance my indulgencies with daily wheatgrass shots and nightly organic kale spinach Cayanne pepper celery juice concoctions! And I don‚Äôt eat red meat.

What is the biggest highlight of your career so far?

There have been many in different ways but working along side the legendary Chuck Woolery as his cohost for many years on the number one rated game show ‚Äúlingo‚Äù rates right up there! It was years ago now, but to this day I continue to get fans of the show reaching out to me from all over the world due to the fact the show still runs today!

What is your workout routine these days?

I work out seven days a week it‚Äôs just the way I choose to start my day. sometimes with my schedule filming I have to do it at 4 AM but I will do it anytime as long as I fit in!

I‚Äôm an avid runner, a minimum of 4 to 5 miles a day‚Ä¶ I also love hiking, pilates and swimming during the Summer season.

What is your favorite healthy food?

Well I can‚Äôt do without wheat grass I have that every morning for breakfast with an organic banana and I love kale salads. I incorporate a lot of fish also. I really like seafood.

And your favorite cheat food?

Probably sounds typical but I never met a cheese pizza I didn‚Äôt love LOL and yes chocolate knows the way to my heart. Milk chocolate that is!

What magazines have you been in over the course of your career?

I‚Äôm lucky enough to say at this point I think I have lost count! (Maxim, FHM,stuff, Playboy non-nude feature, KANDY, Sports Illustrated etc.)

In five years from now, where do you see yourself and your career?

I like to try and live in the moment so I don‚Äôt miss out on it but I definitely see myself continuing to do what I do now and that is what I love.

Now tell us about your acting career?

As I mentioned I actually did my first film at the age of three and I have continued to work quite steadily as an actress although I think it at this point I actually prefer TV presenting/hosting and modeling as that generally allows me to work mostly in Los Angeles rather than having to go on location for months at a time in other states and or cities.

I‚Äôm a huge animal lover and advocate and I spend much of my free time rescuing and bringing awareness to animal welfare and it‚Äôs hard for me to leave my menagerie of rescues for too long LOL

Who is your biggest beauty inspiration?

Well there‚Äôs the legends like Marilyn Monroe and Sophia Loren but I will say currently Jennifer Lopez is a force to be reckoned with! She is so beautiful the bone structure and oh my goodness the skin!

Who are some of your favorite models and designers, and why?

I love so many amazingly talented female designers I‚Äôm very much a supporter of women in business I absolutely adore Marchesa, Donatella Versace, Stella McCartney.

Gigi Hadid is stunning, she‚Äôs not the it girl for no reason!

What are your makeup bag staples when traveling?

I actually probably don‚Äôt carry and wear as much as people think I do. obviously for a lot of photo shoots it‚Äôs glam glam glam which I love but I generally just put on two coats of Diorshow mascara with my natural eyelashes, a nice winged Mac gel eyeliner in jet black and lip gloss, gloss, gloss for days! I love Giorgio Armani and Chanel.

And I never ever go to bed without removing my make up! Everybody says that but I don‚Äôt think I have ever gone to bed in my make up in my entire life not even once I‚Äôm fanatical about removing it. Neutrogena night calming make up wipes make it a piece of cake. And I always have crem de la mer.

What is fun and rewarding about modeling? And what is not?

Modeling is always interesting because you‚Äôre creating along with the photographer and glam team a work of art in its own way and everyone‚Äôs take on that is different and every job is different and it allows one to express their creativity and at the end you have a visual reward that lasts forever, a moment in time captured generally quite beautifully.

I don‚Äôt really feel that there is a downside I‚Äôm very fortunate to be able to be in the business I love and make a living so I don‚Äôt really acknowledge any downside.

What‚Äôs your advice for the newer models?

Choose your jobs carefully because even though your new and starting out doesn‚Äôt mean you have to pose in Ways you‚Äôre not comfortable with‚Ä¶. and having a good attitude goes further than anything else as far as I‚Äôm concerned treat people with respect and courtesy even if they don‚Äôt do the same.

What music do you like?

I‚Äôm pretty old-school, it‚Äôs pretty much classic rock all the way for me ‚Ä¶I have my dad to thank for that!

Do you support any charity?

Many, I‚Äôm highly involved in animal activism and animal advocacy. All of my proceeds from my emoji app go to animal charity as well as a portion of any other sales generated through my Modeling. PETA, ASPCA.

A perfect Sunday is‚Ä¶

Going on a long hike and then cuddling at home with my rescue cats.

3 things you can‚Äôt leave home without?

iPhone X, Sunglasses RX and Alkaline water.

What do you think of Social Media?

I love social media, I‚Äôm a bit of an antisocial person by nature. I‚Äôm a total loner even though I‚Äôm in a very extroverted profession. I‚Äôm inclined to spend most of my time alone with my animals so social media actually encourages me to be more interactive and more social in a social media kind of way LOL
