        "text": "Research Interests\n\nDr Hayes de Kalaf’s work examines the use and abuse of modern-day identity-based digital development 'solutions' within and beyond the international development sector - including the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) - which aim to provide all people, everywhere with a legal and, increasingly, digital identity over the next decade. Her critically acclaimed book 'Legal Identity, Race and Belonging in the Dominican Republic: From Citizen to Foreigner', published with a Foreword by the Pulitzer Prize-winning Dominican American author Junot Díaz, focuses specifically on access to citizenship across Latin America and the Caribbean examining how states can manufacture, block or deny access to citizens - including the migrant-descended - to their documentation. This includes the growing influence of international organisations such as the World Bank over facilitating the en masse introduction of digital identification systems. Her recent work on the AHRC-funded project ‘The Windrush Scandal in a Transnational and Commonwealth Context’ included extensive empirical research across Jamaica, Barbados and Trinidad and Tobago as well as the design and creation of an online digital oral history archive examining the historical origins of this major controversy. You can find out more about Eve's publications and research interests here.\n\nWider academic work\n\nIn collaboration with the IHR, Eve has convened the popular CLACS Caribbean Studies Seminar Series. This online series conceives of the Caribbean in its broadest possible sense; cross-cutting varying historical, political, sociocultural, linguistic, transnational and decolonial contexts. Through the active promotion of intellectual engagement, knowledge exchange and collaboration, we welcome the participation of postgraduate students, early career researchers, writers and scholars who wish to share their interdisciplinary, comparative and integrated research on the region.\n\nEve is winner of the David Nicholls Memorial Trust Award (2016), the Latin American Studies Association Guy Alexandre Prize (2018) and the CLACS Early Career Fellowship (2021), Institute of Languages, Cultures and Societies, University of London. She is a former board member of the Society for Latin American Studies (2019-2023), an affiliate of the Resilient and Sustainable Islands Initiative, Overseas Development Institute (2022-), and Treasurer of the Haiti Support Group.\n\nIn addition to her scholarly work, Eve is an active campaigner against precarity and casualisation in higher education. She is founding member of the British Academy Early Career Network which, in partnership with the Wolfson Foundation, is piloting a new scheme across the humanities and social sciences over the next two years. Eve is a proud single mum to her daughter Leila who regularly accompanies her to work events and conferences."
