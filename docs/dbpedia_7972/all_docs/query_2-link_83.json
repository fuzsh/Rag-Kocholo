        "text": "Alice Lai Platt, C’93, and Mark Platt, C’91\n\nWe met at a Kappa Sig rush party; a rushee brought me as his date. Knowing us in college, I’m not sure anyone would’ve bet on us getting married.\n\nEditor: The photo on the left?\n\nAlice: That’s the first photo of us ever. Parents weekend. I did not want to meet his parents so soon— we had only gone out a few times and weren’t serious. It helped that there was a group of his friends going with us. His parents took us all to Bocce. It was my first time having BBQ chicken pizza, and I loved it! And I guess I stuck it out with him, too. Ha!\n\nDebbi (Stoll) Stern, C’93, and Brian Stern, C’93\n\nBrian and I met during Spring Fling freshman year. We started dating and I started falling for him. A few weeks later, I woke-up with a pit in my stomach. We have cousins in California named Stern! What if I’m dating my cousin?! I panicked and called my mom at 2:00 in the morning. I tried to act calm but it just blurted out… “Do we have a cousin named Brian in California?” Thankfully, no! I was relieved and fell back asleep. My mom still teases me about it to this day.\n\nBrian’s Favorite Moment: My favorite moment at Penn was meeting my best friend and wife. Debbi Stoll grew up to be the most beautiful woman in the world.\n\nDebbi’s Favorite Moment: Yeah, I liked meeting Brian, too. I’m still waiting for him to grow up!\n\nElaine Divelbliss, C’93, L’98, and Steve Livenson, C’93\n\nElaine Divelbliss and Steve Libenson met at our very first Penn Homecoming in the fall of 1993. Steve was working at Monitor Company in Cambridge while I was working in Pittsburgh at PNC Bank and applying to law school. We met up with our Penn friends for the Homecoming game at Franklin Field and then all made our way to Smokes. During our senior year, Steve and I both lived in large houses off campus with many friends — all of whom knew each other quite well, except for the two of us. We never met. With everyone together at Homecoming, Steve and I found ourselves side-by-side in a booth at Smokes where we talked for hours about our many shared interests, especially our shared love of the Pittsburgh Steelers. In that booth and mostly because of the Steeler thing, Steve popped the question as kind of a joke: “Should I ask you to marry me now or should I meet your family first?”\n\nHe met my family a few months later, and we were engaged in June 1994. We were married in June 1995 in the Pittsburgh suburbs where I grew up surrounded by many Penn friends, who we count among our dearest friends to this day. We have lived in Boston, Princeton, the Upper West Side for many years, and most recently Ridgewood, NJ. Steve is a partner in the strategy consulting practice at Rosetta/Sapient, and I’m the General Counsel of Virgin Mobile USA. We have three amazing and exhausting children, Daniel (15), Lindsey (13), and Claire (6).\n\nIn our spare time, we travel with our family to fulfill our autistic son Daniel’s dream of experiencing subways and other cool transportation around the world, explore all things theater, dance and arts with Lindsey, and do pretty much whatever Claire tells us (she’s fierce for a kindergartner) — and of course we travel to Pittsburgh during the season to raise our children in the Steeler tradition.\n\nNicole (Weaver) Marshall, C’93, and Stephen Marshall, C’93\n\nOur story was simple in origin but has most certainly grown to the extraordinary since the fateful moment we set eyes on each other at Penn. It was early our freshman year in October. Both Stephen and I lived in High Rise South. Stephen was on the Penn sailing team with my freshman roommate. One day he came knocking on dorm room 911 looking not for a future life partner but for my roommate who was on the sailing team with him.\n\nStephen: I was caught of guard when Nicole answered the door. I said to myself, she is so beautiful, just do what you came for and don’t make a fool out of yourself. You will know what to do next time you see her.\n\nNicole: I was struck by how handsome Stephen was. There were definitely sparks flying!\n\nOur first date was a double date with Penn friends to a movie and Boathouse Bar at The Rittenhouse Hotel. Afterwards, our friends went home and we strolled through Rittenhouse Square together where we would later picnic regularly with our children. I vividly remember the walk through the Square as well as our first date alone at The White Dog Cafe. Stephen and I dated all four years and both graduated in 1993, celebrating jointly with our families.\n\nWe married in 1998 and have two gorgeous daughters, both sailors! We love taking our girls to Penn’s campus and enjoy living near Philadelphia so we can take advantage of being part of the Penn community. Stephen and I will be married 20 years this May and every year we are more and more grateful that he knocked on my door that day.\n\nStephen: I should add that my parents met at Penn as well. We are trying not to burden our daughters with the responsibility of both getting into Penn and meeting their soulmate here!"
