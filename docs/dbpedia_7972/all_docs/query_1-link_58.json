        "text": "Hey Stacey! How’s it goin’? What have you been up to?\n\nThings are really good for me right now. I came from England to Nebraska to San Francisco and finally to Los Angeles. I’m hosting a show with Chuck Woolery which is something that I could say is a dream of mine because he’s such a legend. It’s such a fun show to work on. It’s a game show called Lingo. I have a blast doing it and it doesn’t feel like work! As long as you’re doing something that doesn’t feel like work you can’t help but say it’s fun, right!\n\nExactly! And if you’re like me, if I enjoy doing something that could be considered work I’m that more motivated to do it and do it better.\n\nExactly. They could probably not even pay me and I’d still do it! I probably shouldn’t say stuff like that! They’ll see this and ask me to come do it for free! That’s how much fun it is. I get to wear all these pretty clothes and I get to keep them. I get to improvise and have fun and it’s all good. Can this really be a job? It’s great.\n\nWhat’s the schedule like for Lingo? Do you do more than one show a day?\n\nThat’s the awesome thing about it! We do like 10, 12, 14 shows in a day. We actually shoot an entire season – about 75 shows – in about 13 days. They’re not consecutive days, but scattered throughout. Talk about having a lot of vacation time! It’s awesome, right!?\n\nWhere do I sign up?!\n\nYeah, I know! I got lucky with this one.\n\nHow did you land this gig?\n\nIt was just another one of those things. I’d done a lot of stand up comedy. I’d done the Tonight Show and other venues where the stand-up had been featured. I got a lot of work as a result of that. That kind of gave me somewhat of and edge. It was just another one of those auditions that us girls go on in LA 10 times a week. It was call-back after call-back, weeding everybody out. There were tons of girls from all over the place. The whole stand-up thing kind of gave me an edge because they wanted someone who could improvise. They also wanted someone who was good at spelling. I’m also the judge of the show so I have to determine if a word is spelled right or if it’s even a word at all. I got the job basically through auditioning but I think I had somewhat of an edge because of the stand-up. That’s what they told me. Maybe it’s because they thought I looked good in a mini-skirt! (laughs)\n\nThey would never admit that too easily…\n\nYeah, they’ll doctor it up and make it sound all good. At the end it was just the mini-skirt!\n\nSee, you girls know what’s going on!\n\nOf course we know what’s going on! Why do you think we wear those little mini micro-skirts and low-cut shirts to auditions? We know!\n\nTell me a little about yourself growing up. What made you decide to come to Hollywood?\n\nI’m a Leo and I think I’ve always been a bit of a ham. I was doing plays and TV commercials and films when I was really super young in London. That’s because I was really always desperate to be on stage and do something for attention. I was full of it. I started really young as a competitive roller skater and a competitive ice skater, really anything that involved performing. As time goes by it’s almost just a natural progression when you have that mindset to want to come to Los Angeles. The first place I went was Nebraska. There’s not a whole lot going on in Nebraska as far as acting and modeling, although I did manage to find some things. It became apparent I was going to have to go to California. I moved to San Francisco and did a fair amount of work there. I found Los Angeles and realized, “This is where all the work is!” It’s also where all the competition is, mind you. You go to these auditions for a good-looking blue-eyed blonde between 18 and 28 and you have a zillion Playboy Bunnies there who are all just striking and look exactly like each other. The competition is rough but there is also a ton of work. LA is definitely the place to be if you’re wanting to be in this business, for sure.\n\nOh! There are girls in LA? I didn’t even notice! (sarcastic tone)\n\n(laughs) I think you’re the only one that didn’t! I’m a girl and I notice gorgeous girls every day all over the place! It’s really ridiculous. Talk about an intimidating city to come to! At first it takes you aback. The clubs and the restaurants on the Sunset Strip are full of these drop-dead gorgeous girls. You can’t help but wonder if someone’s filming a movie and they’re all extras. People really look like that at Noon on a Tuesday. I love LA.\n\nI think an ugly girl in LA would be a beauty queen in Knoxville!\n\nIt’s so sad, but you’re probably right about that! The same goes for Nebraska or anywhere else. LA is almost like a Twilight Zone. Everybody is almost visually too perfect. Sadly, that can lead to a certain segment being super shallow. That’s probably why LA gets it’s bum rap. There’s definitely a shallow vibe going on in certain circles. Not everybody’s like that.\n\nI’ve gotta know more about Lingo. How long have you been with the show?\n\nI finished the 75 shows and they’re currently running. Believe it or not they’re on seven days a week, about five times a day, on the Game Show Network. I get fan mail from all over the world. Russia, Germany, China, Japan, literally everywhere. A lot of the foreign fans tell me the show helps them learn their English, which is really cool. Kids in really obscure places are telling me the show’s helping them with their English. I think that’s really sweet. We’ll start shooting the next season at the end of this year.\n\nWhat’s it like working with Chuck Woolery? He is a legend in the business, no question.\n\nHe’s such a nice guy. The show was on the air a couple of seasons before I came along. It was his show and he did a marvelous job on his own. A lot of hosts could of had an ego and decided they didn’t need some girl in a mini skirt getting in the way. His attitude was so opposite of that. He was so welcoming to me and so supportive and a really fun guy to be around. He has kids my age. He looks incredibly young for his years. He’s a really good, down to earth guy. He’s a lot of fun to be around. I can’t say enough good things about Chuck. He’s awesome!\n\nYou told me the other day that you can rock harder than any chick on this side of the pond. I wanna know what you listen to!\n\n(laughs) You know, it’s so funny. I am such a music person. I have got to have music playing no matter where I am. My idea of hell would be to be in a car with no CD player or radio. I would lose my mind! I have to have music to survive life!\n\nI know what you mean. I have a stereo in the bathroom, two upstairs, and two more downstairs. I go to sleep listening to music and the first thing I do every day is put on a CD.\n\nI am so the same way. Music has helped me get through the most difficult times and it’s led me through the best times. I love music and live shows. As far as what kind, I flip-flop back and forth. I just spent years and years obsessed with Pearl Jam. Ten got me through so many tough times. Today I listen to a lot of hip-hop. When I’m on my way to auditions I listen to a lot of stuff that gets me pumped up and fired up, ready to go! The next day I’ll put the radio back on and listen to Van Halen. I’m all over the place. I love Linkin Park, too.\n\nWhat bands did you listen to growing up?\n\nMy parents got me into music really super young. They’re so cool and they’ve always had an appreciation for music. My dad got me into Pink Floyd and Def Leppard. I love Def Leppard! I actually saw them about eight months ago and they were awesome! I was losing my mind! I was right up front dancing. I’m sure I looked like a stripper on acid! I wasn’t! It was just me having fun, ya know! Some of the 80s stuff is cool. I saw Berlin a little while back. Do you remember them?\n\nYeah, I saw them open up for somebody once. It was years ago. I can’t make it sound too long ago. I’m 27. I think it was REO Speedwagon.\n\nWow, we’re the same age! I can’t believe you know about those bands. Most people our age didn’t start enjoying music quite as young to know about those bands.\n\nWhen I was a kid my mom always played Van Halen, Rod Stewart, Journey, Motley Crue. My dad had some Creedence records, Johnny Rivers, Elvis, and the Ventures. As I got older I discovered other bands like KISS, Ted Nugent, Ratt, Poison, and on and on. I love it. That’s about all I listen to now, too!\n\nI love Motley Crue! I had “Girls, Girls, Girls” blasting yesterday! I have a convertible. I was driving down the freeway and that’s like sitting in a parking lot because it’s in LA! I had it blaring and this older lady next to me in her convertible Jaguar was staring at me with such disgust! I just turned it up! (laughs) I actually did an event with Vince Neil about a year ago. For two years I’ve been at his charity golf event. He’s a super nice guy who’s surrounded by really gorgeous girls telling him how much they love him! It hasn’t changed since the 80s! They’re still crawling all over him!\n\nSeeing how you’re in the great city of Los Angeles, who are some of the recent celebrities you’ve run into?\n\nHmm. I saw Cindy Crawford a couple of weeks ago. Does she count?\n\nAre you kidding! I had her plastered all over my walls when I was younger! Of course she counts!\n\n(laughs) Ok, then! Cindy Crawford! I saw Dustin Hoffman in Santa Monica. When I first moved here I would send emails to my family to let them know who I’d seen that week. Now I’ve lived here long enough that you see ‘em and just kinda forget, ya know?\n\nAre you numb to the whole Hollywood thing? Is it possible?\n\nIt’s always cool to see somebody famous. I was at this place called The Grove. Lisa Kudrow of Friends was standing behind me with her kids. I turned around and saw her and still thought it was cool. You’ll always give it a glance. I probably don’t get as excited as I used to but it’s still fun. It’s fun to see people in life who you’ve only seen on screen.\n\nWhat’s the biggest lesson you’ve learned since being in Hollywood?\n\nIt sound like a cliche, but you’ve got to learn not to take rejection personally. The rejection you face on a daily basis in this business in Los Angeles is probably more than most people face in a lifetime. You go to these auditions and give it your best and boom – nothing. It just happens on a daily basis. There are so many jobs and so many people trying for them. That’s why Lingo is such a blessing. It opens up so many other doors. I’m already on television so that really makes life easier. Before that the rejection was unreal. You always wonder “why didn’t I get that part,” “wasn’t I good enough,” “what did I do wrong?” You could drive yourself crazy. You’ve got to learn that that’s just the way it is. It doesn’t mean you suck if you don’t get the part!\n\nWhat do you do to stay motivated?\n\nI think I feel like I’ve gone too far to ever go back. I’ve wanted this my whole life. I really didn’t know how to do anything else! (laughs) That’s it! I don’t have any other choice! If you can’t do anything else what are you going to do? A lot of people come here and quit. It’s those that keep hammering away that will ultimately get the gig.\n\nThank God for all the quitters in life, right!\n\nReally! I wish everybody would quit! I’d be huge! (laughs)\n\nAre there plans for the Stacey Hayes Show anytime soon?\n\nThat would be really cool to do my own show, actually. I’ve got my fingers crossed. I can’t say completely that I have a concrete idea. I know that I love hosting and I’m really good at improvising. That could go down so many avenues that I would never say it would have to be a certain type of show. I’m also an actress so there’s lot of stuff out there.\n\nAre you eyeing any new projects now?\n\nI have a couple of things in the works with a major network. I can’t really say a whole lot more about it. That’s lame, I know, but I can’t say too much. It’s just in the talking stages.\n\nWhat do you want to tell everybody?\n\nThanks for all the letters and the support! I totally appreciate it. I get the most awesome supportive fan letters. That really makes up for all the years of rejection I’ve had. It’s really cool. I read every single one of them. You can find me through my website, StaceyHayes.com. I reply to them all, too. It may take me a while but I do get to all of them!"
