        "text": "Welcome to Hayes Grass-fed Beef Farm; thanks for stopping by. We’re the owners, John and Stacy Hayes. This place we call home is a family farm in Monroe County, Indiana, with grass-covered rolling hills, big ol’ shade trees, and its own fresh water creek that snakes through the valley, fed by cool water from springs. We care about the land and the water that runs through it; we care about how our cattle are raised and taken care of. So we do things here a little differently, showing kindness to our cattle and the environment. As a result, we offer the highest quality, 100% grass-fed beef that you can find in this area."
