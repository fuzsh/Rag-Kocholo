        "text": "EXCLUSIVE: Adam Davidson has been tapped as director and producer for the feature One Mile and its sequel, One More Mile, both starring and produced by Ryan Phillippe. German American actress Amélie Hoeferle has been cast as the female lead opposite Phillippe in the films, from Aaron Kaplan’s Kapital Entertainment, which will be filmed simultaneously. Production is slated to begin Sept. 9 on Vancouver Island.\n\nOriginally set at Paramount Global Content Distribution in late 2022, the movies have since shifted under Paramount’s Republic Pictures umbrella.\n\nMore from Deadline\n\nSpiritual Procedural From Terrence Coli, Steve Leder & Kapital In Works At Netflix\n\nBella Thorne & Ryan Phillippe Thriller 'Saint Clare' To Open Taormina Film Festival\n\nRyan Phillippe & Kate Beckinsale Lead Thriller 'The Patient', First Look Revealed - Cannes Market\n\nOne Mile and its sequel were written by John Hlavin based on an idea by Kaplan’s daughter, Jaiden Kaplan, with rewrites by TJ Brady and Rasheed Newson who worked on Kapital’s Showtime series The Chi. In the films, when an estranged father (Phillippe) and daughter (Hoeferle) go off for college tours, they get more than they bargained for when they get lost and stumble across a hostile, off-the-grid community.\n\nPhillippe and Davidson produce alongside Jaiden Kaplan, who came up with the story when she and her father were touring colleges. Aaron Kaplan and Michael Lohmann produce for Kapital; Chad Oakes and Mike Frislev for Nomadic Pictures, which handles physical production in Vancouver. Hlavin executive produces. Kevin Marco is the executive in charge at Kapital.\n\nDavidson is a prolific episodic director who has worked on dozens of series, including Shooter, created by Hlavin and starring Phillippe. He served as director/executive producer on I’m Dying Up Here, Zoey’s Extraordinary Playlist and Lie To Me, and directed the pilots for Fear The Walking Dead, Kingdom and Ordinary Joe. Early in his career, Davidson won an Oscar and Palme D’Or for his short The Lunch Date. He is repped by CAA, Rain and attorney Ryan Goodell at Yorn Levine.\n\nHoeferle starred in the Blumhouse feature Night Swim opposite Kerry Condon and Wyatt Russell and was part of the cast of Lionsgate’s The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes. She can next be seen opposite Joaquin Phoenix, Emma Stone, Austin Butler and Pedro Pascal in Ari Aster’s film Eddington for A24. Hoeferle is repped by Gersh, Affirmative Entertainment, and Jackoway Austen Tyerman.\n\nBest of Deadline\n\nBook To Movie Adaptations Coming Out This Year\n\nList Of Hollywood & Media Layoffs So Far In 2024: From Paramount To Warner Bros Discovery To CNN\n\n‘Uglies’ Movie: Everything We Know So Far"
