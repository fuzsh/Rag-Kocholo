I`m Chris Hayes. Tonight, mourners have\n\ngathered around the country concluding at a vigil at Raleigh, North\n\nCarolina to honor the three young Muslim-Americans shot to death Tuesday\n\nnight in their apartment at a campus in the University of North Carolina at\n\nChapel Hill. This has been a day of mourning.\n\nEarlier, thousands gathered for a funeral service for the three slain\n\nstudents, dental student Deah Barakat, his wife, Yusor Abu-Salha and his 19\n\n-- and her 19-year-old sister Razan.\n\nPolice have charged this man, Craig Stephen Hicks, who lived in the same\n\napartment complex as the victims with the murders.\n\nThe police say their preliminary investigation indicated the crime was\n\nmotivated by anger over perceived parking infractions by the victims.\n\nThe father of the slain sisters told MSNBC today, he considers the murder\n\nas a hate crime, driven by anti-Muslim biased. And in conjunction with\n\nmajor Muslim groups, the victim`s family and members plan to send a letter\n\nto the Department of Justice, calling for a formal hate-crime\n\ninvestigation.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nALBU-SALHA: Even though the murderer can say that it was a parking\n\ndispute, whatever he was picking on, he came to their apartment with his\n\ngun two or three times before the murder, on different occasions.\n\nMy daughter Yusor complained and she told us that she felt that man hated\n\nthem for the way they looked and the Muslim garb they wore. She felt the\n\nheat has risen after she moved into the apartment. And her friends came to\n\nvisit in Muslim -- and wear our Muslim attire.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nHAYES: Tonight, a News & Observers reporting, the FBI has now opened a\n\nparallel inquiry to killings to determine whether or not any federal laws\n\nwere violated.\n\nEarlier today, StoryCorp posts a recording of comments made by one of the\n\nvictim, Yusor Albu-Salha when she visited the StoryCorp booth with her\n\nformer elementary school teacher last summer.\n\n(BEGIN AUDIO CLIP)\n\nYUSOR ALBU-SALHA: Growing up in America has been such a blessing and, you\n\nknow, although in some ways I do stand out, such as, you know, the Hijab I\n\nwear on my head, the head covering, there are still so many ways that I\n\nfeel so embedded in the fabric that is, you know, our culture. And that`s\n\nthe beautiful thing here is that it doesn`t matter where you come from.\n\nThere`s so many different people from so many different places, of\n\ndifferent backgrounds and religions, but here we`re all one.\n\n(END AUDIO CLIP)\n\nHAYES: Joining me now from Raleigh, North Carolina tonight is Deah\n\nBarakat`s brother, Farris Barakat. Farris, I just want to thank you for\n\njoining me and start out by saying we are all just horribly heartbroken and\n\nsorry for your loss.\n\nFARRIS BARAKAT, BROTHER OF DEAH BARAKAT: Thank you for honoring me and\n\nit`s really good to hear Yusor`s voice again, actually. Thank you for\n\nthat.\n\nHAYES: How are you feeling today? I can`t imagine the grief your family\n\nis going through. And also at the same time, there has been such a\n\nremarkable outpouring. You`ve been so embraced. There are so many people\n\nacross the country thinking of you, praying for you. How are you feeling\n\nat this moment?\n\nBARAKAT: Honestly, I just speak on my behalf and on behalf of my life and\n\nthe Albu-Salha family. Grief is not something we feel right now. The\n\nsupport has been tremendous and honestly we are -- we have hugged each\n\nother. I told him congratulations. I`ve hugged my mom and told her\n\ncongratulations because your son is now in paradise, the highest level.\n\nSo honestly, we don`t feel grief. We are happy for them. And we`re going\n\nto miss them soon. But right now, we`re related and we`re so happy that\n\nGod felt like we`re strong enough to handle this. And we rely on His\n\nwisdom for this plan. And we look forward to what`s happening because no\n\none can make sense of this but we`re strong in our faith. And trust me, it\n\nis not grief that we`re feeling.\n\nHAYES: What do you want people to know about your brother and his wife and\n\nher sister? What should we know about what kind of people they were?\n\nBARAKAT: I was asked this earlier and I wasn`t able to answer because I\n\ndidn`t want to answer and not give the chance to give the thousands of\n\nother people that Yusor and my brother helped answer that as well with me.\n\nThere are so much to talk about my brother and my sister-in-law and there`s\n\nan -- my brother was kind and gentle but big and competitive and on the\n\nbasketball court and off and Yusor was such the passive, kind, peaceful,\n\nsoft-spoken type and Razan was such the able designer and she was very --\n\nshe was always was creative with her ideas and always is willing to use her\n\ntalent for others. And as many times, I wanted to resort to her and say,\n\nhey Razan I wanted to work on this project and I want to resort to her on\n\nthis occasion but sadly I`ve come to realize that I couldn`t.\n\nHAYES: I saw -- there had been some recording about the person who was\n\naccused of committing this horrible crime, this crime adding post in the\n\nFacebook things that his own beliefs, militant, atheism I believe you know\n\nthat, not having a believe in God and sort of looking down on those who do.\n\nAnd I saw a statement that was posted by one group of atheist, American\n\natheist, sort of condemning the killings in a kind of ritualized way that\n\nhas come to be expected of essentially random Muslims in the wake of some\n\nkilling by -- someone who is a Muslim, even if it`s halfway across the\n\nworld. And I wonder what`s your response to that was?\n\nBARAKAT: Many people actually have tried to condemn this act and for\n\natheist I think that they need to condemn this act is kind of -- would be\n\nhypocritical for me to expect because, as a Muslim, I know that one act of\n\nthe violence does not represent all Muslims and this act does not represent\n\nall atheists. And to me, I tell to the community, we know that this does\n\nnot represent any sane and loving and human being as atheist can be.\n\nSo, that is my response and thank you for everything.\n\nHAYES: Finally I wanted to ask you if you have a message for the President\n\nof the United States, there is a wave of grief happening across this\n\ncountry. A feeling like, this is some kind of important galvanizing moment\n\nfor the way Muslim-Americans relate to America and feel protected and\n\nembraced or marginalized and I wonder if there`s something you want to say\n\nto the President?\n\nBARAKAT: I guess this message goes to the President but every citizen of\n\nthis democratic country, I hope that we can use this tragedy to -- as much\n\nas it`s a grave tragedy, I think we can all agree that so much good has\n\ncome out of it, if we continue to do that, if we can continue to see the\n\ngreat blessing that it is. And to hopefully, you know, the only -- it\n\ndoesn`t change anything that this is classified as a hate-crime or not, but\n\nyou know the idea is, if we classify it as a hate-crime, and maybe people\n\nwill start understanding that, you know, Islamophobia or hate or ignorance\n\ncan kill, it can affect people`s lives and can take away three citizens\n\nfrom this wonderful country and even more.\n\nAnd my message is, let`s fight ignorance despite hate together and let`s\n\nuse this as an excuse to do so.\n\nHAYES: Farris Barakat, I have to say, you and you`re entire family showed\n\ntremendous grace and again, our deepest condolences. Thank you very much\n\nfor taking time tonight, I know it`s hard.\n\nBARAKAT: Thank you, thank you.\n\nHAYES: This unfathomable tragedy has become a rallying point both across\n\nthe world with Palestinians protesting the killings outside U.N.\n\nheadquarters in Gaza City today and here at home with an outpouring of\n\nsupport for the three promising young Muslim-Americans who were both\n\nobservant and proud about their religion and in a million ways, just\n\nutterly American.\n\nDeah Barakat was a basketball fanatic who posted this absolutely adorable\n\nand now heartbreaking vine (ph) of Yusor Alba-Salha with the caption, she\n\ngets buckets.\n\nDonations to his project to bring dental care to Syrian refugees have now\n\nhit more than $250,000, the goal was just $20,000. On Twitter, the\n\nhashtag, Muslim lives matter and our three winners have become a rallying\n\ncry for so many people and it feels to me, that someone observing this,\n\nadmittedly from the outside, like a galvanizing moment for Muslim-\n\nAmericans.\n\nA Trayvon Martin moment, a Michael Brown moment for Muslim-Americans,\n\nthough obviously very different in the context and specific sets of facts\n\nin history, likely killing of Trayvon Martin and Michael Brown, the\n\nsenseless deaths of these three young people has struck such a profound\n\nnerve and mobilized so many because millions of people who look like those\n\nvictims are fed up with the routine stereotyping, the marginalization and\n\nmainstream media representations and the vilification by political leaders\n\nseeking to score cheap political points.\n\nWhatever the motivations for this horrendous slaughter, it takes place in\n\nthe context where subtle, persistent anti-Muslim bias is a part of American\n\nlife, and this feels like a wake-up call.\n\nJoining me now is Farhana Khera. She `s President and Executive Director\n\nof Muslim Advocates. And Farhana, I want to ask you about a letter that I\n\nunderstand you and other organizations are planning to send to the White\n\nHouse tomorrow.\n\nFARHANA KHERA, PRESIDENT AND EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF MUSLIM ADVOCATES: Yeah.\n\nChris, first of all, I want to extend my deepest condolences to the\n\nfamilies of the victims. Frankly, their strength and courage these last\n\nfew days has been inspiring. And my thoughts and prayers are with them.\n\nYou know, like you were just saying Chris, the level of the way in which\n\nthe strategy is being felt across the American-Muslim community, I haven`t\n\nseen anything like this since the tragic events of September 11 frankly.\n\nI can`t tell you how many messages I`ve read this week of mothers hugging\n\ntheir children tightly and hoping that these brutal murders are not the\n\nfuture for Muslims in America. But we know this Chris, that unfortunately\n\nthis was not an isolated incident.\n\nWe know that in the last five years, there`s been a disturbing uptick in\n\nanti-Muslim bigotry and hate crimes. And that is why we are calling on the\n\nPresident and the Attorney General to act. They have been silent. We need\n\nthem to address these murders in clear and unconditional terms. And we\n\nwant the Attorney General to open a full and rigorous federal investigation\n\nto ensure that this does not happen again.\n\nIt is -- Absolutely important for the nations to up law enforcement officer\n\nto send a clear message to people not only in North Carolina, but across\n\nthis country.\n\nHAYES: I should know, we do have just before it went on air, one report\n\nfrom News & Observer local paper that that`s -- it appears such a parallel\n\ninquiry may have already been initiated by the federal government.\n\nWhat do you say to people that say, \"We don`t know the motivations,\" the\n\nwife of the person who was alleged of committed this murder says it was\n\nabout -- in the police`s words, a parking dispute which is a very weird\n\nphrase in a context of killing three people?\n\nBut, you know, you don`t know what`s going through his head and you\n\nshouldn`t be making this into something that it isn`t necessarily?\n\nKHERA: Well, I think given the environment of -- in which this took place,\n\nChris, and especially in the last -- even in the last several weeks where\n\nwe`ve seen politicians from state houses to Governor Bobby Jindal make\n\nanti-Muslim comments, where we`ve seen frankly just threatening messages on\n\nsocial media particularly after the release of the Hollywood movie\n\n\"American Sniper.\"\n\nThere`s a certain environment taking place and I might add you mentioned\n\nthat the FBI has started a preliminary inquiry, we think that`s a good step\n\nbut preliminary inquiries don`t always result in full investigations and so\n\nwe`re seeking a full and open rigorous investigation. And we think that is\n\nwhat`s needed because of this climate of hate because it`s not just taking\n\nplace in North Carolina, Chris, it`s taking place across the country.\n\nHAYES: Farhana Khera, thank you very much.\n\nBefore we leave this, I want to just show some statistics on hate crimes\n\nagainst Muslims in this country. And you`ll notice something pretty\n\nstunning.\n\nThey were very low before 2001, September 11th. They went skyrocketed that\n\nyear and they have remain quite and disturbingly high since then, something\n\nto think about the context of what happened down in Chapel Hill, all right.\n\nAs same-sex marriage licenses get mandated in Mobile, Alabama. I`ll be\n\njoined here in studio by NBA veteran Jason Collins, the first major pro-\n\nsport athlete to come out.\n\nBut first, an astonishing speech from an expected quarter\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nCOMEY: Many people in our white majority culture have unconscious racial\n\nbiases and react differently to a white face than a black face.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nHAYES: The current head of the FBI unflinching on the subject of race and\n\npolice. That`s next.\n\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\nHAYES: This week I travel to Texas, home of the most active death chamber\n\nin the country and our next installment of the All In America`s series\n\nbrought me to death row in Livingstone, Texas.\n\nYesterday, I sat down with the man who is scheduled to be executed in just\n\nthree weeks. Rodney Reed convicted in the 1996 rape and murder of a woman\n\nnamed Stacey Stites maintains his innocence to this day. I talked with him\n\nnot only about the case, about what living on death row from nearly two\n\ndecades has been like. Relationships, he told me, are difficult to\n\ndevelop.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nHAYES: Do you have friendships that have been born here?\n\nRODNEY REED, TEXAS DEATH ROW INMATE: I don`t use that word loosely,\n\nfriends, you know what I`m saying. Friendship, I mean, I have guys that I\n\nassociate with because when you go as far as making a friend, I mean,\n\nthere`s feelings there that if you know what a true friend is, you know,\n\nwhat I`m saying, you know what I`m saying and you, the next thing, you\n\nknow, the state`s gonna take them. It`s more likely the friend that is,\n\nyou know, the state`s gonna kill him.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nHAYES: You`ll hear more of what Rodney Reed told me about life on death\n\nrow in our Facebook page, facebook.com/allinwithchris.\n\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\nHAYES: Something remarkable happened in Washington today. One of the\n\nnation`s top law enforcement official, the man who spent most of his career\n\nin law enforcement and who`s a Bush appointee to the Justice Department,\n\nthis man right here. FBI Director James Comey delivered some brazing hard\n\ntruths on racial justice and policing in America.\n\nThe speech today at Georgetown University Comey spoke unsparingly about law\n\nenforcement`s role in this country`s legacy of racism.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nCOMEY: All of us in law enforcement must be honest enough to acknowledge\n\nthat much of our history is not pretty. At many points in American\n\nhistory, law enforcement enforced the status quo. A status quo that was\n\noften brutally unfair to disfavored groups.\n\nLittle compares to the experience on our soil of black Americans. That\n\nexperience should be part of every American`s consciousness, and law\n\nenforcement`s role in that experience including in recent times must be\n\nremembered.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nHAYES: His speech was explicitly framed around events since the death of\n\nMichael Brown and Eric Garner a little more than six months ago, the idea\n\nof this kind of talk coming from the Director of the FBI, the Irish-\n\nAmerican grandson of a cop, would have seemed inconceivable. The same time\n\nComey also sought to defend law enforcement and focus on the long\n\ncomplicated antecedents to the encounters between cops and people with\n\ncollar in neighborhoods across the country.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nCOMEY: Law enforcement is not the root cause of the problems in our\n\nhardest hit neighborhoods. Police officers, people of enormous courage and\n\nintegrity in the overwhelming main (ph) are in those neighborhoods, risking\n\ntheir lives, to protect folks from offenders who are a product of problems\n\nthat will not be solved by body cameras.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nHAYES: Joining me now, Phillip Atiba Goff, co-founder and president of the\n\nCenter for Policing Equity. Well, Phillip, I thought this is a pretty\n\namazing speech. What was your take on it?\n\nPHILLIP ATIBA GOFF, CENTER FOR POLICING EQUITY: I was gobsmacked. I felt\n\nexactly the way that you felt. You`re not expecting to see the Director of\n\nthe least trusted body in the federal government within black communities\n\ncome out and say everyone is a little bit racist.\n\nThat was sort of mind blowing. And I`m so glad that you`re covering this\n\nbecause I think it shows the incremental changes that give people so much\n\nhope that we can be doing something better with race and law enforcement\n\nthan what we`ve been doing up until now.\n\nHAYES: Yeah. There`s a part where he quotes the musical avenue queue that\n\nis a song everybody is a little bit racist to talk about unconscious. I\n\nthought that was key because I think what ends up happening often in these\n\nconversations that members of law enforcement police officers feel -- get\n\ninto a defensive crouch. Is your calling me a racist and this point that\n\nevery person even African-Americans as demonstrated in a lots of laboratory\n\nenvironments have anti-black bias that that is just part of what underlies\n\nanyone doing their job in law enforcement or elsewhere.\n\nGOFF: Yeah. And what I found to be even more -- maybe sort of radical in\n\nwhat he was saying is he said it`s easy to localize this problem within the\n\ncharacter of law enforcement. And his concern was that`s too easy.\n\nHAYES: Yeah.\n\nGOFF: But the problem is bigger than that and we all need to take\n\nownership of those bigger problems. This speech was sort of the power of\n\nhonesty, but even more it`s the power of historical literacy. So the point\n\nhe was making were profound from any director of the FBI. But beyond that\n\nhe got specific, he mentioned the fact that he sit at the desk where the\n\norder was received five lines to go ahead and wiretap Martin Luther King.\n\nSaying that out loud where people could hear him is it`s a brand new day\n\nfor every FBI`s relationship with these kinds of communities.\n\nHAYES: And in fact he talks about keeping and there`s a long portion of\n\nthe speech where he talks about why he keeps a copy of that approval of the\n\nwiretap request at his desk as a reminder of what the history the FBI is.\n\nAnd I mean, we were not even getting into the Black Panthers and\n\n(inaudible) and all sorts of other stuff they do.\n\nThis is just on King, but I mean this is an agency that has done some\n\npretty narrowly things to black activist through the decades. And for him\n\nto just acknowledge that, that itself I thought was pretty striking.\n\nGOFF: Yeah, it`s absolute. Again it was phenomenal. And, you know, so my\n\nphone was buzzing off the hook as soon as the text of it was released\n\nbecause there were a lot of folks in law enforcement who have felt this\n\nway, who have been waiting for leadership to come out and say it. And that\n\nhe ends the speech talking about data which he knows good and well that\n\nmajor city law enforcement has been calling for a national database not\n\njust on police-involved shootings but on all police behavior that were now\n\nputting together for the first time.\n\nIt was a phenomenal speech. It was -- and not just a work of amazing\n\npolitics but incredible honesty and something -- a good news race story at\n\nthe time when we can really use one.\n\nHAYES: Yeah, he said at one point it is ridiculous I cannot tell you how\n\nmany Americans were shot by police last year which is I think\n\nuncontroversially true.\n\nPhillip Atiba Goff, always a pleasure. Thank you.\n\nGOFF: Thank you.\n\nHAYES: Of all the top questions of potential presidential contenders face,\n\nI don`t think this should be one of them\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: Are you comfortable with the idea of evolution? Do you\n\nbelieve in it? Do you accept it?\n\nSCOTT WALKER, GOV. (R) WISCONSIN: For me I`m going to punt on that one as\n\nwell.\n\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: No. Really?\n\nWALKER: That`s a question a politician should be involved in one way or\n\nthe other.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nHAYES: Happy 206th birthday Charles Darwin, we`ll present some advise for\n\npresidential aspirants based on that question, ahead.\n\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\nHAYES: It`s the common presidential hopeful`s rite of passage. Travel\n\n(ph) London extensively to beef up your economic informed policy\n\ncredentials and stepping it.\n\nYesterday Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker was the latest Republican who\n\nfollow in that grand tradition, in a question and answer session at Chatham\n\nHouse, yesterday this happened.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: Can I finish with the question that I always assume as\n\nthe tradition now to ask visiting particularly Republican, senior\n\nRepublicans who come to London and it`s not about cheese and it`s not about\n\nforeign affairs. It`s actually about evolution. Do you -- Are you\n\ncomfortable with the idea of evolution? Do you believe in it? Do you\n\naccept it?\n\nWALKER: For me, I`m going to punt on that one as well...\n\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: No. Really?\n\nWALKER: That`s a question a politician should be involved in one way or\n\nthe other. So I`m going to leave that up to you and.\n\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: . with any British politician right or left wing would\n\nsay would love and say yes of course evolution is true. But.\n\nWALKER: To me I said it`s just one of those where I`m here to talk about\n\ntrade not to pontificate that. Another should.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nHAYES: Walker went on to tweet, \"Both science and my faith dictate my\n\nbelief that we are created by God. I believe faith and science are\n\ncompatible, and go hand in hand.\" It`s unfortunate the media chose to\n\npoliticize this issue during our trade mission to foster investment in\n\nWisconsin.\n\nSo over the last 30 days we`ve gaffer (ph) a new cycle about vaccines yes\n\nor no to crusades maybe not so bad to evolution, is it real. And out of\n\nall that madness there`s still something in particular about Walker`s\n\nanswer that`s stands out.\n\nFirst as a politician you`re never suppose to actually say, \"I`m going to\n\npunt on that one.\" That is supposed to be the subtext, the text is just\n\nyour non-responsive answer. Saying, \"I`m going to punt\" is like saying, \"I\n\nam evasive and untrustworthy.\"\n\nSecond Scott Walker, Rand Paul, and Chris Christie and anyone else there\n\nwho is thinking of running for president, I have three words of advice just\n\nsay yes -- should kids be vaccinated, yes. Did people commit horrible acts\n\nin the name of Christianity during the crusades, yes. Should kids be\n\ntaught evolution because it`s real, yes. Next question.\n\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\nHAYES: So the process of getting a marriage license in the state of\n\nAlabama has been in chaos in recent days.\n\nAfter a federal struck down the state`s ban on same-sex marriage, and the\n\nSupreme Court refused to block that ruling -- meaning it was going to go\n\ninto effect -- Roy Moore, the chief justice of Alabama`s Supreme Court, the\n\nstate court, took matters into his own hands.\n\nHe instructed local judges to ignore the federal court ruling and the\n\nSupreme Court and still refuse to issue marriage licenses to same-sex\n\ncouples.\n\nNow, as you might imagine, complete disarray followed with judges in some\n\ncounties following the federal court`s order and issuing the licenses while\n\nothers refused licenses to same-sex couples and some just shut down the\n\nentire marriage license operation altogether.\n\nBut today, another ruling which might provide some clarity to local judges\n\nwho aren`t sure what to do. Earlier today a federal judge ruled that\n\nofficials in Mobile should go ahead and let same-sex couples get married,\n\nbasically telling them to stop ignoring her original ruling from a few\n\nweeks ago when she declared, in so uncertain terms that Alabama`s ban on\n\nsame-sex marriage was unconstitutional.\n\nToday`s ruling was part of a lawsuit intended to clear things up between\n\nthe conflicting federal and state rulings. And in some ways, what is most\n\nremarkable about this fight in Alabama right now, this constitutional\n\ncrisis, is that it hasn`t happening earlier. I mean, in state after state\n\nafter state opponents of same-sex marriage have basically waved the white\n\nflag of surrender, which is partly a sign of the evolution in public\n\nopinion on this matter.\n\nAs recently as 2003, according to Pew Research, just 33 percent of the\n\ncountry supported same-sex marriage. Ten years later, half of the country\n\nfavored same-sex marriage. And that was the year that Jason Collins became\n\nthe first active male player in any of the big four American pro sports\n\nleagues to come out as gay.\n\nWriting at the time, quote, \"I`m glad I`m coming out in 2013 rather than\n\n2003. The climate has shifted. Public opinion has shifted. And yet we\n\nstill have so much farther to go.\"\n\nAnd joining me now is Jason Collins. Great to have you here. I wanted to\n\ntalk to you for awhile.\n\nThank you for being here.\n\nJASON COLLINS, RETIRED NBA PLAYER: Thank you for having me.\n\nHAYES: So, when you see what`s going on with this -- you know, we`ve got\n\nthe marriage case that`s going to come before the Supreme Court, this\n\nAlabama fight that`s happening, what is your feeling about where we are in\n\nthis sort of trajectory of progress?\n\nCOLLINS: It is a little frustrating when you see people fighting against\n\nchange. And some people are digging in their heels, and trying to find\n\nways around it, but I think ultimately marriage equality is going to be a\n\nfact in this country in all 50 states and slowly we`re on that path and\n\nobviously with the Supreme Court case that is coming up later, in a couple\n\nmonths, we`re looking forward to the outcome of that.\n\nHAYES: Did you -- do you -- I mean, when you made the decision to do what\n\nyou did, how did that alter the trajectory of your life?\n\nCOLLINS: My life is exponentially better in so many ways. I was able to\n\ngo out and play on the court. There is a picture here from my game,\n\nplaying at Denver, I think that was my third game back in the league.\n\nBut just being able to after the game is over, not having to hide who I am.\n\nIn some of the games, especially here in New York and Brooklyn, my\n\nboyfriend was here waiting in the family room just like everyone else`s\n\nloved one. And that`s how it should be. It`s -- you are able to have your\n\nprivate life and not feel like you have to hide anything and then you`re\n\nable to go out there and you know do your job and play your sport.\n\nHAYES: Did things change much? It seemed to me like it was largely was\n\nsrot a nonissue. Maybe that`s the wrong perception. From your standpoint,\n\nhow did if feel?\n\nCOLLINS: Well, it was a great -- a huge issue for some of my teammates.\n\nOne of my team mates in particular took time, especially in that first week\n\nthat I came back to pull me aside and just say this is going to be huge for\n\nthe country, it`s a great sports moment, and just how proud he was of me\n\nand how happy he was I was back in the league and that I was his team mate.\n\nAnd moments like that are incredible, especially now, you know, I have seen\n\nit now for Robbie Rogers for the L.A. Galaxy in the soccer and then in\n\ncollege with Derrick Gordon at UMass and more and more male athletes --\n\nbecause for so long -- a long time women were taking the lead. We had\n\nBillie Jean King and Martina Navratilova.\n\nAnd I`m so grateful and thankful for every athlete, male or female, who\n\ncame out. We`re all on the same team and making it easier or better for\n\nthe next generation.\n\nHAYES: Are there -- I wondered this as soon as you came out -- are there\n\ncloseted male athletes in this country who reach out to Jason Collins to\n\nsay what should I do?\n\nCOLLINS: Well, I don`t know -- not what should I do, but just -- yeah,\n\njust talk. And that`s sort of been my role when I was -- later in my\n\ncareer I was a mentor. And it`s just shifted, instead of mentoring young\n\ncenters about like OK...\n\nHAYES: How to give a foul?\n\nCOLLINS: Yeah, this is how you give a foul, this is how you take a charge,\n\nthis is how you flop -- now it`s like, OK, these are some good people, good\n\nresources to know, a good support system.\n\nAnd again, we can all -- you know, we talk about sports, talk about\n\nbasketball but then we also talk about their private lives and just how\n\nthey`re doing, trying to offer another level of support for them.\n\nHAYES: You know, it has always struck me that being, you know, 22-years-\n\nold, under tremendous pressure, with millions of dollars, and trying to\n\nhave any thing resembling a normal private romantic life regardless of\n\nwhether you`re straight or gay is hard enough.\n\nCOLLINS: Yeah, especially for a basketball player, because typically we\n\nare taller. So, you know, take myself for instance. I`m seven feet.\n\nHAYES: You stand out...\n\nCOLLINS: I do not blend in unless I`m out there on a basketball court,\n\nthat`s where I blend in.\n\nBut, you know, it is important for people to feel comfortable in their own\n\nskill and live their authentic life because it will alleviate stress.\n\nHAYES: Could we just talk for a second about how great this NBA season has\n\nbeen?\n\nCOLLINS: Yeah, it`s been incredible.\n\nHAYES: Yeah, I mean, it`s a fantastic season?\n\nCOLLINS: Yeah, and plus I`m a little partial to the Golden State Warrior,\n\nmy twin brother Jerin is an assistant coach with the Warriors. So he will\n\n-- he`s actually in town now. So, I`m looking forward to catching up with\n\nhim this weekend.\n\nHAYES: They are -- there is nothing -- I mean, if you love basketball,\n\nthere\n\nis nothing more beautiful, it`s like listening to like a Tchaikovsky\n\nsymphony or something, to watch the Golden State Warrior when they are\n\nturning it up, when they are firing on all cylinders.\n\nCOLLINS: Yeah, it`s amazing. It`s like a -- to those who play video game,\n\nit`s like NBA Jam when the guy is on fire, like some of the shots that\n\nSTeph Curry out there, and Clay Thompson too, and they have so many\n\nshooters.\n\nAnd then, you`ve got the Cleveland Cavaliers who are playing really well.\n\nAnd then you have the addition of Pau Gasol in Chicago, and that\n\ncombination that seems to be finally clicking with Derek Rose. So it`ll be\n\nfun to watch.\n\nAnd then how scary is this that you could have Oklahoma City or maybe even\n\nSan Antonio as an eight seed maybe or a seven seed. And it`s just like,\n\nyou know, who wants to play against them in the first round.\n\nHAYES: Do you think they should go -- there has been some interesting talk\n\nabout going to the best 16 teams as opposed to the best eight from each\n\nconference, because you end up -- it`s been so lopsided in the west for so\n\nlong.\n\nCOLLINS: I actually -- I`m a little bit mixed on this, because I played in\n\nthe Eastern Conference for all my 13 years in the NBA.\n\nHAYES: Probably on some on the bubble teams.\n\nCOLLINS: Yeah. There is one Nets team, we were about .500 and we ended up\n\ngoing to the playoffs, and -- I actually am in favor of just having the\n\nbest teams, because I think it`ll make the playoffs even better.\n\nHAYES: Jason Collins, it`s really, really a pleasure. This is the most\n\nimportant question, right.\n\nCOLLINS: Yes, let`s here it.\n\nHAYES: Can you get me tickets to the all-star game?\n\nCOLLINS: I know a guy who knows a guy.\n\nHAYES: All right, really a pleasure, man. Thank you very much.\n\nGreat to see you.\n\nAll right -- basketball game this weekend, in fact.\n\nAll right, there is parents who do vaccinate their kids, they`re parents\n\nwho don`t vaccinate their kids, and then there parents who delay\n\nvaccinating their kids and one of the doctors who helps justify doing he is\n\ngoing to join me ahead. Stick around for that.\n\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\nHAYES: Tonight there`s yet another case of adult measles, a person in the\n\nBay Area in Contra Costa County has contracted measles, that`s according to\n\nthe patient`s employer LinkedIn.\n\nOfficials at the professional social networking site say they are\n\ncooperating with local health officials. In fact, a person may have\n\nexposed fellow passengers on the BART rail service when the patient\n\ntraveled in and out of San Francisco between February 4 and February 6\n\naccording to health officials.\n\nMeanwhile, Wired.com has published this alarming chart from the California\n\nDepartment of Public health showing the measles vaccination rates at\n\nchildren of workers at various Silicon Valley companies. Those red lines\n\nshow day cares affiliated with Bay Area companies where less than 90\n\npercent of children have had up to date vaccines.\n\nThe day care centers that fall below this crucial herd immunity level of 90\n\npercent include some affiliated with Google, Cisco Systems, IBM, and Pixar.\n\nNow here`s the thing, up to date is a key phrase in this story, because\n\ndelaying vaccines is the real undercovered story of this measles outbreak.\n\nWe`ll have much more on that next.\n\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\nHAYES: Since the onset of the recent measles outbreak in this country,\n\nattention has largely focused on anti-vaccers, parents who don`t get their\n\nkids vaccinated at all, because of scientifically baseless fears.\n\nThat is a tiny part of the population.\n\nThere is a far larger group that includes thow who are delaying vaccines\n\nfor their children, because of shoddy non-scientific notions about, for\n\nexample, the danger of vaccines in combinations or in close succession, or\n\nthe effect of possible toxins.\n\nAt a recent congressional hearing, Senator Elizabeth Warren posed a series\n\nof questions to Dr. Anne Schuchat, director of the National Center for\n\nImmunization at the CDC. After dispensing with many of the concerns of\n\noutright antivaxxers, specifically point out the lack of scientific\n\nevidence linking vaccines to autism, mental disorders, allergies or\n\nautoimmune disorders, they moved on to some of the concerns more widely\n\nshared of vaccine delayers.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nSEN. ELIZABETH WARREN, (D) MASSACHUSETTS: Are there additives or\n\npreservatives in vaccines that can be toxic to kids?\n\nDR. ANNE SCHUCHAT, CDC: Not in the amounts that are in vaccines.\n\nWARREN; Is there any scientific evidence that giving kids their vaccines\n\nfurther apart or spacing them differently is healthier for kids?\n\nSCHUCHAT; No, it actually increases the risk period for children.\n\nWARREN: So it adds to the danger.\n\nIs there any scientific evidence that kids can develop immunity to these\n\ndiseases on their own simply by eating nutritious foods or being active?\n\nSCHUCHAT: No.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nHAYES: And yet one of the bestselling on children`s health on Amazon right\n\nnow is this: \"The Vaccine Book,\" which includes, quote, common sense\n\nsounding admonitions like, quote, \"vaccination isn`t an all or nothing\n\ndecision.\" And, quote, \"it is my goal to give you a balanced look, the pros\n\nand cons vaccination that you can make an educated decision.\"\n\nIn his book, Dr. Bob Sears offers up an alternative vaccine schedule where\n\nsome shots are delayed.\n\nDr. Sears has argued that, quote, \"spreading the shots out reduces the risk\n\nof having a severe reaction and avoids overloading babies with too many\n\nchemical\n\ningredients at one time.\"\n\nBut most doctors and scientists, including as you heard, top immunization\n\nofficials at the CDC, say there is no science behind the delayed schedule.\n\nAnd delaying vaccines is actually dangerous.\n\nI`m going to ask the author of The Vaccine Book, Dr. Bob Sears, why he is\n\npushing a program that is so widely condemned among his peers, next.\n\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\nHAYES: Joining me now the author of The Vaccine Book: Making the Right\n\nDecision for Your Child pediatrician Dr. Bob Sears.\n\nDoctor, thank you.\n\nI just wanted to be first about -- talk about sort of your qualifications\n\nhere. I mean, you`re a pediatrician, obviously, but you don`t publish in\n\nimmunology, or vaccines. You don`t research it, and you don`t study this\n\nprofessionally.\n\nDR. BOB SEARS, PEDIATRICIAN: Well, I give vaccines every day in my office,\n\nChris, so I have a lot of experience with them, certainly. And I spent\n\nyears, even decades even, researching medical journals. This all started\n\nback in medical school. I just hit the library and went from journal to\n\njournal trying to learn everything I could about vaccines.\n\nHAYES: Right, but you`re not publishing peer-reviewed work in this area?\n\nSEARS; No, I`m a full-time practicing pediatrician. I work every day in\n\nmy office, so no, I`m not a researcher, Chris.\n\nHAYES: So, where is the published peer-reviewed evidence to support the\n\nnotion of a, quote, overload if you follow the CDC recommended schedule?\n\nWhere does that exist?\n\nSEARS: Chris, I don`t think there is any such research, and I actually\n\nnever\n\nclaimed there was.\n\nI certainly have put out there very clearly in my writings that my\n\nprecautions on spreading out vaccines are theoretical. It`s a theoretical\n\nbenefit to kids and it`s a choice that I think a lot of parents feel more\n\ncomfortable about and might bring more parents to vaccinate if they can\n\nspread the shots out more than the regular schedule.\n\nHAYES: So, I`ve watched a number of your interviews. I`m sort of always\n\nconfused about whether you`re saying you`re doing this to make parents more\n\ncomfortable or you actually think there is something to it. And the most\n\ncynical interpretation is you`ve spotted a market opportunity to be the\n\nkind of sensible middle in the, quote, vaccine debate where you can sell a\n\nlot of books to people by basically telling them they have their cake and\n\neat it too. You`re not crazy for thinking this. Just delay. You can have\n\nthe best of both worlds.\n\nSEARS: Well, Chris, if you look back in the 80s when we were giving\n\nvaccines to children, we gave about eight vaccines back then. And I think\n\nalmost all parents complied. We felt it was really safe and you didn`t see\n\na lot of reactions.\n\nAnd then the `90s and 2000s, and now, Chris, that number has moved from\n\neight vaccines to 54 vaccines throughout all of childhood...\n\nHAYES: Right, within the first two years.\n\nSEARS: Some of these parents are simply just trying to question is this\n\nescalation too much for their little babies to handle. And they want to\n\nspread it out.\n\nHAYES: But what you`re saying there -- this is the thing I think I find,\n\nif you`ll excuse me, somewhat maddening about this is that throwing out\n\nthese numbers and saying they`re little babies reifies some notion that\n\nthey have to be scared of it when we have science for a reason. We have\n\npeer-reviewed research for a reason.\n\nWe know we can conduct peer-reviewed research on this. We have\n\nlongitudinal studies about the effects of these things.\n\nIf none of that turning up negative effects, aren`t you just feeding into\n\nthose fears? Isn`t this superstition?\n\nSEARS: Well, Chris, let`s look at data. Let`s look at Centers for Diseae\n\nControl data. As you may already know, about 2,000 severe reactions are\n\nreported to the Centers for Disease Control every year from vaccines, you\n\nknow, reactions that land someone in the hospital, create a permanent\n\ndisability or even death: 2,000, Chris.\n\nNow, I will also say that these are not proven reactions to the vaccines,\n\nthese are simply reported reactions. And what does the medical community\n\ndo with that? They simply ignore those reactions, because we can`t prove\n\nthat the vaccines cause these, we`re just going to set them aside and\n\nignore them. And I think that`s dangerous and it does a disservice.\n\nHAYES: Why is that dangerous? First of all, we`re talking about a cohort\n\nroughly every year of about 10 million kids, right. So 2,000 about of 10\n\nmillion kids, it`s 2,000 out of 2,500.\n\nSecond of all, if this is the concern, right, it seems to me that the\n\nprecautionary principle here is to get your kids vaccinated along the\n\nschedule that is supported by the best most current medical research\n\nevidence published and peer-reviewed, and then push for additional research\n\nin other areas. And if they additional researches turns something back,\n\nthen deviate from that.\n\nBut to tell people to delay their vaccines opens up to real harm that we\n\nare now seeing happen across this country.\n\nSEARS: Well, Chris, in my office I definitely don`t tell people delay any\n\nvaccines that pose a direct threat to their babies or their communities.\n\nYou know, I vaccinate for whopping cough on time, rotavirus. I delay the\n\nmeningitis vaccines by only one month, one month, Chris. I don`t think\n\nthat`s much of a delay. And I also recommend the measles vaccine at one\n\nyear and five years just as the CDC does.\n\nSo, I don`t delay anything that poses a direct threat.\n\nI delay some of the vaccines that don`t make sense, like Hepatitis b.\n\nThat`s a sexually transmitted infection. American babies don`t catch that.\n\nAnd when parents hear that my schedule is a little bit more logical and I`m\n\nnot forcing a vaccine that makes no sense down their throats, they tend to\n\nlisten to me and then want to follow that advice.\n\nHAYES: Let me just say on the Hepatitis B, there`s been a lot of sort of I\n\nthink muddying the waters -- the CDC changed the Hepatitis B recommendation\n\nbecause they found that day care centers were a site of transmission of the\n\ndisease precisely because there were larger populations of people that were\n\nnot vaccinated in those areas.\n\nBut Dr. Bob Sears, thank you for coming on the show. I really do\n\nappreciate you coming on.\n\nSEARS: All right. Thanks for having me on, Chris.\n\nHAYES: Let`s turn to Dr. Corey Hebert, assistant professor at the\n\nLouisiana State health sciences center in Tulane University, also CEO of\n\ncommunity health TV.\n\nAnd Dr. Hebert, I know you do do some research and work in this area. This\n\nidea -- I mean, there is an intuitive appeal of delay meningitis by a\n\nmonth. So what`s so bad about that?\n\nDR. COREY HEBERT, LSU HEALTH SCIENCES CENTER: Well, there are a couple of\n\nthings here. And what we must always realize is that this is based on\n\npreferences. Dr. Sears is a great guy. And -- but it`s all based on\n\npreferences.\n\nSo when we think about parental preferences, we`re -- they`re based on\n\nemotion and they`re based on science. So, really, bogus scientific data\n\nhas no place in evidence-based medicine in the United States. We know that\n\nof 4 million kids will get combination vaccines this year alone, and it`s\n\n1.1 in 1 million will have a serious adverse event or vaccine injury.\n\nNow let`s think about this very clearly, because the odds of you taking an\n\naspirin and having an intercerbral hemorrhage are much greater than a\n\nvaccine injury. And we mentioned -- Dr. Sears mentioned the fact that\n\nthere is a registry. It`s called VARS (ph). And people can report vaccine\n\ninjury and vaccine adverse reactions to this. Not only can doctors do it,\n\nbut parents can do it, teachers can do it and there is really no cause and\n\neffect, because if I get a flu vaccine, and then I walk out onto the street\n\nand get hit by a car, that is listed in that VARS (ph) system. So, that\n\ndidn`t mean anything.\n\nHAYES: Let me tell you about VARS (ph), I`ll give you an honest moment.\n\nMy first daughter -- we took her to some set of shots. And sure, it`s\n\nupsetting to watch your little infant kid get shots. And she was sort of\n\nacting kind of like -- she was in a bad mood afterwards and the thought\n\ntotally 100 percent flitted across my mind, because all this stuff out\n\nthere, like oh, man, was it the vaccine? Was it the shot? And I can\n\nimagine if she got sick, self reporting that even if there is absolutely no\n\npossible provable scientific connection between the two.\n\nHEBERT: Exactly.\n\nAnd what happens is everybody wants the best for their kids. So, let`s\n\njust think about this. When is the last time a 25 to 35-year-old man or\n\nwoman saw\n\nsomeone limping around America because they got polio. When the last time\n\nsomebody saw that? So, they don`t know the scourge of illness. Without\n\nvaccination and sanitation America would not even be here. So, let`s talk\n\nabout that.\n\nBecause we know that the delayed vaccination thing, let`s -- you can`t base\n\nyour whole livelihood on bogus science. We know that Dr. Andrew Wakefield\n\nproduced this study in 1998. And I`m talking to you right now as a parent,\n\nand as a doctor, and as a researcher. When I was in training when that\n\ncame out in 1998 and I had a newborn kid. So, I was like, man, what do I\n\ndo?\n\nBut what did I do? I looked at the data and I saw that this was bogus.\n\nThis dude got $600,000 from lawyers to sue the vaccine manufacturers. So,\n\nthat is the only guy that ever came out with that.\n\nSo, and then you have got Jenny McCarthy coming out saying that. And so\n\nshe got her degree at Playboy University. So, you can`t even justify her\n\ncoming out writing three books on this thin.\n\nSo, I`m trying to disparage anybody here, Chris, but what I am telling you\n\nis that we must keep this in proportion.\n\nAnd I want to say one more thing about this measles, mumps, rubella shot.\n\nEverybody is freaking out about the measles, but let`s think about MMR\n\nstands for measles, mumps and rubella. If a boy does not get the shot, and\n\nhe gets the mumps, he can get orchitis which can cause him to be sterile\n\nand not be able to have children. Also, if a lady does not have her\n\nrubella shot, then she can have stillborn child if she gets rubella.\n\nSo, the point is that this is much bigger than just the measles, this is a\n\nfar -- has much broader implications here.\n\nHAYES: And there is also a collection action problem here, just to end on\n\nthis note, which is that if you think, well, these diseases basically don`t\n\naffect anyone anymore, and individually I can make the freerider decision\n\nbecause I feel kind of icky about it, well, enough people do that and you\n\nyou know what you get, you measles at Disneyland.\n\nDr. Corey Hebert, thank you very much\n\nHEBERT: There you go. Thank you.\n\nHAYES: All right, that is ALL IN for this evening. \"THE RACHEL MADDOW\n\nSHOW\" starts right now.\n\nTHIS IS A RUSH TRANSCRIPT.
