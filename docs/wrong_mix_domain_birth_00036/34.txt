Portland, Maine is the largest city in the state, with about 40 percent of Maine residents living in the greater Portland metropolitan area. With all its attractions and amenities, it’s no wonder. Named American’s “Restaurant City of the Year” by Bon Appetit, Portland is also an arts-embracing, health-conscious, family-friendly city that is surrounded by water on three sides.
