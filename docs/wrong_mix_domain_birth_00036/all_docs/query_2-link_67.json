        "text": "Coastal has a beautiful facility to deliver care, and even better doctors and nurses. Dr. Andrews has a calming and professional demeanor and is extremely knowledgeable on women's health. When I am at Coastal I know I am in good hands. All the women in my family see Coastal for their OB-GYN care and we have referred many friends here as well. I highly recommend Coastal if you are in search of a new OB-GYN.\n\nI was referred to Coastal Women's Healthcare for a large uterine fibroid, and had the pleasure of connecting with Dr. Josh Sinkin. Having avoided doctors' offices for more than 10 years, I wasn't sure what to expect. Dr. Sinkin instantly quelled my fears with his terrifically positive energy, modern take on medicine & healing (making room for holistic healing methods, which are important to me), and his compassion. I ended up opting for surgery --- a last resort for me. Dr. Sinkin and his team did an AMAZING job. I was fully healed in two weeks and am now feeling better than I have in years. (Not to mention lighter! That fibroid was huge!)\n\nMy experiences at Coastal Women's Healthcare have all been positive. All staff members have been friendly and attentive. The facility is welcoming and well laid out and I have never had a long wait. Most importantly, I am extremely satisfied with my doctor's approachability, level of knowledge, and genuinely caring manner. I have never felt rushed or felt that the service I received was cut short due to insurance mandates.\n\nDr. Carla Burkley was absolutely amazing! I had my first children with her! I was a wreck, and a mess hormonally all threw my pregnancy! And she was by my side very step of the way! I was pregnant with twins so there were a lot of complications and she scheduled my c-section checked in on me and assured everything was fine! Absolutely amazing.\n\nI've been a patient for 6 years. They are so supportive and wonderful. Dr. Slager goes out of her way to make you feel important. The other doctors are great too. When my son was born via emergency c-section, my doctor wasn't on call to do the delivery, but she came to see me the next day. They have always been great about getting you in if you have concerns or advising a trip to the hospital if you need it. I would recommend them ten times over\n\nI've been a frequent patient at Coastal Women's for over a year after a recommendation from a friend and have received ongoing exemplary care from all providers I've seen in the clinic. Recently I had my first IUD insertion by Dr. Sinkin, which included an incredibly thorough consult from the doctor, including information I had never been provided by other doctors in past practices. Dr. Sinkin's immense compassion, communication and support gave me the confidence I needed to go through with the procedure quickly and easily, and to really change my life for the better. Many thanks to Dr. Sinkin and to all the nursing staff. I cannot recommend them all more highly!\n\nI have been a patient of Dr. Shinners for 15 years since I was a teenager in high school. I could not ask for a better OBGYN. 9 years ago I was diagnosed with an issue that needed to be fixed before I could ever have children. Dr. Shinners sent me to a specialist but before I could have the surgery done I became pregnant. I 100% believe Dr. Shinners helped keep my baby alive and growing. We had complications, hospitalizations, and many office visits. She walked me through everything, kept me informed, and made sure I knew all possible outcomes. My baby was born at 39.1 weeks happy and healthy! Dr. Shinners was not on that day but showed up bright and early the day after delivery to see my daughter. Now, I am currently going through IVF for infertility and again Dr. Shinners has helped me through the entire process up to my recent miscarriage. Her and her nurse Amy exceed all expectations of a Dr. and Nurse! I highly recommend Dr. Shinners and Coastal Women's to anyone in need of excellent care!"
