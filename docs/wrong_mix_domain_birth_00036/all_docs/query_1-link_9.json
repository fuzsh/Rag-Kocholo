My four survivingÂ children from oldest to youngest are Mimiques, Gesig, Mishun,Â and Ziâgwan.Â I remember spending many of my youngerÂ days in the woods of Chapman, Maine. I was only about fiveÂ years old; when walking in the woods one day, I could hearÂ a rustling sound coming from the trees. I looked up, and asked them if they wanted me to sing to them; their leaves rustled in agreement. As I sang to them their leaves swayed to and fro. This is my earliest memory singing with nature.Â I sing to Mother Earth still. Life has been a tremendous struggle from the day was born, but I continued to love life, it has been, and still is a beautiful journey; filled with moments of pain, but even more, so many moments of pure light and love. I am thankful for everyday.Â\n\nÂ\n\nJennifer Pictou (Miâkmaq) is a member of the Miâkmaq Nation (formerly the Aroostook Band of Micmac).
