It was the middle of Grunge, but Jackylâs loud, proud and unapologetic rock songs, produced by Brendan OâBrien (Stone Temple Pilots, AC/DC), earned the LP double-platinum status. (And helped land the band a scene-stealing spot on Woodstock â94.) Videos for the singles \"The Lumberjack\" (with Jesse James Dupree performing his iconic chainsaw solo), \"I Stand Alone,â \"Down On Me,\" \"Dirty Little Mind,\" \"When Will It Rain\" and \"Back Off Brother\" earned rave reviews and rabid fans for the bandâs no-holds-barred energy and lyrics. Â\n\nOn August 11, 2022â30 years to the day of Jackylâs debutâthe lineup plays Sturgis, South Dakotaâs Full Throttle Saloon, in a raucous celebration of the lineupâs 30th anniversary that also marks the debut of the quartetâs brand-new album, Jackyl 30 Coming In Hot and first single, âGet All Up In It.âÂ Â\n\nâJeff, Chris and Roman coming down on the âoneâ together is still a force of nature,â says Dupree. âThirty years together and I feel weâve found an honest place about our new music, our fans and us as a band, on and offstage.â\n\nJackyl 30 Coming In Hot, which also includes the new tunes âBad Decisionâ and âAnother Round (Coming in Hot)â is only the latest highpoint of the Southern-bred bandâs career. From the get-go, Jackyl were unafraid to stand up for free speech; their âI Stand Aloneâ video featured the band performing in front of a K-Mart as a protest for the store refusing to sell their album.Â Other bold moves? Dupree entered a Longhorn Steakhouse with a chainsaw to âsurpriseâ a group of influential radio programmers. That generated a class-action lawsuit that reportedly cost the band more than $1 million.\n\nBut the ever-growing legion of fans loved Jackylâs songs and antics, helping 1994âs Push Comes to Shove album go platinum, thanks in part to the singles \"Push Comes to Shove\" and \"Headed for Destruction.â 1993 saw âMental *@%.!â featured on The Beavis & Butt-head Experience, a compilation album of songs tied in with MTVâs hit cartoon series; it was eventually certified triple platinum.\n\nHitting the road non-stop, Jackylâs tour mates in those early days included Aerosmith, KISS, ZZ Top, Ted Nugent and Damn Yankees. One of the biggest audiences? Jackylâs performance at Woodstock 94. The appearance made national news and featured on late night shows, including Late Night with David Letterman. The double-album Woodstock 94 went platinum and included âHeaded For Destructionâ (a track from Push Comes To Shove).\n\nAnother groundbreaking musical moment came in 1996. Jackyl followed A&R legend John Kalodner (who had signed them to Geffen) to Sony Musicâs Epic Records. The resultant record, 1997âs Cut the Crap was produced by Mike Fraser (AC/DC, Metallica) and mixed by Kevin Shirley (silverchair, Aerosmith). The rock radio hit âLocked and Loadedâ included guest vocals by AC/DCâs Brian Johnson. It was the first time Johnson had recorded with any artist but AC/DC since joining the band 17 years earlier.\n\nA collection of B-sides titled Stayinâ Alive appeared on Shimmering Tone Records in 1998, but the biggest highlight of the year was Geffenâs release of the best-of collection Choice Cuts and the related promotional events Jackyl did to promote it. Always reaching higher, in 1998 Jackyl set not one but two Guinness World Records by playing 100 shows in 50 daysâ¦. and 21 shows in 24 hours. The daytime sets were 45 minutes long; the evening gigs were between 90 and 120 minutes of rock mayhem.\n\nThe bandâs 2002 Relentless LP contained the second collaboration with Brian Johnson, the raucous rocker âKill the Sunshine.â The following year, Universal Music/Geffen Records issued a Jackyl volume as part of its acclaimed â20th Century Masters â The Millennium Collectionâ best-of series. In 2004, the long-awaited Live at the Full Throttle Saloon CD and DVD was released by Sanctuary Records. It was recorded and filmed in the summer of 2003 in Sturgis, South Dakota, as part of the legendary annual biker rally.\n\nItâs a festival close to the bandâs heart, and from 2009 - 2015 Dupree became one of the lead characters of the hit reality TV show Full Throttle Saloon. Of course, that didnât stop Jackyl from touring and recording, and in 2010 the band released When Moonshine and Dynamite Collide, which featured DMC from Run-D.M.C.\n\nItâs been three decades since Jackyl shot out of Georgia spewing equal parts hard rock, heavy metal and Southern rock. Theyâve never stopped touring or recording, and with 9.2 million views (and growing) ofÂ âLumberjack Songâ on YouTube, the quartet are earning rabid new fans daily. The August 2022 release of Jackyl 30 Coming In Hot cements and furthers Jackylâs no-holds-barred legacy. Or as Dupree, with his unquenchable energy, exclaims, âThirty years on and weâre still celebrating the fundamentals of rock ânâ roll, so Get All Up In It!â\n\nÂ\n\nDISCOGRAPHY\n\n1992 JackylÂ Â\n\n1994 Push Comes to ShoveÂ Â\n\n1997 Cut the CrapÂ Â Â Â\n\n1998 Stayin' AliveÂ Â Â Â Â\n\n2002 RelentlessÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â\n\n2010 When Moonshine and Dynamite CollideÂ\n\n2012 Best in ShowÂ Â Â Â\n\n2016 Rowyco\n\n2022 Jackyl 30 Coming In HotÂ Â Â Â Â\n\nVIP Meet & Greet tickets available at https://www.americanaquarium.com/vip\n\nAmerican Aquarium â The Fear of Standing Still\n\nFor nearly two decades, American Aquarium have pushed toward that rare form of rock-and-roll\n\nthatâs revelatory in every sense. âFor us the sweet spot is when youâve got a rock band that makes\n\nyou scream along to every word, and itâs not until youâre coming down at three a.m. that you realize\n\nthose words are saying something real about your life,â says frontman BJ Barham. âThatâs what\n\nmade us fall in love with music in the first place, and thatâs the goal in everything we do.â On their\n\nnew album The Fear of Standing Still, the North Carolina-bred band embody that dynamic with more\n\nintensity than ever before, endlessly matching their gritty breed of country-rock with Barhamâs\n\nbravest and most incisive songwriting to date. As he reflects on matters both personal and\n\nsocioculturalâe.g., the complexity of Southern identity, the intersection of generational trauma and\n\nthe dismantling of reproductive rightsâAmerican Aquarium instill every moment of The Fear of\n\nStanding Still with equal parts unbridled spirit and illuminating empathy.\n\nRecorded live at the legendary Sunset Sound in Los Angeles, The Fear of Standing Still marks\n\nAmerican Aquariumâs second outing with producer Shooter Jenningsâa three-time Grammy\n\nwinner who also helmed production on 2020âs critically lauded Lamentations, as well as albums from\n\nthe likes of Brandi Carlile and Tanya Tucker. In a departure from the stripped-down subtlety of\n\n2022âs Chicamacomico (a largely acoustic rumination on grief), the bandâs tenth studio LP piles on\n\nplenty of explosive riffs and hard-charging rhythms, bringing a visceral energy to the most nuanced\n\nand poetic of lyrics. âIn our live show the bandâs like a freight train that never lets up, and for this\n\nrecord I really wanted to showcase how big and anthemic we can be,â notes Barham, whose\n\nbandmates include guitarist Shane Boeker, pedal-steel guitarist Neil Jones, keyboardist Rhett\n\nHuffman, drummer Ryan Van Fleet, and bassist Alden Hedges.\n\nMixed by four-time Grammy winner Trina Shoemaker (Queens of the Stone Age, Emmylou Harris),\n\nThe Fear of Standing Still shares its title with one of the first songs Barham wrote for the albumâa\n\nsoul-baring look at how raising a family has radically altered his priorities and perspective. In the\n\nprocess of creating what he refers to as âa record about growing up and growing older,â Barham\n\nalso found his songwriting closely informed by his ten years of sobriety, as well as his ever-\n\ndeepening connection with American Aquariumâs community of fans. âWhenever someone tells me\n\nthat one of our songs helped them in some way, it encourages me to be more and more\n\nopenâalmost like peeling a layer off an onion,â he says. âThis album is a writer 18 years into his\n\ncareer, peeling away the next layer and seeing just how human we can make this thing.â\n\nExpanding on the raw vitality of previous albums like 2012âs Jason Isbell-produced Burn.Flicker.Die,\n\nThe Fear of Standing Still kicks offs with âCrierâ: a gloriously ferocious track that swiftly obliterates\n\nworn-out ideals of masculine behavior. âItâs a song about breaking down what many of us learned\n\nfrom our fathers growing upâthis idea that boys donât cry, or that crying is a form of weakness,â\n\nsays Barham, who co-wrote âCrierâ with singer/songwriter Stephen Wilson Jr. âI wanted to send\n\nthe message that itâs not natural to bottle everything up inside, because all of us are meant to feel.â\n\nFueled by a savage and soaring vocal performance from Barham, the result is a perfect encapsulation\n\nof American Aquariumâs multilayered artistry. âI donât think anyoneâs going to get through that first\n\nlisten of âCrierâ and think, âWow, what a great song about disrupting the cycle of toxic masculinity!ââ\n\nBarham points out. âIt seems more likely that itâll make them want to dance and jump around, and\n\nthen when they put the headphones on and listen a little closer to the lyrics, thatâs when theyâll start\n\nto understand what weâre talking about.â\n\nA resolutely outspoken artist whoâs emerged as one of the most progressive voices in country music,\n\nBarham infuses an element of trenchant social commentary into a number of tracks on The Fear of\n\nStanding Still. On âSouthern Roots,â for instance, Georgia-born singer/songwriter Katie Pruitt joins\n\nAmerican Aquarium for a spellbinding meditation on pushing against the boundaries of traditional\n\nSouthern identity. âPeople can complain all they want about how backwards the South is, but the\n\nonly way weâll see any change is to take it upon ourselves,â says Barham. âFor me, that means raising\n\nmy daughter so that sheâll never witness the closed-mindedness and blatant disrespect for certain\n\npeople that I often saw at her age. Because if you really love something the way I love the South,\n\nthen you want to see it grow.â Co-written by Barham and Pruitt, âSouthern Rootsâ starts off as a\n\nbeautifully understated folk song graced with heavenly harmonies, then builds to a reverb-drenched\n\nfrenzy at the bridgeâa shift that sharply intensifies the trackâs galvanizing power.\n\nAnother song anchored in Barhamâs ardent belief in breaking generational patterns, âBabies Having\n\nBabiesâ arrives as a finespun piece of storytelling that doubles as an emphatic pro-choice anthem.\n\nâItâs a mix of fiction and personal experience, and felt like an important story to tell at a time when a\n\nwomanâs right to choose is being taken away,â says Barham. After opening on a nostalgic tale of a\n\nwhirlwind summer romance, âBabies Having Babiesâ slowly takes on a powerful urgency as the\n\nnarrative turns to questions of consequence and self-preservation (from the second verse: âWe\n\npacked up a bag and drove to the city/Shouldered through the pickets and the hand-painted\n\nsigns/They called her names while they called themselves Christians/That sort of hateâs got no place\n\nin any faith of mineâ). âI grew up in a small and very conservative town where abortion was not an\n\noption, so I saw a lot of people trapped in that generational cycle of getting pregnant at a young age\n\nand ending up stuck in the same town forever instead of following whatever dreams they might have\n\nhad,â says Barham. âI wanted to write about what could have happened if one of those girls had\n\nrefused to give up her aspirations, and made that choice to live another way.â\n\nWhile American Aquarium bring a lived-in intimacy to all of The Fear of Standing Still, songs like\n\nâCherokee Purplesâ encompass a particularly tender emotionality. A wistful reminiscence of all the\n\ncharmed and wild summers of Barhamâs youth, the track unfolds in so many gorgeously detailed\n\nimages (kudzu vines and fireflies, menthol cigarettes and Big League Chew), each rendered with a\n\nloving specificity that lingers in the listenerâs heart. ââCherokee Purplesâ came from me making a\n\ntomato sandwich in my kitchen, and immediately getting taken back to all the summer days when\n\nweâd get dropped off at my grandmotherâs so my parents could go to work,â says Barham. âItâs\n\ncrazy how something as simple as a tomato sandwich with Dukeâs Mayonnaise can take me to a\n\nwhole other world, but to me itâs almost like a talisman of where Iâm from and how I was raised.â\n\nMeanwhile, on âThe Curse of Growing Old,â American Aquarium look to the other end of the life\n\nspectrum, conjuring a life-affirming mood despite the songâs excruciating honesty. âI wrote that\n\nafter talking with my grandmother at her 92 nd birthday party and learning what it was like for her to\n\ngrow older and watch so many people in her life pass away,â says Barham. âItâs true that getting\n\nolder is a gift, but itâs a gift we pay for with an incredible amount of loss.â\n\nFor Barham, the sharing of hard truths is indelibly tied to his sense of devotion to American\n\nAquariumâs audienceâand to his belief in rock-and-roll as a singularly unifying force. âAll I really\n\nwant to do is put words to the emotions that most people have a difficult time expressing on their\n\nown,â he reveals. âNo matter what that emotion is, when you put it into a song and then get to\n\nthose moments when a whole bunch of people are singing that song all together, it makes you see\n\nthat youâre part of something bigger than you ever realized. Thatâs when you can really affect\n\npeopleâs lives, and to me this record is another stepping stone to making that a reality.â\n\nâOur band has so many different sides and personalities to it,â says Boy Named Banjoâs Barton Davies. âOne minute we might be singing bluegrass harmonies around a condenser mic, and the next weâve got these big, distorted guitars and pounding, rock and roll drums. This album feels like the first time weâve been able to capture it all at once, the first time weâve been able to bottle that live energy and share it on a record.â\n\nDusk,Â Boy Named Banjoâs exhilarating new album, is indeed an electrifying dose of lightning in a bottle, one that explores the full sonic and emotional spectrum of the bandâs rich, eclectic sound, from late-night, feel-good, fall-in-love party anthems to stripped-down, introspective meditations on loneliness, loss, and letting go. The writing is keen and incisive here, artfully grappling with lust and longing, hope and heartbreak, regret and redemption, and the Nashville five-pieceâs performances are nothing short of exhilarating, blurring the lines between Music Row and Laurel Canyon with lush harmonies and bold, cinematic arrangements. The result is a masterfully crafted, larger-than-life major label debut from a band that continues to grow by leaps and bounds with every release, an ambitious, emotional whirlwind that embraces the bitter with the sweet at every turn.\n\nâWe wanted to make a big statement with our first full-length release on Mercury,â says guitarist William Reames. âOur influences have always been really broad and our sound has always been really wide-ranging, and we didnât want to shy away from that. At the end of the day, this is who we are.â\n\nLaunched while Davies and Reames were still just students in high school, Boy Named Banjo got its start busking on the streets of Nashville, where a passing tourist inadvertently named the group by yelling, âPlay that banjo, boy!â as Davies picked outside Robertâs Western World. Performing initially as a trio with fellow classmate Willard Logan on mandolin, the group began life as an old-school string band, but their sound quickly evolved into something more adventurous with the addition of bassist Ford Garrard and drummer Sam McCullough, who joined after returning home from college.\n\nâWeâre not a band that just got thrown together in the studio,â explains Reames, who splits songwriting and vocal duties with Davies. âWeâre a group of best friends whoâve been doing this together since we were kids, and it shows in our music. Weâve spent a lot of time finding ourselves and our sound.â\n\nThat evolution is plain to hear across the groupâs remarkable catalog. Their bare bones, self-released 2012 debut,Â The Tanglewood Sessions, helped earn the band a spot at Bonnaroo, while their more fleshed-out 2014 follow-up,Â Long Story Short, led to festival slots everywhere from Hangout to Dierks Bentleyâs Seven Peaks, and their pop-tinged 2021 EP,Â Circles, landed them performances at the Ryman and the Grand Ole Opry alongside dates supporting the likes of Kip Moore, Hank Williams, Jr., Old Crow Medicine Show, and the Cadillac Three. With their star on the rise, the obvious next step might have been to chase a hit single at country radio, but Boy Named Banjo had bigger plans.\n\nâWe tour too much to live off one song at a time,â says bassist Ford Garrard, âso we decided to just quietly start cutting a full album on our own.â\n\nWorking out of a series of makeshift studios with longtime collaborator Oscar Charles (Charlie Worsham, Chase Rice), the band began laying down what would becomeÂ DuskÂ in secret,Â experimenting with new sounds and recording techniques as they chased the freewheeling excitement and undeniable emotional impact of their live shows.\n\nâWe probably could have gotten canned for going rogue like that,â Reames confesses, âbut when we invited our team to hear what weâd been working on, everybody came around and got onboard.â\n\nTake a listen to album opener âSomething âBout A Sunsetâ and itâs easy to hear why. âSomething âbout a sunset / Just before the world goes dark,â Davies sings over pulsating drums, his voice reveling in the promise of new love and infinite possibility. âThe stars in your eyes / A fire in my heart.â Like much of the album, the track works its way to a soaring, ecstatic crescendo, rising and falling until it loses itself in a moment of complete and utter transcendence. The rousing âYoung Foreverâ celebrates the joy in letting go and being present, while the explosive âHeart Attackâ mixes rock muscle with country twang as it embraces the euphoria of lust and infatuation, and the rollicking âWhiskey Dreamsâ leaves its troubles and worries by the wayside.\n\nâA lot of the tunes on this album are drinking songs,â says Davies, âthe kind of thing youâd want to hear at a show with a beer in your hand. But on a deeper level, there are warning signs, all these little red flags you might be willing to ignore because youâre young and in love and having fun.â\n\nEvery party has to end sometime, and byÂ Dusksâs conclusion, the writing is on the wall. The tender âGoodbyes Are Sadâ aims to make peace with the inevitable, no matter how painful it may be; the resilient âLonely In This Townâ picks up the pieces after being left behind; and the aching âOpposite Directionsâ closes the album by cutting its losses and walking away.\n\nâWe wanted these songs to take you on a journey,â Davies explains. âYou start out soaking in a sunset with someone you think youâll be with forever, and by the end, youâre going your separate ways and coming to terms with heartbreak and moving on.â\n\nRather than tying things up neatly,Â DuskÂ ends on something of a cliffhanger, dangling by a thread in the face of the messy, complicated, confusing reality of growing up, of falling in and out of love all in the same night. But donât worry: this storyâs far from over, and Boy Named Banjoâs just getting started. Stay tuned for the next chapterâ¦\n\nA 7-foot clown walks into a bar. He motions for a soda water and sits there staring at his drink. The year was 1998 and Puddles had wandered into the Star Community Bar in Atlanta, GA where bartender Big Mike Geier first laid eyes on the sad, silent clown.\n\nâThere was a heaviness about him,â says Geier. âI could tell he wasnât in the mood to chat, so I pretty much left him alone except to pass him the mustard when he pulled an onion and a heel of bread out of his pocket. A couple weeks later, he came by the bar and gave me a flyer to a show he was doing at a flea market. The sound system at that flea market was crap, but his voice was something else. Iâve been in my share of bands and wasnât expecting much from a clown singing karaoke from a boombox. But Iâll be damned if his singing didnât get me all choked up.â\n\nThe two soon became close friends, with Big Mike acting somewhat as a confidant, and the pair travel all over with Puddles Pity Party, Mike speaking on behalf of Puddles since the clown chooses to stay silent.\n\nOriginally from River City before kicking around Atlanta, the sulking serenader gained momentum after hitting the road as guest performer on the 2010 Aqua Teen Hunger Force Live tour and 2013 Eels tour and making special appearances at Seattleâs Teatro ZinZanni and NYCâs Sleep No More.\n\nIt was Halloween 2013 when Puddles then collaborated with Postmodern Jukebox to record an epic version of Lordeâs hit song âRoyals,â which instantly went viral on YouTube, having received over 34 million views so far. You may also recognize Puddles as quarter-finalist from Season 12 of Americaâs Got Talent and most recently on AGTâs The Champions 2020. Â The âsad clown with the golden voiceâ has captivated audiences and media from around the world, building a fan base of more than 495,000 on Facebook and nearly 900,000 subscribers to the Puddles Pity Party YouTube channel.\n\nPuddles has since performed around the planet, garnering rave reviews at festivals like Edinburgh Fringe, Adelaide Fringe, Perth Fringe, Melbourne International Comedy Fest, Belgiumâs Gent Fest, Just For Laughs, Festival Supreme, Outside Lands, SketchFest and the Kennedy Centerâs District of Comedy Festival. And he has sold out shows all over from Palace of Fine Arts in San Francisco, Revolution Hall in Portland, The Fonda in L.A., The Vic Chicago, Wilbur Theatre Boston, Gramercy Theatre NYC and Soho Theatre London. Puddles was a feature performer in La Soireeâs 2014 Southbank show in London, which won the Olivier Award. He was handpicked by Neil Patrick Harris to perform Just for Laughâs âCircus Awesomeus,â gala filmed for HBO Canada and in 2019, he enjoyed a Las Vegas residency at Caesars Palace.\n\nIn 2020, with touring and live concerts halted in the wake of the pandemic, Puddles stayed busy producing more than a dozen episodes of his Still Sequestered Show, a musical variety show online series that features lots of special guests like Jack Black, Weird Al, Penn Jillette, Tim Heidecker, Mark Ryden, Neil Hamburger, Rebekah Del Rio, Sid Krofft, Michael Des Barres, Petra Haden, David Dastmalchian, Cait OâRiordan, Michael Stipe, Patton Oswalt, Nicole Atkins, El Vez, Mastodon, Amy LaVere, Jake La Botz and Jolie Holland. You can watch these episodes via the Video On Demand page of this website.\n\nIn 2022, Puddles performed a duet with the iconic Eric Idle inÂ Homeward Bound: A Grammy Salute to the Songs of Paul SimonÂ filmed for CBS and was a surprise guest on the Season 4 finale of ABCâsÂ The Conners. He also toured with Tenacious D and landed the coveted John Lewis Holiday advert in the UK with a cover of âAll the Small Thingsâ that he recorded with Postmodern Jukebox. In 2023, Puddles was a performer on The Joco Cruise and later that year, Puddles sang âMaids Canât Mop Up Memoriesâ on Neil Hamburgerâs star-studded album Seasonal Depression Suite. Another notable Neil, Mr. Gaiman, featured Puddles as guest performer in his specially curated gala for The Art of Elysium in Los Angeles in 2024. And Toolâs Maynard James Keenan invited Puddles to perform on stage with him during the Sessanta Tour.\n\nâPuddles gives an emotive performance that resonates with all kinds of folks,â says Geier. âThe crowd really responds to him. Thereâs something about a giant sad singing clown that comforts us, letâs us know itâs ok to feel, to show our feelings. Itâs a sad and beautiful world, and weâre all in it together, even when weâre totally alone.â"
