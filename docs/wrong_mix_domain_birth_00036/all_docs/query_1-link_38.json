        "text": "July 26, 2024 (Friday): Rhiannon Giddens click for details\n\nThis Show Helps Support our Local Food Pantry ...A portion of every ticket goes to the Local Food Pantry And in addition, SMAC will donate 10% of our dinner biz that night to our friends at the Food Pantry in Brownfield. No better gift than having Rhiannon and having our food pantry supported too! A big Win Win.\n\nAbout Rhiannon\n\nRhiannon has been coming to SMAC since her days with the Carolina Chocolate Drops. Since then her fame is risen ten fold and frankly I can't believe she still comes to our humble hall and by that we are humbled. Rhiannon Giddens has made a singular, iconic career out of stretching her brand of folk music, with its miles-deep historical roots and contemporary sensibilities, into just about every field imaginable. A two-time GRAMMY Award-winning singer and instrumentalist, MacArthur Genius grant recipient, and composer of opera, ballet, and film, Giddens has centered her work around the mission of lifting up people whose contributions to American musical history have previously been overlooked or erased, and advocating for a more accurate understanding of the countrys musical origins through art.\n\nOh and did we mention she was the 2023 Pulitzer Prize Winner in Music along with Michael Abels for Omar\" an opera drawing inspiration from the 1831 autobiography of Omar ibn Said, beginning long before the West African scholar was forced to board a ship bound for Charleston, South Carolina  the site of his initial enslavement.\n\nAs Pitchfork once said, few artists are so fearless and so ravenous in their explorationa journey that has led to NPR naming her one of its 25 Most Influential Women Musicians of the 21st Century and to American Songwriter calling her one of the most important musical minds currently walking the planet. There is a lot here to unpack about Rhiannon when it comes to talent, creativity and musical stewardship..but we would like to add what a down to earth and sweet gal she has always been to us. Here with her band, we are honored.\n\nThis night will also help support ourlocal Food Pantry that seems so hard hit these last few years. Once a year we choose a show to support the Food pantry and we are super happy to partner with Rhiannon to do so.\n\n* Because of the fund raising nature of this show we ask no membership passes, gift certificates or credits be applicable for this show.\n\nJuly 27, 2024 (Saturday): Bill Kirchen Band click for details\n\nwith special guest guitarist Duke Levine\n\nUpon tallying how many decades hes worked as a professional guitar slinger, Telecaster master Bill Kirchen quips, Well, they don't make 50 years like they used to. They dont often make careers like his, either. You hard core Commander Cody fans will know him as the the guy who made Hot Rod Lincoln famous. Kirchen is reported to be one of the musicians that pioneered the Americana radio format and is a founding father of the \"twangcore movement\" which includes Dave Alvin, Wilco and Big Sandy & His Fly-Rite Boys. Kirchen's signature sound has been dubbed \"dieselbilly\" and incorporates elements of country music, blues, rockabilly, Western swing and boogie-woogie, laced with themes of American truck driving music. These days his songwriting could not be more vital. And I should put a YouTube here with one of his more recent songs from his so latest and greatest. But geez, I gotta remind you of who this amazing tall drink of water is. So here he is, earnin' his paycheck above and beyond.\n\nFlying alongside some of the planets coolest cats  including the Jesus of Cool, Nick Lowe, and Elvis Costello, Bill has been everywhere. We are honored to be one of those wheres and be able to call him a dear friend. Speaking of friends, Bill says, \"One of my favorite people and players on the planet, Duke has temporarily escaped his handlers with Bonnie Raitt and Peter Wolf, and will join us at SMAC .\n\nJuly 28, 2024 (Sunday): Lori McKenna click for details\n\nSinger/songwriter Lori McKenna has been nominated and won a Grammy, along with scores of country music awards for her songwriting. Penning hits for the likes of country stars like Faith Hill, Tim McGraw, Little Big Town and more has made her one of the industrys most in-demand songwriters. All have recorded her songs to great acclaim, but nobody sings Lori McKenna's songs better than Lori McKenna! Around here she is family and her sweet voice is like nothing else. It's always a treat to have her here!\n\nAugust 2, 2024 (Friday): Stone Mountain Annual Anniversary Show details\n\nFeaturing Carol Noonan and the Stone Mountain Boys\n\nwith special guests Irish Band Téada\n\nHey all wow this summer we will celebrate out 18th Anniversary.\n\nThis show helps us weather the unexpected. Cancels, snow storms, rising utility costs and more.We hope this year will be smooth sailing, but this show helps us prepare for the unexpected. If you love SMAC, buy a ticket!!! Please support us!\n\n*We ask that No Memberships are applicable for this SMAC fund raising effort.\n\nAugust 3, 2024 (Saturday): Keb' Mo' click for details\n\nWow we are so lucky we just love him!!! He was hailed by NPR as the modern ambassador for the blues. Since the release of his self-titled debut in 1994, blues guitarist Keb' Mo' (born Kevin Moore) has been one of the most successful musicians in the genre. Earning multiple Grammys and nominations, guitarist/vocalist Keb' Mo' draws heavily on the old-fashioned country blues style of Robert Johnson, while keeping his sound contemporary with touches of soul and folksy storytelling. A skilled frontman as well as an accomplished sideman, he writes much of his own material and has applied his acoustic, electric, and slide guitar skills to jazz- and rock-oriented bands. We have had him here a number of times now, and from where we stand every show is better than the last. Here with his killer band ... don't miss it.\n\nAugust 7, 2024 (Wednesday): Ladysmith Black Mambazo click for details\n\nWe are so excited to have this amazing group here and their message is more than welcome right now. South Africa's Ladysmith Black Mambazo carries a message of Peace, Love and Harmony as they travel the world year after year. They bring this message, in song and dance, to every theater they perform in. We hope you will join them as they sing their message. Watch this video and be reminded of how voices can move you.\n\nAugust 8, 2024 (Thursday): Comedian Bob Marley click for details\n\nI don't know any other person who worked harder to keep us entertained during 2020 and beyond than comedian Bob Marley. His daily videos were a comic relief from the world's challenges, and there have been many. Bob has a gift and a way of finding the hilarity in the obvious and the seemingly common occurrences in our sometimes mundane lives. In fact, he would make fun of me for saying all this!!. I can just hear him mocking me now!\n\nOn a personal note, Bob kept my staff from going crazy! We appreciate him for being one of the artists that was willing to do shows in whatever way he could to make venues and people laugh..whether it was a small capacity show or a drive in…he did it all. Nothing can stop the Bob Marley train and we love him for that. And yes, I said artist!!\n\nBob is not just our Maine comedian, he is one of the funniest people in the current world of comedy. His viral videos have thrust him into further popularity as one of the hottest and most sought after comedians in the country. But we are lucky he will still come to us! You know'em, you love'm...more than 15 years as a stand-up comic, Maine's own Bob Marley has been featured in his own special on Comedy Central, and is one of the few comics to do the complete late night TV circuit: The Late Show with David Letterman, The Tonight Show with Jay Leno, Late Night with Conan O'Brien and The Late Late Show with Craig Ferguson and Craig Kilborn. But all those accolades aside, he is just one of us, and we can't get enough of him. And geesh don't we all need to laugh right now. Always a quick sell out!\n\nAugust 9, 2024 (Friday): An Evening with Maine Authors click for details\n\nReadings presented by award winning authors Monica Wood and Lily King\n\nto Benefit Camp Susan Curtis\n\nJoin the 8th Annual Evening with Maine Authors to benefit Camp Susan Curtis, a non-profit organization that provides a free 10-day overnight summer camp experience to Maine children facing economic hardship. The evening will begin with a cocktail hour followed by a delicious buffet dinner in the Maine Concert Hall. After dinner, a current CSC Staff Member will share reflections about their camp experience followed by the evenings feature presentation of readings by award winning authors Monica Wood and Lily King.\n\nClick for more information and tickets .\n\nAugust 10, 2024 (Saturday): Ward Hayden and the Outliers click for details\n\nThis band has two sides to them... one is rockin' and one is just pure roots. If Chris Isaac, Buddy Holly and Buck Owens started a band, it might sound like these guys! The twangy country rock and roll sounds of this fun band, is fronted by SMAC favorite and crooner Ward Hayden (we love him!) A smooth, authentic honky tonk/early rock & roll vibe with some country-folk thrown in there too...it is hard to peg these guys....but that's a good thing! An eclectic blend of musical styles that's reminiscent of Johnny Cash one minute, CCR the next, the all-male quintet mixes catchy melodies with cowboy vocals and creative percussion, hurling grit (sometimes grits) and heart into every tune.\n\nAugust 14, 2024 (Wednesday): Brothers Comatose click for details\n\nWell these guys are described as high-energy,foot-stompin, folk-rock string band but i think what I like about them is they seem more like a rough around the edges seventies band with a side of bluegrass and country rock and roll. But what do i know!!? I know I likeem!\n\nSpeaking of seventies ... check out this video of them doing a little Bill Withers.\n\nThe five-piece West Coast string band is anything but a traditional acoustic outfit with their fierce musicianship and rowdy, rock concert-like shows. The Brothers Comatose is comprised of brothers Ben Morrison (guitar, vocals) and Alex Morrison (banjo, vocals), Steve Height (bass), Philip Brezina (violin), and Greg Fleischut (mandolin, vocals). When theyre not headlining The Fillmore for a sold-out show or appearing at Hardly Strictly Bluegrass Festival, the band is out on the road performing across America, Canada, Australia, and hosting their very own music festival, Comatopia, in the Sierra foothills. Its hard to find a video that they don't have a whos who of special guests .and that otta tell ya somethin! First time here don't missem.\n\nAugust 16, 2024 (Friday): Tom Rush click for details\n\nSince Tom Rush's 1962 debut as an unknown folk-blues musician on the Boston/Cambridge music scene, he has established himself as a consummate performer and singer-songwriter. A few years back, a sold out celebration of his five-decade career anniversary at Boston Symphony Hall proves his fan loyalty and endurance. When you think of the importance of the folk scene in the 60's you should think of Tom. These days he is just as vital and entertaining. We welcome him back with a big hug!\n\nAugust 22, 2024 (Thursday): Dave Alvin & Jimmie Dale Gilmore click for details\n\nwith the Guilty Ones\n\nOn Stage Together! Oh We couldn't be more excited!!!!!!!\n\nRoots music legends, Dave Alvin and Jimmie Dale Gilmore, have been friends for 30 years. When Grammy winner Dave Alvin and Grammy nominee Jimmie Dale Gilmore made the album Downey To Lubbock together in 2018, they wrote the title track as a sort of mission statement. I know someday this old highways gonna come to an end, Alvin sings near the songs conclusion. Gilmore answers: But I know when it does youre going to be my friend.\n\nSix years later, theyre serving notice that the old highway hasnt ended yet. Were still standing, no matter what you might hear, they sing on Were Still Here, the final track to their new album Texicali. Due out on Yep Roc Records, Texicali continues to bridge the distance between the two troubadours respective home bases of California (Alvin) and Texas (Gilmore).\n\nThe albums geographic theme reflects Alvins repeated journeys to record in Central Texas with Gilmore and the Austin-based backing band that has toured with the duo for the past few years. The 11 songs on Texicali also connect the duos shared fondness for a broad range of American music forms. On their own, both have been prominent artists for decades. A philosophical songwriter with a captivating, almost mystical voice, Gilmore co-founded influential Lubbock group the Flatlanders in the early 1970s. Alvin first drew attention as a firebrand guitarist and budding young songwriter with Los Angeles roots-rockers the Blasters in the early 1980s. Their journey continues!\n\nSo happy to have this show!\n\nAugust 23, 2024 (Friday): Enter the Haggis click for details\n\nFor over two decades, Torontos Enter The Haggis has combined bagpipes and fiddles with a rock rhythm section to create a distinctively eclectic sound, praised by The Boston Globe, The Washington Post, and Canadas Globe and Mail. Their songs offer singalong melodies and deep, meaningful lyrics which tell the stories of everyday hard working people, often faced with seemingly insurmountable challenges. Signature songs like One Last Drink, Gasoline, Down With The Ship and Lancaster Gate have been streamed millions of times, have appeared in Hollywood movies, and have been performed and recorded by artists around the world.\n\nEnter The Haggis' commitment to putting on a great show every single night has made them a favorite at festivals and performing arts centers across the US and Canada. As a result, ETH shows have become an annual tradition on some of the most prestigious stages on the continent. The band has also brought hundreds of fans on eight tours of Ireland and two of Scotland, forging deeper friendships with their supporters while exploring ancient landmarks and natural wonders across each country. Glad to have them back!\n\nAugust 24, 2024 (Saturday): Sam Bush click for details\n\nGrammy Award winning multi-instrumentalist Sam Bush doesn't seem old enough to be a musical legend, but that is just what he is. Considered the originator of the Newgrass style, he is \"the\" mandolin player of our generation. Bush has helped to expand the horizons of bluegrass music, fusing it with jazz, rock, blues, funk and other styles. He's the co-founder of the genre-bending New Grass Revival and an in-demand musician who has played with everyone from Emmylou Harris and Bela Fleck to Charlie Haden, Lyle Lovett and Garth Brooks. And though Bush is best known for jaw-dropping skills on the mandolin, he is also a three time national junior fiddle champion and Grammy award winning vocalist. We are honored to be a stop on Sams tour. As always with a killah band of A list of players. Dont missem!\n\nAugust 29, 2024 (Thursday): Comedian Bob Marley click for details\n\nI don't know any other person who worked harder to keep us entertained during 2020 and beyond than comedian Bob Marley. His daily videos were a comic relief from the world's challenges, and there have been many. Bob has a gift and a way of finding the hilarity in the obvious and the seemingly common occurrences in our sometimes mundane lives. In fact, he would make fun of me for saying all this!!.

We appreciate him for being one of the artists that was willing to do shows in whatever way he could to make venues and people laugh..whether it was a small capacity show or a drive in…he did it all. Nothing can stop the Bob Marley train and we love him for that. And yes, I said artist!!\n\nBob is not just our Maine comedian, he is one of the funniest people in the current world of comedy. His viral videos have thrust him into further popularity as one of the hottest and most sought after comedians in the country. But we are lucky he will still come to us! You know'em, you love'm...more than 15 years as a stand-up comic, Maine's own Bob Marley has been featured in his own special on Comedy Central, and is one of the few comics to do the complete late night TV circuit: The Late Show with David Letterman, The Tonight Show with Jay Leno, Late Night with Conan O'Brien and The Late Late Show with Craig Ferguson and Craig Kilborn. But all those accolades aside, he is just one of us, and we can't get enough of him. And geesh don't we all need to laugh right now. Always a quick sell out!\n\nAugust 30, 2024 (Friday): Brandy Clark click for details\n\nA Grammy and CMA Award-winner, Brandy Clark is one of her generation's most esteemed songwriters and musicians. In the midst of yet another landmark year, Clark won Best Americana Performance at this year's 66th Grammy Awards for her song \"Dear Insecurity,\" featuring 11x Grammy-winner Brandi Carlile  Clark's first Grammy win. The song is from Clark's self-titled album, which was produced by Carlile and features her most personal songwriting to date.

One of our fav sell out shows of last year.\n\nRight off the streets of New Orleans, Tuba Skinny is dedicated to bringing the best in traditional early jazz swing to audiences around the world. For over a decade Tuba Skinny has grown steadily in popularity, releasing twelve albums and touring all over the world. Theyve attracted a wide variety of fans- young and old, neophytes and niche-enthusiasts- with the strength of their musicianship and the scope of their jazz and American roots music catalog. While theyve become known as world-class interpreters of traditional jazz, over the years theyve branched out into jug band music, spirituals, country blues, string band music, ragtime, and New Orleans R&B. Their approach is a true reflection of Americana, encompassing the full genealogy of popular American music from an early 20th century perspective.\n\n\"Musically, Tuba Skinny mines a rich seam of traditional jazz and blues from the '20s and '30s. And, while it's evident the band treasures the sense of history evoked by these vintage tunes, the players' natural exuberance makes the music feel irresistibly alive. - Melbourne Music Festival\n\nIf jazz is the bread, then the blues is the butter for Tuba Skinny. - Offbeat Magazine\n\nSeptember 13, 2024 (Friday): Harry Manx with Kevin Breit click for details\n\nLike the song says.....\"Im just wild about Harry!!\"..and you will be too!\n\nIt takes begging and pleading to get Harry to come to the States these days. I did and he is!! What can I say about Harry....we have had him here many times....for a reason. Canadian artist (artist in every sense of the word) Harry Manx known as the \"Mysticssippi\" blues man has been called an \"essential link\" between the music of East and West, creating musical short stories that wed the tradition of the Blues with the depth of classical Indian ragas. I mean, who else would play a banjo, guitar and sitar, and keeps the beat with his feet. Oh, and great songs too. There is no one like him. He has created a unique sound that is hard to forget and deliciously addictive to listen to. We are obviously hooked on Harry too. As we said, his U.S. appearances can be a rare sighting, so we are so happy and lucky he is back!\n\nJoining Harry is award winning Canadian guitarist Kevin Breit with a genre-bending style that encompasses jazz, blues, country, and experimental rock.\n\nIt's gonna be a super show!!!\n\nSeptember 14, 2024 (Saturday): Darin & Brooke Aldridge click for details\n\nYa know when I say, you gotta see this act? Well ya gotta and bettah! I have wanted to get this husband and wife country bluegrass act for awhile. They are so pure. Watch this video of a song they wrote about the Ryman Grand Ole Circle where they of course have graced.\n\nDarin and Brooke continue to ascend to new heights in the industry while maintaining their easy-going, down-to-earth connection with audiences everywhere. Brooke is a four-time consecutive winner and reigning Female Vocalist of the Year for the International Bluegrass Music Association (IBMA). She was nominated for a fifth time in 2021 while Darin is a former IBMA Mentor of the Year and a truly gifted singer and multi-instrumentalist. Darin and Brooke have also been recognized with the IBMAs nomination for 2021 Vocal Group of the Year. They have had multiple nominations over the years from the IBMA, the Society for the Preservation of Bluegrass Music of America (SPBGMA), and the Inspirational Country Music Association. On April 18, 2023, they were named Bluegrass Artists of the Year at the Absolutely Gospel Music Awards. Well if thats not enough to get you here I don't know what is!!???\n\nCome join us in welcoming them to our stage for the first time. And they are so dang cute together!\n\nSeptember 20, 2024 (Friday): The BRIGIDEENS click for details\n\nFeaturing Eileen Ivers, a brand-new acoustic powerhouse, fiery female band came together as a group of talented musicians and singers from the Celtic and Americana traditions. Led by Grammy awarded, Emmy-nominated, 9-time All-Ireland Fiddle Champion, Eileen Ivers, Eileen formed the group to showcase the mighty dimension of talent in todays female artists. Native New Yorkers, Caitlin Maloney is on lead vocals and Hilary Hawke on 5-string banjo, upright bass, clarinet, spoons and background vocals. Anna Colliton, a Chicago native, is a master of the bodhran, the traditional Irish frame drum, and cajon/percussion.

Check them out.\n\nSeptember 27, 2024 (Friday): Heather Pierson click for details\n\nA Celebration of Heather's New Album, Back To The Light\n\nSMAC is honored to bring this special show to celebrate the release of Heather's forthcoming album, Back To The Light, her most vibrant release yet. The first single, 'Up Here In The Mountains', will be released June 21. Back To The Light was recorded at Acadia Recording Company in Portland, ME with her trio mates Shawn Nadeau on bass and drummer Craig Bryan. This new album of Heather's originals pulsates throughout with the grooves of New Orleans, the beauty of Appalachia, and Sunday-go-to-meeting celebration. 'Everybody's tryin' to be free of the ghosts that haunt them at night,' she sings in the title track, and what better way to nourish and embolden oneself in the darkness than with the medicine of song? We agree ..don't miss it!\n\nSeptember 28, 2024 (Saturday): Gibson Brothers click for details\n\nTheres a reason why Ricky Skaggs pulled Eric and Leigh Gibson off the stage at the Ryman two decades ago and offered to produce their debut record.The same thing that led David Ferguson and Grammy Award winning producer and Black Keys front man Dan Auerbach to co-write and produce their 14th album Mockingbird (2018) and release it on his own label Easy Eye Sound alongside cultural icons such as Hank Williams Jr. and Dr. John:the Gibson Brothers are the real deal.They can pick.They can sing.And they can write a damn good country song. Theyve won about every bluegrass award you can name and released albums on almost every premier Americana label you can think of including Sugar Hill and Rounder, and, if thats not enough, their songs have been recorded by bluegrass legends no less than Del McCoury. Its a resume almost anybody in country music would be proud to have. But despite all of this, the Gibson Brothers are not yet household names. Their latest album, Darkest Hour, produced by dobro master Jerry Douglas might just change that.\n\nI tell you what they are household names in our house!!\n\nOh, I love these these bluegrass greats!!! You name a bluegrass award and they have won it : Songwriter of the Year, Entertainer of the Year, Emerging Artist of the Year, Song of the Year, Vocal Group of the Year....and some of these multiple times! These brothers of bluegrass, write really amazing songs, have beautiful voices and are just the real deal. In a climate of new grass and a glut on new string bands, these brothers hold true to the old time bluegrass and country. They were featured on Prairie Home Companion last year and of course many of you have seen them here at Christmas....they always bring the house down. They have a sound that is so sincere. It's like they grew up in a country band decades ago, when the divisions of country music were not so defined. But they are every bit of here for today's' stages. They have a killer band, and are a personal favorite of mine....Come highly SMAC recommended.\n\nOctober 5, 2024 (Saturday): Darrell Scott click for details\n\nHey all you song writer lovers this guy in my opinion is 100% exactly what singer songwriter should be. Scott has collaborated with Steve Earle, Sam Bush, Emmylou Harris, John Cowan, Verlon Thompson, Guy Clark, Tim O'Brien, Kate Rusby, Jimmie Dale Gilmore, Mary Gauthier, Dan Tyminski, and Brad Paisely recorded his song \"You'll Never Leave Harlan Alive\" on the finale of Justified ( a favorte SMAC show by the way!) Here is his version of this great song with some talented friends.\n\nGaining new fame by touring with Robert Plant and the Zac Brown Band (2 years with each), and producing albums for Malcolm Holcomb and Guy Clark and being named \"songwriter of the year\" for both ASCAP and NSAI, Darrel Scott has been one buys song writer. A multi-instrumentalist and singer-songwriter who mines and cultivates the everyday moment, taking the rote, menial, mundane, and allowing it to be surreal, ever poignant, and candidly honest, lilting, blooming, and resonating. The words he fosters allow us to make sense of the world, what is at stake here, and our place in it. And ultimately, Darrell knows the sole truth of life is that love is all that matters, that we don't always get it right, but that's the instinctive and requisite circuitous allure of things, why we forever chase it, and why it is held sacred.\n\nThese days find him roaming his Tennessee wilderness acreage hiking along the small river, creating delicious meals with food raised on his property and playing music. He often leads songwriting workshops to help people tell their own truths with their stories, and is as busy as always writing, producing, performing, and just plain fully immersing himself in life. For this night he will immerse himself up a country road. Happy to have him back.\n\nOctober 11, 2024 (Friday): Maia Sharp & Willy Porter click for details\n\nWhat a GREAT DOUBLE BILL ... TWO GREAT SONGWRITERS\n\nMaia Sharp\n\nMaia has had her songs recorded by Bonnie Raitt, The Chicks, Trisha Yearwood, Keb Mo, Cher, Edwin McCain, David Wilcox, Art Garfunkel, Lizz Wright, Paul Carrack, Lisa Loeb, Terri Clark, and many more. And through it all, Maia has continued to record her own albums including: nine solo releases, one collaborative project with Art Garfunkel and Buddy Mondlock, and her duo project- Roscoe & Etta (with writing/production partner Anna Schulze). Each release has been embraced by press and radio and has led to extensive touring and appearances on Mountain Stage, Acoustic Cafe, World Cafe, NPRs All Things Considered, CBS Early Morning, and the Today Show to name a few.\n\nBonnie Raitt says, \"Maia is making some of the most innovative and soulful music around with songs that are head and shoulders above the rest. She has become one of my favorite artists .a brilliant album, start to finish.\n\nWilly Porter\n\nSome folks are lucky to find what they love to do at an early age and quietly settle in for the long haul expanding and developing their work over the arc of a lifetime. Willy Porter is one of those artists. He has followed his own path to explore the sacred language that music truly is. 30 years after his solo recording debut, he continues to reach further into his guitar & pen while stretching the form of what his own music can be. His thrust to critical acclaim began in 1994 with Dog Eared Dream and continues with his latest The Ravine. Dont miss this night of great songwriting\n\nOctober 17, 2024 (Thursday): Comedian Bob Marley click for details\n\nI don't know any other person who worked harder to keep us entertained during 2020 and beyond than comedian Bob Marley. His daily videos were a comic relief from the world's challenges, and there have been many. Bob has a gift and a way of finding the hilarity in the obvious and the seemingly common occurrences in our sometimes mundane lives. In fact, he would make fun of me for saying all this!!. I can just hear him mocking me now!\n\nOn a personal note, Bob kept my staff from going crazy! We appreciate him for being one of the artists that was willing to do shows in whatever way he could to make venues and people laugh..whether it was a small capacity show or a drive in…he did it all. Nothing can stop the Bob Marley train and we love him for that. And yes, I said artist!!\n\nBob is not just our Maine comedian, he is one of the funniest people in the current world of comedy. His viral videos have thrust him into further popularity as one of the hottest and most sought after comedians in the country. But we are lucky he will still come to us! You know'em, you love'm...more than 15 years as a stand-up comic, Maine's own Bob Marley has been featured in his own special on Comedy Central, and is one of the few comics to do the complete late night TV circuit: The Late Show with David Letterman, The Tonight Show with Jay Leno, Late Night with Conan O'Brien and The Late Late Show with Craig Ferguson and Craig Kilborn.

Always a quick sell out!\n\nOctober 18, 2024 (Friday): Rickie Lee Jones click for details\n\nRickie Lee Jones is an American musician, storyteller and two-time Grammy winner who has been inspiring pop culture for decades, beginning with her star-making self-titled debut, followed by the seminal Pirates.

Jones celebrated memoir Last Chance Texaco was named Book of the Year by MOJO and a Best Book of the Year at Pitchfork and NPR. The Independent writes, There has always been something defiant about Rickie Lee Jones . . . a voice from a dream, elusive yet familiar, transcendent, a messenger from another place.\n\nOctober 19, 2024 (Saturday): The Lone Bellow click for details\n\nZach Williams, The Lone Bellows lead singer and principal songwriter, can pinpoint just about exactly when the Brooklyn-based group serendipitously willed itself into being. It was around 9 a.m. one morning in 2010, at Dizzys Diner in Park Slope, Brooklyn, where The Lone Bellows guitarist and Williams old friend Brian Elmquist was working a shift. Williams, up to then performing as a solo artist, needed a place to try out some new songs; for a scuffling artist, the diner was as good as any rehearsal space. He asked fellow singer Kanene Pipkin, just returned to New York City from living in Beijing, to meet them at the diner and the trio did more than merely jam. With the beginnings of a repertoire and an already strong communal spirit, that fateful morning they became The Lone Bellow. As Williams recalls, Three songs in I realized I should quit what Im doing and just make music with these people.\n\nNovember 1, 2024 (Friday): Bruce Cockburn click for details\n\nDubbed \"The Canadian Bob Dylan,\" Bruce Cockburn has 40 albums and nearly 400 songs to his name in over 50 years of music-making. He embraces folk, jazz, rock, and world as he sings heartfelt stories of personal exploration, politics, and spirituality. A twelve-time Juno Award winner, Bruce is one of Canadas most revered, treasured, and innovative artists. Its been too long since we have had him back. So happy he will grace our stage.\n\nNovember 2, 2024 (Saturday): Erica Brown and the Bluegrass Connection details\n\nWe love this band the pride of Maine...they have been through thick an thin with us these last few years and we are so happy to have them back on our stage!!!\n\nTheir latest album, Blue Pine Moon, and Erica and her five piece band feature some of the finest musicians in New England. The band features award winning fiddler and singer Erica Brown, Matt Shipman on mandolin, Lincoln Meyers on guitar, Eli Gilbert on banjo and Kris Day on bass. They are energetic, fun and diverse as they incorporate music from the traditional Bluegrass, Folk and Country repertoire as well as French Canadian fiddle music and original songs. It will be a super night of music as always from these special SMAC friends.\n\nNovember 9, 2024 (Saturday): Ellis Paul click for details\n\nEllis is a true Renaissance man. An astute storyteller, poetic and literate, with a stellar stage presence Ellis Paul is one of those gifted singer/songwriters. Though some may refer to him as a folk singer, he is more, for lack of a better word, a singular storyteller, a musician whose words reach out from inside and yet also express the feelings, thoughts and sensibilities that most people can relate to in one way or another, regardless of age or upbringing. Besides being a fierce troubadour, he can add movie soundtracks, childrens books, artwork and more to his resume. Dont missem :>)\n\nNovember 15, 2024 (Friday): Susan Werner click for details\n\nWhat can we say about Susan, but when I think of her I think of thoroughly talented, smart and entertaining. She would hate me for saying this, but I think she is the Mary Poppins of us singer songwriters. Her songwriting is poignant and her message is heartfelt but always getting her point across with a little sugar on top. Couldn't we all have a little of that lately.\n\nBut back to her impressive career... Over the course of her twenty-five year touring career, Susan Werner has built a reputation as one of the countrys most compelling live performers. With formidable chops on guitar (she began playing at age 5) and piano (she was a guest on Marian McPartlands Piano Jazz) along with a graduate degree in voice performance, her shows are a one-woman master class in musicianship. Her songs are noted for their poetry and sharp wit, and also for their astonishing stylistic range. Shes written songs in the style of Gershwin and Cole Porter (I Cant Be New, 2004), gospel music (The Gospel Truth, 2007), traditional Cuban son (An American In Havana, 2016), and New Orleans junk piano (NOLA, 2019). In 2014 she composed the music and lyrics to the musical theater score Bull Durham, The Musical (MGM) and her latest recording of original songs, The Birds of Florida, took flight.\n\nNovember 16, 2024 (Saturday): Tricky Britches click for details\n\nThe RETURN of one of our favorite bands. It’s been too long. Some bluegrass , some country, some folk…some all of that! Tricky Britches formed in 2009, when four friends in Portland, Maine, took their fiddle tunes and country songs on the road across the US. Since then they have released three albums of original material: Comin’ in Hot (2016), Good Company (2013), and Hard Fought Day(2011). They have played on stages big and small across the US, Hawaii, and Europe. But Tricky on our stage is just the most special.\n\nNovember 23, 2024 (Saturday): Amy Helm click for details\n\nWhen creating her fourth album, the soulful and reflective Silver City, Amy Helm was guided by her North Star: womens voices. Women whispering, singing, shouting their stories - speaking the truth. I wanted to dig into that inherited narrative and reach for what I could. The epistolary anthology is a collection of conversations that travel through time, exploring and celebrating womanhood in all its complexities. Silver City blends the folk twang of Helms childhood with gospel and soul, drawing inspiration from varied stories: the life of Helms great-grandmother, the story of a young fan struggling with substance abuse, Helms own life as a single mother and hard-touring singer. Recorded at Levon Helm Studios in Woodstock, New York, and produced by Josh Kaufman, the album finds Helm exploring themes of womanhood, single motherhood, and personal struggles, offering songs that are deeply personal and narrative-driven. With Silver City, Helm embraces the beauty of age, survival, and transformation through her powerful, story-rooted performances. Here with a great band.\n\nDecember 7, 2024 (Saturday): Dana Cunningham and Carol Noonan details\n\nONE SHOW ONLY ...\n\nAnnual Christmas Concert at The Little White Church in Eaton, NH\n\nDana the composer and pianist, and Carol the singer songwriter together form a really beautiful and fun Christmas show that they play annually at this special place on Crystal Lake in the quaint village of Eaton NH.\n\nDoors open at 7:00 pm - Show begins at 7:30pm\n\nAgain, this concert is held at the Little White Church in Eaton NH\n\nTickets may only be purchased through the Stone Mountain Arts Center Box Office\n\nJoin Dana and Carol for a very special holiday memory at the Little White Church.\n\nPlease Note:\n\n* This is not a SMAC produced show, so SMAC memberships or credits do not apply.\n\nDecember 11, 2024 (Wednesday): Comedian Bob Marley click for details\n\nI don't know any other person who worked harder to keep us entertained during 2020 and beyond than comedian Bob Marley.

Theyve established a connection with their fans unlike any other, and are suddenly selling out theaters throughout the Northeast. This folk musician, activist began playing shows over 20 years ago. When music venues wouldnt hire him, he played bars, bookstores, fields, and parking lots, often raising money for causes he cared about; a practice that grew into his nonprofit organization Rally Sound, empowering communities through music. These winners of the 2023 New England Music Awards Americana Act of the Year, inspired John Oates to invite Adam to begin a songwriting friendship that would lead to John co-writing and producing their upcoming release Hold Each Other Now. How did this happen? Adam will tell you: \"One person at a time, over many years and thousands of shows, decided to turn their heads to listen.\"\n\nThese days youll find Adam and his bandmates, Corinna Smith (Fiddle), Poche Ponce (Bass), and Alex Martin (Percussion), constantly out on the road. If you look at their tour schedule now, you can buy tickets to see them at festivals, rock venues, and theaters around the country, but you will also see their tour continuously peppered with activism and grassroots events; a testament to an artist who will never forget where he came from, and whose mission is about much more than music.\n\nDecember 31, 2024 (Tuesday): Soggy Po' Boys click for details\n\nwith Celia Woodsmith of Della Mae\n\nThe New Orleans styled Soggy Po Boys, native to New England, are spreading the good news of New Orleans music across the northeast and beyond.
