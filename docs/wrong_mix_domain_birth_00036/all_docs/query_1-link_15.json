        "text": "Tony Starlight's 25th Anniversary: Coffeeshop Coversation #160 / How a star was born\n\nComing up next month is the twenty-fifth anniversary of the birth of Tony Starlight. He was already alive and grown at that time, but his career as Tony the crooner, entertainer, nostalgia boy, club owner and one funny guy began in 1993…and I will let him tell you how because he’s sitting next to me. And he just took off his Portland Mavericks hat. Not dressed to perform at the moment but we’ll get into how he chooses his outfits later.\n\nHis anniversary show will be Saturday, September 22 at the Alberta Rose Theater and it will be something special…and he’s going to tell you all about it and a lot of other things about himself that you might have never known.\n\nTOM D'ANTONI, Oregon Music News — Aug 16, 2018\n\nOn the Go with Joe at the Tony Starlight Christmas show\n\nThe holiday season is in full swing at one swinging spot in Portland where a show is bringing back musical memories of years gone by. The Tony Starlight Christmas show recreates the magic of old holiday TV specials from the 1960s and 1970s that would feature performers like Bing Crosby and Dean Martin. Created by Starlight and Bo Ayars, the Vegas-style show combines standards, comedy routines, impressions and more. There are also duets with guest vocalist Barbara Ayars on songs from classic holiday shows like “How the Grinch Stole Christmas!” and “Rudolph the Red Nosed Reindeer.” Joe V. stopped by to catch up with Tony and get a preview of the Christmas crooning.\n\nWatch the video\n\nMusic on the Street talks with Tony Starlight: His new Showroom opens this weekend\n\nMusic and comedy. Music and comedy before Letterman and Leno. There are some things that just have to be seen. Tony Starlight and his old time renditions are some of those things. These special shows not only lovingly recall days gone by but the meticulous detail, the glitzy atmosphere, the memorable melodies work together to give you an uncommon treat. Tony Starlight has just created a new supperclub where everything will be amped up a notch but he made time to talk with Music on the Street about comedy, music, and putting it all together with his special spin.\n\nOregon Music News\n\nTony Starlight Showroom to open off Hawthorne\n\nThe emerging lower Hawthorne Entertainment District is about to get quite a bit more entertaining. In August, the Tony Starlight Showroom opens at 1125 SE Madison beside the newish Mad Sons Restaurant, for weekend theme shows that have been so successful on Sandy Blvd. for the last seven years.\n\nThe grand opening will be Friday August 22 with a Variety Show and a Rat pack vibe, comedy and more. Tony Starlight includes impressions and parody songs (“My Hair Keeps a-Fallin’ from My Head”) in his act along with “original music with lyrics about your awful children, traffic gridlock, and our ever changing relationship with our pants.”\n\nJ. Michael Kearsey, The Southeast Examiner — Aug 1, 2014\n\nA Diamond sparkling in the Starlight: Tony Starlight does Neil Diamond\n\nWearing a shaggy black wig, sporting a sparkly shirt, tight pants and a bejeweled belt buckle reading “SEXY,” Tony Starlight saunters onstage, into the spotlight, while the band plays.\n\n“Hello, Portland!” he hollers. The crowd of about 90 people applauds, and Starlight pauses as he looks around dubiously. “Are you sure this is the Rose Garden?”\n\nIt’s the first of many jokes about appearance versus reality coming up this evening. Starlight is at his Northeast Portland home base, Tony Starlight’s Supper Club & Lounge, where he typically does songs and patter inspired by stars of earlier eras, notably Frank Sinatra and other Rat Pack-vintage icons.\n\nBut tonight, Starlight is taking on another identity, that of Neil Diamond — specifically, 1970s Diamond, with his fluffy hair, unbuttoned shirts and arena-filling showmanship. While Starlight and the band sell Diamond’s songs with sincere, professional flair, there’s humor layered into the concept. The narrow club may be crowded and cozy, but it’s hardly an arena. And obviously, Starlight isn’t Diamond. For that matter, he’s not even Starlight. The 42-year-old entertainer’s real name is Brett Kucera, and Starlight is his wisecracking, showbizzy alter ego.\n\nKristi Turnquist, The Oregonian – October 27, 2012\n\nTony Starlight’s offers a glimpse back at a ’40s-style nightclub\n\nWhen Tony Starlight hits the bandstand he comes in a blue tuxedo, with a glimmering blue cummerbund and a shirt ruffled to just this side of outlandish. He’s got a drink in one hand, a tight jazz trio behind him and a smooth croon that’s part Frank, part Dean and every bit as old school as the chrome broadcast microphone standing in front of him.\n\nAs long as I’m singin’, then the world’s all right, and everybody’s swingin’. …\n\nHe’s snapping and grooving, and the whole club is right there with him: the young woman in sea foam green taffeta, her companion in the black Kangol cap, the older couples in their cocktail gowns and blazers. Cufflinks are not unheard of. You could show up in spats.\n\nTony Starlight, who also owns and manages the club, would love it if you did. It’s all his vision, this luxurious remove from the bonds of time and place, so when he gazes down at the shimmering faces and glittering gowns, he’s seeing a dream come to life.\n\ndennis peck, The Oregonian – Thursday August 27, 2009\n\nPhoto: Leah Nash/Special to The Oregonian\n\nPDXposed’s final episode at Tony Starlight’s: Next Stop… the world\n\nWhat an evening! PDXposed has reached a new summit. By tooth and claw, they’ve earned every single gouged crevice. If not entirely seamless, they certainly accomplished it with great attitude and style. “Always fun, always positive”, this evening was no exception. I am so glad to have attended this exclusive engagement, chock full of great entertainment and comradeship far and beyond measure.\n\nTypod – September 21st, 2010.\n\nPortland Jazz Festival and Tony Starlight’s Supper Club get new series off to supreme start\n\n“It’s nice to have both jazz and customers,” Tony Starlight said late Saturday night in his Northeast Portland nightclub. He was talking to Bill Royston and Jenn Lawson of PDX Jazz during a sold-out show by Devin Phillips, and Royston, a veteran of jazz booking, had a ready reply: “I’ve always said there’s at least three or four dollars in this business.”\n\nMoney aside, Saturday’s show appeared to mark the start of a fruitful relationship between PDX Jazz, which produces the Portland Jazz Festival each February, and Tony Starlight’s Supper Club – Lounge. It was the first in a monthly series of shows intended to give PDX Jazz a year-round presence in the music scene.\n\nAs Starlight’s quip suggests, serious straight-ahead jazz hasn’t been the club’s bread and butter. But the strong reception for the saxophonist Phillips — who led a quartet with drummer Alan Jones, pianist Ramsey Embick and bassist Eric Gruber in a firebreathing tribute to the classic John Coltrane album “A Love Supreme” — proved the match can work.\n\nThe series continues with something closer to the swanky, retro aesthetic that defines Starlight’s place — an Oct. 16 show by the redoubtable duo of singer Rebecca Kilgore and pianist Dave Frishberg. The pop-savvy jazz singer Jenna Mammina, a favorite in these parts since Royston brought her to the Mt. Hood Jazz Festival a decade or so ago, performs on Nov. 20.\n\nMarty Hughley, The Oregonian – September 20, 2010\n\nA Day In the Nightlife: Tony Starlight’s Supper Club\n\nTony Starlight opened his namesake place in January 2007, determined to bring Portland a nostalgic entertainment venue it didn’t have. Not a jazz club, a New York City-style piano bar, high-end resto, nor a concert hall, his room would be a supper club with a variety show, starring himself as Dino, Tom Jones, Frankie, Neil Diamond and made-up characters. He’d make people laugh, connect with the audience, get to know the community — at least the ones who showed up at his nightclub.\n\nWhat’s odd is that by now the club has become all of those things.\n\nAngela Allen, oregonmusicnews.com – August 10, 2010\n\nStar Power – Can Tony Starlight shine up Sandy Boulevard’s darkest corner?\n\nMichael Byrne, Willamette Week – March 7th 2007\n\nAsk anyone in Portland– even a Hollywood-neighborhood native– to list all the businesses that have called the odd, triangular building at Northeast 37th Avenue and Sandy Boulevard home, and probably the only people able to do so would be the Realtors who have guided the property through its many, many tenants. Just since 2000 it’s played home to indie venue the Blackbird, Rafael’s Comida Mexicana, Uncle Butchy’s Low Carb Creations and Brandy’s strip club…even the Yellow Pages can’t keep up. But Brett Kucera doesn’t believe the building’s cursed. In January, he reopened the joint’s doors, fashioning it as a home base for his longtime lounge-crooner alter ego, Tony Starlight.\n\nHollywood gets a new star (light)\n\nLounge-king Tony Starlight once ruled the Portland nightscape. But after wowing fans at spots like the Gypsy in Northwest Portland, Tony left for Los Angeles in 1999 to try his hand at acting and improv. The performer moved back to the Rose City late last year, and for the past three months has been quietly transforming the space at the late, lamented rock club The Blackbird on Northeast Sandy Boulevard into Tony Starlight’s Supperclub and Lounge…\n\nThe Oregonian — January 19, 2007"
