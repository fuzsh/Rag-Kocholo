I was taught at a young age to keep a happy face on but having nothing but time makes a person reflect and see what can truly be changed if one wants to. Once I did that I realized that doors could be open and my dreams could be obtained. I’m now finally getting to live out the dreams 10 year old Patrick wanted for himself. I wanted to be a teacher, a chef, and an actor. I get to teach high school age kids about culinary and am a drag Queen under the name Ophelia Johnson. I have a loving husband and tons of cats, and with all these joys self doubt can still sneak in. It’s an everyday battle but I’m here for the fight.”\n\n“Letta Dicken is a plus size, up and coming Drag Queen entertainer in the Portland Area, representing all of the plus size beauties and showing that big is beautiful.

So I took a wicked long time to think of something to write about myself….self. self. Self! That's it! Talk about the self! Specifically, the journey to self love. To anyone reading this, I understand how absolutely downright challenging it is to deeply love yourself. You are not alone! And to those who have reached that steady and long-term point where you have loved yourself, I super admire you. Kudos to you! That mental and emotional work must have been chock full of so very many ups and downs and intense internal battles. And so, no matter where you are in your personal self-love journey, I hope you not only get there as painlessly as possible and live as authentically as possible, but also more importantly, I hope you enjoy that adventure that is your own beautiful life. Good luck in your journey to love yourself!\"\n\n“Literally a week before the world shut down I signed a job contract that said I would move here in 3 months for at least 5 years. Moving to a new place where you don't know anyone (in the middle of a pandemic nonetheless) has been a trying experience - especially since I am very much an extrovert! In the last year and a half I've fallen in love with Maine - the woods, the water, the nature in any season, really. And knowing that's how I feel being here before even truly discovering a queer community only makes me that much more excited for the future.”\n\n“For me exploring my sexuality meant finding my passion. Whether it was long nights, in ballet tights, in the studios growing up, or seeing a little bit of me inside of the queers in my community. Each time I took a leap of faith outside of my comfort zone I discovered another facet of me. Growing up Black and Queer in Sweet Home Alabama was a recipe for a trauma flavored funnel cake lightly powdered with social injustices and fried in micro aggressions, but it molded me into the unapologetic artist you’ve all come to know today.\n\nWhen I moved to Maine, it took me a while to find my community. Often, I’d stop myself from opportunities, due to fears of inadequacy and imposter syndrome, until I was lucky enough to meet a group of like-minded individuals with THEM Burlesque, a queer burlesque troupe that I’ve been with for over a year at this point. It started off with THEM, but quickly expanded into the rich, vibrant, and welcoming queer artist community of Portland.\n\nIn the end, I just want to be living proof that you can overcome the struggles of your environment, find and thrive in your niche, and you can shine through the darkness the world puts on all of us with the strength and love of our fellow LGBTQIA+ community.”\n\n\"Dreams don’t die, so keep an eye on your dream’...ok, so I couldn’t have picked a cheesier Sondheim lyric to quote. But hear me out - a lot of today leaves much to be desired. I’ve tried to have a positive outlook through all of this, and passing that on to my private students and music performing colleagues. Recently, this has proved to be difficult with a job in the performing arts industry. However, I keep reminding myself of these words, and remember that even though the music has died for a bit, it will bounce back twice as strong. Looking forward to opportunity in 2021!\"\n\n\"I’m a social worker, I’m in recovery, I’m biracial, I’m gay, I make techno music, I’m a Pisces and my saving grace is Leo moon. I moved to Portland from boston about five years ago, to start over. My life was out of control, and I was finally ready to try something new. I’m very grateful for all of the wonderful people I’ve met here who’ve helped me along my way. Cancel culture is something that I have come to understand as poisonous. Having difficult, awkward, messy, in other words “honest” conversations is the only way out. When we can sit with one another and not leave till the conclusion. If love is not the conclusion, the work is not done.”\n\n\"When I moved back to Maine about ten years ago there weren’t many queer spaces so some friends and I started a party called sub/merge. We wanted to make a politicized queer dance party that raised money for rad organizing. I basically started DJing in order to thrown that party, but in the process I fell in love with dance music, particularly club sounds from micro pockets of cultural resistance & resilience all over the world. I love playing unknown and unexpected sounds & pop favorites to singing along too. There are more queer spaces now than there used to be, which is a welcome way Portland is evolving. I’m still contributing in my small way by throwing & DJing parties. I have some events I’m really excited about coming up: Each first Friday between May & July @discodungeon and I will be bringing you JUICED: a queer party at @citrusportland. For Pride on June 17 I’ll be throwing my semi regular QUEER AS IN… at @flasklounge. I’ve got a few more things in the works this summer, so follow me at @redtide207.”\n\n\"I’m a queer and trans non-binary multi-hyphenate creator who mostly makes queer and trans media for kids and families. I write books and tv, I perform and act, and I run my own small online business. I grew up in New York but for some reason always dreamed of living in Maine. That was just a pipe dream for a long time, something I didn’t think would happen until retirement (what does that mean anyways?). My wife got an opportunity to move here summer of 2019 and after some initial hesitation we drove everything we had up north. We fell in love with life here. My work can be really hard, especially considering the current political climate where trans kids and queer education are under attack. But my mental health has improved so much because I’m able to shut off the hustle and bustle of my busy and sometimes fraught work days by driving my dog ten minutes to the beach for a picture perfect walk along the water complete with majestic light houses.”\n\n\"I've been a full-time Mainer now for 3.5 years, after vacationing here for almost 10 years prior, and I haven't missed my past city life that much. Maine is an inspiring state with so much to see, and New England helps my creative juices flow. I've worked in entertainment my whole life, so I luckily have been around queer people for years, but I didn't become fully settled with my sexuality until my mid 20s, once I was in a committed, loving, supportive relationship that led to marriage, and now I can't imagine not being part of the queer club. I'm an indie filmmaker and casting director based in Kittery, and I like to include queer characters in my short films and often push for queer actors to audition for roles I'm casting. My latest short film Your Last Summer is very queer, coastal, and creepy, and I have ideas for more queer-centric horror films to make in the area. I'm also a podcaster and host a show called Release Date Rewind that you can find on your favorite podcast app, on YouTube, and on Portland Media Center's Channel 5. I'm happy to add my trivia-loving gay perspective to the film podcast community as friends and I discuss favorite movies and TV series of any genre from the past that are celebrating milestone anniversaries. My years in casting led me to also become an acting coach, so I teach classes and workshops all over southern Maine and online. Some of my acting students have not only secured an agent or manager after working with me, but went on to book roles in films and TV series throughout the east coast, from Apple TV+ to Nickelodeon, from Saturday Night Live to Sesame Street, which makes me even more proud. You can support my work at linktr.ee/mjp_pov. @mjp_pov @releasedaterewind\n\n“It took me a long time to understand and feel confident expressing my queer identify. As a cis man who presents fairly masc, I often felt uncomfortable with what being a man was supposed to look like a according to society. Eventually I realized I could express my feminine side and could wear clothing that reflected that, and that wouldn't make me less of a man. I feel very grateful for the community around me that's supported me throughout my life. I still have a long way to go but getting better every day.\"\n\n“I’d like to talk a little bit about the dissonance in the Trans community right now. I see a lot of people saying, ‘You have to have dysphoria to be Trans. You have to have gone through suffering to be apart of this community,’ and I entirely disagree. Why are we gate keeping within our own group? Don’t we get enough of that from cis people? I’d like to invite everyone to think more about euphoria, and how their gender is aligning in a positive light. Let’s stop tearing each other down and instead lift each other up. I don’t know who needs to hear this, but you’re enough just the way you are. Happy Pride month everyone.”\n\n“I spent a lot of my 20s being an overachiever, trying to make a difference, being the first in my family to graduate college and go to law school and grad school, running for office, writing a book. Now that I’ve turned 30, I’m realizing that I can take a moment, pause, and breathe. I feel now that I know I can do it and I’ve got what it takes to succeed in my professional life, I’ve realized I put a lot of my personal life on hold. Time with family, going on dates, time to deepen friendships. Of course COVID had taught me that as well. So I’m entering a whole new decade of my life with personal goals.”\n\nMy writing often explores identity, isolation, queerness, and is always inspired and informed by living in Maine. Right now I am working on revising a work of fiction that delves into queer inheritance and what we pass on to the next generation of our community. I think for many LGBTQ folks, one’s family tree isn’t necessarily a linear concept. We cultivate our own circles of support and the heirs to what we leave behind could be anyone we share an identity with — and I think that’s pretty magical. Part of what I love about my job at The Telling Room in Portland is that I have the opportunity to support and celebrate queer youth who are writing in our state. I’m inspired by their work every day, and I hope that by amplifying and lifting up their voices we can create a richer literary landscape that’s inclusive of LGBTQ experiences in every genre. It’s never too early to take someone’s writing seriously and to support them as they grow as an author.”\n\nCamille, They/Them\n\n“I'm lucky to have amazing friends in Portland who love me for exactly who I am. For the first year or so after coming out, I really struggled with isolation and had to work through a lot of growing pains. It's been really incredible to see that as I've learned more about myself, and leaned more into my authenticity, my life has become so full of friendship, connection, and love. The energy from my queer community has helped me achieve some goals that have felt incredible, like making zines and learning how to play guitar! I feel really lucky that I get to be myself and I wish that for everybody, especially my trans and gender nonconforming homies (trans flag trans flag). And yeah, if there are any queers in Portland who watch One Piece hit me up!”\n\n“To be a queer Black woman & alive is an act of resistance. I have just swallowed the sun. I have just put the words Black and queer in my mouth at the same time. One of those words has been lodged in my throat for half a decade— they taste good together. They surprise me, by sharing the space in my smile.” Lauren is an engineer + poet living in Portland, ME. She loves her cats (Bean & Boone), her Subaru, and golfing. Lauren’s work is featured in Barrelhouse, Empty Mirror, Across the Margin, Homology Lit, and more. Her debut chapbook “You’re My Favorite” won the 2023 Maine Literary Award for Book of Poetry, and is out now with Thirty West Publishing.”\n\n“Liam, you can put on literally any outfit and be confident. you're a queer icon.\" --recent five-star yelp review. \"Liam (he/they) is a 35-year-old poet, musician, and visual artist. he is queer, trans/genderqueer, and demisexual. he is polyamorous and has two lovely longterm partners. he will always be one of the best listeners you know. liam's art, and his gentle boldness, challenges the status quo. liam's work explores gender and queerness, classism, mental health, the sacred and the profane, the painful sweetness of love, the dimensions of desire, and the tempting shadow sides of religion and human nature. liam has a tendency to be mischievous; his loved ones have a term, \"Liam'ing,\" for when he is trying to convince them that there are 15 types of metal that legally must be used in building treeforts. liam's debut poetry chapbook, EVERY DAY A DIFFERENT DAREDEVIL, is available through @LUPERCALIApress (2021).”\n\n““I think identity can be a curse and a blessing. As humans we yearn to find ways to explain and define our individuality. In the US it seems to be heavily pushed in society to define ourselves based on what we do for work and our overall productivity. For the last 6 months I’ve been dealing with post concussion syndrome. Concussions are no joke, and can be categorized as mild to moderate traumatic brain injuries (TBIs). Dealing with a TBI has changed my life in so many ways, but identity is the biggest one. I have started to redefine who I am. I am more than the identity of a Special Education Teacher that I’ve held onto for the last 6 years. My work and my productivity do not define me. I am a Jewish Queer Poet with a passion for disability advocacy, now more than ever before. I am a friend, sister, and daughter. I am a human who cries at the ocean and sunsets, who feels deeply and fully without shame. I am learning to love this new version of myself through bittersweet duality- holding the pain and the beauty of this life within the same breath. If you’d like to read my poetry, you can find me at @shoshannahvioletpoetry.”\n\n“I am a collage artist, poet, singer, nature lover and teacher. Being an educator sits at the very core of my being. I work in Early Childhood and I have always believed that nature is the greatest educator of all. Children can experience awe and wonder from looking up a tree that seems to touch the clouds. They can face challenges, fears and build resilience. They can learn empathy and strength from watching the smallest insect. Nature teaches children how to connect to our world in the most empowering and meaningful ways. ‘As we begin to feel our common bond of life with living things around us, our actions become more harmonious in an unforced, natural way, and we become concerned for the needs and well-being of all creatures.’ - Joseph Cornell ‘Sharing the Joy of Nature’\n\nIn the classroom or in nature, I want each child in my care to feel safe, seen, heard and understood. That is our job as educators. We have a responsibility to meet children where they are at. We are there to gently guide and fiercely stand by and support these tiny humans along their journey to being their most true and authentic selves.”"
