        "text": "ATLANTA, Ga. (Atlanta News First) - Famed singer-songwriter Usher Raymond received two illustrious Atlanta-based honors on Wednesday.\n\nAtlanta’s Black Music & Entertainment Walk of Fame revealed his emblem, and Atlanta Mayor Andre Dickens presented him with the city’s highest honor, the Phoenix Award.\n\nRaymond celebrated the honors and the release of his new album “Coming Home.”\n\nDuring the press conference Raymond declared: “We are major, baby. This is officially the United States of Atlanta!”\n\n>> RE-WATCH THE EVENT:\n\nThe recognitions came after Usher performed a 13-minute show at the Super Bowl in Las Vegas on Sunday.\n\nUsher’s Super Bowl performance broke the record for the most watched halftime show in Super Bowl history.\n\nAtlanta News First reporter Brittany Ford spoke with Usher one on one.\n\n“I’m just really happy. I’m really excited to be able to be here to celebrate in Atlanta,” said Raymond.\n\nRaymond says he’s riding an amazing wave of his career.\n\n“As I look out here and celebrate this one moment on the Black Music & Entertainment Walk of Fame, I’m celebrating an entire 30 years of a moment that crescendoed somewhat at the Super Bowl, but was really just the beginning of a new story,” he said.\n\nClark Atlanta University and lawmakers honored Usher with several awards Wednesday during a homecoming pep rally celebration, and even designated a day in his honor! As of February 14th, 2024, it’s officially Usher Raymond Appreciation Day.\n\nRELATED: Usher takes the stage at Super Bowl halftime show\n\nIn a career spanning 30 years, Usher has sold more than 243 million albums and 38 million digital songs in the United States. He’s also won eight Grammys and hundreds of other awards.\n\nUsher was born in Dallas, Texas, and spent most of his early years in Tennessee, but moved to Atlanta when he was 12. His 2024 North American tour, “Past, Present, Future,” kicks off Aug. 17 at the State Farm Arena.\n\nRELATED: Usher adds 2 more Atlanta concerts after epic Super Bowl show\n\nA homecoming rally was also held at Clark Atlanta Wednesday.\n\nUsher was awarded a $25,000 donation from Amazon toward his nonprofit the “Usher New Look Foundation.”"
