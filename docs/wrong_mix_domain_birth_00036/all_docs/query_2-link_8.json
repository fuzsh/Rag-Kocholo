        "text": "About the Initiative\n\nBeginning in the winter of 2021-2022, a handful of staff and volunteers began a deep dive into the people who made Victoria Mansion run for the Morses and the Libbys: the domestic servants. While we previously knew a handful of names, there were always more questions than answers about the individuals who worked here. Today, through extensive volunteer efforts, we know of at least 23 people – mostly immigrants or children of immigrants – who worked at the Mansion, and have discovered more about them as individuals from their descendants.\n\nIn 2022 we received a gift of items from the grandchildren of maid Hannah Shine, who worked for the Libby family at the Mansion in 1910. These are the first servant-related objects to become part of our collection, and we are thrilled to continue to move forward on this project.\n\nWe extend our gratitude to our colleagues at the Maine Irish Heritage Center in Portland for their ongoing assistance with this initiative.\n\nMorse Era (1860-1893)\n\nThe McDonnell Family\n\nAlice (lived at Mansion in 1885)\n\nSarah (servant in 1880)\n\nJohn (carpenter in 1879, 1885-1886)\n\nJames (stonecutter in 1886)\n\nFelix McDonnell (in some records, McDonald) and his wife, Alice, were Irish immigrants. They first went to New Brunswick, Canada, then moved just over the border into Downeast Maine for a time before moving to the Portland area. Their daughter Sarah is the only one specifically listed as a servant when she lived at the Mansion. Alice was recorded as a widow living at the Mansion in 1885. Alice and Felix’s son John was listed as a carpenter, and his brother James as a stonecutter. It is possible that these two men worked on the library bay addition (the only known Morse-era change to the Mansion’s original 1860 footprint).\n\nMembers of the McDonnell family lived at the Mansion various years in the 1880s and lived in nearby apartments when they weren’t here. It is possible that they acted as caretakers of the property while the Morses were away and stepped in as servants when the Morses were in the city.\n\nMichael D. Monahan (1850-1923)\n\nCoachman 1882-1883\n\nMichael was born near Tuam, County Galway, Ireland, and immigrated to the United States in 1873. He was a coachman for several families in Portland as well as a hostler (a person who took care of horses at a stable). Michael was married at the time he worked for the Morse family, so it is possible that his wife lived with him on the second floor of the Carriage House.\n\nJulia Foley (birth & death dates not yet known)\n\n(Position not yet known) 1886\n\nIn 1886, a local jewelry store ran a newspaper ad for winners in their monthly raffle drawing. Julia Foley, who lived at 109 Danforth Street, won a butter knife. With such a strong Irish name, she likely would have been a servant, not a guest, of the Morses.\n\nJames Webber (birth & death dates not yet known)\n\nCoachman 1891\n\nLibby Era (1894-1928)\n\nJohn Avidson\n\nCoachman 1896\n\nThis may have actually been John Johnson (below), whose name at birth was Johann Adolfsson. The city directory compiler may have incorrectly recorded his name as Avidson.\n\nJohann Adolfsson/John Johnson (1870-1954)\n\nCoachman 1898\n\nJohn was born in Sweden and immigrated to Portland in 1891. He was a coachman for several other families in the city as well as for the Libbys. He married and later worked as a chauffeur in the Portland area.\n\nCharles A. Carter (1849-1913)\n\nCoachman 1900-1901\n\nCharles was born on his family’s farm in Yarmouth, Maine. He worked as a coachman for various families in Portland and at times was a hackman (someone who drove a horse-drawn taxi). In some censuses, he is recorded as Black, in others, mixed-race. Charles’s brother John Carter, a pulp mill operator, married Anne McKinnon at the Abyssinian Meetinghouse, the oldest Black church in Portland, in 1897.\n\nWilliam Mosley (1874-1944)\n\nCoachman 1902\n\nWilliam was born in Nova Scotia, Canada, and immigrated to Maine in 1884. He was a coachman for the Libbys and then joined a Naval Reserve unit. He married and later was employed as a railroad brakeman and a factory worker.\n\nDavid Webster (1835-1924)\n\nCook 1905-1906\n\nDavid was born in New Hampshire and served in the Union army in the U.S. Civil War. He later moved to Biddeford, Maine, and worked as an upholsterer at the J.R. Libby store there. A Libby grandchild recalled that David “didn’t have any home or something, so he worked for grandfather [J.R.] in the Mansion, and he did some of the cleaning and kept furniture repaired.” The city directory recorded him as a cook in the household, likely relying on skills he had learned as a cook in the army.\n\nJohannah “Hannah” Shine (1880-1947)\n\nServant 1910\n\nHannah was born in County Kerry, Ireland, and emigrated to Portland in 1900. She was the Libby family’s cook in 1910, and worked for other Portland families before she got married. She was friends with fellow servant Katie Steed before and after they worked here.\n\nIn 2022, Hannah’s granddaughters donated some of her belongings to the Mansion. These are the first objects owned by a member of the domestic staff to be accessioned into the Mansion’s collections.\n\nKatherine “Katie” Steed (1868-1959)\n\nServant 1910\n\nKatie was born near Tuam in County Galway, Ireland and emigrated in 1891. She worked as a servant for several families around Portland as well as in Connecticut and New York City. She was friends with Hannah Shine for the rest of her life. One of Katie’s nieces was Sabina Grady, who worked for the Libby family from 1916-1923.\n\n(Earl) Clifford Mains (1887-1953)\n\nChauffeur 1914-1915\n\nClifford was born in Raymond, Maine. He was a chauffeur for the Libbys and other families in the area. He married a few years after he worked at the Mansion. He became a popular fishing guide on nearby Sebago Lake and was part of the nearby North Windham Fire Company.\n\nBridget “Delia” Clesham [Chisholm] (1889-1951)\n\nServant 1916-1918\n\nDelia was born near Spiddal in County Galway, Ireland. When she was born, her name was Bridget Clesham. She went by the nickname Delia and her last name changed to Chisholm at some point after she emigrated to the U.S. She was a domestic servant for several families in Portland. Delia worked for the Libbys until her marriage, when her sister Nora took over her position. She and her husband eventually moved to Massachusetts.\n\nSabina “Bina” K. Grady (1897-1970)\n\nMaid/second girl 1916-1923\n\nSabina (pronounced Sa-BYE-nah) was born near Tuam in County Galway, Ireland. She immigrated to Portland in 1914 to join several aunts who were already here, including 1910 Libby servant Katie Steed. Sabina worked for the Libbys until she married. She was later very active in women’s groups at nearby St. Dominic’s Catholic Church (today home of the Maine Irish Heritage Center on State and Gray Streets). Sabina is the only servant for whom we have a photograph taken at Victoria Mansion (top of page).\n\nBetsey C. Edgecomb (1878-1955)\n\nNurse 1917\n\nBetsey was born in Topsham, Maine, and went to nursing school at Maine General Hospital in Portland. She worked as a private duty nurse and was living at the Mansion in 1917, likely to take care of J.R. Libby before he died. She became active in leadership of several nursing organizations in Maine."
