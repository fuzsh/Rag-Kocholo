        "text": "In a brave gesture to put an end to the soaring death rumors, actress Joke Silva took her husband, the legendary Olu Jacobs, away to the elite Ikoyi Club in Lagos for some much-needed leisure.\n\nThe couple’s upbeat attitudes were captured in a 13-second video provided by the family on Sunday, which shows Olu Jacobs and his wife enjoying their time together, unaffected by the spiteful whispers.\n\nSee Video Below;\n\nBetty Irabor, a Nigerian columnist, confirmed this in a message uploaded on her social media account on Sunday.\n\n“Olu Jacob is well and alive; please disregard all rumors of his death. “He is alive, please,” she wrote.\n\nRumours of Jacobs’ death have previously circulated online without official confirmation.\n\nThis is not the first time similar gossip about the seasoned actor has circulated online. In June 2020, a similar report trended on Twitter (now called X) and Facebook.\n\nMonalisa Chinda-Coker, the then-spokesperson for the Actors Guild of Nigeria, later denied the report.\n\nIn August 2022, there was also speculation about the actor’s death.\n\nHis wife, Joke, later refuted the report and threatened legal action against anyone who propagated it.\n\nOlu Jacobs has been away from the movies, but he made a public appearance at the Africa International Film Festival Awards (AFRIFF) in Lagos, appearing sickly.\n\nIn an interview with Chude Jideonwo that aired on Channels Television, the actress stated that her spouse has been battling Dementia with Lewy Bodies (DLB) for several years.\n\n“He is coping with challenges that have been ongoing for some years. It’s known as dementia with Lewy Body. It is a degenerative disease that affects the brain, similar to Parkinson’s disease in that it affects the brain but causes no shaking. “It has an effect on the individual,” she explained."
