She described him as an incredible husband to his children and an amazing husband.\n\n“It hasn’t been easy. There was a point of acceptance for me that everything happening is reality and it is like the person I married, 80 percent of the time is no longer there.\n\nBut the thing is when he was there, he was an incredible father to his children and an amazing husband, he was practically my best friend.\n\nThe husband I knew is no longer there for me, but this man that is there is someone I still love”."
