        "text": "In a recent interview with media personality Nancy Isime, veteran actress Joke Silva opened up about her husband, Olu Jacobs’ battle with dementia. Jacobs, a well-known Nollywood actor, has been suffering from the condition since 2021.\n\nSilva said that the diagnosis has been difficult for both of them, but that she is committed to supporting her husband through his illness. She also revealed that Jacobs is no longer the man she married.\n\n“It hasn’t been easy, ” she said. “It’s almost as if the person you married 80 percent of the time is no longer there”.\n\nDespite the challenges, Silva said that she still loves her husband and is determined to stay by his side.\n\nDementia is a chronic brain disorder that causes a decline in memory, thinking and behavior. It is a progressive disease, meaning that it gets worse over time. There is no cure for dementia, but there are treatments that can help manage the symptoms.\n\nJoke continued “But the thing is this when he was there, he was an amazing man; my husband is an incredible father to his children and an amazing husband, he was practically my best friend. I could share anything with him.”\n\nShe mentioned that they had questioned Jacobs’ behavior at the early stage of the ailment until his condition deteriorated.\n\n“I always used to ball my eyes out, and then there came the point of acceptance,” she said.\n\nThe actress further revealed that her husband’s condition makes her feel like she is looking after her father as she now loves Jacobs “differently”.\n\n“So in this journey now, it’s like I am looking after my father, that’s the way it is because the husband I knew is no longer there, but this man that is here is somebody that I still love but love in a different way,” she added.\n\nThe Nollywood couple is not only well-respected in the film industry, but they are also admired for their lasting marriage."
