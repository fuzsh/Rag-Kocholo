        "text": "*It’s difficult for me and my wife to quarrel – Olu Jacobs\n\nVeteran actors, Olu Jacobs and Joke Silva, have become enigmas in the movie industry. With a combined total of about 78 years of experience between them, they are indeed a power couple in their field. They both tell TOFARATI IGE about their careers, Nollywood and their love story\n\nWhen was the first time you knew you wanted to become an actor?\n\nThat is a very interesting story. I was quite young–about seven or eight– back then in Kano State and I was sent on an errand by my parents. When I got outside (the house), I saw a lively crowd, going from street to street. I waited a bit and saw that they were giving leaflets to people, so I collected one. I was so happy. I went on to deliver the message I was sent by my parents and went back home. When I got home, I showed the leaflet to my mum but she was not impressed. I asked her to let us go and see the play that was advertised but she kept giving different excuses. I told her me and my siblings had cleaned everything and done all the house chores. But, she still refused. I continued begging her until my dad said we could go. The venue of the show was the Colonial Hotel on Church Road, Kano (before it was changed to Paradise Hotel). We finally got in after so much struggle but there was no seat in the auditorium. We eventually found a place to seat. It was nice to be there– there was a lot of camaraderie in the air and people were enjoying themselves. All of a sudden, the lights went off. But it was just one spot light that came back on. Everywhere was quiet, then Ogunde started to sing. I looked at the faces around me and saw contentment and happiness on them. I said that was the work I would want to do.\n\nWhen you made that decision, were your parents comfortable with it, considering that it wasn’t exactly a respectable job back then?\n\nI didn’t have the courage to tell my parents. But I told my brothers and sisters. I was always dancing and involved in plays in the church and school bands. I was practically everywhere, so nobody was surprised when I eventually declared that I wanted to do it (become an actor). Everyone supported me.\n\nCan you recall the first production you took part in and your experience while working on it?\n\nIt was a play I did for the British Broadcasting Corporation. It was (staged) on Christmas Eve. While everyone was getting prepared for Christmas, I was preparing for the show. I remember I was in the studio; people were enjoying themselves and we stayed there till very late. I actually didn’t leave the studio until past 12am but I was happy. I led them through it (the show). All that mattered was that I was on stage.\n\nAt a point, you travelled to England and trained at the Royal Academy of Arts in London. What impact did your time at that academy have on your acting career?\n\nI remember what happened the first time I left for England. Over there, they have an organised system. It is not like in Nigeria where anybody can be a production manager. There, you have to apply before you would be interviewed (for the job). I did all that and realised there was no other way to carry on. Then, a ‘part-time’ friend of mine came around to show off. He had just done a show with the BBC. I asked if he could connect me with anybody (there). He then called the manager’s phone. He was told that the only chance I had was to attend an audition that was very close and would start at 8 am, so I had to be there at 7 am. Then, I didn’t have an agent and my friend said I had to have one. So, I called a particular agent and told him I wanted to audition. He said he would grant the audition and asked who sent me (to him). On the day of the audition, I was there before 7 am. I eventually auditioned and we did the interview. After that, I went to the agent’s place. He was surprised. He just said, “You are good”. I can never forget that.\n\nYou acted in quite a number of English movies and television shows before returning to Nigeria. What are some of the values you got from working in that environment?\n\nOne has to decide in one’s heart where one wants to go and remain focused on that path. One has to keep all one’s ‘machines’ working and in good condition at all times so that they can be there for one when one needs them.\n\nWhat changes would you like to see in Nollywood?\n\nThere should be structures and stricter regulations. Everybody in the industry ought to pay membership fees (and other levies). All filmmakers, actors, make-up artistes and all other allied professions in the industry should be properly registered. And there should be a solid database.\n\nWhat are your thoughts on the quality of young talents in the industry now?\n\nThey are trying but they can do more. They are still behaving like they are acting but gradually, I believe they would calm down. Acting has to appear effortless and seamless; that’s why it’s called make-believe.\n\nHow would you describe your experience so far running the Lufodo Academy of Performing Arts?\n\nIt has not been easy because we are not getting the kind of cooperation that we expected to get from the government. It has been quite difficult but we just find the energy, one way or the other, and keep pushing.\n\nIt is widely believed that marriage between entertainers cannot work but you have put a lie to that. How were you able to make your marriage stand the test of time?\n\nWhen one is thinking for oneself alone, one has nobody to worry about. But the moment one has a partner, one’s thoughts change because everything one does from that point has to be done for two. Until one understands that, one cannot be said to be truly married. You have to factor in your partner in your thoughts at all times. Also, you have to come to an agreement (over certain issues) because there is no point in disagreeing. You must be able to talk to each other calmly, politely and respectfully, without shouting. If you have a tight schedule, you have to make sure you still find time for your partner.\n\nIn any relationship, both partners must be open and frank with each other. If you disagree, you can take some time to calm down and come back to deal with the issue.\n\nREAD ALSO: Sexiest Nollywood actresses of 2019\n\nThe first time you met your wife, you told her that you were going to marry her. What gave you the confidence to say that?\n\nThere are things one does that one cannot explain. Prior to the time we met, I had never seen her before in my life. But when I saw her that day, I didn’t even think about it– the words just came out.\n\nWhat were the qualities that endeared you to her?\n\nShe goes straight to the point and doesn’t mince words. I find that to be a very good quality. She is strong and polite. She is indeed a good girl.\n\nSome people believe that African men are not romantic. What’s your take on that?\n\nWhat do they know? Didn’t God know what he was doing before he brought the Caucasians. We are the (real) romantics, the white people are just followers. And that is what they have always been doing– following us.\n\nWhat romantic things do you do to keep the fire of love burning in your marriage?\n\nIt is nothing defined. If I see something she likes, I would get it for her and she also reciprocates. We do things for each other and it is very difficult to fight with each other.\n\nDo you engage in any house chores?\n\nIf I am in the house, I do. I enjoy cooking and sometimes, I join her (Joke) to talk and get things done around the house.\n\nWhat are your hobbies?\n\nI watch television, which I find relaxing. I also like to travel.\n\nHow do you like to dress?\n\nI like to dress moderately.\n\nDo you prefer traditional to English attire?\n\nWe (Africans) have more than they (westerners) have and when one has something no one else has, one can choose to wear it anyway one wants to. If people don’t like it, that’s their choice.\n\nWhat are the important qualities an actor needs to be successful?\n\nThey include talent, knowledge and discipline. With those three, one would get very far.\n\nHave you ever felt nervous on stage or on set?\n\nI feel nervous all the time whenever I have to perform– whether it’s in front of the camera, or on stage. I am actually glad for feeling that way because it means I haven’t taken the craft for granted. When I don’t feel nervous, I wonder what’s happening to me. But even when I feel nervous, once I spend a few seconds on stage or in front of the camera, it disappears.\n\nWhat determines the type of scripts that you accept?\n\nIt has to be fun. They don’t have to be passing a message but I usually like them to be well written. Even if it’s not well written; at least, there should be an idea (that can be worked on). Also, I consider if the writer or director is open to working with us (actors) to chip in some things. Performance– whether you’re working with film or theatre– is very collaborative. It’s not only the writer’s work. I don’t really like messing with the writer’s work but sometimes, they (writers) have the kernel of the work but they haven’t developed, pushed and interrogated it the way they should. And when one sees that, it means there is room for development.\n\nMany have criticised Nollywood movies for being predictable and without suspense. Do you share that view?\n\nNollywood has reached a stage where there needs to be value. This is an industry that has come to be as a result of a lot of struggles. There is an audience for the work but as the audience has got larger, instead of the budget to get bigger, so we can do more quality work, the budget is actually shrinking. I don’t get it.\n\nYou may say that VCDs don’t have a market in other parts of the world but there is a huge market for them in Africa. We refuse to sanction the bad behaviour of pirates. And because of that, a very lucrative area of the revenue stream in the continent has been denied the producer/creator of the works. Where we are now, people are just churning out stories. Sometimes, the budgets are as low as N1.5m to shoot a film. That’s not good enough.\n\nSo, that the films are predictable is because of the undervaluing of the work. Some of the biggest commissioning platforms that we have are commissioning at N5m. That way, the industry cannot be sustained and all the good hands would be lost. They would go to places that value their works. It’s that simple!\n\nYou’ve acted as a strict person in a number of movies. Does that bear any semblance to your true personality?\n\nI don’t think I’m an iron lady. I think I’m a girly person– one of the easiest persons to get along with. But I also don’t take any nonsense. I can be a bit liberal but I can also be pretty strict, especially when it comes to work. I don’t suffer fools gladly.\n\nIn what way do you think the government can best support Nollywood’s growth?\n\nIn several ways and they are doing some of that already. They are making facilities, such as loans, available. But there are other areas that can also be looked into. The government can intervene in several ways. It is an ecosystem. When it comes to the funding of the industry, there has to be loans, grants and equities.\n\nLagos State, for instance, is doing a lot of training and employment but as much as they are concerned about quantity in the area of impact, they should also be concerned about quality (in terms of impact).\n\nThe entertainment industry is the only one where you are expected to train people in a month. Other industries train people for as much as two years. I think that shows a lot of disrespect for the industry. For people to be properly grounded, anything less than nine months is a fallacy, especially when you are bringing new people into the industry. For me, new people shouldn’t even be trained for nothing less than two years. It is the people who have an idea of the industry that can be trained for nine months.\n\nWhat would you regard as the highlights of your career?\n\nI have had a lot of highlights. Producing the musical, Heartbeat, was one of them. I’m also the chairman of the board of the Centre for Contemporary Art, my late sister’s organisation, which has one of the best ‘Nigeriana’ and ‘Africana’ libraries in West Africa. I consider that an honour.\n\nI am a member of the board of the Savannah Centre for Democracy, Diplomacy and Development. In the buildup to the 2015 general elections, we went round the six geopolitical zones of the country, meeting with several people and trying to change the narrative of our political discourse that insists on violence. We let people know that we had to go beyond tribal politics and look at the political parties on the basis of what they have to offer. It was in the course of that I met the Obi of Onitsha, Obi Nnaemeka Achebe, for the first time. I also met the late president of Nigeria, Shehu Shagari; the Sultan of Sokoto, Sultan Muhammadu Abubakar, and other eminent personalities.\n\nWhat do you regard as the lowest moment of your career?\n\nThere was a show we did called, Digging for Gold, around 1997. We were trying to prove that one could run a show continuously for a month. I remember that there was a day there were only two people in the audience– my mother and her friend.\n\nMy mum (may her soul rest in peace) then said to me, “What’s happening? What kind of marketing have you done? How can you have such a good show and there are only two people in the audience?”\n\nShe started phoning different people and inviting them for the show. The following weekend, we had gone to a lot of schools in Lagos, and we never had that type of low turnout again.\n\nIs there anything you would do differently if you had the chance to start your career again?\n\nThere were so many things I wanted to do but didn’t end up doing. I recall that there was a theatre in Ikoyi (Lagos) I wanted to acquire. No one understood why I wanted to own a theatre. But I knew that without having a theatre, it would be difficult to have the kind of runs that make theatre (business) viable. Somehow though, I couldn’t articulate my vision.\n\nIf I were to start my career again, I would want to be able to articulate my vision better. Sometimes, I would describe the project to people and they would come back to tell me that some other persons had implemented the concept.\n\nHow would you assess the quality of talents in the industry currently?\n\nTo be honest with you, I don’t know a lot of the new entrants in the industry because my concentration has been on other areas. However, there are some I have seen that I am very impressed with.\n\nAdesua Etomi is one of them. She is such a powerful performer and she does the work.\n\nIt seems no actor from Nollywood has ever broken into Hollywood. Why do you think that is?\n\nI don’t think that is something to aspire to. We should get our industry so strong and tell our stories in such a powerful way that it would be impossible to ignore (us). We have a huge market and it cuts across all continents.\n\nHowever, I honestly think that we have to step up our game in terms of quality. When training people for the industry, we shouldn’t do it for the sake of just having many actors, cinematographers, etc. Rather, they should be so highly skilled that they would be sought after all over the world. All through the value chain in film production, we should strive to be the best that we can be.\n\nThe reason we have companies like Netflix in Nigeria is that they know there is an audience for our work. Our huge population should be a market advantage for us but it isn’t yet because we are poor. Is it a man that doesn’t know what he would eat that would subscribe to Netflix? That’s not possible.\n\nWe need to make it possible for the majority of our people to have the right kind of income that can afford services like that. Right now, it is the minority of people that can ‘spare’ money for such.\n\nYOU MAY ALSO LIKE: Nollywood history can’t be written without Giringory’s name —Son\n\nHow would you describe your experience as the Managing Director of the Malete Film Village?\n\nIt has been like pulling teeth. But I am hoping that we will make headway with the current administration in Kwara State. I’m optimistic about that.\n\nA lot of entertainers fight dirty on social media. As an elder in the industry, are you doing anything about this?\n\nPeople fight all the time, so what’s my business? Most times, I don’t even know who the fighters are or what they’re fighting over.\n\nThe issue of actors soliciting for funds from the public when they have health challenges has become a recurring decimal. What’s your take on that?\n\nThe (film) industry in so many other parts of the world has several revenue streams for every piece of work. In Nigeria, actors don’t get that. As an actor, one is supposed to get residuals (payments) from all the productions one has been involved in. but how can that even be possible when the entire budget of a film here is not up to the take-home pay of an international actor?\n\nPart of it is our fault in the industry because we have undervalued our work. However, there are some people who know better but because of their bottom line, they are taking advantage. I think that is where the government needs to come in. Imagine the same platform that commissions films for Nigeria and South Africa doing it at different prices (with Nigeria’s own being lower). Yet, our (Nigerian) stories are the ones selling the platforms.\n\nMany entertainers have said that marriage between two entertainers can’t work. Do you think your 30-year (and still counting) marriage to an actor puts a lie to that ‘theory’?\n\nI honestly do not agree that there are more marriage crashes in Nollywood than in any other industry. This is happening because the lives of the people in the entertainment industry are out there. Divorces happen in every industry– whether it’s medicine, law or engineering.\n\nThat being said, I think one of the challenges we have in our industry is that sometimes, people get married to an ‘idea’ of a person, not the real person. Someone could be so in love with Joke Silva because he sees her on the screen. But, that you see Joke Silva in films does not mean that you know her. Sadly, there are a lot of marriages (built on that premise) in our industry today.\n\nSometimes you see people who worked (in a movie) together getting married. That is because there is something called the ‘energy’ of a play because one must connect (with one’s co-actor) when one is working. It is that connection that some people assume to be love but it’s really not. Once you leave the location, the ‘energy’ goes to the next project. One needs to understand that so as not to get carried away.\n\nWhat went through your mind the first time you met your husband?\n\nThe first time I met him, he said I was the woman he would get married to. I looked at him and thought, “Who says that to a lady he’s just meeting for the first time?” but we became very good friends as time went on.\n\nWhen he said he wanted to marry you, what was your immediate reaction?\n\nI felt put off. He later apologised and said he didn’t know where that came from. We got closer after that.\n\nDo you discuss work at home?\n\nWe discuss movies, and our other works a lot at home.\n\nWhat are some of the things you do to add spice to the marriage over the years?\n\nI don’t know (Laughs). I just…I don’t know.\n\nAre any of your children following in your footsteps?\n\nYes– both of them.\n\nDid you ‘steer’ them in that direction?\n\nNo, we didn’t. They just showed an aptitude for it.\n\nWhat household chores do you like doing and which don’t you like?\n\nI hate doing housework. I cook only when I’m in the mood.\n\nHow do you relax?\n\nI watch films and read. I also listen to a lot of political discourse on the Internet.\n\nHow do you like to dress?\n\nI like to dress ‘fun’ but elegant.\n\nCopyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
