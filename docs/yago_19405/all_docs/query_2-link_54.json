        "text": "Nollywood power couple, Olu Jacobs and Joke Silva are celebrating their 35th wedding anniversary.\n\nThe multiple award-winning actress took to her verified Instagram account to thank God for the years she has spent with her sweetheart.\n\nShe wrote, “Totally forgot. 35 years together. Thank you Lord. Here is to many more. Happy wedding anniversary Omo boy @_olujacobs.”\n\nIn an interview with newsmen, Olu Jacobs had said that the moment he set his eyes on Joke Silva, he knew she was his wife.\n\nHe said, “We were having a management meeting for a play, Wole Soyinka’s Jero Metamorphosis, when a young lady walked in. Immediately she walked in, something inside me told me that she was going to be my wife and I told the people around me that I was going to marry her. That was in 1981. In 1986, we got married.”\n\nOlu Jacobs continued, “I was not in a relationship. I had a disappointment that kept me away and I never wanted any serious commitment because the wound was still raw but when I met her, we talked and played a lot and it surprised people a lot. We travelled together a lot as well.\n\n“When the time came, I did not hesitate and it was as if she was waiting for the question as well. I proposed to her in Tunisia because we were shooting a film, Ashanti. She came to join me there on her way to England and I asked her to marry me.”\n\nIconic Juju singer Sunny Ade has opened up about his relationship with his friend, the late singer Onyeka Onwenu.\n\nThe Tide Entertainment gathered that Sunny Ade had recently paid a condolence visit to Onwenu’s family.\n\nWhen asked about his relationship with Onwenu, by Newsmen, shortly after his visit to Owenu’s family, the singer began, “I can’t explain it; you know if they give you the news of the death of a loved one who has to do with your life and also your work.”\n\n“She’s not just an ordinary woman; she was someone who would sit down with you and she used to say, ‘Can I chip in some advice?’ and the advice was always correct,” he added.\n\nKing Sunny Ade fondly reminisced about her valuable input in his music and her contributions to his career.\n\n“She used to do more than I did; when it comes to music that people do together, she used to do more. She would tap me and say, ‘Sunny, let’s take it this way,’ and it was always good,” he detailed.\n\nThe nation was shocked at the news of the passing of Onyeka Onwenu on Tuesday, July 30, 2024. She mysteriously died after her performance at Stella Okoli’s birthday party that nigh, she reportedly slumped following her performance. She was then rushed to Reddington Hospital but unfortunately, she did not make it.\n\nAn eyewitness at the party who confirmed the tragic event to the paper said, “It is very sad. Onyeka Onwenu just performed at the birthday party of Mrs. Stella Okoli today, and after performing, she slumped. She was taken to Reddington Hospital and she couldn’t make it.”\n\nAn Akwa lbom born gospel artiste, Iniobong Sunday Titus, popularly known as Kx The Flow Butler has released a new album titled ‘ASCENXION’.\n\nThe hit album, since it’s release has witnessed a good number of listeners and download from its various music platforms across the federation with possible reactions from his fans.\n\nFlow Butler, who is also a practising architect professionally, gospel rapper and a singer-song writer has released his new EP album with an aim of reaching the top of the music industry in Nigeria.\n\nAccording to the Rivers State based gospel rapper his music is heavily influenced by his surroundings, culture and deeply rooted in the teachings of God.\n\nThe gospel rapper who came to limelight with his hit EP ‘ titled ‘ Kababa’, promised to always do good music that is capable of bringing healing, peace and lifting souls through faith in the redeeming blood of the saviour, Jesus Christ.\n\n“I am recognized for my inspiring melodies, energetic performance and meaningful lyrics that seek to uplift my audience. I gained recognition when I released a popular single called ‘God Serve’ from my previous EP, ‘Kababa’,” Kx the Flow Butler said.\n\nHe noted that the tracklist of the album include: ‘Blood of Jesus’ featuring Mr. Dee, ‘Turn Up featuring Larry Masuku, ‘Mone For Jesus’ featuring ‘Lucky Monday’ and Eze.\n\nThe EP ‘ASCENXION’ is now available on all major digital streaming platforms, spotify, Rhapsody, Deezer, music You Tube, Google play, Tidal, Amazon and others.\n\nMeanwhile, link to download the song on social media handles include Facebook:@kxtheflowbutler\n\nInstagram: @kxtheflowbutler.\n\nTikTok: @kxtheflowbutler and on X respectively.\n\nIt would be recalledl that the ‘ASCENXION’ was released last week, precisely on August 1, 2024.\n\nNancy Briggs\n\nChike’s music brings together listeners who yearn for the mesmeric sonics of RnB steeped in Nigerian cultural richness and familiarity.\n\nIt’s through this fine musical blend that Chike sang his way into the hearts of listeners whose patronage brought him the success and fame to crave Popstar status.\n\nHis sophomore album, ‘The Brother’s Keeper’ displayed his yearning for Popstar status with the music notably different from the smooth domesticated RnB of his brilliant debut. While his ambition was appreciated, his sophomore album struggled to connect with listeners.\n\nIt’s this fine balance as an RnB singer flying the Igbo cultural flag while showcasing an admirable ability to craft pop records that Chike achieves on his third album ‘Son of Chike’.\n\nA quintessential RnB star, Chike wears his hearts on his sleeve with music driven by melting melodies, heartfelt lyrics, poignant delivery, and a rich infusion of his Igbo culture down to the cover art that ties the project into a wholesome piece.\n\nChike offers his honest take on the complications of romantic relationships through songs that convey his yearnings as well as his hurt while striking a fine balance of RnB and Pop shaped by his Igbo heritage and Afrobeats production curated by his long-term collaborated Deeyaso.\n\nThe Tide Entertainment reports that Chike shares his desire to choose peace and tranquility over negativity in the opener where he sings his way into the hearts of listeners while displaying the elevated penmanship of an RnB star next to Ladipoe’s swaggering verse.\n\nHe wears his heart on his sleeves in a yearning for love and romantic bliss on the love anthems, ‘Apple,’ ‘Ego Onyinbo,’ and the Ogene and Highlife driven ‘Mma (Beauty)’ which adds to his rich repertoire of wedding serenading tunes and give the album mid-point a definitive Igbo cultural core.\n\nTo love is to hurt, and Chike shares the painful side of romantic adventures on ‘Someone,’ where he shares the hurt of unrequited love. He teams up with fast-rising sensation Qing Madi, who dazzles on the mid-tempo ‘Your Loss’ where they offer heartfelt love while maintaining a resolve to not settle for less.\n\nChike’s dismissiveness to a love interest on the log drum punctuated ‘Not Your Daddy’ introduces listeners to a rather bad boy side of the soft singing sensation this writer curiously hopes to get in larger doses in his future projects.\n\n‘Son Of Chike’ gets a fine balance of pop cuts shaped by Amapiano log drum and an infusion of his Igbo heritage. Chike crafts a chart-topping party-starter in ‘Egwu’ featuring the late Street pop sensation Mohbad, he swaggers on his declaration of love on ‘Lifetime Love’ where he mirrors Asake’s cadences, and he recruits Afrobeats seasoned hitmaker Olamide and emerging star Amaeya to share the message of hope and a better tomorrow on the log drum-driven ‘One Day’.\n\nWhile Chike enjoys crafting heartfelt romantic numbers, there’s the other side of him that stretches beyond the desire to simply entertain. This part of him introspects as he strives to understand his limitations and purpose. Chike embraces his flaws while striving to be better on ‘Balance Am’ before restating his faith in the superior power of the spiritual force that shapes his journey on the serenading closing ballad ‘Man Not God’.\n\nFour years, three albums, and several awards later, Chike’s beautiful journey with ‘Son of Chike’ holds up his status as an RnB sensation with superstar ambitions."
