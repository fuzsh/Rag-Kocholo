Thank you Lord. Here is to many more. Happy wedding anniversary Omo boy @_olujacobs.”\n\nOlu Jacobs had said that the moment he set his eyes on Joke Silva, he knew she was his wife.\n\nHe said, “We were having a management meeting for a play, Wole Soyinka’s Jero Metamorphosis, when a young lady walked in. Immediately she walked in, something inside me told me that she was going to be my wife and I told the people around me that I was going to marry her. That was in 1981. In 1986, we got married.\n\nOlu Jacobs continued, “I was not in a relationship. I had a disappointment that kept me away and I never wanted any serious commitment because the wound was still raw but when I met her, we talked and played a lot and it surprised people a lot. We travelled together a lot as well. When the time came, I did not hesitate and it was as if she was waiting for the question as well. I proposed to her in Tunisia because we were shooting a film, Ashanti. She came to join me there on her way to England and I asked her to marry me.”"
