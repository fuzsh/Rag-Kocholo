        "text": "Blessing Boma Douglas, daughter-in-law of veteran Olu Jacobs and Joke Silva, has retracted her assertion that her marriage has broken down.\n\nThe Nation community earlier reported how Blessing disclosed during a question-and-answer session with her fans that her separation is irreconcilable and can’t be repaired.\n\nBlessing made a spectacular U-turn on Friday, declaring that her marriage to Olusoji Jacobs is still intact. She later clarified that she was merely joking when she made the statement.\n\nShe said she was merely playing pranks with her fans in response to their incessant questioning about her marriage.\n\nShe said, “Those who know me, know that I can be quite playful, and one of the ways I like to connect with my community of followers is through my Instagram stories, a space purposefully curated to be light-hearted, serving as a virtual extension of my jovial personality.\n\n\"Now generally refrain from discussing my personal life within this space; however, after a series of incessant, and borderline insensitive inquiries about my marriage, I responded in the best way I knew I could – through humour and retorted with sarcasm.\n\n\"But given how fast, far and wide the appearance of bad news can spread, I have realized the need to be more cautious in my public interactions.\n\n\"On that note, Soji and I are still happily married and I will not be discussing the issue any further. And now that that’s out of the way, please feel free to discuss some exciting news.\n\n\"Atarahbaby, my US based skincare line is finally coming to Nigeria! Click the link in my bio to preorder from April 1st. God bless!”."
