She posted a photograph of her husband, captioning it, \"Showboy…Happy birthday dearest as you add plus 1 @_olujacobs. God is good…always. Sir Js fans have been celebrating his birthday since May. Note Today is the official day 11th July.”\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe actress has been open about her husband's struggle with dementia since 2021 and has been by his side every step of the way.\n\nSilva recently spoke up about how they have been coping and what it has been like loving him post-dementia, saying that \"sometimes it feels like her husband 'is no longer there'. She did, however, make note of how good a father he is to their children.\n\nEven though he has stepped out of the acting scene, Jacobs is a world-class actor and legend in the Nollywood sector.\n\nPrior to his illness, he had harnessed his acting skills for decades, garnering a whopping 40 years of experience under his belt. He has been described as 'one of Nollywood's finest actors, the best role interpreter, and the best manipulator of words'.\n\nFans and other Nollywood celebrities have felicitated the actor and prayed for his recovery in his wife's comment section."
