        "text": "Veteran Nollywood actress Joke Silva has addressed the recent rumours circulating on social media about her husband, Olu Jacobs, being deceased.\n\nThe news of Olu Jacobs' alleged death was initially reported by Nigerian media outlets on Sunday, June 30, 2024, prompting widespread condolences and sympathy across social media platforms.\n\nThis is not the first time such false rumors about the renowned Nigerian actor and film executive have circulated online.\n\nIn 2022, similar claims emerged shortly after Jacobs celebrated his 80th birthday, prompting a vehement response from Joke Silva on social media, where she expressed her outrage and threatened legal action against those spreading misinformation.\n\nHowever, clarifying the current rumour to TheNEWS and PMNEWS after the recent death rumor surfaced, Joke Silva emphatically debunked the claim, confirming that \"her husband is alive and well.\"\n\nEB"
