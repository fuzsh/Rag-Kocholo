Susan Saint James, who co-starred with Jane Curtin on CBS’ “Kate and Allie,” has given birth to a boy.

Saint James, 43, had an 8-pound, 14-ounce baby Sunday, said Richard Bisi, a spokesman at Charlotte Hungerford Hospital. He said mother and child were doing fine.

This is Saint James’ third child with her husband, former “Saturday Night Live” producer Dick Ebersol. She has two children from a previous marriage.

The couple plans to name the baby Edward Bright Ebersol.
