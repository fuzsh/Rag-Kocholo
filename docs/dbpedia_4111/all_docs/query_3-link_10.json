        "text": "Over the years, married entertainment industry veterans Dick Ebersol and Susan Saint James have racked up some pretty impressive accomplishments. He’s a broadcasting legend best known for co-creating Saturday Night Live with Lorne Michaels, as well as developing the concept for Sunday Night Football and producing numerous Olympic Games as head of NBC Sports, and she’s a retired actress who starred in shows like McMillan & Wife alongside Rock Hudson.\n\nNow the husband-and-wife duo—who already own properties in the beachside city of Santa Monica on the westside of Los Angeles, New England, and Colorado—have plumped up their real estate portfolio with another L.A. residence. Records show they recently paid $6.7 million for trendy modern farmhouse-style digs sited in the upscale and family-friendly neighborhood of Cheviot Hills, just south of Beverly Hills and Century City.\n\nRELATED: Vladimir Tarasenko Snags Miami Condo, Chris Paul Lists in L.A., and More Sports Celebrity Deals\n\nResting on a nearly quarter-acre parcel near the Hillcrest Country Club, the two-toned and wood-sided structure was newly built in 2018 and features five bedrooms and seven baths in about 5,800 square feet of space over two levels that boast European oak floors, high ceilings, a stylish capsule-style elevator, and a Control4 smart-home system.\n\nA set of steps ascends through a manicured lawn before emptying out at the covered front entrance. Once inside, a double-height foyer leads to a fireside living room on one side and a formal dining room with a snazzy chandelier on the other. In the rear, a family room displays a fireplace embedded within a charcoal-hued accent wall and glass doors spilling out to a terrace nestled alongside a built-in barbecue and bar, while a gourmet kitchen is outfitted with custom cabinetry, quartz countertops, dual islands, top-tier Asko, Sub-Zero, and Wolf appliances, a breakfast nook, and a butler’s pantry.\n\nRELATED: Serena Williams’s Former L.A. Estate Can Be Yours for $13.5 Million\n\nOther highlights include a tiered movie theater, a loft area for watching TV, and an office with its own bath, plus a luxe primary suite resting beneath a vaulted ceiling and offering a fireplace, two walk-in closets, and a marble-clad bath that comes with dual vanities, a soaking tub, and a glass-encased shower. Outdoors, the private backyard hosts a pool and spa, a fire-pit conversation area, and a detached building that currently accommodates a gym. There’s also an attached two-car garage out front.\n\nThe listing was held by Christopher Dyson of The Agency; Richard Maslan of Carolwood Estates repped the buyers."
