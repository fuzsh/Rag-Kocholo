        "text": "Sally was the spirited and daffy younger wife of San Francisco police commissioner Stewart McMillan (Rock Hudson). The two epitomized hip married couples of the late 1960s and early 1970s. They wore the modern styles of clothes and hair and fashion, and attended society events and upscale parties when they weren't solving crimes.\n\nAlthough she had no experience in law enforcement (or any other profession, for that matter), Sally jumped in and aided “Mac,” an attorney turned lawman, crack cases in the City by the Bay.\n\nThe lovable brunette was nominated for four Emmys for playing Sally McMillan.\n\n“McMillan and Wife” was one of three popular Sunday night NBC Mystery Movies in the 1970s. Filming just six or seven episodes per season, “McMillan” rotated with “Columbo” and “McCloud.” Hudson was reportedly the highest paid actor on TV when “McMillan & Wife” aired (1971-77).\n\nSusan had a contract dispute with the studio and departed from the show after the fifth season to work in feature films. The series continued a final season as “McMillan” and Sally's departure was explained that she'd died in a plane crash.\n\nAlmost decade later Susan returned to television to play impulsive and free spirited Kate McArdle in “Kate & Allie,” a series about two divorced women who shared a crowded apartment in New York. Kate and her roommate (Jane Curtin) were atypical characters on TV at the time, independent and strong women.\n\n“Kate & Allie” was rated No. 8 in the Nielsens its first season and was a Top 20 show its first four seasons. Susan was nominated for three Emmys, while Curtin won two Emmys for Best Actress in a Comedy Series.\n\nBorn in Los Angeles as Susan Miller to a family from Connecticut, Susan was raised in Rockford, Illinois. She began modeling as a teen-ager in New York after her brother married a model.\n\n“I never knew anyone could be so tall and thin,” she told the Rockford newspaper. She continued her modeling career in Paris, where she was “able to hobnob a little more with thin people... It was a good step, but it was not the most thrilling job in the world for me.”\n\nAs a girl she often pretended to be Natalie Wood after going to the movies in Rockford. When she turned 19 she changed her last name to Saint James and moved to Hollywood to fulfill her acting aspirations.\n\nWithout any previous acting experience, she was cast as magazine researcher Peggy Maxwell in the 1966 TV movie “Fame is the Name of the Game.”\n\nA year later, Susan's resume included guest appearances in “Ironsides,” and she became a regular in the TV series “The Name of the Game” (1968-1971).\n\nSusan felt that her acting was limited on “McMillan.”\n\n“I had a lot of problems when I first decided to leave the show with people wanting me to play the same character, glamorous and the wife of an older man,” she told interviewer Carolyn Jackson in 1978. “I say, I';m still young. Give me a chance to play some parts at my own age where I could be out having a little action.\n\n“Every week [on “McMillan & Wife”] we'd get these drug addicts and alcoholics and sleazy types, and these actors would be acting up a storm, and I'd be doing the same thing.”"
