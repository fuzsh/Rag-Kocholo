        "text": "In 1984, Jane Curtin and Susan Saint James starred in the series Kate & Allie about two best friends who decide to raise their kids together after going through divorces. The duo first worked together in the 1980 film How to Beat the High Cost of Living and later starred in Kate & Allie for six seasons until it was canceled in 1989. The show infamously “jumped the shark” by introducing a plot point where Allie got married and moved into a new apartment, with Kate moving in soon after. This led to its cancellation by CBS. So, whatever happened to the stars after the show ended just before the ’90s? Let’s find out!\n\nJane Curtin (76)\n\nAllison “Allie” Julia Charlotte (née Adams) Lowell\n\nAfter Kate & Allie, Curtin quickly moved on to a sitcom called Work It Out but the show was canceled after just 13 episodes. In 1993, Curtin went back to her Saturday Night Live roots by portraying Prymaat (Clorhone) Conehead in the film Coneheads. She then played Mary Albright on the sitcom 3rd Rock From the Sun from 1996 until 2001. Curtin has continued to act over the years both on television and in movies such as Broad City, The Good Wife, The Librarians, The Shaggy Dog, and more. Her most recent roles have been in the Pete Davidson series Bupkis and the film Jules. She has been married to television producer Patrick Francis Lynch since 1975 and they have one daughter.\n\nSusan Saint James (78)\n\nKatherine “Kate” Elizabeth Ann (née Hanlan) McArdle\n\nSaint James went in a different direction by almost retiring from acting altogether after Kate & Allie. She decided to focus on her family and five children after the show ended. However, she did return to Hollywood for a few rare appearances including The Drew Carey Show, Tattingers, Suits, and Law & Order: Special Victims Unit. She suffered from an unthinkable tragedy in 2004 when her 14-year-old son Teddy died in a plane accident. Her husband, Dick Ebersol and son Charles were in the plane as well but survived. She has been married three times but has been married to Ebersol since 1981.\n\nIn 2021, the cast of Kate & Allie participated in a livestream reunion for charity and talked about how much they loved the show and each other. Sadly it is not available to stream anywhere at the moment. What do you remember about the show?"
