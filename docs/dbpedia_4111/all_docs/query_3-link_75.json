        "text": "MARRIED. Susan Saint James, 35, actress who plays the chatty, ebullient Sally McMillan in the late-night reruns of McMillan and Wife; and Dick Ebersol, 34, NBC producer of the new Saturday Night Live; she for the third time, he for the second; in Los Angeles. The couple met two months ago, when Saint James was a host on a segment of Saturday Night Live.\n\nDIED. Charles (“Tex”) Thornton, 68, founder and board chairman of Litton Industries, who was architect of the modern management concept of conglomerates; of cancer; in Los Angeles. In 1953 he bought Litton, a tiny electronics company, and made it a huge conglomerate, acquiring some 40 firms that produced 200 products. As an Army Air Forces colonel in World War II, he won fame as the inventor of a “statistical control” system to keep track of the military’s global resources. In 1946, he and nine Army colleagues moved to the financially ailing Ford Motor Co., where they were nicknamed the Whiz Kids.\n\nDIED. Jack Albertson, 74, veteran actor who co-starred with the late Freddie Prinze as the misanthropic garage owner in television’s Chico and the Man and whose background included vaudeville, Broadway and films; of cancer; in Los Angeles. Albertson won two Emmys, a Tony for his 1964 Broadway role as the surly John Cleary in The Subject Was Roses and an Oscar for best supporting actor in the 1968 movie version of that play. Albertson played the soft-hearted Willie Clark in Neil Simon’s The Sunshine Boys on Broadway, and appeared in such films as The Harder They Fall and Period of Adjustment.\n\nDIED, llya Bolotowsky, 74, Russian-born painter and sculptor, who was one of the founders of the American Abstract Artists group; of injuries suffered in an accidental fall in an elevator shaft; in Manhattan. Bolotowsky was an abstractionist who worked with flat primary colors in geometric compositions. In 1936 he created one of the first abstract murals ever commissioned in the U.S.\n\nDIED. Harry Von Zell, 75, portly announcer who played the jovial neighbor on the Burns and Allen radio and television series; of cancer; in the Motion Picture and Television Hospital in Woodland Hills, Calif. Von Zell started his career in 1927 as a singer for a small California station. As a CBS announcer, he achieved notoriety when he introduced President Herbert Hoover as “Hoobert Heever.” Von Zell was a commentator on early March of Time programs and his quick wit won him roles on the radio shows of Will Rogers, Jack Benny, Eddie Cantor and Ed Wynn.\n\nDIED. Lotte Lenya, 83, raspy-voiced, Austrian-born musical actress best known for performing, and later resuscitating, works of Composer Kurt Weill, her first husband; of cancer; in Manhattan. Lenya’s signature role, which she premiered in Weimar Berlin, was the prostitute Jenny in Bertolt Brecht and Weill’s The Threepenny Opera. The Weills fled Nazism for the U.S. and, especially after Weill’s death in 1950, Lenya renewed her career on the Broadway stage (Cabaret) and in spoofy films (From Russia With Love). Said Music Critic Harold Schonberg: “She can put into a song an intensity that becomes almost terrifying.”"
