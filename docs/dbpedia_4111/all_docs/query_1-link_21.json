        "text": "THR has learned that Dick Ebersol, who resigned from NBC in May, and his wife, Susan St. James, have put their Telluride house on the market for $13 million.\n\nLocated the tony enclave of Mountain Village, the 7-bedroom, log-and-stone house sits among pines and aspens on 1.7 acres with mountain-peak views. According to the listing, doors, flooring and cabinets are constructed of rustic reclaimed wood and “chandeliers and fireplaces handcrafted by some of the West’s finest artisans.”\n\nAccording to San Miguel County assessor records, the Ebersols purchased the 12,962-square-foot residence in 2004 for $10.4 million.\n\nBuilt in 2001, the house also includes 7 full baths and a home theater.\n\nThe sale comes more than six years after they suffered the death of their 14-year-old son, Teddy. The teen, along with his older brother and father, were among the passengers in a private plane that crashed at the Montrose Regional Airport in southwest Colorado in 2004.\n\nIn July, Jerry and Jessica Seinfeld also listed their Telluride residence, an 11-bedroom, multi-building compound on 26-acres for $18.25 million."
