        "text": "Correction Appended\n\nIn a moment of triumph like so many others in a career defined by deal-making and producing, Dick Ebersol could not escape his sadness.\n\nIt was April 16, and memories of the jet crash last Thanksgiving weekend that killed his 14-year-old son, Teddy; left him bedridden for nearly 10 weeks; and injured his oldest son, Charlie, were still fresh. Yet Ebersol, chairman of NBC Universal Sports, was back at work, wrapping up a $3.6 billion deal to bring the National Football League back to the network.\n\nHe and other NBC officials had held informal discussions last summer, and he had spoken to two league officials within days of the crash. He had restarted the talks from the bed at his home in Litchfield, Conn., and had briefed Bob Wright, NBC Universal's chairman, at his bedside.\n\nNow he was at the conference table in his 15th-floor office at 30 Rockefeller Plaza, with NBC colleagues and N.F.L. executives, with reason for celebration.\n\n\"I felt a real joy that was almost total, for a second,\" he said in a three-hour interview in his office. \"Then I saw a picture of Teddy and I was overcome with sadness. How could I feel so good? My eyes started to fill with tears, and I didn't say anything for a minute or two, and I don't know if anyone else saw it or not.\"\n\nSteve Bornstein, the N.F.L.'s executive vice president for media, noticed. \"Dick was very emotional and understandably thoughts of Teddy are always near the surface,\" he said in an e-mail message.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
