        "text": "It was a reunion of sorts for Susan Saint James Wednesday in Hollywood during the ceremony celebrating her receiving the 2,364th star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.\n\nAmong the 300 or so people who attended, according to her sister, Mercedes Dewey of Roscoe, who also was there: John Schuck, who played Sgt. Charles Enright on the 1970s “McMillan and Wife” TV series that starred Saint James and Rock Hudson; and Allison Smith, who played Jennie Lowell, the daughter of Jane Curtin’s character in the 1980s “Kate & Allie” sitcom, in which Saint James also was a lead star.\n\nDewey said in a telephone call Wednesday that other notables in the audience included their niece, Christa Miller, who plays Jordan Sullivan on the “Scrubs” TV show, and Michael Johns, an “American Idol” contestant this year, who is a friend of Saint James’ children. Dick Ebersol, Saint James’ husband and chairman of NBC Universal Sports and Olympics, also attended.\n\nSaint James, who attended school as a preteen in Rockford where her family lived, wore a knee-length black dress, her sister said. And the weather was “gorgeous, 72 degrees,” Dewey said.\n\nRon Meyer nominated Saint James for the star, which is at 1645 Vine St., a block from the former YWCA residence where Saint James lived as an aspiring actress. Meyer was Saint James’ agent and now is president of Universal Studios.\n\nMaria Shriver, California’s first lady, was a guest speaker. She and Saint James have been longtime volunteers for the Special Olympics, founded by Shriver’s mother, Eunice Kennedy Shriver.\n\nDewey said Cara, a 34-year-old woman with Down syndrome, held a special place at the event. Cara’s grandmother lives next to Saint James in Litchfield, Conn., and Cara played with Saint James’ son, Harmony Lucas, when the two were young.\n\n“Susan made a big point (to talk about) the Special Olympics” in her acceptance speech, Dewey said, noting there were many people associated with the group in the audience.\n\nThe ceremony was held a day after the anniversary of the birth of Saint James’ youngest son, Teddy Ebersol. He died four years ago in a plane crash when he was 14.\n\nStaff writer Georgette Braun can be reached at 815-987-1331 or gbraun@rrstar.com.\n\nOthers with stars\n\nOther stars with area ties on the Hollywood Walk of Fame and their addresses:\n\nBarbara Hale at 1628 Vine St. She starred as Della in the “Perry Mason” TV series and graduated in 1940 from Rockford High School.\n\nRonald Reagan at 6374 Hollywood Blvd. The late 40th U.S. president made movies including “The Hasty Heart” in 1949. His childhood home was Dixon."
