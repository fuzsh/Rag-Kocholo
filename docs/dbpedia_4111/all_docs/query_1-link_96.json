        "text": "MONTROSE, Colo. -- The body of the 14-year-old son of NBC Sports chairman Dick Ebersol was believed recovered Monday after a fiery jet crash that killed two crewmen and left the executive and another of his sons hospitalized with injuries.\n\nCoroner Mark Young said a body matching the description of Edward \"Teddy\" Ebersol was found underneath the wreckage.\n\nThe aircraft with six people on board crashed during a snowstorm Sunday while taking off from the airport outside this small town 185 miles southwest of Denver.\n\nFederal authorities had no immediate word on the cause of the crash.\n\nWitnesses described a chaotic scene following the crash. Charles Ebersol, the sports executive's 21-year-old son, was screaming for help and saying his brother was still on the plane, according to Doug Percival, a driver at a towing service who was one of the first to arrive.\n\n\"Can you please help get him out?\" Ebersol pleaded, according to Percival. The elder Ebersol was sitting on the ground nearby, rocking back and forth.\n\n\"You could tell he was in shock. Both of them had been ripped out of their shoes,\" said Percival.\n\nWith light snow falling, crews began picking through the charred pile of twisted metal and a 6-foot-high shard of the fuselage. The two engines lay on the ground nearby near the tail section where they had been mounted.\n\nEbersol has been head of NBC Sports for nearly 15 years, and is perhaps best known for his love of the Olympics, which are broadcast on the network.\n\nHe and his two sons, Charles and Edward, were flying home from California, where the older son's school, Notre Dame, played a football game Saturday against Southern California. Another Ebersol son, 18-year-old Willie, is a freshman at USC.\n\nA heavy snowstorm had eased up before the plane prepared to take off, but there was no immediate word if weather was a factor. Steve McLaughlin of MTJ Air Services said his company did not de-ice Ebersol's plane before it took off. Airport Manager Scott Brownlee said he did not know whether the plane had been de-iced. Witnesses said it appeared the plane, a CL-602 Challenger, never got off the ground."
