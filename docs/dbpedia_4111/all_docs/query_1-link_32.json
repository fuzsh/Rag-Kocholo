        "text": "BELOW: The honor roll\n\nShe’s not a hometown girl, but that’s merely a technicality.\n\nSusan Saint James claims us, and we claim her back, with pride.\n\nAs we should.\n\nThe former Susie Jane Miller was born in 1946 in Los Angeles and moved here with her family at age 9. True, she modeled in New York as a teenager and was headed for Hollywood before she was 20. And she almost instantly became an Emmy Award-winning actress and signed a multiyear contract with a television studio.\n\nBut she returned to Rockford regularly during that time to visit her family.\n\n“It’s as close as I can get,” she told the Rockford Register Star years ago. “I’ll always consider Rockford my hometown.”\n\nIn Hollywood, the breezy and vivacious Saint James enjoyed such long-lasting success as a television actress that she earned generations of fans.\n\nMany viewers remember her breakout role opposite Rock Hudson as the charming, flower-child wife in the lighthearted mystery series “McMillan & Wife,” which ran on alternate Sundays from 1971 to 1976 — with “Columbo” and “McCloud” — as part of the “NBC Mystery Movie.”\n\nNearly a decade later, a new audience tuned in to see her with Jane Curtin in “Kate & Allie.” The show, which ran on CBS from 1984 to 1989, was as groundbreaking as “All in the Family” was.\n\nWith a deftly humorous touch, the series about divorced moms who move into a New York brownstone and raise their children together explored the challenges of single parenting, dating and women’s rights.\n\nAlong the way, Saint James relocated to Connecticut and married NBC Sports mogul Dick Ebersol. She had a son and daughter from a previous marriage, and she and Ebersol had three children. So when “Kate & Allie” ended its run, Saint James returned to Connecticut in a sort of semi-retirement to enjoy raising her family.\n\nShe made occasional guest appearances on popular TV shows. She also became active in civic, political and philanthropic causes, including the national Special Olympics and an effort to save the New American Theater in Rockford.\n\nShe continues to lend her name and financial support to causes and candidates she endorses. Her children are grown and her husband has officially retired — recently she told a Connecticut newspaper that both allow her and Ebersol to travel for enjoyment instead of for work.\n\nThe honor roll\n\n— 1969: Emmy Award for supporting actress in a series for “The Name of the Game.”\n\n— 1970-71: Emmy nomination for supporting actress in a drama for “The Name of the Game.”\n\n— 1972: Emmy nomination for leading actress in a dramatic series for “McMillan & Wife.”\n\n— 1972: Golden Globe nomination for TV actress-drama for “McMillan & Wife.”\n\n— 1973: Emmy nomination for leading actress-drama for “McMillan & Wife.”\n\n— 1973-74: Golden Globe nomination for TV actress-drama for “McMillan & Wife.”\n\n— 1975: Emmy nomination for lead actress in a limited series for “McMillan & Wife.”\n\n— 1980: Saturn nomination for best actress in “Love at First Bite” (award given by the Academy of Science Fiction, Fantasy and Horror Films)."
