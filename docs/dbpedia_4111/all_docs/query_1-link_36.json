        "text": "HOLLYWOOD -- Actress Susan Saint James, best known for her role opposite Rock Hudson in the 'McMillan and Wife' television series, has married 'Saturday Night Live' producer Dick Ebersol.\n\nThe private ceremony Saturday at Miss Saint James' Hollywood Hills home was disclosed Monday.\n\nA spokesman for the actress described the wedding as 'a very, very simple' affair with only a handful of guests in attendance.\n\nIronically, a repeat of a 'Saturday Night Live' segment hosted by the actress earlier this year was aired on the couple's wedding night.\n\nMiss Saint James, formerly married to writer Richard Neubert and makeup artist Tom Lucas, also lived for a time with rock star Stephen Stills. She is the mother of two children.\n\nThe actress, a former model from Rockford, Ill., won a supporting actress Emmy for her role as Peggy Maxwell in 'The Name of the Game' TV series and was nominated four times for Emmys for her performance as Sally McMillan, wife of the fictional San Francisco police commissioner played by Hudson.\n\nShe has also appeared in several movies including 'Outlaw Blues' and 'Love at First Bite.'\n\nEbersol was named producer the 'Saturday Night Live' comedy series last March. He was the program executive in charge of development of the show when it originated in 1975. It is his second marriage."
