        "text": "WINTER HAVEN -- Two sons of a prominent network TV executive who lost their younger brother in a plane crash more than a year ago were at All Saints' Academy on Friday to tell students their experiences in making a documentary film in South Africa.\n\nDuring the hour-long session with about 350 students, Charlie and Willie Ebersol shared thoughts, fears and anecdotes about the process of filming a documentary about the successful Ithuteng Trust School in Soweto, South Africa, a place where most students are either criminals or victims of crime.\n\nTheir feelings about the death of 14-year-old Edward \"Teddy\" Ebersol are just under the surface of everything they do.\n\n\"In America there's a really common thing -- a grieving period where you cry for a little while and then you get back to normal,\" Charlie, 23, a recent University of Notre Dame graduate, told the crowd, recalling a moment in Africa when his brother, Willie, tried to comfort a crying child.\n\n\"They said that she needed to cry it out, to deal with her emotions all the way,\" Charlie said. \"I needed to cry this out and experience the pain. I had to move past it in a certain way. I learned to be honest about our pain.\"\n\nOn Nov. 28, 2004, Charlie and Teddy and their father, Dick Ebersol, were among six people on board a jet plane that crashed while taking off during a snow storm from the airport in the small town of Montrose, about 185 miles southwest of Denver.\n\nCharlie and Dick Ebersol survived, but Teddy and two crewmen died in the crash.\n\nDick Ebersol is head of NBC Sports and is known for his love of the Olympics. He is married to actress Susan Saint James.\n\nAfter Friday's meeting with students, Charlie recalled the events of that November day and talked about the healing process that has followed.\n\nJust before the plane crashed, Charlie Ebersol said Teddy was watching a DVD recapping the Boston Red Sox 2004 World Series win.\n\nAs the plane was going down, Charlie Ebersol said while making a nosedive gesture with his hand, Teddy turned to his father and said, \"Dad, I'm scared.\"\n\nIn memory of their brother, Charlie and Willie wear rubber bracelets imprinted with a line Teddy included in a speech he made at school: \"The finish line is the beginning of a whole new race.\"\n\nThose, and other words written by Teddy are especially meaningful to the brothers.\n\n\"He wrote a 36-page autobiography that said any member of my family would run into a burning building to save another member,\" Charlie said. \"He said that on the highway of love, my family is neck and neck with God.\"\n\nWillie, 19, a sophomore at the University of Southern California, said has found comfort in how fully his brother lived in such a short time.\n\n\"He lived a complete arc,\" Willie Ebersol said, saying that seeing the Red Sox become world champions was a high point for his brother. \"I believe he died having finished everything that was important to him.\n\n\"We used to fight all the time and he taught me that if you really love someone, you have to work on it. You have to work really hard because you don't want to be mad at someone you love.\"\n\nThe brothers are traveling the country talking about their South Africa documentary, which will air on HBO in October.\n\nThe documentary, which cost $23,000 to make, has already raised more than $1 million to benefit the Ithuteng Trust School. The film follows three students who attend the school and the peril of their everyday lives.\n\nThe documentary caught the attention of Oprah Winfrey, who recently featured the young filmmakers on her show.\n\nTo illustrate the dangerous conditions children in Soweto live in, the brothers' filmmaking partner Kip Kroeger used the statistic that every 23 seconds a rape is committed in South Africa.\n\nKroeger said one of the most striking economic disparities he discovered in South Africa is that just minutes from the Ithuteng school, where children have experienced unimaginable violence and hunger, there is a Ferrari dealership.\n\nThanks to money raised from the documentary, the school is building dorms, a cafeteria and swimming pool.\n\nIf the money is managed correctly, the school will have water, food and electricity for years to come.\n\nThe Ebersol brothers are moving on to other projects.\n\nWillie is working for breast cancer awareness and is looking for another documentary subject he feels passionately about. Charlie will soon begin directing a movie with actor Dennis Quaid.\n\nThey also are working to partner high schools and colleges in the United States with sister schools in Africa."
