        "text": "IN the final weeks of his life, Johnny Carson wrote a letter to NBC Sports boss Dick Ebersol to console the network executive on the death of his young son Teddy, 14, in a plane crash.\n\n“The letter said, ‘It’s going to hurt like hell a long time, and then it’s going to get better,’ ” Ebersol said on “Oprah” yesterday. ” ‘But there will never be a day the rest of your life that you won’t ask why.’ ”\n\nYears earlier, Carson had also lost a son – who had once worked for Ebersol – in a car crash.\n\nYesterday was the first time the Ebersol family had appeared together in public to talk about the 2004 plane crash that killed Teddy and two others, and severely injured Ebersol and another son, Charlie.\n\nThe letter from Carson was among the first of about 4,000 that the Ebersol family received in the weeks after the plane crashed. Ebersol’s wife, actress Susan Saint James, answered almost every single one of the letters in the months that followed Teddy’s death, she said.\n\nBut wracked with grief, Saint James told Oprah Winfrey that she still cannot bear to touch Teddy’s clothes. “Here’s the bad part . . . I’ve never touched his clothes, I’ve never been able to move his things,” said Saint James, wiping away tears.\n\nDick, Charlie and Teddy were aboard a chartered Canadair CL-601 Challenger on Nov. 28, 2004, when it crashed during takeoff in light snow and freezing temperatures at an airport near Telluride, Colo.\n\nPilot Luis Alberto Polanco, 50, and flight attendant Warren Richardson III, 36, were also killed.\n\nThe plane had stopped in Colorado to drop off Saint James, an Emmy Award-winning actress who met her husband when she hosted “Saturday Night Live” in the early 1980s. At the time, he was one of the show’s producers.\n\nEbersol was badly injured in the crash but said that son Charlie – who paused often to cry during the interview – got him off the plane and saved his life.\n\n“He not only got me off of the plane . . . he ran back into the plane, which had three- or four-foot flames all around it, to look for his brother one more time, not knowing that his brother wasn’t on the plane.\n\n“And he lived through hell for two days ’cause somehow or other he thought he hadn’t found his brother, and it wasn’t until they found Teddy’s body, which was under the plane . . . that he knew that he had done everything he possibly could do.”\n\nDick Ebersol and Saint James said the family talks about the crash often.\n\n“I think we would all agree, the whole family would agree, that the amazing thing is you get up the next day, you brush your teeth, you comb your hair . . . life is so powerful, you just go on living,” Saint James said.\n\ndon.kaplan@nypost.com"
