        "text": "St. James, who was raised in northern Illinois, began modeling as a teenager. At 20, she moved to California, where she scored a part in a TV movie. A contract with Universal's television division in 1966 followed, along with an Emmy-winning role on the drama \"The Name of the Game\" (1966-70). Then came \"McMillan & Wife,\" in which she played Rock Hudson's spouse, from 1971-1977. She transitioned to movies after McMillan (in films such as 1979's \"Love at First Bite\"), but eventually returned to television. After doing a \"ghastly\" pilot, she starred with Curtin (her costar in 1980's \"How to Beat the High Cost of Living\") in \"Kate & Allie.\" Along with her efforts for Seedling and Pip, St. James still dabbles in acting: In 1999, she starred in a Torrington, Connecticut, production of \"The Miracle Worker.\" As for doing more gigs, she says, \"I think now it might be fun.\" But her numerous commitments -- which include serving on the board of the Special Olympics -- keep her busy. But these days, her personal life takes precedence. This summer, St. James reconciled with Ebersol, 55, the chairman of NBC Sports and her husband of 21 years, from whom she had filed for divorce in March. \"We had a second chance,\" she says. \"I'm amazingly happier, so that's a good sign.\""
