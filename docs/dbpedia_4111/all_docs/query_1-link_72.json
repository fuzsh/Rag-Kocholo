        "text": "NEW YORK — Dick Ebersol, who made NBC the TV home of the Olympics for more than two decades, will watch someone else run the network's coverage of next year's Summer Games.\n\nThe powerful TV executive behind shows from \"Saturday Night Live\" to \"Sunday Night Football\" resigned Thursday as head of NBC Sports after a contract dispute with his new bosses at Comcast.\n\nThe break was sudden and unexpected: Ebersol, 63, had been given a promotion when Comcast took over NBCUniversal earlier this year and appeared Monday at a presentation NBC gave to advertisers in New York, tossing footballs from the stage and talking about coverage of the 2012 London Olympics.\n\nNow, he said, he'll be an uninvolved spectator.\n\n\"I think it'll be fun once I get past thinking, 'I would've done that differently,'\" he said Thursday.\n\nEbersol, who is married to actress Susan Saint James, survived a plane crash that killed their teenage son in 2004.\n\nHe has had a profound effect on what the nation has watched on television since the 1970s — and his exit could portend big changes in the TV landscape in the next decade.\n\nEbersol said he wanted \"to make a really cool deal\" with Comcast executives, but \"we just couldn't get to the same place.\" His nine-year contract with NBC was due to expire at the end of next year.\n\nHe said his resignation was partly timed so it would be clear with both Comcast and the International Olympic Committee that he would no longer be involved with the Olympics.\n\nNBC designated Mark Lazarus, Turner Entertainment Group president, who joined NBCUniversal in February to run its cable sports operation, to replace Ebersol.\n\nIt's another major signal that the Philadelphia-based cable giant was breaking from NBC's recent past. During the same presentation to advertisers this week, new Comcast appointee Ted Harbert made it a point to say NBC had to do \"a little less reinventing the wheel\" and get back to broadcasting basics."
