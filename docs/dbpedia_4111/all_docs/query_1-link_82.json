        "text": "Saint James's first screen role was in the TV movie Fame Is the Name of the Game (1966) with Tony Franciosa, launching her career when it became a series two years later. Among her other early television appearances were two episodes of the first season of Ironside (\"Girl in the Night\", December 1967 and two months later, playing a different role in the episode \"Something for Nothing\"). She also had a supporting role in Where Angels Go, Trouble Follows (1968), the sequel to The Trouble with Angels.[citation needed]\n\nFrom 1968 to 1971, as a result of her first role in Fame Is the Name of the Game, Saint James had a regular part in the series The Name of the Game, winning an Emmy Award for her role as research assistant Peggy Maxwell in 1969 and establishing her as a popular young actress. The series format, set at a large media company, featured rotating lead characters played by Tony Franciosa, Gene Barry, and Robert Stack—generally only one of their characters seen each week. Saint James provided a measure of series continuity by appearing as a research assistant at various times to all three. She appeared in approximately half the episodes, usually in a supporting role, although her Peggy Maxwell was the primary character in the second-season episode \"The King of Denmark,\" alongside Franciosa's \"Jeff Dillon\". As well, in the first-season story \"Pineapple Rose\" (a Gene Barry segment), Saint James was prominently featured when her character was kidnapped in a case of mistaken identity.[citation needed]\n\nIn 1967, Saint James had a small part in the pilot episode of the Robert Wagner crime-caper series It Takes a Thief. This led to a recurring role playing a new character, Charlene \"Chuck\" Brown, Alexander Mundy's fellow thief and \"casual\" love interest. She was featured in four episodes of the series from 1968 to 1970. She went on to appear in the pilot episode of the western series Alias Smith and Jones (1971).[citation needed]\n\nThen came her first starring role as Rock Hudson's younger supportive wife, Sally McMillan, in the popular, lighthearted crime series, McMillan & Wife (1971–1976), for which she received four Emmy Award nominations.[citation needed]\n\nSaint James left the show due to a contract dispute but went on to further her career as an actress in feature films, such as co-starring with Peter Fonda in the film Outlaw Blues (1977). She achieved significant success in the vampire comedy Love at First Bite (1979) and followed up with a role in the comedy How to Beat the High Cost of Living (1980), co-starring Jessica Lange and Jane Curtin. Between films, she made a guest appearance in the March 3, 1980, episode of M*A*S*H (episode 192: \"War Co-Respondent\"). After other film ventures failed to establish her, she returned to television, starring in the comedy series Kate & Allie opposite Jane Curtin from 1984 until 1989. She received three more Emmy Award nominations for this role.[citation needed]\n\nSaint James was a celebrity guest commentator for the World Wrestling Federation's WrestleMania 2 event in 1986 along with Vince McMahon.[citation needed]\n\nIn her mid-40s, Saint James retired after Kate & Allie ended.[1][3] In addition to motherhood (her second-youngest son was born during the fourth season of Kate & Allie), she has been an active volunteer with the Special Olympics (an organization she began actively supporting in 1972).[4][5] She has served on the Special Olympics board[3] and was Civitan International's celebrity chairperson for their Special Olympics involvement.[6] She also is a board member of the Telluride Foundation.[7]"
