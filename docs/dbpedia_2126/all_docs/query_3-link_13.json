        "text": "Hit N Run Phase Two\n\nMore than any other solo artist reviewed on this site (the only person in a band context that I think would come close to this is Ian Anderson of Jethro Tull), Prince was too talented for his own good. He was an Evolutionary Stevie Wonder, a one-man (when he wasn't fronting a band, of course) funk wrecking machine who regularly showed himself capable of making some of the best music of his time. In his prime, there were few, if any, artists, black or white, who were able to make music that was so wildly popular and likewise so cutting-edge. He'll go down in history as one of the best rock guitarists of his era, as a great and expressive singer, and by all accounts one of the most interesting live performers of all time. If you don't have an allergy to the kinds of synth tones the man relies on, and you don't get excessively weirded out by all of the excessive vulgarity or his strange personal life or all that nonsense with changing his name to a symbol temporarily, chances are good that his best stuff will bring you back to it over and over.\n\nUnfortunately, the bulk of his career has been plagued by an alarming and often flabbergasting lack of quality control. For all of his positives (and he sure had them), he didn't seem to have the inner voice that could tell him when an idea might not have been worth recording, or that a track might not have been worth releasing. He was caught in a strange middle ground, where he struck gold often enough that he'd earned the right to follow his artistic instincts, but where he also failed frequently enough that his career was nearly overwhelmed by his instincts gone awry. This middle ground problem extended to his handlers as well; who was going to say no to the guy who did 1999 and Purple Rain? As time went on, his work got less and less connected to the world around him (he was reportedly quoted once as saying the only music he listened to for inspiration was his own), and it naturally sold less and less without being especially interesting in compensation (this music wasn't terrible overall, but not inspiring). I've actually long wondered if Prince wouldn't have been better off in a full band, with an equally talented and strong-willed personality in place to keep him and his ideas and check. Then again, pretty much the only person in music history that I can think of who would have been an adequate match would have been Sly Stone, and he wasn't an eligible choice for a lot of reasons.\n\nStill, Prince is neither the first, nor will be the last, artist reviewed on this site who had a career arc consisting of an early period of greatness and a maddeningly long period of inconsistent mediocrity thereafter. Whatever may be, he was one of the most interesting entertainers of his era, from his fascinating combination of mainstream leanings and artistic idiosyncracies, to his hilarious censor-baiting, to his strange relationships with his recording companies, to all sorts of other things. Add in that he's got a decent number of really good albums, and a lot of good songs, and it should be no wonder that my disposition towards him is more positive than not. Even if stretches of this page might end up suggesting otherwise.\n\nWhat do you think of Prince?\n\nLoren Ernst (loren.hipango.gmail.com) (07/13/14)\n\nOne of my favs. Good critique. Enjoying reading your thoughts. Makes me think more about what I'm listening to but prince will always be my main man\n\nFor You - 1978 Warner Bros.\n\n8\n\n(Good / Mediocre)\n\nBest song: I'm Yours\n\nThe most hilariously appropriate piece of trivia associated with Prince's debut is that it came in at three times over budget. This album is usually dismissed as being a slight effort that doesn't really give a hint as to what would come later, but while this is certainly nowhere near as self-assured as Dirty Mind or Controversy, I can't really agree with the notion that this album sounds fundamentally different from the later stages of his career. Made at the tender age of nineteen, this album already shows Prince the multi-instrumentalist (every instrument and vocal part is solely from him), and likewise already shows Prince the absurd obsessive-compulsive, endlessly tinkering with minimalist funky arrangements swimming in keyboards. It's more rooted in conventional 70's funk and pop than later albums would be, but the twists he puts on these ideas are already eyebrow-raising.\n\nExactly how normal is an album that starts with the title track and \"In Love\" supposed to be, anyway? The title track is a multi-tracked a capella piece that doesn't last much more than a minute, and \"In Love\" has one of the goofiest underpinning grooves of any disco song I've ever heard. One thing this song is definitely not is commercial in any reasonable sort of way: the melody might have made this into an acceptable radio single, but the synths sound so strangely lightweight and novelty-ish that they would have scared a lot of people away. Personally, I think the song is an absolute hoot, and I like to imagine the confused look of the first record company executive who got to hear these weird synths combined with lines like, \"I want to bathe in your river.\" Continuing in this goofy pop-funk vein is \"Soft and Wet;\" this was actually released as a single (even with that title!), and not surprisingly it didn't really do very well on the charts. Still, it's a decent enough song, and it sure sounds way ahead of its time.\n\nOf course, the album starts to get spotty past this point. One area where Prince struggles a bit on this album is in his ballads: \"Crazy You,\" \"Baby\" (which at least has an interesting lyrical topic) and \"So Blue\" (which actually has a countryish feel to it and some interesting guitar/synth noises here and there) each start off seeming to have some potential, but they all fail to develop this potential adequately, and they drag down the rating considerably. \"My Love is Forever\" is more rhythmic and up-tempo than those songs, but it still lacks in hooks, and it doesn't really work as a ballad or as funk.\n\nThe album's other tracks, though, amply show that Prince, even at this stage in his career, had some serious bonafide strengths. \"Just as Long as We're Together\" is the album's stretch-out funk/disco workout (and don't forget, all the instruments here are played by the man himself), and it shows that Prince could fill a track of this kind with good ideas as well as anybody at the time could. Especially pay attention to the extended coda (an instrumental piece that Prince originally recorded separately), where the bass/percussion groove switches into something noticably more intense and where all sorts of synth and guitar parts are thrown into the mix. This is the way I wish more disco grooves would go; it's a perfectly fine genre if you fill the space above the groove with a nice variety of ideas (note that Prince would continue to show himself amply capable of this in the next album's best tracks).\n\nThe best track on here, though, is easily the closing \"I'm Yours,\" featuring a knock-your-socks-off epic-sounding guitar line in the introduction (and more great parts in the breaks), and featuring a red-hot groove that doesn't let up for the whole five minutes. The way Prince builds the tension in the verses up to the \"I'M YOURS\" climax each time is fantastic, and when combined with everything else it's enough to make this one of my very favorite Prince tracks. The man might not have had any semblance of consistency yet, but heck, he didn't really have that in spades later on; let's recognize and tip our hats to a great Prince song when we get it.\n\nSo ok, the album is no Dirty Mind, and he wasn't going to gain a mass audience with this exact mix of styles, but it's most definitely a better album than not. No Prince fan should feel embarrassed to own this.\n\nSend me your thoughts\n\nPrince - 1979 Warner Bros.\n\n7\n\n(Mediocre / Good)\n\nBest song: Bambi\n\nThe biggest problem with Prince's second album is that it clearly wasn't what Prince would have made had he been left to his own devices. As expected, his record company wasn't thrilled that the debut had been such a financial disaster (too expensive to make, too few copies sold), and there was pressure for the album to have a greater appeal to a mainstream audience than the last one had. And so Prince compromised, arguably for the only time in his career, and while the album has some material that's both commercially appealing and interesting decades later, there's a lot of material that's disposable.\n\nOnce again, the ballads are not very good on the whole. The closing \"It's Gonna be Lonely\" is a highlight (the rising synth line in the chorus is a winner), but the other three (\"When We're Dancing Close and Slow,\" \"With You\" and \"Still Waiting\") are incredibly dull numbers that could have been done by any soul artist with a tenth of Prince's talent. The falsetto singing is decent enough and somewhat emotional, but there's a serious lack of strong melodies or atmosphere or anything interesting to keep my mind from wandering. These songs need some personality, dang it.\n\nThe non-ballad tracks tend to be much better, though they somewhat pale to what would come within just a year or so. \"Bambi\" is a great piece of funky hard rock, with a great set of crunchy riffs and aggressive, passionate singing as needed; it may well be the missing link between Jimi Hendrix and Lenny Kravitz, but I won't hold that against it. The opening \"I Wanna be Your Lover\" is a nice piece of funk-lite, with a strong chorus hook and amusingly eyebrow-raising lyrics like, \"I wanna be your lover, I wanna be your mother and your sister too.\" \"Why You Wanna Treat Me So Bad\" is even better, featuring another decent groove, another solid chorus and a great guitar solo in the extended coda. \"Sexy Dancer\" is an all-out disco groove, and it's not up to the standards of \"Just as Long as We're Together,\" but it's decent, and Prince's vocal exhales are amusing enough. And finally, \"I Feel For You\" may have some terrible-sounding synths high up in the mix, but the vocal melody interacts with them well enough, and I like the song more than not.\n\nOverall, Prince has some nice aspects, but it's a clear step back from the debut, and if Prince had continued in this same vein he would have been forgotten within a couple of years. If you can't get the best songs from a compilation or thereabouts, consider getting it, but don't pay full price.\n\nSend me your thoughts\n\nDirty Mind - 1980 Warner Bros.\n\nB\n\n(Very Good)\n\nBest song: When You Were Mine\n\nOne of the most underrated acts of bravery by somebody involved in the music business since the dawn of the \"rock\" age was done by the record executive(s) who greenlit the release of Dirty Mind. After steering Prince away from the eccentricities of For You and into a more obviously pleasing sound like that on Prince, the relevant executives at Warner Bros. probably nearly had a collective heart attack hearing this the first time. An album consisting of home demos? An album with nothing resembling the hits (\"I Wanna be Your Lover,\" \"Why You Wanna Treat Me So Bad?\") of the previous album? An album full of songs whose subject matter would ensure it would be a herculean task to get these songs played on the radio without violating decency standards? Allowing this album to be released required a leap of faith that at least maybe critics would like it, and that it might become a cult favorite down the line. Well, they got what they wanted: critics largely drooled over this album, and the success of this album was able to launch Prince's career in earnest and largely change pop music history. It may not have been an especially \"revolutionary\" album in terms of its raw materials, but the combination of them definitely created something new and interesting.\n\nToday, the album sounds relatively conventional: a New Wave-influenced, stripped-down dance-pop album, with lyrics about various bawdy topics sung at a volume where you don't easily notice them. The funny thing is, I feel like this album would have been plenty enjoyable no matter what the lyrics were, simply because this a fantastic collection of tunes that weirdly benefits from the minimalist arrangements. \"Gotta Broken Heart Again\" might be a little too conventional and short to make much of an impression, but every other song on here does something interesting enough to make it stand out in a strong way. It's all dance-pop, sure, but it's all dance-pop done in a refreshingly \"organic\" sort of way, and the hooks are some of the best of Prince's career. The lyrics add an interesting extra layer to the songs, sure, but these songs would all do just fine without them.\n\nThe opening title track is nothing short of a dance-pop classic, prominently featuring a great keyboard riff and a great vocal melody (with lyrics about what his mind wants to do to a girl whenever he sees her) that mirrors the keyboard chord sequence impressively. There are no clear verses or choruses, but somehow that just works with the general aesthetic. \"When You Were Mine\" prompted a ton of controversy because one of the verses mentions a threesome, but I think that focusing on that line kinda misses the gist of the song. Ultimately, the song's topic is as old as pop music itself: \"We used to date, now you like another guy more than me, but I still like you, and maybe even more than before.\" This song takes that idea into previously unexplored territory, of course, but it's hardly the giant leap into degradation that it's made out to be (and that Prince's lyrics would involve in future years, or even later in the album). And besides, I don't think the lyrics should overshadow the song itself: it's essential synth-pop, with a nice texture of guitars and another terrific vocal melody in both the verses and the chorus. Prince once said that he got the idea for the song from listening to John Lennon, and that doesn't surprise me in the least: this is just a great pop song, no matter what else.\n\n\"Do it All Night\" has a less-than-ideal synth tone in the introduction and in the bridge, but it has a nice enough groove, full of tasty bass-guitar licks, and it's a keeper. After passing through the slight filler of \"Gotta Broken Heart Again,\" we come to \"Uptown,\" a terrific (and almost angry in places) funky groove that talks about a place where people aren't hung up on race and other differences. Well, it also talks about how people there express their lack of racism and bigotry by getting it on with any-and-everybody there, but I guess that's to be expected. Personally, I like to focus more on the fantastic low-key guitar playing than on the message, but everything about the song is good, in the end.\n\nThe next two songs almost sound to me as if Prince made a bet with somebody about how vulgar he could make his lyrics and still get them released on an album. \"Head\" is a solid dance groove that details Prince's, um, interactions with somebody else's soon-to-be-bride (and her wedding dress) and how he steals her away for himself. Whatever, it's a good song, and the synth solo in the middle is very interesting. \"Sister\" is a decent (though very brief, at 1:31) rock-funk groove, telling the story of a woman teaching her teenage younger brother the birds and the bees (\"Incest is everything it's said to be!\"), then making him turn tricks for her financial benefit. Holy moly. The last song, \"Party-up,\" is refreshingly not about sex (I'm relatively tolerant of such things, but the previous two tracks start stretching me thin in that department), but instead is about ending military conflict through the power of partying. It's kind of a silly juxtaposition, but it somehow works, and there's something strangely satisfying about hearing a solid funk-disco track climax in \"We don't want to fight no more!\" What a fascinating dude.\n\nSo ok, this isn't Prince's greatest work, and it's a little short (30:14, and not filler-free) to be considered an all-time classic, but it's still a bold statement that contains some of Prince's best music. If you're not sure whether Prince is for you (and for some reason Purple Rain doesn't grab you), this is probably the best place to start.\n\nSend me your thoughts\n\nControversy - 1981 Warner Bros.\n\nD\n\n(Great / Very Good)\n\nBest song: Controversy\n\nNow this is one self-assured album. It's based on the same general foundation as Dirty Mind, but it's denser, more fully arranged (no demos here!), more powerful in its grooves, more intricate in its world philosophy, and generally more grown-up than its predecessor. The trade-off is that the songs are somewhat less immediately memorable, and as a result the album has usually been considered a slight step down from the albums bookending it (though this attitude seems to have changed over time). Well, I pretty much loves me this album; this is the point where Prince sounds completely out of his cocoon (even more so than with Dirty Mind) and where his beliefs in his own abilities are completely justified by the quality of the songs.\n\nOne of the most amazing aspects of this album is that Prince was still in one-man-band mode; only the closing \"Jack U Off\" (a hilarious cheesy-synth-based rockabilly ode to mutual masturbation; it's ironic that this is the one song on the album that isn't Prince literally playing with himself) has any contributions from others. In terms of thickness of the arrangements, the songs on here could have easily fit on any of his Revolution albums from the next few years, and that's a pretty remarkable feat. It's one thing to sound like a young kid experimenting in the studio: it's another to sound like a full-fledged 80's synth-based art-funk band all by yourself. I mean, how in the world is the opening title track the product of one person's incessant overdubbing? This is one of the most fascinating combinations of beat-heavy groove and of multiple non-trivial song ideas I could possibly imagine, and it was all done by one man! Putting that aspect aside, this is just one fantastic song: lyrically, it focuses on Prince's fascination with other people's fascination towards him, and even features a recitation of the Lord's Prayer in the middle (another way to tweak people, I suppose) and a fascinating mantra near the end that seemingly sums up his life philosophy (\"People call me rude, I wish we were all nude/I wish there was no black and white, I wish there were no rules\"). Musically, it's one of those tracks that I can recognize as having a lot of elements in common with 80's music that I don't necessarily enjoy, but where the combination as presented here is enough to suck me in and then some. The verse melody, the chorus, the fascinating beat, the subtle rhythmic guitar parts, the cool use of synths and other things I'm not thinking of make for such a great use of seven minutes that I'm almost ready to forgive him for the Batman soundtrack. Almost.\n\nUp next is \"Sexuality,\" essentially a sexualized version of the old adage of \"free your mind and the rest will follow.\" It doesn't especially break new ground for him lyrically (though the random diatribe against \"tourists\" who come into his sexual utopia is hilarious) or musically (it's basically just a fast funk-rocker), but gosh does it have one heck of a groove and some GREAT vocals. And speaking of great vocals, the following \"Do Me Baby\" is easily the best Prince ballad to this point; once I was able to accept the possibility that a song that so prominently features a lengthy sex noise sequence in the second half might be something I could enjoy without feeling ashamed of myself, I began to see it as an obvious highlight of the album. We're a long way from the plastic, go-through-the-motions ballads of Prince; this is rife with real passion in both the instrumentation and in the singing, and you can't ask for too much more than that in a song like this.\n\nThe second half kicks off with \"Private Joy,\" which kinda sounds like a Dirty Mind leftover, and it's almost certainly the album's weakest track. Still, the main synth line is nice enough, as is the vocal melody, and I can think of more than a few Prince albums where this would have been a highlight. The track is also deceptively normal compared to the next three tracks, which fill out the album before things finish with \"Jack U Off.\" \"Ronnie, Talk to Russia\" is a two-minute, almost punk-rock (except that the arrangement is way too thick and grumbly and synth-heavy) political statement about nuclear disarmament, and it's so catchy that I can overlook the fact that it's so ridiculous. \"Let's Work,\" which follows, at first seems like a relatively simplistic dance-pop groove (about \"working,\" wink wink nudge nudge), but the synth parts and the vocal melody are both pretty intricate, and it's a fun interlude before what comes next.\n\n\"Annie Christian\" is just freaking bizarre. It's a weird mishmash of incongruous synths and guitars, with Prince eschewing singing for a rhythmic spoken rant (with overdubbed backing vocals as needed) about ... lots of things. I guess the Annie Christian character is supposed to be Satan or Evil Incarnate or something like that (there are allusions to materialism, lying, capital punishment, and the shootings of Lennon and Reagan), and the song keeps coming back to the curious phrase, \"Annie Christian, Anti-Christ/Until you're crucified/I'll live my life in taxicabs.\" I'd say something along the lines of, \"the meaning of this track could only be understood by Prince,\" but I'm not even sure that he'd be able to tell you what exactly he was literally going for. This kind of messing with his audience would eventually get a little tiresome, but this time around I'm totally on board with Prince's expression of tweaked paranoia.\n\nThe rating might seem a smidge high, but after some consideration (I waffled between a C and a D) it's totally justified. It has only one clear weak link; it has a fascinating mix of styles (especially for an entire album that's basically 80's dance-pop); it has some strong, definite highlights, and it's soooooo interesting. For now, with Prince near the height of his powers, his self-indulgence was only a good thing, and if you're not somebody who thinks catchiness is the primary rubric by which Prince should be judged, it's tough for me to see how you could be a Prince fan and not really like this. This is a must own.\n\nSend me your thoughts\n\nEdward J Gorski (egorski13.mail.bw.edu) (02/13/18)\n\nThis album really grew on me in a way I never expected it to. I've always loved the title track, but on first listen, I wasn't that keen on the rest. It really wasn't until my third or fourth time through that I began to appreciate just how clever Prince is, and just how much of that cleverness shows in the music. It somehow worked its way to tied for 3rd for best Prince album (tied with Sign O' The Times, and behind 1999 at 2 and Purple Rain at 1).\n\nBest track is hard for me to say. The entire first side is a contender here. Controversy has a beat that never lets up, and I especially love the slightly blasphemous addition of The Lord's Prayer. Sexuality includes one of the best closing monologues that Prince ever came up with. But I think the best is Do Me, Baby. This is probably the first song I've ever referred to ask \"sexy.\" Side two isn't quite as strong, but I love Annie Christian, Ronnie, Talk To Russia, and Jack U Off.\n\n1999 - 1982 Warner Bros.\n\nA\n\n(Very Good / Good)\n\nBest song: 1999\n\nThis album formally marks the beginning of the second stage of Prince's career, where he graduated from a lone multi-instrumentalist weirdo into the leader of a full-fledged band, The Revolution. Not that it makes much difference; aside from guitar work on \"Little Red Corvette,\" the only contributions from the other members come through their backing vocals (which I do admit give a surprising amount of variation and depth to the sound). The decision to bring in a band becomes all the stranger when you consider that the sound is now heavily based around drum machines (as opposed to Prince's own drumming) and is even less guitar-based than before. Plus, it's not as if Prince was suddenly deferring to his bandmates in the songwriting or overall approach; there's a reason that \"Prince\" is so much more prominent than \"The Revolution\" on the cover. Actually, come to think of it, I'm not sure that bringing in a formal band (as opposed to just having a few people on the side getting session royalties) made any sense; did Prince think having a band would increase his commercial appeal? Strange.\n\nIndeed, the major fundamental change on this album didn't come from the addition of a band, but rather a change in what kind of listening experience Prince was going for. Controversy, simply put, is not an ideal album for background listening; it's an 80's synth-funk album, but it's deeply twisted in the sort of way that makes it geared towards the kind of \"serious\" listening that music geeks like me do while we make \"deep\" observations and tell ourselves we're oh-so-clever for noticing them. 1999, on the other hand, is an album designed for mass-consumption; it front-loads with radio-friendly material, then packs itself with seemingly endless, beat-heavy jams that would've been ideal for parties, and finally sticks anything remotely draggy or difficult in the second half (where it won't register heavily in the minds of casual listeners). Now, I'm not somebody who's really thrilled with the \"developments\" of this album, at least not in the abstract; I am a music geek first and foremost, after all, and while I certainly don't mind when artists soften their approach to make themselves palatable to a wider audience, I'm not somebody who's strictly going to equate greater popularity with greater quality. Plus, the fact that something is \"great party music\" or \"great dance music\" isn't going to win me over automatically; I've always felt that the worth of a piece of music is tied primarily to its effect when the listener isn't doing anything else, as opposed to its benefits in specific applications (e.g. dancing, partying, running, lifting weights, etc). The only category of music that regularly does more for me when I'm not actively listening to it is Ambient, and even then the Ambient music I value most is music that has features that let it stand somewhat on its own.\n\nNot surprisingly, though, this album is more difficult to evaluate than the album's on-paper general attributes might suggest, and this mostly works in the album's favor. Let's step through, chunk by chunk, shall we? The \"big hit single\" part of the album is terrific, especially the opening title track. Yes, I know that it got overplayed through the years, and it's been completely anachronistic since the 90's ended, and that it's become one of 80's pop music's biggest cliches, but have you ever sat down and thought about how much great stuff is in this song? The twisted subject matter (having a party at the end of the world because the world is facing imminent nuclear annhilation) that hides behind the big shiny chorus; the stroke of genius in splitting the verse melody into three separate voices; the fantastic vocal melody, and plenty else to boot (especially the creepy \"Mommy, why does everybody have a bomb\" child spoken interludes at the end). Do yourself a favor; take a couple of years off from listening to this song, then go back to it and listen to it with fresh ears, and if you're anything like me you'll have a blast with it.\n\n\"Little Red Corvette\" and \"Delirious\" are the other major singles from the album, and they further confirm Prince's ability at the time to create music that could both be interesting and popular with a wide audience. Both songs are rife with thinly-veiled sexual metaphors that nonetheless never become distracting, and they're both just well-written songs. \"Corvette\" seems a little more self-consciously anthemic (which is probably why it was such a huge hit), while \"Delirious\" goes for a goofier vibe (what with the combination of the weird synth line and the rockabilly bass), but they both deserve to be considered among Prince's most successful songs of this period. So far, so good.\n\nWhere opinions start to get split in half is in the next three tracks: \"Let's Pretend We're Married,\" \"D.M.S.R.\" and \"Automatic,\" which exceed seven, eight and nine minutes respectively. Could they have each been half their respective lengths and still been decent songs? Probably. Do they set a bad precedent for much of the rest of Prince's career? Possibly. And yet, I can't look upon any of them with significant disdain. Look, if you're going to extend a funk-based track past the point of \"normalcy,\" then I ask basically two things: (1) you make the groove underpinning the song as intense and interesting as possible, and (2) you overlay the groove with as many fun gimmicks as possible (in other words, follow the same rules that Prince himself followed with \"Just As Long As We're Together\"). Each of these three tracks is plenty different from one another given that they're all basically extended dance tracks, and they're each filled with a strong variety of contrasting ideas (monologues, random guitar solos, random call-and-response sections etc). I wouldn't want to listen to any of these tracks in versions that matched in length but came up short in the gimmicks, but as is, I'm pretty strongly hooked, even if it is primarily booty-shaking music.\n\nWhat makes the album take a slight dip in quality, as far as I'm concerned, is in the last five tracks, which are pretty inconsistent. \"Something in the Water (Does Not Compute),\" in its first ten seconds, sounds like it has the potential to be one of the album's best tracks, but it ends up being a confused mess without having the intensity that made \"Annie Christian\" such a success. \"Free\" tries to be a strong anthemic ballad, but aside from one idea that I find mildly nice, I consider it kind of an uninvolving bore. \"Lady Cab Driver\" is a nice callback to the extended jams of earlier in the album (this one featuring a very soft, subtle groove, and a bunch of unsettling sounds in the second half), but the following \"All the Critics Love U in New York\" is a weirdly unsuccessful attempt at creating some kind of proto-rap-crossed-with-hard-rock thing (albeit with some interesting guitar lines here and there). And finally, \"International Lover\" is basically a sequel to/retread of \"Do Me Baby,\" but while it's slightly tiring (and not an especially great way to close the album), it's also kinda hilarious (though I'm not sure how much of that was actually intentional).\n\nSo in the end, the album probably would have been better off as a single LP, but not for the reasons often suggested (needing to cut the lengthy jams in half). There's just too much middling stuff tacked on in the second half for this album to hold up as one of the greatest accomplishments of his career. Still, the album's a heck of a statement, and I like it far more than not. I understand that several Prince fans wrinkle their noses a bit at this one, and while I get their complaints, I would certainly never go so far as to agree with the idea that this is somehow a mediocre album. Don't go looking to this as a career highlight, but certainly get it early on.\n\nSend me your thoughts\n\ntrfesok.aol.com (02/13/12)\n\nMy first Prince purchase (his next one wasn't out yet, and the first two singles got a lot of MTV airplay), and, overall. I wasn't disappointed. The perhaps unnecessary length of a lot of the tracks (particularly \"Automatic\") doesn't bother me as much as it used to. \"International Lover\" is an annoying throwaway, but otherwise, I wouldn't toss anything off. At the time, the way Prince used the combination of Yamaha synths and Linn drum machines was very unusual. Now, however, it sounds a bit dated, and the arrangements don't vary much throughout the album. In comparison with what was to follow, not enough guitar, I have to agree.\n\nStill, a great album. \"Let's Pretend We're Married\" became a favorite after I heard Tina Turner's version, but the original is no slouch (Although was that particular use of the F-word, followed by a multi-tracked gospel rap at the end really necessary?). Still, I also have to go with the title track as top tune, the one case where the entire seven minutes is totally justified.\n\nseventhavenueproductions (seventhavenueproductions.gmail.com)\n\nSomething in your review ...\n\n....does not compute... ;)\n\nI was actually more than very surprised at your thoughts on \"something in the water\" from 1999. Go back, close your eyes, listen to it and think about when he made it, the crazy instrumentation he's using.... yet there it's a fullness and richness to the sound, a rawness to the lyrics, and really a great crescendo into powerful vocals. We all have our opinions I know, but from reading all the other songs you have reviewed of his up to this point, it makes me wonder if you had just gotten bored getting through dmsr and Automatic.\n\nnickrj81.gmail.com (05/13/16)\n\nWarner bros should've released a single LP of the album around September 1983\n\nHere's the track listing\n\nSide one\n\n1. 1999 (single version 3:37)\n\n2.

What makes it great is the very thing Prince himself hated about music later in his career. The LM-1 Linn drum machine with its unique tuning and the oberheim 8 voice. Prince did things with that were mind blowing with these instruments. He would later take a stance of real bands playing real music and using less tech. Thus, in my opinion, the decline of his career. He approached music from a funk perspective. As a product of the P-Funk generation, it was refreshing to hear his interpretation of funk. Something in the water was like an alien language for me and my friends growing up listening to it. It showed future R&B artist what was possible. A-U-T-0 matic and Lady cab drive are lessons in creativity and instrumentation. At the time of the release, these tracks sounded futuristic and bold. I understand I am rating the album through nostalgic lenses but I am so disappointed when people say Purple Rain was his best. When doves cry was his best song, but as a whole project, 1999 is superior in my opinion. Then again, Prince introduced me to rock and the guitar as a lead instrument. Long live Purple funk.\n\nEdward J Gorski (egorski13.mail.bw.edu) (04/13/17)\n\nI would make the argument that the first album of 1999 might be the second or third best collective disc Prince ever recorded (behind Purple Rain and possibly Album 2 of Sign O' The Times). Side one is nothing short of pure pop brilliance, and side two features some of Prince's best extended jam songs. I have a hard time picking my favorite here, but it tends to go back and forth between Little Red Corvette and Let's Pretend We're Married. I tend to agree that the second album isn't nearly as satisfying as the first, but I'd actually pick two tracks you criticize, Something in the Water (Does Not Compute) and All the Critics Love U In New York, as the stronger tracks. All of this said, 1999 is certainly an excellent listen, and easily a top 5 Prince album.\n\n*Purple Rain - 1984 Warner Bros.*\n\nD\n\n(Great / Very Good)\n\nBest song: Let's Go Crazy (followed closely by Baby I'm A Star)\n\nPrince's career, especially in the mid-80's onwards, tends to make more sense if you imagine Prince less as an adult and more as an insanely talented, mildly autistic child.\n\nDISCLAIMER: I'm not saying that Prince is autistic. Please don't sue me, Prince and Prince's army of lawyers.\n\nWhat this album had that so many others of his didn't (and which ultimately gave the key to making this so great) was a clearly-defined goal: to make him into one of the absolute biggest musical sensations (though not acting sensations, sadly) in the entire world (even moreso than did 1999, which definitely veered off the path near the end). This largely meant that Prince had to push aside ideas that would only especially interest him and instead channel his talents towards songs like the hit singles from 1999, except better. With a set-in-stone goal in place, Prince was able to churn out an album of filler-free, hook-overflowing material that still bore Prince's unmistakable imprint, and the result is my favorite album of his career (not an especially creative choice, I know, but I can't help that I really like it). A couple of the tracks might be a little more slight than the others, but for once there's not a single track that stands out as a clear weak link. Of course, the album is unmistakably from 1984, and since I don't instinctually gravitate towards music that obviously comes from this period, I have enough reservations about it that I can't quite name it as one of my all-time favorites. Still, I can only wish for a world in which more famous albums from 1984 were as bursting with great songs and great ideas as can be found on this album.\n\nIt definitely helps that the opener is my long-time favorite Prince song. \"Let's Go Crazy\" is simply one of the funnest songs to listen to (and sing along with) that I know. Starting from the ridiculous spoken introduction (\"Dearly beloved, we are gathered here today to get through this thing called life\") with the cheap organ-y synth underpinning it (I love, LOVE to do a little air-playing at the \"There's something else\" *pause* \"The afterworld\" *upward arpeggio* part) and heading through the main part of the song, this track is a giant pile of hooks with a fantastic groove filled with insanely tight playing. This song shows right away that The Revolution is now a living, breathing force of nature, as opposed to a few vocalists over drum machines, and in this song and the rest of the album, it sounds like one of the greatest bands that could possibly exist (too bad that only lasts through this album, though). The interaction between the guitars and synths is just fantastic, culminating in in a joyous wanky guitar-solo leading into a slow finish that culminates in a massive \"TAKE ME AWAY\" at the end. It's the ultimate Prince song, I tell you.\n\nThe rest of the album is terrific, too. \"Take Me With U\" is one of the album's two major pieces of sexy, exotic psychedelia (the other is \"When Doves Cry,\" mentioned later), and everything about it (especially the well-written string parts) is top-notch. The parts where Prince duets with Appolonia (especially in the verse culminating with \"All I want is to spend the night in your arms\") are as moving emotionally as anything Prince had done to this point, and the exchange of \"You're sheer perfection\"/\"Thank you\" has got to be one of the smoothest things I've ever heard.\n\n\"The Beautiful Ones\" is a track that, on paper, has the potential to be a weak link. Except for some subtle guitar work in the second half, the song is basically just Prince singing a slow ballad over a bunch of synthesizer bleeps and bloops for five minutes. Well, songs aren't played on paper. Prince's singing on this song is almost undoubtedly the most emotionally charged I've ever heard from him: the falsetto singing in the line \"The beautiful ones ... you always seem to lose\" is gorgeous, and the way he sings everything starting from \"Do you want him? Or do you want me? 'Cos I want you!\" onward ... wow. He does some horrible, ugly, self-destructive things to his voice in this song, but it's all in the name of sheer emotional power, and that means it's for a good cause. We're a long, LONG way from \"When We're Dancing Close and Slow.\"\n\n\"Computer Blue\" starts off sounding a little fillerish (aside from the bizarre spoken intro from Wendy and Lisa), like a Controversy outtake, but the jam in the second half is pretty great (and features a fantastic lengthy guitar solo), so it's definitely a keeper. \"Darling Nikki,\" the album's most controversial track (and little wonder with these lyrics) and the one that made it a lightning rod for Tipper Gore and others, is a little distracting lyrically, but gosh that's one hardcore dose of funk underpinning it. I'm not sure about the backwards voices at the end, but I tend to forget about those quickly anyway.\n\n\"When Doves Cry,\" of course, is most famous for completely lacking bass, thus becoming a completely undancable song that still has one heck of a sexy, exotic feel to it. It's a song packed with elements that make little sense together, especially the guitar (and weird vocal sounds) in the beginning and the lengthy synth solos in the second half, but somehow these things combine with the drums, the plinky synths and the vocals to create an unforgettable experience (that the guitar solo in the second half is one of the best on the album certainly doesn't hurt either). Could anybody else in the history of pop music have made a song like this, and more importantly made it work?\n\nIt's tempting to consider \"I Would Die For U\" fillerish, but the only real justification for doing this is the length, which comes in at a relatively paltry 2:49. It's a little excessively repetitive with the chorus and its underlying chord sequence, but the chorus and that chord sequence are both awesome, so that's forgivable. The mid-song synth-break irritates me a little, but this is more than made up for by the vocals and vocal melody, especially in the lengthy \"verses,\" and by the quiet (and surprisingly moving) synth plinkings in the last thirty seconds. And besides, the song is really just a lengthy first-half to \"Baby I'm a Star,\" which is nothing less than four minutes of sheer awesomeness. I'll put it this way: if every Prince song was as great as \"Let's Go Crazy\" and \"Baby I'm a Star,\" Prince would probably be one of my five favorite musicians of all time. The keyboard melody about as good as it gets, and the combination of the exuberant up-tempo drums and Prince's excited vocals (singing lyrics that are absolutely perfect for the music that's going on) was enough to win me over from the very first listen.\n\nAnd the closing title track, well, it's freaking \"Purple Rain!!!\" It's just a big, dramatic, bombastic ballad with a perfect set of chord sequences for making a big, dramatic, bombastic ballad seem great and not stupid. Oh, and with one of the best epic guitar solos of Prince's career, of the 80's and maybe of all time. It's eight minutes of slow, heavenly bliss, marking Prince's momentary ascension to the absolute elite of pop music. Put this song in the hands of most anybody else and you get a generic piece of prom-filth, but somehow it feels completely right with Prince.\n\nI can understand somebody not enjoying this album, but I cannot comprehend somebody today not enjoying this album but still considering themselves a Prince fan. Yes, it exposed him to a wide audience, so it could have been dismissed at the time by \"real\" fans as a bandwagon pick, but today, decades after release, it stands up so well that it's almost mindboggling. And, of course, it goes without saying that anybody who likes 80's pop music but doesn't own this is seriously missing out.\n\nSend me your thoughts\n\n\"matt faris\" (7headedchicken.gmail.com) (01/13/11)\n\nYeah, good review. I had the same phenomenon of feeling weird about calling this my favorite Prince album for the reason of it being such an obvious choice. It was the first Prince album I bought, and afterwards, whenever I would pick another one, I would always hope to like it more than *Purple Rain*. But this is still my favorite. And that's not a statement of detriment to his other albums, but a compliment to this one. This is just one really, really great album. Of course, it helps that it contains two of my favorite Prince songs, \"Take Me With U\" and \"I Would Die For U.\" I love how the arrangements on this album are so flowery, kind of like, well, the flowers on the cover. His guitar playing is also top-notch - not that he hasn't brought new elements to his playing since, but there is just something about these solos. It's funny, what you said about the solo at the end of \"When Doves Cry\" is exactly what I would say about the one at the end of \"Let's Go Crazy.\" Another great part is, well, both of the parts of \"The Beautiful Ones\" that you cited. Again, it feels strange that an album this popular would so well define the career of an artist so diverse and prolific, but this one just does. As often cited by many, the range of styles is another great strength. Gotta admit the title track is a beautiful, timeless ballad. And I always thought it was novel for a musician to put a backwards Christian message in one of their songs. (That'd be those voices in \"Darling Niki\" you said you weren't sure about.) At first, the lyrics to \"Baby, I'm a Star\" always made the giant squid that lives in my stomach contort into weird shapes, but that's probably because I never really liked the whole \"star\" concept. This is NOT the same thing as the idea of artists making a living making art. No, I'm talking about the whole \"I'm a star, worship me\" ideology that has plagued commercial music for so many decades. It's just an opinion of mine, but I think we should be worshipping God, and appriciating music as something God has made through his vessels. That said, the song has grown on me over time, as it is some prime funk (almost as good as \"America\" from the next album), and going by the music that Prince has progressed through since this album, I'm guessing that he has largely moved away from the idea, with the exception of a few songs here and there, and I can understand the appeal at the same time, as well as the temptation to go back to it. Seeing as how that's only a fraction of a complaint, I would still give *Purlple Rain* a 10(15), on your scale, that is. On the squid's scale, it gets 6 out of 6 tentacles.\n\ntrfesok.aol.com (03/13/11)\n\nWell, it's not my favorite, but I certainly like it a lot. The songs are more focused than on the last album, to be sure. There's a better balance between guitars, synths and percussion, plus some great string arrangements. The lyrics tend to be a little less clear in places (what exactly is \"purple rain\" supposed to be?), but that doesn't mar things too much. The weak link for me, though, is the obnoxious \"Darling Nikki\", which lyrics which come off as ridiculous rather than sexy, but without the humor of \"International Lover.\" Still, the album is loaded with classics: \"Let's Go Crazy\", \"When Doves Cry\" \"Take Me With You/Baby I'm a Star\" (supposedly a killer medley live) and the title track. Still, it's not quite as interesting to me as what was to come.\n\nEdward J Gorski (egorski13.mail.bw.edu) (08/13/17)\n\nYou pretty much hit the nail on the head all across the board with this one. This is almost certainly Prince at his absolute best, and pretty much every song fires on all cylinders. I'd actually probably give this album an E or F, but that's my opinion. I agree with your best track pick, since Let's Go Crazy is probably my favorite Prince song too, but damn it if Purple Rain and The Beautiful Ones don't emotionally gut me every time I hear them. Prince's emotionally wrought vocals on the latter are easily some of his best, and that guitar solo in the former is enough to give chills.\n\nAround The World In A Day - 1985 Paisley Park\n\n7\n\n(Mediocre / Good)\n\nBest song: Raspberry Beret\n\nRegardless of all the little jabs and pokes in the reviews so far, I actually think Prince's career through Purple Rain makes a lot of sense. A promising but inconsistent debut, followed by a confused second album, followed by a series of albums that show continuous development, culminating in a massive commercial and critical powerhouse, is a career arc that plenty of artists could have (and have) followed. After hitting such heights with Purple Rain, it was unlikely (and in fact nearly impossible) that he would be able to top it in the near future, but it seemed reasonable to think that he would settle into a nice career plateau of solid albums ...\n\n... so what on earth is this?? In trying to come up with an explanation for the circumstances surrounding this album, the best I can do is to think about how a lot of actors, once they've won a major award or two, get a little self-indulgent and decide to go off and do the work that they've \"always wanted\" to do. Well, Prince was coming off a year in which he won both a Grammy and an Academy Award (for best original song, thanks to \"Purple Rain\"), and he now had his own recording label (nominally, anyway). Prince had been gift-wrapped a situation that would allow his latent eccentricities to run wild, and it shouldn't be too surprising that things turned out how they did, on this album and in the future.\n\nBut still, I wouldn't have expected things to happen like this. It's one thing not to issue any advance singles, but why basically avoid doing any advance promotion for it? Just to prove that you can make a #1 album without a marketing department? And why go for a sound like this? The bulk of the album is geared towards an 80's update of 60's music, but while the leanings in this direction on Purple Rain were a success, here they're much less so. A good chunk of this album sounds like Prince going for something along the lines of \"When Doves Cry,\" but failing. It doesn't help that Prince's supporting band now kinda sounds like it's getting in the way of both Prince and itself; I see the word \"claustrophobic\" used all over the internet in describing the sound they produce here, and it's an apt description if I ever saw one. There are sure not many significant doses of excitement or energy jumping out of the album like there were last time.\n\nAdmittedly (and not surprisingly), there are good songs to be found here. \"Raspberry Beret\" is a great upbeat psych-pop song with an unforgettable chorus, and \"Pop Life\" is a great piece of quietly intense pop-funk. \"America\" is the best dose of driving rock energy on the album; apparently there's a 20-minute version of the song that stretches out the jam that unfortunately fades out way way too soon here. And ... uh ... I guess \"The Ladder,\" as ridiculous and overblown as it is, is still a nice tribute to gospel music of yore.\n\nThat's only four songs, though. \"Paisley Park\" is a decent poor-man's \"When Doves Cry\" (come on, I can't be the only one who hears the resemblence, can I?), while the title track is weaker than even that level of \"praise\" but still basically acceptable. \"Condition of the Heart\" makes the mistake of combining a huge opening with a mediocre ballad that brings little catharsis; split the two parts up, you might have something, but as is I'm not impressed. And \"Tamborine\" mostly just goes in one ear and out the other.\n\nThat leaves the album's closer, the worst track on the album and an ill harbinger of woe to come. \"Temptation\" has some nice guitar and horn work in the first half, and had the track shut down after five or six minutes, it wouldn't be perfect (it still feels kinda sluggish and confused), but it would still be pretty nice. But then he ruins the track by engaging in one of the most ridiculous dialogues I've ever heard in a musical setting. Has a deep, slowed-down voice, used in a non-ironic, earnest way (not like at the beginning of \"1999,\" I mean), ever worked at all? Did Prince really think the listener had to be explicitly told what kind of temptation he was talking about? Did he think that anybody in the whole world except for him would care about this little tacked-on morality play of his? The thought of ever listening to this track again is enough to raise my blood pressure 15 points.\n\nLook, I can see where a Prince fan would like this album. It's an interesting change of pace, there are some good songs, and it has many of the markings of \"underappreciated great album.\" Unfortunately, I just can't buy into this line of thinking; variety is good, but clumsiness isn't, and this is one awfully clumsy album. Make sure you get the hits in some form, but don't rush out for the rest.\n\nSend me your thoughts\n\ntrfesok.aol.com (03/13/11)\n\nI'm probably in a minority of one on this one, but this is my favorite Prince album. I just really think that the merge of Beatles influenced psychedelia with Prince's own musical styles is brilliant. Despite Prince's denials, the title track, \"Paisley Park\" and \"Raspberry Beret\" clearly show the marks of the Beatles' 1967 releases. (If you have any doubts, check out the album cover or the video of \"Raspberry Beret\"). \"America\" is a big nod to Hendrix (I'd really like to hear that 22 minute version). The rest of the album isn't as obvious, but still pretty cool space-out music. \"Condition of the Heart\" isn't as straightforward as something like \"Do Me, Baby\" or \"International Lover\", but because of that, it's more intriguing. \"Tambourine\" is a fun little jam --- did you notice that all the percussion on that track does NOT include a tambourine? I missed your observation that \"The Ladder\" is a psychedelia/gospel hybrid, but that actually makes me like the song more. Of all the songs, only \"Pop Life\" would have been in place on the last album, but it's OK.\n\nOf course, I have to agree that the album is badly marred by the overlong, totally obnoxious \"Temptation\". I remember that I was sitting in the living room with my roommate's girlfriend the first time I played it, and we were both profoundly embarrassed. This wasn't the first or the last time that Prince tried to have it both ways in terms of spirituality and sexuality. However, it's handled in such a klutzy, obvious and egotistical way that the track is totally unlistenable. I always skip it when I play the album.\n\nI like the cover painting, too. So, if you can overlook that hideous album closer, you've got one very fine, unique album from Prince. Although he would do some more songs in this vein, I don't think he ever put so many in a cohesive whole again.\n\nRichard Chaplin (maccafru2003.aol.com) (03/13/13)\n\nI cartainly wouldn't argue with your overall verdict on this one. For me only \"Raspberry Beret\" and \"Pop Life\" come close to being top drawer Prince songs. The rest is just mediocre (or worse) fare. If I'm in the mood I can really enjoy 'Paisley Park\" and I think the title track is a fun little tune. There may be a decent song buried somewhere in \"Condition Of The Heart\" but the production doesn't do it any justice at all. \"America\" bores me to be honest - too generic sounding for my taste. \"Tambourine\" is just....well...it's just not memorable at all is it? \"The Ladder\" is an OK pop/gospel and \"Temptation\" is utter garbage which I always skip. I believe that this album was recorded in the down periods while Prince was in the midst of his huge Purple Rain tour and I think it shows. It's all a bit confused, unfocused and, as you say, clumsy sounding.\n\nParade - 1986 Paisley Park\n\n6\n\n(Mediocre)\n\nBest song: Kiss\n\nThis album is a mess. Like Purple Rain, this is the soundtrack to a film (Under the Cherry Moon) starring Prince that I'll probably never watch, but don't go into this expecting something even remotely similar (in style or quality) to that one. Prince has taken his core sound and filtered it strongly through some sort of 60's-ish lounge jazz, making this almost sound like his own version of The Soft Parade, but without anything near the consistently high quality that made that album so enjoyable. The first three quarters of this album barely sounds like finished songs to me, except in two tracks (\"Life Can be So Nice,\" \"Mountains\"); in the rest of that stretch, I feel like I'm listening to in-progress versions instead of fully fleshed-out material. These tracks feel rushed, like Prince recorded the tracks as soon as he had come up with the ideas for them, and didn't bother to clean them up or figure out how to make effective use of his bandmates. Not all of the ideas in these tracks are bad (I like the main vocal hook in \"Christopher Tracy's Parade\" quite a bit), but I'd have preferred to hear them better used.\n\nIt's a good thing the last three tracks actually sound like real Prince songs. My wife has long hated \"Kiss\" (it's one of the only Prince songs she really knows, courtesy of its inclusion in Pretty Woman), but I find it a total blast. It's just a solid old-fashioned funk-rocker, with a great guitar-based groove, hilarious falsetto vocals and a fantastic chorus, and one that, aside from the drum machines, doesn't date to the mid-80's at all. Just slightly behind it, though, is the piano-dominated dance-pop single, \"Anotherloverholenyohead.\" It doesn't break ground for Prince much at all, but if breaking ground at this point meant tracks like on the first half of the album, I'd take this kind of conservativism any day.\n\nThe closing \"Sometimes it Snows in April\" somewhat annoyed me the first couple of times I heard it, but I've come around to it pretty well. My initial assessment was that it was closer to \"Condition of the Heart\" than \"Purple Rain,\" and seemed a little too overdone and nowhere near as moving or as poigniant as it seemed to think it was. I still think these things to an extent, but at the same time I don't think the song does anything that makes it especially tacky, and that goes a long way with me. The stripped-down acoustic arrangement is a nice change of pace from the rest of the album, and for once on this album the rawness and lack of polish (the song was done in one take without cleanups) gives an emotional kick. I'd never consider this a moment of serious beauty (the melody was written by Wendy and Lisa, not Prince, and as such it's not especially brilliant), but it's a decent enough song.\n\nStill, a few nice songs is nowhere near enough to save this album. It's apparently regarded pretty highly among serious Prince fans, but I guess that means that this is an album that separates the \"real\" fans from the frontrunners like me. Oh well.\n\nSend me your thoughts\n\nSign O' The Times - 1987 Paisley Park\n\nD\n\n(Great / Very Good)\n\nBest song: Sign O' The Times, I Could Never Take The Place Of Your Man or The Cross\n\nLike Controversy, this is more of a really high C than a solid D, but the high points are great enough to take away any hesitation I have in rounding up. Frankly, I find it remarkable that this is even a decent album, let alone one of Prince's best and one of the best albums of the late 80's. Between The Revolution collapsing around him (the bulk of the album features Prince returning to his one-man-band roots), the overall mediocrity of the last two albums, and the fact that the album was assembled from the leftovers of a proposed 3-CD album (which Warner Bros. torpedoed) and another failed project (\"Camille,\" featuring Prince taking on the guise of a female), this should have been, at the least, a mild disaster. Commercially, it was hardly a success (selling about the same as Parade), but critics largely loved it, and it almost singlehandedly bought Prince another ten years of critical goodwill. It's certainly not immaculate, but it's messy in the way lots of great double albums are messy, and the best stuff is amazing.\n\nIf there's a serious weak area in the album, it's in the second half of the first disc. Ok, \"Starfish and Coffee\" is a terrific pop song, unlike anything Prince had done before, with weirdly evocative lyrics that help make the song seem close to the coolest thing ever. \"Slow Love\" is also a strong point, showing that Prince could write a perfectly \"authentic\" old-fashioned soul ballad; it's a long way from original, but it's still fun to see that Prince had developed the ability to return to his influences and interpret them with some flair. The other three tracks, though, are pretty weak. \"Hot Thing\" has a mildly interesting keyboard riff, but it's not enough to carry a song for almost six minutes, and neither \"It\" (rather monotonous) nor \"Forever in My Life\" (not a single strong hook or interesting aspect in 3:30) do enough to escape the dreaded \"filler\" tag.\n\nThe first half of the first disc is considerably better, even if on first listen it's tempting to tag it as the title track and some filler. The title track, of course, is Prince's great big political/social statement, touching on drug use, AIDS, various disasters (hurricanes, the Challenger explosion), nuclear weapons and more. The lyrics are pretty amazing here; they manage to touch on all of these various hot-button issues while still sounding enigmatic and veiled, and they definitely make the song as good of a candidate as any to have functioned as The Big Anthem of the late 80's. Music-wise, it's stripped down more than anything since Dirty Mind, only going further than the material from that album in that the keyboard touches are very light. Just a few relatively simple drum machine patterns, a popping bassline and some sparse bluesy guitar lines, combined with a nice vocal melody, are all that are needed to make in this into a classic.\n\nThe other songs on this disc are fine, too. \"Play in the Sunshine\" could have come from Controversy and I wouldn't have known the difference, aside from the main rhythm obviously coming from a drum machine rather than Prince's own drumming. It's just a solid up-tempo pop song, full of fun vocal hooks and energy that strangely seemed missing on much of the last couple of albums. \"Housequake\" sounds, at first, like a somewhat dolt-ish funk song that Prince could have come up with in ten minutes, but while that might not be terribly far from the truth, it's grown on me considerably over the years. I think the main key is bothering to have a prominent trumpet part, making the song just feel like a solid update on the traditional soul/funk rave-up or whatever. Whatever the case, it's neat to have a fun song like this, built around the simple phrase, \"Shut up already. Damn!\"\n\n\"Ballad of Dorothy Parker\" is another track that somewhat passed me by the first few times, but I've come to like this one quite a bit as well. It's quiet and low-key without having any clear direction or strong hooks, but the lyrics are sufficiently intriguing, and the song has atmosphere to spare. Plus, the song may be low-key, but it manages to have a deep funk element to it that largely reminds me of similar things from There's a Riot Going On, and as with most everything on that Sly and the Family Stone album, the song takes hold strongly once it takes hold.\n\nThe first disc, overall, strikes me as quite good, but not quite fantastic: it would be a high 9 or low A, a solidly decent album. The second disc, though, is mind-bogglingly stupendous, and enough to drag the album up to its present overall grade. If there's any flaw to it, it would be in the closing \"Adore,\" which is yet another somewhat overlong (6:30) ballad to close out one of Prince's albums, but that's a minor flaw at worst. Prince has done better slow ballads, but he's definitely done worse, and there isn't any serious amount of cheese to drag it down a lot. The first six songs of the disc, then, are easily the best six-song stretch Prince has ever done. \"U Got the Look\" (with a guest vocal from Sheena Easton) was one of the album's major hit singles, and this is a time when I can definitely say the public got it right. It's full of big dumb hooks, set to a big dumb dance beat, full of ridiculous lyrics (with references to \"The World Series of Love\" and a chorus that includes the amazing lines: \"Your face is jammin'/Your body's heck-a-slammin'/If love is good, let's get to rammin'.\" If that's not poetry, I don't know what is), and it's easily one of the very best big dumb dance songs I've heard from the 80's or ever. On paper, I shouldn't be big on it at all, but I love it, and I came oh so close to making it a 4th choice for best song on the album.\n\nOf course, the next track serves as an instant reminder that Prince isn't just a great writer of hits; he's also borderline nuts. \"If I Was Your Girlfriend\" is a leftover from the \"Camille\" project, and it's as disturbing as a blatant gender-bending track sung by Prince can be. In addition to being disturbing, though, it's also surprisingly memorable and even moving, showing insight into the idea that a man, in the role of a boyfriend, can often not be as close to his girlfriend in various ways as her various close female friends can be. The lengthy ending monologue is somewhat horrifying, of course, but it manages to be funny, and if anything it makes the song even better.\n\nThe next two tracks originated in 1982, and they sound every bit as great as most material from Prince at that time sounded. \"Strange Relationship\" gets somewhat overshadowed by all of the greatness surrounding it, but make no mistake; were it on the first disc (not to mention on the last two albums), it would have stood out strongly. It's a relatively conventional mid-tempo dance-pop song, but the hooks are strong and the lyrics are interesting, and they make for an interesting number. Yet for all of this song's charms, it pales to the utter greatness that is \"I Could Never Take the Place of Your Man.\" The track is a roughly 4-minute pop song followed by a 2-minute coda, and both portions are amazing. The main song portion is one of the catchiest things Prince ever wrote, combining yet another great simple keyboard line with yet another set of perfect vocal hooks, all while singing the most infectious lyrics possible about a topic as sad as a man turning down a woman desperately looking to fill a recent void in her life. It's a nearly perfect pop song, and yet the song portion is almost overtaken by the coda, a blues-funk workout that goes from the up-tempo bliss of the main song into something incredibly moody and expressive. In the world of tracks that start as one song and finish as a completely different instrumental, this track absolutely belongs up there with \"Can't You Hear Me Knocking,\" \"Layla,\" \"Freebird\" and whatever other songs that can be thought of along these lines.\n\nAnd yet, for all this praise, I definitely like \"The Cross\" just as much. Prince doing a Gospel song? Prince doing a Gospel song with political overtones?? Prince doing a Gospel song, with political overtones, that has a heavy Eastern tinge to it??! Prince doing a Gospel song, with political overtones, with a heavy Eastern tinge to it, with heavy metallic elements??!! Somebody pinch me!\n\nFinally, the album's penultimate track is \"It's Gonna be a Beautiful Night,\" a 9-minute funk rave-up recorded live by The Revolution in 1986. You might know it as the funk piece Prince did that was based around the \"oh-wee-oh\" vocal chant from The Wizard of Oz, and it's possible you might want to dismiss the track as a silly gimmick. Well, as mentioned before, I like my lengthy Prince funk jams piled high with gimmicks, and this track has plenty of them. There are great horn lines, and fun falsetto vocal parts, and call-and-response sections between people on stage, and Prince generally directing the action with reckless aplomb and showing that he could work an audience as well as anybody could. There's even a somewhat indecipherable, fast-paced rap near the end, which, uh, appears to be some sort of parable of some sort. Whatever, it's just another great element in one of the greatest doses of fun on any Prince album.\n\nNow, of course, let's not get carried away; this album is too inconsistent in the first half to claim quite the pedestal that people want to put it on. There might be a better single-album's worth of material on here than on Controversy or Purple Rain, but there's more dead-weight than on those albums, too, and it's hard for me to think of this album leapfrogging either of those in my mind. And yet, the album is still really terrific on the whole, and it's definitely one of Prince's career highlights.\n\nPS: For all of the praise I heap on this album, like so many others do, I want to offer a caveat. Because so many critics love this album, this often ends up becoming an initial entry point to Prince's career. As great as this album is, it is clearly one for those who have already familiarized themselves with Prince enough to have a good feel for all of his various quirks and eccentricities. This is not an album for the uninitiated, and from traveling around the internet I know there are more than a few people who bought this and gave up on Prince because it was too hard of a nut to crack. So in short, it's a classic, but if you don't know any Prince, maybe you should start with Dirty Mind or Purple Rain first.\n\nSend me your thoughts\n\ntrfesok.aol.com (04/13/12)\n\nYes, Prince manages to create his one man White Album. Considering the convoluted history behind it's making, it's amazing that the song quality is so high, even if the album totally lacks the sonic consistency of 1999.\n\nPrince almost totally abandons the psychedelia of Around the World.., which is a bit unfortunate (the album is far more stripped down and raw, although not to the level of \"Kiss\", fortunately). \"Starfish and Coffee\" and \"Play in the Sunshine\" are still in that vein and are a lot of fun, more energetic than the Around.. tracks. Prince had never done anything quite like the title track -- pretty unique and a total standout, I have to agree with you (but what's with the goofy ending, where he talks about naming his baby Nate?). Ditto for \"The Cross\", which I might pick as my favorite, too. I don't agree that \"I Could Never Take the Place of Your Man\" ranks up with those two songs, but the guitar work at the end is great, the best since \"America.\"\n\nPrince's sexual obsessions get pretty silly (titling as song \"It\"?!!), but that track, \"Hot Thing\" and the hilarious \"U Got the Look\" are a lot of fun, anyway. I do think that you underrate \"Housequake\", another cool jam that's an obvious tribute to James Brown. Brown would have never used that \"Camille\" voice, though. \"It's Going to be a Beautiful Night\", on the other hand, is a little long, but it's got a great hook, and it does work better live than it might have as a studio track.\n\nThe album, for me, falls down on some of the ballads. \"The Ballad of Dorothy Parker\" and \"Strange Relationship\" both have unusual lyrics and sounds that hold the listener's attention. However, \"Adore\" and \"Slow Love\" (which should have been titled \"Too Slow Love\") drag on endlessly, but at least Prince isn't bragging about his bedroom prowess in these. As for \"If I Was Your Girlfriend\", it shouldn't have even made the album, never mind put out as a single! Too long and dirgelike, an especially annoying use of the \"Camille\" voice, and he should have figured that it made have been taken for a gay anthem, resulting in a homophobic lack of airplay. Not that I have a problem with gay anthems, just bad ones.\n\nStill, as with any White Album, there's always an argument about what should and should not have been included. Far more pluses than minuses here, so we've got another classic. For me, this marks the end of Prince's classic period.\n\nSteven Michael (stevenieves01.gmail.com) (07/13/18)\n\nI can almost always tell when a music critic is Caucasian or not.\n\nAnd when I read terrible reviews of great R&B/Funk songs like \"Adore\" & \"If I Was Your Girlfriend\", I pretty much know they were written by Caucasian music critics.\n\n\"If I Was Your Girlfriend\" and especially \"Adore\" were the main reasons why I purchased Prince's \"Sign Of The Times\" double LP & cassette. Both of those songs are brilliant ballads & Not your regular everyday ordinary R&B songs. Prince's R&B ballads are always standouts & always a bit different & beautiful.\n\nIt pains me to say this but I've come to notice & recognize when music critics are Caucasian or not. And that's usually when those music critics can't ever seem to appreciate R&B, Funk or Dance music greatness.\n\nObviously, I'm not saying ALL Caucasian music critics can't appreciate good/great R&B(i.e, Black music) music but alot of them just don't, can't or just don't want to.\n\nThe Black Album - 1987/1994 Warner Bros.\n\n4\n\n(Bad / Mediocre)\n\nBest song: When 2 R In Love\n\nAs with Sign of the Times (and, come to think of it, pretty much every Prince album from here to the end of the millenium), The Black Album has a lengthy story associated with its eventual release. Apparently, a number of critics and fans had decided Prince had become insufficiently black in his last few albums (frankly, somebody rejecting Sign O' the Times on the grounds of it not being black enough seems about as stupid as somebody rejecting London Calling for not being punk enough, though I guess that happened too), and this supposedly prompted Prince to make a concerted effort to return to his funk roots and make his music \"blacker\" (a trait reflected in the album cover and title as well). A few weeks before the album's 1987 release, Prince had a change of heart (the reasons for which have become a source of legend over the years) concerning the music contained within, and all but a small handful of promotional copies were pulled from the marketplace. Well, these promotional copies soon morphed into bootleg copies, and over the next few years the album became a collector's item, promoted by the few people who'd heard it as Prince's own Smile or Basement Tapes. Skipping ahead 7 years, Prince found himself trying to issue new albums as fast as he could manage, and with this material lying around, it was only inevitable that this finally earned a proper release.\n\nHere's the thing: if this album was really Prince's attempt to immerse himself in contemporary black music, it's hard for me not to think that Prince didn't have a very high opinion in 1987 of contemporary black music. According to various accounts, one of the things that Prince disliked about this album the most was the tone of the lyrics towards sex and women; it treats both subjects in a very base and vulgar way, far from the pedestal that Prince usually put them on (Prince might usually be overly obsessed with sex, but it's clear that he treats it as a spiritual experience more than anything, and he clearly values women as something more than just objects of carnal desire). This is indeed a problem with the album; Prince is clearly not comfortable in taking this lyrical approach, and whereas all other Prince albums to this point had at least some goofy levity to them, this one is mostly just really uncomfortable (even the part in \"Cindy C.\" where he's pleading to know why Cindy Crawford doesn't like him, sounds less like an overly smitten fan and more like a psychotic stalker). My favorite song on here, not coincidentally, is the one that sounds the least like Prince trying to sound like somebody else; \"When 2 R in Love\" isn't a spectacular ballad, but it's a good one, full of light touches and without any attempt to sound tougher than needed.\n\nThe lyrics, though, are not the biggest problem here. The overemphasis on getting back to Prince's funk roots leads him to make the songs overly dependent on relatively mundane (but, I guess, \"authentically\" funk) beats without bothering to put a sufficient amount of variation in the songs. The songs aren't exactly interchangable, of course, but there are none of the huge left turns in style or mood that had allowed Prince to make so many interesting albums in the previous decade. The one time he tries to engage in a lengthy funk jam (\"2 Nigs United 4 West Compton,\" one of the worst song titles of all time), the results are sadly stiff, as if he was afraid to do anything interesting in it for fear of eliminating his cred. Aside from \"Rock Hard in a Funky Place,\" a somewhat decent song with old-school horns and decent guitar work (it would have made for a nice filler track on Sign O' the Times, which is kind of a compliment, I guess), the other songs are barely worth discussing.\n\nI don't know, honestly, if my reasons for disliking this album line up with the reasons Prince disliked it enough to pull it (and to do things like flash messages in his videos telling people not to buy this). I do know that many people who enjoy Prince enjoy for him for different reasons than I do, and the types of things they look for in Prince's music could, conceivably, lead them to enjoy this album a lot. As is, I just can't pretend that I like more than a couple of songs on here at all. Since this album is no longer in print (it got pulled again after its 1994 release), I can't even recommend trying to seek it out cheap.\n\nSend me your thoughts\n\nLovesexy - 1988 Paisley Park\n\n8\n\n(Good / Mediocre)\n\nBest song: Technically, it's all one track\n\nIn a review I wrote some years before this one, I claimed that this was the worst album cover ever, but as much as that one still makes me throw up in my mouth, it's still not as bad as this one. It really amazes me that the powers that be at Warner Bros. were unable to anticipate that maybe, just maybe, potential purchasers of this album would be mortified at the idea of going to a music store where the clerk might recognize them, and attempting to purchase an album featuring a bare-naked 5'2\" Prince on the cover. Not surprisingly, many stores refused to carry the album, and the album didn't put up great sales numbers.\n\nAnyway, after the sudden withdrawl of The Black Album from stores, Prince had to knock out a replacement album as quickly as possible, and as such this album was created in less than two months. Remarkably, it's actually pretty nice; it sounds like Sign O' the Times-lite, with a little more late 80's reverb, and while that's not a great accomplishment, it still makes for something way more enjoyable than The Black Album. For better or worse, the general vibe is much closer to typical Prince than TBA was; it's back to the idea of love and sex as spiritual concepts, except meant to sound a little more cultish than what he had done before. Whatever, this \"concept\" only pops up in a few scattered spots of the album, and it's not too distracting.\n\nSong-wise, this is a very uniform album. The playful funk of \"Alphabet St.\" and the interesting pop numbers \"Glam Slam\" (somewhat dance-ier than much of the rest of the album) and \"Anna Stesia\" (more downbeat and confessional than much of the rest of the album) seem like they're somewhat better than other stuff here, but that may be because they come early. There isn't a really a bad track on the album; there just aren't very many great ones, either. Plus, there are some typically ridiculous stretches that make me raise a perplexed eyebrow, like the weird pitch-manipulated monologue that Prince breaks into during the title track.\n\nStill, the perplexing moments aren't enough to make me think ill of the album. I've waffled back and forth on the exact grade to give this; after some listens, I found myself convinced this was almost an A-level album, because it's so lacking in obvious low points and because it has some obvious (minor) highlights. And yet, there's a serious Prince-by-numbers feel to the album that weighs it down, and really, how it could it not have been Prince-by-numbers given the circumstances? Plus, it's a little ridiculous for a track like \"Positivity\" to last more than seven minutes when it could have easily stopped after four. So overall, it's a solid 8; it's a good album where I'll probably listen to all of the individual songs again (especially since I split up the album into individual tracks, thus undoing the ridiculous decision to make this a one-track album on the original CD pressing), but where I'll almost certainly never feel the need to listen to all of them in order again. If you can find it cheap (and online; I would never recommend buying this in person), definitely consider getting it.\n\nSend me your thoughts\n\nBatman - 1989 Paisley Park\n\n3\n\n(Bad)\n\nBest song: no\n\nThis album did not need Prince to make it. Batman was going to be a huge hit no matter what (I still enjoy it as effective goth camp), and it's difficult to shake the feeling that Prince (who hadn't exactly been lighting the world on fire lately with his sales numbers) signed onto the project solely to have an automatic shot at a multi-week #1 album. Well, he got what he wanted, but in the process he also made an album that long served as a punchline for people taking potshots at him.\n\nThe album sounds okayish at first as background music, but it fails to hold my attention when given any more than a cursory listen. The only track that stands out in any effective way is the closing \"Batdance,\" and that's only because it's one of Prince's most insanely awful ideas ever. Two of the songs from the album, \"Partyman\" and \"Trust,\" were prominently featured in the film itself, and while they serve a function as a strange counter to the standard orchestration of the rest of the movie, they sound completely limp and lifeless when listened to on their own. Just a couple of lazy throwaways that Prince could have come up with without breaking a sweat, that's what these sound like. \"The Future\" (which only appears briefly in the background near the beginning of the film) is no better, featuring what almost sounds like half of a melody missing its companion, over a lazy never-changing beat. Of the other songs, only \"Electric Chair\" shows any life and energy, but that still has little else. The only other track that especially stands out for better or worse is \"The Arms of Orion,\" a ballad duet with Sheena Easton that reaches galactic proportions of tackiness. The rest just kinda sucks.\n\nOne could make the argument that this album is mostly harmless, and aside from something like \"Batdance\" doesn't feature anything that jumps out as an offensively bad idea. The problem I have is that most of the album contains ordinary bad ideas, and these bad ideas could have come from one of a thousand hacks that normally wouldn't have been fit to carry Prince's high-heeled shoes. There are many musicians who could have grabbed a dozen or so audio samples from the movie and stuck them at random through an album of tossed-off material, and the idea that such a thing could come from Prince is pretty infuriating. Avoid.\n\nSend me your thoughts\n\ntrfesok.aol.com (03/13/11)\n\nI think that you're way too hard on this one. Sure, it's totally lightweight and adds nothing to Prince's legacy. Still, it's a fun collection of pop songs. Most of them are very catchy and danceable. \"Electric Chair\" might be my favorite, because of the chorus lyric (\"If a man is guilty/For what goes on his mind/Give me the electric chair/For all my future crimes) -- very funny. I'm even sucked in by \"The Arms of Orion\", even if it's totally corny. It has very lovely vocals. I used to really hate \"Batdance\", because at the time it was associated with the oversaturation of the hype that surrounded the release of the film (and the video is really stupid). Now, however, I can appreciate the clever way Prince intertwined the samples from the film dialogue, the album's songs and the outtake \"200 Balloons.\" The only song I outright can't stand is the idiotic \"Scandalous\", another of Prince's annoying sex ballads. Although I suppose I get annoyed by these because I have a hard time imagining weeny little Prince as any woman's \"fantaseeee.\"\n\nOne thing I do understand is why the music is barely used in the film. It really doesn't fit the tone of the movie at all. For instance, I can't imagine Michael Keaton stating that he wants to \"bump dat body\" when thinking of Kim Basinger. However, looked at as simply a collection of Prince songs, it comes up just fine. No reason for a Prince fan to not have it in the collection that I can hear.\n\nGraffiti Bridge - 1990 Paisley Park\n\n6\n\n(Mediocre)\n\nBest song: Thieves In The Temple\n\nThe biggest problem with this album (yet another soundtrack to yet another film starring Prince that I'll never see, this time a sequel to Purple Rain) is that he used it as an opportunity to prop up some of his various disciples. All of the songs on here are written by Prince, but about half of them involve either Prince collaborating with somebody else or simply giving the song outright to somebody else. I can honestly say that the most of the tracks on here that formally feature somebody other than/in addition to Prince range from sadly disappointing (\"We Can Funk,\" a wasted opportunity to make something interesting with George Clinton) to actively irritating. The four tracks done by The Time might have sounded pretty hip back in 1990, but today they make me feel completely embarrassed to listen to them, and the less said about the material featuring Tevin Campbell the better. \"Melody Cool,\" featuring Mavis Staples (a well-established old soul singer in her own right) is little better, though it does show a strong voice from Mavis (fortunately, she sounds nice enough in the title track, which is essentially a psychedelic gospel number, and that makes me happy). All told, this 68-minute album (yet another double album, but concealed by the fact that it all fits on one CD) contains 25 minutes of material that I find close to worthless, and it's hard for me to have very warm feelings towards an album like that.\n\nThis is really too bad given that a 40-minute album, featuring just Prince performances of his own material, wouldn't be bad at all. I would never be able to adore it - there's a little too much aping of various 80's and early 90's trends that I'd tried to forget about to make this great - but I would definitely feel warmer towards it than not. \"Can't Stop this Feeling I Got\" (a leftover from 1982) isn't exactly one of Prince's best lightweight pop songs, but it's definitely not one of his worst either, and it's a fun enough way to start the album. Another highlight from early on is \"The Question of U,\" a leftover from Parade (I actually guessed this before I read it for sure; in parts it sounds like an alternate version of \"Under the Cherry Moon\") that has a neat atmosphere and moody guitar work to spare.\n\nCovering all the other good songs: \"Elephants and Flowers\" is a stomping, noisy groove that would have been a highlight on any late 80's Prince album (including Sign). \"Joy in Repetition\" is clearly a Sign outtake, and that's a good thing; there's a lot of low-key moody guitar and bass work, and while there's a lot of rambling vocals, the parts that emphasize the message of the title are enough to rein it in. \"Tick, Tick, Bang\" is a Controversy outtake, and it has appropriately inventive synth and drum work that makes it worthy of that period. \"Thieves in the Temple\" was the album's biggest hit, and it's probably the album's best song as well: it's catchy, it has a deep effective throbbing sound, and it's just oh so delightfully moody. Finally, \"Still Would Stand All Time\" is a little too slow and draggy to be especially noteworthy, but it mostly avoids tackiness, so it's nice enough.\n\nThings aren't all wine and roses on the Prince side, of course; the two \"New Power Generation\" tracks are as embarrassing today as anything from the collaborative portion of the album. Ultimately, then, this album ends up being the most frustrating disc Prince had made to this point, and that says a LOT. There are eight, count them eight perfectly solid Prince songs on this album, and in any other circumstance that would lead to a pretty decent rating at minimum. Yet the rest of this album, for somebody like me with no nostalgic attachment to the music of this period, is pretty much unlistenable, and this is enough to discourage me from even going as high as a 7. If you can get the good songs from this album in a cheap way, go for it, but stay away from the rest.\n\nSend me your thoughts\n\nDiamonds And Pearls - 1991 Paisley Park\n\n7\n\n(Mediocre / Good)\n\nBest song: Money Don't Matter 2 Night\n\nThe first thing that jumped out to me in suggesting this album was somewhat likely to suck is that, once again, it's more than an hour long. This is the fourth album Prince had made in less than ten years that would have qualified as a double album back in the days of LPs, and once again there isn't nearly enough solid material to fill it out. And to think this problem would only get worse ...\n\nAnyway, for the second time in a few years (the first being The Black Album, of course), Prince made an album that served as a response to continuous criticisms that he had veered too much towards pop and away from \"urban\" music. Much like The Black Album, this is an album that acknowledges the developments that had happened in this vein without Prince's direct input, and as on The Black Album a good chunk of it sounds really embarrassing today. In particular, this album makes prominent use of a guest rapper (that would appear on other Prince albums as well), Tony Mosely (formally a member of The New Power Generation, Prince's new backing band), and every contribution he makes sounds to me like it's drawing from all of the ridiculous stereotypes that I've built up in my mind for the genre. I can take a little solace, at least, that most people who enjoy rap seem also to think that these aspects kinda suck on this album.\n\nRap aspects aside, a lot of this album is basically dance club muzak, overly emphasizing generic 90's rhythms that are primarily intended to bring in people who don't actually like to listen to music. Oh, and a couple of the ballads are pretty icky and gloppy, without much in the way of hooks that please me. Truth be told, you could cut out the last three tracks (the closing \"Live 4 Love\" has some nice noisy guitar work, but it's too little too late), which take up almost 20 minutes by themselves, without me feeling the least bit of loss, and the less said about the awful \"Jughead\" (the album's rapping nadir) the better.\n\nStill, there's quite a bit of nice material strewn throughout the first 3/4's of the album. \"Thunder\" is big stupid anthemic pop at its most glorious, and I even don't mind that it's clearly overlong (at 5:45). \"Daddy Pop\" and \"Cream\" are fun pop songs (funny that, on an album so devoted to reclaiming \"urban\" fans, there are still a nice bunch of pop songs) that show Prince jumping out of his skin to sound like the Prince from a decade earlier, and while they don't quite succeed on that level, I'm glad they're here. \"Strollin'\" is neat lightweight jazz-funk that gives some nice diversity to the album, \"Gett Off\" has enough oomph (lyrical and otherwise) to make its club-pop foundation almost sorta work, and even \"Willing and Able\" and \"Walk Don't Walk\" have enough charms to make me want to listen to them once in a while. The most pleasant surprise, though, is the oh-so-lovely keyboard-heavy soul of \"Money Don't Matter 2 Night,\" where it sounds (to me) like Prince managed to pull off an almost dead-on imitation of prime 70's Stevie Wonder. The keyboards and the percussion might be updated, but it's got a silky smooth delivery, an effortlessly catchy melody, and just such a warm vibe to it that I can't help but make the comparison. It may be just a genre exercise, but it's a great genre exercise, and it's easily my favorite song of the album.\n\nAs on the last album, there's a a lot of good material here that makes me feel a bit ridiculous giving this a mediocre rating, but I just can't get over how bad the lesser stuff is. Plus, while Prince's new band is really solid, there's a weird sterility in the sound that saps away some of the enjoyment even in the songs I basically like. Find a way to get the best songs (especially \"Money Don't Matter 2 Night\"), but use good judgement.\n\nSend me your thoughts\n\nLove Symbol - 1992 Paisley Park\n\n9\n\n(Good)\n\nBest song: My Name Is Prince or 7\n\nYet another double album (75 minutes this time!), and there's a good chunk of filler, but the best material is so goofily entertaining that I can't help but look upon this album favorably. In terms of placement in overall career arc, the comparison that keeps popping into my mind (maybe it's not the best comparison, but I can't think of one better) is with Low Budget by The Kinks: it's a mid-period album, made a little after the generally accepted \"prime\" of the artist had passed; it incorporates contemporary trends with glee and with pizazz; and, of course, it shows an overpowering desire for a few hit singles. Of course, the album also shows an amazing level of self-indulgence, even for Prince, but even the most ridiculous aspects (like, say, the half-finished \"soap opera\" featuring Kirstie Alley that keeps popping up during the album but, in its incomplete form, doesn't make much sense) end up helping the vibe of the album more than hurting it.\n\nIf there's a serious problem with the album, it's in a stretch in the middle of the album. Starting from the first \"Segue\" track, which introduces the Kirstie Alley thread, the only tracks I like in an eight track stretch are \"Blue Light\" (light reggae that's hardly substantial but is nonetheless an amusing stylistic diversion) and \"The Continental\" (a somewhat pro forma beat-heavy track that actually becomes disturbingly entertaining once it turns into light porn), and those hardly rise much above the level of \"pretty okay.\" The other tracks in this stretch just have the same Prince autopilot feel that bothered me with much of the material on the last album, though maybe these have somewhat \"darker\" production.\n\nEverything outside this stretch, though, is really great, for both quality and kitsch reasons. The opening \"My Name is Prince\" takes the \"self-promoting hip-hop\" genre into previously unreached stratospheres, featuring amazing lines like this page's main tagline, or \"I did not come to funk around/'til I get your daughter, won't leave this town.\" There's a completely ridiculous rap in the middle, but it just feels right, even featuring off-the-charts lines like \"Boy, I'll sink u like the ship Poseidon Adventure/U're bumping dentures 2 to be cocksure.\" The big synths, the beat, the popping basslines, the generic turntable scratching, everything makes this feel like a huge important statement about how Prince is the greatest force in the universe, and it's so earnest and funny that I can't help but enjoy it. I don't know how much it's meant to be taken as a comedy number (I'm guessing little to none), but I sure enjoy it as one.\n\n\"Sexy M.F.\" and \"Love 2 the 9's\" also fall into the \"so ridiculous they're kinda awesome\" category. Prince actually seems to have this rap thing somewhat down, and the combination in the chorus of that neat simple horn line and Prince's little kiss before the chorus is a strong enough hook to lift the song on its own. The instrumentation is varied and a lot of fun (horns, organy synths, solid guitar and bass, all very lively), and of course there's those ridiculous \"SHAKING THAT ASS SHAKING THAT ASS\" shouts that have me mentally rolling in the aisles. Yeah, this is one entertaining M.F. of a song. \"Love 2 the 9's\" might be even better, though. The song starts off as one of Prince's best, most playful lightweight ballads ever, but in the middle it starts its shift into more beat heavy territory until it culminates in the epic \"DANCE GIRL, LEMME SEE THAT BOOTY BOOM!!\" chants in the middle, before returning to the main song somewhat. I'd rather Prince rode the main portion of the song more than he did, but going off in such a weird direction seems about right for him, and I enjoy the song completely.\n\nThe remaining tracks before the aforementioned cruddy section are nice, too. \"The Morning Papers\" is a solid gospelish rock song with fine guitar, and \"The Max\" has a great \"cosmic\" opening synth sound that gives way to a terrific funky piano/bass riff that Prince rides well through the song. The guest rapping starts to get a little tiring on this track, but it doesn't bother me too much. Many tracks later, after about half an hour of relative mediocrity, we come to the album's other main highlight, simply titled \"7.\" Try to imagine an Arabian-tinged funk/gospel song, with one of the best melodies Prince would write post-Signs, and you'll get an idea of how terrific this is. It's definitely one of the most addictive songs of the era.\n\nThe penultimate \"Segue\" track is completely ridiculous, and the closing \"The Sacrifice of Victor\" is a rather boring beat-heavy way to end the album, but the two tracks that come right before it are pretty great. \"And God Created Woman\" has a mystical sensuality to it that I could only imagine Prince creating, and the combination of this vibe and this melody makes it a classic. And finally, \"3 Chains O' Gold\" is a (borderline prog rock) adult pop song that could theoretically suck if it didn't keep jumping from interesting idea to interesting idea with such reckless abandon. If there's a better representation on this album of Prince's spastic genius than this song, I can't think of it.\n\nLook, this is a horribly padded out double album, but it could have been an absolutely amazing single album, and that's enough to guarantee this a solid grade. I can't imagine a serious Prince fan not enjoying at least half of this a lot. And besides, for a 15th album, this is pretty top-shelf stuff.\n\nSend me your thoughts\n\nLarry Boehm (larry.boehm.gmail.com) (11/13/11)\n\nJohn,\n\nI really enjoy your reviews and was wondering if you could help me with something. I'm trying to find the meaning of the song 7 by Prince.\n\nI heard the song tonight and was thinking of the meaning...I have a story in my head but can't find it on the internet. All the sites talk about religious meaning, prince and sex, and other biblical stuff. I remember something completely different.\n\nWhat I remember is at the time there was some kind of police scandal/cover up where seven officers were involved in something heinous and I believe it was against a black person. Rodney King and the LA riots happened around then but i dont think it was that. This is where I'm foggy.. One officer came forward, made a bargain ,and it brought down all seven men...or actually I think they were all tried but still got off, or, maybe one guy got less than the others....\n\nAnyway, I think the song was about these 7 bad men. They stood in the way of brothely love and the truth. Prince is saying that we are gonna watch these seven men fall...don't worry..even though they got off one day they will die and go to hell (The demonic laughter at the start of the song).\n\nI'm so sure I'm not making this up but I can't find the relating story...it was big news at the time and this was princes response to the situation.\n\nAny thoughts.\n\nThanks\n\nThe Hits/B-Sides - 1993 Warner Bros.\n\nB\n\n(Very Good)\n\nBest song: Impossible to choose\n\nPrince's version of The Kink Kronikles, this is a fantastic (albeit extremely comprehensive) compilation of Prince's output to this point, and can satisfy both newcomers and fans who already have all of Prince's albums. The \"Hits\" portion of the album (the first two discs) has a few tracks that are identical to their studio counterparts, but more than half of it is the single versions of these tracks, so there's less redundancy than you might think. It's not that I exactly prefer to hear \"When Doves Cry\" without its bizarre synth solo, or \"I Could Never Take the Place of Your Man\" without the instrumental second half, or \"1999\" without the funny introductory monologue, but it's fun to have these alternate versions. The stretch also contains a Prince-sung version of \"Nothing Compares to U\" (written fo"
