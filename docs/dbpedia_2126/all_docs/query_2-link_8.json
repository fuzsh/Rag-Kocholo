Bad Brains, Joy Division, and the Smiths were some of the bands. Anybody else had or still have a passion for Prince and Punk?\n\nYes, me. The Clash, PIL, The Damned, The Ruts, Dead Kennedys, Bad Brains, Black Flag, DOA, MDC, The Stranglers, 999 ... I still listen to most of these, The Clash in particular.\n\nPhilG\n\nJediMaster said:\n\nDo note that PhilG listed punk and POST punk.

Anyways this was the only local show that regularly showed Prince videos like Controversy,Sexuality, Dirty Mind, Uptown,1999, Little Red Corvette, and especially Automatic. I remember a clip of Snow White singing \"Someday My Prince will Come...\" before the Prince video would start.\n\nJediMaster\n\nPhilG said:\n\nJediMaster said:\n\nDo note that PhilG listed punk and POST punk.

I remember a clip of Snow White singing \"Someday My Prince will Come...\" before the Prince video would start.\n\nY'know, its funny. I was into this scene as well in the 80s, and Prince was one of the few mainstream artists who actually was respected amongst those in the scene. I remeber going to clubs that played all the above acts, and Prince tunes were always mixed in (like you said, especially \"Automatic\")\n\nDo not hurry yourself in your spirit to become offended, for the taking of offense is what rests in the bosom of the stupid ones.

But you forgot Minor Threat(Ian McKaye), the Circle Jerks, The Misfits, the Descendents, and Black Flag, no name a few more. Bad Brains kick ass! Just been getting back into all that music I used to listen to again recently. For anyone here who grew up in Mpls., do you remember Blind Approach? Some of the best hard-core punk shows ever!\n\nAnd what's up with the Smiths/Prince connection. I love the Smiths as well, and it seems like a lot of Prince fans on here do too. I never would have thought.\n\n\"I saw a woman with major Hammer pants on the subway a few weeks ago and totally thought of you.\" - sextonseven"
