        "text": "Prince was a genius indeed R & B was his thing. Pop, psychedelia rock, rap Prince dabbed in it all. As with most artist Prince kept an eye on current musical trends. The genius in Prince is that he did sample many music genres, his creativity was infinite. The man's mind was infinite in creativity. Calling Prince a new wave artist is a compliment as he embraced the new wave sound as well throughout the 1980's incorporating it into his music.\n\nI agree with the general consensus that, while I would generally categorize his music as pop/R&B/funk if I ever had to lump his music into any genre, he definitely has a good handful or so of tracks (most of which have been mentioned already) that absolutely have a New Wave influence. In fact, you could fit these tracks onto a New Wave playlist or mix and they would fit right in, and maybe blow/open some minds in the process (in the same way you could put \"Bambi\" on a playlist of '70s rock and do the same thing).\n\nAlso it's funny @possumdude mentioned Elvis Costello in his original post, because I view him similarly to how I view Prince. Most would label Costello's music as rock or New Wave, but may of his songs also carry a heavy influence of other genres, like R&B, ska, soul, jazz, rockabilly, and country. Except I find Prince to be even more genre ambiguous.\n\nIt’s funny I became interested in Prince because I thought he was New Wave. Based on the few songs I had heard - Dirty Mind, Head - plus his look on Controversy. 1999 had a great new wave riff and I was hoping for a whole album of neat, economic synth grooves, but what I got was messy hard to pin down and yet ultimately so much better than what I could have imagined.\n\nSo I’m going to say Prince was flirting with new wave during the time I discovered him but it’s just what he was into at the time. I wouldn’t call him new wave.\n\nRemember that joke on the Time’s What Time is It? album at the end of the very new wave “Onedayimgonnabesomebody”: “we don’t like new wave!” followed by loads of cackling laughter.\n\nChronologically, he definitely fits in that early 80's New Wave movement and his guitar work has always shifted him towards the rockier side of pop. But, echoing others, Prince was so versatile and unpredictable that he's an artist where genre or even sub genre don't really apply.\n\nI have a feeling that if he heard something from Gary Numan, Thomas Dolby or even A Flock of Seagulls, he might say \"How did they make that sound? I want to make that sound!\" and he'd do it.....and then discard it for something else.\n\nYes, very eclectic tastes, big fan of the Cocteau Twins as well.\n\nBut yes, I just don't see him as 'New Wave' - we in the UK have a much stricter definition, it ends in around 1981, and Prince sits more easily in the R'n'B category I think.\n\nJust revisited the \"Modernaire\" song that Prince wrote for Dez Dickerson, and I don't know how anyone could hear this (or the Prince solo songs very similar to this) and say Prince had zero New Wave in him whatsoever. This is some straight up Flock Of Seagulls, Gary Numan type stuff here!"
