        "text": "Just curious to see what everyone here thinks: was Prince part of New Wave, or not? A lot of people seem to have a dismissive mentality of Prince being too \"pop\" or \"R&B\" to fit into the new wave category, while ignoring how experimental he was with his first 3-4 albums of the 1980s. Dirty Mind, Controversy, 1999, and even Purple Rain to an extent all share quite a bit of musical DNA with the new wave movement: punk and rockabilly influences, electronic drums and synthesizers galore, and a genre-appropriate aesthetic and fashion sense.\n\nThe people who dismiss the idea of Prince as a New Wave artist altogether seem to conflate his later status as a larger-than-life Pop Icon with what he was doing during the early 80s, when the two couldn't be further apart. Prince wasn't a worldwide superstar before Purple Rain came out, and he very much was an alternative to fellow funk/R&B/pop artists on the scene. Songs like \"When You Were Mine\" and \"Ronnie Talk To Russia\" would fit in alongside the likes of Elvis Costello, while \"Automatic\" isn't entirely dissimilar from what Gary Numan or Thomas Dolby were doing. So what exactly is it that causes this aversion to labeling Prince as a \"New Wave\" artist? It seems like arbitrary gatekeeping at best, and old school race-based musical segregation at worst.\n\nAny thoughts or takes on this topic?\n\nPrince could fit himself into any genre he wanted to. He was extremely versatile as a musician and a songwriter. Putting a brand on him would be pointless because the brand itself would keep changing. Calling him a pop artist simply means that he was a popular artist. It doesnâ€™t dismiss him from being anything. He had some new wave elements in his sound but there was so much more.\n\nI think of him as a pop artist who was capable of going into any direction he wanted to at any given time.\n\nDefinitely seems like New Wave is way too small a categorization for Prince - and as a designation nearly forgotten about. That genre seems kind of dead, like still referring to REM as College Rock. Obviously they became more than that and College Rock itself switched it's branding to Alternative Rock and then Indie Rock (even if the artist is on a major label.) Terms like New Wave and Post Punk seem very quaint and out of fashion. New Wave artists either became classic rock or grandfathers of alternative rock.\n\nRetroactively wanting Prince to be considered New Wave is fine, but he definitely wasn't thought to be at the time - which may have a lot to do with race.\n\nPart of the problem is trying to define what New Wave was - very nebulous.\n\nI think a few tracks may fall more into what I think of as New Wave - When You Were Mine especially - but most of his stuff is just too original, too idiosyncratic, to be so neatly categorized.\n\nAgree with you on this, but I'd narrow Prince's \"New Wave\" period to 1980-82 (Dirty Mind through 1999). I'd even throw in some of the songs he gave to other artists (such as After Hi School to The Time and He's So Dull to Vanity 6) as fitting squarely into the New Wave category as well.\n\nPost-'82, Prince's ambitions of rock superstardom far eclipsed the narrow confines of New Wave, though elements were still there in parts of Purple Rain (especially Computer Blue). By 1985 however, all traces of the genre has basically vanished from his musical pallette.\n\nYes, though it's still applicable to describe an element of his music.\n\n\"College\" and \"indie\" overlapped, but neither were synonymous with \"alternative,\" a far wider net encompassing many different flavors and ethos. In my experience; I was in high school during the 1980s window when the distinctions between the mainstream and all its alternatives seemed sharpest - though Prince had already transcended that line, too, for a couple records."
