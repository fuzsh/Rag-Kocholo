        "text": "The Rock the Garden audience went wild for The Revolution, Prince's backing band from the early '80s. Wendy Melvoin (guitar), Lisa Coleman (keys), Dr. Fink (keys), Bobby Z (drums), and Brownmark (bass) were unstoppable, opening with \"Computer Blue\" and storming through six other Purple Rain hits with vocal assists from Stokley of Mint Condition. They even played \"Erotic City\" with Bon Iver's Justin Vernon on lead vocals. \"These songs belong to you. We're just the band,\" Melvoin says before the renowned opening chords of \"Purple Rain.\"\n\nSongs performed\n\nComputer Blue\n\nTake Me With U\n\nLet's Work\n\n1999\n\nKiss\n\nWhen Doves Cry\n\nLet's Go Crazy\n\nI Would Die 4 U\n\nBaby I'm a Star\n\nPurple Rain\n\nTune in at 10 a.m. each day the week of August 7 to hear highlights from the main stage acts at Rock the Garden 2017."
