        "text": "\"I strive for originality in my music,\" Prince declared in a 1985 interview with MTV. \"That was, and will always be the case.\"\n\nIt was this determination to do things his own inimitable way that birthed the decade's most audacious superstar project: Purple Rain.\n\nPrior to the album's June 25, 1984 release, Prince had scored some mainstream hits — including \"1999\" and \"Little Red Corvette\" — but hadn't fully blossomed into the prolific, world-conquering musical hero he's now immortalized as. Nor did he have acting experience. Yet, Prince somehow managed to convince his management and label into financing a big-screen hybrid of romance, drama and musical accompanied by an equally ambitious pop soundtrack.\n\nIt was an inherently risky career strategy that could have derailed the Purple One's remarkable rise to greatness in one fell swoop. Instead, Purple Rain enjoyed blockbuster success at both the box office and on the charts, with the film grossing more than $68 million worldwide and the album topping the Billboard 200 for a remarkable 24 weeks.\n\nInitially conceived as a double album featuring protege girl group Apollonia 6 and funk rock associates the Time, the Purple Rain OST worked as an entirely separate entity, too. In fact, it had already sold 2.5 million copies in the States before the movie hit theaters, largely thanks to the immediacy of lead single \"When Doves Cry,\" Prince's first ever Billboard Hot 100 No. 1.\n\nAnd a full 40 years on from its release, Purple Rain's diverse range of power ballads, hard rockers and party anthems still possess the power to stun, whether the phrase \"You have to purify yourself in the waters of Lake Minnetonka\" is familiar or not. Here's a look at why the GRAMMY-winning record — and 2010 GRAMMY Hall of Fame inductee — is regarded as such a trailblazer.\n\nIt Hopped Genres Like No Album Before\n\nWhile the streaming age has encouraged artists and listeners to embrace multiple genres, back in the 1980s, \"stay in your lane\" was the common mindset. Of course, a musician as versatile and innovative as Prince was never going to adhere to such a restriction.\n\nThe Purple One had already melded pop, soul, R&B, and dance to perfection on predecessor 1999. But on his magnum opus, the star took his sonic adventurism even further, flirting with neo-psychedelia, heavy metal and gospel on nine tracks which completely eschewed any form of predictability. Even its most mainstream number refused to play by the rules: despite its inherent funkiness, \"When Doves Cry\" is a rare chart-topper without any bass!\n\nAs you'd expect from such a virtuoso, Prince mastered every musical diversion taken. And the album's 25 million sales worldwide proved that audiences were more than happy to go along for the ride.\n\nIt Championed Female Talent On And Behind The Stage\n\nAlthough the likes of Jill Jones, Wendy Melvoin and Lisa Coleman had contributed to previous Prince albums, Purple Rain was the first time the Purple One pushed his female musical proteges to the forefront. On \"Take Me With U,\" he shares lead vocals with one of his most famous, Apollonia. On its accompanying tour, he invited Sheila E. to be his opening act. And in something of a rarity even still today, two of the soundtrack's engineers, Susan Rogers and Peggy McCreary, were women.\n\nMelvoin and Coleman would go on to become artists in their own right as Wendy and Lisa, of course. And Prince would also help to radically transform Sheena Easton from a demure balladeer into a pop vixen; compose hits by the Bangles (\"Manic Monday\"), Martika (\"Love Thy Will Be Done\"), and Sinead O'Connor (\"Nothing Compares 2 U\"); and provide career launchpads for Bria Valente and 3RDEYEGIRL.\n\nIt Broke Numerous Records\n\nAs well as pushing all kinds of boundaries, Purple Rain also broke all kinds of records, including one at the music industry's most prestigious night of the year. At the 1985 GRAMMY Awards, Prince became the first Black artist ever to win Best Rock Performance By A Duo Or Group With Vocal, beating the likes of the Cars, Genesis, Van Halen, and Yes in the process. Purple Rain also picked up Best Score Soundtrack for Visual Media at the same ceremony, and was nominated in the night's most coveted Category, Album Of The Year.\n\nAnother impressive feat was the one that had only previously been achieved by the Beatles and Elvis Presley. With the same-named movie also hitting the top of the box office chart, Prince became only the third artist in history to score a No. 1 album, film and song in the same calendar year.\n\nIt Changed How Albums Were Sold\n\nAlthough it seems positively chaste compared to the likes of \"WAP,\" \"Anaconda,\" and \"My Neck, My Back (Lick It),\" Purple Rain's tale of a \"sex fiend\" who enjoys pleasuring herself in hotel lobbies was deemed so provocative at the time of release that it inadvertently instigated a political taskforce.\n\nAppalled by the sexual lyrical content of \"Darling Nikki,\" a track she caught her 11-year-old daughter Karenna listening to, future Second Lady Tipper Gore decided to set up the Parents Music Resource Centre with three other \"Washington Wives.\" The organization subsequently persuaded the record industry and retailers to issue any album containing child-unfriendly material with Parental Advisory stickers. (Another Prince-penned hit, Sheena Easton's \"Sugar Walls,\" was also included alongside \"Darling Nikki\" in the \"Filthy 15\" list of songs the PMRC deemed to be the most offensive examples.)\n\nIt Paved The Way For The Pop Star Film\n\nPrince was the first pop superstar from the 1980s holy trinity to bridge the gap between Hollywood and MTV, with Purple Rain arriving eight months before Madonna's star turn in Desperately Seeking Susan and four years before Michael Jackson's fantastical anthology Moonwalker. And it spawned a whole host of similar vanity projects, too.\n\nYou can trace the roots of everything from Mariah Carey's Glitter to Eminem's 8 Mile back to the tale of a troubled musical prodigy — nicknamed The Kid — who finds solace from his abusive home life at Minneapolis' hottest night spot. And while the acting and screenplay were never going to trouble the Academy Awards (as lead actress Apollonia predicted, however, it did pick up Best Score), Purple Rain's spellbinding onstage performances captures the euphoria of live music better than any other concert film, fictional or real.\n\nIt Helped Redefine Masculinity in Pop\n\n\"I'm not a woman, I'm not a man/ I am something that you'll never understand,\" Prince sings on Purple Rain's biggest dance floor number \"I Would Die 4 U\" — one of many occasions in both the album and film that challenged notions of masculinity, gender and sexuality even stronger than the Purple One had before.\n\nIndeed, although the early '80s was unarguably a boom period for white British pop stars outside the heteronormative norm, it was rarer to find artists of color so willing to embrace such fluidity. Prince, however, had no problem — whether sporting his now-iconic dandy-ish, ruffled white shirt and flamboyant purple jacket combo, or unleashing his impressive array of diva-like shrieks and screams on \"Computer Blue\" and \"The Beautiful Ones.\" André 3000, Lil Nas X and Frank Ocean are just a few of the contemporary names who have since felt comfortable enough to express themselves in similarly transgressive fashion.\n\nIt Added To The Great American Songbook\n\nFrom the apocalyptic rockabilly of \"Let's Go Crazy\" (\"We're all excited/ But we don't know why/ Maybe it's 'cause/ We're all gonna die\") and messianic new wave of \"I Would Die 4 U,\" to the experimental rock of \"Computer Blue\" and self-fulfilling prophecy of \"Baby, I'm A Star,\" Purple Rain delights at every musical turn. But it's the title track that continues to resonate the most.\n\nFollowing Prince's untimely death in 2016, it was \"Purple Rain\" — not \"1999,\" not \"Kiss,\" not \"The Most Beautiful Girl in the World\" — that many fans gravitated toward first. Initially conceived as a country duet with Stevie Nicks, the epic power ballad was described by Prince as pertaining \"to the end of the world and being with the one you love and letting your faith/ God guide you through the purple rain.\"\n\nThe superstar acts every inch the preacher on the emotional tour-de-force. And as the final song that Prince ever performed live — on the Atlanta leg of his Piano & A Microphone tour, a week before his untimely passing — closed the curtains on a truly revolutionary career.\n\nGRAMMY Rewind: Lizzo Thanks Prince For His Influence After \"About Damn Time\" Wins Record Of The Year In 2023\n\nLos Lonely Boys have found success in spades over the past two decades, thanks in no small part to their familial bonds.\n\nFollowing in the footsteps of their musician father Enrique Garza, Mexican American brothers JoJo (vocals, bass), Henry (guitar, vocals) and Ringo Garza (drums, vocals) formed Los Lonely Boys in 1997. Their dynamic, \"Texican Rock ‘n Roll\" sound netted the group a GRAMMY in 2005, as well as five career total nominations. Throughout their career, togetherness has remained an important component of their artistry.\n\n\"We're homebodies, we're family men and this is where we're most happy,\" JoJo Garza tells GRAMMY.com. \"But when we get out there and we're on stage and we're in a different city, different state or whatever, the way that people make us feel like family is, it's a home away from home feeling.\"\n\nThat feeling inspired the band to reunite in 2022 after a four-year hiatus. Their return tour, which included several shows with the Who, went so well that they decided to also get back into the studio and record new music. On Aug. 2, the band will release their first album of new music in 11 years, Resurrection. Each song on the album sounds different, highlighting Los Lonely Boys' roots in Texas blues, soul, country, and Tejano music.\n\n\"When we got back together and started jamming, I think the rejuvenation, it came natural, the same, and it just felt right, fresh,\" says Ringo Garza. \"I think our playing is the same as anything that gets older. If it doesn't start to rot, it gets better.\"\n\nThe Garza brothers have built their success through belief in one another. It paid off early on, when San Angelo, Texas club owner John R. Steele hired the group as his house band (and later became LLB's road manager). They also supported their musician father before branching out as a trio. In 2003, they struck gold when they got the opportunity to record their self-titled debut album at Willie Nelson's Pedernales Recording Studio in Austin.\n\nReleased in 2004, Los Lonely Boys' lead single, \"Heaven,\" hit No. 1 on the Billboard adult contemporary chart and reached the top 40 on the Billboard Hot 100. The following year, the song took home a golden gramophone for Best Pop Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal.\n\nTheir success allowed them the chance to collaborate with the other musicians. Los Lonely Boys partnered with Santana on 2005's \"I Don’t Wanna Lose Your Love,\" performed with Ronnie Milsap on an episode of \"CMT's Crossroads,\" and released music with Dr. John, Enrique Garza Sr. and Willie Nelson. LLB also released a string of popular studio albums, including 2006’s Sacred, 2008’s Forgiven, 2011’s Rockpango, and 2013’s Revelation.\n\nRecorded in part at Henry’s home studio in Texas, Resurrection finds the trio continuing to channel their love of making music together. Their unique sound continues on the album, featuring everything from the Beatles-eque pop of \"Wish You Would\" to the smooth R&B and soulfulness of \"Dance With Me.\"\n\nFamily continues to be important for the brothers. The album comes at a challenging period as they’ve tried to help and make their father comfortable after he suffered a stroke and heart attack earlier this summer. Ahead of the Resurrection's release, the group spoke with GRAMMY.com about the importance of their brotherly bond and how music has a magical quality that lets them connect with others.\n\nThis interview has been edited for clarity and brevity.\n\nThe new album is the band’s first in 11 years and comes on the heels of a recent return to the road. What brought everyone back together?\n\nHenry Garza: We got to give all that credit to the man upstairs, brother. Of course, we could take some little bit of credit for that being brothers and family, but we accredit the higher power man. It's just the way things happen. It's like why are the stars in the places they are and why did that one shine brighter tonight than the last?\n\nJoJo Garza: We need to pay our bills, man. I'm kidding. I mean, it is our livelihood, but it ultimately comes down to realizing that we still have a major purpose. While we have life in our bones, we still have a purpose to express what the creator has given us as a blessing, but also to express purpose in needing to show how important music is and what it means to us to do with it.\n\nHenry: Yeah, we’ve got to still keep spreading that message of love through music.\n\nWhat made the band start thinking about creating new music?\n\nJoJo: We never stopped creating music. Even when we took our much-needed sabbatical, we were still in the process of always writing music. And I think when Covid happened, that really put a halt on what musicians could do as far as touring goes. So, we were able to really sort of almost start over. The songs that we chose for the album were given an ample amount of time to be something we felt really positive about.\n\nSome of [those songs] are about having a good time and a lot of them are about life's lessons, but there's a few tunes in there too that are really, really deep as far as offering some input to the people, to the youth, as well as people in our age bracket as well.\n\nJoJo: We were also personally affected by losing some family members and things like that, just like everyone across the world. Whenever we finally did regroup and saw each other for the first time, one of the first things we did was we gave each other big hugs and big kisses and a lot of crying.\n\nI know that Henry and Ringo had done some work together. One of the first things I told Henry when I had heard \"Send More Love\" was the last time he had delivered a song like this it went global, we went worldwide. We won a GRAMMY.\n\nIt's got the basis of what was going on through Covid and it's kind of like a letter to or a phone call to the man upstairs saying, \"Hey, could you send more love down here because this world is going crazy.\"\n\nWas it challenging starting to play again after a few years apart?\n\nHenry: Oh man. It was hard to remember any of the songs that we had played. It was a really emotional gettogether. When we first started rehearsing again together, every song that we played, even old songs, tears were falling because you just didn't know during that time if and when that was ever going to happen again.\n\nWere there things the band was able to do better or differently on 'Resurrection' with everyone older and wiser?\n\nJoJo: I think as far as the music goes, it’s very apparent that we have matured and grown. We actually embraced a little bit more of the digital aspect of what you can do in a studio.\n\nHenry: There was growth during that period with technology for us and getting into the actual recording part of it ourselves and creating a studio to do the work in. We never had that gift or the comfortableness to be able to do that. We were always recording in somebody else's studio where you're paying a thousand dollars for every second that counts. So, we had some kind of freedom to be able to do that on our own and we grew in that aspect.\n\nJoJo: We were always a live band, [that recorded live to tape]. The magic happens when you're live because then you can't go back and recut it or you can't go back and overdub it. Even when you record a live show, there's just a spark between each of us, a connection that it's really hard to capture. But building our own little studios and having the ability to do it ourselves, it's actually brought us closer and to the idea of maybe we should do a little more of this or a lot more of this instead of having to tour so much. So, that's in the cards for Los Lonely Boys as well. Squad goals.\n\nMy brothers gave me the opportunity to sit in the producer's seat on most of these songs. I was actually mixing some of the record while driving from Texas to California, listening in the car speakers. I was able to tell him, \"Oh no, this has too much bass. We need to move that to the left or the right. Let's swap places.\" The ability to do that. Mix a record while you're driving. Come on man.\n\nThe band’s sound has been called \"Texican Rock n' Roll\" due to the diverse influences and that continues with this new album. Why is it important to have that dynamic, diversified sound?\n\nHenry: We created what we call Texican rock and roll, which is anything and everything that has to do with real music from real musicians. This record really still expresses that about what we're about: family, love, brothers, the message of truth through music and resurrection. There's a little bit of flavor of everything in these songs, so it's kind of hard to just classify it as a certain genre.\n\nRingo Garza: Every single one of our albums has always had a song that you could put in another genre of music, country or pop or rock.\n\nJoJo: It really is because we don't see or feel the boundaries between music. What we promote is not exclusivity, but inclusiveness because we're all one people…We're the human race and music is food for the soul.\n\nHenry: Our dad taught us that music was the universal language, it didn't matter where you were from even if you didn't understand what they were saying. It speaks to everybody all across the board. I think that's our main focus with music.\n\nRingo: When I'm recording drum tracks or vocal tracks, I want my brothers to be impressed more than anything in the world. My brothers and my family. When we can get a song together and it brings a tear to our eyes and makes us love each other even more, that's what I strive for.I think my brothers are the same in that aspect of trying to impress and please one another.\n\nYou've all followed in the footsteps of your father, who himself had a band with his brothers called the Falcones. Why is that brotherly bond and honoring tradition so important?\n\nHenry: If you can imagine a cup being filled with water and it spills over and there's another cup that takes on that water too. Our dad did it with his brothers, our mom's family did it with their brothers and my grandpa. Music was so natural, we thought everybody did it growing up. We owe all that to our greatest teacher, which of course for us is our dad. It began with him, and he’s our biggest hero.\n\nHe's the guy that showed us anything from the Beatles to Willie [Nelson] and Waylon [Jennings] to Richie Valens to Fats Domino. Every song he showed us growing up, we thought he wrote all those songs that he was showing us, and we believed he came on the radio, and we'd be like, \"They're playing your song.\" He didn't deny it either.\n\nRingo: Having each other to play in this band together, it was just as natural as being brothers. I think when we were younger, we knew that we were brothers and we were a band, but I don't think that really dawned on us until we started playing out everywhere and knowing that there's not too many bands of brothers. I think that's where our strength comes from.\n\nJoJo: We're family first. Even if we were doctors or we were lawyers or roofers, we were always going to stick together because that's the way we were raised. That's part of our destiny and that's part of what we're here to express. As beautiful it is as it is to have friends and extended family or whatnot. There's nothing like having true family, true blood.\n\nThis year marks the 20th anniversary of Los Lonely Boys' debut album and one of your biggest hits \"Heaven.\" What do you recall about recording that record?\n\nHenry: The way we grew up, we had zero expectations for anything because it just wasn't in the cards for where we came from. We were completely shocked and completely amazed when we were grabbing success.\n\nRingo: When we were younger playing and writing and recording, we knew that if we continued something was going to happen. But I don't think that we ever thought to ourselves, Hey, let's put this on the album so we can win a GRAMMY or so that we can sell millions of records.\n\nJoJo: We have a very close connection to all the songs [on our debut album], but when it came to \"Heaven,\" that was the only song that it seemed like everybody would pick on. All the people that were the Lonely team [were] basically saying that they didn't see nothing special in that song. The special thing to us was that it was a prayer that Henry had written that he was instructed to write down as a song. So, what a turn of events for everyone that said \"nay\" to have it turned up being the song.\n\nRingo: The first single was supposed to be \"Real Emotions,\" and when we sent out [our music to radio stations in Austin], DJ Jody Denberg played \"Heaven\" instead. It lit the fire. It stayed up there [on the charts] for a little bit, and it broke. We're still able to reap the benefits of that.\n\nWhat was your favorite memory of working at Willie's studio?\n\nHenry: We can't talk about that man. Oh man. [Laughs.]\n\nJoJo: The fact that we were there in a place that belonged to Willie Nelson. We had seen him on TV and heard him on the radio or whatever, you don't imagine that you're going to be that close to people. Basically, that was his home away from home. And so that's pretty freaking huge, man.\n\nHenry: I'll never forget him driving up in his pickup and visiting us while we were outside drinking a couple of herbal refreshments. He treated us just like family. There's a lot of things to remember, but I think the fact that Willie was even around or took the time to make that connection with us.\n\nJoJo: We were able to start meeting other artists and things like that, but he was the first one that said \"these guys got something special. You might want to check him out.\"\n\nHenry: Right around that time when we were recording the record, 9/11 had happened. \"Heaven\" was the only song that was recorded that day, on the day that the Twin Towers were hit and everything, man.\n\nYou later recorded a song with Willie and your dad called \"Outlaws.\" What was your favorite memory from working on that song?\n\nHenry: Our dad always considered himself the missing outlaw. So just to be working with Willie and having our dad work with him and be on the same song, man, that was the treat in itself. TWhen we hear that song, it's like tears to the eye because we were given the blessing to help our dad's dream come true a little bit.\n\nRingo: And it's a rocking song. It's pretty badass.\n\nThe album’s title 'Resurrection' continues the trend of using religious terminology. What drew you to that word?\n\nJoJo: You can definitely tie it to religion, but resurrection exists without religion. When you look at how grass dies every winter and comes back to life and how trees, leaves fall through the fall and the winter and then they return. And resurrection is also like music. It's a gift that most people don't recognize as a gift or as something considered resurrection.\n\nThe reason we chose the term resurrection is because we were off the road for nearly three years and we weren't even sure we were going to play again. When we finally made that decision to come back I felt like…I mentioned the trees, the grass, how the sun rises and sets every day. It's a constant resurrection.We were given a chance to breathe new life into something.\n\nRingo: I love the fact that it does bring people closer to our father, closer to the love of this world in just that name.\n\nHenry: When you got a band like us who won a GRAMMY for a song called \"Heaven,\" and I think that speaks all in itself. So, when you hear a name title for a record called Resurrection, it ties into what we believe and how we were brought up, but it's definitely not something that we were going to go off and say that \"Hey, this is religious.\"\n\nWhat songs from the album surprised you most and how they came together?\n\nHenry: Oh man, all of them. Songs seem to come out of thin air sometimes. Even when you try to write a song, it doesn't [always] happen. So, all of them are really just a surprise.\n\nJoJo: Our song \"Natural Thing\" is really special because something we had already had [written years ago]. The way Ringo delivered it, I can't wait for the rest of the world to be able to hear this song. Ringo usually sings one song per album or something like that, but this one is very dear to us, but it's also very dear to Ringo because he sang it to his wife at their wedding.\n\nHenry: It's a resurrected song.\n\nJoJo: It really is. That's the true resurrection on the album.\n\nThe band's song \"Wish You Would\" has a pretty encouraging message about going for your dreams, while being careful. And conscient. Has becoming parents and grandparents shifted your perspective?\n\nJoJo: We've been parents for a long time. Some of our oldest kids are in their twenties...There’s the old saying of \"be careful what you wish for.\" If you're not careful about what you call dreams and aspirations, it can come with some serious consequences.\n\nAnother song on the album, \"See Your Face\" is a very emotional one as it pays tribute to your mother who passed away in 2015 as well as other family and friends. How was it helpful writing that song?\n\nHenry: It's about our mother and how memories are in your head when you haven't seen someone for so long. You don't want to forget their face, but it's crazy how a memory pops up and you wish you could just hold it and control it.\n\nHenry: Our dad had a massive stroke and a heart attack at the same time. And it's been a really tough time right now.\n\nRingo: It’s crazy how that song came out and the video and everything having to do with our mama and our dad is having a pretty rough time. Nothing is coincidental. Everything is meant to be, there's no such thing as coincidence.\n\nJoJo: \"Wish You Would\" and \"See Your Face\" are kind of intertwined. That's one thing we're here to really express to people, is tell the people you love them or you're going to wish you would because someday you're going to be wishing just to see their face.\n\nJoJo: Do it while you have the time, express to the people that mean the most to you, that they mean that to you.\n\nRingo: I think it ties into even \"Send More Love\" because I think a lot of that is being forgotten.\n\nHenry: Love is growing cold in this world, man.\n\nJoJo: We do music purely because first off, it's a given to us. Secondly, we do it purely for the music and each song that is given to us sort of appears out of thin air. It's definitely given from the creator of all things. There's nothing greater than being able to have the consciousness that we're given as human beings to be able to express these things so deeply.\n\nThe Latest News About Latin Music\n\nLos Lonely Boys Resurrected: The Sibling Rockers Talk Their New Album, Return To The Road & Family Magic\n\nOn 'Mirada,' Ivan Cornejo Redefines The Sound Of Sad Sierreño And Helps Fans Heal Through Music\n\n7 Artists Bringing Reggaeton Mexa To The World: El Malilla, Bellakath & More\n\nRevisiting 'Re': How Café Tacvba’s 1994 Masterpiece Changed Mexican Music Forever\n\nThe Latin Recording Academy Announces 2024 Special Awards Recipients: Los Ángeles Azules, Draco Rosa, Albita, Lolita Flores & More\n\nThis summer continues to dazzle us with an electrifying array of music, with new releases arriving from Jimin (MUSE), Ivan Cornejo (MIRADA), Koe Wetzel (9 Lives), Denzel Curry (King Of The Mischievous South Vol. 2), and Adam Lambert (Afters), and many more this week.

The project is a showcase of talent and growth, featuring powerhouse collaborations with DJ Khaled and Jeezy, the latter of whom features on a remix of her hit \"OKAY.\"\n\nCity Cinderella is JT's first project since parting ways with her former City Girls cohort, Yung Miami. Speaking to Paper Magazine about her new venture, JT explained that the inspiration for the project was simple: \"I just wanted to authentically be myself and make music.\"\n\nRauw Alejandro — \"DEJAME ENTRAR\"\n\nPuerto Rican star Rauw Alejandro has been a song machine since his Sony Latin/Demars Entertainment debut with 2019's Trap Cake, Vol. 1. He'll be releasing his fifth album in five years later this year — and judging by his latest release, it may be his sexiest yet.\n\n\"DEJAME ENTRAR\" sees Alejandro getting close to a woman who once was just a crush, but has now turned into his latest love affair. The singer debuted the sultry, pulsing track with a smooth performance on \"Today\" on July 12; one week later, the song's official release also included the official video, which co-stars actor Adrian Brody.\n\nThough Alejandro hasn't revealed a release date for his next project, he teased on \"Today\" that it will hopefully be done \"soon.\" \"These songs [are] too good to be inside the studio,\" he said.\n\nChildish Gambino — 'Bando Stone & the New World'\n\nJust two months after re-releasing his 2020 project, 3.15.20, under the new title Atavista, Donald Glover is back with another Childish Gambino album, Bando Stone & the New World. The LP features stylistic musical choices that parallel Gambino's past albums, including 2011's Camp, 2013's Because the Internet, and 2016's \"Awaken, My Love!,\" as well as features from Amaarae and Jorja Smith, Flo Milli, Fousheé, and Yeat.\n\nAs Glover revealed in April, Bando Stone & the New World will be his last album under the Childish Gambino moniker. But he's going out with a bang: along with a massive world tour, Bando Stone & the New World is accompanied by a sci-fi film titled Bando.\n\nAccording to a recent interview the New York Times, it seems Glover feels a sense of completion with the project, too. \"Success to me is, honestly, being able to put out a wide-scale album that I would listen to,\" he said. \"For this album, I really wanted to be able to play big rooms and have big, anthemic songs that fill those rooms, so that people feel a sense of togetherness.\"\n\n'Twisters: The Album'\n\nNearly 30 years after the 1996 release of Twister, the blockbuster finally gets a sequel with the highly anticipated Twisters — and an equally exciting accompanying soundtrack. The sprawling Twisters: The Album features some of the biggest names in country music today, with tracks from Luke Combs, Lainey Wilson, Jelly Roll, and many more.\n\nCombs was the first to tease a taste of the soundtrack with his gritty, uptempo tune \"Ain't No Love In Oklahoma,\" which was released alongside a music video that featured clips from the movie. Scenes from the film can also be seen in the clip for Jelly Roll's \"Dead End Road,\" which arrived the day before the album's release.\n\nBut there's so much more to discover across the soundtracks 29 songs, from Megan Moroney's \"Never Left Me\" to Charley Crocket's \"(Ghost) Riders In The Sky.\" And though the track list is stacked with country stars, there's a few gems to enjoy by hitmakers from other genres, too, including Benson Boone (\"Death Wish Love\") and Leon Bridges (\"Chrome Cowgirl\").\n\nAlessia Cara — \"Dead Man\"\n\nIt's been two years since we last heard from Alessia Cara, but she's ready to begin her next chapter. The GRAMMY winner unveils \"Dead Man,\" the lead single from her forthcoming fourth album — and if the kiss-off track is any indication, Cara's in her fearless era.\n\nBacked by crisp drums and harmonious saxophones, \"Dead Man\" is an edgy ode to someone she's cutting off because he's no longer serving her. \"If you really care, then why am I feeling you just slipping through my hands?,\" she questions in the chorus. \"If you're really there, then why can I walk right through ya?/ Talkin' to a dead man.\"\n\nJames Bay feat. Noah Kahan & The Lumineers — \"Up All Night\"\n\nIn the folk-pop collaboration that dreams are made of, James Bay teams up with longtime friend Noah Kahan and genre giants The Lumineers for \"Up All Night.\" The track boasts a vibrant instrumental layered beneath the harmonious blend of each artists' vocals — a perfect soundtrack for warm, starry summer nights.\n\nThe week \"Up All Night\" arrives also marks a full-circle tour moment for Kahan and Bay. Five years after Kahan first opened for Bay on the \"Let It Go\" singer's Electric Light Tour in 2019, Bay is now opening for Kahan — at New York City's Madison Square Garden and Boston's Fenway Park, no less — on the We'll All Be Here Forever Tour.\n\nSueco — 'Attempted Lover'\n\nAfter four years and two projects with Atlantic Records, Sueco unveils his first independently released studio album, Attempted Lover. Across 12 tracks, the L.A. native delves into the complexities of love and relationships, while navigating the tangled emotions that accompany these themes.\n\nSueco set the stage back in March with the project's lead single, \"Drama Queen\" — a raw, high-energy track that drew in both new and loyal listeners. He soon followed up with \"Mulholland Drive,\" a stripped-down acoustic gem, showcasing the impressive range of musical styles that Attempted Lover has to offer.\n\nIn celebration of the release, Sueco will embark on the Attempted Lover Tour in Sept. 13, kicking things off in Ft. Lauderdale, Florida, and hitting 32 cities in North America until Nov. 2.\n\nKALEO — \"USA Today\"\n\nDuring a short break from their Payback Tour, KALEO is back with new music — and making a statement and an impact with their latest release.\n\nThe rock band deliver the emotionally charged \"USA Today,\" a reflection on gun violence in America. Though frontman JJ Julius Son first wrote the track in 2019 with Shawn Everett and Eddie Spear, he felt compelled to release the track after an innocent bystander was killed during the attempted assassination of Donald Trump on July 13.\n\n\"So here we are/ Fighting for america/ Fighting for a new day/ Trying hard to change/ USA today,\" Son sings over gritty guitar riffs and dark synths. KALEO invites listeners to join the movement, pledging to donate a portion of the proceeds from the song to the gun violence advocacy group Everytown.\n\n\"USA Today\" is the second track KALEO released from their forthcoming fourth album, which is due later this year; it follows the acoustic lead single, \"Lonely Cowboy.\"\n\nAvery Anna — 'Breakup Over Breakfast'\n\nAfter being named an Artist to Watch by Amazon Music, Pandora, Spotify, and CMT in 2023, country newcomer Avery Anna further displays her promise and prowess with her debut album, Breakup Over Breakfast. The Arizona native co-wrote all 17 tracks on the project, including standout track \"girl next door,\" a powerful ballad that puts Anna's golden vocals on display.\n\n\"These songs mean the world to me. It's a little bit of rock, country, acoustic, pop, and everything personal,\" the singer/songwriter wrote in an Instagram post. \"I really wanted to give you guys an album that you can confide in. I carefully chose the songs and track listing, and creating it was an adrenaline rush / a relief all at the same time.\"\n\nRole Model — 'Kansas Anymore'\n\nWith his 2022 debut album, Rx, Role Model dove deeply into themes of love. Two years later, the rising bedroom pop star offers a different take on that same topic, grieving the very relationship that inspired Rx with Kansas Anymore.\n\nAlong with offering a different take on love and relationships, Role Model's latest effort is also inspired by his longing for his native state of Maine. Drawing inspiration from artists like Zach Bryan, the War on Drugs and Caamp, Kansas Anymore chronicles Role Model journeys back home, attempting to fill the void created by leaving his East Coast roots for California. The project represents a mature step forward, navigating the rollercoaster of heartbreak and homesickness — and moving listeners in the process.\n\nJoe Jonas — \"Work It Out\"\n\nSince releasing his first solo album, Fastlife, in 2011, Joe Jonas has been plenty busy, from landing a megahit with his pop-rock group DNCE to bringing back the Jonas Brothers with his siblings Nick and Kevin. Thirteen years later, the singer makes a solo comeback with \"Work It Out,\" the bouncy lead single from his sophomore solo album, Music for People Who Believe in Love, due Oct. 18.\n\n\"This album is a celebration of gratitude, hope, and love. These songs reflect on my life from a bird's-eye-view acknowledging the many blessings around me,\" Jonas shared on Instagram, referencing both his own experiences as an individual and as a recent father of two. \"I hope it brings you as much joy as it brought me creating it.\"\n\nLatest News & Exclusive Videos\n\nWith Her 'Winter's Diary' Return, Tink Is Ready To Rep For \"The Girls Going Through It\"\n\nNew Music Friday: Listen To New Songs From ATEEZ & G-Eazy, Shawn Mendes, Latto, & More\n\nWatch Alanis Morissette Win At The 1999 GRAMMYs\n\nDancehall Legend Spice Reflects On 'Mirror 25,' Her Near-Death Experience & Owning Her Own Vision\n\nThe Recording Academy Philly Chapter Celebrates 30 Years With An Inaugural Block Party & Fireside Chat With Tierra Whack"
