        "text": "Newport Folk Festival 2024\n\nThis slideshow requires JavaScript.\n\nOnce again, the Newport Folk Festival, which celebrated its 65th anniversary took place on the last weekend of July. Since 2008, when Executive Producer George Wein hired Jay Sweet as an associate, the festival has been revitalized. Although folk purists questioned Sweet’s moves it is undeniable the festival has returned to its former glory. The festival, located at the scenic Fort Adams, in Newport, Rhode Island has brought together a multigenerational body of musicians and fans. Since Jay Sweet’s move to Executive Director, the festival has sold out each weekend since 2014. The limited number of tickets, capped off at 10,000, are gone within minutes even though no performers are announced. The saying goes “In Jay we trust.” The beauty of this feat is that fans are attending the festival, they are not attending to see a specific band, thus fans are open to experiencing a band they may have never heard of.\n\nThroughout the weekend I was introduced to bands I was unfamiliar with and have now begun to deep dive into their catalog. Canadian folk singer William Prince based in Winnipeg was awarded this year’s John Prine Fellowship award. Prince’s lyrics are simultaneously serious and funny, much like Prine.\n\nWednesday, based out of Asheville, North Carolina have been described as shoegaze and country, the storytelling of country but LOUD. I was unsurprised when Karly Hartzman’s ceaseless screaming during their final ditty scared the small children sitting next to me so much they began wailing themselves. But don’t let this dissuade you, their Tiny Desk concert is a great introduction to the band. Petey began releasing music while attending Loyola University in New Orleans. Attentive lyrics with millennial wit played on an acoustic guitar makes this songwriter so relatable.\n\nJon Middleton and Sierra Lundy from Victoria, B.C., Canada, make up Ocie Elliott. The band’s captivating intricate harmonies connected with the festival’s audience. Reyna Tropical’s music takes influence from traditional Latin American and African rhythms and musical styles. Her set had a rhythmic tropical feel which was pleasing to the ears.\n\nBy far my favorite discovery was Chaparelle. The band, out of Austin, Texas and centered around Zella Day and her romantic partner Jesse Woods have to date only released the song “Bleeding Hearts.” Their set was heavy on authentic Texas honky tonk. I’m looking forward to their future.\n\nSince Jay Sweet’s tenure the definition of folk music has been questioned and expanded. Up until this year’s festival rap and punk, which I strongly regard as today’s modern folk music, had never fully been represented. That changed this year. Sweet didn’t go light. He brought some heavy hitters. The Dropkick Murphys are a celtic punk band from Quincy, Massachusetts whose influences include The Pogues, The Clash, and The Ramones. The band is not unfamiliar with traditional folk music. In 2022 the band released This Machine Still Kills Fascists, their first fully acoustic album which featured ten songs with unused lyrics written by Woody Gutherie. The band’s set began with the raucous “The Boys Are Back”. The band asked if there were any Massholes in the audience and broke into “The State of Massachusetts.” The set included Woody Gutherie songs, a guest appearance by Billy Bragg on “Worker’s Song” and the band’s infamous anthem “Shipping UpTo Boston.”\n\nKiller Mike represented the rap genre. Besides being a hardcore rapper, Killer Mike is a community activist working to promote social equality, and the end of police brutality, and systemic racism. The Atlanta based rapper flanked by gospel singers arrived to the stage clad in all white. Killer Mike did not temper his performance for the festival. The hour-long performance was nothing like Newport had ever seen. Killer Mike shared stories about drug dealers, the struggles of single mothers, and the adversity of growing up Black in America. His raps were chock-full of f and n bombs that would have burnt off the ears of the festival’s pioneers. By the end of his set it wasn’t a question of if Killer Mike and rap belonged at Newport. The question was why he wasn’t invited earlier.\n\nOf course, the weekend was full of performances by artists fans were more familiar with. Hozier’s set was highlighted by guest appearances by Mavis Staples and Joan Baez on “The Weight.” Gillian Welch and David Rawlings treated the crowd to “Caleb Meyer,” “Revelator,” and “Everything Is Free” along with selections of their upcoming album Woodland. Sierra Ferrell played a nine song captivating set. Dressed in a yellow antebellum hoop skirt, Ferrell sang, played guitar, and fiddle. Highlights included “Dollar Bill Bar,” “Foxhunt” and “Me and Bobby McGee.” The set also included guests John C. Rielly on “Heartaches By The Number” and Gillian Welch on “Handsome Molly.”\n\nFormer Alabama Shakes lead singer Brittany Howard gave bluesy rock performances of “Stay High,” “Baby,” and “Georgia.” Joan Baez was a finalist for the “Jim James Award,” informally given out to the artist appearing the most times during the festival. The veteran folkie was all over the festival, giving poetry readings, dancing onstage with Rhiannon Giddens, and watching KIller Mike’s performance while sitting side stage. The festival concluded with an uneven Conan O’Brian and Friends set. The comedian’s jokes sometimes fell flat and Triumph The Insult Comic Dog was simply annoying. Musical guest appearances by Brittany Howard, Nathaniel Rateliff, Langhorne Slim, Jack White, Nick Lowe, and Mavis Staples made up for any missteps within the set. The festival concluded with a singalong to “Midnight Special” with additional performers from throughout the weekend.\n\nThe 2024 Newport Folk Festival continues to be one of the most diverse concerts of the season. Dates for the 2025 festival have yet to be released. Tickets will certainly go on sale and sell out within minutes without a single artist being announced. Visit the festival website and sign up for updates to learn about the dates of next year’s festival and on sale date."
