It was released on October 19, 1979, by Warner Bros. Records. The album was written, arranged, composed, produced and performed entirely by Prince. Overall, Prince was regarded as more diverse than For You (1978), and performed better critically and commercially. Reviewing in Christgau's Record Guide: Rock Albums of the Seventies (1981), Robert Christgau wrote: \"This boy is going to be a big star, and he deserves it\".[3]\n\nPrince peaked at 22 on the Billboard 200 and number three on the Billboard R&B Chart. The album contained three Billboard Hot Black Singles hits: \"Why You Wanna Treat Me So Bad?\", \"Sexy Dancer\" and \"I Wanna Be Your Lover\". \"I Wanna Be Your Lover\" was Prince's first hit single on the Billboard Hot 100, peaking at number eleven while also topping the Billboard Hot Black Singles. Prince was certified Platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) four months after its release.[4]\n\nBackground\n\n[edit]\n\nThe album was written, arranged, composed, produced and performed entirely by Prince.[5] On the album credits, Prince thanks his bassist André Cymone and drummer Bobby Z. as \"heaven-sent helpers\".[6]\n\nPrince recorded the album in five weeks,[5] after Warner Bros. asked for a follow-up to his 1978 debut, For You. Prince had used twice his initial recording advance on that album, and it had failed to generate a pop hit (although \"Soft and Wet\" became a No. 12 R&B hit). Displeased at his lack of success, Prince quickly recorded the follow-up.\n\n2019\n\n[edit]\n\nOn October 19, 2019, Prince's estate released an acoustic demo version of \"I Feel for You\"[7] as a single to celebrate the 40th anniversary of the Prince album release.\n\nCritical reception\n\n[edit]\n\nProfessional ratingsReview scoresSourceRatingAllMusic[1]Blender[8]Christgau's Record GuideB+[3]Entertainment WeeklyB−[9]The Guardian[10]MusicHound Rock4/5[11]Q[12]Rolling Stone(favorable)[13]The Rolling Stone Album Guide[14]Smash Hits5/10[15]\n\nOverall, the album was much more diverse and well-received than For You, critically and commercially, selling three million copies. It is notable for containing standard R&B ballads performed by Prince, before he would go on to establish himself with sexual romps on later albums. The album was certified platinum and contained three R&B/dance hits: \"Why You Wanna Treat Me So Bad?\", \"Sexy Dancer\" and \"I Wanna Be Your Lover.\" \"I Wanna Be Your Lover\" sold over one million copies and received a gold disc, rushing to No. 11 on the Billboard Hot 100 (becoming Prince's first hit single) and topped the R&B charts. In addition, it peaked at No. 41 in the United Kingdom (his first entry in the country) and reached number 2 on the Billboard Dance/Disco Singles chart. Prince performed both \"I Wanna Be Your Lover\" and \"Why You Wanna Treat Me So Bad?\" on American Bandstand on 26 January 1980. Overall, the success of this album geared Prince towards his next album, Dirty Mind, which would be called a complete departure from his earlier sound.\n\nReviewing in Christgau's Record Guide: Rock Albums of the Seventies (1981), Robert Christgau wrote: \"This boy is going to be a big star, and he deserves it—he's got a great line. 'I want to come inside you' is good enough, but (in a different song) the simple 'I'm physically attracted to you' sets new standards of 'naive,' winning candor. The vulnerable teen-macho falsetto idea is pretty good too. But he does leave something to be desired in the depth-of-feeling department—you know, soul.\"[3]\n\nTrack listing\n\n[edit]\n\nSingles\n\n[edit]\n\n\"I Wanna Be Your Lover\" b/w \"My Love Is Forever\" (US number 11, US R&B number 1, US Dance number 2, UK number 41)\n\n\"Why You Wanna Treat Me So Bad?\" b/w \"Baby\" (US R&B number 13)\n\n\"Still Waiting\" b/w \"Bambi\" (US R&B number 65)\n\n\"Sexy Dancer\" b/w \"Bambi\"/\"Why You Wanna Treat Me So Bad?\" (UK and Japan Only US Dance number 2)\n\nPersonnel\n\n[edit]\n\nPrince – lead and backing vocals, electric and acoustic guitars, Oberheim 4-Voice, Polymoog, Minimoog, ARP String Ensemble, clavinet, Yamaha CP-70 electric grand piano, piano, Fender Rhodes electric piano, bass guitar, drums, Pollard Syndrums, percussion, producer, arranger, remixer\n\nAndré Cymone – backing vocals (2) (uncredited)\n\nTechnical\n\nGary Brandt – engineer\n\nMark Ettel – assistant engineer\n\nBob Mockler – remixer\n\nBernie Grundman – mastering (A&M)\n\nLynn Barron – album design (RIA Images)\n\nGeorge Chacon – album design (RIA Images)\n\nJurgen Reisch – photography (front cover)\n\nChris Callis – photography (back cover)\n\nTerry Taylor – calligraphy\n\nCharts\n\n[edit]\n\nCertifications\n\n[edit]\n\nCertifications for Prince Region Certification Certified units/sales United Kingdom (BPI)[22] Silver 60,000^ United States (RIAA)[23] Platinum 1,000,000^ Summaries Worldwide — 1,700,000[24]\n\n^ Shipments figures based on certification alone.\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]"
