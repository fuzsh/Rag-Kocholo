        "text": "Throughout 1980s there was a renaissance occurring within music, one which stretched throughout all genres be it pop, rock, country, electronica or hip-hop. The fact so many world renowned artists and hit songs came out of the decade speaks to the artistic phenomenon that was taking place at the time. Since the 1980s there has arguably not been another decade that has had the same drastic amount of innovation across all music genres.\n\nTo put matters simply, nearly every popularized contemporary music genre was considered to be at its peak throughout the decade. Whether it was with Michael Jackson’s pop magnum opus, Thriller, or Metallica’s heavy metal masterpiece Master of Puppets, the list goes on but the sheer number of genre defining works that were released during the decade is a feat that’s still yet to be rivaled.\n\nTop 80s Songs\n\nWhile many artists across a multitude of genres — including new wave, alt-rock, electronic dance, heavy metal and pop — were all taken into account when comprising this list, the following songs have made a significant impact on the genres they inhabit and pop culture all together. Furthermore, the songs showcased have remained timeless works from decade they were released in, which ultimately makes them considered some of the 80s best songs.\n\n50. “Let’s Groove” by Earth, Wind & Fire (1981)\n\nAlthough Disco and funk were largely the face of the 70s music scene, Earth, Wind & Fire has stood the test of time and “Let’s Groove” is a prime example of how the band has managed to do so. The band’s iconic song is showcased throughout pop-culture today much like their 70s hit “September,” as both songs are routinely used in film, TV, and celebrated throughout media.\n\n49. “Head Like A Hole” by Nine Inch Nails (1989)\n\nReleasing at the tail end of the 1980s, Trent Reznor’s Nine Inch Nails would make its monumental debut with Pretty Hate Machine and most notably the single “Head Like A Hole.” While much of the group’s critical success and rise to popularity occurred throughout the 90’s and early 2000s, “Head Like A Hole” has remained a massively influential song in the rock genre and an early example of Reznor’s ingenious producing and songwriting capabilities.\n\n48. “Just Like Heaven” by The Cure (1987)\n\nThe gothic rock and post-punk scenes flourished throughout the 1980s, largely as a result of The Cure becoming such a sensationalized act during the decade. Many of the band’s hits were spread out across the late 70s, 80s and even early 90s, but “Just Like Heaven” has remained one their most celebrated love songs and a classic in the goth rock and post-punk genres.\n\n47. “Never Gonna Give You Up” by Rick Astley (1987)\n\nRegardless of its association within “meme culture” with the popularized ‘Rickroll’ gag, Rick Astley’s “Never Gonna Give You Up” has remained every bit as delightful and iconic over the years. “Rickrolling” has certainly helped boost the song’s notoriety but from the song’s instrumentation and Astley’s punchy melodic voice, it’s remained a classic of 80s pop music. While it’s Astley’s only massive hit, few artists from the 80s have managed to stay as relevant as he has with one iconic song.\n\n46. “Fight For Your Right” by Beastie Boys (1986)\n\nTaking the world by storm with the their revolutionary take on the hip-hop and rock genres, the Beastie Boys flourished in the late 80s with their genre bending debut LP Licensed To Ill. Their single “Fight For Your Right” has remained an essential hype anthem over the years, and is routinely a formidable gateway into aggressive music genres.\n\n45. “Raining Blood” by Slayer (1986)\n\nMetal would not be the expansive genre that it is without Slayer, specifically their groundbreaking 1986 album Reign In Blood. The similarly named track off the record, “Raining Blood,” has become synonymous with thrash metal and the band altogether, and it’s easily the defining song of the band and the extreme metal genre.\n\n44. “How Soon Is Now?” by The Smiths (1984)\n\nMuch of the Indie and alternative rock sub-genres would simply not exist without The Smiths contributions, and while the group had a number of hits throughout the 80s, nothing quite encapsulates their elegant swagger like “How Soon Is Now?” Right from the tremolo guitar riff to Morrissey’s haunting vocal melodies, “How Soon Is Now?” is the band in their most brilliant sonic form.\n\n43. “Where Is My Mind?” by Pixies (1988)\n\nThe quirky twisted melancholy of The Pixies was way ahead of its time for 1988, and the band’s hit single “Where Is My Mind?” perfectly showcases these aspects. For its oversimplified instrumentation “Where Is My Mind?” achieves so much and more which is why it’s managed to stay relevant with a multitude of generations and it’s continued success proves that band’s sonic brilliance is one of kind.\n\n42. “Uptown Girl” by Billy Joel (1983)\n\nThis multi-platinum single from Billy Joel is still his most recognizable and successful hit over 40 years later. More than any of his massive hits and high-charting records, “Uptown Girl” has won over audiences for its uncanny joyful anthemic qualities which are a signature part of Joel’s unique approach to songwriting.\n\n41. “Hysteria” by Def Leppard (1987)\n\nThis power ballad from hard rock’s Def Leppard is no less mesmerizing than when it first hit the scene in 1987. Wielding a riff that has since been copied and revamped by countless other rock groups, Def Leppard proved they’re far more than just a formidable hard rock band with “Hysteria.”\n\n40. “Down Under” by Men At Work (1981)\n\nAustralian new wave rock outfit Men At Work unleashed their global sensation “Down Under” in the early 80s and it’s since become one of the most notable gems of the decade. While it’s the groups most renown and popularized hit by a large margin, Men At Work still contributed heavily to the sonic influences that came out of the 80s which has since seeped into much of modern music today.\n\n39. “Tainted Love” by Soft Cell (1981)\n\nSoft Cell had a few noteworthy hits throughout the 80s but nothing comes close to their spiced up rendition of Ed Cobb’s “Tainted Love.” By comparison to their other successes “Tainted Love” is very much a one-hit wonder for Soft Cell, but nonetheless its popularity throughout the decade and beyond has earned the group one of the most iconic songs of the decade.\n\n38. “Danger Zone” by Kenny Loggins (1986)\n\nRiding off the success for his theme for the 1984 film Footloose, Kenny Loggins upped the intensity with his next cinematic hit with “Danger Zone” from the Top Gun soundtrack. Following the recent success of Top Gun Maverick, “Danger Zone” has marked itself as Loggins’ all time greatest work and another timeless classic from the decade.\n\n37. “Back In Black” by AC/DC (1980)\n\nThere’s a litany of reasons for why AC/DC’s Back In Black is hailed as one of the greatest rock albums of all time, and the album’s title track is certainly one of them. At the time singer Brian Johnson was the new face of the band, but given how seamlessly he fit into the band’s sound and aesthetic makes this song a legendary rock anthem, along with top guitarist Angus Young’s irrefutably catchy riffs.\n\n36. “Blue Monday” by New Order (1983)\n\nStanding as one of the most seminal electronic-pop songs to ever be recorded, New Order’s “Blue Monday” not only established new precedents for electronic music in the 80s, but the song has since managed to traverse through the following decades cementing it as an all-time classic. While the group has a handful of other noteworthy hits, nothing has quite had the same impact on contemporary music like “Blue Monday.”\n\n35. “Walk This Way (feat. Aerosmith)” by RUN D.M.C. (1986)\n\nBreaking musical boundaries by amalgamating both hip-hop and rock genres, Run D.M.C.’s take on Aerosmith’s already iconic song “Walk This Way” gave the composition an unprecedented glow up and opened doors to new sonic possibilities in music. Largely from the group’s success throughout the 80s, particularly with this song, RUN D.M.C are routinely cited as one of the most important groups in hip-hop.\n\n34. “Ace of Spades” by Motörhead\n\nThe Heavy Metal outfit lead by frontman Lemmy Kilmister have remained one of the single most influential rock bands from the late 70s and early 80s. “Ace Of Spades,” the title track off Motörhead’s 1980 record, is still their most highly regarded and popularized track, as it fully captures the essence and allure of what made the band and frontman Lemmy so remarkably fascinating.\n\n33. “Hungry Like The Wolf” by Duran Duran (1982)\n\nThe British New Wave group wouldn’t have been such a viral sensation throughout 80s without their hit, “Hungry Like The Wolf.” Many of the quirky pop antics and grooves made famous by Duran Duran contributed heavily to the sounds of the decade, and even much of modern pop music. With the popularity of “Hungry Like The Wolf” the band has seemingly been able to traverse through the 80s as one of Britain’s most admonished acts.\n\n32. “Sweet Dreams” by Eurythmics (1983)\n\nFew songs instantly perk the ears right from their start like Eurythmics’ “Sweet Dreams.” The pouncing synths and the haunting vocals have made it the duos most recognizable piece and it’s become one of the most formidable pop songs ever written.\n\n31. “The Number of the Beast” by Iron Maiden (1982)\n\nNo other metal band has epic dueling guitar leads and sing-along choruses quite like Iron Maiden does, and their influence on the genre is as far reaching as their lengthy discography suggests. However, “The Number Of The Beast,” is the fuse that set the band off in the trajectory that they’ve since reached as one of the metal genre’s most revered and legendary bands.\n\n30. “Total Eclipse of the Heart” by Bonnie Tyler (1983)\n\nThe rollercoaster that is Bonnie Tyler’s “Total Eclipse of the Heart” is unmistakable from its somber beginning to climactic and uplifting chorus. Welsh singer Bonnie Tyler would go on to have a few of hits throughout the decade, but nothing has outmatched the success she’s seen from “Total Eclipse of the Heart.”\n\n29. “Breaking the Law” by Judas Priest (1980)\n\nThe souring lead guitars and screeching vocals of heavy metal pioneers Judas Priest have remained a formidable influence amongst many of the metal genre’s most successful bands. However, Judas Priest’s classic “Breaking the Law” continues to be one of the few cases where they managed to break through the mainstream with their spiked heavy metal swagger.\n\n28. “Should I Stay or Should I Go” by The Clash (1981)\n\nAs part of the first wave of British punk The Clash’s imprint on contemporary punk rock stretches far and wide especially compared to other like-minded outfits from the same era. The bands undeniable hooks are clearly what have made them stand out even after all of these years, with their multiplatinum single “Should I Stay or Should I Go” being a prime example of their knack for catchy punk songwriting.\n\n27. “Straight Outta Compton” by N.W.A. (1988)\n\nThe seminal rap group changed the face of music production and paved the way for the gangsta rap genre with their debut, Straight Outta Compton. The title track still reverberates the same visceral attitude and intensity which the group laid down decades ago, which is why it’s routinely celebrated and influential to this day.\n\n26. “What’s Love Got to Do with It” by Tina Turner (1984)\n\nThe “Queen of Rock,” Tina Turner, was undoubtedly at her peak in the 80s having a plethora of pop-rock hits and ground breaking live performances. However, her single “What’s Love Got to Do with It” is still the her most exemplary work and the song that’s made her a household name within pop-culture.\n\n25. “Don’t You (Forget About Me)” by Simple Minds (1985)\n\nAfter finding success from its appearance in the hit coming of age film The Breakfast Club, Simple Minds’ “Don’t You (Forget About Me)” would establish itself as the group’s most popular and beloved song of their career. The instrumentation and infectious performances on “Don’t You (Forget About Me)” only showcase why Simple Minds would go on to have one of the most successful careers of any U.K. band from the decade, thus making the song a definitive piece from the 80s.\n\n24. “Running Up That Hill (A Deal With God)” - Kate Bush (1985)\n\nPut simply, with the success of Netflix’s Stranger Things, Kate Bush’s already successful career was emboldened thanks to the TV show’s use of her hit single “Running Up That Hill (A Deal With God).” The song has introduced an entire generation of new fans to the British pop star, and it has since made her a significant part of the 80s’ sonic appeal to whole new generation.\n\n23. “Crazy Train” by Ozzy Osbourne (1980)\n\nThe Prince of Darkness, Ozzy Osbourne, made one of the most impressionable debuts from any solo rock artist thanks to the international sensation “Crazy Train.” While Osbourne’s rabid personality and melodies lifted the song, the true hero of this hard rock anthem is guitarist Randy Rhoads whose musicianship and performance is still so highly regarded to this day.\n\n22. “In The Air Tonight” by Phil Collins (1981)\n\nBoasting what is quite possibly the most famous drum fill of all time, Phil Collins’ “In The Air Tonight” has time and again instilled itself as one of pop-rock’s most popularized singles. The song marked the debut of Collins’ solo career after leaving Genesis, and took off to even greater heights in the following years, though “In The Air Tonight” has remained the singer’s most successful track to date.\n\n21. “Panama” by Van Halen (1984)\n\nWhile “Jump” is the band’s most commercially successful hit to date, it was less representative of Van Halen’s true rock prowess at the time, which arguably is what “Panama” showcased. As one of the band’s most catchy and popularized tracks, “Panama” is still routinely played and hailed as one of greatest rock anthems ever written and it’s an exemplary song from the revered rock titans.\n\n20. “Dancing In the Dark” by Bruce Springsteen (1984)\n\n“The Boss” Bruce Springsteen saw huge international success with the releases of his 1984 opus, Born In the USA. The number of hits curated from this record is an achievement in its own right, but “Dancing In the Dark” has to be Springsteen’s single greatest work as a songwriter during the decade, and its continued popularity speaks to the timeless quality Springsteen was able to capture.\n\n19. “Free Fallin’” by Tom Petty (1989)\n\nTom Petty’s solo album debuted to much critical praise at the time of its release in the late 80s, and given the number of incredible songs on the record it’s easy to understand why it was such a smashing success. However, “Free Fallin’” has remained his most popular song from his solo album, and it’s arguably his best song from the decade and possibly entire career.\n\n18. “Just Can’t Get Enough” by Depeche Mode (1981)\n\nDespite Depeche Mode’s opus being their 1990 LP Violator, the band was no less significant throughout the 1980s, having a number massive hits including “Just Can’t Get Enough.” The song glimmers with 80s nostalgia from with its iconic synth leads and gleeful chorus melodies. There’s a plethora of amazing Depeche Mode songs throughout the decade, but “Just Can’t Get Enough” remains one of the groups most popularized to date, and furthermore one of the most defining songs of the 1980s.\n\n17. “Rebel Yell” by Billy Idol (1983)\n\nBilly Idol sonically encompasses a lot of what was amazing about the 80s from hard hitting rock, frenetic pop choruses and an innovative use of synthesizers, all of which are present on his anthemic hit “Rebel Yell.” This song among several of Idol’s hits are routinely spun by a number of generations, and he’s still largely seen as one of the most prominent faces of 80s rock.\n\n16. “Girls Just Want To Have Fun” by Cyndi Lauper (1983)\n\nCyndi Lauper’s “Girls Just Want To Have Fun” has remained an absolute classic since its inception. Given its continued widespread popularity there’s no denying the impact the song has had on a multitude of generations and a plethora of other likeminded artists, especially throughout the 1980s.\n\n15. “I Wanna Dance With Somebody” by Whitney Houston (1987)\n\nFew solo artists have seen the same multi-decade success that Whitney Houston achieved in her career. While her career would peak in the 90s for her work on The Bodyguard soundtrack, her 1987 single “I Wanna Dance With Somebody” cemented her as one of the 80s’ most revered vocalists and rising pop stars.\n\n14. “Every Breath You Take” by The Police (1983)\n\nRight from the beginning snap of the snare drum listeners instantly recognize the Police’s legendary single, “Every Breath You Take.” Few songs have that unique ability to be so quickly recognizable which further speaks to the songs achievements and mesmerizing qualities, not to mention The Police’s astounding musicianship showcased on the track.\n\n13. “Sweet Child O’ Mine” by Guns N’ Roses (1987)\n\nThe sonic brilliance of the 1980s wouldn’t be what it was without the masterpiece that was Guns N’ Roses debut, Appetite For Destruction. As one of the highest selling and acclaimed rock records, it’s difficult to pick the best GNR song but “Sweet Child O’ Mine” has remained unanimously loved since it’s inception, deeming it the right choice. Furthermore, nearly every element of the band shines bright on this track, highlighting why Guns N’ Roses have remained so iconic after all of these years.\n\n12. “With Or Without You” by U2 (1987)\n\nThe Irish alternative rock pioneers U2 paved the way for many of modern rock and pop music’s most famed artists, and their 1987 album The Joshua Tree is what greatly contributed to them having such a far reaching popularity. “With Or Without You” is still the most popular single from the record, and the band’s most recognizable hit to date. At the time of its release it earned the band their first No.1 charting hit on the U.S. billboard charts.\n\n11. “Don’t Stop Believin’” by Journey (1983)\n\nFew contemporary songs infect listeners with the urge to the sing along and rejoice like Journey’s global hit, “Don’t Stop Believin’.” Even with dozens of hits and multi-platinum records, “Don’t Stop Believein’” has remained the band’s most renown and viral song to date and by a large margin.\n\n10. “Livin’ On A Prayer” by Bon Jovi (1986)\n\nBon Jovi’s hits never fall short on their anthemic appeal, in fact of all 80s rock bands Bon Jovi might have the most crowd pleasing rock anthems with “Livin’ On A Prayer” being their most iconic. The sheer number of hits to come out of their 1986 LP Slippery When Wet is overwhelming, but the continued recognition of “Livin’ On A Prayer” makes it the group’s best.\n\n9. “Like A Virgin” by Madonna (1984)\n\nThe provocative and alluring qualities of Madonna’s music and persona were groundbreaking at the time and it certainly played a huge part to her success in the 80s. “Like A Virgin” just so happens to be the song that best showcases these aspects, and when it was released the song wasn’t without its controversies, but it’s remained one of her defining pieces and a true gem from the decade.\n\n8. “Take On Me” by a-ha (1985)\n\nThe synthesizer is without a doubt one of the defining features of 80s music — that and the exceptional vocal melodies that are often paired with it, which a-ha expertly capture on their global sensation, “Take On Me.” With a soaring chorus that insists the listener hum along and give their best attempt at singing in falsetto, “Take On Me” is a one hit wonder that few artists have come even close to achieving.\n\n7. “Under Pressure” by Queen And David Bowie (1982)\n\nWhile both Queen and David Bowie had a variety of acclaimed records and hit singles throughout the 80s, their collaboration together on “Under Pressure” is up there with their greatest works ever recorded. Both Bowie and Queen captured lightning in a bottle on “Under Pressure,” and the poignant and heartfelt themes the on song are what have carried it throughout the following decades and cemented it as an all time classic.\n\n6. “Careless Whisper” by Wham! (1984)\n\nWielding the single greatest saxophone line of all time, George Michael and Andrew Wrigley’s “Careless Whisper” is the pinnacle of sexy and suave in musical form. Although the single appeared on Wham!’s second studio album (as Andrew Wrigley helped compose the song) George Michael is largely seen as the song’s creator, with the single being under his name in the U.K. and Europe. George Michael’s solo career hasn’t seen as a big hit as “Careless Whisper” and the fact it’s been covered by several other noteworthy artists throughout the following decades helps establish it as a timeless song.\n\n5. “Master of Puppets” by Metallica (1986)\n\nAs the most popularized metal group in the world, Metallica’s rise within pop-culture has been a steady exponential journey ever since their formation in 1981. However, in recent years their already iconic heavy hit “Master Of Puppets” would surpass itself as a metal opus and become one of the most popularized songs from 1980s, in part due to a new generation discovering the classic from the popularized Netflix series Stranger Things.\n\n4. “Everybody Wants To Rule The World” by Tears For Fears (1985)\n\nTears For Fears contributed to a handful of the 80s most universally acclaimed and beloved songs, but “Everybody Wants To Rule The World” is the song that’s defined their entire career and legacy as a group. The song’s Cold War themes have not only remained relevant throughout the following decades but its general messaging and the way in which Tears For Fears so uniquely arranged this masterpiece is timeless.\n\n3. “Africa” by TOTO (1982)\n\nThe sheer number of phenomenal hits TOTO penned and individually helped contribute towards as session musicians is beyond overwhelming. As a band however, “Africa” remains their most accessible and significant piece to date, provided its wholesome and mesmerizing qualities, not to mention its irrefutably catchy groove.\n\n2. “Thriller” by Michael Jackson (1982)\n\nThe 80s wouldn’t have been the musical renaissance that it was without the King of Pop, Michael Jackson. Given the sheer number of hits Jackson had throughout the decade, it’s difficult to pick his best, but “Thriller” showcases the pop star in all his best elements from the legendary dance moves seen in the music video to Jackson’s mesmerizing and frenetic vocal performance.\n\n1. “Purple Rain” by Prince (1984)\n\nPrince’s masterpiece Purple Rain solidified him as one of the greatest songwriters and producers in contemporary music, and the album’s title track encapsulates much of his oneness that’s heard throughout the record. “Purple Rain” is still one of the strongest ballads ever written from a rock and pop standpoint, and to this day Prince still manages to captivate listeners with this near nine-minute opus, which is a feat on its own.\n\nBottom Line"
