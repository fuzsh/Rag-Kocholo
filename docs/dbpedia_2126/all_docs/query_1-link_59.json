        "text": "Peter Vincent, The Sydney Morning Herald, April 24, 2016\n\nAs a songwriter he penned mega hits for himself (five US No.1s: When Doves Cry, Let’s Go Crazy, Kiss, Cream and Batdance, plus 13 other top 10 songs) and for others (Nothing Compares 2 U, sung by Sinead O’Connor, also topped the Billboard 100, while the Bangles’ Manic Monday made No.2 and Chaka Khan’s I Feel For You was No.3).\n\nBut on the available evidence it seems one song stood above them all, at least for Prince as a live artist.\n\nIt was the song he sang far more than any other in concert – 1005 times, a huge 247 times more than his second-most played song, Kiss. It was also the final song he ever sang in concert, at Fox Theatre in Atlanta on April 14.\n\nIt was the title track to his semi-autobiographical movie and was much more than just a signature song, in many ways defined him. It is of course, Purple Rain.\n\nPicking Prince’s greatest song is a fun, and all but impossible exercise. So great was his body of work, from pop classics to cult classics that it’s hard to name one. Indeed our long-time music writer Bernard Zuel didn’t rate Purple Rain among Prince’s 10 best.\n\nIndeed Purple Rain may not be Prince’s lyrically most complex or musically dazzling song, in fact as a piece of songwriting it is disjointed, as it is essentially written in the voice of the kid, who is the lead character in the film Purple Rain. Each verse is reputedly sung about someone close to the kid.\n\nIt also doesn’t represent Prince’s funk soul; it isn’t as joyously, sexily snake-hipped as Sexy MF, Gett Off, or Dirty Mind. It’s not as connected to a moment in time as Sign of the Times or 1999. It’s not as poetic as When Doves Cry.\n\nBut something about Purple Rain makes it the perfect everyman and everywoman pop ballad: even the snobby music bible Pitchfork couldn’t resist Purple Rain, naming it the best song of the 1980s.\n\nSomething about Purple Rain still cuts very deep, despite thousands of plays across AM and FM radio over 32 years after its won an Oscar. Whether its the ache of love gone wrong (just sentimental enough) or the unashamedly bold mix of styles: it’s blend of pop ballad with rock and orchestral and finally gospel.\n\nArguably that “something” is what Prince sought to achieve in all his music. Asked by Larry King in 1999 to find an idiom to describe his music, Prince called it “inspirational”.\n\n“Music that is from the heart falls right into that category, people who really feel what it is that they’re doing.”\n\nAnyone who has seen Prince perform Purple Rain live so often (more times than the Rolling Stones sung I Can’t Get No (Satisfaction), or Bruce Springsteen sang Born in the USA) knows his commitment to the song, and it sounds obvious, but to the colour purple.\n\nPurple imbued Prince’s whole world, it surrounded him, and clearly inspired him: he made that clear by wearing it so often and fan and the media embraced it. How many headlines would refer to his “purple reign?” How many iconic buildings were lit up in purple? Even the Google search page turned purple for a day.\n\nHe dressed in the colour before Purple Rain and whenever he had a big stage, it was purple, like Miami’s Dolphin Stadium, venue for Super Bowl XLI in 2007, which he bathed in purple lights for what many consider the best half-time show. When Apollonia Kotero, the actress who stared opposite him in Purple Rain the movie, first met him “he smelled real good. Like purple,” she told Spin.\n\nPurple imbued Prince’s whole world, it surrounded him, and clearly inspired him: he made that clear by wearing it so often and fan and the media embraced it.

When Apollonia Kotero, the actress who stared opposite him in Purple Rain the movie, first met him “he smelled real good. Like purple,” she told Spin\n\nA big part of Prince’s conviction with Purple Rain undoubtedly lies in religion: purple is seen as a significant color in the bible, often associated with the sixth level of heaven, the highest a human could ascend.\n\nPurple is also the color of a sky wrought by destruction. In 1999, Prince sings: “when I woke up this mornin’, could’ve sworn it was judgment day / The sky was all purple, there were people runnin’ everywhere / Tryin’ to run from the destruction, you know I didn’t even care.”Alice Walker, author of The Color Purple, wrote: ‘I think it pisses God off if you walk by the color purple in a field somewhere and don’t notice it”. Fittingly, the cast of the Broadway production of The Color Purple, led by Jennifer Hudson, sang a soaring version of Purple Rain the day he died in tribute.\n\nThis much-shared quote from his purpleness shows he had judgment day on his mind: “When there’s blood in the sky – red and blue [equals] purple … purple rain pertains to the end of the world and being with the one you love and letting your faith/god guide you through the purple rain.”\n\nPurple is considered by some a sacred colour and often associated with royalty, status and ambition, probably because as a composite color (a combination of blue and red) it was expensive to make. It’s also associated with sexuality and creativity. Purple worked hard, like Prince himself, who put out a remarkable 39 studio albums.\n\nPrince was an avowed fan of the Minnesota Vikings NFL team, whose jerseys are mostly purple. So who really knows?\n\nIt may be ubiquitous, teetering towards the sentimental and even straying into religion, or the religion that is American football but Purple Rain remains one of pop’s finest and most enduring and affecting torch songs."
