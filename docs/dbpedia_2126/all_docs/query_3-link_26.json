        "text": "\"I strive for originality in my music,\" Prince declared in a 1985 interview with MTV. \"That was, and will always be the case.\"\n\nIt was this determination to do things his own inimitable way that birthed the decade's most audacious superstar project: Purple Rain.\n\nPrior to the album's June 25, 1984 release, Prince had scored some mainstream hits — including \"1999\" and \"Little Red Corvette\" — but hadn't fully blossomed into the prolific, world-conquering musical hero he's now immortalized as. Nor did he have acting experience. Yet, Prince somehow managed to convince his management and label into financing a big-screen hybrid of romance, drama and musical accompanied by an equally ambitious pop soundtrack.\n\nIt was an inherently risky career strategy that could have derailed the Purple One's remarkable rise to greatness in one fell swoop. Instead, Purple Rain enjoyed blockbuster success at both the box office and on the charts, with the film grossing more than $68 million worldwide and the album topping the Billboard 200 for a remarkable 24 weeks.\n\nInitially conceived as a double album featuring protege girl group Apollonia 6 and funk rock associates the Time, the Purple Rain OST worked as an entirely separate entity, too. In fact, it had already sold 2.5 million copies in the States before the movie hit theaters, largely thanks to the immediacy of lead single \"When Doves Cry,\" Prince's first ever Billboard Hot 100 No. 1.\n\nAnd a full 40 years on from its release, Purple Rain's diverse range of power ballads, hard rockers and party anthems still possess the power to stun, whether the phrase \"You have to purify yourself in the waters of Lake Minnetonka\" is familiar or not. Here's a look at why the GRAMMY-winning record — and 2010 GRAMMY Hall of Fame inductee — is regarded as such a trailblazer.\n\nIt Hopped Genres Like No Album Before\n\nWhile the streaming age has encouraged artists and listeners to embrace multiple genres, back in the 1980s, \"stay in your lane\" was the common mindset. Of course, a musician as versatile and innovative as Prince was never going to adhere to such a restriction.\n\nThe Purple One had already melded pop, soul, R&B, and dance to perfection on predecessor 1999. But on his magnum opus, the star took his sonic adventurism even further, flirting with neo-psychedelia, heavy metal and gospel on nine tracks which completely eschewed any form of predictability. Even its most mainstream number refused to play by the rules: despite its inherent funkiness, \"When Doves Cry\" is a rare chart-topper without any bass!\n\nAs you'd expect from such a virtuoso, Prince mastered every musical diversion taken. And the album's 25 million sales worldwide proved that audiences were more than happy to go along for the ride.\n\nIt Championed Female Talent On And Behind The Stage\n\nAlthough the likes of Jill Jones, Wendy Melvoin and Lisa Coleman had contributed to previous Prince albums, Purple Rain was the first time the Purple One pushed his female musical proteges to the forefront. On \"Take Me With U,\" he shares lead vocals with one of his most famous, Apollonia. On its accompanying tour, he invited Sheila E. to be his opening act. And in something of a rarity even still today, two of the soundtrack's engineers, Susan Rogers and Peggy McCreary, were women.\n\nMelvoin and Coleman would go on to become artists in their own right as Wendy and Lisa, of course. And Prince would also help to radically transform Sheena Easton from a demure balladeer into a pop vixen; compose hits by the Bangles (\"Manic Monday\"), Martika (\"Love Thy Will Be Done\"), and Sinead O'Connor (\"Nothing Compares 2 U\"); and provide career launchpads for Bria Valente and 3RDEYEGIRL.\n\nIt Broke Numerous Records\n\nAs well as pushing all kinds of boundaries, Purple Rain also broke all kinds of records, including one at the music industry's most prestigious night of the year. At the 1985 GRAMMY Awards, Prince became the first Black artist ever to win Best Rock Performance By A Duo Or Group With Vocal, beating the likes of the Cars, Genesis, Van Halen, and Yes in the process. Purple Rain also picked up Best Score Soundtrack for Visual Media at the same ceremony, and was nominated in the night's most coveted Category, Album Of The Year.\n\nAnother impressive feat was the one that had only previously been achieved by the Beatles and Elvis Presley. With the same-named movie also hitting the top of the box office chart, Prince became only the third artist in history to score a No. 1 album, film and song in the same calendar year.\n\nIt Changed How Albums Were Sold\n\nAlthough it seems positively chaste compared to the likes of \"WAP,\" \"Anaconda,\" and \"My Neck, My Back (Lick It),\" Purple Rain's tale of a \"sex fiend\" who enjoys pleasuring herself in hotel lobbies was deemed so provocative at the time of release that it inadvertently instigated a political taskforce.\n\nAppalled by the sexual lyrical content of \"Darling Nikki,\" a track she caught her 11-year-old daughter Karenna listening to, future Second Lady Tipper Gore decided to set up the Parents Music Resource Centre with three other \"Washington Wives.\" The organization subsequently persuaded the record industry and retailers to issue any album containing child-unfriendly material with Parental Advisory stickers. (Another Prince-penned hit, Sheena Easton's \"Sugar Walls,\" was also included alongside \"Darling Nikki\" in the \"Filthy 15\" list of songs the PMRC deemed to be the most offensive examples.)\n\nIt Paved The Way For The Pop Star Film\n\nPrince was the first pop superstar from the 1980s holy trinity to bridge the gap between Hollywood and MTV, with Purple Rain arriving eight months before Madonna's star turn in Desperately Seeking Susan and four years before Michael Jackson's fantastical anthology Moonwalker. And it spawned a whole host of similar vanity projects, too.\n\nYou can trace the roots of everything from Mariah Carey's Glitter to Eminem's 8 Mile back to the tale of a troubled musical prodigy — nicknamed The Kid — who finds solace from his abusive home life at Minneapolis' hottest night spot. And while the acting and screenplay were never going to trouble the Academy Awards (as lead actress Apollonia predicted, however, it did pick up Best Score), Purple Rain's spellbinding onstage performances captures the euphoria of live music better than any other concert film, fictional or real.\n\nIt Helped Redefine Masculinity in Pop\n\n\"I'm not a woman, I'm not a man/ I am something that you'll never understand,\" Prince sings on Purple Rain's biggest dance floor number \"I Would Die 4 U\" — one of many occasions in both the album and film that challenged notions of masculinity, gender and sexuality even stronger than the Purple One had before.\n\nIndeed, although the early '80s was unarguably a boom period for white British pop stars outside the heteronormative norm, it was rarer to find artists of color so willing to embrace such fluidity. Prince, however, had no problem — whether sporting his now-iconic dandy-ish, ruffled white shirt and flamboyant purple jacket combo, or unleashing his impressive array of diva-like shrieks and screams on \"Computer Blue\" and \"The Beautiful Ones.\" André 3000, Lil Nas X and Frank Ocean are just a few of the contemporary names who have since felt comfortable enough to express themselves in similarly transgressive fashion.\n\nIt Added To The Great American Songbook\n\nFrom the apocalyptic rockabilly of \"Let's Go Crazy\" (\"We're all excited/ But we don't know why/ Maybe it's 'cause/ We're all gonna die\") and messianic new wave of \"I Would Die 4 U,\" to the experimental rock of \"Computer Blue\" and self-fulfilling prophecy of \"Baby, I'm A Star,\" Purple Rain delights at every musical turn. But it's the title track that continues to resonate the most.\n\nFollowing Prince's untimely death in 2016, it was \"Purple Rain\" — not \"1999,\" not \"Kiss,\" not \"The Most Beautiful Girl in the World\" — that many fans gravitated toward first. Initially conceived as a country duet with Stevie Nicks, the epic power ballad was described by Prince as pertaining \"to the end of the world and being with the one you love and letting your faith/ God guide you through the purple rain.\"\n\nThe superstar acts every inch the preacher on the emotional tour-de-force. And as the final song that Prince ever performed live — on the Atlanta leg of his Piano & A Microphone tour, a week before his untimely passing — closed the curtains on a truly revolutionary career.\n\nGRAMMY Rewind: Lizzo Thanks Prince For His Influence After \"About Damn Time\" Wins Record Of The Year In 2023\n\n\"There is never a master plan when we make a record,\" Nick Cave recently said about creating Wild God, his upcoming 18th studio effort with longtime backing band the Bad Seeds. \"The records rather reflect back the emotional state of the writers and musicians who played them. Listening to this, I don’t know, it seems we're happy.\"\n\nHappiness is not an emotional state you'd typically associate with an artist renowned for his ghostly demeanor, baritone vocal delivery which sits somewhere between unholy preacher and gothic overlord, and slightly unnatural obsession with the inherently morbid side of life. He was once characterized as the leader of \"the most violent live band in the world.\"\n\nBut Cave's macabre disposition has served him well. Since arriving on the scene with post-punk cult heroes the Birthday Party in the early 1980s, the Australian has gradually developed a cult following willing to hang on his every darkly poetic word. Alongside his day job, he's enjoyed huge critical acclaim as part of side-project Grinderman, as a novelist, and as a Hollywood composer and screenwriter (most notably pulling double duty on 2006 western The Proposition).\n\nHis work has been covered by artists as eclectic as Snoop Dogg, Arctic Monkeys and Johnny Cash. In fact, Cave is now so ingrained in the establishment that he was on the guest list for King Charles III's coronation.\n\nWith Cave's first studio effort since 2021's Warren Ellis collaboration, Carnage, about to hit the shelves, here's a look back at 10 of the most important songs from his prolific — and GRAMMY-nominated —45-year career.\n\n\"Tupelo\" ('The Firstborn Is Dead,' 1985)\n\nAlthough recorded in Berlin by an Australian who'd lived in London for three years, Cave's sophomore The Firstborn Is Dead continued to showcase his fascination with the American South. None more so than on its opening number, a typically morbid, tornado-stricken reimagining of the nightElvis Presley was brought into the world.\n\nCo-written by Barry Adamson of post-punk outfit Magazine, \"Tupelo\" correlates the apocalyptic weather conditions with the birth of a demonic presence, reimagining the King of Rock and Roll as the King of Darkness. \"Well Saturday gives what Sunday steals /And a child is born on his brothers heels/Come Sunday morn the first-born dead,\" Cave croons, inferring that Elvis' still-born twin Jesse was his first sacrificial lamb. You can't imagine it blaring over the speakers at Graceland, but this is the murder balladeer at his fire and brimstone best.\n\n\"The Mercy Seat\" ('Tender Pray,' 1988)\n\nCave has often been dismissive of his band's fifth LP Tender Prey (\"I hear bad production and I hear bad performances as well\"). And yet it birthed what many consider to be his macabre masterpiece: A seven-minute soliloquy delivered by a death row prisoner who becomes more unhinged the closer he gets to the electric chair. In fact, he repeats its biblical chorus (\"And in a way I'm yearning/To be done with all this measuring of proof/Of an eye for an eye/And a tooth for a tooth\") a remarkable 14 times before being put out of his delusional, deranged misery.\n\nAs always, Cave inhabits his deplorable creation with an emotional intensity that's both compelling and deeply unsettling, while Mick Harvey's slithering, unnerving bass — apparently recorded by hitting the strings with a drumstick — only adds to the sense of malevolence. Little wonder, then, that despite Cave's misgivings about its parent album, \"The Mercy Seat\" has remained a setlist ever-present.\n\n\"The Ship Song\" ('Good Son,' 1990)\n\nCave risked alienating his cult fan base in 1990 when he showed a much softer side on Good Son, a record inspired by both his post-rehab clarity and relationship with Brazilian reporter Viviane Carneiro. But \"The Ship Song\" proved that the gothic crooner could tackle the universal theme of undying devotion without descending into schmaltz.\n\nThe tender piano ballad doesn't exactly provide a happy ending, with a deeply smitten Cave essentially acknowledging the old adage, \"if you love someone, set them free.\" (\"Your face has fallen sad now/For you know the time is nigh/When I must remove your wings/And you, you must try to fly\"). Cave laterexpressed doubts about whether his concerted attempt to write a classic love song truly connected. The plethora of cover versions, including anall-star rendition promoting the Sydney Opera House, shows his concerns are unfounded.\n\n\"Red Right Hand\" ('Let Love In,' 1994)\n\nThe Cave song that's arguably penetrated the mainstream more than any other, \"Red Right Hand\" has been a regular fixture of the Scream franchise, been covered by not just one but two former girlfriends (Anita Lane,PJ Harvey), and, most notably, served as the theme to everyone's favorite flat-capped period drama \"Peaky Blinders.\"\n\nInspired by a line from John Milton's Paradise Lost, the centerpiece of eighth LP Let Love In focuses on a cash-grabbing, chameleonic figure (\"He's a ghost, he's a god/He's a man, he's a guru\") who causes all kinds of bloody havoc in a \"reconstructed\" version of Cave's Wangaratta hometown. Haunted house organs, brooding basslines, and a doom-laden tolling bell heighten the sense of menace on a track which once again proves few other artists are as effective at chilling to the bone.\n\n\"Where The Wild Roses Grow\" ('Murder Ballads,' 1995)\n\nThe man dubbed the Gothic Lord of Darkness sings a deeply sinister duet inspired by an Appalachian murder ballad with the pop princess who'd shot to fame with a cover of \"The Loco-Motion?\" On paper, UK Top 20 hit \"Where The Wild Roses Grow\" sounds like the stuff of fever dreams. Yet somehow, Cave and fellow AntipodeanKylie Minogue (then very much in her transitional pop to indie phase) made for an unlikely dream team.\n\nCave wrote the tune especially for Minogue, whom hefreely admitted to quietly obsessing over, and was always going to convince on such a grotesque fairytale. Minogue more than holds her own as the tragic heroine whose inherent beauty compels her psychotic date to end their third date in bloodshed (\"And the last thing I heard was a muttered word/As he knelt above me with a rock in his fist\").\n\n\"Into My Arms\" ('The Boatman's Call,' 1997)\n\n\"Into My Arms\" was written while Cave was undergoing rehab, and specifically during one of the church trips patients were allowed each Sunday. Could divine intervention have played a part? After all, the highlight from tenth album The Boatman's Call finds the one-time cathedral choirboy desperately trying to find solace in a God that he doesn't quite believe in.\n\nNo matter how the alternative hymn was derived, though, it remains one of Cave's most affecting spirituals, a brutally honest meditation on the relationship between love and faith reportedly inspired by two former girlfriends, Carneiro and Harvey. \"Into My Arms\" has beencited by Cave as the song he's proudest of, with his performance at the funeral of close friend Michael Hutchence (he's godfather to the late singer's daughter) later that same year lending it an extra poignancy.\n\n\"Get Ready For Love\" ('Abbatoir Blues/The Lyre of Orpheus,' 2004)\n\nTaken from the double album which cleverly separated Cave's split personalities — the abrasive post-punk provocateur and darkly melancholic troubadour — \"Get Ready For Love\" kicks things off with one almighty bang. Hinting at the ferociousness that would define side project Grinderman's debut three years later, the punkish gospel practically bursts out of the speakers, with Cave audibly relishing another opportunity to play the evangelical feverishly spreading the word.\n\n\"Praise Him till you've forgotten what you're praising Him for/Then praise Him a little more,\" he barks in a manner which sits somewhere between The Henry Rollins Band and \"The Righteous Gemstones.\" It's his most acerbic take on organized religion in a discography dominated by the subject, and following the disappointingly muted Nocturama, a clear sign that he was still able to thrill and disturb in equal measure.\n\n\"Dig, Lazarus, Dig!!!\" ('Dig, Lazarus, Dig!!!' 2008)\n\nThe title track from Cave's return-to-form LP premiered on Christmas Day, but its 21st century take on Lazarus's resurrection wasn't interested in spreading any festive cheer. In fact, by reimagining the biblical figure as a bumbling idiot named Larry who immerses himself in a life of sex, drugs, and criminality (\"He feasted on their lovely bodies like a lunatic/And wrapped himself up in their soft yellow hair\"), \"Dig, Lazarus, Dig!!!\" was more likely to leave conservatives choking on their turkey dinner.\n\nCombining the rock and roll swagger of Link Wray with the stream-of-consciousness melodies ofTalking Heads, the track which originated from a Grinderman demo could never be accused of taking itself too seriously, though. Indeed, when he utters the final line, \"Oh, poor Larry,\" with a camp shriek, Cave sounds more like a Carry On cast member than a harbinger of doom.\n\n\"Jubilee Street\" ('Push the Sky Away,' 2016)\n\nFollowing the departure of founding Bad Seed Mick Harvey, Cave and company appeared to hit the reset button for 2013's Push The Sky Away, a sobering, stripped-back affairinspired by the “significant events, momentary fads, and mystically-tinged absurdities” derived from the world wide web. Its second single \"Jubilee Street\" certainly leans into the latter.\n\nTold from the perspective of a man who may well have murdered the prostitute blackmailing him, the song has something of a literary true crime quality. Meanwhile, the shimmering violins which sound like they're being beamed in from another planet, and the transcendent coda in which the protagonist claims he's both beyond recriminations and now moving to a higher plane (\"Curtains are shut, the furniture is gone/I'm transforming, I'm vibrating, I'm glowing\") heighten the otherworldly feel. Cave was so entranced by its enigma that he felt compelled to pen a meta song, \"Finishing Jubilee Street,\" about its inception.\n\n\"Ghosteen\" ('Ghosteen,' 2019)\n\nFollowing thetragic accidental death of his teenage twin son Arthur three years earlier, Cave's 17th studio effort was understandably consumed by themes of loss, grief, and, as on this beautifully haunting 12-minute meditation, human existence.\n\nOne of several tracks based on metaphysical conversations he shared with his joint-youngest, \"Ghosteen\" is unlikely to leave a dry eye in the house, with \"There is nothing wrong with loving something/You can't hold in your hand\" proving that Cave could speak from the heart with a masterful simplicity. There's also a heavenly, dreamlike quality to its production, which drifts fromLeonard Cohen-esque chanson to ambient prog in a comforting slow-motion pace befitting of its subject matter. An emotionally devastating but truly spellbinding display of catharsis, the title track adds to the argument that Ghosteen is Cave's latter day opus.\n\nMore Alternative Music News\n\nSabrina Carpenter is the first to admit that it's taken her a bit of time to find her way to the top of the music industry. She even likens herself to the tortoise in the fable \"The Tortoise and the Hare\" — even if she didn't want to believe the metaphor growing up.\n\n\"Something that my mom always said to me as a little girl that really annoyed me was that I am the tortoise… throughout my life, [I was] being told, 'Sabrina, you're the tortoise, just chill,'\" Carpenter recalled while accepting the Variety Hitmakers Rising Artist Award in December 2023. \"In moments of frustration and confusion it can feel like a letdown, but it turns out it's actually a very good thing.\"\n\nIt's been a very good thing for Carpenter, indeed. A decade since the release of her debut single, the singer/songwriter isn't just breaking through — she's one of pop's new reigning queens. Over the last year, Carpenter has nabbed her first No. 1 song on the Billboard Hot 100, made a stellar debut at Coachella, and performed on \"Saturday Night Live,\" all the while racking up billions of streams on her music new and old. It's all built excitement for one of the most anticipated pop albums of the summer: Short n' Sweet.\n\nAs Carpenter unveils her new album, take a deep dive into her decade-long journey to pop stardom.\n\nGetting Started: Disney Breakthrough\n\nGrowing up, Carpenter filled the sounds of her family home in Pennsylvania with covers of songs like Adele's \"Set Fire To The Rain\" and \"Picture to Burn\" by future Eras Tour companion Taylor Swift (more on that later). After submitting videos for a singing contest spearheaded by Miley Cyrus, Carpenter would get her first taste of success. Placing third, she caught the eye of Hollywood Records, who signed her following the competition.\n\nSimultaneously, Carpenter also began pursuing acting, landing guest spots on series like \"Law & Order: Special Victims Unit\" in 2011 and joining \"The Goodwin Games\" in 2012. In 2014, she landed a lead role in the Disney Channel series \"Girl Meets World,\" a spin-off of the beloved '90s series \"Boy Meets World,\" which served as a breakthrough moment for the burgeoning star — and a catalyst for her music career.\n\nJust before the show debuted, Carpenter released her debut single, \"Can't Blame A Girl for Trying,\" the title track to her debut EP that arrived a month later. While the four-track EP was the typical output of a teenage Disney star — bubblegum pop sounds with digestible, family-friendly lyricism — it showed off her youthful timbre and offered themes that would become prevalent later in Carpenter's songwriting: love, heartache, and navigating life.\n\nA year later, she released her debut album, Eyes Wide Open. A mix of pop with folk and country influences — a soundscape that remains on Short n' Sweet — Carpenter's debut showed maturity and growth following Can't Blame A Girl For Trying; songs like \"Eyes Wide Open\" and \"We'll Be the Stars\" showed a more introspective side, reflecting on the pressures of being in the spotlight and the journey of finding her identity. Eyes Wide Open also hinted that Carpenter was beginning to hone her songwriting skills, penning four of the 12 tracks.\n\nIt would be on her 2016 sophomore album, EVOLution, where Carpenter would find confidence as a songwriter, co-writing all but one song on the 10-track project. In turn, the lyrics reflected her growing sense of self and a new perspective on past themes, like embracing non-romantic forms of love in \"All We Have is Love,\" being there for a struggling friend in \"Shadows,\" and learning to assert boundaries in \"Space.\"\n\nEVOLution transitioned Carpenter out of the teen pop aesthetic into a more sophisticated sound, experimenting with dance-pop and techno sonics. Genre versatility would become a throughline of sorts for Carpenter, and EVOLution foreshadowed the multifaceted musicality that was to come.\n\nShedding Disney: From Child Actor To Pop Star\n\nAfter \"Girl Meets World\" came to an end at the beginning of 2017, Carpenter was ready for reinvention. Much like Britney Spears' Britney and Cyrus' Can't Be Tamed before her, as Carpenter grew into an adult, she felt like she needed to shed the Disney-fied image that has become a rite of passage for teen stars. Thus began the Singular era.\n\nReleased in 2018 and 2019, respectively, Singular: Act I and Singular: Act II featured songs that were more risqué and mature in nature. A far cry from her tamer work of the past, the R&B track \"Hold Tight\" is equal parts sultry and evocative with Carpenter singing, \"Wanna keep you in, wanna keep you in right/ Wanna feel your skin, wanna feel it on mine.\"\n\nAs she noted in an interview with Billboard, Singular: Act I was a natural progression for a girl now in her late teens — even if it was against the squeaky-clean image of her beginnings.\n\n\"I was known as a fictional character on television with lines that were written for her with an attitude that was portrayed in a way by other people. So for a lot of people, their first impression of me was as a 13-year-old girl [singing] the kinds of songs that she should be singing,\" she said. \"Then, flash forward to 19, and people are asking why I am not singing about the same things that I did when I was 13, as if that's normal.\"\n\nOne of the more notable Singular tracks is from Act I, \"Sue Me.\" Sneakily disguised as a story about a romantic relationship, the song is Carpenter's response to being sued by her ex music managers: \"That's my shape, I made the shadow/ That's my name, don't wear it out though/ Feelin' myself can't be illegal.\" Its tongue-in-cheek and snarky nature would inevitably embolden Carpenter to continue writing more confessional songs with attitude, whether she's responding to media scrutiny in \"because i liked a boy\" from 2022's emails i can't send, or warning a suitor to be careful in Short n' Sweet's \"Please, Please, Please.\"\n\nSingular: Act I and Act II further helped demonstrate different facets of Carpenter's musicality, with the former leaning into pop tendencies and the latter embracing an R&B flair. And as her final albums with Hollywood Records, she used Singular: Act I and Act II to indicate that she wasn't going to let any sort of previous perceptions hold her back. Their coming-of-age themes showcased Carpenter as an artist coming into her own — regardless of whether listeners wanted to keep her in the Disney box or not.\n\nReintroducing Herself: Artistic Authenticity & The \"Nonsense\" Effect\n\nWhile the world was going through a period of change amid the COVID-19 pandemic, so was Carpenter. She signed with Universal Music Group's Island Records in 2021, and soon she would be able to fully introduce the world to who Sabrina Carpenter is as an artist.\n\nAs she noted herself to Variety earlier this year, her 2022 LP, emails i can't send, \"marked the beginning of a really freeing and artistic time for me.\" Once again, she co-wrote every song on the album; this time, though, she only had one co-writer for each track, and even wrote two songs solo (\"emails i can't send\" and \"how many things\") — proving that she was more assured as a songwriter than ever.\n\nAs a result, Carpenter's knack for confessional songwriting is on full display. emails i can't send represents a reflective time capsule of sorts; one that brings the curiosity of her earlier work with the perspective and wisdom of a young adult. Her growing fame meant there was more attention on her personal life, and emails i can't send allowed her to reclaim her narrative and express her side of the story.\n\nCarpenter's candidness struck a chord with listeners, and upon the release of emails i can't send in July 2022, it was clear Carpenter was on a new trajectory. The album debuted at No. 23 on the Billboard 200, which marked her highest entry on the chart to date (as of press time); the 2022 stretch of her Emails I Can't Send Tour sold out in less than a day. And once \"Nonsense\" was released as a single that November, her place as a rapidly rising star was solidified.\n\n\"Nonsense\" was initially written as a means to an end after Carpenter was writing a sad song and had writer's block. Now, the track is the epitome of Carpenter's lyricism, weaving together her wit and humor with an infectious hook. First gaining traction on TikTok because of its catchiness, it's become a beloved part of Carpenter's canon thanks to her inventive and bespoke outros during her live shows. It's since become a tradition for fans to check to see what outro she created for each performance, adding to the fan fervor.\n\nCarpenter further satiated fans' taste for her cheeky lyricism in March 2023, when she released emails i can't send fwd:, the deluxe version of her album, which featured a new track called \"Feather.\" She took the playful, flirting energy of \"Nonsense\" and infused \"Feather\" with buoyant, airy production that mimics the feeling of self-liberation after moving on from a relationship. Earning Carpenter her first pop radio No. 1, \"Feather\" proved that the singer's audacious style was taking hold — and it set the stage for an even bigger 2024.\n\nBecoming A Superstar: Eras Tour, \"Espresso\" & Beyond\n\nAfter her own extensive — and very sold out — tour in support of Emails I Can't Send, Carpenter's rising star status was further confirmed by pop's current queen, Taylor Swift. The singer earned a coveted opening slot on Swift's monumental Eras Tour in Mexico, South America, Australia, and Asia.\n\nJust after her last Eras Tour show in March 2024, Carpenter hinted that her own new era was beginning. \"I'm starting to feel like I've outgrown the songs I'm singing,\" she admitted to Cosmopolitan, \"which is always an exciting feeling because I think that means the next chapter is right around the corner.\"\n\nThat chapter began with \"Espresso,\" which dropped a day before her debut Coachella performance. Doubling down on the playful, self-assured vibe of \"Nonsense,\" the song immediately hinted that big things were coming for Carpenter, debuting at No. 7 on the Billboard Hot 100, where it peaked at No. 3.\n\nUpon announcing her sixth album, Short n' Sweet, Carpenter released \"Please Please Please.\" Combining her now-signature playful, carefree lyricism with an airy, disco-tinged sound, \"Please Please Please\" didn't just present Carpenter as a confident superstar — it became her first Hot 100-topping smash.\n\nCarpenter has referred to Short n' Sweet as the \"hot older sister\" of emails i can't send. \"It's my second 'big girl' album; it's a companion but it's not the same,\" she explained to Variety, to whom she also admitted she feels a \"sense of separation\" from her work prior to emails. \"When it comes to having full creative control and being a full-fledged adult, I would consider this a sophomore album.\"\n\nIt's apt, then, that her Short n' Sweet collaborators — including songwriters Julia Michaels, Amy Allen and Steph Jones — are largely the same as the team from emails i can't send. \"I've really honed in on the people that I love making music with,\" she told Rolling Stone in June.\n\nEven more telling of the direction she's heading is her work with one of pop's hottest producers — and Swift's right-hand man — Jack Antonoff, for the first time. At a GRAMMY Museum event with Antonoff himself, Carpenter debuted the country-infused \"Slim Pickins,\" presenting yet another pop style from Short n' Sweet. And as \"Slim Pickins,\" \"Espresso\" and \"Please Please Please\" indicate, Carpenter's knack for infectious and edgy lyrics isn't just the throughline across Short n' Sweet — it's become the epitome of both her artistry and her stardom.\n\nJust like her metaphorical friend the tortoise, Carpenter's long but steady journey has clearly paid off. As she's figured out who she is on her own terms, she's manifested the bonafide superstardom she's always imagined.\n\n\"I never had the plan B, and it wasn't even a thought in my mind that it wouldn't work out,\" she told Rolling Stone. \"I just always knew it was about not if it would happen but when it would happen.\"\n\nFor Carpenter, every chapter of her artistry has built on the last; she's refused to rest on her laurels and continuously pursued new directions. She's creating work that wholeheartedly reflects her, and growing a loyal fan base because of it. Her next album might be named Short n' Sweet, but her time as a pop superstar will be anything but.\n\nAll Things Sabrina Carpenter\n\nIn a time where pop balances between intimate vulnerability and brazen confidence, queer pop stars like Chappell Roan, Billie Eilish, Reneé Rapp, FLETCHER, and girl in red are spearheading a movement of their own: the lesbian pop renaissance.\n\nThe unofficially coined cultural craze has seen a number of queer women sing openly and explicitly about their same-sex relationships. And they're not holding back: \"She was a Playboy, Brigitte Bardot/ She showed me things I didn't know,\" swoons Roan in \"Red Wine Supernova,\" while Eilish gushes \"she dances on my tongue\" in \"Lunch,\" and FLETCHER confesses in \"girls, girls, girls\" that she \"kissed a girl and…really, really liked it.\"\n\nThis era of openly sapphic joy follows a history of hardships, with decades of queer artists defying prejudice and homophobia to sing openly about their desires and emotions. It's not been an easy journey — and struggles are still painfully evident. When grilled about her sexuality last year, Eilish declared on Instagram, \"I like boys and girls leave me alone about it\"; it echoed Dusty Springfield's 1970s interview when she revealed, \"I'm perfectly capable of being swayed by a girl as by a boy... and I don't see why I shouldn't.\"\n\nSome have defined sapphic pop as a subgenre of indie or bedroom pop, and others have celebrated the more anthemic, upbeat \"sapphic bops.\" But in reality, no one style of music encapsulates lesbian/sapphic songs; these artists are united by loving and desiring other women — some openly, while others were restrained due to societal pressures.\n\nThe current wave of unapologetic queer stars marks a pivotal moment in music history, where sapphic pop is no longer cornered in lesbian circles and gay clubs, but dominating mainstream airwaves, and influencing global pop trends while being rightfully celebrated by the masses. So as the current queer female stars continue to thrive, it's important to pay homage to all of the artists that paved the way.\n\nRead on for a history of defiantly queer women and nonbinary people in music — a celebration of who they are, how they have loved and their remarkable musical imprint.\n\n1950s: A Ranchera Folk Queer Pioneer\n\nCosta Rican artist Chavela Vargas began singing in Mexican cantinas as a teenager in the 1950s, becoming a key figure of Mexico City's bohemian artistic boom. With slick, short hair and a powerful presence, Vargas sang regional Mexican music with hoarse fragility in her songs, including \"Las simples cosas\" and the haunting \"La Llorona\" (which means \"The Weeping Woman\"); her sobbing voice echoing the song's grieving protagonist.\n\nWith love songs addressed to women and an androgynous sense of style, Vargas never hid her sexuality, but first openly spoke about her lesbianism when she was 81. Before her death in 2012 at the age of 93, she lived a fascinating and exuberant life, was a friend and lover of Frida Kahlo and is rumored to have had flings with the likes of Ava Gardner. With her heart-wrenching vocal command, she is considered one of the most important artists in Latin American folk, and remains a towering figure in Latin American queer history.\n\n1960s: A Fearless Pop Star\n\nDecades before female musicians began openly embracing their sexuality, Dusty Springfield cooly shrugged at rumors about her own — her aforementioned 1970 \"coming out\" interview solidifies her status as one of the first openly queer female pop stars.\n\nRising to fame in the 1960s with her blonde beehive and dark eye makeup, Springfield frequented London gay clubs at the height of the Swinging Sixties (which, ironically, didn’t have anything to do with queerness). With hits including \"You Don't Have To Say You Love Me\" and \"Son of a Preacher Man,\" her powerful voice channeled emotion with unnerving vulnerability. Though her music was never quite as frank as she was in the public eye, a few of Springfield's later releases touched on queer themes (1979's \"Closet Man\" and her 1989 collab with Pet Shop Boys, \"In Private\").\n\n1970s: Feminist Folk & Funk\n\nThe second-wave feminist movement in the U.S. pushed gender issues to the core of the country's socio-politico agenda, including fights for abortion rights (Roe v. Wade in 1973) and the ferocious push to pass the Equal Rights Amendment. Women artists were showing they were more than pop glam, picking up guitars and refusing to dress up for the cameras, favoring casual attire; sapphic pop was entering an era of authenticity and emotional honesty. Along the way, a group of feminist lesbians set up Olivia Records.\n\nIn 1975, Olivia's co-founder Cris Williamson released her politically charged folk album, The Changer and The Changed, one of the highest-selling independent records of the time; two years later, Linda Tillery's funk-soul track \"Womanly Way\" explored the sensual side of sapphic love: \"I think I'd like to get to know you in a special kind of womanly way\" she croons. Pioneering trans sound engineer Sandy Stone was an integral part of the Olivia team until she was forced to leave after receiving harrowing threats from separatist groups, sadly marking the steady decline of the groundbreaking label.\n\nIn the UK, Joan Armatradingattracted buzz after performing gigs around her native Birmingham, earning fans for her slick guitar, melodic piano and powerful vocals. Though her lyrics were gender-neutral, Armatrading's music was largely embraced by the lesbian community — including the 1978 song \"Taking My Baby Up Town,\" which celebrates queer love despite the prejudice and homophobia of the time (\"You kissed me/ And then all the people started to stare/ We started a commotion/ Someone making comments, morals/ The state of affairs and I said, \"What we got is the best\"). In 2008, she performed on Cyndi Lauper's True Colors Tour, which raised funds for LGBTQIA+ charities; she has spoken openly about her sexuality in the past decade, and has been in a civil partnership with Maggie Butler since 2011.\n\n1980s: Love, Lust & Rock and Roll\n\nThe '80s brought a spirit of punk into the mainstream, and queer circles were attracted to the music's rebellion and rage. British-Canadian singer Carole Pope was part of the rock band Rough Trade, characteristically clad in leather and singing raunchy songs dedicated to the joys of BDSM and girl-on-girl eroticism. Rough Trade's lustful 1980 song \"High School Confidential\" shocked listeners at the time: \"It makes me cream my jeans when she comes my way,\" swoons Pope. In 1981, she had a brief (but intense) relationship with Dusty Springfield.\n\nA new folk movement was quietly brewing in the hushed tones and poignant strums of Tracy Chapman. Though she has never spoken publicly about her sexuality, her GRAMMY-winning hit \"Fast Car\" has been embraced as a lesbian anthem for its ideals of escapism and unhinged freedom. (Chapman's sexuality was later confirmed by her former lover, author Alice Walker, who spoke about their mid-90s relationship in 2006, though there's no disclosed relation to \"Fast Car.\")\n\nFolk-rock duo Indigo Girls, who are both openly lesbian, formed in 1985 and immediately cultivated a cult queer following that led to a major label deal in 1988. Their 1989 self-titled album — which spawned the celebrated queer anthem \"Closer to Fine\" — went double platinum in the U.S. and won a GRAMMY for Best Contemporary Folk Recording in 1990. Just this year, the duo released a documentary, It's Only Life After All, which charts their journey, revealing the homophobic snubs they've stoically endured throughout their career.\n\nMeanwhile, South AfricanBrenda Fassie began making music with her band the Big Dudes in the early 1980s, combining pop with hip-hop and kwaito. While Fassie did not explicitly sing about being queer, she often referred to herself as a lesbian and never hid her relationships with women. A staunch anti-apartheid campaigner, Fassie made pop with powerful social commentary; she was even hailed as the \"Madonna of the Townships\" for her brazen lyrics. Thought to be Africa's first openly queer pop star, Fassie remains a beacon of acceptance and tolerance in a region where homophobia is still rife — even two decades after her passing.\n\n1990s: Intimacy Resonates\n\nBuilding on the folk origins of Chapman and Indigo Girls, k.d. lang initially broke through with several country hits in the late '80s, but ruffled feathers with country radio when she came out as a lesbian in 1992. Nonetheless, she never backed down from who she was, and it launched her to sapphic pop stardom. Lang's alluring stage presence and a sensual masc charm helped her score a global hit with 1992's \"Constant Craving,\" which has been cited as an ode to lesbian love. The song won a GRAMMY for Best Female Pop Vocal Performance in 1993 — the same year she posed for a steamy Vanity Fair photoshoot with Cindy Crawford, which goes down in the lesbian history books.\n\nIn the late '90s, teenage twins Tegan and Sara picked up guitars and began performing confessional acoustic songs with big pop hooks and grunge elements (1999 track \"Proud\" features empowering lines such as \"Freedom and blood/ I make my mark and fight for tomorrow… I'm proud to be me\"). Their unapologetically queer music videos were intentional in their push for inclusion, complete with same-sex make-out scenes featuring LGBTQIA+ actors. The sisters, both openly lesbian, had a cameo in the cult lesbian series \"The L Word,\" and their nonprofit Tegan and Sara Foundation promotes for LGBTQIA+ equality by raising funds for health care programs, summer camp and more.\n\n2000s: Pop Gets Gayer\n\nThe 2000s marked a shift away from the acoustic confessionals of the decades prior, with a move into club beats and big pop hooks. Queer band the Gossip, starring charismatic, rebellious frontwoman Beth Ditto, broke all expectations of what pop could be and look like, with punk chords, disco beats and a belting voice. Their 2005 smash hit album, Standing in the Way of Control, confronted the marginalization and fear experienced by the queer community. The album's titular song was written in resistance to George Bush's attempt to outlaw same-sex marriage; \"Standing in the way of control/ You live your life/ Survive the only way that you know,\" screamed Ditto.\n\nBefore developing a synth-pop sound on later albums, Chile's Javiera Mena carved emotional, melodic songs on her keyboard with her 2006 debut, Esquemas Juveniles; the album featured heartfelt love songs like \"Camera Lenta,\" which eschewed pronouns to sing about \"the different paths to your eyes\" in Spanish. Though she became more explicit with her sexuality in the 2010s — particularly on the lesbo-erotic hit \"Espada\" — Mena has been recognized as one of the pioneers in Latin America's LGBTQIA+ movement, alongside Ricky Martin, Kany Garcia and Pabllo Vittar.\n\nLondon teenager Elly Jackson, better known as La Roux, immediately broke onto the pop scene with her smash \"Bulletproof,\" and attracted a queer following for her androgynous looks — a refreshing anecdote to the chart dominance of hyper femme pop-stars of the time. While Jackson initially eschewed any labels, not wanting to be confined to queer audiences and baffled by the public speculation on her sexuality, she later embraced her place as an LGBTQIA+ icon (her 2014 track \"Cruel Sexuality\" appears to address her own journey: \"Cruel sexuality / Am I a fool to let you trouble me?\").\n\n2010s: Mainstream Breakthrough\n\nThe 2010s marked a significant push for marriage equality, with same-sex marriage rights being awarded in countries like the U.S., UK, Argentina, Germany, and Australia, among others. This movement for equality was paralleled by a growing visibility of LGBTQ+ representation in pop culture — and sapphic pop was beginning to resonate more than ever before.\n\nL.A.-bred trio MUNA released their indie pop debut, About You, in 2017, loaded with heartfelt songs that helped the trio quickly cultivate a die-hard following of queer fans. Listeners identified with the band's rebellion about heteronormative tropes and coming-of-age queer songs like \"It's Gonna Be Okay, Baby\" (\"Your gonna move to New York, and experiment with communism/ Go down on a girl/ After reading her some Frantz Fanon\").\n\nAnother bisexual indie darling (and MUNA's eventual \"Silk Chiffon\" collaborator), Phoebe Bridgers, also released her debut in 2017. Titled Stranger in the Alps, the album navigated toxic relationships, as well as Bridgers' experiences with women, with queer fans gravitating toward her unprecedented bisexual representation.\n\nA year later, Bridgers teamed up with fellow LGBTQIA+ stars Julien Baker and Lucy Dacus to form the supergroup boygenius. The trio has flipped the \"boy band\" trope on its head, showing that masculine heartthrobs can emerge from feminine fluidity. With lyrics that delve into queer love and heartbreak — and live shows featuring plenty of onstage making out — the band has had a seismic impact on the sapphic pop landscape (and won three GRAMMYs in the process).\n\nIn the mid-aughts, U.S. pop star Hayley Kiyoko was experimenting with her artistry following the split of being in girl group The Stunners. Reintroducing herself as a solo star in 2013, Kiyoko had the freedom to explore lyrical themes that were more true to her own experience — like her 2015 breakthrough hit, \"Girls Like Girls.\" The song, and accompanying music video, cemented her place in the queer pop canon; which Kiyoko has followed up with several songs about queer love and relationships, including \"What I Need\" featuring Kehlani (who came out as lesbian in 2021 and has since explored her own sapphic narratives, like 2020's \"Tangerine.\")\n\nAfter hinting at their sexuality with the breakup song \"Talia\" in 2017, King Princess, who is genderqueer, went all-in on their queerness with the laid-back indie love song \"Pussy is God\" in 2018. Since then, they've built a cult following with songs marked by blatant honesty in a shifting age of gender identity and sexual expression — like 2022's \"Sex Shop,\" which contemplates the use of strap-ons and binders.\n\nMeanwhile, pansexual and nonbinary artist Janelle Monaédonned vagina-shaped pants for their symbolic video \"Pynk,\" their 2018 sapphic sex anthem from Dirty Computer — a queer afro-futurist album that rebelled against the conservative policies of the then-incumbent Trump administration (\"If you try to grab my pussy cat/ This pussy cat grab you back\" they spit on \"I Got The Juice\"). The album's accompanying science-fiction film featured Monaé playing an android on the run with a lover, played by Tessa Thompson. Monaé's went even more explicitly queer in follow-up album The Age of Pleasure, a hedonistic kaleidoscope of funk, pop and reggae (\"I like lipstick on my neck, leave a ticky hickey in a place I won't forget,\" they flirt on \"Lipstick Lover\").\n\n2020s: Sapphic Pop Explosion\n\nThough we're only four years into the 2020s, the decade has been marked by an explosion of sapphic pop. New Jersey pop star FLETCHER helped kick off the movement in 2020 with her EP The S(ex) Tapes, which navigated the end of a lesbian relationship through dark pop hooks loaded with sensual energy. Two years later, she doubled down on the lesbian narrative with her debut album, Girl Of My Dreams, which spawned one of the most viral queer songs of the decade this far, \"Becky's So Hot.\" (In between, she delivered another lesbian bop alongside Kiyoko with 2021's \"Cherry.\")\n\nNorwegian indie star girl in red, who is openly queer, cultivated a huge online following after the release of standalone early singles (in the track \"i wanna be your girlfriend,\" she sings, \"Oh Hannah… I don't wanna be your friend/ I wanna kiss your lips\"), before releasing her highly anticipated debut if i could make it go quiet in 2021, featuring songs like \"Did You Come?\" (\"Did you do the things you know I like? Roll your tongue, make her cum 20 times?\"). Her connection to lesbians and bisexual women was so strong that the term \"do you listen to girl in red?\" evolved into a code to identify fellow queers on Sapphic TikTok.\n\nIn the Latin urban scene, openly gay Puerto Rican star Young Mikko is shaking up reggaeton with her assured flow and cheeky, suggestive singles including \"Peach\" — an ode to her lover's rounded butt. Brazilian star Ludmilla makes listeners blush with her sensual track \"Sintomas de Prazer,\" talking about getting turned on while giving her lover pleasure.\n\nAfter Billie Eilish established herself as one of the biggest pop stars of her generation, she faced intense pressure to come out as queer in November 2023. Six months later, her sexuality became a central theme in her third album, HIT ME HARD AND SOFT — particularly the album's first single, \"LUNCH,\" a fearless ride on pleasuring women. She seems to be enjoying her newfound freedom, too: in her recent remix of Charli XCX's \"Guess,\" she deviously sings, \"I wanna … kiss it bite it, can I fit it?/ Charli likes boys, but she knows I'd hit it.\"\n\nEilish was one of many Coachella 2024 performers who brought sapphic pop to the desert. Reneé Rapp's set was introduced by the cast of \"The L Word,\" Ludmilla's shared a tender onstage kiss with her wife during love song \"Maldivas\", and of course, Chappell Roan — decked in her Eat Me tee — had thousands to sing along with her unabashedly kinky hits.\n\nRoan herself is redefining pop, with outfits inspired by drag aesthetic and lyrics that are unapologetically sapphic (\"Knee deep in the passenger's seat and you're eating me out/ Are we casual now?\" she sings in country pop ballad \"Casual\"). In August, Roan broke records for attracting Lollapalooza's largest-ever crowd, and her rapidly rising fame helped her 2023 album, The Rise and Fall of a Midwest Princess, reach No. 2 on the all-genre Billboard 200 (and a UK No. 1) nearly a year after its release.\n\nLesbian and queer artists have been making music for decades — and with artists more openly celebrating their sexuality than ever before, it's an undeniably exciting and historic time for the LGBTQIA+ music community. A new era of sapphic pop is upon us, and it's hot, explicit and gleefully unrestrained. You could even call it a femininomenon.\n\nExplore More Alternative & Indie Music\n\nIt's no secret that Filipinos can unapologetically belt out a song from Celine Dion, Whitney Houston or any pop diva on the mic. But beyond the viral videos of them singing their hearts out in malls or in their homes, the Filipino music scene is vibrantly filled with heart and emotions; and often taken over by powerful soloists like the Philippine pop princess Sarah Geronimo, balladeers like Martin Nievera or Morisette Amon, and acoustic/rock bands like Ben&Ben or Up Dharma Down that often sing about love, heartbreak and life.\n\nWithin the last decade, we've seen an evolution in the Philippine music scene: while solo stars continue to shine, pop groups have begun to take over the spotlight. The concept of pop groups have existed before in Philippine entertainment, however, were usually formed through variety shows or composed of actors and actresses — not necessarily pop idols that you can compare in other Asian music markets like Japan and South Korea.\n\nIt really wasn't until 2018, during the peak of third-generation K-pop, where we saw the beginning of first generation Pinoy pop idol groups. Inspired and influenced by the K-pop idol training system, some P-pop entertainment companies have begun implementing similar systems, or inviting Korean mentors who are active in the industry for any vocal and dance training needed.\n\nTwo of the most notable first-gen P-Pop groups are SB19 and BINI, who are at the forefront of bringing P-pop to a global audience. Five-piece boy band SB19 became the first Southeast Asian group to be nominated for a Billboard Music Award in 2021, and their 2023 single \"GENTO\" was approved for GRAMMY consideration last year. Meanwhile, eight-piece girl group BINI have earned the title as the Nation's Girl Group after a string of successful viral hits including \"Salamin, Salamin\" and \"Pantropiko\"; just this year, they made history as the first P-pop act to perform at KCON in Los Angeles.\n\nOf course, the P-pop universe wouldn't be complete without solo acts. P-pop fans love to celebrate the timeless discography of Sarah Geronimo or gush over Asia's pop heartthrob Darren Espanto, and there's always new individual talent proving that the scene is still thriving.\n\nAs major P-pop stars continue to make waves, there's tons of blossoming acts who are helping to raise the Filipino flag in the global music scene. In light of the bright future ahead, here are a mix of P-Pop groups and soloists you should check out.\n\nALAMAT\n\nIf the actual country of the Philippines were a pop group, it would be ALAMAT. The six member group — composed of Taneo, Mo, Jao, Tomas, R-ji, and Alas — under Viva Records values Filipino culture in their concepts.\n\nEach member hails from different regions of the Philippines and also speak different dialects from their respective regions. Using dialects and culture to their advantage, ALAMAT often incorporates traditional folk dances, instruments, and lyrics in their native languages; and blends them into the modern sounds of hip-hop, R&B and dance.\n\nBGYO\n\nFormed in 2018 and officially making their debut under Star Music in 2021 with \"The Light,\" the quintet composed of Gelo, Akira, JL, Mikki, and Nate are known as the \"Aces of P-Pop.\" The name BGYO even celebrates their heritage, as it's an acronym for \"Becoming the change, Going further, You and I, Originally Filipino.\"\n\nOften fusing pop sounds with R&B, the boy group isn't afraid to get quirky with their concepts — whether they're singing a ballad in suits or wearing vibrant oversized ones. As a result, their music is helping BGYO score big wins: Their single \"The Baddest\" made them the first Filipino act to top Billboard's Next Big Sound chart in 2021, followed by P-Pop Group of the Year at the TikTok Awards Philippines in 2022.\n\nKAIA\n\nDebuting under SB19's former label, ShowBT Philippines, KAIA is composed of members Angela, Charlotte, Sophia, Alexa, and Charice. The quintet officially made their debut in 2022 with their lead single \"BLAH BLAH\" — a powerful EDM-pop track that can be considered for your gaming playlist.\n\nThe name KAIA is a double entendre: a Cebuano word \"kinaiya\" meaning one's self and personality; and the Tagalog word \"kaya\" which roughly translates \"to be able to\" or \"can do.\" In other words, a P-pop girl group that can give you the extra boost when you need that sonic encouragement on the daily.\n\nInigo Pascual\n\nOne of the Philippine heartthrobs, Inigo Pascual is a suave and smooth pop soloist who aims to make you swoon with his R&B-pop serenades. His pop-doowop hit \"Dahil Sa'Yo\" off his solo debut of the same name became the first song to top the Billboard Philippines Top 20 chart in 2016.\n\nRight from his debut, the actor and singer/songwriter continued to soar in his career when he released his international single \"Options\" in 2019. Just last month, the chart-topping singer unveiled his latest project, Basta't Alam Kong Tayo 1, a three-track single-album under Republic Records Philippines.\n\nG22\n\nIf you already listen to K-pop, then you are familiar with the girl crush concept where the sounds are bass-heavy and the looks are all about dark outfits with smokey makeup. If that's up your alley, then check out G22.\n\nUnder Cornerstone Entertainment, the former quartet-turned-trio composed of members AJ, Alfea, and Jaz are known to be the \"Female Alphas of Philippine Pop.\" The trio officially made their debut in April 2022 with their first single \"BANG!\" which was then followed by their second single \"Babalik!\" in May. But don't be fooled by their powerful demeanors — the trio also has a light and soft side to themselves in their B-sides and singles too.\n\nVXON\n\nIf G22 is dubbed as the \"Female Alphas of Philippine Pop,\" then VXON are said to be the \"Monsters of P-pop\" — so don't be fooled by the pretty boy looks VXON may carry. They are a P-pop group that can balance bubblegum pop with beast-like concepts, as if you're watching the transformation of boys to men. But at their core, they're making music to capture your heart (see for yourself with their viral R&B hit \"Sandal\").\n\nMaking their official debut in January 2022, the group consists of five members: C13, Franz, Patrick, Vince and Sam. After a big first year — they won Favorite Rookie P-Pop Group at Nylon Manila's Big, Bold, and Brave Awards in 2022 — VXON have continued winning hearts, most recently delivering a series of swoon-worthy live sessions on their YouTube channel.\n\nMaymay Entrata\n\nA multi-talented soloist, Maymay embodies Filipino entertainment, a fun and vibrant breath of fresh air within the Philippine music scene. She takes pride in her Visayan roots and stays grounded from her humble beginnings, even naming and singing her songs in Visaya, Tagalog and English.\n\nFirst known as the season 7 winner of \"Pinoy Big Brother\" in 2016, Maymay has made a name for herself as a musical artist in the last couple of years. Signed under the same label as BINI and BGYO, Maymay is grandiose in her music, presenting a plethora of genres in her discography, from disco to dance pop to a little salsa with visuals that encapsulate inspiration from Filipino culture. \"Her journey is only going further as she teased her first and upcoming international single \"Paradise\" at the 'ASAP Natin 'To in California' concert earlier this month.\"\n\nPLUUS\n\nFormerly known as SBTCBoys, the six-member boy group composed of Theo, Gab, Justin, Yen, Haro, and JL made their debut in 2023 with their first EP +.Y.M. (stylized and read as Time). Steering away from the traditional lead single promotions, PLUUS broke boundaries by promoting three tracks at once with \"Amigo,\" \"My Time\" and \"Cross My Heart\" last year.\n\nThe trio of tracks also displayed PLUUS' wide array of talents: \"Amigo\" is a hip-hop-heavy dance pop track celebrating camaraderie; whereas \"My Time\" follows the personal stories of being an idol; and \"Cross My Heart\" is a love song about letting go. They've continued showing their versatility in 2024, with the airy single \"Universe\" and the thumping track \"Summotion.\"\n\n1st.One\n\n1st.One was already putting themselves on the map, and embodying their name, before they even made their official debut in July 2020; the month before, they became the first Filipino act to perform at the Seoul Music Awards. The six members — Ace, Max, Alpha, J, Joker, Jayson — debuted under the Philippine subsidiary of FirstOne Entertainment in South Korea with their single electronic pop single \"You Are The One (Ttak Maja Nuh).\"\n\nIf you're into the nostalgic sounds of second-gen K-pop, 1st.One may be your seamless transition into P-pop. But just like any other group, they've explored different sounds and concepts; earlier this year, the group switched it up and dropped their R&B slow jam single \"Dito\" that was choreographed by member Max.\n\nDIONE\n\n1st.One's sister group, DIONE (or stylized as D1ONE), also debuted in 2020, carrying that girl crush aesthetic with them. Some members of the group were first introduced as LUNA, a project trainee group under FirstOne Entertainment set to debut. Eventually, the quartet composed of Joyden, DK, Clara, and Ella released their digital single \"BLING BLING\" in April 2022.\n\nUpon their official debut, the quartet's image delivered expensive pop, soundtracking their luxurious, high-fashion looks with EDM-driven pop — somewhat reminiscent of the sounds of second-gen K-pop groups like 2NE1 and After School. Their music is fun, energetic and quite tantalizing.\n\nYARA\n\nFairly new to the game, YARA is oozing with charisma, from their rap flows to their dance moves. Signed under Sony Music Philippines, YARA consists of four members — Gelou, Rocher, Christa, and Kim — who blend rap, hip-hop and pop all together.\n\nDebuting in March 2023, the P-pop girl group released their first single \"Adda\" (short for \"Apat Dapat Dapat Apat\"). Earlier this year, the group revived the old school bubblegum pop song \"Bakit Papa?\" by variety show girl group Sexbomb Girls, and gave it an R&B twist. Their recent track \"Katawan Flow\" sees the group making the dancehall genre their own — hinting that their musical direction will always be unpredictable.\n\nMaki\n\nMaki isn't your typical idol pop singer, but that's exactly what makes him a promising soloist. He seamlessly blends alternative rock and pop together, triggering a listener to get in their feels along the way.\n\nWhen he's not dancing to BINI's \"Cherry On Top,\" you can often find Maki strumming a guitar, questioning various love-related situations. And it seems his approach is working: his latest release, \"Dilaw,\" topped the Billboard Philippines' Hot 100 and Billboard Top Philippines Songs for multiple weeks in July.\n\nCALISTA\n\nOfficially making their debut under Tyronne Escalante Artist Management and Merlion Events Production in 2022, CALISTA is working toward being the next P-pop greats. Carrying more of a girl crush vibe, CALISTA's sounds blend dreamy pop with 808 beats and R&B.\n\nOriginally debuting as a six-member ensemble with the trap-inspired pop single \"Race Car,\" the group has spent the majority of 2024 as a quartet comprised of Anne, Dain, Elle, and Denise. Their latest single \"Let Me Know\" has made its way around TikTok, helping them get one step closer to achieving superstar status.\n\nECLYPSE\n\nOriginally known as YAMA, ECLYPSE is fairly new, but definitely promising, to the P-Pop game. Comprised of six former participants of reality-survival show \"Top Class\" (Lex, Gilly, Dean, Clyde, Gab, Joshuel) and one who was announced as a member on the live-streaming app KUMU (Rave), the group have been forming since 2022 and made their official debut this year under GKD Labels.\n\nWhether they're taking on a light or dark concept, their sounds revolve around the EDM genre — a seamless fit for their tones and voices. If you're a fan of synths, harmonies and falsetto, this may be the group for you.\n\nLatest News & Exclusive Videos"
