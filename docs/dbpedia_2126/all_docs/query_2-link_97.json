        "text": "Cum On Feel The NoizeSlade\n\n\"Cum On Feel The Noise\" was originally recorded by the British glam band Slade in 1973. Quiet Riot had their first hit with the song when they recorded it in 1983.\n\nGoodbye Yellow Brick RoadElton John\n\n\"Goodbye Yellow Brick Road\" is one of the few Bernie Taupin lyrics that is more about him than Elton John. The song is about giving up glitz for the simple life - not exactly Elton's M.O.\n\nFoxy LadyJimi Hendrix\n\nJimi Hendrix opened for The Monkees on their 1967 tour, and it did not go well. The young, mostly female crowd shouted \"Davy\" when Hendrix sang the word \"Lady\" in \"Foxy Lady\" in honor of who they came to see: Monkees lead singer Davy Jones.\n\nCheeseburger in ParadiseJimmy Buffett\n\nJimmy Buffett's \"Cheeseburger In Paradise\" has muenster (cheese), not mustard, as commonly misheard in the line \"medium rare with muenster'd be nice.\"\n\nAmerican Hits With Foreign TitlesSong Writing\n\nWhat are the biggest US hits with French, Spanish (not \"Rico Suave\"), Italian, Scottish, Greek, and Japanese titles?\n\nJanet JacksonFact or Fiction\n\nWas Janet secretly married at 18? Did she gain 60 pounds for a movie role that went to Mariah Carey? See what you know about Ms. Jackson.\n\nJames Williamson of Iggy & the StoogesSongwriter Interviews\n\nThe Stooges guitarist (and producer of the Kill City album) talks about those early recordings and what really happened with David Bowie."
