        "text": "Prince Busters musical influence can be felt worldwide, he shaped the course of Jamaican contemporary music. His legacy will continue to be drawn upon for generations to come. During the UK ska revival in the late 1970s which stemmed from Coventry’s 2-Tone label introduced Prince Busters music to a new generation of listeners. In 1979 the band Madness released their first single on 2-Tone, a tribute to Prince Buster called “The Prince”. The B-side was a cover of the Prince Busters song “Madness” from which they took their name.\n\nPrince Buster produced greats such as Toots and the Maytals and he paved the way for international reggae, becoming known as the originator of SKA worldwide. He inspired greats like The Selector, The Beat, The Specials and of course Madness.\n\nHis son Sultan Ali, born in Kingston, Jamaica has been performing since the late eighties, on a mission to continue his fathers legacy since his death in 2016. Claiming to be the rightful heir to his fathers throne, he performed at “Skamouth” in 2017 and was the first ska artist to perform in a Chinese city when he took to the stage at Hong Kong’s Clockenflap Music & Arts Festival in 2014.\n\nSultan has performed across the United States and most notably alongside his father in 2001 at the Sierra Nevada World Music Festival in California. He has shared the stage alongside Lester “Ska” Sterling and The Skatalites at Los Globus Night club in Los Angeles 2014 and again at Dub Club in 2015.\n\nAlthough he covers the majority of his fathers music he has also self-produced original material such as Beautiful Angel and Love, Kindness, Joy and Happiness.\n\nI was approached a few years ago by his son Sultan Ali who requested an interview to help promote his music and provide a platform to announce a few truths about his birthright and the unfortunate circumstances around his fathers death. I was unaware at the time of the family dispute as a result of Prince Busters death. It became apparent after several late night and often heated conversations with sultan that he was angry and frustrated about the use of his father music since his death and felt robbed of his birthright.\n\nSultan Ali mentions many notable people by name and refers to others as Jezebels as well as claiming the unauthorised use of his fathers music by a well known fast food restaurant. It can now be read below however due to the being respectful of those mentioned by Sultan Ali I have removed their personal details to protect there confidentiality.
