        "text": "In a revealing new interview, Meghan Markle and Prince Harry sat down to talk about mental health and the Archewell Foundation's new program, with Meghan sharing her past experiences with suicidal ideations.\n\nOn Aug. 4, Meghan's 43rd birthday, the interview was released, with the couple talking with Jane Pauley for CBS Sunday Morning about their program called The Parents' Network, which focuses on helping parents aid kids dealing with depression and other mental health issues as a result of social media.\n\nWhile the interview was initially solely about the new program, Pauley surprised Meghan by bringing up her admission from an interview in 2021 with Oprah Winfrey that there was a time when she \"just didn't want to be alive anymore,\" and the 43-year-old shared an earnest response about how her past might help others.\n\n\"If me voicing what I have overcome will save someone, or encourage someone in their life to really, genuinely check in on them and not assume that the appearance is good so everything is OK, then that's worth it, I'll take a hit for that,\" she said.\n\nShe initially noted, \"I wasn't expecting it, but I understand why\" Pauley brought up the topic.\n\nAfter the interview's release, people shared their reactions online, with many praising Meghan for her honesty and willingness to talk about such a personal subject.\n\n\"This interview was heavy but very necessary. Thank you Harry and Meghan for raising awareness and providing community and light to these families. ‚ú®ü´∂üèæ,\" wrote one fan in response.\n\nAnother person noted how Meghan has faced bullying online for years, \"yet she wakes up everyday and continues to push for a better world and social media for others and her children. She‚Äôs an inspiration ü•πüíõ.\"\n\nOthers commented, \"I‚Äôm so impressed with how Meghan handled herself and conveying that she‚Äôs overcome it,\" and \"This conversation is long overdue. Big thank you to not only Sussexs, but the parents!\"\n\nThe Parents' Network has officially launched, and people can listen to the parents' stories on the official website.\n\nIf you or someone you know is in emotional distress or considering suicide, call the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 1-800-273-TALK (8255)."
