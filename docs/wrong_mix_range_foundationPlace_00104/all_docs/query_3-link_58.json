Social Media is a tool throughout the Customer Journey Purchase Experience Problem / Need Awareness Enquiry Recommendation Retention\n\n6. You have to do your Homework before creating a Social Media Strategy Experience Mapping Customer Definition Moments of Truth Experience Design Monitor User research Contextual analysis Personas Lovemarks Requirements Touchpoints Need states Emotional states Narrative insight Differentiators Loyalty drivers Priorities ROI Concept Prototype Validate Ideation Roadmap Measurement Dashboard Tools\n\n9. It’s mostly about Word of Mouth TALKERS Know who’s doing the talking & influencing, and where the conversations are taking place TOPICS Give them something fun, unique & repeatable to talk about – create curiosity gaps and triggers TOOLS Make everything shareable and forwardable , post content everywhere, free samples, find the multipliers TRACKING Listen to users, track topics and brand mentions, gather insights, measure & manage, respond and engage TAKING PART Engage, share info & support, do shout-outs, say thank-you, say sorry\n\n10. Citizen marketers will sell “remarkable” ideas Innovators should adopt the 1% rule If you don’t find the “sneezers” or connectors, the 80/20% rule won’t matter Work backwards Build your brand around your idea first. If the community you are targeting does not coalesce and rally around the idea, continuing to build the product is irrelevant Create your own “blue ocean” If you play it safe and go by the rules of your industry, value chain, and business model – you’re dead! Most industries and markets are saturated and highly concentrated. Purple Cows\n\n11. Only now should you sit down and choose your Platforms\n\n13.

Break-out Session Purchase How easy is it to get started? Is there a long registration process? When does a commitment and a payment take place, and does that fit the need? Experience How easy is the service to use? Does it meet the needs? Of your customer? Are there hurdles, confusion points, short-comings that can be addressed? How much support is provided? Is feedback captured throughout the whole process? What other needs could be met? Problem / Need What’s the problem to be solved, the job to be done? How do developers express that need? Where does it fit into all the other things they do? Awareness How do your customers find out about your service, or any other solutions? Where do conversations take place? Where do your customers physically gather? How well do you listen? How clear are the marketing messages and website? Enquiry How do your customers make contact in order to find out more about your service and whether it’s the right one for them? How do they make the decision to use the service or not? Are there other routes through all of the tools their disposal? Recommendation Do users recommend the service to others? Is it easy to recommend and share? Does the service generate buzz? Who’s doing the talking? What customer outreach initiatives are being taken? Retention Do users come back and use the service again? Do they try new elements of the service, scale up their usage? Reclaimed, renewed, redeemed? Has a relationship been developed? How are past users communicated with? Strategic option: MYOA - Consumer\n\n22.

A boot-strapping PR to-do list Create a press release that announces your new business. Make sure that its title has the keywords that your customers will use to search Google for the type of product or service you sell. For example “Premium Dog Walking Service Launched in Cambridge” or “Solar Battery for Laptop Computers”. Include the search term in the first one hundred words of the press release and again in its summary. Make sure the address of your website and your phone number appear in the release. Post this release on sites like prlog.com , bignews.biz and openpr.com . Note that all these sites will get a well written release listed on news.Google.com as well as hundreds of other sites. That means that when people search for what you sell it will be easier to find you. Publish one or two similar news releases every week. Reuse the same keywords and phrases over and over again so that your company will climb to the top of listings for those terms on Google. You can write a release about new customers you’ve acquired, hassles your customers face, solutions for problems you’ve found for your customers, etc. This is one of the best marketing investments you can make. Add your press releases to your website. That helps insure that your natural Google ranking for the search terms is maximized.\n\n24.
