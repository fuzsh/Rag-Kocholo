Such a fan need not be quite as dedicated as the antagonist in Stephen King’s thriller Misery, but rather reasonably dedicated, supportive, enthusiastic and encouraging. I have such a fan—my very much loved nephew, Rich. He faithfully visits quilting and bookshops to engage in a bit of not-so-subtle name-dropping for his doting aunt. When he visits bookstores, he calmly asks why my book titles are not more prominently displayed. He visits new quilt shops and takes in his own copies of my books and provides a sales pitch as to why the new owner should carry my books in the new shop. He is neither a crafter nor a quilter, but insists on having a copy of each of my books in a place of honor in his home. Blind to my errors and foibles, he persists in being the most proud and loving of fans, singing my praises even when no one is listening. I can’t explain it, but I certainly am pleased that he is my Number One Fan. I dedicate this book to Rich. Thank you for your unwavering love, support, and pride in my work. It truly touches me.\n\nPrelims.qxd 14/12/2004 09:38 AM Page viii\n\nPrelims.qxd 14/12/2004 09:38 AM Page ix\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nI\n\nam indebted for life to my bridegroom, who bravely married me the day I signed the contract to write this book. Patiently, he made meals while watching the back of my head as I faced the computer seven days a week for eight months. He maintained quiet in his new home so I could write. He lovingly counted the weeks until the manuscript would cease being his competition. For his encouragement as he entered the unfamiliar world of authors and books, he deserves a bouquet of flowers, like those he often brought me when discouraging moments arose with the manuscript. Thank you, Jim. You have my heart and my promise to become a full-time wife now. I also thank: Sue Wegert, my “Computer Elf,” for consistently coming to the rescue with excellent tips and solutions to help me deal with the mysterious nuances of my computer. Peggy Diamanti, Alice Thiesen, and Marilyn Maddalena: I am blessed with your friendship. My students who keep me on my toes with questions and suggestions. The talented array of quilters who endured my probing questions as I interviewed them for this book—thank you! You have enriched this book with your valuable contributions and taught me so much along the way. —SYLVIA ANN LANDMAN-RASMUSSEN\n\nPrelims.qxd 14/12/2004 09:38 AM Page x\n\nPrelims.qxd 14/12/2004 09:38 AM Page xi\n\nForeword\n\nI\n\nmet Sylvia at a quilting conference. During our walks to and from classrooms and the dining hall, we found a kindred spirit in one another. I was fascinated to learn that English was her second language; she speaks it better than I do and it is my first and only language. Little bits of information came from her, and finally I discovered she had authored several books and articles. We had a great time together and became good friends. The next time we met, Sylvia was giving a lecture about copyright. She held her audience spellbound. Sylvia has a delightful sense of humor that makes the driest material fascinating. You hear it and absorb it before you know what has happened, and you enjoy the process. I find her writing much the same: It is succinct and to the point, always answering questions I would have asked, and fine-tuning the answer beyond the question. I purchased all her books to see what this lady was all about. I was impressed with how knowledgeable she is. She knows the facts in depth, and follows them with documentation. I am especially excited to read Sylvia’s new book, Make Money Quilting. Quilting is my work. I teach, design, and work at a local quilt shop. Quilting has been in my life since I was a small child, as both of my grandmothers quilted. I have been quilting since 1974. Sylvia and I have kept in contact, and I feel honored to be asked to write this foreword. I mulled it over in my mind for months. I wanted to sort through how to express the special feelings I have for Sylvia, both as a friend and as a teacher. Thank you, Sylvia, for giving me this honor. I hope all who read this book enjoy getting to know this delightful lady as much as I have. —PEGGY A. DIAMANTI\n\nPrelims.qxd 14/12/2004 09:38 AM Page xii\n\nChapter 01.qxd 8/12/04 05:37 PM Page 1\n\n1\n\nTurning Your Hobby into a Business\n\nQ\n\nuilters and crafters enrolled in my college-level small business classes express a common problem as they turn professional. Business matters, especially bookkeeping, receive too little of their attention because these creative people value their artistic interests more. They often continue to think like hobbyists rather than like business owners when starting out. Such thinking challenges them as they make a transition from hobby to for-profit enterprises. They seem surprised to learn that the IRS requires business owners to maintain books and records that follow business standards common today. Novice entrepreneurs often fear they are compromising their creative ethic when actively marketing their products. Quilters can resent the time spent on bookkeeping or correspondence. They want what they perceive as “real work”— working with sewing machines, thread, and fabric. However, the very business activities they shun are those they must develop if quilting is to become profitable enough to earn a living or supplement existing incomes. Bookkeeping may not be as much “fun” as designing or quilting, yet we must discipline ourselves to learn all we can about accounting, advertising, and marketing to profit from our artistic talents.\n\nQuilting as a Business—How the IRS Sees It If you want to turn your quilting hobby into a business, you may wonder how to tell when the time is right to begin. Four questions may help you recognize when your hobby may be turning into a business. Did you: Net more than $400 per year from your quilting? Internal Revenue Service statutes say that when a taxpayer nets (not grosses) more than $400 per year, she must file a Schedule C with her income tax return to report selfemployed income. When a small business shows a profit for three out of five years, a viable enterprise exists. ✦ Begin to make your quilting profitable so you could buy fabric, patterns, and books, but find that your income extends to pay other expenses? ✦ Find yourself increasing the time you work for others and setting your own projects aside? ✦ Find yourself keeping notes or an informal bookkeeping system to track expenses and income? ✦\n\nIf so, you have begun a business process.\n\nChapter 01.qxd 8/12/04 05:37 PM Page 2\n\n2 / M A K E M O N E Y Q U I LT I N G\n\nIf your quilting activities show a profit and you see a small business emerging, you have a few decisions to make. Begin by assessing the time you will need to spend developing your business. Is it feasible to add more quilting time to your present work-at-home schedule? Incorporating a new pursuit into your life requires adjustment. Consider your work style and personality as you explore the possibility of creating a business. Many people prefer to work around others, to give and receive regular feedback about group interests. Does this describe you? If so, you may want to rethink starting your business at home, where you will often work in solitude. Many creative people enjoy working alone; others deplore it. Does this lifestyle suit you? If you have answered “yes” to the previous questions and still feel determined to explore converting your quilt hobby to a small business, consider what the IRS has to say. The IRS is the definitive guide on tax issues and deductions affecting your business, and it requires your quilt business to show a clear “profit motive.” This means you must make every effort to make a profit and pay taxes on income you earn. To turn your hobby into a business and prove you aim to make a profit, you must: Maintain a general business ledger to document deductible expenses and income. You may use very expensive systems, or a small notebook. The IRS accepts computer-generated spreadsheets too. ✦ Keep invoices and receipts in good order to affirm your expenses and income. ✦ Make regular business transactions. ✦ Set aside time devoted to your business. ✦ Prove that you follow general business practices such as advertising, bank accounts, legal licenses, and permits, and that you create a business name. ✦ Show a profit three out of five years or present solid evidence of your effort to do so. ✦\n\nWhen the IRS determines that your business shows a profit, you have no problem identifying your activities as “business.” However, the IRS can declare your business as a hobby—an activity not engaged in for profit—if you do not follow general business practices. Even if you list your quilting activities as a hobby, if you generate income from them, you must still add a Schedule C to your annual returns and pay taxes on the earnings. Business owners can deduct losses, but hobbyists can only deduct expenses equal to the amount of income generated. The IRS offers many free booklets to help you establish a profitable business. You can order them by mail or download them from the IRS Web site.\n\nWorking Where You Live—Confusion of Roles Working from home is here to stay. Books, newsletters, and catalogs today dedicate themselves to home-based workers. Magazine articles explore the number one question: “How do you separate personal time from business tasks when you work where you live?”\n\nChapter 01.qxd 8/12/04 05:37 PM Page 3\n\nTu r n i n g Yo u r H o b b y i n t o a B u s i n e s s / 3\n\nFriends may say: “How lucky you are to stay at home and work!” or “By the way, are sewing, quilting and other crafts really work? It must be so easy,” or “Isn’t it like getting paid to play?” Quilters hear these questions often and we know it is hard work. We love it, but what gets in our way that makes working from home so complicated? Here are a few reasons. Society programs us to associate home with family, rest, relaxation, and everyone’s favorite, housework. Think of the old adage, “A man’s/woman’s home is his/her castle.” Conversely, society also programs us to expect that working at a job site means leaving home interests behind each day. Commuting from home office to kitchen takes seconds. There is not much time to switch identities. No wonder it is tough to have a clear picture of who we are at a given moment. Several generations have been socialized to this clean-cut separation, but it has not always been so. Before the industrial revolution, working from home was the norm. The butcher, the baker, and the candlestick maker lived upstairs and worked downstairs. It is difficult today for an entire new generation to learn how to do the same without the benefit of role models long gone.\n\nSeparate Business from Personal Tasks Today, we are drawn to work where we live, but often one of two extremes prevails. Home workers either relax too much, giving most of their attention to home/family issues, or they become workaholics at home. It is easy for newer workers to squander time on unaccustomed, unrestricted domestic relaxation. When the day runs short, they hurry to squeeze in professional duties in too little time. Overzealous workers, on the other hand, cannot stop working at what they love. Quilting and sewing work is so accessible at home, they allocate most of their attention and energy to it and try to squeeze in domestic concerns in the time remaining. It is not surprising that families object to this, which then brings stress and resentment to the situation. Neither extreme works well. Both cause guilt, frustration, and a sense of underachievement. Making a clear distinction between home and business obligations is not easy. However, it is essential if one wants to succeed. Left unattended, the problem can get out of hand, lower our efficiency, increase frustration, and make us wonder if working from home is such a good idea after all. You bet it is! If we learn to give each task its due time, there is nothing better!\n\nMotivation and Self-Discipline The secret of success is to focus on who we are and what we do. We must then mix in a large dose of time management and self-discipline. We need a system to keep personal tasks separate from professional ones so we can still get it all done. But how?\n\nChapter 01.qxd 8/12/04 05:37 PM Page 4\n\n4 / M A K E M O N E Y Q U I LT I N G\n\nGet Your Tasks in Order Start with two sheets of paper. Label the first “Household Tasks,” the other, “Professional Tasks.” Over a week’s time, list every activity consuming your time on the proper sheet. Do not leave anything out if you want a realistic schedule. Check often to be sure you have not overlooked anything. Add activities you find yourself doing regularly that you overlooked when writing on the list. Observe Your Energy Level As You Work Identify your body’s “prime time.” When are you most alert and eager to work? What time of day does your energy peak? You will work more efficiently if you assign prime time and high-energy periods to income-producing tasks. Leave mindless tasks such as household cleaning or laundry for when your energy is low. Such tasks require less of you and may require you to learn to do home tasks at a different time of day from before you brought your career home to live. Schedule Your Work Week At the beginning of the third week, take another sheet of paper. Divide it into five vertical columns, one for each weekday. Fold this sheet in half horizontally to crease. Begin to prioritize from your master list. Distribute professional tasks evenly throughout the week on the upper section, and put homemaking tasks on the lower portion by writing them on the proper portion of the list. Remember your prime time as you pluck each activity from the master list. Schedule each day remembering there is no one watching you. Committed self-employed artists and quilters must motivate themselves. Try the new schedule for another week. At the end of a week, if you find you simply cannot accomplish everything on your list, you may be expecting too much from yourself. Modify your list. Delete the least important task from each section from each day. “I cannot,” you say, “I must do them all to succeed.” If this is the case, your schedule is telling you something. Perhaps you: ✦ ✦ ✦ ✦ ✦ ✦ ✦\n\nNeed help—hire someone, trade, or barter. Need less rest or recreation and more self-discipline. Are wasting time. Can combine the most mindless tasks together to gather new time. Are working at your low-energy periods. Are ignoring priority tasks during high-energy periods. Are permitting too many interruptions.\n\nSet a Work Schedule and Stick to It Effective schedules should represent realistic weekly goals. Modify them until the list is tailor-made for your energy level, lifestyle, and work requirements. Sticking to it will help you avoid leaving something undone at the end the week as you try to squeeze it all in. This creates only frustration—not saleable quilted products.\n\nChapter 01.qxd 8/12/04 05:37 PM Page 5\n\nTu r n i n g Yo u r H o b b y i n t o a B u s i n e s s / 5\n\nHere is a way to help you set up a work schedule and stick to it: Divide a sheet of paper in half vertically. List household and personal tasks on the left side of the paper in any order. List quilting and professional chores on the right side. Maintain the lists for a week until every activity that takes your time appears on one side or the other. Call this your first draft. 5. Next, divide another sheet of paper in half. Using your first draft, copy each household activity from the left side to the second draft in order of importance. Place the “must-dos” at the top. Continue adding tasks, ending with the mundane, least demanding jobs at the bottom. This list should account for every task, ranked in a sensible order. Repeat this process for your quilting and professional chores on the other side of the paper. You have before you a weekly schedule of tasks. Begin each day by tackling the chores that head each side of the lists. 1. 2. 3. 4.\n\nWorking on one week at a time keeps lists manageable. Check frequently to see if you are on schedule. If too many chores remain undone at the end of the week, either your list was unrealistically long, or you became waylaid or worked too slowly. Try eliminating the least important task from the bottom of each side and prepare a new work schedule for the following week. Learn to study your work schedule week by week. Do you meet your deadlines? Do you spend too much time on trivialities? Do you procrastinate? If you find yourself behind schedule, consider letting go of something less important in favor of a highly profitable task or one that moves your business forward. Distribute both personal and professional chores evenly throughout the week to avoid burnout. Balance slow, tedious tasks with those requiring more energy. Alternate sitting and standing jobs, and you may find you can work longer without tiring. Keep your eye on your schedule, making sure you do “first things first.” Post your finished work schedule on the refrigerator door for housemates to see. Post another copy in your work area. Educate friends and family who drop in unannounced because “you were home anyway.” We need to state to others assertively that although we are at home, we are working at our livelihood. This will give you, too, a clearer picture of your own dual roles. Work for pay during your prime time. Tell others and yourself, “I cannot watch TV now. I am at work.” If you walk by a wilted plant on your way to the coffeepot, don’t let it sabotage your schedule and cause you to fuss over all of your houseplants. Add a bit of water and say to your subconscious, “I am at work. Nothing short of emergencies will interrupt the life’s work I have chosen.” Then get back to your income-producing work. Teach your children how to tell when you are working and when you are available to them. Preschoolers and young children can learn easily if you use a kitchen timer at first. When they interrupt, tell them firmly that you are working and set the timer. Explain that when the bell rings, you will be available.\n\nChapter 01.qxd 8/12/04 05:37 PM Page 6\n\n6 / M A K E M O N E Y Q U I LT I N G\n\nEven a wait of ten minutes will begin to train children that you are there, but that instant gratification is not always possible. As they get older, you can stretch the time between bells. Tell older children what your time may mean to the family unit. For example: “I know you want to tell me your news right now, but I am working on a deadline. When I finish this project, I will earn three hundred dollars for our family budget, which will mean new shoes for you. I care about you and can give you my undivided time at four thirty. Okay?” Put a dollar value on your time. When tempted to stop work-for-pay to wander aimlessly in the house, ask yourself, “What is my time worth today? When I finish this quilt or write this pattern, I will have earned five hundred dollars. The next hour is worth fifty dollars to me. Do I want to trade fifty dollars for TV now?” It is you who must communicate to housemates, “I am sorry, I cannot stop now, I am working.” Answer the phone when it rings—but answering machines are better. When you are working, say so: “I am working on a deadline just now. May I call you back this afternoon, or is this evening better?” Workaholics, note: You are the other extreme of this problem. If your family comes to resent your work, set definite “open” and “closed” hours for your business. Here are some ideas: Buy a plastic clock with moveable hands, like the ones shop owners use. Start work on time and set the hands to closing time. Let your family know exactly when you will be available. Stop when you promised. ✦ If a real emergency exists, you can make exceptions, but too many emergencies signal an unfocused or unrealistic work schedule. Work on weekends or late into the night only when needed to avoid burnout. ✦ Set up a particular room in which to work, if possible. Assume the attitude that you are working for someone else when you enter this room. Allow no distractions; remove TVs and other diversions. ✦ Many of us have a set of work clothes, whether they are overalls, a suit, or jeans. If possible, put on an apron or place a towel in your back pocket. This “uniform” will announce to the world and yourself that you are working. Take the uniform off when you leave the workplace. This is a sign that you are granting permission for your worker (you) to eat lunch, get coffee, or rest. Make sure you are clear and focused about it. ✦ How long is lunch? Set a time and use it. This was a hard task for me to learn. I work from 8:00 AM to 9:30 PM. I can see the improvement in my stamina now that I take a whole hour for lunch. I leave my studio to eat. No more eating as I work. I watch the noon news and relax, but return to my studio at 1:00. As a workaholic, I have benefited from using self-discipline to rest, not to work more. ✦ Set a few rooms in the house where work is not done or discussed. Start with your bedroom and dining room. Save these places for relaxation and family or personal activities. ✦\n\nChapter 01.qxd 8/12/04 05:37 PM Page 7\n\nTu r n i n g Yo u r H o b b y i n t o a B u s i n e s s / 7\n\nYou may prefer to set a “quitting time,” such as 6:00 PM, when work is no longer the main event. Then, be attentive to your own needs and those of your family. ✦ I work Saturdays in my studio or office, but quitting time comes earlier than on weekdays. Sunday work is out except for very pressing matters. Time to relax and enjoy life, family, church, and friends. ✦ Set a regular time for exercise and physical fitness. Do it days or evenings, but do it at least three times per week. We workaholics tend to neglect our body’s needs in favor of working more. ✦ Set up a reward system for yourself. Remember, no employer will offer you incentives. If you finish earlier than expected one day, do not begin the next day’s duties. Take the extra time for something pleasing and relaxing. Read a book. Work in your garden. When you earn playtime, then play, or your inner self will soon conclude there is no payoff in accomplishment and your self-motivation may suffer. Recreation is your reward. Enjoy being at home when you have finished your work-for-pay. Consciously tell yourself your work is over for the day and assume your “at-home” role. ✦\n\nBear in mind that the ultimate goal of working from home is to lessen tensions and increase earnings. The best way to do this is through efficient work habits and a clear, well-maintained distinction between you the professional and you relaxing at home. Managing a home while conducting an efficient business challenges everyone. Doing so when you work where you live magnifies that challenge. Distractions wait around every corner. Telephones, doorbells, pets, and neighbors may search you out, saying, “But you’re home anyway.” Frequent interruptions from small children and other housemates can undo even the most organized work schedule. Thus, the secret to success for home-based crafters is to keep professional and personal worlds organized and well managed, but separate. Recently, professional quilt members belonging to a daily e-mail list, [email protected], wrote in asking questions about organizing their time better when working from home, and even more shared their tips and ideas. The common problem among these busy quilters concerned what to do about interruptions from others when working from home. Wheat Carr, a publisher of designer patterns and online list member, commented, “I believe that interruptions are not the problem; rather, they are the symptom. The problem is a lack of planned schedule and the discipline to stick to it. Once you have that in place, you can deal with interruptions with a ‘Sorry, but I am up against a deadline, talk to you later.’ The trick is to run your life on your schedule, not someone else’s.” Some people prefer to work all day on their business two or three days a week, and attend to personal or household tasks on the remaining days. Others work on business tasks until lunchtime and tend to home-related jobs during the afternoons. Still others work at their business all week and save household\n\nChapter 01.qxd 8/12/04 05:37 PM Page 8\n\n8 / M A K E M O N E Y Q U I LT I N G\n\nresponsibilities for the weekends. Choose the style that suits you, your energy level, and your family obligations. The important thing is to create a manageable work schedule, prioritize your chores, and prevent yourself from becoming waylaid. If you think this sounds like it takes discipline, you are correct. Managing your life, home, and quiltmaking business must be taken seriously if you wish to succeed. Continue to modify your work schedule until it suits your personality, work style, and responsibilities. Sooner or later, you will find the perfect schedule. Make it your regular routine. The purpose of all this is to become the best worker you can possibly be for your favorite employer—yourself!\n\nDefining and Achieving Your Goals Defining your goals is the first step in achieving them. Take time to outline your goals, comparing them frequently with your day-to-day activities. Spend most of your time working on the tasks that lead directly to your goals. Ask yourself why earning money from quilting is important to you. Do you want to contribute to your household income or start a savings account? Maybe you want to buy a new sewing machine or computer. Do you want money to buy unlimited quilting supplies? Finding answers to these questions will help you define your long-term goals. If you don’t know how much you want to earn or what an opportunity means to you, you may not become motivated enough to do your best. List your goals, being as specific as possible. Here are a few examples: You want to earn $3,000 to buy a new electronic sewing machine. You want to earn enough to buy all of the fabric and books you want. You want to earn enough to pay all your expenses to a major quilting seminar each year. Once you define your goals and are committed to them, post your goal list alongside your work schedule, where you can regularly check your progress. Each time you complete a goal, acknowledge it. Put a star beside it on your list or mark it with a highlighter pen. Create incentives (other than food) to keep yourself moving forward. Buy a piece of equipment you have been wanting, or take time to read a new quilting book. Give yourself a pat on the back so your subconscious mind feels acknowledged. Since you do not have an employer to praise you, you must reward yourself. Do some goals remain elusive? If so, avoid negative thinking. Determine the reason they are elusive. If the goal was too ambitious, simplify it. If you lacked motivation, ask yourself why. What got in your way? What can you do to improve next week?\n\nEntrepreneurial Characteristics You Should Have Working where you live, even part-time, becomes easier if you have or can develop a few special personality characteristics. According to the Small Business Administration (SBA), certain personality traits contribute more to success in business than the amount of money you invest.\n\nChapter 01.qxd 8/12/04 05:37 PM Page 9\n\nTu r n i n g Yo u r H o b b y i n t o a B u s i n e s s / 9\n\nSelf-motivation heads the list. This refers to the ability to work on specific chores without anyone prodding you to get started or to keep working. You must have the drive to keep yourself moving forward. Reliability comes next. Does procrastination derail you? Like Scarlett O’Hara, do you put off until tomorrow what you should do today? Do you only work when you feel like it? Do you often misplace things, only to find yourself searching for something you need but cannot find? If this describes you, step back and reconsider. Though procrastination may not disrupt your personal life, it contributes to the downfall of many entrepreneurs—part-time or full-time. The ability to cope is also important. To profit from your quilting skills, your customers and students must be able to depend on you. Do you come through in a pinch? If a time crunch occurs, how well do you cope? Successful entrepreneurs have contingency plans. They prepare for the unexpected and have a plan of action ready when it happens. Do you? The ability to prioritize is critical. Do you meet your deadlines? If you promise a finished quilt to a customer by the first of next month, do you stand behind your word? Meeting deadlines must take precedence over mundane matters such as organizing your fabric or designing your next project. If you develop the ability to rank tasks and deadlines in order of importance, you have won half the battle when working from home.\n\nTime Management Skills I have operated a home-based design and teaching studio for many years. The following tips help keep everything running smoothly. Students sometimes think I have a live-in maid or no family at all. Neither is the case. I owe my organizational thinking to a parochial school education, where orderly habits were part of the curriculum. It is never too late to implement better habits in your working life. Know Your Goals The purpose of using time more effectively is to gather what is wasted and put it to better use for something of value. What is important to you? Why is it important? Begin the organizing process by answering these two questions. Imagine yourself needing to travel out of state to give a lecture. Your destination is the goal. Earning income and broadening your contacts are the reasons the trip is important. If you do not know where you are going or why you are going, you may not have the motivation needed to keep moving toward your goals. And, if you do not know how much you will earn or what the opportunity means to your career, you may not become inspired enough to do your best. Serious quilters in the industry organize and plan an important business trip carefully. But how many of us give the same importance to planning our entire life’s work? As professionals, we owe it to ourselves to plan our entire career with as much care as we would give to planning one automobile trip to deliver an important lecture.\n\nChapter 01.qxd 8/12/04 05:37 PM Page 10\n\n10 / M A K E M O N E Y Q U I L T I N G\n\nOnce you have defined your goals and committed to them, do monthly reviews. Check your progress. Have you reached some of your goals? If not, be sure of the reason. If the plan was too ambitious, modify it. Set Your Priorities If goals are like the destination of your trip, priorities are road markers to get you there. Once you know your goals and commit to them, you can set sensible, attainable priorities. Using the example of the long car trip, your priorities would be prearranged stops for rest, food, and fuel along the way. Priorities are planned events leading directly to clearly stated goals, which in turn manage your work and your life. When you are clear about goals, setting priorities becomes even clearer. Whenever you are asked to take on something new, ask yourself this before answering: “Will this new activity lead me to my stated goals? If not, will I have time for it without sacrificing my goals and priorities?” Become focused on where you are going and how you will get there. Maintaining a strong focus helps to eliminate unnecessary distractions and respond to unexpected requests for your time. Then, you can be more confident when you say “no.” This is because you determined beforehand what particular activities would divert you from your planned goals and priorities. Treat your quilting activities like a business as you make the transition from hobby to profitable enterprise. Remember that the IRS expects you to make every effort to earn a profit if you want to deduct expenses. This requires financial organization and bookkeeping skills.\n\nGet It All Done with Action Boards and Monthly Action Lists Do you keep talking about the wonderful ideas you have to help your quilting business grow? Do you post little notes everywhere in your studio to remind you of what you want to do—someday? Stop procrastinating! Stop wishing you had time to carry out your ideas. Make them happen now. An effective technique to bring a new business to life, brainstorm for new ideas, or just problem-solve is the action board. Make your plans a reality with this simple, effective concept. Action boards work well for one person or several. Participants can be employees, your spouse, grown children, good friends, or anyone else who cares about your business success. Give each person a three-inch-square tablet of Post-Its. Begin by discussing exactly what you wish to achieve. Think specifics, not generalities. “Making more money” is too broad. Do you want to sell more products? Perhaps you want to increase foot traffic in your home-based shop. Do you want to see more of your quilting designs published in magazines? Do you want to teach more classes? Exactly what do you want to accomplish? Whether you work with others or alone, set a time limit of one week for brainstorming. Instruct all participants to take their little notepad everywhere they go, day and night. Ideas can come anytime, so be ready. Agree not to exchange notes or share information during this period.\n\nChapter 01.qxd 8/12/04 05:37 PM Page 11\n\nTu r n i n g Yo u r H o b b y i n t o a B u s i n e s s / 11\n\nEach person should write down only one idea per piece of paper. Look for every possible solution or action that may contribute to the agreed-upon objective. To be effective, do not dismiss any idea as too simple, obvious, or impractical. Set no limits on generating ideas. Do not listen to negative criticism from anyone. Do not prioritize the notes; instead, make time for this later. Just search your mind for every idea that can potentially lead your business toward its goal. At the end of a week’s time, the fun begins. Use a bulletin board, a wall, or a table. Have each person stick each little note face-up. Each participant should look over all the ideas. Eliminate any duplicate ideas, but nothing else! Now, begin to put all ideas in priority order. Move the notes around, placing the most promising ideas and those to consider at the top of the board. The advantage of those gummed little notes now becomes apparent. You can rearrange them as often as necessary. Look for the next-most useful idea and place it beneath the first. Continue in this way until all the ideas are in a rough priority order. Stand back and look them over. Take a few days to discuss all the possibilities offered by the group. If you work alone, use this time to consider all ideas. Rearrange the slips of paper into a new priority system as you think them through. It is surprising how many notions you can generate this way. Depending on the number of persons involved, creative energy can be doubled or tripled to benefit both the business and the owners. When people feel free to draw from their creativity unhampered by judgments from others, more ideas and solutions can surface. Evaluate each one on its own merit. Respect each other’s ideas and freely compliment the others on innovative thoughts and concepts you had never considered before. Rearrange the notes into a permanent priority order that everyone involved agrees upon. Now, with a pencil in hand, assign a deadline to each action. Set a starting date to begin the entire new system. Continue to date each slip of paper, allowing adequate time to complete each task. Erase and re-date as needed. Continue until everyone involved agrees with the new schedule and tasks are within practical reach. If more than one person helps with tasks in your business, go back over each slip. Distribute the responsibilities fairly. Do this by encouraging each person to choose one chore from among all of them. Bear in mind the areas in which each person is most competent. When each person has selected a task, begin round two. Allow each person to select again. Continue the process, alternating choices until all the tasks have been assigned. Have each person initial and date each chore for which he or she is responsible. When everyone is satisfied, transfer the information from the notes, in priority order, to a sheet of paper. At the bottom of the sheet, agree upon a date when all the tasks are to be completed and the new system for growth and improvement is to be in place. Have each participant sign and date the document. Place it where everyone will\n\nChapter 01.qxd 8/12/04 05:37 PM Page 12\n\n12 / M A K E M O N E Y Q U I L T I N G\n\nsee and refer to it often. Post copies on the refrigerator door, your office or studio door, on cupboards and bulletin boards. This will keep the ultimate goal of the business in the front of everyone’s conscious mind. It encourages everyone, whether you are a single quilter working alone or part of a team effort, to keep fixed on the objective and to work at it steadily. Cross off each task as it is completed, letting the person who brought it to completion initial and date the accomplished task. Compliment each other only on completed tasks. Avoid criticizing what remains undone. This will be obvious to everyone who looks at the list. Your Action List provides a monthly “to do” schedule. Tasks and chores appearing on the list should lead to both short- and long-term goals. Refer to it often. See at a glance what you have accomplished and what remains. Remember to think of the list as a daily itinerary to keep you on track, leading to your ultimate destination: a successful part- or full-time quilting career. Update your monthly list faithfully and you will never have the dilemma of remaining undecided about what to do next. Since your list ranks tasks by priority, you will always be able to decide immediately how to best spend your time and energy. I store and update my monthly Action List on my computer. Each month, I delete completed chores. I carry those left undone into the new month and print out a new copy. It sits on my desk in plain sight. During the month, I date each task as I finish it to indicate “mission accomplished.” Indeed, this type of self-awareness and recognition bolsters self-esteem. Think of each task you complete as a promise made and kept to the self, which results in self-assurance. Procrastination means breaking promises made to the self. If we indulge in it regularly, the resulting disappointment damages our self-esteem. Regular procrastination makes us feel as though we have failed. We lose self-confidence. We begin to question our ability to conduct a successful business. We weaken our sense of self-reliance. Inside, we feel cheated. We become our own worst enemies. Think of your Action List as an action plan that can become a marketing plan, a business plan, or simply a future growth plan for your teaching business. More about converting your Action List to a business plan can be found in chapter 2. The important issue is for spouses, partners, employees, and/or owners to cooperate in the project. Achieving the goals will benefit the business, while cooperation between participants will enhance relationships. This, in turn, encourages everyone’s resourcefulness and stimulates self-esteem. The business wins! The relationships win! CHAPTER CONTRIBUTOR:\n\nWHEAT CARR\n\ne-mail: [email protected]\n\nChapter 02.qxd 13/12/2004 06:38 PM Page 13\n\n2\n\nA Business Plan for Creative Quilters and Sewers\n\n“You have such talent! Why continue giving away your lovely quilts when you can sell them? Go into business. Turn your skill into cash!” Many professional quilters started their careers after being urged on by this familiar advice from friends and family. Affirmations and encouragement such as this are valuable. We treasure important people in our lives who sincerely praise and appreciate our skill. Yet, as you read in chapter 1, to succeed, you must clearly understand the difference between hobby and business. Entrepreneurs who believe that their quilting passion will substitute for business skills are in for a surprise. A quilter who opens a shop armed only with her love of fabric is heading for trouble. Enthusiasm matters, but it takes business skills to turn your hobby into a profitable business. Can you make the transition to seeing quilting as an income-earning opportunity rather than as a pleasant hobby? Can you set aside your personal tastes and preferences while you observe industry trends objectively? And the most critical question: Will you make a sincere effort to learn business essentials like marketing, bookkeeping, customer service, and product information? A good business plan will provide answers for all these questions.\n\nBusiness Plans Defined—Plan for Success Alice in Wonderland asks the Cheshire Cat, “Would you please tell me which way I should go from here?” The cat replies, “That depends on where you want to go, otherwise it does not matter which way you go.” A definition I like is: “The difference between a dream and a goal is a plan!” Often, when I ask students in my college classes if they have written a business plan, many assure me that they have. When I ask to see it, they tell me their business plan is in their head. Sorry, but if your business plan is not in writing, you have no plan! It shows you have not given your business top priority. My response to those wanting to start a business with no plan is to ask, “Without a plan, how will you measure success and recognize when you have met your goals?” Another typical response I receive from students and clients when asking about their business plan is: “I am just too busy to write out a business plan.” Here are some of my interpretations of the meanings behind that statement: I do not want to take time from making money for unimportant paperwork. My business is small. Business plans do not benefit me.\n\nChapter 02.qxd 13/12/2004 06:38 PM Page 14\n\n14 / M A K E M O N E Y Q U I L T I N G\n\nBusiness plans require writing. I cannot write. I am an artist, not a bookkeeper. Organize my business on paper? Why? I have no need for a loan, so why waste time writing? Who will read it anyway? My reply? The most important reader of your plan, the one who must scrutinize it regularly, is you!\n\nThree Reasons to Make a Business Plan First, writing a plan provides the invaluable experience of imprinting a picture of your business on your brain. Researching, gathering, and organizing information, putting it into a logical sequence, and typing and editing are all steps that will remain in your conscious and subconscious mind. Second, you will have an easier time making decisions when guided by the goals and priorities in your plan that you decided upon previously. Third, if you need a loan to start your business or to buy equipment later, you must have a business plan to present to a loan officer. And the one in your head is not acceptable. Employers, clients, agencies, and others who want to help or hire you, or bring business your way, may ask to see a business plan. Your CPA will use it to set up your books and assess your business at tax time too. A business plan is a detailed guide to plot the course of your business and to prepare for problems before they arise. A good plan provides goals and direction. Use it to measure the actual performance of your business when you compare what you planned with what actually happened. Business plans should: ✦ ✦ ✦\n\nAssess your ideas. Develop your point of view and marketplace niche. Help you set reachable goals in logical sequence.\n\nA Road Map to Success Imagine driving across the U.S. from coast to coast alone. Would you start your trip by merely backing your car out of the driveway on any random day? Do you find the destination so exciting that planning seems unnecessary? What does cruise control mean to you? Does it mean your car will take you where you want to go, automatically? Do the terms “positive thinking” and “hope for the best” sound like appropriate travel guides to you? Should you lose your way during your journey, how confident do you feel that someone will come to the rescue? Will all Good Samaritans who offer help be experts on your needs? Would you begin a long auto trip such as this prepared only with these thoughts in mind? Incredible as it sounds, many creative quilters start a new business with these concepts as their only tools. They begin their careers prepared only with a passion for their art and the wish to make a profit. They feel confident that their dedication will see them through any obstacle. They just cannot wait to\n\nChapter 02.qxd 13/12/2004 06:38 PM Page 15\n\nA B u s i n e s s P l a n f o r C r e a t i v e Q u i l t e r s a n d S e w e r s / 15\n\nbegin! They can be rather like novice quilters attending their first workshop. They do not want to listen to the preparatory instructions the teacher offers. They just have to start sewing immediately. Evaluating your business realistically and accurately, as I have already outlined, requires more thought than planning a cross-country trip. Driving from coast to coast will take only a few days or weeks out of your life, but a successful career can last a lifetime. To succeed in any business, especially one that others perceive as recreational, you must take control. Choose your own route. Make your own decisions. Leave nothing to chance. Three wonderful, efficient tools will help point you toward success: ✦ ✦ ✦\n\nAn Action Board. (You learned how to make one in chapter 1.) A Business Plan. A Marketing Plan. (See chapter 5.)\n\nYou have seen how the action board described at the end of the last chapter can help you gather and organize information. A marketing plan will help you aim your advertising and selling techniques by identifying your target market. A business plan becomes your customized road map to help assure your success. There is no magic, only hard work, dedication, and organization. Let us go back to the analogy of the coast-to-coast auto trip in chapter 1 again. Suppose you plan to attend an important quilt convention in New York and you live in California. You have been asked to serve on a panel to speak about your quilting patterns upon arriving. You value the networking opportunity and the chance to promote yourself and your business. Are you armed only with a mental business plan? If so, you would begin your trip with no road maps or advance reservations—just a travel plan in your head. No sense wasting time and paper planning. No time for choosing routes or locating overnight lodging. Instinct will guide you. Merely point your car east. Not to worry, you will feel your way as you go. Allow yourself several days to travel leisurely. If your first scheduled appointment looms forward too suddenly, you can drive faster. You want to be flexible, right? Just cut back a little on sleep and motivate yourself to cover more miles for the last day or two. Things will take care of themselves! “Attitude is the important thing,” you tell yourself. “Expect the best and fly by the seat of your pants. There will be plenty of time to solve problems when they occur. Why worry in advance?” Now, how many people would undertake a cross-country trip this way? Not I! How about you? Let’s make a plan. In fact, let’s dust off what we learned in junior high school about making formal outlines to organize ideas. You thought you would never need them in real life? Think again! The classic outline system is the perfect tool for creating a business plan for your new career. I’ve heard the saying, “If timing is everything, planning is everything else.” Many new business owners become intimidated when they first learn\n\nChapter 02.qxd 13/12/2004 06:38 PM Page 16\n\n16 / M A K E M O N E Y Q U I L T I N G\n\nthey should have a business plan. Think of it as a collection of notes, plans, and ideas to guide you in helping your business grow in the most profitable direction. If you apply for a business loan, however small, your banker will request a business plan, but this is not the only reason you should have one. Financial advisors and your tax preparer may want to see it too. However, I repeat emphatically, you are the most important person who will read your plan. Preparing the information and organizing and researching it provides you with practical direction in marketing, advertising, and bookkeeping. Theoretically, your plan will guide you as you make decisions, set policies, and make contingency plans. Think of it as a road map that will help you find your way through unfamiliar territory step by step. Business plans need not take weeks to prepare. Use common, everyday language. Go back to that class you took in eighth grade about making an outline to organize information. Those Roman numerals and capital letters form an easy, sensible way to gather and organize your information. I have prepared dozens of business plans for those who do not type or do not have access to a computer, and I always use them. Copy my business plan headings below and begin to fill in the blanks as you read this book. Complete each heading as thoroughly as possible. Do not assume every reader of your plan will know all the nuances of your business. Tell them concisely and precisely in your plan. Skip all sections that do not apply to you or for which you have no answers yet. Just begin. Expand my outline as you add information into your computer. It is only an empty outline now, but will become a map you refer to as you plan your coast-to-coast auto trip. Think of it as a living document or business journal where you will make entries every day. You will learn more answers to round out your outline in the chapters to come. Don’t worry about things you don’t know now. Start with what you do know. I will be throwing a lot of information at you in this book. Use it! Organize it! Research what you don’t know, and the first draft of your business plan will begin to emerge.\n\nA Business Plan Outline for You I. Title Page Begin with a title page stating that the following contents are a “Business Plan” for: (name your business, e.g., Mary’s Quilting Studio). Two inches from the bottom left, place your own name, address, phone, fax, and e-mail. II. Table of Contents When you have completed your plan, create a table of contents that lists in sequence all of the categories of information and their page numbers. Make sure to number each page of your plan.\n\nChapter 02.qxd 13/12/2004 06:38 PM Page 17\n\nA B u s i n e s s P l a n f o r C r e a t i v e Q u i l t e r s a n d S e w e r s / 17\n\nIII. Executive Summary In one or two pages, present a brief overview of the entire plan. You may find it easier to do this after you have completed it, but nonetheless, it is the first section of a formal, written business plan. The executive summary of a business plan should not be a mere listing of topics contained in the body of the business plan. That describes the table of contents. The executive summary should emphasize the key issues presented in the plan. A critical point to communicate in the executive summary is your company’s distinctive competence—the factors that will make your company successful in a competitive market. IV. Mission Statement Explain why you chose your business and how you feel about it. Express enthusiasm about your craft and why you believe it will suit you and lead to business success. One or possibly two pages are enough here. V. Legal Structure State whether you run your business as a sole proprietorship, a partnership, or a corporation. If you chose a fictitious name for your business, note it. You must use both your first and last name in your business name, or file a Fictitious Name form with the County Clerk’s Office in the county you reside in. More about this in chapter 13. VI. Owner Information State who owns your business, with your address and phone number. If it is a partnership, include this information for each person involved, but not for employees. This information is required on all Fictitious Name forms to comply with full disclosure about your business. VII. Personal History List your qualifications and experience here. Include a copy of your résumé in this section. Include past business experiences you have had that qualify you to begin or expand your business. Include formal education and a synopsis of quilting workshops and education you bring to your business. If you have been published or had any articles written about you, include several (not an overwhelming number) here as well. VIII. Type of Business The terms “crafts” or even “quilting” are too general to describe your business. Explain whether you are manufacturing, wholesaling, retailing, exhibiting, designing, or writing about quilting. Describe the nature of your business completely. Quilting may be your passion, but readers of your plan need to know what quilters and craftspeople do. I identify myself as a fiber artist when introducing myself to new college classes. For many years, I have noted that\n\nChapter 02.qxd 13/12/2004 06:38 PM Page 18\n\n18 / M A K E M O N E Y Q U I L T I N G\n\nno one really knows what this means until I explain it. Explain it in your business plan as if the reader knows nothing about it. IX. Product Description Describe your product. Include photographs, color ads, and fliers. Quilters who will perform services may conclude this section does not apply to them, but it does. Your service is your product. If you quilt, design, finish, bind, or restore quilts, explain! X. Company Background If you are starting a business from scratch, delete this section. However, if you are expanding or modifying an existing business, provide background information about the company, followed by the proposed changes. XI. Business Objective Do not be tempted to write “Make a profit” as your objective. Every business wants a profit. Perhaps your goal is to create a new fusible paper. Maybe you have a new system for writing instructions. Do you want to expand your teaching from local shops and schools to a national or international level? If so, state your purpose clearly. XII. Product Benefits Completing this section will be of tremendous importance when you begin to write advertising copy for your new business. State the benefits of your product or service from the point of view of consumers. Will learning become easier for them? Will your new textile paint dry faster? Are your patterns easier to follow than others? XIII. Marketing Plan Coming up in chapter 5. XIV. Implementation Startup Timetable Create a timeline of dates, proposing when each task will be completed. XV. Budget Proposal, Funds Required, and Their Uses List exactly how much money you need to begin and how you will use it. XVI. Monthly Expenses Make out a budget listing all expected expenses. XVII. Cash Flow Statement Show how much you expect to earn and how you will balance earnings with your business expenses.\n\nChapter 02.qxd 13/12/2004 06:38 PM Page 19\n\nA B u s i n e s s P l a n f o r C r e a t i v e Q u i l t e r s a n d S e w e r s / 19\n\nXVIII. Prior Cash Flow Statement Provide your actual Cash Flow Statement from the previous year, if you were already in business. XIX. Proprietary Rights Coming up in chapter 14. A. Copyrights B. Trademarks C. Patents XX. Industry Data Support the wisdom of starting your new business by offering an overview of the industry. I remember a client who asked me to prepare her business plan to sell beaded products for the sewing and quilting trade. I asked who else was making this specific bead item. She replied that no one else had thought of her idea (not true!), and that everyone would want to buy her product (far from true!). The woman knew nothing about the industry she was entering. She was beginning a new business venture with only one thought in mind: how much she loved the product. Lack of knowledge leads to lack of preparation, which in turn leads to failure. Prove your preparation and industry awareness by answering the following questions: How many people quilt in the U.S.? How many magazines are published? Perhaps you can find figures on how many quilters purchase their raw materials from mail-order catalogs as opposed to the Internet. Do many quilters in your field of expertise teach classes? How big is each portion of the industry? You don’t know? Study the trade journals in your field and find out! Include statistics and other relevant information about quilting, sewing, and the crafting business in general. You will find such information in quilt magazines and craft trade journals. Pretend that you must justify to someone else why you have chosen the quilting business. Support your choice by including copies of articles, reports, and surveys. Make sure you include information about the quilting industry survey as issued every third year. The most recent The Quilting in America™ Survey: Commissioned by: Quilter’s Newsletter Magazine a Primedia Publication & International Quilt Market & Festival, a division of Quilts, Inc., Prepared by: NFO, Inc. and ABACUS Custom Research, Inc. See chapter 4 for survey details. XXI. Other Supportive Data and Attachments This is the last section in a business plan. It is the place in your business plan to insert photocopies of magazine articles about your industry. Choose a variety from business magazines, trade journals, and consumer publications, and make your case to support your decision as if you were an attorney!\n\nChapter 02.qxd 13/12/2004 06:38 PM Page 20\n\n20 / M A K E M O N E Y Q U I L T I N G\n\nAre you feeling a bit overstimulated? Good! Get started today to reach your dream of earning dollars in exchange for your quilting skills! I hope you take my advice and copy my basic outline for your business plan into your computer. I have prepared business plans for many clients using this outline, expanding it to as many as fifty pages as I learned more about the client’s business. I learned about importing shellfish, selling bicycles, and buying a music shop. If I learned about subjects I knew little to nothing about before I began, think of what you will learn about how to start up, operate, and profit from your quilting business when you do know something about it already. Now that you have seen the bare outline, other chapters in this book will provide you with the details you need to help you expand it until it becomes a plan you can proudly present to a bank or an investor.\n\nChapter 03.qxd 13/12/2004 06:37 PM Page 21\n\n3\n\nDesigning for the Quilting and Sewing Market\n\nQ\n\nuilting today is BIG business! The latest Quilting in America study (2003, www.quiltersvillage.com/qinamer03/), says, “The market continues to grow, with 15 percent of U.S. households reporting quilting participation. Total quilters in the U.S. now exceed 21 million, a 50 percent increase from the 14 million quilters reported in 1997. With each quilter spending an average of $139.70, the estimated total dollar value of the quilting industry stands at $2.27 billion.” Travel to Houston every October to see the International Quilt Market— the largest trade show in the world for the quilting industry. Shop owners, teachers, writers, designers, and manufacturers come from all over the world to buy from more than six hundred merchant booths. Quilters demand more tools, books, and patterns every year. Quilt addicts cannot seem to buy enough quilting patterns, which is why those who make patterns have a chapter in this book to themselves.\n\nDefining Original Design Webster’s Dictionary defines “o•rig•i•nal” as: 1. Arising or proceeding independently; inventive. 2. Created, undertaken, presented for the first time. From the same source, “de•sign”: 1. To prepare preliminary plans to execute a work. 2. To plan and fashion artistically or skillfully. 3. To form or conceive in the mind; contrive; plan. Manufacturers, magazine editors, and buyers eagerly seek designs from talented newcomers. However, submitted designs must be original. An item is not original if it is: ✦ ✦ ✦ ✦\n\nMade from a kit or variations Made from a commercial pattern or variations Made as a workshop project with input from a professional teacher Made following instructions from a magazine\n\nChapter 03.qxd 13/12/2004 06:37 PM Page 22\n\n22 / M A K E M O N E Y Q U I L T I N G\n\n✦ ✦ ✦\n\nCopied from a copyrighted design, pattern, or work of another Copied from an existing project Copied from a pattern, object, or instructions, but containing different colors, dimensions, or other changes\n\nOriginality means so much to editors who buy designs that, early in negotiations, they ask you to sign a document verifying that your work originated with you. Changing one or two elements of an existing design does not constitute “original” design. Literature on copyright infringement defines this practice as “making derivative copies.” Only the original copyright holder may profit from modifications of the original design. Copyright law prevents others from doing so. Penalties severely damage the career of quilters who violate these statutes. Look around you for ideas for original designs. Nature overflows with them. Start your next project from the very beginning, as defined by Webster’s. Begin with your own drawings, charts, photos—not the work of others. More about copyright can be found in chapter 14. Editors and manufacturers who buy your work may buy “all rights.” This means you cannot sell an original design a second time without permission. When possible, try to sell only “first rights.” This means you offer a magazine the right to publish the design for the first time, with all rights reverting to you after publication.\n\nSelling a Design More than Once Since you are the only person who can make derivative copies and variations based upon your designs, you may continue to profit from your original pattern—as long as you do not sell all rights. If you sell all rights, the person who will be able to make derivatives of the pattern and make a profit will be the buyer—not you. Below are twelve ways in which I profited from a pair of geometric designs embroidered on canvas. From the time I began work on these 12 12 projects, the reactions from others indicated they might become very popular. “Warm as Gold” and “Cool as Silver” are both embroidered with silk floss and metallic threads. Both starburst designs feature an unworked background backed by foil paper so that a glow shows beneath the canvas holes. Both use identical stitching patterns and are exactly the same size. “Warm as Gold” begins with gold thread in the center followed by the gradated, warm colors of the color wheel. “Cool as Silver,” conversely, begins with silver thread followed by cool colors. This pair generated more income than any other work I have created before or since. Each piece cost $12 for threads and canvas, plus $8 for each frame. Revenues exceeded $4,000 in just one year. Note that I did not receive complimentary supplies or endorsement fees, as I was a relatively no-name teacher at the time. Here is how to extract all the profit potential from a solitary design.\n\nChapter 03.qxd 13/12/2004 06:37 PM Page 23\n\nD e s i g n i n g f o r t h e Q u i l t i n g a n d S e w i n g M a r k e t / 23\n\n1. Write a how-to article so readers can make the project. The magazine that purchased my designs “Warm as Gold” and “Cool as Silver” bought first rights. After publication, in a needlepoint magazine, rights reverted to me. 2. Write an article about an aspect of the design process. Many magazines feature in-depth articles about a single aspect in a work without publishing a complete set of instructions. I wrote an article about how I used a color wheel to select the careful gradations I chose to create special effects. 3. Place a classified ad in craft magazines and sell the item in a kit format by mail order. Many excellent crafters do not have an interest in or inclination to design their own projects, preferring work designed by others. 4. Sell the completed item by mail order to customers who do not craft. Home decor items appeal to a broad market, and many people buy readymade crafts. If you have a surge of orders, enlist the help of people who can help you produce enough products to satisfy demand. 5. Rent a booth at craft shows, trade shows, or fairs. Sell completed projects or take orders to do custom work. 6. Give demonstrations to interested groups to generate interest in your work. Distribute brochures listing your line of goods and services. When I did this, I was hired to judge a show nearby. 7. Attend a street fair so others can observe you at work. I accepted an invitation to participate in an outdoor craft fair. The show featured local artists at work. I displayed my pair of matched designs as I worked on others. This resulted in teaching assignments and custom orders. 8. Give a workshop to help others make their own version of the item, teaching them basic skills. Teachers need appealing designs to inspire others wanting to learn specific techniques. 9. Write a project booklet giving complete instructions, drawings, and photos to recreate the item. Sell the booklet in shops, classes, or by mail order. 10. Enter exhibits and fairs where you can advertise your piece for sale. 11. When you feel a design has no more income-earning potential, give it as a deductible donation in a raffle or door prize. Such visibility becomes a profitable marketing tool. 12. Wait several years and do it again. In my example, the designs were first published in 1979, but in 1992, the magazine asked permission to reprint the original article and instructions for a slightly reduced price. I happily agreed.\n\nColor and Design Trends I love the coloring books published by Dover Publications and other publishers meant for doodling and coloring with felt pens. I have countless such books, showing flowers, birds, butterflies, and my favorites, stained-glass designs. Dover Books has a Pictorial Archive Series that is copyright-free, so you may use their designs in any way you like. Add a color wheel, or preferably several, to your quilting supplies. They contribute the most to successful, original designs. Keep up with color trends\n\nChapter 03.qxd 13/12/2004 06:37 PM Page 24\n\n24 / M A K E M O N E Y Q U I L T I N G\n\nby checking in with the Color Marketing Group and others on the Web (www.colormarketing.org). One of the joys of designing lies in choosing and playing with colors. Consider the Color Association, which keeps you current with the latest color trends in their free e-bulletin, Colorful. You can sign up for a free subscription at www.colorassociation.com/site/mailinglist.html. Another site I check on often is Pantone, www.pantone.com/pantone.asp. Color and design books by international colorist Johannes Itten are simply the best resource for color theory. I cannot live without them. Since color and design are such vast topics, you will find dozens of books and Web sites to research, but for the moment, let us return to our prime subject in this chapter—designing.\n\nShould You Design Only What Is Highly Profitable? Quilt hobbyists usually begin designing to please the self, while professionals spend their time designing items with the greatest profit potential. Sooner or later, both groups face a common dilemma. Should a quilter make endless potholders, for example, because customers always snatch them up at craft fairs? How many can one manufacture before the definition of “handcrafted” becomes “handmade by assembly line?” More questions arise. “Will I burn out by overproducing a particular item just because it pays the bills? Will buyers hesitate if they see too many identical products? Might they conclude that the uniqueness of such an item is compromised?” On the other hand, the artist within us frequently demands self-expression. If we use all our energy to work and never “play,” frustration follows. “I work so hard that I never have time to make what I want anymore,” successful artisans lament. “I do not want to feel like a production machine.” It takes discipline to keep working on a product that bores you. Must we personally like everything we create for sale? Does quality suffer when we push ourselves to work with colors or textures that we no longer find pleasing? When do we get to have fun? While I do not presume to have all the answers, I have a few suggestions that may help you face this dilemma. First, why must it be one way or the other? Crafters of all types often conclude that they must either mass-produce sure-to-sell pieces or earn less if they take time out to explore their medium. “How can I preserve my integrity as an artisan and maintain enthusiasm?” they wonder. Why not compromise and make room for both profit and nurturing the artist within?\n\nProtect the Artist Within If, like me, you are concerned with the possible burnout of your creativity by making too many identical products or spending 100 percent of your time producing, consider my solution. Determine how many hours per month you work at your craft. Set aside a portion of total work time to produce the items that pay the bills, say, 80 percent or 85 percent. Reserve the remaining time to\n\nChapter 03.qxd 13/12/2004 06:37 PM Page 25\n\nD e s i g n i n g f o r t h e Q u i l t i n g a n d S e w i n g M a r k e t / 25\n\nnurture your creativity. Many argue, “How can I justify setting aside so much time that does not generate dollars?” My answer? Look at the benefits you will reap by allocating time for research and experimentation. If you think of it as “wasting time,” guilt and frustration may follow. Creative time spent developing my technique encourages artistic growth. It is not unproductive simply because it does not directly generate income. Creative time generates style, skill, expertise, proficiency, and facility. In short, it nourishes the artist within. Here are a few of the ideas I use during my “creative time.” ✦ ✦\n\nVisit museums and galleries. Go through every magazine you can. Tear out pages that inspire you. I used an ad in a motoring magazine for an interesting vanishing point, and the cover of a church hymnal inspired the colors and flowing shapes in a wall quilt. ✦ Manufacturers send me new products. I would never have had access to new products such as new bonding agents, textile paints, and embellishments without the generosity of manufacturers who send complimentary products to designers like me. I experiment to see how I might use them in future designs. ✦ Buy spools of thread in weights and colors you usually do not buy to see how they behave in your sewing machine with different stitch settings. ✦ I dye fabric scraps and old clothes to observe how the dyes mix or what new colors and variations I can achieve. Dyeing my own fabric scraps provides an endless supply of unusual colors over prints or solids, which in turn end up in my quilts.\n\nThe Importance of Playing with New Materials Creative time provides an opportunity to explore new design concepts. It provides a chance to experiment with new materials—to familiarize yourself with the latest fibers, colors, styles, tools, and fabric, of course. Playing with fabric, color, and thread provides the opportunity for serendipity—a booster shot for your career. Time spent broadening one’s skill results in improved quality for future sales. End guilt by telling yourself that you assigned this time to develop and nourish your artistic integrity. Think of it as maintenance time for your most valued machine—yourself. Professional quilters, at times, may encounter another problem. Sometimes we find that after creating “special pieces,” it is too painful to part with them. Again, compromise. If the artist knows that not everything created from the heart will be sold for dollars, the inner self will feel satisfied. When we guarantee that we will occasionally make an item for ourselves, we feel better. We find it easier to sell most items if we know we can keep a few favorites.\n\nChapter 03.qxd 13/12/2004 06:37 PM Page 26\n\n26 / M A K E M O N E Y Q U I L T I N G\n\nQuilting for profit does not mean you must ignore your own creative needs. Both aspects can live in harmony if each receives respect and its own scheduled time. Moderation in the creative process provides balance. Thus, we can avoid feeling too commercial, frivolous, self-indulgent, or worse, and ultimately, we can fend off burnout.\n\nNourish Your Creativity Do you believe creativity is learned or innate? Is one simply born with or without it? I believe strongly that not only can we learn it, but we must also study and develop our design ability. Creativity does not begin on paper, from a book, or with raw materials. It begins in the right side of the brain, which houses our creative self. Here is how I see the process: First, relax your body so your mind can begin to visualize. The mind projects its ideas on a mental screen and begins the process of organizing images. Next, begin to make choices. Drop some ideas in favor of others. For example, ask yourself, “What do I want my hands to make?” You may reject choices such as pottery, chocolate cakes, and floral arrangements if fascinated by fabric and thread. Continue to narrow your choices. “What will satisfy the creative urge?” the mind asks. One more wall hanging, a bed quilt, a quilted garment? The body may remain still while the brain races along. Creating a new project requires you to select from available design elements. Once the brain chooses a project, it continues questioning. Do I want a contemporary or traditional design? Have I ever seen anything like it before? Can I capture the colors I see in my garden flowers? In a rainbow? In the bricks and stones of a building? Do I want a romantic mood full of curves and diagonal lines, or a classic design emphasizing vertical, horizontal, and geometric shapes? What style will I express? Victorian, casual, elegant, country? In short, the next phase of creativity is refining your choices based on preferences and personal interpretation. Finally, call upon your body. Hands need to feel textures and other materials you might use. Await just the right “feel” envisioned by the mind. Eyes examine color and proportion. Quilters begin to gather fabric to bring to reality what began as an abstraction. Many fiber artists state that the raw materials, once in hand, can suggest the direction of the design. Jokes about how much quilters love their fabric stash fill magazines, quilt shows, and Internet quilt digests. Quilters must have as comprehensive a stash as possible! At last, when they feel their fabric stash is as large and varied as possible, they begin to create, inspired and led by their fabric collection. The artist feels compelled to stretch the possible uses of available materials. We may notice two colors that accidentally came to lie beside each other. Perhaps we never considered combining them, but there they are, right before our eyes!\n\nChapter 03.qxd 13/12/2004 06:37 PM Page 27\n\nD e s i g n i n g f o r t h e Q u i l t i n g a n d S e w i n g M a r k e t / 27\n\nCreative minds, always prowling for new impressions, record the textures, lines, and colors the eyes see. Our brains grab ideas from everywhere and file them for future use. Hands and mind eventually begin to work together. The mind, with its idea in place, commands the hands to begin. We begin to choose, cut, and lay out patterns and shapes. The selection process continues as hands check in with the real control— the creativity center in the brain. “Is this what I had in mind when I saw that garden, or was it this?” “Does this feel right, or should I try something else?” Observe everything around you. Your mind will translate your experiences and impressions into your own art form. If you listen to your inner self, without fear of failure, creativity will come through. Not only that, but with each creation, the artist within improves and matures. Next time, you will have even more to draw from with additional self-confidence, thanks to your recently completed project. As you add finishing touches, you begin to feel a sense of completion as you realize you have made something come into being that did not exist before. You have created a design!\n\nHow to Maintain a Stream of Ideas “Designer’s Block”—we fear the term. Magazine editors or customers may request a design idea, and you draw a blank. Other times, you may begin a project, only to bog down in the middle, unable to continue. What can you do? Plan for such eventualities, for they are sure to come. Look for ideas that can serve as a springboard to stimulate and inspire original work. Magazines offer a plethora of ideas. Look for ads that combine colors in an unusual way. Look at models, but not only their clothing; examine their jewelry and accessories too. Home decor magazines offer a wealth of ideas. I once knit a coat inspired by floor tiles in a Middle Eastern mosque.\n\nComments from Professional Designers about Selling Patterns and Designs Developing quilt patterns differs from making and selling quilts. “Labor intensive” is the term for the hard work required before actual production of patterns begins. Designers do not begin to make a profit until a given number of copies has been sold. Many designers add up all overhead costs per month or per year and divide that by the number of copies they hope to sell in that period. Once they have a production price per copy plus overhead costs per copy, they can begin to compare the result with prices of competitive products to arrive at a profit margin. Designers who sell their patterns independently have more than one market from which they can profit. Many designers sell both at wholesale to distributors, and to consumers at retail as well. A successful designer whose business is now full-time comments, “Since wholesale and distributors figure their cost on your suggested retail price, they must know what discounts\n\nChapter 03.qxd 13/12/2004 06:37 PM Page 28\n\n28 / M A K E M O N E Y Q U I L T I N G\n\nwholesalers and distributors expect before designers can set a retail price for each pattern. Wholesalers expect a 50 percent discount on the retail price when they buy a minimum number of patterns. Distributors expect to pay less than required by wholesalers. They pay 50 percent less 30 percent (or 20 percent) from retail. This means most designers must work backward and at least double the actual cost of the pattern when selling to distributors.” Barbara Vlack, quilt teacher, designer, lecturer, and author, comments on the business of patterns and those who design them. “It takes lots of time and money on the production end. Many pattern designers I know do not act as their own publishers or distributors, thereby earning at least a percentage of a pattern’s retail price. Pattern publishers, wholesalers, and retailers make the most per pattern—more than designers themselves who receive only royalties, even though they have overhead and other costs,” she explains. “When we buy shops or produce patterns, we cross the line from quiltmaking as a hobby to a professional level. Demand for our services exists, and we should all earn a fair price,” says Barbara. “Quilting would not be the big business it is today if we all worked just because we loved quilting. The industry has grown because it supports those who choose as a profession teaching, designing, and producing quilt goods and tools.” Barbara asks, “What is fair compensation, minus production costs, to a designer for the anticipated sale of 500 patterns that have a successful run? Do not think of the cost of a pattern with the idea that it took ten cents per page to copy. After all, calico used to sell for fifty cents per yard and dress patterns cost thirty-five cents. We must advance our thinking in today’s market terms.” Trudie Hughes, a well known and respected shop owner, buys paper piecing patterns for her shop. “I feel dismay with the quality of some patterns received in my shop,” she says. “Recently, I picked up new pattern companies to sell in my shop, and I have been making models according to the pattern maker’s directions. It amazes me how much new homegrown pattern companies want for their patterns. Yet when I read and follow the directions, I find many errors in patterns, whether or not they are typeset, improperly illustrated, or, worst of all, unsatisfying to customers,” she declares. “For example, I made up a paper piecing design that appeared attractive in the photograph, but the numbers were not in proper sequence, with some missing altogether. Though the pattern was printed in color on lightweight paper, which is usually an advantage, a customer could only use this design one time, as the layout sheet had to be cut up to make the pattern. The price? Twelve dollars for a tiny design. “Another pattern company sent an attractive brochure requesting thirtyfive dollars for shipping. We ship every day and know that forty-eight patterns do not cost that much to ship. This new company does not have a distributor, so if we want its patterns, we must pay inflated costs. For that price, we prefer to sell a book that looks more professional,” she says. Another shop owner offers advice for new pattern designers and writers. “Provide buyers with clear, step-by-step instructions to ensure success,\n\nChapter 03.qxd 13/12/2004 06:37 PM Page 29\n\nD e s i g n i n g f o r t h e Q u i l t i n g a n d S e w i n g M a r k e t / 29\n\nencouraging repeat customers. Patterns should be written so novices can use them. Test your patterns in classes or among quilting friends. Make your instructions complete and accurate. Have your pattern reviewed or edited prior to publication to identify areas that need clarification. Taking these steps will help satisfy buyers that your pattern is worth the price they pay.” A designer with ten years of experience in selling her patterns says, “I researched patterns to learn how to price my patterns, so that I can price them competitively. I am concerned about poorly written patterns. Quality control should be the pattern writer’s major concern. I have a kind friend who edits my patterns. She is so careful that I know when she has studied my pattern, it will work! “Pattern writing is time-consuming, but when I look at a quilt that someone made using one of my patterns, I get a great feeling. Yet I still must cover production expenses and earn a profit for my work. Designers should not demand high prices for a simple appliqué block containing only a six-by-eight-inch piece of muslin. Perhaps quilt store owners should refuse those overpriced patterns and let pattern producers know that their patterns are too expensive.” Ann Anderson has been designing, publishing, and distributing patterns for six years, and also distributes a book on how to publish patterns. She says, “Shops mark up a pattern at least 100 percent, so if the retail is $8, the shop buys it for $4. The remaining $4 is split 30–70 between the distributor and the designer. This means $1.20 goes to the distributor, leaving the designer with $2.80 from an $8 pattern. “Covers need color, and if you print your own, the cost can be 30 to 50 cents. Sending covers out to be printed reduces the cost per cover to 10 cents or less, but may have an up-front cost of several hundred dollars, as it does not make sense to print less than 1,000. Black-and-white pattern pages generally cost between 3 and 6 cents per sheet. Plastic hanging bags cost 2 to 3 cents. Folding and stuffing, another 5 to 10 cents. If a pattern contains 10 sheets, the total cost to produce the pattern could range from 50 cents to $1,” Ann explains. Ann advises designers to consider the labor it takes to produce patterns, including the final printing arrangements. Most designers use a computer and graphics software costing as much as $700, plus expensive color printers. Designers must amortize these costs and consider design time, time for making one or more samples, and hiring someone to proof the completed pattern. Designers incur costs for advertising, promotion, and marketing. To answer the question, “How does a person determine the value of intellectual content in a design?” Ann replies, “From my experience, I know it takes a long time to work out a design, then write the pattern. It is tedious work, with much rechecking of figures and measurements.” She reminds readers to consider the amortized cost of equipment, office costs, communications, advertising, show costs, and unsold inventory. Designers must sell a large number of copies of each pattern before seeing much profit,” says Ann. Jo Morton of Prairie Hands Patterns in Nebraska comments about minimum costs and shipping charges for her design patterns. “I have patterns\n\nChapter 03.qxd 13/12/2004 06:37 PM Page 30\n\n30 / M A K E M O N E Y Q U I L T I N G\n\nhandled by distributors, but after four years of adding new patterns, I found some shops do not carry my full line. I decided to implement changes with the shop owner in mind. After a shop opens an account with me (a total of twelve patterns in multiples of three), I no longer require minimums on reorders, and I do not charge for shipping. My minimum order is only nine patterns,” Jo explains. “I do not charge for shipping so that I do not have to give the distributor a discount, and that amount more than covers shipping charges,” she adds. “If I were a shop owner, I would appreciate such cooperation. I considered both sides carefully before implementing this policy, and it has worked out very well, a win-win situation. We are all partners in this wonderful industry. My policy has not slowed distributor pattern orders. They keep growing.” Christine Tresch focuses on another aspect of pattern designing. “Quilting, pattern designing, and the Internet brought several of my interests together,” she says. “I designed a pattern and placed it on my Web site. People liked my designs, so I made more. In 1996, I expanded my Web site to include my own domain name. Mine was one of the first quilting pattern sites on the Web. “Deciding to sell quilt patterns is one of the best decisions I’ve ever made. Capturing the elusive idea and getting it on paper, followed by creating the design in cloth, excites me. I enjoy the work between the idea and the finished product. Some designs have taken years to bloom, and others have come in a flash and entered the market in just a few months. Designing patterns may have many tedious steps, but they are all part of the job, and very worthwhile for me.” Alice Lynch designed and published her first pattern, “Collector’s Christmas Tree,” in 1990. “I have creative freedom publishing my own designs, and can work at my convenience from home,” she says. “I began my design business by printing my patterns at a local copy shop. I traded the shop owner a custom wall quilt for copy services—a good move for me at the time. “My first covers were photographs stuck with double-sided tape to card stock,” she explains. “I shot my own photos and still do. Later, I had them commercially printed as four-color glossies, but ran into problems when my address changed. Reasonably priced color printers and better photo software brought me to the point where I am today, printing my own covers as needed. I use bright white heavy ink-jet paper and get very good results. “I advise new designers to follow their own instincts, not just market trends. I sold my banner patterns before the current trend in stained glass appliqué, but did not sell well until Clover"
