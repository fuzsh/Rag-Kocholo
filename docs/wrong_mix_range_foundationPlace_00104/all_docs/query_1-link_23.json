Since 1994, she has owned Sandia Consulting Group and Watermelon Mountain Web Marketing in Albuquerque, New Mexico. (Sandia is Spanish for watermelon.} Her previous companies provided a range of services including video production, grant writing, and linguistic engineering R&D. Jan's Web marketing clients at Watermelon Mountain are a living laboratory for experimenting with the best techniques for Web success in site design, content development, word-of-Web marketing, search engine optimization, and offline integration. Ranging from hospitality and tourism to retail stores, B2B suppliers, trade associations, and service companies, her clients have unique marketing needs but share similar business concerns and online challenges. Her consulting practice keeps Jan aware of the real-world issues facing small- business owners and provides the basis for her pragmatic marketing advice. Throughout her business career, Jan has been a prolific writer. She has written four editions of another book about marketing on the Internet, as well as the books Doing Business with Government Using EDI and Mainstreaming Sustainable Architecture. Her concern about the impact of technological development on women's needs led to her book Once Upon the Future and an anthology, The Technological Woman. The writer of numerous articles and a frequent speaker on Web marketing topics, Jan has long been fascinated by the intersection of business, technol- ogy, and human beings. In her spare time, she crews for a hot air balloon as a way to get her feet off the ground. Jan can be reached at books@watermelonweb . com or www . watermelonweb . com. dedication In Loving Memory Aunt Ceil For lessons taught and laughter shared DropBooks Author's Acknowledgments DropBooks affonv. is of a writer, locked in a cell alone with her computer and literary agony, is a myth — at least for nonfiction. This book could not have been written without a cast of dozens, especially researcher Diane Martin, who did a mammoth job of organizing information. She provided background files, compiled sites for the many tables in this book, and rooted out arcane online facts, often at the last minute. Working on my truly crazy schedule, Diane checked thousands of links and reviewed hun- dreds of sites for screen shots. Not many people are asked to search the Web for a good site index. Diane interviewed companies for the Real World stories with genuine interest and skill. Finding those companies — and clearing copyrights for them — required endless calls and e-mail. The staff at Watermelon Mountain Web Marketing supplemented her efforts, drawing on their extensive knowledge of the Internet to suggest sites or ways to locate information. My particular thanks to Tenley Zumwalt, Sandy Flowers, and Shawna Araiza, for helping with research, Photoshop, and those endless copyright clearances. I owe my staff a great debt for taking on extra work to allow me to write — not to mention their patience and computer support and ignoring my frustration with PCs. I promise to buy myself a new Mac, guys. As always, my family, friends, and pets earn extra hugs for their constant support and encouragement. I'm lucky to have friends who accept that I could not always be there for them. The garden, alas, is not so forgiving. Special thanks to all my clients, who have taught me so much and given me the opportunity to put into practice what I preach. I'd also like to thank Kim Darosett, project editor at Wiley, for her flexibility and patience with an author who sometimes can't remember an answer from one chapter to the next, and copy editor Heidi Unger. Together, they have made this book much better than it started out. My thanks also to technical editor Paul Chaney for his careful checking of links and knowledge of Web details, and to all the other staff at Wiley — from the art department to legal — who have provided support. If errors remain, I am certain they are all mine. My apprecia- tion goes to senior acquisitions editor Steve Hayes, for making this project pos- sible, and to my agent, Margot Hutchison of Waterside. I don't know how this superwoman has worked through the past several years as her young son struggles with cancer. Margot and her extraordinary family teach us all a lesson about what's important in life.

Launch Web site, count money. If only real life were that easy! Alas, with billions of Web sites competing for attention, it's not simple at all. On the other hand, marketing online isn't rocket science. This book charts a practical course of action to put your business Web site to work, adding profits to your bottom line. Whether you're just beginning to develop an online pres- ence or you've been online for years and are anxious to build traffic, this book will help you drive prospects to your site and convert them into customers. Web Marketing For Dummies leverages your offline knowledge of marketing into mastery of the Web. Because I've written this for owners of small busi- nesses, where cash is king, I suggest dozens of free to low-cost guerrilla mar- keting ideas that you can try online. There is no simple formula that says shoe companies should use this Web marketing method and architects should use that one. I urge you to keep a picture of your customers or clients in mind as you read this book. If you always ask yourself whether a particular method would appeal to your target market, you'll make the right decisions. Answer your customers' question, \"What's in it for me?\" and your Web marketing plan will work magic for you. About This Book This book is a reference guide to Web marketing. It's written like good Web copy: short sentences, short paragraphs, short chapters, with lots of bullets and tables so you can find information quickly. Please look at the pretty pictures. Not only do they save you 1,000 words of reading, they're good examples of what you're trying to accomplish. Dip into a chapter when you confront a particular problem with Web market- ing to find the information you need right then and there. The rest will wait. Web Marketing For Dummies cai lniorn pBoote This book is intended for business people, not techies. Where there is techni- cal information, I suggest you share that tip with your Web developer. Let him prry about Apache Mod Rewrites for search-engine-friendly URLs, y about your business. Contentions Used in This Book Doing something the same way over and over again can be boring, but consistency makes stuff easier to understand. In this book, those consistent elements are conventions. There are only a few: When URLs (Web addresses) appear within a paragraph, caption, or table, they look like this: www . dummies . com. New terms appear in italics the first time they're used, courtesy of the copy editor. Anything you have to type is in bold, but frankly, I don't think you have to type a single thing in this book. Mostly, you just have to think. Fortunately, Web marketing is platform- and operating-system-independent. It doesn't matter whether you're on a Mac with OS X or a PC running Windows XP, but I do recommend a high-speed Internet connection. You can no longer realistically monitor your Web site, upload content, review statistics, or research your market at turtle speed (dialup). What \\lou Don't Hatfe to Read You don't have to read anything that seems irrelevant to your business! You can scoot past the text following a Technical Stuff icon because that's really for your developer. You can bypass the Real World stories in sidebars, though you might enjoy reading the experiences of actual business owners who tried the marketing techniques under discussion. Sometimes, they divulge a help- ful insider secret or two. Chapter 5, which discusses building and merchandising an online store, applies only if you plan to sell online. If that doesn't apply to you, skip that one. If you're just getting started or have a very limited budget, you might want to postpone reading Part IV, Spending Online Marketing Dollars. Instead, stick with the affordable, basic techniques described in Part III until your site generates revenue or produces solid leads. Introduction Foolish Assumptions □Books for vour d d, I've constructed a picture of you, the reader. I assume you (or your designated staff member) already Have a computer with high-speed Internet access. Are (or soon will be) an owner or a department manager in a small- to-mid-size business. V Have or plan to write a business plan. Frequently use standard applications such as Word and Excel, e-mail, and browsers. \\S Are comfortable searching the Web by using keywords and search engines. Can write and do basic arithmetic, especially when dollar signs are involved. \\S Know your business and target markets. v* Have a passion for your business and a commitment to providing excellent customer service. If my assumptions are incorrect, you'll probably find this book either too easy or too hard to read. On the other hand, if my description is accurate, this book is just right for you. HoW This Book Is Organized I divided this book into parts that follow a chronological development process, from business planning and market research, through the design of a marketing-effective Web site and online store, to online promotion that pushes qualified traffic. For information on a specific topic, check the headings in the Table of Contents or look at the Index. By design, this book enables you to get as much (or as little) information as you need at any particular moment. If you're starting from scratch, you might want to start with Part I. If you already have a successful Web site and want to increase traffic, start with Part III. Web Marketing For Dummies Part 1: Getting Going tiith P B 0 6W& e Marketing Unless you have endless wealth and infinite time, you need some idea of what you're trying to accomplish online before you start. This section stresses the importance of Web planning as it intersects with all aspects of your business, including the financial ones. Stocked with useful planning forms and check- lists, this part shows how to plan for success from the beginning. Part 11: Building a Marketing-Effective Web Site Profitable business Web sites don't happen by accident. From a marketing perspective, a successful site attracts visitors, keeps them on the site, and brings them back for repeat visits. This section addresses building a marketing- effective Web site and online store, as well as implementing marketing ideas right on your site. Onsite marketing methods, including viral techniques, are usually either free or inexpensive, making them especially attractive for busi- nesses getting started online. Part 111: Exploring Online Marketing Basics The core of this book, Part III covers the absolutely essential components of online marketing: word-of-Web techniques, link campaigns, e-mail marketing, natural search engine optimization, and integration with offline techniques. While some of the methods in this section are time consuming, they don't require deep pockets. Part IV: Spending Online Marketing Dollars Use with caution: The advertising and marketing techniques in this part cost real moolah. Pay per click and banner advertising can both escalate to expen- sive media buys. Marketing techniques that use advanced technology and multimedia are expensive to produce. Introduction )pB0Qj$ Part V: Maximizing \\lour Web Success bout Web marketing would be incomplete without discussing Web . and sketching the overall environment in which Web marketing occurs. From legal and tax issues to a review of basic business concerns, this part will help you maximize the return on your Web investment. Part VI: The Part of Tens Like all For Dummies books, this one has a Part of Tens. These chapters list ten free ways to kick off your Web marketing campaign, ten of the most common Web marketing mistakes, and ten tips to rejuvenate a tired site. Turn to the Part of Tens for good ideas again and again. Icons Used in This Book To make your experience easier, I use various icons in the margins to indicate particular points of interest. Whenever I provide a hint that makes an aspect of Web marketing easier, I mark it with the Tip icon — it's my way of sharing what I've figured out the hard way — so that you don't have to. Of course, if you prefer to get your education through the school of hard knocks, be my guest. This icon is simply a friendly reminder. There are more details in this book than any normal person can remember. Use this icon to help you remember basic principles of Web marketing. Look up all the rest when you need it! Ouch! This icon is the equivalent of an exclamation point. Heed these warnings to avoid potential pitfalls. Sometimes I feel obligated to give developers some technical information; they don't always know as much as they think they do. I mark that stuff with this geeky guy so you know it's information to share, not necessarily to understand. Web Marketing For Dummies No one can do a Web site alone. It helps to know who can provide assistance. This icon suggests what type of professional to call. No names, but at least : a search term to use! For a business Web site, I don't recommend >ateurs or helpful friends and relatives, unless they're already profes- sionals in the field. i nis icon f^oLuhro ^j|s|i\\^fja This icon designates a real-world story about a company that's tried the tech- nique under discussion.

Parti DropBocfietting Going with Online Marketing The 5 th Wave By Rich Tennant \"You knov*, itdavmed on me last night vrntj vre aren't getting any Kits on our Web site.\" DropBooks In this part . . . a M nless you're Mr. or Ms. Moneybags, know what \\rw you're doing before you start spending money and time with online marketing. This section stresses the importance of Web planning as it intersects with all aspects of your business, including the financial ones. Chapter 1 puts Web marketing in the context of overall marketing. You discover that what you already know about marketing is true, such as the importance of return on investment (ROI). At the same time, Web marketing confronts you with new techniques and terms, such as the conversion funnel, which measures what percent of site browsers convert to buyers. It's easy to get so enthralled by Web technology that you lose site of your business goals. Take advantage of basic planning tools in Chapter 2 to maintain a focus on your bottom line, even as your marketing world grows more complex. A quick review of basic business and marketing principles demystifies Web marketing and positions you at the starting line. Before you create — or redesign — your Web site for suc- cess, come to terms with your own limitations. Except for genius-types who work 48-hour days, everyone needs help. In Chapter 3, you find out how to select good profes- sional help or how to take advantage of online tools to get going. In This Chapter Absorbing the Web into your overall business plans Rethinking your marketing Running the Web numbers for your business 1 ■ s it hypnosis? Seduction? Simple amnesia? Don't let dot-com technobabble «5 dazzle you into forgetting every business lesson you learned the hard way. You know there are no magic marketing bullets offline; there aren't any online either. You know that you build a customer list slowly, experimenting with a variety of techniques until word-of-mouth marketing kicks in. You want to be successful online? Then approach the Web the same way you approach your offline business — with an awareness of business fundamentals, a combina- tion of marketing techniques, and an indelible focus on your customers: You must have the business fundamentals right before you can have a truly successful Web site. Many sites flounder on straightforward busi- ness issues of cost, merchandising, back-office support, and customer service. Too many confuse revenues with profits, only to discover in quarterly financials that their sites are sinking into the Red Sea. f Successful Web marketing requires a combination of methods. Nowhere in this book do you read that the solution to all your Web woes lies in content, search engine optimization, link campaigns, pay per click ads, banners, e-mail newsletters, or any one online or offline marketing technique. Many are necessary, but none alone is sufficient to bring in all the traffic you need. Instead, you must select judiciously from an extensive marketing menu: a little appetizer, a nice side dish, maybe an entree that takes the most of your Web marketing dollars and efforts. Oh, don't forget dessert. The customer is the measure of all things Web, from site design to marketing. Don't let technology or personal inclination distract you from a focus on what the customer wants. And don't get carried away with what Web technology can do. Part I: Getting Going with Online Marketing tic pBo$ I Wi From those principles, you can see that Web marketing fits within the defini- tion of marketing you're already familiar with. When they're well imple- online techniques might offer a more cost-effective marketing mix, exibility, or easier expansion to new markets than offline techniques. With this book as your reference guide, you can master these new tools, adding a sense of adventure, as well as profits, to your bottom line. Rearranging \\lour Marketing Mix If you're already in business, you know you have to spend money to make money. You may need to redistribute your marketing budget to free up funds for marketing online. Here's a method to elevate your marketing analysis from guesswork to grand plan. First, make a four-column list organized as follows: The first column lists all the marketing techniques you currently use. V The second column lists the target market you reach with that technique. i** The third column lists how many new customers you think that technique brings in. i>* The fourth column lists how much you spend per year on that technique. If you've been in business for a while, you might have forgotten some of your recurring marketing investments. Here are a few examples to spark your memory: a Yellow Pages listing, signs, business cards and letterhead, logo design, a listing in a local business club directory, T-shirts for the girls' soccer team, newspapers or other print ads, direct mail, local fliers, word of mouth, radio spots, billboards, and so on. If you don't have extra money to invest in developing and promoting a Web presence, decide which existing methods you can cut in favor of more cost- effective online marketing. If you duplicate your reach at lower cost online, you can put the difference into your Web site. What you already know about marketing is true. Profit from your own success. Unless you're starting a new business online, your new customers are going to look an awful lot like your old ones. You already know how to sell to them, what they need, and what appeals to their emotions. Reaching your current audience online If you haven't done so in a while, write a paragraph describing your current customers: age, gender, income level, education, geographical region, or job title (if you sell business to business). What else do they buy? What do they like to read? It's easy to research your markets online. If you need to, segment your customers into different groups that share the same characteristics. Chapter 1: Taking Your Marketing to the Web When you design your site and implement your Web marketing campaign, use these profiles to decide what to do and where to spend. pBooks Finding new customers If you intend to use the Web to find new customers, decide whether you're simply expanding your geographical reach; going after a new consumer demographic or vertical industry segment for existing products, or selling new products and services to completely new audiences. All the guerrilla marketing aphorisms apply online. Rifles, not shotguns! Target one narrow market at a time, make money, and reinvest it by going after another market. Don't spread your marketing money around like bees spread pollen — a little here, a little there. That will dilute your marketing dollars and reduce the likelihood of gaining new customers. Write up the same type of profile for your new target audience(s) that you write up for your existing ones. As you read through the marketing chapters of this book, match the profiles of your target markets to a given technique to find a good fit. biscoVerinq the ionq tail of opportunity You might hear the phrase the long tail to describe the market model used by successful Web sites. The long tail, shown in the graph in Figure 1-1, describes a situation in which a lot of low-frequency events (think sales for various products) add up to more than a few, high-frequency events. The low- frequency events tail off, but added together they make up more than half the total. Figure 1-1: A graph of Sales the long tail for Sales versus Products. Products Part I: Getting Going with Online Marketing prontaDie pBodte those few This theory suggests that the reach of the Web is so vast that you can have a profitable business selling many items to a few people rather than spending a us marketing budget to sell a few items to many people. It works for om, Netflix, iTunes, and eBay. Why not for you? The trick is that those few people need to find your products in the vastness of cyberspace, or you have to find them. Of course, that's Web marketing, which is what this book is all about. If you're curious, read more about the long tail at http: / /en. wikipedia.org/ wiki/Long_tail, or in Chris Anderson's book The Long Tail: Why the Future of Business is Selling Less of More (Hyperion). Understanding Web Marketing Essentials While this book is full of the endless details that make up a successful Web marketing campaign, you need to keep only three, overarching points in mind. If you measure everything you do against these criteria, you'll come out fine: v 0 Do your plans fit with the needs and interests of your target audience? V Do your plans make financial sense? V Are your plans within your capabilities to execute? Right this very minute, create two new folders in your bookmarks, one for sites you love and another for sites you hate. Better yet, set up an account at del.icio.us (http : / /del . icio . us), which allows you to gather all your bookmarks in one, convenient, online account, accessible anywhere. With one click, you can tag (bookmark) any site you see for future reference. Whatever your online activities, make a habit of tagging or bookmarking the sites that appeal to you and the ones you can't stand. Don't worry if you don't yet have the vocabulary to explain your reactions. By the time you're ready to talk to a developer about designing a new site or upgrading an exist- ing one, your library of saved sites can provide essential information about where you want to go. Adjusting the Numbers for a Nert Medium For you, as a business owner or manager, the Web is a new means to meet your goals, not an end itself. You can hire professionals to take care of the technical and marketing details, but no one knows — or cares — as much about your business and your audience as you do.

What are your long-term strategies ng your business? Can you take advantage of Web technology to help your company prosper by f* Supporting your current customers more cost-effectively Expanding to new markets i>* Expanding your list of products or services Rid yourself of one myth right now. The truth is that marketing on the Web is not free. You can spend a lot of money, a lot of time, or some combination of the two, but you can't get away without an investment of some sort. Before you go online, think hard about the numbers. As a good businessperson, con- sider these key benchmarks, which are described in the sections that follow: f* The cost of customer acquisition V The break-even point V Return on investment (ROI) Don't call a Web developer about money! If you're not sure how to compute these numbers, ask your bookkeeper or CPA for help. Or go to one of the many Small Business Development Centers around the country for free assistance. (Go to http : / / sba . gov/ sbdc / sbdcnear . html to find a center in your area.) Estimating the cast of customer acquisition Can you acquire customers for less than the average $20-$30 cost of finding a new retail customer offline? Maybe, but it depends on what you're selling. Generally, the more expensive your product or service, the more you must spend to acquire a new customer. The cost of lead acquisition equals your marketing cost divided by the number of customer leads that the activity generates: cost of lead acquisition = marketing cost -s- # of leads Part I: Getting Going with Online Marketing site, your pBoate compute ; If you spend $100 for pay per click ads on Google to get 20 people to your site, your cost is $100 divided by 20, or $5 per lead. If only two of those 20 uy, your cost of customer acquisition is actually $50. That's fine if spend $250 on your site, but what if they spend only $25? You can compute acquisition cost for any single marketing campaign or technique or across an entire year's worth of marketing expenditures. The average cost of acquiring a new customer approximately equals the profit derived from an average customer's purchases in the first year. In other words, you might not make a profit on your customers unless they spend more than the average or you retain them for more than a year. Yes, indeed, it's a cold, cruel world. However, if you take advantage of the many free and low-cost techniques in this book, you can reduce your dollar cost of customer acquisition and stand a better chance of making a profit. It takes three times as much money to acquire a new customer as it does to keep an existing one. Computing your break-ei/en point Break-even is the number of sales at which revenues equal total costs. After you reach break-even, sales start to contribute to profits. To calculate the break-even point for your Web site, subtract your cost of goods (or cost of delivering services) from your revenues, which yields the gross margin: revenues - cost of goods = gross margin Now, total the fixed costs (charges that are the same each month, regardless of how much business you do) for your Web site, such as monthly devel- oper's fees, hosting, charges for your Internet service provider (ISP), over- head, and in-house labor. Finally, divide your fixed costs by your gross margin. That tells you how many sales you must make to pay for your basic Web expenses. fixed costs + gross margin = break-even point Costs of sales are expenses that vary with the amount sold, such as shipping and handling, commissions, or credit card fees. For more accuracy, you can subtract these from your revenues as well. Divide the result into your fixed costs to get the break-even point. Chapter 1: Taking Your Marketing to the Web Figuring out whether you'K DropBocyk^ mom * anline Return on investment (ROI) looks at the rate at which you recover your invest- ment in site development or marketing. Often you calculate ROI for a period of a year. To calculate ROI, simply divide profits (not revenue) by the amount of money invested to get a percentage rate of return: profits t investment = rate of return You can also express ROI by how long it will take to earn back your invest- ment. An annual 50 percent ROI means it will take two years to recover your investment. As with acquisition costs, you can compute ROI for your original investment in site development, for any single marketing campaign or tech- nique, or across an entire year's worth of Web expenses. Don't spend more on marketing than you can make back. Losing money on every sale is not a good business plan. Now, go have some fun and make some money online!

In this chapter, I show you how a few, simple, planning tools can help you track the big picture while maximizing the contribution of your Web site to your bottom line. If you mastered marketing principles in business school long ago, this chap- ter connects cybermarketing to your memories of business plans, the four Ps of marketing (product, price, placement, and promotion), and Maslow's Triangle. If your marketing knowledge comes from the school of hard knocks or if you're new to business, these conceptual marketing tools enable you to allocate marketing dollars in a new environment. As you go through the planning process, I suggest that you summarize your decisions on the forms in this chapter. Refer to them whenever you're uncertain about a Web marketing decision. These forms also make it easier to convey your site goals and objectives consistently to developers, graphic designers, other service providers, and employees. For your convenience, you can download full-page versions of these forms from the book's compan- ion Web site at www. dummies . com/go/webmarketing. Preparing an Online Business Plan If you're starting a new business of any type, you need to write a business plan. If you're adding online sales to an existing operation, dust off and update your current business plan as well. Opening an online store is like Part I: Getting Going with Online Marketing pBodRs Most bus opening a new storefront in another city; it requires just as much planning. Even if you're only launching or revamping a Web site, I suggest writing a d version of the business plan outlined in the following list. Most business plans include some variation of the following sections: Summary t<\" Description of Business (type of business and goals) Description of Product or Service Competition (online and offline) u 0 Marketing (target market, need, objectives, methods, promotion) Sales Plan (pricing, distribution channels, order fulfillment) u 0 Operations (facilities, staffing, inventory) **\" Management (key players and board) u 0 Financial Data (financing, financial projections, legal issues) The SBA (Small Business Administration) site includes free online business advice for start-ups at www. sba . gov/ s tar ting_business/ index . html, or search the Web for sample business plans at sites like Bplans .com (www . bplans . com/sp/businessplans . cfm). Going into detail about the process of writing a business plan is beyond the scope of this book. If you need assistance, business attorneys or accountants can help you get started and are familiar with local business organizations.

Peterson, Peter E. Jaret, and Barbara Findlay Schenck (Wiley Publishing). Chapter 2: Planning for Web Marketing Web sites don't solve business problems; they create new challenges. If your business is experiencing any problems, fix them first! Any difficulties with jr infrastructure, record-keeping, manufacturing, supply chains, ■ service, order fulfillment, staffing, cost controls, training, or pricing are only magnified when you go online. Dusiness 1: i^clnp]£«r Planning to Fit \\lour Business Goats Before you state the goals for your Web site, you must be clear about the goals for your business. Your answers to a few basic questions establish the marketing framework for your site. Answer the questions in the Business Profile section of the Web Site Planning Form in Figure 2-1. These questions apply equally to businesses of any size and to not-for-profit organizations, educational institutions, and governments. Here are a few examples of business profile questions: v 0 Are you a new company or an existing one with an established customer/client base? Do you have an existing brick-and-mortar store or office? V Do you have an existing Web site and Web presence? Do you sell goods or services? Do you market to individuals (which is called B2C for business-to- consumer) or to other businesses (which is called B2B for business- to-business)? Who are your customers or clients (generally referred to as your target markets)? Do you sell — or want to sell — locally, regionally, nationally, or internationally? Answer the other questions of the Business Profile section of the form to get an overall idea of what your business looks like. Your Web site is the tail, and your business is the dog.

You can add others later after benefits from your site start flowing to your bottom line. Providing customer service through information Brochureware or business card sites are an inexpensive solution. These sites, which contain no more than the minimal information included in a small tri-fold brochure, might provide a small business with an adequate Web presence. For example, the two-page interior design site at www. lmkinteriorsltd. com (shown in Figure 2-2) briefly describes services, linking to a second page with contact information and a project inquiry form. Other, information-based sites are much more extensive. Medical, technical support, or news sites may contain hundreds or thousands of pages in a searchable, linkable, static format. Businesses save money by hiring fewer staff to provide the information live while taking advantage of the Internet to offer support online 24/7 to accommodate customers worldwide.

Branding sites may TiCltfrJ^'fames, coupons, entertainment, feedback sections, interactive func- tions, and corporate information, but they generally don't sell the product online. They generate leads or sales only indirectly. For instance, consumers can buy a key chain or other branded paraphernalia on the Coca-Cola site (www. coke . com) but cannot buy a bottle of Diet Coke. Branding can be tricky, even on a sales site, when the name of a site is not the same as the existing business. Plaza Bakery, located on the central plaza in Santa Fe, New Mexico, solved this problem by modifying its former logo, incorporating the name of its Web site (SweetSantaFe.com), and moving its business name below the image.

Courtesy Plaza Bakery Generating leads or qualifying prospects Some sites, especially those for services and expensive products such as cars and homes, allow potential customers to research offerings, but cus- tomers must call, e-mail, or visit the brick-and-mortar establishment to close a sale. Interactive techniques, such as the Live Chat feature used by staffing agency Aerotek (www. aerotek.com/default.aspx) build relationships that turn prospects into customers. (Chapters 4 and 6 describe many interac- tive techniques you can use on your site for this purpose.) Chapter 2: Planning for Web Marketing weuuing. pBodte If you're clever, you can qualify your leads online. For instance, SantaFe Wedding.com, a destination wedding site, asks for the groom's name on its uiry page (http: / /santaf ewedding. com/ request . html). That alone reduces the number of false leads by more than 60 percent. Generating revenue through sates Transaction sites, which are, perhaps, the most familiar type of site, are used to sell goods or services online. Travel reservations, magazine subscriptions, organizational memberships, B2B (business to business) sales, and even donations fall into this category, as do retail sites from Amazon.com to the smallest, home-based micro-store. Good transaction sites take advantage of the Web to gather information about customer demographics, needs, and preferences and to test response to special offers. Generating revenue through advertising A business model that calls for generating revenue by selling ads operates in a fundamentally different marketing mode. When you sell advertising, the pri- mary product is the audience you deliver — either the number of eyeballs that view an ad or the number of click-throughs to an advertiser's site. Achieving internal needs Sites in this category attract investors, identify strategic business partners, locate suppliers, recruit dealers, or solicit franchisees. The audience for these sites is quite different from the audience for a site targeted at cus- tomers or clients. This distinction is critical because elements of your marketing plan are derived from the definition of your target market. Transforming your business through process innovation or creative techniques Transformation applies to more than giant corporations whose Web sites integrate just-in-time inventory, smooth supply chains, online sales, and accounting systems. Many innovative small businesses create online processes that fundamentally change the way they do business. Part I: Getting Going with Online Marketing (www . pat well off, ai Surprisingly, innovation doesn't have to cost much. Pablo's Mechanical (www.pablosmechanical . com), a plumbing and heating contractor, cap- second-home market in the rural tourist area near Angel Fire, New ablo's Mechanical realized that second-home owners are usually well off, are frequent Internet users, and often live out of state, perhaps in a different time zone. His simple, inexpensive site directs his customers to click onto large plumbing manufacturers' sites to select fixtures and then send him an e-mail with what they want installed. Specifying Objectives for \\lour Web Site What can convince you that your site is successful? After you establish goals, you need to specify the criteria that satisfy them. That means establishing measurable objectives. First, enter your calculations from Chapter 1 for break- even point, return on investment (ROI), and budget onto the Financial Profile section of the Web Planning Form in Figure 2-1. Your budget and ROI expecta- tions might constrain how much you can spend on marketing and, therefore, on how much traffic your site will receive. Take this into consideration as you specify numerical targets for your objectives and the dates you expect to accomplish them. There's no point in setting unrealistic objectives that doom your site to failure before you start. Table 2-1 suggests some possible measurements for different Web site goals, but you have to determine the actual quantities and time frames for achieve- ment. Define other objectives as appropriate. Enter the numbers and time frames for the criteria you'll use on the Sample Objectives section of the Web Site Planning Form. These numbers are specific to each business. Table 2-1 Site Goals and Objectives Site Goal Possible Objectives to Measure Managing customer Number of phone calls and e-mails, amount of traffic to service various pages, hours of site use, cost savings, time savings Branding Onsite traffic, time onsite, activities performed, coupons downloaded, gross revenues Generating Number of phone calls and e-mails, conversion rate of visits qualified leads to leads, conversion rate of leads to sales as compared to other lead sources, traffic to various pages, number of e-mail addresses acquired, cost of customer acquisition Chapter 2: Planning for Web Marketing Site Goal Possible Objectives to Measure ipBooks ting Conversion rate of buyers to visitors, sales revenue, ales average dollar value of sale, number of repeat buyers, profit from online sales, cost of customer acquisition, promo code use, sales closed offline that are generated from Web, if possible (that is, enter phone orders into the system) Generating Ad revenue, click-through rate, page views per ad, traffic to ad revenue various pages, visitor demographics Measuring internal goals Conversion rates for various actions, site traffic, other measurements (depending on specific goals) Transforming the business Site revenues, costs, profit, time savings, costs savings, other measurements (depending on specific goals) If you don't have objectives, you won't know when you've reached or exceeded them. Setting objectives ahead of time also ensures that you establish a method for measurement. For instance, you can obtain site traffic numbers from your Web statistics, as I discuss in Chapter 14, but you can't count leads that come in over the phone that way. Your receptionist must ask how a caller heard about you and tally results. Or you can display a separate number, e-mail address, person, or extension for Web visitors to use, just as you would establish a separate department number for a direct mail campaign. Try to track data for a 13-month period so you can compare same-date results. Almost all businesses experience some cyclical variation tied to the calendar. Defining \\lour Target Market In the Marketing Profile section of the Web Site Planning Form (refer to Figure 2-1), you need to define your target market(s). For each goal you select on your Planning Form, decide who your audience is. Phrases such as \"everyone who eats chocolate\" or \"all airplane passengers\" are way too broad. Unless you are Toyota or General Mills, you won't have the funds to reach everyone, so you need to segment and prioritize your markets. Note: I discuss how to fill out the rest of the Marketing Profile section in \"Writing Your Online Marketing Plan,\" later in this chapter. Part I: Getting Going with Online Marketing pBoolf Understanding market segmentation 'gmentation (dividing your market into smaller sets of prospects who tain characteristics) takes many different forms. You need to select the one that's the best fit for your business. For your online marketing plan, you need to locate the various sites on the Web where your target audiences hang out, so you need to know who they are. Think about it for a moment. The sites that appeal to opera lovers might not appeal to teenagers, and vice versa. One caveat: Your online target audience might differ slightly from your offline audience. It might be more geographically diverse, wealthier, older, younger, more educated, more motivated by price than features, or vice versa. You discover these variations only from experience. Here are a few forms of market segmentation: Demographic segmentation: Sorts by age, gender, socioeconomic status, or education for B2C companies f Lifecycle segmentation: Acknowledges that consumers need different products at different stages of life (teens, young singles, married cou- ples, families with kids, empty nesters, active retirees, frail elderly) Geographic segmentation: Targets areas as small as a neighborhood or zip code or as broad as a country or continent Vertical industry segmentation: Targets all elements within a defined industry as a B2B strategy V Job segmentation: Identifies different decision makers (such as engineers, purchasing agents, and managers) at specific points of the B2B sales cycle Specialty segmentation: Targets a narrowly defined market (such as 45- to 65-year olds, female caregivers of people with Alzheimer's, or 16- to 35-year-old male owners of classic Mustangs) Follow classic guerrilla marketing principles: Focus on one market segment at a time, gain market share and profits, and then invest in the next market segment. Otherwise, your limited marketing time and advertising funds are spread too thinly to have a significant impact. For more information on market segmentation, try www.businessplans . org/ segment . html or http : / /money . hows tuff works . com/marketing-planl2 . htm. Chapter 2: Planning for Web Marketing pBoQte Researching your market online n't sure how to define your market segments, check some of the arket research sites in Table 2-2. These sites offer a wealth of statisti- cal data about the demographics of online users, what types of products sell well, and the growth of Internet use by demographic segments.

It can still fulfill other functions, of course. Check the Harris Interactive report at http : / /harrisinteractive . com/harris_ poll/index. asp?PlD=668 for details about who's online. As of May 2006, Harris found that 77 percent of U.S. adults — 172 million — were online at work, school, or home and that Internet access now looks a lot more like the nation as a whole than it did several years ago. More seniors, minorities, and low-income users now have Internet access, shrinking the digital divide. Writing \\lour Online Marketing Plan Your business might have a formal marketing plan, or perhaps you have been in business so long that your marketing basics are second nature. For the sake of completeness and easy communication with others, fill out the additional questions of the Marketing Profile section of Figure 2-1: Part I: Getting Going with Online Marketing pBoo Marketing tag: Enter your marketing tag, which is the five- to seven-word phrase that describes what your business offers or who you are. This se probably appears (or should) on almost all your stationery, busi- cards, advertising, and packaging. Like your logo, your marketing tag helps define your public image. Your marketing tag should appear on your Web site as well! Many companies include it in their header graphic to reinforce branding. You can see examples in Figure 2-2 and the figure in the \"Planning for success at a museum Web site\" sidebar near the end of the chapter. v* Value proposition: Why should someone buy from your company rather than from a competitor? v 0 Competitors: Enter the names of at least six competitors and their Web addresses. After you go online, your universe of competitors expands phenome- nally. If you've been selling locally but plan to expand your market size, you'll find lots of other competitors online. You'll find competitors for your type of business in search engines, online Yellow Pages, or online business directories. This effort can be a bit sobering, but it's better to be prepared than surprised. Before writing an online marketing plan, consider how three other traditional marketing concepts apply in cyberspace: the classic four Ps of marketing, Maslow's Triangle (which 1 discuss in further detail in the \"Understanding why people buy: Maslow's Triangle\" section later in this chapter), and the obvious but often-forgotten need to fish where the fish are. Use these tools as part of your planning process to resolve problems before they impede your online success. Examining the four Ps of marketing Marketers name product, price, placement (distribution), and promotion as the traditional elements of marketing. These terms apply to the Web as well. If you plan to update an existing site, it's particularly important to review the four Ps. For instance, you might think you need a site update because you receive too little traffic from search engines, but after a review of the four Ps, you find out that the real issue is pricing. Chapter 14 explains how to diag- nose problems with the four Ps by using your Web statistics. Product Your product is whatever good or service you sell, regardless of whether the transaction takes place online. Review your competition to see what features, Chapter 2: Planning for Web Marketing uct in uoc products. benefits, or services they offer. (To find your competitors, look up your prod- uct in Google or another search engine.) Product also includes such elements mance, warranties, support, variety, and size. If you have an online k at your entire product mix and merchandising, not just individual products. Ask yourself the following questions: Do you have enough products in your online catalog to compete successfully? Are you selling what people want to buy? Are you updating your product catalog regularly, quickly removing items that are out of stock and promoting new items? Price The expanding presence of discount stores online puts significant price pressure on small businesses. Price comparison sites like Shopping.com, which cost-conscious shoppers check frequently, also compel lower prices. Use those sites to assess your prices against your online competition. Are you signifi- cantly higher, lower, or price competitive? What about your shipping prices? I talk more about shipping in Chapter 5, but for now, remember that high shipping costs account for 75 percent of abandoned shopping carts. If necessary, bury some of the handling and shipping costs in the basic product price and reduce the visible price for shipping. It's very hard for your small business to compete in the market for standard goods like baby clothes or DVDs unless you have really good wholesale deals from manufacturers or distributors. But you can compete pricewise on cus- tomized goods or services or by offering unique benefits for buying from your company. If you must charge higher prices than your online competi- tors, review your value proposition so that people perceive an extra benefit. That could be a $5 promotional code for a discount on another purchase, a no-questions-asked return policy, exclusivity, or your reputation for quality service. You don't need to compete with offline prices because people value the con- venience of, and time saved by, shopping online. It's perfectly okay to price online products higher than identical items in your brick-and-mortar store. In a drive to compete, many dot com businesses drive themselves into the ground by charging less for products than they cost. The more products they sell, the more money they lose. What a business model! While every business sometimes offers loss leaders, you have to cover the loss with profits from other products. Part I: Getting Going with Online Marketing pBod Placement Placement refers to your distribution channels. Where and how are your irfu^J and services available? Inherently, the Web gives you an advantage, h\\mjn hours of operation for research, support, and sales online. However, you might face distribution challenges, particularly if you're constrained by agreement to a particular territory or are a distributor or manufacturer who plans to sell online directly to consumers. Avoid channel cannibalization (the use of multiple distribution channels that pull sales from each other). Don't compete on price with your retailers. Otherwise, your direct sales might cost you sales from other outlets, in a destructive cycle of eating your own. Before competing with retailers, review the increased level of staffing and expenses that are required to meet expec- tations of consumer support. Are you really able to take this on? If so, you might want to open a completely separate retail site at a different URL from the one that your dealers and distributors see. Promotion Your Web marketing plan is one of the four Ps. All the different ways you communicate with customers and prospects are part of promotion. Include marketing your Web site as much as you market your company and products. Careful integration of online and offline advertising is critical. Are your meth- ods reaching your target audience? Are you sending the right message to encourage customers to buy? In the next section, you can see how to use Maslow's Triangle to craft a message that appeals to customers' motivations. Understanding rthy people buy: Mastou/'s Triangle By now, you realize that online marketing requires more than getting listed in search engines and waiting for the money to roll in. Maslow's Triangle is another way to gain an edge. Advertisers have long understood the power of messages that address people's emotional needs, taking advantage of a theory developed by humanistic psychologist Abraham Maslow in the late 1960s. You can do this, too! According to Maslow's hierarchy of needs (displayed as a triangle in Figure 2-4), everyone has to satisfy certain needs before they can achieve their maximum potential. In marketing terms, people buy certain products or seek Chapter 2: Planning for Web Marketing DropBo certain types of information to satisfy one of more of those needs. Of the five levels in Maslow's Triangle, the bottom two (Physiological and Safety) are pds. The top three (Social, Esteem, and Self-actualization) are growth : this point, people can find Web sites to satisfy every need in the triangle. Here's a list of those categories along with a description of each: Physiological needs: This category covers air, food, water, sleep, sex, health, and shelter. To satisfy these needs, people might research homes online, look for apartments to rent on Craigslist.org, purchase apparel from Patagonia.com, arrange a grocery delivery from Peapod.com, search for a dentist's name, look for nutrition advice, or locate an oxygen bar like the OxygenExperience.com. v 0 Safety needs: These types of needs include security items and informa- tion for times of emergency, social disorganization, or personal trauma. At this level, people might seek hotline numbers, fire or flood evacuation information, earthquake kits from SurvivalKitsOnline.com, fire extinguish- ers from AmericanFireEquipment.net, car alarms from SlickCar.com, or GPS systems from MagellanGPS.com. Part I: Getting Going with Online Marketing Oioks, g for success at a museum Web site The Museum of New Mexico Foundation Shops (MNMF Shops) operate retail stores at four, state-owned museums in Santa Fe, New Mexico: Palace of the Governors, Museum of Fine Arts, Museum of International Folk Art, and Museum of Indian Arts and Culture. MNMF Shops had already managed a successful, retail Web site at www.shopmuseum.com for three years when it received an economic development grant to promote New Mexico artists and artisans with marketing exposure beyond Santa Fe, itself the third-largest art market in the U.S. In March 2006, John Stafford, Director of Retail Operations, wrote a ten-page business plan revamping the existing site and adding two new sites, www . newmexicocreates . org and www.worldf olkart . org, forthe Foundations board of directors. The business plan included sections named Executive Summary, Mission Statement, Target Market, Business Model, Value Proposition, and Business Objectives, as well as sections on Merchandising Strategy, Operations Plans, Marketing Plans, and Financial Plans. It concluded with a Timing and Action Calendar. Stafford added sections importantforthe board: Critical Success Factors highlighted areas that needed direct attention; Risk Assessment and Contingency Plans addressed issues that might affect the achievement of financial objectives. Thanks to the detailed plans, NewMexico Creates.org launched in July 2006 with nearly 1,000 pieces of art from 400 artists. WorldFolk Art.org launched at the end of October 2006. Both sites are on targetto meet their objectives. The MNMF Shops contribute all net income from online and offline sales back to the Foundation for distribution to the four museums for education and acquisitions. Courtesy Museum of New Mexico Foundation Shops Chapter 2: Planning for Web Marketing I □Books frorr V Social needs: This category indicates our human cravings for caring and belonging, including products and services that make us more attractive thers. This need drives the appeal of popular social networking sites iverse as MySpace.com and PunkyMoms.com, as well as cosmetics from ElizabethArden.com, spa memberships, self-help books from Amazon.com, hobbies, clubs, civic activities, churches, and other groups. V Esteem: This refers to an individual's need for self-respect and respect from others. This need motivates the purchase of items like jewelry from Tiffany.com, fine wines from WineWeb.com, a monogrammed leather wallet from FineLeatherGifts.com, or a search for a Hummer dealer at Humvee.net, all of which carry a sense of status, prestige, and power. *<* Self-actualization: A sense of creative self-fulfillment may come from artis- tic, musical, educational, spiritual, or religious pursuits. Individuals with self-actualization needs might visit sites related to creative or spiritual pursuits, such as Buddhanet.net, AcademyArt.edu, or ClevelandOrch.com, and they might buy books, music, classes, concert tickets, or art. To increase your conversion rate (the percent of site visitors who buy), match your message to the needs your products fulfill. If you identify the specific benefits that people are looking for, you're more likely to close the sale. For instance, an esteem message would talk about the exclusivity of owning jewelry from Tiffany's, not about saving money. Fishing Where the fish are When you advertise offline, you put your ads where the target market is likely to see them. Ads for muscle cars run in the sports section of the paper or on billboards near gyms. The same thing applies online. You need to place your lures where your fish hang out. Figure 2-5 lists the marketing methods discussed in this book. As you read different chapters, check off methods you think are possibilities for your site. I also recommend that you compile a marketing notebook with ideas, articles, and Web sites, and create marketing folders on your hard drive to store online research. Over time, you'll gather enough information to fill out a Web Marketing Spreadsheet like the one shown in Figure 2-6. On this form, you finalize the marketing methods from your checklist and specify marketing method, audi- ence, impressions (number of times an ad is seen), costs per month, venues, and delivery schedule for each one. (In Chapter 12, 1 explain more about cost per thousand impressions, or CPM. You have to research costs for each tech- nique.) You can incorporate offline marketing in this spreadsheet or dupli- cate this arrangement for offline expenses and then add the two together. Part I: Getting Going with Online Marketing your mar DropBoote tives for ; The combination of marketing methods you decide to implement is called your marketing mix. When completed, this spreadsheet encapsulates your g plan, showing how your marketing mix will achieve the objectives ready established. The example in Figure 2-6 includes some objec- tives for a mock B2C site. If you lose direction, you'll end up wasting money. After several months, dis- card the methods that don't work and put more money into the ones that are successful — or add another method or two. Over time, you'll develop an opti- mized, online marketing program that you can monitor and tweak as needed. Marketing online is part of oVeraii marketing Exclusive online promotion of a Web site is rare. Your Web address should appear on your stationery, packaging, and brochures, at the very least. As you build an online marketing plan, you might decide to redirect some of your existing advertising dollars, but don't abandon successful offline adver- tising. Will you still need a listing in the Yellow Pages? Will you still hand out promotional items or exhibit at trade shows? Put your domain name (that's just a techie word for Internet address) every- where that you put your phone number and more. Put it on your shopping bags. Put it on your outdoor signs. Put it on your business truck! Heck, you can even hire someone now to put it on his shaved head. What you already know about your business is right — the Web is a new medium, not a new universe. Don't let technology fool you into abandoning hard-won knowledge of your business, your target markets, or how to appeal to them. When in doubt, follow your instincts and let your bottom line guide your decisions. Figure 2-5: Web Marketing Methods Checklist (download from www. dummies . com/go/ web market ing).

Many business owners err by viewing their Web site as a separate project, indepen- dent of marketing and sales, even when they have an online store. In reality, site design is intricately intertwined with every marketing decision you make. In this chapter, I explain the critical importance of selecting the right providers to bring your business vision to cyberspace. I show you how writing a site index (a table of contents for your site) and request for proposal (RFP) allows you to communicate your marketing and technical needs effectively to potential devel- opers as well as evaluate their responses. If your budget is tight, I recommend using template-based hosting companies rather than a do-it-yourself approach. You also find out how to select a good domain name and become familiar with the three characteristics of successful Web design: a site that attracts new visitors, keeps them with stickiness, and brings them back for more. Deciding Who Will Design \\lour Site The Oracle at Delphi was famous for the saying, \"Know thyself.\" Web design reinforces the importance of self-knowledge. Be honest about your skills. Are you a programming geek? A gifted photographer? A colorful writer? Do you Part I: Getting Going with Online Marketing pBodt 1 dream in Web-safe colors, JavaScript, or Flash animation? No? Then designing your own Web site is probably not your forte. Don't be hard on yourself. With jble exception of Leonardo da Vinci, should he be reincarnated in the ury, everyone needs help of some sort with Web site development. As the owner of a business with a passion for excellence, or the person delegated to oversee the company Web site, your job is that of producer, not creative director or technical manager. There's wisdom, not weakness, in playing to your strengths as a business owner and leaving the implementa- tion to someone else. As producer, you select the team and coordinate their efforts, cheer them on when the inevitable problems arise, answer their mar- keting questions, resolve conflicts based on your business acumen, and arrange the celebration when the site goes live. Understanding u/hy it's not practical to do it aii yourself Besides overseeing the content, managing the money, and handling the mar- keting, are you going to educate yourself in HTML, PHP, JavaScript, database programming, Dreamweaver, FrontPage, marketing communications, copy writing, photography, and graphic design in the next six weeks? Are you also fantasizing about winning the Tour de France, or are you just a victim of some misbegotten belief that this will save you money? Forget about it! Unless you're already a professional Web designer, don't do it all yourself; this is the biggest mistake you can make. Playing with your personal Web site is one thing, but creating a successful business Web site is a job for the pros. Would you let someone without experience design your ads, dress your store window, serve customers, buy goods from vendors, or negotiate contracts? Then why trust your Web site to a novice? Novices might include your friends, neighbors, children, or siblings, unless they have experience creating business sites for a living. Even then, treat people you know as you would any professional — write up an agreement so that expectations are clear. Believe me, an agreement won't only save you aggravation and disappointment, it might save your relationship. Time is money! A nonprofessional who does Web sites on the side and takes three or four times as long as a pro will end up costing you marketing opportunity and sales as well as money. Deciding who will design your site is a strategic marketing decision. How will your site measure up if it's obviously homemade, with links that don't work, but your competitors' sites look professional and run smoothly? If your compe- tition's sites are equivalent, this is not as much of a factor, but you're wasting an obvious opportunity to get an edge. Chapter 3: Taking the First Steps to Your Online Presence Using a professionally designed tknmlate to create your site Do you remember when desktop publishing software first came out? Unskilled users distributed newsletters that looked like font catalogs, using every imaginable typeface and style. The resulting newsletters were almost unreadable. You can avoid the Web site equivalent of desperado design by using a professionally designed template. Templates are not as flexible as a custom site, but they can save you signifi- cant money while maintaining graphic integrity. You can launch a template site very quickly and be confident that navigation will work. With a template to take care of design and programming, you can focus on content. Think of templates as the equivalent of buying business stationery from an office supply store. You can hire a graphic designer for custom work or order letterhead and business cards from a store catalog, customizing ink colors and paper stock. In terms of the Web, you select a template with navigation and customize it with your color selection, logo, text, and photographs. (I discuss selecting templates for online stores in Chapter 5.) If you can't afford a custom design when you start, use a template as a strategic placeholder. Put your money into marketing until you build a Web presence and set aside the revenues. Later, you can redesign the site with your profits. Choices, choices! You can choose templates at three different levels: cost, customizability, and skills required: *** Select a package solution that includes your choice of template design, hosting, and a variety of other options, based on your needs. This is the simplest and usually the least expensive option. On the downside, pack- age solutions are usually the least flexible. If you want, you can hire a designer to advise you on color choice or to tweak the template a bit. Figure 3-1 shows a template-based site created with WebSiteTonight, available through GoDaddy.com as the host. BossTin (www. boss tin. com) had a designer customize the template and create additional page layouts. V Buy a template design that is specific to your industry and upload it to a host that you've selected separately. This requires more knowledge v* Hire a company that specializes in a particular industry, with a selection of templates that they customize for you. This is more expensive than the other two solutions but still less costly and less time consuming than a fully custom design. and skill.
