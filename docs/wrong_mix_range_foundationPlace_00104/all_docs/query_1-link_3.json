        "text": "Search Engine Optimization is a journey, not a destination. Our objective is to guide you on that journey.\n\nThe job of search engines is to provide the most relevant results for their users. An outdated website with old information is not what you want to see at the top of the results. So, your first goal is to keep your website updated on a regular basis. The search engines are evaluating websites constantly: monthly, weekly, or even daily.\n\nThey're looking for information that best suits their users' needs.\n\nIt's difficult for your page to be ranked for a keyword that's not even on your page. So, your content needs to be structured around the keywords you expect users to search for. And, it's not just your content, but your page titles as well. Going further, tying in metadata tags in the code, which relate to your content and title help structure your page in a manner that search engines will find relevant. That's a start.\n\nBut, there's more things to consider. Beyond your content's relevancy, it's important that other sites are linked back to your site, too. After all, the more sites that look at your data, the more relevant that data is . . . at least to the algorithms.\n\nThere are numerous strategies that can be used, each one with its own benefits. We'll work with you to determine the best approach for your site and help drive more traffic to your site. Contact us today to get started.\n\nData warehousing combines data from multiple sources into one comprehensive and easily manipulated database. Different methods can then be used by a company or organization to access this data for a wide range of purposes. Analysis can be performed to determine trends over time and to create plans based on this information. Smaller companies often use more limited formats to analyze more precise or smaller data sets, though warehousing can also utilize these methods.\n\nCommon methods for accessing systems of data warehousing include queries, reporting, and analysis. Because warehousing creates one database, the number of sources can be nearly limitless, provided the system can handle the volume. The final result, however, is homogeneous data, which can be more easily manipulated. System queries are used to gain information from a warehouse and this creates a report for analysis.\n\nCompanies commonly use data warehousing to analyze trends over time. They might use it to view day-to-day operations, but its primary function is often strategic planning based on long-term data overviews. From such reports, companies make business models, forecasts, and other projections. Routinely, because the data stored in data warehouses is intended to provide more overview-like reporting, the data is read-only.\n\nThis does not mean that data warehousing involves information that is never updated. On the contrary, the data stored in warehouses is updated all the time. It is the reporting and the analysis that take more of a long-term view.\n\nWhile larger companies typically use data warehousing to analyze big sets of information for enterprise purposes, smaller companies wishing to review just one subject often utilize \"data marts.\" These are much more specific and targeted in their storage and reporting. Data warehousing can include smaller amounts of data grouped into \"marts,\" which are then connected together as part of the larger system. In this way, a major company might use both warehousing and data marts, letting users choose the best source and functionality depending on their current needs.\n\nWhatever your data warehousing needs are, we can help. Give us a call today.\n\nIf you're an owner of an online store with a shopping cart, you know that entering products into an online store's product database is a tedious and time-consuming process.
