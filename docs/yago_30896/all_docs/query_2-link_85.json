        "text": "Welcome to Northbridge Dentists, the longest standing Northbridge dental clinic. Since 1920.\n\nCongratulations, you’ve found us.\n\nWe are the only independent, single location dental practice in Northbridge - serving the community for over 100 years.\n\nAll of our dentists are Australian trained graduates from the University of Sydney with a minimum of 10 years Australian private practice experience. Because it maters who is treating you.\n\nIf you’re looking for a dentist in Northbridge or the local Willoughby area, we’d love to meet you!\n\nWhat makes our Northbridge Dentists different?\n\nWe are a non-corporate, husband and wife team, who own and operate just one dental practice. This makes us unique in Northbridge.\n\nThis allows us to concentrate our focus here, and only here. We answer to nobody - except our patients. As such we value every single patient and treat them like family.\n\nEasily accessible at street level (no stairs), we also provide undercover parking for patients with lift access - great for wheelchairs, walkers and prams. With TVs on the roof as you have your treatment, it’s wonderful for little kids (and big kids too!).\n\nOur experienced dentists offer most treatment in-house and use the highest quality of materials for a range of procedures. You should expect nothing less for your mouth.\n\nWe love networking with our local community and have been proud sponsors of the local grassroots Northbridge Football Club, we are supporters of the 202 Progress Association and work with the local sustainability group to recycle used toothbrushes and toothpaste.\n\nThe original Northbridge Dentist. 100+ years young.\n\nEstablished in the 1920s, Northbridge Dentists are the longest serving community focussed dental practice in Northbridge. The practice is owned and run by a husband and wife team - Dr David and Dr Jenny, and is proud to have served many generations of families.\n\nAll of our Northbridge dentists have a minimum of 10 years experience, and all are Australian trained graduates from the University of Sydney. If you’re looking for a Northbridge dentist would love to see you at our Northbridge dental clinic.\n\nOur Northbridge Dentists\n\nWhen David's not consuming his time with fixing teeth or looking after his son Benny or toddler Ashleigh, he loves nature photography and exploring the great outdoors with his talented dentist wife Jenny Chang, be it bushwalking or just relaxing.\n\nHe is the second generation of Vickers in the dental world, also following in his fathers glove-steps. You could say he knows teeth back-to-front.\n\nDavid particularly enjoys treating kids, and has a special interest in orthodontics. He loves helping patients achieve their dream smile with Invisalign, orthodontics, crowns, veneers and more. An Honours graduate from Sydney University, he is well versed in doing a broad range of treatment including root canals, extractions, dentures, fillings and more.\n\nDavid completed his undergraduate studies at the University of Sydney. He holds a Bachelor of Commerce and a Bachelor of Dentistry, graduating with Honours. He regularly attends seminars and conferences to keep up to date with the latest in advanced dental procedures.\n\nDavid is registered with Australian Dental Board and is a member of the North Shore Dental Study Group and the ADA (Australian Dental Association).\n\nDr. Jenny Chang attended high school at Pymble Ladies College in Sydney. Upon completion of high school she studied a Bachelor of Physiotherapy at the University of Sydney and then gained her Masters Degree in Studio Art. Blending a thirst for scientific knowledge with her artistic side led her to study Bachelor of Dentistry. She graduated with Honours, with her final research paper investigating the long term effects of water fluoridation.\n\nDr. Jenny Chang is particularly gifted with Comprehensive Restorative Dentistry, Aesthetic Dentistry, Orthodontics, Orofacial Pain and Dental Sleep Medicine. She also enjoys root canal treatment and helping people with TMJ pain. She has completed a two year mini residency in General Orthodontics accredited by International Association of Orthodontics, and a one year residency in Temporomandibular Joint Disease and Sleep Medicine. She has also attained Level I, II & III accreditation in Implant Dentistry from the Australian Society of Implant Dentistry, along with a host of other courses. Dr. Chang is a member of the Australian Dental Association, Northshore Dental Study Group, Australian Society of Endodontics and American Academy of Craniofacial Pain.\n\nDr Chang is kind, friendly and gentle. She especially enjoys treating children and families. Outside of work, Dr Chang likes bushwalking with her wonderful dentist husband David Vickers and two kids, painting acrylic on canvas, and has a recent newfound interest in skiing.\n\nFluent in English and Mandarin\n\nAs a child, Audrey spent some time at primary school in Northbridge. She is a local girl! Audrey is a gentle and genuine dentist who will put your mind at ease from your first visit. She takes great pride in her work - she has been a dentist for 20 years now! Overall she takes a holistic view in treatment planning with prevention, sustainability, wellness and nutrition all part of her approach. She is also a “straight shooter” and gets to the point where needed.\n\nAfter graduating from the University of Sydney in 1999 (with Honours), she’s worked both locally in Sydney and even set about trying to help lift British dental standards - working in London between 2003 and 2006.\n\nAudrey is well versed in a variety of procedures including general restorative dentistry, root canal, crown and bridge, splints, mouthguards and basic Invisalign.\n\nOutside of the dental surgery, Audrey has two young daughters in primary school which keep her very busy. It also allows her to adopt a particularly empathetic approach with children.\n\nShe is Australian qualified with her dentistry degree from the University of Sydney and registered with the Australian Dental Board. Audrey is a valued member of Northbridge Dentists and we are very happy to have her on board.\n\nFluent in English and Cantonese, can understand Mandarin.\n\nDr Russell Cooke has been practicing for over 30 years. His philosophy is “Confidence, experience and trust are the critical values when choosing a dentist. You only have one set of teeth and it's important that they receive the very best of care.”\n\nRussell has a son and daughter in their late 20's, a father who is 94, and was proudly the official dentist for Pymble Ladies College for 2 decades, whilst practicing in Pymble.\n\nRussell is across all dental issues that affect us at different stages of our life. As a member of the American Dental Association for over 27 years, and attending their conferences annually in New York, Russell prides himself on gaining early exposure to the latest technology. He was among the first to introduce this technology to the North Shore, and it is now standard of care, including equipment such as Autoclaves, Panoramic, and Digital X-rays.\n\nOutside of dentistry Russell’s passions include health and fitness, photography and travel.\n\nPrior to working as a General Dentist, Dr Michelle Sawyer completed an Arts degree with a double major in History and Industrial Relations. She worked for a number of years in human resources, in the information technology and banking sectors.\n\nMichelle completed her Bachelor of Dentistry at the University of Sydney in 2012. During her studies she participated in a program comparing dental care in rural, metropolitan, and remote settings. This included a placement with the Royal Flying Doctors Service out of Broken Hill.\n\nDentistry is a family affair for Michelle. Before joining Northbridge Dentists, she worked alongside her mother, a now retired Paediatric Specialist, in a family-owned, North Shore practice for many years seeing patients of all ages. Michelle has two children, and in her spare time enjoys gardening, sewing and stand-up comedy.\n\nMichelle enjoys the variety that general dental practice offers and regularly attends professional development courses. Her areas of interest include root canal therapy, crown and bridge, children's dentistry, gum disease treatment, full mouth rehabilitation and more. She has a strong commitment to working with her patients to achieve and maintain the highest level of oral health thereby preventing future dental disease and minimising the need for invasive dental treatments."
