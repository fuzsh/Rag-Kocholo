        "text": "MICHAEL:\n\nYou’re finally back at your old stomping ground at One Life to Live. We are thrilled your back!\n\nANDREA:\n\nI am thrilled, too!\n\nMICHAEL:\n\nYou are such a kick to watch! I find myself laughing out loud during some of your scenes. I think this is the best Tina you have been. What’s fun about playing her?\n\nANDREA:\n\nEverything. She is such a fun character. She is kind of a bigger than life character. She is driven, a little flaky but also a little smart. She is fun and sexy. She is a little bit of everything, and I think that’s what people can relate to. Tina is always the underdog in a way, because she is always trying to better her life, but always does it the wrong way.\n\nMICHAEL:\n\nYou recently ended your run as Rebecca Hotchkiss on “Passions”. So why did you decide to come to “OLTL” at this point in time?\n\nANDREA:\n\nI think it was always in the back of my mind that I would probably go back. I did not know for how long, though. I knew my audience wanted me to, and you guys are important to me. I had been in talks with ABC, in what seemed like forever. Executive Producer, Frank Valentini at “OLTL” had been in discussions with me, and we both agreed we wanted “Passions” to have its shot and stay there, and give it all I got while it was on the air. I loved that show. Once “Passions” went down, it really freed us up to work something out. Frank, and head writer, Ron Carlivati were kind of enough to work around my schedule and allow me to do this.\n\nMICHAEL:\n\nIt seems like a great arrangement. You live in LA and fly to New York to tape episodes of the show. How does that work?\n\nANDREA:\n\nI do many shows in a few days. I think I have done 18 shows in three and half days. That’s how I do it. I spend the majority of my time here in Los Angeles. I have a daughter and family which is the most important thing to me. I need to make sure her routine is disturbed as little as possible.\n\nMICHAEL:\n\nIs it harder to shoot all your scenes in one swoop because of the continuity, or does it seem a bit disjointed to you as an actress?\n\nANDREA:\n\nIt’s fine. It’s kind of like doing a mini-film before I go. Having done film, it’s like an odd cross for me between a soap and a film.\n\nMICHAEL:\n\nOK we need to discuss the new addition to Tina’s family, her dog, “David Vickers!” The best soap dog ever and he is Tina’s new sidekick.\n\nANDREA:\n\nWho is just the sweetest thing!\n\nMICHAEL:\n\nWhat is “David Vickers” real life name? You seem to get along swimmingly.\n\nANDREA:\n\n“David Vickers” name is Tallulah. I have never met a dog I didn’t get along with. I am a true animal lover and that’s one of the ways Frank tried to entice me back by saying, “I am going to give you a dog.”\n\nMICHAEL:\n\nI thought it was brilliant plot device.\n\nANDREA:\n\nIt’s brilliant and I am thrilled. When I am in New York it helps me ease the pain of being away from my own two dogs.\n\nMICHAEL:\n\nWhy is Tallulah so terrific on screen?\n\nANDREA:\n\nShe is the perfect concept dog. On “Passions”, I worked with some dogs, but Tallulah is the best animal I have ever seen on set. She does not bark between scenes. You don’t have to remove her from the set after a scene is done. She puts her belly on the cold floor and she loves it.\n\nMICHAEL:\n\nTina seems to have a bit more humanity to her this time around. She used to be very mean to her sister, Viki.\n\nANDREA:\n\nShe always did love Viki in an odd way. Tina gets things twisted up, and she gets convinced to do things. Remember when she came back, and was so mean to Viki, it was that she was being convinced to do that because of Mitch Laurence. Tina gets misguided easily by men. But how many women do we know like that? That’s a common problem. I think those are the things that make Tina wonderful. She also has done some nice wonderful things for Viki, and tried to save her on many occasions and loved her and her family. Tina gets…. side-tracked, shall we say?\n\nMICHAEL:\n\nWhen you returned for the 40th anniversary episodes you only had short scene with Viki at the airport. Many die-hard fans felt perhaps short changed. But I hear there are more Tina and Viki moments on the way!\n\nANDREA:\n\nThere will be more Tina/Viki absolutely. I think Ron Carlivati tried to bring in a scene with us before Erika Slezak (Viki) left for her vacation. Between our two schedules… to get me their before the 40th anniversary, and her leaving on her vacation was challenging. He really struggled to find the opportunity for us to have any scenes at all under those circumstances. I promise you there will be a lot more to come.\n\nMICHAEL:\n\nTina is part of the first family of Llanview, The Lord’s. How is working with Erika Slezak?\n\nANDREA:\n\nI love working with Erika. Erika has a very special place in my heart, because if there is another actress in this business who I have worked with for so long, and learned so much from it would be Erika. I have known her longer than my husband. She knew me before my first marriage, and through my first marriage. She knew me when I was a teenager. It’s a very long lasting relationship, and one I treasure.\n\nMICHAEL:\n\nYou have a new Todd Manning to work with. Your last go round, Roger Howarth was playing the role, now we have Trevor St. John. How has that been?\n\nANDREA:\n\nI am just getting to know him. I am enjoying working with him very much.\n\nMICHAEL:\n\nTina is being blackmailed by Tess, Jessica’s alter. One recent episode had Bo and John making Tina squirm when they kept intimating there is something not quite right with Jessica. Tina was hilarious. How is working with Bree Williamson (Jess/Tess)?\n\nANDREA:\n\nI had not worked with Bree before, but with Erin Torpey as Jessica, when she was a little girl. I think Bree is very talented!\n\nMICHAEL:\n\nWhat can Tina Lord Roberts’s fans look forward to in the coming months?\n\nANDREA:\n\nI think more vintage Tina and more what the fans want to see. I think the fans were very happy to have Tina come back for the 40th anniversary. We did the Medorra storyline, which is very 80’s Tina. Totally 80’s Tina….. and gave the audience what they want. I think now, they want to see her blend in to her roots with the family, and involved in more of the storylines that are in Llanview.\n\nMICHAEL:\n\nWill she have a love interest?\n\nANDREA:\n\nYes, I know she will.\n\nMICHAEL:\n\nIs it anybody currently on the canvas?\n\nANDREA:\n\nI can’t tell you more than that.\n\nMICHAEL:\n\nHow did you feel when “Passions” run ended? Rebecca was such an ‘over-the-top’ character, such as you are famous for in your career for playing.\n\nANDREA:\n\nI think that is a good way to put it. I was sad. It was a bittersweet thing. I was there eight years, and you grow to love the situation. It’s the breaking up of a family, and it’s hard and a big adjustment. I knew long before “Passions” finally ended, that it would be sad to go. For many people it meant the end of working for awhile, which is hard and devastating in this economy we are in. Nobody wants to be in that situation. So it was very difficult.\n\nMICHAEL:\n\nDo you stay in touch with your former on-screen daughter, Liza Huber (Ex-Gwen)?\n\nANDREA:\n\nLiza and I are close, and Kim Ulrich (Ex-Ivy) and I are close. Those are pretty much the actors that I have really stayed close with and of course, the crew. I am quite the crew chick! I love the cameramen. We share a love of sports. We text each other quite frequently.\n\nMICHAEL:\n\nWhat is your favorite sport?\n\nANDREA:\n\nI love Baseball; I am a big Chicago Cubs fan.\n\nMICHAEL:\n\nSo you must be happy?\n\nANDREA:\n\nI am happy.\n\nMICHAEL:\n\nWell, I am from Milwaukee!\n\nANDREA:\n\nAre you a cheesehead?\n\nMICHAEL:\n\nYes. And I am not happy with what is going on right now. The Brewers are sinking fast out of the playoff race while the Cubs clinched the Division title.\n\nANDREA:\n\nYou know someone from Chicago, is the only person going to say that to you!\n\nMICHAEL:\n\nMilwaukee always bombs in the end. It’s a tradition!\n\nANDREA:\n\nYeah, but Milwaukee had done better than the Cubs in the last hundred years or something.\n\nMICHAEL:\n\nWill you go to a Cubs game if they make it into the World Series?\n\nANDREA:\n\nI would love to. I have to admit, I have not been able to follow it as much, since I have been commuting. Also, with my daughter, I am not as up on things as I should be. My daughter is now four and half so that also keeps me very busy.\n\nMICHAEL:\n\nYour daughter is named Kylie, which is very cute. What is the best thing about motherhood?\n\nANDREA:\n\nAll of it! It’s what I expected and that much more. The best part of it is the stuff it brings out in you. I desperately wanted a child, and all women don’t feel that way contrary to popular belief. I certainly did. I was driven during my “Passions” years. It was a good time for me to achieve that goal. I knew I wanted it, and I knew I had to have it. However, my thoughts about it paled in the reality of it, and it’s so life-changing, view-changing, and awe-inspiring. I just love it.\n\nMICHAEL:\n\nAre there some moments from your time on “OLTL” where you thought you: “hit it out of the ballpark” and felt great about the work you did that day?\n\nANDREA:\n\nIt’s been so many years. I always tried to leave the set feeling good. The thing I hate, are the days when you leave thinking, “Ooh… I could have done that better.” I love my job. I love the industry. I love daytime, and I always like to leave it feeling I did my absolute best. The days I feel not as good about it are hard.\n\nMICHAEL:\n\nBecause on daytime soaps, things move so fast, you can’t re-tape an episode?\n\nANDREA:\n\n….Or sometimes something occurs to you later and you are like, “Oh. I should’ve done that!” A couple weeks ago on a plane back to LA I was trying to sleep, and I woke up going, “Oh. I should have done that!”\n\nMICHAEL:\n\nWhat makes Andrea Evans and her portrayal of Tina so iconic that everyone said, “The bitch is back!”? What do you think makes Tina so captivating to the audience?\n\nANDREA:\n\nI think there are a few soap roles like that. I am very fortunate to have embodied one of them. I think there are a handful of them that have reached the audience in a special way. I think it’s just the marrying of the character and the actor. I think actors become known for a role, for a reason. It’s because that role really suited them in the moment in time they are playing it. It may be a big melding of the two. I am fortunate to be included in that group. That’s why it was important to me to bring Tina back in a way that did the fans justice and in the right way.\n\nMICHAEL:\n\nYou are so involved with City of Hope and charitable efforts. Tell us all about it?\n\nANDREA:\n\nI am the Celebrity Ambassador for City of Hope’s, Walk for Hope to Cure Breast Cancer. I have been for 8 years. I became involved because my mother was an 18 year breast cancer survivor, and years ago, I started doing the walks as a celebrity. I saw several celebrities show up and then leave in a limo. Personally, I think that’s wrong. If I am going to do that walk… I do it. I want to make myself available for the people to come up and talk to me. When City of Hope approached me, I thought it was an opportunity to make a difference. My fans have helped raised over 25 million dollars. It is a phenomenal amount and that keeps me going. I have known women everywhere who struggle with this disease or family members who have lost their battle, or family members who have just started their battle. I have had women show me their mastectomy scars. I am touched that they want to share this with me. I am happy to be there, and to walk and to honor those who are fighting their battle, and who have lost their battle, and to honor the survivors like my mother, who are continuing to win that battle. To raise money for better research, it’s a fabulous thing. I take it very much to heart.\n\nMICHAEL:\n\nYou are set to do several Walk for Hope’s around the country.\n\nANDREA:\n\nI am doing a walk in Chicago on October 12th and a walk in Los Angeles on November 9th. For more information you can go to www.walk4hope.org.\n\nMICHAEL:\n\nAnd now you have launched a very special line of soaps for the consumer and your fans, ”Soap for Hope”. Tell us about how this came about?\n\nANDREA:\n\nI have teamed up with a company called, “LATHER” for this special project. It’s called Sandalwood Rose Soap. www.lather.com I have been a fan of their products forever, and I have sensitive skin. They use no dyes, their soaps are all natural and olive oil based. One of the struggles with the soap, is we wanted it to be pink, because we don’t use any dye. So, what we used were rose petals which gives it a slightly pink appearance without dyes. They do no animal testing and their products are very pure. Some of their products are unscented. So people should definitely give it a whirl!\n\nMICHAEL:\n\nAnd there is a big launch party here in Southern California this weekend….\n\nANDREA:\n\nThis Saturday, September 27th, we are having our launch party in Pasadena, where we are bringing out our, “Soaps for Hope”. The product came out great and you can buy them individually or in a boxed-set, and all the proceeds go to City of Hope Breast Cancer Treatment. So it’s a wonderful cause. I know the fan response has been so good, that they have actually been up on the website before the launch because of the fan demand of the soaps. I am going to be at the, “Lather” store from 2-4PM on Colorado Blvd this coming weekend, and October 1, I will be in the Phoenix store in Scottsdale. If you go to www.andreaevans.com you can also find this great product.\n\nMICHAEL:\n\nYou also recently helped launch City of Hope’s very own satellite radio music channel…The Pink Channel.\n\nANDREA:\n\nYes. I hosted a week on the Pink Channel and I loved it and had so much fun. It’s a music channel on XM Satellite Radio. I did all the host wrap-arounds and introduced people and did salutes to people. I love doing radio, so that was so much fun. The channel is about cancer awareness and City of Hope. It was a fabulous thing to do. It’s a cause near to my heart and I would do it again in a heartbeat.\n\nMICHAEL:\n\nWhen you get emails from fans to your website, what are they talking about…Tina?\n\nANDREA:\n\nI have a Web mistress who helps me with everything. A lot of it is about television obviously, and even when I was on other shows, it was always about Tina.\n\nMICHAEL:\n\nDoesn’t anyone remember you were Patty Williams on “Y&R”?\n\nANDREA:\n\nThat’s the one that gets forgotten for some reason. It was a good girl. I guess I was born to be bad, because the audience response is that they like me much more in the bad girl role, which is fine, or as they call me in my favorite magazine from Australia, “The Super-Bitch”.\n\nMICHAEL:\n\nDo you ever miss the day-to-day of living and working in New York?\n\nANDREA:\n\nIn a way, I have the best of worlds and so I can’t complain. My oldest and dearest girlfriends are in New York. So I get a lot of girlfriend time there which I don’t here in LA. One of my friends is Renata the makeup woman at “OLTL”. She is like the sister I never had. To have time with her like that again is fabulous.\n\nMICHAEL:\n\nHow is working with “OLTL” head writer, Ron Carlivati?\n\nANDREA:\n\nHe is wonderful. I just love him. I think he and Frank Valentini have restored a vision to “OLTL” that wasn’t there.\n\nMICHAEL:\n\nIt kind of lost its way in the past, but it’s been back on track over the last year or so. Wouldn’t you agree?\n\nANDREA:\n\nI think so, and that is one of the reasons I wanted to come back. I felt really safe in their hands to do this. It’s really good."
