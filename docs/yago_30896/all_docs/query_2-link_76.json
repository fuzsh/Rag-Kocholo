He was raised in Montana and Washington, graduated from Walla Walla High School, then attended Utah State University followed by a mission for The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints in Brazil. He graduated from Oregon State University with degrees in economics and international business.\n\nDave often proclaimed that the best decision he ever made was his choice of wife.
