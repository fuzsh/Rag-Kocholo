Honorary bearers were Tony Vickers, Jeff Vickers, Ronnie Vickers, J.J. Vickers and Jacob Vickers.\n\nInterment was at Junction Township Cemetery west of Grand Junction.\n\nThe family was assisted by Slininger-Schroeder Funeral Home of Jefferson.\n\nDavid “Dave” Leroy Vickers, son of Delmar and Rachel (Irene) Vickers, was born, August 5, 1949, in Massillon, OH. He was one of six boys born to this union. Dave passed away August 14, 2018, at Unity Point Methodist Medical Center in Des Moines.\n\nOn December 20, 1975, Dave was united in marriage to Jean Bishop in Phoenix, AZ. Dave had two daughters, Danelle and Theresa, prior to this union, and proceeded to have three more children: Tina, Tara, and Jacob. Dave was a grandfather to six grandchildren and two fur grandpuppies.\n\nDave moved back to Iowa with his wife Jean in 1976, where he started working at Parker Industries as a machine operator.
