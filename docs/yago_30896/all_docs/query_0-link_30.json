        "text": "In the last 24 hours the soap community is in mourning on the passing of one of its greatest, Andrea Evans. As revealed on Monday, Evans passed away on Sunday from her battle with cancer. She was just 66-years-old.\n\nAndrea leaves behind her beloved daughter Kylie and her husband, Stephen, and so many former castmates, colleagues and fans, who paid tribute to her and shared their remembrances of this kind and talented soul.\n\nEvans was best-known for her role as Tina Lord Roberts on One Life to Live, but throughout her career she made stops to several other daytime dramas including: The Young and the Restless as Patty Williams, The Bold and the Beautiful as Tawny Moore, Passions as Rebecca Hotchkiss and the role of Patty Walker on the streaming series, The Bay.\n\nBelow are just some of the tributes that have poured in on social media, and websites since yesterday. We will continue to add more as they are shared publicly.\n\nAndrea’s beloved daughter Kylie shared with TV Line: “Today, I face an immeasurable loss — the passing of my beloved mother, Andrea Evans, after her courageous battle with cancer. At just 19 years old, my world has been forever changed, and words cannot adequately convey the depth of my sadness. My mom was my best friend. Her vibrant spirit, infectious laughter, and boundless love for life left a mark on all who were fortunate enough to know her,” she continued. “Throughout her fight with cancer, my mom displayed awe-inspiring strength. She faced each hurdle with grace and determination, cherishing every precious moment. Despite the pain and uncertainty, she taught me the invaluable lesson of finding joy, even in the darkest of times. We held hands until the very end. While I struggle to come to terms with her passing, I am profoundly grateful for the love and support we have received from family, friends, and the community. I would also like to extend my heartfelt appreciation to the healthcare professionals who cared for my mother throughout this incredibly challenging process. Although my mother’s physical presence is no longer with us, her love and spirit will forever endure. The lessons she taught me about resilience, kindness, and love will guide me through the difficult journey ahead.”\n\nEvan’s husband, Stephen Rodriguez wrote: “Andrea was a remarkable individual, cherished by all who knew her. Her unwavering strength, positivity and indomitable spirit inspired us every step of the way throughout her fearless fight against this relentless disease. She faced the challenges with grace, resilience, and an enduring love for life. Andrea and I spent 30+ years together. She was a great wife and mother. She was my rock. Cancer killed Andrea, but it did not kill her spirit. That spirit is alive and well and lives on in each one of us, whom she touched.”\n\nFrank Valentini (ex-EP OLTL, now GH) shared: “I am so sorry to learn of Andrea Evans’ passing. Andrea was already a huge star when my career began at OLTL. She was always kind, gracious, and so fun to work with. A daytime legend who will be missed very much. My sympathies to her friends and family.”\n\nRon Carlivati (ex-head writer, OLTL, now DAYS): “I am absolutely heartbroken to learn of the untimely passing of Andrea Evans who played the iconic Tina Lord Roberts on One Life to Live and is one of the reasons I fell in love with soap operas in the first place. Andrea brought such a sense of guilelessness and fun to a selfish and scheming character and made you fall in love with her. After watching her as a fan for many years, I was lucky enough to have the opportunity to write for her and it was one of the most satisfying experiences of my professional career. I will treasure the memories of Tina trying to misappropriate the Crown Jewels of Mendorra with her beloved dog David Vickers under her arm. She survived a trip over the Iguazu Falls and made her way back to Llanview to crash Cord’s wedding to Kate Sanders with a stolen baby in her arms, and that’s how I will always remember both the character and the actress: resilient and resourceful, but also so warm and kind. My thoughts and prayers are with her family. Rest in peace, dear Andrea.”\n\nAdrienne Frantz (ex-Amber, B&B): “I lost my tv mom yesterday! I am in shock and beyond devastated! Andrea may have been cast as my mom when I was 18 but she became my mom! Never did I ever think of her as a friend, only family! I will miss her beautiful infectious positivity! Her love of life! Going on trips to Disneyland together which was her favorite place to be! She was at every birthday party, bridal shower, baby shower, wedding just as mom! There will forever be an empty spot in my heart. Even now as I am writing this I can still feel her beautiful positive spirit around me! Everyone who truly knew her was blessed by this beautiful soul! I am forever grateful to have had the opportunity to be a part of her life! I hope you are enjoying the Disneyland of the sky! Save a seat for me on Winnie the Pooh! I will forever love you Mom!”\n\nJohn LoPrieno (ex-Cord, OLTL) “Working with Andrea Evans was one of the highlights of my acting career. From the day that she first welcomed me to the set of One Life to Live, through the final reunion episodes that we shot when the show was ending, Andrea continued to be a generous, blissfully comedic and insightful scene partner… I think my finest memory of performing with Andrea was not standing in our bathing suits in the Iguazu Falls in Brazil but working on the Banner newspaper office set on rolling chairs in a playfully choreographed love scene… It was one of my earliest appearances on the show. The magic in the room was palpable, and it offered promises of the great fun that was to be created and enjoyed in the years that followed. We will all miss Andrea and her mischievous looks toward [the] camera at the end of the scene.”\n\nRobin Strasser (ex-Dorian, OLTL): “This is sad to hear. My memories of Andrea Evans are of a woman who was super smart and energized a heat-seeking missile. That’s a compliment/ You knew when you worked with her, it’d be like going head-to-head with a champion. I admired her daring. I hate the disease that took her.”\n\nLiza Huber (ex-Gwen, Passions): “I’m searching for the right words…. Searching for the right story to share or the right words to post that would convey how much Andrea Evans meant to me. What a spectacular human she was and what a tremendous impact she had on my life. The truth is, there are no words. I’m heartbroken and my heart aches for Steve and Kylie. Andrea was a powerhouse. She was a firecracker. She was warm, loving, generous, and wildly funny. We would talk for hours about life, family, love, parenting, work, and how to find the perfect light on set 🌟 She taught me so much about love and keeping my heart open. That’s when I found Alex ❤️ I have a million wonderful memories of this incredible woman. Andrea, I know you are up in heaven watching over your beautiful family illuminated by the most perfectly radiant light 💫 You are a superstar in every way and will be greatly missed.”\n\nEric Martsolf (ex-Ethan, Passions, Brady, DAYS) “We lost Andrea Evans. She was wildly responsible for showing me that working in daytime doesn’t have to feel like work at all. I will miss the sparkle in her eyes when she smiled, which was seemingly all the time. Rest in peace, Andrea, and thank you for all you gave.\n\nErika Slezak (ex-Viki, OLTL): I send love and deepest sympathies Steve and Kylie — they were her whole life. Andrea and I worked together for so long. On her first day at work, she was living one block away from me, and I walked her to work. She was just a child — never been to NYC — so sweet and kind and loving. Amazing that she played such a complicated, confused and selfish character so well. When she and Steve got married and then got Kylie, it seemed her life was finally complete. She was so happy. So very, very sad.”\n\nMelissa Archer (ex-Natalie, OLTL): This is heartbreaking news. Andrea was a kind woman, fun to work with, and such a pro. I feel so fortunate that I was able to play with her on One Life to Live and The Bay. Sending love to all our soap family and Andrea’s real family. World lost a good one.”\n\nFiona Hutchison (ex-Gabrielle, OLTL): “Andrea and I were very close friends during my time on One Life to Live… she and our dear friend Renata Long traveled to England to be bridesmaids in my ( first marriage) wedding to Sean Dromgoole … we were all so young and impetuous!”\n\nKassie DePaiva (ex-Blair, OLTL): “So saddened to hear of this talented actress’ passing She helped put One Life to Live in the spotlight. Cancer sucks!”\n\nMichael Damian (Danny, Y&R): “I’m so very sad to hear the news of my castmate Andrea’s passing. It was so wonderful having had the chance to work with her in the beginning of my career on Young & Restless! She was always so very kind and professional. God bless you, and I will keep you in my prayers always.”\n\nThe Bay the Series: “Sending love to all our soap family and Andrea’s real family. World lost a good one.\n\nThe Bold and the Beautiful: “Our heartfelt condolences go out to the loved ones of Andrea Evans. She will forever be a part of the Bold and Beautiful family. “\n\nThe Young and the Restless: “We are deeply saddened to hear about the passing of Andrea Evans. Her memory will live on in our hearts.”"
