Escaping the watchful eyes of Llanview, Jared and Natalie Buchanan — who now knows Jared is not her uncle, and has fallen into an affair with him — arrive at the Bon Jour. Overhearing their secret, David follows them back to Llanview and blackmails them. As they plan to reveal their ruse to the family rather than pay David, Dorian reveals the secret as part of her takeover of Buchanan Enterprises. Jared is arrested, but Natalie secures his freedom by offering her father Clint his real brother's identity in exchange for dropping the charges. Clint and his brother Bo Buchanan reluctantly agree to her terms on June 18, 2008, and are shocked (and suspicious) at the news that David is their brother. Meanwhile, David marries Dorian's sister Addie Cramer to secure his financial future but reluctantly divorces her in exchange for Dorian saving Viki's life after a car crash. He tries to continue his relationship with Addie as leverage to force Dorian into relinquishing the renamed Cramer Enterprises back to Clint. However, Addie dumps David, as both marriage and divorce were part of an eccentric \"to do list\" that Addie had created after being released from St. Ann's sanitarium.[6]\n\nDavid reappears on December 26, 2008,[7][8][9] calling himself \"David Vickeroshi\" and having \"found peace\" and renounced all worldly possessions as a Buddhist monk.[16] Meanwhile, a codicil of Asa's will is executed based on his heirs' failure to raise the Buchanan Enterprises stock price, and the entire estate is left to David — if Asa's lawyer Beaver Calhoun can find him.[17] Dorian learns of David's paternity and pending inheritance,[18] and plots to marry him or gain his power-of-attorney before he learns the truth himself. They marry on February 9, 2009.[19] With David's paternity revealed publicly, Dorian manages to convince David to shed his Buddhist ways and take his inheritance; the couple soon throw the rest of the Buchanans out of Asa's mansion out of spite for withholding the secret. However, on February 25, 2009 a new paternity test determines that David is actually Bo's son, as Bo had slept with Emma once in 1968 (indirectly caused by Rex Balsom, who represented Bo when he was trapped in the past).[20][21] After talking to Viki about what would truly make him happy, David decides to pursue his dream of an acting career in Los Angeles.[10] Dorian chooses to stay in Llanview to seek her revenge against Clint, and David leaves town on March 2, 2009.[10]\n\nReturns\n\nDavid returned to Llanview in August 2009 after his acting career fails. His teenage half-brother Matthew Buchanan, crippled in an accident, is suing his parents Nora Hanen and Bo for the right to proceed with a dangerous surgery that can cure him. David is revealed to be the one paying for Matthew's legal fees, and later helps Matthew escape from the British boarding school where Bo and Nora have sent him to thwart the legal decision against them. David bonds with Bo but remains in London, later helping Kelly Cramer in February 2010. In an attempt to protect the family, David returns to Llanview once again on April 2, 2010 and blackmails Clint Buchanan's new wife Kimberly Andrews into leaving Llanview. He reappears on June 3, 2010 for Bo and Nora's remarriage. He begins hanging around Viki again much to the chagrin of her husband, Charlie Banks. Meanwhile, Viki offers him a fashion job at The Banner because Charlie and Dorian are working very closely together on another project. Charlie and Viki come up with a plan to help David and Dorian realize they still love each other.\n\nOn August 17, 2010 Dorian and David admit their love for one another and make love. David \"proposes\" and Dorian accepts. On August 18 Dorian and David and Eli and Blair plan on having a double wedding, but that plan was thwarted by Clint who kidnapped David and, by letter, made Dorian believe that David had left her again.\n\nDavid is eventually rescued from his prison cell and is soon reunited with his father and Rex Balsom, who is now his cousin. Upon his return he and Dorian reunite and he saves her from the clutches of Cutter Wentworth, a gold-digging con-artist who was trying to seduce Dorian for her money. Dorian and David then re-marry for the third time. He also is cast in a film based on his life and has Dorian's daughter Langston Wilde write the script for it, while her ex-boyfriend, Markko Rivera, is set to direct it, leading to the pair's romantic reconciliation. David returned from Hollywood, California in June 2011 with Dorian, only to be arguing with each other when Dorian accuses David of having an affair with his co-star Ionia Masters, who plays his onscreen version of his wife Dorian in the big screen biopic \"Vicker Man\". David and Dorian are both unaware that Echo DiSavoy is paying Ionia to seduce David away from Dorian to avenge her for helping Viki to ruin her affair with Viki's ex-husband Charlie Banks, although David is suspicious that someone is setting him up to ruin his marriage. David accuses Clint at first, but Dorian reminds him that Clint's health problems at the time are preventing him from performing these type of machinations towards them. When David later has a conversation with Viki talking to her about all the people he known in his life who would hold a grudge against him, Viki eventually figures out that Echo was the person who was sabotaging his marriage to Dorian. David and Viki later goes to Dorian's La Boulaie estate to tell Dorian the truth, but they both discover that Dorian has vanished from her home. Viki tries to calm David down after his wife's disappearance. Dorian eventually reunites with David at the police station after she was kidnapped by Echo and held hostage at the Minute Man Motel, and was rescued by her seven year old grand nephew Sam Manning while he was wearing a Spider-Man mask! David and Dorian then go back home to the La Boulaie estate where they make love to each other. David and Dorian later attend the premiere of their movie \"Vicker Man\" at the Palace Hotel, where Dorian gets into a confrontation with Ionia because they are wearing identical dresses. David helps break up the fight between them when David has the movie's director Markko send Ionia home in a cab. David and Dorian's movie premiere is unfortunately upstaged by porn producer Rick Powers, when he switches the \"Vicker Man\" movie with his porno flick \"Hold The Diploma\", which stars local Llanview teenagers Nate Salinger and Deanna Forbes. David and Dorian both later learn that Rick put the \"Vicker Man\" movie on the internet. In August 2011, David's agent offered him a role in a big blockbuster movie project that was going to be filmed in Stockholm, Sweden that David gladly accepted. David then told Dorian about the movie role, and wanted Dorian to move with him to Sweden when he does his movie. Dorian then tells David that she can't go to Sweden with him because she got a call to become a senator in Washington D.C. because the previous senator was involved in a sex scandal. David wanted to put his acting career on hold to be with Dorian in Washington D.C. while she's senator. Dorian said that David couldn't do that because he would get bored with her being senator, and cheat on her with another woman. David and Dorian both mutually agree to balance their marriage with their own busy careers, with David going to Sweden to film his movie for three months, while coming back to Washington D.C. on Election Night to be there to support Dorian to win the senatoral election. David then says good-bye to his family and Dorian before he leaves to go do his movie in Sweden. He also says good-bye to his best friend, Viki, after seeing her and Dorian trapped in her mayoral office.\n\nReferences"
