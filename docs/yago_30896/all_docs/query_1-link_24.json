        "text": "So I'm continuing my 1989 binge and I've grown exhausted with The Sarah Gordon Crying Hour. I looked up the ratings for the time, and apparently, the show did well -- a 7.1 for Season 1988-1989 which translates to being the number three-ranked soap of that year. That's impressive, especially with so many shows still on the air. I'm not one to allow ratings to dictate quality to me, however, as tastes differ.\n\nAnyone who watched during that period willing to share their opinions of the show's quality at that time? I literally jumped six weeks ahead at one point, hoping for another storyline. I'm aware that soaps move slowly, but watching Jensen Buchanan mewl and hide and jump is annoying. Meanwhile, Gabrielle is only brought out to look fearful when Brenda gets near Michael Grande's baby. Tina's is nowhere to be found (I know that was due to behind the scenes issues with AE's stalker), and Viki is simply a talk-too.\n\nI wish I liked the Gordon sisters more. I know many viewers consider Megan's death to be an important part of the show's history, but I'm just hate-watching at this point.\n\nDear Friends, This has been a year for the books, my friends, and I most sincerely hope that all of you are well and healthy, and have survived this monstrous year.\n\nI thank God that my family and I are completely vaccinated and boosted and healthy. Unfortunately though, Brian had a bad fall a few weeks ago, and had to have emergency surgery on his back. He is now finally in a wonderful rehabilitation hospital and is working hard to regain the strength in his legs. I come to see him every day, and Michael and Amanda alternate days to visit.\n\nIt‚Äôs been a somewhat busy year: As most of you know, I was pleased to shoot a Hallmark Christmas movie called ‚ÄúNext Stop, Christmas.‚Äù It was great fun and was shot fairly close to where we live, so I could come home everyday. The people on the movie were all so wonderful, and my trailer, where I was keeping my things and resting between shots, was called Rudolph. All the trailers were named after reindeer, but unfortunately mine didn‚Äôt have a red nose on the front. The only hard part of the movie was that it was shot in August when it was 95 degrees outside, and we all had to pretend that it was December, so we were wrapped up in coats and boots and gloves, and really really hot!\n\nAs difficult as this year has been, the bright spot for the fan club is that we celebrated the ‚ÄúGolden Anniversary‚Äù this last October, and you can see the letter I signed back in 1971 to permit Walter to start it. It‚Äôs completely amazing that he and I have known each other for 50 years! I don‚Äôt know how that is possible since I‚Äôm only 39 years old üòÅ. Of all the things we have to be thankful for, I include my many, many years of friendship with Walter, and the fan club that he created. And even though \"One Life to Live\" has ended, the club is still going, thanks to the wonderful folks who run it and take care of it. A great big thank you to Walter and Kit and AJ for their time and patience with me.\n\nI wish all of you a very Merry Christmas and Happy Holiday Season, and I thank all of you for sticking with me all these years. Sending you hugs and best wishes for a Happy New Year and healthy 2022.\n\nLove, Viki Sleestak\n\nR3- I am rewatching these same shows. I had just turned 12 when these aired and a massive fan from 85-94. Early on I only watched with my grandparents in the summers/at holidays) I was a more casual fan later on.\n\nThe critics hated the show post 1987 and for this very year SOD voted it as the most disappointing show. They said it was horribly lit, said the actors looked orange, hated most of the storylines minus Fraternity Row.\n\nConsidering that the show was pretty horrible from 1990-1991, that is no small feat. And it lost some of its biggest stars- Andrea, James DePaiva, and then Fiona (a massive loss in my opinion)\n\nWell I loved it then, and I loved it now. To this day I do not understand Rauch's aesthetic- but the look fits the time. And I read an interview once where the lighting designers were asked why the show was lit so brightly, and the said Rauch wanted the actors eyes to sparkle (they actually do) and for the show to look and feel upbeat (it kinda does actually) The show looked far better earlier in his tenure around 86-88 especially. The storylines moved so fast and SO MUCH happened.\n\nThe background music was a show of itself, and people still talk about this on Youtube- The show had great scoring, probably 2nd to Y&R (even though OLTL's was modern and keyboard based and Y&R's was orchestral/cinematic)\n\nI LOVED Sarah and Megan- and it was clear that show knew Andrea would forced to leave and were trying to find some new female characters who could kind of fit /take over.. Sarah is now backburnered a little in the shows I am watching from 8/89...\n\nIt was not Shakespeare but the show was addictive, suspenseful, and despite what critics said- there was not a show like it on daytime.\n\nATWT, AMC, SB, and Y&R, GL(sometimes) were the critics show's at this time- OLTL was the probably the most derided in the late 80's.\n\nOLTL finally fell to #4 in late 1989 if I remember correctly, and then hit #3 one more time during Mendorra in early 1990. The show then free falled and was pretty bad for 2 years. The show was so bad that it could not even capitalize on the massively rated Natalie in The Well on AMC which proceeded it..\n\nI have rewatched some Gottlieb era stuff on Youtube recently, and I stand by the fact that the show was utterly boring most of the time. It looked amazing (like a different planet from the Rauch era) but the scoring was so boring, the storylines felt like after school specials (Marty's rape was awesome) and there were endless dud characters. I was rewatching some 1993 shows and holy shit- Its really boring. Very intelligent- but horrible.\n\nGottlieb's ratings sucked as well- however Marty's Rape did bring the show to #3 for 1-2 weeks during the rape trial .\n\nR43 I honestly don't know. I read about it in a soap magazine interview she gave many years ago. She specifically mentioned being up for Sarah on OLTL and how B&B wanted her, yet she went with AMC who created Ceara for her. I'm in agreement with those who say it had to be Taylor since Hunter Tylo made her debut there in 1990 which fits the time frame that Jensen left OLTL and Genie joined AMC. The only other option is Caroline since she died from leukemia during that time as well however I think they intended to kill her off then realized they wanted Joanna Johnson back when they created her twin Karen, so irs pretty safe to assume it was Taylor. Again, as someone mentioned, Genie would've been placed in the middle of fan wars either as a recast or in a triangle or both, which she didn't have to worry about as Ceara. And as another person said, they wouldn't have been able to get her back as Laura from B&B like they did from AMC had she played Taylor.\n\nI'm trying to embrace it, R74. All soaps go through shifts depending on the writing regimes, producers, and actors present. It just seems like this period is very much Women in Jeopardy! Not that I mind that sort of thing, but it's taken up most of the plot.\n\nAnother poster wisely reminded me that Sarah/Megan are heroines that the audience rooted for and worried about. My favorites -- Tina and Gabrielle -- were vixens and troublemakers. It's a different dynamic. I'm just missing Tina right now. And during the time I'm watching (Summer 1989) Gabrielle is skulking around trying to hide her secret from Brenda and Michael Grande, so I'm waiting for that to erupt. Gabby will have to pay for that, and I can't wait for the dramatic fallout.\n\nI just realized that my favorites never really \"won.\" Women like Tina, Gabrielle, and later, Blair, usually always got the short end of the stick. They weren't villains, exactly, but they came up short, especially when compared to women like Megan and Sarah.\n\nTheir imperfections only made me root for them more, though. I wanted them to win, even when I knew they wouldn't win. Even when I knew they shouldn't win.\n\n[quote]She was set to take over as Alex when she called up OLTL. They fired Elaine and brought Robin back.\n\nThat's not quite right.\n\nRobin Strasser had a meeting with JFP about taking over the role of Alexandra after Beverlee McKinsey quit GL. However, that's all it was, a meeting. She was never officially cast in the role. JFP was talking to numerous actors about taking over the role.\n\nAccording to Strasser, when she was leaving GL, she ran into a Soap Digest reporter in the lobby. She knew that her being at GL would be reported in the mag and the soap industry would be gossiping about it. Consequently, she made a courtesy call to Linda Gottlieb to let give her a heads up she was a contender for the Alexandra role. Courtesy calls like that are pretty much expected in the soap business if you left the show on good terms.\n\nA few hours later, Gottlieb called Strasser, inviting her to come back to OLTL at Dorian. When she accepted, show said sayonara to Elaine Princi.\n\nR200 80s DAYS from 82-88 was pretty outstanding, and hey had the former GH headwriter, Pat Falken Smith take over and she made DAYS more GH than GH itself by 83-84\n\nMaggie DePriest than took over as headwriter and she would also headwrite AW, OLTL and AMC before the 80s ended! A busy woman\n\n80s. DAYS is very campy, comic booky and romantic at the he same time, te nig story in 1984 episodes I'm watching is Bo and Hope traveling the world and going undercover to get the magic Prisms that Stefano Dimera wants to take over the world, and Stefano has kidnapped Tony and replaced him with his lookalike evil serial killer cousin, Andre Dimera, no one knows Tony is really Andre although Anna Dimera is starting to get suspicious\n\nThere was also a big gang war storyline between The Warriors and The Vipers, with everyone talking with a New York accent, despite the show taking place in the Midwest and filmed in LA, it was The Angel Square on OLTL storyline 10 years before!\n\nCalliope is a campy, drag Queen hoot, this is the character that Andrea Evans should play if DAYS decides to bring Calliope Jones back, her love interest Eugene is an inventor, who built his own robot and is working on his time travel machine\n\nStrasser is known to be a perfectionist. Slee and Strasser got along because Slee recognized the importance of the Dorian/Viki relationship, especially in later years.\n\nSlezak on Strasser: \"I was constantly just floored by what Robin did. I‚Äôd think, ‚ÄúOkay, I can go with this. I know how Viki would react to that.‚Äù It was the most important relationship on the show, those two women. What was it between them? Working with her was always such a treat. Robin didn‚Äôt like doing scenes in a row, because she needed to check dialogue in between. I don‚Äôt like using the word ‚Äúperfectionist,‚Äù but boy, is she one. She is, I think, the person I admire the most of all the actors I worked with on One Life to Live. She lived her character, from the moment she walked through the door in the morning. She would show up on stage, and I would be blown away -- everything about her was Dorian. The nails, the purse, the hair, the wardrobe -- but there was a point to it all, and it was all perfect, and that‚Äôs why she was so freaking good.\"\n\n[quote]You don't think she had a \"chats\" with Jacquie Courtney to remind her whose show she was on.\n\nBut Jacqueline Courtney WAS the star of the show in the late 70s and early 80s. While she was dating the EP, she was the bigwig, the star. It was only after Joe Stuart left to help launch Loving in early 1983 that her status fell.\n\nMeanwhile Viki Sleastack was just a member of the ensemble. She was hardly the star, just a featured player. She was hardly the center of the show. She was someone who went on six month maternity leave and was replaced by Christine Jones who excelled in the role so much, many expected her to replace Sleastack as Viki permanently.\n\nIt was only when Paul Rauch came onboard as EP that he moved Viki to front and center and built the show around her.\n\n[quote]I wonder what would have happened if Paul Rauch never showed up at OLTL, would Jacquie have remained on the show to the end?\n\nApparently, a condition of Rauch coming aboard as a producer in 1983 was that the show had to fire Jacqueline Courtney first.\n\nBut from the moment Joe Stuart left in early 1983, Pat Ashley moved to the back burner. Was barely seen. So when the show fired her six months later, it wasn't especially noticable.\n\nIn fact, I don't know if the show even gave Pat a send-off scene. It may have been that Llanview residents just started referring to Pat as having moved away.\n\nAs for whether Pat Ashley would have stayed on the show, I don't know that she was an interesting enough character to remain front and center for another 30 years.\n\nThat was supposed to be \"Dorian and a,\" in my entry above -- R258. As for Jackie Courtney, it was a big splash when she came in as Pat Kendall, paired with George Reinholt playing Tony Lord, Viki's long forgotten illegitimate brother. The Courtney and Reinholt pairing did not take off as it had on AW. They were both limited actors and Reinholt was downright awful. The plot ended with the death of their son (believed to be the son of Pat's husband but actually the son of Tony Lord), which dovetailed with the Karen Wolek story (it was Karen's rich boyfriend who ran the boy down in a hit-and-run, leading to the reveal that Karen was secretly a hooker). [Pat's husband Paul Kendall was played by the handsome Tom Fuccello, who was later on Dallas and died young.] When the son died, the character Pat went away to mourn, which I thought was a gift to the audience because I couldn't imagine Courtney projecting the emotions associated with losing an only son. Afterwards, they renamed her Pat Ashley, she also played an identical cousin with a terrible British accent, and they tried to pair her with Bo Buchanan. It was agonizing. There was no chemistry and the pairing seemed forced. Then, she simply faded out and eventually vanished, her departure being noted with a passing on-screen remark.\n\nI was thinking about how all soaps have identities. I'm a frequent poster on the P&G threads where some of the elders post about Alice/Steve/Rachel on Another World or Guiding Light's Bauer family.\n\nGH had Luke and Laura. DAYS was known for adventure and dove into the supernatural quite successfully. AMC had Erica Kane.\n\nI was trying to think of OLTL's identity in a sentence or a simple phrase. The show stopped being about social commentary and the haves and the have nots early on. Later on, the show became Viki's Life to Live, but it wasn't always that way since characters like Karen, Tina, Gabrielle, and Megan eclipsed her often. The show went completely bonkers during the mid-90s when it became all about Todd, though I enjoyed much of that ride.\n\nOur show has had so many identities that I'm hard pressed to find one. Maybe that's why I enjoyed it so much.\n\nAny opinions on what OLTL's core identity was?\n\nR288, you have a point to a degree, but remember that those other shows changed tone and direction, also, over the years. For me, in the end, OLTL was about the characters that lived in (or passed through) Llanview. I caught the bug of watching serials as a teen watching Dark Shadows and stuck with OLTL, on an off, through teen and college years. When VCRs came along, I could watch it after work. Occasionally, it exasperated me -- predictability is not a friend of daytime drama -- but many other times it engaged me and sometimes even entranced me. Finding the balance between comedy and drama, between drama and melodrama, between the familiar and the unexpected -- it's hard for the writers and producers, but sometimes it worked. Jennie giving back her baby after discovering the switch. Viki's multiple personalities (Jean, Princess, etc.) emerging and eventually integrating. Marty's gang rape. Billy Douglas. The later years were a roller coaster, but nothing really stuck -- no important stories were told and it was all so plot driven. Great characters like Marty and Marcy were squandered. It was more like popcorn and less like a delicious meal.\n\nI've watched a couple of scenes concerning Jenny returning the baby, R289. Really gripping stuff. Marty's story can still make the hairs on my neck stand on in. Classic storytelling all around. Those Emmys were so well-deserved.\n\nAdaption IS key, R290. The vibe of the 1989 episodes are so different from the later years that it's definitely like watching a different show. I also think if a show catches you or not has a lot to do with where you are in life.\n\nWhen I was little, I was raised on DAYS and its adventurous supercouples and spy sagas. I've not watched seriously since Franco's murder (way back in 1998! when I was 22 years old) and I really don't miss it. I peek in sometimes, but realize that DAYS was more my mom's soap more than mine. I was a teenager in the 90s when I adopted Guiding Light, and an adult when I fell in love with One Life to Live, so those are my mainstays. I also have vast appreciation for early 90s Another World.\n\nI think the last decade of OLTL was about the huge fight over who would get to share John McBain's bed, interspersed with Victor-Todd's tantrums, Rex's search for an identity (he literally had about five backstories) and cartoony visits from villains such as Margaret Cochran, Spencer Truman, and the show's special guest star: Mitch Laurence.\n\nDan Gaultier was by far my favorite Kevin (and possibly my Top 5 actor on OLTL ever) however. I rarely watched during that Higley era as the show was just unwatchable.\n\nTim Gibb's was my 2nd favorite Kevin.\n\nI have to say that despite it being plot driven, lurid, and almost exploitive (at least it exploited and destroyed some characters like Nora) I much prefer JFP's OLTL to Gottlieb's. It was very, very watchable- minus Jen Rappaport. I really loved Hickland and Laurence Lau. I could not stand the first Sam- the dude once married to Karen Allen?\n\nJFP got the show excellent demos after the show was a ratings bomb for 7 years as well as its first Best Show Daytime Emmy nomination in many years. (It must have been17 years?) However, Gottlieb most certainly deserved it in 1994- as the show should have won the year it swept the Emmys and was not even nominated."
