        "text": "\n\nThey were both in and out so quick that you didn't really miss\n\nanything. From what I vaguely remember is that Kelli Maroney's Tina\n\nwas as dumb as rocks, in that vapid cheerleader sort of way. A real\n\ninterchangable \"blond type\" who viewers immediately rejected as Tina.\n\nShe was there for about six months (reportedly quitting because Paul\n\nRauch kept making passes at her.) Marsha Clark replaced her at years\n\nend, but if you blinked you missed her. She was only there for about a\n\nmonth or two. Very un_Tina-like. Sophisticated and composed. In Feb.\n\n'85, the show managed to lure back Evans, who knew how to play the part\n\nright.\n\n\"Tamara Stowers\" <sumrb...@aol.com> wrote in message\n\nnews:1141526160.4...@i39g2000cwa.googlegroups.com...\n\n\n\nI too am very spotty on OLTL, its been years since I really paid any\n\nattention to it. I have enough trouble sitting still for GH, but I remember\n\na Tina, bottle blonde, really cute again in the ditzy blonde cheerleader\n\ntype. But I cannot for the life of me figure out who played her then---she\n\nhad two small children with Cort, both blonde and small---about 4-7 years\n\nold. I looked at all the people they have listed as playing Tina and none of\n\nthem was the Tina I remember--they have the history as:\n\nAndrea Evans (1978 to 1981, 1985 to 1990)\n\nNancy Frangione (1980; temporary)\n\nKelli Maroney (1984 to 1985)\n\nMarsha Clark (1985)\n\nKaren Witter (1990 to 1994)\n\nKrista Tesreau (1994 to 1997)\n\nBut I looked at all of them and none of them match the Tina I recall. Did\n\nsomeone else play her that they didn't list?\n\nThanks!\n\nLaura\n\n\n\nDena Higley seems to be deliberately not returning her. I think\n\nthey're scared to cast another actress to play the role and in the\n\nmeantime are waiting on AE to finally agree to come back. Stupid\n\nreally. Meanwhile as more years past since the last time Tina was in\n\ntown, her necessity becomes less and less.\n\nStone wrote:\n\n\n\nRemember, we're talking about the same idiots in charge who\n\nkilled off Gabrielle, killed and un-killed Al/Michael, sent\n\nMax off into nowhere, did the Colson-is-gay train wreck....\n\nNeed I go on?\n\nNyssa, who wonders how some people keep their jobs"
