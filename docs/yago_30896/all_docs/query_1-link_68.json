        "text": "The Duke of Marlborough has been photographed with his new companion, Doune Murray, on the grounds of Blenheim Palace. Sources have spoken of how the two are officially together following the Duke's separation from his wife of 22 years, Edla, telling Richard Eden, ‘They are a couple.’ Here, revisit this unedited feature first published in May 2022 revisiting the rollercoaster lives of those living at Blenheim.\n\n‘We have nothing to equal this,’ King George III exclaimed to Queen Charlotte upon their arrival to Blenheim Palace in 1786. That was just over 80 years after its cornerstone was laid, the honour of both title and all 2,000 acres of prime Oxfordshire land having been bestowed on the Duke of Marlborough, John Churchill, by Queen Anne as a reward for his victory against the French at Blenheim, Bavaria, in 1704.\n\nParliament voted to fund a palace, but discord arose when, by 1711, the original construction cost predicted by the Duke had bloated from £40,000 to £240,000. The Marlboroughs were cut off, dismissed from court (although the Duchess’s hot-and-cold relationship with Queen Anne, as depicted in The Favourite, probably didn’t help in their plight) and scurried abroad in a self-imposed exile for a few years. Eventually, the couple was able to pour £60,000 into finishing the build, although it did not complete until 1733, 11 years after the Duke had died.\n\nBut Alexandra Spencer-Churchill kept everyone calm, and the evening, hosted in support of the children's charity, Starlight, was a success. The walls of Blenheim Palace were covered with projections of flowers and drinks in the Great Hall preceded a three-course dinner in the Long Library. An auction followed, where Lord Dalmeny whipped guests into a frenzy of excited bidding. The Marquess gave trophies to the rowing team Atlantic Flyers, who had finished the same Talisker Whiskey Atlantic Challenge he completed in 2019. ‘It was a “very proud wife” moment,’ said Camilla Blandford, who dazzled in sapphires and a yellow satin ball gown like Belle from Disney’s Beauty and the Beast.\n\nAll this is just the latest in Blenheim's dazzling history. Here, some of the most notable moments and names associated with the palace.\n\nRead More\n\nFrom MAGA Princess to Miami Barbie… and back again? Ivanka Trump returns to the political stage as her father accepts the Republican nomination after his attempted assassination\n\nLike a phoenix from the ashes, Ivanka Trump is rising again – supporting her father in Milwaukee and after his assassination attempt. But what role will she play in his politics?\n\nNew Guard: the Marquess and Marchioness of Blandford\n\nGeorge and Camilla, the Marquess and Marchioness of Blandford, are bringing glamour back to the palace in spades. He was a polo player, she was his childhood sweetheart and after he proposed in Istanbul, they began planning the wedding of 2020.\n\n600 guests, including the Cadogans, Astors, Cadburys, Sangsters, Bamfords and Harmsworths descended on Blenheim to see the Dolce & Gabbana swathed couple tie the knot. As they rode from the church and into Blenheim Palace in the Rolls Royce formerly used by George's ancestor Winston Churchill, locals waved Union Jack flags in a scene that mirrored American heiress Consuelo Vanderbilt’s marriage to the 9th Duke of Marlborough - or any royal wedding.\n\nRead More\n\nThe rise in the reluctant political spouse: Cambridge-educated Usha Vance may be the wife of Trump’s running mate, but how will this low-key lawyer handle life in the spotlight?\n\nUsha, the high-achieving wife of JD Vance, Trump’s running mate, could be the next SLOTUS. Here’s everything you need to know about the reluctant political spouse who has reportedly ‘never got a B in her life’\n\nAfter the ceremony and reception, guests changed into black tie for a three-course dinner and dancing. The newlyweds crowd surfed, there was an elaborate firework display, aerobatics and huge helium balloons. By the end of the night, it had all descended into bad behaviour. One friend took his clothes off on stage during the afterparty. ‘And one couple “enjoyed” the cricket pitch, which was played on the next day by the unsuspecting local team,’ Camilla told Tatler.\n\nAnd to think, it almost didn’t happen at Blenheim. Camilla said that she had always imagined getting married at her mother’s house in Hampshire, and that it was George who ‘thought it important for us to celebrate Blenheim’. Hear hear.\n\nSocialite Splendour: the 11th Duke of Marlborough (1926-2014)\n\nJames ‘Sunny’ Blandford, the 11th Duke of Marlborough, wed four times in his life, bringing an ever evolving raft of socialites to Blenheim Palace. First, a 10-year union to Susan Mary Hornby gave way to a second, with the famous English-Greek socialite Athina ‘Tina’ Livanos - formerly Onassis. Her 14-year marriage to the infamous Greek shipping magnate Aristotle Onassis over, she moved with her two children Alexander and Christina to live in Lee Place, the summer home near Blenheim.\n\nCrowds gathered outside the church in a celebratory frenzy, but the couple divorced in 1971, and the Duke moved on with the painter Rosita Douglas. Together, they hosted the best of society: Lady Georgiana Boothby, Lady Henrietta Spencer-Churchill, the Marlands, the Arbibs and the Knatchbulls helped them raise £200,000 at a Blenheim fundraiser for Cancer Research in 2000. Divorce came in 2007.\n\nRead More\n\nThe Duchess of Windsor ‘was behind’ a £17 million jewellry robbery, says a new book\n\nDid the disgraced royals fake the famous heist in a bid to raise funds? Some historians believe the truth is murkier than anyone could have imagined\n\nThe Duke's fourth and final wife was Lily Mahtani, the fabulously rich heiress to the multi-billion-dollar Hinduja Group and ex-wife of Nigerian-based tycoon Ratan Mahtani (her divorce settlement was reportedly worth hundreds of millions). The romance bloomed at sea, when they were both invited aboard the Virginian, the 204-foot Bamford yacht. ‘We both love dancing and the same songs, from the 30s and 40s, which they were playing. So we danced all night,’ Lily has said. They married in 2008.\n\n32 years his junior, the Duke's relationship with Mahtani sent shockwaves through high society. But she won them over deftly, with a headstart: Mahtani's circles included the Queen Mother and the Marquis of Cholmondeley. Now widowed by the death of the Duke, Mahtani remains close with the family. ‘I get on incredibly well with Lily, I have a fantastic relationship with her,’ James Spencer-Churchill, the 12th Duke of Marlborough - then the Marquis of Blandford - told Vanity Fair.\n\nPost War Royalty - 10th Duke Marlborough (1897-1972)\n\nLegend has it that Blenheim Palace was earmarked to become Hitler’s main residence when he invaded Britain. For this, it mercifully avoided being blitzed. But it was a huge part of the war effort, hosting first school children and then British intelligence, in service of the Blenheim-born Prime Minister, Winston Churchill.\n\nAt the vanguard of post war opulence and optimism was Christian Dior, who had suffered terrible personal tragedy in the grip of those embattled years, his sister Catherine imprisoned in a concentration camp. It was his clairvoyant Madame Delahaye who assured him Catherine was alive and would return. In 1945, she did. Then Delahaye encouraged him to open his couture house - and he did.\n\nRead More\n\n‘Gold digger’, ‘bimbo’, ‘trapped in a loveless marriage’…, have we got Melania Trump all wrong?\n\nOn the eve of the US presidential election back in 2020, friends, DC insiders and Melania herself told Ben Judah how a small-time Slovenian fashion model rose to wear the mantle of First Lady\n\nHe caught the eye of Princess Margaret, who famously wore a frothy white gown by the couturier for her 21st birthday, and the rest of high society, including the then Duchess of Marlborough, Alexandra Mary Cadogan, a benefactress of the Red Cross charity. She swept across the Channel in her Red Cross outfit to meet with Dior at 30 Avenue Montaigne and convinced him to host a fashion show at the Palace in aid of the charity (he is said to have admired her outfit as setting off 'the chic of her tall figure').\n\nIn 1954, Dior, 100 couture pieces and 14 models arrived, taking over the vast marble hall and salons of Blenheim, walking in the full New Look along the 180-foot Library, where La Marseillaise was played. The guest of honour, Princess Margaret, fizzed in a black dress and fur cape at the fore of 1600 guests who each paid five guineas to attend. Red Cross nurses stood in a line at the side of the catwalk wearing full uniform.\n\nIn 1958, Dior returned to the palace under the leadership of Yves Saint Laurent, and again in 2016 under Maria Grazia Chiuri.\n\nAmerican Import - 9th Duke of Marlborough (1871-1934)\n\nThe poster girl of America’s Gilded Age, heiress Consuelo Vanderbilt married the 9th Duke of Marlborough in the ultimate cash for class transaction in 1895, orchestrated by her ferocious social climber mother, Alva Vanderbilt. She met the Duke at 17 years old at a dinner party given by Lady Paget. 'My hostess had placed the Duke on her right and had put me next to him - a rather unnecessary public avowal of her intentions,' she wrote in her memoir, The Glitter and the Gold.\n\nRead More\n\nPortrait of a Lady: as she marks her 92nd birthday, Lady Anne Glenconner on her extraordinary life\n\nRoyalty, rock stars and marital mayhem: Lady Anne Glenconner has seen it all – and tells even more to David Jenkins\n\nThe story goes that she was all but forced down the aisle, but once the deal was sealed, it secured financing for an increasingly dilapidated Blenheim. The heiress arrived in England and the fortunes of the palace began to change. The 9th Duke was given $2,500,000 of capital stock of the Beech Creek Railway Company in trust, and an annual income of four per cent guaranteed to him by the New York Central Railroad Company, which continued until his death — about £66 million in today's money.\n\nNow chatelaine of England’s most lavish estate, the Duchess set about integrating into the English social set. Winston Churchill was a regular guest, as was Nancy Astor - but ideally never at the same time. ‘She and Winston Churchill were actuated by a strong antipathy one for the other, so much so that one never invited them together, dreading the inevitable explosion,' wrote Vanderbilt. ‘It was therefore unfortunate that on one of Lady Astor’s visits to Blenheim, when my son was host, Winston should have chosen to appear. Nancy, with a fervour whose sincerity could not be doubted, shouted, \"If I were your wife I would put poison in your coffee!\" Whereupon Winston with equal heat and sincerity answered, ‘And if I were your husband I would drink it.’\n\nIn this world of balls and dinners and charity galas, with one of the world's richest women at its helm, the drama was hot and the love affairs hotter. The union lasted only 11 years, and in 2019, a new letter emerged suggesting that Vanderbilt had engaged in many extramarital affairs. 'Reading it today, almost 120 years after it was written, it is impossible not to feel the Duke's anguish, or admire his dignified efforts to do the right thing by his adulterous young wife,' wrote Hugo Vickers in the Daily Mail. Just another slice of the cinematic history of the palace."
