        "text": "Joyce Arlene Vickers, 67, returned home to the Lord on Thursday, May 16, 2024.\n\nJoyce was born on March 7, 1957, in Richwood, West Virginia. A woman of faith and a prayer warrior, Joyce was devoted to serving the Lord, teaching prayer and discipleship through Truly Free Ministry. Along with devotion to her children came the same loving devotion to her grandchildren, whom she deeply loved. In her free time, she enjoyed a variety of interesting hobbies such as sewing, embroidery, quilting, crafting, camping, and genealogy. Her sweet disposition will be deeply missed by those she loved most.\n\nHer parents, Walter “Jack” Woods and Phyllis Tinnel Wills preceded her in death.\n\nHer memory will forever be treasured by her husband of 47 years, David Vickers; children, Michael Vickers (Ivy) of Crestview, FL and Jessica White (Brad) of Bonaire GA; grandchildren, Maxwell, Matthew, Milo, McKenzie, Maddox, Memphis, Isla-Rose, Isabelle; and sister, Bonnie Woods of Craigsville, WV along with many other loving family members and friends.\n\nVisitation will be Monday, May 20, 2024, from 11:00 a.m. until 12:00 p.m. at Church in the Orchard. A funeral service will immediately follow at 12:00 p.m. in the chapel of Church in the Orchard at 881 Taylors Mill Road, Fort Valley, GA 31030. Afterward, Joyce will be laid to rest in Parkway Memorial Gardens.\n\nGo to www.mcculloughfh.com to sign the Online Registry for the family. McCullough Funeral Home and Crematory has the privilege of being entrusted with these arrangements.\n\nTo order memorial trees or send flowers to the family in memory of Joyce Arlene Vickers, please visit our flower store."
