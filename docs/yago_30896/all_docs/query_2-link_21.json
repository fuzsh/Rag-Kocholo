        "text": "Perfect Micro Wedding Planning & Execution\n\nFrom start to finish, the experience with Kara and the Petprom team was nothing short of exceptional. Kara is so helpful and pleasant, and works with you and your budget to bring your dream vision to life.\n\nOur wedding had 11 persons in total, and I felt like the team gave us the same level of professionalism, organization and attention to detail as they would have if it were a 200-person wedding.\n\nOver the course of around 3 months, from dress alteration, planning, florals, venue decor and overall day-of coordination, the team went above and beyond our expectations.\n\nThanks again Kara, Diba, Janique and the team. I would highly recommend Petals and Promises for any event.\n\nKara and her pixie team at Petprom certainly delivered on our big day. We wanted to have a very intimate, romantic but rustic setting and they made it absolutely seamless for us. We are extremely happy we chose Petprom for our decor and additional event management . It is very good to know that you have an extremely competent, well composed team whose judgment and expertise you can rest assured in. Execution was detailed and last minute changes or even bases that you don't consider will be covered. Most of all for us as a couple was to hire a team who enjoys what they do and has vested interest in ensuring our day was a success!\n\nKudos Kara, Diba and the rest of the Petprom pixie team! We are happy you delivered beyond our expectations on our very special day!\n\nPixie Magic\n\nKara and her team made my wedding day move seamless. If there were any issues on the day i was never made aware as Kara ensured my day was stress-free. Kara is extremely professional and always has an upbeat spirit no matter what is happening. Having a wedding during corona wasnt easy but Kara was there to help with all the changes needed during this stressful time. Can't thank them enough!\n\nI am still in amazement and full of joy with how everything turned out for my wedding. Kara was able to pull together all my scattered and non-specific ideas and make it EXACTLY what we wanted and more. I am beyond pleased with all aspects of the wedding and reception. Words truly cannot express how I feel. On the day Kara was in every single place... I honestly don't know how she managed to do that - but she was exactly where I needed her every single time. The only reason I did not give 5 stars on responsiveness was because for the lead up to the wedding it felt difficult to get in touch but now I realize, when Kara is working on a wedding , that wedding is the most important thing and she gives it her all. She is there when it counts and she stays to the very end and makes sure everything is taken care of to the very end, including the finally splitting of the cake for the family. You will NOT be disappointed.\n\nKara and team treated us like family from our initial consultation. They were always available to answer any concerns or questions we had and was always flexible when we wanted to make changes. Our wedding day had a rain delay and the entire Petals and Promises team went into action to reset our ceremony and reception areas. They literally helped to bring our dream wedding to life and I don't know what we would've done without them. We truly felt like royalty on our day! Thank you soooo much to the Petals and Promises team.\n\nI had a beautiful reception thanks to our wedding planners Petals & Promises!!!! We dealt with issues up to 2 weeks before the wedding with venues due to Covid and changes in who could make it and not. In the end we were TOTALLY blessed by what Petals & Promises pulled off along with my mom and her creativity in bringing some things for the wedding down in an extra suitcase. (She made the garlands for our chairs among other things.)\n\nIt was more beautiful than what I could have imagined. 🤩 Our original venue @bellefield876 , which we had canceled due to Covid, became our final venue. Of course I imaged others with us that day (bridal party and missing family 😩) but it felt like a fairytale sitting under the trellis walkway with floating orchids, hanging wisteria, gorgeous birds of paradise, and candles & chandeliers giving us light as the sun went down at dinner."
