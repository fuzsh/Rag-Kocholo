        "text": "Chris Hemsworth Tells Us The One Part Of Making Marvel Movies He Finds ‘Exhausting,’ And I Can See Why\n\nBeing part of the Marvel Cinematic Universe certainly looks like hard work. Playing a superhero requires constant hours in the gym. It means doing a lot of physically exhausting work on set. It means wearing a potentially uncomfortable superhero costume. However, for Chris Hemsworth, it turns out that the hardest part of the job isn’t all the physical exertion, it’s when you do the audio recording of all the physical exertion. Playing Thor requires more than a few grunts, groans, screams and shouts. And because a lot of those noises are needed for off-camera scenes, or because an actor is running around or getting punched in the face, the audio recording for them is usually done after the fact. This ADR is referred to in the industry as “efforts” when an actor comes in to record all the various noises their character makes while they are exerting effort. CinemaBlend caught up with Chris Hemsworth on the red carpet at SDCC and he told us efforts were the most exhausting part because of the way they destroy his voice.\n\n‘I Still Don’t Know The True Story’: Kevin Feige Tells Us About Ryan Reynolds’ Legendary Leaked Deadpool Test Footage, And Why He’s ‘Glad They Did It’\n\n\"Deadpool and Wolverine\" opens in theaters today, and with the film, Deadpool officially becomes part of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, the biggest movie franchise in the world. It’s an impressive run considering that there was a time when there was never going to be a \"Deadpool\" movie. Had it not been for test footage being leaked, we wouldn’t be here today. Even the head of Marvel Studios still doesn’t know what happened, but he's glad it did. Nobody has ever taken credit for the test footage that was leaked online that gave fans a taste of what a \"Deadpool\" movie could be. When it happened, fans were instantly interested in seeing more, which ended up getting the first movie greenlighted. CinemaBlend’s own Sean O’Connell asked Kevin Feige if he has since learned what happened, and it turns out even he is in the dark.\n\nKevin Feige Told Us The ‘Focus’ Of 'The Fantastic Four' Movie, And The Moment He Understood ‘90 Percent Of The Work Was Done’ Master Captions\n\nThe forthcoming \"Fantastic Four\" reboot is among one of the most highly anticipated upcoming Marvel movies that’s set to arrive over the next few years. While there are still details that we don’t know about the film, the information that has been revealed indicates that Marvel Studios wants to put a fresh spin on the iconic quartet of do-gooders. CinemaBlend was just fortunate enough to get some time with studio head honcho Kevin Feige, who shed some light on the film’s development. He not only revealed his team’s “focus” while making the movie but also recalled when knew that “90 percent of the work was done.” Kevin Feige finds himself in an interesting position with this comic book flick, which has a date on the 2025 movie schedule. Like Spider-Man and the X-Men, FF is one of the properties that Feige worked on during the pre-Marvel Cinematic Universe era. CinemaBlend’s own Sean O’Connell spoke to the super producer amid the press day for Deadpool & Wolverine. When O’Connell asked about \"The Fantastic Four,\" Feige spoke to director Matt Shakman’s flair for visuals, before emphasizing the core of the story.\n\nSeth Rogen Had The Best Reaction To Learning That Eddie Murphy Ditched His Iconic Laugh\n\nIt’s fitting that the most iconic laughs of all time come from comedians. Two prime examples of this are Eddie Murphy and Seth Rogen, who both have authentic chuckles that people have been spoofing, mocking or imitating since the start of their respective careers. This was so rampant that when Murphy realized his laugh was the punchline, he dropped it entirely, and Seth Rogen considers the irony of it all to be very upsetting. I recently spoke with Seth Rogen for his new Amazon Prime show \"Sausage Party: Foodtopia.\" When I told him that Eddie Murphy had been consciously suppressing his natural laughter for decades, Rogen not only expressed how much the concept disturbed him, but of course had a hilarious take on it.\n\nKevin Feige Explains Why 'Spider-Man 4' ‘Probably’ Will Replace Jon Watts As Director\n\nThere has been so much buzz surrounding the slate of upcoming Marvel movies, with a new trailer for \"Captain America: Brave New World,\" the official casting announcement for \"The Fantastic Four,\" and the anticipated team up of Deadpool (Ryan Reynolds) and Wolverine (Hugh Jackman) for a movie that lands next week. One hero who has remained a bit in the dark since his last triumphant outing has been Tom Holland’s Spider-Man, a hero that comes with ties to Sony as well as Marvel Studios. Granted, the last Spider-Man movie, \"Spider-Man: No Way Home,\" gave fans the team-up of our dreams, and ranks as one of the best Spider-Man movies ever made. But what is happening with \"Spider-Man 4?\" So far, Spidey’s tenure in the Marvel Cinematic Universe has been under the watchful eye of director Jon Watts, who came on board with \"Spider-Man: Homecoming,\" and helmed all three MCU Spider-Man films. While in New York City to do press for \"Deadpool and Wolverine,\" We got the opportunity to sit down with Marvel Studios President Kevin Feige and discuss the MCU’s future. When we asked about \"Spider-Man 4,\" and whether he anticipated Jon Watts staying with the franchise, Feige told CinemaBlend the following.\n\nEddie Murphy Reveals Why He Intentionally Dropped His Iconic Laugh, And It’s A Bummer\n\nBeverly Hills Cop is a beloved franchise, and new movie \"Beverly Hills Cop: Axel F,\" banks on every nostalgic reference we love about the original two ‘80s films (despite the threequel misfire). One thing that’s noticeably missing, however, is Murphy’s iconic laugh, and it’s been absent from his work for quite some time. Now we know why, and honestly, the reason is kind of a bummer. When I brought up the laugh during our interview for \"Axel F,\" Eddie Murphy was very willing to tell me the whole story."
