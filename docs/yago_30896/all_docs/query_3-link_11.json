However, it isn’t exactly love of family that brings Tina back home.\n\nOn Monday, September 26 look for Tina, along with her beloved canine companion David Vickers (presumably still played by Tallulah Bean), to travel back to Llanview, where she arrives just as the estate of her deceased, long-lost brother Victor Lord, Jr. (Trevor St. John) is being settled.\n\nOnce back in town, she is reunited with fellow siblings Viki (Erika Slezak) and Todd (Roger Howarth), along with a few other family members. Unfortunately for Tina, however, things don’t go quite as expected for the Lord heiress, who has has a run of bad luck. As for doggie David Vickers, look for him to make an important discovery, which could place several lives in jeopardy, including his own.\n\nBut how will Tina take the news, and just how will she react upon learning that her late mother Irene (Barbara Rhoades) is still very much alive? And with Cord (John Loprieno) also returning, will the old flames rekindle their relationship? Tune in to find out!"
