        "text": "Tea visits Todd and finally believes he’s innocent, after he swears on the lives of his children. He tells her about Irene offering him a deal. Tea agrees she’ll represent him. At EOD Todd receives a threat from Irene. Irene visits Viki, ostensibly to apologize. Viki calls Bo and gets confirmation that Irene was released from jail. Viki berates Irene for her treatment of her sons and of her daughter Tina. At EOD Irene says she has one more thing to share with Viki: a gun that she points at her. Blair tries to get Jack to admit he’s lying about Todd’s involvement in Victor’s death. She tells him Todd might get the death sentence. However Dani and Tomas interrupt just when Jack might confess to the lie. At EOD Tea returns home and Blair is about to take off with Jack to keep working on him, when someone enters. He is there about Victor Lord Jr’s last will and testament. Tina travels to Llanview with a mysterious man traveling next to her. Tomas takes responsibility for the fact that Todd had to spend all those years behind bars. John is about to admit to Natalie that he still loves her, when he sees her engagement ring. He learns she’s going to marry Brody. Bo sees Natalie is upset.\n\nTina Lord and her dog, David Vickers, return to Llanview and make a beeline to see her family. At Todd’s house, the lawyer is about to read the will when Tina arrives to the surprise of all. By EOD the reading is back on track and the lawyer announces to whom Victor left the entirety of his estate. Todd freaks when he receives Irene’s note, in which she threatens the lives of all he holds dead. Todd shows Starr the note, which suddenly is unreadable. Starr wants to take the note to John and Bo, but Todd thinks it’s too risky to involve the police. At EOD Todd tells Starr there’s only one thing to do: They must break him out of jail. Natalie tells Rex that she accepted Brody’s marriage proposal. Rex learns that an encounter with John precipitated Natalie’s decision. Rex questions Natalie’s motives. Later, Rex has another vision of Gigi. Jessica confides in Ford that Natalie accepted Brody’s marriage proposal. Ford helps Jessica exorcise her anger. But at EOD she may have some left over when she runs into Natalie.\n\nTina is crushed that there’s no money for her. At EOD, we see that Irene has a plan for Victor’s family: a bomb is planted outside of the house where the family is still gathered. Todd convinces Starr to bust him out of prison. Natalie and Jessica have it out about Natalie’s engagement to Brody and they come to blows. Brody breaks them up and takes Natalie off, leaving a seething Jessica. Brody again asks Clint for his blessing in his marriage to Natalie. Clint argues against the wedding, but Brody is resolute. He suggests that Clint’s approval would go a long way toward healing the enmity between Natalie and Jessica. Clint very much wants to do that, so he gives the marriage his blessing. When Brody goes, Clint gets a visit from someone he’s happy to see.\n\nBlair, Tea, Viki and Jack react to Todd’s escape and the fact that he was abetted by Starr. Todd explains about Irene’s threat. Blair is mad at him for involving Starr. Meanwhile we see the bomb ticking away. Jack is furious about Todd’s escape and surreptitiously calls the cops. Tina reacts to seeing Todd, then tries to enlist him to fight Victor’s will. She reveals Victor Lord Sr’s ring and Todd recognizes it. Todd fights over the ring with Tina. Tea tries to get Todd to turn himself in but he runs off to give the ring to Irene, at the docks. Bo arrives with cops, but Todd is already gone. Meanwhile, the dog sniffs out the bomb. Cord has surprised Clint, and their talk turns to Rex. Cord is upset that Rex is running BE in name only and causing problems. Bo, after discovering the Todd escape and Starr’s involvement, interrupts a heated moment, looking for Todd, and then gets called away. Enter Tina, with Viki. Shane recalls the night of the murder. Rex finds him in Angel Square and Rex admits to Shane that he’s been seeing Gigi. And in fact, this time she left him a note.\n\nTodd and Irene face off. They hear an explosion in the distance. She informs him that was the sound of his family dying. Meanwhile, Tina’s dog, DV, has located the bomb outside Todd’s house. Inside, it’s intense as Bo demands to know where Todd is. Blair, Tea and Starr honestly don’t know where Todd is, only that he went to confront Irene. Bo puts out word to search for them, then turns his attention to Starr. Bo discovers the bomb. Jessica tends to her wounds from her fight with Natalie, and is forced to tell her parents what happened. Viki is upset and goes to talk to Natalie. Clint tells Jessica that he gave Brody his blessing to marry Natalie in the hope that it would bring peace to the family. Tina, after arguing with Cord about her past misdeeds, discovers that her dog is missing. Tina rushes to Jess with the empty carrier, asking if she’s seen the dog. Jessica notices a piece of paper in the carrier. Brody comforts Natalie after the fight. She insists she tried to be nice, but Jessica kept at her. Viki arrives. Brody leaves to join the search for Todd. Natalie is worried that she’s going to lose her mother. Viki questions her about her feelings for John. After a bitter argument, Cord comforts Tina about her dog.\n\nOn the Tuesday, August 30th episode of ABC’s General Hospital, John “Jagger” Cates (Adam J. Harrington) becomes more unhinged as his hatred for Sonny (Maurice Benard) has taken over any sense of reason. First, he tried to get Kristina (Kate Mansi) put behind bars for threatening to kill and harm Ava Jerome (Maura West) during the confrontation that saw Kristina go crashing through a window.\n\nKnowing Cates is using Kristina as a pawn to get to him, Sonny goes into the courtroom as cool as a cucumber, while Alexis (Nancy Lee Grahn) goes before the judge to argue how Cates’ case against her daughter has no merit. The judge gives Cates 48 hours to come up with proof and build a case of the allegations he levied against Kristina, or he is in deep trouble with the law and the FBI.\n\nMeanwhile, Ava (Maura West) and Nina (Cynthia Watros) talk at the gallery where Ava admits what happened when Kristina came to pay her visit the night she fell through the window and lost her unborn baby. When Nina asks what really went down that day, Ava explains that Kristina came to see her after she was issued a subpoena. Ava confirms that Kristina barged into the room and was yelling at her. She then adds that at some point she put her hands on Kristina, but Kristina pulled away, and tripped over some luggage and fell through the window. Ava begs Nina to believe her. Later, Nina make a call to someone calling in a favor.\n\nAfter his case against Kristina goes bust, Cates heads to Ava’s gallery, where he informs her what happened in court. Ava thinks she will really need her lawyer now and she hasn’t heard from Scott. That is when Cates pipes up that she doesn’t need Scott and how she is the only hope he has left.\n\nCates tells Ava that she has to give him a statement, the one he wants and she will give it exactly like he wants her to. Concerned, Ava tries to deflect saying its late and she’s tired so she will deal with it tomorrow. However, Cates shuts her down saying he has 48 hours to get the case together. So, he tells Ava on no uncertain times they are going to start now to perfect her statement.\n\nLaura (Genie Francis) has been summoned to Silver Springs by Lulu’s doctor. Fearing the worst, Kevin (Jon Lindstrom) and Laura show up. Laura finds her brother Cyrus (Jeff Kober) there, too. Meanwhile at Sam’s (Kelly Monaco) place, Rocco (Finn Carr) tells Dante (Dominic Zamprogna, he is waiting to hear his mother’s voice again and for her to wake up one day. Back at Silver Springs, when the doctor arrives, she tells Laura that Lulu’s liver is compromised and if it continues her liver will fail. Laura asks if her daughter is going to die, and we fade to black.\n\nSo, is Agent Cates about to have a rude awakening? Will his plot to force a statement out of Ava fail miserably? Will Lulu wake up sooner than later? Comment below. But first, check out the touching scenes featuring Finn Carr and Dominic Zamprogna from today’s GH.\n\nThis week on The Bold and the Beautiful featured some very awkward and surprising smooches. First, a drunken Hope (Annika Noelle) planted a kiss on Finn (Tanner Novlan) at the Forrester shindig for Brooke’s bedroom line. Then, on the Friday, August 16th episode of the CBS daytime soap opera, Luna (Lisa Yamada) plants a kiss on Dollar Bill Spencer (Don Diamont)!\n\nIn story, Luna comes to see Bill and asks for the results of the latest paternity tests, where he informs her that he is not her biological father. Bill tells Luna that no matter the test results he will always be by her side; given the difficult circumstances which finds her mother, Poppy (Romy Park), in jail as the suspect for Tom and Hollis’ murders.\n\nBill tells Luna he has to assume that Tom was her father. Luna is stunned and says, “Did my mom really kill my dad to keep me from knowing who he was?” Bill is not certain, but the two commiserate in losing each other as dad and daughter. As sad as Luna is, she tells Bill she is so grateful for him. She then says, “Your not my dad, but you’re a man. The most compassionate, strong, beautiful, incredible man I’ve ever met.”\n\nNext, Luna reaches for Bill for a hug, and that is followed by her kissing Bill on the lips! Bill is shocked, while Luna looks eerily happy. What is going on here? Is B&B setting up a triangle between Bill/Luna/Will? Speaking of kisses, Finn is still admonishing Hope for kissing him and is set on telling Steffy (Jacqueline MacInnes Wood) all about it. Hope begs him not to tell, but he says she ruined everything.\n\nSteffy gets a surprise when Taylor (Rebecca Budig) shows up at the cliff house and the two catch-up on all that has gone on with the launch and success of Brooke’s Bedroom line and Steffy’s troubles with Hope and her husband Finn. Steffy says she is glad her mother is here. Taylor says she has her daughter’s back no matter what. The scenes marked the first time viewers have seen the newly cast Taylor with Steffy. Eventually, Finn shows up needing to talk to Steffy. What will he admit?\n\nSo, what did you think of Luna kissing Bill? What did you think of Rebecca Budig in scenes with Jacqueline MacInnes Wood as her on-screen mother? Share your thoughts in the comment section, then check out below a preview for next week on B&B.\n\nIn a very touching moment on the Friday, August 16th episode of General Hospital, Mac (John J. York) finally buried the hatchet with Cody (Josh Kelly) and accepted and acknowledged him as his son.\n\nThe moment is played out after Cody rescues James (Gary James Fuller) from drowning. After he saves the little boy, Mac, Felicia (Kristina Wagner), Sasha (Sofia Mattsson) and Maxie (Kirsten Storms) are all present. James explains he ran away because he doesn’t understand why he has to stay away from Cody. Maxie explains he doesn’t have to anymore and then Mac pipes up that it was his fault that that he couldn’t take riding lessons with Cody.\n\nMac tells James that his feelings were hurt and he was angry, so he took it out on Cody. Next, James asks his grandfather, why he is upset with Cody. Eventually, Mac tells James that Cody is his son. James asks, “Does that make Cody my uncle?” Cody confirms its true.\n\nNext, Mac explains that he recently found out that Cody is his son, but everything that just happened with James, reminded him that family always forgives and loves one another, even in the face of making each other angry at times. After Maxie exits with James, the moment many viewers have waited for goes down.\n\nAn emotional Cody and an emotional Mac, look at each other, when Mac says his gratitude toward Cody knows no bounds for saving James’ life. Cody jokes he sounds like Spinelli, the son he never had. However, Mac says, “But … I do have a son and l’m looking right at him,” to which Cody responds, “And I have a dad.” The two men share a warm embrace as Felicia and Sasha look on.\n\nThat very small moment between father and son was a very big moment in the story. It was played to perfection by John J. York and Josh Kelly. Most of that performance as all in their eyes, making it all the most heart-tugging for viewers of the show.\n\nThis moment in the storyline was a long time coming, since the story was put on hold while John J. York was recovering from treatment for his battle with two blood cancers: myelodysplastic syndromes, or MDS, and multiple smoldering myeloma. York returned to GH on-screen back in June of this year.\n\nWhat did you think of the moment when Cody and Mac truly became father and son to each other? Did it live up to your expectations?
