DESIGNED IN VIOLENCE, WORN IN TERROR, BORN TO DESTROY AND BRUTALIZE A UNIVERSE!

At the edge of space, the Xenon archaeological mission n° 7 is responsible for investigating the remains of a vanished civilization. The expedition takes an unexpected turn when one of the crew, injured in a cave explosion, begins to develop murderous impulses. Soon, a scientist is attacked by an unknown creature in a dungeon. When she wakes up in the infirmary, she has the feeling of having been inseminated by an alien...

Co-produced by Sir Run Run Shaw of the Shaw Brothers and directed by Norman J. Warren ( Satan's Slave ), Inseminoid is a journey to the end of terror from which no one will emerge unscathed. With its intense and nightmarish horror scenes, Inseminoid traumatized a whole generation of spectators who rightly qualified it as a true " Alien from the B series". Presented in its two versions (the VOSTF offers an increased end of five minutes), Inseminoïd is to be discovered for the 1st time on Blu-ray™ in its new 2K restoration!
