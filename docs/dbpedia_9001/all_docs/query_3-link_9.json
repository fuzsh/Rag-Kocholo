We’ve got lakes for skinny dipping, Necronomicons for candle-lit reading, and your esteemed camp counselors: A finer breed of spurned psychos, unstable writers, and sarcastic undead you’ll never meet. That’s right, wastoid, they’re all here and more in our list of the 86 Best 1980s Horror Movies!\n\nAfter the 1970s blew the doors open on horror for mass appeal, and New Hollywood directors became, well, Hollywood, the industry started cranking the movies out by the bloody bucketload. During this hallowed decade of spandex and Spandau Ballet, slashers hit critical bloat (Friday the 13th, Sleepaway Camp), as guffaws mixed in with the guts (Return of the Living Dead, Evil Dead 2). Horror directors who made their name in the ’70s, like John Carpenter and Tobe Hooper, put up valiant fights with The Thing and Poltergeist. And when in doubt, Hollywood just twirled the rolodex to that subtle off-white card with Stephen King’s number on it (The Shining, The Dead Zone).\n\nAlright you sportos, motorheads, geeks, zeeks, bloods, dweebies, and head bangers: See who’s really bad with the best scary 1980s movies that did blast ever so bodaciously from the theaters and out your VCR! —Alex Vo\n\nBest ’70s Horror Movies | Best ’90s Horror Movies\n\nBest 2000s Horror Movies | Best 2010s Horror Movies\n\n200 Best Horror Movies of All Time | Best Horror Movies of 2023\n\n#1\n\nAliens (1986) 94%\n\n#1\n\nAdjusted Score: 109150%\n\nCritics Consensus: While Alien was a marvel of slow-building, atmospheric tension, Aliens packs a much more visceral punch, and features a typically strong performance from Sigourney Weaver.\n\nSynopsis: After floating in space for 57 years, Lt.

During a total eclipse, he discovers an...

Romero's undead trilogy, but it will give audiences' plenty to chew on with its shocking gore and scathing view of society.\n\nSynopsis: The living dead regroup above while humans (Lori Cardille, Terry Alexander, Joseph Pilato) sweat it out below in a Florida...

Romero\n\n#16\n\nThey Live (1988) 86%\n\n#16\n\nAdjusted Score: 92500%\n\nCritics Consensus: A politically subversive blend of horror and sci fi, They Live is an underrated genre film from John Carpenter.\n\nSynopsis: Nada (Roddy Piper), a wanderer without meaning in his life, discovers a pair of sunglasses capable of showing the world...
