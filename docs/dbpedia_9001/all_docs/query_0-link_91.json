        "text": "Category Archives: Uncategorized\n\nAn overdue splurge of cinematic ramblings – My 2021 Film Round-Up\n\nWell, I’m back from a bit of an extended break in film-blogging. Whilst I never really stopped watching films over the past couple years (I mean, the worldwide insanity of 2020 through to 2022 was at least the most fertile ground for saying “oh sod it, lets just stick on another film”), I did however slow down a bit with the writing side of things to focus on my own personal filmmaking projects (of which I shall hopefully have something to show to the world soon…). I’ve recently been going back over some of the films that I did make notes for though and have decided to compile these thoughts into reviews for about twenty or so of wild and wonderful cinematic delights that I have absorbed into my consciousness over the past year from my extensive and ever-growing-much-to-my-partners-dismay collection of Blu-Rays, DVDs and VHS.\n\nDon’t expect anything ‘too’ modern here, I only watched two films that actually came out in 2021 and one of those was No Time to Die, which at the risk of sounding a bit pretentious, is far too mainstream to bother discussing here. I’m sure the world can do without one more opinion on it. There were a small variety of recent films that I really wanted to watch though, like Censor, Swallow and Ben Wheatley’s latest In The Earth. Unfortunately none of these films came to a cinema near me, have come down enough in price on Blu-Ray yet or have even been released in this country (in the case of Censor). Nevertheless I hope to watch and talk about these in the coming months.\n\nI was going to make this my first video blog as I transition my monthly round-ups over to my youtube channel LawrenCinema… but the list got big and I got lazy, so I’ll save that accolade for my pair of reviews for Robert Eggers’ exceptional features The Witch and The Lighthouse, which with any luck will be up within the week.\n\nAs always, I intend to be very considerate with plot points and spoilers when talking about all the films here. I personally get very annoyed myself when film channels or blogs recommend some must-see film to you and then proceed to give away all the key plot points and sometimes even the ending… so I pledge to never do that without prior forewarning.\n\nSo, without further ado and no more preamble:\n\nA Yaphet Kotto Triple Bill Tribute:\n\nBlue Collar (1978) / Bone (1972) / Across 110th Street (1972)\n\n2021 took it’s fair share of talented actors, one of those that I most admired was the one and only Yaphet Kotto. Along with the late great Harry Dean Stanton (with whom he incidentally acted alongside in Alien), Kotto was a rather underrated actor and amongst my personal favourites. Whilst he rarely had top-billing in his filmography, his supporting presence always elevated whichever film he was in.\n\nAs a tribute, I rewatched the excellent Blue Collar from 1978 and two of his films that I had yet to see: Bone and Across 110th Street, both from 1972.\n\nBlue Collar had become a recent favourite of mine thanks its sharp mix of black comedy, well-written characters and probing examination of working class disparity, racial strife and corrupt union politics in 70s America. Kotto stars alongside Harvey Keitel and the comedian Richard Pryor (who also gives a brilliantly nuanced performance here) as three friends and co-workers at a car manufacturing plant. “The machine builds cars and destroys men” reads the tagline of this film, and I would say that it is a pretty brilliant and apt tagline for this sublime work that I loved even more on a second watch.\n\nI won’t say much about the plot, suffice to say that it involves a drunken plan between the three men to ‘get one over’ on their union which goes a little bit awry and sets of a ludicrous chain of events that causes more than a few problems for everyone.\n\nIt runs a small gamut of genres, but never feels at all disjointed thanks to the assured direction and great screenwriting of Paul Schrader (of Taxi Driver and Raging Bull screenplay fame). A personal highlight of the film for me was a debauched party scene at Kotto’s pad that happens early on after the other two make excuses to their respective wives, before indulging in a night alcohol, cocaine, talking shit and fucking on the floor.\n\nThe only thing I could really find fault in, was the unnecessary voice-over at the end. The scene alone spoke volumes without the message needing to be bluntly said out loud.\n\nBone proved to be a subversively entertaining, stylistically inventive and surprisingly funny twist on the home-invasion formula. Giving an excellent performance, Yaphet Kotto is the titular Bone a seemingly simple black handyman who invades the lives a seemingly rich white couple in Beverly Hills. He holds the wife captive in her home and threatens rape and violence unless the husband returns from the bank with money. Of course deception and veneers play a big part in this film and expectations are constantly subverted in cleverly effective ways. Whilst not always successful, the film is chock full of some really interesting, original and playful ideas that manage to alter the dynamics between the three main characters a few times throughout. There’s also some great writing that gives Bone and the housewife some of the film’s best moments together (although the cranky husband has his fair share moments too of course). Overall it’s an obviously rough, but pretty damn solid and daring early work from Larry Cohen.\n\nOn the flipside, Across 110th Street was a very different beast. A tough, tense, spectacularly paced and very serious 70s crime drama that forces a disgruntled old and corrupt white police captain (played by a wonderfully grumpy Anthony Quinn) to work under the reigns of a younger and much more by-the-books black lieutenant (played by Kotto) to solve the case of a daring and murderous $300,000 robbery from the mob in Harlem by three young black men. The mob in Harlem is of course run by big shot Italian gangsters, who lost two of their family in the heist, so send one of their own down to personally oversee things getting ‘straightened’ out.\n\nGrainy low-light cinematography, quasi-documentary style handheld camerawork, stellar performances and a nice funky soundtrack punctuate this grim, violent and effortlessly brilliant work that uses it’s diverse cast of interesting characters to make you sympathise with the plights of every side of the action.\n\nEve’s Bayou (1997)\n\nI found out about this film thanks to a glowing recommendation in an old Siskel & Ebert video on YouTube which I had stumbled upon whilst looking for their opinions on an unrelated film.\n\nMy partner and I were intrigued so I decided to seek out a physical release of it. It turned out however that it was last released over here back in the good old days of VHS – but alas I managed to snag a relatively cheap and much more practical Canadian DVD copy for a few quid.\n\nThe narrative concerns the young middle child of a well-off black family who slinks away from one of their parties to be by herself in the stables. She later wakes up to the sounds and sights of her father cheating on her mother. Her older sister later gaslights her, by trying to convince her that their father would never be unfaithful to their mother.\n\nThe perception of events and the fallibility of memory is a key idea and theme which is explored throughout the film via several interesting plot developments. This idea in itself is something that reminded me somewhat of Phillip Ridley’s The Reflecting Skin (A surreal curio that explores the events of one boy’s summer though his unreliable memory) but in a much more grounded and less surreal manner in this case.\n\nIt was refreshing to see a film of this kind with a strong focus on a black community too and I appreciated the southern gothic vibe with the way in which suburban modernity clashes with superstition and folklore. The superstitious elements in particular are handled really well and don’t ever tip the film’s realist stance on the subject too far one way or the other.\n\nIt was as rich and rewarding as I’d hoped it would be and – with the obvious exception of Samuel L Jackson’s presence (in a subtle, but brilliant performance as the father) – features an ensemble cast that is made up mostly of unknowns. Jurnee Smollett gives a delightful central performance as the young Eve who has an impressive range to convey for a child actor and Debbi Morgan delivers a creepy but nuanced performance as the Aunt who believes she has supernatural gifts.\n\nA strong directorial debut for Kasi Lemmons (who would be most recognisable as the supporting actress in both The Silence of the Lambs and the original Candyman), Eve’s Bayou is one truly underrated 90s gem that is most certainly ripe for a rediscovery now and well overdue the boutique blu-ray treatment. I could imagine this title fitting right at home among the Indicator or BFI catalogue.\n\nSecrets & Lies (1996)\n\nHaving now seen a small chunk of Mike Leigh’s pivotal earlier works (Bleak Moments, Nuts in May, Abigail’s Party and Life is Sweet) I’ve grown comfortable with his uniquely natural approach to characterisation and dialogue. Whilst it’s easy to see works like Abigail’s Party and Bleak Moments as deliciously awkward chamber pieces that revel in the uncomfortable nature of their respective mismatched social gatherings, and Nuts in May as blackly comic snapshot of an odd-couple’s camping trip gone awry – I found it hard to truly pigeonhole Life is Sweet as it felt a bit stuck between a ‘slice of life’ film and a narrative work. Whilst that’s not to say that Life is Sweet was a bad work, I did think that it had more potential.\n\nI jumped ahead in Leigh’s filmography a little bit to watch Secrets & Lies and I realised what I thought was lacking in Life is Sweet. Secrets & Lies pushes Leigh’s style of naturalistic improvisation to it’s fullest potential, by expertly working it into a emotionally gripping narrative of a young black woman’s journey to find her birth mother after her adoptive parents die. This story naturally intersects with troubled lives of a reasonably well-off Photographer (played by Leigh regular Timothy Spall) his partner and their slightly rocky relationship; as well as his sister and niece who begrudgingly coexist together in a cramped council flat whilst they get by working in a box-making factory and as a street cleaner respectively.\n\nLeigh’s ability to devise the most natural and believable characters and dialogue is on supremely top-form here as nothing feels even the slightest bit artificial or hammed-up for the drama, but on the same token it still absolutely feels like a cohesive film, rather than being another chamber experiment or slipping too much into slice-of-life territory.\n\nWhen I took the time to reflect on it upon it afterwards, I couldn’t help but be amazed and impressed when thinking about how hard it must of been for certain scenes to have been shot in one-take whilst theactors remained perfectly in character throughout, no matter how awkward the conversations were. This is impressive enough when thinking about certain scenes with two people, like the diner scene about halfway through, but then I started thinking about the outdoor barbecue scene towards the end which not only features seven people remaining perfectly in character whilst constantly having natural conversation for several minutes whilst eating, but is also wonderfully staged and blocked so that your eyes can be drawn to any person in the frame at any given time (no unnecessary shot-reverse-shot cutaways here!). I’ve still yet to see loads of Mike leigh’s films, but I already feel quite confident in saying this could be his finest achievement in filmmaking. An extremely gripping and thought-provoking work that builds up to one of the most cathartic final acts I’ve seen in a drama of this type… possibly ever.\n\nMidsommar (2019)\n\nSeemingly loathed and heralded as a masterpiece in equal measure, Ari Aster’s Midsommar is a near three-hour long horror film I had been putting off watching the for a while under the assumption that I would fall into the former crowd of naysayers… but I am pleased to say however that I did find rather a lot to like about it.\n\nWhilst I’d be hesitant to call it a masterpiece right away, I have to say that credit must be given where it is due for the film’s sensational atmosphere, which is evoked by the entrancing marriage of its bright cinematography, organic sound design and excellently choreographed ensemble staging. Nearly every scene in the film is meticulously crafted in the summer daylight with vivid hues and striking compositions to lure you in, even during the films more disturbing moments of psychological horror and gory grand-guignol spectacle, which is a refreshing approach to the usual dark tonal expectations of genre cinema.\n\nThe characters themselves aren’t the most likeable bunch but the acting talent behind them is on point, particularly Florence Pugh, who gives an impassioned performance as the emotionally traumatised girlfriend.\n\nAs usual, I’d like to refrain from giving away many plot points, but suffice to say that it reminded me a lot of The Wicker Man spliced with themes of Lars Von Trier’s Antichrist and Shohei Imamura’s The Ballad of Narayama… with a bit of Ben Wheatley’s A Field in England thrown in for good measure.\n\nSo if you’re a fan of any of the above mentioned, and don’t mind a very slow brooding pace, then you’ll most likely be right at home with this weird, unsettling and uncompromising piece of modernist folk horror.\n\nMandy (2018)\n\nAka Nicholas Cage Loses His Shit: The Origins Movie.\n\nI was very pleasantly surprised by this modern, surreal, horror-inflected gem. Drugs, nature, music, religion, mysticism and the occult run through this superbly shot and thoroughly compelling sophomore feature from the director of the modern cult favourite Beyond the Black Rainbow which features a magnificent performance from Nicholas Cage in a role where he speaks surprisingly little dialogue.\n\nThe less said about the plot of this one the better, since it is most effective if you go in blind… but suffice to say if you like your folky horror fantasies with a brooding pace, cosmic colour scheme and a violent streak then you’ll be right at home here.\n\nThe visual style is something you’ll either dig for the most part or find largely frustrating since it takes that Suspiria approach of ‘strange coloured lighting coming from nowhere’ to a whole new level at times. Whilst there were perhaps a handful of scenes which seemed to just be adding an extra bit of visual style for no discernible reason other than to look cool, I did still quite like these touches, particularly at one point during a drugged out scene which was punctuated by blurred coloured movement and distorted speech.\n\nVisual gripes aside, I really enjoyed the ominous mood and sombre pacing of this film’s first half, but I cannot deny how insane and fun it was to watch Cage do ‘his thing’ when things got switched up a little for the second half. There’s also a neat cameo from Bill Duke (from Predator) which I certainly found entertaining.\n\nIt ain’t perfect, but it sure is destined to become a cult classic in years to come.\n\nIn Fabric (2018)\n\nPeter Strickland’s latest feature after the atmospheric and sublime fetishistic character study of The Duke of Burgundy and the surreal psychological-horror-come-Gialo vibes of Berberian Sound Studio, is rich in the same retro aesthetic which both previous films are drenched in.\n\nNarrative-wise In Fabric is by far his strangest outing, with a story that concerns the cult-like aura of a particular fashion shop and a mysterious red dress imbued with murderous sentience. If this summary leaves you with questions that you expect to be answered, then In Fabric may not be the film for you. The film really isn’t concerned with tying things up in a neat bow, instead it relishes at the prospect of violently unravelling the threads of horror conventions and\n\nEssentially a film of two halves concerning two unfortunate owners of the aforementioned dress and, whilst neither half quite manages to build or sustain any real moments of horror from its premise, there is certainly still some fun to be had regardless. There is plenty of surreal originality, striking imagery, a perverse atmosphere and some very sharply written dialogue which dwells upon the surreal and quirky interactions between the strange array of characters. In Fabric is a unique oddity that, whilst not as great overall as his other works, still marks Strickland as a bold and most original modern directors.\n\nBorn of Fire (1987)\n\nBorn of Fire is a visually sublime and surprisingly original piece of Islamic-folklore influenced surrealist horror from the 1980s starring Peter Firth and Susan Crowley. Funded by film 4 and being ostensibly a British production, Born of Fire is quite unlike anything else I’ve seen. The narrative (as far as I could tell) concerns a musician and his astronomer partner who can both hear strange music coupled with visions and an impending sense of doom; all of which seems to be linked to a volcano that’s about to erupt and a mysterious flute-playing Djinn who dwells near this volcano and may be linked to the death of the musicians father…. yeah it’s a bit of a muddle, but believe me when I say that intensely following the plot doesn’t matter all too much when it comes to appreciating this forgotten gem.\n\nTotal narrative logic often gives way to a dreamy phantasmagorical logic which flows brilliantly with the film’s surreal gothic atmosphere. The visuals are superb, the dialogue is sparse and the sound-design is haunting. It will take at least another viewing to fully absorb, but already I find it to be a fascinating work that I would recommend to any fans of films like The Reflecting Skin, Celia, Pan’s Labyrinth or the works of Alejandro Jodorowsky.\n\nIrma Vep (1996)\n\nI went into this one relatively blindly after being intrigued by the following one sentence premise: Hong Kong actress Maggie Cheung plays herself as she winds up in France to be cast in a fetishised remake of the silent film classic serial Les Vampires – despite not speaking a word of French.\n\nRight off the bat I got a very Wong Kar Wai feel from the tone and pacing of this surreal fish-out-of-water drama, I’m sure that feeling is not entirely an accident either considering the Maggie Cheung connection. I loved the natural flow of the dialogue and character interactions coupled with the attention to detail in the the portrayal of the filmmaking process, this in turn made some of the more surreal moments towards the end all the more satisfying. One of the stand out moments for me was the hilariously awkward costume-fitting scene in a local sex shop. All of this quirkiness coupled with the fact that Maggie Cheung is just an absolute joy to watch on screen, made this one of the most surprisingly satisfying French film experiences I’ve had in a while.\n\nThe Tree of Knowledge (1981)\n\nI picked up a European DVD of this rather rare film in a charity shop on a whim for fifteen pence… probably the best fifteen pence I’ve spent all year. The Tree of Knowledge is a thoroughly engrossing and naturalistic Danish coming of age drama following a cohort of thirteen to fifteen year old students filmed over the course of two years. There’s not a tremendous amount of story or narrative as such; instead the film just focuses on the shifting relationships, parties, feuds and shenanigans that naturally arise. I’m unsure how much was improvisational and how much was scripted here, but nevertheless is all worked astounding well to capture the coming-of-age process for these characters quite profoundly. I found it to be a very rich and rewarding work that reminded me a lot of the stripped down and contrivance-free approach to storytelling that Mike Leigh or Krzysztof Kieslowski are usually associated with. I’ll certainly be sure to check out some more films by Nils Malmros in the near future.\n\nHousekeeping (1987)\n\nBill Forsyth’s 1987 adaptation of the Marilynne Robinson novel Housekeeping is the director’s fifth feature film and his first not to be made in the UK following a string of successful independent Scottish features, including the iconic Gregory’s Girl. The film tells the story of two sisters raised by their Grandmother after their mother decides to drive herself off a cliff. Through a series of circumstances, the girls’ peculiar aunt (who also bears a striking resemblance to the deceased Mother) comes to live with them throughout their teenage years.\n\nThis coming-of-age drama has a quirky sense of humour in its exploration of these women’s odd lives together in the small American town of Fingerbone. It has an almost surreal quality at times, particularly during a section of the film where the family carries out their day-to-day activities despite the fact that the bottom floor of their house is submerged in several feet of rainwater due to a recent bout of stormy weather.\n\nThe cinematography makes fantastic use of the films’ picturesque locale, particularly in several shots featuring wide stretching rivers and mountains filling the background action in a way that almost turns the film into a living painting.\n\nThe acting is superb also, with very believable performances from the two teenage girls whose interactions with one another are a delight to watch. The real highlight however is Anne Pitoniak as the aforementioned Aunt who’s worryingly eccentric habits lead to her becoming increasingly detached from reality as the film goes on.\n\nIt’s a wonderfully warm and vibrant piece of filmmaking that explores themes of loneliness, mental illness and cabin fever exceptionally well. Recommended for fans of other surreal coming of age films like Ghost World and Heavenly Creatures.\n\nFruit of Paradise (1970)\n\nVera Chytilova’s follow-up to her colourful and subversive anarchistic feminist masterpiece Daisies is not as bold and innovative in its form and style, but almost as charming in its disjointed surrealist take on the Garden of Eden. Vera’s playfulness with the form and texture of film as an artistic medium still does shine through here, particularly with the film’s sensual, arresting and vibrant compositions of layered imagery in opening sequence. Kaleidoscopes of colour and collages of flowers and natural formations become one with the naked flesh of man and woman as they traverse a strange landscape. It conjured up feelings of Brakhage and Kenneth Anger, whilst still being its own uniquely wonderful piece of experimental filmmaking.\n\nAfter the experimental opening, the film proper reminded me a lot of Bunuel and early Jodorowsky in its playful, almost skit-based style of surreal storytelling. The inventive and eclectic soundtrack also reminded me very much of Walerian Borowczyk’s work, which is always a plus in my books.\n\nI can’t see this being for everyone, given its experimental style, and I would suggest a watch of Daisies beforehand if you’re a newcomer to Vera’s filmography, but if any of the aforementioned name-dropping and stylistic descriptions above have piqued your interest, then go right ahead.\n\nGiants and Toys (1958)\n\nThis colourful sixty-four year old satire about the aggressive advertising campaigns of three warring confectionary companies was made in the early days of television and obviously long before the internet and social media… yet it reads note-perfect as a portrayal of the relentless indictment of how companies (or persons in power) care for nothing more than brainwashing and controlling the masses and their own own workers alike through media manipulation and manufactured idols in the goal of sheer profiteering and total corporate domination…. some things never change, aye?\n\nGiants and Toys succeeds, not only in being a sharp and effective satire, but also in being a stylistically bold, quirky and highly entertaining piece of late 50s Japanese pop cinema and a damn fine early work from Yasuzo Masumura – one of the country’s most prolific cult filmmakers who would go on to create iconic and diverse works like Manji, Irezumi, the haunting Red Angel and the wonderfully surreal and morbid Blind Beast, as well as films in both the eclectic Stray Cat Rock series and the hugely entertaining Hanzo trilogy.\n\nIt features a very endearing performance by Hitomi Nozoe as the poster girl for one of the ad campaigns. One of my favourite moments was a truly spellbinding dance sequence that the filmmakers clearly had a lot of fun with.\n\nOne Cut of the Dead (2017)\n\nI’m usually a bit apprehensive when a new zombie film comes out and gets tons of praise. We’ve been up to our eyeballs in them over the years and it’s difficult for any of them to do something original or fun and remain engaging. One Cut of the Dead however manages to do just that and then some.\n\nStarting with a badly acted zombie attack that is revealed to be a film within a film, One Cut of the Dead quickly establishes its premise of a tired and teasey film crew making a zombie film in an abandoned factory. We swiftly learn that there were rumours of strange experiments in the factory which results in some ‘real’ zombies coming along to get in on the action.\n\nThis premise alone sounds relatively intriguing but that’s not even the half of it when it comes to the twists and turns that this film has to offer along the way. I can’t say anymore without spoiling this insanely satisfying modern gem, except to say that the first part of this film is shot in one astoundingly well-choreographed thirty-seven minute long take.\n\nYou may find yourself scratching your head at certain moments or thinking that this is just a bit too silly, but by the end of this film you will almost certainly be smiling from ear to ear. A neat concept for a low-budget flick that is executed very inventively with a lot of heart behind it.\n\nAntiporno (2016)\n\nAs part of a modern revival project for its infamous ‘Roman Porno’ line of films from the 70s / 80s, veteran film studio Nikattsu gave Japanese enfant terrible Sion Sono free reign to make whatever he desired to as long as it fit the bill. The original proviso of a Roman Porno flick were that a director could make any low budget film of their choice as long as there was a sex scene every ten minutes in it. Sure enough Sono does stick to that guideline but – rather than delivering your average piece of exploitation fare – he instead uses it as an opportunity to deliver something that is truly quite unique…\n\nWhat starts fairly innocuously as a slightly surreal slice of disturbing and black comic arthouse cinema – with the art direction of a Gregg Araki flick on steroids – quickly becomes something much deeper and much more interesting around the 30 minute mark, where the film shifts gears into an angry torrent of ideas that seem to want to tear apart and dissect Japan’s sexploitation past as a whole as well as a woman’s place within it and Japanese family values in general. This torrent is also backed up some even more sublime and supremely colourful art direction which really ties the whole package together as one unforgettably intense filmic experience. Sion Sono has a lot to say, and at 75 minutes he really crams it in. With Antiporno, Sono may have succeeded in delivering a new kind of Roman Porno film… a Roman Porno that’s less concerned about people on screen fucking and more concerned in how it wants to fuck you.\n\nTwo from Bong Joon-Ho:\n\nParasite (2019) / Memories of Murder (2003)\n\nBong Joon Ho delivers his brilliantly stylised and expertly crafted goods again in this utterly brilliant film. Exploring similar class-disparity issues as his English language breakthrough Snowpiercer – but in a less apocalyptic and more satirical manner – Joon Ho’s Parasite manages to build a fantastic and very, very rewarding narrative around its “rich juxtaposed with the poor” theme. This may sound like a very vague description, but it’s honestly the sort of film that is best gone into completely blind.\n\nThe time and attention spent on character-building is exceptional and the blending of blackly comic humour with its more harrowing moments of psychological dread is very effective. The film is shot beautifully too as the camera is utilised brilliantly within the film’s mixture of claustrophobic and wide-open spaces. The director’s use of lateral framing is also on top-form here, particularly in one shot featuring one of the families running through the angular compositions on the city streets in the pouring rain.\n\nInsanely well crafted, dark and unpredictable whilst also managing to be both riotously funny and poignant, even on repeat viewings – it’s not hard to see why Parasite has won as many awards as it has.\n\nBong Joon Ho’s Memories of Murder is an intricate and fresh Korean twist on the police-procedural thriller genre. It sees three very different detectives trying to solve the case of a serial killer and rapist who picks his female victims on rainy nights. Taking inspiration from a real life case and charging the proceedings with his own vital sense of blackly-comic character-driven drama, Joon Ho manages to deliver an excellent piece of cinematic work here. As also evidenced in the rest of his impressive body of work, Memories of Murder appears to be rich in details and nuance, yet it still manages to maintain a clear and focussed narrative thread. The time spent exploring each of the detectives in their various scenes of family downtime and drunken stupor is a subtle but utterly essential element to its brilliance.\n\nThe cinematography and camerawork is also fantastic in a number of ways; most notably it is used brilliantly to make the most out of its rural landscapes and urban environments by either using striking framing for still shots, or utilising movement in subtly excellent ways for the more kinetic stuff. Great attention is paid to the ensemble staging of dialogue and interrogation scenes by letting the actors convey their emotions in wide master shots, rarely cutting to close ups.\n\nI’m sure there’s plenty more to discover upon further watches, but for now I can still comfortably say that this is up there as one of Bong Joon Ho’s best films and easily one of the best serial killer procedural films I have ever seen.\n\nDeath Bed: The Bed That Eats (1977)\n\nDeath Bed: The Bed That Eats has been on my must-see-cult-film radar for quite some time now. Whilst the title alone was surely enough to pique my attention, the fact that It’s cropped up on so many lists of ‘weirdest horror oddities’ and ‘films that need to be seen to be believed’ has only made that curiosity grow. I had to do a double take when I saw it listed on Amazon Prime Video one evening, but once I had determined that it was in fact on there (and with a HD print no less) I jumped right on in.\n\nThe plot, such as it is, concerns a large, demonically-possessed, four-poster bed that has a taste for human flesh and blood which it quenches by dissolving its victims with an acidic foam (…well, you can’t say the title was misleading). The film is largely narrated by a young man who is one of the demon-bed’s victims who has been resurrected and lives in a small hole in the wall behind a painting. Whenever anyone else is killed by the bed, the young man mysteriously inherits a possession they had with them.\n\nThe film is a little narratively jumbled, constantly jumping to various different flashbacks of the bed’s many different owners and victims throughout the years, featuring rich aristocrats, strange brothels and gangsters, whilst the ‘present day’ story unfolds of three young women stumbling upon the bed in an abandoned house on a road trip.\n\nThere seems to be a lot of thought put into low-budget creativity of the film’s death scenes and arty visual motifs as well as the creepy sound design and strangely poetic dialogue. There also seems to be quite a few conversation scenes where the characters lips don’t appears to be moving whilst they are talking, whether this is intentional or an error in the post-production, I kinda liked it and feel as though it added to the general surreal dreamlike fluidity to it all.\n\nWith its strange blend of ideas, Death Bed is a truly bizarre and uncompromising oddity that manages to take a rather silly sounding concept and turn it into something of a folkish, grindhouse, gothic fever-dream.\n\nThey Live (1988)\n\nTo cap off the year I sat down with the family on Christmas day to eat a lovely Christmas dinner whilst watching my mother’s suggestion of John Carpenter’s They Live… hey, I’m sure as hell one could argue that a film which, amongst other things, exposes the ugly face of rabid consumerism is… kinda Christmassy… right?\n\nThey Live is an intelligent and effective satirical rumination on ideology, modern culture, government control and the dumbing down of humanity, all under the guise of a schlocky, but highly quotable and supremely entertaining 80s sci-fi action flick. It’s been a good few years since I last saw this iconic late 80s Carpenter staple, and truth be told it’s aged better than I anticipated, and is a much stronger work than I had previously remembered. Up there with Carpenter’s best works for sure.\n\nMalformed Men, Drug Induced Mania & a Cardboard Minotaur – My March, April & May Film Round-Up\n\nWhoops! It appears I’ve gotten a bit behind with publishing my monthly (ish) filmic ramblings. Rest assured though, I have still been watching and reviewing more of the same weird and wonderful cult-film curiosities, and shall be posting about them all in due course. So without further ado, here’s my thoughts on some stuff I watched about four or five months ago:\n\nThe Orchard End Murder (1980)\n\nDirected by Christian Marnham\n\nClocking in at a very lean 49 minutes The Orchard End Murder is a short – but by no means minor – piece of brilliantly disturbing British horror cinema. This fictitious tale unfolds in such a precise and realistic fashion that takes inspiration from true events. The narrative concerns a young woman who becomes disinterested in her date’s cricket match and decides to go wandering – taking in the sights and sounds of the film’s rural Kent setting – where she stumbles upon the house of an obsessive gnome-collecting train conductor and his psychologically unhinged handyman ‘lodger’ (both played in an effortlessly creepy and superbly effective manner by Bill Wallis and Clive Mantle respectively).\n\nThe film’s strong sense of British realism really sets it apart from the other numerous rural horror / chiller films of its ilk. The cinematography is great, milking the most out of its gorgeous setting, particularly in an unnerving scene that takes place in an overflowing apple orchard. To say much else would take away from this film’s impact and charm, but rest assured it is a fantastic addition to the BFI’s British Flipside collection, and it is well worth the whole 49 minutes of your attention.\n\nDeadbeat at Dawn (1988)\n\nDirected by Jim Vanbebber\n\nThe lasting appeal of Deadbeat at Dawn in the annals of low budget genre filmmaking is a true testament the passion and DIY attitude of its creation. The film’s plot isn’t terribly original – as it concerns violent street gangs and the consequences incurred by our main protagonist who decides to leave one such gang behind and go on the ‘straight and narrow’ with his occult obsessed girlfriend – but it’s a functional plot and it allows the filmmaker (cult favourite, Jim Vanbebber) to really flex his creative muscles in the grim and gritty atmosphere herein.\n\nThe film is drenched with a dirty vibe of drugs and violence that simultaneously felt very realistic whilst also a little surreal and detached. The gruesome practical effects-work on display during some of the film’s more violent scenes really reinforced those feelings. I really dug it; it’s a marvellously scuzzy and hypnotically brilliant piece of super-low budget exploitation filmmaking that I can see myself coming back to a few more times.\n\nBad Timing (1980)\n\nDirected by Nicholas Roeg\n\nBad Timing is a brilliant and rather unsettling 1980 feature from the late British cult filmmaker Nicholas Roeg, starring Art Garfunkel and Theresa Russell. The film starts with Russell’s character being rushed to hospital following a suspected drug overdose. From then on the narrative gradually unravels in a non-linear fashion to tell the story of Garfunkel and Russell’s troubled relationship. Some pieces of this relationship are reminisced through Garfunkel’s memories, whilst others are divulged by an Austrian detective (played in a great supporting role by Harvey Keitel) – who suspects foul play to be involved in Russell’s hospitalisation.\n\nThe film showcases Roeg’s knack for superbly inventive editing – as scenes transition between the present and past memories so fluidly, without disorientating or confusing the viewer in the process. Whilst it may not completely work all the time, for the most part I found Bad Timing to be an excellent examination of the power dynamics at play in a troubled relationship, as well as a brilliant indictment to the power of great editing.\n\nMiracle Mile (1988)\n\nDirected by Steve De Jarnatt\n\nMiracle Mile is a very idiosyncratic blending of romantic drama, black comedy, satire and 1950s era nuclear paranoia.\n\nA blossoming relationship starts to develop between our two main protagonists (Harry and Julie) before a chance power cut ruins a special night out on the town as Harry oversleeps and misses his rendezvous with Julie after her night shift at a diner. He sticks around in the vain hope that he can salvage the night out until he picks up a manic phone-call in a booth from a solider trying to warn his father that the country is now at the brink of nuclear war with Russia and he has 90 minutes to reach safety… thus the rest of the film plays out in real time.\n\nIt’s a thoroughly engrossing film and quite an original blending of genres for its time. The night-time cinematography captures sleaze of city life well and the array of performances are consistently engaging. The keen eyed viewer will also notice an array of actors from various cult 80s films, in the diner scenes particularly.\n\nMatinée (1993)\n\nDirected by Joe Dante\n\nI decided to take a break from my Japanese monster movie marathon (which shall perhaps surface in another blog post) by delving into a cult curio from Joe Dante’s back catalogue that I’d never seen before, Matinée. Matinée is an utterly charming work full of pure warmth and a pulsating love for cult B-movie cinema. Set during the high-tensions of the Cuban missile crisis, Joe Dante’s film follows the exploits of a charismatic sci-fi film-maker (played fantastically by John Goodman) as well as the lives of several kids / young teenagers who live in the town where the director’s latest film is going to be receiving its unconventional premiere.\n\nThe film plays brilliantly on the societal fears and concerns of a nuclear warfare and atomic radiation at the time by framing itself from the perspective of the youngsters and young adults – who are caught between the looming reality of real threat and the exciting escapism of the cinema that’s exploiting it.\n\nGoodman’s director character is brilliantly modelled on the persona and presence of Alfred Hitchcock crossed with the showmanship and ingenuity of William Castle (a horror director who’s gimmicks included rigging the seats in cinema to give the audiences a mild electric shock during his cult feature The Tingler) and Goodman himself clearly has a lot of fun throwing himself completely into the role.\n\nIt is very well written, Intelligent, inventive, funny and entertaining for all ages, this is easily one of the Gremlins director’s most underrated works, and one I will certainly be replaying in the near future.\n\nSchlock (1973)\n\nDirected by John Landis\n\nJohn Landis made his feature film debut with this bizarre slapstick send-up of monster movies and horror flicks. Landis himself stars as the titular Schlock, a 6-foot tall monkey-man (assumed to be some sort of missing link or Yeti) who goes about on a mini rampage killing some people and just being a bit of an all round jerk to everyone else… until he ends up falling for the affections of a blind girl.\n\nI rather enjoyed its stupid blend of screwball humour and super low-key acting. The riffs on monster movie tropes were obvious but still funny and the deadpan delivery of the script’s silliest lines still made me smile. The effects-work is created by a young Rick Baker, who would famously go on to do some of his best work in Landis’s American Werewolf in London as well as David Cronenberg’s Videodrome. Certainly worth a look if you’re already a fan of any of the above mentioned.\n\nDave Made a Maze (2017)\n\nDirected by Bill Watterson\n\nDave Made a Maze is an extremely inventive and quirky modern indie production about a man who gets trapped in his own mystical cardboard maze in the middle of his apartment. The maze is much bigger, much more bizarre and way more labyrinthine on the inside than it looks on the outside – and it’s down to his rather annoyed girlfriend and all of his weird friends to enter the maze and attempt to rescue him whilst avoiding the booby-traps and a half human / half cardboard minotaur. Yep, It is exactly as weird and as offbeat as it sounds…\n\nWhilst the dialogue and characters start out in a rather grating manner in the first act, the film certainly does its best at making up for that once they actually enter the maze. The surreal charm and genuine inventiveness is hard not to love and I certainly found myself grinning at quite a few of the oddball setups. Toilet-roll-tube spikes, flesh-eating origami birds, colourful splashes of confetti blood and a funky animated section where our gang goes down a strange pipe and turns into a crude array of cardboard doll caricatures. I enjoyed it quite a lot by the end and would certainly recommend it to anyone after an engaging piece of 80s low-fantasy throwback fun.\n\nLe Trou (1960)\n\nDirected by Jacques Becker\n\nLe Trou is a very highly regarded French masterwork from the 1960s that is often ranked amongst the finest prison films of all time. Based on true events, the film tells the story of a young new inmate who gets transferred into a cell with four other prisoners who are immediately put on-edge by his presence – since they have to decide whether they can trust him to be compliant with their elaborate escape plan.\n\nUsing stark monochrome cinematography, a gritty sense of realism, tight framing and brilliant use of extended shots, Le Trou weaves its tale with meticulous detail and an excruciatingly tense atmosphere. If you’re after an expertly crafted, gritty, tense and thoroughly engaging prison drama, then look no further than this French classic.\n\nMy Twentieth Century (1989)\n\nDirected by Ildikó Enyedi\n\nIldikó Enyedi’s 1989 feature debut My Twentieth Century is a spellbinding and rather unique work from one of Hungary’s few female directors. This visually sumptuous monochromatic fever dream was filmed using a specific type of black & white film stock, which carried the same light-sensitivity as 1930s Hollywood features – so as to further immerse the viewer in its turn-of-the-century setting.\n\nThe narrative is fairly loose at the start, as the film juxtaposes Thomas Edison’s elaborate and theatrical unveiling of the lightbulb with the birth of two identical twin girls on the other side of the globe. The film swiftly jumps ahead a few years to the point in these now-orphaned girls lives when they are separated one wintery night by two wealthy men who cart them off in opposite directions whilst they’re asleep in the snow. The film occasionally jumps back to Edison’s story, but it largely bares little plot relevance to the story of these two women growing up at the tail end of the 19th century under different societal classes.\n\nIt’s a very quirky film with a lot of surreal touches and a brilliant array of beautifully composed scenes – which all make wonderful use of light and shadow to get the most depth out of the film-stock used. I really enjoyed it on this first watch, but I get the impression it may become even richer on a second. It’s certainly another stellar release from Second Run.\n\nSunrise: A Tale of Two Humans (1927)\n\nDirected by FW Murnau\n\nFW Murnau’s Sunrise: A Song of Two Humans is a 1927 work that is very often celebrated by film enthusiasts as one of the defining features to have been made at the tail end of the silent era. It’s a simple story concerning love, infidelity and self-examination as a man falls out of love with his wife and starts scheming with his new love interest about drowning her and selling his farm to move to the city. Thankfully though he’s not a complete asshole, so when the time comes to do the deed – he hesitates and immediately begs forgiveness. Naturally the wife runs for the hills and jumps on a bus to the city; so follows our man and his many attempts to convince her that he’s changed his mind and still loves her.\n\nIt’s a captivating and utterly charming work that is filled to the brim with warmth, humour, melodrama and exceptional filmmaking craft. It is an essential piece of silent cinema that I would highly recommend for anyone who has a keen interest in the early days of film.\n\nThe Phantom Carriage (1921)\n\nDirected by Victor Sjostrom\n\nAlong with Haxan, The Phantom Carriage is one of the oldest Nordic horror films in existence. Set on a new years eve, this film’s narrative unfolds when a bunch of drunks talk about an ancient myth that states the last person to die before the stroke of midnight is destined to become the driver of death’s horse cart for the whole of the following year. What follows is a relatively simple tale of redemption told in a fascinating non-linear manner that is way ahead of its time. The film also has heaps of atmosphere with its eerie tinted visuals and fantastic ghostly special effects created through inventive use of double exposures. The newly created ‘KTL’ score that I saw it with also added of a further layer of dense gloom to the proceedings with some modern atmospheric drone music to replace the usual orchestral score. The Phantom Carriage is a stellar piece of cinematic horror history that every fan of the genre should certainly check out at some point in their life.\n\nDreams that Money Can Buy (1947)\n\nDirected by Hans Richter\n\nDreams That Money Can Buy is a fascinating filmic curiosity from the 1940s by Hans Richer that features collaborations with several surrealist artists of the time, including Man Ray and Max Ernst. Shot in beautiful technicolor, Hans Richer’s film brilliantly evokes the feeling and atmosphere of the surrealist movement in filmic form through its unusual narrative hook.\n\nThe plot concerns a man named Joe who has the ability to look into himself and others. Joe uses this ability to set up a business where he sells dreams to his clients. It’s through these consultations with his clients that the surrealist collaborative work comes into play as each dream is devised and directed by a different artist. This turns the film into a nicely framed anthology work, which ends up being a very successful way to explore these beautifully lucid visual experiments within the parameters of a feature length film. Its not a perfect film, but it’s a very admirable one that I would highly recommend for fans of Kenneth Anger, David Lynch or Luis Bunuel.\n\nRubber’s Lover (1996)\n\nDirected by Shozin Fukui\n\nPitched in tone somewhere between Videodrome, Eraserhead and Altered States, Rubber’s Lover is a disorientating dip into a sadomasochistic nightmare world of violent drug-induced experiments in an underground laboratory. Filmed in stark black and white and making creative use of sound-design and lighting, Rubber’s Lover is certainly a worthy watch for fans of either the aforementioned Western cult gems and fans of the Japanese cyberpunk inflicted horror of Tetsuo.\n\nHorrors of Malformed Men (1969)\n\nDirected by Teuro Ishi\n\nTeuro Ishi – the infamous cult director of the pinky-violence yakuza classic Blind Woman’s Curse – helms this bizarre and often highly regarded piece of late 1960s Japanese absurdity. What starts as an arthouse erotic mystery in the first half soon gives way to a cavalcade of monstrous perversions in the film’s much more surreal and twisted second half.\n\nSet sometime during Japan’s Taisho period (early 1900s) the film’s narrative concerns a man who escapes a mental institution to realise he shares an identical appearance (and tattoo) with a recently deceased man. Once he assumes the role of this dead man (after literally stepping in to his grave) he soon inhabits his estate – which helps him piece together the fractured memories he has of a nearby island. To say much more would dampen the fun of what lies in the second half… but safe to say it felt like a bizarre Jodorowsky-esque twist on themes and ideas from The Island of Lost Souls with some satisfyingly disturbing moments that reminded me of Cronenberg’s body horror films. It is certainly recommended if you like your gothic horror, gore, erotic imagery and Japanese surrealism in one wholesome package.\n\nCelia (1989)\n\nDirected by Ann Turner\n\nThis 1989 directional debut from Ann Turner is an exquisite low-fantasy coming of age drama about a nine year old girl growing up in the high-tension political landscape of 1950s rural Australia, whilst also trying to cope with the sudden loss of her beloved grandma. She starts making friends with the new neighbours next door, which her father soon forbids when he finds out they are ‘dirty communists’ (despite that not dissuading him from trying to seduce the young and attractive mother of the family). The father attempts to bribe the titular Celia with her very own pet rabbit as a means to get her from staying away from the family.\n\nThe film is ostensibly experienced through the eyes of Celia who also occasionally retreats into her own nightmarish fantasies during the long hot summer that this film takes place in. This film is cruel, but dreamy and utterly fascinating in a way that reminded be of the early 90s cult classic The Reflecting Skin and – to some extent – Pan’s Labyrinth in the way that it effectively captures a child’s slightly fantastical viewpoint of a cruel adult world and the politics therein.\n\nVigil (1984)\n\nDirected by Vincent Ward\n\nVigil is a mezmering and poetic feature film debut from visionary director Vincent Ward. Its haunting blend of rural gothica and coming of age drama – set against the breathtaking backdrop of the New Zealand countryside – creates a profoundly absorbing filmic experience. The film is told mostly from the perspective of a young girl in a farming family who tries to cope with the recent loss of her father in an accidental killing by a mysterious stranger. This situation is made all the more strenuous when the stranger is then hired by the grandfather to work on the farm.\n\nThere’s a timeless quality to the film’s isolated farmland setting that only has vague touches of modernity to it due to the inclusion of vehicles and farming equipment. The isolated setting is the perfect place for the film’s exploration of the shifting relationships between the four main characters (daughter, mother, grandfather and stranger). The brooding tensions are handled effectively and the disturbing hints toward the sexual feelings between the young girl and the stranger are explored with just the right level of subtle ambiguity.\n\nIf you like your dramas with heaps of atmosphere, a hypnotic pace and stunning camerawork then Vigil is worth checking out, particularly if you’re a fan of Tarkovsky or Herzog’s works. It’s certainly made me want to see more of Vincent Ward’s filmography.\n\nGodzilla – Still King of the Monsters?\n\nGodzilla: King of the Monsters (2019)\n\nToho’s giant, lumbering, nuclear lizard celebrates 65 years of major property damage and multiple counts of affray since its titular screen debut (in Ishiro Honda’s masterfully shot original Kaiju / Monster movie classic from ’54, Godzilla) and clearly shows no signs of an early retirement yet with the release of Legendary Pictures’ follow up to the 2014 American reboot. Whilst being a direct sequel to the 2014 Gareth Edwards helmed Godzilla, King of the Monsters also establishes itself as the third instalment of a ‘Monsterverse’ which includes the surprisingly entertaining Kong: Skull Island (a King Kong flick set during the Vietnam war that manages to be a whole lot less of a slog than that Peter Jackson remake in the 00s) and is set to continue in 2020 with another stab at pitting Godzilla and Kong against each other for the first time in nearly 60 years.\n\nSo, with that brief pretext out of the way; does Godzilla: King of the Monsters live up to the hype built by the promise of showing Godzilla going toe-to-claw with some of his mightiest foes from the long-running Japanese series in an all-out big-budget Hollywood extravaganza? In short: not really. Whilst Godzilla: King of the Monsters does manage to deliver in the spectacle of huge CGI titans having big and noisy bash-ups, it unfortunately falls victim to the woes of painfully generic plotting and a complete lack of any real depth – in turn making Gareth Edwards 2014 prequel seem like an arthouse flick by comparison. The Edwards reboot wasn’t perfect, but it managed to pace itself rather effectively, balancing the human drama and monster drama rather well (if was just a shame that the main human characters were too undercooked for me to care too much). If it hadn’t been for the occasionally dumb of unnecessary bit of exposition in the dialogue (every time the film subtly explained something through its visuals, a character had to blurt out the explanation in case you didn’t get it… it felt it didn’t trust its audience’s intelligence enough) and the terrible idea to kill off the film’s only interesting character in the first half of the film, then I’d have called it one of the best American monster films around – instead it has to frustratingly settle for being just a ‘decent’ one… but I must digress. What the 2014 film did get absolutely spot on was the personality of the monsters, as well as the palpable sense and scale of the dread surrounding them, and the effect caused by their devastation – as witnessed from a human perspective. The camerawork reflected all of that beautifully too in the carefully composed angles that always kept things tight and grounded till the final satisfying payoff.\n\nKing of the Monsters conveniently ditches the former film’s sense of realistic dread by instead focusing too much on fan service and big bolshy spectacle. It’s not a terrible thing that the film does this since the design work on the beasts is quite extraordinary and it’s great to see that work in action. The problems lie in the fact that the paper mâché plotting ultimately hinders that action by creating too many moments of fake peril for a bunch of human characters which aren’t tremendously well developed (which could probably be chalked up to the sheer unnecessary size of the cast). Some of the nods and references to past Godzilla flicks were neat, but others felt like they were just shoe-horned in for no good reason.\n\nI had my own personal recap on a selection of some of the original Showa era of Japanese Godzilla flicks before and after watching this in an attempt remind myself with what makes the series so endearing – and then subsequently to decide what exactly made me feel so cold about this new film. Like many people of my age, my first exposure to Godzilla was in seeing the 1998 Roland Emmerich travesty in the cinema… naturally, being a seven year old kid, I loved it regardless of it’s rubishness as I was still high on dinosaur fever after seeing the first two Jurassic Park films a year prior. It was shortly after this time that Channel 4 were screening a bunch of the old Japanese Godzilla flicks in the early hours of the morning around Christmas time. I can’t recall exactly which films I saw (although I strongly suspect Terror of Mechagodzilla was the my first), but the goofy images of men in rubber monster suits duking it out over cardboard city miniatures had stuck in my mind since. Fast-forward twenty years and – upon borrowing some of the old vhs releases from a friend – I was fully expecting to find these flicks to be too goofy to properly enjoy again (especially after developing a strong affinity for the craftmanship of stop-motion animation)… but you know what? They were still endearing to watch. Whether you laughed with them or at them, they were largely filled with charm and the bonkers stories were always interesting. The idea of re-imagining some of these ludicrous stories and iconic titans in a more realistic manner and on a much more grandiose scale sounds great on paper, but maybe it was never destined to work in practice.\n\nTo sum-up: The more I think about it, the more I’d rather rewatch these goofy old slices of Japanese pulp sci-fi half a dozen more times than sitting through King of the Monsters again. Whilst it’s not a ‘bad’ film as such, I feel that Godzilla deserves much better treatment than another run-of-the-mill Hollywood exercise in predicable clichéd filmmaking tropes that are built purely on the purpose of squeezing some money out of patrons and fans via another half-hearted nostalgia trip. If 2020’s Godzilla versus King Kong is to succeed at all, then it better at least lean more on the fun and snappy stylings of Skull Island than on this messy and undercooked affair.\n\n★★\n\nAlien Slugs, Geishas Trafficking Drugs and a Ghostly Tale of S&M – My January & February 2019 Film Round-Up\n\nHere are some more slightly overdue rambles and appraisals of another fifteen or so cult curiosities and hidden cinematic gems – for your reading pleasure – from the start of my 2019 filmic diary. So if you’re after any odd recommendations on this chilly bank holiday Monday evening, then look no further.\n\nWhen a Stranger Calls (1979)\n\nDirected by Fred Walton\n\nWhen a Stranger Calls was a film made at the tail end of the 1970s, before Halloween solidified the ‘slasher’ film blueprint for following onslaught of mindless and gory 80s horror flicks. As a result, this film sits in that neat space where its slasher premise leans more towards a taught psychological chiller rather than being outright horror flick. Most people will be familiar with the twist at the end of this film’s tight, taught and exceptionally creepy opening 20 minute sequence whether they consciously know it or not – since it has indelibly embedded itself into popular culture over time. What will surprise you though is just how meticulously well shot and crafted that sequence is, with stark lighting, nuanced camerawork and a neat score to boot.\n\nAfter that tense opening segment, the film shifts gears almost entirely as it skips ahead several years and builds up a strong psychological character-study based narrative that reminded me of the 80s films Manhunter and Henry: Portrait of a Serial Killer. It reminded me of Henry in the way that it cleverly manages to try and make the viewer sympathise with a psychopath as the film slowly humanises his character; whilst it’s pacing and editing between narrative branches of ‘killer segment’ and ‘detective segment’ reminded me of Manhunter.\n\nThe third act of the film is a slight drop off in terms of intelligent writing as the set up felt a touch too predictable, but it was still admirable enough and only a minor gripe really. On the whole I enjoyed this film a lot and it’s clear to see just how many films have been influenced by it since. The beautifully restored recent Second Sight Blu-Ray release of this film was also a fantastic way to experience it for the first time.\n\nSymptoms (1974)\n\nDirected by Jose Larraz\n\nSymptoms is remarkably intriguing piece of 1970s British rural gothica that seems to have slipped into obscurity over the decades. Thanks to the BFI’s brilliant restoration on Blu-ray, it finally gains a new lease of life. Whilst not a perfect film, it’s hard not to be impressed by its excellently eerie cinematography and sound design – which both really help to punctuate the ominous atmosphere throughout. What starts as an exercise in brooding gothic suspense soon gives way to violent psychological terror here in a work that brilliantly utilises its locale and creates something of a creepier rural twist on Roman Polanski’s Repulsion.\n\nBlack Girl (1966)\n\nDirected by Ousmane Sembene\n\nA young woman from Dakkar takes up the opportunity of working as a maid for an upper class family in France in one of the first important African films of the 20th century. It’s a relatively short and simple character study that examines our titular character’s conflicting feelings about finding a ‘better life’ in France amongst the complete clash of culture and ideals. Black Girl is quite a bleak and depressing work, but it’s brilliantly constructed for such an early example of film from its country, with a style that’s not too dissimilar from British kitchen-sink realism.\n\nInvention for Destruction (1958)\n\nDirected by Karel Zemen\n\nInvention for Destruction (or, The Fabulous World of Jules Verne) is another utterly charming and mesmerising Czech fantasy film from the influential and wonderfully creative mind of Karel Zeman. Zeman’s unique melding of hand drawn illustrative animation and live action filmmaking reaches impressive heights here as he brings this visual treat of nautical steam-punk and science fiction wonder to life by using every single trick up his sleeve. If you’re a ‘pre-CGI’ special effects geek like I am, then you’ll be racking your brain in awe of the sheer variety of visual trickery used to build this fantastic film. It’s just as brilliant as his other works released by Second Run (A Jester’s Tale and The Adventures of Baron Munchausen) and every bit as entertaining as a Ray Harryhausen flick. Essential viewing for anyone who has an interest in creative effects and animation techniques.\n\nThe Cremator (1969)\n\nDirected by Juraj Herz\n\nAs soon as this film kicks in with its wonderfully inventive animated titles sequence – blending cut-out animation and visual collage together excellently – you know you’re in for something a bit different with this quirky slice of disturbing satire from the Czech New Wave. The film is experienced primarily from the perspective of the oddball patriarch of a family crematorium service – complete with his inner monologues and philosophical beliefs affirming his bizarre obsession with his gloomy profession. As the film progresses, so too does the German occupation of Czechoslovakia, which begins to warp both the main protagonist’s ideals and the film’s blackly-comic tone, leading a descent into some dark psychological horror territory. The Cremator is a delightfully harrowing gem that is worthy of its ever growing reputation amongst the ranks forgotten horror cinema classics. With its inventive editing style and surreal blending of tones, there’s simply nothing I’ve seen quite like it.\n\nPolice Story (1985)\n\nDirected by Jackie Chan\n\nJackie Chan’s impressively varied displays of acrobatic kung fu and death-defying stuntwork are an absolute joy to watch in this satisfying Hong Kong detective action comedy (that is also written and directed by the man himself). The plot may be a little thin, but that is certainly no reason to turn your nose up at it, since there is barely a dull moment to be had here. When Chan is not kicking criminal ass, jumping off buildings or clinging onto the sides of speeding busses, he rather successfully tries his hand at visual and physical comedy routines (the scene in the police station answering multiple phones on his own is pure genius in both timing and acrobatics). If you like your Hong Kong action spiked with humour and bravado, then Police Story is the film for you.\n\nThe Killer (1989)\n\nDirected by John Woo\n\nChow Yun Fat flexes his action muscles in this superbly entertaining cat-and-mouse thriller from John Woo’s filmmaking heyday. The plot concerns a hitman with a ‘heart of gold’ who tries to help (and subsequently falls in love with) a bar singer that he accidently blinds during a shootout, and a reckless cop who is determined to catch him at any cost. The plot initially feels like a neat Hong Kong version of Michael Mann’s 90s masterpiece Heat, but soon shifts gears as it enters its later acts, as a Triad syndicate enters the picture. Dazzling displays of balletic action choreography and high-octane gunplay permeate this fantastic and riotously entertaining eastern action romp. It’s clear to see why this film tops many ‘greatest action film’ lists as it is stellar stuff from start to finish.\n\nBlade of the Immortal (2017)\n\nDirected by Takashi Miike\n\nTakashi Miike marks his 100th feature film with this fantastical and sublime samurai revenge flick. Opening with a violent and stylish black and white showdown – featuring our main protagonist taking on a hundred other samurais (losing a hand and an eye in the process). A mysterious old woman gives him ‘bloodworms’ which basically grants him immortality – thus the film’s titular main shtick comes into play. A young girl seeks him out for his unique gift to help her avenge the murder of her parents. From then on, I’d best describe the narrative as samurai reworking of Luc Beason’s Leon by way of The Crow. At 140 minutes I did wonder if this film was going to border on being too indulgent or meandering… but I was pleasantly surprised to find that it was excellently paced and thoroughly engaging throughout. Blade of the Immortal is a fantastic entry into the Miike canon that excellently mixes its balletic and bloody sword fights with well-written characters and the occasional streak of well-timed comic relief moments amongst the madness.\n\nFemale Yakuza Tale (1973)\n\nDirected by Teruo Ishii\n\nFemale Yakuza Tale might possibly be the most mental Japanese pinky exploitation flick I’ve seen yet (and I’ve seen a fair few now as evidenced by this blog…). It’s billed as a sequel of sorts to the infamous Sex and Fury (whose filmic content was just as the title alluded), but there’s not much need to see the former flick before this one since there’s little-to-no carryover in the plot that I could see. Speaking of the plot; from what I could gather it seemed to centre on a Yakuza drug ring that uses women to export drugs inside themselves (three guesses where…). Another young women gets caught up in all the yakuza shenanigans after being framed for a murder committed by a “crotch gouging” serial killer (seriously, that is exactly how the subtitles referred to it…). The plot is definitely bonkers, but it still plays second fiddle to the film’s gratuitous content, which includes copious amounts of female nudity, softcore sex, violent swordfights and geysers of blood (occasionally mixing all of the above to dizzying effect) – all set to a swinging jazz score. It’s a definite recommendation for fans of 70s Japanese exploitation flicks, such as Lady Snowblood, Female Prisoner Scorpion and the aforementioned Sex and Fury.\n\nZigeunerweisen (1980)\n\nDirected by Seijun Suzuki\n\n“Things are at there best as they begin to rot.” exclaims our lead star as he attempts to seduce a diseased woman in this perplexing but spellbinding early 1980s work from the Japanese New Wave auteur Seijun Suzuki. Made after a prolonged absence in film-making since getting axed by Nikatsu in the late 60s (following the controversial reception of his cult masterpiece Branded to Kill), Zigeunerweisen is the first part of a thematic trilogy dubbed ‘The Taisho Trilogy’ and stands as one of the director’s most original works. It’s a hard film to adequately describe – and it has taken me a second watch just to collate some thoughts on it – but if you’re a fan of Japanese arthouse cinema and Lynchian surrealism then you’ll probably be right at home here. Like Heat-Haze Theatre and Yumeji (that make up the following two instalments in this trilogy) you can either try to decipher the deeper meanings within its surrealistic suggestions, or just let its visual and aural atmosphere engulf you. Either way that you choose to experience it, you’re surely in for a spellbinding treat.\n\nJudex (1963)\n\nDirected by Georges Franju\n\nI have been curious about the narrative content of Georges Franju’s Judex after being drawn to it’s bizarre dvd cover featuring a man with a bird’s head carrying a seemingly dead dove. So, knowing very little about the film before diving in, I was surprised that there was actually a logical context for the aforementioned image (it was a masked ball party) – meaning that the film was going to be a little less surreal than I was expecting. Whilst also being a remake of an earlier French film of the same name, Judex manages to be a strange but endearing throwback to the highly expressionist cinema-serials of ‘ye olde’ early days of silent cinema (such as Fantamos and Les Vampires). Rich in both atmosphere and style, I would very much recommend this film to anyone who likes their Noir mysteries with a touch of flamboyant charm.\n\nHer Private Hell (1968)\n\nDirected by Norman J Warren\n\nBritish exploitation provocateur Norman J Warren’s feature film debut Her Private Hell is a sexually charged drama about one young woman’s descent into the cruel depths of the fashion-modelling world. It is hardly the most original narrative concept but it’s a nicely executed work nonetheless, with an endearing and empathetic lead performance by Lucia Modunio and some stylish camerawork to boot. A worthy addition to the BFI ‘flipside’ catalogue that has reminded me that I really need to watch more of Norman Warren’s fun sounding filmography – particularly with such alluring titles as Satan’s Slave and Inseminoid.\n\nThe Whip and the Body (1963)\n\nDirected by Mario Bava\n\nMario Bava delivers the creepy atmospheric goods again in this curious ghostly tale featuring Christopher Lee as a charismatic young heir to a labyrinthine mansion, who returns after some years of exile, only to be greeted with suspicion and hostility its inhabitants. Bava spends the first half of this film fleshing out the interconnecting relationships between Lee’s character and the household, which reveals that he was suspected of murdering one young woman and that he had a kinky sadomasochistic love affair with another lady (who is now betrothed to his brother). It’s in the film’s second half where the more supernatural elements come into play, as suspicion, paranoia and dread fill the air whilst the narrative slowly unfolds into territories of a ghostly nature. Whilst the dialogue is a little on-the-nose and the dubbing is a little on the cheesy side, The Whip and the Body still remains an excellent treat for those who are hungry for more Mario Bava branded Italian gothica.\n\nThe Stendhal Syndrome (1996)\n\nDirected by Dario Argento\n\nDario Argento flexes his 90s muscles Stendhal Syndrome – an ambitious blend of disturbing slasher, psychological horror and supernatural detective flick. The narrative is patchy but functional as Dario’s daughter Asia Argento plays a rookie cop on the trail of a vicious serial rapist who also maims and kills his victims with a razor blade. The film’s titular quirk is that Asia’s character suffers from Stendhal Syndrome – a bizarre condition where the sufferer has vivid hallucinations triggered by witnessing profound works of art before blacking out.\n\nIt’s unfortunately a bit of a mixed bag due to some stilted dialogue, an overly long runtime and some extremely dated mid-90s CGI effects that looked like work-in-progress stuff at best. That being said, it’s not to say that it isn’t worth watching for its positive aspects though, as seasoned fans of Dario Argento or Italian horror cinema in general should be satisfied by the film’s bizarre narrative logic, lurid sexualised violence and vivid surreal imagery. The visual highlight for me was a scene where Asia’s character writhes around naked covering herself in multi-coloured paint in a dark room for… reasons that I can’t actually remember. Not one of the Italian director’s finest achievements, but certainly not one of his worst either.\n\nBloody Moon (1981)\n\nDirected by Jess Franco\n\nOne of the infamous ‘Video Nasty’ titles banned in Britain in the 1980s, Bloody Moon has enticed me for a while with its particularly crude and rather lurid poster artwork. From the outset it appears as though director Jess Franco seems to borrow from the same textbook of nonsensical lunacy and broken film logic that made Pieces such a unique and bizarrely entertaining gem… Bloody Moon however doesn’t quite match the same entertaining heights as Pieces. Whilst there are some brilliant and elaborate practical-effects-heavy death scenes within the second half to elevate this into the territory of a worthwhile cult curio (the sawmill decapitation is fantastic), there are moments between those kills that do tend to drag… there is also a scene where a live snake gets decapitated purely to add to the ‘shock’ factor which I found to be grossly unnecessary – so as such it tainted my overall enjoyment of the film’s positive aspects.\n\nNight of the Creeps (1986)\n\nDirected by Fred Dekker\n\nPart pulpy sci-fi, part goofy ‘frat’ comedy, part zombie horror and all-round certified madness, Night of the Creeps is an interesting concoction that ticks all the right boxes for a fun time. Boasting a simple but effective script, some nice practical-effects work and a genuinely amusing streak of humour, Night of the Creeps is by no means a masterpiece of genre filmmaking, but it’s certainly an entertaining blast for a bit of brainless b-movie entertainment.\n\nHaunted Painters, Badass Hustlers & Watermelon Pornographers – My November & December 2018 Film Round-Up\n\nWell, as the title suggests, the tail-end of 2018 was filled with a variety of filmic oddities for me; including some more weird and wonderful Asian flicks, some high-class world dramas and some fascinating cult curiosities. So without further delay…\n\nLucky (2017)\n\nDirected by John Carroll Lynch\n\nI think I might go out on a limb and say that Lucky is possibly the best film released in 2018. The ninety-one year old Harry Dean Stanton gives one of his finest and most impassioned performances in his final feature film. Lucky is a beautifully shot and brilliantly constructed work full of warmth, humour, loneliness and mortality that felt like a profound love letter to the late, great actor. Mezmerising cinematography of the quaint desert-town setting, a brilliant understated soundtrack and some charismatic supporting performances from Tom Skerritt and David Lynch amongst others. If you like Paris, Texas or David Lynch’s The Straight Story then (you have great taste and) chances are you’ll enjoy this film is as much I did.\n\n3 Women (1977)\n\nDirected by Robert Altman\n\n3 Women is something of a cult curio from the late 70s American new wave, which turned out to be a whole lot more unique than I expected it to be. The film mostly follows the bizarre relationship between a delusional loner who works at a health spa (played by Shelley Duvall of The Shining) and the (even-weirder) new girl who becomes ever so slightly obsessed with her (played by the wonderful Sissy Spacek). The whole film is dripping with a dreamy atmosphere created by the stilted (almost Lynchian) dialogue between these two outcasts and a wonderfully eerie ambient score, which reminded me very much of the Japanese new wave classic Woman in the Dunes. The visual aesthetic is wonderfully surreal too, as it makes interesting use of distorted framing through water and liquids. Whilst I’m not too sure on the director’s intention with using these distorted shots, they are certainly a fascinating choice in combination with the sound design to create a sense of unease. The film’s titular third woman comes in the form of a pregnant artist & bartender (played by Janice Rule), but the film never really spends enough time with her to explore her character fully, leaving an intense air of mystery surrounding her. 3 Women is a very odd film about odd people that makes brilliant use of the filmic medium to create a profound emotional resonance to its narrative and characters, as such it brilliantly contrasts the Hollywood norms of filmmaking. There is nothing quite like it and I’m fairly sure its strange images will continue to play in my mind for some time.\n\nSweet Sweetback’s Baadasssss Song (1971)\n\nDirected by Melvin Van Peebles\n\nSweet Sweetback’s Baadasssss Song was an important milestone for black independent cinema in the early 70s and singlehandedly birthed the ‘blackploitation’ film genre. Written, directed, self-financed by and starring Melvin Van Peebles, this provocative piece of counter-culture cinema became a strong business model for many budding filmmakers outside of the Hollywood system.\n\nRight from the genuinely shocking and rather daring opening sequence, you know this film has every intention of being completely anarchic and against the grain. Whilst some will find this film’s style to be too jarring and messy (if you even manage to make it past the first scene that is…) I personally revelled in its jagged and rebellious punk rock attitude as it reminded me of the early John Waters flicks and Kuchar Brothers shorts that I have grown to love over the past few years. Filled with action, probing racial violence, radical politics, pornographic sexuality and a funky soundtrack… this was a fuckin’ awesome trip!\n\nLes Diaboliques (1955)\n\nDirected by Henri Georges Clouzot\n\nI just about remember watching a rather bland American remake of this story some years ago… however it’s a good thing that I’d forgotten some of the more crucial plot points from it since this is a film that thrives upon you knowing very little beyond it’s vague premise of ‘a perfectly planned murder’. Henri Georges Cluzot orchestrates this taught psychological noir thriller brilliantly with effortlessly tense pacing and an almost gothic dreamlike atmosphere. The two scheming female leads bounce off each other very well and ‘that’ scene near the very end is exceptionally terrifying with its striking imagery.\n\nSchalcken the Painter (1979)\n\nDirected by Leslie Megahey\n\nSchalcken the Painter is a film that was commissioned for the BBC’s Omnibus series of arts programmes and it’s a very unique work of artistically informative gothic horror romance. The director’s intention with this film was to create ‘an arts lecture that turns into a bizarre horror story’ and I would say he utterly achieves that. The voice over narration is used sparingly and to decent effect in this well-paced and minimalist picture that masters the art of showing its narrative ideas, instead of telling them. For something on a restricted TV budget, the visual aesthetic is absolutely superb, with a gothic, candle-lit atmosphere that beautifully evokes the 17th century Dutch art that the film is ostensibly steeped in. The fantastical horror elements of the film are also handled brilliantly, leaving enough room for the viewer to make up their own mind in terms of what to believe. A highly recommend work for fans of creepy gothica, or British classics like Derek Jarman’s Caravaggio, and Ken Russell or Peter Greenaway’s subtler moments.\n\nFour Classic Directors of 50s Japanese Cinema\n\nBloody Spear at Mt. Fuji (1955)\n\nDirected by Tomu Uchida\n\nBloody Spear at Mount Fuji is another classic Japanese film in a long run of Japanese films with ill-fitting English translated titles. The title indicates that it’s going to be some kind of Kurosawa-esque Samurai action film, but instead we have something closer in tone to an Ozu, Mizoguchi or Ichikawa period ‘road’ drama about family and societal class. If you go into this film with those expectations in mind, then your bound to enjoy its pleasant blend of drama and comedy filled with interesting characters, and solid writing that manages to draw you into its world before building up to an electric and emotionally intense final act.\n\nLady Musashino (1951)\n\nDirected by Kenji Mizoguchi\n\nContinuing with the 1950s Japanese theme, it seemed only right to check out another one of the master filmmaker Kenji Mizoguchi’s works. The last bunch of Mizoguchi films that I’d seen had already been period pieces set mostly in the Samurai era, so it was refreshing to see a more contemporary film by him, in the form of the post-war melodrama The Lady of Musashino. As always, Mizoguchi’s direction is fantastic and the narrative themes of sexual politics and family strife within the cultural ‘sea change’ of post-war Japan are brought to fruition through gorgeous camerawork, eye-catching compositions, impressive long-takes and captivating performances. This short – but by no means minor – work also manages to cleverly subvert the more cliché-ridden romanticised notions of tragedy usually associated with this kind of film, during its last act, which actually genuinely ends up becoming emotionally powerful instead of overly melodramatic.\n\nSound of a Mountain (1954)\n\nDirected by Mikio Naruse\n\nI managed to get quite lucky in finding a reasonably priced copy of the long out of print Eureka Masters of Cinema boxset of Mikio Naruse’s later films. As the 1954 feature Sound of the Mountain was regarded by the director as his personal favourite of his own works, it seemed like the next logical place to go with exploring his filmography. In typical Naruse fashion it explores a quiet intimate narrative concerning familial issues and sexual politics in a post-war setting. The story focuses primarily on the close kinship between a young woman and her father-in-law who live in the same house with the woman’s neglectful and unfaithful husband and his mother. It’s a beautifully constructed work that manages to stray away from the usual trappings and clichés of melodrama to display an honest portrayal of inner turmoil created through infidelity and ineffectual family bonds. The subtle technicality of the film is fantastic too with some excellent compositions that manage to show you just what a character is thinking, without having to actually explain it.\n\nFloating Weeds (1959)\n\nDirected by Yasujiro Ozu\n\nIt’s kind of criminal that I’ve gotten as deep as I have into Japanese cinema only having watched one Ozu film (especially since I own 27 of his works across my DVD and Blu-ray collection), so it’s certainly time to start rectifying that. I started my journey into Ozu’s films nearly three years ago with his most highly regarded work Tokyo Story; I was a little taken back by just how gentle and family centric the film was – with very little drama and a style punctuated by extreme minimalism. When I realised the rest of his films were very similar, I decided I wasn’t quite ready for ‘that sort of film’ yet, when there’s still so many samurai flicks and ghostly period dramas to explore. Tokyo Story‘s style has frequently played in my mind though, so it obviously had a subconscious effect on me… anyway, I must degrees.\n\nFloating Weeds is one of Yasujiro Ozu’s much later works (which also happens to be a remake of one of his earliest works) that transposes his minimalist black and white style into gorgeous Technicolor. One thing that cannot be denied about this film is just how damn beautiful every frame and composition is, thanks to his trademark low angle static shots being punctuated with a feverish and dreamlike vibrancy. The film mostly centres on a travelling troupe of stage actors and the family dynamic therein, as well as the relationship between the head of this troupe and a mother and her son living in the town that there show is currently playing at. The film’s themes seem to centre on class issues, which expose how rather abhorrent the main character turns out to be. It’s a very well made film that will completely draw you into its perfectly framed world, if you have the patience to let it. The film’s highlight for me was a magnificently shot shouting match on opposite sides of a street in the pouring rain.\n\nDesert Hearts (1985)\n\nDirected by Donna Deitch\n\nThis 1950s set adaptation of novel titled Desert of the Heart, is a beautifully nuanced examination of the blossoming romantic relationship developing between an older regimented straight woman and a younger carefree lesbian, as well as the prying eyes of the bigoted individuals who surround them. With a great soundtrack, stunning locale, impassioned performances and an assured direction from Donna Deitch, everything all adds up to a winning combination here. It’s easily up there as one of my favourite discoveries of the year.\n\nThe Comfort of Strangers (1990)\n\nDirected by Paul Schrader\n\nThe BFI blu-ray with its Gustav Klimt-esque cover art was too enticing not too pick up when I saw it going cheap in a charity shop (along with a Criterion blu release of Orson Welles F for Fake… yes please!). A very early 90s adaptation of an Ian McEwan novel, The Comfort of Strangers tells the story of a couple holidaying in Vienna in an attempt to work out their relationship issues. They soon fall prey to the obsessions of a mysterious stranger, played in an effortlessly creepy manner by Mr Christopher Walken. Helen Mirrem and the late Natascha Richardson also deliver some decent performances, which, along with the smooth pacing, gorgeous locale and playful eroticism, end up being some fine ingredients to this psychological psychosexual treat.\n\nThe Wayward Cloud (2005)\n\nDirected by Tsai Ming-Liang\n\nThis Taiwanese flick might be one of the most bizarre mixtures of styles and genres committed to film in recent times. Moving from scenes of slow-burning almost dialogue-less romanticised nothingness, to big bold ‘Bubsy Berkly’ stylised musical numbers to behind-the-scenes segments of a hardcore pornography filming crew (occasionally performing less than savoury acts with watermelons…). The way the film drifts between these styles and scenes creates odd moments of dreariness bleeding into bizarre fantasy, and moments of playful romantic eroticism giving way to ugly gratuity. The film is shot really well and there are some fantastic moments amidst some of the slow-burning stuff. The musical numbers are by and large really entertaining too… however the final scene in this film is a bit fucked up in a rather mean-spirited way which almost derails all the good points about the film and might leave you with a sour taste in your mouth as the credits roll… It’s definitely the very definition of a mixed bag.\n\nA Wife to be Sacrificed (1974)\n\nDirected by Masaru Konuma\n\nThis 1970s ‘Pinky’ exploitation flick has been sitting on my shelf for a fair while now since acquiring it amidst a binge of obscure Japanese oddities. The story concerning a women’s ex-husband kidnapping her and forcing her to fall back in love with him through a variety of sexual torture games, reminded me ever so slightly of Pedro Almodovar’s oddball erotic drama Tie Me Up, Tie Me Down… but they couldn’t be further apart in tone. This film manages to get a whole lot more disturbing at times since the male lead is a lot less likable than Almodovar’s Spanish counterpart. It manages to straddle the line at times relatively well between artfulness and fetishism with the way certain scenes are shot, but it’s not quite in the same calibre as In the Realm of the Senses. Recommended only for seasoned fans of 70s Japanese sexploitation.\n\nTwo from Suzuki\n\nYouth of the Beast (1963) / Yumeji (1991)\n\nDirected by Seijun Suzuki\n\nSeijun Suzuki’s directs this supremely fun 60s crime flick with a keen eye for interesting set design and entertaining set-pieces. Backed up by a neat narrative dynamic that recalls Kurosawa’s Yojimbo – in its protagonist playing both sides for fools to achieve his own ends – Youth of the Beast satisfyingly blends absurdity and sensationalism to milk the most out of its pulpy premise with its tongue in its cheek and a wink to the audience. If you liked Branded to Kill or Tokyo Drifter, then chances are high that you’ll dig this.\n\nIn this third part of Suzuki’s thematic ‘Taisho’ trilogy we are treated to a very strange and surreal narrative concerning a painter, the titular Yumeji. It’s a truly bizarre work and, out of the three films in the trilogy, makes the least sense… but I still really liked it. In a way that manages to be ‘even-more-Lynchian-than-David-Lynch’ Suzuki constructs a unique dreamscape of gothic eroticism through his colourful compositions that frame his nightmarish scenes. It’s not for everyone, but if you’re particularly in the mood for a period-set Japanese Twin Peaks, then you should be right at home with this piece of stunningly beautiful nonsense.\n\nFist of Fury (1972)\n\nDirected by Lo Wei\n\nIt’s been close to twenty years since I last saw Fist of Fury – my first taste of Bruce Lee – and I managed to surprisingly remember a fair amount of it through my hazy nostalgic memory of a very late night channel 4 viewing. Between this, The Crow and a host of Bruce and Brandon Lee documentaries, I developed a small obsession with martial arts cinema at the age of 8 or 9… now at the age of 27 I’ve started to get back into it with a vengeance.\n\nBetween Lee’s mind-bending displays of martial arts mastery and the pulpy – but excellently paced – filmmaking craft, Fist of Fury manages to stand tall as one of Hong Kong cinemas most riotously entertaining and action flicks of the 70s.\n\nDeadly Face-Chomping Aliens, Supernatural Serial Killers and a Whole Lot of Eastern Exploitation – My September & October 2018 Film Round-Up\n\nPerhaps a little more belated than usual, but I have finally gathered by musings together on all the good, bad, odd and certifiably insane films I’ve discovered over the past few months. First up is my September and October viewings which is comprised largely of cult exploitation and sleaze from Hong Kong and Europe (plus a few less crazy flicks thrown in for measure).\n\nThe Hong Kong Exploitation Stuff:\n\nThe Oily Maniac (1976)\n\nDirected by Ho Meng-Hua\n\nIf marks could be given for title alone, then The Oily Maniac would be a very hard film to top… fortunately though, it is a bizarre and entertaining enough film to live up to its title’s ludicrous promise. In typical Shaw Brothers fashion, black magic shenanigans and supernatural horror mingle with modern day gang violence and inner city grime to create a blackly comic cult gem. It’s not for everyone, but if you’re a fan of similar Hong Kong horror flicks and gooey low-budget body horror, then there’s a chance you may dig this gleefully mad oddity about a crippled criminal lawyer‘s clerk who turns into a super-strength mass of sentient tar by night. The scenes of the titular character running across rooftops, dropping in on hospital operating theatres to mess shit up and chasing down triads were hugely entertaining to watch.\n\nRick-Oh [Story of Ricky] (1991)\n\nDirected by Lam Nai-Choi\n\nI had heard that this was one of the more mind-melting of the 90s Hong Kong ‘CAT III’ pictures, due to its bonkers blending of genres and ideas (including prison film, martial arts, body horror and splatter)… so naturally I had to check it out. Largely set in a prison, Story of Ricky tells… well, the story of Ricky – a young man with seemingly superhuman strength and demonic powers, who fights back in increasingly brutal ways to try and help the underdogs. The absurd and outlandish death scenes in this film are a work of grotesque ‘Cronenbergian’ beauty, and never cease to surprise and entertain the viewer in their displays of gruesome practical effects work. An extremely fun genre-bender that certainly has to be one of the most inventive Hong Kong flicks of the 90s.\n\nRobotrix (1991)\n\nDirected by Jamie Luk\n\nIn the world of Robotrix a dying person’s consciousness and identity can be electrically transmitted to the body of a robot. When a psychotic rapist killer robot starts causing havoc with his political schemes, a trio of female ex-cop robots must track him down. As this is a Hong Kong flick from the early 90s with the category three rating adorned in that big red triangle on the poster, one can expect that everything in this cheesy martial arts sci-fi thriller will be dialled up to eleven. There are lots of hilariously bonkers set pieces, weird satirical dialogue, excessive gory violence, hilarious soft-core sex scenes and a couple uncomfortably disturbing rape scenes thrown in for disturbing measure… It’s certainly not for everyone, but it’s worth a watch for those who have already dipped their toes in the Hong Kong exploitation pool.\n\nNaked Killer (1992)\n\nDirected by Clarence Fok\n\nMan-hating, martial arts trained, lesbian assassins display their kung-fu moves in this frequently bloody and superbly entertaining Hong Kong action flick from the early 90s. One of the few CAT 3 films to have passed through the British censors unscathed (probably because there’s actually a lack of sexual violence in this one for a nice change), Naked Killer is a true blast to sit through with its ludicrous mixture of violence, satire, cheese and crass humour. It’s definitely a highly recommended starting point for this kind of thing.\n\nThe Untold Story [Bunman] (1993)\n\nDirected by Herman Yau / Danny Lee\n\nFrom the director of Ebola Syndrome (Herman Yau) comes another certifiably insane work of extreme Hong Kong cinema – that also happens to star the charismatic Anthony Wong again. Bizarrely based on true events, The Untold Story tells the tale of an investigation into the disappearance of a family of eight and the recent new owner of the family’s restaurant (whose ‘BBQ pork buns’ are currently the talk of the town…). I don’t want to outright spoil anything with this film, but I highly recommend watching some other Hong Kong exploitation films first to see if you will be able to stomach this film’s disturbing mixture of pitch black comedy and mean-spirited violent content. You may very well feel like you’ll need a shower after this one…\n\nHorrible High Heels (1996)\n\nDirected by Chow Cheng / Chan Wai On\n\nStarting with a rather bleak and unsettling series of opening credits shot in a slaughterhouse, the fascinatingly titled Horrible High Heels quickly gets down to grizzly business as a young woman and her drunk gambling-addicted father are brutally murdered by a masked assailant before being skinned to the bone. The masked assailant is a disgruntled leather-craftsman who decides to make a new kind of imitation-leather from human flesh, which he then proceeds to sell to a local shoe making shop… if that’s not a ludicrous enough premise to draw you in then I don’t know what is anymore.\n\nThe film manages mix genres so much that it actually kind of feels like two or three distinctly different films that have been smashed together in the editing room. There’s never a dull moment to be had in this depraved and weird blend of sadistic slasher-horror, family drama, softcore porno and gangster action flick. The hilariously over the top and prolonged sex-scenes, gruesome practical effects work and layers of action cheese were certainly entertaining highlights for me.\n\nHuman Pork Chop (2001)\n\nDirected by Benny Chan Chi-Shun\n\nFor absurdly brilliant title alone this early 00s Hong Kong CAT III exploitation flick certainly rivals The Oily Maniac… however, a fun watch it is not…\n\nOut of the ten or so Category III films I’ve seen so far now, this one also takes the award for the most mean-spirited and bleak, featuring much less humour and bizarre kookiness to balance out its cruel and sadistic plot. Told mostly in flashbacks through a thorough police interrogation (ala The Untold Story & Dr. Lamb), Human Pork Chop presents the (apparently true) story of a young woman who gets mixed up with a bunch of delinquent drug addicts and pimps who imprison and frequently torture her for their own sick amusement after she tries to take some money from them. Throughout the film’s barrage of cruel and disturbing games we are treated to some of the woman’s backstory through flashbacks, showing us that she has recently become pregnant and is on the verge of turning her life around.\n\nIt certainly succeeds in its aim to create a nihilistic and disturbing experience to make you feel as uncomfortable as possible… however it lacks a certain charismatic outrageousness to its violent nihilism that is present in other Hong Kong gems, such as Ebola Syndrome and The Untold Story.\n\nGeneral Exploitation / Cult Stuff:\n\nThe Girl Who Knew Too Much (1963)\n\nDirected by Mario Bava\n\nThe Girl Who Knew Too Much is one of Mario Bava’s early black & white Gialo features and it is a tour de force in atmospheric style. Whilst I love the feel of Bava’s later films for their inspired use of colour, he still manages to create a visual aesthetic and presence that’s just as dynamic without a diverse colour palette to fall back upon. Playing with shadows, creative camera angles and murder mystery troupes, The Girl Who Knew Too Much is a brilliant and inspired tribute to Alfred Hitchcock films… Italian style.\n\nKill Baby Kill! (1966)\n\nDirected by Mario Bava\n\nFor the second part of this Mario Bava double-dose, I picked out the gleefully named Kill Baby Kill which turned out to be a spectacular exercise in everything the director excels at; including a macabre but mysterious narrative and themes of an occult nature clashing with modernity. Bava also spikes the proceedings with a wonderfully surreal use of colour and lighting to punctuate the gothic set-designs. It will surely take a couple watches to fully soak it all up, but this might very well be up there with Black Sunday as one of the director’s most satisfying works.\n\nPhenomena (1985)\n\nDirected by Dario Argento\n\nDario Argento puts a neat supernatural twist on the ‘Gialo’ slasher formula in this mid 80s work starring Jennifer Connelly and Donald Pleasance. The plot follows a sleepwalking teenager (Connelly) – with a strange telepathic link to insects – as she befriends a wheelchair-bound entomologist (Pleasance) amidst a series of brutal murders happening around the grounds of her boarding school. Together (along with Pleasence’s Chimpanzee assistant) they attempt to uncover the identity of the serial killer by using the girl’s unique gifts.\n\nIt does seem to make a little more sense than some of Argento’s other works, but it still thankfully manages to retain the same phantasmagorical charm and gothic atmosphere that made Suspiria and Inferno so unique and dreamlike. There’s some impressive practical effects work on display for the film’s grisly death scenes, as well as a bizarre soundtrack that adds an element of kitsch fun to the already bonkers mixing bowl.\n\nThe Washing Machine (1993)\n\nDirected by Ruggero Deodato\n\nCannibal Holocaust director Ruggero Deodato delivers the goods here (and I’m not just talking the ‘white electrical’ variety either…) in this bizarre 90s Gialo mystery that blends cheesy thrills, overt eroticism, splatter and neo-noir clichés into one wholesome package. It doesn’t make a whole lot of sense, but that really doesn’t matter since there is plenty of weird nonsense (including people having sex next to open refrigerators on more than one occasion… do these people not care for their electricity bills or the freshness of their refrigerated produce?) to divert your attention away from the scriptwriting. If you’re in the mood for some cheap but efficient Euro ‘Noir’ sleaze, then you can do far worse than giving The Washing Machine a quick ‘spin’.\n\nPieces (1982)\n\nDirected by Juan "
