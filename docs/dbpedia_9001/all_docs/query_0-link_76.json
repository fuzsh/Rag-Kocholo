        "text": "Why I haven’t reviewed Aliens (1986) on this blog before now is because I wanted to keep most of these reviews confined to movies that aren’t so well known, which is also why I haven’t reviewed Alien (1979), Predator (1987), their many sequels, and just about any other movie that may feel cult but also uber famous. But there are a couple of new movies coming out that have a “connection” of sorts to James Cameron’s movie here that I felt I could put them in a much better context if I did a proper review of his film, and so here we are once again, not only reviewing a hardcore memory movie but one that has inspired a whole host of filmmakers in the decades to follow. I’ve done two of these reviews already (The Dark Lurking, The Hybrid), and over time I’ll add more to this category, so look forward to reviews of Doom (2005), Doom: Annihilation (2019), Crawlspace (2012), Dead Mine (2012) and two recent entries, Death Valley (2022) and The Lair (2022).\n\nRidley Scott’s Alien is also in these categories too: a memory movie, famous as fuck, and an inspiration to a lot of others in the filmmaking business. I’ve even reviewed a few of the “rip-offs,” if you’re curious to read them (i.e. Scared To Death,Forbidden World, Galaxy Of Terror, Titan Find). What I love about the four Alien movies is each one has its own tone; Alien was equal parts horror and science fiction; Alien 3 (1992) is known as the nihilistic prison planet movie; and I’m not sure how to categorize Alien; Resurrection (1997); it’s slick looking, it’s more science fiction than horror, and it’s got Ron Perlman and Brad Dourif. James Cameron knew he couldn’t compete with Scott’s film and create something equally novel, so he went in another direction with Aliens; he decided to make it a war movie, with multiple aliens! The basic plot is one you’ve come across at some point in other films, and it’s a simple and effective one: A crew of trained military types is called in to go to a confined location and find out why contact with the confined location has ceased. No one in the unit is even remotely prepared to encounter the kinds of horror(s) that has taken over said confined location and because of their unpreparedness are picked off sometimes one by one, sometimes in a group firefight until either one or two are left alive, or no one is left alive.\n\nAliens starts off with the revelation lone survivor of the Nostromo (name of the ship from Alien), Ellen Louis Ripley (always referred to as simply Ripley) has been in stasis in her escape ship for the past 57 years. A salvage crew just happens to come upon it. In those decades she’s outlived your only child, and the planet they touched down on in Alien has been terraformed into a somewhat livable space for humans; they even gave it somewhat of a name: LV-426. But do we believe the Weyland-Yutani Corporation when they say they’ve had people living on this planet for years and no one’s ever encountered the type of xenomorph Ripley describes in her report? Yes and No. If you’re going to view this movie there are two cuts, the theatrical and the special edition (aka director’s cut). The longer cut is the version you’ll want to watch, not only does it restore smaller scenes throughout it also restores an entire prologue about a family living on LV-426 who go out one day and stumble upon the very alien ship Ripley described, and just like poor Kane from Alien one of them comes back with a facehugger and so the cycle of xenomorphic life is about to begin again. But this discovery was no accident, and in Alien we also learned waking the crew of the Nostromo from hypersleep to investigate this planet was no accident either. Weyland-Yutani knew of this ship and the aliens and Ripley’s theory in Alien that they probably wanted the creature for their bioweapons division is astute. That family in the restored prologue was given orders to investigate this location, thus confirming the corporation knows more than they’re ever telling, but while this planet was terraformed in Ripley’s absence, it would appear they didn’t know the location of this ship until Ripley came back and told them? The coincidence of these two events, of Ripley returning and the aliens being let loose again is never fully fleshed, and as I pen this review I’m just now trying to connect those unconnected dots, exactly how much did the corporation know of the planet and the aliens, is something we may never know. Personally, I don’t look at Scott’s prequels, Prometheus (2012) and Alien: Covenant (2017), to be canon, simply because his origin of the species is too disappointing. I mean, technically, they are cannon, but I don’t ever refer to them for the answers I seek. In fact I’ve never seen Covenant, and probably never will. I prefer to pretend they don’t exist, and I don’t have any desire to see that Alien series, or that new Alien movie, in the works either. The ambiguity of the xenomorphs origins and Weyland-Yutani connection is better that way; besides in my imagination the xenomorphs have a more horrific Lovecraftian origin, something so unnamable ambiguity is the only way you could understand it.\n\nAliens has five noteworthy actors, three of which are extra noteworthy: Michael Beihn plays Corporal Dwayne Hicks (restored footage has him telling Ripley his first name); Bill Paxton plays Pvt. Hudson; Lance Henriksen plays Bishop (an android); Jenette Goldstein plays Pvt. Vasquez; and William Hope plays Gorman, the inexperienced commanding officer. Beihn, Paxton and Henriksen have worked with Cameron before, in fact all three were in The Terminator (1984). Paxton having the shortest screen time playing one of the three punks the Terminator bumps into after arriving in our time stream, naked and looking for clothing; Henriksen was Detective Vukovich, both Paxton and Henriksen ended up getting killed by the cyborg, while Beihn was the movie’s hero, Kyle Reese – yes, he too ended up getting killed by the cyborg, but at least he managed to make it almost to the ending. Henriksen appears to have collaborated with Cameron long before, playing Police Chief Steve Kimbrough in his Piranha II: The Spawning (1981). All three have had roles in other Cameron movies since Aliens, with Paxton co-starring in the modern day segments of Titanic (1997) and being a “comic relief” in a subplot in True Lies (1994) that also starred the Terminator himself, Arnold Schwarzenegger, as an American spy fighting terrorists. True Lies marks the second time Paxton is killed by Schwarzenegger, except in Lies it’s a nanosecond “daydream” because he mistakenly thinks the man is having an affair with his wife and he fantasizes about hitting the guy so hard in the face it kills him. Beihn’s collaboration with Cameron has gotten him three lead roles, the third one being the mentally ill antagonist in The Abyss (1989); a SEAL team leader who never planned to be the “bad guy” but ends up suffering from high-pressure nervous syndrome that essentially turns him into one. Incidentally, The Abyss is finally hitting blu-ray and UHD this March! Paxton and Beihn ended up in another movie together, the western, Tombstone (1993), but I can’t recall if they ever shared any scenes.\n\nIn 1988 William Hope startled me by being in the horror cult classic, Hellbound: Hellraiser II. In Aliens he has a shaved head and displays a very military personality. In Hellbound he has a full head of hair, plays Dr. Kyle MacRae, and is very congenial. The only other movie I ever came across him in is the giant spider flick, Spiders 3D (2011), where he goes back to playing a hard ass military type by the name of Colonel Jenkins; he ends up getting killed in both Hellbound and Spiders 3D, and now that I think about it in Aliens too.\n\nCameron used Sigourney Weaver and Jenette Goldstein again, Weaver had a significant supporting role in Avatar (2009) and she reprises her role in Avatar: Way Of Water (2022) and Goldstein was young John Connor’s stepmother, Janelle Voight, in the Terminator sequel, Terminator 2: Judgment Day (1991).\n\nThe most extraordinary thing about three of these actors is that right after Aliens they starred in another movie together, the cult classic and more unique vampire movie of the late 80s, Near Dark (1987) — Henriksen, Paxton and Goldstein play a “family” of nomadic vampires that scour the Midwest delving our random, bloody carnage wherever they see fit.\n\nIn my book the success of Aliens gave Henriksen and Paxton a very fruitful movie careers. I had seen Henriksen in movies before Aliens, but never made the connection until much later in life, and despite Paxton being very memorable as Chet in Weird Science (1985) I didn’t make that connection he was the same actor in Aliens until much later in life. Aliens hit theaters when I was seventeen and I saw it an unfathomable number of times that summer, so much so I can pen this review without needing to revisit it and refresh my memory. One of a few movies I know like the back of my hand; Predator (1987) being another. Even though I love both of their characters in Aliens, it was Near Dark that really made me a fan of Henriksen and Paxton, since their characters are 180-degrees from who they portrayed in Cameron’s flick it blatantly high-lighted their acting ranges, which just impressed me. In fact Henriksen did three movies in a row I became a fan of after Aliens, and each ended up being a cult horror classic in their own right: Near Dark, Pumpkinhead (1988) and The Horror Show (1989). Then seven years later he took the memorable lead role in Chris Carter’s Millennium (1996-1999), playing serial killer profiler Frank Black. He also wrote his autobiography, Not Bad For A Human, (a line his character utters in Aliens) back in 2011. Unfortunately, it’s now out of print, and I still haven’t read it.\n\nBeihn’s character is very understated and in the background as Aliens begins, with Paxton’s Hudson being a very memorable foreground force as he’s the typical braggadocios military-type (the braggadocios is seriously on display in the director’s cut as he brags to Ripley on the dropship down to LV-426 how badass the Colonial Marines are), and then turns very cowardly once the aliens trim the unit of most of the characters, with only four members left to figure shit out and survive. But he has a very memorable redeeming moment before he dies. His character is still 99% fun to watch, as they all are. Vasquez stands out as she’s a very muscular badass chick. There are three chicks on the team, but she’s the one that stands out, big time. Biehn’s character doesn’t take shape until their Sergeant, Apone (Al Matthews), bites the dust in their first encounter, and being the next in line of command, he’s required to step up. There’s a very slight, and I mean ever so slight, romantic connection between Ripley and him.\n\nThere’s are three civilians in the cast, though I’m not sure how “civilian” you could call Bishop, since all Marine missions are required to have an android on board, but he doesn’t suit up for combat like the others, and is mostly the “scientist” of the unit, trying to study the aliens the best he can as they all fight to survive second by second. Carter J. Burke, played by Paul Reiser, is a Weyland-Yutani rep that goes along on the mission, and starts out as a fairly decent guy, until we learn he’s the corporate douchbag that just wants the aliens for the weapons division. Android Ash played this role in Alien, but Cameron separated it in Aliens, thus making Bishop the good android, and giving the “corporate evil” to an actual separate character. He turns out to be just as cowardly at times as Hudson, but with Burke there is no redeeming moment, and he even ends up trying to get Ripley and Newt impregnated so he can smuggle some form of the alien back to earth. Newt is the third and final civilian, a little girl whose family was wiped out by the aliens and pretty much the only survivor of the human colony of LV-426. Her character gets more screen time in the director’s cut as it was her and her family that was sent out to find that ship, and who’s father came back with a facehugger wrapped around his head. Cameron sets up a new family for Ripley, with Biehn as surrogate father, and Newt as a surrogate daughter to protect at all costs. Ripley, Newt, Hicks and Bishop are the only survivors, with only Rip and Newt physically unscathed, as Hicks was severely sidelined by the alien’s molecular acid blood and Bishop was, well, ripped in half by the Queen Alien in the movie’s final battle sequence. His upper half managed to still function and turn hero and save Newt from getting sucked out into space, showing us not all androids are defective killers. Androids appear in all four Alien movies.\n\nCameron gives us a chestbursting scene, though one that isn’t remotely as disturbing as the one Scott gave us in Alien, and we get a facehugger, actually more facehugger action—ever wonder if you could handle a facehugger attack, and I’m not talking about one that pops out of an egg right onto your face, but one where two facehuggers are scurrying about in a room you’re trapped in? Ripley finds out facehuggers scurry about like spiders and they’re pretty damn strong when they latch onto you. Cameron also gives us more general alien action, a lot more! The late FX artist Stan Winston was tasked with bringing H.R. Giger’s designs to life for the sequel, and while I’m a big fan of Winston I wasn’t an overall fan of his re-design of the chestburster or the adult aliens. In fact out of all the Alien movies Giger’s designs in the original, for all three stages the xenomorph goes through, are my favorites. Having said that I do like Winston’s facehuggers a tad more, probably because we see them in a different kind of action than how they were presented in Alien. The adult aliens in Cameron’s film are faster and more agile, and don’t have that transparent plate over their hammer-shaped domes, Winston decided to remove it. His original Queen Alien design is also fantastic!\n\nAny good sequel has to give us some familiar elements from the first film, while expanding on it mythos, and the new stuff Cameron gives us is how these xenormorphs live when there’s more than one of them, and they live much like social insects do on earth, in a colony, with a queen that lays eggs and begins that dreaded and horrific three stage cycle they go through, and controls their every action. This queen is huge and one of the more impressive new designs Winston created for the Alien mythos, and Ripley goes toe-to-toe with it in a final battle on board the U.S.S. Suloco, a battle where things are evened out by her using a cargo loader as a weapon. It’s a type of exosuit that’s basically a futuristic forklift, and again Cameron repeats the ending of Alien where Ripley wins by jettisoning the thing into space, and, again, Ripley goes back into hypersleep, after putting wounded Hicks, destroyed Bishop, and Newt into their chambers first. Another copying of Alien, just with more characters, which was fine with me. At least this time she didn’t end up the lone survivor.\n\nI would be remiss if I didn’t acknowledge the contribution Sigourney Weaver’s performance has made in breaking a glass ceiling for strong women characters who kick ass, figuratively and literally, in the intervening decades. Even though she did the same thing in Alien, it’s this action movie sequel here that I believe most filmmakers looked to for inspiration for creating strong female leads in action and/or action/horror/scifi hybrids.\n\nThis was one of the big summer movies of 1986, Top Gun came out this summer too, and by fall they would tally up the money and make a list of which was the biggest summer hit, and I naturally expected it to be Aliens. It turned out to be Top Gun. I was actually incensed by that, and shocked audiences chose this “Tom Cruise jet movie” over Aliens. Leading up to the premiere of the movie you could buy the novelization and two movie magazines, both of which I’m still in possession of to this day. Rather perfect timing in doing this review since there’s a book coming out in August called the Alien Film Franchise Encyclopedia, which appears to be the end all and be all of info you’ll ever need about this universe! Cameron’s director’s cut, I think, debuted on laserdisc long before it hit DVD. VHS only had the theatrical cut, and I prefer the director’s cut of this film.\n\n20th Century Fox has released and re-released Aliens (1986) many times on disc, the version I’m reviewing is part of the 2014 Alien: Quadrilogy set of all four films. To date this has yet to hit UHD, in fact Alien (1979) is the only entry that’s available on UHD at the moment. You can buy the Alien UHD here and the Quadrilogy set here on Amazon! I’ve heard rumors for a year or two now Fox/Disney will be putting out a UHD set of all of them.\n\nVIDEO/AUDIO/SUBTITLES: 1080p 1.85:1 High Definition Widescreen—5.1 English DTS-HD Master Audio, 4.1 English Dolby Digital, 2.0 English Dolby Digital, 5.1 Portuguese Dolby Digital, 5.1 French DTS, 5.1 German DTS, 5.1 Spanish Dolby Digital—English SDH, French, German, Portuguese, Spanish, Danish, Dutch, Finnish, Norwegian, Swedish subs\n\nEXTRAS INCLUDED . . .\n\nDISC #2:\n\n1986 Theatrical Cut (runtime: 2:17:14)\n\n1990 Special Edition (runtime: 2:34:26)\n\n2003 Audio Commentary With James Cameron And The Cast And Crew\n\nFinal Theatrical Isolated Score (1986 Theatrical Version Only)\n\nComposer’s Original Isolated Score (1986 Theatrical Version Only)\n\nDeleted Scenes (19:57)\n\nDelete Scene Footage Marker (1990 Special Edition Only)\n\n(NOTE: This particular set doesn’t come with a ton of extras, it’s more of a budget set, and it’s been re-released three times.
