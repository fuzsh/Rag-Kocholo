        "text": "Well, for today, I thought that I’d talk about why 1980s horror movies absolutely rule 🙂 This was something I ended up thinking about last Halloween when I finally got round to watching Brendan Faulkner (et al)’s 1986 film “Spookies” and Claudio Fragasso’s 1989 film “Zombie Flesh Eaters 3” (A.K.A “After Death”).\n\nI should probably also add a warning that both films contain FLASHING/FLICKERING lights.\n\nOn a side-note: The second-hand UK DVD editions of both films I watched were from the now-defunct “Vipco’s Screamtime Collection”. This collection was a series of re-issues of old “video nasties”, and other obscure 1970s-80s horror movies, which followed the slight relaxation of horror film censorship in late 1990s Britain. Not only was it cool that these films got a bit of a revival in early-mid 2000s Britain, but this is the sort of thing which could only happen in the days of physical media as well. Seriously, I used to see these DVDs – with their distinctive dark cases – in the shops all the time back then… but, alas, I didn’t look old enough to buy them at the time…\n\nAnyway, both of these films reminded me why 1980s horror films are so cool. Both of them are low-budget monster movies – with paranormal elements – and slightly chaotic stories.\n\n“Spookies” (1986) focuses on a Dracula-like sorcerer who uses a small army of monsters to harvest the souls of the living in order to resurrect his bride. Of course, the entire film takes place in and/or around a creepy mansion. And it’s almost more of a cynical comedy-horror film than a “serious” horror film most of the time.\n\n“Zombie Flesh Eaters 3” (1989) is a zombie movie which takes place on a remote tropical island. Whilst the zombies are technically traditional Voodoo zombies, they act more like “virus” zombies due to a technicality (eg: their bites are always fatal, and people on the cursed island resurrect as zombies…).\n\nAnyway, this film is almost more of an ultra-gruesome action movie than a horror movie – with several of the main characters being Vietnam war veterans who now work as mercenaries.\n\nOne thing you’ll notice immediately is that both films are almost films from another genre. Don’t ask me why, but this adds something to the films. The pairing of a “depressing” genre like horror with a “feel-good” genre like comedy or action lends these films a unique atmosphere which is just pure FUN.\n\nLikewise, another reason why 1980s horror movies absolutely rule is the “chaotic” storytelling I mentioned earlier. Modern horror films are often a lot more intense and genuinely frightening because they take themselves a bit more seriously and are a lot more focused and consistent. Yes, this makes them “better” in some ways but there’s a lot to be said for the gleeful unpredictability and FUN of many older 1980s horror films. Another great example is Lamberto Bava’s 1985 punk zombie film “Demons” – which almost seems more like an episode of the classic BBC sitcom “The Young Ones” (1982-84) at times, albeit with loads more slime and stage blood.\n\nBecause 1980s horror films often took themselves less seriously in terms of storytelling, because there was more of an emphasis on “Because it’s cool” or “Because it’s scary”, they’re just more entertaining than serious modern horror films. They can make you laugh out loud as often as they make you gasp or scream. Or, put another way, the fear doesn’t usually linger for very long after you’ve finished watching. You can enjoy a scary movie, without worrying too much about the memory of it haunting you for the next couple of days. Plus, it just speaks to an age when people were a bit more optimistic as well.\n\nThere’s also the special effects as well. Because CGI wasn’t cheap or very advanced during the 1980s, these low-budget films pretty much exclusively use practical effects (and/or “painted animation” type effects). There’s a gloriously “rubbery” quality to things like monster costumes and gore effects in these older films that is quintessentially “retro” in a really fun way. Like the effects are “realistic” enough to be dramatic, but also just about “unrealistic” enough not to be too shocking or scary. Compared to more realistic modern effects, this adds a certain level of theatricality and melodrama to these older films which is just pure FUN.\n\nAs well as this, there’s also the lighting design as well. Yes, horror movies have often had cool or creative lighting throughout their history. But, in the 1980s, the sort of psychedelic lighting which was made famous by Dario Argento’s 1977 masterpiece “Suspiria” became a bit more popular. I’ve already written a whole article about “Dark Psychedelia“, but there’s just something about the contrast between psychedelic 1960s-type colours and ominous gloom which is absolutely perfect. Not only that, in keeping with the themes I’ve mentioned earlier, 1980s horror movies weren’t afraid to use more “unrealistic” lighting for dramatic effect either. And it looks amazingly cool.\n\nFinally, there’s just the general mood and atmosphere of 1980s horror movies. Whether it is the retro fashions and hairstyles, how the “pre-social media” locations feel a bit more remote or even some of the music they include – and Al Festa’s theme tune (warning- gruesome painting) for “Zombie Flesh Eaters 3” (1989) is cheesy 1980s hair metal/rock at it’s finest – these films have a very unique atmosphere which can only come from one decade.\n\nNot only is this inherently cool, but like all of the other stuff I’ve mentioned, it also adds a certain emotional distance and theatricality to these films when watched today. Yes, they’re less scary than “serious” modern horror movies, but this is sort of the point. They’re films you can watch when you’re in the mood for a horror movie but don’t want a sleepless night afterwards. Ones you can watch when you want to be entertained, rather than traumatised, by what you see on screen.\n\n—————-\n\nAnyway, I hope that this was interesting 🙂"
