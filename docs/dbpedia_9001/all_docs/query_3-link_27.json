        "text": "I was at an impressionable age when this popular boom hit the US market for horror/slasher movies. It was short-lived, only about 4 years, but left a huge impression and a great set of genre films.\n\nThe era was in a way bookended by \"Halloween\" in late 1978 and \"Halloween II\" in late 1981. Very appropriate if you ask me.\n\nWhat are some of your favorite movies of this period, and some of your favorite experiences as a theater-goer during this time?\n\nI would extend the golden age of horror from the release of the first Night of the Living Dead in 1968, to the 3rd installment of that series, Day of the Dead in 1985. In between those two films were all my favorite horror films, whether American or European.\n\nBut I agree with the OP that things kind of reached a fever pitch between about 1978 and 1982. In '78 came Dawn of the Dead, my favorite of the trilogy. Late 70s/early 80s is when all the best Fulci films came out...Zombi 2, City of the Living Dead, The Beyond, and New York Ripper. Argento had Suspiria, Inferno, and Tenebre. Cannibal films by Deodato and Umberto Lenzi. Slasher franchises like Halloween and Friday the 13th got their start. Some good Stephen King adaptations like The Shining, Salem's Lot and Cujo. One of my favorite sub-genres, what I call \"animals gone wild\" (Jaws, Piranha, Grizzly) was winding down by the end of the '70s, but we still got the underrated Prophecy.\n\nNot to mention Amityville Horror, Alien (a mix of horror and sci-fi), I Spit On Your Grave, and Cat People. The early '80s were also good for some anthology movies like Creepshow and Twilight Zone: The Movie. What's puzzling is why the quality of horror really seemed to go downhill after about 1985. This would have been when the home video market was really expanding.\n\nThis era coincided with my late teens/early 20's and I hold these films in high regard. They were at times cheap and tawdry but ultimately memorable. I LOVE LOVE LOVE this era of horror movies. Here is a list of some of my favorites:\n\nHalloween\n\nHalloween II\n\nHalloween III: Season Of The Witch (over the years this has grown in stature but it was ridiculed at the time, I for one LOVED it from the first!!)\n\nTerror Train\n\nMotel Hell\n\nMother's Day\n\nMy Bloody Valentine (the version with the restored scenes is a MUST see)\n\nHappy Birthday To Me\n\nApril Fools Day\n\nFriday The 13th\n\nFriday The 13th: Part II\n\nFriday The 13th: Part 3 in 3D (the 3D effects in the theater were GREAT!)\n\nThe Burning\n\nSleepaway Camp\n\nThe Boogeyman\n\nThe Fog\n\nSilent Night, Deadly Night\n\nProm Night\n\nAn American Werewolf In London\n\nEvil Dead\n\nThe Funhouse\n\nThe Howling\n\nCreepshow\n\nBasket Case\n\nThe Keep\n\nPsycho II\n\nThe Return Of The Living Dead\n\nScanners\n\nVideodrome.........I could list many more. I have most of these on DVD. It is possible I may have a sickness.\n\nGreat list. Only 2 movies I would remove if it were my list: Mother's Day\" and \"Sleepaway Camp.\" I vehemently detest those two movies in fact. \"The Keep\" is the only one I've never seen. I'll have to check it out.\n\nThree things/people are a huge focus for me.\n\n1) The Video Nasties. For a brief window we got to see all kinds of gore and horrors, much to the chagrin of puritanical, political, forces.\n\n2) Argento & Fulci. Both made amazing films, both made really bad films. Both were amazing. When I saw Tenebrae for the first time, I knew I would love Argento forever. Fulci's The Beyond is incredible. Their filmographies just rule.\n\n3) Cronenberg. This was his era. Videodrome is a stunning piece of work, but the reality is he was firing on all cylinders at this time.\n\nPS: \"The Keep\" was THE Nazi Horror movie. Sounds cheesy I know but it worked. I found this movie pretty spooky for its time.\n\nrecently I revisited a few more obscure movies from that time, horror and slasher, these are pretty enjoyable\n\nBurnt Offerings (1976)\n\nThe Legacy (1978)\n\nNight School (1981)\n\nGhost Story (1981)\n\nDead & Buried (1981)\n\nThe Funhouse (1981)\n\nHappy Birthday to Me (1981)\n\nChristmas Evil (1981)\n\nI also watched The Swamp Thing (1982).... somehow I remember it being scary watching it as a kid, but now it's more of a science fiction mixed with love story. I still liked Adrienne Barbeau in it. And of course I went that extra step and re-watched the cheesy sequel with Heather Locklear, it's bad but good. Swamp Thing needs a remake\n\nI'm too young to have seen the films of this era in a theater at the time, but I did watch many of them on cable television as a kid (often multiple times). I have seen some of them in recent years in a theater, thanks to the Alamo Drafthouse's wonderful Terror Tuesdays series. My favorite experience there was a screening of My Bloody Valentine with a surprise q&a session with director George Mihalka afterward (he acknowledged the band that named themselves after the movie, which was fun - I'm a huge fan of both film and group).\n\nI'll add a few favorites that haven't been mentioned already:\n\nThe House on Sorority Row (great score by Richard Band and the London Symphony Orchestra, as well)\n\nJust Before Dawn\n\nFull Circle (aka The Haunting of Julia)\n\nWhen a Stranger Calls\n\nAmityville II: The Possession (I don't care much for the first film, but this sequel is very disturbing and creepy for many reasons)\n\nEaten Alive (Tobe Hooper's film between The Texas Chainsaw Massacre and Salem's Lot for television)\n\nDon't Go in the House\n\nThe Prowler\n\nThe Hunger\n\nOne Dark Night\n\nOf the ones already mentioned, Halloween, The Funhouse, Inferno, Suspiria, The Beyond, The Howling, Rabid, The Fog and The Evil Dead are favorites of mine.\n\nFrom 1978 - 1981 you have so many to choose, although 1978 was kind of a light year, other than Halloween and Dawn of the Dead. In 1981 alone there was around 18 slasher movies, not to mention 2 of the best werewolf movies amongst other classics. Easily my favorite year for horror.\n\nPiranha\n\nPhantasm\n\nWhen a Stranger Calls\n\nAlien\n\nTerror Train\n\nTourist Trap\n\nZombi 2\n\nSilent Scream\n\nThe Changeling\n\nAlligator\n\nChristmas Evil\n\nFuneral Home\n\nMotel Hell\n\nInferno\n\nThe Fog\n\nEvil Dead\n\nDark Night of the Scarecrow\n\nThe Howling\n\nAn American Werewolf in London\n\nHappy Birthday to Me\n\nThe Funhouse\n\nHell Night\n\nMy Bloody Valentine"
