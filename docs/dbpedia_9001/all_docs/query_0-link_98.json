Living in Central Indiana, I was able to see these wonderful movies on WISH-TV, Channel 8, when they were presented by the hugely popular horror host, Selwin. From 1958 to 1961 the classic movie monsters were seen each Friday night until Selwin began showing Tarzan and Bomba movies on an afternoon show called Selwin on Saturday. In the spring of 1962 he was back on late Fridays wearing a silver spacesuit purchased from the Captain Company and presenting a new ﬂock of scary movies, this time from Allied Artists. It was evident these more modern fright fest offerings were of a different (lesser) breed than the monster movies of yore, but they had a lure of their own. Many a baby boomer got hooked on horror movies watching these Allied releases and after nearly a half century they retain a place in the hearts of genre followers. From 1952 to 1978 Allied Artists Pictures Corporation released over 80 feature ﬁlms in the horror, science ﬁction and fantasy ﬁlm categories. Like most of the studios’ product, they were mainly average outings but there were some top-notch productions like House on Haunted Hill, Invasion of the Body Snatchers, Macabre, The Maze, Not of This Earth and World Without End. At the other end of the spectrum, the company was responsible for the release of movies like The Bride and the Beast, The Disembodied, Frankenstein Meets the Space Monster, From Hell It Came and Mission Mars. Somewhere in the middle come such favorites as Attack of the 50 Foot Woman, The Atomic Submarine, The Bat, Black Zoo, Daughter of Dr. Jekyll, The Giant Behemoth, Queen of Outer Space and The Strangler. For traditionalists there is John Carradine in The Cosmic Man, Lon Chaney in Indestructible Man and The Cyclops and Boris Karloff in Frankenstein 1970 and The Sorcerers. One of the studio’s most popular series was “The Bowery Boys” and several of their entries involved horror, sci-ﬁ or fantasy. Allied also imported the genre features Blood and Black Lace, Caltiki the Immortal Monster, Crow Hollow, Island of the Doomed, The Magic Weaver and Moonwolf. There were even some sex horror imports, including Blood Rose and Eugenie. Allied Artists’ history goes back to the silent days when W. Ray Johnston started Rayart Productions in 1924; it became Syndicate Film Exchange in 1928. With the coming of sound there were a few releases under the banners Continental Talking Pictures and Raytone, and then in 1931 the company became Monogram Pictures. In 1935 Johnston and Trem Carr, who was in charge of production, merged Monogram with several other studios (Mascot, Majestic, Liberty) and Consolidated Film Industries to form Republic Pictures Corporation. In 1937 Johnston re-started Monogram and the company returned to motion picture production. Among its product was some horror movies, including some with Bela Lugosi in the 1940s. In 1946 Johnston became chairman of the studio’s board and general sales manager Steve Broidy succeeded him as Monogram’s president. Since Monogram was associated with 1\n\n2\n\nPreface\n\nprogram pictures, Broidy formed Allied Artists Productions in 1946 to make prestige productions. By 1953, Allied Artists Pictures Corporation completely phased out Monogram. For the next 13 years Allied Artists continued to make and/or distribute a variety of ﬁlms, including the big-budget items Friendly Persuasion (1956), Love in the Afternoon (1957), The Big Circus (1959) and 55 Days at Peking (1963). Two of the studio’s biggest moneymakers were producer-director William Castle’s initial “gimmick” productions Macabre (1958) and House on Haunted Hill (1959). In 1965 Broidy left Allied Artists and was succeeded by Claude A. Giroux. The company went into television and quit making ﬁlms in 1966. Two years later, Emanuel L. Wolf took over the company and for the next several years Allied mainly released imports before resuming ﬁlm production with the big-budget affairs Cabaret (1972), Papillon (1973), The Man Who Would Be King (1975) and The Betsy (1978). With dwindling revenue, Allied Artists joined Kalvex, Inc./PSP, Inc., to form Allied Artists Industries in 1976 but declared bankruptcy three years later. In 1980 Lorimar Productions purchased the company’s ﬁlm library; Time Warner bought Lorimar in 1988. Today most of the Allied Artists ﬁlm library is under the control of Warner Bros. Entertainment, Inc. Allied was one of the ﬁrst to go into TV distribution with its Interstate Television Corporation, a subsidiary that released most of the old Monogram product to television stations. As Allied Artists Television Corporation, the studio had nearly 400 feature ﬁlms available to television stations in 14 different packages, plus an additional 135 Monogram westerns in ﬁve more packages, in the mid–1970s. Twenty-two of these movies, although released theatrically by other companies, are discussed in this volume since it was Allied that made them available to the small screen. In one case, Hand of Power, this proved to be the movie’s ﬁrst U.S. showing. Also included in the text is Allied’s 1963 double-bill reissue of the Jack H. Harris productions The Blob and Dinosaurus! In the summer of 1978, the studio formed Allied Artists Video Corporation, a subsidiary that planned to release some 500 titles on video. Thus Allied became the ﬁrst major studio distributor to tap the VCR market. It released over 100 titles in both the Beta and VHS formats before being shuttered by Lorimar in the fall of 1980. This volume takes a look at the genre ﬁlms of Allied Artists between 1952 and 1978, along with the already noted TV releases and the two 1963 reissues. I have tried to give balanced coverage of these ﬁlms, including both personal and critics’ comments as well as detailed plot synopsis, casts and credits. Films are in black and white unless otherwise noted. I have a special fondness for the Allied product, especially those from the 1950s into the mid–1960s, and I hope this work will encourage others to take a look at these entertaining movies. Thanks to the video market, most of them are available for viewing. Some sources list Queen of Spades, a 1948 British ﬁlm, as a 1950 Allied release but it was issued under the Monogram banner in the U.S. Another alleged Allied release is the 1976 West German production Superbug, but it was issued stateside by Scorpio International and Central Park Films. Included in the TV section is the 1962 ﬁlm This Is Not a Test which at least one source claims to be an Allied release but its only theatrical showings seem to have been through Modern Films. I would like to thank Len D. Martin, Gary Kramer, Ray White and James Robert Parish for their help with this book. While Allied Artists was not in the top echelon, the studio kept up a steady program of popular low-budget movies and many of their horror, science ﬁction and fantasy ﬁlms have more than stood the test of time. Most important, they continue to entertain. I hope you enjoy reading about them.\n\nFeature Films The Atomic Man (1956; 78 minutes) Producer: Alec C. Snowden. Director: Ken Hughes.

With his girlfriend, news photographer Jill Rabowski (Faith Domergue), Mike comes to believe the man is Dr. Stephen Rayner (Peter Arne) of the Brandt Nuclear Research Institute. A world-renowned physicist, Rayner is known as the Isotope Man because of his work with atomic energy. Mike and Jill go to the hospital where the man is pronounced dead following an operation to remove a bullet from his back. The operation was performed by Dr. Preston (Martin Wyldeck). After a shot of adrenalin, the patient revives. Mike shows his picture to the doctor and Inspector Cleary ( Joseph Tomelty) and both agree there is a resemblance to the scientist. A check at the institute by Sergeant Haines (Leonard Williams) proves that Rayner is there. At the hospital, Jill takes a picture of the revived man. The next day Mike goes to visit his old friend Robert Maitland (Donald Gray), Brandt’s director. He also meets Rayner, who shows no interest in the photograph of the man in the hospital and mentions that he is working on a project that could have worldwide effects. Mike’s editor (Launce Maraschal) orders him to quit the Rayner case and stick to scientiﬁc writing. After noticing that all the photos of the revived man have the same foggy glow, Mike goes back to see Maitland, who says the effect might be caused by static electricity. Since the man in the hospital complains of headaches and has a high fever, Dr. Preston orders an x-ray be taken but there is a malfunction due to radioactivity in the room. Mike and Preston talk to the revived man but he only rambles and mentions “Vasquo” and UTC. Mike and Jill go to Rayner’s residence where she takes his photograph. As they leave, Mike is intrigued to see a hat with the initials EV which came from Buenos Aires. Rayner, whose real name is Jarvis, meets with Dr. 3\n\n4\n\nFeature Films\n\nBressler (Paul Hardmuth), the plastic surgeon who made him look like Rayner. Jarvis tells his employer, Argentine businessman Emmanuel Vasquo (Vic Perry), that a test of the new formula will result in an explosion that will destroy the institute and its inhabitants. Jill reveals that the man pretending to be Rayner is a fake because the photo she took of him has no glow. Mike is ﬁred by his editor for working on the Rayner case and not the assignment given to him. Mike gets permission from Dr. Preston to question the man in the hospital but his responses make no sense until Jill transcribes them to show that he answers questions before they are asked. Preston tells them that the man’s heart stopped for seven or eight seconds before he was revived. They learn the wounded man had been abducted by Vasquo’s operatives. Mike deduces that Rayner developed a formula for synthetic tungsten and Vasquo wants it destroyed since his company, United Tungsten Corporation (or UTC), controls two-thirds of the world’s supply of that mineral. Jarvis goes to the institute and plants a plutonium bomb in the nuclear reactor but is distressed to learn that the scheduled test will be delayed several hours. That night someone shoots at Mike in front of his apartment building. When Jill goes there the next morning, she ﬁnds him with Inspector Haines, who is questioning him about the attack. Delaney goes with Haines to see Inspector Cleary and there he meets Dr. Marks (Carl Jaffe), a psychoanalyst who says that when Rayner’s heart stopped, his brain continued to function and when revived his consciousness was 7.5 seconds ahead of his physical self. He theorizes that this happened due to the scientist’s long involvement with radioactivity. Jill borrows an ice pick from a barman (Brian O’Higgins) and breaks into the Argentine’s UTC ofﬁce. Vasquo learns from an informant (Vanda Godsell) at the hospital that Rayner has been given an antidote that has brought him back to real time and that he recalls his kidnapping. Vasquo orders Bressler to kill Rayner but the surgeon cannot make himself commit the crime. Bressler leaves behind a syringe ﬁlled with poison. Mike, Cleary and Dr. Marks go to see Rayner and when they pass Bressler in the hall, Marks recognizes him. Mike ﬁnds out that Bressler tried to get rid of Rayner and tells Cleary. A police dragnet is launched for Vasquo and the fake Rayner as the plastic surgeon is brought in on a stretcher after having committed suicide by jumping in front of a car. Jill calls Mike to tell him she found photographs of Rayner in Vasquo’s ofﬁce but the crook and his henchman (Dervis Ward) show up. Arriving at the Argentine’s ofﬁce, Mike ﬁnds it empty but answers the telephone and is told to go to Duggan’s Wharf, where a boat is waiting. There he discovers Jill is a prisoner at a warehouse. During a shootout, Vasquo is accidentally killed by his henchman, who is then shot by Delaney. Jill informs Mike that Vasquo planned to blow up the institute and they take Jarvis to the site just in time to have Maitland halt the test. Cleary shows them the plutonium bomb found there by his men. Mike and Jill decide to carry out their own experiments in romance. The sci-ﬁ element of The Atomic Man deals with Rayner’s mind jumping 7.5 seconds into the future following the stoppage of his heart for that length of time. Outside of the sequence of his answering questions before they are asked and the use of a tape recorder to match his answers with previously asked queries, the feature is basically an anemic espionage thriller, slow-moving and methodical. Produced in England at Merton Park Studios, it was issued in that country in 1955 by Anglo-Amalgamated Film Distributors as Timeslip with a 93-minute running time. When Allied Artists released it in the U.S. as The Atomic Man in March 1956, it was cut by thirteen minutes. In some stateside venues it was double-billed with Invasion of the Body Snatchers (q.v.). David Quinlan reported in British Sound Films: The Studio Years 1928 –1959 (1984), “For [the] unlikely plot to succeed, [the] ﬁlm has to be fast and exciting: it is.” Donald C.\n\nThe Atomic Submarine\n\n5\n\nWillis in Horror and Science Fiction Films: A Checklist (1972) opined, “No story to go with the intriguing central gimmick.” Ed Naha agreed in Horrors: From Screen to Scream (1975) when he wrote, “[T]his production presents an interesting premise that doesn’t get a full plot treatment.” VideoHound’s Sci-Fi Experience (1997) noted, “Preposterous but intriguing idea is wasted in this dull, talky British feature.” The same year The Atomic Man debuted in its homeland as Timeslip, Faith Domergue also starred in It Came from Beneath the Sea, Cult of the Cobra and This Island Earth. Her later genre efforts were Voyage to the Prehistoric Planet (1965), Legacy of Blood and The House of Seven Corpses (both 1972). Best known as a movie dancer, top-billed Gene Nelson turned to directing and helmed Hand of Death (1962). Director Ken Hughes also directed The Brain Machine (1954), a segment of Casino Royale (1967), the fantasy Chitty Chitty Bang Bang (1968) and the slasher thriller Night School (1981). The feature’s production manager, Jim O’Connolly, went on to write the well-liked sci-ﬁer The Night Caller (1965), released stateside as Blood Beast from Outer Space; he directed the topnotch Joan Crawford thriller Berserk! (1967) and the entertaining The Valley of Gwangi (1968), as well as serving as producerdirector on Horror on Snape Island (1971), also known as Tower of Evil and Beyond the Fog.\n\nThe Atomic Submarine (1959; 72 minutes) Producers: Alex Gordon and Henry Schrage.

After working as one of\n\nDick Foran, Arthur Franz and Paul Dubov in The Atomic Submarine (1959)\n\n6\n\nFeature Films\n\nthe founding producers of American International Pictures, Gordon came to Allied Artists with The Atomic Submarine, which the studio released late in 1959. True to form, it was loaded with veteran players: Dick Foran, Tom Conway, Bob Steele, Victor Varconi, Jack Mulhall, Selmer Jackson, Edmund Cobb and Frank Lackteen. In fact, the familiar faces were the highlight of this science ﬁction effort that offered Electro-Sonic music, grainy stock footage and rather unconvincing miniatures. The alien creature in the feature is an H.P. Lovecraft–like monstrosity, a dark squid-type creature with tentacles and a huge eye. The production moves at a fairly steady clip and, while obviously made on a low budget, it probably did not disappoint viewers upon its initial release. The depths of the Arctic Circle corridor are closed by the military after ships and submarines are blown up by an unknown force. After the atomic submarine Sturgeon is destroyed, a meeting is called at the Pentagon by Bureau of Arctic Defense head Admiral Terhune (Selmer Jackson). There he introduces Dan Wendover (Foran), commander of the atomic submarine Tiger Shark, to Secretary of Defense Justin Murdock (Mulhall), Nobel Prize–winning scientist Sir Ian Hunt (Conway) and his colleague Dr. Clifford Kent (Varconi). Wendover is told that his sub will be equipped with ultra-modern tracking devices, warheads and the Lung Fish, a diving bell. His mission is to ﬁnd and stop whatever is destroying the seagoing craft. Lieutenant Commander Richard “Reef ” Holloway (Franz), Wendover’s executive ofﬁcer, is on shore leave making love to beautiful blonde Julie (Lansing) but is interrupted by a telegram telling him to immediately report for duty. At the Bremerton Navy Yard he ﬁnds Chief Petty Ofﬁcer “Griff ” Grifﬁn (Steele) screening the men who are returning to the vessel. On board he is upset to ﬁnd that he is bunking with Dr. Carl Neilson, Jr. (Brett Halsey), the son of his mentor. He dislikes the young scientist, who developed the Lung Fish with his father, because Carl’s paciﬁstic views caused the elder Neilson to resign his Navy commission and concentrate on scientiﬁc work. Also on board the submarine are Hunt, Kent and two frogmen, Carney (Richard Tyler) and Powell (Ken Becker). The submarine heads under the North Pole. Carl gets a telegram saying his father has sufﬁciently recovered from a heart attack to join the mission but the young man refuses to sacriﬁce his dad’s health and announces he will carry on in his place, much to Reef ’s chagrin. As the two men are arguing, the craft is hit by a freak electrical storm and a strange craft is seen speeding away. Hunt draws a picture of the mystery vessel and Kent announces that it looks similar to a photograph he has of a ﬂying saucer. Since the alien ship was topped with a light that looked like an eye, Hunt begins referring to it as the Cyclops. As reports come in of further attacks on U.S. vessels, Hunt theorizes that the craft operates on a magnetic ﬁeld and it has to return to the North Pole to be re-energized. Wendover conceives a plan to have the Tiger Shark wait at a point where the saucer may next strike and then attack it with nuclear warheads. With the submarine on silent running, the men wait for the UFO to appear. When it does, the commander orders the warheads ﬁred. One warhead misses the Arthur Franz in The Atomic Submarine (1959)\n\nAttack of the Crab Monsters\n\n7\n\ncraft and the other is stopped by a jelly-like substance emitted by the ﬂying saucer. Over Carl’s objections, Wendover orders the sub to ram the UFO. In doing so, it pierces and becomes locked into the craft. Both the ﬂying saucer and the sub then sink to a depth of 1,200 feet. Reef suggests the Lung Fish be used to transport him, Lieutenant Milburn (Paul Dubov) and the frogmen to the craft; once inside they might be able to dislodge the sub with blowtorches. Carl pilots the four men to the UFO. Reef, Milburn and the frogmen enter the alien ship through a portal and ﬁnd that it contains oxygen. As they work to free the submarine, it is noted that radiation levels are rising. Hunt theorizes that the spaceship is returning to “life” and moving toward the Pole. Reef hears a voice calling to him and he and Milburn follow it. Frogman Powell is burned to death by a ray, and in trying to get back to the diving bell Carney is crushed by the closing door of the portal. Reef is told to come alone to an opening and there he sees a giant one-eyed monster with tentacles that communicates with him through thought waves. The alien says it is exploring various worlds for possible habitation. When Milburn tries to shoot the being, it kills him with a death ray. Reef is told that he will return with the alien, along with other specimens, for study. Reef shoots out the monster’s eye and runs back to the diving bell. He tells Wendover to pull the Tiger Shark out of the saucer and he and Carl return to the submarine in the Lung Fish. As the ﬂying saucer speeds back to the North Pole, Reef warns that the world is doomed if the alien is allowed to escape. Their one hope lies in converting the last warhead into a guided missile. After it is readied, the crew waits until the UFO breaks through the ice and rises into the sky. Wendover orders Griff to ﬁre the missile and it destroys the ﬂying saucer. Back at the navy yard, Reef and Carl agree they can work together to stop the aliens if they ever return. Filmed by Gorham Productions in the summer of 1959, The Atomic Submarine has had mixed reviews. Steven H. Scheuer in Movies on TV 1975 –76 Edition (1974) said it “leaves one cold.” In The Phantom of the Movies’ Videoscope (2000), Joe Kane wrote, “Aside from its nostalgia value, the pic generates genuine suspense….” Ed Naha in Horrors: From Screen to Scream (1975) noted, “A favorite of TV viewers, this delightfully inept ﬁlm is fascinating fun to behold…. Brings back fond memories of those great Saturday afternoon matinees.” Writing on more of a highbrow level, Welch Everman in Cult Science Fiction Films (1995) saw a deeper meaning to the production when he referred to it as “another threat-of-invasion movie from the ﬁfties, a period during which Americans expected a nuclear attack from the Soviet Union any day. Movies such as this one spoke directly to our nation’s most pressing fears.” In regards to the plot’s hawkish attitude toward alien invaders, he said that the feature demonstrates “there is no question that atomic submarines and nuclear weapons are good things, and the ending of the ﬁlm tells us that, as long as science and the military can resolve their differences and work together, everything will be ok — an idea that got harder and harder to swallow as the 1960s wore on.”\n\nAttack of the Crab Monsters (1957; 63 minutes) Producer-Director: Roger Corman. Associate Producer–Screenplay: Charles B. Grifﬁth. Photography: Floyd Crosby. Editor: Charles Gross. Music: Ronald Stein. Makeup: Curly Batson. Assistant Directors: Maurice Vaccarino and Lindsley Parsons, Jr. CAST: Richard Garland (Dale Drewer), Pamela Duncan (Martha Hunter), Russell Johnson (Hank Chapman), Leslie Bradley (Dr. Karl Weigand), Mel Welles ( Jules Deveroux), Richard H. Cutting (Dr. James Carson), Beach Dickerson (Ron Fellows), Tony Miller ( Jack Sommers), Ed Nelson (Ensign Quinlan), Maitland Stuart (Mac), Charles B. Grifﬁth (Tate), Robin Riley, Doug Roberts.\n\nThe setting is a small Paciﬁc Ocean atoll that had been the site of fallout from an\n\n8\n\nFeature Films\n\nH-bomb test. Navy Ensign Quinlan (Ed Nelson) brings a scientiﬁc team to the locale to study the effects of radiation and also try and ﬁnd their missing predecessors led by Dr. McLean. The head of the group is Dr. Karl Weigand (Leslie Bradley), a nuclear physicist, and joining him are biologists Dale Drewer (Richard Garland) and Martha Hunter (Pamela Duncan); electronics expert Hank Chapman (Russell Johnson); geologist James Carson (Richard H. Cutting ); French botanist Jules Deveroux (Mel Welles); and two Navy demolition men, Ron Fellows (Beach Dickerson) and Jack Sommers (Tony Miller). Deveroux notices the lack of insect noises and jokingly says they may soon hear the voices of the ghosts of McLean and his crew. A seaman falls from a boat while unloading supplies and while he is underwater his head is severed from his body. While getting settled in the house on the atoll, the group is subjected to an earthquake followed by an avalanche. Later they watch as Quinlan’s seaplane takes off ; it explodes and Quinlan and his men are killed. In the laboratory in the house, Hank is unable to make radio contact with the mainland due to a powerful storm. Weigand reads from a journal left by McLean which ends abruptly with a description of ﬁnding a portion of a giant worm. After another earthquake, Martha does some underwater exploring and is joined by Dale. When they return to land, Weigand and Carson take them to a deep pit which has just been formed. During the night, Martha hears a voice claiming to be McLean. When she investiPoster for Attack of the Crab Monsters (1957)\n\nAttack of the Crab Monsters\n\n9\n\ngates she is joined by Carson and the two go to the pit. Carson climbs down just as another tremor is felt and he falls while Martha passes out. The remaining men ﬁnd the young woman and hear Carson calling to them from the bottom of the pit saying he has a broken leg. As Dale takes Martha back to the house, the rest of the group go through a series of tunnels in hopes of locating Carson. Back at the house, Dale and Martha hear a strange noise and when Dale goes into the lab he is attacked by a large claw. When the other men cannot ﬁnd Carson, they return to the lab to see it wrecked, food taken and their radio destroyed. Going back to continue to search for Carson, the group is beset by another tremor and Deveroux’s right hand is severed by a falling rock. As Martha tends to Deveroux at the house, Fellows and Sommers play cards in their tent and are attacked by an unseen (by the audience) monster. That night the voices of the two seamen call to Deveroux and he goes to the edge of the pit where he is killed by the claw. Awakened by the botanist’s screams, the others soon hear him talking to them only to ﬁnd his room is deserted. The next night, Deveroux calls out to the team and asks them to join him in the caves. Weigand, Dale and Hank go there only to be attacked by a giant crab. Bullets and hand grenades fail to stop the creature but it is killed when a huge stone falls on it. Weigand severs one of the beast’s claws. As the trio is about to leave, they are attacked by a second huge crab which Dale delays with a grenade. After examining the severed claw, Weigand concludes that the giants have been created by radiation poisoning; after devouring the brains of their victims, they take on their intelligence and are able to project thoughts in the dead men’s voices. He also states the remaining giant crab is slowly sinking parts of the island by emitting an arc of heat. Martha examines a photo of the surviving crab and it says it is about to give birth. Hank uses electricity to disintegrate the severed claw and Weigand orders him to set up a ray that they will use to kill the second crab. After Hank and Martha place electrical devices in the cave in order to kill the creature, they are chased by the monster but escape by swimming underwater. More landslides take place and the island continues to get smaller. Hank successfully rebuilds a new radio and Martha tells him that she and Dale are going to be married. Weigand and Dale, exploring what is left of the island, see an oil spill and take separate paths trying to ﬁnd its origin. The physicist goes into the cave where he is stunned by setting off the ray and is devoured by the monster. Seeing his demise, Dale, Martha and Hank go back to the lab. Deveroux’s voice tells them they will soon be absorbed and the giant crabs will continue to attack humans. As a huge earthquake nearly demolishes the atoll, the three survivors make it to a rock jutting into the ocean, where the radio tower still stands. When they fail to stop the beast with their remaining hand grenades, Hank rushes the creature and is injured. As Dale and Martha try to ﬁght off the giant crab, Hank climbs the radio tower and brings it down on the monster with both of them being electrocuted. Made on a $70,000 budget late in 1956 as Attack of the Giant Crabs, the feature was the ﬁrst made by producer-director Roger Corman that used market research to give a ﬁlm its title. Allied Artists released it on a double bill with Not of This Earth (q.v.) in February 1957 and the combo went on to gross over one million dollars at the box ofﬁce. Actor Ed Nelson, along with fellow performer Beach Dickerson and key grip Chuck Hanawalt, operated the crab monster that was made of Styrofoam and was moved by one of the men sequestered in the hollowed-out area behind its face. Running slightly over one hour, Attack of the Crab Monsters moved at a fast clip as most of the cast are devoured by the mutated creatures. The Hollywood Reporter called it “average” and noted that the ﬁlm “suffers from a\n\n10\n\nFeature Films\n\nlimited budget.” According to Variety, “It isn’t believable, but it’s fun….” Mark Thomas McGee in Roger Corman: The Best of the Cheap Acts (1988) noted, “There are moments when Crab Monsters takes on the characteristics of an old fashioned ghost story when the voices of the victims call to their friends.” In Sleaze Creatures (1995), D. Earl Worth compared the feature to another Corman production: “In many respects, Attack of the Crab Monsters was a carry over from Day the World Ended. Both began with heady anticipation of nuclear spectacle. Aftermaths of the explosions were commented on by similar celestial voices. The characters lived in isolated but comfortable homes. Most sections of their environments looked normal but felt strange. In various ways, the mutants were travesties of people.” Parts of the ﬁlm’s score appears on the compact disc Not of This Earth! The Film Music of Ronald Stein (Varese Sarabande VSD-5634), released in 1995. The CD has scores from seven of Stein’s ﬁlms including Not of This Earth and Attack of the 50 Foot Woman (1958) [q.v.].\n\nAttack of the 50 Foot Woman (1958; 65 minutes) Producer: Bernard Woolner. Executive Producer–Photography: Jacques Marquette. Director: Nathan Hertz [Juran]. Screenplay: Mark Hanna. Editor: Edward Mann. Music: Ronald Stein. Sound: Philip Mitchell. Makeup: Carlie Taylor. Props: Richard Rubin. Assistant Director: Ken Walters. CAST: Allison Hayes (Nancy Archer), William Hudson (Harry Archer), Yvette Vickers (Honey Parker), Roy Gordon (Dr. Cushing), George Douglas (Sheriff Dubbitt), Ken Terrell ( Jess Stout), Otto Waldis (Dr. Heinrich Von Loeb), Eileen Stevens (Nurse), Michael Ross (Bartender Tony/Giant Alien), Frank Chase (Deputy Sheriff Charlie), Thomas E. Jackson (Prospector), Dale Tate (TV Newsman).\n\nOne of the true joys of 1950s bad science ﬁction is Attack of the 50 Foot Woman, a ﬁlm so beloved by genre fans that it was remade in 1993 as a TV movie with Daryl Hannah. The update went in for a tongue-in-cheek approach and was nowhere near as entertaining as the original that played it straight, making it the far more amusing of the two. The 1958 version does have its share of comedy, mainly supplied by a bumbling deputy sheriff (Frank Chase), and the sorry-looking giant hand belonging to the title character and a space alien. Filmed as The Astounding Giant Woman, the Allied Artists release also sported shoddy special effects, especially in the long shots of the alien and giant woman. Much of the time the two titans are transparent. Best of all, the movie features two sexy leading ladies, Allison Hayes and Yvette Vickers, and both make the most of their scenes; the former Yvette Vickers and William Hudson in Attack of the 50 Foot as a drunk, neurotic heiress who is losing her husband to Woman (1958)\n\nAttack of the 50 Foot Woman\n\n11\n\nWilliam Hudson and Allison Hayes in Attack of the 50 Foot Woman (1958)\n\nthe latter. Vickers gives a classic portrayal of a cheap slut — the same type of character she played to perfection in another “attack” movie, Attack of the Giant Leeches (1959). Director Nathan Juran helmed Attack of the 50 Foot Woman using only his given and middle names, Nathan Hertz, apparently hoping to avoid association with such a cheap outing. (He did the same with 1958’s The Brain from Planet Arous [q.v.], a Howco International release that Allied Artists included in a 1970s TV package.) Scripter Mark Hanna also wrote Not of This Earth [q.v.], The Undead, The Amazing Colossal Man (all 1957) and Terror from the Year 5000 (1958). A television reporter (Dale Tate) relates sightings of a huge glowing sphere being seen in the skies near the Bering Sea, Egypt, South Africa and New Zealand, and he predicts the orb will soon be over Southern California. Beautiful Nancy Archer (Hayes), heiress to the $50 million Fowler fortune, is driving through the desert on her way home after arguing with her husband Harry (William Hudson) over his attentions to redhead Honey Parker (Vickers) while they were dining at Tony’s Bar. She is stopped by a large glowing object in the roadway. A bald giant (Mike Ross) emerges and tries to take the priceless Star of India diamond she is wearing. Back at the bar, Harry romances Honey who wants him to leave Nancy. He tells her he cannot afford to desert his rich wife. The distraught Nancy runs into town and demands to see Harry. Sheriff Dubbitt (George Douglas) tells his deputy Charlie (Chase) to fetch Harry, but Harry bribes the lawman to say he has gone home. Nearly hysterical, Nancy tells the skeptical law enforcers about her experience on the highway, and they go with her to search for the alien but only ﬁnd her abandoned car. Later that night, Nancy calls Harry a gigolo and a miserable parasite but confesses she still loves him. Harry\n\n12\n\nFeature Films\n\ntells her to get some rest and gives her sleeping pills and then returns to the bar to see Honey. There he informs his young mistress he will try to get his wife returned to the sanitarium where she once was committed for emotional problems. In doing so he will be able to get control of her estate. To convince Honey of his intentions, he shows her the Star of India diamond. Harry calls in Nancy’s physician Dr. Cushing (Roy Gordon); Harry is disappointed when the medical man refuses to re-commit Nancy. Nancy again confronts Harry about his relationship with Honey and accuses him of wanting to put her back in the sanitarium. While watching television she hears a news report about her supposedly seeing a ﬂying saucer and in anger she smashes the TV screen. She then tells Harry he will go with her into the desert to search for the UFO; she takes along a pistol belonging to her loyal butler, Jess (Ken Terrell), who does not like Harry. After driving most of the day, Nancy sees the ﬂying saucer at twilight. When they approach the orb, the giant comes out. Harry shoots at it and drives away, leaving the screaming Nancy behind. Harry goes back home and starts to pack. When Jess wants to know what happened to Nancy, the two men ﬁght and Harry hits Jess with a bottle. Harry goes to Honey’s hotel room and orders her to quickly pack so they can get out of town. Charlie stops the two lovers and takes them to the sheriff ’s ofﬁce and the next morning they learn that Nancy has been found unconscious on the roof of her pool house. Suffering from burns and scratches around the neck, she is treated by Dr. Cushing and a nurse (Eileen Stevens). After Honey hears Cushing tell the nurse to be careful not to give Nancy an overdose of her medication, she convinces Harry to get rid of his wife by that method. That night Harry sneaks into Nancy’s bedroom to kill her but the nurse follows him and when she turns on the light she becomes hysterical because Nancy has greatly increased in size. A specialist, Dr. Von Loeb (Otto Waldis), is brought in by Cushing and the two men have the unconscious Nancy chained and give her huge amounts of morphine. The sheriff and his deputy ﬁnd large footprints on the estate. Dubbitt and Jess follow the tracks into the desert and come upon the UFO. They enter the craft and ﬁnd a room in which precious gems, including Nancy’s diamond, are apparently used to power the craft. The giant chases them out and destroys their car but returns to the orb when Dubbitt uses hand grenades. The spaceship takes off and the two men start to walk back to town. Nancy wakes up and calls for her husband. Harry refuses to allow her any other medical treatment although Von Loeb wants to operate on her in hopes of reversing the growth process. The two doctors use an elephant syringe to give Nancy more drugs but she comes to and breaks through the roof and sets out to ﬁnd Harry. Cushing, Von Loeb and the nurse drive back to town and along the way pick up the sheriff and Jess as Nancy frightens an old prospector (Thomas E. Jackson). She destroys the hotel where Honey rooms and then tears the roof of the bar where Harry and Honey have been drinking. Harry shoots at Nancy. A huge beam falls on the table under which Honey is hiding, crushing her. Nancy picks up Harry and begins walking away as the sheriff ﬁres at her with a shotgun. The giant woman walks into some power lines and Dubbitt shoots at them, causing an explosion that electrocutes Nancy, who falls to the ground, holding her dead husband. Dennis Fischer wrote in Science Fiction Film Directors, 1895 –1998 (2000), “Despite its shoddy effects such as its see-through double exposed space giant, or maybe because of them, Attack of the 50 Foot Woman retains its appeal due to a sly sense of humor, the pulchritudinous appeal of its star Allison Hayes, and some ﬁne supporting performances.” In Science Fiction (1984), Phil Hardy noted, “The corniness of Hanna’s screenplay and Juran’s plodding direction…. The special effects are dire….” Bill Warren in Keep Watching the Skies! The 21st Century Edition (2009) said, “Some people consider this to be one of the\n\nThe Bat\n\n13\n\ngreat inadvertent comedies of the 1950s…. The ﬁlm’s own screwy logic is relentless, there are several scenes which couldn’t have been more outrageous if they had been designed to be, and the special effects are jaw-droppingly awful.” Portions of Ronald Stein’s score are included in the compact disc Not of This Earth!: The Film Music of Ronald Stein (Varese Sarabande VSD-5634), issued in 1995.\n\nThe Bat (1959; 80 minutes) Producer: C.J.

Under that title it was ﬁlmed by Selig Pictures in 1915 by director Edward J. Le Saint, starring Guy Oliver, Edith Johnson, Stella Razetto, Eugenie Besserer and Bertram Grassby. Five year later Rinehart and Avery\n\nAgnes Moorehead and Lenita Lane in The Bat (1959)\n\n14\n\nFeature Films\n\nAgnes Moorehead, Lenita Lane and Vincent Price in The Bat (1959)\n\nHopwood collaborated on a stage version, The Bat, which debuted at Broadway’s Morosco Theatre on August 23, 1920, and had a run of 867 performances. The cast included Efﬁe Ellser, Edward Ellis, Anne Morrison and May Vokes. Two years later it was staged in London and in its cast were Claude Rains, Arthur Wontner (a future screen Sherlock Holmes), and Eva Moore; it ran for over 300 performances. Mary Pickford produced the ﬁrst screen adaptation of The Bat (United Artists, 1926) featuring her younger brother Jack Pickford along with Jewel Carmen, Louise Fazenda, Emily Fitzroy, Robert McKim, Sojin, Eddie Gribbon and Tullio Carminati. It was adapted to the screen and directed by Roland West, who also did the same chores for the ﬁrst sound version of the vehicle, The Bat Whispers, which was produced by Art Cinema Corporation and issued by United Artists in late November 1930. Chester Morris, Una Merkel, William Bakewell, Gustav von Seyffertitz, Richard Tucker, Grayce Hampton and Maude Eburne headed the cast. May Vokes repeated the role of Lizzie in the 1937 Broadway revival of The Bat which also featured Minnette Barrett, Herman Lieb, Linda Lee Hill and Robert Ober. The production had a brief run on Broadway early in 1953 with Lucille Watson, ZaSu Pitts and Shepperd Strudwick. At the end of that year it was presented on the syndicated Broadway Television Theatre program, starring Estelle Winwood, Alice Pearce and Jay Jostyn. In March 1960, “The Bat” was an episode of NBCTV’s Dow Hour of Great Mysteries and its cast included Helen Hayes, Jason Robards, Shepperd Strudwick, Bethel Leslie and Margaret Hamilton. Eight months before the NBC-TV program, Allied Artists released a screen version of\n\nThe Bat\n\n15\n\nGavin Gordon, Lenita Lane (in background), Vincent Price, Agnes Moorehead, Riza Royce and Elaine Edwards in The Bat (1959)\n\nThe Bat with the advertising pitch, “When the Bat ﬂies, someone dies.” Silent screen star Crane Wilbur adapted the Rinehart-Hopwood play and also directed the ﬁlm for Liberty Pictures. He previously wrote House of Wax (1953) and The Mad Magician (1954), both vehicles for Vincent Price, who headlined this third version of The Bat in the expanded role of Dr. Malcolm Wells. Despite top billing, Price had less screen time than co-star Agnes Moorehead, who dominates the proceedings as mystery writer Cornelia Van Gorder. Some publicity was generated for the movie by including Darla Hood, once the little darling of the “Our Gang” comedies, in what would be her ﬁnal ﬁlm. Gavin Gordon, as Lieutenant Anderson, and John Sutton, playing Warner the butler, were featured although the ﬁlm would have beneﬁted if they had swapped roles. Variety called the production “sluggish.” In Theatre: Stage to Screen to Television (1981), William Torbert Leonard noted it had “overactive performances and a lack of deﬁnition both in characterization and incident, and one is left caring as little about the victims as about the identity of [the Bat].” Filmed in the spring of 1959, the production is deﬁnitely the least of the three screen versions of the highly successful mystery play but it is not without merit and overall is a well-made and fairly entertaining horror-mystery. Of particular interest is the underplayed friction between the characters of Dr. Wells, Lieutenant Anderson and Warner the butler. Best-selling mystery writer Cornelia Van Gorder (Moorehead), along with rough-hewn Lizzie Allen (Lenita Lane), her companion, lease a remote mansion called the Oaks so she\n\n16\n\nFeature Films\n\ncan concentrate on writing a new novel. Once they are settled, Lizzie complains that the servants want to leave because a series of murders were committed in the area by a hideous cloaked maniac known as “The Bat.” She also claims there are rumors the madman has released rabid bats in the locale. Going to the local bank, the two women meet Vic Bailey (Mike Steele), the vice-president, and his pretty bride Dale (Elaine Edwards). Vic says he is surprised that his boss, bank president John Fleming (Harvey Stephens), who built the Oaks, had rented it and she informs him the transaction was handled by insurance man Mark Fleming ( John Bryant), John’s nephew. Cornelia and Lizzie are also introduced to Police Lieutenant Andy Anderson (Gordon). After they leave, Vic and Dale tell the law ofﬁcer that the bank has been robbed of over one million dollars in bonds and securities. Anderson wants to call in the bank president but he is out of town on a hunting trip with the local doctor, Malcolm Wells (Price). At their remote cabin, John Fleming informs the physician that he embezzled the money from the bank and offers him one-half of it if he will stage a false death for him by killing their guide Sam. When Wells hesitates, Fleming threatens him. Fleming’s attention is diverted when he notices the woods are on ﬁre, and Wells shoots him. Several days pass and Cornelia and Lizzie read in the newspaper that Vic Bailey is in jail accused of embezzlement. The novelist refuses to believe he is guilty. All of their servants except chauffeur Warner (Sutton) quit and Cornelia promotes him to butler. That night a terrible thunderstorm erupts and as Cornelia is about to latch the front door Lizzie screams as a clawed hand reaches for her boss. The hand disappears. A ﬁgure in black breaks into the house and releases a bat through a bedroom transom. It bites Lizzie before Cornelia traps it in a closet. Cornelia calls Wells, whom Anderson spies experimenting on a bat in his home laboratory. After Wells leaves, the policeman searches the lab as the doctor goes to the Oaks and examines Lizzie. He takes the bat with him for an examination but tells the women he thinks it is not rabid. As the physician leaves the house, Anderson shows up and tells the women the culprit is the Bat and that he will have the place watched. Worried about the savings he had in the bank, Anderson goes to see Mark and tells him he feels Vic is innocent and that John Fleming (whose body has been brought home and buried) robbed the institution and hid the money at the Oaks. Mark informs him that Judy Hollander (Hood), his uncle’s secretary, plans to testify for Brady at his trial. Judy and Dale are invited by Cornelia to stay at the Oaks. Also living in the house is Jane Patterson (Riza Royce), the new cook. Cornelia conﬁdes to the women she thinks John Fleming embezzled the bank’s money which is hidden in the house and the Bat is trying to ﬁnd its location. She has Dale telephone Mark to inquire if he has the plans for the ediﬁce and he says he thinks they may be there and he will come search for them. After dinner, Cornelia announces she will write a mystery novel about the missing money and the Bat and she asks Dale to be her secretary. Mark secretly enters the house and locates a small closet behind a clock. There he ﬁnds the plans but he is attacked by the Bat and killed. When the women hear the clock striking, something it has not done before, they investigate and ﬁnd the murdered Mark hanging in the closet. The police and Wells are called. When the physician shows up, Anderson questions him but is told it was his night off. Later the butler follows the police lieutenant when he roams around the grounds. During the night, the dark ﬁgure cuts the telephone lines and goes to the third ﬂoor and begins removing part of a wall. The noise awakens Judy and Dale who investigate. The Bat kills Judy on the stairway as he makes his escape. Anderson shows up and Mrs. Patterson tells him that Warner is absent. The unkempt butler arrives and says he was struck on the head while trailing the policeman around the estate. Since Cornelia hit the escaping Bat with a poker on the side of the head, Anderson\n\nBeast from Haunted Cave\n\n17\n\naccuses Warner of being the madman. The doctor suddenly returns to the Oaks, claiming he was in a car accident, and Anderson also suspects him of the crimes. Detective Davenport (Robert B. Williams) is assigned to guard the house but during the night he is drugged. Cornelia goes back to the third ﬂoor and ﬁnds a secret room, containing a locked safe, behind a ﬁreplace. She gets locked in the room while the Bat surprises Wells in his laboratory and kills him. Lizzie revives Davenport and the two locate Cornelia who is about to suffocate in the closed room.

Associate Producer: Charles Hanawalt. Director: Monte Hellman. Screenplay: Charles B. Grifﬁth. Photography: Andrew Costikyan. Editor: Anthony Carras. Music: Alexander Laszlo. Sound: Charles Brown. Production Coordinator: Beach Dickerson. Technical Advisors: Ed Keene and Birdie Arnold. CAST: Michael Forest (Gil Jackson), Sheila [Noonan] Carol (Gypsy Boulet), Frank Wolff (Alexander “Alex” Ward), Wally Campo (Byron Smith), Richard Sinatra (Marty Jones), Linne Ahlstrand (Natalie), Christopher [Chris] Robinson (Creature/Bartender), Kay Jennings ( Jill Jackson), Imelda (Small Dove).\n\nAt a remote lodge in the Black Hills of South Dakota, Alex Ward (Frank Wolff ) takes ski lessons from instructor Gil Jackson (Michael Forest), who also runs a bait shop with his sister Jill (Kay Jennings). Alex has come to the area with his heavy drinking girlfriend Gypsy (Sheila Carol) and two cohorts, taciturn Marty (Richard Sinatra) and goofy Byron (Wally Campo), to rob the local bank. Alex hires Gil to take the group on a two-day skiing trip to his cabin in the forest and he orders Marty to plant dynamite in a mine. He plans to use the explosion as a cover when they rob the bank. That evening Gypsy drinks too much and makes a pass at Gil. Marty talks barmaid Natalie (Linne Ahlstrand) into going with him to the mine. There he sets the explosives to go off at nine the next morning and he also sees fragments of what appears to be a giant egg. As he begins to make love to Natalie, a tall, web-covered monster (Chris Robinson) attacks the girl. Marty returns to the hotel-bar and tells Alex what happened but his boss thinks he is crazy. To get Gil out of town, Alex has Gypsy meet him at the ski lift as Alex, Marty and Byron hear the mine explosion and then break into the bank, where each of them takes two gold bars. The trio heads to the trailhead where they meet with Gil and Gypsy and head cross-country to Gil’s cabin, where Alex plans to rendezvous with a pilot who will ﬂy the robbers to Canada. That night they stop along the trail to sleep and Marty says he thinks they are being followed. While standing guard he hears strange noises and, going to investigate, he ﬁnds Natalie in a cocoon in a tree. Marty becomes distraught but refuses to talk. The next day, Gil spots unknown animal prints in the snow. Arriving at the cabin, the skiers meet Gil’s housekeeper Little Dove (Imelda), whom Byron thinks wants to scalp him. Rather than returning to the lodge, Alex suggests they stay the night at the cabin. Over the radio they hear about the bank robbery and the explosion that killed one of the miners. The news of the man’s death causes Gypsy to drink more and she kisses Gil who is then forced to ﬁght Alex and Marty but is stopped at gunpoint by Byron. Alex slaps Gypsy who later meets outside with Gil and tells him she stays with Alex because he saved her from an unsavory past. The monster shows up outside\n\n18\n\nFeature Films\n\nthe cabin and attacks Marty but he scares it away. The next morning, while Gil chops wood, he is told by Gypsy that Alex plans to murder him. When Gil tells her he will ski back to town and get the law, she asks to go with him. Marty locates a cave that he thinks houses the monster. Alex conﬁdes to Byron he plans to kill Gil and Small Dove (even though Byron has grown fond of the Indian woman), and that he wants to get rid of Marty who is no longer trustworthy due to his maniacal desire to kill the mystical beast. When Alex later inquires about Gil’s whereabouts, Gypsy tells him he has gone deer hunting. When she goes outside, she is followed by Byron who sees her depart on skis. The monster attacks Byron, who throws a torch at it. The ﬂeeing creature carries off Small Dove. Gil waits for Gypsy on the trail and the two begin skiing back to the lodge. Marty tells Alex about seeing the egg shell in the mine and theorizes that the monster hatched out of it. Byron sneaks out of the cabin in search of Small Dove. Going to the cave, he ﬁnds Natalie and the Indian woman encased in webs along a wall. As he is about to free them, the monster attacks him. Gil and Gypsy arrive at the cave to get out of a coming blizzard. Leaving Gypsy at the entrance, Gil explores the cavern and sees Byron, Natalie and Small Dove in their cocoons as the beast tries to kill him. Gil shoots at the creature and Gypsy arrives and begins throwing rocks at it. Gil yells to Gypsy to run away. As she does so, she meets Alex and Marty, who have come armed with weapons and ﬂare guns, and she tells Alex that Gil is inside the cavern, unarmed. The monster kills Alex and fatally wounds Marty who, before dying, shoots one of the ﬂare guns, setting the beast on ﬁre and destroying it. Gil and Gypsy embrace and escape from the cave of horror. Cult director Monte Hellman made his debut with Beast from Haunted Cave, which was ﬁlmed on location in Deadwood, South Dakota, by the Filmgroup, a company owned by the Corman brothers, Roger and Gene. Seeking new locales, the producers decided on South Dakota since it was a non-union state; the money they saved by not dealing with unions was used to make a second feature. Gene and Hellman ﬁlmed Beast for two weeks and then Roger produced and directed Ski Troop Attack in the following fourteen days. Charles B. Grifﬁth wrote both scripts and Michael Forest, Frank Wolff, Wally Campo, Richard Sinatra and Sheila Carol appeared in both. Roger was the uncredited executive producer on Beast. He and Gene asked Paul Blaisdell to create the title monster but when he wanted too much money they assigned the task to Chris Robinson, who not only appeared as the creature but also had a small role as the bartender at the ski resort town’s bar-hotel. He made the beast out of plywood covered by chicken wire to which he attached putty and angel and crepe hair. Robinson later starred in the horror ﬁlm Stanley (1972). The Beast has often been described as a spider-like creature but it has a more ghostly appearance, sort of a tall emaciated corpse covered with webs. For the most part the Beast is only seen ﬂeetingly, thus heightening the fright value of the creature. The ﬁlm itself is a somber affair, its main locales being the bar-hotel, the remote cabin and the cave. Even in the outdoor scenes there is no sunlight, the shooting apparently taking place under overcast conditions. The characters differ drastically: Gil, the hero, is almost intolerably dull, while the sadistic Alex is a thug, girl-shy Marty is psychotic and his pal Byron is almost brain dead. The most interesting of the lot is Gypsy, a drunken hooker, nicely enacted by Carol, who reforms at the ﬁnale and wins the hero’s love. As Sheila Noonan, Carol appeared the same year in producer-director Jerry Warren’s vapid The Incredible Petriﬁed World. Richard Sinatra, who played Marty, was the son of bandleader Ray Sinatra, the ﬁrst cousin and musical mentor of Frank Sinatra. While trying to romance Gil’s sister Jill, Marty’s character reverts to hip talk, and throughout the feature the characters of Alex and Gypsy refer to\n\nBeyond Love and Evil\n\n19\n\neach other as “Charles.” When the ﬁlm was scheduled for TV release it proved to be a bit short and director Hellman ﬁlmed a couple of additional minutes with his wife Jaclyn doubling in the role of Jill Jackson. Although cheaply made and given only quick playoff (and, like most of the Filmgroup product, not even copyrighted), Beast from Haunted Cave leaves a somewhat positive impression with the viewer, something not always accomplished by late 1950s sci-ﬁ–horror efforts. In fact, its main assets may very well be its impoverished look, unusual locations, a set of diverse characters and a genuinely scary monster. It got quick theatrical playoff by Allied Artists, on a double bill with Roger Corman’s The Wasp Woman (q.v.), in the late summer and fall of 1959.\n\nBeyond Love and Evil (1971; 89 minutes; Color) Producer: Roland de Nesle.

Made by Comptori Francais du Film Production in 1969, it was shown in its homeland as La Philosophie dans le Boudoir (The Philosophy of the Boudoir) and had its plot origins in the 1795 novel by the Marquis de Sade. Its alternate French titles were Decameron Francese and De Sade 76. U.S. outings were trimmed by three minutes. For horror fans the plot includes a torture dungeon in an old chateau inhabited by a huge ape man called Varlac (Serge Halsdorf ), who delights in ravishing nubile young women. After a skeleton on a cross is set on ﬁre, a young man, Zenoff (Lucas de Chabanieux), travels at night to the chateau of Xenia (Souchka), the woman he loves. He is unaware she belongs to a sex cult led by Yald (Fred Saint-James), whom she intends to marry. The two announce their wedding plans at a dinner party at which the guests engage in body painting. Yald tells the group they can have sex with his bride but only after he has consummated their marriage. Zenoff is quite upset and doubts that the betrothed are truly in love. When a young woman (Nicole Huc) is accused of breaking the cult’s rules, she is thrown out of the castle, given a head start and then pursued through the woods. As she is about to escape through a fence, she suddenly stops and lets herself be captured. For the evening’s entertainment, Yald releases Varlac (Halsdorf ), an ape-like man, who pursues the runaway and rapes her in his cell as the cultists watch and then engage in a orgy. The next day, another young woman (Doris Thon) is sent into the woods and hunted by the cultists who capture and beat her. Zenoff tries to get Xenia to run away with him but ends up having sex with her. Later the cultists watch as Xenia and Yald consummate their marriage. Zenoff is shocked by the proceedings. He and Yald agree to a contest in which the winner gets Xenia if she can be picked out of all the women wearing masks. Yald wins but during their second game with knives he is stabbed by Zenoff. Xenia becomes the cult leader. Following another orgy,\n\n20\n\nFeature Films\n\nshe has the young man engage in the ﬂogging of a girl and then he goes with Xenia to her bedroom. There she has one of the cultists beat him before Xenia throws Zenoff out of the chateau, despite his begging her to let him stay. The previous year Allied Artists released another European production based on DeSade’s novel Eugenie… The Story of Her Journey Into Perversion (q.v.).\n\nBlack Zoo (1963; 88 minutes; Color) Producer: Herman Cohen.

CAST: Michael Gough (Michael Conrad), Jeanne Cooper (Edna Conrad), Rod Lauren (Carl Conrad), Virginia Grey ( Jenny Brooks), Jerome Cowan ( Jerry Stengel), Elisha Cook, Jr. ( Joe), Marianna Hill (Audrey), Oren Curtis (Radu), Eilene Janssen, Eric Stone (Newlyweds), Dani Lynn, Susan Slavin (Art Students), Edward Platt (Detective Rivers), Douglas Henderson (Lieutenant Mel Duggan), Jerry Douglas (Perkins), Claudia Brack (Carl’s Mother), Daniel Kurlick (Carl as a Child), Byron Morrow (Coroner), Michael St. Angel (Ofﬁcer Donovan), Joseph Mell (Frank Cramer), Warrene Ott (Mary Hogan), George Barrows (Victor the Gorilla), Herman Cohen (Guided Tour Member).\n\nTwenty-seven years before the formation of People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA), Black Zoo contained a similar organization, the True Believers. This group, however, believed in the migration of animal souls and one of its members, zoo owner Michael Conrad (Michael Gough), used his “pets” to get rid of those who got in his way. In The Encyclopedia of Horror Movies (1986), Phil Hardy wrote, “Ineptly scripted, ploddingly directed, wildly overacted by Gough … it has nowhere near the same charge as the very similar Murders in the Zoo (1933). But [Floyd] Crosby’s camerawork is excellent, and no ﬁlm that has the wit to include a scene in which Gough ushers a lion, tiger, a black panther and a cougar into his sitting-room, installs them on couches and easy chairs, and solemnly indulges them with a lullaby on the organ, can be all bad.” Released by Allied Artists in May 1963 and also called Horrors of the Black Zoo, the feature was the last of three horror outings Gough headlined for producer-writer Herman Cohen, preceded by Horrors of the Black Museum (1959) and Konga (1961). The actor went on to appear in two Cohen horror ﬁlms with Joan Crawford, Berserk (1967) and Trog (1970). Among Gough’s other genre efforts are Horror of Dracula (1958), The Phantom of the Opera (1962), Dr. Terror’s House of Horrors (1965), They Came from Beyond Space (1967), Crucible of Horror (1970), Horror Hospital (1973), Satan’s Slave (1976), The Serpent and the Rainbow (1988) and The Haunting of Helen Walker (1985). He is probably best remembered as butler Alfred Pennyworth in Batman (1989), Batman Returns (1992) and Batman Forever (1995). Herman Cohen (1925–2002) produced and often co-wrote a number of other genre efforts, including Bela Lugosi Meets a Brooklyn Gorilla (1952), Target Earth (1954) [q.v.], I Was a Teenage Werewolf, I Was a Teenage Frankenstein, Blood of Dracula (all 1957), The Headless Ghost (1959), A Study in Terror (1965), Craze (1974) and Watch Me When I Kill (1977). The director of Black Zoo, Robert Gordon, also helmed It Came from Beneath the Sea (1955). The same year he co-starred in Black Zoo, Rod Lauren appeared in Terriﬁed and The Crawling Hand. Virginia Grey was also in Cohen’s Target Earth, House of Horrors (1946), Who Killed Doc Robin? Unknown Island and Jungle Jim (all 1948). Jerome Cowan’s genre credits include Fog Island, The Crime Doctor’s Courage and The Jungle Captive (all 1945), Night in Paradise\n\nBlack Zoo\n\n21\n\nRod Lauren, Jeanne Cooper and Michael Gough in Black Zoo (1963)\n\nand Flight to Nowhere (both 1946), Night Has a Thousand Eyes (1948), Have Rocket, Will Travel (1959), Visit to a Small Planet (1960) and The Gnome-Mobile (1967). In the Westwood section of Los Angeles, a young woman (Warrene Ott) is mauled to death by a tiger while walking home. The next day Michael Gordon (Gough), the owner of Conrad’s Animal Kingdom, shows off his prize animals, including a tiger, lion, black leopard, cougar and Victor (George Barrows), a huge gorilla, to a tour group. The audience is also treated to a chimp show given by Gordon’s wife Edna ( Jeanne Cooper). Verbose developer Jerry Stengel (Cowan) comes to see Gordon and offers to buy his land for a housing project he wants to build but the zookeeper refuses to sell and orders the obnoxious businessman off his property. Gordon chews out mute animal keeper Carl (Rod Lauren) for not keeping the animal cages clean and then orders him to bring the big cats to his study where he plays the organ and lectures them about greedy men who want their land and how he will always protect them. The next day Stengel returns and promises to zone off the area as a residential district, close the zoo, have Conrad’s license revoked and the animals condemned. Gordon then agrees to the deal. That night Carl drives him to the developer’s home but before signing the contract, Conrad lets in King, a lion, who kills Stengel. The day after the developer’s death is reported, Gordon is contacted by the police to see if any of his animals have escaped. Three pretty art students (Marianna Hill, Dani Lynn, Susan Slavin) get the owner’s permission to sketch his animals. One of them, Audrey (Hill), is attracted to Carl and they start to become friends. That evening, Edna’s drinking upsets Gordon and they argue over Carl because she wants the young man to be sent to a special school where he will get an education. Gordon slaps his wife but then apologizes. While\n\n22\n\nFeature Films\n\nfeeding Baron, a tiger, zookeeper Joe (Elisha Cook, Jr.) torments the animal and it claws him. Joe shoots the big cat. When Gordon ﬁnds out, he beats the worker until Edna begs him to stop. Sending his wife back to their house, Gordon and Carl throw Joe into the lion’s cage where he mauled to death. Under cover of night, the Gordons and Carl bury Baron in an old cemetery. Gordon attends a meeting of the True Believers, an animal lovers’ cult, where he is consoled and given a tiger cub. The group performs a ceremony that passes the soul of Baron into the body of the young cat. Edna’s former agent and friend, Jenny Brooks (Grey), convinces her to accept an offer to star with her chimp act in the Madison Circus for a year. When Gordon ﬁnds out about the agreement, he and Carl take Victor to the agent’s garage and when she returns home it kills her. During a police investigation, the coroner (Byron Morrow) informs Lieutenant Duggan (Douglas Henderson) that the woman was done in by a tremendous blow to the head that was not administered by a human. Police Chief Rivers (Edward Platt) refuses to believe the death was caused by an animal until a laboratory technician ( Jerry Douglas) conﬁrms that hair found in Jenny’s hand was not human. Edna becomes upset when she learns of her friend’s death. After Gordon leaves to attend a meeting of the True Believers, Edna hears on the radio that Jenny was murdered by an animal and she comes to realize that her husband is behind the killing. After forcing Carl to reveal that he drove Gordon to Jenny’s house the night before, she tells the young man they will leave that night and he can become her assistant in the chimp act. As they are about to depart during a thunderstorm, Gordon returns and Edna accuses him of causing Jenny’s death. As Gordon begins to beat his wife, she begs Carl to help her and he says the young man is his son. Carl remembers that as a child (Daniel Kurlick) he witnessed his father murder his mother (Claudia Brack) and the shock caused him to lose his voice. When Gordon orders Carl to open the lion’s cage so he can dispose of Edna, the young man rebels and the two men ﬁght in the rain. Gordon calls for the big cats to help him as Carl strangles his father. Black Zoo is highlighted by the reverent burial of the tiger in a spooky cemetery while its ravaged slayer is unceremoniously disposed of off-camera, and the chimp act sequence when one of the participants is urged to smoke a cigarette. The year of the ﬁlm’s release, Charlton Publications, who did Horror Monsters and Mad Monsters magazines, issued a comic book made up of photographs from the ﬁlm. Titled Horror Monsters Presents Black Zoo, it was billed as “A Picture by Picture Chiller Mag.”\n\nBlood and Black Lace (1965; 84 minutes; Color) Producers: Massimo Patrizi and Alfredo Mirabile.

After leaving Christina’s, the highclass fashion salon where she works, the young woman is stalked by a masked ﬁgure in black\n\nBlood and Black Lace\n\n23\n\nwho kills her and drags her body to a secluded area. As Countess Christina Como (Eva Bartok), the owner of the establishment, closes for the night, she threatens to ﬁre Isabella for being absent during the evening, and later ﬁnds her corpse in a clothes closet. Inspector Sylvester (Thomas Reiner) talks with Christina and co-owner Max Martan (Cameron Mitchell), who tells him to contact the dead woman’s roommates Nicole (Arianna Gorini), Peggy (Mary Arden) and Greta (Lea Kruger), models for the salon. Dress designer Cesar Losarre (Luciano Pigozzi) informs Sylvester that Isabella’s lover was antique dealer Sacolo. The inspector calls on Sacolo and says cocaine was found in Isabella’s home. During a showing at the salon, Nicole ﬁnds a diary that belonged to the murdered model. She tells Christina that she will turn it over to the police the next day. She then telephones Frank who asks her to come to his shop. When she does, the masked maniac torments her before killing her with a metal hand with knife-like ﬁngers. When the murderer fails to ﬁnd the diary in her purse, he drives off in her car. Peggy and Marco (Massimo Righi) meet at her home where they are greeted by housekeeper Clarise (Harriet White Medin). After she leaves, Marco tells Peggy he loves her. Peggy gets a telephone call from Reiner informing her that her car, which Nicole had borrowed, has been found abandoned. The ofﬁcer says he is coming to see her and Marco leaves. Peggy reads part of the diary and then burns it in a ﬁreplace. When she answers the door, the hooded ﬁend drags her back into the apartment. After he beats her, she informs him that she burned the diary. When he hears the police arriving he knocks her out and carries her away. Sacolo comes to the villa Christina shares with Marquis Richard Morrell (Franco Ressel) and tells them he found Nicole’s murdered body in his shop. He suggests they each give the other an alibi. When Morell refuses, Frank reminds him he signed IOUs to Isabella for several thousand dollars he could not repay. Bound and gagged, Peggy is kept in a dank cellar by the killer. As he beats and tortures her she rips off his mask, and he drives her face into a hot stove. Reiner questions Frank about Nicole’s murder and accuses him of being a drug addict. At police headquarters, the inspector asks Clarise to identify any of the suspects she saw driving Peggy’s car, and Marco accuses Cesare of being the murderer. Marco suffers an epileptic ﬁt and is taken to the hospital. Reiner informs Max, Frank, Cesare and the marquis they are all suspects in the killings and has them placed under arrest. That night at the salon, Greta is afraid to go home alone but she is sent away by Christina who drives to the chateau where she discovers the body of Peggy in the trunk of her car and drags it inside.

When he embraces and kisses her, she shoots him. Christina calls the police and then dies holding her lover. In 1960 Allied Artists released the Italian production Caltiki the Immortal Monster (q.v.), photographed by Mario Bava, who was also the feature’s uncredited co-director. Following the success of Bava’s ﬁrst ofﬁcial directorial assignment, Black Sunday (1960), which American International Pictures released in the U.S., Allied went on to issue Bava’s Blood and Black Lace in the spring of 1965. Its pre-release title was Fashion House of Death and in a few locales it got distribution by Woolner Bros. A co-production of France, Italy and Monaco, the ﬁlm was released in Italy in 1964 as Sei Donne per l’Assassino (Six Women for the Killer) at 88 minutes, four minutes more than its stateside showings. The ﬁlm was dubbed by Allied Artists with Paul Frees supplying most of the male voices, including that of top-billed Cameron Mitchell. Its thin story of a stocking mask–wearing maniac in black murdering various women in gruesome ways was typically enhanced by Bava (some sources claim that he was also the ﬁlm’s co-photographer), with terriﬁc visuals that included mostly night and inside locales, rain-swept terrain and dark shadows. John Stanley’s Creature Feature Movie Guide Strikes Again (1994) noted, “Bava uses primary colors to psychological effect, creating the paradox of a beautiful-looking movie about death.” Castle of Frankenstein #8 (1966) said the ﬁlm was a “[m]inor Italian-made chiller … Mostly whodunit fare, but director Mario Bava adds horriﬁc overtones.” James O’Neill in Terror on Tape (1994) felt that “Bava’s neon-colored atmosphere paved the way for the lush cosmopolitan thrillers of Dario Argento and has violence, which, though not overly gory, is still pretty strong stuff…. Only the poor dubbing detracts from the overall effect.” Video Hound’s Complete Guide to Cult Flicks and Trash Pics (1996) reported, “The story is violent and suspenseful, and Bava brings to it his trademark atmospheric cinematography, careful use of color, and perverse manipulation of characters.” In Spaghetti Nightmare (1996), Luca M. Palmerini and Gaetano Mistretta called Blood and Black Lace the “[f ]oundation stone of the Italian thriller.”\n\nBlood Rose (1970; 91 minutes; Color) Producer: Edgar Oppenheimer.

Others in the canon include Spain’s Gritos in la Noche (Cries in the Night) (1962), released stateside in 1965 as The Awful Dr. Orloff, the British production Corruption (1967) and the 1970 ﬁlm La Rose Ecorchee (The Burnt Rose) from France. Allied Artists issued the latter that October in the U.S. as Blood Rose; it got an R rating. It was billed as “The First Sex-Horror Film Ever Made” although that claim probably goes to director Jess Franco’s 1967 production Succubus. Franco directed The Awful Dr. Orloff starring Howard Vernon in the title role and the actor was also in Succubus as well as having special billing in Blood Rose. La Rose Ecorchee ran 95 minutes when it was shown in France but its Allied Artists stateside version was minus four minutes of lesbian scenes. In Italy it was shown as Tre Gocce di Sangre per una Rosa (Three Drops of Blood for a Rose). When it was issued in Great Britain in June 1970 by S.F. Distributors at 88 minutes, it was titled Ravaged and was assigned a Certiﬁcate X. It had limited release in West Germany as Die Geschaendete Rose. At a remote chateau, Frederic Lansac (Philippe Lemaire) and his friend and business partner Wilfried (Gerard Huart) await a doctor’s verdict on the condition of Frederic’s wife Anne (Anny Duperey), who has been badly burned in a ﬁre. Frederic, a famous portrait painter as well as a botanist and beauty salon owner, recalls how he rejected the advances of his former girlfriend Moira (Elisabeth Teissier) after hiring beautiful Anne as his new model. He falls in love with Anne, who has inspired his best paintings, and takes her to his old country castle where she tells him she wants to live. They are tended by two dwarfs, Igor (Roberto) and Olaf ( Johnny Cacao), who have been at the chateau since Frederic was a boy. To celebrate their marriage, Anne gives an outdoor costume party. When Moira arrives, the two women have words and Anne backs into a bonﬁre with her dress catching ﬁre. As a result, Anne can never walk again, her eyesight is somewhat blurred and her face is terribly disﬁgured. She insists her death be announced and lives at the chateau hidden away from the world. The institute Frederic operates with Wilfried hires Dr. Romer (Vernon) to work on a formula extracted from a poisonous plant. Since Frederic can no longer paint because of what happened to his wife, Wilfried, who has to go away for a time, suggests he take over running the institute. Agnes (Michelle Perello) is hired to take care of Anne as Frederic brings home one of the deadly plants to study. Anne becomes jealous of Agnes. After the blonde nurse becomes Frederic’s lover, Anne induces her to touch the plant, causing the nurse to die. Anne informs her husband she caused the girl’s death because she was too beautiful. That night Frederic and the dwarfs bury the victim. At the institute, Frederic overhears Romer talking about performing facial surgery at his home and that night he follows him there and confronts his employee. Romer admits he lost his medical license after the failure of a skin graft technique he developed and that he was sent to prison. After being freed, he was forced to change the facial features of criminals and took the institute job to put that in his past. Frederic takes Romer to examine Anne but he says it is hopeless since he would need a living woman’s face to replace hers and the donor would die in the process. Anne dreams that her beauty is restored but she is haunted by the visage of Agnes’ resurrected corpse. Frederic opens a letter from Agnes’s sister Barbara (Olivia Robin) telling her that she and Paul ( J.P. Honore) plan to marry. After a number of young women are judged, Frederic orders Romer to take Catherine (Valerie Boisgel) to the chateau for the skin graft surgery. At the chateau, the two dwarfs sexually assault and kill Catherine, causing the now\n\n26\n\nFeature Films\n\nmad Anne to beat them. Pretending to be a writer researching an article on old chateaus, Barbara arrives and is asked to stay the night by Frederic after a terrible storm erupts. Finding a photograph of herself with Agnes, the young woman explores the castle and sees Catherine’s corpse. Frederic realizes Barbara’s true identity and has her put in a dungeon. When Igor tries to molest her, Barbara knocks him out with a water pitcher and runs away but is recaptured by Frederic. Police Inspector Dorte ( Jacques Seiler) confronts Romer after a gangster with a changed face is found murdered. The doctor denies any knowledge of the event. After he gets a call from Frederic ordering him to come to the chateau to perform the skin graft, he sneaks out of his apartment building and eludes the watchful policeman. Barbara begs Romer, who feels the graft will not be successful, to let her go. Romer hangs himself. Anne wakes up to ﬁnd him dead and blames Frederic and the dwarfs for her being unable to have a new face. The dwarfs drag her into the hall and kick Anne to death. As Frederic tries to cut Barbara free, Igor attacks him. The two ﬁght with Frederic being badly wounded. Barbara kills Igor with a scalpel. She tries to help Frederic but Paul arrives and she makes him drive her away from the chateau. The dying Frederic phones the police and tells them he killed his wife and a servant and that two women are buried on the chateau grounds. As Olaf mourns Igor’s death, Frederic tries to ﬁnish his portrait of Anne. Blood Rose contains quite a bit female nudity and its leisurely paced story is enhanced by surreal atmosphere and a dream-like staging technique. A great asset is the huge old chateau where most of the action takes place. Donald C. Willis wrote in Horror and Science Fiction Films (1972), “Lush music, weird little atmospheric bits, and senseless bursts of brutality, all of which adds up to nothing but a small bore.” In Film Review 1971–1972 (1971), F. Maurice Speed dubbed the ﬁlm a “chiller-diller.” Michael J. Weldon noted in The Psychotronic Encyclopedia of Film (1983), “This strange, atmospheric production is more warped than usual, thanks to two dwarf servants who wear animal skins, are sexually active, and generally get underfoot.” When the feature was issued on video in Germany as Horrormaske (The Mask of Horror), Video Watchdog #12 ( July-August 1992) said, “The ﬁlm is an early example of the combination of horror and nudity, typical for the work of French ﬁlmmakers in the ’70s.”\n\nBluebeard’s Ten Honeymoons (1960; 92 minutes) Producer: Roy Parkinson.

Bluebeard became a term synonymous with bigamist killers and was the nickname of Henri Desire Landru (1869–1922), the famous French serial killer. John Carradine played the title role in Bluebeard, a 1944 PRC production directed by Edgar G. Ulmer; three years later Charles Chaplin wrote, directed, composed the music and starred in United Artists Monsieur Verdoux, a comedy melodrama based on a story by Orson Welles about the Landru\n\nBluebeard’s Ten Honeymoons\n\n27\n\nSpanish lobby card for Bluebeard’s Ten Honeymoons (1960), picturing George Sanders and Patricia Roc\n\ncase. In 1963 Charles Denner had the title role in the French production Landru, released as Bluebeard by Embassy Pictures in the United States. Richard Burton starred in the 1972 release Bluebeard, directed by Edward Dmytryk. Sandwiched between the Chaplin ﬁlm and the 1963 French production was Bluebeard’s Ten Honeymoons, which Allied Artists issued in the spring of 1960. Filmed in France and at England’s Elstree Studios, Bluebeard’s Ten Honeymoons was directed by W. Lee Wilder and written by his son, Myles Wilder. The elder Wilder was the brother of Billy Wilder. W. Lee and Myles Wilder had earlier collaborated on Phantom from Space (1953), Killers from Space, The Snow Creature (both 1954), Fright (q.v.) and Manﬁsh (both 1956) before the son began working exclusively in television. W. Lee Wilder went on the make The Man Without a Body (1957), Caxambu (1967) and The Omegans (1968); his best ﬁlm was his directorial debut, the taut ﬁlm noir melodrama The Glass Alibi (1946), which he remade in 1955 as a shallow imitation called The Big Bluff. He also produced The Great Flamarion, a 1945 Republic release. The title role of Landru in Bluebeard’s Ten Honeymoons was played by suave George Sanders, who was also no stranger to horror, sci-ﬁ and fantasy ﬁlms. Among his many genre credits are The Man Who Could Work Miracles and Things to Come (both 1936), Rebecca and The House of the Seven Gables (both 1940), The Lodger (1944), Hangover Square, The Picture of Dorian Gray and The Strange Affair of Uncle Harry (all 1945), The Ghost and Mrs. Muir\n\n28\n\nFeature Films\n\n(1947), From the Earth to the Moon (1958), Village of the Damned (1960),The Jungle Book (1967; voice only), The Body Stealers (1969) [q.v.], Future Women (1970), Endless Night (1971), and Doomwatch and Psychomania (both 1972). The brother of actor Tom Conway, Sanders (who was once married to Zsa Zsa Gabor and was later her brother-in-law) committed suicide in Spain in 1972 at age 66. Paris antique furniture store owner Henri Landru (Sanders) becomes infatuated with cabaret singer Odette (Corinne Calvet) and she takes him to her apartment thinking he is rich. The young woman’s lover, Pepi (Sheldon Lawrence), calls her and she informs Landru that her mother needs ﬁve thousand francs for an operation. After giving her two thousand francs and promising the rest, Landru stays the night with Odette but the next day she will have nothing to do with him when he cannot come up with the rest of the money. Wanting to win back Odette, Landru agrees to help Vivienne Dureaux (Patricia Roc) sell some furniture. He is introduced to her sister Giselle (Ingrid Hafner). Vivienne is attracted to Landru who is unable to sell the furniture to another dealer, Lacoste (George Coulouris). When he ﬁnds out that the woman has sold the furniture, Landru, who has told her he is a retired army colonel, tries to persuade her to let him invest the proceeds. When she refuses, he pushes her off a bridge and steals her money, ring and keys. Going to her apartment, Landru sells the dead woman’s possessions and gives the money to Odette, who takes him back. Changing his name and shaving his beard, Landru answers a newspaper advertisement placed by Julienne Guillin ( Jean Kent). He tells her he is a diplomat and takes her for a weekend at a remote villa he rented near the village of Gambais in Austria. There he proposes marriage and she accepts, giving him access to her bank account and apartment. Landru murders Julienne and cuts up her body, burning it in the villa’s large game roasting stove. After getting the murdered woman’s funds, Landru asks Odette to marry him but she refuses. He continues to obtain money by romancing a quartet of rich widows whom he murders for their savings. His next victim, Jeanette (Greta Gynt), is murdered in Paris and her body is buried in two suitcases at a building site after which he pretends to be her husband and raids her bank deposit box. While at the bank he meets Madame Boyer (Selma Vaz Dias) and ﬁnds out that her husband deserted her two years before and left for Africa. Landru pretends to know her husband and claims he is owed a gambling debt. He ﬂeeces the woman out of the money and takes it to Odette but overhears her and Pepi deride him. Later Landru asks Odette to join him at the Austrian villa and tries to poison her. When the singer realizes her benefactor is trying to kill her, she mocks him and his habit of recording all purchases, including the weapons he used to murder his victims. Landru beats Odette to death and burns her remains. Giselle, who has located the man who bought her sister’s furniture and through him gets Landru’s name, tells the police what she has learned and goes to Gambais. Landru is about to leave the village when the station master (Paul Whitsun-Jones) informs him of Giselle’s arrival. He goes back to the villa where he ﬁnds her searching the place. He tries to kill her but is interrupted by the police and runs into the forest where he is captured after being attacked by Julienne’s cat Max, who he let run wild after her murder. Landru is tried and convicted of his many offenses and is guillotined. Eugene Archer wrote in the New York Times, “Under W. Lee Wilder’s melodramatic direction, the suave matrimonial criminal is neither a ﬁgure of dark comedy nor an anarchistic symbol of the post-war devaluation of human life. He is merely a not-too-bright ‘con man’ who stumbles into his murderous career…. George Sanders half-heartedly tries to inject an occasional note of jocularity … but he soon surrenders to occupational fatigue.” Variety also found fault with Sanders who the reviewer said “is completely bogged down by\n\nThe Body Stealers\n\n29\n\nhis material.” Regarding the overall production, the British Monthly Film Bulletin complained, “Period, background and mood all ﬂuctuate maddeningly.” Co-star Corinne Calvet gave a deft performance as the seductive, two-timing Odette.\n\nThe Body Stealers (1969; 89 minutes; Color) Producer: Tony Tenser.

It received an R rating due to brief nudity. In its homeland it was called Thin Air; some stateside release prints carried the title The Invasion of the Body Stealers, apparently an attempt to confuse the public into thinking the feature was akin to Invasion of the Body Snatchers (1956) [q.v.]. Despite a top-notch cast and more than passable production values, the feature is a drawn-out affair. Films and Filming declared, “[D]espite the efforts of Patrick Allen, George Sanders and, in particular, Hilary Dwyer, disbelief is not suspended for one moment of the ﬁlm’s seemingly lengthy ninety minutes.” Top-billed Sanders also headlined Sagittarius’ The Candy Man the same year. NATO representatives General Armstrong (Sanders), Lieutenant Bailes (Michael Culver) and parachute designer Jim Radford (Neil Connery) observe a test ﬂight in which a trio of pilots try out Radford’s new suits. During the demonstration, the men disappear into a red cloud and only the parachutes reach the ground. At an air show, three skydivers also disappear in a red cloud and the next day it is revealed that a total of eleven men went missing while using parachutes. Jim suggests to Armstrong that his friend Bob Megan (Patrick Allen), a veteran skydiver, be hired to investigate since bureaucrat Hindesmith (Allan Cuthbertson) demands immediate results. Bob agrees to do the job for $25,000. That night, while walking along a beach, he meets beautiful Lorna (Lorna Wilde), who runs away when he tries to make love to her. The next day Bob meets with the area’s space research laboratory director, Dr. Matthews (Maurice Evans), and is attracted to his lovely assistant, Dr. Julie Slade (Hilary Dwyer). As he looks at the recovered parachutes and checks the reports, Dr. Matthews suggests to Bob that he not keep his queries earthbound and have an open mind. Armstrong and Megan request that Hindesmith halt all military maneuvers since the missing men had space conditioning. The general is informed that one of the men has been found but he is dying. He and Bob rush to the research lab where Dr. Matthews says that the man has died, but not from injury, disease or exposure. Armstrong telephones Hindesmith who agrees to the grounding order. That night Bob again meets Lorna on the beach and they have sex. Later, when the young woman sees Jim taking\n\n30\n\nFeature Films\n\npictures of her, she runs away and Bob follows but loses her. Back at his hotel, Bob gets a call from Julie that is abruptly cut off. He drives to the lab where he ﬁnds her recovering from being knocked out. She informs him she was hit from behind; the parachutes are missing. Julie also says that test results show the dead man was changed as his organic cells were so altered he was no longer human and he was also radioactive. Dr. Matthews theorizes that the man was changed for another environment or atmosphere. When General Armstrong reveals that Lieutenant Bailes has been found murdered, Bob calls Jim at the hotel and asks him to bring a link hook he found at the airﬁeld to the lab; it proves to be radioactive. Hindesmith is told by Armstrong that Bob will make a parachute jump wearing a radiation-proof suit. Jim shows Armstrong the photos he took the night before of Bob and a young woman but only his friend is visible in the pictures. Just before the jump, Bob is visited by Lorna who begs him not to go through with it. He makes"
