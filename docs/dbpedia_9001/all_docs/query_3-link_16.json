I was 5-7 years old, so it had to be 1982-84-ish.\n\nUltra violent, people and kids getting stabbed and beheaded, blood and guts might have been on a different planet.\n\nI think it may have the word(s) 'planet' or 'horror' in it.\n\nI saw it in the movie theater with my dad. Had nightmares for weeks, mom was pissed.\n\nI saw it in the United States in downtown Virginia Beach, Virginia. Iâ€™m going to say it was in English because I was too young to read subtitles quickly enough for a movie.\n\nAny help I would definitely appreciated, I can die a happy man when I get the name of that dang title."
