It is not a play nor book nor movie, and not just simply a blueprint for a film. All movies, regardless of genre, depend on the screenplay. However it is the director who makes the movie by realizing the printed words of the script on film. I have seen mediocre screenplays made into very good films. And I have seen excellent screenplays made into bad movies by incompetent directors. Again, it’s important for people to understand that the screenplay’s essential role in film making is the same regardless of the genre of the film.

Today’s technological advances are allowing scary movies to be produced as a cottage industry and to be distributed worldwide. This genre has traditionally been seen as a ‘way in’ to the movie business and it is a truism that it is a great medium for budding directors and writer-director hyphenates. Horror has a track record of appealing to producers; however, the writer is most likely to get his work seen if it follows genre conventions. It is to this end that this book is dedicated. In order for the writer to sell his script, he must know his craft and understand the demands of the genre. Our intention is to give a thorough grounding in the history, tropes, subgenres, and in particular the pace and rhythm of horror, as well as its underlying meanings and subtexts, so that the writer will be armed and ready to face those legions of undead producers who are after his succulent brainzzz.\n\nChapter 1 Why Do We Like To Be Scared?\n\nThe first thing any writer needs to understand is ‘know your audience’. What is the attraction of horror? Why do we like to be scared? These questions have been addressed by myriad writers, philosophers and academics. The writer of horror movies requires an understanding of the theories behind the nature of horror. For the academic, the definition of horror is: ‘fear of some uncertain threat to existential nature and disgust over its potential aftermath’.2 The writer, in the case of author Stephen King, sees horror as something that serves as a ‘barometer of those things which trouble the thoughts of a whole society’.3 For Aristotle, horror (in drama) gave an audience the opportunity to purge itself of negative emotions through catharsis. Horror, in essence, is the fear of the unknown. Taking each concept in turn, let us examine them in more detail.\n\nFear and disgust I recognize terror as the finest emotion, and so I will try to terrorize the (reader) audience. But if I find I cannot terrify him/her, I will try to horrify; and if I find I cannot horrify, I’ll go for the gross-out. I’m not proud. (STEPHEN KING 1981, p. 37)\n\nR. Tamborini and J. B. Weaver. ‘Frightening entertainment: A historical perspective of fictional horror’. In J. B. Weaver and R. Tamborini (eds), Horror films: Current research on audience preferences and reactions. Mahwah, NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum, 1996; p. 2. 3 King 1981, p. 31. 2\n\n2\n\nWriting the Horror Movie\n\nIt is easy to bring to mind half a dozen movies that raise issues of fear and disgust: the ‘Saw’ franchise (Wan 2004–10), Texas Chainsaw Massacre (Hooper 1974), Hostel (Roth 2005), The Human Centipede (Six 2009), Martyrs (Laugier 2008) to name but a few. These films contain graphic scenes of violence, physical suffering and elements of Grand Guignol – a term for gore-laden horror derived from the Elizabethan/Jacobean theatre genre. In 1894, ‘Le Théâtre du Grand-Guignol’ was established by Oscar Metenier as a venue for naturalist performances. The building was originally a church with gothic structures placed about the walls of the building, exuding a feeling of eeriness from the moment audiences arrived. They endured the terror of the shows because they wanted to be filled with strong ‘feelings’. Many attended these shows to obtain feelings of arousal: beneath the balcony were boxes, originally built for nuns to watch church services, which were available for theatregoers to rent during performances, as they would often become aroused by the action happening on stage. It has been said that audience members were so boisterous that actors would break character and yell out, ‘Keep it down in there!’ There were also audience members who could not handle the brutality of the action on stage. Frequently the ‘special effects’ were too realistic, and audience members would faint and/or vomit during performances. Such is the appeal of disgust to an audience. The first popular example of this type of entertainment in cinema was Herschel Gordon Lewis’s Blood Feast (1963), where, in a pale echo of Frankenstein (Whale 1931), a scientist is engaged in collecting body parts. Rather than re-creating human life, this one needs body parts from women to conjure up a deceased Egyptian goddess. The film contains scenes of torture, dismemberment, decapitation and cannibalization, and is considered to be the first real ‘gross-out’ material of its time. Two decades later a spate of ‘video nasties’ was denied theatrical release and (in the UK) went out only on VHS. Censorship slipped away towards the end of the twentieth century, heralding a broader attitude to the cultural climate. Having said that, Hostel (Roth 2005) was considered to be ‘torture porn’ by critic David Edelstein, and the term has been applied retrospectively to the ‘Saw’ series (beginning in 2004), The House of 1000 Corpses (Zombie 2003), Wolf Creek (Mclean 2005), Ichi the Killer (Miike 2001) and Baise moi (Virginie Despentes, Coralie 2000) as well as many more. These movies show extreme torture sequences, headless torsos, sledgehammer blows etc., and yet many are mainstream Hollywood product with a wide release. Indeed, the torture porn (or ‘Gorno’) subgenre has been hugely profitable. The ‘Saw’ franchise has grossed over $100 million worldwide to date. Hostel, which cost less than $5 million to make, has grossed $80 million. Much of the attraction of these films is aided by the development of filming techniques, advances in CGI, prosthetics, special effects and high production values, all of which add to the ‘gross-out’ effect felt by the viewer.\n\nWhy Do We Like To Be Scared?\n\n3\n\nTheoretician Julia Kristeva wrote on the phenomenon of disgust and horror in her essay on the abject – a concept that exists between the concept of an object and the concept of the subject. The abject is seen as ‘other’, as something that as members of society we reject. Kristeva likens this rejection to the repulsion we feel when confronted by body fluids such as blood or semen and waste products like urine and faeces – things that were once a part of us but are no longer. We are at once repelled by and attracted to these internal– external elements. It is a fascination with the corporeal, which we will explore in greater detail in Chapter 3 (Werewolves and body horror). At its simplest, the abject is the scab on your knee which, as a child, you were repulsed by, but could not resist picking. In mainstream entertainment, there has been a growing fascination with the interior spaces of the body, as seen in TV franchises such as CSI. The body has become in part a transgressive intertext as well as a multimedia space. We have had exhibitions by artists such as Marc Quinn, who exhibited 4.5 litres of his frozen blood in the Saatchi Gallery (1992) placed in a mould to represent his own head, and Gunther Von Hagens’ notorious ‘Body Worlds’, a sensational exhibition of authentic human bodies, willed by donors through the Institute for Plastination’s Body Donor Program, and preserved using a process called plastination … [they] show the inner workings of the body and the striking whole-body specimens show the human body in real-life poses, as never seen before.4\n\nHow far can horror go? Censorship and taboo It is worth considering the influence of censorship on the writer and his work. Creating a screenplay and/or movie which is so extreme that it attracts opprobrium may be good publicity, but if this is merely down to gratuitous sex, violence or bad taste, then instead of horror it is pure sensationalism, and that is a different thing. In order to understand censorship, we should first look at its history and how tolerances have shifted over time. The Hays Code,5 named after Hollywood’s http://www.bodyworlds.com/en/prelude.html/ The German horror film Anatomy (Ruzowitzky 2000) has people being killed and plastinated by a secret sect, the Anti Hypocratic Order. 5 While the Hays Code was voluntary and self-regulating, it was put in place to avoid government intervention and rationalize a system that was becoming too unwieldy. Prior to this, individual states had their own censorship policies. By 1921, legislators in 37 states had introduced almost 100 movie censorship bills. 4\n\n4\n\nWriting the Horror Movie\n\nchief censor of the time, Will H. Hays, was formed in the belief that audiences needed moral protection. Father Daniel A. Lord and Martin Quigley, a lay Catholic, created a code of standards in 1929, which they then presented to Hays, their particular concern being the effect of films on children. Several studios met with Lord and Quigley and, after some revisions, they agreed to the stipulations of the Code. One of the main factors in adopting the Code was to avoid government intervention: police yourself before others do it for you. The Code was divided into two parts, the first a general set of principles, which mostly concerned morality. The second was a set of particular applications involving a list of elements that could not be shown on screen, such as the mixing of race. Nowadays, in most countries, to stipulate this would not only be unacceptable to audiences, it would be against the law. Further dictates of the Code were that sexual relations outside of marriage could not be portrayed as attractive – a reason why the opening scene of Psycho (Hitchcock 1960) was taboo-busting (Crane and Loomis were unmarried). Criminal action had to be seen to engender punishment, and neither crime nor criminals could be portrayed to elicit sympathy from the audience. It is hard to imagine something like Silence of the Lambs (Demme 1990) being passed under this regime. In 1966 Jack Valenti became president of the Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA) and decided that the Hays Code was out of date. A new system had to be introduced. On November 1, 1968, the voluntary MPAA film rating system took effect, with three organizations serving as its monitoring and guiding groups: the MPAA, the National Association of Theater Owners (NATO) and the International Film Importers & Distributors of America (IFIDA). The original movie ratings were: G: General Audiences – Suggested for general audiences (all ages) M: Mature Audiences – Suggested for Mature Audiences; Parental discretion advised R: Restricted – People under 16 not admitted unless accompanied by parent or adult guardian X: Adults Only – People under 18 not admitted (changed to under 17 later that year). The content classification system was originally to have three ratings, with the intention of allowing parents to take their children to any film they choose. However, the National Association of Theater Owners urged the creation of an Adults Only category, fearful of possible legal problems in local jurisdictions. The ‘X’ rating was not an MPAA trademark: any producer not submitting a movie for MPAA rating could self-apply the ‘X’ rating (or any other symbol or description that was not an MPAA trademark).\n\nWhy Do We Like To Be Scared?\n\n5\n\nWith the introduction of a rating system, the US was a latecomer as far as film classification was concerned. In the United Kingdom, the BBFC (British Board of Film Classification) had relaxed its views in the early 1960s and it was as early as 1932 that an H for Horror certificate was placed to alert parents to horrorthemed material. Though this was removed in favour of the universal ‘X’ rating in 1951, it was again altered, to ‘18’, in 1982. Today the highest ratings are ‘18’ and ‘R18’ (restricted to those aged 18 and older) and only available at licensed cinemas and sex shops, the latter not requiring a licence to sell ‘R18’ films. There are many myths about how the BBFC rates movies (one of which apparently involves using a protractor, although this has been repudiated). ‘Broadly speaking you will not see real male erections below an 18 [certificate]. But at 18 it’s OK’, says David Cooke, Director of the Board. ‘Probably the nearest we get these days to getting out the protractor is on language.’6 The Board has reluctantly concluded there is no substitute for counting the swear words in a film. ‘It doesn’t mean that’s the only thing we look at – particularly with the f-word and the c-word – we’ll look at whether they’re comically mitigated, or aggressively aggravated, for instance. But if you don’t count, you discover there’s no stable boundary. So the rule of thumb is four fucks maximum at 12A.’ (ibid.) The board is aware of the changes in what an audience will and will not tolerate: ‘When you look at some of the films from the Video Nasty era, like “House on the Edge of the Park” [Ruggero Deodato 1980], which has lingering shots of women being mutilated, that just wouldn’t be made today. It’s always been rated, but with cuts. There’s a really unpleasant sequence where a teenage girl is forced to strip and her breasts are cut with a razor blade. It’s really highly sexualized. … People think you should be free to make up your own mind about what you watch, provided it’s not illegal or harmful. That means we do pass some very strong material at 18. But we’re not just doing it because we’re inventing it – that’s in line with that particular public finding.’ (ibid.) The Exorcist (Friedkin 1974) was considered so shocking to moviegoers that many were subject to nausea, convulsions, fainting and shocking displays of anger: one viewer in San Francisco attacked the movie screen, attempting to kill the demon. Paramedics were called to screenings, and it wasn’t long before picket lines appeared at theatres. The film was banned on video for 14 years in the UK. The Texas Chain Saw Massacre (Hooper 1974) is known for its extreme acts of violence, but actually shows little blood and no close-up of fatal blows, making it much tamer than its successors in the genre. Despite this, it was banned in Australia, Brazil, Finland, France, West Germany, Chile, Iceland, Ireland, Norway, Singapore, Sweden and the UK. France banned the film twice, claiming it would incite violence. It was not issued uncut in the UK for 25 years. http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/2012/jul/26/sex-violence-swearing-film-100-years-bbfc\n\n6\n\n6\n\nWriting the Horror Movie\n\nThe Last House on the Left (Craven 1972) was Craven’s feature debut. His portrayal of two teenage girls kidnapped by escaped convicts, who then rape and torture them, proved too real for moviegoers. Craven defended the film by saying it was ‘a reaction on my part to the violence around us, specifically the Vietnam War’, and yet the movie was censored in many countries including the UK, where it was banned for 17 years and subject to censorship until 2008. More recently, the BBFC has ‘only allowed a certificate to The Human Centipede 2 after 32 cuts had been made, including the “graphic sight of a man masturbating with sandpaper around his penis”.’ In 2010 A Serbian Film (Spasojević 2010) was pulled from International Horror film festival FrightFest, not because it was deemed too horrific but because its organizers had planned to show the picture in its original uncut version and were overruled by the local council in Westminster, London. ‘FrightFest has decided not to show A Serbian Film in a heavily cut version because, as a festival with a global integrity, we think a film of this nature should be shown in its entirety as per the director’s intention,’ said event co-director Alan Jones. Subsequently, Raindance Film Festival picked up the film at Cannes in May and then held the UK premiere, finding a way around the ban by billing the screening as a ‘private event’. The Sun, a UK tabloid newspaper, described the film as ‘sick’ and ‘vile’ following the festival’s 2010 press launch. In March 2011, A Serbian Film won the Special Jury Prize in the 31st edition of Fantasporto, Portugal’s biggest film festival, in Porto. The answer to the question ‘How far can I go?’ depends on you. What it is that you want for your movie? If you are putting in elements of horror that are nothing to do with plot, narrative and story arc, then you are no longer in control of the story.\n\nThe social barometer Stephen King suggests that horror acts as a barometer for issues that bother us as a society. For the writer of horror it is useful to consider the concept and to study past movies for evidence of this. Carrie (De Palma 1976) is a prime example. In the early 1970s, the fear of the feminine was a real issue as second-wave feminism rolled across the USA. The film begins with an almost pornographic view of pubescent high school girls in a communal shower. It is accompanied by cheesy music, which becomes dark and intense as the story unfolds to show teenage bullying and Carrie’s first period. The horror for Carrie really begins as she steps over the threshold into\n\nWhy Do We Like To Be Scared?\n\n7\n\nwomanhood and her powers increase to demonic levels. This could be read as a societal concern about the growing power of women, particularly young women as they learn to express themselves and their own powers of intellect and expression. More recently, The Mist (Darabont 2007) picks up on fear of ‘alien’ invasion – a theme that has often fascinated moviemakers – and also scientific investigation into new methods of warfare. It is a throwback to the old monster movies of the 1950s wherein the scientists were up to no good ‘up at the plant’. The story then twists to its darker heart, the rise of Fundamentalism – in this case, Christian. It is all wrapped up in the fear of the outsider, the invisible entity bearing down upon us. This is not new. It was explored in Shakespeare’s The Tempest, and in the 1956 movie Forbidden Planet (Wilcox 1956) in which Doctor Morbius (Pigeon) and his beautiful daughter Altaira are the only survivors on planet Altair (formerly inhabited only by scientists). A rescue mission finds them in thrall to a mysterious invisible beast, the Krell, which roams the planet. In The Mist, rather than concentrate on what might or might not have been going on at the military base (the vague ‘Project Arrowhead’), we are invited to concentrate our attention on events in the supermarket. Mrs Carmody is a religious zealot who feeds off the fear of the others. She begins as a figure of pity and contempt (in effect, the local bag lady) but, as events worsen, Mrs Carmody lures in those who dismissed her, and soon the crowd are caught up in her hysteria. Her monstrous ideology is a direct reflection of the monster outside – manifesting itself as awful abjections: tentacles, moth-like primordial creatures, stinging flying things that burst open to reveal hundreds more replications. King is addressing contemporary fears head-on – fundamentalism in both religion and science.\n\nCatharsis Catharsis is the opportunity for the audience to purge itself of negative emotions in a safe environment. Within the confines of the viewing area – a cinema or a living room – the audience feels a sense of relief once the film is over. There have been suggestions that catharsis can result in audiences finding what they see on the screen exciting, and that exposure to these images will increase subsequent acts of aggression – an alarming idea for the screenwriter. However, there is strong evidence7 that suggests it has the opposite effect, that horror acts as\n\nB. J. Bushman and R. G. Geen. ‘Role of cognitive-emotional mediators and individual differences in the effects of media violence on aggression’. Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 58. 1990. 7\n\n8\n\nWriting the Horror Movie\n\na safety valve rather than an incitement to justified aggression. This theory is known as Excitation Transfer8 by which the audience experiences an intensification of positive effect in response to plot and resolution – i.e. where the evil is overcome by the hero/heroine. It would also appear that it is not reliant on a happy ending, but simply on a satisfactory resolution – in effect, that it follows the plot points expected of the genre. We will see how this works in greater detail in Chapter 4. Of all genres, Horror is perhaps one of the most strict when it comes to obeying the rules. A film such as The Orphanage (Bayona 2007) takes us through each stage towards catharsis. There is a sense of unease as Laura arrives at the orphanage. The house looms above her and we wonder if she has seen something. There is a growing sense of dread as we see the child with the sack over his head, as doors slam and children are heard in the empty house. Then there is the disappearance of Simón – the horror of losing your child, and the growing fear that he might be gone forever, brings us to the most horrific element of all – his death, not only that but at Laura’s unwitting hand. At the end, Laura commits suicide and so is reunited with Simón. Though not a happy ending, it brings a sense of resolution. This is catharsis. The Orphanage deals with the loss of a child and a sense of guilt, and is similar in tone to The Awakening (Murphy 2011), which has a more ambiguous ending. Here a nanny, Maud, has poisoned herself and ghost hunter Florence so as that they might be together with Tom, a dead child. Florence, however, tells Tom she doesn’t want to die now but that she will always be with him (he is her deceased sibling). The child helps Florence by obtaining the medicine that will make her regurgitate and thus purge herself of the poison. The final scene shows us Florence leaving the school, ignored and unseen by senior staff members. This is perhaps either because she is a ‘mere’ woman (it was set in 1921) or because she has indeed become a ghost, a fact suggested by her white coat. It is left to the audience to draw its conclusions, but emotional catharsis has been achieved in Florence’s new and full awareness. Previously, she had been in denial of the truth, a trope we see recurring in characters such as Eleanor Lance in The Haunting (Wise 1963) and Dr Malcolm Crowe in The Sixth Sense (Shyamalan 1999). There is a huge risk in leaving your resolution undecided, and you need to be confident in your skills as a writer to attempt it. In some ways, loose ends make for better movies in this genre, but if you go for this, you must still aim for closure in your catharsis.\n\nGlenn D.

For Freud, horror was the manifestation of recurring thoughts and feelings that had been repressed by the ego but that seem vaguely familiar to the individual.9 For Jung, however, horror gained popularity from its connections and relationships with important archetypes, particularly with shadow archetypes such as shadow mother or father – or both, as in Mum & Dad (Shell 2008). Here, ‘Mum’ and ‘Dad’ live under the flight path of London’s Heathrow Airport. Their ‘adopted’ (kidnapped) children, Birdie and Elbie, work at the airport in menial jobs. When Lena, a young Polish cleaner, is befriended by Birdie, she is drawn into the family’s world of torture, murder and perversity. Treated ‘like one of the family’, Lena is designated as ‘Mummy’s Girl’, which is when the horror begins. Her only options are to join in the madness or die. Here, the traditional role of loving parents has been subverted into darker shadow archetypes. Dad is ‘given’ Lena by Mum for Christmas – whether for sexual or cannibalistic gratification, we are unsure. The family, as with the cannibal Hillbilly’s in Tobe Hooper’s The Texas Chain Saw Massacre (Hooper 1976), play on the accepted language of familial relationships but as an inverse nightmare parody. This shadow archetype is also seen in Kubrick’s The Shining (Stanley Kubrick 1980) with great effect. Not only does Kubrick use the father figure as shadow father, but also as shadow king – the Overlook Hotel symbolizing his castle. Kubrick uses mirrors and doubling, further distorting the image of the ‘father’ figure. Jack is often talking to himself in the mirror, and the huge, wall-sized mirrors of the ballroom reflect the stages of his growing dementia. His son Danny, too, demonstrates an understanding of the world as being inverted, with his constant referrals to ‘redrum’. For these kinds of movie to work, the audience needs to suspend its disbelief. For the horror fan, this suspension has to be rooted in an understanding of what is real and the perception of a supernatural force or gross abnormality. Whether it is the supernatural idea of a house being haunted, the King of Darkness rising from the dead or that a child could be possessed by the Devil, we have to believe for 90 minutes that these things are just possible in order to enjoy the experience. Even films that are not supernatural still require the same suspension. Jaws (Spielberg 1975) asks us to believe that a shark with a brain the size of a walnut can outwit a Chief of Police, a highly educated marine biologist, and a seasoned shark hunter. It is this dependence on suspension of disbelief that has driven the medium from the beginning. It is the screenwriter’s\n\nWalters 2004.\n\n9\n\n10\n\nWriting the Horror Movie\n\nart to create a meaningful and consistent reality for a producer and director to buy into. In order to do this, a study of the form, with expectations running high and quality a necessity, is today mandatory.\n\nChapter 2 Horror Movie History\n\nHorror stories have been with us for centuries, fireside tales developed into stories and novels, plays, and now movies and games. The horror movie began with monsters, most especially the ‘undead’. The fear of what happens after death feeds into this. What if you’re not really dead? What if you come back as something ‘other’? What if you become neither fully dead nor fully alive? These fears are born out of both man’s desire to be immortal and the complexities of the psyche and its inability to make sense of death. Mary Shelley’s Frankenstein, written in Switzerland in 1816 (published in 1818), is a gothic romance: entertainment for friends while Shelley was trapped indoors by inclement weather during a holiday with her lover.10 It was Lord Byron, a friend and neighbour in Switzerland, who set the competition to see who could write the best ghost story. The Frankenstein story follows the bringing to life of a body constructed from the parts of other bodies. Shelley takes elements of the Abject and combines them with that most horrific of ideas, that man can be created by man and not by God: thus a monster is born. It is commonly believed that it is the creation that is Frankenstein, whereas it is in fact the creator – who therefore ought to be viewed as the real monster. The novel appeals because of the taboos it deals with. At a time when good Christian folk believed absolutely in man as the divine creation of God, to have a mortal attempt to create life was both shocking and horrific. Mary Shelley subtitled her story ‘The Modern Prometheus’, referring to the god who angered Zeus by bringing fire to mankind. The story appeals on many different levels and this is at the root of its popularity and longevity. Horror deals with taboos but must simultaneously appeal to the masses. It reaches us\n\nAlthough Mary was actually Mary Godwin at the time, the two travelled as Mr and Mrs Shelley. Shelley was still married to Harriet, who died later that same year on 3 December. Mary Godwin and Percy Shelley were married on 30 December. 10\n\n12\n\nWriting the Horror Movie\n\nat a deep psychological level and allows us to explore areas of the psyche within the confines and safety of a story. Vampires are the most common enduring monsters in horror. Bram Stoker’s Dracula was written in 1897 and, though it is a work of fiction, part of its appeal lies in its historical roots. How much Stoker was aware of this can only be a matter of conjecture, but connections between Stoker’s Count Dracula and the Transylvanian Vlad III Dracula of Wallachia have often been stated. During his reign (1456–62), ‘Vlad the Impaler’ is said to have killed up to a hundred thousand people (including political rivals, criminals, and anyone else he considered to be useless) by impaling them on sharp poles. For this he was revered as a folk hero. The name Dracul is derived from a Chivalric order called ‘The Order of the Dragon’, founded in 1431; due to his bravery in fighting the Turks, Vlad II was awarded the order, which was passed on to his son Vlad III (Dracula meaning son of Dracul). It is believed that Stoker came across the name in his reading on Romanian history and renamed his villain, who was originally called ‘Wampyr’. Other influences on Stoker’s work are the Irish writer Sheridan Le Fanu’s vampire novel Carmilla (1872), the sidhe (from Gaelic mythology including stories of women who drank blood), Jules Verne’s novel Castle of the Carpathians and Anne Radcliffe’s The Mysteries of Udolpho. That Stoker frequently visited the Yorkshire coastal town of Whitby is well recorded, and he used many real locations both from there and in London, distorting the geography from time to time for the sake of the story. Dracula was adapted into a play by Hamilton Deane in 1924, though Stoker himself wrote the first theatrical adaptation, presenting it at London’s Lyceum Theatre under the title Dracula, or ‘The Undead’ in May 1897 shortly before the novel’s publication. It was the first adaptation to be authorized by Stoker’s widow, and was performed only once, perhaps because it lasted for more than four hours! The play opens with Renfield, the servant of Count Dracula, offering a prologue. He explains that most people go through life not knowing their creator. He (Renfield) however, does. He explains that Dracula, his master, created him and he is the man who gave him immortality – ‘For which I will never forgive him.’ Renfield then bites into a rat, and the play begins. Tod Browning’s 1931 movie Dracula, starring Hungarian actor Bela Lugosi, popularized the screen image of the vampire, but it was by no means the first. There is a lost Russian horror film called Drakula from 1920 as well as the more widely known Nosferatu: A Symphony of Horror. This classic German Expressionist film11 directed by F. W. Murnau (1921) starred Max Schreck. It was There is debate about whether or not Nosferatu can be called a horror movie. The ‘Horror Movie’ was not recognized as a genre until the release of Dracula (Browning 1931). Frankenstein (Whale 1931) was the first film to be commissioned as a ‘horror’ by a studio. 11\n\nHorror Movie History\n\n13\n\nan unauthorized adaptation of the tale, and names and other details had to be changed, as the studio was unable to obtain the rights to the novel. The film works well, because Schreck held off as much as possible in the reveal of the monster, as happened later with James Whale’s Frankenstein (1931). Nosferatu was the only production of Prana Film studio (founded in 1921 by Enrico Dieckmann and Albin Grau). Grau maintained that the idea came from his war experience, when, in the winter of 1916, a Serbian farmer told him his father was a vampire and one of the undead. Grau and Dieckmann asked Henrik Galeen to write a screenplay based on Stoker’s novel. Galeen had already had experience in working in this area with his film Der Golem, wie er in die Welt kam (The Golem: How He Came into the World). Der Golem was a silent horror12 made by Paul Wegener in 1920 as part of a series begun in 1915 about the mythological Jewish Golem, an anthropomorphic being made from inanimate clay brought to life by the Hebrew word ‘emet’ (truth) written on its forehead. Removing one letter changed this to ‘met’ (death) and the Golem was thus deactivated. Filming for Nosferatu began in July 1921, mostly in Wismar, a small port in Northern Germany, although exterior shots of Transylvania were actually shot in northern Slovakia. Cameraman Fritz Arno Wagner only had one camera and therefore only one original negative. Murnau followed Galeen’s screenplay carefully, using handwritten instructions on camera positioning and lighting, though this didn’t stop him rewriting 12 pages of the script as some of Galeen’s text was missing from the director’s working copy. This concerned the last scene of the film, where Ellen sacrifices herself and the vampire dies in the first rays of the sun. That vampires are vulnerable to sunlight was not entirely Murnau’s concept. In Stoker’s novel, Dracula is weakened by it, but in Nosferatu, sunlight is fatal. Nosferatu keeps the main characters of Jonathan and Mina Harker, as well as the Count, but Arthur and Quincey don’t appear and the names of the characters have changed. Nor too does Orlock create other vampires by sucking their blood: he kills his victims outright. Bram Stoker’s estate sued Prana Film for copyright infringement and won, resulting in the company declaring bankruptcy. The court ordered all existing prints of Nosferatu burned, but one copy had been distributed around the world and, from this, duplicates were made. The film has a strong cult following and is considered a seminal work for film students and fans of horror. The film was marketed with a warning for the unwary, stating that ‘Nosferatu is not just fun, not something to be taken lightly’, and posters declaring ‘Its Only\n\nAs with Nosferatu, Der Golem, wie er in die Welt kam can be regarded as a horror movie only retrospectively. 12\n\n14\n\nWriting the Horror Movie\n\nA Movie … Only a Movie …’13 The makers of Frankenstein picked up this idea of warning the audience and heightening the suspense by using the actor, Edward Van Sloan (who played Dr Waldam), to step out from behind a curtain and deliver this friendly warning to the audience. We are about to unfold the story of Frankenstein, a man of science who sought to create a man after his own image without reckoning upon God. It is one of the strangest tales ever told. It deals with the two great mysteries of creation – life and death. I think it will thrill you. It may shock you. It might even horrify you. So if any of you feel that you do not care to subject your nerves to such a strain, now’s your chance to – uh well, we warned you. Frankenstein; James Whale 1931 Tod Browning’s Dracula was released in 1931, based on the play by Deane. After Bram Stoker’s wife sued Prana, Carl Laemmle Jr saw the box office appeal and legally obtained the novel’s film rights. Originally, it was thought that Lon Chaney would play the lead, having already played a fake vampire in London After Midnight (aka The Hypnotist: Browning 1927). However, Chaney was diagnosed with throat cancer in 1928 and was too ill to take up the role. Lugosi had played the role on Broadway and happened to be in Los Angeles when the film was being cast. There were several other actors up for the part, but Lugosi eventually won the studio over. It might have been his persistence in lobbying the executives, but it might also have been his willingness to accept the role for $500 a week, a lower figure than any other actor would accept. Universal decided to film a simultaneous Spanish-language version of the movie, using the same sets and costumes. This was common practice in the early days of sound and, although few versions still exist, Dracula is the exception. George Melford directed the Spanish version. The star, Carols Vilarias, was permitted to see the rushes of the English version so that he might imitate Lugosi’s performance. The Spanish crew watched the dailies and were able to work out better camera angles and lighting. Melford encouraged this in an attempt to ‘top’ the English version. For many, the Spanish Dracula is the superior movie. As well as these two versions, a silent copy of the film was also released. This enabled the film to be shown in as many movie theatres as possible and helped its popularity. There are over 200 film versions of the Dracula story. Whale’s Frankenstein was so successful it spawned the first sequel, Bride of Frankenstein (1935), in which Elsa Lanchester played both the Bride and Mary Shelley. As the Bride she\n\nA gimmick that was later used to publicize Wes Craven’s Last House on the Left (1972).\n\n13\n\nHorror Movie History\n\n15\n\nonly appears at the end of the movie and steals the picture. Despite this, she remains the only female horror icon of that time (and there have been precious few since then). Universal then monopolized the horror genre for over a decade, but other studios caught on to the financial benefits of developing horror stories. In 1942, Val Lewton at RKO produced Cat People, directed by Jacques Tourneur and based on Val Lewton’s short story The Bagheeta, published in 1930. The film tells the story of Irena (a young Serbian woman) who believes she is descended from a race of people who turn into cats when sexually aroused. The film is most famous for the invention of the horror technique known as the Lewton Bus. The term derives from a scene in which Irena is following her love rival, Alice. At the height of the scene, just as the audience is expecting Irena to turn into a panther at any second, the camera focuses on Alice’s terrified face, and a hissing sound breaks the silence. It is a regular bus pulling up front of screen. It is a false shock, which completely dissipates the tension and has become a widely imitated technique that is used to this day. A year later, Val Lewton followed up his success with I Walked with a Zombie (Tourneur 1943), based on an article of the same title written by Inez Wallace for American Weekly magazine. RKO loved the melodrama of the title and asked Lewton to come up with a movie to fit. The first version of the film was written by Curt Siodmak, who had written screenplays for The Wolf Man (Waggner 1941), Frankenstein Meets The Wolfman (Neill 1943), Ghost of Frankenstein (Kenton 1942) and The Invisible Woman (A. Edward Sutherland 1940). Ardel Wray, a young woman hired by Lewton from RKO’s Young Writer’s Project, reworked the script – the only woman credited with writing a Lewton film. Wray was brought in to flesh out the theme based on Haitian voodoo. Lewton is purported to have announced that the film would be a West Indies version of Charlotte Bronte’s Jane Eyre. Lewton later reworked the script a third time, by which time Siodmak had left the production. In 1932, Victor Halperin directed White Zombie, starring Bela Lugosi, for Universal. This film capitalized on the voodoo zombie themes of Seabrook’s book of 1928, The Magic Island, and introduced the term ‘Zombie’ into movie parlance. Jacques Tourneur was to direct the better known I Walked with a Zombie in 1943. It could be argued that The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari (Wiene 1920) was the first ‘Zombie’ movie, but there is a sea change here. Caligari’s creature, Cesare, is a somnambulist who sleeps in a coffin under the power of Dr. Caligari. This is closer to the stories of Haitian voodoo zombies that were controlled by one person – the bokor. Tourneur’s I Walked With a Zombie tries to keep to the Haitian template, but after this, the undead creature in thrall to its master mutates into an uncontrolled rampaging monster. The undead of old could not\n\n16\n\nWriting the Horror Movie\n\nbe fed, otherwise they would return to the grave. The new zombie attacks at will and is not under the control of any outside person. Later versions owe more to Norse mythology, which tells of a draugr – an animated corpse that roams beyond its grave to attack, eat and infect the living. A human killed by a draugr is destined to become one too. Romero’s Night of the Living Dead (Romero 1968) breeds the zombie with the vampire and creates the modern monster of the apocalypse. These ‘zombies’ can come back to life for almost any reason, but their bite will infect. Romero’s undead have a limited memory of their previous life, but can walk and use their hands. They understand doors and windows and have enough instinct to eat. They are not intelligent, having the single drive to seek out and consume living flesh. Romero showed the undead eating animals as well as humans. There is no reason for their need to eat flesh, just a driving will. Their gait is shambling and slow, and they can barely walk, let alone run. Nowadays we see zombies who sprint, climb walls and appear to have a higher level of intelligence than their earlier versions. This development came with 28 Days Later (Boyle 2002) and Zack Synder’s remake of Dawn of the Dead (Synder 2004), and is seen in force in La Horde (Dahan and Rocher 2009). In order to kill a zombie you must destroy its brain or cremate it. Body parts severed will become animated. In a recent development in [REC]3 Genesis (Plaza 2012) zombies are rendered ineffective by being read to from the bible. Go figure. It has been said that Hollywood invented the werewolf, but lycanthropic myths exist in ancient Greece, where references to it are to be found in the ‘Histories’ of Herodotus (450–20 bc). The Neuri, a Scythian tribe, were transformed into wolves once every year for several days and then changed back into human shape. Ovid (43–17 bc) also spoke of men being transformed into wolves in his ‘Metamorphosis’ (completed in ad 8). Werewolves in European folklore are said to show lupine traits in their human physical form, such as eyebrows meeting in the middle, long, curved fingernails, low-set ears and a loping gait. One way of checking to see if a man was a werewolf was to cut his flesh and see if there was fur in the wound. Russians believed that a man who was a werewolf would have bristles under his tongue. In animal form, he is seen as indistinguishable from other wolves, except for having no tail, human eyes and a voice. Swedish folklore believed the werewolf would run on three legs, stretching out the fourth so that it looked like a tail. It was also believed that werewolves were in the habit of digging up and eating recently buried corpses. By the nineteenth century, werewolves were no longer just male. In Scandinavia, they were believed to be old women who had poison-coated claws and were able to paralyse with a look. It was thought\n\nHorror Movie History\n\n17\n\nthat werewolves were born that way – but also that sleeping under a full moon, wearing a pelt of wolf skin or having epilepsy might transform a human into a werewolf. Transformation by bite or scratch by another werewolf is a modern device, perpetuated by horror fiction and movies, but this kind of transmission was rare in the myths and legends and bears more than a passing resemblance to the contagion of biting by vampire. In medieval Europe, the corpses of people executed as werewolves were cremated rather than buried to stop them coming back as vampires. The first werewolf movie was made by Universal and entitled Werewolf of London (Walker 1935). It starred Henry Hull who plays Wilford Glendon, a wealthy English botanist, attacked and bitten by a mysterious creature while on a field trip in Tibet. When he turns into a werewolf he has an instinctive desire to hunt and kill, but is later filled with remorse. He is ultimately shot and killed as a werewolf and reverts to human form as he dies. The film was not a success at the time, being regarded as too similar to Dr Jekyll and Mr. Hyde (Mamoulian 1931). Since then it has come to be regarded by film historians as a classic.14 One of the similarities between the two films is that, each time a man transforms, he becomes more animalistic than before, suggesting a progression in the development of the monstrous. The Wolf Man (Waggner 1941) starring Lon Chaney Jr is much the better known film and was Universal’s biggest hit of the year. Although Cry of the Werewolf (Levin 1944) depicts a female werewolf, it was not until Ginger Snaps (Fawcett 2000) that the female werewolf made any impact on the genre. The werewolf tended to be a very masculine monster, but Ginger Snaps has bred two equally good sequels and there are signs that we may be seeing more of the female werewolf or werevixen. With the outbreak of the Second World War, the horror movie made way for war movies, propaganda and documentaries, but a decade later it was again picking up on the zeitgeist and making our fears manifest. Mass invasion, the atomic bomb and bad science all had moviegoers seeking out new horizons, and there followed an exponential growth in a blend of Horror and Science Fiction, which too was heralding a new golden age. Movies such as The Thing from Another World (Nyby 1951), War of the Worlds (Haskin 1953), and The Day the Earth Stood Still (Wise 1951) are excellent examples of this crossover. This period also saw the reprise of the ghost story, perhaps the oldest form of horror closely linked to short stories and novels, as well as the beginnings of\n\nIt achieved an Oscar for Best Actor in a Leading Role (for Fredric March) and was nominated for Best Cinematography (Karl Struss) and Best Adaptation Writing (Percy Heath and Samuel Hoffenstein). 14\n\n18\n\nWriting the Horror Movie\n\nportmanteau horror,15 with Ealing Studios’ Dead of Night (Cavalcanti 1945) – a must-see movie, even now. The House on Haunted Hill (Castle 1959) stands out from the crowd partly for its camp creepiness and partly for its proximity to Psycho (Hitchcock 1960) in introducing the idea of the psychotic killer. Eccentric millionaire Frederick Loren (Vincent Price) invites five people to a party in a rented house, promising each of them $10,000 if they stay the night. As they arrive, each is given a pistol for protection. Loren’s wife tries to warn the guests that her husband is deranged. The tale is a mix of ghost story and whodunnit, with guests hunting for a killer who may or may not be a ghost. It makes its claim for horror with the emergence of a skeleton from a vat of acid, supposedly the dead Vincent Price – a trick replicated in cinemas with a real skeleton suddenly sweeping over the audiences, although this was later a cue for a volley of popcorn boxes. Castle was something of a showman and huckster, and created many gimmicks for his B movies, such as Percepto (The Tingler 1959), which shocked audiences in their seats, Illusion-O (13 Ghosts 1960), red and blue cellophane glasses, and a ‘fright break’ 45 minutes into Homicidal (1961). The question of places being haunted as opposed to people is not a new one. In Rene Clair’s The Ghost goes West (1935) an American businessman buys a Scottish castle and ships it brick by brick to America, to his chagrin finding that a centuries-old ghost has come along with it. That it is people who are haunted was explored in The Haunting (Wise 1963) which examined the psychoses of its lead character, Eleanor Lance, and which since then has become the dominant trope. If horror reflected the concerns of a society (fears of science, atomic bombs, men from Mars/Communists), the other overriding concern of this time was the psyche. America had discovered Freud’s talking cure, and ‘seeing a shrink’ was no longer the domain of the psychotic, more that of the neurotic. In The Haunting, Dr Markway is doing research to prove the existence of ghosts and visits Hill House to explore its tales of violent death and insanity.16 The Haunting was shot in black and white, a decision Wise had to fight for. He also had to sign an agreement accepting full responsibility for the effect of an experimental lens he had been sent and wanted to use, which distorted many of the images. The film was a success. Wise puts this down to the source of terror being ‘the unknown’, rather than a threat of physical pain or death. By refusing\n\nThis is a subgenre that was popularized in the 1960s by the UK’s Amicus productions, but with roots in cinema’s earliest anthology Unheimliche Geschichten or Five Sinister Tales (Oswald 1919), which featured Edgar Allen Poe’s ‘The Black Cat’ and R. L. Stevenson’s ‘The Suicide Club’. 16 Note the similarity in title to the House on Haunted Hill. The film was adapted from the novel by Shirley Jackson called The Haunting of Hill House, published in 1959. 15\n\nHorror Movie History\n\n19\n\nto resolve the film’s many questions, or to show the audience any direct ghostly manifestation, it became in effect a ghost story with no ghosts. The audience’s imagination created their own ghostly fears, making the experience of watching the film deeply personal. It was all done by suggestion, an important lesson to remember – and one forgotten, it seems, for the 1999 remake. The story of modern horror begins with Night of The Living Dead (Romero 1968), and it is from here on in that we see the clear divisions and subdivisions of the genre.\n\nChapter 3 Subgenres\n\nHorror divides into several clear subgenres, and it is important that the writer approaching a horror project has an understanding of the tropes and the underlying aspects of each subgenre. At the time of writing, the mash-up has become commonplace. Bleeding out of the ubiquitous zombie pictures of the late 2000s, it has led to literary attempts (Pride and Prejudice and Zombies), historical (Abraham Lincoln, Vampire Hunter), monsters (Megashark vs. Giant Octopus) and even an SF/Western crossover (Cowboys vs. Aliens). None of these were much good, and nor were the monster clashes of the 1940s, Hammer’s cheesier later sequels, Godzilla vs. Mothra, Freddie vs. Jason or Van Helsing, but their proliferation implies a regular rebirth for an easily sated audience. The mash-up is essentially collage, the early twentieth-century artistic experiment coined by Picasso and Braque. Unless you have a stupendous idea that will sell to a studio executive on its title alone, as did Snakes on a Plane, it is probably best avoided. In essence the horror genre can be divided into the following: MM\n\nThe undead (see Chapter 2 for the history), including vampires and zombies\n\nMM\n\nMonsters (see Chapters 2 and 5)\n\nMM\n\nPsychological horror\n\nMM\n\nDemons, possession, and child possession\n\nMM\n\nThe supernatural: Ghosts, Hauntings and Poltergeists\n\nMM\n\nWitchcraft and curses\n\nMM\n\nWerewolves and body horror\n\nMM\n\nBad science\n\nMM\n\nSlasher.\n\n22\n\nWriting the Horror Movie\n\nThe undead Mankind has always been fascinated by what comes after life, and indeed most religions have been founded on it, but what attracts the horror fan about the afterlife is that it’s going to come out of the grave and bite you in the neck. The Undead are the abject in extremis, at once both alive and dead, yet still mobile despite their extreme state of decomposition. In The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari (Wiene 1920) the dead are hypnotized, but in George Romero’s Night of the Living Dead (Romero 1968) they are a shambling mass that needs to feed. These ghouls can only be killed by severing the brain stem – a rule that still holds true to this day. There have been several explanations for the catatonic horde in this progenitor of the modern horror film, including their being a comment on the Civil Rights struggle, the Cuban Missile crisis or the Vietnam War. The sequel to Night of the Living Dead, Dawn of the Dead (Romero 1978), is thought to be about our wasteful consumerist society and/or our cold war/nuclear anxiety. In recent years zombies have illustrated post-9/11 fears, American foreign policy, the SARS epidemic and the inevitable collapse of capitalism. They are a multipurpose analogy. One zombie fits all. They can also be broadly satirical. Joe Dante’s chapter in the Masters of Horror TV series (Season 1, 2005–6, Episode 6: ‘Homecoming’) used the living dead as social satire, having undead soldiers come back to fight a re-election in the US. George Romero made his trilogy of ‘Dead’ movies but shifted towards the satirical position in Land of the Dead (Romero 2005). Here, the Dead walk the land but the rich are safe in fortified cities, an obvious metaphor for the class struggle or perhaps a post-9/11 immigrant situation (though Romero wrote the first draft before 9/11). His Diary of the Dead (Romero 2007) uses the found footage, documentary style beloved of recent years and tells the tale of students making a horror film at the time of the first outbreak. It has much to say about the culpability of the media and our obsession with documenting events rather than getting involved. There is also his misanthropic ending in which we begin to wonder if the human race is really worth saving. Danny Boyle’s 28 Days Later (Boyle 2002) is technically not a zombie film, as the Rage virus which infects the population keeps its victims very much alive, though partial to flesh eating (as in Romero’s The Crazies, 1973). There are, however, enough parallels and homages to the Romero canon to take them ‘as read’. The big difference was that these mothers could run! Zack Snyder’s Dawn of the Dead remake (Snyder 2004) was also tarred with this brush, although Romero has pointed out that, if they ran, their tendons would snap. This simple shift offered writers a choice. Do they continue to shamble\n\nSubgenres\n\n23\n\non, as in the excellent 2004 rom-zom-com Shaun of the Dead (Wright, 2004), or sprint for brains as in Boyle’s 28 Days Later or Resident Evil (Anderson 2002)? There is no question that the undead are with us and here to stay. They can equally represent Osama Bin Laden’s terrorists: Ozombie (Lyde 2012); or urban isolation: Colin (Price 2008). They can be metaphors for Mad Cow disease: Dead Meat (McMahon 2004); or retrodden as comedy in such dubious pleasures as Night of the Living Dorks (Dinter 2004), Dead and Breakfast (Luetwyler 2004), ZombieLand (Fleischer 2009) or the sublime, silly and sexy Zombie Strippers (Lee 2008). The subgenre has reached its baroque stage and there seems little more to say, but genres are cyclical and, in a few years’ time, who can tell what will leak out of the head of an undead writer. The other kind of Undead, in the form of vampires and their iconic chief, Count Dracula, is also continually subject to reinvention. We have had Buffy the Vampire Slayer on TV, then Interview with the Vampire (Jordan 1994) and, of late, the Twilight saga of five movies to date (Hardwicke 2008–), although these are more properly described as romantic fantasy, merely appropriating some of the traits of the vampire and werewolf. However, each has taken a new slant on an old story and there is always more to come.\n\nMonsters With advanced technology, green screen, CGI and the like, it has become possible to create almost any kind of multi-fanged and tentacle-endowed monster for a reasonable budget. Having said that, this is a studio budget, and excellent creature features such as Monster Man (Davis 2003), the Feast17 trilogy (Gulager 2005, 2008; Adam 2009) and Cloverfield (Matt Reeves 2008) require studio input and deep pockets. Gareth Edwards’s lone effort, Monsters (Edwards 2010) was made over some considerable time and its 250 CGI effects represented months of hard work. Once you are properly studio funded you get to make King Kong (Jackson 2005) or Prometheus (Scott 2012) but until then it’s best to conceive of something we can only glimpse for most of the movie. Better yet, there is the inner monster, which is cheaper to film.\n\nSee Appendix 2: Interviews (p. 202).\n\n17\n\n24\n\nWriting the Horror Movie\n\nPsychological horror Psychological horror is the creaking door, the eerie doll, the boarded-up house, the scraping behind the wall, the fleeting image. It is the sudden ring of the phone – a good scare. It is internalized, and so there is no room for gore; instead, there is tone and mood and mist and shadow. It is the horror we create with our own imagination. Psychological horror deals with the unknown in the shape of humanity itself and our struggle to come to terms with our own nature. The idea is to access our psyche, the bits of ourselves that we see in dreams, in nightmares, madness, visions or fits. Nearly all psychological thrillers deal in madness or consciousness gone awry. This requires a complexity of character, such as with killer Robert Rusk in Frenzy (Hitchcock 1972) or Carol LeDoux in Repulsion (Polanski 1965). This creates a real difficulty for film-makers. How do you show that which is the unknown? From the German expressionist cinema of the 1920s to the Asian horror of the 2000s, the aim has been to find a way to map the innermost workings of the (twisted) mind on screen. The reasoning of psychological horror is to question what a person really is in their mind, to establish order and to solve the puzzle. Often the story is framed in such a way that the protagonist/victim is paranoid and no one will believe her, throwing her into a position where she must defend her sanity and prove she is not seeing things – or, if she is, that she is right and there is something evil out to get her. The ultimate threat here is not death but madness. It is perpetual insanity, which is why many stories end with the protagonist bound in a straitjacket, pulling back to her mad cell and the insane cacophony of the other inmates. Carrie (De Palma 1976) was an excellent example of a shock ‘mad’ ending,18 and The Shining (Kubrick 1980) was a graphic illustration of the disintegration of sanity. Jack Torrance’s death is only a result of the inability to cope with the new conditions he finds himself in. He is still trying to impose order right up until the end, but his natural state is that of a murderer. The main conflict is between the conscious and the unconscious, between control and disorder. The danger is in our basic human drives, our repressed fears, phobias, urges and compulsions, shown best in films like Peeping Tom (Michael Powell 1960). This kind of movie debates the nature of humanity itself. What are we when stripped of community and forced to rely on our wit and instinct? Self-knowledge is the key to survival in these movies, in discovering your true nature – for better or worse. They can often be Freudian in essence,\n\nAlthough not for the protagonist, Carrie, but for the popular Sue Snell.\n\n18\n\nSubgenres\n\n25\n\nand you will see parents or parental figures everywhere: the love of, the memory of, the fear of and the abuse by. In a number of tales, the worst fear has already happened. The protagonist is unaware of this and the mystery that unfolds is for them to reach a point of catharsis, resolution and self-knowledge – but alas, too late. Some examples of movies that do this quite expertly (spoiler alert) are Carnival of Souls (Harvey 1962), The Sixth Sense (Shyamalan 1999), Dead of Night (Cavalcanti 1945) Dr. Terror’s House of Horrors (Francis 1965) and lately John Carpenter’s The Ward (Carpenter 2010). These tales all demand careful seeding and preparation so that the audience is not ahead of you. This was most effectively done in Haute tension (Aja 2003), though some found its extremes illogical (the blow job and severed head scene for one). The hero in a psychological horror movie has to have a strong logical objective. This means a strong plot, often with the most interesting ideas and characters. An obscure British picture starring Roger Moore, The Man Who Haunted Himself (Dearden 1970) is a marvellous example of a man drawn into a situation he cannot fathom, and is perhaps the former Bond actor’s finest role. Following a car accident, businessman Harold Pelham is operated on and briefly dies on the operating table. As he is brought back, two heartbeats appear on the monitor and, as he returns to daily life, he discovers that he has a doppelganger. This is Jekyll and Hyde once more, man and Monster, the duality of nature. Psychological horror explores this field, often splitting in two quite literally those things we call good and evil, the coexisting sides of our nature. Showing two as one, as in R. L. Stevenson’s tale, is such an enduring story that it has been remade many times: as two men in Fight Club (Fincher 1999); as woman and her alter ego in Haute tension (Aja 2003); and as a multiplicity in Identity (Cooney 2003). The vocabulary we use about these aspects of our humanity is in itself psychoanalytic. Terms like repression, bi-polar, OCD, ADD, obsession and multiple personality disorder are terms with which we have become familiar, but are themselves terms from clinical psychology. We have slowly adopted them since the days of Psycho (Hitchcock 1960).19 The term ‘serial killer’ has been attributed to FBI profiler Robert Ressler, who coined it during a lecture in 1974, but it has since been claimed that he was referring to ‘serial homicide’. Regardless of the actions of John Wayne Gacy, Ted Bundy and Aileen Wuornos it was the huge success of Silence of the Lambs\n\nIt is worth rewatching Psycho, stopping at the reveal of Mother’s corpse, and asking ‘Are the subsequent 10 minutes of psychological deconstruction really necessary?’ 19\n\n26\n\nWriting the Horror Movie\n\n(Demme 1991) that popularized the term, despite the stark Henry: Portrait of a Serial Killer (McNaughton 1986), a mordant and more realistic examination of the mind of a mundane multiple killer. Psycho begins as a robbery thriller with the over-arching question, ‘Will Marion succeed?’, but the central question later evolves to ‘Can Norman keep her murder a secret?’. We have in effect changed genres and protagonists. Hitchcock repeated the trick in Frenzy (Hitchcock 1972), where Rusk, the murderer, has to break the fingers of a dead woman’s body in a potato truck in order to retrieve a tie pin which she managed to grab from him in the heat of his attack. Hitchcock had to work hard to make this long scene effective, introducing black comedy in order to help us sympathize with the devil because we are wedded to genre and find it hard to change horses midstream. Nowadays, the concept of the antihero has become commonplace, and in drama we are ready to accept the convention of the redemptive journey of a Keitel, Travolta or Eastwood character. Before Psycho introduced us to the psychological aspect, movies were solely thrillers, policiers or detective stories. Killings were motivated by lust, revenge or greed, and the concept of the killer who kills as part of what he is was simply unknown. One possible exception, although considered a ‘noir’, is Fritz Lang’s M (Lang 1931) where the child killer played by Peter Lorre presents the case for his compulsion to a kangaroo court of locals. It is interesting to note that its central conceit of setting a thief to catch a thief later shows up in Silence of the Lambs (Demme 1991), which too is a horror/thriller blend.\n\nDemons, possession and child possession If God exists, then so too must the devil. If there is the concept of infinite wisdom and goodness beyond man’s understanding then, ’as above, so below’, there must be original sin and Hades, fire and brimstone, and endless suffering. If not, then the horror film with a religious (Judaeo-Christian) ethic will not affect you at all. The Exorcist (Friedkin 1973) was one of the all-time horror blockbusters and remains for most the ne plus ultra of horror movies. This and The Omen (Donner 1976) produced several sequels of variable quality and gave rise to The Exorcism of Emily Rose (Derrickson 2005) and The Last Exorcism (Stamm 2010), plus such underrated movies as Stigmata (Wainwright 1999).\n\nSubgenres\n\n27\n\nWhilst most Americans consider themselves to be Christian, Europe is more pantheistic, yet the origins of Catholicism go back a long way and the concepts of demons, rites and possessions are still rooted in deep belief. The Catholic Church in Rome has recently reinstated exorcisms after a relatively short period of denying the practice. The idea of the Black Mass (The Devil Rides Out: Fisher 1968) is an inversion of the Christian ‘White’ one, in that it has ritual, ceremony, incantation, a cross (inverted) and transubstantiation, substituting real blood as sacrifice instead of the symbolic wine, plus a summons for the (Dark) Lord to hear the prayer. It is transgression, pure and simple. In encountering demons, devils or possessions, there are usually three distinct stages, a kind of ‘close encounters’ of the evil kind. First there is contact, which may be in the form of a séance or the use of a Ouija board. In this, the idea is to contact the spirits for information or as proof of their existence. This does not preclude the idea of evil, but it is a relatively small physical manifestation. Next there is the summoning up of a demon, which is more serious. Here, we introduce the pentacle and the charmed circle out of which you must not step: also, a necronomicon or black bible of sorts – a spell, a tome or a lost scroll (usually in Aramaic) to contain the spell that will conjure up the dark forces. Now we are moving towards the gaining of power and the invocation of a demon to do our bidding: a golem, an evil spirit, an acolyte. Finally there is blood sacrifice, aiming to summon Satan, Baphomet, Mephistopheles, the Prince of Darkness, Old Nick, Belial, Shaitan, Leviathan, the Horned One, Beelzebub or the Antichrist. This, as in Hellraiser (Barker 1987), is when things have really gone a bit too far.20 Only someone mentally disturbed would believe that they could have any power over, or make any kind of contract with, the Great Beast – and movies in which the Devil is raised never end well for the pilgrim of evil. They do, however, attract big stars, and in the past the whiff of sulphur has been liberally spread about by Robert De Niro (Angel Heart: Alan Parker 1987), Al Pacino (Devil’s Advocate: Taylor Hackford 1997) and Jack Nicholson (The Witches of Eastwick: Miller 1987) as they madly chewed the scenery. It is better to focus on possession, ideally that of a young child by an evil spirit. The fear here is a transgression of the idea of innocence combined with that of childhood disease. That your child is not really your child but a destructive foreign agent is a dread all parents will know, and the idea your offspring is simply evil is one that will occur on more than one sleepless night. It takes four years to socialize a child and to inculcate in them an understanding of right and wrong, and most of childhood is a battle to tame their feral natures. The concept\n\nA New-Age version of this, Tears of Kali (Marschall 2004) is well worth a look.\n\n20\n\n28\n\nWriting the Horror Movie\n\nof any kind of pristine ‘childhood’ is a recent invention and the horror of the ‘evil’ child is one that recurs often. Possessed children in the movies began in earnest with Village of the Damned (Rilla 1960) an adaptation of John Wyndham’s 1957 novel The Midwich Cuckoos, in which all the inhabitants of the English village of Midwich, and anyone in a five-mile radius, suddenly fall unconscious. This is not explained (aliens are hinted at), but two months later all the women are pregnant, later giving birth on the same day to blonde haired, pale skinned children. It transpires that a similar thing has happened in other countries (Russia, Canada and Australia) but that the children died or were murdered by their parents. The kids grow at an alarming rate, and by the age of seven they are impeccably polite but show no sign of conscience or love. They develop a group mind and psychic powers that can halt those who try to stop them. The movie was followed by the equally superb Children of the Damned (Leader 1963) and a lesser remake by Wes Craven in 1995 (Village of the Damned: Craven, 1995). Stephen King’s 1977 short story, Children of the Corn (published in Night Shift magazine in 1977), also became a movie (Kiersh 1984) – an homage to the same idea. Another superb early example of the evil child is The Bad Seed (LeRoy 1956), based on a 1954 novel by William March and a play written by Maxwell Anderson and performed in 1955 – in which prim and proper little girl Rhoda Penmark is suspected of drowning her classmate Claude over a penmanship medal. She later admits this to her mother Christine, and also to the killing of a neighbour. It is revealed that Christine is the daughter of serial killer Bessie Denker and was adopted at the age of two. Rhoda’s killing spree continues, and her mother attempts to cover up her daughter’s activities, before finally trying to kill her and then commit suicide. After the credits roll, the cast is introduced in theatrical style, and Christine administers an old fashioned spanking to the child (the Hays Code would not permit crime to pay). Naughty possessed child! Bad girl. The greatest story of child possession is The Exorcist (Friedkin 1973). The film was adapted from the 1971 novel by William Peter Blatty, a mythic story of a man trying to regain his faith with terrible consequences, wrapped around the demonic possession of Regan McNeil. It was based on a true event. The 1949 Mt Rainer exorcism case was that of a 14-year-of boy who experimented with a Ouija Board and apparently become possessed by the devil, later being ‘successfully’ exorcized by Catholic priests after several failed attempts. Blatty approached one of the exorcists, Father John Bowdern, who agreed to help him research a novel based on the events with the condition that he change the possessed child to a girl to protect the family. He later showed a draft to his neighbour Shirley Maclaine, who had appeared in another possession film, The Possession of Joel Delaney (Hussein 1972). Maclaine passed it to movie mogul\n\nSubgenres\n\n29\n\nLew Grade, but his offer was not accepted. Warner Bros eventually picked it up and many directors were considered before they settled on William Friedkin, whom Blatty favoured. The script of The Exorcist was heavily re-written, with Blatty as producer, and the year-long shoot was plagued with problems and rumours of priests being on set to bless the participants – a sort of holy Health and Safety. Warner Bros did not preview the film, afraid of causing offence, opening it at 30 cinemas where it played for six months. It became a huge blockbuster, with hysterical reactions from audience members having heart attacks and miscarriages, and ushers using cat litter to clear up the (presumably pea-green) vomit. The Catholic Church was besieged with requests for exorcisms and, rather than declare the film blasphemous, the Catholic Times saw it as profoundly spiritual. The Exorcist played in some cinemas for two years after its release. The Exorcist was re-released on its 25th anniversary in Britain, having been finally granted a certificate by the BBFC, containing excised footage including the famous ‘spider walk’. There has been much talk about subliminal imagery in The Exorcist. Friedkin himself has stated that it is ‘not subliminal because you can see it’. The Demon’s face is visible in two single frames, one during Regan’s medical examination and one where his mother is in the kitchen. The image was apparently part of the testing for the dummy to be used for the revolving head sequence. Linda Blair’s body double, Eileen Dietz, was being tested for make-up and this image was superimposed on the dummy. It is an incredibly effective scare, and that’s saying something in a film stuffed full of relentlessly shocking imagery. It entirely unsettles you after flashing momentarily in your peripheral vision. Using stark single frames like this has, to our knowledge, only been done twice since: once, visible in trees flashing past as the couple speed towards their cabin in Lars von Trier’s Antichrist (Von Trier 2009); again in Devil (Dowdle 2010), an amusing tale by M. Night Shyamalan of the Devil trapping five people in an elevator: the image is glimpsed on CCTV cameras by a guard. The Exorcist employs disgust, rather than shock, especially disgust at the body (‘Help me’, written on Regan’s torso), making it a precursor to Body Horror and the work of David Cronenberg (see p. 35). Its legacy is huge, and the movie has left a long shadow. The Orphan (Collet-Serra 2009) is a notable attempt (‘There is something wrong with Esther’) but it has a twist that negates the ‘child possession’ conceit. Insidious (Wan 2011), written by ‘Saw’ creators Leigh Wannell and James Wan, concerns a couple whose son becomes a vessel for ghosts, and is an ‘Exorcist style’ horror with a refreshing twist. There is also The Last Exorcism (Stamm 2010), which again explores brilliantly the idea of a man losing his religion. In this, Cotton Marcus, a disillusioned\n\n30\n\nWriting the Horror Movie\n\nevangelical minister bent on exposing fraudulent exorcisms, gets more than he bargained for. There are many readings of The Exorcist, including ones that claim it to be a misogynistic, homosexual fantasy of the repression of a young girl into a state of virginal innocence. It is very much about puberty, and Regan is certainly surrounded by torturing men. The Evil is explicitly sexual –masturbation with a cross, blasphemy and profanity, and so on – but, all in all, in terms of his power the Devil is a bit lame. The film is no more and no less than that old saw – the threat of female sexuality. The Exorcist dispenses with any ambiguity, returning it to a medieval Judeo Christian view of women and in the process inadvertently exploring the idea that the control of woman’s bodies is one of organized religions central concerns. James Marriott, Virgin Book of Horror Films\n\nThe supernatural: ghosts, hauntings, poltergeists Ghosts do not exist. Despite this, they hold an enduring popularity in horror and in our imaginations, easily adaptable to comedy, romance, comic books and to Disney in equal measure. From the white-sheeted Scooby Doo ghost to the long-hared wet women of Japanese Horror, they remain a staple of the movies, and long may this continue. A ghost, apparition, spectre or spook cannot physically harm you. It may shock you so hard that you suffer a heart attack or fall out of a window, but ghosts are the souls or spirits of the dead. They are ethereal beings who are felt more than they appear, often only present in groans, scratches and creaking doors. If seen, they are apparitions, a mist, a blurred shape or an afterimage. The writer of ghost stories must modulate unease and dread throughout the main part of the tale, only bringing horror as a stark result. The masters of this art were Edgar Allen Poe, H. P. Lovecraft, M. R James,21 Sheridan LeFanu and Henry James – the gothic tradition being the culturally acceptable face of horror. A ghost will try to drive you out of your mind, and madness is the result of many of these ghost stories, a particularly superb example being M. R James’s Oh Whistle and I’ll Come\n\nThe BBC/BFI box set of M. R. James’s Ghost Stores for Christmas is indispensable.\n\n21\n\nSubgenres\n\n31\n\nto You, My Lad.22 This in turn may drive you to suicide and to becoming a ghost yourself. Ghostly powers extend to haunting and turning up where you least expect it – in mirrors, in water, or right behind you. A ghost defies natural laws, floating, walking through walls and shape shifting. Like cats, they are deemed to have a territory, either bounded by the person whom they are haunting or the place where they died and where their tormented soul resides and craves release (The Changeling: Medak 1980). There are two opposing views that co-exist here. Although there have been many horror stories and movies in which the spirit haunts a place – for example The Innocents (Clayton 1961), The Canterville Ghost (Jules Dassin and Norman Z. McLeod 1944), The House on Haunted Hill (Castle,1959), The Amityville Horror (Stuart Rosenberg 1979; Andrew Douglas, 2005) and Poltergeist (Hooper 1982) – there are just as many in which it is the person being haunted. Ghosts in movies before 1940 used to have a similar function to that of the devil: to provide light relief. The first serious US ghost film was The Uninvited (Guard and Guard 1944) in which a brother (Ray Milland) and sister stay in a haunted house in Cornwall. They are a very British thing, ghosts, what with Britain’s long history of spooky old houses and Bloody Towers. American ghostly horror tends towards Southern Gothic settings in antebellum houses, or the old states of Massachusetts and also New England. Ghosts from California or Nevada are something of a struggle. In The Haunting (Wise 1963), Eleanor Lance is a spinster who is escaping from her claustrophobic family and is plagued by telekinetic powers. As with Carrie (De Palma 1976) and The Shining (Kubrick 1980), the real question is, is she the target of the haunting or its source? Are the other people in the house creations of Eleanor’s mind? It is made clear that the house wants her. It wants her to be absorbed by its evil. It is a living thing. This movie has subjective angles making us feel as though we are with the thing that is spiralling down from its rooftops. There are numerous mismatched shots, door handles, silver reflections and oddly placed mirrors that disrupt the space. Dr Markway, the suave psychic investigator in charge, explains that all the angles are wrong; the doors either won’t close or they spring open by themselves, it is all disoriented, with tight spaces and full of heavy cluttered Edwardian furniture. It is fractured, like Eleanor’s mind. The multiple mirrors are saying ‘Look at yourself, can’t you see?’ The most frightening thing for Eleanor is Eleanor. Admittedly she is a neurotic, making it hard to identify with her, but her use of the guilt-ridden voiceover is straight out of Psycho (Hitchcock 1960).\n\nFrom Ghost stories of an Antiquary, 1904.\n\n22\n\n32\n\nWriting the Horror Movie\n\nGhosts are manifestations of unresolved issues. We cannot see them because they are part of the ‘doubling’ process of horror. It is no accident that many hauntings and ghost sightings have female or young protagonists, as it is generally held that women and the young are more in tune with their psyche. There is nothing as spooky as the child who ‘sees’ what we cannot. Unlike much modern-day horror, which can be nihilistic and feral, ghosts promote the idea that there is something beyond the veil, a world greater than our own, containing knowledge untapped and powers beyond time and space, the price of admission being your sanity or physical form. In a sense, this is redemptive. Ghosts can be seen as offering hope, as do the lies propagated by major religions. The way to be in contact with a spirit, if one has not contacted you already, is to conduct a séance or use a Ouija board. The latter is the horror equivalent of opening Pandora’s Box, and is incredibly dumb, as is proven by numerous movies such as 13 Ghosts (Castle 1960), Witchboard (Tenney 1986), What Lies Beneath (Zemeckis 2000), Long Time Dead (Adams, 2002) and Paranormal Activity (Peli 2007). The Ouija board itself was made commercial by businessman Elijah Bond in 1890 and was regarded as a harmless parlour game until spiritualist Pearl Curran used it as a divining tool in World War I. It is of course, as we now know, a tool of Satan. The séance is a way of receiving hidden (plot) information, but in actuality it is more often than not fraudulent. Nevertheless, séances do make for effectively spooky scenes, especially if they result in releasing unwanted spirits or form part of a magic ritual, as in The Devil Rides Out (Fisher 1968) or The Ninth Gate (Polanski 1999), or as in Insidious (Wan 2010) when they have the psychic wear a gas mask. Poltergeists are angry (the word means ‘noisy ghost’), moving your keys and furniture and, once things get out of hand, throwing the kitchen everywhere. Again, these troublesome spirits tend to haunt a person rather than a place. Japanese culture and movies are full of restless spirits23 who have died violently, missing the ceremony that would have reunited them with their ancestors. Drawing on folk tales, kabuki and Noh theatre, the most popular figure is the vengeful female ghost, related to mythic hannya (female demons), which we see in Ringu (Hideo Nakata 1998), Ju-on (DVD, Shimizu 2000), The Grudge (Shimizu 2004) and Dark Water (Nakata 2002).\n\n‘Obake’ for ghost, meaning to undergo change, ‘Yojai’, a bewitching apparition, ‘Yurei’, faint spirit, and ‘Oni’, demon or ogre. 23\n\nSubgenres\n\n33\n\nWitchcraft The devil has had quite a part to play in the history of cinema from Georges Melies’s early experiments, Paul Wegener’s version of Poe’s Student of Prague (Rye and Wegener 1913) to F. W. Murnau’s Faust (1926). In The Black Cat (Ulmer,1934), Boris Karloff played a high priest of a satanic cult, and later Val Lewton produced The Seventh Victim (Robson 1943), which set the template for modern-day devil worshippers who try to convert the sceptic. Jacques Tourneur’s excellent Night of the Demon (Tourneur 1957) invoked a real-life character familiar to anyone interested in the Black Arts, namely Aleister Crowley, known as ‘The Great Beast’ (1875–1947). No work on Satanism or witchcraft is complete without some reference to him. Born in 1875 and the son of a wealthy brewer, Crowley became an influential member of a magical society, the Hermetic order of the Golden Dawn. He was a poet, artist, mountaineer and drug abuser. He was later contacted by a ‘Holy Guardian Angel’ on his travels in Egypt, who dictated to him The Book of the Law – within it the motto ‘Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law’ – a call to arms for libertarians everywhere, taken up once again with enthusiasm in the 1960s when he attained posthumous cult status. Crowley founded his own philosophy and occult society, the OTO (Ordi Templo Orientis), which was pansexual and involved heavy drug use. He became widely notorious in his lifetime, becoming known as the ‘Wickedest Man in the World’ and even fighting a libel case over a 1932 book that named him as a black magician (he lost). The judge. Mr Justice Swift, said ‘I have never heard such dreadful, horrible, blasphemous and abominable stuff as that which has been produced by the man [Crowley]’. Towards the end of his life he sold ‘Dr. Crowley’s elixir of life pills’, which contained a mixture of chalk and, to quote Dr Pretorious in Bride of Frankenstein, ’he made them from seed’. Crowley has been hugely influential, inspiring Somerset Maugham’s character The Magician, Le Chiffre in Ian Fleming’s ‘Casino Royale’, and John Fowles’s The Magus in literature. In film, Night of the Demon (Tourneur 1957) has him as Karswell, and in The Devil Rides Out (Fisher 1968), from the novel by Denis Wheatley, he is Mocato. In Rosemary’s Baby (Polanski 1968) he appears as Adrian Marcato. His most recent appearance was in A Chemical Wedding (Doyle 2009), written by Bruce Dickinson of Heavy Metal band Judas Priest. He is your go-to guy for black magic. In witchcraft movies, the central tenet is the acceptance that white and black magic exists, and the onus is on the protagonist to accept this. Thus, in Night of\n\n34\n\nWriting the Horror Movie\n\nthe Demon, sceptical Dr John Holden is in London to attend a convention where the late Mr Harrington intended to expose a cult. On meeting Karswell, the first thing the two do is to mock one another’s beliefs. In Night of the Eagle (Hayers 1961), it is an academic’s wife who uses witchcraft to further her husband’s career – an idea reversed in Rosemary’s Baby (Polanski 1968) where Guy Woodhouse allows a satanic cult to use his spouse as a vessel in order to further his acting career. Rosemary’s Baby was a huge success, grossing over $30 million and making it one of horror’s first blockbusters. Copulation with the devil is strong stuff, but the story is presented in such a way that it might all simply be Rosemary’s changing mental state during pregnancy. The potions given to her are the most obvious witchcraft aspect of the movie, but it avoids any ritualistic spells, and we are not party to the Faustian pact made by Guy. In the late 1960s, interest in devilry and witchcraft was growing. The Rolling Stones had released their album ‘Satanic Majesty’s Request’ and there was an interest in the occult and the esoteric. Roman Polanski had read Professor R. L. Gregory’s ‘Eye and Brain, The Psychology of Seeing’, which stated that we see less than we think and that our perception of reality is filled in by false memories. An agnostic, Polanski stated in his 1984 autobiography that ‘the entire story, seen through [Rosemary’s] eyes, could have been a chain of only superficially sinister coincidences, a product of feverish fantasies’ – shades here of Ebenezer Scrooge’s denial of the spirits.24 Many audience members were convinced they saw cloven hooves and the baby’s face at the reveal, when all you can actually see (superimposed) in the final frames are two slightly feline eyes. Witchfinder General (Reeves 1968) was more about the hunting and burning of witches as sadistic ritual, and Ken Russell’s masterpiece The Devils (1970) was a political piece concerning trumped-up charges against a priest rather than a witch. Robin Hardy’s Wicker Man (1973) is the best British folk horror bar none about paganism, and is a marvellous reversal of Judaeo-Christian beliefs. Please ignore any sequels and remakes.25 The Witches of Eastwick (Miller 1987), based on a John Updike novel, concerns three women abandoned by their husbands who do not realize they are witches. They form a coven and accidentally summon up the Devil (in the form of Jack Nicholson). The movie was played for laughs with few horror ingredients bar mild disgust and should not trouble us further. The Craft (Andrew Fleming 1996) has a coven of three female teenagers who, discovering that a fourth member propagates greater powers, cast spells on their classmates and on each other. Again the Wiccan rites get out of hand as bad girl Nancy leads In Charles Dickens, A Christmas Carol (1843). Blood on Satan’s Claw (Haggard 1970) is also recommended.\n\n24 25\n\nSubgenres\n\n35\n\nthem astray. Eventually they turn on her and protagonist Sarah invokes a ’higher power’ which nullifies Nancy (she ends up being committed) and removes the others’ powers. This seems to be more about teenage socialization than true witchcraft, with a message that implies it’s OK to be different – but not that different. That they were all bullied or abused outsiders is interesting, but the revenge motive could have been darker, with perhaps a bit more ‘witch’ fulfilment. Witches as adjuncts of Satan or cults were popular in the 1960s Hammer Horror offerings, whereas the portrayal of modern-day witches in movies does not rely on a male mentor. With the rise of feminism we might have expected more movies about witches, but perhaps this is too obvious. Ira Levin’s great work, The Stepford Wives (Forbes 1975), said a great deal about women’s supposed place in society (as automata). There are plenty of countries today that still have a medieval attitude towards women and it may be to them that we look for a new stories. In terms of period horror, other than the previously mentioned Witchfinder General (Reeves 1968) there has been little made about the great European purge of women. In America there is the story of the Salem Witch hunts, written for the stage as The Crucible by Arthur Miller (1953) and filmed in 1957 (Rouleau 195726) and then in 1996 (Hytner 1996), but little since.\n\nWerewolves and Body Horror The transformation of the human body is one of horror’s basic template ideas, beginning with R. L. Stevenson’s novella, The Strange case of Doctor Jekyll and Mr. Hyde (1886). The inner wolf outwardly projected is a being of sexual repression. In Waggner’s Wolf Man (Waggner 1941) he is a projection of Larry Talbot’s sexual frustration in his relationship. Irena’s fear of transformation in Cat People (Tourneur 1942) is manifested in numerous images of cats. The Company of Wolves (Jordan 1984) and the excellent Ginger Snaps trilogy (Fawcett 2000; Harvey 2004; Sullivan 2004) are metaphors for the onset of female puberty. In the 1970s and 1980s, transformation scenes came to the fore, partly due to advances in prosthetics and robotics, which allowed Rob Bottin and Rick Baker to produce their best work (The Howling: Joe Dante 1981). Once we arrive at Carpenter’s The Thing (Carpenter 1982), in which the beast can transform into anything, all bets are off. One director who has consistently explored the vulnerability of the human body is director David Cronenberg, whose early movies Shivers (Cronenberg\n\nWritten by Arthur Miller and Jean-Paul Sartre.\n\n26\n\n36\n\nWriting the Horror Movie\n\n1975), Rabid (Cronenberg 1976) and The Brood (Cronenberg 1979) concern its transformation at the hands of science, as well as telepathy, sexual disease and mutation. Cronenberg is known as the ‘King of venereal horror’ or the ‘Canadian prince of body horror’. He has developed a new form of cinema, both visceral and literate, adapting works by beat writer William Burroughs (Naked Lunch: 1991, from the 1959 novel) and SF master J. G. Ballard (Crash: 1996, from the 1973 novel) into a new aesthetic of the body. Cronenberg’s early films were prophetic. Shivers anticipated AIDS, while Videodrome (1983) foresaw the cheapening imagery of the then emerging satellite TV. He studied biochemistry in Toronto, but switched to English Literature and wrote SF stories. His breakthrough film was Scanners (1981), which concerned a corrupted technological future. Cronenberg manipulates disgust with great skill, not merely for pure gross-out. On referring to these excesses, such as the woman with the external womb in The Brood, or the man with a vaginal slit in his stomach in Videodrome, he states: It’s fascination but also a willingness to look at what is really there without flinching, and to say that this is what we are made of, as strange and as disgusting as it may seem sometimes.27 One of Cronenberg’s most often quoted lines is given to Eliot, one of twin gynaecologists in the movie Dead Ringers: ’I’ve often thought that there should be beauty contests for the insides of bodies – you know, best spleen, most perfectly developed kidneys’. He has since moved away from genre movies, but his unique sensibility marks him out as an iconoclastic writer/ director.\n\nBad science Oh, in the name of God! Now I know what it feels like to be God! (Frankenstein James Whale 1931)\n\nWith this line from Universal’s 1931 classic, Frankenstein played out the fear of a generation. There has always been fear of change. The Industrial Revolution in Britain was accompanied by the Luddite movement which smashed the looms in the cotton factories – seeing the advance as a way of making them redundant. Early surgery was kill-or-cure, with Victorian doctors competing over\n\nQuoted in Marriott 2004.\n\n27\n\nSubgenres\n\n37\n\nhow fast they might remove a limb. World War I brought the mechanization of death in vast numbers: it was scientists who created the mustard gas that slaughtered so many; and then, later, the poisons used in World War II extermination camps. It was science that brought us the atom bomb, but also nuclear fission – energy to power the world. It was the use of the atom bomb in 1944 that irrevocably changed the perception of science, which was subsequently reflected in Science Fiction/Horror crossover movies of the 1950s. Never again could a scientist be entirely trustworthy; they often worked at some sinister plant or were in the pockets of some shady covert government department. Once the iconography of Frankenstein bedded in, there came several variations on the mad doctor theme, including Dr Richard Marlow (played by Bela Lugosi), who used black magic and the souls of kidnapped girls to revitalize his dead wife (Voodoo Man: Hook 1944), Dr Peter Blood, who exhumed corpses and put living hearts in them to bring them back to life (Dr. Blood’s Coffin: Sidney J. Furie 1961) and plastic surgeon Dr Genessier, who disfigured his daughter as a result of his reckless driving then experimented with facial skin grafts that failed to take (Eyes without a Face [Les Yeux Sans Visages]: Franju 1960) – masterfully updated as The Skin I live In [Le Piel que Habito] (Almodóvar 2011). The 1980s heralded a proliferation of media, pornography, advertising, video and cable TV (later, satellite and YouTube). An idealized vision of the human body was formed. Critic Naomi Wolf called this the ‘Beauty Myth’.28 This impossible state, she claimed, could not be created without the intervention of plastic surgery or liposuction. The idea of gender transformation also grew, and both are features of Cronenberg’s work, which starts to look eerily prescient. The obverse to the rise of the Photoshopped, airbrushed ‘ideal’ is the explosion in body modifications, tattoos, piercings and scarification, in a revolt against the idea of the perfect body. Cronenberg reverses received ideas. A plaque on the doctor’s wall in Shivers (Cronenberg 1975) states that ‘Sex is the invention of a clever venereal disease’. Seth Brundle in The Fly (Cronenberg 1986) sees himself as having being struck by ‘a disease with a purpose’. The Fly was Cronenberg’s most commercially successful film. This remake introduced a strong love interest, incredible prosthetics and tragic transformations. Brundle begins as a classic mad scientist with sets of identical clothes in his wardrobe so that he does not have to think about what to wear (Einstein did the same). Sanity, or at least logical reasoning, deserts him early on, as the matter transporters prove effective. In the original version (The Fly: Kurt Neumann 1958) scientist Andre Delambre pointed out its benefits: ‘humanity need never want or fear again’;\n\nNaomi Wolf, The Beauty Myth. New York: William Morrow and Company, 1991.\n\n28\n\n38\n\nWriting the Horror Movie\n\nbut Brundle’s interest is to put a woman through the transporter – perhaps chiming with Cronenberg’s ideas, as in VideoDrome, of combining the sexes. The transformation is an ageing process, a love affair burning through its stages toward tragedy with Brundle’s penis pickled in a jar and partner Veronica growing increasingly disillusioned. Finally, she needs rescuing from Brundlefly, who revolts against her ex-boyfriend by dissolving his arm and ankle in acidic fly vomit. The transformation is complete and, having nowhere to ascend to or descend from the human–insect mutation, Brundlefly merges with the Telepod itself. The resultant pathetic creature begs only for release. This man–machine interface anticipates Cronenberg’s later work with Ballard’s Crash (Cronenberg 1996) and was influential in Shin’ya Tsukamoto’s Tetsuo (Tsukamoto 1989) and Tetsuo II: Bodyhammer (Tsukamoto 1992). Bad science is here to stay. From disasters like Bhopal, nuclear disasters like Chernobyl (Chernobyl Diaries: Parker 2012) or the nuclear accident at Three Mile Island,29 there has been a continual leak of science related fears. The effect of the SARS epidemic in Hong Kong in 2002, which nearly caused a pandemic, can directly be seen in Steven Soderbergh’s Contagion (Soderbergh 2011). The colourless, odourless chemical weapon, Sarin gas, to which were exposed 5,000 Japanese commuters in 1995, changed a nation. It is a common plot device now that ‘wonder’ drugs curing cancer are routinely kept from us by pharmaceutical corporations waiting until the price is right. Scientists are all too aware that research funding can be removed and tenure threatened unless the research is deemed ‘sexy’. In 28 Days Later (Boyle 2002) the Rage virus has been farmed and tested on animals and takes a heartbeat to turn anyone infected into a feral blood lusting zombie. This can only have been developed as a chemical weapon, as what other function could it possibly serve? A new playground for experimental chemical weaponry was found in the Middle Eastern countries during the last decade, and movies are starting to give nod to these ramifications. As technology becomes nanotechnology, cybernetics become more sophisticated, gender is blurred by surgery and medicine continues to eradicate disease, we are never short of a mad scientist or three.
