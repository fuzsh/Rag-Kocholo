        "text": "Our experts have curated an ‘80s horror movie starter list with 15 classics to watch now—and dozens more to screen later.\n\nBy Randy Harward\n\nSep 29, 2023 | Share\n\nIf you’re new to ‘80s horror movies, you’re in for a treat. They’re some of the scariest scary films ever—and a whole lotta fun.\n\nSome of us had the luxury of watching these movies in theaters, renting stacks of them on VHS (thanks, Mom!), or—if the ‘rents weren’t supportive of our interests—sneak-watching them on cable TV. Nowadays, we can stream ‘80s horror movies in even greater quantities, so it’s a great time to get into them.\n\nWe’ve compiled a list of 15 classic ‘80s horror movies to get you started. Each recommended film has auto-updating JustWatch links telling you which streaming services have them available to stream, rent, or buy. Also, since we’re confident you’ll love ‘80s horror movies, we’re including dozens more recommendations for further viewing.\n\nFind more streaming horror\n\nCheck out our reviews of horror streaming services like Shudder, Full Moon Features, Screambox, and Arrow Player, which have tons of ‘80s horror movies.\n\nBest ’80s horror movies\n\nJump to:\n\nThe Shining (1980)\n\nThe Evil Dead (1981)\n\nFriday the 13th (1980)\n\nAn American Werewolf in London (1981)\n\nCreepshow (1982)\n\nPoltergeist (1982)\n\nThe Thing (1982)\n\nA Nightmare on Elm Street (1984)\n\n1. The Shining (1980)\n\n(Video screenshot from YouTube)\n\nStanley Kubrick’s film ain’t exactly what Stephen King had in mind for a film adaptation of his 1977 novel. That notwithstanding, The Shining is a stone-cold chiller and a horror classic thanks to King’s story, the cast’s brilliant performances, the fantastic cinematography, an excellent score, and even some of Kubrick’s artistic choices.\n\nAnd let’s shout out to the late, great Scatman Crothers—voice of the great Hong Kong Phooey (among other things). He played the Overlook Hotel’s head chef—and Danny Torrance’s (Danny Lloyd) “shining” guide—Dick Halloran.\n\n2. Friday the 13th (1980)\n\n(Video screenshot from YouTube)\n\nThis franchise is largely responsible for the ‘80s being the best decade for slasher films. Friday the 13th led to 10 sequels, a remake, an upcoming Peacock TV series (Crystal Lake), so much merch, so many copycat films, and one of the most iconic masked killers in horror history: Jason Voorhees.\n\nFans and critics alike point to Friday the 13th: The Final Chapter (1984) as the best film in the series, followed by the first two Friday films. They’re correct—but part of the reason is Jason’s evolution, which begins in Friday the 13th (wink to the fans who know exactly when) and develops over the next two films, one of which kinda sucks but is worth seeing, anyway.\n\nPro tip: If you’re up for a marathon, check out How to Watch the Friday the 13th Movies in Order and How to Watch the Evil Dead Movies in Order.\n\n3. The Evil Dead (1981)\n\n(Video screenshot from YouTube)\n\nMany ‘80s horror movie lists skip over the first film in Sam Raimi’s now-classic Evil Dead series and go straight to Evil Dead 2 (1987). Is ED2 a better movie? Sure. It also incorporates some of the original script, so some people suggest skipping straight to the second film. Don’t.\n\nWhat Raimi and crew accomplished with The Evil Dead despite their limited resources might seem cheap and dated now, but The Evil Dead is still one of the scariest films we’ve ever seen. Don’t deprive yourselves of one of horror fandom’s great pleasures. Besides, Evil Dead 2 isn’t that similar to its predecessor.\n\n4. An American Werewolf in London (1981)\n\n(Video screenshot from YouTube)\n\nJohn Landis’ 1981 horror-comedy tops pretty much every list of “best werewolf movies” for a litany of reasons. It’s genuinely frightening, and it finds its scares in more than werewolf carnage. The charming main characters get you invested in their plights, heightening the terror, horror, and even grief. And the jokes work—not only because they’re hilarious, but also because they relieve tension, setting up big scares.\n\nThe film’s legendary, award-winning special effects include Rick Baker’s masterful, disturbing transformation scene (soundtracked by an on-the-snout song choice that we won’t spoil for you). Also, look for cameos by Muppet man Frank Oz and the late Rik Mayall (The Young Ones, Drop Dead Fred).\n\n5. Creepshow (1982)\n\n(Video screenshot from YouTube)\n\nCreepshow is a horror anthology written by esteemed horror author Stephen King, directed by venerated horror auteur George A. Romeo (Night of the Living Dead), and made to look like a horror comic.\n\nThat should be enough info to get most horror fans drooling, but here’s a bit more: The film has five stories—six with the wraparound tale—covering family drama, zombies, astro-botanical body horror (starring King himself), ancient cryptids, and cockroaches. Each tale is uniquely terrifying and witty. Along with the well-executed horror-comic gimmick, Creepshow lives up to its claim you’ll have “The most fun you’ll ever have being scared.”\n\nPro tip: Creepshow 2 (1987) isn’t as fun as the first film, but it has three super spooky Stephen King stories and is totally worth a watch. Creepshow 3 (2005) is terrible—skip it. And the four-seasons-deep Creepshow TV series (2019) on Shudder kicks booty.\n\n6. Poltergeist (1982)\n\n(Video screenshot from YouTube)\n\nAfter following The Texas Chain Saw Massacre (1974) with a killer croc flick (Eaten Alive, 1976) and a slasher movie (The Funhouse, 1981), Tobe Hooper went PG with Poltergeist—and scored another classic.\n\nAs ghost stories go, the ‘we-built-on-sacred-land-and-the-spirits-are-pissed’ story is pretty basic—but Poltergeist isn’t. It drops you into a happy family’s life just as they’ve moved into a fabulous new home, which should be one of the happiest times of their lives. And then everything goes kablooey in ways that even modern, R-rated supernatural horror films can’t achieve.\n\nPro tip: Read our guides for more family-friendly horror movie recommendations: Scary Movies for Kids and New and Upcoming PG-13 Horror Movies for Kids.\n\n7. The Thing (1982)\n\n(Video screenshot from YouTube)\n\nJohn Carpenter (Halloween) directed this second—and most faithful—adaptation of John W. Campbell’s 1938 sci-fi horror story Who Goes There?\n\nThe Thing appears on many “best horror movie” and “scariest movie” lists because it’s claustrophobic, intense, paranoia-inducing, and seriously gross. Excellent performances from a cast featuring Kurt Russell, Keith David, and Wilford “Diabetus” Brimley probably help, too.\n\nBut get this: Critics hated The Thing, and it performed poorly in theaters—but it finally caught on, achieving its cult status through home video.\n\n8. A Nightmare on Elm Street (1984)\n\n(Video screenshot from YouTube)\n\nWhen Wes Craven dropped this film in 1984, we were still trying to wrap our heads around slashers like Michael Myers (Halloween) and Jason Voorhees (Friday the 13th) who wouldn’t stay dead. Then came Freddy Krueger. Already dead, Freddy was a child murderer who could crash our dreams and cut us up with his DIY claws.\n\nIf you, like me, were young when A Nightmare on Elm Street came out, this was a special kind of scary—especially since we couldn’t get that haunting “1, 2, Freddy’s comin’ for you” nursery rhyme out of our heads. But you don’t have to be a kid to enjoy Freddy’s kicks. Nearly 40 years after its release, Elm Street still haunts anyone who watches it.\n\nPro tip: Check out How to Watch the A Nightmare on Elm Street Movies in Order, which tells you where to stream, rent, or buy all nine films in the franchise (and more).\n\n9. The Return of the Living Dead (1985)\n\n(Video screenshot from YouTube)\n\nDan O’Bannon’s The Return of the Living Dead has a whole different vibe than other zombie movies. I mean, it has all the traits and tropes, but the zombies move faster, which cranks up the terror. The zoms also speak, looking you in the eye and moaning lustily about “BRAINS, BRAINS, BRAAAAAAIIIIINS!” It’s seriously creepy. And when they catch somebody, they bite through skulls like M&M shells. Eeewwww. Eeeeewwwww.\n\nFortunately, ROTLD has a silly streak, a kickass horror-punk soundtrack, and a topless Linnea Quigley zombie to temper the terror, making the film a helluva good time.\n\n10. The Fly (1986)\n\n(Video screenshot from YouTube)\n\nWhen the original The Fly came out in 1958, the idea of a man and a housefly merging into one creature was sufficiently terrifying to 1958 audiences. By 1986, audiences needed something extra to activate their spook centers.\n\nEnter David Cronenberg. The body-horror auteur’s knack for the disturbing and disgusting—plus standout performances from Jeff Goldblum and Geena Davis—was just what the doctor ordered, ensuring this updated The Fly would remain scary long past the mid-1980s.\n\n11. The Lost Boys (1987)\n\n(Video screenshot from YouTube)\n\nJoel Schumacher’s vampiric take on Peter Pan is sexy, stylish, scary, and totally about arrested male development—but Peter Pan’s populartiy proves all genders relate to not wanting to grow up.\n\nIt helps, too, that The Lost Boys is stacked with hotness (what’s up, Dianne Wiest?), set in a Califonia beach town, and has a kickass soundtrack, motorcycle night rides, two Coreys (Haim, Feldman), one Kiefer (Sutherland), and that scene of swole saxman sex-ifying a Christian rock classic.\n\nBest. Summer. Ever. As long as you don’t die (permanently).\n\n12. Hellraiser (1987)\n\n(Video screenshot from YouTube)\n\nClive Barker’s film, based on his novella The Hellbound Heart (1986), has (as head Cenobite Pinhead says) “such sights to show you.”\n\nI mean, what’s scarier than solving an ornate Rubik’s Cube and, instead of basking in clout, suddenly finding yourself deep into an acupuncture session you don’t recall making—then you get pulled apart like a quesadilla?\n\nThat’s undoubtedly an oversimplified description of this wickedly creative story about Hell and demons. But if that’s the kind of horror that keeps you up at night, you won’t sleep much after watching Hellraiser.\n\n13. Child’s Play (1988)\n\n(Video screenshot from YouTube)\n\nI wish everyone could’ve seen Child’s Play in the ‘80s, when the toddler-sized, freckle-faced, overalls-wearing My Buddy doll was a popular toy. You know, like the Good Guy doll that serial killer Charles Lee Ray, aka Chucky, inhabits in this movie.\n\nStabby talking dolls are still scary—we know this because the Chucky TV series is about to start filming its third season. So whether or not you had a My Buddy doll as a kid, Child’s Play will get you good.\n\n14. They Live (1988)\n\n(Video screenshot from YouTube)\n\nRay Nelson’s short story “Eight O’Clock in the Morning” was scary in 1963. It became even more so 25 years later with this John Carpenter adaptation. And, 35 years further on, it’s even scarier. Why? Because all this time, hasn’t it felt like an elite group of Reptilian aliens disguised as humans—ssssssshhhhh—have been controlling us, keepin’ the working man down?\n\nThey Live is also tons of fun, with mullet-sportin’ wrestler Rowdy Roddy Piper kicking all the butts in the lead role while also attempting to act. And there’s no denying the awesomeness of Piper and costar Keith David’s epic six-minute fight in a dirty alleyway.\n\n14. Pet Sematary (1989)\n\n(Video screenshot from YouTube)\n\nWe all live in fear of losing a loved one in an accident. It’s hard to imagine ever coming back from that. But what if your elderly neighbor showed you how to bring back your beloved kitty cat, toddler, or spouse? It’s too good to be true, but wouldn’t you do anything to bring back your loved ones—even if it killed you?\n\nThis Stephen King story, adapted by director Mary Lambert, is even more nightmarish than I’ve made it sound. You have to watch (or read) Pet Sematary to discover why. Just don’t do it if you’ve recently lost someone, ‘cause then the film gets scary on a whole ‘nother level.\n\nMore recommended ’80s horror movies\n\nWhen you’re done watching the films on the main list, get a load of these:\n\nRecommended ’80s body horror movies\n\nThe Beast Within (1982)\n\nThe Blob (1988)\n\nBrain Damage (1988)\n\nHellbound: Hellraiser II (1989)\n\nPossession (1981)\n\nRe-Animator (1985)\n\nScanners (1981)\n\nSociety (1989)\n\nStreet Trash (1987)\n\nThe Stuff (1985)\n\nTetsuo: The Iron Man (1989)\n\nVideodrome (1983)\n\nRecommended ’80s cannibal movies\n\nAnthropophagous (1980)\n\nCannibal Apocalypse (1980)\n\nCannibal Ferox (1981)\n\nCannibal Holocaust (1980)\n\nCut and Run (1985)\n\nEaten Alive!
