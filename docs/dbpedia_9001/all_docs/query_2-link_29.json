        "text": "(Norman J Warren, 1981)\n\nRelease date: 30 August 2021\n\nStandard Edition Blu-ray\n\nBoasting a strong female cast – including Judy Geeson (10 Rillington Place), Stephanie Beacham (Tam-Lin) and Victoria Tennant (Flowers in the Attic) – and co-financed by Run Run Shaw of the Shaw Brothers, Inseminoid is among Norman J Warren’s most widely seen films… and his most infamous. Once listed as a ‘video nasty’, this science-fiction horror concerns a small crew of scientists who are terrorised by a creature on a distant planet. Comparisons with Ridley Scott’s Alien have been ever-present, though Inseminoid has a charm all of its own – it may not have the gloss or the budget, but it’s certainly a great deal of fun.\n\nINDICATOR STANDARD EDITION SPECIAL FEATURES\n\n2K restoration, supervised and approved by director Norman J Warren\n\nOriginal mono audio\n\nAudio commentary with Warren and assistant director Gary White (2004)\n\nThe BEHP Interview with Norman J Warren – Part Two (2018, 67 mins): archival video recording, made as part of the British Entertainment History Project, featuring Warren in conversation with Martin Sheffield\n\nNorman J Warren at the Manchester Festival of Fantastic Films (2011, 62 mins): archival video recording of the director in conversation with horror author John Llewellyn Probert\n\nSubterranean Universe (2004, 45 mins): archival documentary on the making of Inseminoid, featuring interviews with Warren, actors Stephanie Beacham, David Baxt and Barry Houghton, and others\n\nAlien Encounter (2019, 6 mins): actor Trevor Thomas recalls playing the part of Mitch\n\nElectronic Approach (2004, 13 mins): archival interview with composer John Scott\n\nOriginal theatrical trailers\n\nHorror Planet teaser trailer\n\nTV spot\n\nImage gallery: promotional and publicity material\n\nNew and improved English subtitles for the deaf and hard-of-hearing"
