        "text": "[Note: Rankings are subject to wild swings based on the randomness and intensity of my movie moods]\n\n1. Candyman (2021)\n\nConsider me an instant fan of Nia DaCosta. She shows a superior eye for color, composition, and movement, and she had my rapt attention for 91 straight minutes. Her work is meant to be seen on the big screen.\n\nYahya Abdul-Mateen II and Teyonah Parris struck the right notes in the lead roles, and most of the supporting performances were larger-than-life enough to suit the material without becoming campy.\n\nCandyman isn’t without its flaws. There’s a little too much plot coming at the audience a little too fast, which rendered the final 20 minutes of the movie confusing. I would love to see a cut in which the finale plays out at a more deliberate pace.\n\n2. The Blackcoat’s Daughter (2015)\n\nAn hour into watching this film, I wouldn’t have imagined I’d end up ranking it so highly. The story is almost impenetrable and even frustrating as we follow the overlapping lives of three characters, all of whom have secrets they aren’t inclined to share with anyone, including the audience.\n\nBut as the truth reveals itself over the final act, we begin to realize the true extent of the horror that’s unfolding, and the payoff is a shocker. The Blackcoat’s Daughter is a film that will stick with me.\n\n3. The Severed Arm (1973)\n\nWhat this cheap and nasty 1970s slasher lacks in polish, it makes up for in grisly nihilism. The Severed Arm is not FX-driven like a classic 1980s slasher, though it does feature some rather bloody violence. What stands out most is the unrelenting bleak tone. It looks like a slasher movie but feels like survival horror.\n\nThe acting is hit or miss and the dialog is clunky, but, hey, it’s a grindhouse movie. You know what you’re getting. Be sure to watch the uncut version (available from Vinegar Syndrome).\n\n4. Mountaintop Motel Massacre (1983)\n\nThe deranged proprietor of a rundown motel takes advantage of a power outage to start picking off her unsuspecting guests.\n\n[That’s not a spoiler. We know from the opening scene.]\n\nAfter watching this film again—my first revisit since the VHS era—I’m revising my opinion upward. It’s not a great movie. The acting ranges from passable to amateurish and the editing is choppy and awkward. However, the persistent griminess and gloom lend it a nice, greasy drive-in vibe. The use of doorways to symbolize the killer’s warped mind is a stylish touch in an otherwise straightforward piece of trash horror.\n\n5. Vampira/Old Dracula (1974)\n\nMan, this movie is embarrassing. Dracula revives his long-dead bride, Vampira, with a blood transfusion from a black woman, which has the inexplicable effect of turning Vampira black. Dracula, portrayed as a stiff-upper-lip Englishman by David Niven, is politely distressed by the situation and decides he must do whatever it takes to turn her white again.\n\nHad Vampira been conceived and filmed as a bawdy, bad-taste, trash comedy, it might be appallingly funny on some level. Imagine a collaboration between John Waters and Rudy Ray Moore! But aside from one comedic supporting character, it plays more like a drama with Dracula depicted in a sympathetic light, despite the character being a snob and a bore.\n\nAs a Linda Hayden completist, I had to give it a watch, but the 5 minutes she’s on screen are the only bits I enjoyed.\n\n6. Girls School Screamers (1984)\n\nMy bar for slasher movies is pretty low. I like a trash film that embraces its trashiness, and a slasher delivering on its lurid promise is usually enough for a passing mark.\n\nGirls School Screamers starts off well enough: 7 young women at a Catholic college head to an old mansion, bequeathed by a dead benefactor, to spend a few days cataloging the valuables inside. When one of the students discovers that she bears a striking resemblance to a 45-year-old portrait on the wall, she and her classmates decide to hold a séance to contact the now-dead subject of the artwork. Which, of course, results in unintended consequences.\n\nExcept the consequences are barely coherent. Something about a killer, a ghost, ghost possession, incest, and dead people who sit upright with their eyes open. The kill scenes are tame (except for one over-the-top electrocution, which, now that I think about it, isn’t even a murder. It’s more of a bad-wiring accident). The film’s melodramatic story pretensions, revealed in the second half, do not befit the genre or its miniscule budget.\n\nAs a teenage horror fan in the 1980s, I felt as if I were living in an age of discovery. Only now, when compiling this list, do I realize 1984 was limited in its breadth of offerings compared to the years around it. Perhaps I had been too busy tracking down bootleg videos of Joe D’Amato and Paul Naschy films to notice.\n\nIn retrospect, A Nightmare on Elm Street cast such a long shadow across the genre that it disguised the dip in quantity and quality elsewhere. Still, as with 1983, there are a few gems and more than enough enjoyable B-efforts to cobble a list together.\n\nMy Top 10 Horror Films of 1984\n\nA Nightmare on Elm Street\n\nI’m going to be negative for a moment. In comparison to other Golden Age of Horror classics, A Nightmare on Elm Street hasn’t aged that well. There’s quite a bit of cringey acting and hokey dialog, and the ending is poorly conceived.\n\nThat said, the scares still work great, and Freddy Krueger is a truly inspired villain that takes the concept of “horror icon” way beyond the silent-killer-in-a-mask routine. The film is, in the end, a dark fairy tale masquerading as a slasher movie.\n\nAmong all the great horror directors of the time, Wes Craven may have been the most outside-the-box thinker. Flawed or not, Elm Street changed the genre more than any film since Halloween, and that’s no small achievement.\n\nTerminator\n\nTerminator is a film that can be claimed by several genres, including action and science fiction. That it also works as horror is a testament to James Cameron’s dynamism as a filmmaker.\n\nDespite the high concept, Terminator’s relatively low budget works in the film’s favor. It’s lean, mean, and harsh looking, which adds both to the intensity and the realism. That chewed-up looking Schwarzenegger-bot above is a nightmarish sight indeed.\n\nFriday the 13th – The Final Chapter\n\nThough a big fan of the Friday the 13th franchise, I recognize the repetitiveness of the films and their low artistic merit. For some reason, though, I’ve always found them more unnerving than the other well-known horror series. As I’m wont to say, horror is supposed to be scary. The other factors become less important when a movie is successful in getting under your skin.\n\nAdmitting that we’re dealing with a low-brow concept here, I think The Final Chapter is the second best in the series (after the original). They got the formula down, added some human drama, upped the body count, and brought Tom Savini back to stage some great kills. Ted White made a more physically imposing Jason than anyone before as well. A great film, no. But it works well for what it is.\n\nGremlins\n\nI’ve never been into Hollywood glitz. I don’t like “cute” films and I have little interest in sanitized horror.\n\nOnce in a while, there’s an exception. Gremlins is just so creative and fun, and so full of homage to classic cinema, it’s hard not to like it. It doesn’t hurt to have Joe Dante at the helm, the talented filmmaker who had previously directed The Howling and Piranha.\n\nThe Company of Wolves\n\nThis British werewolf flick is a delightful oddball with its a strange mix of childlike storytelling and extreme graphic violence, operating very much in the spirit of Grimm’s fairy tales. This is one instance in which a bigger budget might have helped, as the FX, while creative, are spotty in terms of execution. Overall, though, The Company of Wolves marches to the beat of its own drummer, an admirable quality in a film.\n\nC.H.U.D.\n\nThis has to be the most referenced and joked about film that hardly anyone has seen. It’s a throwback to 1970s-era eco-horror but with a 1980s twist in animatronic creature FX. C.H.U.D. drags at times and ultimately lacks payoff (where’s the big, gory, all-out monster attack?), which keeps it from being a real genre classic.\n\nContrary to popular belief, “C.H.U.D.” does not stand for “cannibalistic humanoid underground dwellers.” You have to stick around for the last act to find out what it really means.\n\nRats\n\nWhen an idiotic post-apocalyptic flick about flesh-eating rats makes number seven on a Top 10 list, it’s either a weak year or your list maker is drunk. Perhaps it’s a combination of both.\n\nLook, I know there are fans of Night of the Comet wondering why they don’t see that film anywhere on this page, while a $5 piece of trash from Bruno Mattei is front and center. The answer: I like Rats better. ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯\n\n[I don’t get the appeal of Night of the Comet, to be honest. But shhhh, people get legit annoyed when you don’t like a film they like]\n\nSilent Night, Deadly Night\n\nThough Christmas-themed horror films and killer Santas were nothing new in 1984, this slasher flick seemed to inspire a fair amount of outrage among the parental-warning-sticker crowd. I’m not sure how much of that was real and how much was staged for marketing purposes, but either way, it worked for the filmmakers.\n\nSilent Night, Deadly Night is a surprisingly gloomy film and not one you’d call “fun” in the way that Friday the 13th Part 2 and Pieces are fun. It probably wouldn’t crack my Top 10 list in a stronger year, but it has its merits, including Linnea Quigley in a small but memorable role as one of the killer’s victims, this coming before her rise to scream-queen fame.\n\nThe Toxic Avenger\n\nLest you think I’ve lost my mind, I’m fully aware The Toxic Avenger is not a good movie by any standard. At the time, though, before Troma’s garbage aesthetic became a known quantity, this film was hysterically terrible in ways no one had ever imagined a film could be.\n\nIt’s a nostalgia pick for one reason: I actually saw this movie in a theater and watched through tears of laughter as patron after patron marched out in disgust. I stayed until the end, and it was great.\n\nThe Initiation\n\nSigh. This goofy slasher would not have gotten anywhere near my Top 10 lists from 1980-82. But here we are in 1984, when horror hit a lull, so we work with what we’ve got.\n\nThe Initiation has some good kills going for it, plus Clu Gulager and Vera Miles, two actors who can elevate a B-movie. Daphne Zuniga fans ought to enjoy her extensive screen time as well. It’s a mostly dumb and not-at-all scary flick, but measured against the entirety of 1980s slashers, it’s not bad.\n\nHonorable Mention\n\nChildren of the Corn\n\nWe all have subgenres we like and ones we don’t. For whatever reason, the Amish/Mennonite horror scene (Wes Craven’s The Deadly Blessing is another example) doesn’t appeal to me. I can see how others would dig the look and atmosphere of Children of the Corn. I just never got into it.\n\nTerror in the Aisles\n\nHey, they tried! Terror in the Aisles, a documentary ostensibly celebrating the horror genre, helped pave the way for the likes of His Name Was Jason, Halloween: 25 years of Terror, and other recent, in-depth examinations of popular horror franchises.\n\nHowever, Terror is little more than a string of random clips and seems targeted at people who know nothing about the genre. The running time is liberally padded with scenes from action movies and cop thrillers as well. The idea behind this production is good but the execution is forgettable.\n\nDeath Warmed Up\n\nUp to this point in this blog series, I haven’t given much attention to the contributions of our filmmaking friends down under. To rectify that, either this one or Razorback was getting talked about today. However, since I’ve never seen Razorback (gasp!), the choice was already made.\n\nThe arrival of Death Warmed Up in North America was preceded by some buzz within the horror world, but I admit to having been underwhelmed when I saw it. I’ve watched it since and still don’t find it that great, but I could hardly shun the Australians for the likes of Firestarter or Monster Dog, could I?\n\nAnd thus we arrive at the most prolific year in the history of horror, the likes of which we shall never witness again. Let us pray…\n\n52 titles appear on this page, which equates to a new horror film every week, and I’ve surely overlooked or forgotten more. What a glorious time it was to be a genre fan.\n\nI tried really hard to limit this list to 10 films, but it simply wasn’t possible. If you find this abuse of power unconscionable, you may submit your official complaint to the Department of Listicles ($10 processing fee).\n\nMy Top 15 Horror Films of 1981\n\nThe Evil Dead\n\nIf I absolutely, positively had to answer the question, What’s your favorite horror film?, I’d have to go with The Evil Dead. It’s not the best acted or most polished movie, but it is 85 minutes of pure, unpretentious, unrelenting horror, and Sam Raimi‘s directorial prowess is miles above and beyond the norm. To those who claim that splatter and terror are exclusive of each other, I say bullshit.\n\nThe Howling\n\nWerewolves were my favorite monster when I was a kid, but I never understood why the inevitably tragic hero viewed his lycanthropy as a curse. I wanted to be a werewolf. And so do the lycanthropes in The Howling, a movie that’s scary, funny, and totally outside the box. In my opinion, it’s the best werewolf film of them all.\n\nAlso, since my prior blog posts discussed the make-up FX artist as the “movie star” of 1980s horror: How about then-relative unknown Rob Bottin’s work in this film? It’s like he showed up to a high-school dance in a Lamborghini.\n\nAn American Werewolf in London\n\nYou know it’s a deep draft when John Landis’s werewolf classic ends up at number 3 on a Top 10 list. As with The Howling, American Werewolf in London is both scary and funny and boasts legendary FX work, this time by Rick Baker. How much iconic horror imagery can come out of one film? A lot, it turns out.\n\nGalaxy of Terror\n\nConsidering its minuscule $700K budget, Galaxy of Terror may be the most ambitious film ever made. The producers could have set the whole show on a spaceship and then let a rubber monster pick off the crew one by one, and few would have complained. But instead we are given a mythology to contemplate, a host of monsters and other horrors, and a giant pyramid game in which humans are the playing pieces and the fate of the universe is at stake.\n\nYou can make fun of it for being “cheesy” if you like, but it’s a pretty bold take on Alien. Shit, Prometheus and Alien: Covenant rip this movie off, however unintentionally. That’s irony.\n\nHalloween II\n\nThis film has to be one of the most underappreciated sequels in horror. Halloween II is scary and intense, nearly equaling the original in that regard, yet with more of a 1980s-style body-count ethos. I love the conceit of setting the story on the same night as the original. A wise choice.\n\nHouse by the Cemetery\n\nSome Lucio Fulci fans view House by the Cemetery as the weakest of his splatter epics, perhaps because it lacks the surreal horror set-pieces you get in the other films (e.g., the zombie-shark underwater fight in Zombie and the spider attack in The Beyond). I rather enjoy its simplicity, though. It’s a haunted house movie of sorts, and an eerie one.\n\nAnd it’s not like Fulci scrimps on the gore. Some pretty savage kills occur in this flick.\n\nMy Bloody Valentine\n\nThe slasher film is probably the cinematic sub-genre most reviled by critics. I say fuck ‘em. There are good and bad slasher films, and My Bloody Valentine is one of the good ones.\n\nThe small-town setting, the character drama, and the horror all feel authentic, and the filmmakers exploit the “valentine” imagery memorably. The unrated version boasts some truly grim kills as well, and the murderer, with his pick-ax and gas mask, is as striking a figure as any of the more well-known horror icons.\n\nBurial Ground\n\nMy god, this guy’s shirt.\n\nHome video marketers tend to throw the word “sleazy” around to promote trashy horror films and gialli from the 70s and 80s, as if we genre fans all wear trench coats in theaters and subscribe to Barely Legal.\n\nI’m saying, save the word “sleazy” for when you really mean it, like when you’re talking about Andrea Bianchi’s Burial Ground. Everything from the ridiculous zombies to the casting of a porn actor as one of the male leads to the nauseating oedipal subplot, it’s quite a piece of trash. And of course there’s that scene. Just try to unsee it.\n\nNightmare\n\nIf we’re going to talk sleazy films, we might as well get ‘em out of the way all at once.\n\nNightmare, like Maniac and Don’t Go in the House from a year earlier, is a character-study slasher. That is, we are aware of the killer’s identity from the beginning, and instead of getting to know a bunch of attractive young people and then watching them get picked off in turn, we follow the killer around as he commits his crimes.\n\nThe body count is comparatively low in this flick, but the kills are extremely nasty and bloody. And if you thought it impossible for an actor to out-repulse Joe Spinell from Maniac, you haven’t seen Baird Stafford cry, scream, foam at the mouth, and turn into a sweaty, quivering blob when sexually aroused.\n\nGhost Story\n\nWhew. It’s time for a little Hollywood glitz to wash away the filth.\n\nGhost Story, loosely based on the Peter Straub novel, tells of four elderly men with an old, dark secret that’s finally catching up to them. The film offers an air of wintery doom, great make-up FX by The Exorcist veteran Dick Smith, and a pitch-perfect performance from Alice Krige as the vengeful specter.\n\nThere are some unexplained character motivations and a pointless subplot about a menacing hoodlum that goes unresolved, but it lives up to its promise as an eerily atmospheric horror.\n\nScanners\n\nDavid Cronenberg’s tale of a mind war between telekinetic rivals is bursting with ideas and revels in its ambiguity. And it features one of the best-known FX set pieces in horror history, when Michael Ironside blows up some guy’s head by thinking at him.\n\nAlthough Scanners is most certainly more intelligent than most of the films above it here, I have it at 11 because of some momentum-killing pacing problems and a woefully miscast lead actor.\n\nFriday the 13th Part 2\n\nIn a sub-genre often mocked for lack of originality, Friday the 13th Part 2 is so derivative of its forerunner that one could call it a remake. A more polished and less scary remake.\n\nThat said, most of the characters are likable, which makes their deaths more impactful for the viewer, and the overall proceedings are fun and fast paced. And we all know Amy Steel is, with good reason, the poster child for “The Final Girl.”\n\nDead and Buried\n\nSomehow this film remains relatively obscure, which is a shame because it’s eerie throughout and quite chilling at times. The story eventually unravels thanks to an overload of plot twists that stop making sense after a while. Perhaps it’s best to enjoy the ride and avoid thinking about what it all means. Arguably the scariest film on this list.\n\nThe Prowler\n\n1981 offers a cornucopia of slasher films to explore, from the classic My Bloody Valentine to the forgettable Graduation Day to the flat-out bizarre Student Bodies. I wouldn’t say The Prowler is exceptional (compared to some of the others on this list, it drags in spots), but it has one sure thing going for it: Tom Savini.\n\nSavini did fine FX work in Maniac and The Burning, but I believe the kills in this film are his best achievement in the slasher realm. Most happen on camera with the actors in motion, and they’re quite harrowing. The knife-through-the-top-of-the-head scene, when the victim’s eyes go white, is my favorite kill shot in any slasher film. Bravissimo, Mr. Savini.\n\nCannibal Ferox\n\nI knew Umberto Lenzi would show up on one of my lists eventually, even if I had to cheat and go to 15 entries.\n\nThis gorier knock-off of Cannibal Holocaust is the cinematic equivalent of Burger King: It’s bad for you and leaves you feeling sick, but when that hankering hits, damn you enjoy it. Those of us who grew up in the video nasty VHS era—when this movie was called Make ‘em Die Slowly—know well the allure of films so offensive they dare you to rent them. In that context, you won’t find a better marketing tagline than “Banned in 31 countries!”\n\nHonorable mention\n\nThe Beyond\n\nShockingly to some, this film is my least favorite of Fulci’s “big four” zombie classics. But it’s still a few steps ahead of most other horror films. Had it been released a year or two later, it would easily have cracked my top 10.\n\nThe Burning\n\nIt tells you what kind of year it was when one of the better slasher films of the decade only earns an honorable mention.\n\nThe Funhouse\n\nTobe Hooper once again proves his directorial chops with this stylish and well-shot slasher that seems more profound than it is thanks to his skillful filmmaking. Gore was never Hooper’s thing, but this one might have moved into the top 15 had the kills been more memorable.\n\nHappy Birthday to Me\n\nThat’s it, 1981 is officially the Year of the Slasher. This entry is a solid horror flick with a “you gotta be kidding” twist that’s audacious enough to be cool.\n\n_________________________\n\nHere are more horror films released in 1981, many of which are excellent. You could make a strong Top 10 list from these “leftovers” alone:\n\nAbsurd · Black Cat · Blood Beach · Bloody Birthday · Bloody Moon · The Boogens · Dark Night of the Scarecrow · Dawn of the Mummy · The Deadly Blessing · Don’t Go in the Woods · Don’t Go Near the Park · Evilspeak · Fear No Evil · Final Exam · Full Moon High · Funeral Home · Graduation Day · The Hand · Hell Night · Inseminoid · Just Before Dawn · The Loch Ness Horror · The Nesting · Night of the Werewolf · Omen III: The Final Conflict · Piranha 2: The Spawning · The Pit · Porno Holocaust · Possession · Saturday the 14th · Student Bodies · Wolfen · Zombie Lake\n\nThis shit just got real.\n\nIn 1980, the horror genre exploded. For makers of Top 10 lists (a noble endeavor to be sure), there are three times as many films to choose from compared to years prior. However, there are also fewer consensus classics. Your list might look nothing like mine.\n\nTo some, Prom Night and Motel Hell are the bees’ knees, whereas I’d take Without Warning or Nightmare City over those two any day.\n\nWe can all agree on one thing: mainstream critics hated this stuff.\n\nMy Top 10 horror films of 1980\n\nThe Shining\n\nThe most quoted, homaged, and parodied horror movie ever made, The Shining is famously hated by Stephen King, yet I feel it’s by far the best movie based on one of his books. Honestly, I’m in it for Stanley Kubrick. The film is mesmerizing; the novel leaves me colder than snow falling at the Overlook Hotel on a Wednesday.\n\nFriday the 13th\n\nWhen I discuss a movie’s “scares,” I’m often talking about effective genre filmmaking, not actual fear. I’m not literally scared watching The Exorcist. The sensation is more akin to pleasure at how successfully it delivers the thrills.\n\nFriday the 13th, on the other hand, is scary to me for real. Like, “sprint up the stairs from my man cave after watching it, hoping to outrace the hand that is sure to grab me any second” scary. I’ve had multiple nightmares about this film.\n\nViewed out of context, it’s a cheap-looking, unstylish slasher flick, so I’m not sure what makes it so effective and influential. The isolation of the characters? The fact that you never see the killer but you see the kills? The location shooting? The score? Whatever it was, director/producer Sean S. Cunningham captured lightning in a bottle. Critics be damned, this film is among my all-time favs.\n\nCity of the Living Dead\n\nDoes anyone know what this movie is about? Coherence was never a strength of Lucio Fulci’s horror oeuvre, but this entry is especially dreamlike and disjointed. My plot summary: something séance, something buried alive, something table drill, puking entrails, here come the zombies.\n\nCity of the Living Dead AKA The Gates of Hell may be little more than a 90-minute string of horror set-pieces, but they are wonderfully shot, gruesome, eerie, and atmospheric set-pieces. Phantasm, Fulci style?\n\nZombie Holocaust\n\nBack in the early days of VHS, we rented every single new horror flick that hit the shelves in the hopes of finding that rare grindhouse jewel: A flick that delivered everything you wanted and more. If you ever wanted “Zombie meets Last Cannibal World meets Island of Lost Souls,” this was that one time it happened.\n\nCannibal Holocaust\n\nCannibal Holocaust is such a vile film, I contemplated bumping it from the list. But to do so would be a violation of the sacred oath taken by list-makers: Thou shalt be as honest as possible (even if thine moods are known to change like the shifting wind).\n\nAppalling qualities aside, this grindhouse epic is well-directed, intense, and influential. It’s certainly more significant than the goofy gore-fest with the similar title that I slotted right above it. I never promised you I have good taste.\n\nThe Fog\n\nAuteurs sometimes trip up after creating their first masterpiece, such as when Tobe Hooper followed Texas Chainsaw Massacre with Eaten Alive or when George A Romero somehow thought There’s Always Vanilla to be the right vehicle after Night of the Living Dead.\n\nNot John Carpenter. Perhaps The Fog isn’t quite on par with Halloween, but Carpenter still delivered an effective and eerie ghost story that serves as a fine example of how to wring maximum horror from a minimal budget. I think it misses a few opportunities, which is why it isn’t higher on this list. Nevertheless, it’s one of the top films in a busy year for the genre.\n\nManiac\n\nThis is a grim fucking movie. Audiences hoping for shriek-then-laugh jump scares and scenes of good-looking teenagers getting picked off one by one instead got a grimy character study about a serial killer. And they had to look at Joe Spinell’s sweaty, crying mug for 90 minutes.\n\nThe character-study approach to horror in the early 80s was surely an artistic rather than commercial choice. It tended to limit the crowd-pleasing aspects of a film and might even have suppressed word-of-mouth. How many casual moviegoers viewed Maniac and then told their friends, “I just watched this sickening and depressing flick about a fat, greasy killer with mommy issues. You gotta see it!”?\n\nThen again, the film does boast brutally realistic gore FX by Tom Savini. I doubt we’d be talking about it if it didn’t.\n\nHumanoids from the Deep\n\nIt’s well known to horror fans that the director of this film, Barbara Peeters, attempted to deliver a PG-rated eco-horror movie, but the producers sabotaged her vision by inserting new footage laden with gratuitous gore and nudity.\n\nI can’t say I’m sympathetic. They took what would have been a dull and anachronistic monster movie and turned it into a grindhouse classic. Sit back and enjoy the royalty checks, Ms. Peeters!\n\nHell of the Living Dead\n\nThat’s right. Of all the options I had available to me for this list, I went with a Bruno-fucking-Mattei flick so famously dumb it should come with its own wisecracking shadow robots.\n\n“Borrowing” liberally from Dawn of the Dead and Zombie, and making use of egregiously inappropriate stock footage, Hell of the Living Dead is funnier than most comedies and more entertaining (to me) than the last ten Best Picture winners put together.\n\nTerror Train\n\n1980 had plenty to offer slasher movie fans. Terror Train, a stylishly shot and well-paced film, was one of the best. Sure, the characters are dimwitted even for a slasher film, but the above-average cinematography and the claustrophobic setting make up for its flaws.\n\nHonorable mention\n\nAlien Contamination – Alien gave you one chestburster. Alien Contamination gives you 12! That means it’s better. It also stars Ian McCulloch of Zombie and Zombie Holocaustfame.\n\nWait a minute. Why the hell isn’t this film on my Top 10 list?\n\nAlligator – Animatronic gators. What more do you need in life?\n\nAltered States – A story ideally suited to Ken Russell’s psychedelic-kitsch aesthetic.\n\nAnthropophagus – Joe D’Amato’s famously dopey cannibal horror film has its charms.\n\nInvasion of the Flesh Hunters – John Saxon + Giovanni Lombardo Radice + cannibalism = a movie both actors seem embarrassed about.\n\nDon’t Go in the House – Gloomy, gruesome character-study-slasher overshadowed by the similar but better Maniac.\n\nDressed to Kill – Brian de Palma does a giallo and it turns out pretty well.\n\nFade to Black – Fan-favorite slasher features a sympathetic killer a lot of viewers can relate to. It’s not the least bit scary, though.\n\nHouse on the Edge of the Park – Any similarity to Last House on the Left, including the casting of the same lead actor, is purely intentional.\n\nInferno – I love Dario Argento movies, but this one falls a bit short for me. That underwater room scene, though! If I ever obtain an HD version, I may be forced to revise my opinion.\n\nMotel Hell – I dig the black-comic horror elements, but this film is way too long for the flimsy plot. It should be 80 minutes, not 103.\n\nMother’s Day – Now here’s a black-comic horror I love. It’s brutally violent, though, which can be off putting to some.\n\nNightmare City –Did Umberto Lenzi just invent the “fast” zombie?\n\nProm Night – Hot take: this film is a slashiallo (a giallo-slasher hybrid).\n\nThe Boogie Man – The most terrifying film ever made about a little piece of broken glass that sticks to a lady’s face.\n\nThe Changeling – A subtle, psychological ghost story lost in a sea of splatter.\n\nThe Exterminator – I’m not sure it’s a horror movie, but genre fans have embraced it as one.\n\nWithout Warning – That time two Oscar winners and an Emmy winner starred in a $5 piece of trash about an alien that kills people with fleshy hamburger buns.\n\nby Alex Vorkov\n\nThe Movie\n\nTHE MUTILATOR (1984) is a fucking terrible film. That said, so is almost everything else in my DVD collection. As far as bad ‘80s slasher movies go, this one is pretty good.\n\nOriginally dubbed FALL BREAK, The Mutilator concerns a bunch of bored college kids who go to a beach house to get murdered. The first 35 minutes of the movie should be called Fall Break, because it wants to be a dumb teen comedy called Fall Break. In actuality, it’s an excruciatingly unfunny first act. A dumb teen movie, sans comedy.\n\nFortunately, director Buddy Cooper seems to have whacked his head at this point in the production and thought he was making a horror film. Either that or he realized just how much we all want these irritating fuckers to die, so he brought in FX wizard Mark Shostrom to kill them in satisfyingly gruesome ways.\n\nThe kills make your painful first-35-minute investment worthwhile. I won’t spoil them if you haven’t seen the film, but I will say there is one murder that is sure to make you squirm. I’d put The Mutilator next to THE PROWLER on the splatter scale. Certainly not in the Lucio Fulci class, but pretty gory for a throwaway slasher movie.\n\nPlus: Great splatter; weapon variety; a good beach location\n\nMinus: No likable characters; a gratuitous hairy chest; and the absolute worst theme song you ever heard in your life. Seriously, it’s like they took an adult-education songwriting class one night at the local high school and crammed every bad rock-pop cliché into one song. Remember how Kenny Loggins used to do all those catchy movie songs like Footloose and the one for CADDYSHACK? This song is to Kenny Loggins what I am to Wayne Gretzky. I mean, I can sort of skate in a straight line.\n\nThe Blu-ray\n\nI am so in love with Arrow Video I want to strangle it and violate its corpse (we all have our own ways of showing affection). There’s are a lot of disappointing Blu-rays out there, but Arrow has a way of taking old, murky, grainy movies you thought were shot on garbage film stock by people with no talent and making them look like brand-new productions.\n\nIf you haven’t picked up an Arrow disk yet, their work is a revelation. The Mutilator suffered from a particularly bad pan-and-scan VHS dub back in the day, with many of its night shots lost amid a grainy, indecipherable haze. This Blu-ray is crisp and bright, and the contrast is excellent. The blood in the kill scenes flows a wonderfully vivid crimson.\n\nYou know what? In the context of micro-budget slasher films with bad acting and witless scripts, Buddy Cooper turns out to be a pretty good director. Now that we can actually see what he shot in the proper aspect ratio and on a 2k transfer, there are many well-composed sequences, the shot coverage all edits together nicely, and the cinematography is stronger and more creative than previously evident.\n\nI’m not going to get into the audiophile stuff. I’m half deaf from playing drums for years and wouldn’t know the difference anymore. Suffice to say, the dialog, sound effects, and music are well mixed and up-front.\n\nThere are shit-tons of extras, including 2 commentaries and a lengthy making-of documentary as well as a booklet and reversible artwork.\n\nThe Mutilator is recommended for lovers of ’80s horror and slasher films and for people who like to torture themselves with godawful theme songs.\n\nThe 1980s were the era of the slasher film pop icon, when Jason Voorhees, Freddy Krueger, and Michael Myers transformed from mere movie characters into branded franchises, helped along by signifying attributes like goalie masks, red striped sweaters, and William Shatner’s face. Toys, t-shirts, and posters followed, and children even dressed as their favorite mass-murdering, unkillable psychopaths for Easter. Or Halloween, if your family is more normal than mine.\n\nMany filmmakers tried to emulate the success of these characters with unscary, disposable copycats like Dr Giggles and Horace Pinker (Shocker). Then there were the producers and directors who thought: let’s skip all the merchandising bullshit, the marketable killer, and enjoyment for the audience. Let’s make something unpleasant.\n\nDepending on the type of horror fan you are, you may find unpleasant films pleasant (hey, I listen to Emerson, Lake, and Palmer, which a lot of folks find pretty unpleasant). Grimy, uncommercialized slasher films tend to have a documentary feel as well, which can set a somber, dreadful tone that is an absolutely viable artistic choice. Notable about grimy slasher movies–versus the more mainstream ones–is the tendency to build the story around the killer rather than the teenagers in peril. Jason Voorhees is usually on screen for about 10-15 minutes out of 90, whereas in 4 of the 5 films described below, we follow the killer through the entire film, see his daily life, and often get a deeper backstory that explains what sent him on a murderous path.\n\nOh, he’s usually a repulsive, greasy fuckface that you’d cross the street to avoid in real life. No catchy one-liners, either. In chronological order:\n\nManiac (1980), Director – William Lustig\n\nJoe Spinell plays Frank Zito, a sweaty, pock-faced, overweight, hooker-scalping creep who imagines his mother while he kills. He is also dating tall, gorgeous Caroline Munro, in possibly the most implausible plot element ever committed to celluloid. Did they write this thing for Harrison Ford and leave the script as is when Joe Spinell took the part instead? Also, Spinell cries and rocks back and forth in a dirty, sweat-stained undershirt after he kills and mutilates his victims. Where can I get a poster of this for my bedroom?\n\nThe real star is Tom Savini’s gore effects. I’d say Maniac is a snuff film featuring real murders, but Savini kills himself in the movie and appears to be alive and well 35 years later, so maybe the guy is just gifted at special effects.\n\nDon’t Go in the House (1980), Director – Joseph Ellison\n\nDonny Kohler (Dan Grimaldi) picks up chicks, takes them back to his house, sticks them in a fireproof room with metal paneling, and burns them alive with a flamethrower. It’s not poorly made, but it is the kind of production that stuck the horror genre with the misogyny label. We find out that Donny was abused as a child, so I guess the message is: Don’t abuse your kids; they might burn people alive later. This is a somber flick and not very fun to watch. Like the Cosby Show now.\n\nNightmare (1981), Director – Romano Scavolini\n\nGeorge Tatum (Baird Stafford) is released from a mental institution and deposited back on the streets. This turns out to be a terrible decision, as he goes on a road trip/killing spree. That is, when he is not hallucinating, sweating, screaming, crying, going to porn shops, wetting the bed, wearing tighty whiteys, and foaming at the mouth, none of which makes people want to dress like him for Halloween. The uncut version his movie features the most over-the-top ax murder in all of cinema. No human holds that much blood.\n\nUnhinged (1982), Director – Don Gronquist\n\nThis somewhat more traditional slasher film tells the story of three women on their way to a concert who get into a crash and are brought into a creepy old house populated by the last humans you’d ever want to be around, and that includes all 14 Wrong Turn movies. Unhinged is basically an all-female Three on a Meathook, which is something the world was most certainly clamoring for. The main reason this movie leaves me feeling grimy is the disturbingly androgynous (not that there’s anything wrong with it) villain, played by Janet Penner. I was wondering whatever happened to Nancy Culp from Beverly Hillbillies.\n\nHenry: Portrait of a Serial Killer (1986), Director – John McNaughton\n\nSurely you’ve all seen this film by now. If you haven’t, please do so. It’s quite horrifying, disturbing, and haunting, and Michael Rooker is brilliant as the titular character. Based on real-life maniac Henry Lee Lucas, Henry: Portrait of a Serial Killer shows us a week in the life of an utter sociopath and feels very much like a documentary sans narration. It’s far better than the other four films on this list, but, like them, it’ll make you want to take a long, hot shower afterwards.\n\nSo what grimy 1980s slasher movies would you add to this list?"
