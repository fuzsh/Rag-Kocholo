        "text": "01 of 24\n\nThe Shining (1980)\n\nReleased the same month as the original Friday the 13th, The Shining isn't necessarily what you think of when you think of '80s horror. It's a slow-burn ghost story anchored by precision cinematography, bravura performances from stars Shelley Duvall and Jack Nicholson, and direction from Stanley Kubrick, a big-name filmmaker with no previous connection to the genre.\n\nNevertheless, The Shining holds up as a disturbing, bone-chilling classic whose influence is all over contemporary \"elevated\" horror.\n\nWhere to watch The Shining: Paramount+ with Showtime\n\n02 of 24\n\nA Nightmare on Elm Street (1984)\n\nNew Line Cinema is sometimes referred to as \"the house that Freddy built\" — an appropriate nickname given A Nightmare on Elm Street's outsize influence on the fledgling studio's fortunes.\n\nWes Craven adapted a newspaper story about a 12-year-old Cambodian refugee plagued by nightmares into this all-time classic, which marked the screen debut of both blade-wielding homicidal burn victim Freddy Krueger (Robert Englund) and a young Johnny Depp.\n\nWhere to watch A Nightmare on Elm Street: Max\n\n03 of 24\n\nEvil Dead II (1987)\n\nSam Raimi essentially remade his game-changing debut The Evil Dead (1981) with a bigger budget and an enhanced slapstick sensibility with Evil Dead II, a cabin-in-the-woods slasher by way of Looney Tunes.\n\nBruce Campbell returns as wisecracking final boy Ashley \"Ash\" Williams, whose unrelenting gauntlet of extreme terror as he fights for his life against the demonic Deadites is even bloodier — and sillier — this time around. The beauty of Evil Dead II is that it's both genuinely funny and genuinely scary, making for a wildly entertaining roller-coaster ride of a movie.\n\nWhere to rent Evil Dead II: Amazon Prime Video\n\n04 of 24\n\nVideodrome (1983)\n\nDisproving the stereotype that Canadians are inherently mild-mannered people, David Cronenberg's 1983 body-horror masterpiece Videodrome blends pain with pleasure, violence with entertainment, and human consciousness with pixelated transmissions from a nightmare realm.\n\nJames Woods stars as a sleazy TV executive in search of the ultimate ratings grab, alongside Blondie's Debbie Harry as the seductive hostess of the titular broadcast.\n\nWhere to rent Videodrome: Amazon Prime Video\n\n05 of 24\n\nHellraiser (1987)\n\nSpeaking of the razor's edge between pleasure and pain — queer horror icon Clive Barker lives on that edge, and so does his most famous creation, Hellraiser.\n\nAdapted from Barker's novella The Hellbound Heart, Hellraiser revolves around a mysterious puzzle box known as the Lament Configuration. Once solved, the box summons the Cenobites, sadomasochistic beings from a dimension of pain and suffering who are all too happy to show jaded mortals an agonizing good time.\n\nWhere to watch Hellraiser: Amazon Prime Video\n\n06 of 24\n\nFright Night (1985)\n\nSporting some good old-fashioned chills and a rockin' new wave soundtrack, Fright Night is a cult classic horror-comedy with a contagious affection for the genre.\n\nFeaturing Roddy McDowall as a TV horror host forced to confront the supernatural in real life, director Tom Holland's debut stars William Ragsdale as Charley Brewster, a horror-obsessed teen who becomes convinced that his suave next-door neighbor (Chris Sarandon) is actually a vampire.\n\nWhere to rent Fright Night: Amazon Prime Video\n\n07 of 24\n\nCreepshow (1982)\n\nCombining the powers of writer Stephen King, director George Romero, and special effects artist Tom Savini, Creepshow is one of the best horror anthologies — not only of the '80s but of all time.\n\nInspired by the EC horror comics King and Romero grew up reading in the '50s, the five segments that make up Creepshow are full of macabre twists, bizarre creatures, and amoral characters getting their well-deserved supernatural comeuppance. Cartoonish in the best way, it's a tribute to the childhood scares that made these horror icons and has now spawned a reboot series on Shudder.\n\nWhere to rent Creepshow: Amazon Prime Video\n\n08 of 24\n\nNear Dark (1987)\n\nBlending Western tropes with a punk-rock attitude, director Kathryn Bigelow puts a pulpy rockabilly spin on the vampire myth in Near Dark, one of the best and bloodiest vampire films of the '80s.\n\nAdrian Pasdar stars as Caleb Colton, a small-town kid who joins up with a roving band of vampires after being bitten by an alluring stranger he meets at a bar. But it's Bill Paxton who steals the show as Severen, the most unhinged of this undead crew, whose sex appeal is matched by his thirst for violence.\n\nNear Dark is currently unavailable to watch or rent\n\n09 of 24\n\nThe Thing (1982)\n\nOne of several horror masterpieces directed by John Carpenter, The Thing wasn't appreciated by critics or audiences during its initial release. Decades later, it's an undisputed classic.\n\nFilmmakers are still ripping off Rob Bottin's gruesomely inventive special effects, the excess of which contrasts with the tightly wound paranoia of the story. That latter quality only gets more relevant with every passing year; it's no coincidence that a screenshot of Kurt Russell's character saying, \"Nobody trusts anybody now, and we're all very tired\" went viral in 2020.\n\nWhere to rent The Thing: Amazon Prime Video\n\n10 of 24\n\nDay of the Dead (1985)\n\nThe third film in George Romero's zombie series is just as politically charged — and as nihilistic — as Night of the Living Dead and Dawn of the Dead, even though, yes, it does have a zombie listening to a Walkman.\n\nThe story picks up in a military bunker in the Everglades, where the last shreds of humanity have gathered in search of safety. Part-splatter movie and part-meditation on the dangers of science run amok, Day of the Dead is a sobering and thought-provoking take on the zombie genre.\n\nWhere to watch Day of the Dead: Hulu\n\n11 of 24\n\nRe-Animator (1985)\n\nSleazy, silly, lurid, colorful, and tons of fun, Re-Animator is a modern classic of mad scientist cinema. Directed by Stuart Gordon from a short story by H.P. Lovecraft, this video store favorite stars Jeffrey Combs as Herbert West, a medical student obsessed with bringing the dead back to life.\n\nThey don't teach ethics at Miskatonic University, so Herbert's experiments become increasingly outlandish, eventually drawing two of his fellow students (Barbara Crampton and Bruce Abbott) into his chaotic orbit.\n\nWhere to watch Re-Animator: Tubi\n\n12 of 24\n\nThe Return of the Living Dead (1985)\n\nThe most party-hearty horror movie of a party-hearty decade, The Return of the Living Dead will bring tons of madcap energy — and toxic sludge — to your movie night.\n\nThe story takes place in Louisville, Ky., where a group of teenage punks partying in a graveyard come face to face with the aftermath of two youths accidentally kicking over a barrel in a top-secret government facility. That barrel was full of a gas that turns unsuspecting humans into zombies, which can mean only one thing: Let the flesh-eating festivities begin!\n\nWhere to watch The Return of the Living Dead: Amazon Prime Video\n\n13 of 24\n\nFriday the 13th Part IV: The Final Chapter (1984)\n\nThe 1980 original spawned 10 sequels, a remake, and innumerable rip-offs. But this is the quintessential (and the best) Friday the 13th movie.\n\nErroneously billed as \"The Final Chapter,\" this fourth film in the saga does everything an '80s slasher is supposed to do — namely, put a bunch of horny teenagers in a cabin and let Jason Voorhees pick them off one by one. And it does it well, with gruesome kills, memorable characters (a rarity in the Friday the 13th series), and a totally bonkers ending featuring a young Corey Feldman.\n\nWhere to rent Friday the 13th Part IV: The Final Chapter: Amazon Prime Video\n\n14 of 24\n\nDead & Buried (1981)\n\nA dreamlike, atmospheric take on the zombie legend, Dead & Buried is one of the most singular horror movies of the '80s.\n\nDirector Gary Sherman's second feature, about a picturesque coastal town where packs of locals murder unsuspecting tourists — only for those tourists to be seen later wandering around town — languished in obscurity for decades before being rediscovered and hailed as a cult classic.\n\nWhere to watch Dead & Buried: Amazon Prime Video\n\n15 of 24\n\nThe Changeling (1980)\n\nGeorge C. Scott stars as a recently widowed dad in The Changeling, a sophisticated, grown-up take on the haunted house movie that's still absolutely terrifying. The story takes place in an empty, secluded Victorian mansion, where John Russell (Scott) retreats after losing his wife and daughter in a car crash.\n\nIf you think that sounds like the perfect time and place to see some ghosts, you're correct — but the knowing doesn't make their appearance any less heart-stopping, thanks to superior craftsmanship from director Peter Medak.\n\nWhere to watch The Changeling: Peacock\n\n16 of 24\n\nSociety (1989)\n\nThe '80s were a great decade for satirical horror-comedies, and Brian Yuzna's Society stands as one of the best of the subgenre.\n\nThe manicured lawns and yuppie fashions of Beverly Hills form the perfect backdrop for this bizarre (and goopy) statement on the decadence of the rich, starring the wonderfully named Billy Warlock as a wealthy teenager who suspects his parents are part of a cannibalistic cult. It all climaxes with an extended orgy of body-horror transformation that we won't spoil here, but we can guarantee that you'll never forget.\n\nWhere to rent Society: YouTube\n\n17 of 24\n\nThey Live (1988)\n\nAnother instant classic from genre master John Carpenter, They Live is a sci-fi horror satire whose commentary on mindless consumerism is as relevant today as it was in 1988.\n\nStarring \"Rowdy\" Roddy Piper as a drifter who finds a pair of sunglasses that expose an alien plot to subjugate humanity through subliminal messaging, They Live cuts its trenchant social critique with action-movie silliness — case in point: an infamous, hilarious fight sequence that goes on for six minutes for no particular reason — and highly quotable dialogue.\n\nWhere to rent They Live: Amazon Prime Video\n\n18 of 24\n\nOpera (1987)\n\nSome might say that Italian horror legend Dario Argento was past his prime by the time the '80s rolled around. Opera, however, disproves that argument. Argento's work has always incorporated the melodramatic sweep and heightened emotion of opera.\n\nAnd Opera, about an obsessive fan terrorizing a young soprano (Cristina Marsillach) during a production of Giuseppe Verdi's Macbeth, ranks among the maestro's most beautifully shot and fiendishly inventive tributes to the art of murder.\n\nWhere to watch Opera: Tubi\n\n19 of 24\n\nThe Slumber Party Massacre (1982)\n\nThe only '80s slasher franchise written and directed entirely by women, The Slumber Party Massacre satirized the subgenre while it was still being formed.\n\nDirected by Amy Holden Jones from a screenplay by lesbian feminist author Rita Mae Brown, The Slumber Party Massacre was written as a parody, but producers insisted that Jones film it as a straightforward slasher picture. Its tongue-in-cheek sensibility came through anyway, poking at horror tropes with clever visual gags and a comically oversized power drill.\n\nWhere to watch The Slumber Party Massacre: Freevee via Amazon Prime Video\n\n20 of 24\n\nPossession (1981)\n\nEmerging from obscurity to become a cult classic, Andrzej Żuławski's Possession is one of the most fascinating, singular visions in horror filmmaking. On one level, it's a shocking, disturbingly sexual arthouse creature feature. Dig deeper, and it's a painfully personal divorce movie.\n\nDeeper still, it's a psychological thriller about a woman losing her grip on reality, with a touch of Cold War-era political satire. Bleak, uncompromising, and anchored by an unforgettable performance from star Isabelle Adjani, Possession is a movie that's hard to shake.\n\nWhere to watch Possession: Shudder\n\n21 of 24\n\nThe Beyond (1981)\n\nLucio Fulci movies are an acquired taste. But once you've acquired it, nothing else satisfies in quite the same way. The Beyond is the second and best film in Fulci's Gates of Hell trilogy, about a woman who inherits a dilapidated hotel in the middle of the Louisiana swamp only to discover that it's cursed with a literal portal to hell in the basement.\n\nThe Beyond is \"about\" gore as much as it is \"about\" anything, however, a psychedelic miasma of slow-moving zombies and colorful viscera that's hypnotizing and confounding in equal measure.\n\nWhere to watch The Beyond: Peacock\n\n22 of 24\n\nTetsuo: The Iron Man (1989)\n\nYou may think you've seen it all, but that isn't true until you've seen Tetsuo: The Iron Man.\n\nJapanese director Shinya Tsukamoto's chaotic, erotic body-horror head trip takes cyberpunk to some unforgettable new places, using inventive low-budget effects to tell the surreal story of a \"metal fetishist\" whose death in a drive-by car accident sparks an outrageous new chapter in human evolution.\n\nWhere to watch Tetsuo: The Iron Man: Shudder\n\n23 of 24\n\nNight of the Comet (1984)\n\nValley girl culture was everywhere in the '80s, and two of the most appealing characters to come out of this mall-obsessed SoCal teen cult appear in 1984's Night of the Comet.\n\nCatherine Mary Stewart and Kelli Maroney star as Regina and Samantha, teenage sisters who fight for survival in postapocalyptic Los Angeles (with breaks for shopping, of course) after a passing comet turns most of the population into zombies. Full of vibrant color and good-natured humor, this entertaining sci-fi hybrid holds up — even if the fashions don't.\n\nWhere to watch Night of the Comet: Tubi"
