        "text": "Has there ever been a more potent metaphor for the pitfalls of capitalism present than the one presented in John Carpenter's 1988 opus They Live? The film may star Roddy Piper and feature some unforgettable one-liners (and one of the longest fistfights ever put on celluloid), but it also proffers a vision of a dystopian present ruled by aliens who plant subliminal messages in everything from newspapers to billboards to television to the money we use to buy them all.\n\nThese messages, which can only be seen with the aid of special glasses, tell us to do things like \"Obey,\" \"Consume,\" and \"Reproduce.\" It's all part of an elaborate scheme by the haves to keep the have-nots in line, and it's a message that feels as resonant now (when the aliens would be the 1%) as it was in Reagan's \"me generation\" '80s.\n\nLifeforce was written by Dan O'Bannon, one of the creators of Alien. It was directed by none other than Tobe Hooper, of Texas Chain Saw Massacre and Poltergeist fame. It stars Patrick Stewart, among others, not to mention Mathilda May never wearing so much as a stitch of clothes. And yet, most people have never seen this incredibly wild, apocalyptic movie about space vampires, based on the novel by Colin Wilson called, well, The Space Vampires.\n\nWhy not? It probably doesn't help that the film was a box office dud, grossing less than half its reported budget. Fortunately, the years have been kinder, and it seems that people in 1985 maybe just weren't ready for something as delightfully strange as this tale of vampires and unclothed people and lots and lots and lots of optical lightning.\n\nBack in the 1980s, Stephen King was at the height of his original popularity, and any number of his properties got adapted to the big screen, giving us classics like Carrie (technically from '76, but still), Christine, The Shining, and many more, along with, um, not-so-classic titles like Maximum Overdrive (directed by King himself). Naturally, some flicks were bound to slip through the cracks a little, even when they were every bit as good as their more popular counterparts.\n\nEnter The Dead Zone, David Cronenberg's 1983 adaptation of King's novel of the same name from '79. It stars none other than Christopher Walken as a schoolteacher who develops psychic powers when he awakens from a coma following a car accident - and ultimately has to use those powers to prevent a terrifying future.\n\nRichard Matheson's landmark novel I Am Legend has been adapted to screen at least three times and inspired such classics as Night of the Living Dead. Yet one of the best movies to riff on its plot is rarely discussed in the same breath as Matheson's original. Night of the Comet may be better known for its \"Girls Just Wanna Have Fun\" shopping montage than its literary pedigree, but it's a surprisingly strong take on the material, turning Matheson's vampires into zombies caused by a comet that wipes out much of the world's population and turns the remainder into gradually-decaying ghouls.\n\nProtected from the effects are two sisters who would maybe rather go shopping or play arcade games than be the last hope for humanity, but they're remarkably up to the task, nonetheless.\n\nIrvin Yeaworth's 1958 original is a gem from the heyday of drive-in movies - often imitated, seldom duplicated. Its method for introducing the eponymous monster can be seen echoed in everything from Creepshow to Night of the Creeps and beyond. Sadly, the 1988 remake, with a screenplay co-written by none other than The Walking Dead's own Frank Darabont, is less well-known. Which is too bad, as there's plenty to recommend this slice of '50s-style monster movie mayhem, updated for the '80s.\n\nIt's all here, from the rebel-without-a-cause lead character to the infamous scene in the movie theater (where this time, some kids have snuck in to watch a slasher movie, of course). The catch is, this time around it's all a whole lot gorier, with a twist in the tale that makes the original film's standard red scare monster something a little more home-grown...\n\nIt may be notorious director Ken Russell's best-known film, but that doesn't mean that most people have actually seen Altered States, a weirdo sci-fi flick from 1980 starring William Hurt and a very young Drew Barrymore, among others, and featuring everything from psychedelic set pieces to sensory deprivation tanks to ape-people and one of the sweatiest love scenes you've ever laid eyes on.\n\nTo call a Ken Russell movie \"weird\" or \"camp\" is pretty much a redundancy, but few studio pictures have ever been weird quite like Altered States is, a fever dream about a research scientist attempting to experience other states of consciousness who might just experience human evolution - all depicted as only a bravura weirdo like Russell could."
