But if you rate films by their popular appeal or their returns at the box office, they will quickly rise to the top—at least some of them. Ever since the cinema has existed, so have horror films. Today there is sure to be at least one showing at a neighborhood theater, as well as a couple on late-night television. So this latest volume in the cinema subseries caters to an extremely large clientele, including many whose passion for this genre is unbounded and who want nothing more than to be frightened out of their wits—by Dracula and Frankenstein, mummies and werewolves, and more sophisticated fare such as The Omen and The Exorcist. Their tastes have been satisfied and refined by some of the finest (and a few of the worst) actors, directors, and producers in the business. This Historical Dictionary of Horror Cinema takes a close look at the genre, starting with an impressive chronology that ranges from its origins through the present day. This is followed by a broad introduction, while the dictionary details individual actors, directors, producers, authors of horror novels adapted as films, major themes and categories, and notable films. Since local tastes are involved, there are entries on American, British, and Chinese horror, among others. And for fans who want to know more, there is an extensive bibliography. This volume was written by Peter Hutchings, who is both a specialist on and a fan of horror films. He teaches at Northumbria University and his courses include one on the horror film and others on cinema and television. Over the years, Dr. Hutchings has published a growing series of articles, papers, and books on horror films, on specific subjects such\n\nvii\n\nviii •\n\nEDITOR’S FOREWORD\n\nas Hammer Films, Terence Fisher, Dracula in the British Film Guide series, and The Horror Film in the Inside Cinema series. As an academic he has watched thousands of horror films, and as a fan he has enjoyed the experience even if his judgements on some are less than flattering. This book can both inform and entertain. Jon Woronoff Series Editor\n\nReader’s Note\n\nThe international character of horror film production and distribution often results in films acquiring more than one title as they move from one market to another. Reissues can also lead to films being retitled yet again. Consequently, some horror films can have five or six titles. In the interests of clarity, this dictionary presents the original film title first and then itemizes significant variants. Where the film in question is not made in English, the original title is followed by the English language titles under which it has been circulated, with the best known of these listed first. In many cases, the English language title will offer a loose translation of the original title. Any significant disparities in translation are discussed in the entries relating to the films in question.\n\nix\n\nChronology\n\n1764 Great Britain: Horace Walpole’s The Castle of Otranto has come to be seen by many literary historians as the first major Gothic novel. 1818 Great Britain: Mary Shelley’s Frankenstein is published. 1849 United States: Edgar Allan Poe dies. Several of his gothic stories are later adapted for the screen, among them “The Fall of the House of Usher,” “Murders in the Rue Morgue,” and “The Pit and the Pendulum.” 1872 Great Britain: J. Sheridan LeFanu’s vampire story Carmilla is published. It will provide inspiration for several lesbian vampire films of the 1960s and 1970s. 1886 Great Britain: Robert Louis Stevenson’s The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde is published. 1888 Great Britain: The “Jack the Ripper” killings take place in London. 1891 Great Britain: Oscar Wilde’s The Picture of Dorian Gray is published. 1896 Great Britain: H. G. Wells publishes his prototype “mad scientist” story The Island of Dr. Moreau. 1897 Great Britain: Bram Stoker’s Dracula is published. 1901 Great Britain: Arthur Conan Doyle publishes The Hound of the Baskervilles, the most horror-like of all Sherlock Holmes stories. 1910 United States: The earliest known screen adaptation of Mary Shelley’s Frankenstein is produced.\n\nxi\n\nxii •\n\nCHRONOLOGY\n\n1915 Germany: An early version of The Golem is released. 1919 Germany: Expressionist cinema begins with the release of Robert Wiene’s Das Cabinet des Dr. Caligari (The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari). 1920 Germany: More expressionist cinema comes in the form of Paul Wegener’s Der Golem, wie er in die Welt kam (The Golem) and F. W. Murnau’s Der Januskopf, an adaptation of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde that features Bela Lugosi in a small role. United States: John Barrymore stars in yet another version of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde. 1922 Germany: F. W. Murnau’s Nosferatu: eine Symphonie des Grauens (Nosferatu, a Symphony of Terror) is an unauthorized adaptation of Dracula. Denmark: The pseudo-documentary Häxen: Witchcraft through the Ages is released. 1923 United States: Lon Chaney delivers one of his most celebrated performances as Quasimodo in The Hunchback of Notre Dame. 1924 Germany: Robert Wiene’s Orlacs Hände (The Hands of Orlac) and Paul Leni’s Das Wachsfigurenkabinett (Waxworks) continue the Expressionist tradition. 1925 United States: Lon Chaney delivers his most horror-like performance in The Phantom of the Opera. 1926 Germany: F. W. Murnau’s Faust contains some impressive gothic imagery, while Paul Wegener’s Der Student von Prag (The Student of Prague) develops the supernatural doppelganger theme. 1927 Great Britain: Alfred Hitchcock directs the proto-serial killer thriller The Lodger. United States: The German director Paul Leni combines expressionistic imagery with comedy in The Cat and the Canary, an adaptation of a popular Broadway play. Lon Chaney plays a vampire in Tod Browning’s London after Midnight, now believed to be a lost film. 1928 France: Jean Epstein’s experimental adaptation of Edgar Allan Poe’s work, La chute de la maison Usher (The Fall of the House of Usher) is released. United States: Paul Leni’s gothic-themed melodrama The Man Who Laughs is considered by some critics to be his best film.\n\nCHRONOLOGY\n\n• xiii\n\n1929 France: Luis Bunuel and Salvador Dali’s surrealist Un chien andalou contains some striking horror-like imagery—not least an eye being sliced open—although it has little immediate impact on popular genre cinema. 1931 Germany: Fritz Lang’s M stars Peter Lorre as a serial child killer. United States: The successful release of Universal’s Dracula, directed by Tod Browning and starring Bela Lugosi, and Frankenstein, directed by James Whale and featuring Boris Karloff, kick-starts a boom in horror production. Universal also produces a Spanish-language version of Dracula, considered by some critics to be superior to the English language version. Paramount releases Rouben Mamoulian’s Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde; its star, Fredric March, receives an Academy Award for his performance. 1932 Germany: Danish director Carl Theodor Dreyer’s Vampyr offers a different, more dream-like take on the vampire story. United States: The horror boom begins in earnest. Universal releases Karl Freund’s The Mummy and James Whale’s The Old Dark House, both of which star Boris Karloff, and Robert Florey’s Murders in the Rue Morgue, which stars Bela Lugosi. Michael Curtiz directs Doctor X at Warner Brothers, Tod Browning makes the controversial Freaks at MGM, Fay Wray features in Ernest B. Schoedsack and Irving Pichel’s The Most Dangerous Game (The Hounds of Zaroff), and Lugosi stars in Victor Halperin’s independently produced White Zombie. 1933 Great Britain: The Boris Karloff vehicle The Ghoul is released. Mexico: La Llorona (The Crying Woman) combines U.S. horror conventions with local superstition. United States: James Whale develops his distinctive brand of comedy-horror with The Invisible Man. Erle C. Kenton directs Island of Lost Souls, a striking adaptation of H. G. Wells’ novel The Island of Dr. Moreau, while Michael Curtiz directs Mystery of the Wax Museum. The classic monster movie King Kong is also released, along with Murders in the Zoo, Secret of the Blue Room, Supernatural, and The Vampire Bat. 1934 Mexico: Dos Moinjes (Two Monks) and El Fantasma del Convento (The Phantom of the Convent) continue a small Mexican cycle of horror films. United States: Edgar G. Ulmer’s The Black Cat\n\nxiv •\n\nCHRONOLOGY\n\nturns out to be one of the most stylish of all 1930s Universal horrors. In comparison, the independently produced Maniac is a low-budget curiosity. 1935 Great Britain: The Mystery of the Mary Celeste, which stars Bela Lugosi, comes from an early version of the Hammer company, a later incarnation of which would become a leading horror specialist in the 1950s. United States: This is a key year for the American horror film with the release of James Whale’s Bride of Frankenstein, Karl Freund’s Mad Love, and Tod Browning’s Mark of the Vampire. Other horrors include The Black Room, The Crime of Dr. Crespi, The Raven, and Werewolf of London. 1936 France: Julien Duvivier’s Le Golem (The Golem) is a rare French horror production. Great Britain: Tod Slaughter stars in two horror-themed melodramas, The Crimes of Stephen Hawke and Sweeney Todd—The Demon Barber of Fleet Street, while Boris Karloff stars in The Man Who Changed His Mind. United States: Dracula’s Daughter is an impressive follow-up to the 1931 Dracula. Other horrors include the mad scientist drama The Invisible Ray, Tod Browning’s The DevilDoll, Victor Halperin’s Revolt of the Zombies, and Michael Curtiz’s final horror film, The Walking Dead. 1939 Great Britain: Tod Slaughter returns in The Face at the Window, and Bela Lugosi stars in Dark Eyes of London. United States: Bob Hope stars in a version of The Cat and the Canary that increases the comedy element. The Hound of the Baskervilles inaugurates a series of occasionally horror-themed Sherlock Holmes stories that feature Basil Rathbone as the great detective. Charles Laughton generates pathos as Quasimodo in The Hunchback of Notre Dame, while Boris Karloff is a mad scientist in The Man They Could Not Hang. Universal’s Son of Frankenstein and Tower of London represent the company’s return to the horror genre after a three year break. 1940 United States: The Mummy’s Hand starts a cycle of Mummy films. A busy Boris Karloff stars in The Ape, Before I Hang, and Black Friday, and Bela Lugosi stars in The Devil Bat. Bob Hope returns to comedy-horror in Ghost Breakers, and Karloff, Lugosi and Lorre send themselves up in You’ll Find Out.\n\nCHRONOLOGY\n\n• xv\n\n1941 United States: Lon Chaney Jr. becomes a horror star through his role in The Wolf Man and also features in Man Made Monster. Meanwhile, comedy duo Bud Abbott and Lou Costello make their comedy-horror debut with the haunted house spoof Hold That Ghost. 1942 France: Le loup des Malveneur (The Wolf of the Malveneurs) is an unusual—for French cinema at least—horror-like production. United States: Universal’s The Ghost of Frankenstein and The Mummy’s Tomb demonstrate the studio’s commitment to the production of sequels. By contrast, producer Val Lewton, who is based at RKO, offers a more middlebrow version of horror in Cat People. Other horrorthemed entertainments include the comedies The Boogie Man Will Get You and I Married a Witch, as well as the innovative werewolf film The Undying Monster. 1943 Denmark: Carl Theodor Dreyer’s Vredens dag (Day of Wrath) is a somber tale of witchcraft. France: La main du diable (The Devil’s Hand) is a stylish version of the Faustian pact. United States: Universal continues sequel production with Son of Dracula and Frankenstein Meets the Wolf Man, the first of its multiple monster films. More tasteful is the studio’s production of The Phantom of the Opera. More ludicrous is Captive Wild Woman, in which a mad scientist turns an ape into a woman. Val Lewton develops his artful strain of horror with The Ghost Ship, I Walked with a Zombie, The Leopard Man, and The Seventh Victim. 1944 United States: More sequels appear from Universal, namely House of Frankenstein, The Mummy’s Ghost and The Mummy’s Curse. Val Lewton makes a more upmarket sequel in the form of The Curse of the Cat People. Bela Lugosi plays a Dracula-like vampire in The Return of the Vampire, while the Sherlock Holmes films The Pearl of Death, The Scarlet Claw, and Sherlock Holmes and the Spider Woman all contain horror-related material. Other horrors include The Climax and the ghost story The Uninvited. 1945 Great Britain: Ealing Studios produces one of the great horror anthologies, Dead of Night. United States: Universal’s House of Dracula is the last of its non-comedy multiple monster films. At RKO, Val Lewton produces the period drama The Body Snatcher and the stylish but morbid Isle of the Dead. Albert Lewin directs a similarly upmarket adaptation of Oscar Wilde’s The Picture of Dorian Gray. Robert\n\nxvi •\n\nCHRONOLOGY\n\nSiodmak directs the stylish serial killer drama The Spiral Staircase. More prosaically, Sherlock Holmes and the House of Fear is another horror-themed adventure for the great detective. 1946 Great Britain: The indefatigable Tod Slaughter performs in another overheated horror melodrama, The Curse of the Wraydons, while Vernon Sewell directs Latin Quarter, a stylish tale of artistic insanity. United States: Insanity is the theme in Robert Florey’s The Beast with Five Fingers and Val Lewton’s final horror film, Bedlam. She-Wolf of London turns out to be a whodunnit rather than a werewolf film. 1948 Great Britain: Tod Slaughter is back in The Greed of William Hart, an everyday tale of body snatching. United States: Abbott and Costello Meet Frankenstein is the first and best of a series of comedies in which the duo encounter classic monsters, in this case, Frankenstein’s monster, Dracula and the Wolf Man (although, oddly, not Frankenstein). 1951 Great Britain: The “X” certificate—denoting films for adults only—is introduced. United States: Howard Hawks’ production of The Thing From Another World successfully combines science fiction conventions with horror material. Many other films of its type are subsequently made during the 1950s, although few are as distinguished. 1952 Great Britain: Bela Lugosi shows how far his career has fallen from grace by appearing in the low-budget comedy-horror Old Mother Riley Meets the Vampire. United States: Boris Karloff and Lon Chaney return to horror in the unimpressive The Black Castle. 1953 United States: Vincent Price stars in House of Wax, a color remake of Michael Curtiz’s 1933 Mystery of the Wax Museum. More alien monsters feature in Invaders from Mars and It Came From Outer Space. 1954 France: Henri-Georges Clouzot’s psychological thriller Les diaboliques is released. It will be an inspiration for many later horror filmmakers. United States: Jack Arnold’s Creature From The Black Lagoon and Gordon Douglas’s Them! are horror-like monster movies. 1955 Great Britain: The science fiction/horror film The Quatermass Xperiment (The Creeping Unknown) is the first major success for a small company by the name of Hammer.\n\nCHRONOLOGY\n\n• xvii\n\n1956 Great Britain: Hammer follows up its success with The Quatermass Xperiment by releasing another SF/horror, X The Unknown. Italy: Riccardo Freda’s I vampiri (The Devil’s Commandment) is the first Italian horror film. It is not commercially successful. United States: Horrorthemed science fiction production continues with Invasion of the Body Snatchers and It Conquered the World, while The Bad Seed is an early example of the “monstrous child” film. The Undead is Roger Corman’s first gothic-themed film. Bela Lugosi dies on 16 August. 1957 Great Britain: The Curse of Frankenstein is Hammer’s first color gothic horror and is directed by Terence Fisher, who will be responsible for many of the later Hammer horrors. The film stars Peter Cushing as Frankenstein and Christopher Lee as the creature and is a substantial commercial success. Hammer also releases the alien invasion fantasy Quatermass 2 (Enemy from Space). Cat Girl and Night of the Demon (Curse of the Demon) are impressive contemporary-set supernatural thrillers. Mexico: La momia Azteca (Attack of the Aztec Mummy), El Vampiro (The Vampire), and El Ataud del Vampiro (The Vampire’s Coffin), among others, signal the beginning of a new Mexican horror cycle. United States: SF/horror films include The Monster that Challenged the World and two films from Roger Corman, Attack of the Crab Monsters and Not of This Earth. A new emphasis on teenage horror is apparent in Blood of Dracula, I Was a Teenage Frankenstein, and I Was a Teenage Werewolf. American serial killer Ed Gein is arrested in Wisconsin; he will subsequently become an inspiration for such horrors as Psycho (1960), The Texas Chainsaw Massacre (1974), and The Silence of the Lambs (1991), to name but a few. 1958 Argentina: The television horror show Obras maestras de terror (Masterworks of Horror) is a popular success and runs until 1960. Great Britain: Hammer consolidates its position as a horror market leader with Dracula (Horror of Dracula), which stars Christopher Lee as the vampire; it also releases The Revenge of Frankenstein. Other British horrors include Blood of the Vampire, Corridors of Blood, Grip of the Strangler, and The Trollenberg Terror. United States: Teenage horrors include the self-reflexive How to Make a Monster along with Monster on the Campus, The Return of Dracula, and Teenage Monster. Vincent Price stars in The Fly, and producer-director William Castle makes his horror debut with Macabre. The SF/horror It! The Terror\n\nxviii •\n\nCHRONOLOGY\n\nfrom Beyond Space is later cited as an influence on Alien (1979). Boris Karloff plays Frankenstein for the first time in Frankenstein—1970 and also hosts the television horror series The Veil. 1959 France: Jean Renoir’s made-for-television Le testament du Docteur Cordelier (The Testament of Dr. Cordelier) is an impressive version of the Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde story, while Georges Franju’s Les yeux sans visage (Eyes without a Face) is an artful but also gruesome surgical horror. Germany: Die Nackte und der Satan (A Head for the Devil, The Head) is a rare German horror production from this period. Great Britain: Hammer releases period horrors The Hound of the Baskervilles, The Man Who Could Cheat Death, and The Mummy. Other filmmakers enter the market with The Flesh and the Fiends, Horrors of the Black Museum, and Jack the Ripper. Philippines: Gerardo de León’s Terror Is a Man is an early example of Filipino horror. United States: Roger Corman directs A Bucket of Blood, one of the best of all comedy-horrors, while William Castle also keeps his tongue in his cheek with the gimmicky House on Haunted Hill and The Tingler. Ed Wood’s cult film Plan 9 from Outer Space, which features the last performance from Bela Lugosi, is also released. The sometimes horrorthemed television series The Twilight Zone begins; it runs until 1964. 1960 France: Roger Vadim’s Et mourir de plaisir (Blood and Roses) is an artful version of Sheridan LeFanu’s Carmilla. Germany: Der Rächer (The Avenger) is an early entry in a series of Edgar Wallace adaptations that often incorporate horror-like material and imagery. Great Britain: Hammer’s The Brides of Dracula and The Two Faces of Dr. Jekyll continue its production of gothic horrors. The non-Hammer contemporary-set Circus of Horrors and Peeping Tom are gaudier affairs, while the SF/horror Village of the Damned develops the theme of monstrous children. City of the Dead (Horror Hotel) is writer-producer Milton Subotsky’s first horror credit; he will subsequently become a significant figure in British horror. Italy: Mario Bava’s stylish witchcraft film La maschera del demonio (The Mask of Satan, Revenge of the Vampire, Black Sunday) begins a cycle of Italian horror and makes a star out of British actor Barbara Steele. Il mulino delle donne di pietra (Mill of the Stone Women) is an impressive Italian/French co-production. United States: A prolific Roger Corman directs The Wasp Woman and the comedy-horror The Little Shop of Horrors. More significant is his direction\n\nCHRONOLOGY\n\n• xix\n\nof the Edgar Allan Poe adaptation House of Usher, which stars Vincent Price and which leads to a cycle of further Poe films. Alfred Hitchcock’s Psycho is an influential serial killer drama. By contrast, William Castle’s 13 Ghosts offers more gimmicks and a silly story. 1961 Germany: Die Toten Augen von London (The Dead Eyes of London) is one of the best of the horror-themed Edgar Wallace films. Great Britain: Hammer releases what will be its only werewolf film, The Curse of the Werewolf, and also begins a cycle of Psycho-like thrillers with Taste of Fear (Scream of Fear). In contrast, Jack Clayton directs The Innocents, a classy adaptation of Henry James’s ghost story The Turn of the Screw. Italy: Mario Bava’s Ercole al centro della terra (Hercules in the Haunted World) is one of several musclemen movies that incorporate horror imagery. Mexico: Santo contra los zombies (Santo vs. the Zombies) is the first of many films in which masked wrestlers take on horror monsters, including vampires, werewolves and Frankenstein’s monster. United States: Roger Corman’s second Poe film is Pit and the Pendulum, which stars Vincent Price and Barbara Steele. William Castle maintains the jokier tradition in American horror with Homicidal and Mr. Sardonicus. 1962 Germany: The horror-themed Edgar Wallace cycle continues with Das Rätsel der roten Orchidee (The Secret of the Red Orchid) and Die Tür mit den 7 Schlössern (The Door with Seven Locks). Great Britain: The commercial failure of Hammer’s The Phantom of the Opera temporarily slows down the company’s gothic horror cycle. From elsewhere, Night of the Eagle (Burn, Witch, Burn!) is a superior witchcraft film. Italy: Riccardo Freda’s morbid L’orribile segreto del Dr. Hichcock (The Horrible Dr. Hichcock, The Terrible Secret of Dr. Hichcock) is one of Barbara Steele’s best films. Meanwhile, Mario Bava directs what is often considered to be the first giallo-style psychological horror, La ragazza che sapeva troppo (The Girl Who Knew Too Much, The Evil Eye). Spain: Jesus Franco introduces horror into Spain with the gory surgery-based drama Gritos en la noche (The Awful Dr. Orloff), although full-scale Spanish horror production does not commence until later in the 1960s. United States: Roger Corman adds The Premature Burial and Tales of Terror to the Poe cycle, while the idiosyncratic Carnival of Souls is a ghost story with a final plot twist that will later be re-used by numerous other ghost stories. Bette Davis\n\nxx •\n\nCHRONOLOGY\n\nand Joan Crawford, both in full-on grotesque mode, star in Robert Aldrich’s grand guignol thriller What Ever Happened to Baby Jane? 1963 Great Britain: Hammer delivers Don Sharp’s stylish period horror The Kiss of the Vampire and continues its psychological thriller cycle with Maniac and Paranoiac. Robert Wise’s ghost story The Haunting, shot in Britain for MGM, is also released. Ireland: Francis Ford Coppola makes his genre debut with Dementia 13 (The Haunted and the Hunted), shot in Ireland for Roger Corman. Italy: It is a good year for Italian horror with Mario Bava’s La frusta et il corpo (The Whip and the Body) and I tre volti della paura (Black Sabbath), Riccardo Freda’s Lo spettro (The Ghost), and Antonio Margheriti’s La vergine di Norimberga (The Virgin of Nuremberg, Horror Castle) all released. United States: Alfred Hitchcock’s The Birds is an ambitious revenge-of-nature horror. Exploitation specialist Herschell Gordon Lewis introduces an unprecedented level of gore into Blood Feast. Roger Corman directs The Haunted Palace, which is marketed as a Poe adaptation although it is actually based on a H. P. Lovecraft story, and the charming comedy-horror The Raven. More laughs are provided by Jerry Lewis’s The Nutty Professor, a comedy version of the Jekyll and Hyde story. 1964 Brazil: Director and actor José Mojica Marins begins his controversial career in horror with the confrontational À meia-noite levarei sua alma (At Midnight I Will Take Your Soul). Great Britain: Hammer’s gothic output includes the routine The Curse of the Mummy’s Tomb and The Evil of Frankenstein, as well as Terence Fisher’s innovative The Gorgon and the psychological thriller Nightmare. Dr. Terror’s House of Horrors is the first of a series of horror anthologies produced by the Amicus company, Hammer’s main rival in the British horror market for the next ten years. American director Roger Corman makes two of the best films of his Poe cycle in Britain—The Masque of the Red Death and The Tomb of Ligeia. Italy: Horror specialist Antonio Margheriti directs two of Barbara Steele’s finest films, Danza macabra (Castle of Blood) and I lunghi capelli della morte (The Long Hair of Death), while Mario Bava is responsible for the seminal giallo thriller Sei donne per l’assassino (Blood and Black Lace). Japan: The upmarket ghost stories Kaidan (Kwaidan) and Onibaba make an international impact. United States: Herschell Gordon Lewis offers more extreme gore in\n\nCHRONOLOGY\n\n• xxi\n\nTwo Thousand Maniacs, and Robert Aldrich and William Castle more grand guignol in, respectively, Hush... Hush, Sweet Charlotte and Strait-Jacket. Ray Steckler’s strikingly titled cult horror The Incredibly Strange Creatures Who Stopped Living and Became Mixed-Up Zombies is also released. 1965 Great Britain: Hammer releases two of its best horror-themed psychological thrillers in Fanatic (Die! Die! My Darling!) and The Nanny. Christopher Lee stars as Fu Manchu in The Face of Fu Manchu, the first of a series. Amicus’s The Skull is a superior contemporary-set horror, while Roman Polanski’s Repulsion, the director’s first Englishlanguage film, is a clinical and disturbing study of insanity. On a more escapist note, Sherlock Holmes meets Jack the Ripper for the first time in A Study in Terror. Italy: Mario Bava’s SF/horror Terrore nello spazio (Planet of the Vampires) will be yet another influence on Ridley Scott’s 1979 film Alien. 1966 Great Britain: Dracula—Prince of Darkness, The Plague of the Zombies, and The Reptile are three of Hammer’s best period horrors; other Hammer releases include Rasputin: The Mad Monk and The Witches. The Amicus psychological thriller The Psychopath revisits some of the themes from Psycho. Italy: Mario Bava’s Operazione paura (Kill, Baby…Kill!) is an impressive ghost story, while the young British director Michael Reeves makes his debut with La sorella di satana (Revenge of the Blood Beast, The She Beast). Spain: The television horror series Historias para no dormir (Stories to Keep You Awake) is a popular success and runs until 1968. United States: Dan Curtis’s daytime television soap Dark Shadows incorporates horror characters; it runs until 1971. In cinema, Billy the Kid versus Dracula provides one of the genre’s sillier titles. 1967 Great Britain: It is another impressive year for Hammer period horror with Frankenstein Created Woman and the SF/horror Quatermass and the Pit (Five Million Years to Earth), although The Mummy’s Shroud is less successful. Roman Polanski’s Dance of the Vampires (The Fearless Vampire Killers) is a stylish, and in places disturbing, comedy-horror, while Carry on Screaming offers more vulgar horror-themed laughs. Michael Reeves builds on the promise shown in his first film with the London-set The Sorcerers, and Torture Garden is\n\nxxii •\n\nCHRONOLOGY\n\na superior anthology from Amicus. Other British horrors include the surgery-based Corruption and the Lovecraft adaptation The Shuttered Room. United States: Herschell Gordon Lewis’s The Gruesome Twosome and Jean Yarbrough’s Hillbillys in a Haunted House make for an undistinguished year for American horror, although Curtis Harrington’s horror-themed psychological thriller Games is noteworthy. 1968 France: The cult director Jean Rollin makes his genre debut with Le viol du vampire (The Rape of the Vampire). Great Britain: Terence Fisher’s The Devil Rides Out and Michael Reeves’ third and final film Witchfinder General are two of the finest of all British horrors. Less impressive are Curse of the Crimson Altar and Dracula Has Risen from the Grave. Philippines: The mad scientist film Mad Doctor of Blood Island demonstrates that older forms of horror still retain popularity. Spain: Actor Jacinto Molina, who often works under the name “Paul Naschy,” makes his genre debut as werewolf Count Waldemar Daninsky in La marca del hombre-lobo (The Mark of the Werewolf). He goes on to play the part in several sequels as well as starring in numerous other Spanish horrors. United States: This is a key year in the development of modern American horror with the release of George Romero’s Night of the Living Dead, Roman Polanski’s Rosemary’s Baby and Peter Bogdanovich’s Targets and the introduction of a film rating system that formally recognizes the possibility of “adult-only” films. 1969 Great Britain: Terence Fisher’s Frankenstein Must Be Destroyed is an impressive traditional Hammer horror, while Gordon Hessler’s The Oblong Box and Scream and Scream Again confirm the emergence of new youthful talent in British horror. Boris Karloff dies on 2 February. Italy: Mario Bava’s Un hacha para la luna de miel (Hatchet for the Honeymoon) innovatively combines a giallo with a ghost story. Spain: La residencia (The Finishing School, The House that Screamed) is a substantial commercial success for Spanish horror. 1970 Germany: Michael Armstrong directs Hexen bis aufs Blut gequält (Mark of the Devil), a violent and controversial witch hunter drama. Great Britain: The youth-friendly Taste the Blood of Dracula and the explicit female nudity in The Vampire Lovers suggest a change in Hammer’s approach, although The Horror of Frankenstein and Scars\n\nCHRONOLOGY\n\n• xxiii\n\nof Dracula are less successful attempts at innovation. Gordon Hessler’s Cry of the Banshee is a confident supernatural drama, and Amicus produces another effective horror anthology, The House That Dripped Blood, along with a weak Jekyll and Hyde adaptation, I, Monster. Italy: Dario Argento makes his directorial debut with the giallo L’uccello dalle piume di cristallo (The Bird with the Crystal Plumage, The Gallery Murders). Initially dubbed the Italian Hitchcock, he will go on to become one of Europe’s leading horror directors. Spain: Christopher Lee stars as a mustachioed Dracula in Jesus Franco’s indifferent El Conde Dracula (Count Dracula). United States: Count Yorga, Vampire introduces a Hammer-style vampire into contemporary American settings, and The Dunwich Horror is a stylish adaptation of an H. P. Lovecraft story. 1971 Belgium: Harry Kümel’s lesbian vampire film Le rouge aux lèvres (Daughters of Darkness) combines genre conventions with an art-house sensibility. Great Britain: New innovations continue to appear in British horror, including Hammer’s revisionary Blood from the Mummy’s Tomb, Countess Dracula, Dr. Jekyll and Sister Hyde, and Hands of the Ripper and the more obviously exploitative lesbian vampire films Lust for a Vampire and Twins of Evil. From other companies come the tongue-in-cheek The Abominable Dr. Phibes and Psychomania, along with the disturbing rural horror Blood on Satan’s Claw (Satan’s Skin) and Ken Russell’s controversial witch hunter epic The Devils. Italy: Some impressive Italian giallo films are released, among them Dario Argento’s Il gatto a nove code (The Cat o’ Nine Tails) and 4 mosche di velluto grigio (Four Flies on Grey Velvet), Mario Bava’s Reazione a catena (Ecologia del delitto, Twitch of the Death Nerve, Bay of Blood), and Lucio Fulci’s Una lucertola con la pelle di donna (A Lizard in a Woman’s Skin). Spain: Amando de Ossorio’s La noche del terror ciego (Tombs of the Blind Dead, The Blind Dead) begins a cycle of four films about undead Knights Templar threatening the modern world. United States: Modern vampire stories prove popular, with Night of Dark Shadows, The Omega Man, The Return of Count Yorga, and The Velvet Vampire all being released. The rural horror Let’s Scare Jessica to Death, the possession drama The Mephisto Waltz, and the rat story Willard also make an impression.\n\nxxiv •\n\nCHRONOLOGY\n\n1972 Great Britain: The cannibalism film Death Line (Raw Meat) imaginatively combines British and American horror themes. Hammer brings Dracula to contemporary London in Dracula AD 1972 and offers a critique of the family in Demons of the Mind, while Amicus comes up with two quality horror anthologies, Asylum and Tales from the Crypt. Italy: Mario Bava, now nearly at the end of his career, directs two impressive horrors, Gli orrori del castello di Nuremberg (Baron Blood) and Lisa e il diavolo (Lisa and the Devil), and Lucio Fulci, who is relatively new to the genre, is responsible for the innovative rural giallo Non si sevizia un paperino (Don’t Torture a Duckling). Spain: Jacinto Molina plays a hunchback in one of his best known films, El jorobado de la morgue (Hunchback of the Morgue), while genre specialist León Klimovsky directs the atmospheric La orgía nocturna de los vampiros (Vampire’s Night Orgy). Also released is La novia ensangrentada (The Blood-Spattered Bride), seen by some critics as a powerful critique of machismo values. United States: Wes Craven makes his horror debut with the disturbing rape-revenge drama The Last House on the Left. More somber horror is provided by The Other and The Possession of Joel Delaney. Frogs is a relatively serious revenge of nature horror while Night of the Lepus—about giant rabbits—is a silly one. John Boorman’s Deliverance is also released; it is not a horror film as such but it provides a template for later rural horrors. Slightly more lighthearted are the blaxploitation production Blacula and the zombie film Children Shouldn’t Play with Dead Things. Meanwhile, the vampire story The Night Stalker receives the highest ever ratings for a television film. 1973 Germany: Ulli Lommel’s Die zärtlichkeit der Wölfe (The Tenderness of Wolves) is a disturbing serial killer film that refers back to Fritz Lang’s M (1931). Great Britain: The period horror cycle is winding down, although And Now the Screaming Starts! and The Creeping Flesh are creditable late entries. Amicus offers its two final horror anthologies From Beyond the Grave and The Vault of Horror, Hammer concludes its Dracula cycle with The Satanic Rites of Dracula, and British horror sends up its established formats in Horror Hospital and Theater of Blood. New approaches are also emerging. The ghost story Don’t Look Now, the pagan-themed thriller The Wicker Man and the demonic haunted house drama The Legend of Hell House all suggest new\n\nCHRONOLOGY\n\n• xxv\n\nways forward for the British version of the genre. Italy: Former Andy Warhol-collaborator Paul Morrissey camps up the Frankenstein story in Flesh for Frankenstein. Spain: The eerie psychological thriller La campana del infierno (The Bell from Hell) and the period horror Pánico en el Transiberiano (Horror Express) are impressive contributions to European horror. United States: The main event is the release of the phenomenally successful The Exorcist. Other interesting work is done by George Romero (The Crazies) and Brian De Palma (Sisters). Blaxploitation horror continues with Blackenstein, Ganja & Hess and Scream, Blacula, Scream, and John Landis makes his directorial debut with Schlock. Television provides revisionary versions of classic movie monsters in Dracula and Frankenstein: The True Story. Lon Chaney Jr. dies on 12 July. 1974 Australia: Peter Weir incorporates American horror themes into an Australian landscape in The Cars That Ate Paris. Canada: Bob Clark directs the proto-slasher film Black Christmas. Great Britain: Hammer’s period horror cycle finally comes to an end with Captain Kronos —Vampire Hunter, Frankenstein and the Monster from Hell (which is also Terence Fisher’s final film) and the kung fu horror The Legend of the Seven Golden Vampires. Pete Walker’s nihilistic House of Whipcord and Frightmare and José Larraz’s sensual Vampyres offer a type of horror more in keeping with the times. Italy: Paul Morrissey follows up Flesh for Frankenstein (1973) with the equally over-the-top Blood for Dracula. L’anticristo (The Antichrist) and Chi sei (Beyond the Door, The Devil Within Her) are the first of many attempts to cash in on the success of The Exorcist (1973). Spain: Non si deve profanare il sonno dei morti (The Living Dead at the Manchester Morgue) is a striking and gruesome zombie film, shot largely in Britain. United States: Larry Cohen’s It’s Alive! and Tobe Hooper’s The Texas Chain Saw Massacre engage with the family horror theme. Deranged is a gory, thinly fictionalized account of Ed Gein, Brian De Palma’s Phantom of the Paradise is a more playful treatment of horror material, while Abby and Sugar Hill are blaxploitation projects. Mel Brooks’ Young Frankenstein is an affectionate, and very funny, tribute to classic horror of the 1930s. 1975 Canada: David Cronenberg makes his horror debut with The Parasite Murders (They Came From Within, Shivers). Great Britain: By this stage the kind of period horror offered by Legend of the Werewolf\n\nxxvi •\n\nCHRONOLOGY\n\nseems anachronistic. Pete Walker’s House of Mortal Sin (The Confessional) is a more convincing expression of the troubled 1970s. I Don’t Want to Be Born (The Devil Within Her) is another Exorcist-influenced possession story, while the horror musical The Rocky Horror Picture Show is not initially a success but later becomes a significant cult phenomenon. Italy: Dario Argento directs Profondo rosso (Deep Red), which takes his work emphatically into the horror genre. United States: Steven Spielberg’s Jaws draws upon old horror films for inspiration. In comparison, the more conventional horrors Bug and The Devil’s Rain seem tame, although Race with the Devil is an effective combination of horror and road movie. 1976 Great Britain: Hammer releases its last horror film (to date at least), To the Devil a Daughter. Also released are Norman J. Warren’s Satan’s Slave and Pete Walker’s Schizo. Italy: Pupi Avati’s La casa dalle finestre che ridono (The House of the Laughing Windows) is one of the more unusual giallo films. United States: The key horror films are Brian De Palma’s adaptation of Stephen King’s Carrie and the apocalyptic thriller The Omen; both are substantial successes. Less spectacular but in their own more modest ways intelligent and worthwhile are Burnt Offerings, Communion (Alice Sweet Alice), God Told Me To (Demon), and Squirm. 1977 Australia: Peter Weir provides a compelling Australian version of apocalyptic horror with The Last Wave. Canada: Rabid, David Cronenberg’s second horror film, develops his distinctive vision. Italy: Dario Argento’s witchcraft drama Suspiria is his biggest international commercial success, while Mario Bava directs his last horror film, the ghost story Schock (Shock, Beyond the Door II). Holocaust 2000 is a more routine attempt to emulate the success of The Omen (1976). United States: Wes Craven’s The Hills Have Eyes proves more audience-friendly than his earlier Last House on the Left (1972), while George Romero’s Martin is one of the most important of all modernday vampire stories, and Tobe Hooper’s Eaten Alive (Death Trap) is a strange but compelling piece of Southern Gothic. The misconceived Exorcist II: The Heretic is a commercial disaster. By contrast, Robert Wise’s Audrey Rose is a superior possession drama that offers quiet thrills rather than the more customary blood and thunder, and Curtis\n\nCHRONOLOGY\n\n• xxvii\n\nHarrington’s Ruby is also a modest but effective ghost story. Day of the Animals and The Sentinel are more conventional. 1978 Australia: A mini-cycle of Australian horror continues with the revenge-of-nature drama The Long Weekend and the telekinesis thriller Patrick. United States: George Romero’s Dawn of the Dead redefines the cinematic zombie and John Carpenter’s Halloween inaugurates the slasher cycle (as well as making a star out of Jamie Lee Curtis). There is a thoughtful remake of Invasion of the Body Snatchers and good sequels to both It’s Alive (1974) and The Omen (1976). Joe Dante makes his horror debut with Piranha. The low-budget rape-revenge drama I Spit On Your Grave is not much noticed at the time but it will become notorious later as part of the British Video Nasties scare of the early 1980s. 1979 Canada: David Cronenberg creates a horror version of Kramer versus Kramer with The Brood. Germany: Werner Herzog remakes the 1922 Nosferatu as Nosferatu: Phantom der Nacht (Nosferatu the Vampyre). Great Britain: Bob Clark turns the Jack the Ripper story into a political conspiracy and throws in Sherlock Holmes for good measure in Murder by Decree. Italy: Lucio Fulci directs Zombi 2 (Zombie Flesheaters), an unauthorized follow-up to George Romero’s Dawn of the Dead (1978). Numerous gory zombie films will follow. United States: More revisionary vampires feature in Dracula, which stars Frank Langella as the Count, Love at First Bite and Tobe Hooper’s television production of Stephen King’s Salem’s Lot. The Amityville Horror is a successful haunted house story, Alien combines horror with science fiction, Phantasm is a cult oddity, and When a Stranger Calls is an early example of urban legend horror. 1980 Great Britain: Hammer, now under new management, produces the television horror series Hammer House of Horror. Italy: Graphic nastiness of the zombie and cannibal kind features in Apocalypse domani (Cannibal Apocalypse), Cannibal Holocaust, and Incubo sulla città contaminata (Nightmare City). Lucio Fulci’s Paura nella città dei morti viventi (City of the Living Dead) is just as gory but considerably more stylish. In Inferno, Dario Argento offers a sequel of sorts to Suspiria (1977). Lamberto Bava, son of Mario, makes his directorial debut with the atmospheric psychological thriller Macabro (Macabre).\n\nxxviii •\n\nCHRONOLOGY\n\nUnited States: Friday the 13th is critically disliked but very popular with teenage audiences; it inaugurates one of the major horror franchises of the 1980s. Other slashers include the Jamie Lee Curtis vehicles Prom Night and Terror Train. These, along with Brian De Palma’s self-consciously Hitchcockian thriller Dressed to Kill, inspire a public debate about violence against women in film. John Carpenter’s The Fog is an atmospheric ghost story, while Stanley Kubrick’s monumental The Shining confuses many on its initial release but has since come to be considered by many as one of the greatest of all horror films. 1981 Canada: David Cronenberg’s Scanners turns out to be a more audience-friendly affair than his previous grimmer work in the genre. Italy: L’aldilà (The Beyond) and Quella villa accanto al cimitero (The House by the Cemetery) are key films from Lucio Fulci, combining gore with an intensely dream-like atmosphere. United States: John Landis’s An American Werewolf in London and Joe Dante’s The Howling reinvent the cinematic werewolf and together represent a significant step forward in special effects technology. Sam Raimi’s The Evil Dead joins gory horror with slapstick, while sequels to Friday the 13th (1980) and Halloween (1978), along with Hell Night, keep the slasher cycle going. The Final Conflict, the third entry in the Omen cycle, is also released, as are interesting films from Tobe Hooper (The Funhouse) and Wes Craven (Deadly Blessing). 1982 Italy: Dario Argento directs Tenebre (Tenebrae), considered by some to be one of the greatest of all giallo films. United States: John Carpenter’s impressive The Thing is not a commercial success, although it later becomes a cult classic. Tobe Hooper’s Poltergeist is more popular. Paul Schrader remakes the 1942 version of Cat People and George Romero directs Stephen King’s comic-influenced Creepshow, and there are more sequels to Friday the 13th and Halloween, along with other slashers, including The House on Sorority Row and The Slumber Party Massacre. In defiance of market trends, Larry Cohen makes the eccentric Q—the Winged Serpent. 1983 Canada: David Cronenberg directs Videodrome, one of his more challenging and obscure films. Great Britain: Pete Walker, master of grim British horror, directs his last film, the surprisingly gentle and nostalgic House of the Long Shadows, which features horror icons\n\nCHRONOLOGY\n\n• xxix\n\nJohn Carradine, Peter Cushing, Christopher Lee, and Vincent Price. United States: Adaptations of Stephen King novels prove particularly popular, with John Carpenter making Christine, Lewis Teague directing Cujo and David Cronenberg responsible for The Dead Zone. Richard Franklin revives the Psycho story with Psycho II; more sequels will follow. 1984 Great Britain: Neil Jordan’s The Company of Wolves is an ambitious and innovative werewolf film drawing upon the writings of Angela Carter. United States: Wes Craven’s A Nightmare on Elm Street is the first in what will be the most commercially successful horror cycle of the 1980s; it will generate seven sequels. Re-animator combines gore and comedy in a manner akin to that of the Evil Dead films, while more family-friendly comedy-horror is offered by Ghostbusters and Joe Dante’s Gremlins. 1985 Italy: Lamberto Bava directs and Dario Argento produces the slick Euro-horror Demoni (Demons); Argento also directs the innovative giallo Phenomena. United States: George Romero directs Day of the Dead, the third in his Living Dead series, with less serious zombie fare coming from Dan O’Bannon’s comedy-horror The Return of the Living Dead. More tongue in cheek horror can be found in the vampire film Fright Night and Larry Cohen’s satirical The Stuff. 1986 United States: James Cameron combines action, science fiction and horror in Aliens, and David Cronenberg has one of his biggest commercial successes with his remake of the 1950s monster movie The Fly. The serial killer also makes an impact in Michael Mann’s Manhunter, an adaptation of Thomas Harris’s novel Red Dragon which introduces the character of Hannibal Lecter, and in John Naughton’s grim Henry— Portrait of a Serial Killer. 1987 Germany: Jörg Buttgereit’s Nekromantik is a confrontational, necrophilia-themed low-budget horror project. Great Britain: Clive Barker makes his directorial debut with Hellraiser, a striking horror influenced by sadomasochistic iconography. Italy: The talented director Michele Soavi debuts with Deliria (Stagefright, Bloody Bird), while Dario Argento directs the equally theatrical Opera (Terror at the Opera). New Zealand: The comedy-horror Bad Taste is yet another directorial debut, this time from Peter Jackson. United States: Idiosyncratic genre\n\nxxx •\n\nCHRONOLOGY\n\nfare is provided by Kathryn Bigelow’s inventive vampire-western film Near Dark, John Carpenter’s Lovecraftian Prince of Darkness and Joseph Ruben’s family horror The Stepfather, while a more straightforward action/SF/horror combination is offered by the Arnold Schwarzenegger vehicle Predator. 1988 Canada: David Cronenberg continues to develop his own very personal type of cinematic horror with the gynecology themed Dead Ringers. United States: Two minor horror cycles commence with the release of Child’s Play and Maniac Cop. Wes Craven directs the revisionary voodoo film The Serpent and the Rainbow. 1989 Japan: The cyberpunk science fiction/horror Tetsuo contains some groundbreaking body horror imagery. United States: The satirical cannibalism drama Parents and the body-horror epic Society provide off-beat genre thrills, while Mary Lambert’s Pet Sematary is a more straightforward Stephen King adaptation. The anthology television horror show Tales from the Crypt begins; it runs until 1996. 1990 Great Britain: Nightbreed, Clive Barker’s ambitious follow-up to Hellraiser, is not a success. Italy: Dario Argento and George Romero collaborate on the Poe project Due occhi diabolici (Two Evil Eyes). United States: William Peter Blatty directs The Exorcist III, Tom Savini remakes Night of the Living Dead, and Roger Corman returns to direction after a long absence with Frankenstein Unbound. 1991 United States: The Silence of the Lambs is a box-office smash and wins several Academy Awards, including for Jodie Foster, director Jonathan Demme, and for Anthony Hopkins as the cannibalistic psychiatrist Hannibal Lecter. Wes Craven directs the socially critical The People Under the Stairs, one of his best films. 1992 New Zealand: Peter Jackson’s Braindead takes comedy-horror onto a new level of gore. United States: Candyman explores racial politics from within a horror idiom, Buffy the Vampire Slayer relocates vampires within a high school setting, and Francis Ford Coppola directs a blockbusting new version of Dracula featuring Gary Oldman as the Count and Anthony Hopkins as Van Helsing. Alien 3 is the grimmest entry to the Alien cycle.\n\nCHRONOLOGY\n\n• xxxi\n\n1993 Mexico: Guillermo del Toro makes his directorial debut with Cronos, an innovative vampire film. United States: Two more Stephen King adaptations appear, Needful Things and George Romero’s The Dark Half. Tim Burton produces the horror-themed animation The Nightmare Before Christmas. The horror-influenced television series The X Files begins; it runs until 2002 and also generates a cinema film. Vincent Price dies on 25 October. 1994 Great Britain: Peter Cushing dies on 11 August. Italy: Michele Soavi directs his best film, the zombie drama Dellamorte dellamore (Cemetery Man). United States: Big-budget horror includes Neil Jordan’s adaptation of Anne Rice’s Interview with the Vampire, a version of Frankenstein starring Robert De Niro as the Monster, and the Jack Nicholson werewolf drama Wolf. Ed Wood is Tim Burton’s tribute to the film director and features an Academy Award-winning performance from Martin Landau as Bela Lugosi. Wes Craven returns to the Nightmare on Elm Street cycle with the intensely self-reflexive New Nightmare. The Crow’s offering of morbid gothic is underlined by the accidental death of its star, Brandon Lee, during filming. 1995 Spain: El día de la bestia (Day of the Beast) is a stylish horror from a national cinema that has produced little horror since the 1970s. United States: Dark serial killer films prove popular with the release of Copycat and Seven. In the Mouth of Madness and Vampire in Brooklyn are the latest from, respectively, John Carpenter and Wes Craven. Dracula —Dead and Loving It is a crude Mel Brooks spoof that seeks to recapture the glory of Young Frankenstein (1974), while Species combines science fiction and horror in Alien-style. 1996 Spain: Alejandro Amenabar’s Tesis, which deals with snuff movies, is an impressive feature debut. United States: Peter Jackson comes to Hollywood to make the comedy-horror The Frighteners, Robert Rodriguez combines crime and horror effectively in From Dusk Till Dawn, Mary Reilly is an upmarket revision of the Jekyll and Hyde story, and John Frankenheimer provides an eccentric version of The Island of Dr. Moreau that stars Marlon Brando in the title role. However, the main horror film of note is Wes Craven’s Scream, which cleverly combines slasher conventions with generic in-jokes. Sequels and other teenage horror films wanting to cash in on its success inevitably follow.\n\nxxxii •\n\nCHRONOLOGY\n\n1997 United States: I Know What You Did Last Summer is an effective Scream-like film, while Wes Craven directs Scream 2. Guillermo del Toro makes his American debut with Mimic, a giant insect story. Alien: Resurrection is the final (to date) film in the Alien cycle (although AVP: Alien versus Predator shows up in 2004). The horrorthemed television series Buffy the Vampire Slayer begins; it runs until 2003 and also generates a spin-off series, Angel. 1998 Japan: Hideo Nakata’s Ringu is a breakthrough international success for Japanese horror; it will lead to sequels and remakes and encourage the development of a broader East Asian horror cinema. United States: A preoccupation with horror’s past becomes apparent. Black horror is triumphantly revived with the urban vampire drama Blade, Halloween H20: 20 Years Later is a clever sequel that brings Jamie Lee Curtis back to the cycle, and Gods and Monsters is a fine biopic dealing with James Whale, director of the 1931 Frankenstein. More eccentric is Gus van Sant’s remake of Psycho. The Last Broadcast, a mock documentary about a folk legend, is little noticed at the time, although it does seem to anticipate themes more successfully addressed by the following year’s Blair Witch Project. Other Scream-like horrors include I Still Know What You Did Last Summer and Urban Legend. 1999 Japan: The development of Japanese horror continues with Ringu 2 and Takashi Miike’s shocking, torture-based Ôdishon (Audition). Korea: The release of The Ring Virus, a version of the Ringu story, along with the evocative ghost story Yeogo goedam II (Memento Mori) highlight the development of a distinctive North Korean horror cinema. United States: Two supernatural dramas capture the public attention. The mock documentary The Blair Witch Project makes highly effective use of internet marketing, while The Sixth Sense offers the chills of an old-fashioned ghost story topped by a much-discussed plot twist. Other ghost stories—including remakes of House on Haunted Hill (1959) and The Haunting (1963)—are less impressive. Arnold Schwarzenegger takes on the Devil in the millennial End of Days, Stephen Sommers directs the action-horror The Mummy, Antonia Bird is responsible for the cannibalism horror-western Ravenous, and Tim Burton’s Sleepy Hollow is a handsome period horror. Roman Polanski’s Spanish-French-American production The Ninth Gate offers an altogether more idiosyncratic take on horror themes.\n\nCHRONOLOGY\n\n• xxxiii\n\n2000 France: Promenons-nous dans les bois (Deep in the Woods) and the serial killer drama Les rivières pourpres (The Crimson Rivers) offer a distinctively French take on horror conventions. Germany: The surgical horror Anatomie does something similar for Germany, cleverly relating its narrative to German history. United States: Wes Craven concludes the Scream trilogy, Scary Movie sends up the Scream films, and Cherry Falls and Final Destination demonstrate that there is still life in the teenage horror formula. Robert Zemeckis’s What Lies Beneath is an intelligent big budget ghost story, Lost Souls a noisy millennial thriller, and Ed Gein a disturbing account of the real-life serial killer who inspired several horror films. The international co-production Shadow of the Vampire deals with the production of the 1922 Nosferatu and speculates that the actor who played the vampire was actually a vampire. 2001 France: Le pacte des loups (The Brotherhood of the Wolf) successfully combines horror elements with period drama, while Trouble Every Day is an artier exploration of the cannibalism theme. Great Britain: The Second World War supernatural drama The Bunker is an early sign of a revival of the British horror film. Spain: The Fantastic Factory company is established to produce English-language horror films in Spain. Early examples of its products are Dagon and Faust. Guillermo del Toro directs the ghost story El espinazo del diablo (The Devil’s Backbone). Tuno negro is a distinctly Spanish version of the Scream films. United States: Jack the Ripper returns in From Hell, Hannibal Lecter returns in Hannibal, and Friday the 13th killer Jason is sent into outer space in Jason X, which, as the title suggests, is the tenth film in the cycle. Alejandro Amenabar’s international production The Others is a worthy addition to the fast developing ghost story cycle, while Jeepers Creepers is an inventive monster movie. 2002 China: The Hong Kong-Singapore production Gin gwai (The Eye) is another international success for East Asian horror. Great Britain: The release of First World War horror Deathwatch, werewolf drama Dog Soldiers, the psychological thriller My Little Eye, the apocalyptic thriller 28 Days Later and the international co-production Resident Evil confirm the renaissance of the British horror film. Japan: Hideo Nakata’s Honogurai mizu no soko kara (Dark Water) is another successful example of East Asian horror. United States: The influence\n\nxxxiv •\n\nCHRONOLOGY\n\nof East Asian horror is felt, both in the American remake The Ring and in the Japan-style internet horror FeardotCom. Hannibal Lecter returns for the remake Red Dragon, the comedy-horror Scooby Doo gets a liveaction makeover, and the gruesome low budget Cabin Fever suggests that a new toughness has entered American horror. By contrast, Bubba Ho-tep is an enjoyably eccentric affair in which Elvis Presley takes on a mummy. 2003 France: Alexandre Aja directs Haute tension (High Tension, Switchblade Romance), a slasher that manages to be stylish, gory and iconoclastic. Japan: Ju-On: The Grudge is the latest international success to come from Japanese horror. United States: Freddy vs. Jason is the latest in the Friday the 13th and Halloween cycles. Rock musician Rob Zombie makes his directorial debut with the 1970s-style horror House of 1000 Corpses; more references to the 1970s crop up in the remake of The Texas Chainsaw Massacre (1974) and the rural horror Wrong Turn. 2004 France: Calvaire (The Ordeal) is an effective rural horror. Great Britain: The revival of British horror continues with the London Underground-based Creep. Korea: The North Korean production R-Point combines an evocative ghost story with an account of Korean involvement in the Vietnam war.

It was the fate of most of Universal’s horror monsters of the 1930s and 1940s to end up in the hands of comedy performers Bud Abbott and Lou Costello. The duo had already encountered horror material in the haunted house spoof Hold That Ghost (1941), and from the late 1940s onwards comedy-horror formed an important part of their output. These films have not been valued highly by horror historians who have tended to view them as the embarrassing last gasp of Universal horror. However, they do contain some inventive scenes and they also underline the undeniable fact that horror and comedy sit very close to each other in the cultural spectrum. The best of them was Abbott and Costello Meet Frankenstein (1948). This continued the multiple-monster format established by Universal in the early 1940s by featuring Dracula, the Wolf Man, Frankenstein’s monster and—in a brief cameo—the Invisible Man (although oddly, given the film’s title, Frankenstein himself did not appear). The film is of historic significance inasmuch as it houses final performances from Bela Lugosi as Dracula and Lon Chaney Jr. as the Wolf Man. But it is also a funny film that plays interesting and clever games with Universal’s horror myths, noting their absurdity when placed in a contemporary American setting while also acknowledging their continuing power to fascinate. Abbott and Costello’s subsequent comedy-horrors offered progressively less but they remain essential viewing for horror aficionados. They are Abbott and Costello Meet the Killer, Boris Karloff (1949), Abbott and Costello Meet the Invisible Man (1951), Abbott and\n\n1\n\n2 •\n\nAJA, ALEXANDRE\n\nCostello Meet Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde (1953), and Abbott and Costello Meet the Mummy (1955). See also AMERICAN HORROR. AJA, ALEXANDRE (1978– ). The French director Alexandre Aja made a striking horror debut with his slasher film Haute Tension (2003), which was released in the United States as High Tension and in some other markets under Aja’s preferred English language title Switchblade Romance. Horror fans applauded the stylish but hardedged treatment of a stock horror situation in which a resourceful young woman, or Final Girl, was stalked by an implacable male killer. They were generally less convinced by the film’s bizarre conclusion in which it was revealed that much of the narrative has been the extended fantasy of one of the characters in the film, although this development could be seen as an audacious and provocative upturning of our expectations. Aja has expressed his admiration for American horror, so it was unsurprising that his next film was the 2006 remake of Wes Craven’s 1970s classic The Hills Have Eyes. The ambivalence about violence evident in the original was replaced in the remake by a survivalist ruthlessness, and Aja handled both the relentless mayhem and the atmospheric desert setting with great skill. See also FRENCH HORROR. ALDRICH, ROBERT (1918–1983). The films of American director Robert Aldrich were often strident and confrontational, and his horror films were no exception. What Ever Happened to Baby Jane? (1962) and Hush . . . Hush, Sweet Charlotte (1964) were ostensibly psychological thriller-whodunnit combinations but the emphasis throughout was on the grotesque, especially as manifested in the form of older women of questionable sanity. In What Ever Happened to Baby Jane?, Bette Davis and Joan Crawford played parodies of their own screen personas; each would go on to make other horror films, with their performances tinged with a “Baby Jane” grotesquerie. Hush . . . Hush, Sweet Charlotte was an overheated example of Southern Gothic that offered yet another histrionic, scene-stealing turn from Davis. Both films displayed a fascination with the decay of classic Hollywood, its conventions and its performers. It was perhaps no coincidence that they appeared in the wake of Alfred Hitchcock’s Psycho (1960), a film that introduced an altogether more modern out-\n\nALIEN\n\n• 3\n\nlook not just into the American horror film but into mainstream cinema in general. ALIEN (1979). Dan O’Bannon’s screenplay for a science fiction/horror hybrid called Star Beast was originally intended as a low-budget production. Its eventual transformation into a stylish, expensive and much-imitated Ridley Scott film entitled Alien undoubtedly helped to secure both its international success and its lasting cult status. The narrative was simple—an alien monster stalks the hapless crew of a space freighter—and the film drew heavily on stock horror conventions. However, these were wrapped around an imaginative and detailed vision of a dystopian future, and the creature itself, as designed by H. R. Giger, was genuinely scary. The alien’s method of reproduction—which involved “impregnating” humans through the mouth, with the resulting baby ripping itself out of the victim’s stomach—was also memorably unpleasant. In addition, Alien helped to introduce the female hero into the horror genre. As played by Sigourney Weaver, the character of Ellen Ripley exhibited much of the courageous behavior also being shown in the late 1970s by the slasher film’s Final Girl, although at the same time Ripley was constantly defined through her biological nature. Indeed, the convoluted sexual politics of the film has attracted the attention of film critics and theorists ever since its release. Sequels followed, although not as rapidly as was the case elsewhere in horror cinema, and each sequel was markedly different from what had gone before in the series, with this reflecting the strong creative personalities of the directors involved. James Cameron’s militaristic Aliens (1986) increased the number of aliens and turned Ripley into a powerful Amazonian figure who fought the mother alien one-on-one in the film’s conclusion. By contrast, David Fincher’s Alien 3 (1992) was a moody drama set in a space prison into which a shaven-headed Ripley crashes. The film had a troubled production and initially was not well-received, although in retrospect its oppressive atmosphere and its relentlessly grim narrative seem more striking. Jean-Pierre Jeunet’s Alien: Resurrection (1997) was, to date at least, the last Ripley film. As stylish as previous entries, it explored the modish subjects of genetic engineering and cloning and generally seemed more interested in the Ripley character than it was in the\n\n4 •\n\nAMENABAR, ALEJANDRO\n\nincreasingly familiar figures of the aliens. Paul W. S. Anderson’s AVP: Alien versus Predator (2004) was a sidebar to the series rather than another sequel, offering a brand new set of characters taking on alien monsters. It was enthusiastically violent but added little to the Alien corpus. AMENABAR, ALEJANDRO (1972– ). The writer-director (and also film composer) Alejandro Amenabar was born in Chile but has worked mainly in Spain. Tesis (1996), his feature debut, was a stylish serial killer film about the production of snuff movies on a university campus which skillfully combined American genre conventions with a European sensibility. After a diversion into science fiction with Abre los ojos (Open Your Eyes) (1997)—which was subsequently remade as the Tom Cruise vehicle Vanilla Sky (2001)—he had a notable success with The Others (2001). Starring the Australian actor Nicole Kidman, set on the island of Jersey, shot in English but filmed largely in Spain, this was a truly international production that contributed to the cinematic revival of the ghost story that took place from the late 1990s onwards. Eschewing the updating process undertaken by films such as Ringu (Ring) (1998) and The Sixth Sense (1999), The Others opted for a more traditional, literary-based approach, and its stately pacing made the climactic shocks all the more effective. See also SPANISH HORROR. AMERICAN HORROR. The version of horror cinema produced within the United States of America has proved the most consistently popular and influential of all national horror cinemas. Other types of horror have occasionally challenged its supremacy—British horror in the late 1950s, for example—but none of these challenges have been sustained for any length of time. Some of the roots of American horror cinema as it developed from the 1930s onwards were in European cultural history rather than in American culture, for example in Europe’s gothic literary tradition (which has arguably been more influential on American horror than America’s own gothic literature) or in more recent cultural developments such as Surrealism and German Expressionism. Indeed, many of the key horror filmmakers in the 1930s, which was horror cinema’s first decade as a recognizable generic category, were\n\nAMERICAN HORROR\n\n• 5\n\nEuropean—including Karl Freund, Boris Karloff, Bela Lugosi, Edgar G. Ulmer, and James Whale. However, developments within American popular culture since World War I also anticipated and helped to form the horror to come. The films of Lon Chaney, for example, were made in an American idiom, even when they were set abroad. In addition, haunted house spoofs such as The Bat and The Cat and the Canary were popular on stage and screen, and helped to establish another distinctly American approach to horrifying events and experiences. The mixing of different traditions and influences entailed in the formation of American horror was very apparent in the film that is usually seen as inaugurating the 1930s horror boom, the Universal production of Dracula (1931), which was an adaptation of a Broadway adaptation of an English adaptation of a novel written by an Irish author. During the 1930s, horror became a staple cinematic category for the first time. Universal led the way with its Frankenstein and Dracula films, along with a range of other productions set mainly in Europe, but other studios also dabbled in horror and offered different approaches. The presence of Michael Curtiz’s horrors for Warner Brothers, Victor Halperin’s White Zombie (1932), Tod Browning’s Freaks (1932), and King Kong (1933) within the horror market testified to a generic variety that makes it hard to set definitive limits on that horror or to generalize about this period. Having noted this, the emphasis in many of these films was more on fantasy than it was on realism. Some horror historians have seen this as involving a disavowal of the social vicissitudes of the American Depression, although the Depression itself was rarely acknowledged explicitly in 1930s horror cinema. In any event, horror survived the Depression, albeit without some of its earlier inventiveness and energy. During the 1940s, Universal became increasingly dependent on horror sequels featuring not just Frankenstein and Dracula but revised versions of the Wolf Man and the mummy, while at RKO producer Val Lewton eschewed the monster-centered Universal approach and instead offered a more psychologically complex form of horror in films such as Cat People (1942), I Walked with a Zombie (1943), and The Seventh Victim (1943). Other films also contained horror-like material and imagery —including some of the Sherlock Holmes films that featured Basil\n\n6 •\n\nAMERICAN HORROR\n\nRathbone as the great detective, as well as psychological thrillers such as John Brahm’s The Lodger (1944) and Robert Siodmak’s The Spiral Staircase (1946). However, this wave of activity faded away from the mid-1940s onwards, with the horror parodies featuring comedians Bud Abbott and Lou Costello—most notably Abbott and Costello Meet Frankenstein (1948)—usually seen as marking the end of this phase in American horror history. There were some isolated horror projects during the first half of the 1950s—for example, The Black Castle (1952) or House of Wax (1953). But the monsters in this period were based elsewhere, in a series of science fiction films that often had horror-like qualities, among them The Thing From Another World (1951) and Jack Arnold’s Creature from the Black Lagoon (1954). It was not until the late 1950s that there was a revival in American horror’s fortunes, and this took place in a very different industrial context from that which had housed 1930s horror production. During the 1950s, the old-fashioned American studio system had been broken up by the U.S. government, and by the late 1950s the film market was more readily open to independent producers. At the same time, audiences were declining, and filmmakers were struggling to tempt people away from television and other domestic comforts through offering entertainments that were more spectacular— this was the age of Cinemascope and 3D—or more sensational or exploitative. The producer Herman Cohen’s low-budget horrors for the teenage market—Blood of Dracula (1957), I Was a Teenage Werewolf (1957), and I Was a Teenage Frankenstein (1957)—formed one early response to the new entertainment market. However, the international success of period horror films produced by the British company Hammer from 1957 onwards, along with a wave of late 1950s Italian horror, paved the way for the next major American horror cycle, which this time was not based on any particular monster but rather on a long-dead author. Producer-director Roger Corman’s period adaptations of Edgar Allan Poe stories, which began with House of Usher (1960) and Pit and the Pendulum (1961) and which were made for exploitation specialists American International Pictures, helped to establish Vincent Price as a horror star and also brought a level of ambition to the genre not seen since Lewton’s 1940s work. These films showed more interest than Hammer\n\nAMERICAN HORROR\n\n• 7\n\never did in exploring extreme psychological states, something that was also apparent in the otherwise very different Psycho (1960), Robert Aldrich’s grotesque What Ever Happened to Baby Jane? (1962), and a series of macabre thrillers from producer-director William Castle, among them The House on Haunted Hill (1959) and The Tingler (1959). Meanwhile, at the lower end of the industry, grindhouse specialist Herschell Gordon Lewis was pioneering the gore or splatter film with the much-censored Blood Feast (1963) and Two Thousand Maniacs (1964), while an unclassifiable oddity such as the dream-like Carnival of Souls (1962) was a reminder that generic variety was again the order of the day. The sense of an increasing ruthlessness in 1960s American horror was confirmed in 1968 with the release of the big-budget Roman Polanski Satanic thriller Rosemary’s Baby and George Romero’s low-budget zombie story Night of the Living Dead. Both were selfconsciously contemporary as well as relentlessly grim and paranoid, and both decisively rejected any prospect of the affirmation of goodness that had climaxed so many previous horror narratives. However, it was not until the astonishing commercial success experienced by The Exorcist (1973) that American filmmakers began seriously to engage with this new type of horror. Low-budget offerings such as Tobe Hooper’s The Texas Chainsaw Massacre (1974), Larry Cohen’s It’s Alive (1974), Brian De Palma’s Carrie (1976), and Wes Craven’s The Hills Have Eyes (1977), among many others, offered a view of American society, and especially the American family, that was both disturbing and, potentially at least, critical, while the bigger-budgeted apocalyptic horror The Omen (1976) equally managed to convey a sense that the world was doomed. As was the case with 1930s horror and the Depression, horror historians have related the anxiety and distrust of authority evident in 1970s horror to a troubled social context that involved not just the Vietnam war and its aftermath but also civil rights protests and an international oil crisis. Times changed, however, and the arrival of the slasher—starting with John Carpenter’s Halloween (1978) and Sean S. Cunningham’s Friday the 13th (1980)—signaled a re-engagement with the teenage audience, as teenage characters were picked off by judgmental serial killers in a series of low-budget horrors that ran into the early 1980s. At the time these films were criticized for their violence\n\n8 •\n\nAMERICAN HORROR\n\nagainst women, although more recently their introduction of the feisty female hero, or Final Girl, into American horror has been recognized by critics. The slasher also led to a greater reliance on sequels and cycles than had been apparent in the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s. Halloween and Friday the 13th generated numerous sequels but the major horror cycle—or franchise—of the 1980s was initiated by Wes Craven’s A Nightmare on Elm Street (1984). This supernatural reworking of the slasher format retained a focus on teenagers but added some striking surreal imagery. Just as sequelized 1940s American horror has been judged inferior to the 1930s version, so 1980s horror has sometimes been accused of “dumbing down” after the achievements of the 1970s. Such a perspective arguably overvalues the 1970s and underestimates the innovation and creativity apparent in the 1980s (although, as is the case with every era of horror production, formulaic films are easy to find). The 1990s saw a small resurgence in period horror—with Francis Ford Coppola’s Dracula (1992) and Neil Jordan’s Interview with the Vampire (1994)—but the emphasis remained on the contemporary with serial killer films such as The Silence of the Lambs (1991) and the revival of the slasher format with Craven’s Scream (1996), the success of which ushered in a new cycle of very self-conscious teenage horror. The international success experienced by Japanese horror from the late-1990s onwards also exerted an influence on American horror, with this evident not just in remakes of films such as Hideo Nakata’s Ringu (Ring) (1998) and Takashi Shimizu’s JuOn: The Grudge (2003) but also in other films that drew upon the slow-burn Japanese style. Associated both with this and the success of M. Night Shyamalan’s The Sixth Sense (1999), ghost stories became more of a presence than they had ever been before in American cinema. Meanwhile The Blair Witch Project (1999) discovered the marketing power of the internet in its playful engagement with American folklore. Horror filmmakers also raided the genre’s past, with nostalgic resurrections of classic monsters in Stephen Sommers’ The Mummy (1999) and Van Helsing (2004) and remakes of 1970s classics The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, The Hills Have Eyes, and Dawn of the Dead (1978), along with 1970s-style tough films like Wrong Turn (2003), Rob Zombie’s The Devil’s Rejects (2005), and Eli Roth’s Cabin Fever (2002) and Hostel (2005).\n\nAMERICAN INTERNATIONAL PICTURES\n\n• 9\n\nThe closer one gets to the present, the more obviously varied and fractured American horror production becomes. One can detect trends and mini-cycles but there is always something else going on elsewhere, whether this be an isolated but interesting project or some innovative work that will possibly lead to another mini-cycle of films. American horror has been like this since the 1930s, and any attempt to periodize or categorize it too neatly risks losing a sense of the variety that has made it such a distinctive and important sector of the genre. AMERICAN INTERNATIONAL PICTURES (AIP). The 1950s was one of the most important decades for American exploitation cinema, and, for a while at least, the independent production and distribution company American International Pictures led the field. Formed in 1954 by producers Samuel Z. Arkoff and James Nicholson as American Releasing Corporation and retitled American International Pictures (or AIP) in 1956, the company specialized in low-budget genre films with lurid titles that were designed primarily for teenage audiences. Representative AIP horrors from the 1950s were Bert I. Gordon’s The Amazing Colossal Man (1957) and The Spider (1958) and Herbert L. Strock’s I Was a Teenage Frankenstein (1957) and How to Make a Monster (1958) but the company’s main director was the prolific Roger Corman, who worked in a variety of genres, both for AIP and other companies, throughout the 1950s. His AIP horrors It Conquered the World (1956) and The Undead (1957) were a cut above the average for this type of production. It was Corman’s ambition that ultimately led, after some resistance from Arkoff and Nicholson, to AIP embarking on a series of Corman-directed Edgar Allan Poe adaptations, which had higher production values than usual and which featured intelligent scripts from the likes of Richard Matheson and Charles Beaumont and witty performances from Vincent Price. The Poe cycle—which included House of Usher (1960), Pit and the Pendulum (1961), and The Masque of the Red Death (1964)—capitalized on the success of the British company Hammer in popularizing period horror but maintained its own distinctive style and character. During the 1960s and into the 1970s, AIP continued to churn out low-budget teenage fare—including a series of Beach Party\n\n10 •\n\nAMICUS\n\nmovies—but it retained its interest in horror. Corman directed X: The Man with X Ray Eyes (1963), while Francis Ford Coppola made his feature directorial debut with AIP’s psychological thriller Dementia 13 (The Haunted and the Hunted) (1963). There was also involvement in British productions, among these the camp horrors The Abominable Dr. Phibes (1971) and its sequel Dr. Phibes Rises Again (1972) and the witchcraft drama Cry of the Banshee (1970), as well as collaborations with Amicus on Scream and Scream Again (1969) and The Oblong Box (1968) and with Hammer on the lesbian vampire story The Vampire Lovers (1970). AIP also made some interesting contributions to 1970s American horror, with its productions including the impressive H. P. Lovecraft adaptation The Dunwich Horror (1970), the revenge of nature horror Frogs (1972), the blaxploitation classic Blacula (1972), a version of The Island of Dr. Moreau (1977), and the haunted house drama The Amityville Horror (1979), one of the company’s most commercially successful titles. As the 1970s progressed, themes and material associated with the exploitation sector entered the mainstream and AIP itself became a less distinctive production setup. The company was taken over by Filmways in 1980 but by then its place in horror history was secure. AMICUS. Amicus is usually seen as British horror’s second company, after Hammer. It did not seek to emulate the commercially dominant Hammer product but instead, from the mid-1960s onwards, developed its own distinctive brand of horror. Set up by American producers Max J. Rosenberg and Milton Subotsky, Amicus’s first films were the pop musicals It’s Trad Dad (1962) and Just for Fun (1963). It switched to horror in 1964 with Dr. Terror’s House of Horrors, which was directed by frequent Amicus collaborator Freddie Francis and written by Subotsky himself. This was a horror anthology that brought together stories about werewolves, vampires, killer plants and voodoo. Hammer never used the anthology format but it became an Amicus speciality. Dr. Terror also established the company’s preference for contemporary settings. Amicus would only make two period horror films—I, Monster (1970) and And Now the Screaming Starts (1973)—and these would not come until near the end of the company’s existence.\n\nAMICUS\n\n• 11\n\nMore anthologies followed—Francis’s Torture Garden (1967), Peter Duffell’s The House that Dripped Blood (1970), Roy Ward Baker’s Asylum (1972), Francis’s Tales from the Crypt (1972), Baker’s Vault of Horror (1973), and Kevin Connor’s From Beyond the Grave (1973). Many of these drew upon American sources—with Torture Garden and The House that Dripped Blood adapted by American writer Robert Bloch from his own stories, and Tales from the Crypt adapted from E. C. horror comics, and they all exhibited an urbane and often cynical sense of humor, something that again rendered them quite distinct from the Hammer product. The twist endings which became an essential feature of the Amicus anthology quickly became predictable—usually the characters narrating the stories within the film were revealed as already dead or as doomed to die— but the quality of some of the individual stories was remarkable. Amicus was less successful with its single-narrative features. Francis’s The Skull (1965) and The Psychopath (1965) both contained some impressively stylish sequences but lacked overall cohesion. Another Francis film, The Deadly Bees (1966) lacked even the stylish sequences, while Stephen Weeks’ I, Monster was a dramatically inert rendition of the Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde story. Bill Bain’s What Became of Jack And Jill? (1971) was an uninspired psychological thriller, Jim Clark’s Madhouse (1974) a laboured attempt at self -reflexive horror and Paul Annett’s The Beast Must Die (1974) an odd, blaxploitation-influenced werewolf film that was marketed in the United States as Black Werewolf and which featured a gimmicky “werewolf break” in which the audience was given the opportunity to guess which character was the werewolf. Amicus also produced some science fiction/horror hybrids. Montgomery Tully’s The Terrornauts (1967) and Francis’s They Came from Beyond Space (1967) were both conventional alien invasion fantasies. By contrast, Gordon Hessler’s Scream and Scream Again (1969)—a co-production with American International Pictures— was a fascinating, if idiosyncratic and sometimes obscure, tale of super-strong androids. Considerably gentler was Alan Cooke’s The Mind of Mr. Soames (1969), in which Terence Stamp played a man with the mind of a child, as indeed was Warris Hussein’s A Touch of Love (1969), an adaptation of Margaret Drabble’s novel The Millstone that was Amicus’s only non-genre project. As the market for\n\n12 •\n\nTHE AMITYVILLE HORROR\n\nBritish horror faded away in the mid-1970s, Amicus—in what turned out to be a final burst of activity—also produced a series of Edgar Rice Burroughs’ adaptations, The Land that Time Forgot (1974), At the Earth’s Core (1976), and The People that Time Forgot (1977), all of which were directed by Kevin Connor. THE AMITYVILLE HORROR (1979). In 1975, George and Kathy Lutz moved into a house on Long Island, New York, a house in which a man had previously murdered six members of his own family. Twenty-eight days after their arrival, the Lutz family left, claiming that the house was haunted. The Amityville Horror, a book detailing their experiences, became an international bestseller, and it was adapted into a successful film by director Stuart Rosenberg in 1979. The veracity of the Amityville story has been much debated, but the film version was a straightforward haunted house story slightly hampered by an anticlimactic narrative in which eventually the protagonists just leave the site of danger. The sequels that followed compensated for this by abandoning whatever factual basis there had been in the original and replacing it with some standard ghost story conventions. Amityville II: The Possession (1982), directed by Damiano Damiani, was a stylish prequel that gave some of the house’s back story. Amityville 3-D (1983), despite being directed by veteran Richard Fleischer, was silly and tiresome. Not all the low budget follow-ups were official sequels but in any event none of them added much of interest to the Amityville cycle; they included Amityville: The Evil Escapes (1989), The Amityville Curse (1990), Amityville 1992: It’s About Time (1992), Amityville: A New Generation (1993), and Amityville: Dollhouse (1996). The Amityville Horror (2005), directed by Andrew Douglas, was a remake of the 1979 original that added new material about the source of the haunting in order to provide a more dramatic story arc. See also AMERICAN HORROR. ANDERSON, PAUL W. S. (1965– ). Paul Anderson is a British-born writer-director based mainly in the United States who has specialized in horror/science fiction hybrids. His first major success was Mortal Kombat (1995), an adaptation of a popular martial arts computer game that contained some horror imagery. Event Horizon (1997) was a stylish ghost story set on board a spaceship, while Resident Evil\n\nANIMATION\n\n• 13\n\n(2002), based on another computer game, was a horror-action thriller featuring zombies. Anderson’s films tend to be slick and fast-paced, with the visuals underpinned by pounding rock music. He also directed the SF/western hybrid Soldier (1998), the supernatural television movie The Sight (2000), and the ultra-high concept AVP: Alien versus Predator (2004), as well as scripting and co-producing Resident Evil: Apocalypse (2004) and co-producing The Dark (2005). ANIMATION. Animation within the American commercial mainstream has tended to be directed at children and family audiences. Consequently, what horror-like imagery it has contained—and there has been such imagery—has usually been presented in an attenuated form or within an unthreatening context. For example, the witch in Walt Disney’s version of Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937) might have scared generations of children and possesses some of the qualities of the horror monster but essentially she is a figure from the more positive world of fairy tales. By comparison, Japanese animation, which is often directed at adult audiences, has been more willing to engage in an explicit way with horror material, as is evident in animated vampire stories such as Vampaia hantâ D (Vampire Hunter D) (1985) and Blood—The Last Vampire (2000), gruesome monster films such as Chôjin densetsu Urotsukidôji (Legend of the Overfiend) (1989), and action/horror hybrids like Yôjû toshi (Wicked City) (1987). From the early 1990s onwards, both American and British animation has also offered a few feature films that have located themselves more confidently in relation to the horror genre, possibly reflecting the growing popularity of horror fiction with younger audiences. Tim Burton’s The Nightmare Before Christmas (1993) and Corpse Bride (2005) both contained some surprisingly unnerving moments, while Nick Park’s The Curse of the Were-Rabbit (2005) and Robert Zemeckis’s production of Monster House (2006) managed a more consistently comic treatment of horror themes. Outside of the commercial mainstream, it is easier to find disturbing and horrifying film animation; one only has to look at the work of the Czech animator Jan Svankmajer or of the American-born, European-based Quay Brothers. However, experimental or avant-garde films of this kind owe as much to surrealism as they do to cinematic horror and arguably they do not function in any significant way as\n\n14 •\n\nANKERS, EVELYN\n\npart of a horror genre that is overwhelmingly defined by its commercial imperatives. ANKERS, EVELYN (1918–1985). Evelyn Ankers was the leading lady in numerous 1940s American horror films. More graceful and poised than some of the more melodrama-prone “scream queens” of the 1930s such as Fay Wray, Ankers was well-suited to the solid and workmanlike B-movie projects that defined much horror production during the following decade. Born in Chile to English parents, she moved to the United States in the early 1940s. An early genre credit was the Bud Abbott and Lou Costello comedy-horror Hold That Ghost (1941). More substantial roles followed alongside Lon Chaney Jr. in Universal’s The Wolf Man (1941), The Ghost of Frankenstein (1942), and Son of Dracula (1943), as well as an uncharacteristically sultry turn in the noir-like Sherlock Holmes and the Voice of Terror (1942). Somehow she managed to retain her dignity in Captive Wild Woman (1943), in which mad scientist John Carradine transformed an ape into a woman (with Ankers playing the romantic female lead, not the ape woman), and its equally silly sequel Jungle Woman (1944). She was reunited with Chaney Jr. in Weird Woman (1944) and The Frozen Ghost (1945) and also starred in the minor The Mad Ghoul (1943) and The Invisible Man’s Revenge (1944), as well as returning to the Sherlock Holmes series with The Pearl of Death (1944). The end of the 1940s low-budget horror boom was also in effect the end of Ankers’ cinematic career. She worked mainly on television during the 1950s and retired from acting in 1960. She was married to the Hollywood actor Richard Denning. ANTHOLOGIES. The anthology or portmanteau format—in which a number of shorter films are linked together—has proved sporadically popular in mainstream cinema. For horror filmmakers, it has facilitated the adaptation of gothic short stories that would not otherwise lend themselves easily to translation into the feature format. For example, a series of Edgar Allan Poe-based anthologies—among them Unheimliche Geschichten (Tales of the Uncanny) (1932), Tales of Terror (1962), and Histoires extraordinaires (Tales of Mystery and Imagination, Spirits of the Dead) (1968)—proved more faithful (although only slightly in some cases) to the brief literary originals than\n\nTHE ANTICHRIST\n\n• 15\n\nsome feature-length adaptations of Poe’s work, while Twice Told Tales (1963) tried to do something similar with the writings of Nathaniel Hawthorne. The supernatural drama Dead of Night (1945) and Mario Bava’s I tre volti della paura (Black Sabbath) (1963) also took advantage of the anthology format to offer a mixture of different types of story, ranging from the serious to the comic and from period to contemporary, while the more upmarket production Kaidan (Kwaidan) (1964) showcased the Japanese ghost story tradition. The British company Amicus produced a series of horror anthologies during the 1960s and 1970s, beginning with Dr. Terror’s House of Horrors (1964) and including Torture Garden (1967) and Tales from the Crypt (1972). These displayed both the strengths of the anthology format—an ability to draw upon non-novel length sources, including the short stories of Robert Bloch and E.C. horror comics—and its weaknesses—notably an unevenness of quality from one segment to another and often feeble linking narratives. Other anthology horrors sharing both these virtues and faults include The Uncanny (1977), Creepshow (1982), Twilight Zone: the Movie (1983), Cat’s Eye (1985), After Midnight (1989), Due occhi diabolici (Two Evil Eyes) (1990), Tales from the Darkside: the Movie (1990), Necronomicon (1994), Quicksilver Highway (1997), Bangkok Haunted (2001), Cradle of Fear (2001), and Saam gaang yi (Three . . . Extremes) (2004). THE ANTICHRIST. The American horror film The Omen (1976), and its sequels, popularized the idea of the Antichrist, the son of the Devil, and in so doing also drew upon apocalyptic prophecies lifted from the Book of Revelations (although the word antichrist never actually appears in Revelations). The blasphemous inversion of the story of Jesus Christ, with the “word” of the Devil made flesh on Earth, had first been introduced into horror cinema with Roman Polanski’s Rosemary’s Baby (1968), in which Rosemary (played by Mia Farrow) was apparently raped by the Devil and gave birth to his son. While Polanski offered a darkly comic treatment, The Omen was both more ponderous and more doom-laden. Its vision of a world in which the rise of the Antichrist is preordained chimed with the cynical mood of the 1970s, and the film was a huge commercial success. The Antichrist returned in Damien—Omen II (1978) and The Final Conflict (1981) and also featured in Omen-clone Holocaust 2000\n\n16 •\n\nAPES\n\n(1977). More recently, the evil one—in the form of Michael York, this time—has sought to bring about the world’s destruction in The Omega Code (1999) and Meggido: Omega Code 2 (2001), Ben Chaplin played a potential Antichrist in waiting in Lost Souls (2000), and The Omen was remade in 2006. An early comic version of the Antichrist can be found in the Vincente Minnelli-directed musical Cabin in the Sky (1943), where he goes under the name of Lucifer Jr. APES. Apes were stock figures in American horror films from the 1920s through to the 1950s. The giant ape in King Kong (1933, remade in 1976 and 2005) is the most remembered, but the more typical horror ape usually came in the considerably less impressive form of a man wearing a gorilla suit. The Edgar Allan Poe adaptation Murders in the Rue Morgue (1932) contained a murderous ape, and the popular murder mystery play The Gorilla was filmed three times, in 1927, 1930 and 1939. A fascination with evolutionary progression and regression was evident in Captive Wild Woman (1943), in which an ape was transformed into a beautiful woman by a mad scientist. Savage gorillas featured in The Monster and the Girl (1941) and Bride of the Gorilla (1951); Bela Lugosi Meets a Brooklyn Gorilla (1952) offered a comic treatment of the theme. In 1961, British horror cinema came up with a belated addition to"
