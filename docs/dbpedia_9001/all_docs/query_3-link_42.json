        "text": "My first experiences with scary movies were with 80s horror movies.\n\nGrowing up in the 80s, I was too young to see most of them in theatre, but I can remember seeing trailers for them. The trailers peaked my curiosity and the horror genre seemed like it would be exciting as well as scary,\n\nBecause 80s horror movies were forbidden for people my age, that made them all the more intriguing. Most were rated AA (Adult Accompaniment), or R (Restricted). I was born in 1980, so much to young, even by 1989 to gain entry to a horror movie showing at our local cinema.\n\nTowards the end of the 80s and into the early 90s, I started spending a lot (like a lot, a lot) of time at the video rental store. I grew up loving movies, and spent a good chunk of my free time renting and watching movies with friends and family.\n\nThe Forbidden Horror Section of the Video Store\n\nDo you remember the “horror” section of your local video rental store? I sure do.\n\nIt was a creepy collection of dark, twisted tales contained on the VHS tapes that lined the shelves. The images contained on the glossy VHS covers teased the gruesome, gory, and terrifying elements of each film.\n\nSome depicted maniacal characters veiled in shadows, carrying implements of torture or dismemberment. Others showed ghosts, demons, vampires, and all kinds of demented monsters stalking or attacking their victims.\n\nAs a kid, I remember being drawn to these covers. My parents would normally shoo me away from lingering near the horror section, telling me that I was too young or those movies.\n\nI can still remember the nervous feeling that I experienced as a kid in the movie store, trying not to look at them because they were off limits. But feeling enticed to want to check them out.\n\nIt’s kind of little kid logic 101: that telling a kid not to do something, is guaranteed to make a kid want to do that something even more. But it wasn’t just the desire to push the limits with my parents that made me want to see the horror movies, there was something else at play.\n\nLooking Back at Why We’re Drawn to Horror\n\nAs an adult, the topic of why some people are drawn to horror movies has been something that I’ve been curious about for quite some time. My understanding is that there are different reasons for each person’s unique experiences with the genre.\n\nSome people enjoy the “adrenaline rush” aspect of horror movies. While others enjoy being able to confront scary things, while in a safe environment; where they have control.\n\nSome people like to explore things that they would never encounter in real life, as a way to engage their imagination. While others enjoy seeing that even the most unspeakable evils can be overcome.\n\nWe’ll explore these reasons a bit more later on.\n\nRegardless, there was a desire in me to see the 80s horror movies that I would brush up against from time to time.\n\nAnd like many of you, I did see some of them. Actually, a lot of them.\n\nMy experience with 80s horror movies came exclusively by watching them on VHS (or later DVDs) in the 90s.\n\nFor me, these movies were definitely worth the wait!\n\nThe Rise of Horror in the 80s\n\nThe 1980s witnessed an unparalleled surge in horror movie production. With filmmakers pushing boundaries to explore new realms of terror.\n\n80s Slasher Films\n\nThis decade saw the rise of iconic slasher films. Popularized by series like “Friday the 13th,” and “A Nightmare on Elm Street.”\n\nIn 1980, the first “Friday the 13th” movie hit the big screen. In the film Jason Voorhees stalks and preys upon scores of campers and camp counsellors at the infamous Camp Crystal Lake.\n\nFour years later the “A Nightmare on Elm Street” introduced us to Freddy Krueger. As the evil spirit of a serial killer, Freddy lurked in the dream world, ready to pierce his victims with his razor sharp metal claws.\n\nAlthough the relentless brutality of Jason and the menacing gorefest that Freddy inflicted weren’t really for me, it was impossible to ignore the impact these films had on the horror genre.\n\nThe Sci-Fi / Horror Films of the 80s\n\nSimultaneously, the decade was marked by an infusion of science fiction into horror. With movies like “The Thing” (1982) and “Aliens” (1986) offering a chilling blend of extraterrestrial terror and suspense.\n\nThese films resonated more with me. Striking the perfect balance between the unknown of outer space and the primal fear of being hunted.\n\n“Aliens,” in particular, with its blend of action, horror, and sci-fi, became a personal favourite. Showcasing how horror could transcend its traditional boundaries.\n\nThe fear of being pursued by something both intelligent and utterly inhuman struck a chord with me. It was different from the random violence of slasher films and the stakes seemed much higher. It sparked my imagination, and I enjoyed thinking about the universe and wondering what might lie beyond the stars.\n\nThe era’s technological advancements, particularly in special effects, contributed to the genre’s popularity.\n\nFilms like The “Thing ” showcased effects that far surpassed anything previously seen, adding to the genre’s appeal and success.\n\nNo more tomato juice as the quest for the most realistic and disgusting looking effects and props was dialled up in the 80s horror scene.\n\nA Journey into the World of 80s Horror Movies\n\nThe early 90s, for me, were a time of exploring the horror genre. Particularly the 80s horror movies that lived in that once forbidden corner of the video store.\n\nLike many 80s and 90s kids, my true initiation into the realm of horror came not in a theatre, but in those cozy, yet eerie living rooms and basements of friends’ houses.\n\nAs the sun set, the lights would be turned off, and we’d psyche ourselves up to push play on the VCR, as we settled into a game of: try not to be the first to flinch.\n\nThe First Time Watching a Horror Movie\n\nMy earliest memory of this was being at my best friends’ Shane and Garit’s house. That night, we had to share the TV and VCR with their older brother and his friends.\n\nWe watched our movie pick first: “Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan.” While not a horror movie, it was scary enough in its own right, for our pre-teen eyes.\n\nThen Troy and his friends popped in: “A Nightmare on Elm Street 3: Dream Warriors.”\n\nThe next hour and a half was spent making excuses to go to the bathroom, or to the kitchen for a snack to seek respite from the terror on the TV screen.\n\nI was probably 9 or 10 and I was definitely not ready for that type of violence. Or the concept that you could be killed in your sleep and consequently die in real life; WTH!\n\nTo say I was terrified would be an understatement.\n\nScary, Yet Addictive\n\nBut as mentioned earlier, eventually my curiosity (perhaps fuelled by wanting to overcome my fear of Freddy), drew me back to the horror movie section of the video store.\n\nI remember many nights spent at sleepovers, where watching horror movies was as much a part of the ritual, as the snacks and Super Nintendo gaming.\n\nIn the early days of wading into the depths of horror, films like “Beetlejuice” (1988) and “Gremlins” (1984) offered a lighter take on the genre. Which helped ease us into the scarier stuff.\n\n“Children of the Corn” (1984) sticks out in my memory as a more traditional early 80s horror movie that I watched and enjoyed.\n\nSome of my friends liked the Child’s Play movies. But I couldn’t get into the possessed doll niche. Something about the Chucky movies still makes me grit my teeth when I see ads for movies like Annabelle. Some people love these films though.\n\nIt’s interesting what horror fans gravitate towards and what they don’t like about some films in the genre.\n\n“Evil Dead” (1981) is one of the more iconic cult classic 80s horror movies that stood for me. It stood out with its unique blend of horror and unintended comedy. I loved this one (and most of its sequels).\n\nI thought it was a uniquely fun and equally gross movie. It’s a weird sensation to go from squirming from the gore on screen to laughing at the ridiculous splatters and one liners, all while still being somewhat scared.\n\nOvercoming Fear: A Rite of Passage\n\nAs mentioned earlier, as much as horror movies initially terrified me, they also held an irresistible allure.\n\nIt was almost a rite of passage to be able to brave horror movies. Feeling fear, but conquering it by the time the credits rolled, and you could finally breathe normally again.\n\nIt was a challenge, a silent acknowledgment that enduring the terror was a step towards bravery.\n\nAnd once you were hooked on horror, you wanted to experience that thrill, and sense of accomplishment more and more frequently.\n\nIf this was the case for you too, you’ll remember that there were numerous 80s horror movie franchises, series, iconic directors and sub-genres that provided endless hours of frightful fun.\n\nThe Mandatory Stephen King Phase of Horror Indoctrination\n\nOne 80s-themed horror phase we enjoyed, was our Stephen King phase (which was mandatory for any horror fan back in the day).\n\nI think we started with “Creep Show,” an anthology directed by George A Romero. One story even featured the guy from the iconic comedy “Naked Gun” (Leslie Nielsen).\n\nFrom there we worked our way up to (or back to?) “The Shining” (1980), which was next level disturbing, suspenseul, and utterly terrifying.\n\nSomething about the psychological terror aspects of the film and witnessing the Jack Torrance as he slowly loses his mind is intriguing.\n\nI think it’s the same kind of thing that appeals to fans of true crime. A curiosity about why people do bad things. It’s hard not to want to see if Jack can ever overcome his inner demons, or whether he is/has become evil personified.\n\nThe Communal Aspect of Horror Movie Enjoyment\n\nThere was something fundamentally communal about horror movie experiences.\n\n80s horror movies weren’t just films; they were shared adventures. Each scare, each jump, and each nervous laugh created bonds.\n\nWe shared the tension, the release of laughter after a particularly intense scene, and the mutual sighs of relief when the credits rolled and the lights came back on.\n\nThese moments became cherished memories and shared milestones in our journey through adolescence.\n\nI wish we could’ve seen some of these classic 80s horror movies in the theatre. My friends and I had wait until the mid 90s to be old enough to see horror on the big screen.\n\nEnduring horror scarefests in theatre is a great way to participate in the communal aspects of the genre. I bet some of you can remember sharing the fear, anxiety and satisfaction of overcoming it, with a group of strangers at your local cinema.\n\nIn a small way, watching a horror movie in a theatre full of people who all jump at the same time, laugh together, and ultimately survive the tension and suspense of a good flick, makes you feel connected to each other.\n\nWatching horror movies is for sure ,best enjoyed as a shared experience that transcends individual viewing.\n\nWhether it was with friends at a sleepover, with my brother, or later in life my partner, and now with my daughter, there’s always a sense of camaraderie in facing our fears together.\n\nIt creates a space where we could confront the unthinkable, secure in the knowledge that we were all in it together. And a common understanding that what we were scared of on screen, was only a movie and wasn’t real.\n\nPsychological Perspectives on Horror Enjoyment\n\nThe fascination with horror movies isn’t just a matter of personal preference; it’s apparently deeply rooted in psychology.\n\nResearch from the 1980s started shedding light on this. Revealing that a love for horror wasn’t tied to psychopathology, but rather to specific personality traits like low neuroticism and high sensation seeking.\n\nThis early research suggested that the thrill and intensity of horror appealed to certain personality types more than others.\n\nIt’s not just about seeking thrills; it’s also about how we process empathy and fear.\n\nIn more recent times, the psychological understanding of horror movie enjoyment has deepened. Contemporary research indicates that some people who experience anxiety and/or fearfulness may have a greater desire to watch horror films.\n\nMyth-busting the stereotype that Horror Fans Lack Empathy\n\nNewer research also seems to debunk the stereotype that people who like horror movies have low empathy towards others. It now appears that it might be the opposite.\n\nPeople who are empathic, connect with with the characters in horror movies. This means the scary experiences are more impactful.\n\nIt also means the viewer gets enjoyment seeing characters succeed and overcome whatever threats they face on screen.\n\nHorror and Resiliency\n\nNewer studies have proposed that horror fans might be more psychologically resilient. Watching horror movies can be a form of emotional regulation training. Allowing viewers to manage fear and anxiety in a controlled environment.\n\nThis idea aligns with the concept of catharsis, where experiencing intense emotions in a safe setting can be therapeutic. It suggests that horror movies do more than entertain; they provide a space to practice and understand our responses to fear and danger.\n\nWhen taken into context, this could explain why we are first drawn to the genre in our teenage years into early adulthood. Typically that’s when we become more and more aware of the dangers of the real world. We also realize that sometimes things in real life are really scary.\n\nPerhaps because of this, we appreciate being able to have a venue where we can feel some control over the scary bits and take comfort in knowing that they are only temporary and that they will come to an end.\n\nI find all of this fascinating. Apologies though if I’ve strayed us too far off course. Let’s get back to the business of discussing 80s horror movies.\n\nThe Cultural and Controversial Impact of 80s Horror\n\nThe 80s were a period of significant cultural and societal reactions to this genre.\n\nMovies like “A Nightmare on Elm Street” and “Friday the 13th” sparked debates about the effects of on-screen violence.\n\nSome films were criticized for excessive violence and gore, pushing the boundaries of what was acceptable in mainstream cinema. Leading to controversies and, in some cases, calls for censorship.\n\nAs horror movies constantly pushed the envelope for what is acceptable in terms of the gore and depravity depicted on screen, some parents, faith-based community groups, and victim’s advocates pushed back. Trying to hold the line to protect society from being exposed to the grotesque and the sensational aspects of horror movies in the 80s.\n\nThe onscreen violence and gore wasn’t the only cause for criticism and controversy though.\n\nNegative Aspects Associated with Some Aspects of 80s Horror Movies\n\nDuring the 80s, “Elvira’s Movie Macabre” showcased B-rated horror films from the 70s with evident exploitation issues.\n\nAs horror gained mainstream popularity in the 80s, the lack of diversity and broad appeal became more apparent as well.\n\nControversies arose over the exploitative depictions of women and minorities, reflecting societal tensions of the day.\n\nWomen were often portrayed as mere objects, perpetuating harmful stereotypes and impeding progress in the fight for gender equality.\n\nSimilarly, non-white characters were relegated to negative stereotypes, seldom given meaningful roles or backstories, contributing to racial biases.\n\nThese issues weren’t unique to 80s horror movies. It was a more systemic entertainment industry issue. One that many would argue still persists today.\n\nNot All Horror Movies Can Be Painted with the Same Brush\n\nTo its credit, some films marked a turning point in the portrayal of women in horror. Moving away from stereotypes to feature more strong female characters following the success of “Halloween” in 1978.\n\n“Halloween” featured a young Jamie-Lee Curtis as Laurie who overcomes her fear and fights back to successfully overcome the relentless pursuit of Michael Myers.\n\nIn the 80s, we saw Laurie again in “Halloween II” but we also saw characters like the super tough space Captain Ripley fight off the alien horde on multiple occasions.\n\nAs well as the bad @$$ Sarah Connor, who becomes tough as nails in “The Terminator” (1984).\n\nThese protagonists influenced subsequent horror movies, setting new standards in horror filmmaking and audience expectations.\n\nSadly, it would take longer for non-white characters to take centre-stage as strong main characters/protagonists in horror films. And the there’s still work to be done.\n\nA Few More Examples of Times When 80s Horror Movies Met Resistance\n\nAs mentioned, several horror movies from the 1980s garnered significant negative press and criticisms. Leading to controversies, calls for bans, and even campaigns for censorship. Here are some other notable examples:\n\n“Possession” (1981): This film’s erratic narrative and emotionally exhausting rawness led to considerable controversy among audiences and critics .\n\n“The Evil Dead” (1981): Sam Raimi’s film was widely banned and criticized in several countries due to the brutality of its graphic sequences, including a notorious tree rape scene .\n\n“Henry: Portrait of a Serial Killer” (1986): This film, a fictionalized portrait of serial killer Henry Lee Lucas, was X-rated and faced very limited distribution due to its abundant brutality and amorality .\n\n“White Dog” (1982): The film, about a dog trained to attack people of colour, faced controversy over its approach to racism. It received a very limited release due to concerns from the NAACP.\n\nDespite the controversies, 80s horror cinema left a lasting imprint on the genre. Influencing future filmmakers and shaping the tastes of audiences for decades to come.\n\nThe era’s films were often a mix of camp, gore, and psychological terror, reflecting the diverse anxieties and cultural dynamics of the time.\n\nReconnecting with Horror\n\nAs time progressed, my relationship with horror movies evolved, especially now through shared viewings with my daughter.\n\nHer interest in horror, which blossomed around the age of 12-13, towards the end of the COVID-19 pandemic, reignited my own passion for the genre.\n\nIt’s been interesting, to rewatch some of the movies that I deemed retro classics, with her. Some held up and some, unfortunately haven’t aged well.\n\nHowever, it has been a blast reliving some of the frights from my teenage years. While appreciating what modern horror has to offer and how far the genre has grown since the 80s horror boom.\n\nThis shared experience with my daughter has been particularly enlightening.\n\nIt’s fascinating to see her reactions to the same films that once scared me and to discuss them from our individual perspectives.\n\nWe’ve found that watching horror movies offers a sense of satisfaction in overcoming fears.\n\nDespite the terror they instil, these movies are a reminder that our real lives are, in comparison, safe and mundane. This realization, shared between us, adds a layer of bonding and mutual understanding.\n\nThrough these shared experiences, I’ve come to appreciate the communal aspect of horror movies even more.\n\nThey are not just individual tales of terror but shared narratives that bring people together. Allowing them to explore their fears in a safe and controlled environment.\n\nIt’s a tradition that has been passed down, from my early days of watching horror movies with friends, to now sharing them with my daughter.\n\nHorror Movies and Their Lasting Appeal\n\n80s Horror Movies were often not considered to be on par with other genres, in terms of consideration for major awards like the Oscars.\n\nThey were frequently marginalized in the critical sphere. Although some did receive critical acclaim for their innovation and impact.\n\nMovie critics’ reviews of horror movies in the 1980s varied. Some appreciated the genre’s creativity and others dismissed it as lowbrow, or excessively violent.\n\nFor me, and some other fans, this often positioned horror movies as “underdogs” and helped to endear the genre to fans who rooted for it to succeed. Who doesn’t love a good underdog story? I say we name this underdog: “Cujo.”\n\nThe timeless allure of 80s horror movies lies in their adept exploration of our deepest fears and anxieties. Providing a shared experience and cathartic release.\n\nWhether it’s the ominous atmosphere of “The Lost Boys” or the supernatural suspense of “The Fog,” these films have made an enduring impact on our collective psyche.\n\nLet’s Talk about 80s Horror Movies and Their Legacy\n\nIn writing this article, I found it interesting that a lot of (like a lot, a lot of) 80s horror movies have been remade, reimagined, or spun into sequels and prequels.\n\nI think this speaks to how important the sometimes dismissed genre is. And to how many moviemakers grew up with an affinity for 80s horror movies and want to try to recapture some of that magic.\n\nI invite you to share your memories and experiences with 80s horror movies.\n\nWhat was your favourite horror movie from this era, and why did it captivate you?\n\nOr, if you weren’t a fan, what aspects of the genre didn’t appeal to you?\n\nLet’s reminisce about the frights and thrills that these movies brought us, and explore what made them such a significant part of our history.\n\nThanks for stopping by.\n\nHave a rad rest of your day!"
