        "text": "NEW YORK (WFAN/AP) - Raymond Felton is returning to New York, calling into question whether the Knicks plan to re-sign fellow point guard Jeremy Lin.\n\nFelton's agent confirmed a Yahoo Sports report on Saturday that Felton would be signed and traded by Portland to New York.\n\nLin has signed an offer sheet with the Houston Rockets, and the Knicks have repeatedly said that they would match any offer for their breakout star. But with the third year of the contract worth about $15 million, they can certainly pass now after signing Jason Kidd and getting Felton back.\n\nFelton played well in half a season in New York, averaging 17.1 points before the Knicks sent him to Denver as part of the package for Carmelo Anthony in February of 2011. He struggled this season with the Trail Blazers, scoring 11.4 points per game on 40.7 percent shooting and briefly losing his starting job.\n\nStill, he was considered an option as a veteran backup to Lin if the Knicks didn't get Steve Nash or Kidd. They signed Kidd and still pursued Felton.\n\nNow the question is where will Lin play next season.\n\nCoach Mike Woodson said on Wednesday that Lin would not only be back, but would enter next season as the Knicks' starting point guard. He then signed his offer sheet worth about $25 million for three years on Friday, and the Knicks have until 11:59 p.m. EDT on Tuesday to match the offer, according to a person with knowledge of the process. The person spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity because the contract had not been announced.\n\nThe Knicks already lost one guard on Saturday when they elected not to match the offer that Landry Fields signed with Toronto, worth around $20 million over three years. The second-round pick from Stanford had been a starter during his two seasons with New York.\n\n\"I want to thank ALL the Knick fans out there for their support over the past two years!\" he wrote on Twitter. \"Much love and respect, you will be missed.\"\n\nIt would be more surprising if the Knicks passed on matching Lin's offer. The undrafted guard from Harvard emerged as the starter in February and averaged 17.9 points in 27 games before needing surgery to repair torn knee cartilage. The league's first American-born player of Chinese or Taiwanese descent became one of the team's most popular players and helped the Knicks draw huge TV ratings locally and in Asia. His merchandise sold heavily, making it unlikely that the Knicks would want him to leave.\n\nBut with Kidd and Felton, they have two veterans who would be respected by the Knicks' frontcourt trio of Anthony, Tyson Chandler and Amar'e Stoudemire. Stoudemire and Felton had good chemistry in the pick-and-roll offense, and neither has been as good since the two were separated.\n\nKnicks fans, how do you feel about the Felton acquisition? And will the Knicks be making a huge mistake if they let Lin go? Sound off with your thoughts and comments below...\n\n(TM and Copyright 2012 CBS Radio Inc. and its relevant subsidiaries.
