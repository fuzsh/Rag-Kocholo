        "text": "INDIANAPOLIS — Raymond Felton tied a career high with 31 points and the Charlotte Bobcats beat the Indiana Pacers 115-108 in overtime on Friday night.\n\nJason Richardson finished with 21 points, D.J. Augustin scored 17 and Gerald Wallace added 16 points and 11 rebounds for the Bobcats (5-10), who won for just the second time in their past seven games.\n\nCharlotte’s Emeka Okafor had 14 points and 20 rebounds.\n\nDanny Granger scored a season-high 35 points, and Marquis Daniels and T.J. Ford each had 20 for the Pacers (6-9).\n\nAfter trailing by as many as 14 points in the first half and 93-90 with 5 minutes left in the fourth quarter, the Pacers took a 97-95 lead on Troy Murphy’s 3-pointer with 39 seconds remaining in regulation.\n\nCharlotte tied it at 97 on Okafor’s layup, and following baskets by both teams, the Pacers had a chance to win in the closing seconds, but Granger’s jumper over a leaping Okafor was no good.\n\nThe Bobcats scored the first seven points of overtime, including consecutive 3-pointers by Felton and Augustin. Indiana cut the deficit to 108-105 on Ford’s two free throws with 47 seconds left, but Felton’s jumper pushed the lead back to five.\n\nThe Bobcats took their biggest lead, 37-23, on Nazr Mohammed’s layup with 8:42 left in the second quarter. Indiana answered with a 17-6 run, capped by Daniels’ driving layup, to make it 43-40. The Pacers trailed 53-48 at the half.\n\nIndiana tied it three times in the third quarter before taking a 71-70 lead on Brandon Rush’s 3-pointer with 3 minutes left. Murphy’s layup gave the Pacers an 81-75 advantage later in the period.\n\nNotes:@ Richardson started after missing the past seven games. He underwent an exploratory arthroscopic procedure Nov. 12 after suffering from right knee inflammation. … Pacers G Mike Dunleavy (right knee) missed the game and has yet to play this season. … Charlotte coach Larry Brown was coach of the Pacers from 1993-97, finishing with a 190-138 record. Current Indiana assistant Lester Conner played for Brown during the 1993-94 season. … Granger entered the game eighth in the NBA at 23.2 points per game."
