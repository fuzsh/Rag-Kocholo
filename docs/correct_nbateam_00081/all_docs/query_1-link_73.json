        "text": "Former North Carolina Tar Heels player Jalek Felton remains hopeful to hear his name called in the NBA Draft next month. The 6-foot-3 guard has been hard at work preparing for his upcoming opportunity.\n\nFelton, the nephew of Thunder point guard Raymond Felton, most recently played seven games professionally in Finland after he was dismissed from North Carolina in January 2018.\n\nThe former four-star was told by the university to leave campus after only half of a season. His dismissal has not been discussed publicly and Felton opted to play overseas rather than try to return to school.’\n\nFelton played in 22 games for the Tar Heels, averaging 2.9 points and 1.6 assists per game. He averaged 16 points, 7.3 assists and 3.6 rebounds in seven games in Finland.\n\nFelton most recently worked out with the Charlotte Hornets ahead of the NBA Draft. He has leaned on his uncle for advice along the way as he progresses through the process.\n\n“He told me to get in shape ASAP,” Jalek Felton said. “Because if you’re not in shape, you’ll bum it.”\n\nFelton certainly faces a challenge to be drafted next month given his past at North Carolina but he has admitted that was a long time ago. He believes that the situation has allowed him to grow up and become more mature.\n\nHe is not projected to be drafted by any major publication."
