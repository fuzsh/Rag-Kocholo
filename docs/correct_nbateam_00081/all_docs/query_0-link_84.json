        "text": "Oh come on that’s too much. They had Raymond Felton who’s a good point guard and DJ Augustin is at least a solid back up point guard. Obviously the jury is still out on Kemba Walker, but he’ll almost assuredly still start at the point guard spot.\n\nThe Bobcats must have offered him a solid bit of money for him to be willing to be the back up point guard on last years worst team. There had to be some winning teams that would take him as a back up.\n\nSo you think Session is somehow better than Felton? Sessions is at best as good as Raymond Felton. Even with one of Felton’s worst years of his career he averaged 11.4ppg, 2.5 rpg, 6.5 assists, and 2.83 turnovers.(http://www.nba.com/playerfile/raymond_felton/career_stats.html). Compare that to Sessions year last year between the Cavs and Lakers and he averaged 11.3ppg, 3.3rpg, 5.5 assists, and 2.2 turnovers.(http://www.nba.com/playerfile/ramon_sessions/career_stats.html)…Felton is about 2 years older than Sessions.\n\nI’m not saying Felton is a star by any means but he’s a solid point guard. DJ Augustin is also more than enough to be a solid back up point guard on a good team…check the stats(http://www.nba.com/playerfile/dj_augustin/career_stats.html)"
