        "text": "The 35-year-old point guard will join the GBA Jindřichův Hradec starting next April\n\nRaymond Felton, away from the playing fields since last 2019, has sealed an agreement until the end of the season to join the ranks of GBA Jindřichův Hradec of the Czech second division, the portal has reported EuroHoops.\n\nThe 35-year-old point guard was without teams since the end of his respective contract with the Oklahoma City Thunder where he played his last two active seasons (2017-19).\n\n«It should arrive after April 1, but I can't tell you the exact date because right now Raymond (Felton) is taking care of some personal matters at home. We hope that he will come to help us for the playoffs of the first league, and in the worst case he would come for the relegation round of the NBL. There are different options,” general manager Hradec Radek told the official portal of the Czech league.\n\nTrained at the University of North Carolina where he became champion in 2005, Raymond Felton was selected in 5th place in the 2005 Draft by the extinct Charlotte Bobcats. After his time with Michael Jordan's franchise, he played for the New York Knicks for two stages; Denver Nuggets; Portland Trail Blazers; Dallas Mavericks Los Angeles Clippers and lastly the aforementioned Thunder.\n\nIn 971 regular season games, he has career averages of 11,2 points, 5,2 assists, 3 rebounds and 1,2 steals in 29,7 minutes of play.\n\n(Cover photo: Gene Sweeney Jr./Getty Images)"
