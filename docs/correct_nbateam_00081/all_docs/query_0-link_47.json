        "text": "CHARLOTTE, N.C. - Raymond Felton had 23 points and 13 assists against his former team, Amare Stoudemire added 20 points and six blocks, and the New York Knicks beat the Charlotte Bobcats 99-95 on Wednesday night for their fifth straight win.\n\nWith New York leading by two, Felton ripped a rebound away from Tyrus Thomas. Danilo Gallinari then hit the clinching free throws with 5 seconds left for the Knicks, who reached .500 and secured their longest winning streak since the 2005-06 season.\n\nThomas had 26 points and 11 rebounds for Charlotte, which cut a 14-point deficit to one in the closing seconds. But Stephen Jackson's driving layup was blocked by Stoudemire before Landry Fields hit one free throw with 10 seconds left.\n\nRaptors 106, 76ers 90\n\nTORONTO - Andrea Bargnani scored 24 points, Reggie Evans set season highs with 12 points and 20 rebounds and the Toronto Raptors extended their winning streak to four games with a victory over the Philadelphia 76ers.\n\nJose Calderon had 16 points and nine assists, newcomer Jerryd Bayless added 13 points, Leandro Barbosa had 11 and the Raptors matched a season high with nine 3-pointers.\n\nAndre Iguodala scored 17 points, Jrue Holiday had 16 and Thaddeus Young 14 for Philadelphia. The 76ers have lost seven of eight.\n\nToronto started its winning streak with a 94-86 victory at Philadelphia last Wednesday.\n\nThe 76ers trailed 87-71 after three quarters, then cut the gap to 10 at 98-88 on Marreese Speights' consecutive dunks. But Philadelphia didn't score again after Iguodala made two free throws with 3:36 remaining, allowing Toronto to close out a comfortable win.\n\nThe 76ers were without forward Elton Brand, suspended without pay for one game after committing a flagrant foul on Wizards center JaVale McGee on Tuesday night in a 116-114 loss in Washington. Young started in place of Brand.\n\nBayless and forward Peja Stojakovic, acquired Saturday in a trade with New Orleans that sent David Andersen, Marcus Banks and Jarrett Jack to the Hornets, made their Toronto debuts. Bayless played 15 minutes and Stojakovic scored seven points in 6 minutes.\n\nCavaliers 83, Bucks 81\n\nCLEVELAND - Mo Williams dropped a 15-foot jumper over Milwaukee's Brandon Jennings as time expired to give Cleveland a victory over the Bucks, snapping the Cavaliers' three-game losing streak.\n\nWilliams, who finished with 25 points, drove left before pulling up and hitting his step-back jumper as the horn sounded. Williams ran and jumped up on the scorer's table to celebrate hitting a game-winning shot against his former team. However, before it was official, the play had to be reviewed by the referees, who ruled Williams got the shot off in time.\n\nWilliams scored 21 points in the second half. Anthony Parker added 14 and Anderson Varejao had 13 rebounds for Cleveland."
