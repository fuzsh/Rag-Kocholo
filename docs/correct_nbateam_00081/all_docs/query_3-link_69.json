        "text": "The first time Nolan Smith realized Raymond Felton would be his \"Big Bro\" was at a pickup basketball game over the summer at the University of North Carolina.\n\nSmith was making his first appearance at the regular offseason workouts, which feature NBA, college and other professional basketball players, and he was playing point guard on one of the teams when he noticed Felton sitting on the sideline scrutinizing him. After the game, Felton sauntered over to Smith for a one-on-one.\n\n\"It was my first game over at Carolina,\" Smith said, recalling the moment. \"He saw me come in and at first he was just kind of sitting there watching me, seeing what I would do. The he came over and the first thing he said was, 'You've got to work on the pick game.'\"\n\nFelton went on to tell Smith to stay aggressive coming off screens in pick-and-roll sets and to make quick reads once he finds an opening in the play. If the shot is there, Felton told Smith to take it. If not, he told Smith where to look to pass the ball. From that moment, the mentoring hasn't stopped.\n\nWhen the Trail Blazers introduced Felton and Smith during a\n\n, they touted the duo as the franchise's present and future at point guard, proclaiming that they would be a fixture in Portland for years to come. Tonight, when the Utah Jazz visit the Rose Garden in the Blazers' exhibition opener, Blazers fans will get a first look at what this future holds.\n\nThere is a bubbling feeling among the Blazers that the team will be a particularly tight-knit group, that chemistry and togetherness will be trademarks of the lockout-shortened 66-game season. This is particularly evident at point guard, where Felton has pushed ego and competition aside to assume a mentorship role with the rookie Smith.\n\n\"I don't want anyone to ever say that, 'Aw, he didn't help me out because he's still in his prime, he's looking out for himself,'\" Felton said. \"So there's none of that. I'm still hungry. I'm still looking to better myself. But at the same time, if I can help somebody along the way, I'm all for it. That's just the type of teammate I am.\"\n\nThe seed for their budding relationship was planted over the summer during those pickup games at North Carolina. Smith, a Duke graduate, and Felton, who attended North Carolina, live in the state during the offseason and frequented the popular games at Chapel Hill. They rarely, if ever, played on the same team, but Felton paid close attention to Smith.\n\nFelton had watched Smith throughout his career at Duke, and although he held a fair amount of disdain -- Duke is North Carolina's archrival after all -- he also reserved a healthy amount of respect for Smith's passion, year-to-year improvement and knack for excelling through adversity. When the two became teammates on draft night, after the\n\n, Felton knew what he had to do.\n\nBrevin Knight and Muggsy Bogues had shown Felton the ins and outs of the NBA when Felton was a rookie with the Charlotte Bobcats in 2005, and now it was Felton's time to pay it forward. So he reached out to Smith during the summer to jump-start the mentoring and the relationship has only strengthened during training camp.\n\nIt's common during a Blazers practice to see Felton standing next to Smith, whispering advice into his ear or pointing to a spot on the court, offering direction. All the while, Smith is soaking it up.\n\n\"Ray's my big bro,\" Smith said. \"He's like Coach Nate (McMillan), except he's right there on the court with me in my ear. Every day in practice, if there's something he sees that I should be doing better, he points it out. He's just teaching me all the tricks that he's learned over the last seven years. It's been amazing.\"\n\nThe messages range from subtle (how to read a defense in pick-and-roll sets) to specific (avoid going too close to the sideline during a pick-and-roll because it can act as another defender) to profound (you're not in the game to shot 12-15 times, you're there to get the ball to your teammates). It's Basketball 101 and Smith, who has received praise from McMillan for his basketball IQ, has been an A student.\n\nTeammates say Felton has seamlessly blended into the roster, helping usher in a\n\n. And Smith has revealed poise and ability beyond his years, setting himself up to be the team's backup point guard. Along the way, the burgeoning bond between the two has not gone unnoticed to the Blazers' coaching staff.\n\n\"They respect Nolan's game and they've seen him play big-time basketball, so they are willing to lead,\" McMillan said. \"And Nolan is following. He's not avoiding. He's not that rookie that's coming in here shy or out of place. And he's not the guy who's like, 'I got it.' You can see that he wants to learn, that he's trying to absorb. He asks questions. He's a young guy who gets it.\"\n\nAt first blush, their partnership might seem unusual, what with the whole Duke-North Carolina rivalry thing. Felton admitted that he \"doesn't really care for Duke players,\" and Smith said he never imagined a Tar Heel becoming his mentor. Smith has accepted that he will have to wear a North Carolina backpack to games and on the road this season -- at Felton's insistence -- as part of a rookie initiation.\n\nBut, ultimately, the two have traded their different shades of Carolina blue for Blazers black and red. The organization touted then as the future of the organization and they hope that vision becomes reality.\n\n\"I'd love to play with Nolan for years,\" Felton said. \"I'd like to be here for the rest of my career. I feel like I have at least 7-10 years left if I just take care of my body, take care of myself. I feel like I can play for a while. Hopefully after a 5-7 years, when I'm past my prime, I can step down and give the keys to him.\""
