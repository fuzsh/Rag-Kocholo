        "text": "The brick sign welcoming those driving south on U.S. 301 sits in front of two stores: B&R Furniture, and House of Henry Furniture, Gifts and Antiques. A large \"Sale\" sign adorns the door of the latter.\n\nAt 4:56 p.m. on a chilly Friday in December, both businesses are closed and nobody is in sight.\n\nThe police and fire stations are also closed - a note at the police station indicates it won't reopen until Dec. 27 because of the Christmas holiday.\n\nBy 5:30, the only establishments doing business are a sit-down restaurant, a handful of gas stations, a mid-sized grocery store, a Family Dollar, Dollar General and a small watering hole with a single patron.\n\nLatta is hardly the kind of town that produces superstar anythings. And when it comes to basketball, there hadn't been a Division I college player from here \"since the late 1960s,\" said Latta High School basketball coach Sean Johnson.\n\nLatta may lack some amenities of bigger towns. Some might even call it boring.\n\nBut from 2000 to 2002, the three-stoplight town was the center of a high school basketball frenzy.\n\nMeet Raymond Felton, University of North Carolina sophomore guard playing in his homecoming game today against UNC-Wilmington in Myrtle Beach, S.C.\n\n\"We'd get out of class at 3 (p.m.) and\n\nwould rush to the gym to get in line to see that night's game,\" said Kings Restaurant employee Nardine Khalil, a freshman at Wofford College.\n\n\"There would be so many people in line. People would be in lawn chairs and waiting all day to see him (Felton) play.\"\n\nAnd by all accounts, the wait was well worth it.\n\nFelton led Latta to the South Carolina Class A state titles in 2001 and 2002. The Vikings' other state crowns came in 1963 and 1965. Latta's gym seated only 500 people, but somehow 1,000 fans crammed in to see their favorite son. Another 1,000-plus routinely were turned away.\n\nCpl. Tony Gardner of the 10-member Latta Police Department said four officers staffed Latta home games. When the Vikings didn't play, only one officer was on duty.\n\nBut Felton's value went beyond packing gyms. According to several locals, Latta was left off some state maps before he began creating a buzz.\n\n\"He brought in people from everywhere to see him play, and people had come here that never heard of Latta before,\" said Richard Murrell, 42, a local business owner.\n\nA sophomore at North Carolina, Felton's talent is well documented. He was voted the Atlantic Coast Conference preseason player of the year by the media and likely has an NBA future.\n\nRoad to stardom\n\nAll of this from a kid from Latta? How come?\n\n\"Raymond worked hard at his game,\" said Johnson, Latta's first-year coach who faced Felton as the coach at Terrells Bay High School.\n\n\"He had a daddy (Raymond Sr.) that pushed him and he just worked real hard. When people were sleeping, Raymond was probably out dribbling and shooting the basketball. His daddy started him out real young.\"\n\nSo far, that hard work is paying off. Felton enters today's game at the Myrtle Beach Convention Center averaging 11 points, 8.9 assists and four rebounds per game. But more important is his growing leadership role for the Tar Heels, a trait traceable to his roots.\n\nAsk folks in Latta about Felton and non-hoops adjectives flow: humble; well behaved; sweet; genuine; down to earth; respectful; kind; and normal.\n\n\"It's the way I was raised,\" Felton said Saturday at the Embassy Suites Hotel in North Myrtle Beach, S.C.\n\n\"With God's grace, I have (great) parents. They are still together - a two-parent family. Some kids are not fortunate to have two parents in their lives, so I am fortunate.\"\n\nLatta is fortunate to have Felton as one of its own as well, and will show its support as more than 500 people are expected to make the 62-mile trek to see him play today.\n\nFelton appreciates his hometown's support, but also may be a bit embarrassed, too. While he loves basketball and understands his status, he also loves Latta and appreciates the chance to sit down at Kings and eat his chicken tenders.\n\n\"If you know me you know that basketball isn't the first thing you notice,\" he said. \"If you see me you probably won't even think I'm a basketball player. I'm just a normal laid back guy that enjoys spending time with people.\"\n\nNo matter where Felton is, he is comfortable in his own skin. That's how he was raised, by his parents and a tiny town called Latta.\n\nAndrew Jones can be reached at\n\nandrew.jones@starnewsonline.com"
