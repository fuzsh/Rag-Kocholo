        "text": "With James in South Beach yesterday celebrating the formation of “The Dream Team,” Knicks president Donnie Walsh continued using up his cap space by closing in on a much-needed point guard in free agent Raymond Felton, who spent the last five seasons with Charlotte. A source said Felton is coming on a three-year deal worth $8.5 million per year, with the final year not guaranteed.\n\nThe Nets have considered Udonis Haslem, but he probably will stay in Miami. Houston’s Luis Scola is another possibility, but he’s also restricted and the Rockets would likely match any offer. The Nets also need a backup point guard, and the Lakers’ Jordan Farmar is a top candidate. Charlotte’s Raymond Felton likely would not come as a backup."
