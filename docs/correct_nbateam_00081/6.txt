Free agent point guard Raymond Felton–a key piece of UNC’s 2005 national championship team–agreed Wednesday to re-sign with the Oklahoma City Thunder on a one-year contract worth approximately $2.4 million.

The Thunder are the eighth team Felton has played for in his 13-year NBA career, which began when he was a first-round draft pick by the Charlotte Bobcats back in 2005.

This past season saw the South Carolina native serve as a steady hand coming off the bench for Oklahoma City, as he averaged 6.9 points and 2.5 assists per game in the primary backup role behind former MVP Russell Westbrook.

Felton also played in all 82 of the Thunder’s games in 2017-18. Over the course of his career, he’s posted averages of 11.4 points and 5.4 assists per outing.

By signing his new contract for this upcoming season, Felton puts the Thunder’s payroll–which includes a significant penalty for going over the luxury tax threshold–over $300 million.
