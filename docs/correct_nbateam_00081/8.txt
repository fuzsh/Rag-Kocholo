CHARLOTTE | Former North Carolina teammates Raymond Felton and Sean May took another step together in their basketball careers, both signing with the Charlotte Bobcats on Thursday.

The pair was taken in the first round of NBA Draft after helping the Tar Heels win the NCAA championship and forgoing their final season of eligibility.

Financial terms of their deals were not disclosed, but under the pending collective bargaining agreement both rookies are signed through the 2006-07 season. Charlotte would hold two one-year options on each player after that.

Felton, the fifth overall pick, averaged 12.9 points, 6.9 assists and 2 steals last season as a point guard.

"This is a dream come true, it's a wonderful feeling," Felton said. "I'm an NBA basketball player now. I'm a pro now. This is what it's all about. This is what all of the hard work paid off for."

May, a 6-9 forward, was named the Final Four MVP after scoring 26 points and grabbing 10 rebounds against Illinois in the national title game. He was taken 13th overall.

"It's an opportunity to play in the NBA, play here close to Chapel Hill where I played college basketball," May said. "The people in the community here and in Chapel Hill have been great and very supportive. It's going to be fun, and I'm extremely excited about the opportunity that's ahead of me."

Felton and May will play with the Bobcats summer league team at the Reebok Rocky Mountain Revue from July 15-22.
