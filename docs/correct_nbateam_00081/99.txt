INDIANAPOLIS — Raymond Felton tied a career high with 31 points and the Charlotte Bobcats beat the Indiana Pacers 115-108 in overtime on Friday night.

Jason Richardson finished with 21 points, D.J. Augustin scored 17 and Gerald Wallace added 16 points and 11 rebounds for the Bobcats (5-10), who won for just the second time in their past seven games.

Charlotte’s Emeka Okafor had 14 points and 20 rebounds.

Danny Granger scored a season-high 35 points, and Marquis Daniels and T.J. Ford each had 20 for the Pacers (6-9).

Charlotte tied it at 97 on Okafor’s layup, and following baskets by both teams, the Pacers had a chance to win in the closing seconds, but Granger’s jumper over a leaping Okafor was no good.
