        "text": "I remember the first time I ever heard a Screw tape. It was in the summer of 1998, and I was riding in a friend’s car near my home in Jackson, Mississippi, when he popped in a DJ Screw tape to get my feedback. My first reaction was telling him that his tape was dragging. (Remember how tape decks used to eat tapes?) It doesn’t take long to get from one end of Jackson to the other, and the song wasn’t even finished by the time we got to where we were going. It all seemed too slow.\n\nTo someone outside of the Screw community, it seems weird to listen to music that’s been slowed to a snail’s pace exclusively, but, like sushi, screw music is an acquired taste and enjoyed best on its home turf.\n\nYou can appreciate the music superficially as an outsider, but until you travel to Houston and immerse yourself in the city’s hip-hop culture, you’re not going to truly understand screw music. It took me several trips to H-Town covering the city’s hip-hop scene and hearing screw music blaring out of various peoples’ cars that I came to understand and respect the genre.\n\nMy true epiphany happened back in the summer of 2007 when I flew to Houston for a music conference. My friend, DJ Dirty Dave of Street Pharmacy picked me up from William P. Hobby Airport bumping his group’s latest mixtape. I hopped in and we hit the slab (the highway) headed for the venue. Typical of most young Texans back then, Dave had a huge car with a stereo that had an even bigger sound. It took us a full 30 minutes to get to the venue and the music stretched to fill the time in the car. I remember listening to what seemed like a 10-minute chopped and screwed version of Slim Thug’s song “Boss Hoggin’” and thinking to myself, “Life doesn’t get any better than this.” I had become a bonafide screwhead.\n\nDJ Screw had passed away seven years earlier, but he had created a sound that represented Houston. He didn’t just change how I listen to music, he made a lasting impact on hip-hop. Whether you are just learning about DJ Screw or a longtime fan, hop in and I’ll take you for a spin through his legacy.\n\nThe evolution of the mixtape runs parallel with the growth and development of hip-hop culture. In mid-70s New York, hip-hop fans would go to park jams and parties and make homemade recordings of pioneering DJs, such as DJ Hollywood, DJ Kool Herc, Afrika Bambaataa, Grand Wizard Theodore, and Grandmaster Flash, and sell or trade these tapes to other fans. These homemade copies would be copied many times over and sold up and down the East Coast, eventually making their way around the country, spreading hip-hop culture wherever they were played.\n\nIn the ’80s, DJs like Brucie B decided to get in on the act, recording and selling professional quality tapes of their DJ gigs. This gave way to DJs such as Kid Capri, Doo Wop, and Ron G who took the genre even further by introducing exclusive music, remixes, and freestyles into the mix. At this point, the mixtape had begun to gain some national popularity with hip-hop fans globally, but in the ’80s it was still largely an East Coast thing.\n\nAll that would change by the late ’90s when Southern hip-hop finally came into its own with groundbreaking artists like UGK, the Geto Boys, Outkast, Goodie Mob, and 8Ball & MJG. Along with the rise of these Southern-based artists came a slew of mixtape DJs such as DJ B-Lord out of South Carolina and DJ Jelly and DJ Drama out of Atlanta.\n\nBut, of all of the Southern mixtape DJs, no one has impacted hip-hop like the late Houston-based mixtape king/producer, DJ Screw, creator of the turntable technique known as chopped and screwed or Screw Music as it is commonly called by fans known as “screwheads.”\n\nTo this day, Screw tapes are held in high esteem throughout the Southwest and the rest of the world. They are copied and circulated via fans on the internet, mom and pop stores, and street vendors, also known as bootleggers.\n\n“Screw is [like] DJ Clue or Funkmaster Flex down here,” says Marcus Edwards, better known as Lil’ Keke, a member of DJ Screw’s collective of rappers known as the Screwed Up Click. “When he was doing the mix tapes that shit was like it. At one point in time that’s all people was really listening to was them Screw tapes.”"
