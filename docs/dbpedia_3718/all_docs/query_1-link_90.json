        "text": "Big Thief's drummer James Krivchenia (whose latest solo album A New Found Relaxation was released last week) picks “songs that inspire [him], scare [him], make [him] move and change [his] mind.” Meditative and insistent, these tracks are perfect for reflection.\n\nChicago innovator and one of the most influential figures in deep house history, Ron Trent has been a mainstay on dancefloors for three decades now. Irresistible grooves from one of the best to ever do it.\n\nEven in her more upbeat moments, Kedr Livanskiy’s music evokes a kind of hazy stasis. It's no surprise then that her mix for Bandcamp Week seems to hover, shimmering in the half-light, finding pockets of tenderness even in the often-frantic works of artists like Fugazi and Sporting Life.\n\nAs one half of Glasgow’s totemic Optimo, JD Twitch is one of the most beloved figures in Scottish club culture. Eclectic to a peerless degree, this mix sees him indulging the haunting, esoteric corners of his taste, before building to a riotous, abrasive conclusion.\n\nIn between putting the finishing touches to an upcoming debut EP, 6 Figure Gang’s Jossy Mitsu pulls no punches with this mix: a hectic, high-tempo shell-down.\n\nOne of Tokyo’s most prolific DJs, Lil Mofo is as comfortable playing icy, contorted club music as she is the warmer sounds of dancehall and dub. Here she starts with the former, knotty electro sounds eventually softening to make way for UKG, dub and more soulful sounds at 160 BPM.\n\nKelman Duran’s approach to making music is one of unbridled bursts of creativity, with a tireless work-rate and impossibly high level of consistency. His mix sees him blending body moving rhythms, sci-fi experimentalism and overwrought emotions, well beyond the ambient reggaeton he made his name for.\n\nColombian-Canadian artist Lido Pimienta is one of Canada’s most celebrated champions of Latinx music. Her mix sees her drawing from dembow rhythms, hazy electronica, Spanish psych rock, cumbia and more.\n\nCombining her fearless will for experimentation and sense of humour, AYA comes through with \"a collection of the most exciting music I’ve heard this year. As ever I urge you to engage with my sole guiding principle: Yes come on. Embrace the clang!”\n\nOne of the hardest working and most highly respected artists coming out of NYC right now, Kush Jones' mix moves through many styles and textures but owes most to the frenetic 160 BPM sounds that were incubated in Chicago. A master at work.\n\nPlaying an eye–watering number of tracks in just 90 minutes, Scratcha brings the spirit of his classic Rinse shows to this mix, plugging releases new, old and forthcoming from artists across UK funky, gqom, experimental electronics, footwork and mutated 140.\n\nLa Vendicion’s Paul Marmota is a leading light in slow-burning, atmospheric reggaeton, channelling wistful futurism in his productions. His mix is a steady bop, hard-hitting drums underpinning icy and sparse instrumentation.\n\nUsually found at the outskirts of dance music, Mount Kimbie’s Kai Campos shows how strong the duo's ties with the club really are with this thumping mix of galloping techno, acid and electro.\n\nIncendiary California hardcore band Trash Talk deliver a melting pot of hip-hop, footwork, punk, hardcore and afrobeat, made up of respected favourites and artists in their extended community.\n\nPeruvian-American artist, DJ and rising neoperreo star TECH GRL digs deep into her favourite tracks and edits for a Bandcamp Week mix she describes as \"dark\" and \"apocalyptic.\" Recorded at Neoperreo Studios in Los Angeles, this set is both hyped-up and steady, balancing a sense of menace and mischief throughout.\n\nPost-reunion, Daughters have added an air of authority to their noisy, intricate brand of punk, becoming elder statesmen of high-concept, high-energy rock. Here, drummer Jon Syverson and guitarist Nick Sadler choose an array of tracks, ranging from the confessional and delicate to the contorted and guttural.\n\nDJ Sustancia embodies neoperreo's embrace of cut-and-paste sonic experimentation and ostentatious aesthetic. This mix, sprinkled with her own productions, encapsulates much of what makes this decentralised scene one of the most exciting in the world.\n\nFAUZIA’s mix, closing out our week of Bandcamp-exclusive sets, is an affirmation of her chops as a DJ, moving from patient, soulful beginnings to her trademark frenzy via several twists in the tale. As she describes it, this is “an accurate representation of the depth and versatility of Black artists - a diverse range of Black art.”"
