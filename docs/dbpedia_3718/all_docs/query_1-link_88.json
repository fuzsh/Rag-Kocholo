        "text": "The first time Southern California-based singer-songwriter Brad Colerick heard himself referred to as an emerging artist, it made him laugh. He wondered how long it might be before he fully emerged. After independently releasing six solo albums, he now claims to be just that, and responded to requests by longtime fans by putting out Emerging Artist, a compilation album of their favorite songs from his catalog. Released in 2023, Emerging Artist gathers material frequently requested at his concerts, plus personally meaningful tracks from each of his previous albums as well as several new recordings. Themes of hope and community stitch together the collection — uplifting reminders of what has drawn listeners to the prolific Nebraska native’s music and shows since he released his album Cottonwood in 2006.\n\nColerick often tries out his new songs out at Wine & Song, the weekly showcase for local and touring artists he’s been hosting in South Pasadena for 14 years. The series has become the hub of a supportive community of musicians, songwriters, and fans. Onstage, Colerick — the so-called Nighttime Mayor of South Pasadena — is a cheerfully engaging presence, bantering with audience members and sharing stories between numbers.\n\nBrad is also an Emmy award-winning producer, music supervisor, and composer of music for commercials. Credits include projects for Coca-Cola, Budweiser, Nike, JCPenney, Sears, McDonalds, Taco Bell and other top brands. He has recorded and produced celebrity talent including Diplo, Johnny Cash, BB King, Shawn Colvin, Buddy Guy, Take 6, DMC, Amy Grant, Peter Noone, and many others.\n\nJoining Brad for our concert will be Steve Hanson on mandolin and banjo, and Jim Pipher on bass.\n\nHere’s what others are saying about Brad Colerick:\n\n“One of a baker's dozen of acts to watch in the folk community around the world” - Billboard Magazine\n\n“Colerick's stories are worth hearing… His warm, sunny, homey tenor brings alive the characters, places and relationships in these 11 songs.” — Associated Press\n\nOpening acts: Joseph Teichman, Craig Walter\n\n(+++ ABOUT OUR OPENING ACTS +++)\n\n+++ NO ADVANCE TICKET SALES. ADMISSION IS FIRST-COME, FIRST-SERVED AT THE DOOR. +++\n\nDoors open at 6:15 pm; concert starts at 7:00 pm with two opening acts. $15 general admission, $8 members and students with ID; free for ages 12 and younger (become a member before or at the show and $tart $aving right away!). Open jam near the front door from 5-6:30. All are welcome, to play, or just to listen!\n\nNo advance ticket sales. Admission only at the door.\n\n+++ Free, off-street parking is available in the church lot across the street from our hall. +++\n\nBaked goods, coffee, tea, and water available for purchase in the Community Center.\n\nInternationally acclaimed artist-songwriter David G. Smith is an acoustic roots solo performer with a lyric-intensive style featuring guitars, resonators, and a voice that range from dirt-funk to intimate. His music is a blend of folk, Americana, country, and blues. David was recently accepted as a Juried Artist by Noel Paul Stookey Music-To-Life, is a 2008 International Song Competition 1st Place Winner, a Robert Oermann DISCovery award recipient, and a two-time ISC Semifinalist. He performs at the prestigious Bluebird Cafe in Nashville where his shows are regularly sold out.\n\nDavid has released 11 albums, several with appearances by Mary Gauthier and Keb Mo. He has three nationwide #1 singles and four nationwide #1 albums including his latest release, Witness Trees, which is on the Roots Music Report (RMR) Folk & Alt-Folk Charts. His single “River Gonna Talk,” was a nationwide 2023 #1 on the NACC chart and reached #1 in the nation on Radio Guitar One's Top 30 Americana Chart. David has been featured in American Songwriter and his songs have appeared on TNT, Lifetime Network, Travel Channel , several PBS affiliates shows, and he has a string of indie & major-indie song-cuts. His last 4 albums have been accepted for Grammy consideration. His Give-Back series donates time and raises money and awareness for a variety of charitable causes. David, his voice, and his songs, are authentic.\n\n“I have walked beside David G Smith for many, many years, and I am in awe of his body of work.

The Redstone Review calls Beth “a Celtic angel…with all her heart in it,” and Sing Out! says “lovely, with a light, bouncy energy…her voice often acting as an instrument in itself.“\n\nFolksinger Beth Gadbaw grew up singing harmonies with her triplet sisters in a musical household in Western Colorado. Gadbaw came of age singing in Irish pubs and English folk clubs, and is a former Fulbright scholar and award-winning singer, composer, and teacher. She lives in Lyons, Colorado with her husband and two daughters.\n\nBeth was drawn to Irish music at the age of seven upon discovering what it meant to be Irish-American. Her mother's side of the family hailed from upstate New York, having emigrated to America during the Great Famine. Her love of learning about her family history first took her to Ireland in 1996 where she attended the Joe Mooney and Willie Clancy Summer Schools; subsequent summers found her camping on the beach at Miltown Malbay rising early to jump into the Atlantic before heading to trad singing classes and sessions until the wee hours of the morning. After completing her Masters in Music Education at the University of Colorado with an emphasis in Ethnomusicology, she returned to Ireland as a continuing education student at the National University of Ireland, Galway, where she studied Irish Gaelic in evening classes in the city and attended residential intensives in Connemara.\n\nIt was not until spending a Fulbright year in Devon, England, that Beth fell in love with English folksong, attending folk clubs in the moors and on the shores of Devon and Cornwall. She bolstered her music-teaching income by busking on the picturesque, rainy streets of the villages of Southwest England, carrying her 26 string harp and her hat to collect pennies and pounds, singing all the way.\n\nGadbaw's debut solo album The Green Fields and the Mountains High is a compelling collection of traditional and original songs in English and Irish Gaelic. Beth approaches ballads, drinking songs, and sean-nos repertoire with rare strength and sensitivity, at times bold, at times demure, always passionately and skillfully. In 2016, Beth was commissioned to set the poetry of Welsh Poet Laureate Gwyneth Lewis for four-part choral voices. Her voice has appeared in productions for stage, for Colorado and Oregon Public Television, and on various recordings. She has made guest appearances with the Chieftains and has opened for The Battlefield Band, Lunasa, and The Seamus Egan Project. Most recently, she has toured with Fiddler Sandra Wong and acclaimed bouzouki player Roger Landes.\n\nJoining Beth will be Sandra Wong, who delights with mesmerizing melodies on fiddle and on the antiquated Swedish nyckelharpa. Colorado legend Steve Mullins completes the trio on guitar and mandolin. Artistic, imaginative, and skillful, Gadbaw, Mullins and Wong evoke ancient Celtic and world roots.\n\nOpening acts: Old No. 1, Scott Krokoff\n\n(+++ ABOUT OUR OPENING ACTS +++)\n\n+++ NO ADVANCE TICKET SALES.

Luke took up the fiddle at age seven. Over the course of the next few years, he won the National Fiddle Contest in Weiser, Idaho, six times in his respective age categories. His seventh win came in the Grand Champion division at age sixteen, making him the youngest to have earned the title at the time.\n\nIn the spring of 1999, Luke moved to Nashville to establish himself as a full time musician. He spent his early years in Tennessee playing fiddle in Ricky Skaggs’ band, Kentucky Thunder, which earned him his first Grammy Award. Following the Skaggs stint, he became a member of the John Cowan Band. Luke has also performed and/or recorded with Brandi Carlile, Jim Lauderdale, Darrell Scott, Alison Krauss, Jerry Douglas, Sam Bush, Edgar Meyer, Bela Fleck, Bryan Sutton, Shawn Colvin, Tony Rice, Chris Thile, Peter Rowan, Patty Griffin, Glen Phillips, Rodney Crowell, Earl Scruggs, and many others. Luke was also a perennial instructor at Mark O’Connor’s fiddle camps in his early Nashville years.\n\nIn 2009, Luke released a solo EP featuring Jerry Douglas, Sam Bush, Bela Fleck, Aoife O’Donovan and many more. That same year, Lyle Lovett asked Luke to join his Large Band, with whom he toured full time until 2023.\n\nLuke released the LP, Who Loves You Better, produced by Bryan Sutton, in May 2016. After many years as a sideman, Luke is currently touring the country playing solo performances.\n\nOpening acts: Beans and Biscuits, Ava Grace\n\n(+++ ABOUT OUR OPENING ACTS +++)\n\n+++ NO ADVANCE TICKET SALES.

Their concerts combine high-energy upbeat bluegrass/roots inspired compositions, beautiful ballads with soaring vocals and heartfelt lyrics, and groovy feel-good songs that audiences will be singing in their heads for weeks thereafter.\n\nBettman and Halpin create an authentic connection with their audience - they have become known for their storytelling and playful banter as much as for their whole-hearted songs and instrumental wizardry.\n\nBettman and Halpin have been touring as a duo since 2008, and can be found performing at various arts centers throughout the US as well as some of the biggest folk and bluegrass festivals. Their music creates a fully acoustic, delightfully eclectic sound far greater than the sum of its parts, taking the listener from up-tempo down-home fiddling, to soulful sorrowful ballads, to super hooky folk/pop with catchy melodies and lyrics.\n\nStephanie Bettman is a true triple threat. An accomplished writer, singer, and fiddler, her lyrics are infused with wit and wisdom, poetry, and insight. Vocally she draws comparison to the soaring soprano of Joan Baez and the plaintive emotion of Emmylou Harris. Meanwhile, her fiddling, which combines elements of bluegrass and jazz, is inspired by such masters as Stephane Grappelli and Byron Berline. A former actress and trapeze artist, Ms. Bettman creates an authentic connection with her crowd no matter what the size.\n\nLuke Halpin is a renowned multi-insrumentalist. A master of the guitar, mandolin, fiddle, and banjo, Halpin draws inspiration from the likes of Sam Bush, Mark O’Connor, and Tony Rice. A dynamic and sensitive vocalist himself, the harmony blend he and Ms. Bettman achieve is at times simply transcendent. Halpin has a long history in the music biz, having shared the stage with the likes of Merle Haggard, Lone Star, and The Steve Miller Band, just to name a few. His quirky sense of humor is a perfect foil to Stephanie's dry witty presence.\n\nBettman & Halpin's 5 CDs have received national and international radio play along with critical acclaim, reaching the top 3 on “Folk DJ Radio” and number 1 on “The Roots Mosic Report.”\n\nHere’s what others are saying about Bettman and Halpin:\n\n“Storytellers in the fireside tradition.\" - The Pasadena.Star\n\n''...emotive, Joan Baez-inspired vocals, award-winning fiddle playing, head-spinning mandolin and guitar picking, and velvety, close harmonies..\" - Music News Nashville\n\nOpening acts: Vincent Chavez, Ukulady with Ceruleus\n\n(+++ ABOUT OUR OPENING ACTS +++)\n\n+++ NO ADVANCE TICKET SALES.

When Sarah Anderson and Paul DeHaven met and began playing together in 2004, they had no idea just how deep the well of their musical partnership would prove to be. After the disbanding of indie-folk sweethearts Paper Bird, the duo founded Heavy Diamond Ring and never looked back. HDR is the culmination of their signature sound: a fountain of open-hearted folk-rock, steeped in vocal harmony and group synergy.\n\nLed by Anderson's smooth-as-honey vocals and DeHaven's rugged guitar chops, the band has been described as \"open-road, long drive music,\" having \"a little bit of twang and a whole lot of beef,” and their live show as \"infectious and contagious.\" The band is rounded out by veteran knockouts Blake Stepan on bass, Mike Lang on keys, and Orion Tate Ignelzi on percussion. Last fall’s second full-length LP, All Out of Angels, produced by Ben Wysocki and Mark Anderson, features a duet with Nathaniel Rateliff.\n\nHere’s what others are saying about Heavy Diamond Ring:\n\n\"Heavy Diamond Ring creates a sound that feels as classic as rolling down the windows in the summer - a super highway to a new frontier.\" - 303 Magazine\n\n\"...a helping of contemporary indie-folk that goes down easy, augmented by some subtle, snaky guitar work, walls of harmony vocals and Anderson's attention-grabbing vocals.\" - CS Indy\n\nOpening acts: Amore, David Khaliqi\n\n(+++ ABOUT OUR OPENING ACTS +++)\n\n+++ NO ADVANCE TICKET SALES.

The show will be conducted a little differently from most of our shows. In place of our normal opening acts, we will have special guests perform, make presentations, and tell stories highlighting the history of the Black Rose. During intermission we will distribute cupcakes and sparkling cider to all of our guests and celebrate with a toast to the Black Rose. Raul and New West will then take the stage and put on an hour show.\n\nAbout New West: New West is all about songwriting that celebrates the working cowboy, music in the western swing style with hints of Django Reinhardt’s own guitar stylings, and music that entertains, by performers who love what they do. New West is a winner of The Will Rogers Award for Best Western Group, Academy of Western Artists. Mike Fleming writes beautiful songs about the West and about cowboys. Not the fantasy cowboys of the movies, but the genuine article. To bring his songs to life, he assembled a dynamic vocal trio with David Jackson and Raul Reynoso. Their voices blend smoothly, and their harmonies are crafted artfully. Can you call a 3-piece group a band? When one of the three is Raul Reynoso, yes. One of the finest acoustic guitarists in the business (and with New West he doubles on mandolin with comparable skill), his tasteful solos and fills give each song even greater depth and character. Add to the mix the extraordinary musicianship and showpiece vocals of David Jackson, and you have New West.\n\nRaul Reynoso's incredible instrumental & vocal talent has made him one of California's most sought after musicians and performers. Raul has played at the Grand Old Opry and recorded an LP with Larry McNeely titled \"Power Play.\" He is a two-time Western Regional flatpicking champion who has been nominated three times for best instrumentalist by the Western Music Association. For ten years he was the lead member of the \"Thunder Mountain Boys\" and \"The Rhythm Brothers\" at Disneyland. He is most noted for his expertise on acoustic guitar and mandolin with a mastery of styles ranging from bluegrass and western swing to 30's jazz in the tradition of the legendary Django Reinhardt. Raul has released his own CD entitled “Royal Street.”\n\nMichael Fleming was raised at the foot of the Colorado Rockies. There he developed a profound love for the West and its people that has compelled him to create music celebrating its culture. He has been described by reviewers as “a creative and perceptive songwriter” whose work is “among the most innovative in Western Music.” Mike writes most of the original material for New West and won the Academy of Western Artists (AWA) 1997 Will Rogers Award/Best Western Swing Song for his composition, “Sometimes This Old Cowboy Gets the Blues,” as well as the 1997 Western Music Association/Song of the Year and 1998 AWA Best Song with co-writer, Les Buffham, for ”Below the Kinney Rim.“\n\nDavid Jackson, bass player extraordinaire, is much in demand as a studio musician and voice-over artist. He is known for his infectious enthusiasm and humor and has wowed audiences across the country with his prowess and versatility on bass, piano, and accordion. In 1996 Dave was honored by the California Country Music Association as Best Instrumentalist. He has played and sung with luminaries such as Kenny Rogers, Hoyt Axton, Cher, Jackson Browne and Dwight Yoakum, to name a few. His true love is music and poetry about the West. He brings abundant experience and heart to this sweet singin' trio.\n\n+++ $30 ADVANCE TICKET SALES THROUGH OUR WEBSITE AND AT THE DOOR. +++\n\nDoors open at 6:15 pm; concert starts at 7:00 pm.\n\nNO ADVANCE TICKET SALES.

It’s said that every band has its beat, and this one pulses to the rhythm of something delightfully out of the ordinary.\n\nAaron Walker, the maestro of mischief, once dreamt up a symphony of sounds so vivid, it could only take shape in the real world through the imagination of a band of misfit musicians who are half Nikola Telsa, three quarters Alton Brown, and twenty-five percent Toney Stark.\n\nSwing Je T’aime wasn’t just a band; it was a movement on a melodious mission, spinning stories through strings and serenades. The five troubadours - Aaron (guitar), Laura (vocals), Luke (guitar), Gary (bass) and Manuel (drums), each a virtuoso with a touch of vaudeville - set out to conquer hearts one plucky tune at a time.\n\nFrom the frost-kissed landscapes of Iceland to the effervescent buzz of Germany, they’ve swung up everything from quaint town squares to grand festival stages. With Laura’s voice leading the charge - a honeyed voice that hypnotizes unsuspecting listeners - they’ve left audiences utterly enchanted, spellbound, and delighted.\n\nAs time waltzed on, Swing Je T’aime became not just a band, but a group of cherished friends; notorious for turning the mundane into the magical. They’ve become the acoustic alchemists of the jazz world, known for crafting gold out of mere musical notes.\n\nGypsy swing, old standards, new classics, American Songbook, and mashed up pop tunes, there isn’t anything they won’t reshape, remake, and reimagine.\n\nOpening acts: Kevin Mastin, Frank Moore\n\n(+++ ABOUT OUR OPENING ACTS +++)\n\n+++ NO ADVANCE TICKET SALES.

They've been performing on and off for 30 years, making laughter and music as easily as breathing Rocky Mountain air. Their covers of Crosby, Stills and Nash are the stuff of local legend and their originals are listener friendly, thoughtful, funny, and filled with harmony.\n\nKJ Braithwaite, a rock and rockabilly guitar wizard, feels guitar in the same way as Eric Clapton -less is more, and space makes the music speak. With 40 plus years of playing guitar and 4 albums under his belt, he is also one of the finest songwriters in the region.\n\nJim Sokol has been part of 4 albums with Joe Uveges including the critically acclaimed \"Up Please,\" a 2008 release that also features Phil Volan. His voice could be Irish Tenor, it could be Sting, it could be David Grey. He never fails to have just the right quip for the moment, often at the expense of one of his fun-loving mates. He also brings understated percussion for this acoustic sound with the occasional soulful harmonica solo.\n\nJoe Uveges has become a fixture on the C.S. music scene with 5 Gazette \"Best Of's” including 2011 and 2012 \"Best Solo Musician\" awards, publishing credits in film and with Goodnight Kiss Music out of CA. He has 9 original albums released, the latest recorded in Nashville with Stephanie Pauline (When theSmoke Clears). He is one of the most engaging performers in Colorado Springs with his legendary \"On the spot\" songwriting skills that make every event once in a lifetime.\n\nOpening acts: Grapefruit Moon, Grant and Betsy\n\n(+++ ABOUT OUR OPENING ACTS +++)\n\n+++ NO ADVANCE TICKET SALES.

The result is a toe-tapping mix of haunting standards, genre-bending arrangements, and catchy original numbers—all built on the bedrock of their collective bluegrass mastery.\n\nEver since founding members Jason Hicks and Gary Dark launched the Blue Canyon Boys in 2006, the Blue Canyon Boys have raised the bar for bluegrass bands. They bring it all: seamless brother-duet style, crisp instrumentation, unvarnished lyrics and subversive humor.\n\nAfter winning first place in the 2008 Telluride Bluegrass festival band contest, the Blue Canyon Boys went off at full tilt, taking the bluegrass circuit by storm, performing in illustrious venues both across the country and internationally. Their distinctive sound, honed from over a decade of performing together, moves easily from instrumental wizardry to playful ribbing, ultimately and repeatedly hitting a high note—the rare confluence of harmony that leaves the soul ajar.\n\nThe seasoned quartet features Gary Dark on mandolin, Jason Hicks on guitar, Drew Garrett on bass, and Chris Roszell on banjo. Their latest album, aptly titled “7,” is perhaps their most polished and poignant yet. Classic bluegrass, clean and raw, blended effortlessly with the band’s homegrown compositions, then peppered with a judicious cover or two, such as the band’s riveting take on Warren Zevon’s “Carmelita,” or Queen’s “Fat Bottomed Girls.”\n\nWhether calling on their old timey musical roots or reconnoitering the future, the band’s musical prowess never wavers. This is high lonesome sound at its best: a driving pulse that weaves through harmonies and fierce rhythms, always with the reminder that as long as the music plays we are never quite alone.\n\nOpening act: Colorado College Bluegrass Ensemble\n\n(+++ ABOUT OUR OPENING ACTS +++)\n\n+++ NO ADVANCE TICKET SALES.

None better to start with than Adam Gardino who since 2005 has been an “up-and-coming” fingerstyle guitarist, musician and songwriter in the Pikes Peak region. His style combines the smoothness of James Taylor and the energy of Brad Paisley to deliver exciting, jaw-dropping performances. His attention to the intricacies of acoustic guitar arrangements, delivered with a voice as clear as his mountain roots continues to wow audiences today.\n\nAt the age of 16, Adam placed in the Top Five of the International Fingerstyle Competition held in Winfield, Kansas. He kept competing in the annual contest, honing his skills and stage craft, hoping to eventually squash those pre-show jitters. Though the butterflies never flew away, in 2010 he placed 3rd behind Pete Huttlinger and Japan’s Grand Champion Akihiro Tanaka. After graduating from University of Colorado Denver in 2012 with a B.S. in Music Performance, he took 1st at 23 years old - among the youngest ever to win. And most recently in 2019 he re-entered again, after the 5 year mandatory hiatus for 1st Place winners - and won for a second time.\n\nWhile working as a musician in Colorado Springs, Adam caught the eye of the legendary cowboy chuck-wagon group the Flying W Wranglers. He joined them in 2014, and for 5 years he grew in knowledge and experience from the best country and western musicians in the business. This opportunity gave him room to expand on his soloing abilities, his singing and his chops as an entertainer while continuing to perform all around the western states. Highlights included playing for the Western Music Association, the Academy of Western Artists, the annual Chuckwagons of the West Jamboree, and opening for country star Josh Turner at the Flathead County Fair in August of 2018.\n\nFans love the friendly, easy-going demeanor Adam has on and off the stage. Quick to break down the “invisible barrier” between performer and audience, goofy-but-true stories and jokes often accompany the high-flying stunts attempted on the fretboard. As one critic would write, \"He could play the phonebook and make it interesting\".\n\nAlthough Adam possesses great arranging abilities for tunes like “Peter Gunn”, “Rikki Don’t Lose That Number”, “On Broadway” and “Pink Panther”, some of the most requested tunes are his hilarious original songs. “Dentist Chair Blues” covers an untimely tooth appointment; “Filthy Rich” talks of the lengths one might go to marry for money, and “Procrastinate” personifies that “evil” voice everyone hears inside their head on most frosty mornings. These tunes are included on his multiple CD releases.\n\nOh, and Adam is one of the most popular teachers in the Black Rose Music School, teaching a variety of fingerstyle and related guitar classes.\n\nOpening acts: John Spengler, Jerm Boor\n\n(+++ ABOUT OUR OPENING ACTS +++)\n\n+++ NO ADVANCE TICKET SALES.

David Berkeley’s gift as a songwriter and storyteller is that he sees the tragedy and comedy in life, writing songs capable of both breaking and healing the heart. Berkeley has been called a “musical poet,” by the San Francisco Chronicle, and the New York Times praises his “lustrous, melancholy voice with shades of Tim Buckley and Nick Drake.” That voice and his gift with words is what first sets Berkeley apart from all other guitar slinging songwriters.\n\nBut it is his onstage charisma and unparalleled between-song repartee that truly puts him in a class by himself. Each show is truly unique, and his humanity shines through every note he sings and every word he speaks. Berkeley has released seven studio albums, one live album, and authored two books, each of which pairs with one of his albums. He has won many songwriting awards and honors including ASCAPs Johnny Mercer Songwriting Award. His 2017 release was a never-before tried concept: a novella comprising ten intertwining stories and an album of ten accompanying songs (one for each story). His latest release is Oh Quiet World, an album written during the lockdown after his family escaped Spain during to Corona. It’s an intimate and uplifting collection that we all need to hear right now.\n\nDavid lives with his wife and two boys in Santa Fe, New Mexico. In addition to his solo career, he is also one half of the wildly creative Trans-Atlantic costumed duo Son of Town Hall. Berkeley’s music has also been remixed by many of the world’s top EDM DJs. He tours all over the country and world and has opened/toured with Dido, Don McLean, Ben Folds, Billy Bragg, Ray Lamontagne, Nickel Creek, and many more. He was a Kerrville New Folk winner, and a New Song and Rocky Mountain Folks Festival Finalist.

Focussing on the studio and songwriting, he continued to produce, write and record throughout 2021, coming up with material for 2021’s Dead Lovers and Hollywood Reality and 2022’s Life Blood & Tears.

Born in the seaport city of Genova and raised on American flatpicking, he developed a unique captivating guitar and performance style.\n\nFrom a young acoustic guitarist channeling Italian and American folk and bluegrass into a signature style, he became a singer, composer, arranger, sound engineer and concert producer. At age 65 he has added one more title: Poet. It turns out he has a lot to say about roots, role models, the road and artistic freedom.\n\nBeppe is beloved all over the world, gaining new fans and friends with every performance and every new recording. Where The Wind Blows is no exception and may be his best one yet. In 2019 Beppe was awarded with the title of “Genoa Ambassador To The World” by the Genoa Mayor Marco Bucci.\n\nHere’s what others have to say about Beppe:\n\n“…and he expresses himself in a voice of unhurried warmth and passion.” (Alan Tigay, World Listening Post)\n\n“His incredible versatility combined with his charm and engaging stage presence make Beppe’s concerts evenings of high quality music and relaxed entertainment. Overriding all else, however, is the brilliance of his talent.” (Cornish Guardian)\n\n“Though he's shown over the years that he can keep pace with the Tony Rices and Dan Crarys of the world, it is Gambetta's understated elegance as a flatpicker that has set him apart and made him an in-demand partner the worldover.” (Sing Out!)\n\n“…spinning a thick weave that sometimes calls to mind what a duet by Doc Watson and Leo Kottke might sound like.“ (Mike Joyce, The Washington Post)\n\n“In the end Gambetta’s originals offer some of the most intriguing listening for their amazing virtuosity, pleasing tunefulness, and beyond-category pedigree. He’s truly a man of the world.“ (Roger Levesque, Penguin Eggs)\n\nOpening acts: Kara and the Kosmos, Lost Joe\n\n(+++ ABOUT OUR OPENING ACTS +++)\n\n+++ NO ADVANCE TICKET SALES.

Their music is well-steeped in Americana roots, with vocal harmonies that are high, lonesome, and tight. Their picking ranges from lightning-fast to mountain mellow. They are a bluegrass band that would satisfy a picky old-timer and delight fans of newgrass, a delicate balance indeed.\n\nIn the summer of 2006, Alex Thoele and Jon Pickett met while playing guitars around a campfire, high on a mountaintop in Estes Park, CO. The two have been entertaining and writing music ever since. In 2010, they were joined by mandolin player and fellow midwesterner Jarett Mason. The newest addition to the band as of December 2018 is Chris “C-Bob” Elliot on banjo and vocals.\n\nThey've become known for winning over crowds with creative, fun original songs that flow from the mountains, through them and right back to you. Pure Mountain Music! It's obvious these guys love what they do, engaging their growing fan base with energy and stage antics that guarantee one hell of a night out.\n\nThe band’s highly anticipated new album Backroads went public May 11, 2019. The album Where I want To Be was released October, 2016. In 2015 a live album Chain Up Volume 1 had a limited release, and their debut studio album Dancin’ With the Law hit the scene in 2013. They have directly supported bands such as The Del McCoury Band, The Travelin’ McCourys, The Devil Makes Three, Todd Snider, Sierra Hull, Frank Solivan & Dirty Kitchen, Fruition, Trout Steak Revival, The Railsplitters, Lil’ Smokies, Hot Buttered Rum, Deadphish Orchestra and many more.\n\nChain Station has been living life through music and adventures together for eight years. Relentless gigging in and around their home state of Colorado, the midwest, and Canada has made this band of brothers one of the tightest, most professional ragtag pack of muppets on the scene today.\n\nOpening acts: Scott Cadenasso, Collapsing Stars\n\n(+++ ABOUT OUR OPENING ACTS +++)\n\n+++ NO ADVANCE TICKET SALES.

He does it so well that some great songwriters have recorded his songs on their own albums. Guy Clark, Nanci Griffith, and Janis Ian, to name just a few. You might’ve heard his song “The Kid” (recorded by David Wilcox; Peter, Paul and Mary; and Cry, Cry, Cry) and maybe even sung it yourself around a campfire. He draws you into his world - where a single snowflake follows the trajectory of a relationship, where you get your pocket picked by a Roman cat, where you might swim over the edge of the world if you’re not careful, and where dreams that don’t come true still count.\n\nHis latest album, Filament, finds him exploring some new territory, both sonically and rhythmically. Songs like “Problem Solved” and “Sunlight In My Pocket” are propelled along by drums and percussion. Others are painted with woodwinds and string arrangements. Buddy is at heart a storyteller and the songs cover a lot of territory, ranging from a young artist who finds fame too soon in the title song, to the wonders and mysteries found in “The Dark,” a song he co-wrote with the great Guy Clark.\n\nWhen Buddy’s not on the road you can find him in Nashville, but he grew up in Park Forest, Illinois, a suburb of Chicago. After college he moved to the city, playing open mics at Chicago’s famed Earl of Old Town, where he once opened for the amazing Steve Goodman. Buddy was 21. Says he could have walked out of there that night and gotten hit by a bus and he wouldn’t have felt like life cheated him at all.\n\nWhen Buddy made his first trip to Texas from his native Chicago, Guy Clark heard him singing one of his songs under a tree at the Kerrville Folk Festival and liked it. So Guy went back to Nashville, opened the door and said, “listen to this kid, he’s good!” A publishing deal and a U-Haul headed south soon followed.\n\nPeople were starting to pay attention. In 1987 he was a New Folk Award Winner at Kerrville and he released his first album, On the Line. Over the next few years David Wilcox recorded “The Kid” on his first record for A&M. Buddy did some writing with this other new kid in town named Garth Brooks. Janis Ian heard him singing at the Bluebird Cafe and asked him if he’d like to write with her. Their song “Amsterdam” got recorded by Joan Baez. Nanci Griffith asked Buddy to sing on a show she was taping for Irish television. She ended up liking that song so much that she recorded “Comin’ Down In the Rain” on her Grammy Award winning collection Other Voices, Other Rooms. Once Garth became a star, “Every Now and Then” ended up on his album The Chase.\n\nBuddy has toured all over the U.S. and Europe. Buddy’s second album got picked up by Son Records, a small label in Ireland started by the band U2, and he’s toured there consistently ever since. In 1996 Peter, Paul and Mary recorded “The Kid,” and then asked the kid himself to sing with them on their “Great Performances” TV special. He won a Kerrville Music Award for Song of the Year with “The Kid” that year as well.\n\nSince then he’s released a string of critically acclaimed solo recordings on his own label and on EMI. In 2003 Buddy toured North America and Europe with Art Garfunkel and Maia Sharp in support of their album Everything Waits To Be Noticed. Filament will be his seventh album. In recent years Buddy has been writing songs with military veterans through a program sponsored by an organization called Music Therapy of the Rockies, and he includes several of those songs in his shows (and one on his new album). “This has been such a powerful experience and I’m honored to have been trusted with these stories of trauma and of triumph too,” he says.\n\nIn addition to writing and touring Buddy also teaches songwriting. Along with one-day workshops across the US and Europe, he has also been a staff instructor at the Swannanoa Gathering, the Kerrville Folk Festival Song School, the Sisters Folk Festival Song Camp, and retreats like Ellis Paul’s New England Songwriter Retreat and Cedarsongs in Tennessee.\n\nOpening acts: David Boye, Mark Gillick\n\n(+++ ABOUT OUR OPENING ACTS +++)\n\n+++ NO ADVANCE TICKET SALES.

Since then The Wildwoods have released two full-length records, Across A Midwest Sky (2019) and Foxfield Saint John (2023), as well as a handful of singles, “Little Home” (2020) and “Like My Old Man” (2021), and have supported touring acts such as Elephant Revival, Arts Fishing Club, The Accidentals, The Way Down Wanderers, and Jamie Wyatt.\n\nAlong with performing several Sofar concerts in cities such as London, Brooklyn, and St. Louis, as well as a European tour in 2019, the group has performed at several festivals including: Summerfest, The Nebraska Folk and Roots Festival, Wakarusa, and the Flatwater Music Festival.\n\nIn 2016, 2017, 2018, 2021, and 2022 The Wildwoods were nominated by the Omaha Arts and Entertainment Awards as a top Americana/Folk artist in Nebraska, and in 2022 they were named “Best Band” by the Lincoln Journal Star’s Lincoln’s Choice Awards. The group’s musical momentum continues into 2023 by placing as a top 3 finalist (out of more than 1,000 submissions from around the world) in the Gems in The Rough contest, hosted by popular YouTube channel GemsOnVHS. The band’s most recent release, Foxfield St. John (February 2023), has cultivated a sophisticated and captivating sound to their well crafted songs and musicianship.\n\nComprised of husband and wife team Noah (guitar) and Chloe Gose (violin), as well as Andrew Vaggalis (bass), The Wildwoods draw inspiration from a wide range of influences including Watchhouse, The Decemberists, Gillian Welch & David Rawlings, Nickel Creek, Joni Mitchell, Gregory Alan Isakov, and Peter, Paul, & Mary. The folk/Americana trio work to harmoniously and delicately blend their voices to create a sound so nostalgic that you may find yourself dreaming and longing for those sweet memories from your former days.\n\nWhat People Are Saying\n\n“I appreciate the mixed elements of this track that make it feel both old-fashioned and brand new. The vocals steal the show on this one, certainly. The organic feeling of the way the vocals connect really makes the track stand out. Call it what you will, this is a meaningful, beautiful, and powerful track. It rolls the classics into a succinct and modern sound.”\n\n— Greg Jones - Ear to the Ground Music\n\nOpening acts: Brittany Jean, Ben Guihan\n\n(+++ ABOUT OUR OPENING ACTS +++)\n\n+++ NO ADVANCE TICKET SALES.

Their distinct sound is rooted in and inspired by their connection to the land on which they reside. The band features multi-instrumentalists and songwriters Alex Paul (guitar, upright bass, mandolin and vocals), Eric Shedd (upright Bass, mandolin, guitar and vocals), Anneke Dean (violin, guitar, and vocals), and Jack Tolan (guitar, mandolin, electric bass and vocals).\n\nTheir arrangements and compositions are a reflection of their vast and teaming pools of inspiration from artists such as Wood Brothers, Punch Brothers, and Andrew Bird. Birds of Play’s high-caliber musicianship and songcraft are laced with imagination and a vibrant, intuitive understanding of the human condition - while their live shows weave together an intricate tapestry of place, authenticity, magic, and humor.\n\nFour years into this journey, Birds of Play are venturing further out of the nest to create community and bring people together to share in universal themes of love, connection, and wonder. With an uplifting and joyous exuberance - and a fourth studio album on the horizon for release this summer - these four dear friends are riding the thermals of their creativity to ever-greater heights.\n\nOpening acts: Mike Holweger, Michelle Mandico\n\n(+++ ABOUT OUR OPENING ACTS +++)\n\n+++ NO ADVANCE TICKET SALES.

Although they are considered folksy and fall within the Americana genre, their musical arrangements are very innovative and eclectic.\n\nThrough a chance encounter in Nashville back in 2006, Benjamin and Kassie Wilson were sure of each other from the start. “Kassie knew she was going to marry me from the first time she saw me…and she was right,” Ben gloats. Formerly known as “My One and Only,” the duo has reimagined their “southern-soul,” “curious-grit” and emotionally honest lyrics into Goldpine. “Throughout those years we realized that the name was putting out a certain vibe, of the depth of the music, that was not quite accurate with where our style was heading.” Drawing inspiration from their roots, the name Goldpine signifies their past and their future: Kassie grew up on Pines Road in Alabama, so ‘pine’ represents the past and ‘gold’ is the lasting and valuable element that represents the future.\n\nAfter nearly a decade of honing in on their sound, they gave the world their self-produced debut LP, One. Veterans of making music, Ben and Kassie put their hearts and souls into this album. With this fresh start, Goldpine wasted no time showing what they stood for. Their lead single, “Wander Away,” is somewhat of a public service announcement about mental health; while the sophomore single, “When I Get to Heaven,” takes you on a musical roller coaster ride. Laced with bold vocal harmonies and fervent lyrics, One, is the perfect introduction to Goldpine.\n\nTouring since 2016, they have been lessening the gap between music and the audience by disclosing their stories behind the lyrics at every venue along the way. From festivals like 30A Songwriting Festival and Bristol Rhythm & Roots Reunion, to listening rooms throughout the United States, Ben and Kassie have been offering their own brand of raw Americana to audiences large and small. Recent winners of the 2022 Rocky Mountain Songwriter Contest at the Red Lodge Songwriter Festival, and finalists in the Kerrville Folk Fest 2021 New Folk Competition, the duo's bold harmonies are clearly a channel for their highly charged songwriting. Presented the “Discovery Award” in 2018 by acclaimed music critic Robert K. Oermann (Music Row Magazine), Ben and Kassie declared performance as their love-share to the world, and since then, have maintained the love and commitment they put into their shows.\n\n“I love these guys...their never-ending onslaught of bold harmony is undeniable.” Andrija Tokic (Alabama Shakes), Grammy Award-nominated producer.\n\n“…a melding of raw acoustic music with meaningful lyrics that paint a picture of their and our journey.” -Eric Dahl, host of Fox 17 Rock & Review Radio & TV.\n\nNO ADVANCE TICKET SALES.

It was recorded at Nashville’s legendary Sound Emporium studios over the course of a week in December 2021.\n\nFormed in Minneapolis in 2018, the group has spent the last five years making a name for itself across the country. It’s played historic venues like Minneapolis’ Cedar Cultural Center and NYC’s Rockwood Music Hall, sharing the stage with artists like Charlie Parr and Emilia Amper. Sprig has had collaborations with organizations like Carnegie Hall and Minnesota Public Radio giving workshops at schools across the country. In 2021, they released Eight Threads, a cross- genre collaboration comprising 8 compositions written for the trio by eight very different Twin Cities-based music makers.\n\nOpening acts: Kevin Mastin, Tim Meegan\n\n(+++ ABOUT OUR OPENING ACTS +++)\n\n+++ NO ADVANCE TICKET SALES.

Undlin twines experimental folk, environmental Americana, and orchestral compositions to forge an explorative embodiment of the narrative folk song and balladry tradition. Released in September 2019, her debut full length album, Pharmakon, engineered by Brian Joseph (Bon Iver, Sufjan Stevens) and produced by Shane Leonard (Field Report), has been received with remarkable critical acclaim and has amassed nearly 20 million streams since its release. Folk Alley listed “Pharmakon” as one of their favorite songs of 2019 and at the end of week one, the album ranked #19 on the top NACC music charts and by week two was at #1 on the Folk charts - one of only two self-released albums to chart. Most recently she won the 2021 Kerrville Folk Festival’s song-writing competition was able to perform a set at the 49th annual festival this fall. Humbird is currently touring her third studio album, Still Life - released in 2021. Keep your eye out for the next release due in 2023!\n\nA Humbird live performance is intimate and earthy, literal and metaphorical. The band nimbly prances around the lilt of Undlin’s unfaltering fervent and haunting voice - the focal point. Although the songs and stories hold their own, the embellishments the band supply add the perfect splash of timbre and color to deliver a dynamic and engaging performance.\n\nOpening acts: KatMo, Patty Clayton\n\n(+++ ABOUT OUR OPENING ACTS +++)\n\n+++ NO ADVANCE TICKET SALES.
