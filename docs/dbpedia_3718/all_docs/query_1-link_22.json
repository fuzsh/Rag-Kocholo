        "text": "Music is a deeply personal art form. Whether through melodies or lyrics, musicians reach into the depths of their souls to touch peoples’ hearts in ways unique to each individual listener. However, artists don’t always fully create the music they release. Sometimes, musicians co-write their music with other people, produce songs for other musicians, or even employ a technique called sampling, where they take a part of an existing song, such as the lyrics or a production element, and use it in a new composition. This reliance on outside sources to create a piece of music, especially sampling, brings forth questions about the level of skill and musical talent that goes into music. Is the level of artistry that music demonstrates a direct reflection of the artist that makes the original piece of music? Or are those who appropriate existing pieces of music to prove their musical skill and synthesization abilities engaging in a process that is just as artistically meaningful as creating original music?\n\nPlunderphonics musicians would answer yes to the latter. Plunderphonics is an electronic genre characterized by its overt use of samples, and it falls under the umbrella of sound collage. While sampling has been a common musical technique for decades, what sets plunderphonics apart from other sample-heavy genres like hip-hop is that it /only/ uses samples. Its liberal approach to sampling set new precedents for how samples could be implemented in music, and it played a pivotal role in forming other sample-based electronic genres, such as vaporwave and hyperpop. Plunderphonics doesn’t use samples from only music; recordings from radio shows, news reports, and other media are also commonly found in tracks that adhere to this genre. Its other main trait that differs from other genres is its blatant disregard for copyright laws — at least when it was first created.\n\nThe origins of plunderphonics\n\nThe first time “plunderphonics” came into use was when electronic composer John Oswald coined the term in his 1985 paper “Plunderphonics, or Audio Piracy as a Compositional Prerogative.” Oswald saw the growing amount of music technology, such as the sampler machine, that became available to the general public as an indication that the atmosphere surrounding music creation and reproduction had to change. Before 1976, copyright laws protected written music and not recordings, so when the sampler machine was invented, musicians were able to document existing music to use in new compositions without legal repercussions. As copyright laws caught up with this innovation, Oswald questioned if music should fall under copyright at all. He argued that for years, musicians had utilized instruments they did not invent and took inspiration from music that they did not write, so this novel technique of sampling existing music should not be treated any differently. According to Oswald, “All popular music (and all folk music, by definition), essentially, if not legally, exists in public domain” due to how omnipresent it is in popular culture. So, why should musicians be banned from using it? Surely, the ability to freely pick and choose from other musicians’ work with no consequence would increase the meaningful creative output in the realm of music.\n\nOswald definitely thought so, and he composed and released a sizable amount of music that fits into what became known as the genre of plunderphonics. His approach to plunderphonics was quite different from how many musicians approach it now. He deliberately sampled songs that were made by popular artists, and his manipulation of the samples was much more overt. For example, his song “dab” splices apart “Bad” by Michael Jackson into a confusing cacophony of syllables and repetition that exaggerates Jackson’s vocal quirks. He sped up, slowed down, and reversed snippets of the original vocalizations to create a disorienting effect. Contrastingly, his song “pretender” samples “The Great Pretender” by Dolly Parton but doesn’t rearrange the original track — instead, he progressively slows it down until it seemingly becomes a mockery of Parton’s voice itself.\n\nUltimately, Oswald decided to distribute his plunderphonics music for free, since he knew that he would immediately be flagged for copyright infringement if he tried to sell his music. He worked with a musical group called Negativland to release many of his plunderphonics tracks in a compilation called “plunderphonics 69/96” on their label Seeland Records in 2001. Oswald is not credited as the musicians on these songs; instead, he chose to display the artists’ names as anagrams of the original artists. By making this choice, he is subtly giving credit to the original artists for their music while also highlighting his artistic manipulation of their original works.\n\nThe development of plunderphonics\n\nContemporary musicians who make plunderphonics are more willing to obtain the legal rights to the music they sample, but some still intentionally release music with unauthorized samples. Many modern plunderphonics tracks are also more cohesive than the tracks John Oswald released — instead of focusing on rearranging different individual songs as independent explorations, some contemporary plunderphonics artists use samples to create new, inventive tracks that are contextually removed from their source materials. These musicians establish their own sound and artistic identity despite using samples from existing music. The samples used in these albums also are rearranged in more sonically complex ways than their predecessors, with some albums consisting of hundreds of samples. Due to this different ways of incorporating samples, the samples also sound less obvious in the context of the songs. Two plunderphonics albums played a pivotal role in the popularity and definition of the genre today.\n\n/Since I Left You/\n\n/Since I Left You/ by The Avalanches, released in 2000, transports listeners to a glitzy, fun tropical theme park full of melodies and ad-libs that seamlessly fade in and out from each other. The Australian electronic duo supposedly used over 3,500 samples in the making of this album, which seems plausible to even the most skeptical listener once they tune in to the album’s complexity. The title track draws the listener into this sonic celebration, with interconnected rhythms, melodies, and small snippets of voices inviting them to paradise before the main sample of vocals from the song “Everyday” by The Main Attraction warbles in. Never losing momentum, the album dances on through its tracklist, from the twirling tune and crooning of “Two Hearts in ¾ Time” to the funky and percussive “Close To You.” The party keeps going during “A Different Feeling,” but there’s a moment where a female voice quivering the lyrics “Tammy’s in love” transitions into a melancholic string refrain that creates a moment of indescribable awe and emotion. There are many small musical marvels like this interspersed throughout the album. The sheer amount of samples /Since I Left You/ utilizes while managing to stay cohesive is truly an impressive feat. /Since I Left You/ is one of the most notable examples of a plunderphonics album using samples to tell a story rather than exaggerate an original track, and it helped move the genre towards the synthesization of samples to create an entirely new piece of music.\n\n/Endtroducing…../\n\nDJ Shadow’s 1996 album /Endtroducing…../ shares many similarities to /Since I Left You/, but it uses samples in a bit of a different way. Like /Since I Left You/, /Endtroducing…../ is a debut album, and both musicians used a sampler machine to record samples from vinyl. However, compared to /Since I Left You/, this album is much lower energy, and its roots are in instrumental hip-hop rather than upbeat electronic music. One of /Endtroducing…../’s most notable features is its precise use of complex drumset rhythms on songs like “Stem / Long Stem - Medley” and “Mutual Slump,” especially since the instruments in question are sampled rather than played specifically for this album. This complex manipulation of preexisting music is a difficult technique to pull off effectively, and it demonstrates how advanced aural skills and knowledge of music technology is necessary when creating sample-based music, especially when it is as intricate as this album is. The samples also aren’t as transient or layered as heavily as the ones used on /Since I Left You/, so the listener is inclined to appreciate the individual samples’ beauty and how they compliment each other instead of rushing to process quickly moving parts. /Endtroducing…../ is a different take on the plunderphonics genre, and it is an example of a musician using plunderphonics to create music within a specific subgenre. DJ Shadow also popularized the concept of maneuvering each individual sample into something new before combining them with other samples, which is a technique seen in both plunderphonics and general sampling today.\n\nPlunderphonics today\n\nPlunderphonics never became a popular genre of music, but there are still some newer examples that utilize the technique of using samples to create a musically unique composition. /Feed The Animals/ is an album released by Girl Talk in 2008, and it uses eclectic samples from a multitude of genres to create a sound reminiscent of mashups. Girl Talk is more similar to John Oswald in his tendency to revel in the recognizability of his samples instead of obscuring them. Oneohtrix Point Never’s 2011 album /Replica/ is also considered plunderphonics, and creates a soundscape out of ambient samples taken from television advertisements in the 1980s and 1990s. More recently, /FOAR EVERYWUN FRUM MIMI/, released in 2020 by MIMIDEATH, draws on sonic trends established in hyperpop and nightcore by speeding up samples of complete songs and adding sampled breakcore instrumentals over them, which creates a sense of sensory overload. All of these newer examples of plunderphonics are quite different from one another, but they all use the technique of flipping samples from existing media into something fresh and reflective of the musician’s distinct sonic style.\n\nThe artistic value of music\n\nThese diverse examples of plunderphonics music show that artistic value can be found in music that is completely made of fragments of already existing media. Arrangement is vital to creating a meaningful piece of music, and plunderphonics musicians reinvent what “arrangement” even means since none of the sounds they use are originally theirs. While much of John Oswald’s work did come off as silly, he found musical quirks that certain musicians had and amplified them through his musical rearrangements while simultaneously paving a new path for how artists interpret music . This process of recognizing a pattern and highlighting it takes observation skills and creativity. The Avalanches and DJ Shadow elaborated on plunderphonics’ potential as an artistic outlet by establishing more complex ways to make music solely out of samples. These musicians prioritized composition over preserving the original pieces of music, and this mindset allowed them to find and convey their own distinctive musical style. Especially in these more contemporary plunderphonics albums, the plundered sounds the musicians use cease to matter. It’s what those sounds are made into that creates a work of art.\n\nWhile electronic music had been around for a while by the 1970s, no act was quite as formative in its evolution as Yellow Magic Orchestra. Also known as YMO, the underappreciated trio of bassist/keyboardist/vocalist Haruomi Hosono, drummer/lead vocalist Yukihiro Takahashi, and keyboardist/vocalist Ryuichi Sakamoto was foundational in the development of techno and hip-hop, and practically invented synthpop. Their relevance is as overt as having been remixed and sampled by the likes of Michael Jackson, Mariah Carey, and Jennifer Lopez, but their ingenuity in electronic music has shaped figures from Duran Duran to David Byrne to Arca.\n\nWhile becoming household names in Japan, YMO was simultaneously the first Japanese group to find success overseas. They defied caricatures of Japanese music –– a sound that had become increasingly imitative of Western styles by the 1970s –– by defining a particularly Japanese voice of electronic innovation that ended up transcending its borders. Perhaps in another zeitgeist their trailblazing innovation would have made them a quintessential boy band, but comprehensively influencing music as we know it and ushering in “the age of the computer programmer as rock star” makes them as significant. Even if eventually collapsing under internal strife and the weight of the trio’s burgeoning solo careers, YMO’s brief but lush discography is one of cutting-edge singularity.\n\nYellow Magic Orchestra (1978)\n\nWith the opening seconds of “コンピューター・ゲーム \"サーカスのテーマ\" (Computer Game \"Theme From the Circus\"),” the monumental force of YMO as a fully-fledged band was unleashed upon the world. Its glitchy electronic notes swarm and gush, repeating over slide whistle-esque tones and beats that would belong everywhere from a Pokémon soundtrack to a Kraftwerk record — eventually inspiring both. /Yellow Magic Orchestra/, and the band as a unit, was formed as a satire of Western Orientalism towards Japan that’s evident in these reinterpreted stereotypical trills of “Computer Game” and throughout the record. YMO encases their own culture in a glittery resin and ships it back across the world — the ephemeral kitsch of “中国女 (La Femme Chinoise)” is an infectious pop tune, but one with a political tilt only three nerdy programmers could pull off so pointedly: “She is the mistress / the scent of the orient.”\n\nNowhere is this pointed critique of Orientalism as evident as in their debut single and the album’s most significant track, “ファイアー・クラッカー (Fire Cracker).” A cover of Martin Denny’s 1959 exotica song “Firecracker,” the trio reinterpret racist notions of Japaneseness through invented electronic sounds. By combining equipment like the Roland MC-8 microcomposer — the earliest popular music album to do so — and Yamaha drums with synthesizers, YMO concocted some of the first synthpop textures. The result is a melange of production decades ahead of its time and themes deeply rooted in 1978 Japan. “Fire Cracker” itself even charted on the /Billboard/ R&B chart (even from their first release, YMO’s influence extended far beyond what was apparent — their recordings were foundational for hip-hop, being sampled everywhere in the Bronx following the album’s release), while moments like “東 風 (Tong Poo)”’s disco bass has had a far-flung influence on video game music and sound as if they were released yesterday. /Yellow Magic Orchestra/ was timeless in 1978 –– and will be timeless for decades to come.\n\nRecommended Tracks: “ファイアー・クラッカー (Fire Cracker),” “東 風 (Tong Poo),” “マッド・ピエロ (Mad Pierrot)”\n\nSolid State Survivor (1979)\n\nWith /Solid State Survivor/, YMO solidified themselves as electronica provocateurs and as some of the most innovative musicians around. Their most commercially successful album, /Solid State Survivor/ is widely regarded as their best work for being future-forward in its unapologetic synthpop. It was much like their debut, albeit with the confidence of now-nationally famous superstars –– by 1979, YMO was the biggest band in Japan, often compared to the Beatles as teenage heartthrobs and critical darlings (literally embodying them, YMO covers “Day Tripper” here). The utopian synthpop anthem “Behind the Mask” saw the trio directly influence the international music canon too, with its later Michael Jackson cover validating the group as worthy of mainstream attention.\n\nMuch like /Yellow Magic Orchestra/, /Solid State Survivor/ was a prideful statement of Japanese culture. By the late 1970s, Japan’s international mystique was reduced to a cyper-futurist enterprise of innovative technology, intertwining it with the Western exoticism YMO satirized in their debut. Here, they revel in their nation’s microchip manufacturing prowess, emblazoning the solid state drive as their sophomore record’s title while remaining on the cutting edge of the technology Japan was frequently reduced to. By incorporating devices like Pollard Syndrum electronic drums and the Moog III-C, YMO grandfathered techno and was the first to use the term in the intro track “Technopolis.” With glittering synths and towering chords flooding its tracklist –– all meticulously arranged and composed from their roomful of the newest tech –– /Solid State Survivor/ stands as a bastion of the limitless creativity of the new age of computers.\n\nRecommended Tracks: “Rydeen,” “Technopolis,” “Behind the Mask,” “Solid State Survivor”\n\n×∞ Multiplies (1980)\n\n/×∞ Multiplies/ stands out in YMO’s discography through its sheer outlandishness. The mini-album/EP was even more politically engaged than their previous work, interspersing five comedy sketches performed by the Snakeman Show throughout the record. The sketches mock Western racism towards Japanese people, impersonating business interactions between bigoted Westerners and caricatures of Japanese businessmen. YMO’s righteous anger is personified, particularly following an international tour where they constantly faced anti-Asian racism and xenophobia. Much like their music itself, /×∞ Multiplies/’s parody is deeply academic and designed to be extremely uncomfortable.\n\n/×∞ Multiplies/’s music continued to show YMO’s innovative fervor. They investigate electronic ska in “Multiplies” and feature grooves now-recognizable as funky house in “Tighten Up,” incorporating each through a distinct new wave sound. The EP is bizarre in its content and composition, but through this strangeness YMO remained a singular force in electronic innovation. Their nuance in pulling off two separate interpretations of Archie Bell & The Drells’ “Tighten Up,” where they demonstrate their technical knowledge but intentionally perform everything “incorrectly,” as if to caricaturize the Western perception of Japanese ineptitude, takes cultural savvy. /×∞ Multiplies/ may not be the most straightforward or even pleasant listen, but it’s a feat of intertwining art and commentary, all while proving YMO’s unparalleled creativity.\n\nRecommended Tracks: “Tighten Up (Japanese Gentlemen Stand Up Please!),” “Multiplies”\n\nBGM (1981)\n\nIt’s with /BGM/, YMO’s third official album, that their joy of electronica became fully realized. Unlike the pessimism of Detroit and bleakness of the Düsseldorf scenes, YMO revels in whimsy and fun, crafting computer textures as a weaver’s hands glide over a loom. The title /BGM/ reflects the humor so integral to their ideology and music — its initial for “background music” is a paradox for the noisiness and activity that consumes the record.\n\nLike their previous releases, /BGM/ explores the possibilities of the most advanced and complex computing available at the time — although now enabled with a post-/Solid State Survivor/ success budget. With an equipment budget of ¥51,250,000, or over $700,000 today, YMO explored the minutiae and complexity of software in ways still trailblazing today, particularly as the first group to record with the Roland TR-808 Rhythm Composer after its release that same year, popularizing its now ubiquity. Their full list of gear was affectionately grocery-listed on the back of the LP — functionally a customs declaration for touring, but artistically a love letter to the machines that make their music. “Tools are not just objects,” according to Sakamoto; their synthesizers and computers were animated in a sense of interrelated beings, part of the YMO organism.\n\nIt’s this affection that makes /BGM/ so iridescent. While not as critically or commercially successful as /Solid State Survivor/, the record’s impact on music and independent sonic merit are remarkable. From the novel drum programming in “ユーティー (U•T),” to pioneering synthwave in “マス (Mass),” to early electronic rap experimentation in “ラップ現象 (Rap Phenomena),” /BGM/ casts a long shadow on the industry, past and present. Even the two minute-long opening note of ambient closer “来たるべきもの (Loom)” preceded the iconic THX “Deep Note” — it’s as if the trio was checking off a list of art forms to progenerate.\n\nRecommended Tracks: “キュー (Cue),” “千のナイフ (1000 Knives),” “来たるべきもの (Loom)”\n\nTechnodelic (1981)\n\n/Technodelic/, coming a mere 9 months after /BGM/, was an even deeper venture into the bizarre for YMO. The record’s foundation was laid by a new, and even more exclusive, machine — a LMD-649 digital sampler custom built for the group by a Toshiba engineer. Endless pioneers, /Technodelic/ was the first released album to primarily feature samples and loops, a technique that has spawned countless genres from plunderphonics to hyperpop and is now a fundamental part of the entire industry.\n\nTheir joy of creating is less evident sonically here, but still omnipresent with the richness and complexity of their process of making. The trio’s ethos of machines as co-authors is what lead to such a bizarre record; the fusion of samples with vocals through a two-way radio, Prophet-5 synthesizers, and their favorite Roland TR-808 leads to even more unconventional sounds than previously imagined. Gamelan, factory noises, and Indonesian kecak chanting, employed with completely novel techniques, are employed with an intentionality that makes /Technodelic/ so singular. As YMO matured, the record also marked a turning point and the end of a remarkable 5-album run.\n\nRecommended Tracks: “新舞踊 (Neue Tanz),” “灯 (Light in Darkness),” “後奏 (Epilogue)”\n\nNaughty Boys (1983)\n\nBy 1983, tensions within YMO were high. Hosono and Sakamoto practically hated each other, and Takahashi had to serve as a mediator at all points in the creative and professional process. Whether as a result of /Naughty Boys/ coming after a year break for the trio to explore their solo careers — during which Sakamoto starred in and composed the score for “Merry Christmas, Mr. Lawrence,” winning him a BAFTA Award — or due to growing creative differences, YMO only stayed together at the begging of their record label, Alfa.\n\nAnd Alfa’s begging paid off. /Naughty Boys/ topped the Oricon charts (Japan’s /Billboard/), the last time for the group, and became a sensation within Japan. Their experimental musings are largely gone, replaced with unabashed pop music that, according to Sakamoto, was essentially following the “music industry manual.” /Naughty Boys/ was YMO selling out to the masses of sorts, but not selling out their artistry. While not at the vanguard of electronic music quite like /BGM/ or /Technodelic/, /Naughty Boys/ perfected pop with the immaculate intricacy present in all of their work. The gleeful vocal melodies and glitzy synths of lead single “君に、胸キュン。浮気なヴァカンス (Kimi ni Mune Kyun)” are less innovative than they are comfortable, but still demonstrate the trademark wackiness and technical expertise of YMO. Their Japaneseness is more legible here, too, with the majority of the tracks being sung in Japanese and largely transcending their earlier critical framework of exotica from the Oriental perspective. Instead, /Naughty Boys/ is unapologetically Japanese, expanding what J-pop could be.\n\nRecommended Tracks: “君に、胸キュン。浮気なヴァカンス (Kimi ni Mune Kyun),” “Focus,” “邂逅 (Kai-Koh)”\n\nService (1983)\n\nIn /Service/, however, tensions were manifest. Coming less than seven months after /Naughty Boys/, the record was more of an obligation after its predecessor’s commercial success than an intentional project. YMO wanted to end their career as a group after /Naughty Boys/, and the success of their solo careers was enough to justify disbanding.\n\nMuch like /×∞ Multiplies/, /Service/ incorporates comedy sketches, this time performed by Super Eccentric Theater, or S.E.T., although with a much heavier hand. The seven sketches, doubling the album’s length, are less pointed than in /×∞ Multiplies/ and function to make the overall listen clunky instead of a critical perspective. The music itself is still well-produced and technologically advanced synthpop à la many YMO classics, but it’s evident that their hearts weren’t quite in it anymore. Other than the sublime “Perspective” embodying postmodern defeatism (“In the gleam of a brilliant twilight / I see people torn apart from each other”) and to a lesser extent the new wave funk of “以心電信 (You’ve Got to Help Yourself),” /Service/ fades away in the scope of their more progressive work. After a world tour, /Service/ marked the end of Yellow Magic Orchestra as a full-time group.\n\nRecommended tracks: “以心電信 (You’ve Got to Help Yourself),” “Perspective”\n\nTechnodon (1993)\n\nAs a one-off reunion album, released under the name YMO as Yellow Magic Orchestra was owned by their former label Alfa, /Technodon/ has been largely written out of the band’s history. It’s easy to understand why — the record’s ambient techno and IDM leanings are a far cry from the technopop fantasies of their most prolific work. But considering the breakneck pace they innovated in their short seven years as an official band, it’s no wonder that their work ten years later is radically different.\n\nYMO are more interested in exploring the minutiae of sound than eclectic electronic compositions on /Technodon/. Synths warble with anatomical accuracy on “Hi-Tech Hippies”; haunting tones crescendo and crash in “Nostalgia”; otherworldly pockets of samples and vocals fight for space on “Waterford.” Their interests in world music are present throughout their percussion and yields a record more focused on texture than melody.\n\nBut by 1993, /Technodon/ was a small moment in the ever-evolving careers of YMO’s members. During their hiatus and since, Sakamoto became an internationally-renowned and Grammy-winning film scorer and continued releasing music on the forefront `of electronic and ambient; Hosorno transcended into the canon of Japanese solo acts through his countless albums; and Takahashi continued collaborating with other artists as one of the most influential drummers in Japan. To a conscientious listener, practically all electronic, ambient, and hip-hop music has remnants of Yellow Magic Orchestra — few contemporary releases haven’t been touched by these three nerdy programmers on the vanguard of music.\n\nRecommended tracks: “Nanga Def?” “Hi-Tech Hippies,” “Nostalgia”\n\nJust several years ago, if you put “rap,” “cloud,” and “internet” in a Google search, you’d get an assortment of hits about the new wave of hip-hop hitting the airwaves. Artists like Trippie Redd and Lil Peep, as well as a whole host of up-and-coming rappers, were trying to break through to the mainstream with their lo-fi, often hit-or-miss songs. But venture back a few years more, and you’d upgrade from dial-up to fiber optic: the nascent genre of cloud rap was all the rage, and it would embrace the internet in its visual and sonic aesthetic like no hip-hop subgenre ever had, and ever would again. Upon viewing a picture of a castle floating in the cloud, rapper Lil B infamously declared “That’s the kind of music I want to make.” It’s an apt description for the genre’s sound, characterized almost entirely by its production: hazy, ethereal, and dreamy, often looping or flipping samples or beats to amplify the singers’ trance-like voices. Where cloud rap’s real essence lies, however, is in its digital footprint; traces of sound and style scattered throughout the internet.\n\nIn many ways, cloud rap’s production and sound embodies the endless yet interconnected and layered nature of the internet. Look no further than legendary producer Clams Casino's discography for a definition of the relaxed and airy style. Cloud rap’s equivalent of a foundational text, the 2009 Clams-produced “I’m God” is an instrumental assisted by vocals from British singer Imogen Heap and is widely considered to be one of the most influential beats of modern rap. “I’m God” exemplifies the very best of the genre; deliberately editing and processing vocals, layered upon themselves to create a druggy, slow, and dreamlike effect without overwhelming the listener. The instrumental has been rapped on by virtually every major cloud rap artist of the 2010s, as well as more unexpected artists like Soulja Boy — evidence of the beat’s transcendence beyond its niche genre. The influence and impact of this innovative production style was immediate; within a few years, Clams Casino and similar producers were making beats for countless stars from Mac Miller to FKA Twigs to The Weeknd. The aesthetic is similarly maintained visually; the album covers of cloud rap stars like A$AP Rocky’s /LONG.LIVE.A$AP/ and Yung Lean’s /Warlord/ embody the slightly druggy, digitally enhanced “looking-through-a-screen” effect that was synonymous with the subgenre’s sound.\n\nAs cloud rap’s status rose, so did its interconnectedness with social media, and its most prolific stars used it to reach otherwise unreachable audiences. This predicated the massive role that social media plays in modern music promotion campaigns — cloud rappers did it first. No artist demonstrated how to use the internet for growth and exposure than Lil B, a cloud rapper who leaned into meme culture and ironic raps to promote his work. For instance, his MySpace usage was credited with keeping the platform afloat long past its prime — in 2010, he uploaded nearly 700 songs exclusively to the site, years after peak usage rates. In a less positive vein, Lil B would often use social media to incite feuds with his peers, trading heated yet comical blows with artists like Joey Badass, Soulja Boy, and others to the enjoyment of his online fanbase. Though more often fabricated for laughs and publicity than legitimate, Lil B’s online scraps are significant because he was one of the first to spotlight what would happen when mainstream artists discovered social media: anyone could use it as a tool for promotion, regardless of major label backing or financial limitations.\n\nWhen the music industry began its transition into the 2020s, cloud rap had already pioneered the transition to online music marketing that came with it. Cloud rap artists were some of the first to prove how the internet could be used to their advantage. Music collective Drain Gang (which includes Bladee, Ecco2k, Thaiboy Digital, Whitearmor, and Yung Sherman) used their combined influence and online cult following to release music to continued success. Drain Gang used social media to create a focused visual aesthetic and interact with fans, and uploaded music independently to SoundCloud and YouTube, bypassing the need for major distributors. Countless other cloud rap artists released mixtapes to see similar success. For example, A$AP Rocky’s first single, “Peso,” was originally an online leak — typically a death sentence for new releases. But after positive word of mouth spread on blogs and online forums, the song gained popularity and started getting radio play in New York City. Its success let him go on to independently record music videos, release his now-classic mixtape, /LIVE.LOVE.A$AP/, and sign his first record deal. Had the internet not facilitated this virality, Rocky’s career may never have taken off. The lesson was clear: the playing field was leveled when the entire internet was at your fingertips, and anyone with the right savvy could find musical success.\n\nYears have passed since cloud rap peaked in the mainstream, but its impact on music promotion will never die: it has never been easier to be an independent artist. Social media apps like Instagram and TikTok let artists reach massive audiences with the click of a button, while streaming services and playlists mean their tracks are just a quick search away. You no longer require major label support to “get your name out”; independent releases are a more viable option than ever, and massive artists like Kanye West, Frank Ocean, and Megan Thee Stallion operate this way. It’s become evident that cloud rap was at the forefront of the music industry’s digital revolution. No hip-hop genre before had put the capacities of the internet to the test. Not only did cloud rap fully incorporate it into its visual and sonic identity with its dreamy, trancelike soundscapes, but it proved that artists of all backgrounds and styles could use it as a platform to communicate with fans, promote music, and bypass the need for a way into the historically exclusive music industry.\n\nSince its mid-2010 peak, cloud rap has fallen out of its former place in hip-hop, making room for newer styles and subgenres. Regardless, its influence as the harbinger of the digital age of hip-hop remains unarguable. Had cloud rap artists not paved the way, artists may never have realized the untapped potential that the internet had in leveling the playing field. From its style to how it shaped the advancing internet age of music promotion, cloud rap was truly the soundtrack for the digital world’s adolescent years.\n\nIn music, it’s not often that artists and their art are given a second chance for success. It’s an unfortunate truth of the industry that first impressions can be everything. Some artists spend their whole lives creating art that the world may never hear. Though the global nature of the Internet and accessibility of the online streaming world has increased music sharing, there are still millions of unheard songs. On Spotify alone, it was found that around 45.6 million songs had zero streams in 2023. And that’s only on one digital platform; there’s no telling how many unheard songs are hiding throughout the many caverns of the internet. When you add in the myriad of unpublished cassette and CD demos, the amount of lost songs becomes astronomical. By this logic, how is an independent artist ever meant to compete? A song they pour their heart into has a higher likelihood of ending up lost to the sands of time than heard by even one other person. But what happens when a piece of music is given a second chance?\n\nA little over two months ago, an audio began to circulate on TikTok. Normally accompanied by an image of a Y2k pink boombox, the audio is only seventeen seconds long and the sonic quality is poor. Many users noted in the comments that they’d heard the song before but couldn't recall from where. The clip consists of a punchy baseline, a vintage synth, and vocals. While the lyrical content remains up for debate to this day, the song itself hails from the 1980s. Seemingly overnight, a community formed, attempting to find the origin of the audio. But what TikTok wasn’t aware of is that the hunt for this earworm has been in full swing for the last three years.\n\n“I was the second member ever in the sub, after the creator,” said Reddit moderator u/Sodapopyarn. “Many people have joined the search following sombertoboggly's video featuring blameitonjorge about the subject[song].”\n\nThe subreddit r/everyoneknowsthat has amassed around 33,900 users since its creation in July 2023. While the subreddit was officially created less than a year ago, the song, informally titled “Everyone Knows That,” has been in circulation within the lost media community since 2021. The mystery began on a website called “WatZatSong,” when user Carl92 posted the clip.\n\n“I rediscovered this sample between a bunch of very old files in a DVD backup. Probably I was simply learning how to capture audio and this was a leftover,” he posted. He went on to state that the clip was most likely recorded when he was living in Spain, but refused to go into further detail. Then, for seemingly no reason, Carl92 disappeared. WatZatSong was flooded with new users attempting to message Carl. In January of this year, the website became aware of the search and contacted the owner of the account, but haven’t heard back. This is one of the main reasons some lost media enthusiasts believe that the song may be a hoax.\n\nDespite the naysayers, the community continues to grow. Leads have been few and far between, as it’s hypothesized that the song does not exist on the internet. One major lead has come from analyzing the frequencies of the recording. The analysis revealed that the clip contained a signal/noise ratio of 15734 Hz, which is characteristic of analog television broadcasting. This specific frequency is the horizontal scan rate noise of the NTSC broadcast, which is only used in North America. This has narrowed down the search significantly. Participants have taken to contacting major radio and television broadcasters throughout North America in hopes that the song is somewhere in an archive. Due to the horizontal scan rate noise, many suspect that the song was recorded off of a TV and comes from a commercial or television show.\n\nMany have deemed the song a lost cause as the prospect of having to physically search (off the internet) seems impossible. “We live in a world where we think anything is accessible and on the internet. If it doesn’t exist there it doesn’t exist. And that’s just not true,” u/Twinseylohan, another moderator of the subreddit, shared.\n\nIn January 2020, another famous lost music media search came to an end; the mysterious “D>E>A>T>H>M>E>T>A>L” CD by Panchiko that was found in an Oxfam charity shop was finally solved when u/LindyKamek and another search party member found one of the band members on Facebook. Much like “Everyone Knows That,” the album had zero online history. But, they analyzed the barcode on the album cover and found the exact Oxfam location. From there, they were able to search the small UK town for any of the four first names that were listed on the back of the album. Finding an “Owain” in the area, they messaged him, and the mystery was solved.\n\n“It really was an interesting feeling when it was found since so many cases remain unresolved. I suppose we got lucky since there was enough information to get us to the finish line,” said u/LinyKamek, reflecting on their involvement in the search. Since the discovery, Panchiko has gotten back together, released more music, and is currently on tour.\n\nTo some, the concept of lost music may seem insignificant. If a song is “important,” it’d be famous. After all, a song's value lies purely in its message and content, right? “I personally believe that all works deserve to be archived and recognized to give the artist(s) the great credit they deserve…I'd really just like to add how grateful I am to have a community so passionate and determined,” expressed u/Sodapopyarn.\n\n“ I learned all I could and became close with everybody… My role is just to support my fellow mods, ensure sub quality and create community,” u/Twinseyloahn added.\n\nIf you delve more and more into the r/EveryoneKnowsThat subreddit, sentiments similar to these continue to pop up. It’s clear there’s a strong sense of community and trust there. People from all walks of life have been able to bond over their shared interest in finding this song. And is that not the goal of music? To express and connect with others? Musicians make music to be heard. And to be heard is to be respected and cared for. Regardless of if “Everyone Knows That,” is found, or whatever the original intention of the song was, it’s been the mystery surrounding it that has changed people’s lives. Any song that can achieve that deserves a second chance to be heard among the noise.\n\nA journey through the discography of psych-rock trio Spirit of the Beehive (SOTB) feels like falling in and out of sleep while lying on the TV remote. The faint glare of the screen and unintelligible voices flicker and flip as bits and pieces of each channel morph together to put the mind on a journey through discomforting dreams. Every moment is different from the next, and it is all shrouded by a haze of confusion. The lines between dreams and reality blur, and the desire to sharpen them after waking up grows along with the aggravation of knowing that it cannot be done. Every SOTB song morphs constantly and blends into all the others – one moment gentle vocals sing excitedly over a slow uplifting melody and the next everything slows, and the vocals distort before being consumed by feedback.\n\nThe group masterfully elicits equal responses of discomfort and intrigue in their sound, a dichotomy which enthralls those that give them a chance. Thoughts are unformed, sentences are interrupted, and random statements are whispered in the background. “THERE’S NOTHING YOU CAN’T DO” is a prime example of SOTB’s elusive nature. At its core a song about the pain of rejection after being led on, the lyrics navigate through blood inside a cup, losing all sense of time, and the repeated screams of “I’ll be your friend.” With no clear thread between the lyrics and the ultimate message, everything feels grounded in uncertainty. The listener is pushed to draw their own conclusions which are often more muddled than the songs themselves. The constant alteration, though confusing, is always clearly intentional.\n\nThe musicality that SOTB generates produces an atmosphere that is strangely comforting. The prevalence of minor chords and unresolved melodies builds the tension that is at the core of their sound. A rapid drum pattern falls over itself at the beginning of “WAKE UP (IN ROTATION)” and from there every sound warps and layers against all the others, coming and going so fast that it feels like falling. Ending with a distorted screech that blends with similar sounding guitars at the beginning of “I SUCK THE DEVIL’S COCK,” SOTB holds the listener in their grasp, and only lets them go right before the pressure builds to be too much. There is always a message somewhere in the swirling daze, but it is in no rush to be found. Akin to astrology or tarot cards, it is best to let intuition lead rather than reason. The more that the hypnosis of SOTB’s sound takes over, the easier it is to discover the depth in their work.\n\nFurther supporting the atmosphere of their work are the vocal stylings of Zack Schwartz and Rivka Ravede. They open their mouths and the floor melts, transporting anyone in the path of their voices to another dimension where feelings flow easy. The delivery of most lines contradict what they say, allowing the listener to let their guard down while asking “is the hole we make devouring us?” just as casually as one would ask a friend how their day was. Even while distorted or haunting behind the ever changing tracks, Schwartz and Ravede refuse to be overshadowed by their production. Their voices are instruments that shift with the dynamic sounds, elevating simple repeated lines like “it might take some time” from bleak statements to touching poetry where nothing could be more meaningful.\n\nThrough all the convoluted metaphors and distorted sounds, SOTB occasionally flows out of the darkness to prove they have appeal beyond their eerie front. The song “fell asleep with a vision” is one of their shortest and most effective. Beginning as an 8D audio experience, a quick drum pattern emerges as Schwartz’ distorted voice gets layered with a tight, nostalgic riff. The essence of their sound is perfectly captured within a minute, and as quickly as it appears, the calming tones that began the song return and drown everything out. While “fell asleep with a vision” is a toe dip into the sound of SOTB, “THE SERVER IS IMMERSED” dives full force into it without compromising accessibility. The opening riff is backed by airy synths, and while the song climaxes with guitars that compete for attention layered with intense feedback, SOTB ropes it back in while “dozed on Ativan,” and Schwartz casually lulls any fears of the dark away as the synths return and the song closes.\n\nAcross their four albums, SOTB transformed from a run of the mill noise-rock band to a more complex and disturbed group with an energy that is uniquely their own. A step through the door of their sound is uncertain, and their mystery is addictive — the journey is always dark and twisted, but anyone that has a taste would give anything to go on it again.\n\nWith the opening lines of their song “Photograph” –– “Look at this photograph / Every time I do, it makes me laugh” –– Nickelback may have written some of the most notoriously mocked lyrics of the past two decades. And they are not the only ones. Daughtry, 3 Doors Down, Creed, and Stain’d are just a few of the bands that are branded alongside Nickelback as “divorced dad rock,” shunned for being “inartistic” and “not real rock.”\n\nTo be fair, there is merit to some of these claims. These bands have released albums that are repetitive and even uncreative. Sorting through their discographies, you won’t find too much variety or instances of these bands pushing themselves out of their lanes into new possibilities. Even so, social media shows a resurgence of support for “divorce dad rock” with people making videos admitting to secretly enjoying the genre. Perhaps the lasting influence of bands like Nickelback and Daughtry is not their artistic impact, but rather their nostalgic sound and their ability to provide audiences with enduring satisfaction. If listeners keep coming back, there must be something worth coming back to.\n\nDespite constant ridicule from the public, Spotify streams for these bands remain high. As of March 2024, Nickelback has 17.2 million monthly listeners. While the general public might know them for “Photograph,” the song isn’t even in the top five of the band’s most listened-to tracks. “How You Remind Me” — a song of brutal self-reflection, backed by lead singer Chad Kroeger’s confident rasp — stands at the top of the list with nearly 930 million streams. At 12.4 million monthly listeners, 3 Doors Down keeps a steady fanbase, and Daughtry’s 3.8 million still garnered 184 million streams for their number one track “Over You.” These are not record-breaking numbers, but they reflect how many people seek out these bands and enjoy their sound.\n\nIn terms of lyricism, the storylines these bands create have more to offer than seemingly shallow and unoriginal words. If one can keep from cringing during the start of “Photograph,” the storyline turns into one of reminiscence and grief for childhood memories. The opening lines establish the song’s bittersweet tone. Kroeger walks the listener through his hometown, singing to them as though they share the same memories while he notes how things have changed. The last lines of the chorus, “It’s hard to say it, time to say it / Goodbye, goodbye,” convey a reluctance to let go but an acceptance of the inevitability of change. The lyrics may not be complex, but they deliver a straightforward message listeners can relate to if they lean in and get to the root of the story.\n\nDaughtry’s “No Surprise” has similar lyrical depth, detailing the experience of a couple who no longer has a reason to stay together. The song has the expansive element of pop while maintaining an edgy quality with its solid drum track and confident lead guitar riff. The energetic building of the bridge and outro convey the duality of the couple’s feelings as they try to let go. It’s an expression of exasperation as well as a release of frustration. Even years later, this song hits home for listeners.\n\nDespite falling short compared to other modern rock, these songs demonstrate how we can enjoy bands for what they do well and forgive them for what they do poorly. Sadly, mob mentality now makes casual enjoyment of these bands difficult. When people hate for the sake of hating without formulating their own opinions, others are forced to feel guilt and shame for what they like. So was the case with Nickelback. Mention them to a stranger and chances are they will visibly cringe — it’s automatic. It’s visceral. If you listen to a comprehensive list of their songs and walk away still disliking them, that’s entirely justifiable. But if you’ve only ever heard the opening lines of “Photograph” and proceed to describe how Nickelback is a disgrace to rock, that’s regurgitation.\n\n“Divorced Dad Rock” exists as a label for a reason, and it’s valid for people to critique the style, but a band can lack the qualities that would elevate them to legendary status and still be enjoyable. After all, the root of music is celebration. You don’t have to buy their T-shirts or hang their posters on your wall. Just lend these bands your ears for a few minutes. When we pick apart the songs we may otherwise judge and really listen to them, we might just find something worth appreciating.\n\nCharli XCX’s song “anthems” was written and recorded in the early months of 2020 as the penultimate track for her fourth studio album, /how i’m feeling now./ Written about the pandemic from the perspective of a popstar and party girl, /how i’m feeling now/ manages to balance themes of loneliness and uncertainty with Charli XCX’s larger-than-life persona. Released at a time when live music and clubs were closed indefinitely, the album rebels against the mundanity of life in lockdown with experimental dance pop and racing synth beats. “anthems” is one of the most intense tracks on /how i’m feeling now/, and its lyrics reflect on the ennui of its time while looking toward a brighter future.\n\nIn 2020, celebrities were put under a microscope for the way that they discussed their experiences during the pandemic –– and for good reason. When people who are known for their wealth and success made public complaints of isolation or hopelessness, it did not exactly strike the chord of solidarity with the general public that celebrities hoped to achieve. Think of Gal Gadot’s infamous “Imagine” video, in which she was joined by other A-listers in a cover of the John Lennon song. Not only was it incredibly cringeworthy, but also tone-deaf, as millionaires in their luxury mansions were not faced with the same hardships as the working-class. Music created by mainstream artists during the pandemic were at high risk of falling into the same pitfalls of out-of-touch unrelatability. But Charli XCX, who wrote and released her album /how i’m feeling now/ in May 2020, successfully executed a “we’re all in this together” narrative without becoming a clichè. With “anthems,” Charli XCX taps into universal feelings of loneliness during the pandemic in a way that is both true to herself and relatable to her audience.\n\nSongs like “anthems” succeed in evading the insensitive nature of other celebrities because Charli XCX does not try to be something that she is not. She does not step down from her pedestal of a beloved pop star; if anything, she embraces it. In its chorus, she laments over how much she misses clubbing and partying: “I want anthems / late nights, my friends, New York.” The pre-pandemic life that Charli yearns for is not one that we all have –– she is longing for travel, exclusive clubs, staying out all night to party. Sure, there is a superficiality to this in its own right, but that is the point. Charli XCX isn’t a working class woman –– she’s a pop star, and her lyrics reflect her own life. She’s not pretending to have it as bad as everyone else in the world, but speaking directly to her own experiences.\n\nCharli counters the party-girl lifestyle that she misses with the verses in “anthems,” which break down the mundane nature of her day-to-day life. The song’s first words are “I’m so bored / wake up late and eat some cereal / try my best to be physical.” The juxtaposition of these plainly written lyrics with the chorus highlight the freedom and youthful recklessness that Charli XCX has been forced to give up – feelings that any twenty-something-year-old who lived through the pandemic can relate to. Because she speaks so frankly about herself and what she misses, Charli sounds more earnest when her chorus ends with “finally when it’s over / we might be even closer.”\n\nThe most successful aspect of “anthems,” and arguably the most successful part of /how i’m feeling now/ as a whole, is its innovative and experimental production. Produced by Danny L. Harle and 100 gecs member Dylan Brady, /anthems/ is driven by a raucous, high-energy synth chord progression. It is immediately attention-grabbing and infused with the energy of the late nights at the club that Charli misses so much. Its instrumentals make it so you don’t only understand what Charli is saying, but feel it as well.\n\nArtists and labels like PC Music had been creating autotune-infused, high-energy electronic pop music for years, but these musicians remained under the mainstream radar. Charli XCX helped to bring this subgenre to the forefront of pop music through frequent collaborations with producers like SOPHIE and PC Music founder A.G. Cook. Around the same time in 2020, Brady’s band 100 gecs gained traction in online spaces. For better or for worse, producers of experimental electronic pop were lumped together in the genre of “hyperpop.” Charli XCX herself seemed surprised to be assigned a new genre, tweeting “what is hyperpop?” in July 2020.\n\nIn a time during which the future of music was uncertain, Charli XCX delivered a new sound to pop music. Alongside her collaborators, she created an album that brought “hyperpop” to the forefront, and spoke honestly about her struggles during the pandemic. “anthems” is the perfect encapsulation of what /how i’m feeling now/ does best, and three years later, stands as a testament to its time.\n\nBoston is better known for its Tea Party, Fenway Park, and historic North End than its thriving music scene. These attractions draw much of the tourism to the city, but it’s those who live and study here that bring it to life. Over the past half century this small city has been integral to the formation of some of the biggest names in rock and alternative music. Internationally renowned bands such as Aerosmith, the Pixies, Drop Nineteens, The Lemonheads, and the Breeders trace their origins directly back to Boston. While these groups don’t share all too much in common, their early work shares important thematic ties to the city of their inception. Boston has never and likely will never achieve the artistic and cultural power of America’s metropolises, New York and Los Angeles. However, it can almost musically hold its own against massive urban centers such as Chicago and Atlanta. While this may not seem like the greatest achievement, Boston still punches well above its weight even just by population comparison. The unique thing about Boston is that it isn’t really trying to be anything else — our small city has almost always been enough for itself.\n\nPerhaps the two most prominent genres Boston-based artists have contributed to are punk and alternative rock. Punk adjacent bands such as The Lemonheads engaged with the culture wars and generally disaffected youth of the 80s, rising to prominence within the city and beyond. With a similar trajectory, the Pixies expanded their take on alternative rock from Boston-area bars to a worldwide phenomenon. One doesn’t have to dig all that deep before commonalities in a sense of place — and perhaps wanting to leave it — shine through between the bands. Angst and overall discontent were in vogue during the mid-80s, but something about Boston caused these emotions to bubble up in a far more cohesive way than other second-tier cities.\n\nAs the 80s turned into the outright youth rebellion of the 90s, the alt rock bubble rapidly became the music that young people flocked to for comfort and emotional release. While alt rock can be said to have developed simultaneously across almost every major metro in the US and beyond during this period, Boston sheltered its own unique breed. Perhaps long, windy winters led to just a little bit of extra anger or just being surrounded by echoes of historic rebellion whips up emotions — either way, alt rock took a decidedly more DIY and punk form than cities of similar size. The Breeder’s Kim Deal was based in Boston following the temporary disbandment of the Pixies to soak up the city’s energy. Although the Breeders ended up settling in Ohio to record and base their music out of, it is still important to recognize Boston’s role in incubating the group’s ideas and ethos — particularly the raw garageband sound and punk themes present in early albums.\n\nIn Beantown, bands could take over a basement for a night and find like minds in young people itching to break into the scene themselves. Differing from the myriad musical subcultures of larger urban centers, the youth of Boston fell into just a few different camps with associated social circles and lifestyles. While the argument for differences between hardcore and punk in the Boston scene could be made, the city just wasn’t big enough in the 90s to create a sense of specific geographic place; instead, kids who in other cities had defined territories ended up skating and partying in a lot of the same spots. This sense of uneasy comradery was essential to the growth of the scene and was clearly paralleled in more mainstream alternative circles. Even today, a house show might have indie pop and middle-of-the-road alternative rock in a lineup for the night.\n\nDrop Nineteens, a band that held up the shoegaze mantle in Boston better than nearly any other city in the US, was a shining example of how close physical proximity between scenes could create something greater. While shoegaze was a classification almost exclusively falling to groups coming from the UK, the band proved that Americans were just as capable of breaking into the subgenre as Brits. Their debut album /Delaware/ featured their original lineup and had far more staying power. Even today, a foray into the subgenre would not be complete with listening to “Kick the Tragedy” and “Winona.” The group ultimately found more popularity in Europe than the US, but key actions such as the recording /Delaware/ in Boston’s iconic Cyclorama building cemented their early years in our city — the same building that the Pixies recorded /Doolittle/ in. By starting out in Boston, their work was imbued with cross-scene influences that might never have reached them in larger cities.\n\nBoston’s small scale inadvertently acts more as a musical incubator than other cities in the US, taking some of the pressure to succeed right away off fledgling bands. Instead, artists have years to develop their sound through underground shows or gigs at one of the many universities within the city limits. Tastemakers Magazine’s own Battle of the Bands is a great example of this phenomenon — groups just starting out are given a platform to try out performance styles, get over stage fright, and engage with a particularly friendly audience. In a college town, bands can grow with the audience rather than having to meet fans in the middle; and besides, everyone loves being able to say that they went to a now famous band’s first show. In the age of the Internet, some local artists have had a meteoric rise to fame largely through an online presence — we’re looking at you, Clairo — but many bands can still be discovered here through the iconic basement show. Even in the age of streaming, fans flock to the dank cellars of Boston’s triple deckers to hear the first gasps of what could be the next big act in the alt or indie scene. Streaming largely picks up after the show, acting as a uniquely modern way to break out of the local scene and into the world at large.\n\nWhile our city can’t lay claim to pop icons the same way that New York or Los Angeles can, it has certainly secured its spot as an integral part of music history. More importantly, we should take stock of the unique factors that make Boston an incubator for incredible talent and try to safeguard it for the future. University-led initiatives and programs to develop or encourage local talent — this magazine being one of them — make sense as a method to highlight emerging voices and build fan bases. An endless supply of college students and 20-something transplants itching to get out of their apartments will always have interest in listening, but there must be easily accessible space for artists to play. Equally important are the choices made outside of institutions. The next basement show you go to in Allston could end up being an “I was a fan before they got big!” story a decade from now. Starting small and obscure is exactly the formula that Boston relies on for its music scene, and that’s why it has always — and hopefully always will — be home to a scene far more successful than the sum of its parts.\n\n“Isn’t it better to be first-rate? You don’t get any credit the other way.” - Art Farmer, 1990\n\n“Tell Art to save some of the beautiful notes for me.” - Snooky Young, 1990\n\nUpon a thorough analysis of the literature and commentary concerning the aesthetic tenets of jazz trumpeter and flugelhornist Art Farmer — the considerable dearth of which makes this a rather unexpectedly manageable task — one may be impelled to note the relative lack of attention given to the particularities of his style. The key word that appears, without exception, in every description of his style is “warmth,” in reference to the mellow roundness that defined his tone. With regards to other similarly “warm” players like Lester Young or Stan Getz, jazz writers do not shy away from imbuing their warmth with nigh-metaphysical qualities — for Young, an impossible sensitivity and weightlessness and for Getz, a wispy ghostliness. Judged against these standards, Farmer’s warmth is almost made to seem /merely/ so. Some critics attempt to elaborate further, attributing to Farmer a vague lyricism and economy of phrase; even these scant approbations are few and far between. His work was certainly well respected in its time, but in the intervening years has narrowed into, at best, a footnote in the annals of jazz music.\n\nThe lack of contemporary enthusiasm towards the music of Art Farmer is perhaps not entirely without justification. His general disposition of shyness and modesty was not particularly conducive towards the sort of caricature that maintains a figure within the popular imagination — he was the sort of man who was enigmatic precisely because there was so little enigma to grab onto. Neither was he much of a writer or innovator: for the whole of his career, Farmer mostly stuck to playing in a straight-ahead style that, by his mid-30s, was already somewhat out of fashion, and which to present-day listeners probably sounds like little more than dinner party music of the most squarely agreeable type. In a historical continuum of jazz trumpeters, one could generously refer to his style as a minor broadening of the emotional tenors of both the trumpet and flugelhorn. Conversely, one could less gratuitously assess his style at the /individual/ level as something of a devolution, whose goal of perfecting one specific stylistic affect above all else necessitated a conscious narrowing of his forebears’ emotional range.\n\nIt would be somewhat ostentatious, then, and perhaps even unfair, to saddle Farmer with the nebulous label of “genius,” although this does not detract from the immensity of his talent. Farmer was what he was — a committed stylist whose general eloquence, geniality, and good taste took him about as far as they could. He was deeply cognizant of the genius of such peers as Miles Davis and Lee Morgan, yet he was uninterested in joining them at the vanguard. But neither was he quite a traditionalist, which demands a certain subsumption under the weight of history. What he was fascinated and compelled by was what he would refer to simply as “the sound” — that ambiguous, ephemeral sound in his head that, as heard outside of it, sounded something like a mellow infinity. For the rest of his life, Farmer would toil away in search of that sound. On a few fortuitous occasions, he was able to find it.\n\nFarmer was hardly a no-name by the time he walked into the studio for his first recorded sessions as a bandleader, but it’s a minor miracle nonetheless that he was able to work with such illustrious names as Sonny Rollins, Horace Silver, Wynton Kelly, Kenny Clarke, and Percy Heath. These 1954 sessions are collected on his /Early Art/ compilation, and though Farmer’s performances are respectable throughout (even while often defaulting to impersonating Miles Davis on the ballads), it’s the presence of these stars, and the assured quality of their playing that carries the album. In any case, it’s not every day that you get players this good all in one place, and the album is still full of surprises: the perky head on “Soft Shoe”; Addison Farmer’s (Art’s twin brother) bowed solo on “Autumn Nocturne”; Wynton Kelly’s solo on “I’ll Walk Alone,” adding a splash of delicate levity on the otherwise somber standard; the Farmer-penned “Wisteria,” a lovesick ballad as worthy as anything he’d ever write.\n\nLike Sonny Rollins’ or Art Blakey’s runs through the 50s and 60s, Farmer’s contemporaneous run of albums remains relatively underheard in part because of how difficult it is to parse through them without a predetermined commitment — a constant deluge of fine music, put out at a rapid clip, that provides few obvious landmarks or jumping-off points for the tentative first-time listener. Even the rare devotee and/or maniacal completionist would be hard-pressed to argue for the essentiality of most of these albums to his body of work. Consider an album like his 1958 /Farmer’s Market/, a short, modest set of very standard hard bop tunes typical of the time period. One or two performances are of any particular note (“With Prestige” has quite the snappy tune, while the title track gives a happy up-tempo rendition of Farmer’s very first composition), and elsewhere the music is never anything less than pleasant, but it is also not exactly inviting of hyperbole or retrospective adulation. The quality of these albums was ultimately largely dependent on the strength of its session musicians, which is perhaps why his 1958 /Modern Art/ and 1961 /Art/ albums stand as the pinnacles of his early work.\n\n/Modern Art/, accompanied by the iconic pianist Bill Evans (only a few months removed from his work on Miles Davis’s seminal /Kind of Blue/), is a bluesy delight, with a superb selection of standards preceded by two terrific originals — the Farmer-penned “Mox Nix,” featuring an uncharacteristically swinging performance from Evans, and the ever-popular “Fair Weather,” with a gentle tentativeness to its melody. /Art/, an album of mainly lesser-known ballads that brings the great pianist Tommy Flanagan into the fold, is even better, with the baby blue of the cover presaging a springlike breeziness that inundates even the non-ballad tracks. It is in large part the continual back-and-forth between Farmer and Flanagan — with whom Farmer shared both a miraculous delicacy and a certain spareness of style — that carries the best tracks into the realm of the sublime. A track like “Younger than Springtime” shows both players endlessly nudging each other towards that mellow infinity of Farmer’s fancy, with Flanagan’s indelible introduction setting the stage for Farmer’s gently buzzing tone. “Goodbye, Old Girl,” meanwhile, gives attestation to what was indeed so remarkable about Farmer’s style — his sweetness and warmth belying a terrible lucidity, and with it, an unlimited capacity for rumination.\n\nDuring the time period spanning from the late 50s to the early 60s, two events of particular importance occurred. One was his adoption of the flugelhorn in lieu of the trumpet, which afforded Farmer an even mellower range of tone, albeit at the expense of the latter instrument’s power and brightness. The other was the formation of his Jazztet, a six-person group centered around both Farmer and Benny Golson, a sterling saxophonist and an even greater composer who was responsible for writing such classic standards as “I Remember Clifford” and “Whisper Not.” The Jazztet, with its short, snappy tunes played in an orthodox yet intelligent style that was meant to appeal to both jazz aficionados and more mainstream audiences, was shaping up to be something of a big break for Farmer and his band. It is a tragedy of an almost cosmic dimension, then, that on the very night of their 1959 New York debut, they were immediately overshadowed by co-billed performer Ornette Coleman, whose radical early excursions in free jazz proved much more interesting to the press than the Jazztet’s more conventional fare, and from which, according to Farmer himself, the band would never recover. Though this original incarnation of the Jazztet only lasted for a few short years from 1959 to 1962, it would prove belatedly influential in that it essentially launched the careers of a whole host of musicians: the great pianist Kenny Barron, the avant-garde trombonist Grachan Moncur III, and the legendary pianist McCoy Tyner above all (although it is telling of the band’s stylistic datedness that he quickly left the band to join up-and-comer John Coltrane’s quartet). This period would also see the tragic death of Art’s brother Addison — himself a member of the Jazztet — from a cerebral aneurysm, his own genetic predisposition to which would quietly haunt Art for the remainder of his life.\n\nA more complete representation of Farmer’s oeuvre can be found by examining his work as a session musician, which to most jazz artists remains a much more crucial part of their legacies than their own albums as bandleaders would suggest. Taken as an aggregate, these recordings suggest a surprising breadth to the idioms in which Farmer had familiarized himself with — driving hard bop on Horace Silver’s 1957 album /The Stylings of Silver/, a set of committedly soulful and penetrating performances on Sonny Clark’s classic /Cool Struttin’/ album from 1958, an eerily perspicuous evocation of urban nocturnal loneliness on the track “Fin de l’affaire” from Hank Mobley’s 1957 /Hank Mobley Quintet/ album. His lightness of touch, meanwhile, is crucial to the effect of various works such as 1963’s /Night Lights/, led by the great cool jazz saxophonist Gerry Mulligan (apparently quite popular nowadays as a frequent YouTube recommendation), or certain tracks on Sergio Mendes’s 1966 album /A Swinger from Rio/ (Farmer’s tone on the classic bossa nova standard “The Girl from Ipanema” is one of his very breeziest, though not even he could compete with saxophonist Stan Getz’s original performance in that regard). It’s a minor shame that he never shared studio space with Miles, with whom he shared a similarly reserved sense of articulation, though apparently, they were friendly enough — he even loaned his trumpet to Davis for a while after he pawned it for drugs.\n\nListeners acquainted with the self-imposed stylistic narrowness of Farmer’s playing might find themselves surprised by the sheer number of strange one-off albums to his name. Throughout the late 50s and early 60s, Farmer would try his hand at everything from kitschy pastiches of classical music (1967’s /Baroque Sketches/) to an album of traditional Swedish folk songs (1964’s /To Sweden With Love/) to a garish brew of Latin and big band stylings (1959’s /The Aztec Suite/). Of the many oddballs in his discography, however, few are as rewarding as 1965’s /Sing Me Softly of the Blues/, wherein the post-bop leanings that fitfully shaded a few of his previous works finally materialized in full. It’s true that Art Farmer had played with modernists such as Teddy Charles and Gerry Mulligan at earlier points in his career, but to hear Farmer’s trademark warmth working its way through and around these cold glimmers of modernism is a very strange and beguiling effect. Of particular interest is this album’s lineup: Steve Kuhn on piano, Steve Swallow on bass, and Pete La Roca on drums, all of whom were known for their experience working in the burgeoning jazz avant-garde, and all three of whom (sans Farmer) would end up working together on La Roca’s cult-classic /Basra/ album released the following month. It is no discredit to the quality of the album to say that it peaks with its first two tracks, both written by the late avant-garde bandleader and pianist Carla Bley: the anticipatory queasiness of the title track, almost maddening in how gradually it unfurls, and the labyrinthine spirals of “Ad Infinitum,” perpetually teetering between agitation and collapse.\n\nIt should be considered a point of admiration that even in the throes of the kitschy crossover jazz fusion of the mid-70s, Farmer very rarely suffered through such lapses in good taste. (Certainly, this would not be the case for even giants like Davis and Hancock — the sheer tonal ghastliness of works like Davis’s /Decoy/ and Hancock’s /Perfect Machine/ seemed beyond the pale for someone like Farmer.) Which is not to imply that he had wholly insulated himself from the popular styles of the time — even a cursory listen to the slow-burning crossover jazz-funk of his 1977 album /Crawl Space/ would dispel that notion. It was his unyielding consistency, however, along with his career-long focus on tone over speed or technique, that allowed Farmer to age quite gracefully into the 80s and 90s. Even in this late period, Farmer was still capable of stellar work (1988’s “Fairytale Countryside” is anachronistic high modernism at its very loveliest); at no point did his search for “the sound” abate. During his last decade, he would even switch instruments again, this time to the “flumpet” — a cross between a flugelhorn and trumpet, designed specifically for Farmer, that finally gave him access to the wide range of mellow and penetrating tones that he had always sought. With the exception of some live performances, however, his flumpet would only ever appear on his final studio album, 1996’s /Silk Road/. It would have been an interesting insight into his strengths and limitations to hear him gradually attempt to adapt to his change of instrument. Sadly, this was not to be: in October of 1999, Farmer was to die from heart failure at the age of 71.\n\nAs his legacy inevitably continues to fade, the question remains: why listen to Art Farmer? And, much like the man himself, there is nothing terribly perplexing about the answer — there is justification enough in his consummate craft, his unshakable, inexorable, all-encompassing warmth, his shaded romance, his perfect pleasure in perfect measure. Because to acquaint oneself with the minor masters is to better understand the elevated statures of the great ones, and because, in the music of mousy old Art, one is able to hear both a cipher of those that came before him and, in its own modest way, a furthered, singular development in possibilities of emotional expression in his chosen form. It’s great at dinner parties, too.\n\nIt is no secret that drugs and pop stars go hand in hand. Drug use innuendos first emerged as lyrics about cannabis within the walls of 1930s jazz clubs, escalating into the MDMA and cocaine hellfest of EDM and rave culture. What was once an individual issue became an industry-borne issue, rooted in an intense desire for escape in socially turbulent eras of oppression and civil rights struggles. Beyond the seemingly prosaic lyrics of popping pills and smoking cannabis lies the comforting burrow of being under the influence — a reprieve from the pressing demands of fame and society at large. With this, however, comes rising trends of drug-related deaths amongst musicians that bring forth the question of the need for support systems.\n\nLooking back, the 1960s counterculture was a catalyst for the normalization of the recreational drug use we see in today’s music industry. During this era, conflict, censorship, and media control brought about an oppressive atmosphere in the United States. Fueled by televised massacres and violence, the majority of Americans opposed the imperialist nature of the Vietnam War, resulting in a surge of young adults who rejected violence as a means of resolution. In lieu, these young adults embraced pacifism and social change and became known as the hippies. Brimming with colorful visuals, groovy motifs, and peace signs, the birth of hippie counterculture ensued. In response to an era marked by hyper-conformity and materialism, the hippies popularized a lifestyle centered around peace and spirituality, driven by a protruding desire for individuality. Psychoactive substances such as cannabis and LSD became a haven for hippies — a metaphysical escape that enabled them to plunge into a mind-altering realm amidst a world rife with violence. Following the widespread protests against the Vietnam War came Richard Nixon’s crackdown on the “War on Drugs” in the 1970s which demonized drug usage and declared it as “public enemy number one”. Drugs became a gateway to rejecting authority and the strict establishment under Nixon’s presidency that disproportionately targeted marginalized communities. The hippies’ reliance on drugs as a means of protest against the US government later molded the psychedelia and acid rock music scene, which placed perception-altering drugs at the forefront of the music experience.\n\nSonically, psychedelic rock incorporates punchy electric guitar riffs, complete with sound effects such as reverb and distortion, transporting listeners into an ethereal and surreal soundscape. Artists such as Jimi Hendrix dominated the psychedelia scene, which was no longer just a musical genre, but rather a cultural movement. Amidst an era of political turbulence and conflict, the hippies sought solace amongst one another, fostering a collective atmosphere of creativity and autonomy that birthed the classic 70’s aesthetic we know today. Hendrix himself was openly anti-war, with songs like “Machine Gun” explicitly referencing the deaths of soldiers in the Vietnam War.\n\nThe Beatles, pioneers of the 70s alongside Hendrix, first started experimenting with pills such as Preludin — over-the-counter German slimming pills — to get through long nights of performing. Preludin worked by suppressing one’s appetite and would subsequently give users a burst of energy. Ringo Starr, The Beatles’ drummer, credited the drug as “... the only way we could continue playing for so long.” For many artists, drugs became a necessity to cope with the long, demanding hours as well as being able to maintain stage presence. In some respects, drugs became a sanctuary for artists such as Jimi Hendrix and The Beatles who were openly anti-war and wanted to express their defiance towards authority and oppressive government policies.\n\nGradually, peace signs and tie-dye hues gave way to mohawks and leather jackets, marking the arrival of punk rock in the music scene. Lyrics became angry, passionate, and gritty, and although seemingly opposite to the peace and harmony the hippie counterculture preached, both genres were borne out of political opposition. The 1980s saw a rise in capitalism where profits were maximized at the expense of workers. Mental health was highly stigmatized and marginalized communities such as the LGBT faced heightened discrimination. For many punks, glue sniffing became all the rage — the practice of inhaling household chemicals that produce an alcohol-like intoxication combined with psychedelic visuals.\n\nOther punks gravitated to harder, more potent drugs. Heroin, also known as diamorphine, surged in popularity around the 1980s alongside the rise of rock and roll music. Rock artists like Kurt Cobain were known famously to abuse the substance, which ultimately led to his untimely death. Part of its popularity can be attributed to its plentiful supply and thus cheap prices, making it easily accessible. In the late 80s, Mexican cartels started smuggling the drug upstate to Seattle, which was a hub for plenty of grunge and rock artists like Kurt Cobain and Layne Staley. Availability of the drug meant that it was heavily incorporated into the rock and roll scene which was further exacerbated because it fit the rebellious imagery of rock and roll, encouraging young fans to turn to heroin.\n\nDuring this time, drug culture also left its mark on electronic dance music (EDM). EDM can be traced back to its roots in the late 1980s — underground warehouses known as “raves” where Black and LGBT+ individuals sought solace within the walls of electrifying music and neon strobe lights. Ravers don fluorescent clothing and succumb to the influence of psychedelic drugs — thrusting users into a sensory paradise, complete with entrancing visuals and pulsating bass notes. To some degree, EDM has become a modern reincarnation of what psychedelia was — a drug-centered cultural movement materialized through the innate desire for an escape from reality. Ecstasy, also known as Molly, is popular amongst ravers. Under the kaleidoscope of electric lights, ecstasy sends users to stratospheric levels of euphoria and energy. Unlike psychedelics such as LSD which exudes an introspective, calmer influence on users, ecstasy is associated with heightened levels of sociability which is conducive to the high-energy ambiance in raves.\n\nYet, despite the paralyzing grasp drugs have on many artists, little has been done to improve the crippling grasp drugs have on the industry. For many artists, drugs such as heroin and cocaine have been used as a creative vessel in their songwriting process, encouraging frequent drug use under the guise of creativity. Keith Richards, The Rolling Stones frontman, admitted that heroin greatly aided him when writing songs. He recalls “I wonder about the songs I’ve written: I like the ones I did when I was on (heroin). I wouldn’t have written ‘Coming Down Again’ without that.” Because of the prominence of drug references in music, there is a certain mystique that drugs exude which leaves many artists and fans romanticizing the perilous substances. Additionally, the myth of the tortured artist heavily glamorizes the idea that great art comes out of great pain, which further contributes to the misguided appeal drugs have on society.\n\nWhile we are quick to point out the dangers of recreational drug usage, it is difficult to break the systemic forces that seem to perpetuate it as a means of forming communities or as a creative vessel. To address this, artists have been vocal about drug rehabilitation campaigns and increasing awareness regarding addiction. Although dismantling such rigid norms in the music industry proves to be complex, opening up conversations about their impact is a step in the right direction.\n\nAt the 66th Grammy Awards this past February, the message was clear: pop’s future is female. Throughout the televised portion of the ceremony, female artists won — or were part of a group winning — every single competitive award, with Jay-Z standing out as the only solo male winner for the Dr. Dre Global Impact Award. With few male singers to showcase their talents at music’s biggest night, it begs the question: where have the male pop stars gone?\n\nIn 2023, the conversation around pop music seemed dominated by two powerhouses: Beyoncé and Taylor Swift. Both embarked on trailblazing tours, with Swift claiming the spot of the highest-grossing concert tour ever. Social media was ablaze with fans sharing pictures and videos of as much of the experience as they could, documenting their costumes, countdowns, commutes, and the performance itself.\n\nBeyoncé’s tour was so influential that cities extended their public transit hours to support fans, and it became the highest grossing tour by a Black artist ever. Both Swift and Beyoncé compounded their success, as Swift also released the highest grossing concert film while Beyoncé became the most Grammy-awarded artist with 32. Other major success stories from female artists from 2023 include boygenius, who broke out of the indie stratosphere into the mainstream, and Ice Spice, who became an internet sensation seemingly overnight.\n\nLooking at album sales tells a similar story, with female artists providing the only pop entries in the 10 best selling albums of the year. The male artists who made the list — Morgan Wallen, Travis Scott, and Metro Boomin — all had entries from country or hip-hop, leaving pop to be reigned by Taylor Swift and SZA. Even outside the pop genre, female artists were incredibly successful and broke new ground last year. Paramore became the first female-fronted group to win the Best Rock Album Grammy for /This Is Why/, while the Grammy for Best Country Album also went to a woman, with Lainey Wilson winning for /Bell Bottom Country/.\n\nThe data reflects pop music’s heavy female vocal backing, particularly when looking at Billboard chart performance. Overall, male artists were featured on or released songs that were the number one song of the week for 23 weeks of the year, roughly 44% of the year. Yet, nearly all of those weeks were from country artists like Morgan Wallen or Zach Bryan, and not pop. There were only 3 weeks out of the year in which a male sung pop song reached the top of the charts, 2 of which were from a K-pop performer. When pop songs make it to the top of the chart, they are increasingly anchored by a female singer.\n\nWith nearly all general field Grammy awards going to women, two female artists headlining the year’s most successful tours, and women dominating pop album sales, it feels clear that 2023 was a banner year for female pop artists. While there were male artists on significant tours last year, such as Elton John or Coldplay, neither seemed to permeate the cultural psyche in quite the same way. Artists who could have provided a more balanced pop genre such as Harry Styles or The Weeknd were dormant, with both artists last releasing music in early 2022.\n\nParadoxically, this may be due to the industry’s standards for women. It isn’t groundbreaking to claim that female artists are held to a higher standard: see Dua Lipa being bullied into learning how to dance or Justin Timberlake escaping his Super Bowl accident with Janet Jackson unscathed as an example. Under that higher expectation, female performers are asked to produce new looks, styling, aesthetics, sounds, and more with each album. While Ed Sheeran put out the pop album /-/ in 2023, there wasn’t the same output of highly choreographed dance routine videos or easter egg-laden puzzles.\n\nThis dynamic was perhaps best summarized by Taylor Swift in her 2020 documentary, where she said: “female artists have reinvented themselves 20 times more than the male artists. They have to or else you’re out of a job. Constantly having to reinvent, constantly finding new facets of yourself that people find to be shiny…. Be new to us, be young to us, but only in a new way and only in the way we want.”\n\nTo survive in the industry female singers have to produce an all encompassing aesthetic and atmosphere that turns an album release into not just a collection of songs, but an era, and do it over and over again. God forbid they keep the same haircut for more than two years and defy the cycle of reinvention. And perhaps this contributes to a greater visibility that makes it feel like female singers are truly /everywhere/, while male stars are missing in action.\n\nIt seems apparent where the male pop stars could have gone: other genres. Country and R&B remain firmly entrenched in listener’s preferences, and in those respective fields, male singers dominate. Bruno Mars provides a helpful example of this trajectory. He started out as a mainstream pop act, but has tested new musical sounds and evolved over time, moving away from a pop beginning. This trajectory culminated in his 2021 musical duo with Anderson .Paak, Silk Sonic, releasing /An Evening with Silk Sonic/, which leaned on an R&B, soul, and funk sound.\n\nAt the same time, the disappearance of certain male pop stars might simply reflect the cultural preference moving on from the niche they filled. In the early and mid 2010s, radios couldn’t seem to get enough of youth pastor pop artists like Olly Murs or Andy Grammar. But as audience’s preferences shifted their genre fell out of favor, and another type of male pop star was eliminated. Another example of disappearing male artist idolatry is the diminishing cultural cachet of boy bands that once dominated teen music taste, from NSYNC and Backstreet Boys to One Direction and 5 Seconds of Summer.\n\nWhile it is clear that 2023 was a female-centered moment in the pop zeitgeist, the question then arises of if this dynamic is here to stay. It's helpful to look at the male pop stars who did succeed last year in capturing our attention to get a better answer. Troye Sivan, Jimin, and Jungkook all had songs that grabbed our attention and adoration, and they did it by creating a heavily curated look and smoothly choreographed dance routine to match. In short, they did what female singers have been doing for decades. If the new formula for pop success is simply to do what female artists are already doing, then women are well suited to continue dominating the genre.\n\nYet this feels like a genie’s perverse granting of a wish for equality in the music industry. Instead of taking a step back in our borderline obsession with female artists and their relationships, bodies, and lives, we seem to have shifted to doing the same with men. If the reason female singers have dominated pop music recently is simply because male artists haven’t caught on or refuse to sacrifice more of their privacy, then it is nothing to celebrate.\n\nPop music possesses qualities that differentiates it from other genres, and can explain why female performers are succeeding. For one, the listeners of pop music are predominantly women, which differs from genres like hip-hop, requiring pop to cater to its audience’s preferences. Additionally, it is a genre fundamentally composed of evolution and changing tastes, something that female artists are adept at navigating thanks to cultural expectations.\n\nCountry flips the structure found in pop, with female singers often having to conform to a post-9/11 form of “bro country” music heralded by Florida Georgia Line and Wallen. Instead of a standard of constant reinvention, female country artists are asked to largely stay the same, continuing to play into traditional gender roles and having a harder time finding an audience that wants to hear about something other than alcohol or pickup trucks.\n\nThese differences might keep country and hip-hop from seeing the type of landscape in pop music for years to come. But if 2023 represents women truly taking hold of the expectations of a performer and industry beliefs, then they are in store for a true revolution in music.\n\nIt’s a tale as old as time: an artist can be driven mad by their work. These films have emerged as fan-favorites among cinephiles, but not only because their characters are so bold and memorable. Without music, these characters are almost incomprehensible. As they are paired with classic films of their genre, these scores are perfect examples of how to use music to capture the delusion and grandiosity of a “tortured artist.” With the insight these scores provide, the audience has a familiar language to work with while inhabiting a new, uncomfortable skin. Here are five movie scores that crawl into the twisted minds of their complex main characters:\n\nBlack Swan (2010)\n\nFrom the first moments of the film’s score, the audience can tell that this story is a tragedy.\n\nUsing the music and narrative structure of the classic ballet “Swan Lake” to build tension through the eeriness of distant familiarity, composer Clint Mansell corrupts the recognizable, beautiful themes of Tchaikovsky’s magnum opus with fresh pangs of madness and intrigue. “We had this idea to deconstruct [Swan Lake], to rip it apart, to find the core of it,” said Mansell of his unique approach to scoring the film, which included rearranging portions of the ballet to emphasize its darkest qualities while leaving others untouched. Mansell uses a chilling, well-refined palette of piano and strings to communicate the severity and terror of Nina’s transformation into the Swan Queen. The disturbing onset of such familiar themes feels almost hallucinatory, blurring the line between fantasy and reality and making the viewer react as if they too are possessed by the immensity of Nina’s role. The undeniable beauty of the score paints Nina’s fate as inevitable, and in a sick way, justified. As the score climbs to its final climaxes, we understand the gravity of what Nina was chasing. Mansell’s use of Swan Lake is an ode to perfection, a lesson Nina is all too familiar with.\n\nWhiplash (2014)\n\nNeiman, an emotionally distant and abused young student, hardly belongs in the same league as some of the other characters on this list. But his twisted relationship with Fletcher, his instructor, bleeds into the film’s score. Justin Hurwitz and Tim Simonec’s jazzy compositions allow Neiman to lean into his darkest impulses, eventually driving himself to a breaking point (quite literally), while creating space for Fletcher to disarm the audience with tender piano performances that unearth a sensitivity to an otherwise brutal character. At other moments, atmospheric electronic music underscores the characters’ private life, revealing a layer of delicacy the film otherwise neglects. By blending these genres, the composers expand the conflict between the image the film’s characters wish to present and the way they truthfully feel about themselves. These moments contrast sharply with the loud, heavy sounds of rehearsal scenes with the full band as performed in the film. Instead of leaning into the bombasity of jazz, Hurwitz and Simonec build these tracks one note at a time, using the textures of a jazz band in a new way, creating a result that feels like earthly electronic music. The blend of classic ingredients and new techniques perfectly captures the push-and-pull of Neiman’s addictive passion for jazz and sadistic attachment to Fletcher’s instruction.\n\nPhantom Thread (2017)\n\nJonny Greenwood’s lush and tender score for “Phantom Thread” subtly builds tension and emotional drama as the audience realizes how harmful the dynamic between Reynolds, the well-established fashion designer, and Alma, his lover and muse, really is. Greenwood, Radiohead guitarist turned film composer, was inspired by the dense orchestration of love ballads of the 50s and 60s, recording the score with a full 60-piece orchestra. The film, and its score, operates in the cross section between erie and alluring, exploring the ways that beauty and aesthetics can mask darker truths. The sheer devotion, controlling nature, and passion of Reynolds comes through in the score’s intense swells of string instruments. Neurotic and deceptively charming, this score plays up the main character’s knack for aesthetics and appreciation of beauty.\n\nTár (2021)\n\nHildur Guðnadóttir set out to capture \"the messiness of the work involved in preparing classical music for performance” in the score for “Tár.” Posed with the unique challenge of needing to literally embody the film’s titular character, Guðnadóttir created the fictional music that highly-acclaimed composer Lydia Tár is working on in the film. In this metastructure, Guðnadóttir repurposes Mahler’s Fifth Symphony as performed and conducted live by Cate Blanchett and the Dresden Philharmonic. Juxtaposed with Guðnadóttir’s sparse non-traditional compositions, these rehearsal scenes are particularly memorable. The film’s score and narrative both rely on Mahler’s work for a heightened sense of credibility and tradition while leaning into the titular character’s wandering, corrupt nature in its original compositions.\n\nAt points in “Tár,” the score is almost undetectable, drawing the audience’s attention to the sheer magnitude of the Mahler’s Fifth in roaring rehearsal and performance scenes. “It's like having a ghost in the room that you can't see, but you can feel,” said Guðnadóttir of her unconventional score. “For Petra” is delicate and fleeting, unlike basically everything else in the film, while the very stern “Tár” three-part composition reveals the titular character’s mastery of tension and discomfort. Guðnadóttir includes Tár speaking German to her orchestra in recordings of rehearsal scenes to weaponize the exclusivity of classical music and displace the audience. We are left out of the action just as we are finally able to hear what Lydia has been preparing, forced to sit back and let the experts work in private. These moments are a reminder of how Lydia sees herself and the world of classical music: an elite club, to which the entry fee is blood, sweat, tears, and the right connections.\n\nMay December (2023)\n\n“May December”’s score is best captured in a brief description from director Todd Haynes: “exciting, juicy, strange and excessive.” Throughout the film, Natalie Portman’s Elizabeth makes moves as bold as the score while she navigates how to portray a complicated, widely-hated figure in a manner that is digestible to Hollywood’s audience. Marcelo Zavros, the score’s composer, repurposes the theme’s chords from the score of the 1971 forbidden-romance drama “The Go-Between” composed by Michael Legrand, building a sense of horror in an otherwise calm film. The film’s music belies a sense of discomfort and evilness, meant to serve as a counterpoint to what is happening on screen: with the addition of music, the film's most serene, domestic moments easily become some of its most intense. Only in “May December” can the line “I don’t think we have enough hot dogs” send a pit to the audience’s stomach, aided by the spectacle the score creates. The score is designed to take the viewer out of the film and pressure them to sit with the grotesque and contradictory characters with a renewed sense of reality. As the film progresses, the viewer begins to anticipate the next thrum of a dark, rich chord, but is left on their toes as Zarvos leans into the delicacy that the emotional world of the film’s characters require, keeping the audience firmly in the role of “spectator.” The film’s viewers are forced to make judgments and participate in the delusions of Gracie, and eventually Elizabeth, by the omnipresence of the score. “May December” is the “tortured artist” score in its final form, using its meta structure and campy style to sow villainy and outrage among its audience.\n\nFrom Johnny Cash to Morgan Wallen, some visual and sonic totems like blue jeans, liquor, and guitars have been consistent in the history of country music. These symbols have been used by different artists across the genre’s history, telling stories of heartbreak, triumph, and Americana. These representations have also historically been used to promote conservative political causes, and they continue to do so when used by modern country artists. This has become clear as country experiences a new golden era –– one that, according to /Billboard/, saw an increase in listening by 20.3% in the first 6 weeks of 2023. Four of the #1 /Billboard/ Top 100 hits of 2023 were country music songs, with the songs varying in their levels of political messaging. Looking at the history of these artists' politics, and the history of the cause they are supporting, provides information on how causes are cultivated for an artists own gain, and why some political messages are chosen over others.\n\nMorgan Wallen had the biggest undeniable country hit in 2023, with his song “Last Night” living at #1 on the Hot 100 Chart for 16 weeks. The song is apolitical in nature, using many of the emblems expected from a country hit to recount the feeling after a night of heavy drinking and the accompanying fear of having ruined a relationship. The song’s avoidance of politics may be surprising to those who know of Wallen’s past controversies and social stances. In October 2020, Wallen’s scheduled “Saturday Night Live” appearance was "
