        "text": "JanIt’s a fact: Every astrologer has a favorite planet they hold near and dear to their hearts. I personally adore Pluto—and so should you! (Sorry, NASA, Pluto is still a planet in astrology, whatever you say!)\n\nPluto Retrograde resides on my Libra Ascendant in my birth chart and has taught me many lessons over the course of my life. First off, I’ve become more tolerant of other people’s views and opinions, which, um, isn’t always easy. I’ve also come to embrace the hidden depths of my personality, like my unwavering loyalty to others, confidence, and brutal honesty. TL;DR: I’ve learned to embrace all my emotions—the good, the bad, the ugly—and to commit my life to personal growth. Not too shabby for a lil teeny planet, amirite??\n\nWhat does Pluto represent in astrology?\n\nWhen we look at our charts and cosmic transits, the dwarf planet Pluto represents transformation. While Pluto may be small in size (it’s approximately half the width of the whole United States *the more you know*), it packs a bigger punch than most other planets in astrology. It moves slowly, taking a whopping 12 to 30 years to move through just one sign and 248 years to move through the whole zodiac.\n\nPluto’s energy is extremely potent and powerful. The bb planet represents the underbelly of emotions, what lies beneath the surface, and the subconscious mind. All the parts of ourselves that we do not share freely with the outside world. (Casual.) It destroys weak foundations, only to rebuild stronger and more resilient than before. (Again, totes chill.) Pluto is also the natural investigator and BS detector of the zodiac—it’s hard to get anything past this intense planet. In a word: intense.\n\nOn a deeper psychological level, Pluto is the master of transformation. It's always evolving. The lil bb planet is also, um, kinky. Like, Fifty Shades–level kinky. Pluto is sexually explorative and finds great pleasure in pain, bordering on masochistic. (It’s no surprise that it’s the ruling planet of Scorpio!) The reasoning is that Pluto loves to explore and honor edgier sentiments within. Pluto urges us all to normalize fetishes and fully embrace this side of ourselves. Why? Because Pluto wants us all to live our truth, not hide.\n\nPluto as a generational planet\n\nBecause of its slow movement through the zodiac, Pluto is sometimes called a generational planet—meaning that most millennials have the same Pluto sign. For example, people born between 1983 and 1995 are sometimes even called the “Pluto in Scorpio generation.” Unlike, say, Mercury’s movements, which have a strong effect on the details of your day-to-day life (hey, Mercury Retrograde), Pluto’s movements are more about the bigger picture—think missing your train versus, um, a worldwide pandemic (yeah, some astrologers said the Saturn-Pluto conjunction back in January 2020 was a sign that something world-changing was coming soon).\n\nOn a bad day, Pluto can bring out power struggles with others and triangular relationships. (PSA: Love triangles do not necessarily mean a third IRL person is involved.) (Although, yes, it can sometimes mean that too.) Instead, it might mean that, say, our desire for fame and success stands between us and our partners. Or religious differences. Power struggles are common with Pluto, too, as the need to always be “right” and in control can force us to have arguments with others. It can add heaviness and obsession to relationships and projects—with Pluto currently orbiting the sign of Capricorn, it has proven to be the latter of the two.\n\nPluto as a ruling planet\n\nPluto is the ruling planet of Scorpio. Which makes sense, right? Scorpio is the sign of sex, death, and transformation, aka all of Pluto's favorite things. They both share a spooky, mysterious vibe, too. Thanks to Pluto, Scorpio is drawn to the mysterious, the occult, and the spiritual.\n\nBTW: Because Pluto wasn't discovered until 1930, Scorpio has another ruling planet: Mars. Mars is Scorpio's ruler in traditional astrology, while Pluto is Scorpio's ruler in modern astrology.\n\nPluto Retrograde\n\nBecause of its long orbit, Pluto spends about six months of every year moving retrograde. And lucky for us, it's nowhere near as chaotic as Mercury Retrograde. Pluto's status as an outer planet—and the outermost outer planet, at that—means that the changes of Pluto Retrograde have a subtler effect on our day-to-day lives than those of the inner planets like Mercury and Venus.\n\nThat said, Pluto Retrograde can still bring some big changes. In particular, you might learn some secrets, go through transformational personal growth, or get in touch with your intuition.\n\nWhere is Pluto right now?\n\nRight now, Pluto is in the process of moving from Capricorn to Aquarius. Let's get specific: Pluto was in Capricorn, the sign of structure, from January 24, 2008 to March 23, 2023. Then, it briefly dipped into Aquarius until June 11, 2023, before moving back into Capricorn during its retrograde period. Pluto re-entered Aquarius on January 20, 2024, but it'll dip back into Capricorn from September 1, 2024 until November 19, 2024. Then, it'll stay in Aquarius until March 8, 2043—that's right, 19 whole years!\n\nYour Pluto sign\n\nRemember how I said Pluto is a generational planet? Yeah, that means that there are some placements, like Pluto in Aries, that zero people currently living have in their birth chart. BTW, see how some of these dates overlap? That's thanks to Pluto Retrograde, so double check your birth chart to be sure.\n\nPluto in Aries:\n\nDates: 1823-1853\n\nVibe: This period in history marked a time of paranormal activity and a rise in mediums.
