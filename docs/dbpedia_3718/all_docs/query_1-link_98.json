        "text": "A quick note from Megan: This new music directory tool is a work in progress. Venues can browse available musicians wishing to perform at Lost 'N Sound more easily than our original spreadsheet. That thing was a beast and hard to use. As new musicians apply, their information will automatically appear in this directory for your review.\n\nYOU CAN NOW SORT AND FILTER! Using the small tab at the top, browse musicians by their availability, group size, sound needs, and other key details.\n\nMore to come. For now, enjoy scrolling through. It's still better than that old spreadsheet. Remember, this is not to be shared. It is a private tool with confidential information available ONLY to participating Lost 'N Sound venues."
