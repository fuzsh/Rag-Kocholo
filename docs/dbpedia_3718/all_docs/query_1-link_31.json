        "text": "Our colleague and friend Mr. Stephan ‘tWitch’ Boss was informed that his mandatory presence was required this upcoming weekend for a Las Vegas performance with So You Think You Can Dance. For those of you persuing a dance career, this is a lesson in the seriousness of contracts between you an your employers. Mr. tWitch deeply regrets his absence at the Dance Rogue event, but was gracious enough to arrange a surprise to us that we are extremely excited to offer you all!Now for this weekend’s faculty line-up we will be featuring one of the dance industry’s biggest and hottest choreographers of the moment, a regular SYTYCD JUDGE and SYTYCD CHOREOGRAPHER, the inventor of the style Krumping, and a man who mentored and helped tWitch put his career on the fast-track: Christopher ‘Lil C’ Toler!\n\nLil C takes pride in a dynamic career that includes movies like Be Cool, Stomp the Yard, Bring It On Again, Center Stage: Turn It Up, as himself in the Krumping documentary Rize, plus Television choreography such as the Teen Choice Awards, SYTYCD and Bones, live performances with Chris Brown and Ciara among others, not to mention featured in music videos for artists like Madonna, Sean Paul, Jennifer Lopez, Missy Elliot and more!\n\nUpon tWitch’s recommendations, Lil C has been waiting for a chance to bring his unique style and energy to a Dance Rogue intensive, and the opportunity has landed in our laps sooner than expected! Since Lil C is known for scouting talent where ever he travels I hope you all are prepared and will be on your toes when you take his classes! This is a tremendous opportunity to learn from one of the absolute best the dance industry has to offer, and for you to show him your individual style and talent as well.\n\nI would definitely recommend watching his reel (which I’ve attached), and get yourself mentally prepared for this monumental opportunity. Although we are sad not to see our good friend, we are elated to with the quality of his replacement, and hope you are too!\n\nHave a pleasant week, and please feel free to contact Dance Rogue with any questions you may have about this intensive.\n\n“If you think you can, you can. If you think you can’t, your right”\n\nCharles Lawrence\n\nDirector, CEO & Founder | Dance Rogue, LLC\n\nThank you and have a blessed day!"
