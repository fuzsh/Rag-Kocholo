        "text": "The legal battle over the “All the Stars” music video is finally over. According to a report The Blast posted earlier today (Dec. 27), Kendrick Lamar and SZA have officially settled the case, which revolved around their usage of one artist's artwork in the visual.\n\nOn Dec. 21, court documents were filed by both parties who have agreed to drop the litigation against each other. The case stems from a lawsuit in which artist Lina Iris Viktor accused K.Dot and SZA of stealing elements of her copyrighted paintings for their “All the Stars” music video, which is from the Black Panther soundtrack.\n\nShe claims that her works “Constellations I,” “Constellations II” and “Constellations III” were featured in the video despite her giving them no permission to do use them prior to the visual being released.\n\nIn the suit, Viktor states that TDE reached out to her twice regarding using her artwork and she denied them both times. Nevertheless, the artist claims they recreated facsimiles of her works in the music video.\n\nViktor said her artwork was copyrighted and that Kendrick and SZA infringed on those copyrights. She sued for unspecified damages, plus an injunction on her copyrighted works.\n\nDetails of their settlement have not been disclosed. But all claims will be dismissed and the entire case is closed, in accordance to their agreement.\n\nXXL has reached out to Kendrick's team for comment but, at press time, the reps have yet to respond.\n\nWatch Kendrick Lamar's \"All the Stars\" video featuring SZA below."
