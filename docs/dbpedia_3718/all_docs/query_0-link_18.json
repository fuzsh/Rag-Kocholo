        "text": "In approx. 1984, after learning breakdancing basics from a wee friend at YMCA Day Camp in Cheyenne, Wyoming, my meanest cousin saw me attempting doe-limbed backspins in grandma's kitchen, probably with Michael Jackson's \"Wanna Be Startin Somethin\" on the boombox, and scoffed:\n\n\"Breakdancing? Breakdancing is a fad.\"\n\nI was devastated. (And jaded by age seven! That's just wrong.) But he was kind of right. Breakin' the movie had just been released, and even though it starred real breakers-- Boogaloo Shrimp and L.A. Lockers' Shabba-Doo-- it put the fad-lock on breakdancing, the act. Through incredibly cheesy dialogue, a proto-multi-culti love plot, and an unfortunate proliferation of neon, Breakin' popped its way into the suburban corners of America and stamped the breakdance with an expiration date. It made breakdancing a symbol of an era that would be later discarded with Michael Jackson's glove, and resurrected with Missy Elliott's Adidas tracksuit. (To be fair, Breakin' also brought the Bronx-born artform to a lot of kids who otherwise wouldn't have accessed it, including me-- sans proper context, sure, but lots of those kids taught themselves.)\n\nWith a few exceptions, the Breakin' soundtrack wasn't completely true to the songs b-girls and b-girls were dancing to-- \"Apache\", James Brown's \"I'm Black and I'm Proud\", Afrika Bambaataa's \"Looking for the Perfect Beat\". (B-girls and b-boys still break to this stuff; however, while they're all near-perfect for the breaks, one wonders if the ubiquity of these classic tracks at b-boy functions helps to pedestalize/canonize the purity of the art form and nostalgia for hip-hop's early days. But let's talk about that some other time.)\n\nMinus the classic driving funk and deep elevator-lifts of bass, the Breakin' soundtrack left us with tinny inspirational dance-jams and a few classic but tangentially related, R&B/disco-pop/funk cuts. (i.e. the cult-disco dancer's soliloquy \"Body Work\" by Hot Streak-- later re-constituted by Jacques Lu Cont's Les Rhythmes Digitales, \"Jacques Your Body\" [groan]). They proffered the Bar-Kay's vocodor-y \"Freakshow on the Dancefloor\" and offered \"Reckless\", one of Ice-T's first-ever helpings on wax, and the first hip-hop Eminem ever heard. Meanwhile the thought of someone getting down to the Breakin' theme song, Ollie & Jerry's \"Breakin': There's No Stoppin' Us\"-- which revolves around lots of handclaps and non-quantized vox-- is slightly mortifying. (To their credit, Ollie & Jerry started their career in RAYDIO-- a sort of figurehead band headed up by Ray Parker Jr., before he disbanded to write hits, including New Edition's \"Mr. Telephone Man\". And this year the track was gilded re-upped into a \"funk club mix\" on a white label by Break Brothers, something you can jack to.)\n\nThough it's a documentary, Dave La Chappelle's new movie Rize has brought another danceform to the same moment as Breakin'. Rize chronicles krumping and clown-dancing, a type of high-speed body-jacking invented and popularized over the past ten years in some ghettos of South Central Los Angeles. Like breakdancing, it's an emotional, intense dance centered around combat, battles mimicking fights in a show of skills-- and like breakdancing, it formed as a home-grown alternative to gang culture, and a physical type of therapy for kids living in extremely poverty-stricken and segregated areas of Los Angeles. While krumping has already been mass-exposed in videos (Missy Elliott, again, for \"I'm Really Hot\"; also the La Chappelle-directed \"Dirrty\" by Xtina), Rize might be the beginning of krump as a fad, or it might be a graceful gateway into the commercial lexicon. (With the most luck, it'll get the kids in the film paid; Lil C, a dancer featured in Rize who also raps on the soundtrack, is currently teaching krumping classes-- and it is my favorite thing ever that he calls his dances \"krumpography.\")\n\nA common complaint is Rize doesn't feature the actual music clown-dancers and krumpers krump to; thanks mostly to oppressive licensing costs, its music doesn't necessarily correlate with real life. Onscreen, the kids in South-Central body-jack and hip-pump to tracks like Dizzee Rascal's \"Fix Up Look Sharp\" (and, in La Chappelle's world, have their emotional moments to my girl Christina Aguilera's \"Soar\".) But last week's New York Times Magazine reported that some krumpers in L.A. were practicing to 50 Cent (that maniacally oinking dis track \"Piggy Bank\"). Its critics are partly right-- surely krumping's as centered around commercial hip-hop as the rest of the world-- but they got around it by making their own music: soundtrack to Rize is dominated by Flii Stylez, a man who made his debut on the Gunz & Roses 2 mixtape by DJ Fingaz and Stat Quo, and who's more in the krump than you might presume, at least after noting dance film soundtracks' funky precedents.\n\nFlii Stylez raps half the album and the theme song, too, and like Shabba Doo he's a longtime dancer: part of Richmond, Calif.'s Housing Authority crew, which is why he learned to clown and krump before he and Red Ronin Productions wrote anything for the soundtrack. He told the arts review website 3blackchicks.com, \"I had to become one of them to make the songs work the way they do, and that was not difficult. I grew up in the projects myselfÉ. We spent a lot of time together and I wrote them from the kids' point of view. As a dance choreographer I related to them perfectly. I feel their spirit.\"\n\nAs a result, every rap-- even all the really mean-mugging, grunty posse raps-- are about dancing, and battle dancing at that. (LEAN YOUR OWN DAMN SELF BACK: 2005 is about PHYSICAL ACTIVITY.) And the songs, they're not even crappy! The theme isn't so terrific, pretty much because as a general rule theme songs suck, but \"Wildin'\" is the hottestÑa beefy, ATL-alluding electro-funk bass underneath a sharkish chorus of \"WILDIN'.\" The soundtrack may not be entirely locale specific-- while L.A.'s Planet Asia contributes one track, Flii's home of Richmond is part of the Bay Area-- but then, Ice T, the consummate West Coast gangster, was born in Newark. What's important is that the musicians worked in tandem with their subjects. Meanwhile, the cottage industry begins to flourish: the Rize soundtrack comes with a special DVD called How to Krump (just like the Ô80s' instructional breakin' videos). A bootleg DVD called Get Krump is for sale, and krumpkings.com just popped up promising eight krumping DVDs-- Krump Stamina, Krump 2.0, Lil Homies of Krump-- forthcoming after August, up into 2006. And me-- now I'm old enough to sue my mean cousin if he says shit about it. Fad. My. Ass.\n\nREMINDER: It's summer and you want to be rubbed down. Right now, at this hot (as in, Spike Lee-levels of hot) New York second, I'm experiencing DJ Benzi's Summer Madness mix (hosted by Ying Yang Twins & gettable at http:// www.djbenzi.com; mixtape Easter bunny http://www.lemon-red.org put me on). It's currently my coconut-basted BBQ shrimp w/lime-aid summer & kissing-boys R&B/hip-hop sustenance: Faith Evans breaks the chains of bad boyfriends on \"Goin' Out\" (w/Pusha T & Pharrell); Nicky B's wears heart-on-sleeve for \"I'm in Love\"; the sly-breezy \"Margarita\" is upped by Sleepy Brown, Pharrell & Big Boi, and \"Wassup Wassup\" by A-Town Players is 1995's BEST SONG EVER, etc.\n\nSpeaking of Ying Yang, do not miss the \"Crut's Hush-Up Mix\" of \"Wait (The Whisper Song),\") by Crut. It does for \"Wait\" what producer Polow Da Don did for Mya/Chingy's \"Fallen (Zone 4 Remix)\": gives it an uptempo, aortic tilt-a-whirl and flings just to watch it fly. (Crut himself is locatable at john-book.com, and ranges from GG Allin band-foiling to shit-hot hip-hop mixes and mash-ups. He is currently working on his 22nd album.) And yes, before you get yr arms up, si, it is truly hushed up and lady friendlier than the original. Wassup wassup.\n\nJulianne Shepherd is totes blogging right now at Cowboyz 'n' Poodles."
