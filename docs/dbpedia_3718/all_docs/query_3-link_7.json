        "text": "Slabs of bass beat split the air, seeming to warp the walls as the Rice Track Family started dancing at the Silverado Park Teen Center one Sunday in May. Outside, dusk was falling on a mellow evening in Long Beach, Calif., the sort of night when fluke winds swirl in from the desert and ruffle the fronds of the royal palms, rousing the rats from the crowns.\n\nThe tune on the boom box was \"Piggy Bank,\" by 50 Cent. As Rod Soriano, whose dance name is Hot Rod, cranked up the volume, the other boys at the rec center started to pop their chests and sway. Abruptly, each in turn, they began to whip their arms around, hunching their shoulders, bending their bodies toward the sound and the violent lyrics, trancelike, as if some sort of battle was about to begin.\n\nThey shut their eyes then and let their heads nod. As the beats filled the room, the dancers started quivering and then caroming, at first delicately, then spasmodically, then picking up velocity in an alarming but strangely graceful way. They looked like rubber bands do when the tautened elastic is sprung. So submerged were the dancers in the dance that it was not clear how they managed to avoid crashing into the cinder-block walls or into the sharp-cornered foosball table or, for that matter, me.\n\nThe dancers took turns showing off their moves, first a teenager called Chris (Pokeey) Tanedo and then Marvin (Junior Pokeey) Salvador and then Raf (Young Pokeey) Ocampo and then Mark (Baby Pokeey) Irang and then Cliff (Little Pokeey) Sung and then Laurence (Solow) Gogit, the only member of the group whose nickname is not a play on the Tagalog word for \"scar.\"\n\nThe dance they were demonstrating is called krumping, equal parts break dance, pantomimed battle and demonic possession. As break dancing did 25 years ago in the South Bronx, krumping arose spontaneously some time in the last decade in neighborhoods in Long Beach and throughout South Central Los Angeles. And, just as break dancing was confined at its beginnings to a fragment of a New York borough then in ruins, krumping is still mostly unknown beyond the freeways that border these ragged areas of L.A.\n\nOver the past five years or so, though, a phenomenon that began with a handful of dancers has grown to include perhaps a thousand dancers and at least 80 independent crews, loosely organized and all part of a network connected informally but intricately by word of mouth. Most krump crews are black, but many are Asian, like the Rice Track Family, or white or Latino; they are allied less by race, as it happens, than by economics and their commitment to an unlikely form of art.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
