        "text": "'This film has not been sped up in any way,' says the very first frame of David LaChapelle's feature-length documentary Rize. It's an unusual caveat but one that turns out to be entirely warranted, because Rize contains some of the most mind-boggling dance footage ever seen on film. Rize chronicles the evolution of krump dancing, a new street-dance style from South Central Los Angeles that is so mesmerisingly manic and athletic that film-goers brought up on CGI wizardry could be forgiven for assuming there's been some hi-tech tweaking. But in Rize the special effects are solely provided by the dancers' bodies.\n\nRize is the first feature-length film from LaChappelle, the American fashion photographer and pop video director. His speciality has always been hyper-stylised glitz - he is Elton John's favourite photographer - and so to find him directing a documentary with pretensions to social anthropology is a bit like finding Dame Edna presenting Newsnight. But two minutes into Rize it becomes apparent why, in krump, LaChapelle has found his ideal subject. The dance sessions have the sort of startling energy and edgy aesthetic that turn heads in the best pop promos.\n\nSuch unforgettable imagery needs little augmentation: LaChapelle provides a simple narrative through interviews chronicling krump's emergence, and the result, if occasionally a little cheesy, is one of this year's best documentaries, a worthy star at this year's London Film Festival. As a lesson in the exhilarating physical power of the art form, its sequences are up there with the best films about dance.\n\nKrump dancing resists definition because it's a style that is continually changing. In the course of Rize, we see how the dance evolves from the 'stripper dance', a high-octane booty-shake into a kind of sinuous, furious, free-form demonic possession (some dancers even 'get krump' in church, as a way of communing with Jesus). Glistening limbs flail at impossible speed; the movement is so aggressive that it looks like the prelude to a fight. One dancer calls it ghetto ballet.\n\nBut just as breakdancing - the photogenic expression of an emergent hip hop culture - was much more than a passing fad, so krump, Rize contends, is much more than a ghetto cabaret. LaChapelle's film argues that this is a new American art form, one born out of oppression.\n\nRize begins with footage of the 1965 Watts riots and the 1992 Rodney King riots, defining South Central historically as an area of systematic subjugation. If you hold people down, the film declares, they will rise up, whether it be in the form of riots or a dance that looks like an internalised riot. It even links the convulsing moves of krump to ancient African tribal rituals.\n\nThe roots of krump are as bizarre as the dance itself. After the initial montage, the film cuts to footage of a large black man in a huge, rainbow, afro wig, painting cutesy red balloons on his face as he is interviewed. This is the unlikely godfather of the scene. In 1992, Thomas Johnson was released from a five-year jail sentence for cocaine dealing, during which time he underwent a religious conversion. He began entertaining at children's parties in the South Central area as Tommy the Hip Hop Clown, manhandling balloons into sausage dogs, doing a few dance moves to booming music. The children loved his routine. particularly his dance style, a medley of gyrating hip hop steps, low-grade acrobatics and knock-off Michael Jackson moves.\n\n'I was so moved by how these kids were touched. Going through the neighbourhood, pumping the music, pulling up a crowd of people. It became the hottest thing,' he says.\n\nWith a bevy of eager recruits, Tommy opened a 'Hip Hop Clown Academy'. As his charges grew up and moved on, other rival groups sprang up. These groups challenged each other to battles, but unlike other LA gangs, chose the dance-off, rather than the shoot-out, to channel their latent aggression. In response, Tommy founded Battle Zone, a monthly showdown where the various clown groups could compete for prestige.\n\nFrom Tommy's clowning moves, some dancers evolved krump, the more aggressive, expressive style that one dancer, Lil C, describes almost as a form of possession: 'It's a way of communicating without even speaking; when somebody's getting krump, you can hear what they're saying when their arms are swinging, when they're popping, when they're stomping.'\n\nCome November 2003 and Battle Zone V, featuring the Krumpers against the Clowns, drew more than 16,000 people. It forms one of Rize's best sequences, a ringside crowd watching a titanic contest, but one in which not a single punch is thrown.\n\nThis was all taking place smack bang in the centre of the film-making capital of the world, but strangely no one had thought to record it. 'No one [in 2002] even knew about it outside South Central,' says LaChapelle. 'In LA, you have Hollywood, Beverly Hills, Bel Air. And then you have South Central, which might as well be south east Asia. People don't go there. But my friends Tone and Rich Talauega are from the 'hood [both are celebrated hip hop choreographers who also helped with the music on Rize]. And they said, \"David, you need to see this thing.\" I saw it and knew immediately I wanted to make a film.'\n\nOver the next two years, LaChapelle followed a group of the top krump dancers with names such as Miss Prissy, Tight Eyez, Dragon and Lil C, exploring their backgrounds, aspirations and how a feeling of community has evolved around the scene. The film is as interested in the sociocultural cause and effect of this anarchic new art form as in the art form itself.\n\nAs LaChapelle says: 'The more I got into these people's stories, the more profound it became, because they're dancing as a survival tactic. South Central doesn't have any infrastructure, so it perpetuates poverty and oppression. It doesn't have social services like health care; let alone art programmes. What's mind-blowing is that this incredible art form sprung up where there are no art classes.' Or, as Miss Prissy puts it: 'There's a lot going on down here in South Central that's hard. There are homes being disrupted by violence, and a lot of people do drugs or drink to deal with that. Instead of doing that, we dance.'\n\nIn contrast to LaChapelle's signature pop video style - hard-candy visuals, art-directed to a lustrous gleam - in Rize he opts, in the main, for a straightforward formalism. There is no narrator and no tinkering with the chronology or the footage. As such, LaChapelle is adamant that Rize should not be seen as 'a hip hop dance video'. But when the film was released in the States in June, he locked horns with his American distributors over the film's marketing.\n\n'They took the cast of the show onto Good Morning America to teach some blonde twinky how to \"do the krump\". Yet they were at Sundance [where the film premiered] and they saw how a sophisticated audience responded - they were standing up, emotional, crying; 60-year-old women said this film moved them, because they were inspired. Yet they marketed it as a new dance craze.'\n\nThis may be because in Hollywood 'new dance craze' sells better than 'trenchant sociocultural critique'. In this sense, while the astonishing dance sequences in Rize suggest comparisons with other hip-hop classics like Charlie Ahearn's 1982 breakdance movie Wild Style, its most obvious forerunner is 1990's Paris Is Burning. While few people saw Jennie Livingston's underground documentary of New York drag queens competing in dance balls, many are familiar with vogueing, the dance craze it spawned, thanks to that magpie of the zeitgeist, Madonna, who borrowed it for her 1990 Vogue video. Unsurprisingly, Madonna wants a piece of the krump pie; LaChapelle turned down her invitation to direct her latest video. Undeterred, she hired Miss Prissy to krump for her instead.\n\nLaChapelle says that he hasn't seen Paris Is Burning for a long time, but he sees the similarities between the films: both have their subjects talk to camera while applying make-up; both show the disenfranchised forming new families among their friends. 'Marginalised people tend to create new structures, art, and ways of releasing anxiety and aggression. They validate themselves by creating a hierarchy where they are important.'\n\nAnyone who listens to chart hip hop would have thought that such a hierarchy and value system already existed in the ghetto. Isn't every kid supposed to want to be 50 Cent, getting rich or dying trying? In a film that is resolutely upbeat, perhaps Rize's most optimistic message is that, finally, hip hop culture may have spawned an alternative to the violence, materialism and crass misogyny of 'bling'.\n\n'[These kids] are opposed to what's being sold to them in the hip hop world,' says LaChapelle. 'A lot of rap is about getting more money, becoming a mogul. And they're not buying that, which is shocking. In the film, they say, \"We're worth more than a piece of jewellery, or some big car.\" They're tired of people coming to the hood to shoot a video, getting some street cred and going back to their mansion over in Bel Air. And these kids treat their women, the women who dance, as equals. They're not buying what's being sold to them. They're looking for something more profound.'"
