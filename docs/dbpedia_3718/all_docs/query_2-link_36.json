        "text": "Few songs withstand time, distinguished by their infectious beats, experimental sounds, poignant lyrics or enduring appeal, rendering them as classics. In partnership with Tres Generaciones Tequila, a brand that champions the journey and not just the destination, we’re on a exploration to roundup the top Get Up Anthems over this next year from these six cities: Houston, Atlanta, New York, Chicago, Miami and Los Angeles. Guided by curated panels, we delve deep into each city’s sonic history, spotlighting tracks that embody resilience, authenticity, and innovation and celebrate the power music has to inspire listeners to get up and chase their passions, in the spirit of perseverance.\n\nThe Top 10 Get Up Anthems from Houston were crafted through a blend of editorial expertise, data-driven analytics, social impact and personal sentiment, to create a ranked list of the songs which inspired, captivated, and energized the Bayou City. In a historical dive from 1973 to present day, the city’s playlist [click HERE to play] features hometown hits that are synonymous with the city’s rich history and culture, hand selected by Houston’s very own, Bun B. and Chase B, Billboard editors, Damien Scott and Cat Johnson, and moderated by Rocsi Diaz.\n\nDid they get it right? Or were they off the mark?\n\nTake a look at the Top 10 Get Up Anthems for Houston:\n\n10. “Mind Playing Tricks on Me” – Geto Boys (1991)\n\nKnown for its haunting piano loop, gritty production, and raw, introspective lyrics, “Mind Playing Tricks on Me” epitomizes the distinct sound and storytelling prowess of the Geto Boys, off of their 1991 album, We Can’t Be Stopped. The record pushed the album to reach No. 5 on Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums, and spent three-weeks at No. 1 on the Hot Rap Songs chart, No. 10 on Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs and No. 23 on the Hot 100 and went on to influence Kid Cudi’s No. 3 Hot 100 hit “Day ‘N’ Nite.” The song still pulls an average of 750,000 streams a week since last summer.\n\nBun B.: “This record not only set the tone for us musically, but also business wise, that you don’t have to run in New York, you don’t have to go to L.A., you don’t need nobody. You can do it right here in Houston. That set the tone for us.”\n\nChase B.: “I was born in 1990. The song came out in 91, and, literally I was out just running around on Saturday, just going to different brunches and whatever different, DJ sets and everything and I must’ve heard that song 6 or 7 times.”\n\n9. “Savage (Remix)” – Megan the Stallion feat. Beyoncé (2020)\n\nBringing together two of Houston’s prominent female voices, the remix not only propelled Megan Thee Stallion to greater prominence but also showcased the enduring influence and talent of Houston’s homegrown artists on the global stage. The song’s infectious beats, catchy hooks, and confident delivery epitomize the trademark styles of both artists, creating a synergy that captivates listeners. To no surprise, the song gave Megan her first No. 1 hit on the Hot 100 and Beyoncé’s first in almost three years. It was the No. 1 on Streaming Songs, spent three weeks at No. 1 on the Hot Rap Songs chart, No. 1 on R&B/Hip-Hop Airplay, No. 1 on Rhythmic Airplay and No. 7 on Pop Airplay. The song still pulls an average of 1.5 – 1.75 million streams a week since last summer.\n\nBB.: “I think it’s also a good look for Houston women in particular. Once again, Beyoncé understands the platform and understands her power and passes that on to the next generation of Houston representatives for the women.”\n\nCat Johnson: “So it was Megan’s first number one [on the Hot 100] and Beyoncé’s first number one in almost three years, which is a big deal. Like Megan did that for Beyoncé in a sense. The song also pulls an average of 1.5 to 1.75 million streams a week.”\n\nDamien Scott: “t was a massive moment, and Meg was on the rise. And as Bun said, this was Beyoncé passing it forward to the next generation, handing her the baton. And, you know, not just for her being a major, black female musician, but someone from her hometown.”\n\nRocsi Diaz: “ I think that what Megan did for Beyoncé was bring out more fun out of Beyoncé, I think she gave her the liberty to really go down and drop, although we were already dropping down on our knees.”\n\n8. “Get Throwed” – Bun B feat. Pimp C, Jeezy, JAY-Z and Z-Ro (2005)\n\nCrafted with Bun B’s signature lyrical prowess and accompanied by infectious beats, the 2005 hit record, “Get Throwed” from the legend’s debut album Trill, embodies the chopped and screwed style synonymous with Houston’s rap culture. Featuring collaborations with fellow Houston legends Pimp C, Z-Ro, and Young Jeezy, the song seamlessly blends gritty realism with infectious energy, creating a sonic landscape sure for a crowd favorite. Since its release, it peaked at No. 49 on the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart, and No. 24 on Rap Airplay.v\n\nR.D: “ First of all, can I say that’s one of my favorite songs? And that’s not because you’re sitting here that’s just like as a song.”\n\nC.B: “ just when you hear those guitars in the intro, that’s like one of the most important fabrics in Houston culture, just, in general, and it’s been sampled so many times just because of what it means and just the whole aura of it, the atmosphere of the sound and just how slow it comes in. And also just the title of the song, throwed is obviously a huge Houston word, you know, born and bred right here in Houston, Texas.”\n\n7. “25 Lighters” – Fat Pat, DJ DMD & Lil Keke (2001)\n\nThe song’s laid-back vibe and infectious groove capture the essence of Houston’s street culture, while its evocative lyrics pay homage to the city’s unique slang and traditions. Released in 1998, although the song didn’t chart nationally, the track became an instant classic within the city’s rap scene, embodying the spirit of Houston’s underground culture.\n\nB.B.: “ It’s so Houston that ZZ Top remade the record. And I don’t mean a play on the record, they literally redid the record just singing instead of rap. And I mean ZZ Top, we’re talking about Texas. We’re talking about Houston. It’s a big deal.”\n\nC.J: “The song didn’t chart, but on a national level though, you’ve heard “25 lighters.”\n\nDamien: “It’s one of those songs that’s just like an indelible part of the fabric of of hip hop. It’s. Everyone knows it. Everyone you know has either recited it or used it or remixed it or sampled it. It’s just one of those songs.”\n\nR.D.: “It was a victim of the timing of when it came out that it just didn’t make it outside of the South. Per se, charting wise, but again, to piggyback on what you said, like, it’s just a classic hip-hop song.”\n\nB.B.: “This was like us getting to hear Pat again after him passing – like new music. That was a big part of this record being as big as it was, like as far as Houston.”\n\n6. “Wanna Be a Baller” – Lil’ Troy feat. Yungsta, Fat Pat, Lil’ Will, Hawk, and Big T (1999)\n\nServing as an anthem for ambition and perseverance, “Wanna Be a Baller’s” portrayal of the hustle and dreams of making it big resonates deeply with Houstonians, reflecting the city’s entrepreneurial spirit and drive for success. As the fourth track on the album, Sittin’ Fat Down South, it helped propel the album’s success, reaching No. 6 on Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums and No. 20 on the Billboard 200. Lil’ Troy’s melodic delivery and vivid storytelling paint a vivid picture of the city’s street life and aspirations for success, making it an instant favorite among listeners, still pulling an average of 1.25 million streams a week since last summer. The record peaked at No. 5 on Rap Airplay, No. 31 on Hot Rap Songs, No. 70 on the Hot 100 No. 22 on Mainstream R&B/Hip-Hop Airplay.\n\nB.B.: “It’s unmistakably Houston recipe’s big team. One of the best hooks ever to come out of Houston. That independent spirit, right? Lil’ Troy is one of the first people to have an independent label here. The original person to find and sign Scarface and, I mean, “Wanna Be a Baller” was a hit record as soon as anybody heard it.”\n\nC.J.: “Crazy fact. It still pulls an average of 1.25 million streams a week.”\n\nD.S.: “It’s one of those songs that you hear every year. At least once. If you go to, like a basketball game or, you know, a festival or you watch a movie.”\n\n5. “Southside” – Lil’ Keke (1997)\n\nOff of his 1997 debut album, Don’t Mess With Texas, “Southside” by Lil’ Keke stands as a timeless ode to Houston’s hip-hop culture through its authentic lyrics and enduring impact on the city’s social fabric. Both the title of the song AND album quickly suggests to listeners Houstonian pride, remaining a cherished part of the city’’s musical identity. The song reached No. 28 on the Hot Rap Songs chart and No. 55 on Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs.\n\nBun B: “Keke is as Houston a person as you can get. And I’m not talking about music, lyrics or rapping. Any day you sit and talk to Keke and see his personality, his character, he’s Houston, all right.”\n\nD.S.: “I think if this was released later in the time of streaming, it would be a way bigger hit and it would, it would dominate, it would be on every playlist. It would be way, way higher on the hip hop chart, would probably be on the pop charts. It was just a massive song. And you hear it everywhere, it’s one of those songs again that everybody, if you’re a rap fan of a certain age, you just know it. Everyone’s used to it, everyone knows where it’s from. They know Keke. This is a classic record.”\n\nC.B.: “This is the only song from Houston that has a dance attached to it. And to that, I feel like, is an anthem.”\n\n4. “Tops Drop” – Fat Pat (1998)\n\nFat Pat’s vivid storytelling creates a sonic experience that resonates with listeners, capturing the essence of cruising through Houston’s streets and slab culture. The song’s portrayal of Houston’s car culture and laid-back lifestyle resonates deeply. The record reached No. 5 on Hot Rap Songs and its parent album Ghetto Dreams reached the top 40 of Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums, peaking at No. 39.\n\nC.B.: “‘Welcome to the land where just don’t stop is:’ I feel like that just embodies where we are, where we’re from. That’s, you know, MLK on Sundays. That’s this. You really can see the sunshine and old schools and slab lines, you can envision the whole thing when it comes to that song. And, you know.”\n\nB.B.: “The song is a testament to how much Houston loves its hip hop community, and some of us here, as we talked about earlier, will never have nationally celebrated records. But because we’re a part of certain records, that represent the culture of Houston.”\n\nC.J.: “The song is in a major retailer commercial in 2024. And the fact that, again, people from all across America, maybe even the world are going to be re-introduced to the song via this commercial, it’s amazing – iconic.”\n\n3. “Still Tippin’” – Mike Jones feat Slim Thug and Paul Wall (2005)\n\nReleased in 2004, the song propelled Mike Jones to national fame while showcasing Houston’s unique rap style and culture to a broader audience. This would become each artist’s first entry to the Hot 100 charts, peaking at No. 60 and No. 25 on Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs. Built on a mesmerizing beat, catchy hooks, and Mike Jones’ distinctive flow, “Still Tippin” captures the essence of Houston’s rap scene in the early 2000s and since last August, the song still pulls in 1 – 1.25 million weekly streams on average.\n\nD.S.: “ It’s just rare that you get to witness a watershed moment in music. Yeah. You know, it’s rare that you get to be present for it and see it. And a lot of people at the time don’t may not understand what’s happening. But I think with this, everyone who was watching and listening thought to themselves, this is the start of something new.”\n\nRoxy: “It stayed on the countdown, that’s for sure. Just stayed on the countdown.”\n\n2. “Mo City Don” – Z-Ro (2005)\n\nThe 6-minute freestyle, “Mo City Don” by Z-Ro holds a revered place within Houston’s hip-hop pantheon, embodying the ethos and experiences of Mo City (Missouri City), a suburb of Houston. The composition is marked by its raw authenticity and emotional depth and the song’s production features haunting melodies and a hypnotic beat that serves as the backdrop for Z-Ro’s introspective and impassioned lyrics. Although there wasn’t any noticeable charting activity for the song, the influence of this song is undeniable. As the opening track on Let The Truth Be Told, the localized success of the record contributed to the album reaching No. 5 on Top Rap Albums and No. 14 on Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums.\n\nC.B.: “First of all, as a loud and proud Missouri City for my entire life, this song is another testament of how well Houston artists flip samples as songwriters, not even necessarily the beats, but as songwriters and just take it our own thing. Growing up in a house party, that middle school, high school and everything, this was our chance to, like, kind of, like, represent where we were from, and it belonged to us.”\n\nB.B: On a daily basis. On an hourly basis. There is no record in Houston, I think in 2024 that more people will agree represent Houston than ‘Mo City Don”\n\n1. “June 27th” – DJ Screw (1996)\n\nYou cannot debate Texas music and fail to mention DJ Screw’s chooped and screwed technique. The 1996, 38-minute freestyle evokes a sense of nostalgia and reflection, characterized by its hypnotic tempo, slowed-down rhythms, and manipulated vocal effects. Through its unconventional structure and immersive atmosphere, “June 27th” captures the essence of DJ Screw’s artistic vision and his deep connection to the city he called home and although it never charted due to its non-commercial release, the 38-minute freestyle is a hometown beloved.\n\nB.B: “You’d be hard pressed to find something that represents Houston culture, to a myriad of people right across the board, that this song doesn’t really speak to.”\n\nC.B: “I just feel like if you’re going to pick a Chopped and Screw song, this is obviously the one to do it. And I feel like Chopped and Screw music definitely should be represented on the list. So I feel like June 27th, this is like its purpose right here.”"
