        "text": "40. Die Lit – Playboi Carti: I’m not the biggest Playboy Carti fan, and I had no intention listening to this project until I saw the album cover. It looks like a photo you would see in a mural on the backstage walls of a historic music venue that’s on the verge of being condemned by city health inspectors. Album cover praise aside, there are enough stand out moments for me to warrant including it on this year’s list. The real star of Die Lit is the production, while Playboi Carti does tie it all together with his vocals, the mood and the foundation of which the album relies on is due to the production. Frequent Playboi Carti producer Pi’erre Bourne has his fingerprints all over the production credits, and I think it’s a much stronger album thanks to those contributions. My favorite example is the ethereal, euphoric sounding “Foreign” it helps capture the unrealistic levels of wealth that Carti’s music career has brought it. While Die Lit does suffer a bit from album bloat, its high points are worth checking out.\n\nNotable Tracks: R.I.P., Shoota, Poke It Out, Foreign\n\n39. Chelsea Jade – Personal Best: I’m a sucker for dream pop. There’s something about the muted beats and the hazy vibe that cause songs from this genre to burrow through my ear canal into my mind where they will dominate my thoughts for the rest of the day. Chelsea Jade’s debut is no exception with her understanding of the genre on Personal Best. The title track “Personal Best” feels like a manifesto of Jade’s goals in artistry, suggesting that a personal best would put a limit on what she’s capable of, but rather “best is better,” all backed by this subtle, thumping base. Personal Best is at its best in the subtlety whether it be in Jade’s soft spoken, soothing voice, or in the light and dreamy production. Along this line, the climaxes here are better off for their lack of bombast unlike what you would expect on a similar project, rather Jade is content with either subverting the expectation (like on “Personal Best” at the track’s conclusion) or by easing you into a light high note (like on the conclusion of “Color Sum”). Chelsea Jade is a great new addition to the dream pop landscape, and I’d say her best has no borders.\n\nNotable Tracks: Personal Best, Color Sum, Speed Boat\n\n38. Rich Brian – Amen: For all his talent, I’ve worried that Rich Brian (formerly Rich Chigga of Dat $tick fame) would have a tough time breaking away from his gimmick status that brought him viral success in 2016. Amen at the very least shows that the Indonesian rapper has the potential to make a substantial career of hip hop without totally abandoning the humor that got him notoriety in the first place. While Brian does have plenty of moments where he fleshes out his typical style (specifically “Amen,” and “Kitty”), the real draw for me is where he ventures off the beaten path. I’d love to see Brian explore this dreamy, tropical sound more on future projects, songs like “Introverted,” “Glow Like Dat,” and “Little Prince” exhibit the tone I’m referencing. These tracks add a new texture to Brian’s style; if he could improve on his singing a little bit then I think it would make him a complete package as a performer.\n\nNotable Tracks: Amen, Glow Like Dat, Kitty\n\n37. iridesence – BROCKHAMPTON: In 2018, BROCKHAMPTON found themselves embroiled in controversy as one of the group’s most prominent members, Ameer Vann, faced sexual abuse accusations. It was a difficult but admirable decision by the group to kick Vann from the group, sticking by their values as one of the most progressive voices in hip hop, but it nevertheless put their future into question (I mean Ameer was the album artwork for all three entries into the Saturation trilogy). iridesence gives us a look at the massive hip hop collective that makes them sound more like a veteran group than the young visionaries they are. This album finds the group reflecting on their meteoric rise in the year before and how much of their life has changed as a result. The individual members of BROCKHAMPTON attempt to cope with the difficulty of the forced aging that comes with becoming successful and being put under the social media microscope, they talk about the hard decisions that come with the business side of art, the depression that they carry, and the longing for simpler times where none of this was as important (as highlighted on “TONYA”). Kevin Abstract once again proves that he’s one of the most interesting voices in hip hop and R&B today on tracks like “WEIGHT”. iridesence might not reach the same heights that the Saturation trilogy did, but it’s yet another solid entry in to an already impressive catalogue of music.\n\nNotable Tracks: NEW ORLEANS, WEIGHT, TONYA\n\n36. Leon Bridges – Good Thing: Good Thing has the benefit of immediately feeling familiar to the listener thanks to Bridges excellent grasp on classic genres like classic R&B, disco, and smooth jazz among others. While I worry that Leon Bridges is one day going to paint himself into a corner as “the throwback impersonator,” (see recent criticisms of Greta Van Fleet for what specifically I mean) but I don’t think that concern has been fully realized yet. There’s a track for just about every occasion on Good Thing making for a universally pleasing project without it becoming shallow. My personal favorites throughout this album is when Bridges cuts loose and lets his charming personality carry a track. “If It Feels Good (Then It Must Be)” is so much fun, the playful guitar plucking, Bridges’ ability to make it feel like he’s talking directly to you (I’m pretty sure I blushed at least one time when I heard this song since it made me feel this way), it makes for a fantastic dance song. “Georgia to Texas” is a song that I’d love to see Bridges flesh out into a full album. I love it when Bridges delves into family history (like on “Lisa Sawyer” from his 2015 album Coming Home), it makes for some of the best content he has to offer. While I was disappointed that “Georgia to Texas” was the only example of this on Good Thing, it was good enough to tie me over for the next time.\n\nNotable Tracks: Bad Bad News, Shy, If It Feels Good (Then It Must Be), Georgia to Texas\n\n35. Clean – Soccer Mommy: Famed woman in indie rock released her debut project Clean this year and caught a ton of buzz for it. It’s a spiteful, cynical, take on relationships, but wrapped in breezy, echoing guitar riffs and elongated bass tones. You’d never know Sophie Allison was singing about hating being an accessory in someone’s life (on “Your Dog”) or wanting to be her boyfriend’s ex because she appears to be better in every imaginable way (on “Last Girl”) thanks to the light tone of the instrumental on this track. Clean is a simple little project that concludes just after 30 minutes of run time, so I don’t have much to say on it other than I can’t wait for more from Allison’s music career!\n\nNotable Tracks: Cool, Your Dog, Blossom (Wasting All My Time), Skin\n\n34. Lush – Snail Mail: Lindsey Jordan’s debut project Lush under the name Snail Mail is a pensive reflection on an anonymous “you” and the complicated emotions that bubble up as a result. The project is an emotional roller coaster that ricochets from sullen and wounded on “Speaking Terms” to vengeful and righteous on the peppy “Heat Wave” as she hopes that “Green Eyes” finds love that consumes them, only to have it rejected. Lush is a spectacular debut from Jordan as she reflects on what I can only interpret to be fresh emotional wounds.\n\nNotable tracks: Speaking Terms, Heat Wave, Full Control\n\n33. What Happens When I Try To Relax – Open Mike Eagle: Open Mike Eagle is at his best on smaller, but more focused projects. I would regard the thought provoking and clever A Special Episode – EP as one of the best releases he’s ever put out, and I’d say we’re getting a similar output on What Happens When I Try To Relax. “Relatable (peak OME)” is classic Open Mike Eagle, you’re treated to a spacy, droning, synth beat as Mike stretches out the last syllable of every line and ponders the artificial “relatability” of being a creator in the digital era. This facade of relatability breaks down in the second verse, Mike releases his anxieties into the world and then ultimately concludes that “At the end of the day it was too irresponsible”. The relatability paradox is one that I often feel as I erase a caption for a dumb meme that I’m posting (or as I re-write these reviews for the fifth time to prove that I know what I’m talking about). “Southside Eagle” is another standout track to me as Mike explores his creative trajectory like his burgeoning podcast career (Adventure Time fans I recommend you check out his show Conversation Parade, it’s lovely), the struggles of being an independent artist, and the problem that Mike has identified as most crucial in his career “[How] to reach black kids in a room full of whites”. Mike presents himself as an imperfect, struggling, artist; through his clever observations and eclectic beat choices, this decision pays off.\n\nNotable tracks: Relatable (peak OME), Single Ghost, Southside Eagle\n\n32. Joey Purp – QUARTERTHING: As the city of Chicago continues to make its case as the best represented city in this generation of hip hop music, Joey Purp often appears to be the forgotten one. Not poetic enough to be Mick Jenkins or Saba, not poppy enough to be Chance the Rapper, I always find him just outside of the conversation. Enter QUARTERTHING, Joey Purp’s first official studio release. Where Joey’s previous efforts often sported production rich with traditional horn arrangements and boom bap percussion, QUARTERTHING is a departure in favor of an electronic vibe. The opening track helps bridge a gap from Joey’s previous project iiiDrops as he proclaims amazement at the progress and growth he’s seen to this point, yelling “I’m still alive!” is a heartfelt, positive start to a project that serves as a retrospective on the young rapper’s grind. I love the viewpoint that’s afforded to the listener between the two tracks “Look At My Wrist” and “2012”. It’s an interesting pairing of songs towards the end of the album that gives you an idea of how exactly Joey’s perspective on friendship, street life, and growing up has changed over the years. QUARTERTHING is excellent as an official debut for Joey Purp, and I love that he gets his moment to relish in the spotlight.\n\nNotable Tracks: Godbody Pt.2, Elastic, 2012, Lebron James\n\n31. Mitski – Be the Cowboy: Be the Cowboy brings to the fore a vulnerable, wounded, and confessional Mitski; a decision that makes for an engaging and relatable album. At times this album plays like slide reel of crimes one’s committed against their own heart in a desperate attempt at feeling whole. Most of the examples are these innocuous interactions that can be devastating by virtue of rejection from a former lover. Throughout the album Mitski depicts the effort she puts in to move on from a former lover, only to “lose” as soon as she sees them in person again (on “Lonesome Love”) or her willingness to be walked all over just for a kiss (on “Washing Machine Heart”). If you’re like me and have found yourself in a comparable situation, you’ll feel secondhand embarrassment or endear yourself to the feelings of longing (depending on the temporal distance of your own experience). The crushing inevitability on the album’s closing track “Two Slow Dancers” is a poignant closing note as Mitski’s voice is accompanied by a minimalist keyboard arrangement as she explores the fleeting nature of relationships and the painful drift that happens as the participants’ age. The final moments play out like the end of a sappy 80s movie as the romantic pairing are embraced and swaying to the song in a poorly lit gymnasium, they both are reluctant to part but know that it will one day happen.\n\nNotable tracks: Geyser, Old Friend, Remember My Name, Two Slow Dancers\n\n30. Hermit and the Recluse – Orpheus vs the Sirens: It’s difficult to pin down what exactly Ka’s discography is, the best description I’ve come up with is “historical hip hop”. With albums like The Night’s Gambit and Honor Killed the Samurai, there’s a pretty solid case to be made that Ka has carved out a niche by connecting notable warriors or myths of ancient civilizations to his own personal narrative. His latest effort, Orpheus vs the Sirens, is a collaborative effort with Los Angeles producer Animoss that takes on the legendary Greek musician Orpheus. Its modern day reimagining of one of Western Civilization’s most favorite sets of myth, all retold through Ka’s monotone, lower register. Ka’s one note vocals are the perfect match for Animoss’ lo-fi, retro, beats, both have big enough personality to make their presence known without upstaging the other. If you were ever the type to obsess over Greek myth in middle school (either by way of the Percy Jackson novels, or mid 2000s Angel Fire websites) then you’ll certainly enjoy this clever retelling of these timeless tales.\n\nNotable Tracks: Atlas, Hades, Oedipus\n\n29. Kids See Ghosts – KIDS SEE GHOSTS: Somehow Kids See Ghosts did not end up being the disaster I anticipated it being when it was announced. “Feel the Love” could not have been a better way to kick things off on this project. Pusha T over a muted, minimalist beat could not have been a better choice, especially in the wake of his incredible June (the release of DAYTONA and his GOAT dis track “The Story of Addidon”). Kanye’s ad-libs on “Feel the Love” might just be one of my favorite moments in music in 2018. The forceful, violent, and punchy nature of his “GAK. GAK GAK GAGAK,” is another instance of Kanye taking a prevalent trend in hip hop music (in this instance, rappers ad-libbing gun sounds on their tracks) and turning up to 11 to showcase exactly what you can do with a trend that so often gets derided by unimaginative oldheads. Kudi likewise feels like he’s gotten back to his roots, his singing has taken a major step forward, the humming/moaning tone in his voice doesn’t detract from the track like some of his more recent efforts. I’m so close to loving “Freeee (Ghost Town Pt. 2)” but man, I can’t stand the echoing “FREEEEEE” in the background after every line. In spite of that critique, I love the positive, self-affirmation vibe that this song establishes, especially in light of both artists’ mental health revelations. “Cudi Montage” feels like classic, College trilogy Kanye West, amazing sampling choices, poignant social commentary, and some solid wordplay to tie the song together. If you’re long time fans of Kudi and Kanye, you will find yourself loving Kids See Ghosts.\n\nNotable Tracks: Feel the Love, Fire, Kudi Montage\n\n28. Ephorize – cupcakKe: (NOTE: This album features sexually explicit content, like moreso than most albums I’ll be reviewing. If that’s not your thing, consider skipping this one, thanks!) No matter what I write about Ephorize, I will have not done it justice. To understand what I mean, you have to listen to this album and hear for yourself. All that being said, cupcakKe’s humor, her technical prowess as a rapper, and her mystique as a sentient, sexual, glitter bomb makes her one of the most intriguing rappers in the genre today. On the surface she’ll draw criticisms akin to being an Amy Schumer/Nicki Minaj hybrid (Insert Spongebob mocking meme with text that reads “ShE OnLy RaPs AbOuT HeR VaGiNa!”), to which if that’s your opinion of cupcakKe’s work, I don’t think you’re taking a good faith attempt to listen to her work. While there is plenty of sexually overt content on this project like “Duck Duck Goose” or the LGBT positive anthem “Crayons,” it’s presentation is uniquely in cupcakKe’s voice. Some of my favorite moments on this album are when cupcakKe takes herself to task, like on “Self Interview” as she answers the song’s core question: “Why the [expletive] do I do the things that I do?”. Ephorize is one of the most fun projects of the year, I would challenge you to give cupcakKe a chance to entertain you with this album.\n\nNotable tracks: Cartoons, Duck Duck Goose, Cinnamon Toast Crunch, Self Interview\n\n27. Mark Kozelek – Mark Kozelek: Most of what I have to say about this record is a repetition of my thoughts on Kozelek’s 2017 effort, the meandering and philosophical Common as Light and Love are Red Valleys of Blood. I continue to be impressed with Kozelek’s ability to make profound observations in his daily mundane activities. It takes a master of stream of consciousness storytelling to draw a thread from a dim sum lunch with a group of old women to a story about a Nazi occupied town, yet Kozelek pulls it off on the opening track “This is my Town”. For me, the essence of this album can be captured in a lyrical interaction between the songs “The Mark Kozelek Museum” and “Weed Whacker.” On the former, Kozelek has a pair of lines “And I’m on Spotify too, they tell me/My biggest song is ‘Chili Lemon Peanuts’”. It seems like yet another one of those throwaway lines that’s meant to just add texture to the overall album, at least until the track “Weed Whacker” when Kozelek retells a conversation with the following lyrics:\n\n“I said, ‘Yeah, who’s that in the background on the radio, rapping?’\n\nHe said, ‘They’re called Sun Kil Moon, the album is called\n\nCommon as Light and Love Are Red Valleys of Blood\n\nYou’ve probably never heard of them\n\nBy the way, it’s not the radio, it’s Spotify’\n\nAnd he said, ‘What’s wrong, you look like you’re going to cry’\n\nHe said, ‘What’s wrong, you look like you’re going to cry’”\n\nThe interaction between these sets of lyrics is so fascinating to me, it speaks to the complex emotions that Kozelek feels towards his fame, the nature of fame in a time where media is more widely accessible than ever (and more disposable as a byproduct), the conflict of pretending not to care about stuff like Spotify streams but the reaction described in “Weed Whacker” suggesting otherwise. There’s tons of awesome interactions like these on Mark Kozelek making for a rewarding repeat listen.\n\nNotable tracks: This Is My Town, The Mark Kozelek Museum, My Love For You Is Undying, Weed Whacker\n\n26. J. Cole – KOD: My opinion on Cole rubber bands back and forth probably more than with any other current rapper. Early Cole is forgettable, Forest Hills Drive is exceptional, the Black Friday collabs crushed it, and 4 Your Eyez Only had a handful of good tracks amongst a series of duds. All that being said, KOD once again demonstrates Cole’s ability to make insightful hip hop without validating the criticism of being too corny. At its core, KOD is an examination of how our interpersonal relationships get corrupted, specifically through our vices. For all of his desire for perfect, authentic relationships, Cole portrays himself as cynical throughout this album. He assumes the worst motivations of people in his life (on tracks like “Photograph” or “The Cut Off”), stemming largely from acknowledging that he can be motivated by his vices (as demonstrated by his wandering heart in “Kevin’s Heart”) and by past trauma (as told on one of my favorite J. Cole tracks “Once an Addict – Interlude”). Presenting all these songs wherein Cole questions the motives of everybody around him (including himself), it’s the making of a bleak tone that hangs over the entire album.\n\nNotable Tracks: The Cut Off, Kevin’s Heart, Once an Addict – Interlude, FRIENDS\n\n25. Vince Staples – FM!: As a person that has never liked the radio, it’s strange that Vince Staples has made me feel a sense of longing for a lionized vision of Kube 93.3 (a Seattle hip hop radio station if anybody from outside of Washington stumbles upon this write-up) that probably never existed. FM! is a tight, twenty-two minute EP that centers around the idea of your local radio station and its role in developing the cultural identity of the neighborhoods that pick up the broadcast. While tracks like “Outside” and “FUN!” are both excellent standalone tracks, I find that the best parts of this project are the wrinkles and details that help establish the illusion of tuning into a local radio station. Things like Big Boy’s Neighborhood checking in with some wacky radio contests, the cheesy mid-2000s DJ sound effects, the seamless mix from track to track, the snippets for new fake singles (side note: I NEED a full version of “New earlsweatshirt – interlude” stop messing with me Vince!), all of these little details help develop an atmosphere your morning radio mix. A lesser artist could have easily flubbed this idea, or could have said nothing really interesting through this creative choice, but Vince’s storytelling through the insidious “Feels Like Summer” (juxtaposing the happy summer vibe that a radio show aims to put out with the dangers of living in a bad neighborhood during the summer) and the forlorn closing track “Tweakin’” shows the well thought out concept and the execution that followed.\n\nNotable Tracks: Outside, Relay, FUN!\n\n24. Negro Swan – Blood Orange: “My eternal resolution will be to do too much” is the central theme that anchors Negro Swan. The refrain is introduced to the listener at the conclusion of the opening track “Orlando,” and much like the image that the album’s title calls to the listener’s mind, it’s an image that feels appropriate to that central idea. While the skits and spoken word portions of the album are focused on this idea of standing out, much of the album plays more comfortably as background music thanks to the soft, melodic atmosphere that is at play; it’s an interesting tension that’s at play through most of the project. Given the title, and the melancholy tone of many of the songs, I would assert the album speaks to the anxieties that many people of color experience simply by existing as a hyper visible body while also trying to blend in. The first time that it feels like Negro Swan breaks out of its shell is on the track “Charcoal Baby” directly after a short spoken word piece about the family you choose; the track pops with a flirtatious guitar riff, soothing synth chords, and of course Dev Hynes’ enchanting vocal performance. Like all of us, “Charcoal Baby” speaks to the desire that all of us have, to have a place to belong.\n\nNotable Tracks: Hope, Charcoal Baby, Out of Your League\n\n23. Historian – Lucy Dacus: There aren’t many stronger album starters this year than Lucy Dacus’s vocal and songwriting performance on “Night Shift”. The forlorn tone to her vocal performance, the ebbing and flowing of the lone guitar, the ever building repetition of “You’ve got a nine to five, so I’ll take the night shift” up to its finality when Dacus’s voice bursts with passion at every syllable. I’m a sucker for tragic love stories, and “Night Shift” is exemplary in the art. There’s plenty more than this lone single that I’m gushing over, “Addictions” feels like a companion piece to the opening track, suggesting that the untimely end to this relationship is not a clean break as you’d be lead to believe on the opening track. The lines “I’m just calling, cause I’m used to it. You’ll pick up, cause you’re not a quitter. You’ve got addictions too it’s true,” almost comes off as playful teasing to her former lover, as if she knows that he’s not capable of moving on either. Dacus’s songwriting is the selling point of Historian, second only to the skilled guitar plucking and smoky vocals you’ll find on tracks like “Addictions,” “Timefighter,” and “Pillar of Truth.”\n\nNotable Tracks: Night Shift, Additions, Timefighter\n\n22. Harutosyura – Haru Nemuri: Haru Nemuri’s music is evidence enough to me that great music is able to break down language barriers. As somebody who knows no Japanese (outside of a few meme phrases that are likely mistranslated anyways), I can at the very least identify what kinds of emotions are being portrayed across the rollercoaster ride of Haru Nemuri’s harutosyura. The track “narashite” illustrates this point the best, particularly the repetition of the line “Narashite/Ima sugu narashite”. This track’s already high energy tone erupts with Haru screaming these lyrics towards the songs end, her voice is full of frustration and words alone could not depict. Haru’s vocal performance is backed by a dynamic band that matches her energy on every track. I have looked for the names of the backing band for the last several months, only to not find an answer, but good lord they can play! Whoever is responsible for the simmering guitar chords the boils over into a wailing solo at the end of the track “harutosyura” or the plucky notes on “rock n roll wa shinanai with totsuzenshounen” deserves as much credit for the high intensity tone that these tracks maintain. Harutosyura makes every moment count, and front woman Haru Nemuri makes the project well worth several listens.\n\nNotable Tracks: MAKE MORE NOISE OF YOU, narashite, harutosyura, rock n roll wa shinanai with totsuzenshounen\n\n21. Brandi Carlile – By The Way, I Forgive You: In spite of it all, Brandi Carlile is somehow able to find it in her heart to forgive. The Washington native singer-songwriter pens songs that are packed with wisdom and perspective far beyond her years on By The Way, I Forgive You. The “you” is an ever changing subject from song to song, and Carlile does an exceptional job of applying this theme of compassion through anguish on the entire record. The most creative application of this is on the track “The Mother” a song dedicated to her daughter Evangeline. It’s a clever take on the story of parenthood wherein she forgives not only her daughter for transforming her life, but also herself for the self-martyrdom she saw motherhood being (I especially love the line “So they can keep their treasure and their ties to the machine/’Cause I’m the mother of Evangeline”). “Hold Out Your Hand,” is a breakout song on this record, I love the switch up between the rapid, muted verses and the explosive, elongated verse complete with that infectious chant! It would be a major oversight on my part to not at least mention the conflicted concluding track, “Party Of One” as she struggles to forgive the flawed person that she notes she’s still in love with after all these years. By The Way, I Forgive You affords its listeners a series of emotionally complex tracks that are worth unpacking time and time again.\n\nNotable Tracks: Hold Out Your Hand, The Mother, Sugartooth, Party Of One\n\n20. Pusha T – DAYTONA: What a year Pusha T had in 2018. In addition to proving that nobody is untouchable with “The Story of Adidon,” he released an exceptional hip hop record in DAYTONA. Kanye’s production is a match made in heaven with Pusha T’s voice and his flow. Both of their contributions make for a tone of confidence that makes it easy to latch onto several of the tracks here. I wouldn’t be surprised if in a few years time, the beat for “The Games We Play” will become one of those instrumentals that morning DJs will pick for rookie rappers to freestyle over. The Kanye praise on “The Games We Play” isn’t even to downplay Pusha T’s performance on the track, the meat of the lyrics is full of clever word play, innuendo and plenty of braggidacio lyricism that you can come to expect from a rapper with the kind of clout that Pusha has. The line that sticks with me the most in the project is from the first verse of “The Games We Play” “This ain’t a wave or phase, ’cause all that [expletive] fades/This lifestyle’s forever when you made”. I find that this pair of lines captures where Pusha T sees his career right now, he no longer has anything to prove, it’s time to make a legacy. Lucky for him DAYTONA is just another addition to an already impressive resume.\n\nNotable Tracks: If You Know You Know, The Games We Play, Infarred\n\n19. Saba – CARE FOR ME: Saba’s sophomore album, CARE FOR ME, is a heartfelt collection of diary-like confessionals surrounding his anxieties, vices, and several illuminating stories surrounding his relationship with his late cousin Walter. Saba’s staying power on this album lies in his ability to evoke a precise mood from track to track; it gives this project a multifaceted, raw, and genuine quality that I find myself coming back to time and time again. “LIFE” is the perfect example of what I mean; Saba opens the track composed with well written bars delivered over the sounds of a string bass from his backing band. As the song progresses, the instrumental builds, swapping the string bass for a louder, thumping bass line, and likewise, Saba’s delivery becomes more aggressive, his lyrics become more raw, as if he loses composure under the pressure of his survivor’s guilt; it’s a masterful blend of acting, audible queues, and writing to evoke a genuine response from the listener. “PROM/KING” serves as an emotional core to the project as Saba recounts his prom night experience, all to the tune of a nostalgic, haunting piano track. At first it feels relatable, full of awkward but universal experiences (IE: being rejected, feeling ashamed of one’s virginity, the ever looming embarrassment teens feel towards their parents), up until Saba gets jumped by his prom date’s older brother. The prom story is a prelude up to the songs inevitable conclusion, it shares the blossoming of Saba’s relationship with his cousin Walter, up until his untimely demise. CARE FOR ME plays like a home video mixed with a superhero’s origin story, and the leading man of that story is its superstar Saba.\n\nNotable Tracks: BROKEN GIRLS, LIFE, PROM/KING\n\n18. Quit the Curse – Anna Burch: Anna Burch continues the long-standing singer-songwriter tradition of singing about the one universal message: unrequited love at the hands of a former lover. While I joke about this road being well-tread, Anna Burch approaches the theme with a perspective that will likely remind you of her contemporaries (while not completely analogous, I keep thinking of Margaret Glaspy’s Emotions and Math), without losing any bit of authenticity. Throughout the project, Burch airs out the personal details of a relationship where both individuals have differing levels of investment. Lines like “You scare me with your indifference, I like you best, when you’re a mess,” on “2 Cool 2 Care,” or the verse on the song “Asking 4 a Freind,” in which Anna details feeling more vulnerable than her unnamed partner (in spite of the fact that he was the one that cried when they were high), or the lines on “What I Want” where she resolves to getting a new lover because her previous one has moved on and she wants to prove that she won’t “play the victim”. When all’s said and done, Anna Burch paints a picture of the petty and desperate people we are prone to becoming when we still have feelings for those who won’t reciprocate them in kind. The story she tells, while at times is a bit vague, it’s one the listener will have no trouble inserting themselves in, at least those who have ever found themselves on the losing side of a rejection.\n\nNotable Tracks: 2 Cool 2 Care, Asking 4 a Friend, Quit the Curse, Belle Isle\n\n17. (((echo chamber))) – MC Paul Barman: If you want to listen to lyrical, miracle rappers, very few did it as well as MC Paul Barman on (((echo chamber))). Most of the time, rhyming for the sake of showing off your ability to rhyme is so boring to me, but Barman transcends the egotistical, fake deep hobby and turns it into an admirable art form. To really get an idea of what I mean, I’d just recommend that you check out the first verse of the opening track “(((echo chamber)))”. Luckily, this isn’t just a 48 minute slog of heady rhyme schemes, there’s plenty of depth and humor to the tracks that makes for a rewarding album for those who stick with it. One of my favorites here is “Youngman speaks on (((race))),” wherein the narrator of the song gets mad about the fact that white people are only given one type of skin color. Barman goes on to take this silly set up and turn it into a thoughtful criticism of white people that would use the phrase “race baiting” whenever they read an article about Black Lives Matter. The flow on “(((happy holidays)))” is equal parts inventive and frustrating, the beat is a sample of that earworm of a Christmas song “Sleigh Ride”, and every time you anticipate Barman rap with a similar cadence to the song it’s inspired by, he breaks away from the expectation and uses a completely different flow. It plays off like one of those videos where a DJ trolls his audience with a long buildup, only to give them a fake drop. MC Paul Barman’s work on (((echo chamber))) is a unique, dense, inspired approach to hip hop that fans of lyricism will want to dig into.\n\nNotable Tracks: (((echo chamber))), Youngman Speaks on (((Race))), (((commandments))), (((happy holidays)))\n\n16. Judas Priest – FIREPOWER: Judas Priest is back? AND they sound like vintage Painkiller Judas Priest? Good lord this is a triumphant return for a group that many assumed would never return to form after K.K. Downing left the group in 2011. FIREPOWER is familiar without feeling tired; it’s aggressive without feeling sloppy. All in all, it’s a project that serves as an excellent introduction to the band, or as a nice reminder to old fans that they’ve still got it. We waste no time at all as Rob Halford kicks things off on the opening track “Firepower” with a patented wail into the mic that he’s done countless times throughout his fifty years as a musician! Dude’s 67 years old and he sounds like he hasn’t lost a step. Without missing a beat, the next track “Lightning Strike” keeps the momentum going, Scott Travis is relentless on the drums, Richie Faulkner rises to the occasion on the lead guitar, everybody brings their A-Game, making for a major highlight on the album. A Judas Priest album, especially one of this caliber, was one of the biggest surprises of the year for me, and I for one was blown away by the aftermath.\n\nNotable Tracks: Firepower, Lightning Strike, Traitor’s Gate\n\n15. Earl Sweatshirt – Some Rap Songs: Your favorite rapper’s favorite rapper is back after a multi-year hiatus with a surprise album at the end of the year. Some Rap Songs is a project that’s well worth the wait and a reflection of the circumstances with which it was released. Some Raps Songs comes out in the midst of Earl mourning his recently deceased father, as well as his uncle Hugh Masekela, in addition to all the internal baggage that you can expect on a traditional Earl Sweatshirt outing. All these anxieties blend together into a distinctly choppy and “dusty” sounding project (listen specifically to the song “Peanut” to see what I mean by dusty). Earl wanders from concept to concept, not staying on any one particular thread for too long, as if he’s just beginning to unpack and sort through his emotions for the listener. Traditional Earl fans might be frustrated with a project that has a heavier emphasis on the production (or they might be like me and just be happy that there’s new Earl), but this avant garde style felt like the natural next step for the artist that made I Don’t Like Shit, I Don’t Go Outside: An Album by Earl Sweatshirt. As if it were ever possible, we get an even more intimate look into Earl’s tortured mind for better or worse. While there is plenty to love on the front half of the record (“Cold Summers” feels like classic Earl, and that beat switch on “Ontheway!” is pretty magical), the heart and soul of the project are the final three songs, specifically where Earl surrenders the floor to his mother, father, and Uncle Hugh. Between the duet Earl made of his parents on “Playing Possum” and the track “Riot!” that samples his Uncle Hugh, it’s a cathartic tribute to figures that were clearly influential to Earl. And while he thinks he might never be good enough to carry on his legacy (as outlined in “Peanut” with the lines “Family saw you on that stage, left it not amazed”), the best he can do is revere them through his own artistic pursuits. While Some Rap Songs might not have the neat and tidy ending that one would hope for Earl (IE: The lyrics “Flushin’ through the pain, depression, this is not a phase”) I hear the album’s conclusion as a man who at least takes comfort in the shoulders of the giants that he stands on.\n\nNotable tracks: Cold Summers, Ontheway!, Playing Possum, Peanut, “Riot!”\n\n14. Eric Taxxon – The Killer: This album will without a doubt be the weirdest one I recommend on the list this year. Not necessarily because of the content (I actually find it to be pretty accessible as an ambient album on its face, save for “Cowardice” and “Hot Club Swing”). The Killer is the soundtrack/companion album for a YouTube video essay about a webcomic (reread that sentence, there’s no mistake there). Normally I wouldn’t recommend soundtracks, let alone one for a YouTube video essay, but the work that Taxxon put into this project is worth of any and all recognition. I’m amazed at how much content Taxxon is able to pack into an album that is little more than 30 minutes. Every track is layered and packed with more samples than I can reasonably keep track of, you’ll hear everything from video game sound effects, old-timey swing samples, some singing that I can only describe as Tiny Tim’s performance on “Living in the Sunlight,” sirens, synth chords in virtually every sound you can imagine, and of course the eerie whisperings of a madman threatening to harm somebody over videogames. Two highlight tracks for me are “Four Panels and Zero Words” and “Hareton’s Dream.” While they are completely separate, they both share a lot of the same qualities (the warm, exaggerated synth chords, a gradual build up to a major, emotional, payoff) that give them a tone of triumph. Fans of ambient synth music will have a fun time unpacking this one.\n\nNotable Tracks: Four Panels and Zero Words, Hareton’s Dream, Sonic\n\n13. Punken – Maxo Kream: One of the things I struggle with the most with the current wave in hip hop is a lack of authenticity that a lot of the younger wave seem to exhibit. This is in no way the case with an artist like Maxo Kream. His debut studio album Punken depicts the full picture living the life of a modern gangster using the most effective evidence at his disposal, his own personal testimony of growing up in the Houston slums. What I love most about this project is Maxo Kream lets his personal story do the talking, there are moments when he’s sympathetic, and others where you might find him frightening. The most comprehensive view we get of Maxo is on the second track of the album “Grannies”. Amidst the relentless, steady flow, Maxo recounts his flawed family and the terrible living conditions he grew up in, particularly on the hook:\n\n“Wake up in the morning, load my pistol, can’t leave home without it\n\nCome from where you see a lot of bodies, but don’t talk about it\n\nHard to find the plug, I middlemaned that package on consignment\n\nHookers, strippers, crackheads, robbers, trappers, all in public housin’\n\nUncle Bo was stealin’ from my Granny, can’t leave shit around here\n\nRoaches, rats, and ants inside my pantry, can’t leave food around here”\n\nIn spite of it all, Maxo ends the track with a line of gratitude “Grinding with my family through the struggle, hold ’em down regardless”. The decision to end “Janky” with an audio clip from a local news report on Maxo’s criminal history serves like a corroborating testimony, it lends an air of legitimacy to all the stories you hear in the project, and not just as standard rap braggadocio. While Punken wraps up with “5200 (Bonus),” I consider the real conclusion to this project to be “Roaches,” the melancholy piano is the perfect backdrop to Maxo’s recounting of how Hurricane Harvey impacted him and his family not but 4 months prior to the album’s release date. It brings to the fore a vulnerable family man who has deep ties to where he comes from, in spite of all the hardship that he displays throughout Punken (especially with the spoken word section that final reveals the true meaning behind the album’s title).\n\nNotable Tracks: Grannies, Capeesh, Janky, Roaches\n\n12. JID – Dicaprio 2: Since his distinct honor as the strongest rapper in this year’s XXL Freshman edition, hip hop fans have been waiting with baited breath for JID’s next move. Several months later JID answered with his 2nd studio album Dicaprio 2, a collection of thirteen (fourteen if you count the 50 second intro) tracks packed to the brim with bars and an eclectic selection of flows that makes for one of the most technically sound hip hop albums of 2018. I think of this project more like a highlight reel of JID’s talents than I do an album with a common thread from start to finish; which I’d say is perfect for an artist whose career is just getting started and needs to turn heads. The album kicks off with a bang with the content dense “Slick Talk”. There’s plenty to unpack on this track, but what stands out to me is the extended metaphor of JID’s relationship with rap and where he seems himself now, specifically in the “post-honeymoon phase” of the relationship. “Off Da Zoinkys” is another notable effort on this project, the steady building beat towards its chaotic finish works well with JID’s nasally delivery to sell this song as a desperate anti-substance plea. Meme name aside, “Despacito Too” is probably my favorite track on the album if only for the following series of lines\n\n“They saying, ‘What you wanna be J.I.D? What you wanna be kid?\n\nA doctor, a lawyer, exploring the coral reef shit?\n\nA football player, a track sprinter, I know you run fast\n\nOh you gon’ be a rapper with your dumbass’”\n\nI love JID’s point here, suggesting that these other careers are just as much of a pipe dream as the one he’s chosen, yet only one of them is ridiculed. All in all, Dicaprio 2 shows the clear talent and ability of one of the music industry’s rising stars.\n\nNotable tracks: Slick Talk, Off Deez, Off Da Zoinkys, Just Da Other Day, Despacito Too\n\n11. boygenius – boygenius: If there was a Marvel like team up of indie sadgirl singer/songwriters, it would likely look something like boygenius. “boygenius” isn’t so much an experimental triumph of three formidable musicians creating something unique, but rather the obvious showcase of why these three should have been working together much earlier. “Bite the Hand” serves as the signature punch in the gut that you can expect from a Baker or Dacus track, the echo of “I can’t love you how you want me to” plays us out at the end as the ultimate conclusion of a broken relationship, it’s haunting tone lingers with me, making up what I would say is one of my favorite moments in music from 2018. “Stay Down” is another entry in Baker’s series of songs about self-harm and boxing metaphors that I fall for as vulnerable but bold. To me, “boygenius” is at its best when group gives one another the opportunity to take front and center, while the others support by setting a backdrop that will allow their temporary lead to shine.\n\nNotable tracks: Bite the Hand, Stay Down, Ketchum, ID\n\n10. Dream Wife – Dream Wife: Dream Wife’s self-titled debut project is the latest in installment in the already storied female lead punk rock outfits. The cadence of Rakel Mjöll’s vocal delivery stands out to me the most in a casual listen, particularly on tracks where the same lyrics are retread throughout the track (like “Somebody” or on the dynamic “F.U.U.”), I find it engaging the different ways she adjusts the inflexion of her voice or the emphasis on specific syllables, while it’s a simple artistic decision, the group gets plenty of mileage out of this style. Alice Go on lead guitar offers a diverse array of sounds, she goes from sweet, subtle riffs on tracks like “Love Without Reason” to explosive anger on “F.U.U.”. Since I’ve already mentioned it twice, “F.U.U.” is simple in its idea, but damn is it a great track. People will knock the lyrics as simple, to which I would say when was the last time you were eloquent when you were experiencing unbridled rage? Dream Wife is a spectacular debut, the group knows what they do well and they stick to it.\n\nNotable Tracks: Somebody, Love Without Reason, F.U.U.\n\n9.New Levels New Devils – Polyphia: One of the most common critiques I find of instrumental groups like Polyphia is the lack of lyrics makes it hard to make a connection to the music beyond “I like how it sounds” (this critique is in no way exclusive to instrumental music, how many times have you heard an old head say “you wouldn’t like [flavor of the month rapper] if he didn’t have a hard beat”). I would challenge folks who have this critique for instrumental-centric music to defend this position against the rough, muddy sounds of Jimi Hendrix’s “Purple Haze” or the several triumphant guitar solos on Boston’s “Foreplay/Long Time”. Polyphia’s third studio album New Levels New Devils is a showcase of personality through instrumentation. The melodic, Spanish, influences on the opening guitar arrangement of the track “Death Note” sets the tone for a funky, yet fluid experience. “Rich Kids” is another highlight on this album, the track opens with this whining, spacey guitar chords, then we’re treated to a medley of timbre changes in the guitars’ sounds, you would think this would sound jarring, but Polyphia pulls this off in a way that makes it all blend together into one harmonious final product.\n\nNotable tracks: Nasty, Death Note, Rich Kids\n\n8. Superorganism – Superorganism: If the online collective of Superorganism is a glimpse into the future of music collaboration and the creative process in a digital age, then man am I stoked for what’s to come. For those unfamiliar, the latest indie darling started making music entirely online before they ever met one another in person. Their self-titled debut album is an exercise in bringing a hodgepodge of musical talents together to form a cohesive whole (some might say a superorganism of sorts! I’ll show myself out). Anything and everything is transformed into a musical instrument on this album, you’ll hear bird chirps, bubbles popping, a way too realistic horn honking, a tab cracking open a soda can (and the satisfactory sigh after the first sip shortly thereafter), and of course more traditional musical instruments a la synths, guitars and drums. Altogether, the cacophony comes together to make a fluid, almost lazy, experience that makes for the perfect summer album. The mash-up of sounds can feel a bit overwhelming at times, but Orono Noguchi’s monotone voice becomes quickly familiar and becomes a consistent ceterpiece that grounds the whole project. Superorganism is a whimsical, breezy project that always found its way into my rotation thanks the group’s natural chemistry.\n\nNotable Tracks: It’s All Good, Nobody Cares, Reflections on the Screen, Relax\n\n7. Tierra Whack – Whack World: 15 track, 15 minutes. That’s all Tierra Whack needs to win you over on her 2018 project Whack World, and she makes every second count. My main gripe with this project is so many of these tracks deserve a “full” version (which I would say is a testament to Tierra’s ability as an artist to captivate her audience from track to track). The brisk pace of this record is a nice change of pace in the current streaming landscape where artists release bloated albums that lack any cohesion and just see what sticks. Given the album’s gimmick, I think of this project as Tierra’s highlight reel as she showcases the many different she’s capable of performing, including traditional R&B, contemporary trap, including some kooky sounding tracks that I could only describe as electronic country (I’m not entirely sure, just listen to “Fuck Off” and tell me if you have a more appropriate descriptor than what I came up with). This project is charming, brisk, and serves as the perfect introduction to an artist that I’m sure will be wowing us for years to come.\n\nNotable tracks: Black Nails, 4 Wings, Pretty Ugly\n\n6. St. Paul and the Broken Bones – Young Sick Camellia: While on the press tour for Young Sick Camellia, Paul Janeway, lead singer of St. Paul and the Broken Bones, described himself as “I’ve always felt like a little broken Southerner” in reference to his love for his upbringing. If I were to condense the ideas of this funky, soulful project into one statement, that’s about as good as you’re going to get. Everything from the frail, withered camellia (Alabama’s state flower) on the album cover, the band’s clearly southern influence, and not to mention the lyrics throughout the album, all contribute towards this conflict of loving something that exists in conflict with your personal values. Janeway’s vocal performance has a personality befit a Baptist preacher, his voice bursts on every track as he pleads with the listener to heed his message. “GotItBad” is a stand out song that brings all these characteristics together into a concise, earnest message, wrapped in charming presentation that you can expect from St. Paul and the Broken Bones. Even the concluding track “Bruised Fruit” where Janeway take a holistic view of his heritage in a stripped back, near silent moment, his voice is still packed with power that envelops the listener, it’s a touching performance as he confronts this conflict head on.\n\nNotable Tracks: GotItBad, Apollo, Bruised Fruit\n\n5. Mick Jenkins – Pieces of a Man: The poet turned rapper pays homage to Gil-Scott Heron on his second studio album Pieces of a Man (a title he borrows from one of Heron’s albums). The comparisons are apparent from the opening track “Heron Flow” as Jenkins re-writes Heron’s “The Ghetto Code” to make himself the speaker and derive his own meaning from the idea of “dot dot dit dit dot dot dash” aka “The Remorse Code” aka “Damned if I know”. Comparing Heron and Jenkins is appropriate, the use of jazz production, speaking truth to power and the importance of knowledge have always been prevalent themes in Jenkins’ work, and I think that Pieces of a Man is a touching tribute to Heron’s legacy and not a cynical cash grab. For specific tracks, “Reginald” is about as classic as it gets for Jenkins, a classic jazz beat, sophisticated word play, and an unparalleled flow to tie the track together, the same can be said for “Understood”. After many were disappointed Jenkins’ debut studio album (NOTE: I am NOT one of those people), I would be shocked if those doubters didn’t dub Pieces of a Man as a return to form thanks to Jenkins’ pen and his artistic vision.\n\nNotable Tracks: Heron Flow, Stress Fracture, Reginald, Pull Up, Understood\n\n4. Room 25 – Noname: There are fewer voices in music that I find more genuine than Fatimah Nyeema Warner, better known by her stage name Noname. I was quick to fall in love with her brilliant 2016 mixtape Telefone, a coming of age tale about Warner’s growth, insecurities, and early life in Chicago, all to the backdrop of stringed instruments and doo-wop type beats. Room 25 is the natural extension of Warner’s previous work, although this time she brings a bit more sass and wit, allowing for a more three-dimensional view of the soft spoken emcee. The opening track “Self” serves as a sort of thesis to the project as Warner floats all the different ideas of what the album could be. Her line “Y’all really thought a [expletive] couldn’t rap huh?” is one of my favorites of the year, Warner’s delivery with a slight chuckle, the smooth way she speaks this line, it’s packed full of sass that you could almost feel her making a sideways glance as she speaks. There’s a laundry list of spectacular lines throughout this project like the gut check towards her former lover, “You wanna nasty [expletive] psychiatrist that cooks like ya mamma” on “Window” or the bait-and-switch line “I’m just writing my darkest secrets/like ‘wait and just hear me out’/saying ‘vegan food is delicious’/like ‘wait and just hear me out’” on “Ace”. Noname grapples with tough questions throughout this album that don’t necessarily have an answer, like the lack of useful solutions in inner city communities on “Prayer Song” or the fleeting love that fame brings on the track “Don’t Forget About Me”. Warner brings her scars to bare on Room 25, and we’re all better people for the opportunity to hear her story.\n\nNotable Tracks: Blaxploitation, Prayer Song, Window, Ace\n\n3. TA13OO – Denzel Curry: The rapper of “Ultimate” meme fame has always struck me as the most impressive from the crop of Miami rappers. I’ve always thought of him as the most polished product from the area without giving up the aggressive vocal quality/flows that’s characteristic of the scene. It feels as though Denzel Curry finally came through and delivered a complete studio project with TA13OO. There was no doubt that there would be a handful of monstrous bangers that have become a sort of calling card for Curry at this point in his career, I was much more impressed by the more melodic, restrained tracks. I find myself coming back to “BLACK BALLOONS | 13LACK 13ALLOONZ” more often than any other track on this album, it’s feel good, clean baseline and generally breezy production makes for an infectious beat. While the track has some serious summer vibes, it’s far from a generic top 40 hit as Curry thinks about the pain in his life through the vehicle of the titular black balloons in his life. “MAD I GOT IT | MAD 1 GOT 1T” is another highlight on this project, it has a dreary yet simple beat that pairs fantastically with the paranoid lyrics, this track feels a perfected version of the sad boy rap that a lot of the current up and coming rappers are experimenting with (a la Lil Xan, Lil Peep, etc). While I’ve spent most of my time lauding artistically divergent tracks on this album, that’s not to say that the more classic Curry tracks didn’t deliver (fans of Curry’s work will love “SUMO | ZUMO,” “SUPER SAIYAN SUPERMAN | ZUPER ZA1YAN ZUPERMAN,” and every other hype track on this album, they’re fantastic). It’s safe to say that Denzel Curry made a huge step forward with “TA13OO,” by expanding his toolbox of styles and production choices.\n\nNotable Tracks: BLACK BALLOONS | 13LACK 13ALLOONZ, MAD I GOT IT | MAD 1 GOT 1T, VENGEANCE | VENGEANCE, BLACK METAL TERRORIST | 13 M T\n\n2. Charli XCX – Pop 2: (NOTE: Pop 2 was released in 2017, since it was a December release it was not considered for my 2017 list, hence its inclusion here). I was surprised that I liked this release as much as I do. Pop 2 is a collection of boundary pushing electro-pop tracks that have adopted an almost “prog-pop” nature, by which I mean each track isn’t quite content with staying in one place for the course of a 3:00 minute track. Rather, with most songs on Pop 2, you’ll find that once a core beat concept has been established, it evolves multiple times throughout the rest of the song to keep it feeling fresh. “Backseat” and “Out Of My Head” serve as the perfect opening pair of tracks to this project. They’re both airy, playful builds towards a larger payoff that you might find on say an early 2010 Katy Perry or Ke$ha project, both are familiar enough to help the listener ease into the back half of the project. I’m a huge fan of “I Got It” as a hype track, the progression of the beat on this track gives lends to a sense of uncontrollable rambunctiousness Charli and her featured artists all lend to selling, cupcaKKe especially goes berserk on her verse here. “Track 10” is an amazing way to cap this project off, it’s progressive beat, Charli’s conflicting tones of voice throughout the song, the simulated choir that comes in towards the 3:00 minute mark of the track, the whole package comes off as a triumphant capstone that ties the rest of the album together. I’m of the opinion that few people are doing what Charli XCX is doing right now in any genre of music, her willingness to borrow from other genres, the prog-pop beats that she chooses on all of her tracks, and her overall vision for a song, all makes Pop 2 an exceptional experimental pop project.\n\nNotable tracks: Backseat, Out Of My Head, I Got It, Track 10\n\n1. Veteran – JPEGMAFIA: As I come up with these lists, I always want to make sure that the number one spot is held by the album that most appropriately captures the mood of the year. Which one found itself in my rotation so often because it just felt appropriate anytime I opened Spotify? I cannot think of a better answer to that question than JPEGMAFIA’s Veteran. It’s a cornered animal that has no other options than to lash out at anything it can sink its claws into, it’s chaos incarnate that wants to make sure you know exactly why it hates everything in arms reach, including the listener, all while making you laugh along the way. “Real Nega” is the perfect example of this style in action, the relentless, yet focused percussion is only the second most overwhelming sound on this beat, next to the operatic vocal sampling of ODB’s voice (as a note, if you listen to anything from this album, it NEEDS to be “Real Nega”). The song’s beat sets the perfect tone for JPEGMAFIA’s violent flow and fearless lyrical content. Fair warning to new listeners to this project, this music can be uncomfortable, in one listen you’ll feel threatened, offended, angry, and hopefully you’ll laugh with Peggy when he makes a dig at something you find objectionable.\n\nTo me, Veteran is a uniquely “internet” album. It takes the digital “leftovers” of soundbites that practically litter YouTube and Soundcloud at this point and crashes them all together into these beautiful abominations of sound, repeat listens reward after you start to piece together each sound’s origin (my personal favorite that I found was the sound of a Super Saiyan’s energy field on “Rainbow Six”). You’ll find there’s a lot of doing stuff for the sake of being able to on this album, which to me feels unique to modern internet culture (coming from a guy who finds this funny). The nihilistic nature of this album further lends to this feeling, as many young people that devote themselves to online culture continue to find themselves devoid of purpose. I love this album, it’s provocative, it’s challenging, and it’s a musical roller coaster that everybody should attempt to ride at least once.\n\nNotable Tracks: Real Nega, Baby I’m Bleeding, Rainbow Six, 1488, Curb Stomp\n\n40. The Booty Tape – Ugly God – The Booty Tape cracks the top 40 based moreso on Ugly God’s potential than the actual quality of the project. I think Ugly God is a genuine character in hip hop, he’s funny, personable, and every so often proves to listeners that he has plenty of musical talent. Tracks like “Welcome To The Booty Tape” and “F*ck Ugly God” are perfect examples of Ugly God’s ability to laugh at himself but still make a fun track to listen to. My overly optimistic trajectory for Ugly God is to see him surround himself with talented individuals that will help develop further as a rapping talent without sacrificing the humor that comes so naturally on some of his music. If he is able to find the right people to mentor his development, I could see Ugly God fitting into a similar lane as Danny Brown.\n\nNotable tracks: Welcome To The Booty Tape, F*ck Ugly God, Water\n\n39. Good for You – Aminé – While dark, dreary pop has been in vogue in 2017, Aminé’s Good for You is a breath of fresh air. It’s bright, easy going and playful, something that we can all use more of to break up the steady stream of bad news and uncertainty. There is plenty of variety in this album’s production. The opening track “Veggies” has a gorgeous string arrangement, followed up by a simple, but pleasant guitar playing in the background. “Hero” features a goofy intro of several people mispronouncing Aminé, it has a bit of a high school teen movie feel to it, before the track itself kicks off into a breezy little guitar riff. Other tracks like “Sundays” and “Turf” help vary the tempo, so as to avoid making this project a one trick pony. I will say that Good for You does overstay it’s welcome near the end, “Turf” feels like a natural conclusion (despite the track listing have six tracks after the fact), but this might just be an issue with the ordering of the songs rather than a shortcoming on Aminé’s part. All things considered, Good for You is fun, and I think everybody can use a bit more fun in their lives these days.\n\nNotable tracks: Veggies, Hero, Sundays, Dakota\n\n38. Same Sky – James Linsey – For an artist plays so well to poppy, light, beats (think Amine), the content of Linsey’s music can be pretty heavy. For example, “Rainbows” is all about how easy it is to fall into the prison pipeline as a black man in America, but it’s presented with this bright, groovy, beat. It can feel a little tonedeaf. Tracks like “Spotlight” are where Linsey really shines, it’s flirty, energetic, and I’m always a sucker for vinyl store hunting. Same Sky is a complex debut that serves as more of a showcase for Linsey’s many musical talents rather than an album with a unified theme.\n\nNotable Tracks: Wanna Shine?, Rainbows, Apples to Oranges\n\n37. 2016 Discography – VELVETEARS – The mellow vibes of Discography 2016 are the perfect companion for a dreary day inside while huddling underneath a cozy blanket. It’s a collection of minimalist indie-rock/electronic tracks that feel moody that are all tied together by VELVETEARS’ sullen vocals. I can’t say much more concerning this album unfortunately (which I definitely hate to do, especially for a year-end list), but this was the kind of album that served as a default backdrop to a lot of my year. The blend of basic, electronic production and lingering guitar notes was widely applicable throughout 2017.\n\nNotable tracks: Share The Throne, Will I Ever Care, Cry to This, Hands Around My Neck\n\n36. You’re Not As _____ As You Think – Sorority Noise – In the wake of losing several close friends to drug overdose and suicide, Sorority Noise’s frontman Cameron Boucher contributed to the release of two EPs that encapsulated where he was in his grieving process, one was a numb, exhausted collection of tracks (It Kindly Stopped for Me), the other an explosion of rage with punchy instrumentation (Slow Burn). Sorority Noise returned with a year of reflection under their belt and met in the middle and came up with You’re Not As _____ As You Think. This project is a return to form for the emo rock, it’s a more substantial, mature, take on what is often looked at as a vapid genre. You’re Not As _____ As You Think explores the wide range of emotions that comes with the dark periods of our lives, all while backed by killer duets of guitars and worthwhile musical payoffs on slow building tracks. The track “A Better Sun” is the perfect portrayal of feeling emotionally sapped after a lengthy hardship with the repetition of the line “This is the part where [insert activity/feeling here]” delivered by a dejected Boucher. “Second Letter From St. Julien” feels like the album’s ultimate redemption track as Cameron wrestles with the existence of a higher power, and while he doesn’t come to a tidy conclusion, he does come to a reassuring conclusion of what he hopes for that higher power.\n\nNotable tracks: No Halo, A Better Sun, Where Are You? Second Letter From St. Julien\n\n35. 32 – T.Y.E – The opera-singer-in-training turned rapper brings an awesome perspective to hip hop. Much like Anderson .Paak, T.Y.E blends training in a traditional music form with a genre that is still defining itself with every passing year. Opera influences are plain as day on 32, every single track is a larger than life, grandiose, and full of character, and that’s not even taking into account T.Y.E’s vocal performance. His voice is dripping with whatever emotion he is hoping to portray on any given track, whether he’s being arrogant on “Universe” or becoming a living embodiment of anxiety on the second half of “A*shole” the emotional range that T.Y.E brings to this album is nothing short of impressive. The listener is invited to be subject to a 40 minute panic attack in the mind of T.Y.E as he pushes himself to the brink over the one thing that he lives for: The pursuit of happiness.\n\nNotable tracks: Universe, A*shole, Aliens & Ufos, Unusual\n\n34. The Iceberg – Oddisee – Oddisee’s experience in rapping and producing allows for a tightly controlled project. While there is the risk of “tunnel visioning” on a sound (if that makes any sense) by keeping the group of collaborators small, it doesn’t seem like that happened on The Iceberg. While you can definitely identify musical fingerprint with a common thread throughout The Iceberg, the production isn’t all one note. “Digging Deep” is a great jumping off point for the project, it eases you in with suave horns, a solid rap about working hard, and a general fun vibe to start everything off on the right note. But the real meat of this album is when Oddisee uses his talent to discuss interesting social issues that are relevant to our current cultural moment. “Hold It Back” discusses the unique position Oddisee finds himself in as a person with a platform and the responsibility that comes with that platform. “You Grew Up” is a heartbreaking series of stories about how hatred breeds in our hearts, particularly from the perspective of young children that get taken advantage of towards nefarious ends. Oddisee is thoughtful in his presentation, and it helps that it’s catchy as hell.\n\nNotable tracks: Hold It Back, You Grew Up, Rights & Wrongs\n\n33. Rap Album Two – Jonwayne – Rap Album Two is an authentic return to music after Jonwayne’s brief hiatus. It’s self-aware, it’s observant, it’s well-written. The opening track, “TED Talk,” is as good of an introduction to an album as I’ve heard all year, it’s packed with witty bars like “I never forget like elephants on 4chan,” or “Kissing that cross, now they kissing my crosshairs/When I rap on beats that sound like a video game boss lair – [expletive]”. “LIVE From The [expletive] You” is a clever statement track about how annoyed Jonwayne gets by people that use his him for his fame, told in an annoyed tone to an ignorant fan. There’s an insightful moment on this album on “The Single” that feels like we’re witnessing Jonwayne’s breaking point that caused him to take his hiatus as he struggles to make what is supposed to be a hit single for an upcoming album, it’s heartbreaking and vulnerable in a way that any artist can relate to. The extended metaphor on “Paper” wherein Jonwayne compares himself and his legacy to a tree is a moving excerpt of songwriting that I can’t help but share whenever I talk about Rap Album Two. He writes: “When I die, I wanna grow into a tree/I want ’em to bury me/Mixed in with soil and leaves/And when I’m stretched ‘cross the land/And your son cuts me down/I wanna be the book your grandchildren read aloud/With the tape on my spine/I’m still proud/I want ’em to hand me down/And give me to Goodwill/And price me for a dollar/Still get shoplifted, hell/Torn open just to give a man shelter, shit/That’s the world of my wishes/This paper my motivation”. Jonwayne shares with his listener the portrait of an imperfect artist, and anybody who joins him on that journey will find an endearing message by the end.\n\nNotable tracks: TED Talk, LIVE From The [Expletive] You, Paper, These Words are Everything\n\n32. Villains – Queens of the Stone Age – It’s difficult to identify a more successful run of hit records in modern rock than that of Queens of the Stone Age. Given their masterful contributions to the genre like Songs for the Deaf and …Like Clockwork, I had high hopes for Villains. While it doesn’t quite live up to their previous efforts, I think there’s a lot to enjoy here. “Feet Don’t Fail Me Now” starts the album off with a bang, featuring what I can only describe as “restless leg syndrome as a guitar riff,” every time I come back to it, I’m tempted to move with the track. “The Way you Used to Do” keeps the ball rolling with a track that starts high and insists on going higher, the guitar riffs here are hyper and complimented by a chaotic, up tempo, drum beat. Josh Hommes is at his best vocally on “Head Like a Haunted House” wherein he channels his inner coked-up Elvis for a rambunctious listening experience. My personal favorite on this record is the down tempo, yet still heavy “Un-Reborn Again,” the track feels full, every piece of instrumentation plays well with one another (the synths alternating with those awesome power chords, the dueling guitars during the chorus and at the end of the track, Josh’s vocals being complimented by his backup on the chorus, the seamless transition from guitars to violins and back again, it’s truly a masterful blend). In spite of some of the albums forgettable tracks (a la “Hideaway” and “Domesticated Animals”), I think there are some real gems here that will feel right at home with the rest of Queens of the Stone Age’s discography.\n\nNotable tracks: Feet Don’t Fail Me Now, The Way you Used to Do, Head Like a Haunted House, Un-Reborn Again\n\n31. Melodrama – Lorde – When Lorde burst onto the scene with “Royals” (and the accompanying album Pure Heroine), I found her to be talented, but a bit too one note for my taste (fairly shallow lyrics, and most of the album had the same basic sounding instrumentals). All that being said, Melodrama was exactly what the New Zealand artist needed to win me over. The opening three tracks, “Green Light,” “Sober,” and “Homemade Dynamite,” is one of the best runs of tracks to be released this year, they do a lot to sell to me that Lorde has made efforts to expand her sonic palette beyond the sound she explored thoroughly on Pure Heroine. Lorde feels like she’s having more fun on this album and she wants the listener to have fun with her, most notably, “Writer In The Dark”. The refrain on this song “Bet you rue the day you kissed a writer in the dark” is such a spiteful, yet fun image, and she gets plenty of mileage on this joke thanks to the unhinged tone in her voice on lines like “Now she’s gonna play and sing and lock you in her heart”. “Perfect Places” wraps the entire project up in a peppy conclusion, encouraging you to find your perfect place in the midst of all the crap that imperfect moments that we live in. Lorde came into her own on this project by letting down her guard and embracing her imperfections.\n\nNotable Tracks: Green Light, Homemade Dynamite, Writer In The Dark, Perfect Places\n\n30. Big Fish Theory – Vince Staples – In the weeks leading up to the release of Big Fish Theory, Vince gave us the following quote to describe the album’s sound: “All I can tell you is that it’s current. It’s tomorrow…We making future music. It’s Afrofuturism. This is my Afro-futurism. There’s no other kind.” A couple days after this quote, he would go onto the Daily Show and basically tell Trevor Noah he made up that description to mess with white people. But after reading up a bit on Afrofuturism, I feel like there is something to this playful quip (or maybe I’m just taking the bait, who’s to say?). The heavy dose of EDM and industrial production elements makes me think of clipping’s Splendor & Misery or Kanye’s Yeezus (without the lack of focus that was prevalent on Yeezus); it’s an interesting new direction that Vince explores without alienating listeners of his earlier work. “Alyssa Interlude” is another entry in an already impressive collection of mysterious, downer tracks that Vince has produced (a la “Smile” and “Summertime”), this one contemplating lost loved ones with a somber beat that sounds like rain pattering against a windshield, complete with wiper blades swishing back and forth. “Yeah Right” is an eerie, noisy, industrial sounding track in which Vince questions the authenticity of modern culture and some of his contemporaries in hip hop, the Kendrick feature helps bring this already great track to a whole other level. “Homage” serves as a sort of sales pitch to award committees with lyrics like “Outrun my gun, I’m the big shot now/Prima Donna had them like ‘wow!’/Hitchcock of my modern day/Where the [expletive] is my VMA?/Where the [expletive] is my Grammy?” suggesting that he’s underappreciated outside of his fan base and genre critics. “I am too cultured and too ghetto,” is another line off this track that I feel really captures Vince’s place in the greater music landscape. He finds himself caught between two worlds, not quite fitting in either, too cultured to have street cred, but his music is looked down upon by gatekeepers.\n\nNotable Tracks: Big Fish, Alyssa Interlude, Yeah Right, Homage, Rain Come Down\n\n29. Dead Reflection – Silverstein – Silverstein entered the music landscape in the height of emo/post-hardcore’s popularity as a genre. While many much bigger acts from that period have since called it quits or transformed their sound beyond recognition, the Canadian-based post-hardcore outfit continues to churn out quality music without sacrificing the band’s personality. I credit the group’s longevity to the band’s ability to create compelling concept albums that lends their music to multiple listens. On their 9th studio album, the band opted out of telling a traditional narrative in favor of a series of tracks that all surround a common thematic element. Between his passionate singing and violent screaming, Shane Told’s performance serves as an emotional anchor on Dead Reflection. The front half of the record is loaded with plenty of heavy, scream laden, intense tracks that old fans will have come to expect from the group (tracks like the chaotic opener “Last Looks” or the explosive second half of “Ghost”), but the most interesting song to me has to be “Lost Positives”. It’s common for Silverstein to either maintain a high intensity track, or build a slow burning song into an bursting, emotional climax, not quite the case with “Lost Positives”. This track takes ebbs and flows between reflective, calm, verses, and colossal guitar riffs, it’s a surprising new trick that the band hasn’t used too much on their previous work. While it might be difficult to believe, Dead Reflection is an album about hope, and overcoming yourself in spite of bleak circumstances, if you’re able to stomach the abrasive tone that post-hardcore music can often take on, I think you’ll be pleasantly surprised by Silverstein’s hopeful message.\n\nNotable tracks: Lost Positives, Ghost, Secret’s Safe, Wake Up\n\n28. Queue: The Mixtape – The Stoop Kids – Queue: The Mixtape sounds more like a golden oldies greatest hits from a collection of artists rather than one band. On this project, we have 10 tracks, all of which sound like they’re coming from a different period in American popular music. In the course of about thirty minutes, you will hear downtempo disco/funk (on the track “Motions”), funky surfer music (on the track “Curious Man”), and heavily distorted contemporary RnB (on the track “Better Left Unsaid”). The Stoop Kids are a blast to listen to on this project, their refusal to nail down a distinct sound allows the group to explore what works for them, and I think the gamble ultimately pays off. The group is having fun experimenting with a wide range genres and that’s plain enough for anybody that listens to the project. If you’re in the mood for a genre chameleon from start to finish, look no further than Queue: The Mixtape.\n\nNotable tracks: Motions, Curious Man, Better Left Unsaid\n\n27. Drunk – Thundercat – There aren’t too many people that are capable of singing about bedtime routines, hatred for social media, love for anime, the friendzone, and everything in between without creating a tone deaf mess of an album. Lucky for us, Thundercat is no ordinary musician, his goofy personality, electro-jazz style, and the respect he garners from talented musicians new and old allowed him to create a zany and surreal contemporary jazz experience on Drunk. The culmination of contributions from Flying Lotus, Kenny Loggins, Kendrick Lamar, and Pharrell gives this album one of the most distinct footprints of any 2017 release. On one track the suppressed, muffled, production will give you the feeling of being submerged within the beat; on the next you’ll feel like you’re floating over a peppy, ethereal track. All in all, you’re getting into a pleasant and diverse listening experience. I haven’t even gotten into Thundercat’s goofy lyrics. When you hear these lyrics paired with the world class music put forth on this project, it just adds to the hilarity of the whole affair. Looking specifically at “Friend Zone,” it’s a funky, psychedelic, track as Thundercat’s tenor delivery addresses a woman that he’s purposefully avoiding so he can play video games. Drunk is an enjoyable listen from start to finish, and Thundercat’s humor bleeds through his lyrics.\n\nNotable tracks: Captain Stupido, A Fan’s Mail (Tron Song Suite II), Tokyo, Friend Zone\n\n26. Trap Ketchum – Shofu – Shofu is a competitive Pokemon player who has dabbled in rapping as a hobby, and finally released a proper mixtape, Trap Ketchum. I’ll be honest, it’s a pet favorite of mine for this year; but to say that this is just a gimmick Pokemon mixtape would be underselling Shofu’s natural talent for rapping. It has a VERY specific audience in mind, but if you’re in that audience, boy will you enjoy it. For example, trying to explain the backstory behind “Verlisify” would be like trying to explain the Drake, Meek Mill beef to a hip hop outsider. The classic 90s gameboy inspired beats are fun without overstaying their welcome, Shofu’s aggressive delivery (for example on “Woke Up in Pallet Town”) and creative flows make this project a fun trip, especially if you can pick up on all the Pokemon reference that are littered throughout the project. Several of his collaborators bring their A-Game as well (most notably Pe$o Pete). Even non-fans can at least recognize that Shofu at plenty of talent to make a name for himself as a rapper (as he puts it on “Hurry Along” “They prolly hatin’ because I rap about Pokemon better than they rap about anything.”).\n\nNotable Tracks: Woke Up in Pallet Town, Splash, I Don’t Understand, Kami Clouds, The Goons!\n\n25. The Underside of Power – Algiers – The Atlanta quartet, Algiers brings the heat in their sophomore effort The Underside of Power, it’s a riotous call for revolution in the plainest of language possible. The group blends elements of punk, gospel, hard rock, industrial, and blues music to make the soundtrack of the oppressed. Front man Franklin James Fischer infuses every performance on this album with anguish, frustration, and hope, which helps sell this album’s righteous anger. The opening track “Walk Like a Panther” helps set the tone for the rest of the album, it’s a relentless, explosive snapshot of what you can expect from the rest of the project. While much of The Underside of Power might feel like a fire and brimstone sermon, there are plenty of moments of redemption to be found throughout the album. The title track “The Underside of Power” feels like a moment of triumph as Fischer delivers a sermon-like pep talk to his listeners, as he says the the underside of power “[is] just a game that can’t go on”. Algiers has a unified direction, and that is never more evident than the symbiotic relationship between Franklin James Fischer and his band on The Underside of Power.\n\nNotable tracks: Walk Like a Panther, The Underside of Power, Animals\n\n24. Brick Body Kids Still Day Dream – Open Mike Eagle – On a typical Open Mike Eagle album, Mike often keeps his audience at arm’s length, typically opting to share his feelings through observational comedy and humorous songwriting. Brick Body Kids Still Daydream, drops the emotional distance in favor of sharing the personal experience of Open Mike Eagle losing his childhood home, the Robert Taylor Homes in Chicago. Beneath these wobbly, eccentric beats, there are heavy feelings of nostalgia and displacement throughout the entire project, as if Mike’s childhood officially ended with the destruction of these public housing projects. “(How Could Anybody) Feel at Home” serves as a sort of TL;DR for the whole project, as Mike ponders what “home” really means for him, especially for the nomadic lifestyle he leads as a musician. “95 Radios” is Open Mike Eagle at his most personal as he recounts the first time he heard rap music on the radio in the lines “And the homies said they heard a rap song/Sounded like some folks they know”. It’s a revealing, personal track that gives the listener a look into how Mike got interested in hip hop music in the first place. Brick Body Kids Still Daydream focuses on the subtle moments of life, and relationships that gradually drift apart rather a violent end in one traumatic event.\n\nNotable tracks: (How Could Anybody) Feel at Home, Tldr (Smithing), 95 Radios, My Auntie’s Building\n\n23. CTRL – SZA – SZA’s long awaited debut album has finally dropped and I have to say, it was well worth the wait. After falling in love with her sensual voice on songs like “Childs Play” and “Warm Winds” I would spend the next couple years waiting for a proper debut album. What we would ultimately get is CTRL, a heartfelt yet blunt collection of tracks that explore SZA’s experiences with love, betrayal, and honesty. There’s a unique blend of elements from neosoul, RnB, and indie rock present on this record, it makes for a pleasant listening experience that is universally accessible. “Supermodel” kicks things off with a stellar vocal performance from SZA as she recounts betrayal in an intimate relationship over a somber electric guitar riff. The abundant moments of reflection add an element of authenticity SZA’s music, whether she’s talking about her immaturity in previous relationships on the disco-pop track “Prom,” or her emotional insecurity on “Drew Barrymore”. “20 Something,” the album’s final track, is a perfect conclusion. After learning all we have about SZA’s life throughout the project, she concludes that she is far from where she thought she would be at this point in her life. The lyrics “How could it be? 20 something/All alone still, not a thing in my name/Ain’t got nothin’, runnin’ from love/Only know fear,” wraps up all of SZA’s fears into a concise, existential, conclusion that many people (myself included) can relate to. SZA’s mother at the end of the track thankfully provides message of hope to those of us that feel similar dread about our lives, so as to leave the listener with a feeling of hope in spite of their shortcomings.\n\nNotable tracks: Supermodel, Prom, Pretty Little Bird, 20 Something\n\n22. Turn Out the Lights – Julien Baker – Julien Baker is one of the more unique voices to have come out in the past couple of years. A gay, Christian, singer-songwriter hailing from the south is probably one of the bigger contradictions you’ll hear about this year. Her sophomore album Turn Out the Lights is a showcase of polished, singer-songwriter fundamentals with worship music influences. Baker’s exploration of her crippling depression and suicidal thoughts is a haunting, yet moving experience. “Shadowboxing” is the painful telling of Baker describing how nobody can truly help her cope with her mental illness, since she’s the only one who understands the full scope. The contemporary worship music influence is plain enough on the song “Sour Breath,” a song about trying to maintain a relationship between two broken people, with the building instrumental on the repeated line “The harder I swim, the faster I sink.” Julien Baker’s newest efforts are a personal endeavor as she invites you into her mind, and I think that’s beautiful.\n\nNotable Tracks: Shadowboxing, Televangelist, Hurt Less\n\n21. How to be Human – The Classic Crime – It is nearly impossible for me to grade this album fairly. I will say from the outset that How to be Human is far from The Classic Crime’s best work (I’d give that distinction to their 2012 album Phoenix). But nevertheless, this band is an old favorite that I have listened to for almost ten years now, so providing a fair assessment will prove tough. All that being said, I think this is Matt Macdonald’s strongest performances as a lyricist. Tracks like “Not Done With You Yet” and “Driftwood” are about human imperfection and finding redemption in spite of those shortcomings. Often times the band falls back on safe musical motifs that worked on previous albums (“Shades of Green” features an interlude towards the end of the track that is basically a rehash of “You and Me Both”). The closing track “Black & White” is a slow-burning ballad, a staple of any album by The Classic Crime, about facing one’s maker after wasting the most precious gift one can receive, that of life. How to be Human is another solid entry from an old favorite.\n\nNotable Tracks: Not Done With You Yet, Driftwood, More, Black & White\n\n20. Blkswn – Smino – Smino’s ability to change tone from track to track (sometimes even within the same song) makes Blkswn a treat to listen to from start to finish. The muddled, sometimes muted production was a great decision for this project, it really allows for Smino’s voice and charisma to take center stage on the album, as evident on the earnest, heartfelt opening track “Wild Irish Roses”. Smino takes advantage of his time with you to treat you to a wide variety of tones, styles, and flows. The transitions from track to track are smooth and seamless without running into a monotone rut (see the peppy “Spitshine” and the sexy “Netflix & Dusse”). In an era where young hip hop artists are comfortable packaging a string of unrelated tracks together and calling it a mixtape, Smino makes the case that you can still make an interesting, cohesive project.\n\nNotable tracks: Wild Irish Roses, Spitshine, Netflix & Dusse, B Role, blkswn\n\n19. Pure Comedy – Father John Misty – Whenever Josh Tillman releases music, you can always count on it to be a full, well-crafted, listening experience. Pure Comedy meets expectations once again as Father John Misty offers biting, witty, and poignant criticism on anything and everything he can get his hands on. There is something here for everybody, you can commiserate with Tillman on “When the God of Love Returns There’ll Be Hell to Pay,” you can enjoy the hill-billy, big band orchestral performance on “Total Entertainment Forever,” or you can listen to the methodical takedown of the entertainment industry on the thirteen minute long “Leaving LA”. Even Tillman himself cannot escape the lampooning, as he deals criticism of himself as a self-important, old, white guy who takes himself too seriously on “Ballad of the Dying Man”. Pure Comedy just might be some of Josh Tillman’s best work yet. His vision is enormous, but he’s more than up to the task thanks to an excellent pen and plenty of musical talent to make every minute of Pure Comedy worth a listen.\n\nNotable tracks: Total Entertainment Forever, Leaving LA, Two WIldly Different Perspectives\n\n18. 508-507-2209 – Joyner Lucas – Joyner is one of the most talented rappers from the current generation of up and coming hip hop artists. His sophomore album, 508-507-2209 is proof enough that he’s ambitious and has a desire to tell huge stories, even if at times he loses focus on the overarching narrative of his project. Lucas makes a loose narrative about avoiding tough conversations and the dangers of distancing oneself, but to me, the sum of the parts is much more powerful than the whole in this case. For example, “Keep It 100” is a masterfully crafted story about the intimate moments of people and their vices, all told through the perspective of a $100 bill, however it exists mainly on its own in the greater context of the album, the same could be said for “FYM”. All that being said, Joyner is sharp, tenacious, and a downright force when he hops on the mic. Most will balk at the idea of an hour and twenty three minute long album, but Joyner Lucas has no trouble filling the entire project with a smorgasbord of tracks that are compelling and fun at the same time. Want to turn up? Listen to “Ultrasound,” “FYM,” or “Look What You Made Me Do”. Want to slow it down? “Lullaby,” “I’m Sorry,” and “One Lonely Night” are more your speed. Joyner Lucas has some of the greatest potential out of any of his contemporaries, and I think in a couple years time, we’ll be listening to a classic project from him.\n\nNotable Tracks: Ultrasound, FYM, Keep It 100, I’m Sorry\n\n17. What Now – Sylvan Esso – When the North Carolina duo first debuted with their self-titled album, I was immediately hooked. Their minimalist, indie-pop sound kept me listening for months on end. Now they’re back with a more fleshed out sound on their sophomore album What Now. I think the risk to make “bigger” sounding music paid off, Amelia Meath is an excellent vocalist, and giving her more opportunities to indulge her energetic impulses on tracks like “The Glow,” “Radio,” or “Just Dancing,” gives Sylvan Esso another dimension to explore on future projects. Nick Sanborn’s expanded sample pallet makes for a much more interesting project all in all, for example “Kick Jump Twist” is a sonic adventure that experiences several peaks and valleys within the four minute thirty second run time without the song feeling like a tonal mess. In a pop landscape that is dominated by dark sounding music (a la Taylor Swift’s “Look What You Made Me Do” or Ed Sheeran’s weird attempts at being sexy on “Shape of You”), Sylvan Esso finds their niche with a medley of fun dance tracks. As great as their debut was, Sylvan Esso letting loose allowed the duo to stay fresh while still remaining familiar to the fans that enjoyed their debut.\n\nNotable Tracks: Die Young, Radio, Just Dancing\n\n16. Run the Jewels 3 – Run the Jewels – (NOTE: This album came out on December 24th 2016, so I’m counting it as a 2017 release) Run the Jewels will be the modern generation’s Eminiem, insofar as the kids that don’t appreciate rap will ALWAYS say that this is the one group in the genre they like. The group’s third studio album (fourth if you include their meme album “Meow the Jewels”) takes a turn for the political (oh gee I wonder why?) and I think the project is better off for it. Given Killer Mike’s social activism and his short stint as a Bernie Sanders surrogate, the decision is a welcome and encouraged one. The duo is sharp as ever, El-P’s beats continue to be eccentric yet accessible, and both rappers keep their rebellious, devil may care attitude fresh. I can’t get enough of “Legend Has It”. That track to me captures Run the Jewels essence the best. It’s brash, boastful, and has a wild beat, everything we’ve come to expect from the duo. Things take a turn for the revolutionary on tracks like “Don’t Get Captured” and “A Report to the Shareholders/Kill Your Masters”. While on this album the group merely dips their toes into the the more political conversations, I think this decision will pave the way to several more years of interesting topics for the group to cover.\n\nNotable Tracks: Legend Has It, Hey Kids (Bumaye), Stay Gold, A Report to the Shareholders/Kill Your Masters\n\n15. Radio Silence – Talib Kweli – Hip hop has been in a transition, and this year many of the hot debates have come to a head. Old heads are lecturing the next generation with a message that resemble the ones that stuffy prudes told them in hip hop’s early days, legendary rappers like Andre 3000 are saying that old guys shouldn’t rap, and the definition of hip hop feels like it’s being stretched to it’s absolute limit. And then there are artists like Talib Kweli, he didn’t get the memo that old guys shouldn’t rap. His latest efforts on Radio Silence are vintage Kweli. His relentless flows on “The Magic Hour” pairs perfectly with the loosely arranged drums and the funky guitar chords that make up the beat of this track. “The Magic Hour,” feels like the most appropriate track to kick this album off, as if suggesting that Kweli’s talent isn’t inherent in his age, but rather in the hard work and dedication to his craft. Following this up with the KAYTRANADA produced “Traveling Light” and an Anderson .Paak feature further illustrates that Kweli is relevant and knows what works without sacrificing the identity that made him a success back in the mid nineties. And of course, it wouldn’t be a Kweli album without social advocacy themes. Whether he’s criticizing law enforcement on “All of Us,” or the culture of violence that is ingrained in American culture on “She’s My Hero,” Kweli continues to stay relevant by sharing impassioned, thought provoking lyrics without falling into the “fake woke” trap that contemporary hip hop artists tend to fall for.\n\nNotable Tracks: The Magic Hour, Traveling Light, She’s My Hero, Knockturnal, Write At Home\n\n14. 3 – Tricot – Since their debut studio album in 2012, Tricot has released a steady stream of hectic, complex, math rock that will surely get your blood pumping. The trio built off their previous success with their appropriately titled, third studio album, 3. Frontwoman Ikumi “Ikkyu” Nakajima continues to prove herself as a formidable vocalist throughout the project with songs like the relentless opening track “Tokyo Vampire Hotel” or her vocal solo at the end of “Sukima” that would even rival Mariah Carey’s range. Motok Kid and Ikumi have excellent chemistry with one another as they play off each other’s talented guitar playing. “Pork Ginger” is an excellent display of tempo changes that blend together without the track sounding jarring. Even though I don’t speak Japanese (and therefore don’t understand the lyrics of this album without looking them up), the trio’s ability to create tangible, emotional tones with their music is the latest evidence that music is the universal language.\n\nNotable Tracks: Tokyo Vampire Hotel, Pork Ginger, Setsuyakuka\n\n13. I Love You Like a Brother – Alex Lahey – You know, Alex Lahey is a victim to poor timing. If she somehow found a way to release this album about fifteen years ago, Lahey’s music would have been featured in every single straight-to-DVD teen movie put out over that period. Personally, I’m glad we have this project in 2017, it’s fun, sassy nature is much needed to break up the downer music that dominates my Spotify listening history. Lahey’s debut album introduces us to the funny, honest, and brash frontwoman in a flurry of energetic anthems about platonic relationships, self-care, and anything else that’s on your typical millennial’s minds. “I Haven’t Been Taking Care of Myself,” is one of my favorite songs of the year, it’s an earnest track of self-deprecation, but presented with raucous pop-punk guitar chords and an upbeat tempo. Most of the music is simple, yet addictive, thanks to Lahey packing this project with plenty of loud, electric guitars. I Love You Like a Brother is a love letter to fem pop-punk akin to Paramore, Pvris, or Courage My Love.\n\nNotable Tracks: Every Day’s the Weekend, I Haven’t Been Taking Care of Myself, Lotto in Reverse, There’s No Money\n\n12. ALL-AMERIKKKAN BADA$$ – Joey Bada$$ – The spectre of politics seems to have invaded every aspect of our lives. Celebrities, coffee companies, and tiki torches have been forced to make some kind of a political statement, it was a given that music would get political too. I can think of very few musicians that was better staged for speaking truth to power in 2017 than Joey Bada$$. While most prefer the boom-bap, golden era hip hop sound that got Joey noticed a la 1999 or B4.Da.$$, I think the more airwave friendly sound of ALL-AMERIKKAN BADA$$ works well for the Brooklyn emcee. Listeners are treated to a whole range of Joey’s emotions on this project, in particular his complicated relationship with the United States. “FOR MY PEOPLE” is laden with optimistic sounding synths and a distant brass instrument as Joey raps about overcoming the everyday trials and tribulations of his existence through his “super power” of sharing his experience through the written word. “LAND OF THE FREE” is a somber anthem about feeling dissatisfied with the American government and the lack of change that politicians like Obama were able to accomplish despite their campaign promises.The sample selection on this album is superb, the clip from Coonskin is the perfect transition from “Y U DON’T LOVE ME? (MISS AMERIKKKA)” to “ROCKABYE BABY”. And the audio of the child’s police brutality speech is an excellent bookend for the “TEMPTATION”. The conclusion of the project, “AMERIKKKAN IDOL” is a boiling point of frustration wherein Joey calls for unity and a revolution against the powers that be; depending on your perspective it’s either inspiring or terrifying, but nevertheless the natural conclusion of all the feelings that Joey lays out on the project.\n\nNotable Tracks: FOR MY PEOPLE, LAND OF THE FREE, ROCKABYE BABY, LEGENDARY, AMERIKKKAN IDOL\n\n11. Witness – Benjamin Booker – Benjamin Booker is one of the latest in this wave of contemporary artists that are reinterpreting classic genres. If Leon Bridges had a rebel older brother, he would be Benjamin Booker. “Right On You” sets the perfect tone for the rest of this project, it’s a jubilant, rebellious introduction to Booker’s infectious talent, and he rarely loses your attention throughout the album. The bluesy, garage-rock, tracks are broken up when appropriate with a well-timed gospel influenced song, like the title track “Witness” or “Carry”. The full range of Booker’s talents are on display on “Off the Ground” a track that explodes into a raucous display of wailing and guitar mashing that would be sure to wake up the dead. Benjamin Booker is the the type of frontman that is an absolute joy to listen to, and his talent truly shines through from start to finish on Witness.\n\nNotable Tracks: Right On You, Witness, Overtime, Off the Ground\n\n10. Flower Boy – Tyler the Creator – A feeling of resolution is ever prominent throughout Flower Boy. The project peels back a lot of the violent, revolting nature that was so prevalent on Tyler’s earlier work in favor of a mellow tone. The opening track, “Foreword” is a moment of self-reflection, as Tyler poses questions about his life thus far, something we would never see during Tyler’s Goblin era. He brings heavy nostalgia vibes on the track “November” as he asks the listener to think about their November, or the time they were happiest. All these thoughtful tracks are not to say that Tyler has lost the edge that he built his brand off of. “Who Dat Boy” and “I Ain’t Got Time!” are both vintage Tyler the Creator, albeit with a little less sexual assault. From the warm, breezy, production to the superb rapping, Tyler the Creator has blossomed (boo me for this awful pun please) on Flower Boy. Regardless of how you feel about the authenticity of Tyler using this album as a coming out moment, it’s hard to deny that he has come a long way from his Goblin days.\n\nNotable Tracks: Foreword, See You Again, I Ain’t Got Time!, November\n\n9. Process – Sampha – The British singer/songwriter’s debut studio project was long anticipated as he built a reputation through his features and production credits with artists like Solange, Drake, and FKA Twigs (among others). To say that Sampha delivered on the hype is an understatement. Slow boiling production on tracks like “Plastic 100°C” and “(No One Knows Me) Like the Piano” highlight Sampha’s talent as a singer. These tracks feel complete despite the minimalist approach to the backing instrumental. Speaking of “(No One Knows Me) Like the Piano,” that track is a testament to Sampha as the complete package. His songwriting, piano playing, and lyricism come together in an intimate story about Sampha at his most vulnerable. Sampha brings a fine tuned ear for production, an elegant pen for songwriting, his honeyed voice, and of course his talent at the ivory keys. This collection of spacious sonic delights is a brief, but intimate journey wit"
