        "text": "What I need: Freelance Final Cut Pro X editors to line up for some projects in the fall. What I don't need: Adobe Premiere editors, Content marketing companies trying to upsell me, people asking me why I don't use Adobe, people who start sentences \"But Premiere can...\", etc. If you've got gigging editors you've worked with and recommend who use FCPX, please connect me or share reels. If you want to know how I rediscovered Final Cut is 100x faster and better than premiere for my current projects, we can discuss over coffee.\n\nHi! I'm trying to make some content for students just to help them know a little more about roles in the real world, skills they'll use, tips and tricks etc - and if you work in one of these industries, I would really really really like to interview you. If you can do a 15-minute zoom chat, and work in: Digital Marketing, Project Management, Cybersecurity, Esports or Gaming, Game Dev, Computer Science or Public Health, it'll help students understand more about the world. If not you, maybe you've got a friend who does? Thanks! (FYI - internal only, not for social shares just for students to get a better grasp of what the world holds!)\n\nmy two cents - for a decade (or more?) the dominant message for us all has been some combo of “work/life balance” + “individual expression” + movement for employees to take more control of their destinies. I spent the first 15 years of my professional life doing all that as an independent maker of things, and it’s great - but what was missing was teamwork and feeling like I was part of a team - my gut would be that it’s a feeling missing for lots of others, and a huge change from the world my folks went to work in. past couple years I’ve been with Rize and the start-up sense of building something with teammates and caring about the success of a team project is the most rewarding thing (helps that I like what we do, but I actually think feeling like I owe something to the people I’m doing it with is the more fulfilling part.) I never played college sports but it’s my guess this is the same feeling. if my mindset was just “I’ll do this for 2 years, so I can do that with the next 2 years, so I can do this other thing 2 years later” - I wouldn’t get those nice feels. I get that everyone wants to hate on the way things were done in the 50s/60s/70s, but certainly feels like the buy in they had to a “team ethos” made the work more than the sum of its parts and its meetings and paperwork. https://lnkd.in/gMcGtffK\n\nSome of my co-workers love what we do because they get to help lower the cost of college for students. Some people love it because it means better job outcomes for students without driving tuition up. I'm so into working at Rize because I see the impact we have saving small colleges (and protecting them as economic and intellectual cornerstones of small towns and rural areas like where I am in Ohio.) If you know technical marketing and want to work for a place that makes you feel any of those things every day when you sit down to get to work, please consider applying below."
