        "text": "BE ON THE LOOKOUT FOR NARDO'S ALBUM \"KRUNK\", TEAR DA CLUB UP THUGS \"CRAZYNDALAZDAYZ\", and EIGHTBALL & MJG's \"IN OUR LIFE TIME\"\n\nMEMPHIS (Orange Mound, Frayser, South Memphis, White and BlackHaven, Germantown, etc.)\n\nJACKSON\n\nNASHVILLE\n\nKNOXVILLE\n\nREVIEW:PROPHET POSSE: BODY PARTS AHHHH!! YESSSS! It finally came out! It seems as if here in Oklahoma, Disc Jockey gets these releases on the Friday after the Tuesday they are due to be in stores.. so I had to get it Friday. But thats OK! It was worth the wait. This is a very interesting album, which is HIGHLY influenced by heavy metal and shock rock music. As you may or may not know, DJ Paul and the rest of Triple 6 love to listen to heavy metal. I think they decided to unleash this on this album. There is a very strong tendency to talk about death and killing, which shrouded the theme of \"Mystic Stylez\", but this really doesn't hurt the album at all. It was actuly nice to see them go back to their old dark past. Also they kept it real with the underground sound they used to have back in the day. The album starts off great with Lord Infamous on \"Murderer, Robber\"... very nice. I like the water drip sound, which just adds to the beat! \"Orange Mound\" by M-Child is really tight too, it uses an old underground loop of \"orange Mound\", plus M-Child straight goes THE FUCK OFF! This song sounds really dark as well. Crunchy Black really doesn't do anything for me on this next song called, \"Left'em Dead\". I just can't get with it, because Crunchy's rapping fucks the whole song up. But The Kaze cleans up Crunchy's vomit and makes the song better than it would have been! The next song by Droopy Drew Dogg is really tight. It uses a haunting keyboard in the background as well as a sample from The Geto Boys's song \"Murder After Midnight\" and The Hard Boys \"Criminal Behavior\". This is a very good sample and Droopy really sets it off. I really really like the next song by The Dayton Family and The Kaze called, \"Bout The South\", which uses some really catchy drums and a really dark and evil-sounding melody. Then the Kaze RIP THE MIKE THE FUCK UP! Man I love these guys. And The Dayton Family makes it even better! GOOD JOB! \"Turn Into Killas\" sounds really retarded at first with a really stupid chorus. But then it gets better and you tend to ignore the \"Prophet Posse My Nigga\" chorus. \"Notha Nigga's Cars/Clothes\" is a really SOLID effort by Three 6 Mafia and The Kaze. I like the beat as well, and the keyboards are something on another level... very nice! The next song is one of the really TIGHT AS HELL songs on the album. \"Drinkin' and Thinkin'\" is a very solid song featuring Indo G and K-Rock. This is some of the best rapping by Indo G and K-Rock I have ever heard. \"Favorite Scary Movie\" is THE SONG that lets you know Three 6 loves heavy metal. This is a dead give away. This is really interesting! I LOVE IT! \"Catch A Blast\" is the song that I thought they would used that old instrumental from \"THE END\" to rap over, and it is REALLY GOOD. The other songs are really solid too, especially \"All For One\" with Gangsta Boo, \"Smoked Out, Loced Out\" by Three 6, and escpecially \"Bitches On My Jock\" which IS THE TIGHTEST song on the album..HANDS DOWN. OVERALL THIS COMES REALLY CLOSE to being as good as \"Chapter 2\" I LOVED IT..with no noticable flaws other than retarded choruses, which seems to be Prophet's \"thorn in the side.\" RATING: 9.0 out of 10\n\nREVIEW:MAC T COLIONE (THE MEMPHIS CARTEL): \"DA SOUTH HAS RIZEN\" This kinda took me by suprise, because I really was looking for some Texas Rap, when I stumbled upon this CD. I listened to it, and I was rather amazed by how differnt this sounded. It is certainly an underground album, and it features artists like Mac T Colione, First Degree, G-Rize, and many more. The first two songs are by Mac T Colione. They sound OK, \"South Side Love\" is rather nice, \"185 on the Dash\" is pretty cool as well, and so does \"Dead Presidents\", but the thing that really makes this CD special is the fact that it sounds TRULY underground Memphis. The classic loops and choruses emphasize this. Then comes Lost Innocence. One song that really stands out is \"You Know The Rules\", which uses some really interesting strings, plus the lyrics certainly fit the song. \"Every Nigga Born and Every Nigga Die\" has a more depressing melody, but it is rather fast paced, and the lyrical flow is very good. Mr. Crump is up next, and this guy sounds like a cross between Tommy Wright and K-Rock. This is some retarded sounding music man! What the hell? I don't like \"MasterMind\" or \"G.O.D.\"... it just sounds too retarded. Shorty-G is up next with a nice beat in \"S.J.B.\", and \"Keep It Real and True\"... some of the nicest keyboards on the album... these are 2 of the 4 songs I really like on this album. First Degree comes next with the two songs that I really like. These are \"Ridge Grove Tales\" and Married to My Nina\". It is kinda wierd because First Degree kinda sounds like C-Loc in these two songs.G-Rize finishes the album with 3 songs, which are not bad. \"Venom\", \"Night Life\", and \"Envy\" are really solid songs to round out the CD. I must say, this was not bad for a low-budget underground release, but there are too many out there doing this same kinda thing, and I just don't think that these guys can do anything to change the rap world, other than First Degree, maybe. RATING:6 out of 10\n\nREVIEW: DIRTY HARRY PRODUCTIONS PRESENTS: SOUTHERN GANGSTAS Ah I have been waiting for this one, because there are so many Middle Tennessee artists that I have been wondering about for quite some time now. Guillotine and The Capital Punishment Click are two out of many on this album. The first song is \"Deep In The Game\" which features Pimp C of UGK, which is a rather interesting song, has a catchy beat, and sounds extra good with the help of Pimp C. The song seems to use keyboards often used by Skinny Pimp and Lil' Milt. Speaking of Lil' Milt, he really came strong on the next song, which is called \"My Everyday Life\". Man this shit is hittin'. I think DJ Nite helped him with this one, because it has a classic, laid-back, eerie beat... and nice keyboards. 'Milt also makes the track even better with good lyrics.... I TOLD YOU HE WAS GONNA GET BETTER! The next good track is by Scandalous called, \"Killin\". A rather haunting song, it basically talks about none other than! Killing! Nothing new here, it just has an excellent beat. Guillotine comes strong next with his song \"Prelude\". Things start deteriorating after this though as Kool Daddy Fresh does nothing for me with his song. P.F.K. has a nice song which has some nice drums called \"One In The Trunk\". \"Swisher Time\" by The Capital Punishment Klik is rather nice, talking about smokin' weed... nothing new lyricwise, but the beat is nice and laid-back. Mr. Quikk's song \"Whatcha Want\" sounds way too much like Fiend and Mystikal, and the song just sucks overall... too damn noisy! Playa G comes strong as usual with \"Those Who Be Slippin\" with a nice sample. Now here is Kingpin Skinny Pimp, with \"Top Knotch\"... where the hell has this guy been?! Well the song is weak. This song just doesn't compare to what he used to do with Three 6 Mafia and the production by Playa G really doesn't help the song. The Capital Punishment Klik comes with another track that sounds pretty cool called \"Tha Hustle\". Al Kapone's song \"It Ain't No Mystery\" is OK, but really doesn't do much for me. There is a really cool song by Big B called \"Raining Blood\", which has some nice cymbal action, and some really nice drums. The lyrics sound similar to Pistol and he really gets his point across, however it really isn't anything new. The rest of the album really weakens rapidly, and I am left wondering.....what? Overall not bad... RATING:7 out of 10\n\nREVIEW I: THREE 6 MAFIA: \"MYSTIC STYLEZ\": This is the first of the CD releases from Three 6 Mafia. It was released back in 1995, and was highly anticipated, since this would be their first regional release. The group, which at the time was made up of: DJ PAUL, JUICY J, PLAYA FLY, LIL GLOCK AND S.O.G., THE KILLA KLAN KAZE, GANGSTA BLAC, PROJECT PAT, LIL' GIN, SKINNY PIMP, and host of others. The main members were Paul, Juicy J, and Gangsta Boo...with the others being \"disfunctional\" members. This is perhaps one of the best albums on the Memphis rap list. It sold about 100,000 units, half of those in the Mid-South alone. The song has a darker tone than the other three albums they released.... as they often make references to the devil and have some rather raw lyrics. The best songs on this album are \"Break da Law\", which is a Triple 6 classic, \"Da Summa\", a huge club favorite, \"Live by yo Rep\", which disses BONE quite badly. Also....other good tracks are \"Up Against the Wall\", which flexes Lord Infamous's rap talent. Another very interesting song is their final song \"Porno Movie\", which has a slow laid-back type feel. Overall, This is a good album. It is getting kinda hard to find, since more attention is being drawn toward their new albums, but if you can find it, pick it up QUICKLY! RATING: 8 out of 10\n\nREVIEW II: THREE 6 MAFIA: \"LIVE BY YO REP\": This is actually Mystic Stylez (Continued), but since Three 6 did not have anymore room on thier first tape, they went the EP route, and made a little extra money. This is actually, in my opinion, a waste, because even though it contains a tight ass screwed version of \"Live by yo Rep\", it just is too little too soon after the release of \"Mystic Stylez\". The only notable song on here is the song, \"Throw Your Setts in Da Air\", which has a very tight ass beat. Other than that, the solos by Koopsta Knicca, Killa Klan, and the new \"Tear da Club Up\" are nothing new. I might add that the intro is really cool. Get this one only if you are a Three 6 fan. RATING: 6 out of 10\n\nREVIEW III: THREE 6 MAFIA: \"THE END\": Now this is the shiznit! This album is totally different from their previous work, due to the fact that the have better production, courtesey of DJ Slice Tee, who produced Tela's \"Piece of Mind\" album. This album actually sold over 200,000 units in the South, which is not bad for not haveing that great of a distributor. The main tracks to pay attention to on here are \"Late Night Tip\", \"Good Stuff\", \"Walk Up to Yo House\", and practically the last half of the album. The very first song after the intro is tight too. The main fault in this album is their deviation from their usual evil sound. They were starting to get away from it in the EP \"Live by Yo Rep\", but they really changed their sound here. Almost no underground samples from their old tapes. Other than that, I love this album. RATING: 8.5 out of 10\n\nREVIEW IV: THREE 6 MAFIA: \"CHAPTER 2: WORLD DOMINATION\":This is a totally new sound coming from Three 6 Mafia, and I like it. This has giot to be the best album I have heard from Memphis. They narrowly beat the Taylor Boyz. I was totally blown away when I heard this shit. I was sitting in Blockbuster Music just jammin' and everyone knew why. This album will make you bounce, GET BUCK, or what ever the hell you want to call it. This is the absolute pinnacle in Southern Rap. Although, this album has its bad moments, I must say... I put away Master P's \"Ghetto Dope\" for a month and jammed this...and I am still playing it now. Usually it takes a long time for me to get tired of a CD. I am getting tired of this one now, but I have worn it the HELL out. One thing you may notice here is that Gangsta Blac, Skinny Pimp. and Playa Fly are not on this album. There are reasons for this, but even in their absence. It is still bumpin'. The most notable track is \"Whatcha Do\". GOD this is tight as hell. You wanna GET BUCK? But this shit in your CD player and blast all of your friends out of the CAR! BUMPIN' I tell you. Another is \"I Ain't Cha Friend\". WOOOO! Good GOD this is tight as hell. Now this is some evil sounding stuff! I must say, Three 6 Mafia kinda went back to their old style on this album, which I liked very much. \"Land of The Lost\", \"Flashes\", \"Neighborhood Hoe\" is tight as hell too! This is a DJ Paul solo, and it IS all DJ PAUL! The album does have its bad moments. \"Spill My Blood\" is WEAK! I don't like it at all. I also refuse to accept the two intros in a row at the beginning of the album. Also, even though \"Tear Da Club Up '97\" sound tight as hell, they really don't change much of the song. I hate repeats. STOP BEATING THE SONG TO DEATH. Other than that, the album is THE BOMB! Go get it! RATING: 9.0 out of 10\n\nREVIEW V: KINGPIN SKINNY PIMP: \"SKINNY BUT DANGEROUS\":This is not Skinnp Pimp's second album after \"King of Da..\". This is actually a compilation of his underground hits from back in the day. Although i did not hear much Skinny Pimp back in high school, I was rather impressed with what he as trying to do. That doest mean I like this CD. NOOO I don't like this at all, and why did you wait so late? Even though the album features legendary Memphis artists Al Kapone, SMK, and Gangsta Pat... it just sounds too elementary for me. There is one song that I like, and that is \"Animosity\". This is a very bassy CD, and your Alpine will overheat playing this CD. LOTSA BASS! Other than that it is really too weak to buy new. Go to CD Warehouse and find it used. RATING: 5 out of 10\n\nREVIEW VI: KINGPIN SKINNY PIMP: \"KING OF DA PLAYAZ BALL\": Now this is a different story. With production by DJ Paul and Juicy J, this album really shines and shows what a talented artist Skinny Pimp really is. The album took forever to be released, but once it was, it was sensational. This was the best Prophet release, before \"The End\", selling over 300,000 copies in the South. This album features just about all of the Prophet Posse. Killa Klan, Three 6 Mafia, Gangsta Blac, Koopsta Knicca, and DJ Jus Borne add the needed variety to an already classic underground album. This is a rather nice change of pace from the other two Prophet releases. I was very impressed with the start of the CD. \"One Life to Live\" has got to be one of the best songs I have ever heard from Skinny Pimp. Talk about lyrical skills! This brotha really knows what the hell he is doing when it comes to rockin' the mic. It blends well with the haunting intro as well. Other notables are: \"Nobody Crosses Me\", the Eightball and MJG remake of \"Lookin' for Da Chewin'\" is tight as hell. Also, \"We Ain't no (Playa)Haterz\" is very solid. \"King of da Playaz Ball\" is tight as well. The one song that stands out is the one with Skinny Pimp and the Killa Klan Kaze. I forgot which song it is, but if you want to hear the Killa Klan rip BONE or TWISTA to pieces on the mic as far as speed.... then you listen to this song. I think it is track #9, it is the one after Gangsta Boo's effort, which I might add, isn't bad either. I give big up's to this album...go GET IT. is is a southern classic. RATING: 8.7 out of 10\n\nREVIEW VII: GANGSTA BLAC: \"CAN IT BE?\" I am now doing an entirely new review for this album, since I am gettin gtired of all of these little bitch ass niggas from Memphis and elsewhere claiming the album is better than what I said in my first review. And I am here to say that even if I do re-review the album, it is still going to be as sinister as my last review. When I first bought this album, the only songs that I liked were \"Powder\", \"Ain't No Love\", and \"Life's A Bitch\". The rest of the album could kiss my ass , because I didn't like the rest of it. After listening to the album time and time again, I still think that those songs i mentioned are the best on the album. The only other song that comes close to being as good as the others is \"Tire Shop\". I do like Gangsta Blac, I just cannot stand it when he raps on weak beats. Listen to his new album, now that is how he should sound. The album still is not top-notch, and I know he is capable of better material. I like another song, while I am thinking about it, \"Blaze Up Another One\", only because I like the way he sounds. As far as the beat goes, it is HORRIBLE. After even further review.... this is the final time I am going to talk about this album, so to all of you who have written me nasty letters and left me nasty notes on my Guestbook, if you don't like this rating, then go suck a dick. RATING: 6.6 out of 10\n\nREVIEW IX: LIL' MILT: \"THE PROPHECY\" This album is not bad, but yet it isn't that great either. 'Milt is from Nashville, TN and he hangs around with Playa G and DJ Nite on Eastwood Entertainment. Milt is by far the worst, yet lyrically talented rapper out of Tennessee. Now that might sound contradictory, but when you put good rapping over terrible tracks you have an album that sucks. I am sorry that is the way it goes. Another very important error, the only thing original about this album is the cover art. Other than that, there are only two tracks that stand out. These are #5 and the very last track which I think is #14. If I can't remember the names of the damn tracks then you know it really wasn't worth remembering. The last track is a very familiar sample, used very often... I remember it being used several times on the COUP's album \"Genocide and Juice\". Anyway, this is one to avoid, and I would wait until his next project comes out, which I think will be better. MUCH BETTER. RATING: 4 out of 10.\n\nREVIEW X: MEMPHIZ UNDAGROUND HUSTLAZ: \"VOLUME I\": Now this album is hittin' hard! I love this album. This is basically an Alkatraz compilation, including such artists as Al Kapone, Young Lo, The Taylor Boyz, Deep Sleep, GK, C-9, DJ DIZ, The Project Playaz, Criminal E, amongst others. This album really showcases Memphis's other rap underground scene... meaning not including Three 6 Mafia and other Prophet members. By all means, they are cool with each other, they just have a different sound, and a different way of doin' thangs! Anyway it is a trunk rattling album for sure, and it will get you bobbin that noggin. The really notable tracks are Al Kapone's track #2, Young Lo's track #4, the Deep Sleep, C-9 track #5 ...this one is THE best on the album, and the Project Playaz clown on track #9. There is a song called \"Ghetto Pimpin\" that is really tight too. One thing I really like about Alkatraz Productions is that they are original. Like you have heard me say a million times, that is number one! The tracks are solid I love practically the whole album, with the exception of DJ DIZ. RATING:8 out of 10 BASS RATING: HOLY COW!!! 8 out of 10\n\nREVIEW XI: AL KAPONE: \"DA RESSURECTION\": This is Al Kapone's second CD release, but by all means not his first album ever. This is THE veteran.. the one who laid it down for all Memphis Underground today. In my eyes he is the GOD of Memphis Underground. I am not saying he is my favorite Memphis artist... I think you know who that is! Anyway this man really lays the tracks down, and Memphians love him. However with this album, he kinda fucks up a bit....pardon my FRENCH. He basically took tracks from his old joint \"Sinista Funk\" and laid down some new tracks BAD IDEA! Yep, he kinda slips with this release, not nearly as powerful as his older tapes (Street Knowledge), but it still has that evil and dark style that I have always known Al Kapone to deliver. The main flaw with this album is that he tried to do things a little different... instead of keeping real. He probably did this because he was now nationwide, on Brutal Records... distributed by Priority. This is the same thing that Three 6 Mafia did with \"Chapter II\"...they almost totally left their old sound. This proved costly for Al Kapone though, because his labum did not do as well in Memphis as his first tapes as well as \"Sinista Funk\". There are really no notable tracks on this album other than \"Cold Hearted Killer\" and that appears on \"Sinista Funk\". Again he beats his old track \"Lyrical Driveby\" to death... how many times can you remake a song? Buy this album only if you review albums like me, not for your listening pleasure. RATING 5 out of 10.\n\nREVIEW XII: AL KAPONE: \"SINISTA FUNK\"... This is a really strange album to me, because after hearing Al Kapone of years past, this comes as a slap in the face. the reason being is that it sounds like it was produced for the nationwide scene and not Memphis. I am sure there are a lot of Memphians that cannot relate to this album because of its sound. The songs that really stand out are \"Lyrical Drive By\", which I have heard 3000 versions of, and \"Full of Indo\". Al Kapone takes a different route here by not sounding nearly as haunting as he usually does, and of course he makes up for that in \"Da Ressurection\". This album is loaded with tracks, but not tracks I want to hear from Al Kapone. The only way of describing the sound of this album is to take Mississippi Mafia's sound and add some hella wicked drum beats to it. It is basically more of a funk album than a gangsta rap album. I bought just to say I it, but really for no other reason. Skip it! RATING: 6 out of 10\n\nREVIEW XIII:AL KAPONE: \"WHATCHA GOT?\": ... I actually like this one, even though it isn't nearly as wicked as I like for Al Kapone to sound. he has a couple of hella tight songs on here that use that wickedness. \"To the Death\" is one. If you want to fry your speakers, just play this one with the volume maxxed out. This is more of a softer toned album than this earlier CD, \"The Ressurection\" and his old underground tapes, \"Street Knowledge Vol 1-?\". It has more of a playa type feel, meaning it is taking more of pimpin' women than darker themes like death and sin. I am not saying that I thrive on this, but I really would like to hear more from an artist than just pimpin' women and smokin' weed. I have heard it all before. Al Kapone is a veteran and I love him to death... but i still think he fell short on this album. He needs to go back to his old ways, and maybe he can sell more CD's that way, I don't know, but I think he knows what he needs to do more than I. There are other notable tracks on here, including some very interesting tracks that include the Taylor Boyz and production from SMK and DJ Squeeky. The songs I did not like are \"Whatcha Got?\" and \"Lyrical Driveby\". Other than that, I can live with this one, but it really isn't anything I haven't heard before. RATING: 7 out of 10\n\nREVIEW XIV: PLAYA FLY: \"FLY SHIT\":.... This is a really mediocre album, I just don't like the fact that he has to take his frustrations out on Three 6 Mafia on wax. I think of you have beef with someone, you should handle that with them directly, and not be a coward and so that shit on the DL. Anyway, Playa Fly had a promising career with Prophet and Three 6 Mafia. He was one of the best rappers in the group, and I actually thought that things would go well for Playa Fly known as Lil Fly back then. But apparently somethings came up where Playa Fly was not getting the rapping time that he got on \"Mystic Stylez\" and he became pissed, ehich I can understand, and he was axed by DJ Paul and Juicy J after there was all kinds of arguing and bickering. 'Fly went off on his own, and he began to start is own thing on Super Sigg Records out of Tunica, MS. He along with ELG, or the Evalasting Gangstas came together to make this latest album \"Fly Shit\". Now there is some speculation that since Gangsta Blac has been rapping with Fly, Three 6 Mafia hasn't been giving \"blac the time of day anymore, which you may notice on Three 6 Mafia's last 2 albums, he was nowhere to be found. Interesting eh? Well, this album is rather pleasant, including the first song \"Nappy Hair and Gold Teeth:. As stupid as the title might sound, you may be suprised at how good this songs is. It has that classic southern sound, and will leave you wanting more. Well if you go to the next song, \"Crowning Me\", you will find that much is still to be desired. This is not as good of a song as \"Nappy\", but is still kinda catchy. After this the album takes a gradual downward spiral. \"Triple Bitch Mafia\" is Fly's answer to Three 6 Mafia's ana with Fly. It is not that great, and I have heard this dissin' shit before on 2Pac and Mobb Deep albums, and I don't need it anymore! The other sounds are not that original in context, but as far as beats they are rather nice, and thats what keeps my attention. If you can find it, get it for the first song, and you might like the rest of it, but even though it is one of the better Memphis rap CD's it still could have been much better. RATING: 6.9 out of 10\n\nREVIEW XV: TAYLOR BOYZ: \"28 GRAMZ: PURE DOPE\" This SHIT IS BANGIN', You wanna go deaf? Play this at high volume in a closed room! A club maybe? Man this is one of the top 5 all time best Memphis rap CD's I have in my collection. I really don't like the album cover though, because my idea of a good photo shot is not to see the artists' scrotum har peeking over the edge of their underwear! Put some clothes on! Other than that, this is SLAMMIN'! The bass in this CD is tremendous! Just listen to it! My favorite tracks are \"Big Bag of Blunts\", \"Full of Smoke\", \"Catraggly\", \"Bring Tha Noise\", and \"The Main Event\" which features all of the Alkatraz Syndicate including Al Kapone and GK. If you liked Money Butt Naked, Memphiz Undaground Hustlaz, or DJ Squeeky, then you will ove this. The album is bent more toward smokin' weed and slangin' cain, which I have heard defore, so I am really not moved by the lyrics, btu I like they way they rap, because it goes with the beats they have very well. The beats in themselves are tight, and I suggest that you just hear this album once. I guarantee you will likw it! RATING: 8 out of 10."
