Rather than providing a straight-ahead beat pattern, the electronic percussion used in the song are often springing off of syncopations that create a more exotic feel. Layered on top of this is a vocal melody that includes elements of an exotic scale, specifically an augmented second that takes place between scale degrees b2 and 3. Paired with Spears’s voice is a synthesizer manipulated to sound like some sort of reed instrument, further evoking a Middle Eastern sound. This melodic element has two very recognizable cousins, one of them occurring much earlier than 2003. Ellie Hisama’s essay “From L’Etranger to ‘Killing an Arab’” explores a similar relationship in a 1986 song by The Cure. While that song had the context of an Albert Camus novel as its reason for evoking such exoticism, Spears has used a similar means to merely make the song more seductive and striking to the listener. Such exoticism would perhaps also put more attention on the lyrics. The other similar example to this that I allude to is Kelis’s “Milkshake”. While the 2003 album Tasty which features “Milkshake” was released a month after In the Zone, the song had been released as a single in late August and was finding itself all over the airwaves. In an interlude-passage Kelis sings a motive based on scale degrees b2 and 1, evoking here and in other places a feeling of Phrygian modality. Further assisting the exoticism of this song is the use of antique cymbals (commonly known as finger cymbals), evoking more exoticism in the form of what most people associate this instrument with - belly dancing.\n\nArghh :angry:\n\nI purchased that Britney Spears song off iTunes and also verified it is NOT the song.\n\nIt was used in a different commercial but not the 300 C\n\nI saw someone put up $10. to Google answers to get the results so it is driving everyone nuts.\n\nHas someone captured the commercial and made an MP3 of the portion used in the commercial for us to make comparisons? If so please post."
