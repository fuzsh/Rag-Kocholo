        "text": "( ENSPIRE Music ) LongLiveCZAR is Back and Better than Ever with the Release of his Latest Visuals for his Singles ‘Sicario’ and ‘Wet’\n\nLongLiveCZAR has truly made a name for himself over the years but if this one isn’t that familiar, then you might recognize him as Lil C. The South Central native was truly born to be a star and never in his wildest dreams could he imagine how far his gift would take him. Growing up music and dance went hand in hand for young Christopher who grew up listening to the greats like Smokey Robinson, Harold Melvin & The Blue Notes, Frankie Beverly & Maze, Bobby Brown, NWA, MC Hammer, and Ice Cube.\n\nBut although he grew up in the hood, his dreams were always bigger than his surroundings, and studying these greats was always a beautiful distraction from everyday life. His passion for dance is what truly changed everything for him after famed photographer/director David LaChapelle turned the camera lens on him and others in the critically acclaimed documentary ‘RIZE’. This breakout film was the beginning of his world-changing as one of the creators of Krump which became one of the world’s biggest dance crazes after the movie was released. The Krump movement in itself took Lil C all over the world which only proved that he was destined to be a star.\n\nHis gift for dance would ultimately put him on some of the biggest stages in the world working alongside superstars like Missy Elliott, Ciara, Christina Milian, Madonna, Gwen Stefani, J-Lo, Black Eye Peas, Eve, Chris Brown, Neyo, Usher, Omarion, Soulja Boy, Nelly, 50 Cent, The Game, Blink 182, Elton John and Ginuwine. When he wasn’t on center stage he was on the big screen as a dancer featured in major films including ‘Stomp The Yard’, ‘Bring It On Again’, ‘Center Stage: Turn It Up’ and ‘You Got Served: Beat the World’. Now if that wasn’t enough, CZAR really became a household name after becoming a guest choreographer and judge on the hit FOX dance competition series ‘So You Think You Can Dance‘.\n\nHis gift continuously opened doors he never dreamed of, but his passion for music was always something he really wanted to tap into. So it was only right that put in the work to collaborate with other artists as a songwriter behind the scenes and within no time he was creating magic with acts including Anderson Paak, Murda Beatz, Chris Brown, Jhené Aiko, Omarion, Kid Ink, Kehlani, French Montana, Anatti, Tee’Flii, Rayven Justice, Tank, Micah, and Danileigh.\n\nThe success of co-writing Omarion’s Top 5 hit ‘Post To Be’ along with Chris Brown & Jhené Aiko was just the push he needed to step out on his own and take center stage performing his own music. In late 2018 he began to heat things up with the release of his buzz-worthy singles ‘Sicario’, ‘Oh My!’, ‘DayDream’, ‘Violated’, ‘Blue Summer’, and ‘Bishop’. But as he really began to make major moves touring and promoting the records, the world shut down due to the Covid-19 pandemic. But for what many would see as a roadblock, CZAR saw this as an opportunity to get back in the studio and create some of his best work along with visuals for his highly anticipated visual project. Now he’s back and better than ever with 2 new videos for his tracks ‘Sicario’ and ‘Wet’ which are sure to heat the summer up as fans anxiously wait on more to come from the triple threat who is ready to shine in the spotlight on his own terms.\n\nKeep up to date with LongLiveCZAR on social media at @LongLiveCzar"
