        "text": "@DRCharlesLaw Charles Lawrence began dancing at the age of 9, and had his first dance experiences in the world of show choir, traveling and attending Show Choir Camps of America. Lawrence attended show choir camps every year until 2001. While attending Auburn University in Alabama pursing a degree in secondary education, he became a member of their elite show choir group the Auburn Singers. In 2007, he graduated with his Masters Degree at Southern Illinois University. Lawrence took a short sabbatical from dance to pursue motivational speaking as well as focus on his Doctorate in Forensic Psychology at the Chicago Professional School of Psychology. In 2010, Lawrence made a strong come-back into dance as the choreographer and creative director on a music video for up and coming pop artist JQ. Inspired, Lawrence began working with more rising artists helping to build their careers and stage presence. Lawrence also began teaching master classes throughout the area, as well as becoming the hip hop director at a studio in Chicago’s west suburbs. Simply teaching could not contain Lawrence’s passion for reaching students, so he founded his own company in early 2011, Dance Rogue LLC Intensive Workshops. Since the foundation of Dance Rogue, Lawrence’s company has grown exponentially and attracted a well-accomplished faculty throughout the country. In the fall of 2011, Lawrence took his talents internationally all the way to Baku, Azerbaijan where he was the Assistant Director, Creative Director and Choreographer for the country’s first Hip-Hop Musical, Leyli və Məcnun. Lawrence helped make history while working on the musical, an Azerbaijani story resembling the classic tale of Romeo and Juliet traditionally performed as an opera, by creating the first production of it’s kind on that side of the world using hip hop and other Western influences. Lawrence gained fame quickly while working on the production making television appearances teaching classes, and soon developed a strong following in the Caucasus region other parts of Europe. Lawrence feels blessed to have worked internationally, but feels what is most important as a choreographer is not who he has worked with, but about who he can inspire. In his current endeavors, Lawrence puts his diverse background and knowledge of dance styles into his productions and concept pieces, stylizing and creating character pieces with an almost unlimited variety of influences from urban, ragtime, contemporary, swing, to ballet and jazz. Lawrence’s personal dance style is also a unique blend, incorporating his background in Hip Hop with his own flavor, which he coined as ‘Urban Contemporary.’ Currently, Lawrence’s dream is his reality, with the creative freedom to spend his time traveling and teaching, judging as well as being a stage manager for Starbound plus continuing to work with artists on music videos and stage productions, growing Dance Rogue, and hosting workshops to inspire young dancers throughout the country.\n\nDance Rogue: Director of Operations\n\n@Trini4Ever Keon K.

Recently he has performed with artists such as Dita Von Teese, Rita Ora, Conor Maynard, Sean Kingston and Ne-Yo.

Boss was born and raised in Montgomery, Alabama where as a child he was always seen dancing. At times when he wasn’t allowed to dance, like at school or church, he would resort to “popping and ticking” (a popular hip-hop style of dance) that resembles a twitch to most. That was how he earned the nickname “tWitch.” Learn more about tWitch at http://www.TheOfficialtWitch.com\n\n@Dance9CyrusCyrus “Glitch” Spencer was born in Dallas, Texas but grew up in Atlanta, Georgia.

Lauderdale and Orlando, David now resides in Los Angeles. During his time in Florida, his interest in the dance world grew as he gained exposure to concert tours and music videos. It wasn’t long before he was in front of the mirror teaching himself everything he saw on television. Without formal training he was able to learn choreography and movement from anything dance related as he worked toward finding and developing his own style. During his college years, David was chosen to be a contestant on MTV’s Wade Robson Project and went on to become a top 4 finalist. His success on the show inspired him to move to Los Angeles and pursue his career in choreography and dance. Upon arriving in Los Angeles, David began training heavily at the renowned Millennium Dance Studio and was soon given his own class. Since then he has worked for artists such as Jay Sean, Beyonce, Miley Cyrus, Kelly Rowland, Sean Kingston and Busta Ryhmes and in the world of television/commercials on Dancing with the Stars, Pepsi, Adidas, Nike and American Idol. David was brought on by choreographer, Nancy O’Meara for recording artist Carly Rae Jepsen on performances for her #1 single “Call me Maybe.” Most recently, David worked with pop artist Shane Harper (“Good Luck Charlie”) on his video, “Dancing in the Rain” and tour. He is working closely with Midnight Red who are poised to become one of the best American bands to emerge out of the new boy band era and has been tapped to choreograph Jesse McCartney’s upcoming tour. When not working in the States, he has served as a judge and choreographer on Germany’s hit show “VIVA Dancestars” as well as choreographer on “So You Think You Can Dance” (Ukraine). Always intrigued by the creation process, David has also been pursuing his career as a director. He recently directed projects for Victoria Duffield (platinum selling Canadian artist), the Kidzbop World Tour for Disney, Teen Choice Awards for Sean Kingston, The Monsters of Hip Hop Show (Los Angeles), and working in various venues directing alongside the likes of Jamal Sims, Marty Kudelka, Luther Brown, and Tabitha & Napoleon.\n\n@kingofkrump Christopher ‘Lil C’ Toler is best known as being one of the pioneers of krumping, not to mention his choreography and judging on So You Think You Can Dance.
