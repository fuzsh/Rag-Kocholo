        "text": "Various Artists \"200 YEARS FIDDLIN': AMERICAN HERITAGE BI-CENTENNIAL OLDTIME FIDDLE ALBUM\" (AHMC/American Heritage Music Corporation, 1976) (LP)\n\nJust like it says, a really swell set of old-timey and bluegrass-ish fiddle music, showcasing several different regional styles, with a lot more texture and subtlety than you might anticipate. Plenty of well-known violinists, all champions of this or that competition, including a few folks from Canada. Sam Bush, Jana Jae, Lonnie Pierce, Loyd Wanzer, Bill Yohey... and the list goes on. Also some cool pickers backing them up, such as Dan Crary, Alan Munde, Wayne Stewart, etc. Recommended!\n\nVarious Artists \"A NIGHT AT THE HAYRIDE\" (Hayride Records, 1977-?) (LP)\n\n(Produced by Johnny James)\n\nThis album showcased four of the younger artists on the Louisiana Hayride in the late 1970s, backed by a house band called Catfish South... Although these folks were pretty obscure, minor-league newbies at the time, at least two of them ascended briefly into the big time: singers Craig Dillingham and Micki Fuhrman both got deals in Nashville and while they weren't the biggest stars, they did make an impression. Fuhrman, who was fifteen when she joined the Hayride and sixteen when this album was recorded, got signed first. Her first chart hit actually came on the Hayride label, 1978's \"Leave While I'm Sleeping,\" which barely broke into the Top 100. But it was enough to get her a deal with MCA, though her solo album didn't do much better and she left the commercial country scene in favor of a more stable career singing gospel music. Dillingham's break came a few years later, after he signed to Curb Records, but even though his singles did well -- getting him into the Top Forty -- Curb shelved his album and he returned to the Texas scene, where he became better known as a songwriter. But hey, here they are in their younger years, bright-eyed and hopeful on the stage of one of country's most venerable live shows.\n\nVarious Artists \"A PARTY WITH CHAPARRAL\" (Chaparral Records, 1979-?) (LP)\n\nA collection of country-adjacent square dance recordings on the Chaparral label from Plano, Texas, including callers and artists such as Ken Bower, Jerry Haag, Beryl Main, Gary Shoemake, John Winter and Wanda Winter, with musical backing by fiddler Johnny Gimble a group he led called The Road Runner Band. I'm not sure, but Gimble may have had an ownership interest in the label... he seems to have played on a majority of their records...\n\nVarious Artists \"AIN'T GOT TIME TO LOSE: FIRST EDITION OKLAHOMA PRISON ALBUM\" (TSR, 1980) (LP)\n\n(Produced by Carolyn Snow & Leo Brower)\n\nFunded in part by an NEA grant, this collection features country and other stuff from the folks in the Washington County Correctional Facility, located in Bartlesville, Oklahoma. I'm not sure, but I think some of the performers may have included correctional officers as well as prisoners.\n\nVarious Artists \"AIN'T WE GOT FUN!\" (Sounds Fantastic/Q-95 Records, 1979) (LP)\n\n(Produced by Stephen Beck & Sonny Campbell)\n\nThis country compilation was sponsored by a local radio station in Decatur, Illinois, Q-95, which amazingly enough remained a country station for over four decades(!) after this set was recorded in the Summer of 1979. The featured artists included producer Sonny Campbell, who performs six songs, and Leland Glazebrook, who is featured on four others, with two more tracks featuring The Gator Alley Band, a family group which included sisters Dawna, Debbie and Dina Nelson, as well as Dwayne Nelson on bass. The house band seems to have been made up of producer Stephen Beck, who provided the string arrangements, Sonny Campbell on guitar and vocals, Roy Clayton (keyboards and saxophone), Dave Knowles (rhythm guitar), Harry Marshall (drums), Mike Sparth (steel guitar), and Charley Wilson on bass. I don't think this is the same Sonny Campbell who recorded an album in Newark, New Jersey, back in the 'Sixties... but it could be: that guy was involved in radio as well. This appears to have been Leland Glazebrook's only record, although the Nelson family definitely kept at it, recording an album a few years later, simply billing themselves as Gator Alley.\n\nVarious Artists \"AMERICAN SONG FESTIVAL: 1976\" (American Song Festival, Inc., 1976) (LP)\n\nThis was an odd memento of a multi-genre songwriting contest founded in 1973 by music business producer-manager Larry Goldblatt, who apparently envisioned the event as an American equivalent of the Eurosong competition. The American Song Festival had a pretty checkered - and short - run: the first year it completely fell apart and the entrance fees were refunded to the contestants. But Goldblatt got it together in '74 and staged a live event that, though plagued by production glitches, still yielded enough good footage that a television special was broadcast on the ABC network, and an album called Winners came out on the Buddah label, with album art, liner notes and everything. That first year had some legit star-power, but by 1975 Goldblatt had dropped out, and the names on the marquee got distinctly more obscure. By '76 possibly the best-known artist was folkie singer-songwriter Casey Kelly, who had cut a couple of Americana-ish albums a few years earlier, and whose name caught my eye when I saw this in the dollar bin at my local Record Hut. His track, \"Polly,\" turned out to be a dud, a goofy, toss-off novelty number, though the other artist I was intrigued by, DC twangster Liz Meyer (1952-2011) delivers a fairly strong country number, \"She's On Barroom Duty (And She Always Gets Her Man),\" a duet with J. B. Morrison. Most of the other tracks are fairly generic '70s AOR -- eclectic but unremarkable, and maybe a bit desperate sounding overall. By this time there were no real liner notes, just the artist's names and song titles on the inner labels, and a thin banner on the otherwise blank back cover that mentions that these tracks were taken off another live TV special. It's all very minimal, and whoever took over the franchise probably had these LPs pressed for the artists to use for their own promotions efforts; it's doubtful many were sent out to radio or the press. A couple of other tracks have a country flavor to them, in an eclectic 'Seventies mish-moshy kinda way, though the real appeal might be for folks who dig '70s soft-pop and AOR and might groove out on this gaggle of obscure would-be one-hit wonders. There's also a Bicentennial song, \"Happy Birthday USA,\" in case anyone is keeping tabs on those. There was a 1977 follow-up album, though I dunno if there was any country material on that one. The Liz Meyer track should definitely be reissued by someone, somewhere.\n\nVarious Artists \"A NIGHT AT THE EDDIE BOND RANCH\" (Tab Record Company, 19--?) (LP)\n\n(Produced by Eddie Bond)\n\nAnother obscuro-oddity from Memphis, Tennessee... Ex-rockabilly country singer < href= \"../../countryartists/bond_eddie_01.html\">Eddie Bond did apparently have his own ranch, out on West Mitchell Road... Whether it was a live music venue, a recording studio, or what, I'm not sure, but regardless, this is kind of a fun little album. By and large, the participants seem to have been real, live good old boys, charmingly unpolished, amateur musicians, dudes with thick rural accents and a relaxed, down home vibe. By and large they're kind of indistinguishable (although one guy sang with a lisp, which is kinda cute) though a couple of them had rather colorful names, such as Cousin Bo-Jack and Major Pruett, along with the more prosaic Dale Beaty, Bobby Davis, Leon Griffin and Wilford Ray. The backing band, The Stompers, was a rock-solid country crew, with plenty of steel guitar for those who like that kinda thing. Standing out from the pack was gal singer Sandi Stevens, who sounds quite a bit like Skeeter Davis on her lone number, \"Tonight I'll Celebrate.\" Bond steals the show with a remarkable divorce/breakup song, \"I'm Free,\" while Cousin Bo-Jack (Bobby) Killingsworth plays two songs, one at the end of each side of the original LP. Apparently it was Killingsworth who introduced Eddie Bond to rough-and-tumble lawman Buford Pusser, leading to Bond recording the hit single, \"The Ballad of Buford Pusser,\" which doubtless helped with a few payments on the old ranch, and probably helped finance this album. Anyway, good stuff here.\n\nVarious Artists \"ARKANSAS JAMBOREE, v.1\" (ALP Records, 19--?) (LP)\n\n(Produced by Johnny James)\n\nIt's hard to pinpoint the release date on this locals-only compilation album -- from the cover photo, I'd guess anywhere from 1969-72... The more contemporary cover songs include \"Harper Valley PTA\" and Merle Haggard's \"Working Man Blues,\" which were hits in 1968 and '69, respectively... So late '69 or early 1970 are strong possibilities... Anyway, this is a real indie outing, with unknowns galore, presumably attached to one of the many live regional variety shows that still dotted the map, back in the Me Decade... Little Rock's original Arkansas Jamboree radio program ran from 1946-1960; I'm not sure how much of a direct connection there was between that show and this album.\n\nVarious Artists \"ATHENS HOMETOWN ALBUM\" (LRS Recording Studio, 1980) (LP)\n\n(Produced by Louis Ralph Stevens)\n\nA compilation of indie country and bluegrass artists from Athens County, Ohio, including Diane Andolsek, A Touch Of Grass, The Expanding Band, Hobson's Choice, Jeannie Jeffers, J. D. Jewell, Doug Lovelace, Terry McAuley and Scott Minar. A house band featuring guitarist Terry McAuley and piano player Louis Ralph Stevens provides backing on many of the tracks, though some of the performers brought their own musicians into the sessions... The overall vibe is pretty bluegrass-y, with some real-deal, backwoods old-timers participating, as well as plenty of young'uns. The set also includes some folkie protest tunes, such as J. D. Jewell's \"Darling Of The Hippies,\" which posits that the longhairs and the hillbillies actually have a lot of common interests. Not a lot of hard country material on here, but still a pretty sweet album.\n\nVarious Artists \"AUGIE MEYERS PRESENTS SAN ANTONIO SATURDAY NIGHT\" (Sonet Records, 1985) (LP)\n\n(Produced by Augie Meyers)\n\nFlaco Jimenez, Los Paisanos, Los Hermanos Barron and Los Formales get three tracks each on this Latin-oriented Tex-Mex set...\n\nVarious Artists \"A WAGON LOAD OF OLD TIME COUNTRY MUSIC\" (Big Valley Barn, 1982-?) (LP)\n\n(Produced by Carl Bean)\n\nThis one's more on the bluegrass/old-timey side of things, but with a fascinating and compelling back-story... Billed as a set of \"East Tennessee music,\" this album was a collaboration between the president of the Museum Of Appalachia, John Rice Irwin, and Carl Bean, a high school coach from Clinton, Tennessee, who in the early 1970s founded the Big Valley Barn show, a humble, unpretentious venue for regional bluegrass and old-timey music. Bean sings on about half the tracks, with numerous others chiming in, including Tennessee and Kentucky locals such as Bob Cox, Elizabeth Irwin, dobro player Monroe Queener, comedian Ray Rutherford, Jay and Janie Ward, as well as several bands: the Museum Of Appalachia Band, Rollin' Grass, and the Big Valley Boys. The brother-sister duo of Mack and Willie Sievers were veterans of the old days, originally from a family band called the Tennessee Ramblers, which recorded numerous 78s during the Depression, on big labels such as Brunswick and Vocalion. Mack & Willie also recorded and performed as a duo in the 1930s and '40s, with Willie Sievers being credited as one of the most prominent early women guitar players in country music history. The liner notes say that James \"Mack\" Sievers was 78 years old when this LP came out -- which would according to some sources mean that this album came out in 1982, which sounds a little late. (Anyone know for sure?) Anyway, it's a cool document of a lively scene of dedicated regional preservationists. Cool music, too!\n\nVarious Artists \"BAKERSFIELD REBELS -- LATE 1960s GEMS\" (Ace/Big Beat Records, 2004)\n\nAn archival collection with rarities from The Gosdin Brothers, Billy Mize, Gib Guilbeau, and numerous obscure artists, often backed by Gilbeau and pals such as guitarist Clarence White... These tracks were originally recorded for producer Gary S. Paxton's short-lived label, Bakersfield International Productions, which delved into the prototypical country-rock sound in the years before the style had a name. Uncle Buck would be proud.\n\nVarious Artists \"BAKERSFIELD'S BIG GUITARS\" (Jasico Records, 1962-?)\n\nNot so much Buck Owens and Wynn Stewart-style Bakersfield as a gathering of fancy pickers from the Hollywood rock scene who were in the orbit of pop impresario Gary S. Paxton, who put this album out. Paxton recruited guys from the Sunset Strip to play on a string of budget-label albums and one-off projects, and several of his best-known artists are on here, including dudes like pedal steel whiz Red Rhodes, and guitarist Dennis Payne, who wrote about half the tracks on this album.\n\nVarious Artists \"BAKERSFIELD'S FIRST ANNUAL COUNTRY MUSIC AWARDS SHOW\" (Country Town Records, 1974) (LP)\n\n(Produced by Jay Allbright)\n\nThis concert recording from December 10, 1974 was emceed by Mayf Nutter, with local artists honoring Bill Woods, a hometown hero who had been twanging it up since the late 1940s, an era when he (and others) wore big buckskin coats with long leather fringes. Woods was a musician as well as a club owner, and his Bakersfield honkytonk, the Bill Woods Corral, hosted countless country acts including touring stars and locals Okies alike. The liner notes (which neglect to tell us which musicians play on this album) include praise from Bonnie Owens, one of many Central Valley musicians who felt indebted to Woods for his help over the years...\n\nVarious Artists \"THE BAKERSFIELD YEARS\" (Album Concepts, 1978)\n\nA super-obscuro album, apparently assembled from several singles of mostly lesser-known West Coast artists. Best known is Gib Gilbeau of Burrito Brothers fame, who contributes four tracks to the collection; Eldon Fault, Chuck Morgan and a group called The Spencers each add two songs of their own. Dunno much about any of these other folks... Chuck Morgan cut some tracks in the early 'Seventies for the Alshire label, which makes me think he may have been one of Alshire's army of anonymous studio musicians drawn from the whole Palomino nightclub scene, though that's just me speculating. Eldon Fault worked with Gilbeau earlier, notably on the Vietnam-era single, \"Welcome Home, POW,\" which has been anthologized on a number of war-related compilations. Fault seems to have headed out for Nashville right in the late 'Seventies, cutting at least one single for the independent Boll Weevil label. Similarly, Dave and Lou Spencer worked with producer Gary Paxton in the late '60s and were also in the orbit of Gilbeau and the Nashville West band, but seem to have melted into the background along with the others.\n\nVarious Artists \"THE BAKERSFIELD SOUND: COUNTRY MUSIC CAPITAL OF THE WEST: 1940-1974\" (Bear Family Records, 2019)\n\nVarious Artists \"BAR DE L'OUEST: EN SPECTACLE\" (World Records, 1979) (LP)\n\n(Produced by Guy Charbonneau)\n\nA pretty obscure live set recorded at the Bar De L'Ouest, a honkytonk club in Port Gatineau, Ottawa that opened in July, 1979 and promptly put out this album as a souvenir set. Though billed as some of Canada's \"top country artists,\" these Outaouais country crooners are pretty unfamiliar. The lineup included Claude Baune, Josee Beaulne, Joselyne Belland, Dale Culli, J. C. Fontain, Ted Larabie, Yvette Martin, Rae Palmer, Sam Samson and Allan Wood, mostly singing English-language covers of Nashville hits, though there is one track with a French title. The World Records label was, I believe, a notorious \"tax scam\" outfit, although this release has unusually informative liner notes compared to their other albums. Great cover art!!\n\nVarious Artists \"BARNEY STEEL'S -- LIVE IN REDWOOD CITY\" (Fat Records, 1983) (LP)\n\n(Produced by Danne Ventura & Michael Schwalm)\n\nA compilation of live performances from the San Fran Bay Area, featuring a mix of rock groups (Merlin, The Lifters) and blues/rock bands such as Stu Blank & His Nasty Habits and the Charles Ford Band, along with alt-country pranksters Chuck Wagon & The Wheels, who play three of their songs, \"My Girl Passed Out In Her Food,\" \"Rasta Mother,\" and a medley of \"Ghost Riders/Rawhide/Ballad Of Paladin.\" The shows were recorded in Redwood City, south of the City, but the label was based in Sausalito, on the other side of the Bay.\n\nVarious Artists \"BERKELEY FARMS\" (Folkways Records, 1972) (LP)\n\nA classic set of old-timey and uber-folk music from Berkeley, California, featuring a bunch of bands with goofy names such as The Bayou Croakers, The Phresno Philharmonic, The Spare Change Boys, as well as the highly-regarded Larry Hanks, who was a real-live graduate of Berkeley High.\n\nVarious Artists \"THE BEACH BALL LIVE\" (Beach Ball Records, 1979) (LP)\n\n(Produced by Bruce McCoy & Bob Werner)\n\nA live recording from a folk-y club in Newport Beach, California, featuring separate performances from Bob Gulley, Bruce McCoy, Stan Orlo, and Kurt Steinbeck, with backing by a house band that included Jan Ashley (drums), Paul Bishop (conga drums... yikes), Larry Hanson (piano), Sal Hernandez (bass) and Gary Madison on keyboards. Stylistically it's a mixed bag, and largely tilts away from true twang, although some tunes drift ashore that give this disc some country cred, including \"Desperado\" and \"Margaritaville,\" though these are balanced by stuff like Tom Lehrer's \"Vatigan Rag,\" \"The MTA Song,\" \"Help Me Rhonda\" and \"On Broadway.\" (In general, a good rule of thumb when you see any roots record with conga drums in the lineup, it might be wise to be a little skeptical...) On the plus side, these guys seemed to be having fun and didn't take themselves too seriously, so you get a nice snapshot of an informal live band at a humble local club. The Beach Ball apparently opened back in 1971, and made it at least to the end of the decade... More power to 'em!\n\nVarious Artists \"THE BEST IN FLORIDA COUNTRY\" (Janlynn Productions, 1976) (LP)\n\n(Produced by Lin Haley)\n\nA pay-to-play album featuring singers such as Laurie Harvey, Pete Howell, Boogie Mann, Lee Pollard and Ike Walker, well-meaning locals singing alongside a studio band called \"The Starbackers.\" Each of the singers get two songs -- almost all covers of standards, though one track, \"Of Course I Do,\" was written by producer Lin Haley. The label also put out several singles; not sure how many of those included artists on this album...\n\nVarious Artists \"THE BEST OF BRANSON\" (Silver Dollar Records, 1986) (LP)\n\n(Produced by Bob Millsap & Rodney Dillard)\n\nA live set featuring performers from several of the most prominent variety shows of the Ozarks country tourism scene... singers and pickers from the Baldknobbers Jamboree, the Branson Opry House, the Brachler Music Show, the Plummer Family Country Music Show, the Roy Clark Theater, Silver Dollar City and other venues. The music is a mix of new country, old stuff and gospel. It's mostly a very commercially-oriented, very 'Eighties-sounding set, with Oak Ridge Boys/Alabama soundalikes galore, some goofy cover songs and ambitious but derivative originals... I think my favorite track is the topically-oriented \"The Family Farm,\" an original by John Paul Cody in which he doesn't just get all Farm Aid about it, but also tries to prove his authenticity by including lyrics about mortgages and harvests and the financial nuts-and-bolts of modern-day agriculture... A little bit clunky? Yeah, that's why it's fun. Anyway... This is a good snapshot of what the various Branson acts sounded like at the height of the slick-sounding '80s. Not quite my kinda country, but an accurate portrait of the lower rungs of the commercial country scene.\n\nVarious Artists \"THE BEST OF COUNTRY SWING, v.1 -- AS SELECTED BY DANCING DAN\" (J. R. Records, 1980) (LP)\n\nA swell selection of late '70s/early '80s hippiebilly... Most of the artists on here are from Tucson, Arizona's desert twang scene, including Chuck Wagon & The Wheels, The Frank & Woody Show, The Saddle City Band, Billy Odom (of the bands Straight Shot and Loose Boots), The David Dollar Revue, Duncan Stitt and Two Crisp Bills... The odd man out is Deadly Ernest and his band the Honky Tonk Heroes, who were from Ohio... But I ain't complaining!\n\nVarious Artists \"THE BEST OF SAN ANTONIO, TEXAS\" (Kevin Kat Music, 19--?) (LP)\n\nAugie Meyers and Doug Sahm are on here, though I think the rest of the artists aren't all necessarily \"country\" musicians...\n\nVarious Artists \"BIG COUNTRY\" (Lee Mac Records, 1968-?) (LP)\n\n(Produced by Lee Nichols & Mac Sanders)\n\nA locals-heavy compilation album sponsored by radio station KFRM, out of Wichita, Kansas... The talent lineup was apparently drawn from the station's on-air staff, with with backing by Duane \"Pitiful\" Pollard (electric guitar), Jack Reed (sax) and Mike Stocker (drums). The singers include bandleader/station execs Lee Nichols and Mack Sanders, Jeanie Pierson, Maxine And Jan, Abram Burnett, Jerry Minshall, Gene Morris, and singer Billy C. Cole, a popular DJ who also contributed the liner notes.\n\nVarious Artists \"BIG RIVER MISCELLANY\" (Pro-Am Recording, 1980) (LP)\n\nA Midwestern-produced charity album raising funds for muscular dystrophy research, recorded in Missouri for a label in Quincy, Illinois, a small town on the Mississippi River border, near Hannibal. This album is at least partly country, so it's worth having on our radar... The musicians were drawn from various small rural towns on both sides of the river, though few of them seem to have had very active professional careers. This seems to be the only record most of them ever made, although a few made singles of their own, including former 'Fifties rockabilly Ernie Nowlin, a guy named Jerry Lemmon, and garage rocker-gone-country-singer Rod Hibbert. Mostly, though, this is a very, very local affair, and pretty darn obscure. Apparently only about five hundred copies were pressed, and many were given out for free at blood drives and similar events, including a bunch that were donated to radio station KPCR, in Hannibal. (This back history was revealed when a Quincy record store found a box of leftover albums, prompting a story in the local newspaper in 2020. I haven't heard the album yet, but if anyone want to donate a copy, I'd be glad to give it a spin!) [Note: Discogs lists this as No-One Can Do It All Alone (Big River Miscellany, A Collection Of Original Music By Local Artists To Benefit The Fight Against Muscular Dystrophy) but I think that's a bit much. I'd go for \"Big River Miscellany,\" since that's the title in large print. Plus, it's a lot less kloodgy.]\n\nVarious Artists \"BOB HOOD PRESENTS THE WNOX TENNESSEE BARN DANCE\" (Golden Crest Records, 1961) (LP)\n\nBob Hood was the program director at Knoxville, Kentucky's AM radio station, WNOX, which was a pop-oriented station for much of its history, but hosted a country-oriented program called \"The WNOX Barn Dance,\" dating back to the early 1940s. This album features local talent drawn from that show, largely unknown musicians, including The Carey Sisters, The Rhythmaires, Johnny Shelton and L. E. White, each act showcased on two tracks, with Bob Wood himself performing on \"Everglades\" and \"It's Nothing To Me.\" The album was plugged a couple of times in Cashbox magazine, but remains a pretty obscure release.\n\nVarious Artists \"BOCOMO MEDICINE SHOW: MID-SUMMER NIGHT, 1979\" (BoCoMo Musician's Guild, 1979) (LP)\n\nVarious Artists \"BOCOMO MEDICINE SHOW: ELIXIR\" (BoCoMo Musician's Guild, 1979) (LP)\n\n(Produced by Bill Hinson, Neal Miller, Bob Pruitt & Larry Rennells)\n\nNot entirely sure what the deal was with this album... It's one of those weird independent records that's sort of a compilation and sort of by a band, sort of a little country, and sort of mostly blues-rock. Very mysterious. It's from Missouri, though, and what caught my attention was the participation of Columbia/KCMO local Al Jolly, of the Jolly Brothers band, a group that was definitely country for a while, then just went rock in the 'Eighties. \"BoCoMo\" refers to Boone Country, Missouri, where Columbia is located... This album was recorded at a venue in Columbia called The Road Apple Party Palace... Al Jolly doesn't seem to have been involved with the other BoCoMo album (above) which came out at basically the same time...\n\nVarious Artists \"BORDER COUNTRY\" (Golden Crest Records, 19--?) (LP)\n\n(Produced by Gerry Hass & George McLellan)\n\nCountry-twang from around Mount Iron, Minnesota... This album showcases four bands: County Fair, Country Roundup, Gravel, and Wildwood, with each group contributing two or three songs. Album producer George McLellan was a veteran of the Great Lakes 1960s garage rock scene who \"went country\" at some point, forming the group Gravel, a band that apparently only recorded on this one compilation album, which seems to be the case with most of the folks on here. The back cover describes this as \"Iron Range country,\" which refers to a region near Lake Superior known for its iron-ore mining; the front cover shows a picture of the entrance to the Superior National Forest, which possibly had a few nearby local bars where these bands played. No date that I could see, but these folks definitely crossed over the hippie era at some point, and many had a southern-rock look to 'em. A few Waylon Jennings covers, as well as the 1977 Marshall Tucker Band hit, \"Heard It In A Love Song,\" so I'd guess anywhere between 1977-81 on this one...\n\nVarious Artists \"BOSTON GETS STONED: PRODUCED BY THE JIMMY MILLER\" (Botown Records, 1995)\n\n(Produced by Jimmy Miller)\n\nA Rolling Stones tribute album featuring nineteen local bands, heavy on the rock side of things. But along with garage punks like the Lyres and numerous poppier rockers, there are also some back-in-the-old-days country outlaws, notably the Sour Mash Boys band and John Lincoln Wright, who had albums of their own... back in the goodle days.\n\nVarious Artists \"BUFFALO TRAILS: ALBERTA 75 SASKACHEWAN\" (Doug Wong Music, 1980) (LP)\n\nVarious Artists \"BURIED COUNTRY: 1.5\" (Festival Records, 2015) (CD)\n\nVarious Artists \"BUSTER JENKINS ROCKY MOUNTAIN JAMBOREE\" (Band Box Records, 1962-?) (LP)\n\nEmanating out of Denver, Colorado's KLAK radio station, The Rocky Mountain Jamboree was hosted by bluegrass fiddler and deejay Buster Jenkins and had been broadcast every Saturday night for three years by the time this souvenir album came out. Though he's credited as composer on a couple of tracks and plays one gospel song, his real forte seems to have been as emcee and bandleader -- the liner notes inform us that Jenkins was a seven-time championship fiddler and also played banjo and guitar. The artists in this cast lineup are pretty obscure: Max Allison, Johnny Chase, Doris Fischer, Charles Gordon, Roy Green, Edie Hammons, Jim Moore and Bill Stephens -- hardly household names, to be sure, but that's what makes records like this so much fun. Other than Buster Jenkins, who went on to lead his own band and to cut a few albums, the only other artist I could find that made their own records was Edie Hammons, a decent hillbilly singer who cut a couple of late '60s singles for producer Ray Peterson.\n\nVarious Artists \"CAHOOTS COUNTY: TUPPERWARE 1981 BIG COUNTRY JUBILEE (Dart Industries, 19--?) (LP)\n\n(Produced by Terry Cox & Tupperware Home Parties)\n\nDestined to disappoint both country fans and Tupperware hosts alike, this is apparently a souvenir album for an industrial musical commissioned by Tupperware back in the early 'Eighties, part of an annual series of shows called the Tupperware Jubilee,, with different themes each year. Alas, there are no details provided about where, when (or if) this show was staged live, though industrial theater fans may be a bit dismissive since only one song, the closing number, actually mentions the product, and even then only in passing. Some songs perkily drape the show in a gauzy haze of domesticity (tangentially linking this happy home life to the product?) while others drift into less Rockwell-ian country themes, mostly mild and mildly humorous battle-of-the-sexes novelty numbers. The performances are brisk and somewhat insincere: the gals in particular don't sound like real country singers -- rather, approximating what they probably thought of as hick music by forcing their voices to become shrill and grating, in a dismissive, manic mis-interpretation of country music as \"bad\" singing. Despite the whole outsider-looking-in vibe, there are a few tracks that actually have good lyrics and could've credibly been covered by a real country artist. The best of these is \"Money Is The Root Of All Evil,\" performed by Russ Wheeler and Joe Hudgins, who had a legit country background, having cut some singles back int he early 'Sixties. A bunch of other folks performed in the show, none of whom I recognize, so I'm guessing theater people, but not country folk. The book and arrangements were by Pat Tahaney and Lindsey Meehan, who worked on several Tupperware Jubilee albums in the late 'Seventies and early 'Eighties, often working with many of the same musicians listed on this album. Anyway, this maybe isn't as terrible as I've implied, but it's also not all that great. Kinda condecending.\n\nVarious Artists \"CALIFORNIA COUNTRY KLASSIX\" (ITW Records, 1982) (LP)\n\n(Produced by Ian Whitcomb & Andy Wickham)\n\nThis nutty little outing comes from one-time one-hit wonder and pop music scholar Ian Whitcomb (1941-2020) who in 1965 scored a somewhat improbable Top Ten US hit with his comedically fey blues-rock single, \"You Turn Me On,\" and later turned to prose when the fickle fates of the music industry turned their gaze away from his career. Whitcomb spent a few years researching his (excellent) (and highly recommended) overview of the growth of Western popular music, After The Ball, and having gotten the book published in 1972, was once again looking for musical projects to pursue. As outlined in Whitcomb's charmingly discursive liner notes, he was chilling up in Northern California with fellow UK expat Andy Wickham (a highly successful record exec at Warner Brothers) when they stumbled across a local gal in Sonora, CA singing in a country bar, and decided to sign her to Wickham's label. They flew her to Nashville and cut a few tracks which were released under the name Debbie Dawn, which although they sold poorly became the kernel for further incursions into California twang in the Whitcomb style. Most of the songs on this album were composed by Whitcomb and produced by Wickham, with a slate of otherwise unknown artists that included \"singing fireman\" Howdy Glenn, another country gal by the name of Kenni Huskey, and a couple of other artists -- Corky Mayberry and Norvis Reptile -- who I suspect were actually Mr. Whitcomb in cowboy drag. ITW was Whitcomb's own label, and mostly served as a vehicle for his swimming-against-the-tide solo work, as he increasing became obsessed with ragtime and music-hall material. But it's sure nice he took the time to compile this set of outsider twang when he had the chance!\n\nVarious Artists \"CAL'S CORRAL SOUVENIR ALBUM, v.1\" (Cal's Corral, 19--?) (LP)\n\nA hugely successful car dealer from Pasadena, California, multi-millionaire show host Cal Worthington (1920-2013) sponsored a long-running TV program which ran on station KTLA from 1959 to 1972, spotlighting local Southern California talent as well as visiting stars from the hillbilly pantheon. This LP includes tracks by Buck Owens and Fred Maddox, although I'm not sure if they were exclusive to the Corral show, or taken from recordings they made elsewhere. But most of the artists seem to have been regulars on the show -- Billy Armstrong, guitarist Gene Davis, Benny Walker, Sammy Masters, Shorty Bacon singing a version of \"Window Up Above,\" West Coaster Billy Mize singing \"Planet Called Desire,\" and the Clairborne Brothers Gospel Quartet rounding things out with \"Give The World A Smile,\" as the last track on the record. Cal Worthington passed away in September, 2013, but left behind a legacy of live recordings, both audio and video that are worth tracking down. This album also features \"Ozark Rose,\" a track by Jenks \"Tex\" Carman, who was a regular on the show. There's no date on the disc, but \"Window Up Above\" was a hit for George Jones in 1960, so that helps date this release... a little bit, at least. Mr. Worthington owned a string of car dealerships, and empire that outlived him by just over a decade -- the last dealership to bear his name was finally sold in 2023.\n\nCalvin Gilmore/Various Artists \"CALVIN GILMORE PRESENTS THE CAROLINA OPRY, v.1\" (Candock Records, 1987) (LP)\n\n(Produced by Calvin Gilmore & Jim Rhodes)\n\nA souvenir album of one of the many mom'n'pop \"opry\"-style variety shows that dotted the landscape over the years... This one was out of Surfside Beach, South Carolina and featured bandleader Calvin Gilmore along with a group that includes Steve Templeton, Janet Smith and others. This one seems to be more of a \"band\" record, rather than a compilation - many of the same artists play on various tracks. I also think Gilmore may have gone on to become a gospel artist...\n\nCalvin Gilmore/Various Artists \"CALVIN GILMORE PRESENTS THE CAROLINA OPRY, v.2\" (Candock Records, 1988) (LP)\n\nVarious Artists \"THE CAROLINA COLLECTION: 91-AM WORD\" (Creative Arts Studio, 198--?) (LP)\n\nYes, but which of the Carolinas are we talking about?? Well, since this was recorded in Spartanburg, right near the border, there's a good chance these bands were from both states, or at least played gigs on either side of the state line. With band names like Animation and Revolution in the list, clearly this was not all country, but groups such as Bighorn (with a song called \"Carolina Cowboy\") and Lightnin' West add a little hope for us twangfans. Back in the 'Seventies, AM station WORD was Spartanburg's grooviest pop station; in later years they shifted into a format into perhaps more befitting their chatty-sounding callsign: sports talk.\n\nVarious Artists \"THE CARWIN COUNTRY SHOW\" (Parklane Records, 1973) (LP)\n\n(Produced by Carl French & Rodger Wilhoit)\n\nAn odd little album purporting to be a showcase for \"the Carwin Country Show,\" though it looks more like a vehicle for the songwriting aspirations of producers Carl French and Rodger Wilhoit, who assembled a who's-who of obscure singers from Cleveland, Ohio to record their work. Carl French had a track record that preceded him, with several songs recorded in the mid-1960s by artists such as Jack Campbell and Patti Walker on mainstream pop labels such as Jubilee and Ronn Records. He seems to have retreated to the Midwest to set up his own label, Parklane, which seems later to have morphed into \"CC International,\" which I'd guess is a permutation of Carwin Country. Campbell recorded several singles for Parklane (and CC International) and is featured on this album, as is Rodger Wilhoit, who later cut a full album in '74, after releasing a string of singles in the early 'Seventies. Other singers on this disc include Windy Blevins, Sandra Bonham, Earlene Frost, Janie Lee, Dick Lemley, Gene Perine, Kathy Shaw and Tim Stacy, with Campbell and Blevins being the only ones recording their own material, while Janie Lee sings a tune penned by Gene Perine -- all the others are songs co-composed by French and Wilhoit. (Also see the GET COUNTRY-FIVED collection, below, for more of the Carwin story.)\n\nVarious Artists \"CATAHOULA COUNTRY TIME\" (Zundak Records, 1968-?) (LP)\n\nIn 1962, veteran Louisiana bluegrass musician Don Wiley and his musical partner J. C. Henderson started up their own music venue, the Catahoula Country Music Show, a mom'n'pop venue in Hendersonville, LA that staged live concerts featuring both local and national artists. The show was also broadcast on two local TV stations, KALB, Alexandria and KNOE, Monroe, although I don't know when this arrangement started or how long the Show stayed together. This album and its companion disc, VOICES OF CATAHOULA (below) seem to have come out at roughly the same time, maybe around 1968-69. The cast on this album also included Gene King, J. C. Henderson and the Henderson Brothers, Nobby Dean Massey, Lawrence Roberts and the Roberts Brothers, Junior Trisler, Don Wiley and Ruble Wright... The liner notes are a bit vague, but I think most if not all these tracks were cover songs.\n\nVarious Artists \"CHICAGO COUNTRY -- LIVE FROM THE ROCK-IN-HORSE\" (Chapparal Records, 1969-?) (LP)\n\n(Produced by Brien Fisher & Laddie Oleson)\n\nEd Wheeler's Rock-In-Horse was a country venue located in the lounge of the Park Arms Hotel, in Franklin Park, Illinois, right next to O'Hare International airport. This live album captured a bunch of Chicago-area locals, including the WGN Barndance's emcee Red Blanchard, former rockabilly rebel Hayden Thompson, Don Barnett & The Nu-Jays, picker Arthur Smith, gal singers Bonnie Ferguson, Queenie Stewart and Dottie Wood, as well as fellas like Sonny Blaylock, Bill Blough, Chuck Burke, Butch Butler, the duo of Doug & Earl, Jack Fisher, Billy Gee, and Jerry Wooters' Bluegrass Five... A real locals-only shindig!\n\nVarious Artists \"CIRCLE H RANCH PRESENTS: STREAKING SALLY\" (Dynamite Records, 1974) (LP)\n\n(Produced by Richie Burkhardt)\n\nA live album from a label in Norfolk, Nebraska... Artists include Richie Burkhardt, Martha Dee, Jim Hall and Bill Moore & The Kentuckians... I think Richie Burkhardt was a square dance caller, so this could be a square dance album, rather than a country set.\n\nVarious Artists \"CMA PRESENTS THE 4th ANNUAL FAN FAIR REUNION SHOW\" (Foundation Records, 1975) (LP)\n\n(Produced by Patty Hall, Jerry Bradley & Lou Bradley)\n\nIt was early days for the fabled Nashville \"Fan Fair\" event, and while later decades would have superstars on a par with Tim McGraw and Shania Twain rubbing elbows with the common folk, back in the '70s it was old-timers like Roy Acuff, Clyde Moody, Ernie Lee and Lulu Belle & Scotty doing the meet-and-greet and playing their old hits. The house band for this event was an all-pro crew dragged out of the studios for a few hours, including pickers and players like Fred Carter Jr., Johnny Gimble, Hal Rugg and Dale Sellers. The emcee was T. Tommy Cutrer, although Pee Wee King, Whitey Ford and others chimed in and introduced the artists.\n\nVarious Artists \"COLLECTORS ITEM: SONGS FROM THE TAVERNS OF THE PACIFIC NORTHWEST\" (Last Minute Record Company, 1975) (LP)\n\n(Produced by Ned Neltner)\n\nAlthough this isn't all strictly \"country\" stuff, there is plenty of twang in here, including a bit of '70s-style rockabilly retro. Includes artists from Portland, Seattle and Vancouver BC, such as the Cement City Cowboys, Rose & the Dirt Boys, Lance Romance and the Holy Modal Rounders-affiliated avant-nutkiks, Les Clamtones. Sounds pretty groovy!\n\nVarious Artists \"COLORADO FOLK\" (Biscuit City Records, 1973) (LP)\n\nThis was the first album on the soon-to-be-fabled Biscuit City label, which became home to many of Colorado's top folk and bluegrass musicians in the decade to come. With local artists including Grubstake, Dan McCrimmon, Katy Moffatt, and label founder Jim Ransom.\n\nVarious Artists \"COLORADO FOLK, v.2\" (Biscuit City Records, 1974) (LP)\n\nThis volume features Ruthie Allen, The City Limits Bluegrass Band, Pete McCabe, and the duo of Vince DeFrancis & Kathy DeFrancis.\n\nVarious Artists \"CONTRA COSTA COUNTRY\" (Ground Floor Records, 1982) (LP)\n\nA very nice, independently produced album of off-the-radar SF Bay Area country music, featuring artists such as Ambush, Larry Appl, Osage, The Silver Saddle Band and singer Judy Fields, who went onto a modestly successful career as a songwriter in Nashville. There's a nice variety of styles, with Larry Appl singing in a soft honkytonk crooner style reminiscent of Ed Bruce or Vern Gosdin, Osage offering two solid indiebilly songs, and Ambush and Silver Saddle getting into grittier, scrappier-sounding western swing and bar-band music. This seems to have really been a collective effort -- each artist or band gets a track on each side of the album, but there are some overlapping musicians from track to track, and a supportive, happy vibe throughout. A stronger record than you might think, from the rather modest album art!\n\nVarious Artists \"CO-OP HOOTENANNY\" (Century Custom Records, 1965) (LP)\n\nI'm looking for a clean (and affordable) copy of this record, as well as anyone who knows the background story about its making. This was apparently a live recording of a folk music hootenanny thrown on October 9, 1965 at the Berkeley Community Theater, with a bunch of locals no one has heard of since. The record was intended as a benefit for the University Students' Co-operative Association Building Fund, an institution founded in the 1930s to help students find affordable housing during the Great Depression. I guess times were still rough, for the coops at least, during the Free Speech Movement era, hence this record. The co-ops survived the 'Sixties and flourished, after a fashion, during the '70s, then arguably fell into decline in the following decade. In particular, the anarchic Barrington Hall was a notorious drug den and party house throughout the '80s, and was eventually closed by the Co-op Association in 1989/90 after years of conflict with neighbors and University officials. But that was all years away when this record was made, back in a simpler, calmer time called the Sixties. I assume that most of the artists on this album were co-op residents, but I'll get back to you when I get some more info...\n\nVarious Artists \"COSMIC AMERICAN MUSIC\" (Ariola Records, 1975) (LP)\n\nThough unsurprising by the modern-day standards of a reissue-saturated collector culture, at the time it came out, this European-market \"cosmic cowboy\" collection was pretty far-ranging and hip, with examples of many of the top-line leaders of the hippie-era country-rock scene. It's mostly branched off from two bands: The Flying Burrito Brother and the Byrds, although the connecting tissue between them, cosmic contrarian Gram Parsons, is not name-checked in the playlist. There are several tracks from Gene Clark, a few from the Burrito Brothers, and numerous side-projects of musicians in the Burrito Brothers orbit, like Gib Guilbeau, Sneaky Pete Kleinow, a pre-Firefall Rick Roberts, and the short-lived LA band Cold Steel. \"Mr. Tambourine Man\" isn't the first Byrds song I would think of for a set like this, but the compilers do get make-up points for tracking a pre-flyte tune from Chris Hillman's old bluegrass band, The Scottsville Squirrel Barkers, as well as a couple of Dillard & Clark tunes from Gene Clark's semi-solo years. Probably the only throw-you-for-a-loop selections are \"Whiskey, Whiskey,\" a slow, slightly dreary tune from Rita Coolidge's debut album, and the progressive newgrass band Country Gazettte covering Delaney & Bonnie's \"Never Ending Song Of Love.\" You probably don't need to obsess over tracking this one, down, but back in '75 it sure woulda come in handy.\n\nVarious Artists \"COUNTRY AND WEST COAST: THE BIRTH OF COUNTRY-ROCK\" (Ace/Big Beat Records, 2006)\n\nA decent overview of the late '60s country-rock scene, with an emphasis on West Coast artists, folkie bands and less well-known tracks. To be sure, there are some obvious touchpoints, such as guitarist Clarence White, ex-Monkee Michael Nesmith and various Gram Parsons-related projects, including the Flying Burrito Brothers, the Byrds, and the short-lived International Submarine Band. There are pleasant surprises as well: a few genuine obscurities such as Berkeley-based psychedelic folk-rockers Blackburn & Snow, The Spencers, and an unexpected track by The Corvettes (the super-jangly \"Beware Of Time\") as well as nods of the hat towards the Everly Brothers, Vern Gosdin and Ian & Sylvia. As always, the folks at Ace know their stuff, and try and add a little spice where they can.\n\nVarious Artists \"COUNTRY AND WESTERN CLASSICS\" (Master Classics Records, 195--?) (LP)\n\nA super old-fashioned showcase of East Coast country artists, released on an obscure label from Philadelphia. The big star here was Georgia-born singer-actor Ray Whitley (1901-1979) who starred in numerous cowboy-movie \"oaters\" back in the 1930s and '40s. Best known as the guy who wrote \"Back In The Saddle Again,\" Whitley had kind of a Jimmy Wakeley-ish persona and is spotlighted on two tracks here, although he recorded widely as a solo artist elsewhere. The other musicians included cowpokes Willis Meyers and Billy Wilson, accordionist Monte Rosci and a vocal duo called The Murray Sisters, as well as solo tracks from Shorty Warren, Larry Wayne, Carol Wynne and a few lineups of bands with generic names such as The Buckaroos and the Santa Fe Rangers. It's not clear if this album was a souvenir of a road show or local venue, or if it was just a random collection of minor regional artists. It does sound like most if not all the tracks were recorded in the same sessions -- the same chugga-chugga accordion seems to be on most tracks. Anyway, if you dig singing cowboy stuff such as Gene Autry and Roy Rogers, this anachronistic album might be right up your alley. Not sure when it came out, but it seems to be of early- to mid-'Fifties origin.\n\nVarious Artists \"COUNTRY AND WESTERN JAMBOREE\" (Custom Records, 1967) (LP)\n\nThis one doesn't quite fit the profile for this section, but it's still a fun record. I was hopeful that this would be one of those cheapo LPs on the Custom label with a bunch of country-rocker hippie types doing perfunctory run-throughs of country covers and song demos, but instead it's a semi-random collection of obscure hillbilly oldies, weird old recordings that were probably originally issued as singles in the 1950s and early '60s. I have no idea who's on this record (no credits) although I'm sure there are greater, smarter, better-er country-ologists out there who do know... There's at least one track by Eddie Dean, but there seem to be several other artists included. Whatever. It's great music, just not the crypto-country rock lovefest we might have wished for...\n\nVarious Artists \"COUNTRY AND WESTERN SONGS, v.1\" (Alshire/Somerset Records, 19--?) (LP)\n\nA deliciously cynical, endlessly enjoyable mashing together of three nondescript, cheapo-label country albums cobbled together from the Alshire Records demimonde. The three discs originally came out as separate albums -- Best Selling Country Hits, Country Hits, and Harper Valley PTA -- and this 3-LP set retains their original titles and track orders, as well as the complete lack of information about who the original \"hit artists\" were. Internet sleuths have identified a few of the musicians, though details are vague. Among those said to be on here are bluegrass/country-rock guitarist Clarence White and Rusty Adams, who were both working anonymously in Alshire's mysterious orbit, although countless other more nondescript pickers and singers are also included, probably mostly country-rock guys who were playing in bands at the Palomino Club and the Troubadour, who seem to have done a lot of work-for-hire on Alshire's various soundalike records. Along with a few random covers of big country hits (\"Only Daddy That'll Walk The Line,\" \"What's Made Milwaukee Famous,\" etc.) these discs are packed with original material, some of it brusquely tossed off, some of it infused with booze-addled brilliance, all of it shrouded under dodgy business practices and decades of intentionally haphazard record-keeping. A hefty chunk of these tracks were doubtless produced by Gary S. Paxton, but good luck tracking down the details. Anyway, I love these weird, shady albums, not just for their kitschy mystery qualities, but also for the music, which often includes really great stuff which has seldom gotten the respect it deserves. Still, even collector weirdoes like me may find themselves challenged by the slipshod production (and reproduction) of these tracks on this physical three-disc set -- many of the tracks have needlessly terrible sound quality, though sometimes that's part of the charm. Anyway, sometimes you can figure out who some of the artists were, and if I can track down the information on any of these tracks, I'll let you know.\n\nVarious Artists \"COUNTRY ARTISTS RECORDS INTERNATIONAL PRESENTS TOWN 'N' COUNTRY NITE HAWKS\" (Country Artists Records International, 1971-?) (LP)\n\n(Produced by Finley Duncan & Jim Foster)\n\nIn the early '70s, Florida state trooper Jim Foster hosted a country music TV show called \"Nite Hawks,\" which aired on Tampa's WLCY-TV-10 in the early 1970s. He also released a slew of singles and LPs featuring artists who performed on the show at various times. This disc is a companion to an earlier album JIM FOSTER'S TOWN 'N' COUNTRY NITE HAWKS (reviewed below) and featured Foster with a smaller, revamped lineup that featured gal singer Lorita Barlow, local deejay Bill Floyd, and cornpone humor from comedian Cuz'n Jim Johnson. The previous LP had featured a track by Chesley Carroll, who went on to record a couple of major-label solo albums; he doesn't perform on here, although he and his partner Shelley Carroll contribute three songs to this set. There's no date on the album but I'd guess it came out around 1971: Barlow and Floyd each recorded albums of their own in the 'Sixties, but cut singles for this label in '71, including Floyd's version of \"Kelly's Bar Again,\" which is one of the songs written by the Carrolls for this album. Lorita Barlow graduated high school in 1968 and hit the road looking for fame and fortune: a 1972 newspaper profile mentions her working in Florida before landing a gig in Detroit. She also cut a duet with Jim Foster called \"Kiss Him Twice,\" which is also included here, and later collaborated with producer Finley Duncan.\n\nVarious Artists \"THE COUNTRY COLLECTOR'S ALBUM\" (Cuca Records, 19--?) (LP)\n\nA late-1960s(?) collection featuring country artists from Wisconsin, mostly locals associated with the long-lived regional label, Cuca Records. Featured are little guys like Bobby Hodge, The Rice Family, Dick Sherwood, Curly Fields, the Country Cousins, the Goose Island Ramblers, Jack Leonard, Ed Cree and Joan Whitney, as well as big-timers Pee Wee King and Redd Stewart (King was originally a Wisconsinite, while his singer Redd Stewart was not... But hey, who's gonna tell him to leave the studio?)\n\nVarious Artists \"COUNTRY COMMENT\" (Charly Records, 1976) (LP)\n\nA really fun set of early 'Seventies country novelty songs, largely gleaned from Shelby Singleton's scrappy, idiosyncratic Plantation Records label... There are a few faded old stars (Rex Allen, T. Tommy Cutrer, James O'Gwynn, Webb Pierce...) a bunch of folks in or around the second tier of fame (Rusty Adams, Rod Bernard, Johnny Credit, and ex-soul singer Linda Martell, who would go on to be the first African-American gal to sing on the Grand Ol' Opry, and even rockabilly old-timers like Sleepy LaBeef. These were generally folks whose early 'Seventies careers had them ping-ponging between labels and leaving a lot of uncollected, one-off singles in their wake. I picked this album up in the early '80s and it was a real touchstone for me, a funky, funny set of fairly hip tunes, including a lot of stuff that got a ton of airplay on my local freeform hippie country radio station, KFAT. These include goofy bits like \"Hello, I'm Johnny Credit,\" two great pro-twang propaganda tunes from James O'Gwynn, \"Country Song\" and the earnest honkytonk gem, \"If I Could Sing A Country Song (Exactly Like George Jones),\" and the Bluegrass Alliance's zippy acoustic cover of \"The Night They Drove Old Dixie Down.\" Another curio was singer Jimmy Ellis's funky, southern rock-ish cover of \"Blue Moon Of Kentucky,\" which came out anonymously, as part of Shelby Singleton's years-long hoax attempt where he tried to pass Ellis off as \"Orion,\" a masked, garishly dressed singer who was meant to be the literal second coming of Elvis Presley. The album's tenuous pose as a collection of topical tunes had a few prime examples, including Rusty Adams' 1973 version of Carroll Chesley's \"Hippie From Mississippi,\" Webb Pierce's irresistible taxpayer protest tune, \"The Good Lord Giveth And Uncle Same Taketh Away,\" and of course, gal who bankrolled it all, Jeannie C. Riley, whose \"Harper Valley PTA\" put Plantation Records on the map. This was, of course, a British edition, reflecting material from several even cheaper-looking American releases on Plantation proper... Digital-era audiences may want to look for the 2-CD PLANTATION GOLD collection, which has some overlap.\n\nVarious Artists \"(MORE) COUNTRY COMMENT\" (Charly Records, 1979) (LP)\n\nThis second volume, issued years later, was more of s straightforward collection of singles, including a few of Plantation's late-'Seventies discoveries, ranging from album artists like Rita Remington and Lois Ann Struck to more obscure dudes such as honkytonker Buddy Harris and old-time rockabilly singer Ben Hewitt, who was giving country music a whirl with a depressing little number, \"Border City Call Girl.\" And of course there were still some old-timers who found refuge on the Plantation roster -- Gordon Terry, Jimmy C. Newman, Sleepy La Beef and once again, James O'Gwynn whose \"If I Could Only Get One Hit,\" in once heck of a dread-filled, existential crisis downer of a twangtune, pretty accurately reflecting on the career crises of any number of country music old-timers during the industry consolidations of the Me Decade. Anyway, this volume isn't as strong as the first, but it's still pretty good... And it also overlaps with various American comps on Plantation proper... six of one, half dozen of the other.\n\nVarious Artists \"COUNTRY FUNK: 1969-1975\" (Light In The Attic, 2012)\n\nFunky music with twang, or redneck music with a groove? Either way, this well-curated collection has a lot of surprises (Mac Davis with a beat? A country cover of Dr. John's \"Gilded Splinters\"?) as well as some stuff you'd expect, like gritty oldies from Tony Joe White, Bobbie Gentry and Larry Jon Wilson, as well as a few missed opportunities (no Elvin Bishop? Well, darn.) See? The Black Crowes didn't invent this stuff, after all.\n\nVarious Artists \"COUNTRY FUNK, V.2: 1967-1974\" (Light In The Attic, 2014)\n\nThe second volume continues in the same vein, though with maybe a little bit of a tilt towards stuff that's off the beaten track... You got your J. J. Cale and Dolly Parton, sure, but it ain't \"The Breeze\" and \"9 to 5,\" baby... Naw, it's \"Cajun Moon\" and \"Getting Happy,\" Beatles covers (\"Don't Let Me Down\" done Dillard style) and \"Don't Be Cruel\" covered in a quaalude haze by Billy Swan. I'd prefer not to waste the digital storage space on Townes Van Zandt (and I'm not alone in this sentiment... trust me...) though Jackie DeShannon covering \"The Weight\" is definitely a funky delight. There are some relatively obscure artists as well -- Donnie Fritts, Thomas Jefferson Kaye, Bill Wilson -- and a few outlaw oldies like \"Shotgun Willie\" and \"Northeast Texas Women\" that might be overplayed, but are still solid gold. I was even willing to give Kenny \"Sauron\" Rogers the benefit of the doubt, with him and the First Edition pretending to be gritty on \"Tulsa Turnaround,\" though it doesn't take long to realize that this groovy tune is just as flaccid and hollow as anything else he ever recorded. (I know Kenny's passed away, but that doesn't make his music any better...) Anyway, this is a pretty good set, full of earworms and other surprises... If you're a twang-vinyl junkie, you've probably heard or have a lot of it already, but this is still a pretty fun disc. Recommended!\n\nVarious Artists \"COUNTRY FUNK, V.3: 1975-1982\" (Light In The Attic, 2021)\n\nVarious Artists \"COUNTRY GOLD\" (GRT Records-Canada, 1972) (LP)\n\n(Produced by Art Snider)\n\nAn odd, hodge-podgy double album gathering together sessions (possibly random singles?) of several Canadian artists recording for GRT and other labels. The record was helmed by producer Art Snider, owner of the Sound Canada studios and host of the CBC-TV variety show, Country Hoedown, who provides a rather sparse sound overall, although in some cases the thin, tinny production is actually quite nice. The lineup includes Californian emigre Stan Farlow, who apparently cut a few singles for Snider in the early '70s, including reprises of his slavish imitations of Johnny Cash as well as a plainspoken rendition of \"Me And Bobby McGee\" that's one of the examples of how Snider's sparse arrangements could help bring out the lyrics of the songs. ... Elsewhere, Canadian rockabilly pioneer Jack Bailey croons a few country ballads, sisters Simone and Nora Hart cover tunes such as \"Rose Garden,\" \"Snowbird,\" and \"Help Me Make It Through The Night,\" as well as singers Jimmy Lewis, Ron van Dykoff and Jimmy Nolan. Perhaps one of the most unexpected entries comes from old-time pop singer Lorenzo Conyers -- formerly of the Ink Spots vocal group -- whose version of \"Knock Three Times\" is one of the more effective performances on here... For the most part, this 2-LP collection is an outwardly unimpressive, budget-line release focused on knock-off versions of Top Forty hits... But for country fans who are willing to give the cheapie labels a chance, it does yield a few surprises. Worth a spin, though don't get your hopes too high.\n\nVarious Artists \"COUNTRY K: FM STEREO 108 -- SOUTH FLORIDA'S BEST, v.1\" (Starstream Records, 1981) (LP)\n\n(Produced by Bill Hariss & John Lind)\n\nThis collection of would-be country stars from Florida was a product of the Big Music America company, an entrepreneurial outfit that sponsored local rock (and country) battle-of-the-band contests and produced several souvenir albums in various regions. The artists included in this early 'Eighties set include unknowns such as The Bridgefield Band, Sissy Butler, Florence Carbonneau, Lee Dunn, Peggy Gentile, The Jay Birds, Lonnie Jolson, Chris Kjos, Lois Lane, Jim Seagraves, and an outfit called The Slithering Strings Band -- none of whom are familiar to me from elsewhere. This album was co-sponsored by radio station \"Country-K\" 108-FM and the Pepsi Cola corporation as a marketing tool for Mountain Dew... According to the liner notes, the contest was determined by a review of demo tapes submitted to the station (not by a live concert) and entailed a $25,000 cash prize and a recording contract. Anyone know who won this one?\n\nVarious Artists \"THE COUNTRY MUSIC ASSOCIATION OF SOUTH CAROLINA\" (CMA-SC Records, 1967) (LP)\n\nThe CMA-SC was founded in 1966 and staged a big, regionally based music festival in August of that year... They followed up in '67 with -- you guessed it! -- the Second Annual Country Music Jubilee, which is documented in this 2-LP set. This is truly hardcore little-guy, \"real people,\" locals-only stuff, with an army of unknowns playing old-timey music, ballads, honkytonk, gospel and more. Artists include Steve Britt, Paul Holt, Rollin' Joe Johnson, Maxine Kinard, Ira Dimmery and others... You see where this is headed, right? And if you'e thinking Ralph Stanley or whoever is going to show up... think again! Some songs you may recognize, but the players are purely locals, making this a real trove of folkloric info on the not-just-bluegrass scene of the late 'Sixties. Anyone know how long the CMA-SC stayed together?\n\nVarious Artists \"COUNTRY MUSIC BY THE WAYSIDE\" (Wayside Records, 1968-?) (LP)\n\n(Produced by Little Richie Johnson)\n\nThe Wayside label was a hopeful Nashville indie started up in 1967 by Lou Casella and Arizona's desert-twang king, Little Richie Johnson. They'd signed up about a dozen artists by the time this LP came out, mainly second-stringers, with a few who made light dents in the charts at one time or another. This album included tracks by Bobby Buttram, Cathy Cass, Gayle Holly, Murray Lewis and Jerry McKinnon, though later more significant signings such as Darrell McCall and Lynda K. Lance aren't on this record, which was mentioned in an April, 1968 Billboard article, but might have come up in '67, when the label was starting up. Perhaps the most interesting artist here is one Hattie Louise Bess, aka \"Tootsie,\" the proprietor of Tootsie's Orchid Lounge, one of Nashville's best-known music bars. (Her tracks are pretty negligible -- one was an instrumental, and the other could only charitably be called a vocal number -- so I'm gonna go out on a limb and guess that just maybe she got a spot on the album simply as a ploy to try and get her to book some of these artists at her club... But perhaps I'm being too cynical?) Anyway, there's some nice, light twang on here, stuff that was probably a little out of step with the swank country-folk and countrypolitan sounds that were dominating Nashville at the time. Good, obscure stuff from several struggling in the long shadow of Music City's major labels, with several Kitty Wells soundalikes and Carl Smith wannabees. Which is just fine, in my book!\n\nVarious Artists \"COUNTRY MUSIC CLUB OF INDIANA: DARN GOOD COUNTRY\" (Country Star/Process Record Company, 19--?)\n\nThis one's a real hoot. Clearly a pay-to-play vanity record, this LP includes photos of the various artists on the back cover, along with their names, but no info about who sang which song, or which musicians were backing them. On the disc itself, emcee/producer Ron Speck goes whole-hog into his super-commercial Big Announcer voice, enacting a pretend concert made to sound like a slick, ready-for-radio program, complete with canned applause and spoken intros that overlap the songs. It's possible that many, if not all, of these tracks were previously issued as singles and later stitched together into a \"concert\" format, or maybe they were just recorded for this album. At any rate, the phoniness of the presentation is quite entertaining, although it also has to be said many of the performers were solid... some more than others. Speck insists that the show is taking place at \"the Big Red Entertainment Center,\" and announces each performer, while also taking great relish in a little good-natured cussing, tagging the program as \"damn good country\" (even though on the album cover they more demurely use the word \"darn...\") If you're a hardcore locals-only listener, this is definitely worth tracking down -- not great, but entertaining. And, just because I love you -- and to prove that I listened attentively -- I will also provide a tracklist, for posterity:\n\nSIDE ONE\n\n1. Nadine Schockley \"Halfway To Paradise\"\n\n2. Harold Land \"Misery Loves Company\"\n\n2. Bobbie Lee \"Thinking Tonight Of My Blue Eyes\"\n\n2. Chuck Ellis \"Don't Worry About Me\"\n\n2.

(LP)\n\n(Produced by Elwood Ivins & Tom Berry)\n\nVarious Artists \"COUNTRY 'N ROCK\" (Country Star/Process Record Company, 19--?)\n\nSuper-rare stuff on this 1960's vanity label from a Franklin, Pennsylvania label... This album includes local artists such as Chuck Anthony, Bonnie Baldwin, LeRoy Cortez, The Highlights Combo, Billy Jones, Junie Lou & Her Pine Hedge Ranch Hands, Pie Plant Pete, Ralph Ryan, and Jim Stephens. The Country Star label seemed to have released several albums in this series - about a half dozen or so... also check out the OLE COUNTRY MUSIC compilation, below.\n\nVarious Artists \"COUNTRY SONGS ROUND-UP\" (Preview Records, 1977) (LP)\n\nA song-poem album where a dozen-plus aspiring lyricists paid to have their words put to music -- in this case, country style. This particular set is mainly of interest because one of the recording artists, Roy Wakley, was apparently a nom du well, it's a paycheck for rockabilly legend Roy Campi, who seems to have been moonlighting as a song-poem musician. At least that's what a couple of folks say online, although it may be that Campi and Wakely were two different guys who happened to be playing on the same album. I dunno. The other vocalists were two gals, Norma Jean Hawkins and Joanie Winters, and according to Praguefrank's website, the other session players included a couple of seasoned pickers from the Hollywood country-rock scene, Larry Booth and steel player J. D. Maness, along with guitarist Russ Hanson and drummer Archie Francie. This kind of album often has limited charms, although if the interwebs is correct about the lineup, this disc might have a little more ooomph than average. I'm not sure where all the \"songwriters\" were from, but let's call this one a California album.\n\nVarious Artists \"COUNTRY VOICES\" (Sundown Studios, 1981) (LP)\n\n(Produced by Brad Tuttle)\n\nBilled as \"the best of Southwest Minnesota And Northern Iowa,\" this one's an obscuraholic's dream, featuring five groups from the Great Lakes region playing in a variety of styles. There's a band called Legend, the duo of Little Joe & Ken Pavelko, Milwaukee Road, Denny Storey, and The Sundown Band, a group from Jackson, Minnesota led by fiddler Bradley Tuttle, who also produced the album.\n\nVarious Artists \"COUNTRYPOLITAN\" (Pompeii Records, 1969) (LP)\n\n(Produced by Pat Morgan)\n\nAn odd but appealing collection from the Dallas-based Pompeii Records, which is probably best known as a soul label that released several LPs and singles by Ike & Tina Turner. This country(politan!) set partly draws on some singles by several obscure artists... The marquee singer is Dale McBride a Texas honkytonker who'd been kicking around since the late '50s and later had a few modest hits in the early '70s. His contributions here are two lackluster country-pop ballads (oh well) but there are some fun tracks by other artists on here, such as Eddie Downs (\"What Ever Happened To Me\"), Linda Gayle (\"The One That Stands By Me\"), Eddy Lynn (\"The Best Friends Money Can Buy\") and Darrell Glenn, whose \"Older Man, Younger Girl\" has a slightly creepy vibe. Other artists include Bobby George, Dick Hammonds and Lee Wright. As far as I known, none of these artists ever really went anywhere (other than McBride, who cracked into the Billboard Top 40 a couple of times...) Nonetheless, this is a pretty ambitious album, smoothly produced and clearly intended as a serious effort to break into the country market... A few good tunes, though overall a bit snoozy.\n\nVarious Artists \"THE COWBOY: THE COUNTRY DOZEN\" (Cowboy Records, 1982-?) (LP)\n\n(Produced by Johnny Burger)\n\nAlthough there's no information on the cover about the label or the artists (other than their names) this album appears to be a collection of Southern California artists, put together by promoter Johnny Burger sometime in the early 1980s. The Cowboy was a country music nightclub in Anaheim, California (near LA) which hosted a roster of lesser-known local musicians. Among the artists on this album are Tammy Jean, aka Tammy Jean Locke, an actress and former roller derby star who led the band California Express from 1980-87, a gig that Johnny Burger apparently set up... Other artists include the band Ambush, Johnny Burger, Lisa Cole, Larry Dean, Tommy Joe Gobel, Frank James, character actor Kenny McKinney, Son Of A Band, and finally, Orange County honky-tonker Jim Ferguson, who self-released his own album back in 1980. Tammy Jean released a private-press single around the same time this came out; the band Ambush may have released their own records as well, and possibly others on this album. As always, any additional info is welcome.\n\nVarious Artists \"THE COWTOWN JAMBOREE\" (Old Cowtown Jamboree Records, 1975-?) (LP)\n\n(Produced by Marvin Montgomery, Howard Reed & Bob Sullivan)\n\nA souvenir album of a 1970s Fort Worth mini-opry... This was actually an attempt to revive an older venue, the opry-esque Cowtown Jamboree which was originally held at Bill Kuykendall's fabled Panther Hall, and was also broadcast Saturday nights on local TV station KTVT. The Jamboree show was a hot ticket in the 1960s, though the Kuykendalls sold Panther Hall in '73, and things soon ground to a halt, with the venue closing entirely in 1978. (The building was sold to and later demolished by Texas Wesleyan University.) This edition of the Jamboree seems to have been connected to a renovation and reboot of Panther Hall, circa 1975 and features a cast of largely unknown locals. The album open and closes with performances by the house band, Howard Reed & The Country Sounds, and notably includes a couple of tracks by a mid-'Seventies edition of the venerable western swing group The Light Crust Doughboys, which was led at times by album co-producer Marvin \"Smokey\" Montgomery. The new recruits included several obscure gal singers -- Barbara Bowlin, Taysha, Trenda RoMell, and the duo of Don And Gay Lynn (who also recorded at least one single a few years earlier.) Other than the Doughboys, perhaps the most accomplished musicians were The Shady Grove Ramblers, a long-running bluegrass band that recorded around a dozen albums and whose single track here, \"Sweet Carolina Women,\" stands out for its solid production and musical sophistication. There were a few dudes in the mix as well, including emcee Parker Willson, Jr., whose father was connected to the original Cowtown show, as well as a plangent fellow named Sam Gafford who plows through a cover of \"Louisiana Man,\" and Jake Jacobs, who croons a nice version of \"Daydreams About Night Things.\" The real wow factors for this album, though, are the songs by the gals, which though amateurish are more individual-sounding performances and showcase more interesting material. I'm not sure if many of these folks persisted in the music business, though this is a nice snapshot of some Lone Star musical history... A bit forlorn, perhaps, but scrappy, and ambitious as well as authentic. (Thanks to the Mellow's Log Cabin blog, which posted an informative piece on Panther Hall, sometime back in 2022...)\n\nVarious Artists \"DEATH DRIVER: THE TRUE STORY OF REX RANDOLPH\" (CMC Records, 1975) (LP)\n\n(Produced by Arthur Smith & Clay Smith)\n\nApparently this was the soundtrack album to a mid-'70s country hicksploitation film -- the fictional \"true\" story of an aging stunt car driver trying to make a comeback. It was produced by and starred auteur-entrepreneur Earl Owensby -- redneck culture's answer to Ed Wood -- who also sings on one track. The music was provided by Arthur Smith and Clay Smith (aka Smith & Son) with Side One featuring vocals by a variety artists, including the Smiths, the Schuylers and a gal named Maggie Griffin, while Side Two seems to be all incidental music. An oddity from the heyday of redneck cinema.\n\nVarious Artists \"DENNIS HOPPER IN: THE AMERICAN DREAMER\" (Mediarts Records, 1971) (LP)\n\n(Produced by Buck Harrington & Nikolas Venet)\n\nA long-lost soundtrack to a long-lost documentary about the making of a long-lost film. This album was at least tangentially connected to the feature-length The American Dreamer, which profiled actor-director Dennis Hopper as he was working to edit his surrealistic, avantnik film, The Last Movie, an experimental art movie he wrote and directed while riding high on the tremendous commercial success of the counterculture exploitation film, Easy Rider. The Last Movie was an unqualified disaster, at least as far as Hopper's Hollywood career went, a defiant exercise in auteurism that the studios saw as an embarrassment, and after they buried it as quickly as they could, Hopper's career went into limbo for several years. Like the movie it sought to document, The American Dreamer took a an experimental narrative approach, and found only a minuscule and largely unsympathetic audience; for decades it was thought lost altogether until a print resurfaced and was later released on DVD. Like the soundtracks of both Easy Rider and The Last Movie (which are reviewed below) this soundtrack has a definite folk-rock flavor, in this case provided by Gene Clark of the Byrds as well as John Buck Wilkin, the son of songwriter Marijohn Wilkin, along with lesser lights such as the Hello People, folk-rocker John Manning and Chris Sikellenos (who contributes a track called \"Easy Rider, 1970.\") It's actually not bad, particularly the Gene Clark tracks which have a strummy, starry-eyed feel. Not really totally \"country,\" but definitely worth a spin.\n\nVarious Artists \"DETROIT'S BEST COUNTRY\" (Seeds & Stems Records, 1980) (LP)\n\n(Produced by Tom Connor & Ron Christopher)\n\nThis seems to have been a sort of pay-to-play set, with one track apiece from a gaggle of Michigan country singers of varying degrees of professionalism, all recording at the same studio, though possibly with several different bands. The artists include A.C. The Kentucky Fox, Larry Lee Adkins, Jerry Combs, Kelly Hall, Bob Hoskins, Wally Jackson, Jack Molette, Ford Nix and the duo of Carl & Brenda Vanover. These mostly seem like they were strictly amateurs, although some -- like Larry Lee Adkins or Ford Nix -- had fairly long track records, cutting singles years earlier (and in the case of Mr. Nix, at least one full LP). The overall vibe is pretty slick and modern, with several Waylon Jennings imitators and a few tracks that seems hopeful of commercial success, indeed several singles were broken off this album by various artists. Not much that really wowed me, though one album highlight is Carl & Brenda's jaunty honkytonker, \"Momma's Waiting\" -- a solid tune that made me wonder what their other singles are like. The comedic number, \"T.V.'s Gone,\" by A.C. The Kentucky Fox, is a near-miss novelty song about a guy whose main regret about getting dumped is that some gal stole his TV set on her way out the door, though AC was a little too low-energy to really pull it off... An okay compilation, but not a great one.\n\nVarious Artists \"DIRTY LAUNDRY: THE SOUL OF COUNTRY MUSIC\" (Trikont Records, 2005)\n\nA Euro-curated set of popular 1960s and '70s soul artists covering country material...\n\nVarious Artists \"(MORE) DIRTY LAUNDRY, v.2\" (Trikont Records, 2008)\n\nVarious Artists \"THE DOC WILLIAMS SHOW: FEATURING THE ENTIRE CAST\" (Wheeling Records, 1972-?) (LP)\n\n(Produced by Jim Sutton)\n\nCountry old-timer Doc Williams and his wife Chickie Williams were both pretty long in the tooth when they released this \"mini-opry\"-style record as an offshoot of their long-running gig at the WWVA \"Wheeling Jamboree.\" Presumably they took their show on the road as well, and this disc captures one lineup of the Doc Williams Show, circa 1972, with several younger artists in the cast. The most promising member of the '72 cast was singer Jack Jackson, though also in the mix was gal singer Karen McKenzie, who was apparently one of several Williams daughters to perform in the family show, as well as Dapper Dan Martin, the revue's cornpone comedian, who performs several truly awful skits and (hah, hah) super-sexist novelty songs, as well as lead guitarist Curt Dillie and drummer Spyder Webb, who actually got a two-minute drum solo on Side Two of the disc. (He was a good drummer, but still, yikes.) Veering from their hillbilly roots, the Williamses tried to tap into the countrypolitan vibe of the time, emulating (and covering) crooner Freddie Hart, with milky renditions of Hart's \"Easy Lovin',\" Tommy Overstreet's \"Gwen, Congratulations,\" and \"Four In The Morning,\" a late-career hit for Faron Young. Mr. Williams seems game, though Ms. Williams sounded pretty low-energy. Indeed, the whole record seems pretty dispirited... an authentic \"opry\" variety revue album, but certainly not one of the best in the genre. I'm not sure if any of these folks pursued a career in country music, though I Karen McKenzie had already made a go of it with a few promising but unpromoted singles, circa 1968-69.\n\nVarious Artists \"DOING THE NATURAL THING, v. 1 & 2\" (Perfect Toy Records, 2019)\n\nA well-curated set that includes some hardcore '70s country-soul and twangy white funk. Although this starts out on a more distinctly country note, it cruises into fairly twangless territory, and becomes more of a private-label R&B/soul set. Super-obscuro, though, and of a higher calibre than many similar collections. For twang-fans, standouts include Gary Graham, L.A. Jones's Elvis Presley-ish tracks, Mighty Mike Davis's cover of Bobby Bare's \"All American Boy,\" and Woody Wayne's guitar instrumental, \"Sleepy,\" which gives \"Groovy Grubworm\" a real run for its money. Not as country as the album art implies, but plenty of cool tunes in a variety of styles. This is one of those Bandcamp things, but it came out on vinyl, too, in case the link ever dies.\n\nVarious Artists \"DOLLY PARTON AND FRIENDS AT GOLDBAND\" (Goldband Studios, 1979) (LP)\n\nI had this one, once, but because I am an idiot (and was at the time extremely poor) I traded it back to my local Record Hut, and have never seen it since. This bootleg album is notable for reissuing what's said to be Dolly Parton's first (or at least some of her earliest) recordings, \"Puppy Love\" and \"Girl Left Alone,\" cut when she was about twelve years old and miraculously placed in front of the microphones of the legendary Louisiana label, Goldband Studios. Goldband is best known as a hub of sizzling blues, R&B and cajun music, but was also a fine source of vintage twang. Not surprisingly, Dolly sounded pretty good for a little kid. The rest of the album highlights early tracks by other future stars such as Freddy Fender, Mickey Gilley and Jo-El Sonnier, which are of less interest (to me) than stuff by country obscuros such as Laurence Aguillard, Anita Francis, Don Mooring, Jenny Scroggins, some guys called the Boppin' Billies, and even one by label owner Eddie Schuler. Oh, if only I knew back then what I know now. But I didn't. Alas.\n\nVarious Artists \"DOWN BY THE RIO GRANDE\" (Hoopsnake Records, 1980) (LP)\n\n(Produced by Jane Grosby Bergey & Barbara Lau)\n\nHighlights from the 1977-79 lineups at the Western Music Frontier Folklife Festival, held in Saint Louis, Missouri... Artists include folkie and bluesy types such as Art Galbraith, Van Holyoak, Bill Neely, and Greg Ohrlin, along with Santiago Jimenez Jr., and numerous other Tex-Mex artists. More of a cowboy/vaquero historical kind of thing, I suppose; the annual concerts were tied to the Jefferson National Expansion Memorial Association, with funding from NEA grants and the Missouri Arts Council.\n\nVarious Artists \"E.A.B. COUNTRY, VOLUME ONE\" (Our Country Records, 1973-?) (LP)\n\n(Produced by Ed Boucher)\n\nI'm not sure that the whole story is with this disc, but this appears to be mostly a set of little-known country singers from Maine and thereabouts, all singing cover songs, possibly as part of a pay-to-record kinda deal. The most famous vocalist on here was Gene Hooper (1923-2010), a popular New England radio performer who recorded an album or two of his own and became a cast member of the WWVA Jamboree, down in Wheeling, West Virginia. George Phillips, who covers Freddy Hart's \"Easy Lovin',\" also recorded a full album, which appears to be the only other LP put out by this label. A few of the gals featured here -- Louise Ann, Sharon James and Stacy Stanton -- also recorded singles, including on other imprints of producer Ed Boucher's EAB empire. Mostly, though, this is super-obscuro territory, about as local as you're gonna get.\n\nVarious Artists \"EARLY COUNTRY ROCK FROM NASHVILLE\" (T-Bird Records, 2010)\n\nFirst things first: the \"country rock\" part of the title is pretty misleading, since these early '60s recordings (cut for the uber-indie Spar label) feature a lot of latter-day rockabilly and oldies-rock sounds as well as some decent Bakersfield Sound-styled numbers and numerous uptempo novelty songs, but it's all pretty standard-issue country, hardly the cosmic-cowboy hippie-tinged stuff we identify with the \"country rock\" sound of the late '60s and '70s. That being said, this is still a valuable historical collection profiling a smaller Nashville label whose lineup was mostly made up of obscure non-stars -- the only names I recognize off the bat are those of Jerry Foster and singer Bobby Russell, and while I relish obscure artists as much as any other crazy record collector, I gotta say a lot of these tracks are pretty mediocre. There's a lot of noteworthy talent behind the scenes, though: studio musicians such as Lloyd Green, Mac Gayden, Kenny Buttrey, Wayne Moss and Pete Drake were heard on zillions of 'Sixties sessions, including on countless albums that did help shape the experimental country-rock sound of the era. This disc is worth checking out, just don't set your hopes too high.\n\nVarious Artists \"EASY RIDER: MUSIC FROM THE SOUNDTRACK\" (ABC-Dunhill Records, 1969) (LP)\n\nThis best-selling soundtrack to the hippie-sploitation film Easy Rider was a major conduit for the longhaired twang that was bubbling up from the West Coast rock scene. The hard rock psychedelic stuff by Hendrix, Steppenwolf and the Electric Prunes doesn't hold my interest, but the country-rock tunes by the Byrds, Roger McGuinn, The Holy Modal Rounders and Fraternity Of Man are all classics. Don't bogart that joint, my friend -- flip the LP again!\n\nVarious Artists \"THE ELEVENTH COLORADO COUNTRY MUSIC FESTIVAL\" (Illini Records, 1974-?) (LP)\n\n(Produced by Fritz Brading)\n\nA souvenir of the eleventh annual(?) Colorado Country Music Festival, held in Aurora, Colorado with Jim Peters as emcee, and Patsy Montana an honored guest. I don't recognize most of the performers, though this live album is notable for including several female artists; one of them, Patty Gallagher made an album of her own. The lineup included producer Fritz Brading on the closing track, as well as Bill Clossey, Rudy Grant, Jan Hurley, Jerry Moore, Carmen Peters, Ron Ray, Rusty Russell, Doug Stuart and Joe Wells. I suspect this is one of those records that will provide me with a lot of interesting leads, if I ever gt the time to track 'em down. Mostly covers of contemporary, early 'Seventies chart hits, stuff like \"Teddy Bear,\" \"Slippin' Away,\" \"The Keys In The Mailbox\" and \"Six Days On The Road,\" with originals by Patty Gallagher and Rusty Russell, as well as engineer Fritz Brading who (along with teen gal singer Jan Hurley) was a ringer brought in from Springfield, Illinois, where the Illini label was headquartered. Not sure if this festival produced any other albums, either before or after, but this is a nice snapshot of a local/regional scene in a time of country music transition.\n\nVarious Artists \"ENCHANTMENT: SONGS ABOUT NEW MEXICO\" (KRST, 1976) (LP)\n\n(Various producers)\n\nA statewide collection from the land of enchantment, the first of several regional-talent albums sponsored by Albuquerque radio station KRST, 92.3 FM. Although rock'n'roll and funk artists are well represented, this has a heavy tilt towards twang, including tracks by The Last Mile Ramblers, Watermelon Mountain Jug Band, and a track credited to C.J. & Friends, which seems to be a spinoff of the Family Lotus, a bluegrass'n'twang band that also featured backing vocals from Eliza (Lisa) Gilkyson, who lived in Santa Fe during the 1970s.\n\nVarious Artists \"ENGINE NUMBER NINE/DANG ME\" (Crown Records, 1964) (LP)\n\nLike many releases on the el-cheapo Crown label, this LP flashily emblazoned covers of current hits as bait to lure in record buyers -- in this case it was a couple of Roger Miller songs, sung by a guy who was probably pretending to be a worse singer than he actually was, in imitation of Miller's own goofball style. The rest of the tracks are a hodgepodge of recordings hauled out of various vaults, most of which are obviously of much older vintage than the early-'60s title tracks. There's some hot rockabilly/country boogie stuff, gallumphing honkytonk and western swing and even a sizzling version of the Hawaiian guitar classic, \"Hilo March.\" None of the artists are identified (although I'm sure there are uber-twangster scholar types that have figured it all out...) but pretty much every track on here is a gem. The sound quality is lamentably bad, probably as much a result of the mastering as the cheap pressing, though in some ways the flattened sound quality makes this feel like a gritty live set played on maxed-out amps in some roadside bar. (I can dream, can't I?) Anyway, some fun stuff here -- can't judge a book, and all that!\n\nVarious Artists \"EUREKA SPRINGS COUNTRY SHINDIG\" (History Records, 1982) (LP)\n\n(Produced by Terry Crane & Brad Edwards)\n\nA memento of one of the many mom'n'pop mini-oprys dotting the landscape in the rural Ozarks. This particular venue was one of several oprys located in Eureka Springs, Arkansas, not far from Branson, Missouri and seems to have been a short-lived project headed by Terry Crane, whose name was slapped on the inner label almost as an afterthought... Unfortunately the musicians aren't listed individually, though the husband-wife gospel duo of Dave and Cathy Ellis joined the newly-formed group in the spring of '82 and may have been on this album.\n\nVarious Artists \"FARMFEST 76: BACK TO THE SOIL\" (Lee Stoller Enterprises, 1976) (LP)\n\n(Produced by Brien Fisher)\n\nThis classic industrial musical album -- \"America's Bicentennial Salute To Agriculture!\" -- features a gloriously jingoistic narration by Grand Ole Opry emcee Grant Turner, extolling the heroic saga of American farming from its sod-busting pioneer roots to the glorious commercial apex of millions of acres of amber, waving grain, drenched in red-white-and-blue fertilizers and insecticide, from sea to shining sea. There are also some adequately twangy musical interludes by Nashville songwriter Michael Kosser, who was riding high on a string of tunes recorded by the likes of George Jones, Barbara Mandrell and Ray Price during the early 1970s. There's also one song, \"200 Years,\" credited to producer Brien Fisher's brother, Jack Fisher. Unfortunately the liner notes don't tell us who the backing musicians were, but one can imagine they were top-tier Nashville pros.\n\nVarious Artists \"FIRST ANNUAL GREEN MOUNTAIN COUNTRY MUSIC CONTEST\" (Green Mountain Records, 1975) (LP)\n\n(Produced by Jim Brugnoni & Robert Longfellow)\n\nA regional New England talent competition hosted on April 18, 1975 by folks up in Barre, Vermont... The lineup included the Arm & Hammer String Band, fiddler Victor Albert, Gary Barr, Karen Billings, The Blue Spruce Rangers, The Eden Mountain Boys, Ken Eiker, Leaf Gage, Doris Hoague, and others. A few of the artists would record elsewhere, including first place winner Coco Kallis and her group (Coco & The Lonesome Road Band), whose \"New England Song\" was released as a single the following year, as well as Bruce Batchelder, who took third place.\n\nVarious Artists \"FIRST FLIGHT: FIRST ANNUAL IOWA ALBUM\" (Snowflake Productions, 1980) (LP)\n\nA contemporary collection of Iowa rock, country-rock, bluegrass and bar-band musicians... With Guy Drollinger pickin' and singin' on a tune called \"The Carnival,\" Roger LeBarge singing \"Mississippi River,\" and Bob Engeman backed by Neal Herrmuth on fiddle and pedal steel player Mike Boyer on \"Way Down In Iowa.\" Another booster tune is \"Iowa City (Wild Weekend Nights)\" by Craig Erickson, whose civic pride is matched only by K101-FM's program director, Mark Vos, whose fiercely commercial liner notes add a certain sense of rah-rah pride to this local showcase album.\n\nVarious Artists \"FIRST PRESS -- SONOMA COUNTRY ARTISTS: 1981\" (Rail Records, 1981) (LP)\n\n(Produced by Jack Ellis & John Brenes)\n\nAnother Northern California bonanza, with well-known roots musicians such as Norton Buffalo, Billy C. Farlow, Larry Hosford and Kate Wolf sharing vinyl time with less-remembered locals such as The Bodega Bay Blues Band, David Songbird, WBBH and others...\n\nVarious Artists \"FLYING BEAR MEDICINE SHOW\" (Smash Records, 1969) (LP)\n\nRecorded live at a gig in Northern California's Marin County, this album features mostly rock and boogie-rock bands, but also includes a few tracks by the fabled Sir Douglas Quintet, so it'll be of interest to twangfans and Doug Sahm devotees...\n\nVarious Artists \"THE FOLK YEARS\" (Time-Life Records, 2013)\n\nThis is a straight reissue of an earlier 8-CD, 120-song box set drawn from several major labels, broken down into four 2-CD sets (each available on its own as well) that are roughly (but not strictly) reflections of the different catalogs of each label or conglomerate -- two from Warner, and one each from EMI and Sony. Although reasonably comprehensive, the emphasis of this collection is on hit songs and artists who crossed over into the Pop charts, to the exclusion of less commercial but more authentic folkies such as Tom Paxton, Dave Van Ronk and other stalwarts of the Greenwich Village, Boston, and West Coast folk scenes. Breakthrough stars like Joan Baez, Judy Collins and Bob Dylan are amply represented, as are the more overtly pop-oriented performers such as Trini Lopez, the Mamas & Papas and the Springfields, as well as a slew of pop and country artists covering Dylan songs or otherwise cashing in on the folk fad of the late 1950s and early '60s. Though purists will lament the absence of various artists or songs (what? ...no Joni Mitchell? ...no Tom Rush??) the emphasis on commercial success has its own appeal... For one thing, it's amazing to see how many folk-oriented songs rose to the upper levels of the American charts, particularly during the Kennedy era, showing both the appeal of the genre and the now long-lost fluidity of the pop charts. Moving past the early 'Sixties, the editorial choices in this collection become more and more questionable -- the Band or Cat Stevens, sure -- but \"Brown Eyed Girl\" by Van Morrison? \"Red Rubber Ball,\" by the Cyrkle? Cher?? Bread?? Really?? If you're looking for a solid dose of earnest '60s crewcut folk, you might be better off getting collections of The Kingston Trio, The Brothers Four and The Chad Mitchell Trio (who are all represented here) but if you want a pop-oriented overview of how the folk revival intersected with and influenced American pop music all the way through the early '70s, this greatest-hits has a lot of golden oldies to offer. What a day for a daydream, indeed.\n\nVarious Artists \"FOR THE RECORD -- AUSTIN COUNTRY: 1973-1978\" (Maverick Records, 1980) (LP)\n\nA look back at the mid-'70s Austin scene, featuring tracks by stalwarts such as Marcia Ball, Jon Emery, Joe Gracey, The Reynolds Sisters, Bobbie Earl Smith, and of course good old Doug Sahm and Augie Meyers...\n\nVarious Artists \"FORD COUNTRY JAMBOREE: 23 TOP HITS\" (Ford Records, 1963-?) (LP)\n\n(Produced by Sherman Ford Jr. & Jake Payne)\n\nObscure East Coast country stuff... This appears to be a souvenir album for one of Short and Dolly Long's numerous mini-opry/jamboree package shows, though it's possible some tracks were reissues of 7\" singles from the Ford label, a scrappy little indie owned by producer Sherman Ford, Jr. The artists included the husband-wife team of Shorty and Dolly Long, backed by their band The Searchers, along with folk singer Dickson Hall leading a group called The Chordsmen, the duo of George Halliman & Lila Lou, and Paul Tannen. Most of these folks stuck with the Longs for a few years and appear on later Shorty Long albums... Perhaps the most notable musician was Dickson Hall, a colorful character who recorded a couple of albums of his own, in addition to some eyebrow-raising extracurricular shennanigans in the publishing world. Lila Lou Hallman also cut a couple of singles around this same time, though not a lot is known about her biography. Paul Tannen (1937-2017) was actually the son of publisher/agent/record store owner Nat Tannen, who helped Shorty Long land his role in the original cast of Frank Loesser's \"Most Happy Fella,\" back in 1956, and who passed away in 1962, leaving the family business to his son, who went on to become a VP at Warner Brothers(!) and a major behind-the-scene figure in the '70s country scene. How do you like them apples?\n\nVarious Artists \"FROM RENFRO VALLEY WITH LOVE\" (Jamboree Recordings, 19--?) (LP)\n\nVarious Artists \"FROM THE THE CAPITAL OF COUNTRY MUSIC\" (Larriot Records, 19--?) (LP)\n\nAn odd one here, most likely a tax write-off for someone, somewhere, back in the day. Though the liner notes extol the glories of Nashville, there's no mention by name of any artist connected to this album, the only clue seemingly being the \"Larriot\" label name, and the fact that they refer to this as a \"re-release.\" Dig a little deeper, though, and this appears to be a fly-by-night compilation album assemble by cobbling together a bunch of old singles from the Spar Records \"Country & Western Hits\" imprint. Most of the tunes are mainstream oldies such as \"Detroit City,\" \"Faded Love,\" \"Night Train To Memphis,\" \"When My Blue Moon Turns To Gold Again,\" and \"You're The Only Star In My Blue Heaven.\" However, there are a few more obscure tunes which helped identify the connection to the Spar label, including \"It Pays To Advertise\" (an old Farmer Boys song, later recorded by Johnny Singer and released on a single in 1964); \"Lonely 8 To 5\" (recorded by Cathy Taylor, who also recorded \"Faded Love,\" as well as a full album's worth of other material); \"If I Ever Dream I Love You\" (aka Stan Hardin's \"If You Ever Dream I Love You\"), etc. There have been more modern collections of the mysterious output of the Spar and Hit labels, though this brisk LP might fill in a few gaps...\n\nVarious Artists \"GARLAND RECORDS: PACIFIC NORTHWEST SNUFF BOX\" (Sundazed/Rocket Beat Records, 2020) (LP)\n\nA set of rare, hippie-era singles from the Oregon-based Garland label, which was better known for its rock/garage records. The tracks date from around 1968-72 and even include a few unreleased recordings by local rock groups in the label's orbit. The influence of California's nascent country-rock scene seems pretty tangible, in particular the sometimes-clunky hippie twang of the Byrds, along with the Buck Owens Bakersfield sound, and a hefty dose of slightly squarer-sounding country. Although the artists on this collection were pretty far-flung, the tracks sound a lot alike, and I suspect most of the singers were backed by a house band that was more rooted in rock rather than country music; some of the picking is sweet while sometimes it sounds pretty haphazard. In all honesty, this isn't the greatest country material, even of the \"locals only\" variety -- this collection oozes real-folks authenticity but few tracks really make you wanna crank up the volume. Several of the artists are familiar from elsewhere: rough-edged ballad singer Geronia Coyle (a guy) also released at least one other single on the legendary Ripcord label, as did the Cascade Sweethearts, who later recorded a full album along with Gene Keys from the Ripcord studios. (The cover photo on this album it taken from their old LP...) Overall, this disc may be mainly of academic interest, but it does capture a real slice of PNW musical culture.\n\nVarious Artists \"GENE WILLIAMS COUNTRY JUNCTION SHOW\" (Erwin Records, 1967-?) (LP)\n\n(Produced by Junior Bratcher)\n\nCountry impresario Gene Williams grew up in Dyess, Arkansas, but made his name in Memphis, just on the other side of the Mississippi River. In 1963 he was given his own weekly television slot, The Gene Williams Country Junction Show, on local television station KAIT, in Jonesboro. The popular program was swiftly syndicated throughout the South, and eventually was broadcast on nearly two hundred stations nationwide. This souvenir album showcases the 1966-67 cast, which included gal singer Lynne Burns, along with steel player Jim Roby, Smithville local Alton Yancey and singer Johnny Duncan (who's not to be confused with the Texan of the same name who became a chart-topper in the late 1970s...) Later on the show attracted veteran country and rockabilly performers such as Bill Carlisle and Warren Smith, and Williams plugged away for decades in a variety of markets.\n\nVarious Artists \"GET COUNTRY-FIVE'D\" (CC International Records, 197--?) (LP)\n\n(Produced by Carl French)\n\nAs near as I can figure this is a locals-only compilation from late-'70s Cleveland, Ohio, with five unknown musicians -- Jack Campbell, Gail Faught, Ronnie Ferrel, Conrad Morgan and Rodger Wilhoit -- singing material that was mostly written by producer Carl French. No info on the backing band, but the liner notes say that the sessions were recorded in RCA's Nashville studio, with \"Nashville's finest musicians,\" so it may have been an A-list, usual-suspects crew. Not sure what the back-story was on this one, but it looks very tax-dodgy, especially the odd list of several different \"Carwin Country\" business names on the back, which reminded me of the credits to \"Bambi Meets Godzilla.\"\n\nVarious Artists \"GLENN CAMPBELL PRESENTS PITTSBURGH COUNTRY\" (Var-Bee Records, 1970) (LP)\n\nIn 1970, country radio station WEEP, Pittsburg hosted a locals-only talent show which produced this deceptively-packaged album: countrypolitan star Glen Campbell is mentioned in the liner notes, but the Glenn Campbell named on the front was a Pennsylvanian, apparently the owner of the uber-indie Var-Bee label. Anyway, the musicians include the radio station's house band, Frank Grill & The Saddle Buddies, along with The Country Belles, Jim And Joanne & The Flaming Hearts and honkytonker Jim Contenta (1929-2008), a local steelworker and country old-timer whose first records date back to the early 1950s. Contenta sang three songs on this album, a version of \"Drinking Champagne,\" \"Kawliga\" and \"My One And Only Love.\"\n\nVarious Artists \"GOD LESS AMERICA\" (Crypt Records, 1995)\n\nA wonderfully downcast set of country misery tunes along the lines of Porter Wagoner's mopey classic \"Skid Row Joe.\" A few of these performers are well-knownish, notably Country Johnny Mathis and Eddie Noack, but mostly this draws on ultra-obscuro indie-label singles by far-flung locals with a taste for hillbilly melodrama and scoldy songs about the many lives ruined by pills and booze. Highlights include Billy Ray's \"The Story Of Suzie\" (wholesome hometown girl runs with a bad crowd and winds up in a padded cell), Arkey Blue's self-explanatory \"Too Many Pills,\" \"Rock 'n Roll Killed My Mother\" by the Hi-Fi Guys, and the equally awesome \"Please Don't Go Topless Mother\" by Troy Hess. Oh, and let's not forget Cal Veale's \"Paralyzed.\" Or the grim portrait of a sociopathic killer, \"It's Nothing To Me,\" a spoken-word gem recorded by Sanford Clark under the pseudonym Harry Johnson... And much, much more. A well-curated collection that set the pace for many collector-edition compilations to follow.\n\nVarious Artists \"GOD LOVES COUNTRY MUSIC\" (Marantha Music, 1981) (LP)\n\n(Produced by Joe Bellamy & Al Perkins)\n\nA Christian country tour-de-force from steel player Al Perkins and the West Coast \"Jesus freak\" contingent at Marantha Records... From start to finish, this is one of their more overtly country offerings -- plenty of pretty-sounding pedal steel and smooth (but twangy) guitars, easy on the ears, though to be honest the lyrics are a bit too saccharine for my taste. Most of the artists were drawn strictly from Marantha's pool of earnest, folk-ish amateur musicians -- church folk mostly, one would imagine. There are also several notable ringers, including"
