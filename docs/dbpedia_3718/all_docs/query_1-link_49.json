        "text": "CD + Vinyl:\n\n1349 – Massive Cauldron Of Chaos CD/LP (Season Of Mist)\n\nThe Norwegian black metal tyrants deliver aural hellfire with new album. Over four years in the making, Massive Cauldron Of Chaos builds on their storied career and sees the band sharpen their orthodox black metal assault with a thrashier edge. (Limited quantities pressed on black, white, and transparent vinyl.)\n\nABBA – Live At Wembly 2xCD/3xLP (Polydor)\n\nThis fantastic live release encapsulates 25 songs from ABBA’s landmark gig at Wembley Arena, London in 1979.

This is the first time this concert full of classic hits has been released.\n\nBryan Adams – Tracks Of My Years CD (Verve)\n\nCovers album featuring a diverse collection of time honored classics from the ‘50s, ‘60s and ‘70s.

The album features the innovative jazz guitarist and composer Bill Frisell, along with Amidon’s other frequent collaborators, bassist Shahzad Ismaily and drummer Chris Vatalaro. Lily-O’s ten songs are mostly traditional folk songs gathered from disparate sources and refashioned in Amidon’s signature way. Vinyl version due October 27.\n\nSteve Aoki – Neon Future I CD (Ultra)\n\nInternational DJ and producer Steve Aoki has always been at the forefront of future music. As the founder of Dim Mak Records and a Grammy-nominated electronic musician, his projects have grasped the attention of influencers and music enthusiasts worldwide. Given that he’s an avid follower of forward- thinking and evolving technology, it’s only fitting that the new album from Aoki being titled Neon Future.\n\nJoshua Abrams – Represencing CD (Eremite)\n\nRecorded at home in Chicago in 2011, Abrams again organizes small group statements around the resonant grooves of the North African ceremonial instrument the guimbri with a unique and broadly assimilative compositional voice.\n\nLydia Ainsworth – Right From Real CD (Artutus)\n\n“Like a fever dream of Julia Holter merging with Grimes, Lydia Ainsworth’s future visions weave neoclassical flourishes and enchanted melody-mangles into cool ‘80s sound-beds.” — Dazed Vinyl version due October 14.\n\nHerb Alpert – In The Mood CD (Shout! Factory)\n\nOn the heels of his 2014 Grammy win for his 2013 album Steppin’ Out, legendary trumpeter Herb Alpert presents his latest album. A collection of original compositions and modern takes on classic standards, In The Mood continues Alpert’s tradition of pushing his own musical boundaries.\n\nAmplifier – Mystoria CD (Superball Music)\n\nWith a career that spans over a thousand shows of every conceivable size over 16 years and five studio records, Amplifier have by this point progressed past being simply a band and have become a zen-like state of being. Behemoth double album The Octopus (2012) ultimately and justifiably proved a great success, garnering praise from the BBC, Drowned In Sound and Classic Prog, among others.\n\nIan Anderson – Homo Erraticus (Tour Edition) CD+DVD (Kscope)\n\nThe Jethro Tull frontman’s latest album has been expanded with a DVD featuring the exclusive videos to each album track, as seen at the shows, set to hi resolution 24-bit stereo audio. Also includes a live performance of “Enter The Uninvited” and new interview footage.\n\nSteve Arrington – Way Out: 80-84 CD (Tummy Touch)\n\nOhio funk legend/ambassador Steve Arrington releases a retrospective album, covering 30 years of unreleased and reworked material. Way Out: 80-84 is a compilation of sorts, blending more obscure cuts from earlier in his career with touched-up wonders that simply never left the cutting room floor.\n\nAusmuteants – Order Of Operation CD (Goner)\n\nOrder Of Operation is nasty and free of juvenile bullsh!t, but still 100% Australian, and opens with guitarist Shaun Connor’s forehead and thigh-slapping musical and lyrical debut, “Freedom of Information.” From there, songs range from balls-to-the-wall punkers (“Felix Tried To Kill Himself,” “Boiling Point”), well-considered workouts (“Family Time,” “Tunnel Vision”) and unguarded tenderness (“Wrong,” “Looney Bin”). Vinyl version due October 14.\n\nAvec le Soleil Sortant de Sa Bouche – Zubberdust! CD/LP (Constellation)\n\nDebut album from Montreal kraut-funk supergroup led by J.S. Truchy of Fly Pan Am.\n\nJonathan Badger – Verse CD/LP (Cuneiform)\n\nThe guitar and percussion tracks of Verse were recorded to half-inch tape, after which Jonathan brought in a number of Baltimore musicians to help orchestrate the pieces with wind, brass, voice, reeds and strings. Dueling mezzo sopranos weave light into sparse, cavernous structures. A guitar finds its way alongside a piano. Choirs of trumpets and flugelhorns warn us, but we don’t listen.\n\nBetween The Buried And Me – Future Sequence: Live at the Fidelitorium CD+DVD (Metal Blade)\n\nBetween The Buried And Me perform The Future Sequence live in a small studio with guest contributions by a group of auxiliary musicians, including percussionists, saxophone, flute, and a string quartet. Also available on stand-alone Blu-ray.\n\nBig Brother On Acid – Big Brother On Acid CD (Alrealon)\n\nBig Brother On Acid meshes dubstep bass sounds and beats with Coil-esque experimental sounds and samples.\n\nBloodwork – World Without End CD (Endtime Productions)\n\nRaw, unpolished and extreme old school metal untainted by fashion and fueled by a hunger for aural violence. Sharing the ethos of the early ‘90s masters, World Without End brutally blends crushing guitars, insane death, and old school madness to form a sound that has been carefully crafted from years of rehearsal amongst the dead in tombs of urban decay.\n\nGui Boratto – Abaporu CD/2LP+CD (Kompakt)\n\nOn Abaporu, the Brazilian dancefloor virtuoso displays his expertise in bouncing prime-time cuts and sophisticated pop vignettes. Includes the summer singles “Take Control” and “Too Late.”\n\nLenny Breau – La Bootleg 1984 CD (Linus)\n\nLenny Breau is regarded as one of the greatest guitarists of all time, both by fans and fellow guitarists. On the 30th anniversary of his untimely death (his murder remains unsolved) a newly discovered live recording containing songs never previously recorded or released by the revered jazz guitarist, is being released globally, alongside his best selling catalog — many of which have been unavailable for several years.\n\nJeff Bridges & The Abiders – Live CD (Mailboat)\n\nOn Live, Jeff and the band present great new renditions of songs associated with his career as well as some new songs, including their presentation of classics like “So You Want To Be A Rock And Roll Star” (The Byrds), Townes Van Zandt’s “To Live Is To Fly,” and Creedence Clearwater Revival’s “Lookin’ Out My Back Door.”\n\nPeita Brown – Paradise Outlaw CD (Red House)\n\nParadise Outlaw was recorded in four days at Bon Iver mastermind Justin Vernon’s April Base studio in Wisconsin with a supporting cast that includes Vernon, Amos Lee, Brown’s troubadour father, Greg Brown and various members of an experimental group of players she calls the Sawdust Collective. “When Pieta sings you’re aware of something effortless and natural, like rain on earth.” — Mark Knopfler\n\nBuffalo Tooth – Gardeners Of The Devil’s Lettuce CD/LP (Captcha)\n\nThrashy, no-bullsh!t hard rock. These dudes are on the wild-living-and-uncontrolled-freedom tip. These jams will serve you if you happen to find yourself stealing gasoline for your chopper or skateboarding to the corner store to score some prime snacks. Possibly not the ditties for you if you’re wearing a badge.\n\nThe Butcher Babies – Uncovered CD (Century Media)\n\nTaking a page from heroes Metallica and Guns & Roses, Los Angeles metal act The Butcher Babies have recorded an EP of cover tunes.\n\nColbie Caillat – Gypsy Heart CD (Republic)\n\nGypsy Heart is the fourth album from the singer/songwriter. For the album, Colbie worked with Grammy award winning and legendary producer Kenneth ”Babyface” Edmonds, in-demand songwriter David Hodges, and longtime friend Jason Reeves. Songs like ”Land Called Far Away” pair her distinct delivery with breezy acoustic guitars and a distinctly organic energy. Meanwhile, ”Floodgates” begins with shimmering keys and propulsive handclaps as she carries a soaring hook. ”Never Getting Over You” builds into a powerful refrain after a subtle verse. Features the hit “Try.”\n\nCapsize – Angst In My Veins CD/LP (Equal Vision)\n\nNew album The San Diego, CA-based melodic hardcore outfit.\n\nChrome – Alien Soundtracks I & II [Reissue 1977/1988] CD (Cleopatra)\n\nThe complete Alien Soundtracks saga now available on one disc. Experimental dystopian sci-fi rock from the spaciest San Francisco-based proto-industrial legends, originally released in 1977. The landmark Alien Soundtracks has been widely proclaimed one of the most innovative rock albums ever and was subsequently revisited by the band in 1988 with a sequel that explores similar musical and lyrical themes.\n\nThe Stanley Clarke Band – Up CD (Mack Avenue)\n\nThe legendary bassist’s new album is equal parts electric and acoustic bass.\n\nDavenport Cabinet – Damned Renegades CD/LP (Equal Vision)\n\nDavenport Cabinet features Travis Stever of Coheed And Cambria.\n\nDecapitated – Blood Mantra CD/CD+DVD (Nuclear Blast)\n\nSixth album from the death metal band. With their emphasis on inventive songwriting and technical prowess, Decapitated has earned the respect of their musical peers and have gained a devoted fan base. Vogg, the band’s musical mastermind, creates songs that often feature blazing tempos, crushing riffs and memorable guitar solos. Available in Regular and Deluxe editions. Deluxe adds a bonus DVD.\n\nMadi Diaz – Phantom CD (Nettwerk)\n\nMadi Diaz’s Phantom is an open-faced and undeniably honest chronicle of falling down, getting back up, and heading to the horizon. The songs expand upon Madi’s brand of sophisticated indie pop, taking on grungy, pulsating bass lines that open up to shimmering, expansive chords, punchy drum beats and unfettered vocal swagger.\n\nDrottnar – Stratum CD (Endtime Productions)\n\nEnding seven years of silence, Norway’s Drottnar return fire with a hail of sonic bullets. Through eight tracks of disharmonic bunker metal, they force seemingly formless structures into terrifying monoliths of industrial strength.\n\nKat Edmonson – The Big Picture CD (Sony Masterworks)\n\nThe Big Picture introduces extraordinary new layers of pop craft, highlighting Kat’s uniquely infectious vocal style as well as her equally exceptional songwriting skills, blending memorable hooks with lyrics that are witty, wise and tender. The album is a delicious batch of pop perfection with songs that are tight, polished and more upbeat than anything she’s done before. Edmonson draws from a wellspring of ’50s and ’60s pop, AM radio, present-day pop-rock, and movie soundtracks.\n\nElectric Wizard – Time To Die CD/2xLP+MP3 (Spinefarm)\n\nElectric Wizard return with their first new album since 2010. Their astounding eighth album Time To Die fizzes and crackles with the malevolent energy of a giant black sun blotting out the sky; this is their heaviest album since magnum opus Dope Throne (2000), their most evil since fan favorite Come My Fanatics (1997), and the most acidic and psychedelic of their career to date.\n\nElectric Youth – Innerworld CD/LP (Secretly Canadian)\n\n“Crafted in the image of nu-romantic synth-pop acts like Soft Cell and Yaz, Electric Youth’s Innerworld is awash in ’80s earmarks. In fact, Yaz’s Vince Clarke lent a hand (and a Yamaha CS80) to the album. The arpeggiated melodies and programmed drums that course through Innerworld evoke memories of lost ’80s hits, hinting at the likes of Berlin, Nu Shooz, Scandal and Regina, especially in tracks like ‘Without You’ and the slower ballad ‘If All She Has Is You.’ Electric Youth operates with a sense of remove, though, evocative of icy Italo hits of that same era.” – NPR\n\nRamblin’ Jack Elliott – The Hightone Years 3xCD (Rockbeat)\n\nThis triple-disc collection contains Jack Ellliot’s two most popular albums, Friends Of Mine and The Long Ride. Both feature artists such as Tom Russell, Emmylou Harris, Dave Alvin, Bob Weir and more. Also included a rare 1997 concert with Jack singing his signature songs and telling stories about his life as a troubadour.\n\nMelissa Etheridge – This Is M.E. CD/LP (M.E. Records)\n\nRecorded in New York and Los Angeles, This Is M.E. features 11 new songs all written or co-written by Etheridge along with writers such as Jon Levine (Andy Grammer), Jerrod Bettis (Birdy, Adele), Jerry Wonda and Roccstar and includes tracks produced by Levine, Bettis and Mark Batson (Grace Potter & The Nocturnals).\n\nEvergrey – Hymns For The Broken CD (AFM)\n\nThree and a half years after Glorious Collision, Swedish metallers return with a brand new album.\n\nExcel – Split Image [Reissue/1987] CD/LP (Southern Lord)\n\nFollowing their 2013 reunion, the Californian hardcore/thrash metal crossover band Excel has teamed up with Southern Lord for this expanded reissue their debut album (originally released through Suicidal and Caroline Records in 1987). Widely regarded as a classic album, Split Image was produced by Randy Burns (Death, Possessed, Megadeth, Kreator, Suicidal Tendencies).\n\nThe Fervor – Bleeder CD (Karate Body)\n\nLouisville’s The Fervor formed around the husband/wife pair of Natalie (voice and keys) and Ben (guitar and harmony) Felker. The accumulating thunderhead of “Moment Of Truth” and the sly, snapping shifts in “The Void” move forward toward bringing light to mysteries of personality amd intimacy — but without any pretense of a definitive answer, and far removed from any calming platitudes.\n\nFinch – Back To Oblivion CD (Razor & Tie)\n\nIn 2003, Finch took the post-hardcore world by storm with its gold-selling, debut record, What It Is To Burn. In 2006, the band released their sophomore album, Say Hello To Sunshine. In 2013 (after a band hiatus), Finch reunited for a 10 Year Anniversary Tour of What It Is to Burn, playing the album from start to finish in venues all over the world. Back To Oblivion is there first new album in five years. Vinyl version due November 10.\n\nFinnegan’s Hell – Drunk, Sick & Blue CD (Heptown)\n\nNew album includes their Celtic Punk hit ”Drunken Christmas,” which was voted ‘best Christmas song of the year’ in 2013 by the readers of Sweden’s biggest music Magazine, Gaffa. Also includes the band’s classic version of ”The Molly Maguires,” which has become an underground hit on YouTube with more than half a million views.\n\nFlying Colors – Second Nature CD/LP (Mascot)\n\nFlying Colors is the talent-ridden supergroup consisting of guitarist Steve Morse, drummer Mike Portnoy, Neal Morse, bass player Dave LaRue and the comparatively new talent, pop singer/songwriter Casey McPherson. The band challenge conventional wisdom about combining virtuoso music and melodic songwriting on their new album, Second Nature.\n\nFreak Kitchen – Cooking With Pagans CD (Thunderstruck)\n\nThis Swedish trio has always been a tremendously respected live act, and for the first time their energetic live vibe has been captured in the studio. Influences stretch from AC/DC to classical South Indian music.\n\nFumaca Preta – Fumaca Preta CD/LP (Soundway)\n\nFumaca Preta’s (pronounced Foomassa Pretta – meaning Black Smoke) hard hitting, free-wheeling debut album brings together elements of tropicalia, psychedelic rock, fuzz funk, musique concrète, acid house, audiophonic electronics, hair metal, voodoo and African, Brazilian and Latin rhythms.\n\nFunction/Vatican Shadow – Games Have Rules CD/2xLP (Hospital Productions)\n\nCollaborative album of evocative and classic techno and ambient.\n\nLee Gamble – Koch CD/2xLP (Pan)\n\nSharing some stylistic affinity with his previous records, which excavated his deeply personal history with UK jungle and rave, and techno, this new work dives even deeper to reveal a singular and intimate musical vantage point, shifting to approaching music as projection, state, hallucination, an other place. With Koch we experience an artist constructing a future after time spent deconstructing the past. If you dig recent stuff on Modern Love (Andy Stott, Demdike Stare, Miles, G.H.), then you need to own this album.\n\nGenesis – R-Kive 3xCD (Atlantic)\n\nThree-CD collection containing the prog band’s biggest hits plus solo recordings from the key members. Chronologically ordered, R-Kive features Genesis’s biggest hits including “Invisible Touch,” “Turn It On Again,” “Land Of Confusion,” and “I Can’t Dance.” Along the way it also visits Mike + The Mechanics’ classics “The Living Years” and “Over My Shoulder,” Collins’ “In The Air Tonight” and his Philip Bailey duet “Easy Lover,” and Peter Gabriel’s “Solsbury Hill.”\n\nAlice Gerrard – Follow The Music CD/LP (Tompkins Square)\n\nAlice Gerrard is a trailblazing folksinger who famously collaborated with Hazel Dickens. Their classic recordings for Folkways and Rounder in the ‘60s and ‘70s “rank among the most influential recordings in folk music history,” (AllMusic), and laid the groundwork for many artists, especially female bluegrass and folk musicians. Follow The Music features traditional tunes and original songs by Alice, produced by Hiss Golden Messenger’s M.C. Taylor, and features members of Hiss Golden Messenger and Megafaun.\n\nRobin Gibb – 50 St. Catherine’s Drive CD (Rhino)\n\nThe last solo album by the legendary songwriter, performer and founding Bee Gee, Robin Gibb, who died in May 2012. 50 St Catherine’s Drive was compiled by his wife Dwina Gibb and son RJ Gibb, and includes most of the tracks originally recorded for the album, plus the last tracks written and recorded by Robin Gibb.\n\nCharlie Haden/Jim Hall – Charlie Haden/Jim Hall CD (Blue Note)\n\nArchive release of a previously-unreleased performance by these two recently departed masters at the 1990 Montreal International Jazz Festival. At first this might seem an unusual pairing – the dean of the avant-garde bass and a fellow that defined mainstream jazz guitar – but Charlie Haden and Jim Hall shared much common ground.\n\nHappy Family – Minimal Gods CD (Cuneiform)\n\nHappy Family first appeared in the mid 1990s as part of the explosion of exciting, underground bands roaring out of Japan at that time. They released two albums of over-the-top avant-rock for Cuneiform Records in 1995 and 1997 and then fell silent. Reforming with original personnel, they are back and just as heavy and intense as they ever were.\n\nHeads – Everybody Knows We Got Nowhere [Reissue/2000] 2xCD/2xLP (Rooster)\n\nDigitally remastered and expanded edition of this 2000 album including bonus B-sides, demos and more. Broken hands, lost Rickenbackers, and sliced tendons aside, Simon Price (guitar, vocals), Hugo Morgan (bass), Wayne Maskell (drums) and Paul Allen (guitar) hit many highs during this time. It represents the full force of the Heads’ psychedelic pummel, their trippiest, most psych collection, brutal yet beautiful. The hardcover, full-color box set wrapped in a specially printed tote bag, includes a 70-plus-minute CD of previously unreleased material culled from Price’s CD-R archives.\n\nThe History Of Apple Pie – Feel Something CD/LP (Marshall Teller)\n\nFeel Somthing is the follow-up to last year’s Out Of View debut, which saw the British indie band propelled into the spotlight – hitting #8 in the UK Indie Breakers Chart, #2 in the UK Record Store Chart and winning fans the world over with their infectious fuzzed-out candied pop sound. Feel Something features ten tracks including the piano-laden lead single “Tame” and last year’s surf rock referencing “Don’t You Wanna Be Mine?” Recorded over the last few months at Sublime Studios in London, like its predecessor, it was again produced and engineered by the band’s Jerome Watson with additional engineering by Joshua Third of The Horrors and Charles Reeves.\n\nHot Rize – When I’m Free CD (Ten In Hand)\n\nEver since Tim O’ Brien, Pete Wernick, Nick Foster, and Charles Sawtelle first appeared onstage together in 1978, Hot Rize has been one of bluegrass music’s most beloved and critically-acclaimed bands punctuated by winning the IBMA’s first Entertainer Of The Year Award. Although it’s been almost 25 years since their last studio album, the foursome – with guitarist Bryan Sutton taking the place of the late Sawtelle – hasn’t lost a step, as they prove on their new record, When I’m Free.\n\nHow To Disappear Completely – Daughters Of Eve CD (MRI Associated)\n\nHow To Disappear Completely formed in the spring of 2012 when singer/guitarist James Bailey and bass player Thomas Calandra both formerly of Syracuse hardcore band Architect got together. They then approached violinist/keyboardist Devon Robillard and shortly after his addition they recruited drummer Ian MacNeil for percussion duties. Within a few months after writing and demoing songs, HTDC got Kyle Heath to fill in the empty second guitar spot.\n\nEngelbert Humperdinck – Engelbert Calling 2xCD (MRI Associated)\n\nNew double-disc duets album featuring Humperdinck’s collaborations with Elton John, Cliff Richard, Olivia Newton-John, Willie Nelson, Lulu, Gene Simmons, Shelby Lynne, Andrea Corr, Smokey Robinson, Johnny Mathis, Neil Sedaka, Dionne Warwick, Wynonna Judd, Ron Sexsmith, and many others.\n\nChris Herbert – Constants CD (Room40)\n\nSounds sourced from field recordings and domestic environments are augmented by shortwave radio, degraded cassettes, processed guitars, cymbals, and more.\n\nItchy-O – Burn The Navigator CD/LP (Alternative Tentacles)\n\nThis throbbing 32-piece band of masked chaos invites all to dissolve the performer/audience divide and melt into the bedlam. Denver’s Itchy-O Marching Band is a percussion-centered electronic ensemble and the mobile arm of the experimental film/music troupe Itchy-O. With a driving tribal drum corps complemented by an arsenal of special surround sound effects units (including synthesizers, theremin, vocoders, and several other hand held electronic devices), Itchy-O immerses the listener from every angle in an electric bog of music, ephemera and spectacle.\n\nLady Antibellum – 747 CD (Capitol Nashville)\n\nFifth album from the seven-time Grammy winning trio. Available in Regular and Deluxe editions. Deluxe adds four bonus tracks.\n\nLa Flingue – Adhesif Scotch Zero Trois LP (P. Trash)\n\nA blend of razor sharp guitar salvos, hard-hitting punky backbeats, and cranky vocals in their catchy, and unique French/English mixed style.\n\nLes Marinellis – Les Marinellis LP (P. Trash)\n\nSweeping, frisky ‘60s garage pop.\n\nLiminanas – (I’ve Got Trouble In Mind) 7” & Rare Stuff 2009/2014 CD/LP+MP3 (Trouble In Mind)\n\nNew compilation of The Liminanas’ out of print singles and compilation tracks, some making their first appearance on vinyl. Every non-album track you need is here, from the out-of-print Hozac single, to the Trouble In Mind 2011 limited tour single to their appearances on various compilations and tributes, all in one handy place.\n\nThe Liptones – Sidospår CD/LP (Amty)\n\nFollowing the overwhelming response to a ‘hidden track’ on their second album which was sung in Swedish, the band decided to take this concept one step beyond by recording a full album with all tracks sung in Swedish. Continuing with their brand of high-energy ska, The Liptones combine the sounds of 2-Tone, punk, and original ‘60s ska and soul.\n\nJon Lord/Deep Purple & Friends – Celebrating Jon Lord The Rock Legend 2xCD (Eagle Rock)\n\nThe 2014 edition of The Sunflower Jam was divided into two parts the first part spotlighting Jon Lord’s classical music compositions and this second part featuring highlights of his career as a rock musician. Spread out over two CDs, the first disc features Deep Purple Mk III songs played by Paice with the old friend Glenn Hughes, together with Iron Maiden’s Bruce Dickinson, Rick Wakeman of Yes fame, Steve Balsamo (who sang in the late Jon Lord band and in his last studio album Concerto), members of The Temperance Movement, ex-members of Whitesnake, Marsden and Moody and “The Modfather” Paul Weller. The second disc features a set performed by the current Deep Purple lineup.\n\nMadchild – Switched On CD (Battle Axe)\n\nMadchild is notorious for his work as the lead MC with Canadian hip-hop phenoms, Swollen Members.\n\nJimbo Mathus – Jimmy The Kid CD (Big Legal Mess)\n\nJimmy The Kid was recorded in 2006-2007, and signaled a departure from the more bluesy recordings he had been releasing since disbanding Squirrel Nut Zippers and doing a four year stint with blues patriarch Buddy Guy. The recording includes some of Mathus’s best songwriting and some true honky-tonk gems like “Check Out Time,” and “Highway At Night,” as well as some good-old redneck rock and roll.\n\nMeshuggah – Ophidian Trek 2xCD+DVD/2xCD+Blu-ray (Nuclear Blast)\n\nFormed in the college town of Umea in northern Sweden in 1987, Meshuggah is one of the few purely and honestly lateral-thinking forces, genuinely dedicated to pushing the boundaries of extreme music. Ophidian Trek captures their entire live gig at Brixton, London in 2013, and is paired with a DVD or Blu-ray film of the show.\n\nRaul Midon – Don’t Hesitate CD (Artistry Music)\n\nSinger/songwriter, guitarist and multi-instrumental virtuoso Raul Midon returns with a new collection of jazz, R&B and folk infused selections.\n\nMontibus Communitas – The Pilgrim To The Absolute CD/LP+MP3 (Beyond Beyond Is Beyond)\n\nNew album from the Peruvian sound collective. Each of the album’s six songs is a chapter in which we find the titular pilgrim (which is the band/listener/everything at once) on another stage of this massive, mesmerizing, metaphysical road trip. Heavy, heady stuff, without question. This is nothing less than a spiritual, ambient-art, high-altitude, altered-state, improvisational sonic prayer that’s equally human & down-to-earth (which is floating in space).\n\nMonty Python – Monty Python’s Total Rubbish: The Complete Collection 9xCD/10xLP (Virgin)\n\nFollowing the release of Monty Python Sings (Again), the Pythons also unveil a career spanning box set. Monty Python’s nine UK albums Monty Python’s Flying Circus, Another Monty Python Record, Monty Python’s Previous Record, Matching Tie And Handkerchief, Live At Drury Lane, Holy Grail, Life Of Brian, Monty Python’s Contractual Obligation Album, and The Meaning Of Life are united for the first time to create the ultimate collectors’ edition purchase. Both CD and LP releases also include a limited edition 7” Single of their 1974 flexi-disc “Monty Python’s Tiny Black Round Thing.”\n\nMr. Big – …The Stories We Could Tell CD (Frontiers)\n\nNew studio album from the melodic hard rockers.\n\nNico Muhly – Two Boys 2xCD (Nonesuch)\n\nDouble-disc release of Nico Muhly s opera Two Boys, recorded live during the Metropolitan Opera’s 2013 production with conductor David Robertson and director Bartlett Sher. The two-act opera, which features a libretto by award-winning playwright Craig Lucas, is loosely based on true events and follows a lonely detective whose investigation of a seemingly simple crime draws her into a complex web of online intrigue.\n\nJoe Mullins & The Radio Ramblers – Another Day From Life CD (Rebel)\n\nIn a relatively short time, Ohioan Joe Mullins has established himself and his group as one of the leaders of today’s crop of traditional bluegrass bands. But what may seem like a short time is really more like a lifetime of involvement with the music: the son of a noted fiddler, promoter, and DJ Paul Mullins, Joe has extended the family’s extremely successful track record, adding ownership of several radio stations to the highlights of a unique career.\n\nNo-Man – Together We’re Stranger [Reissue/2003] CD (Kscope)\n\nOriginally released in 2003, No-Man’s fifth album Together We’re Stranger saw the duo of Tim Bowness and Porcupine Tree’s Steven Wilson further extending the reach of its panoramic soundscapes and cracked, mournful, ballads. Boasting impressive performances from Ben Castle (clarinets), Roger Eno (harmonium) and Gramophone’s David Picking (percussion, trumpet), amongst others, the album is a powerful and emotionally direct statement that has deservedly garnered cult acclaim. This 2014 version has been remastered by Steven Wilson and includes two bonus tracks with the included booklet features sleeve notes from Mojo Magazine’s Johnny Black.\n\nNonpoint – The Return CD (Razor & Tie)\n\nAfter 17 years in the game, the Florida nu-metal quintet sustains the same energy that sparked its foundation back in 1997. In February 2014, the guys entered Groovemaster Studios with Grammy Award-nominated producer Johnny K (Disturbed, Staind, Megadeth) and engineer Daniel Salcidoto.\n\nOasis – (What’s The Story) Morning Glory? [Reissue/1995] CD/3xCD/2xLP+MP3 (Big Brother Recordings)\n\nOasis’ multi-platinum follow up to Definitely Maybe has been remastered reissued as a standard single-disc as well as Deluxe triple-CD and double-LP set (which features a digital download bundle of all bonus CD content).

But there’s a summery, chipper lightness to many of the songs here, and if I had to guess, I’d name Buddy Holly as the single greatest influence on the whole project.” – Stereogum\n\nPhobocosm – Deprived CD (Dark Descent)\n\nDarkened death metal from Canada.\n\nPine Hill Haints – Majik Sounds Of The Pine Hill Haints CD/LP (K Records)\n\nThis is the fourth Halloween dance party long player the Haints have cut for K.\n\nPrince – ART OFFICIAL AGE CD (WB)\n\nWhile it plays like a classic Prince album, produced, arranged, composed, and performed by the Man in Purple, ART OFFICIAL AGE is also a contemporary concoction of soul, R&B and funk.\n\nPrince & 3rdeyegirl – Plectrumelectrum CD (WB)\n\nPlectrumelectrum is a classic band record, with 3rdeyegirl – a funk band comprised of Prince, Donna Grantis (guitar), Hannah Ford Welton (drums) and Ida Nielsen (bass). Recorded live and in analog, the album is an electrifying funk-rock statement. Many of the tracks were performed live on the “Hit & Run” tours of the UK earlier this year – incendiary performances in a series of historic venues – which led The Guardian to declare ”These are performances by one of the greatest funk-rock bands ever.”\n\nRapoon – Cultural Forgeries CD (Alrealon Musique)\n\nRobin Storey explains: “In 2013 I was asked by my friend Robert Pepper (Pas Musique) if I wanted to do an ‘unplugged’ album. I was intrigued by the idea and agreed. I thought of ways of constructing pieces that did not involve any ‘processing.’ I wanted to make something that was essentially acoustic recordings but which were composed and arranged to give some depth and intricacy to them. The treatments and processing are as much a part of composition as are the instruments and the recordings. In a way I failed to make an unplugged album but I did make something which was outside of my usual work process and for that i am thankful.”\n\nDuncan Reid And The Big Heads – The Difficult Second Album CD (LBH)\n\nSecond solo album from legendary punk rocker Duncan ‘Kid’ Reid, best known for his work with The Boys. As singer and bass player of Joey Ramone’s favorite band, Duncan rode on the crest of a wave during punk’s original late-‘70s heyday as part of a wider collective of friends and peers that included Sex Pistols, The Clash, Generation X and a host of other power-chord pioneers.\n\nDjango Reinhardt –Best Of The Broadcast Performances 2xCD (Fuel 2000)\n\nDouble-CD anthology is drawn entirely from recordings made between 1940 and 1950.\n\nCalvin Richardson – I Am Calvin CD (BMG Rights Management)\n\nDubbed as the ‘Prince of Soul,’ Grammy-nominated recording artist Calvin Richardson has made it his mission today’s keeper of yesterday’s soul music.\n\nJ Rider – No Longer Anonymous [Reissue/1996] CD/LP+MP3 (Machu Picchu)\n\nAfter the 1976 release of Inside the Shadow, the band Anonymous decided to change their name to J Rider and pursued a similar rich vein of impeccable songwriting, but this time adding more hard rock to the mix. Remastered and restored by Warren Defever for maximum brilliance.\n\nRitual Howls – Turkish Leather CD/LP (Felte)\n\nThis three Detroit three-piece mixes industrial, death rock, and Spaghetti Western guitar sounds.\n\nRoberto Rodriguez – Aguares: The Book Of Angels Volume 23 CD (Tzadik)\n\nRoberto Rodriguez’s dynamic blending of Cuban music with the Jewish tradition has produced some of the most popular and best selling CDs on the Radical Jewish series. Here he turns his brilliant arranging skills and fabulous all-star ensemble to nine beautiful melodies from Zorn’s lyrical Book Of Angels. Recorded in Israel with some of the strongest musicians out of the exciting Israeli music scene the music is at once familiar and surprising, touching on traditions while bringing them into the 21st century with imagination, wit and a passionate creativity.\n\nSteve Rothery Band – Live In Rome CD (Inside Out U.S.)\n\nThe legendary guitarist and founding member of Marillion, Steve Rothery has long been known for his unique playing style, and in the live setting the experience cannot be matched. This brilliant live set sees Rothery airing tracks from his forthcoming solo album, The Ghosts Of Pripyat, which was financed by an incredibly successful Kickstarter campaign that reached its target in the first 24 hours.\n\nRuby Fray – Grackle CD/LP (K Records)\n\nComing a long way from her debut album, Pith, Ruby Fray’s new album Grackle blends Americana sweetness with sludgy dissonance. Helmed by Emily Beanblossom, the band teamed up with Pith producer, Ben Hargett, to record the album at Dub Narcotic Studio in Olympia, WA. Their 2014 recording preserves the playful jangly genre-bouncing enervation found in their previous work while insisting on a more disciplined approach to songwriting.\n\nThe Rural Alberta Advantage – Mended With Gold CD/LP (Saddle Creek)\n\nMended With Gold is the third album from the Canadian folk indie folk outfit. The ideas and moods created in these songs tie back to the album title Mended With Gold, embracing the idea that the breakage and repair of an object becomes part of its unique history and ultimately makes it more valuable instead of a blemish to disguise. The Rural Alberta Advantage have taken all of their successes, losses, adventures, and heartbreaks over the past few years, and forged them together into an unforgettably powerful work of beauty. (Limited vinyl version pressed on clear wax with metallic gold splatter.)\n\nDylan Ryan/Sand – Circa CD (Cuneiform)\n\nTwo years after the release of their impressive debut Sky Bleached, Dylan Ryan/Sand release Circa, a purposeful continuation of the aesthetic that the group had fostered on its first record. Circa, which features guitarist Timothy Young (David Sylvian, Reggie Watts, Wayne Horvitz), bassist Devin Hoff (Nels Cline Singers, Yoko Ono, Cibo Matto) and leader/composer/drummer Dylan Ryan (Herculaneum) has a wholly unique styling, which ranges from the fearlessly improvisational to the tender; the abrasive to the understated.\n\nSPM – The Son Of Norma 2xCD (Dope House)\n\nSPM (South Park Mexican) embody the elements of Texas southern rap. He has garnished a cult following built up through the Texas rap scene through numerous high chart topping releases and his association with legendary DJ Screw ‘Chopped & Screwed’ culture.\n\nSaigon – G.S.N.T 3: The Troubled Times Of Brian Carenard CD/LP (Squid Ink Squad, LLC)\n\nRapper/actor/reality TV star Saigon is back with his third album.\n\nThe Script – No Sound Without Silence CD (Columbia)\n\nFourth studio album from the multi-platinum selling Irish rock trio from Dublin, which has been called “Ireland’s biggest band since U2.”\n\nSea Oleena – Shallow CD/LP (Lefse)\n\nCharlotte Oleena began writing simple soundscapes as Sea Oleena in early 2010, shaped by melancholy and never wanting to leave her bedroom. With an initial focus on recording, she began playing shows by herself regularly a year after the release of her first EP. Since then she’s played shows with a handful of musicians, but has recently been playing alone again, moving pointedly in the direction of wide and open ambient worlds. At the end of 2012, following two self-released EPs, Oleena began writing what would become her first label-released album, Shallow. Her tactful use of textures and instrumentation make for a blissful, cinematic listen that’s centered on what matters most: her captivating voice.\n\nSempiternal Dusk – Sempiternal Dusk CD (Dark Descent)\n\nRitualistic and dark death metal.\n\nDavid Shea – Rituals CD (Room40)\n\nElectro-acoustic deconstructions and semiotic acoustic renderings with contributions from Oren Ambarchi and Lawrence English.\n\nBlake Shelton – Bringing Back The Sunshine CD (WB)\n\nNew album from the country superstar.\n\nElizabeth Shepherd – Signal CD (Linus)\n\nVelvety-voiced pianist Elizabeth Shepherd arrived on the international scene in 2006 when her debut album Start To Move was voted one of the top three jazz albums of the year by the listeners of the influential Gilles Peterson Show on BBC Radio Worldwide. Since then, the Canadian soul-jazz innovator has released three widely acclaimed records and toured extensively in North America, Europe, Japan and Latin America. Along with Esperanza Spalding, Robert Glasper, and Jose James she is seen as part of a wave of young jazz musicians bringing the art form to a new generation of music fans.\n\nSick Of It All – Last Act Of Defiance CD/LP+CD (Century Media)\n\nSick Of It All’s tenth album — 14 anthems of heartfelt, no-holds-barred hardcore.\n\nRicky Skaggs And Sharon White – Hearts Like Ours CD (Skaggs Family)\n\nThe multiple Grammy, CMA and Dove Award winners are married both on stage and off in this tender work that they have waited their whole professional careers to craft in perfect harmony together. Hearts Like Ours captures a modern take on a classic country.\n\nSlow Magic – How To Run Away CD/LP (Downtown)\n\nSophomore album from masked producer. “”Moody and full of super-intense synth sounds and catchy percussion… dreamy yet as refreshing as ever, this is your smooth soundtrack to the last days of summer.” – Stereofox\n\nDavid Smith/Bill Laswell/John Zorn – The Dream Membrane CD (Tzadik)\n\nThis fabulous collaborative musical project features the legendary magus David Chaim Smith reading selections from his mystical text The Awakening Ground along with the magical pioneer of dark ambient music Bill Laswell on bass and drones, and John Zorn on shofar and alto saxophone. Evocative and meditative, this is a rare and unique project that synthesizes Kabbalah, mysticism and the hypnotic swirls of dark ambient music.\n\nSoft Swells – Floodlights CD/LP (Modern Outsider)\n\nDrums shake, organs swell, guitars rock and vocals soar.\n\nSons Of Bill – Love And Logic CD/LP (Gray Fox)\n\nCharlottesville, Virginia’s Sons Of Bill find inspiration in the region’s rich literary and cultural traditions. With Grammy nominated producer and former Uncle Tupelo/Wilco drummer Ken Coomer at the helm, the band has elevated their artistry to new heights by making an album that is as current as it is rooted in the foundations of early alt-country, long before the term Americana was coined.\n\nSoulbender – Soulbender II CD (Rat Pak)\n\nFormed over a decade ago in Seattle, Washington, Soulbender is comprised of Queensrÿche guitarist Michael Wilton, vocalist Nick Pollock (My Sisters Machine), guitarist Dave Groves (ex-Tin Pan/Fallen Angel) and drummer Wes Hallam (ex-Assault/Fallen Angel). Michael Wilton describes Soulbender as a very progressive, hard rock band with very intense musicians and a couple of the members are prodigies.\n\nSparzanza – Circle CD (Black Cult)\n\nSeventh release from the Swedish band. The production of Circle is the most natural sounding in their discography. The dark feel that was present on Death Is Certain Life Is Not is subtler this time, allowing more space for their raw grooves and heaviness.\n\nStiff Little Fingers – No Going Back CD (Mondo Music)\n\nNew album from the veteran Irish Punk band led by Jake Burns. Stiff Little Fingers are a seminal punk rock band from Northern Ireland, formed in 1977. No Going Back is their first album in a decade.\n\nMarty Stuart And His Fabulous Superlatives – Saturday Night/Sunday Morning CD/2xLP (Superlatone)\n\nOn his new double-album, Stuart captures all the authentic neon and stained-glass hues of country music from love and sex to heartache and hardship to family and God across its twenty-three tracks.\n\nSylvian/Fripp – First Day [Reissue/1993] CD (DGM)\n\nSylvian/Fripp – Damage [Reissue/1994] CD (DGM)\n\nExperimental yet accessible, song driven yet leaving ample room for instrumental exploration, The First Day is a great advert for such occasional meetings insofar as it manages to showcase the individual strengths of both artists while drawing something new and unexpected from their joint work. Damage was recorded at the final London concerts in December 1993 and issued in 1994. Whereas the studio album had a measured grace and power, the live album was even more muscular on the rock pieces, drawing some extraordinary performances from all contributors.\n\nTantric – Blue Room Archives CD (Pavement Ent.)\n\nThis collection of songs includes acoustic versions of their two biggest singles ”Breakdown” and ”Mourning.” Also included are rare and unreleased tracks extending over Tantric’s entire career.\n\nTape – Casino CD (Hapna Sweden)\n\nTape’s sixth full-length begs to be listened to on headphones, for its quiet splendor, its swelling tones, and the microscopic details scuttling across the floor of the mix.\n\nTeam Spirit – Killing Time CD/LP (Vice)\n\n“Historically, every time rock ‘n’ roll has started to seem terminally stagnant some group of young musicians will power-wash away the stylistic and philosophical cruft that the genre’s accumulated, relocating its live-wire heart and giving it new life by connecting it to the core principles that it’s forgotten about. In the past, that task has fallen on punks, alt-rockers, and garage rock revivalists, and today it’s falling on a loosely affiliated community of bands that combine all the above with the kind of frills-free, gut-punch energy that’s made legends out of bands like the Stooges and AC/DC. One of those groups is Team Spirit, founded by former Passion Pit keyboardist Ayad Al-Adhammy after an aesthetic epiphany where he ditched synthesizers for a six-string. Killing Time is a raging gang fight of classic rock guitar riffing and sugar-sweet pop-punk hooks with the potential to connect with van-driving, horns-throwing headbangers as deeply as it does with stage-diving punk kids.” – Entertainment Weekly\n\nThe Time And Space Machine – Presents: The Way Out Sound From In CD/2xLP (Ample Play)\n\nAmple Play Records releases a heavy-duty collection of Richard Norris’ recent Time And Space Machine mixes. A man of many guises, he has operated as a duo—as The Grid with Dave Ball, as Beyond The Wizard’s Sleeve with Erol Alkan—but when it’s time for some solo sonic action, he records and remixes as The Time And Space Machine. Here he remixes tracks by Warpaint, Tame Impala, Jagwar Ma, Psychemagik, Temples, The Sufis, and more.\n\nTorch Runner – Endless Running CD/LP (Southern Lord)\n\n“North Carolina grindcore trio Torch Runner have been a force to be reckoned with since their inception, previously releasing two excellent full lengths as well as a split with their similarly bleak and harsh peers in Young And In The Way. Endless Nothing marks the band’s third LP and their first for new label Southern Lord, and it’s the most intense material from the band to date by a long shot and undoubtedly one of the heaviest, most volatile and overall best extreme records I’ve heard from any band in any genre in 2014.” – Toxicbreedsfunhouse.blogspot.com\n\nTove Lo – Queen Of The Clouds CD (Island)\n\nHighly anticipated debut album from the Swedish songbird. Tove Lo first entered the pop arena earlier this year in March with the release of her critically acclaimed debut EP, Truth Serum, and widely appraised live performances at this 2014’s SXSW in Austin, TX. Vinyl version due October 14.\n\nThe Tragic Thrills – The Tragic Thrills CD (Washington Square)\n\nThe Tragic Thrills manage to infuse a poignant narrative into meticulously crafted music. The band incorporates strands of rock, pop, folk, and country to create a modern and alternative take on those genres for their enthralling debut album.\n\nTrigger Hippy – Trigger Hippy CD (Rounder)\n\n“You can see this as a player’s band,” explains co-founder Steve Gorman, who also co-founded The Black Crowes, “but it really is a band, in the true sense of that word.” Vocals are shared by multi-platinum singer Joan Osborne and veteran recording artist Jackie Greene. Rounding out the broup are lead guitarist Tom Bukovac and bassist Nick Govrik, who wrote many of the band’s songs. The Nashville-based quintet’s debut album Trigger Hippy draws on the strengths of all five, both individually and collectively, and showcases influences and inspiration from Memphis soul to rock, country and blues. One can sense The Band here, and Little Feat, some Led Zeppelin, and a tent revival. Gorman rightly calls it a “rock band that can jam.” Vinyl version due November 24.\n\nUnit 731 – The Hive Mind CD/LP (Deathwish Inc.)\n\nUnit 731 is a hardcore metal band formed in Pittsburgh in 2005. The band combines death metal, hardcore, and slam to create a heavy and chaotic sound that Pittsburgh bands are notable for. Influences include Dying Fetus, All Out War, Irate, and Built Upon Frustration.\n\nVarious Artists [Tim Gane] – Kollektion 01: Sky Records Compiled by Tim Gane CD/LP (Bureau B)\n\nFirst release in this compilation series is an overview of the hugely-important German Krautrock label Sky Records, compiled by Tim Gane (Stereolab). Artists include: Cluster, Moebius, Roedelius, Gunter Schickert, Michael Rother, and Asmus Tietchens.\n\nVarious Artists – Arkansas at 78RPM: Corn Dodgers & Hoss Hair Pullers CD (Dust-To-Digital)\n\nA collection of original 78RPM hillbilly and song-based country music from 1928-1937.\n\nVarious Artists – The Soul Of Designer Records 4xCD (Big Legal Mess)\n\nIf passion and fervor were electricity, the performances on The Soul Of Designer Records could put the glow in every neon sign in the city on the Mississippi River where they were recorded. Between 1967 and 1977 Designer label founder Style Wooten and his studio main man Roland Janes (a heroic figure in Memphis music), produced between 400 and 500 gospel singles. Many of the artists they recorded came from Tennessee, Mississippi and Arkansas, but as the label’s reputation grew they began arriving from more far flung locales—Chicago, St. Louis, Boston, Ohio, the Carolinas, Florida, California—sometimes literally waiting in line for their turn to cut at Janes’ Sonic Studios. Many of these numbers share a badass, wild-eyed energy—the same primitive, reverb-soaked mojo that drives the classic Memphis rockabilly, garage rock and blues that was Janes’ specialty.\n\nVarious Artists – We Are The Music Makers! Preserving The Soul Of America’s Music 2xCD (Music Maker)\n\nThe Music Maker Relief Foundation celebrates its 20th Anniversary with this comprehensive double-disc compilation (released in conjunction with a new book and traveling exhibit). The 44-track collection includes Taj Mahal, Guitar Gabriel, John Dee Holeman, Etta Baker, The Carolina Chocolate Drops, Leyla McCalla, Ironing Board Sam, and many others, with over two hours of music.\n\nViolent Soho – Hungry Ghost CD/LP (Side One Dummy)\n\n“The Buddhist concept of the ‘hungry ghost’ neatly sums up the urgency, the want, the search of Violent Soho’s music. Amid the riffs, hooks and wail of frontman Luke Boerdam is a stark examination of the way we view the world, and the way consumer culture feeds relentlessly on itself and its urges. A fitting theory for an unapologetic, no-bullshit post-grunge cacophony, as laid bare on the Brisbane four-piece’s second album, Hungry Ghost.” – JB Hi-FI\n\nGerard Way – Hesitant Alien CD/LP (Reprise)\n\nDebut solo album from the My Chemical Romance frontman. “Opening track ‘Bureau’ is built around descending chords that find Way’s new backing band The Hormones all dressed up in Suede: Way’s most obvious touchstone here is Brett Anderson’s damaged theatrical glamour. ‘No Shows’ flits between epic anthemics and fuzzy soloing, and the prowling bass of ‘Zero Zero’ dominates the song’s distorted vocals. But it’s ‘Get The Gang Together’ that’s the outstanding highlight – riff-heavy and sleazy, it’s like Queens Of The Stone Age after an androgynous makeover. Elsewhere however, British influences abound. Aladdin Sane-era Bowie informs the punchy strut of each song. ‘Maya The Psychic’ is drawn from Ash’s book of radio bangers and the hazy tambourine shake of ‘Drugstore Perfume’ makes sense of Way’s recent live covers of The Jesus And Mary Chain’s ‘Snakedriver.’” — NME\n\nWeedeater – Sixteen Tons [Reissue/2002] CD/LP (Season Of Mist)\n\nNotorious sludge outfit Weedeater’s sophomore album is reissued on CD and made available for the first time on vinyl.\n\nLucinda Williams – Down Where The Spirit Meets The Bone CD/2xLP+CD (Highway 20)\n\nRecorded off and on between September of 2013 through March of 2014, Down Where The Spirit Meets The Bone finds Lucinda tapping into her southern roots for this double album, which features guest appearances by Greg Leisz, Tony Joe White, Pete Thomas, Gia Ciambotti, Bill Frisell and Jakob Dylan.\n\nWilli Williams – Unification: From Channel One To King Tubby’s CD (Shanachie)\n\nWilli Williams is a legendary roots reggae artist who scored the all time classic hit “Armageddon Time,” which was covered by The Clash.

Unification: From Channel One To King Tubby’s is a great lost roots classic recorded by Willi in association with fellow roots legend Yabby You in 1978-1979 at both the fabled Channel One and King Tubby’s studios.\n\nLuke Winslow-King – Everlasting Arms CD/LP+MP3 (Bloodshot)\n\nReminiscent of early ‘50s blues and soul 45s but with an updated pop-inflected rootsy twist, Everlasting Arms is equal parts Delta punk rock, jivin’ city blues and understated elegance.\n\nWitch Mountain – Mobile Of Angels CD (Profound Lore)\n\nWitch Mountain are probably Portland, Oregon’s oldest currently active metal band; they date back to 1997, formed by guitarist Rob Wrong and drummer Nathan Carson, at a time when Portland’s heavy music scene was practically non-existent. Their new album Mobile Of Angels maintains the massive, heavy, bluesy and melodic tone the band is known for.\n\nYelle – Complètement Fou CD/LP (Kemosabe)\n\nNew album from the French electropop group (when translated Complètement Fou basically means “Completely Mad”) The album was entirely produced by American hitmaker Lukasz Gottwald, best known as Dr. Luke, producer behind some of the biggest hits from Katy Perry, Kesha and Becky G.\n\nZodiac – Sonic Child CD (Prosthetic)\n\n“If you’re a fan of old-school prog rock or classical metal, this is right up your alley” – Metal Injection.

Limited copies pressed on white vinyl. “Much like his once-and-former bandmate Patrick Stickles, Betson sometimes hits the wrong note to strike the right feeling.” – Pitchfork\n\nBoothroyd – Idle Hours 12” (Tri-Angle)\n\n“Since few of us have heard much from Boothroyd (real name: Peter Boothroyd) thus far, it’s hard to work out how representative ‘NYC’ is in relation to his other material, but if you’re into the pounding textural experimentalism of Fis, the woozy, low-light patchwork of Forest Swords and the kind of horror-flecked soundscapes of the Haxan Cloak then you’ll probably be very happy indeed.” – Fact\n\nJames Brown – Live In New York LP (Cleopatra)\n\nTen stellar vintage live performances of Brown’s best, pressed on red vinyl.\n\nJohn Cale – Academy In Peril [Reissue/1972] LP (4 Men With Beards)\n\nCale’s 1972 album reissued on HQ-180gm vinyl in a die-cut custom gatefold jacket.

Skillfully arranged three-minute gems from the point where beat and folk rock turn into melodic psychedelia.” — Acid Archives\n\nThe Damned – Black Album [Reissue/1980] 2xLP (Drastic Plastic)\n\nVinyl reissue of fourth album from the British punk founding-fathers, originally released in 1980. Available on HQ-200gm black, 150gm red opaque, and 150gm dark grey vinyl.\n\nDeath – Spiritual Healing [Reissue/1990] LP (Relapse)\n\nOriginally released in 1990, Spiritual Healing marked a new turn in the Death discography, one which ushered in cleaner production, a new level of boundary pushing musicianship and songwriting skills that were previously unimaginable from a metal band.\n\nBo Diddley – Go Bo Diddley [Reissue/1959] LP (Friday Music)\n\nHQ-180gm vinyl reissue.\n\nKenny Drew – Undercurrent [Reissue/1960] LP (Blue Note)\n\nUndercurrent is the seventh recording by pianist Kenny Drew.

In 1982 he self-released two cassettes of solo material, ‘80s Cheesecake and Snappy Carrion. These cassettes document the transitional period between the early experimental Severed Heads’ albums Clean and Blubberknife before the start of something new with Since The Accident. With the advent of the then new Roland TB-303 bass synthesizer, a machine synonymous with the acid house sound, Tom began to write more beat driven material. The rhythms are made by a TR-808 drum machine, Kawai S100F and SH-1 synthesizers, plus various televisions, radios, cassette decks and pedals.\n\nEstrogen Highs – Hear Me On The Number Station LP+MP3 (Trouble In Mind)\n\nThe New Haven, CT band have always had one foot in the musical waters of New Zealand and the influence of kiwi-pop forefathers, but the band incorporates more of the avant textures of the Xpressway discography this time around.\n\nEyeswan/Hidden Cabins – Weathered [Split] 10” (Engineer)\n\nSplit vinyl release featuring two groups that specialize in folk rock with a dose of gut and grit.\n\nFozzy – Do You Wanna Start A War CD (Century Media)\n\nRecently released on CD – now available on vinyl. “We wanted to do something a little different. We love, obviously, Avenged Sevenfold or Five Finger Death Punch, we love Iron Maiden, we love Ozzy. But we also love Pink Floyd and Led Zeppelin and Queen and U2 and The Beatles, bands that would always broaden their horizons, but still sound… the core of the band’s sound was still there, but they would different things.”\n\nGenital Hospital – Street Mummy LP (P. Trash)\n\nTen catchy, forceful, and rousing KBD-garage punk tunes mired in psychedelic intoxication.\n\nGrade – Separate The Magnets [Reissue/1997] LP (Second Nature/Dine Alone)\n\nDeluxe vinyl reissue of the Nineties-bred screamo tacticians’ 1997 10” EP, reissued on HQ-180gm vinyl mastered at 45RPM with updated artwork.\n\nFreddie Hubbard – Ready For Freddie [Reissue/1961] LP (Blue Note)\n\nReady For Freddie by jazz trumpeter Freddie Hubbard features Grammy winner Wayne Shorter on tenor sax, McCoy Tyner on piano, Art Davis on bass, Elvin Jones on drums and Bernard McKinney on euphonium. Reissued as part of the overall Blue Note 75th anniversary reissue campaign.\n\nIKO – ’83 [Reissue/1982] LP (Medical Records)\n\nThis coveted album by minimal synth aficionados around the globe has been out of print and very rare since it’s original release in 1982.
