Rize

RIZE is an intimate completely fresh portrayal of inner-city youth who have created art--and often family--where before there was none. Surrounded by drug addiction, gangs and impoverishment, they have developed a completely unique style of dance that evolves on a daily basis. Through tremendous spirit and creativity, they manage to rise above.
