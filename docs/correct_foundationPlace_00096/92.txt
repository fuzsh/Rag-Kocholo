The MINDSCAPE group within the Francis I. Proctor Foundation at the University of California, San Francisco is seeking a postdoctoral fellow or research scientist to support our partnership with the Centers of Disease Control’s Modeling Infectious Diseases (MInD) in Healthcare Network. Our broad goals are to leverage statistical and computational modeling to minimize disease transmission and emergence of antimicrobial resistance in healthcare facilities and other workplaces. We are particularly interested in MRSA, Clostridioides difficile, and SARS-CoV-2 infections.

Current areas of interest include:

• Optimizing the clinical and public health utility of computational tools for determining the risk of acquiring healthcare associated infections, antimicrobial resistance, or severe infection.

• Incorporating patient movement and pathogen exposure data to improve ability to elucidate individual transmission links and quickly identify clusters of infection.

• Developing and validating transmission models for MRSA and C. difficile to evaluate the effectiveness of interventions designed to reduce nosocomial colonization and disease transmission.

• Elucidating the relationship between antimicrobial stewardship efforts and the emergence of antimicrobial resistance.

• Probing the relationship between community and healthcare transmission of antimicrobial resistant infections.

• Using electronic health record data to predict clinical trajectory of COVID-19 cases, risk of disease complications, and benefit of treatment.

• Quantifying the relative contributions of factors driving inequity of COVID-19 outcomes such as infectious exposure, comorbid conditions, hospital care, and post-hospital care.

• Evaluating strategies for COVID-19 surveillance and mitigation of outbreaks in healthcare facilities, congregate facilities, and workplaces.

A rich network of collaborations amongst multiple academic institutions (e.g. NYU, U of Michigan, UTSW Medical Centers), public health agencies (e.g. SFDPH, CDPH, and CDC), and other research groups at UCSF provide access to a broad range of expertise and data. Participation in bi-weekly conference calls with the MInD network will provide a national venue for dissemination of research findings and development of new partnerships. Primary sources of data include electronic health records at multiple institutions, and line listing data of COVID-19 cases from the California Department of Public Health.

UCSF is committed to hiring and retaining researchers that reflect the diversity of California's population, particularly those who have been systematically and historically underrepresented. Applicants should have a record of achievement in infectious disease modeling, clinical informatics, or relevant quantitative fields. Strong communication skills and programming experience (in R, Python, etc.) are also necessary. Those who are passionate about the clinical and public health impact of infectious disease modeling will be particularly well suited.

The position will be based at UCSF’s Mission Bay Campus in San Francisco. Office space will be provided, but a mix of on-site and remote work is welcome. Perks of living in the Bay Area include a unique mix of vibrant city life and easy access to a wealth of outdoor adventures. We will review applications on a rolling basis starting April 4, 2022. We are eager to expand our team, but the start date is negotiable. Interested applicants should submit application materials to Prof. Seth Blumberg (Seth.Blumberg@ucsf.edu). Any questions regarding this position can be also be addressed to Dr. Blumberg. Further details about applying can be found below.

Please include the following in your application:

CV

Brief cover letter (or description of interest)

Detail your level of experience with coding and which programming languages you use (e.g., R, Python, SAS, etc.)

Three academic and/or professional references (with their email addresses)

-If applicable- List the type of visa you are able to obtain and the estimated time to process it

Thank you, and we look forward to hearing from you!
