        "text": "Let’s talk about Utopia. It’s that evergreen concept that’s inspired new urban projects for centuries and all too often creates new fiascos as a result. Love this new “Chasing Utopia” piece from @Noema on how “a group of Silicon Valley’s most powerful figures are building startup societies that they believe will set them free.” https://lnkd.in/gKRPv8cn From the Peter Thiel-backed community called Próspera off the coast of Honduras, to Elon’s hopes of colonizing Mars, to the “California Forever” city some of the SF Bay Area’s wealthiest residents are trying to build, the allure of escaping the problems of modern life and starting anew are getting funded by tech titans at whole new scales and pace. But let’s get real - dealing with today’s challenges and increasingly dystopian dynamics does not mean that more utopian visions are the answer. Modernism’s ideas for utopian cities turned out to be nightmares for those who had to live in them. Rajneeshpuram, the utopian city built in rural Oregon in the 1980s that was the focus of the 2018 documentary series Wild Wild Country, became a hot bed for attempted murder, poison, and deceit. What about aiming for a middle ground, instead? What about pushing against the hegemony of dystopian narratives that shape so many of our conceptions about how to deal with how tough the world can be today, without creating false hope in utopian alternatives? I get into examples of what this middle ground can look like in my 2022 book Speculative Futures: https://lnkd.in/gwyJGbDh One example I love is writer Ursula K. Le Guin’s 1974 novel, The Dispossessed: An Ambiguous Utopia, which explores a world in which people put the needs of society ahead of their own. As its subtitle suggests, however, this society is not perfect. Instead, Le Guin offe s something much more valuable. By working with the realities of human greed, jealousy, and fear, her fiction becomes a testing ground for exploring the limits of more communal societies and understanding how individual pursuits can support collective well-being. Investigating potential repercussions is just as important as highlighting hypothetical benefits Finding balance between the two is not a simple task. But it’s definitely possible. What if these tech titans took their billions of dollars and invested in working with the problems we have now rather than creating the new ones that always come when the allure of building “from scratch” begins to call? #imaginaries #SpeculativeFiction #Futures #Foresight #urbanplanning #urbanlandscape #cityplanning #SpeculativeDesign #Artificialhumanities #sciencefiction #urbanfutures #utopia #speculativefutures #pluralfutures\n\nSci-fi became reality the other day in Alameda, CA. Scientists tested a cloud-brightening machine designed to reflect sunlight and keep global temperatures cooler. https://lnkd.in/gnpk_WJK Sci-fi has been exploring versions of these kinds of ideas for decades. A lot are more intense than brightening clouds in marine areas. James Oberg’s 1981 New Earths investigates how sunshades in space could be configured to cool the earth down. Lois McMaster Bujold’s book Komarr from the 1990s gets into similar territory. Bill McGuire published Skyseed in 2020 to dive into what might happen if we adopt a nanotech-based approach to managing solar temperatures. What I really appreciate about his take is how hard it is to comprehend the consequences of what can happen when we place our faith, funds, and climate futures in these kinds of technological interventions. The test in Alameda was small, focused on a device that sprays tiny salt particles into the air. But versions of the tool could one day be used to inject clouds overhead to reflect sun back into space. It’s one of many geoengineering projects people are developing to engineer ourselves out of climate crisis. Arid areas in the US + Mexico are investing in cloud seeding to create rain in drought-prone zones. Iceland has tools that turn CO2 into stone. I’m all for addressing the climate crisis from multiple angles, but can’t help wondering what the unintended consequences of these kinds of interventions might be. Whether in the forms of science fiction, interactive art installations, or more, narrative spaces offer us high resolution realities in which to understand what repercussions might look, feel, and sound like across scales of impact. They’re ways for us to engage in collective imagination about where we’d like to go and how we might there. But shaping collective imagination isn’t a simple, straightforward thing. The narratives we make and share about AI are visions that integrate tech innovations with existing norms about what’s conceivable and preferable. Tracking how those norms evolve and influence our thoughts and ideas about what could be is a way of tracking the power dynamics, capital flows, and geopolitical plays that shape how certain visions gain traction over others. There’s a whole big field dedicated to doing just this kind of tracking. Love this 2015 book from 2015 edited by the titan Sheila Jasanoff on how collective imagination about where science and tech can take us in the futures shapes our presents and remakes our pasts — check it out if you feel like doing a deeper dive! https://lnkd.in/g3jKTdhb #imaginaries #AI #SpeculativeFiction #Futures #Foresight #urbanplanning #urbanlandscape #cityplanning #SpeculativeDesign #Artificialhumanities #sciencefiction #speculativefutures #pluralfutures\n\nLooking forward to this ✨ I'll be joining the wonderful Colin butfield, Anab Jain RDI Tim Kelly, David Armstrong McKay and Félix Pharand-Deschênes for a webinar on Communicating Tipping Points 20 March, 12:30-14:00 CET Tipping points are moments that shift our systems into new phases and ways of functioning. In this time of climate crisis, many of them pose serious threats. When triggered, tipping points can damage earth’s life-support systems and the long-term stability of our societies as a result. Despite their importance, tipping points remain hard to understand. For most of us, they’re more abstract concepts than processes that directly impact our future lives. Given how hard they are to grasp, they’re persistently difficult to address. I’ll be diving into ways of using speculative futures to conceptualize and communicate about them with a glorious line up of thinkers, doers, makers and researchers. If you’re intrigued, come join! https://lnkd.in/gm9QY-gA Register:bit.ly/3IphFwG #tippingpoints #climatechange #urbanism #speculativefutures\n\nApple recently patented the use of AirPods to detect brain biosignals. It's mind reading tech, a #designfiction and #sciencefictioprototyping project come to patented life. https://lnkd.in/gSPQPwD5 What if we lived in a world where wider groups of people, outside of the conglomerations who make these technical innovations, decided how, and if, we want to use them? What does that world look like? What happens when my thoughts are truly no longer my own? How might the implications be different, if at all, for an elected body, like a government, to employ this kind of tool instead of a for-profit corporation? Whether, how and when Apple implements this patent are all speculative questions but the possible impacts are more than worth exploring because Apple is not alone. Other profit-based companies, like Musk's Neurolink, are developing associated kinds of tools as well, making alternative futures feel like they're speeding towards us faster than ever. #futures #applestore #designthinking #urbanfutures\n\nRefik Anadol has a new installation at Serpentine gallery and it’s giving me big thoughts and feels. Featuring “dynamic interpretations of natural landscapes, including underwater scenes and rainforests, through the most advanced AI technology,” it’s a stunning next step in the long history technology has played in mediating how we view our place in the world. https://lnkd.in/g-_jctQX The ways we see nature shape the ways we see ourselves and the cities we call home. Those ways of seeing influence how we imagine the kinds of futures we want to create in kind. How does exploring natural systems through the lens of generative AI change the our perceptions of and relationships with the wider world? What does it do to our abilities to connect and collaborate with non-humans? Oh so curious, frightened, and thrilled to see how it all evolves. If you’ve got thoughts would love to hear! #AIart #urbanfutures #nature\n\nMoving into the end of the calendar year and thinking about Dubai, where I landed to speak at DUBAI FUTURE FOUNDATION a few days before this year’s COP meeting took place. The meeting just ended last week with an agreement that felt like a sci-fi plot twist — the host country, a place still heavily invested in fossil fuels, negotiated an agreement that signals “the beginning of the end” of fossil fuel use. Made me think about how much of Dubai feels like a science fiction come to life. Architect Adrian Smith has said his ideas for Dubai’s Burj Khalifa, currently the tallest structure in the world, came from seeing the Wizard of Oz and its Emerald City as a kid. It’s a place where islands are constructed in the shape of palm trees, where buildings have multiple stories underground so that people can escape the 130 Fahrenheit summer heat. Dubai is just one example of how sci-fi visions already influence the ways cities are made. The biometric scanning and three-dimensional mobility depicted in Minority Report are rapidly becoming urban reality across the globe. Blade Runner has inspired urban design in cities from East Asia to the Persian Gulf. Because most sci-fi visions of the future lean dystopian, much of that influence has been dark. But the agreement made in Dubai last week feels like it fits less easily in the dystopian / utopian binary divide. It’s not a perfect agreement by any means. But it’s so much better than I and so many others thought it would be. It’s an incremental step towards up-topia, towards utopia as a process that we can keep revising, refining, and implementing, step by step, over time. Thanks to all who made the conference and understanding a little more about Dubai and the United Arab Emirates such a pleasure Melissa Ingaruca Moreno Adib Dada Josef Hargrave Lourdes Rodríguez Rodríguez @chrisluebkeman and so many more #cities #climatecrisis #SpeculativeFiction #Futures #Foresight #urbanplanning #urbanlandscape #cityplanning #solarpunk #futurecity #SpeculativeDesign #futurecities #archdaily #designboom #sciencefiction #urbanism #urbanlandscapes #speculativefutures #pluralfutures #foresight #strategicforesight"
