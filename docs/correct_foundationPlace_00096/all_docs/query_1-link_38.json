        "text": "Broderbund Software (BROD), the publisher of games like Myst and Riven, will be acquired by The Learning Company for US$420 million in stock.\n\nBroderbund, one of the oldest and most storied educational and entertainment software makers, had struggled recently. Even a stable of best-selling titles like Carmen Sandiego failed to make enough money for the company to stay on its own. The Novato, California, company also did not have as much distribution clout as market leaders Microsoft and Electronic Arts.\n\n\"Market consolidation has gotten more intense in the past year or so, and we've experienced serious margin pressure and serious pricing pressure,\" said Lauren Tanny, Broderbund's vice president of marketing. \"We needed more clout with distributors.\"\n\nThe Learning Company, which specializes in educational software such as Reader Rabbit, will issue 0.80 shares of its common shares for each share of Broderbund common stock. Based on Friday's closing stock price, the Learning Company would be paying $20 a share, a 21 percent premium over Broderbund's Friday closing price.\n\nThe Learning Company, based in Cambridge, Massachusetts, expects the Broderbund merger to close by the end of September and to increase fiscal 1999 earnings by 10 cents per share.\n\nBroderbund shares jumped $2.25, or 13 percent, to close at $18.75 on Nasdaq. Learning Company (TLC) fell 11 cents to $24.89 on the New York Stock Exchange.\n\nMany Wall Street analysts had expected Broderbund to sell out. The company had reported string of disappointing financial results in the past two years. It also had to fire about 70 employees in March to control costs.\n\nIt was the third acquisition for the Learning Company in the past four months. Earlier this month, the firm bought PF Magic, the maker of the \"virtual pet\" software. In March, it acquired education software maker Mindscape.\n\nBroderbund enjoyed nearly two decades of success before succumbing to difficult market conditions. Brothers Gary and Doug Carlston founded the company in 1980 to market Doug's computer games. The firm flourished in the '80s as a maker of entertaiment and educational software, scoring hits such as the Print Shop and Carmen Sandiego. Success continued into the '90s with blockbuster titles like Myst and its sequel, Riven.\n\nIn prosperous times, Broderbund did the acquiring. It bought PC globe, an electronic atlas publisher, in 1992. It even put in a bid to acquire the Learning Company in 1995, but the deal fell apart when a company called Softkey International outbid it. After the acquisition was completed, Softkey changed its name to the Learning Company.\n\nBroderbund officials said they do not expect to lay off people except in areas where functions overlap. Broderbund will continue to operate as a separate unit."
