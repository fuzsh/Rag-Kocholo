        "text": "Preface Cultural ecology is one of the two major subdivisions of human ecology, the other being human biological ecology.We felt that the books available for a class in cultural ecology focused either too heavily on general ecology, or too much on human biological ecology, or not enough on cultural ecology. Thus, we faced a “Goldilocks” dilemma: none of the usual text books were “just right” for our introductory classes. So we decided to create a new book. We begin with the assumption that the student has no prior knowledge of anthropology or ecology and try to build an understanding from the ground up. All peoples and cultures are faced with a number of major environmental issues, problems that can be addressed by anthropology and cultural ecology.How have other people faced and dealt with the same basic problems that face us all today? How can we improve our situation? What can anthropology and cultural ecology contribute to the future? The key is understanding what the options are, what works, and what does not. This requires a great deal of knowledge that must be obtained through the study of other groups, including the documentation of their environments and adaptations. Next, we must analyze what we have learned to develop alternative responses to environmental situations. We must also understand the consequences of the choices that have been made; we can learn from the successes and mistakes of others rather than having to repeat those same mistakes. We do not attempt to cover all aspects of the incredibly complex and diverse field of the relationships between humans and the environment. We thought it important to provide a reasonably comprehensive introduction to ecological theory in a simple format, combined with discussions of various human cultures. We spend more time defining the concepts and classifying things typologically\n\nThe New Ecological Anthropology Older ecologies have been remiss in the narrowness of their spatial and temporal horizons, their functionalist assumptions, and their apolitical character. Suspending functionalist assumptions and an emphasis upon (homeo)stasis, \"the new ecological anthropology\" is located at the intersection of global, national, regional, and local systems, studying the outcome of the interaction of multiple levels and multiple factors. It blends theoretical and empirical research with applied, policy-directed, and critical work in what Rappaport called an \"engaged\" anthropology; and it is otherwise attuned to the political aspects and implications of ecological processes. Carefully laying out a critique of previous ecologies by way of announcing newer approaches, the article insists on the need to recognize the importance of culture mediations in ecological processes rather than treating culture as epiphenomenal and as a mere adaptive tool. It closes with a discussion of the methodologies appropriate to the new ecological anthropology. / \"the new ecology, \" political ecology, applied or engaged anthropology, linkages methodology]\n\nThis essay deals with cultural ecology, defined as ‘the study of the ways in which people adapt to their environment by means of behavior, as well as their knowledge of specific natural environments and processes’ (Sutton and Anderson 2004). Cultural ecology deals with numerous aspects of culture and the environment, including how people manage to solve their subsistence problems, how they understand their environment, and how they share with others their knowledge of the natural settings, resources, and landscapes. Cultural ecology seeks an explanation of human adaptation and cultural evolution in both contemporary and ancient societies throughout the world (French and Gonlin 2016). -- On the cover: figure of a deer painted on a pot in the Tarascan community of Huáncito, Michoacán, Mexico. Many of the designs on Tarascan pots show elements of the natural environment, both flora and fauna."
