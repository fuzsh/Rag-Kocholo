Check out our Research tab to learn more about the types of projects available. Please reach out to seth.blumberg@ucsf.edu with questions or to express interest.\n\nPostdoctoral Fellow / Research Scientist / Analyst\n\nThe MINDSCAPE group within the Francis I. Proctor Foundation at the University of California, San Francisco is seeking a postdoctoral fellow, research scientist or analyst to support our partnership with the Centers of Disease Control’s Modeling Infectious Diseases (MInD) in Healthcare Network. Please refer to the Research tab to learn more about our research goals and areas of interest.\n\nA rich network of collaborations amongst multiple academic institutions (e.g. NYU, U of Michigan, UTSW Medical Centers), public health agencies (e.g. SFDPH, CDPH, and CDC), and other research groups at UCSF provide access to a broad range of expertise and data. Participation in bi-weekly conference calls with the MInD network will provide a national venue for dissemination of research findings and development of new partnerships. Primary sources of data include electronic health records at multiple institutions, and line listing data of COVID-19 cases from the California Department of Public Health.\n\nUCSF is committed to hiring and retaining researchers that reflect the diversity of California’s population, particularly those who have been systematically and historically underrepresented. Applicants should have a record of achievement in infectious disease modeling, clinical informatics, or relevant quantitative fields. Strong communication skills and programming experience (in R, Python, etc.) are also necessary. Those who are passionate about the clinical and public health impact of infectious disease modeling will be particularly well suited."
