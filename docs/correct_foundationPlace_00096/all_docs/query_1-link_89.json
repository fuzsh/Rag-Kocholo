        "text": "Virtual pets are the pet rocks of the '90s.\n\nMore responsive than rocks, virtual pets don't require the same level of commitment as the real thing. Although they still must be fed, played with and even cleaned up after, it takes only a single keystroke.\n\nCapitalizing on the success of Tamagotchi _ the wildly popular $15 electronic pet-on-a-chain from Japan _ softwaremakers are scrambling to breed more sophisticated and more expensive pets for the personal computer.\n\nLike the Tamagotchi, the computer pets must be cared for or they'll develop mean or nasty traits and in some cases even die. But softwaremakers say PC pets, which were originally designed as an experiment in artificial intelligence, are far more advanced.\n\n\"Comparing (our product) to Tamagotchi is like comparing a Lear Jet to the Flintstones,\" said Joe Morici, vice president of sales and marketing for Fujitsu Interactive in San Francisco.\n\nFujitsu Interactive launched a product called Fin Fin on Teo, the Magic Planet _ a $60 program that installs an interactive dolphinlike character on your computer.\n\nIt comes with a microphone/sensor that sits on top of your computer. You can talk to Fin Fin through the microphone and it can tell if you're at your desk.\n\nFin Fin coos and squeaks if it wants attention and may run away if you yell at it. It doesn't die, but it does get sick if it's not treated well.\n\n\"The purpose is to build a friendship,\" Morici said. \"It teaches children that if they yell and scream at the character he will get scared and run away and if they treat him nicely, he'll give them positive feedback.\"\n\nHowever, Fin Fin is fairly high maintenance.\n\nOne Fin Fin user said he had to shut down the program because the bird was driving his co-workers crazy.\n\n\"It didn't do anything interesting and then it would coo for attention,\" he said.\n\nAt the Electronic Entertainment Expo in Atlanta recently, Bandai, the Japanese maker of Tamagotchi, was previewing a new computer pet it will launch in September for $39.95.\n\nNovato-based Mindscape is giving birth next month to an equally needy set of creatures.\n\nThe $40 game Creatures lets you genetically engineer a world populated by gremlinlike animals called Norns.\n\nYou start by hatching a clutch of Norn eggs, and then raise, educate and eventually mate the creatures.\n\nBudding geneticists can breed them for looks or personality traits and eventually create a whole fantasy Norn world. Norn owners can also swap animals over the Internet.\n\nNorns eventually die and are buried in the Norn graveyard _ a concept that horrifies the people at PF Magic, a San Francisco company that created the first PC pet, called Dogz.\n\nFor $20, users can create a dog that lives on their computer screen, likes to be petted and can learn to do tricks. But the dog never goes to heaven.\n\n\"We have taken the road that Dogz are all the fun (of a real pet) with none of the horrible stuff,\" said Brooke Boynton, PF's marketing manager.\n\n\"There are no litter boxes to clean and they don't die.\"\n\nPF Magic has sold more than 1-million copies of its virtual pet software, which includes Catz and Oddballz.\n\nA month ago, the company put up a page on its Web site (dogz.com) called Should Virtual Pets Die? The site has gotten about 4,000 responses.\n\n\"My gut feeling on this issue is \"No,' \" wrote Mike Reddin. \"This product will have a high appeal for young children who may not understand the concept of \"death' and quite frankly I'd rather not deal with it. I enjoy using the program, I use it daily and treat it as if it was a real pet. There is no point in having it die, if I want death I'll play Quake for a few hours.\"\n\nOn the other side of the debate is \"Trixie,\" who wrote: \"I am a 14-year old Australian girl, and as much as I love my catz, Tiddles, I think, like all pets in reality, he should not bear the burden of eternal life.\""
