They also lead to the risk of high-tech\n\nglitches, as one technology company recently learned.\n\nOur sister newsletter, Interactive PR, reported that multimedia\n\ndeveloper Mindscape was horrified to find out a couple of days after\n\nlast month's E3 show (Electronic Entertainment Expo) that the CD-ROM\n\npress kit distributed at the Los Angeles show contained a virus.\n\nThe Novato, Calif.-based company quickly e-mailed instructions to\n\nthe approximately 700 reporters who attended the show, warning them of\n\nthe virus and telling them how to obtain a software \"patch.\" \"We\n\nwanted to be proactive,\" said Adrienne Henkin, public relations\n\nmanager told PR NEWS."
