        "text": "Situated in the heart of Hyderabad, this space for exhibitions and cultural events attracts the most revolutionary ideas and the most creative people within its beautifully contructed wooden structure. She says, “It retains an atmosphere of learning, contemplation and discovery that’s reflected in the choice of artists we work with, who are invited to make something new or to present an existing body of work that is close to their heart and has relevance in the contemporary art scene. Our mission is to make the thinking and making processes of artists more visible to a wider public.” Having done her civil and environment engineering from Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University, she returned to Hyderabad after 14 years of living in the United States. The course defined her career. She restructured her family-owned land in Secunderabad and built the eco-friendly platform in January 2013. “This place is meant to make artists and curators express themselves fully. From event to event, the project space will be repeatedly transformed into an arena wherein the participants can take the measure of each other to find the connections that fill the gaps in our cultural landscape with the aim of fostering fresh exchanges and above all the broadening of ideas,” says Nayantara, who began her project of creating an open space only in August 2012.\n\nAccording to the trained Odissi dancer, Our Sacred Space accommodates almost all forms of art—from dance to music to painting to theatre. She says, “We are into serious business. We are here to perform and learn. I love seeing people engrossed in what they are doing.” Nayantara believes that the best way to preserve knowledge is to spread it. During the week, the place is abuzz with training sessions in Odissi, Carnatic music, Ikebana, visual arts, meditation and yoga. When the space opened, it had been somewhat difficult to attract the big names in art for putting their works on display. But things have changed. Artists are now more than eager to get the space, and stalwarts in the field are reaching out to the new venue. “When I started, I wasn’t sure if this dream could turn into reality,” she adds. The space boasts of back-to-back exhibitions. “Besides art exhibitions, we offer concerts, workshops, lectures and interactions with artists,” she adds."
