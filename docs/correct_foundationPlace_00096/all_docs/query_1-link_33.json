        "text": "First Person: October 11, 1995\n\nBEING THERE\n\nA friend's tragedy teaches some lessons you can't learn in school\n\nBY JAMES M. KENNEDY '81\n\nNot long ago, I was speaking on a panel of attorneys, and during the question-and-answer period someone asked, \"What's the most important thing you've done in your life? What's the thing you're most proud of?\"\n\nAlthough it's not something I had thought of before, my answer came to me in an instant. It's not the answer I gave, because the setting wasn't right. As a lawyer who's spent his career in the entertainment industry, I knew the audience wanted to hear some amusing anecdote about my involvement with the Live Aid Concert or working at Lucasfilm. But here is the true answer, the one that leaped from the recesses of memory.\n\nThe most important thing I have ever done occurred on October 8, 1990. I remember the date because it was my mom's 65th birthday, and for that reason I was back home, in Haverhill, Massachusetts, for a celebration my family had planned. I began the day playing tennis with one of my high-school buddies, a good friend whom I had not seen for a while. Between points in the usual thrashing I was taking, we caught up on what had been happening in each other's lives. He and his wife had just had a baby boy, who was keeping them up late at night. My friend's lack of sleep, however, wasn't showing in his serve or cross-court backhand.\n\nWhile we were playing, a car came screaming up the road toward the courts, its horn blaring. It was my friend's father. As the car screeched to a halt, he shouted to my buddy that his baby had stopped breathing and was being rushed to the hospital. In a flash my friend was in the car and gone, disappearing in a cloud of dust and gravel.\n\nFor a moment I just stood there paralyzed, trying to comprehend what had happened. Then I tried to figure out what I should do next. Follow my friend to the hospital? There was nothing I could accomplish there, I convinced myself. My friend's son was in the care of doctors and nurses, and nothing I could do or say would affect the outcome. Be there for moral support? Well, maybe. But my friend and his wife both had large families, and I knew they would be surrounded by parents, siblings, and relatives who would provide more than enough comfort and support, whatever happened. All I could do at the hospital, I decided, was get in the way. Plus, I had a full day planned with members of my family, who were waiting for me to get home. So I decided to head back to my folk's house and check in with my friend later.\n\nAs I started my rental car, I realized that my friend had left his truck and his keys behind at the courts. I now faced another dilemma. I couldn't leave the keys in the truck. But, if I locked up the truck and took the keys, what would I do with them? I could leave them at his house, but with no paper on me to leave a note, how would he know I had done that? Reluctantly, I decided that the best course of action was for me to swing by the hospital and give him the keys.\n\nWhen I got to the hospital, I was directed to a small room where my friend and his wife were waiting for word from the doctors. As I had thought, the room was filled with family members silently watching my friend console his wife at the far end of the room. I slipped in quietly and stood by the door, trying to decide what to do next.\n\nI had been in the room for less than a minute when a doctor appeared. He approached my friend and his wife, and in a quiet voice told them that their son had died, the victim of Sudden Infant Death Syndrome.\n\nFor what seemed an eternity, my friend and his wife held each other and cried, oblivious to the rest of us standing around in pained, stunned silence. Then, after they composed themselves, the doctor suggested that they might want to spend a few moments with their son. My friend and his wife stood up and walked stoically past their family as they headed out of the room. When they reached the door, my friend's wife saw me standing in the corner. She came over and hugged me and started to cry. And then my friend hugged me, too. And said, \"Thanks for being here.\"\n\nFor the rest of that morning I sat in the emergency room of that hospital and watched my friend and his wife hold the body of their infant son, and say goodbye.\n\nIt's the most important thing I have ever done."
