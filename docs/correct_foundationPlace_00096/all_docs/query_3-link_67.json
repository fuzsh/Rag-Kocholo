        "text": "Commonwealth Shakespeare Company has taken Shakespeare’s most iconic play to meet the cutting edge of immersive storytelling in Hamlet 360: Thy Father’s Spirit, embracing the immersive power of VR to plunge the viewer into Hamlet’s harrowing journey. It is a 60 minute, cinematic, 360-degree adaptation that explores new dimensions of the medium by casting the viewer as the Ghost of Hamlet’s dead father, giving the viewer a sense of agency and urgency as an omniscient observer, guide and participant.\n\nHamlet 360: Thy Father’s Spirit brings Shakespeare’s most iconic play to vivid life, harnessing the power of the VR medium to bring viewers inside this masterpiece. The experience is set in a dilapidated, once-glorious hall—the room where the fateful duel took place leaving such waste and carnage. Paint peels off the walls, water drips from the ceiling, ruined furniture gathers dust. Shards of Hamlet’s memories—the faded detritus of his life—are spread throughout the room. On one end, a stage; in one area, a large claw foot tub; and in another, a mound of earth with a few tombstones and a fresh rough-hewn grave. The design embraces the interiority of the play and immerses the characters (and the viewer) in Hamlet’s chaotic, turbulent mindscape. This dream world is both hyper-real and tangible as well as surreal and expressionistic. It’s a rich and detailed environment that invites continual exploration and discovery. A brilliant cast of actors, as comfortable on stage as they are on screen, deliver powerful performances that bring the play forward to today, making it both current and timeless.\n\nAdapted & Directed by Steven Maler\n\nProduced by Graham Sack & Quentin Little\n\nProduction & Cinematography by Sensorium\n\nCostume & Production Design by Clint Ramos\n\nMusic & Sound Design by Bruce Odland\n\nFight Choreography by Scott Barrow\n\nTechnical Direction by Matthew Niederhauser & John Fitzgerald\n\nPost Production Sound by SilVR\n\nVisual Effects by The Molecule\n\nHOW TO VIEW:\n\nThe experience is being released in partnership with Boston public media producer WGBH and can be viewed exclusively on the WGBH YouTube channel. The 360 video is best viewed using a VR headset, such as the Google Pixel phone with Google Cardboard or Daydream View.

Working at the intersection of art, commerce, and new media, their interdisciplinary process is grounded in technological innovation and the ability to integrate concepts across a wide spectrum of mediums. Their original content and interactive design push the boundaries of virtual reality, augmented reality, and immersive installations. VR projects produced by Sensorium premiered in the past two Sundance Film Festivals in the New Frontier program including The Sky Is a Gap and Zikr: A Sufi Revival. Their most recent AR theater installation, objects in mirror AR closer than they appear, also premiered at Tribeca Storyscapes this year. Otherwise, cofounders John Fitzgerald and Matthew Niederhauser also collaborate on projects and exhibits with the MIT Center for Advanced Urbanism, Cyborg Foundation, and Pulitzer Center for Crisis Reporting. www.sensorium.works\n\nCHRONOTOPE is the new media production company of writer and director Graham Sack. The studio’s mission is to develop narrative fiction that combines emerging technologies with visceral emotion. Graham wrote and directed Lincoln in the Bardo, a VR experience for New York Times VR that was shortlisted for an Emmy for Innovation in Interactive Programming and was based on the bestselling novel by acclaimed author George Saunders. Graham wrote and directed The Interpretation of Dreams, a four-part episodic series for Samsung’s VR Pilot Season that explores immersive dreamscapes based on Freud’s case studies of the unconscious. Graham co-created “objects in mirror AR closer than they appear,” an immersive theater + augmented reality installation at Tribeca Storyscapes 2018 that transferred to Next Door at New York Theater Workshop. He produced “Hamlet 360: Thy Father’s Spirit” with Google, Commonwealth Shakespeare Company, and WGBH. He is currently developing an original VR episodic series with Felix and Paul Studios. Graham previously wrote and directed Don’t Look Away an interactive cinematic VR experience about aging, time, and the scarcity of attention and subject:object, a VR experience for New York Theatre Workshop about the private life of objects. He also served as creative director on Power in Hand, a VR documentary about solar power for the Rockefeller Foundation and Matter Unlimited. www.chronotopefilms.com\n\nAdditional support is provided by Christy Cashman, Morwin Schmookler, Kerry Healey, Bonnie McElveen-Hunter, and Babson College."
