        "text": "Meet Mindscape: Mindscape is committed to harnessing AI in a beneficial manner, serving as a conduit to professional support from mental health charities and therapists. Through the integration of AI, we intend to eliminate barriers such as social stigma, embarrassment, and accessibility issues. Users can promptly access therapeutic assistance and mindfulness support. When they feel ready or require professional guidance, Mindscape will facilitate connections with the appropriate individuals or charities. The ongoing AI revolution is unfolding right before our eyes, and for many, it may evoke feelings of unease or fear. We acknowledge these sentiments, yet it's important to recognise that AI and technology have the potential for positive impact. Mindscape aims to complement rather than replace in-person therapy, serving as a facilitator in four essential areas: early intervention, acting as a gateway to professional therapy, providing support during therapy, and offering post-therapy assistance. If you would like to join our mission to improve access to mental health care, you can register and join our growing professional community here: https://usemindscape.com/\n\nMindscape Professionals is Here üéâ We are so excited to announce the launch of the Mindscape Professionals App, now available to download on the App Store. At Mindscape, we understand the challenges therapists face in addressing the growing mental health crisis. That's why we've built Ava, our AI therapeutic assistant, integrated into the Mindscape Professionals app. Ava is a revolutionary tool that blends advanced technology with empathetic effective mental health care. Before Ava‚Äôs public launch, we are releasing our AI therapeutic assistant on a professional app dedicated to therapists and counsellors. As the first version of Ava is introduced, we acknowledge that this is just the beginning of an evolving journey. Ava is designed to learn and improve over time, and we are committed to making iterative enhancements based on your invaluable feedback. By engaging with Ava, you will play a crucial role in shaping her development, ensuring that she becomes a more effective tool for professionals and clients in the future. We can‚Äôt wait to share more updates with you as we continue to improve Ava based on your feedback and prepare for the eventual release of the general user version.

We are thrilled to announce that our AI therapeutic assistant, Ava, will be officially available on the App Store in 24 hours! As the first version, we‚Äôre releasing Ava exclusively on our ‚ÄòMindscape Professionals‚Äô app, so you will be among the first users to test and provide feedback on our innovative AI therapeutic assistant. This initial rollout will allow professionals to interact with Ava, helping us refine her capabilities before we release a version for general users. Introducing Ava üëã Ava is an AI-powered assistant designed to enhance the therapeutic process by utilising active listening techniques, a foundational approach in therapy. Ava's role is to simulate human-like interactions, responding thoughtfully and empathetically to users. Ava aims to create a nurturing and empathetic environment, ensuring users feel heard and valued throughout their experience. How We've Built Ava üå± Creating Ava has been an exciting journey, blending advanced AI technology with the nuanced art of therapy. Here's how we've done it: Foundation of Large Language Models: Ava is built on a robust base of large language models. These models are the backbone of Ava's ability to understand and generate human-like text. Customised Data and Training: We've wrapped the base model with our proprietary data and training to ensure Ava responds like a therapist. This includes: Scenario-Based Training: Ava has been exposed to various scenarios to practice appropriate and therapeutic responses. Expert Feedback: Input from experienced therapists has shaped Ava's responses and behaviour. The First Version: A Collaborative Effort üôå As the first version of Ava is introduced, we acknowledge that this is just the beginning of an evolving journey. Ava is designed to learn and improve over time, and we are committed to making iterative enhancements based on your invaluable feedback. By engaging with Ava, you will play a crucial role in shaping her development, ensuring that she becomes a more effective tool for professionals and clients in the future. Get Ready for Launch! ‚ö°Ô∏è The Mindscape Professionals app will be ready to download from tomorrow, so take advantage of this opportunity to elevate your practice with the power of AI. We will share more updates and tips on making the most of Ava in the coming days. For any questions or support, feel free to reach out to our team.üçÉ We are so excited to begin the next chapter of Mindscape and are delighted to have you with us! #MentalHealthSupport #AIinTherapy #Therapists #AIHealthcare #MentalHealthInnovation #DigitalTherapy #AIForGood #MentalWellbeing #FutureOfTherapy #AIInHealthcare #MentalHealthTech #TherapyTools #MindscapeAI #MentalHealthProfessionals #AccessibleCare\n\nMental health triage is a critical process that assesses and classifies the urgency and priority of mental health-related issues. As we develop our AI therapeutic assistant, our goal is to provide support while identifying risk factors and helping users find and access appropriate care. We plan to use the Core-10 structure as an initial screening and assessment tool, but we also welcome community input on other frameworks. As we build the professional app and continue to engage with the mental health community, we will explore questions around integrating technology with in-person support. For example, where should the AI support end and human intervention begin? Should users with high clinical scores have access to AI, or is it inappropriate to limit their access? We value your input, so please feel free to share your thoughts."
