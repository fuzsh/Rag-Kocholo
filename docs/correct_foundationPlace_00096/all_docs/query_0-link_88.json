        "text": "Fun is a key ingredient that gives enormous power to digital games. Recently, there has been renewed interest to harness this power of games for instructional purposes. However, merging fun and educational content may not necessarily mean a better learning outcome. Analysis of Flow theory for fun and Kolb’s learning model suggest fun may subvert, instead of helping, the learning objectives within a game. This paper describes research and a study with tertiary-level students to firstly, identify attributes of educational games that make them fun and secondly, to investigate the effectiveness of fun for better learning in educational games. Fun was measured using a modified version of George Kelly’s Repertory Grid Technique (RGT). Findings suggest that learning not only can occur via educational games, but also that fun and learning are positively related, implying that educational games, if well designed, may be valid learning tools. In addition, it was found that while the RGT is bo...\n\nThis mixed-methods-collective-case-study focused on the use of an online videogame combined with second language acquisition (SLA) strategic gameplay to improve English language learners’ (ELLs) grammar, listening, reading, and vocabulary. Its purpose was to determine whether a noneducational, massively, multiplayer, online, role-playing game (MMORPG) had educational merit as an extracurricular activity for ELLs when combined with the following gaming activities to promote SLA: voice and text-based chats, forming alliances, and creating a virtual social identity. The design included 15 participants who received 25 hours of weekly English language instruction in reading, writing, grammar, and oral skills for an eight-week term at school. For the treatment group, EverQuest® II (2016) was prescribed with the SLA optimizing strategic gameplay for four hours a week for a month after school. The control group did not receive the treatment. The Cambridge Michigan Language Assessment (CaMLA) pretest-posttest composite mean gain scores were used to assess the participants’ grammar, listening, reading, and vocabulary performance. At end of term, the control group outperformed the treatment group on the CaMLA by 1.7 mean gain score units. To determine vocabulary acquisition from gameplay, I developed a vocabulary pretest-posttest based on frequently occurring words from the treatment group participants’ game chat logs. The treatment group learned, on average, 15 new words representing a 30% increase on the gameplay vocabulary test. No correlations were found between prior gaming experience and attitude toward gaming for SLA or between prior gaming experience and ESL skill performance on the CaMLA. Due to the small sample size and nonrandom assignment, this study lacked the rigor and statistical power to make valid and reliable quantitative claims of the findings. Therefore, a collective case study and mixed methods were used to corroborate and augment findings. Four impact profiles of extreme cases are provided. Emergent themes on gaming and language learning gleaned from participants were as follows: most participants had a positive attitude toward videogame play for SLA, most treatment group participants disliked the prescribed SLA strategic gameplay features and activities, and most participants preferred not to play videogames after school due to other priorities.\n\nThe concept of ‘serious games’ indicates that there are games that can have an educational purpose on top of being entertaining. In this paper it is argued that all games, not just educational games, try to state something about the real world. Several manifestations of ideology in games are explored to illustrate this point. The threat of ideologically motivated rhetoric in games threatening the freedom of young game players leads many scholars to believe there is a need for a game literacy: the development of a skill that learns gamers to objectively evaluate this rhetoric.This discourse on game literacies falls together with discourse on new media literacies and is permeated with ideas pertaining to a technological imaginary. In this paper, the problematic conceptualization of this game literacy is addressed and it is argued that there is no such need for a game literacy."
