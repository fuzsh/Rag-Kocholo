        "text": "Secret Science Club presents an encore edition of the “Dana Foundation Neuroscience & Society Talk Series” on DANCE, MOVEMENT AND THE BRAIN featuring Neuroscientist & Dancer CONSTANTINA THEOFANOPOULOU\n\nJoin us live via ZOOM on Wednesday, July 24 @ 8PM (Eastern Time USA)\"Doors\" open at 7:30PM,FREE!\n\nHere's how to sign up: Everyone on our mailing list will be emailed the Zoom link the night before. To join the Secret Science Club mailing list (or just request the Zoom link), send us an email (secretscienceclub@gmail.com)\n\nDance is a universal part of our culture—whether you’re doing ballet, ballroom, the latest TikTok dance craze, or just freestyling on the dance floor with friends. And guess what?\n\nIt turns out this urge to express ourselves through movement has some fantastic side benefits. A growing body of research is revealing that dancing can be therapeutic, emotionally uplifting, and healthy for our brains.\n\nJoin us at the next Secret Science Club Online with neuroscientist & dancer Constantina Theofanopoulou as we explore how dance, rhythm, and movement affect our minds, our moods, and our well-being.\n\nCONSTANTINA THEOFANOPOULOU is a neuroscientist and an award-winning flamenco dancer. She is the Herbert and Nell Singer Research Assistant Professor at Rockefeller University, a Visiting Scholar at New York University, and a Research Associate at Emory University and the US Department of Veteran Affairs. She’s using her experience in dance to inform research on the connections between dance and speech—and the possibility that dance therapy might improve deficits in speech, particularly among people coping with Parkinson’s Disease. Before & After\n\n--Mix up our cocktail & mocktail of the night, the Sip & Twirl (recipe to come!)\n\n--Shimmy to synapse-soothing grooves\n\n--Bring your questions for the live Q&A This encore edition of Secret Science Club - the “Dana Foundation Neuroscience & Society Talk Series” - is supported by the Dana Foundation as part of its Dana Education program. The Foundation’s mission is to advance neuroscience that benefits society and reflects the aspirations of all people.\n\nTHIS IS A FREE EVENT.\n\n(Note: If you don't already have the Zoom meeting app on your computer or mobile device, you can download it for free at zoom.us)\n\nThis program is supported, in part, by public funds from the New York City Department of Cultural Affairs in partnership with the City Council.\n\nSecret Science Club Online presents Award-winning Science Writer Ferris Jabr on Becoming Earth: How Our Planet Came to Life, FREE!\n\nJoin us live via ZOOM on TUESDAY, July 9 @ 8PM (Eastern Time USA) \"Doors\" open at 7:30PM\n\nShhh... everyone on our mailing list will be emailed the Zoom link the night before. To join the Secret Science Club mailing list (or just request the Zoom link), send us an email (secretscienceclub@gmail.com)\n\nThe notion of a living world is one of humanity’s oldest beliefs. Though once scorned by some scientists, the concept of Earth as a vast interconnected living system has gained acceptance in recent decades. A relatively young field called Earth system science now studies the living and nonliving components of the planet as an integrated whole.\n\nWe, and all living things, are more than inhabitants of Earth—we are an outgrowth of Earth’s structure and an engine of its evolution. Life and its environment have coevolved for billions of years, transforming a lump of orbiting rock into a cosmic oasis—a planet that breathes, metabolizes, and regulates its climate.\n\nAt the next Secret Science Club Online, Ferris Jabr—the author of Becoming Earth: How Our Planet Came to Life—discusses this radical new view of our planet, where lush forests spew water, pollen, and bacteria to summon rain; giant animals engineer the very landscapes they roam; microbes chew rock to shape continents; and microscopic plankton remake the air and sea.\n\nHumans are one of the most extreme examples of life transforming Earth. Through fossil fuel use, agriculture, and pollution, we have altered more layers of the planet in less time than any other species, pushing Earth into a crisis. But we are also uniquely able to understand and protect the planet’s wondrous ecology and self-stabilizing processes. How well we play our part will determine what kind of Earth our descendants inherit for millennia to come.\n\nBefore & After\n\n-- Mix up our eco-cocktail & mocktail of the evening, the \"Pale Blue Dot\"… (recipe below!)\n\n--Groove to wild & wonderful tunes\n\n--Bring your questions for the live Q&A\n\n--Snag a copy of Ferris Jabr’s critically acclaimed new book, Becoming Earth: How Our Planet Came to Life\n\nFerris Jabr is a contributing writer for The New York Times Magazine and Scientific American. He has also written for The New Yorker, The Atlantic, Harper’s, National Geographic, Wired, Outside, Lapham’s Quarterly, McSweeney’s, and The Los Angeles Review of Books, among other publications. He is the recipient of a Whiting Foundation Creative Nonfiction Grant, as well as fellowships from UC Berkeley and the MIT Knight Science Journalism Program. His work has been anthologized in several editions of The Best American Science and Nature Writing series.\n\nThis is a FREE event.\n\nWhat's next at Secret Science Club?\n\nOn Wednesday July 24, we’ll be back on Zoom with an encore edition of the \"Dana Foundation Neuroscience and Society Talk Series\" on \"Art & the Brain\" with brain scientist & dancer Constantina Theofanopoulou. Stay tuned for details!\n\nYou can support Secret Science Club's programming by making a DONATION via:\n\nCredit Card, PayPal, Apple Pay, or Google Pay on Donorbox\n\nCash App: $SecretScienceClub\n\nZelle: scienceliveproductions@gmail.com\n\n(Note: If you don't already have the Zoom meeting app on your computer or mobile device, you can download it for free at zoom.us)\n\nCocktail Recipe for the “Pale Blue Dot” (created by the Secret Science Club Experimental Mixology Lab)\n\nIngredients: 5 Mint Leaves; 8 Fresh Blueberries; ½ oz Simple Syrup*; 1 oz Fresh-squeezed Lime Juice; 2 oz White Rum; Ice Cubes; Sparkling Water (to top off); plus a Mint Sprig, Slice of Lime, and a few more Blueberries for garnish\n\n- Combine mint leaves, lime juice, blueberries, and simple syrup in a cocktail shaker, and gently muddle\n\n- After muddling, add the rum and a handful of ice, then shake until chilled\n\n- Strain the mixture into a highball glass filled with ice cubes and top off with sparkling water\n\n- Garnish with the mint sprig, lime slice, and blueberries\n\n*Simple Syrup Recipe:\n\n- Mix 1 part water and 1 part sugar in a pot. Simmer until sugar dissolves. Let cool.\n\n**(For a mocktail version, skip the rum and substitute lemon-lime soda or ginger ale for the sparkling water.)\n\nThis program is supported, in part, by public funds from the New York City Department of Cultural Affairs in partnership with the City Council.\n\nSPECIAL EVENT! Secret Science Club teams up with Hudson River Park's \"Ask a Scientist\" to present an all-aquatic evening in Lower Manhattan\n\nThursday, June 13 @ 6:30PM, $10. (Reserve your tickets.)\n\nSecret Science Club flows into Hudson River Park's Wetlab on beautiful Pier 40 to explore the amazing creatures living in our waters (sharks! seahorses!), how they are cared for at the city’s aquariums, and how they are studied in the wild.\n\nJoin us with biologists Hans Walters and Siddhartha Hayes for this special Ask a Scientist event.\n\nBefore & After the Talks\n\n--Get up close and personal with wildlife from NYC’s liquid wilderness.

In a series of groundbreaking discoveries, biochemists including Tom Cech have revealed that RNA—long overlooked as a passive agent of DNA—sits at the center of biology’s greatest mysteries: What makes us human? How did life begin on Earth? Why do we get sick, and why do we grow old?\n\nAt this special edition of the Secret Science Club, Nobel Prize winner Tom Cech explores how RNA holds the key to the intricate machinery of our cells. And he gives us a thrilling glimpse into RNA-powered therapies—from CRISPR (the revolutionary gene-editing tool that offers the hitherto unthinkable power to rewrite the code of life) to the groundbreaking mRNA vaccines that have saved millions during the pandemic.\n\nAs we dive further into the age of RNA, we have only begun to unlock the true potential of this powerhouse molecule. What cures and treatments might future research bring?\n\nTHOMAS R. CECH is a distinguished professor of biochemistry at the University of Colorado Boulder and a Howard Hughes Medical Institute research scientist. His many honors include the Nobel Prize in Chemistry, the National Medal of Science, and the Albert Lasker Basic Medical Research Award. His paradigm-shifting discovery of self-splicing RNA and the catalytic properties of RNA opened the door to further groundbreaking findings, including his lab’s discovery of TERT (telomerase reverse transcriptase), a major cancer-causing gene. His new popular science book, The Catalyst, has been dubbed “a masterful account of the RNA revolution in biology and medicine by one of its brilliant pioneers” and an “expert update on the hottest topics in biology.”\n\nBefore & After\n\n--Mix up our cocktail & mocktail of the night, the \"Good Chemistry\"… (recipe is below!)\n\n--Groove to our synergizing playlist\n\n--Zoom in for a chance to win cool prizes!\n\n--Bring your questions for the live audience Q&A\n\n--Snag a copy of Tom Cech’s brand-new book, The Catalyst: RNA and the Quest to Unlock Life’s Deepest Secrets\n\nThis edition of the Secret Science Club, the Spring 2024 Lasker Public Lecture in honor of Al Sommer, is sponsored by the Lasker Foundation.
