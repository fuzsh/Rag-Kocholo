        "text": "Going to Mars: The Nikki Giovanni Project\n\nA film by Michèle Stephenson & Joe Brewster 2023\n\nGoing to Mars takes us through the mind-scape of legendary poet, Nikki Giovanni. Her voice guides us across time and outer space, dreams and remembrances, and across decades of American history, as we reimagine her most iconic work with visual lyricism fit for a poet. The film’s cinematic intergalactic journey ventures beyond Nikki’s own lifetime, to Middle Passage and Mars, always keeping hold of possibility and the potential of Black liberation.\n\nThe 19th: Breaking the News\n\nA film by Heather Courtney & Chelsea Sonnen Hernandez 2023\n\nBreaking The News, previously The Untitled 19th News Documentary: follows a fearless group of female journalists in 2020, including founder Emily Ramshaw and editor-at-large Errin Haines, as they seek to ​upend the status quo by launching an all-women news start-up. ​Building a newsroom that reflects the women they’re writing about, Breaking The News could be a model in these changing times — If they can survive their tumultuous first year.\n\nWhat We Leave Behind\n\nA film by Iliana Sosa 2022\n\nAt the age of 89, Julián takes one last bus ride to El Paso, Texas, to visit his daughters and their children — a lengthy trip he has made without fail every month for decades. After returning to rural Mexico, he quietly starts building a house in the empty lot next to his home. In the absence of his physical visits, can this new house bridge the distance between his loved ones?\n\nOver several years, director Iliana Sosa films her grandfather’s work, gently sifting through Julián’s previously unspoken memories brought up by the construction project and revealing both the daily pragmatism and poetry of his life. What We Leave Behind unfolds as a love letter to her grandfather, as well as an intimate and insightful exploration of Iliana’s own relationship with him and his homeland."
