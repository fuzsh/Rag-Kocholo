        "text": "The article deals with the change of paradigms in European urban thinking through time. The principles of Modern City Planning conceived in the first half of the 20th century, which despised the classical ideals of the European city and of historical urban environments, as well as the subsequent advent of their counterplot, i.e. the approach of integrated conservation and preservation planning, are seen as the two main opposing tendencies of city development in the last 100 years. They have preceded and, in a sense, prepared the way for a new urban consciousness which puts emphasis on the principles of sustainable development in both global and local terms. While the pressing demands for sustainability have been taken into consideration and even recorded in the law on a certain level in most European countries at the turn of this century, there are still many other new-type urban phenomena which express the present-day tendencies of change in our city-life. The breaking of the traditional space-time relationship due to the arrival of the Internet and the multicultural post-modern urban nomadism, which both go together with a tremendous worldwide economic, social, and environmental restructuration, are among them. As a result, the concept of place has lost its former meaning as an explicitly physical scene. At the same time, mentally, socially and culturally processed issues, such as the identity of a place, have become more and more important putting emphasis on the type of interaction between different people and the places of their lives. Thus the question of dwelling (in Heideggerian terms) and the expression of multi-cultural identities in our post-modern “collage cities” have become fundamental urban issues, which concern not only the very essence of the city, but also the actual paradigms of urbanism. In the old continent today, city planning is most often less concerned with building new environments than with transforming extant environments, which happens in interaction with old and new and in a new kind of synergy. Multicultural and tolerant living environments with different historical, social and cultural layers function as magnets for creative people and for inspiring city-life. Key words: conception of the city, sustainability, identity of place, mosaic identity, urban interaction\n\nThe ongoing discussion on the privatization of cities primarily focuses on the controlled spaces of gated communities in the outskirts just as in inner city neighborhoods. However, the physical gating of neighborhoods is increasingly being replaced by other, soft forms of inclusion and exclusion. Not being physically gated or walled has become one of the Unique Selling Points of communities designed according to the concepts of new urbanism. The production of hegemonic urban spaces in these areas is accomplished by tight regulations on the physical environment and “declarations of covenants”, stretching beyond the public governmental realm and into the control of personal lives. More subtle forms of control have evolved and have been transferred to privatized public spaces of inner city areas. The paper puts the discussion forward by extending the discursive context of soft urbanism to the strengthening strategic role of urban governments. The Historic City Center of Vienna serves as an example of converging policies set in effect by private actors and the city administration. In contrast to a privatization of the public realm, in the Historic City Center of Vienna power relations are continuously shifting towards the institutional networks of the municipality, becoming the major player, developer and investor in the production of the meaning, the narrative and the affects attached to the Historic City Center. The tightening regulations for the Historic City Center indicate a programmatic convergence between the concepts of new urbanism and regulations, enacted by the urban government. Empirical analyses, presented in the paper, reveal how power and control are increasingly exerted over residents, private entrepreneurs and private developers alike. The analysis is based on different multi-scaled approaches. The introductory section examines the accelerating deployment of regulations and control. General codes and directives are increasingly supplemented by more detailed, small-scale guidelines just as their objectives are shifting towards the production of ambience based on the thematic production of the city’s narrative. Akin to privatized urban spaces, power is exerted by the cultural reproduction of the Historic City Center, reducing the discrepancy between the imagined and the real city. The mediated translation of power is examined in the second section, critically dissecting the conceptualization of downtown redevelopment projects. Social control and control of social interaction are becoming unfolded by the continuous negotiations of the urban stakeholders. The incremental closing down of options in the public realm is supported by empirical data on the changing economic, social, cultural and institutional assets attached to the Historic City Center of Vienna. The urban functions of the city center follow the new urban form. The third section refers back to the broader conceptual framework of urban renaissance. The re-definition of the strategic function and power of the municipality in the context of urban renaissance is scrutinized in terms of power enacted by constraints of economy and globalization and raises the question of alternate solutions.

It shows that change takes many varied and complex paths, rather than the mainstream simplified model of general urban evolution. Changing Places collects a series of case studies, and includes various European cities such as Marseille, Rome, Naples, Warsaw, Frankfurt, Athens, Copenhagen, Lisbon, and Ørestad, thus providing a broad European overview. Since the end of the 80s, new neighbourhoods have been built or modified in all parts of Europe. These changes are commonly either uncritically acknowledged, or heavily condemned, and their complex nature is rarely investigated. The presentation by the news and papers of some of the following case-studies elicits some considerations. A semi official web-site emphatically insists that in 1993, it was decided to build and develop “a mini metropolis” outside of Copenhagen, in the new Ørestad areas. At the turn of the millennium, a collection of flats, hotels, shopping centres and malls, retail stores, the new IT University and the Southern Campus was built. The traditional image of Psiri in Athens is one of a “village within the city”, but also one of decay and falsification. The storyline says that artists and cultural groups gathered there in the late 1980s; soon, however, the night-time economy took over. Nowadays, the neighbourhood struggles against the “fake” image of many commercial districts. Again, Lisbon held an Expo in 1998, reconverting a major industrial area as an extension to the city. A plan was designed, influenced by major intellectuals, to recapture “the past, the present and the future” of the nation on the banks of the Tagus River. One could go on quoting the enormous amount of expectations and hopes linked with the promotion of new neighbourhoods in Europe in the last years. What do all of these developments of neighbourhoods and redevelopments of places have in common beyond rhetoric, symbolism and storytelling? What if such stories are an integral part of these areas’ material changes? To paraphrase an oft-quoted Shakespearean line, neighbourhoods and places are “such stuff as dreams are made of”. In present day usage, \"the stuff of dreams\" refers to wishes and desires: in the poem and in this book, the \"stuff of dreams\" refers to the materials that create an illusion. Are the new neighbourhoods developed across Europe just an illusion? Not at all, of course: on the contrary, they are the material, often dull, contested, heavy substance that fashions the dream of the 21st century city. This latter is often sold as an illusion, the appeased image of the renaissance city, hub of creativity, tolerance, growth and competitiveness. These are profound ideological images, deeply rooted inside the common wisdom of urban policies that often misguide urban research. This book looks at some of the new neighbourhoods, either newly and purposely built, or redeveloped from ashes and scratch, to address the nature of the ongoing urban change and of their ideology, where discourse and reality are strictly interwoven and hard to unravel. The following chapters, based upon original pieces of research carried out by a group of researchers from different countries and backgrounds, try to reveal some of the materials that have created such an illusion: political, economical, design materials, and more symbolic “stuff” as well. In doing so, the case studies re-combine the reconstruction of the practices of planning and design, and the critique of the discourses that have paved the way to such practices, in both the technical arena and the public opinion. Eventually, the investigation of matter and dreams, built space and public images, leads to a better understanding of the political constitution of new neighbourhoods."
