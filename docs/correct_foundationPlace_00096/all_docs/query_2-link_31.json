        "text": "Never Home Alone – Jan 10\n\nAfter nearly three years of increased \"sheltering at home,\" you may have noticed more six-legged critters sharing your shelter. Scientists, too, have been taking a closer look at these more numerous (and more brazen?) insect invaders. What surprising findings have the researchers uncovered?\n\nOur speaker is Dr. Vernard Lewis, Cooperative Extension Specialist (emeritus) at UC Berkeley. Dr. Lewis is a global authority on termites, and his research has explored other home-invading creepy-crawlers: ants, bedbugs, and cockroaches.\n\nDr. Vernard Lewis\n\nWHAT: Never Home Alone: Six-Legged Invaders Under Your Roof\n\nWHO: Dr. Vernard Lewis, Cooperative Extension Specialist, Emeritus, UC Berkeley [https://ourenvironment.berkeley.edu/people/vernard-lewis]\n\nWHERE: ONLINE, via Zoom [https://us02web.zoom.us/j/81988868346]\n\nWHEN: 2023-01-10 — 8pm , Tue, January 10th (1 hour)\n\nHOW:\n\nThis event is free and unticketed. To support Wonderfest's nonprofit mission of science outreach, please make a modest (or immodest!) donation in the Eventbrite space, below. (Kindly ignore Eventbrite's mention of \"sales;\" it really is a donation!)\n\nGoing to the Stars – Jan 9\n\nThe stars beckon. Alas, interstellar distances are fantastically challenging. (A lightbeam needs 1/7th of a second to go around the world, but over 4 years to reach our Sun's nearest-neighbor star, Proxima Centauri.) Determined explorers at Breakthrough Starshot are developing miniature robot space probes — to be accelerated by laser light from Earth — whose cameras can reach Proxima Centauri in just 20 years! Among the wonders to be explored are Proxima's three known planets, including Proxima b, which orbits in this red dwarf star's \"habitable zone.\"\n\nOur speaker, Dr. S. Pete Worden, is Chairman of the Breakthrough Prize Foundation and Executive Director of the Breakthrough Initiatives (of which Breakthrough StarShot is one program). Formerly, Dr. Worden was Director of NASA Ames Research Center.\n\nPlease REGISTER now.\n\nDr. Pete Worden\n\nWHAT: Going to the Stars — Breakthrough Initiatives\n\nWHO: Dr. Pete Worden, Executive Director, Breakthrough Starshot [https://breakthroughinitiatives.org/initiative/3]\n\nWHERE: Castro Valley Library, 3600 Norbridge Ave, Castro Valley, CA 94546\n\nWHEN: 2023-01-09 — 7:00pm, Mon, January 9 (1.5 hr)\n\nHOW:\n\nThis COVID-cautious FREE event will take place in the spacious Castro Valley Library. For your own COVID safety — and that of others — please consider wearing a protective mask.\n\nCollaborators:\n\nCastro Valley Education Foundation [https://www.cvef.org]\n\nCastro Valley Science [https://cvscience.us]\n\nREGISTER: Please register to help us understand our audience, and we will notifiy you when the event draws near.\n\nhttps://www.eventbrite.com/e/going-to-the-stars-the-first-mission-to-proxima-centauri-science-talk-tickets-483854280177?aff=wf\n\nHuman Populations – Dec 8\n\nHow long will the people in a particular population live? How do we know if a cancer treatment works, or whether parents pass their socioeconomic status to their children? How often do formerly incarcerated people return to prison, and how long (on average) will current marriages last? All these questions seem straightforward. However, answering each of them can go awry in a similar way. A single mathematical relationship, length-biased sampling, allows analysis of a diverse set of phenomena, and it presents new, easy-to-understand insights into human populations.\n\nOur speaker, Dr. Elizabeth Wrigley-Field, is Assistant Professor at the University of Minnesota in the Department of Sociology and at the Minnesota Population Center.\n\nDr. Elizabeth Wrigley-Field\n\nWHAT: Understanding Human Populations\n\nWHO: Dr. Elizabeth Wrigley-Field, Assistant Professor of Sociology, University of Minnesota [https://cla.umn.edu/about/directory/profile/ewf]\n\nWHERE: ONLINE, Via Zoom [https://us02web.zoom.us/j/84820052543]\n\nWHEN: 2022-12-08 — 8pm PST, Thu, Dec 8 (1 hr)\n\nHOW:\n\nPlease use the Eventbrite space, below, to support Wonderfest's nonprofit mission of science outreach. Make a modest (or immodest!) donation, and share the scientific outlook with others. (This Zoom event is free and unticketed; please ignore all mention of \"sales,\" below.)\n\nG’ Night Oppy + JWST – Dec 4\n\nWonderfest joins St. Helena's Cameo Cinema to present a heavenly double feature: first, the remarkable true story of NASA's Opportunity rover (which ventured to Mars for a 90-day mission, but survived — and explored — for 15 years!), followed by Q&A with legendary astrophysicist Dr. Alex Filippenko (discussing both the exploration of Mars AND the promise of NASA's new James Webb Space Telescope, JWST). This special two-for-one event is a national Science On Screen presentation.\n\nDr. Alex Filippenko is the Richard & Rhoda Goldman Distinguished Professor in the Physicsal Sciences and Professor of Astronomy at UC Berkeley. Alex has earned Wonderfest's Carl Sagan Prize for Science Popularization, and he is an esteemed member of Wonderfest's Board of Directors.\n\nDr. Alex Filippenko\n\nWHAT: Good Night Oppy + James Webb Space Telescope\n\nWHO: Dr. Alex Filippenko, Professor of Astronomy, UC Berkeley [https://astro.berkeley.edu/people/alex-filippenko/]\n\nWHERE: Cameo Cinema, 1340 Main Street, St. Helena, CA 94574\n\nWHEN: 2022-12-04 — 1pm, Sunday, December 4 (2 hr)\n\nHOW:\n\nPurchase tickets for both the screening of Good Night, Oppy and for the post-screening interview and audience Q&A with Prof. Filippenko at the Cameo Cinema \"Tickets\" link, below. (Each ticket covers both experiences.)\n\nCollaborators:\n\nCameo Cinema [https://www.cameocinema.com/about]\n\nWebb Space Telescope – Nov 30\n\nNASA's James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) is a pioneering tool of cosmic discovery. Beyond its beautiful initial images, JWST promises to show us an \"invisible universe\" of infrared light, particularly allowing astronomers to learn about cosmic evolution — the birth and eventual death of stars, galaxies, and the cosmos itself.\n\nOur JWST explorer is Andrew Fraknoi, emeritus chair of the Astronomy Department at Foothill College and first recipient of Wonderfest's Carl Sagan Prize for Science Popularization.\n\nThis event is produced by the Commonwealth Club in collaboration with Wonderfest. We can enjoy it in either of two ways: in person or online. Access to the two different ticket types is described in the HOW space, below. Each type is deeply discounted for Wondernauts who use discount code Wonderfest2022.\n\nAndrew Fraknoi\n\nWHAT: The James Webb Space Telescope: Our Giant Eye on the Invisible Sky\n\nWHO: Andrew Fraknoi, Astronomy Department Chair Emeritus, Foothill College [https://www.fraknoi.com]\n\nWHERE: Commonwealth Club, 110 The Embarcadero, San Francisco — or — Online\n\nWHEN: 2022-11-30 — 5:30pm, Wed, Nov 30 (1 hour)\n\nHOW:\n\nFor tickets to either the in-person event or the online event, start at the Commonwealth Club \"Tickets\" website presented below. Be sure to use the discount code Wonderfest2022 (and click \"Apply\") to reduce the cost of the in-person ticket by $10, and to render the online ticket completely FREE.\n\nCollaborators:\n\nThe Commonwealth Club of California\n\nMathematics of Language – Nov 29\n\nIf your native language (Irish, Igbo, Ilocano, . . .) is threatened by competition from another language (likely English!), and if preserving that language is important, what options do you have? Which approach to language preservation is most likely to be effective? Or... How much time do you have before the language is effectively dead? Surprisingly, tools from mathematical ecology, physics, and other seemingly remote fields have been adapted to answer questions about the evolution, competition, and even origin of human languages.\n\nOur speaker, Dr. Ben Ford, is Professor of Mathematics at Sonoma State University. His research background lies in combinatorics and group theory, and he works to further equity in math education.\n\nDr. Ben Ford\n\nWHAT: The Mathematics of Language\n\nWHO: Dr. Ben Ford, Professor of Mathematics, Sonoma State University\n\nWHERE: HopMonk Tavern, 224 Vintage Way, Novato, CA 94945 [https://www.hopmonk.com/novato]\n\nWHEN: 2022-11-29 — 7pm, Tuesday, Nov 29 (1.5 hour)\n\nHOW:\n\nThis unticketed, admission-free, Wonderfest event will be COVID-free, as well. Please be vaccinated, and kindly wear a mask (except when dining/drinking). The warm feeling of Wondernaut(!) camaraderie radiates through masks and across wide seat-spacing. Please join us! Also, kindly consider donating to nonprofit Wonderfest in the Eventbrite space, below.

For humans, sleep is essential for physical and mental health — as necessary as food, water, and oxygen. Yet many of us get insufficient and/or low-quality sleep. UCSF's Dr. Aric Prather has just written The Sleep Prescription: Seven Days to Unlocking Your Best Rest. During this online presentation, Dr. Prather will share many of his book's insights with the Commonwealth Club and Wonderfest.\n\nDr. Aric Prather is Professor of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences at the University of California, San Francisco. He directs UCSF's Behavioral Sleep Medicine Research Program.\n\nThis online event is produced by the Commonwealth Club in collaboration with Wonderfest.

The Thirty Meter Telescope (TMT) will collect 9 times more light than the largest currently existing telescope and, with adaptive optics, make images 9 times sharper. Overall, that’s 81 times better! The TMT International Observatory (with members from the US, Japan, China, India, & Canada), together with its partner in the southern hemisphere, the Giant Magellan Telescope, will give humanity a powerful new system to probe the full sweep of the cosmos — from the nearest stars and their planets, to black holes in our Galaxy, and on out to the edge of the visible universe where we see the very first stars and galaxies beginning to form.\n\nOur speaker is astrophysicist Dr. Robert Kirshner, Executive Director of the TMT International Observatory and Clowes Professor of Science, emeritus, at Harvard University.

The resumption of travel and in-person activities seems to corroborate this view. Meanwhile, the current COVID death rate in the US puts us on track for nearly 150,000 excess deaths (per year) and a marked lowering of overall life expectancy. This presentation, with a healthy amount of audience Q&A, will explore the relationship between science and narrative in confronting SARS-Cov2.\n\nOur speaker, Dr. Robert Siegel, is Professor of Microbiology and Immunology at Stanford University.

Due to the humble spud's capacity to keep people alive in so many diverse environments, several cultures lay claim to originating it. The potato actually first emerged 10,000 years ago in highland South America. While introducing the science of the potato and its complexities of diversification, we will learn how it is farmed in its home and how pople are helping it adapt to the changing climate.\n\nOur speaker, Dr. Christine Hastorf, is Professor of Anthropology at UC Berkeley.

Today, it is a vast galaxy, an \"island universe,\" of almost unimaginable proportions. (A light beam will circle Earth 7 times in a second; but to span the planets, stars, black holes, and dark matter of the Milky Way, light needs more than 100,000 years!) Astronomer and folklorist Dr. Moiya McTier explores this vastness in her new book, The Milky Way: An Autobiography of Our Galaxy. According to Caltech physicist and author Sean Carroll (next month's Commonwealth/Wonderfest speaker): \"It's about time we heard the story of the Milky Way in its own words. The good news is that our galaxy is not only ancient and magestic; it's also whimisical, amusing, and downright chatty. Moiya McTier's book is an entertaining introduction to some of the most profound features of our astrophysical neighborhood.\"\n\nDr. Moiya McTier is \"folklorist to the stars and astrophysicist to the folks.\" She earned bachelors degrees in astrophysics and folklore/mythology from Harvard University, and an astronomy PhD from Columbia University.

My personal gravitational waves are far too feeble to detect. However, the spacetime waves of cataclysmic astronomical events (exploding stars, the merger of black holes, and the big bang itself) are relatively mighty.

(And recall: \"In science, theory is as good as it gets!”) Yet, there is a problem: What does this immensely fruitful theory say about deep reality? Why does “measurement” play a special role in the theory? Can we say anything about atoms and subatomic particles when we’re not actually measuring them? For years, the standard answer to questions like this was to “shut up and calculate” — to ignore these issues, and simply use quantum physics to predict the outcomes of experiments. But our curiosity persists. What are the puzzles at the heart of quantum physics, and why do they matter?\n\nOur speaker, Dr. Adam Becker, is a freelance author and astrophysicist. He has written for the NY Times, BBC, NPR, New Scientist, Scientific American, et al. His most recent book, WHAT IS REAL?
