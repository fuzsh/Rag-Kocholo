        "text": "gameSlave: Pool Party Review\n\ngameSlave writes: \" This is one of those of those reference moments. A single point in time against which we will compare all others yet to come, and one which we add to the scope of our experience to better understand our past. This is the game that when myself and my colleagues here, for the foreseeable future, say that we've 'played worse games', or point out that a title 'isn't the most cynically produced around': this is that game that we're referring to. Pool Party is hands down the worst game I can currently recall playing or even seeing.\n\nI'm prepared to admit a certain amount of this reaction might be due to the experience still being fresh in my mind, like a sticky shameful stain on my short term memory. After a little more reflection I might actually recall a worse title, but just now this is all I can think of.\"\n\nGood stuff\n\n* Nothing\n\nNot so good stuff\n\n* Absolutely everything"
