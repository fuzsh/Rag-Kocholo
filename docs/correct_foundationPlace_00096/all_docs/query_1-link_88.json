        "text": "It's great to hear how everybody is doing! I'm looking foward to seeing all of you very soon. As for me...Apparently I didn't get enough of the \"cheerleading thing\" in high school so I tried out for the Oakland Raiderettes and cheered for them for one year. Fun but lotsa work and VERY time consuming. I began working for Bank of Marin in San Rafael six years ago and just recently accepted a job with First Republic in Santa Rosa. I live with my best friend, soul mate, and boyfriend, aka: Adam Fisher (Larkspur Fire Fighter). We have been together for a little over three years. Life has never been better! We are looking to buy a home in Sonoma County in the near future. In my not so free time I design jewelry. I do a lot of wedding parties, sell to some local Botiques, and my friends are all very supportive. This has become more of a passion than a hobby. Our house looks like a Jelly Bean factory. Beads everywhere! (Works in progress) Can't wait for the reunion After leaving the hallowed hall (?) of San Marin I worked my way through school and life. I landed a job at a pastry shop purely by accident and found my calling. I was a pastry chef for 5 years and worked my way from baking cookies to making and designing wedding cakes (including a few alumni wedding cakes.) I met my fantabulous husband Jeric at work in 1994 and we married in 2000. In June 2002 we had our son Jaden and life REALLY began. This summer we moved to a ranch in Tomales. Its crazy having cows look over our back fence. I am running a Cold Stone Creamery in Petaluma which is fun. Its more high school counselor than boss, but its the easiest job I've ever had and I have plenty of time to hang out with the fam! I'm looking forward to seeing everyone in November. My husband and I met in Chico while working on our undergraduate studies. After completing our BA's we both decided to stay another year and got into graduate school. After completing graduate work, I wanted to move back to Marin and he wanted to move back to Ventura county where is was from. When he got a job offer in Marin as a Social Worker in a hospital, he accepted the offer and we both moved in together. We just got married last year in April and bought a house in Napa county. We are now expecting our first baby to arrive on December 24th. After graduating from the U of O, I moved to Portland and started working as a finacial aidcounselor at a small, liberal arts university. After 3 years there I accepted a position at Portland State University, and stayed there for a few more years. Justin (who's from New Hampshire) and I were married here in Portland in 2001, and bought our first home in 2002. This past January I started working at Willamette University as Assistant Director of Financial Aid. Justin's a high school language arts and social studies teacher. We're big fans of Oregon football and European soccer (the real football). I'm really looking forward to seeing everyone! After graduating from Tufts University in 1997, I remained in Boston and worked in the field of public health for five years. Before I entered graduate school, I was the Health Program Coordinator for a non-profit organization called South Africa Partners. My role was to establish public health relationships between US agencies and South African agencies. Now I am about to enter my second year at Rollins School of Public Health in Atlanta, working towards my Masters in Public Health in the department of International Health and focusing on Community Health and Development. Overall life is good! Looking forward to the reunion. After four freezing winters in the Midwest, I realized that the Bay Area really ain't such a bad place to be, and high-tailed it back here. Started working as an editor at BabyCenter.com (actually getting some use out of a journalism degree!) right at the beginning of the dot-com boom, then moved on to (and was laid off from) Reel.com and Emode.com. After a year of contracting, managed to stick with the movie thing and am now happily working at Netflix (along with John Ciancutti!). Doing an insane commute from SF (I live in Inner Richmond) to Los Gatos, dating a wonderful guy, and writing DVD reviews on the side definitely keeps me busy... Now I really feel like an old man. I can't believe ten years have passed. I am married to a graduate of San Rafael High. I have two girls. Own a house in Fairfield. I work in San Rafael. I have run into a few of my former classmates. (On and Off-duty :)) You know who you are. I have an occasional dinner with Dave and Atilla at their new restuarant. After SMHS, I retired & became a hermit, locked away in my bedroom playing Emerald Dawn songs.\n\nNo, seriously, life is good. I live & work in Sacramento, got married 4 years ago, bought a house, gained some weight, basically enjoying life, & am starting to think about kids: gulp. Currently, I'm working toward professional licensing in Land Surveying. I'm almost there & plan on sitting for the PLS exam in April. After that, I'd like to work toward setting up a small business, but that's probably still a few years away.\n\nAnyhow, I'm looking forward to seeing people at the reunion. I've completely lost touch with everyone & don't think I've even spoken to anyone from SM since the impromptu reunion Heather Nickel organized 5 years ago, so hopefully it'll be a good opportunity to catch up with some old friends.\n\nAfter graduating from San Marin, I went to Cal Berkeley for undergrad (rooming with Saxon Noh for 4 years and Tysen Streib for one) and finished with a B.A. in Bio. I went to New York City after that to study optometry and finally finished with school altogether in 2001. While waiting for my license to come through, I worked at the Gap in the Northgate Mall, which was surprisingly fun.\n\nI live in Pasadena now, and I practice at a laser surgery center. I'm not married, but I am dating this really great girl. And I'm really looking forward to seeing everyone again at the reunion.\n\nAfter having my tape player destroyed by a renegade Emerald Dawn bootleg casette, I entered into years of depression until I realized that it would be quicker and cheaper to just buy a new tape player, and proceed with my life. I found my wife and lover, a relentlessly self-improving boulangerie owner from Belgium. She had low-grade narcolepsy and a penchant for buggery, but that didn't stop me. She'd been known to make outrageous claims, like that she invented the question mark. After 2 months of marriage, her behaviour became quite bizarre. For example, sometimes, she would accuse chestnuts of being lazy - the sort of general malaise that only the genius possess and the insane lament. Being a bachelor again was refreshing; I spent last summer in Rangoon, taking luge lessons. Later in the spring, I made meat helmets. When I was insolent, I was placed in a burlap bag and beaten with reeds. Pretty standard, really. Chad (an American High graduate from Fremont) and I moved up to Washington right after we were married because of his job (he's a network administrator [read: computer geek]). We were able to buy a house right away, and have now moved into a bigger house on account of Benjamin, our son. (We also have 2 cats, 1 dog, and a variety of fish.) I graduated from Davis in '97 and got my Masters in Teaching and teaching certification from Seattle U in 2000. I am now going into my 4th year as a third grade teacher in a small Catholic school near my house. I was lucky enough to be able to go part time last year after Benjamin was born, and will work part-time again this year. Hope to see you in November! I got over my shy state of affairs in college. I haven't stopped talking since. (Hence my nick name Gaby.) I went to Chico State for 2 years. I hated it - too small for me. So I headed to the LA area to go crazy for 6 years. I decided to come back home after my sister had her first child. I don't have any kids but I have a wonderful nephew and niece. (Perfect! I can give them back after the witching hour begins.) I work for a mortgage company in San Francisco. I'm still kicking around the idea of getting my Real Estate license since I have the \"gift to gab.\" I am training for the Honolulu marathon through the National AIDS Center Here's my shameless plug: You can donate to this special cause and keep up with my progress: http://aidsmarathon.com/participant.jsp?runner=SF-0043&year=2003. Looking forward to seeing you all. After San Marin I attended SRJC and then enrolled at UCSB in 1995. I competed on both the SRJC and the UCSB Track team in the Shot Put and Hammer Throw. After graduating in 1998 from UCSB, I was invited to join an Olympic Weightlifting team, Team Southern California. I ended up placing 12th in my weight class at the National Championships. I was then offered a position at Univ Texas, El Paso as a Graduate Assistant Strength and Conditioning Coach. I was there for 9 months living in the basement of an Irish Nun's house, sister Buffy (quite an experience). If you live in El Paso now, I am sorry. If you ever have the chance to go there, Don't! I then took a job as an assistant at UCLA. Now I am the Head Strength and Conditioning Coach for Cal State Northridge. I absolutely love my job. I hope everyone is doing well and it will be great to see you at the reunion. In February of 1997 my daughter Axelina was born. We moved to Denmark for 3 years. Came back in 2000, met a great man and married in August of 2001. Was pregnant again, but got deadly sick and my son J.T. was born 4 months early on September 18, 2001 at UCSF. He weighed a whopping 1 pound 1 ounce. The doctors thought I was going to need a liver transplant, but luckily that did not need to happen. After his birth I was diagnosed with lupus. I am coping with the disease making sure to take my meds every day. I would love to go back to school and get a teaching credential once my son no longer has therapy. We currently live in Santa Maria, California and are looking forward to the reunion. I need a lot more than 250 words to describe college, however, after the decline of Emerald Dawn and receiving my degree I followed my last name into the skateboard industry where I was a manager for 3 years until they discovered I couldn't skate. During that time I also worked at the Renaissance Faire where I hired my future wife, Reva (an executive pastry chef). We moved to the Santa Clarita Valley north of the dreaded Los Angeles in 1999 and were married in 2001, where Brad Campos heavily enjoyed the open bar. We still reside here until we find a way to escape. I have been working in the film industry as a special effects man, most recently blowing up cars on the TV show Alias, as well as welding and turning on really big fans for both Matrix sequels, The Hunted, and those internet BMW films. I currently have a screenplay going into production early next year, when I hope to get paid for said work. In my spare time I also help run my wife's business, Merci Beaucoup!, a fine cake and pastry company. Discounts for alumni available! In case you were worried, yes I am still a big hockey dork, both playing and coaching as well as assisting at a number of elite hockey clinics. If any of this sounds exciting, you must also remember I live in Los Angeles... help me. Thanks to those of you who are putting in the time and effort to give us all a chance to re-connect after ten years! Tara and I got married in October 2002 in San Diego where we currently live with our cat Raisin. I am working in the Foodservice Industry with Kraft Foods where I am responsible for sales into distribution. Tara is an educator at Grossmont Community College teaching Health and Fitness classes. She has also created her first comprehensive work out video for older adults, (www.Useitorloseit.com) which she is very excited and passionate about. I have enjoyed staying active through surfing and competing in triathlons. After graduating from CAL, I followed in my father's footsteps and accepted a commission into the U.S. Army as a 2nd Lieutenant. Selected to attend flight school, I spent a year at Ft. Rucker, AL. learning how to fly th AH-64 Apache. Since then I've served tours in South Korea, in the 101st Airborne Division at Ft. Campbell, KY., including a 6 month combat tour in Afghanistan in 2002, and am currently stationed at Ft. Bragg, NC. Outside the Army I've turned into a runner and play basketball in local leagues. Wow ten years.... Well I started work at the Marin Humane Society right out of high school. I worked for them for ten years and then a little bundle came into my life. His name is Alexander Joseph \"Xander\" he is ten months old, and a handfull. I have since quit working to be a stay at home as long as possible. I am trying to get my real estate appraisers license. I look forward to seeing everyone!! Since college, it seems that a lot of SMHS alumni have been in the area at one time or another, so I've had a great time catching up with people along the way. Over the last two years I have been living with my fiance, Lynsey Williams (we'll be married in late August), and hanging out with friends and family. Due to my long-time hobby of tracking the elusive Sasquatch, I am usually out of town or on assignment in the Pacific Northwest. But every now and then the beast surfaces in Novato...all interested parties wishing to follow the trail should check with the Viking from time to time for the next sighting...you just never know. Wee! This is fun!... While drinking myself into an oblivian up in the People's Republic of Eugene OR. (Along with former Mustangs Alex \"I hate Cab Drivers\" Hautau and Andrew \"The only president less competent than George W.\" Pridgen) I somehow managed to graduate in four years. Moving back to Novato after College was a great idea! Temping in Marin opened me up to some wonderful career options... Coallating for Mindscape or answering telephones at Broderbund. Realizing that my History degree made me unqualified for these glorious careers I decided to move on. My genetic pre-disposition to alcoholism pointed me to the booze industry. Living in the Haight Ashbury neighborhood and becoming a wine salesman did not present any distractions to my strict religious and spiritual beliefs. Two and a half years of slanging booze in some of San Francisco's classiest establishments (ie. Buddha Lounge, The Horse Cow, The Cinch, and The Power Exchange) took its toll and left! me directionless... So now I am a teacher, and it is probably the best move I have ever made... Looking forward to the Shin-Dig!!! After graduation and the demise of Emerald Dawn, I went to SRJC and then transfered to UC San Diego. Once finished, I moved to San Francisco and found a job as a programmer/analyst for Barra, a financial software and data company in Berkeley. I had a great time in San Francisco; I played lots of music in some of San Francisco's best (or worst depending on who you ask) clubs, spent a bunch of time with my old friends, and made a few new ones too. I wanted to do more interesting work so I am now working on my Ph.D. in plasma physics at Columbia University. I'm in my third of, what I hope to be, five years of study. I live in New York City with my fiance who is presently the locations coordinator for Sex & the City. New York is incredible but I do miss San Francisco. When I finish school I wouldn't be surprised if we ended up back there. Sadly, my present position as a poor student living in an expensive place, affords me very little travel time and money so I won't be able to attend the reunion this time. I hope you are all doing well and maybe I'll see you at the twenty year reunion. After high school, I went to U.C. Berkeley, where I majored in Political Economy. After graduation, I moved to San Francisco and started working in marketing for Franklin Templeton (a mutual fund company in San Mateo). Four years later I decided it was time to venture back to school, so I moved to Brentwood to start my MBA at UCLA, where I had a blast. I graduated this past June, and I'm about to start a job in marketing at Mattel, working on My Scene Barbie (it's pretty much my dream job!). I'm currently living with my boyfriend of two years in Marina Del Rey - we met through business school and he actually just started at Mattel as well! All in all, life is great, and I'm very much looking forward to seeing everyone at the reunion! After graduating, I spent my summers fighting fires and my winters either going to school or skiing (depending on how much money I made the pervious summer). In 1999 I started working for the Marin County Sheriff's Office. After harassing numerous future San Marin grads at the rope swing and a vehicle pursuit with one of our classmates (who will be teleconfrencing the reunion from the Folsom State Prison) I decided I probably ought to go somewhere new. I have been working as a deputy in Napa County for the past year. I am currently the county's search and rescue coordinator. I have been married since 1999 to my beautiful wife Julie. She is a full-time mom raising our two year-old, Hunter. I was home sick for California for about 1 week when I first came to DC. After that I fell in love with this side of the country. I was working for a Public Policy Association while I was in undergrad and they offered me my 1st job after I graduated as Program Manager. I have currently been working at a Community Development Corporation in Southeast, DC for the last 4 years. We construct affordable housing -- renovation and new construction, work with small businesses, nonprofits and residents in the community. It is a good job that has opened up a lot of doors but I wouldn't say this is my career choice. I recently purchased a house in DC and I am attending University of Maryland, School of Public Affairs going for my Masters in Public Management. After SRJC, I started working as an Electronic Technician for Hewlett-Packard in 95. I now work for Agilent Technologies, which split off from HP a few years ago. I have spent the past 10 years losing my hair, damnit! I bought a house in Santa Rosa in 2000 and got married in 2001. My wife and I just had a daughter in April. Her name is Sydney. I still love riding motorcycles and drag racing. I race my heavily modified Mustang at Sears Point every Wednesday. Cheri Sherwood and her husband, John were in the same child birth classes as my wife and I. What a coincidence. Now Cheri, Teresa Nilan, and my wife hang out on Fridays in a mother's group. I really look forward to seeing everyone. Yep, living the starving actor / writer routine. Been in a ridiculous amount of plays, uncountable extra spots on TV shows and movies and even some featured parts as well (soooo close to SAG... sooo close...). As far as money goes I work as a Tour Guide at the Griffith Observatory as well as a Studio Guide at Universal Studios Hollywood. AND, after years trying I finally got a real piece of work published (Star Wars Insider magazine, but STILL!). Living with my wonderful girlfriend Christine and three dogs and a cat. Ain't art grand? After weathering the ignominious ending of the musical ensemble known as Emerald Dawn, much debated within these pages, I repaired to the quiet seclusion of Los Angeles' barrio streets, ostensibly to achieve a degree in the practical transference of auditory phenomena -- sound waves -- to analogue and/or digital tape -- i.e., Recording Arts -- from the University of Southern California. As much as I enjoyed the calming susurrus of gun shots, Doppler shifting sirens, and the piercing ululations of drunken frat-boy hazing, I decided after obtaining my degree to emigrate from the my dirty hole -- read: apartment -- on Figueroa St. and return to the fast paced life of Novato. Pursuing my chosen field of sound recording, however, proved to be a rather daunting task outside of the dazzling neon glamour pit of my beloved City of Angels. Therefore, in 1998, after a brief stint into the world of coffee haute couture, I forsook the music industry to jump on the Dotcom Bubble, hiring on to eventually become a network administrator for an ISP, where I continue to waste away time browsing the Internet and writing run-on sentences -- err, work -- to this day. In July of 2002, I was lucky enough to marry my very lovely wife, Alysse, with whom which I purchased a new home this June. We have had zero children, but have, instead, procured a small hermit crab, which is much quieter. I also lend my talents to a \"rock 'n roll\" band with the unfortunate moniker of Gorilla Math. After graduating from ASU with a degree in English Lit, and an unofficial degree in planning major campus events, like Homecoming and the Spring Festival (it's in my blood I guess), I took a 2-month backpacking trip to Europe. Upon my return I landed my dream job at the Fairmont Hotel in SF. My official title was Small Group Manager, but my \"groups\" included heads-of-state and other high-profile visitors such as President Clinton (no, he was always a perfect gentleman), Gen. Westley Clark, UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan and Elton John - exciting stuff for a Novato girl! It was a terrific experience, but after three years I was in need of a change (and a few free weekends), so I left to become executive assistant at a software firm, also in SF. I work for the CTO and CEO, am learning the inside workings of the corporate world and now have time to squeeze in my other favorite thing - travel! I have been to the Far East, Europe again, and all over the US. I also work a few days a month at a paint-your-own pottery shop - just for fun! I have really enjoyed connecting with old friends while planning this reunion. I can't wait to see you all! Wow, 10 years it is passed by! The phrase \"Growing Old Is Mandatory, Growing Up is a Choice\" really does apply well. I am so proud and glad to see everyone all grown and doing well. As for me, after College of Marin, I worked as medical biller for DME Co. in Ignacio. As much as I love Marin County, unfortunately, I lost my lovely Mom due to stroke in 1998, I decided to move out. I ended up in San Jose. While I'm in San Jose, I became interested in insurance industry. I was managing for insurance broker for 3years. Well, story doesn't stop here. I want to follow where the money is at which is sell. So I went and took the state exam. Here I am an Insurance Agent. After graduating from Cal Lu in 1997, I moved back to Alameda & then to Walnut Creek. I commuted to a SF firm for 5 years and got tired of spending two hours a day on BART & took a position with a firm in Walnut Creek. In the meantime, I got my CPA license & I do mostly audit work & try to stay away from tax (so please don't ask for free advice :)). I'm working on writing a hiking book in my spare time to be published *next* fall. :) Still single - I just got out of a LT relationship.\n\nI'll be out of state Thanksgiving weekend, so maybe I'll catch you all at the next reunion.\n\nAfter graduating from UCSB in '97 I went directly to Santa Clara University for Law School where I spent the next year realizing that I was not Lawyer material. :) Flash forward to 1 year later in a Lindy Hop swing class where I found myself for the first time SPEECHLESS. I had met someone fantastic and resorted to the \"don't talk to the guy you like\" kindergarten tactic. After a couple of weeks he asked me out...and that was it! One year later we were living together. And three years after that we were married. May 17th of this year in fact. I spend my days helping people buy and refinance homes, and have found that my years of shopping experience are put to good use as a \"personal shopper...for money\" (i.e. Mortgage Consultant). First off, I want to say that, to my surprise, this devoted website is actually very cool! I loved reading about what everyone's been up to -- and, seeing the photos (Noah, love the bike).\n\nAs for me, I've been living in Los Angeles for the past 5 years. Right now, I am the director of publicity for the entertainment show \"Extra\" (yes, I too, am tired of Bennifer). After high school, I went to school in Santa Barbara before transferring to San Diego. Since then, I've been having fun and working lots.\n\nLooking forward to seeing everyone. Take care.\n\nFirst off, this is pretty sweet. I feel like I'm getting to know \"me\" again... My job is out in Point Reyes-writing/editing for a [*#*#] small paper and its crappy sister travel mag. From reading these, I'm kind of more into Maddox's life (I tried to go see him at Griffith- but it was closed for an $80 million restoration....) Still hang with the same crew from SM when I'm not tending to my cat, Bella. My wife, Mariah, is from Davis, where she lived/went to school all the way through college. A bunch of you last saw me a few years ago in my \"blue\" period working at Brew Co. I still get good deals on kegs, so I'll see y'all at the ropeswing Friday before the reunion!!! Wow...everybody is getting married, buying houses and having babies!! I look forward to all that someday but for now I have a really incredible boyfriend. It's only been 3 months! (sorry to scare you Richard!) but it's been a really incredible 3 months and I don't know what I did before him! Ok, enough of the mushy stuff... After SRJC for Business, Sonoma State for Liberal Arts, and 6 years of Business Management I quit my secure job to go back to school to follow my dream of Fashion Design. I've dreamed of having my own business since I was 6 and am determined to make that dream a reality soon, very soon. Currently I'm learning buying and production (for fashion design) and have done some freelance design. I'm on track to have my own label within a year or so and I'm just so excited about it!! After pining for the same thing for 22 years it's sooo exciting to see light at the end of the tunnel that your dream WILL come to fruition!! I'm really excited about the reunion! Can't wait to see all of you!! After living in Southern California for the past 7 years, I took the plunge and moved to NYC. So far so good, except I am WAY too far away from the Novato-ens (except Good Ol' Parenti is here to keep me company!) I am living with my boyfriend, Jeremy Peterson, whom I met while first visiting Katie & the Big Apple last February. I am now enjoying this marvelous city & searching for a new career. Prior to living in So Cal, I attended ASU with Jana Clayton & Linda Barden: YIKES! Unfortunately, I won't be able to make the reunion, but I have faith that the stories will make their way across the country in a FLASH! After ten years, the most special thing I have to report is that that my closest friends are the same people I met in Novato ten+ years ago. Will try to keep this short. Went to SRJC (didn't we all?), Graduated from Sonoma State University (adding to the SM total). Working currently in Novato at Portal Publications (across from Burger King on Alameda Del Prado)doing contract/royalty work for ART we publish done by Santana, Anne Geddes, and LIFE magazine. Have a girlfriend Rohan (for you Lord of the Rings fans and not YOKO, JOEL!)of almost 9 years (does common-law exist in California?, better check on this). By the way, my Emerald Dawn shirt lasted nearly 8 years (my girlfriends favorite night shirt)before being ripped off her body in a passionate act of (wait this is supposed to be PG). Russ if you can please bring a new one to the reunion that would be great(you can't have sold them all!). See ya in a week (Look for the tallest guy in the room, if Andre Hall doesn't show up). Amazing that ten years has already passed by, after High School I went to UNR and earned a degree in Engineering. Realizing that I just wasn't ready to enter the corporate world yet, I went to St. Mary's and received my MBA. Since then I've been employed at Merrill Lynch working within the Private Client sector. Over the past two years I've been dating a beautiful, wonderful girl named Diane Raboin (S.M. Class of '94) and still enjoy hanging out with some of my fellow classmates. It sounds like everyone is doing very well and I look forward to seeing all of you next month at the Reunion. Since our reunion quite a bit has changed for the \"Where Am I Now!\" Andy and I were married July 31, 2004 in Sausalito/Tiburon, bringing our wonderful engagement to a close, as well as to the beginning of our new adventure in Arizona. We are making our home in Scottsdale, where Andy can flourish in his professional passion from home, and I can embark on many personal things that inspire my purpose! My years in the city were fun and fabulous, and I am thrilled to be back in the state of my Alma Mater, enjoying friends that remained and of course, the sun. Wishing everyone well, Ashley :) After graduation I started college at Santa Rosa Junior College. Second semester of my Freshman year, I had the opportunity to study abroad in Paris and had an absolute blast! Upon returning from my European adventure I couldn't wait to broaden my horizons! I completed an additional year in Santa Rosa before heading to San Diego where I attended San Diego Sate University. I majored in Communication with an emphasis in New Media studies, with the good intention of getting into the booming computer industry. After graduation I worked for a data sales company and found that cubicle life just wasn't for me, (go figure) and took a jobas a makeup artist (which was great till I realized that cleaning lipsticks and foundation bottles was truly an all day affair!). About four years ago, I woke up and realized that I missed the Bay Area and I moved back home to purse a career in outside sales. I guess you could say, the 'Peer Counselor' in me from high school, and the 'Peer Health Educator' in me from college, got the best of me...and, I now live and work in the East Bay, representing a cardiovascular line of products for a French pharmaceutical company. I am looking forward to catching up with everyone...See you there! After flip-flopping between going to University in Canada and SRJC, I finally finished my English degree at Ohio State. I had no idea that I would end up in Ohio! It's strange where life takes you. I always thought I would be in California forever! I currently work for NetJets, a private aircraft company owned by Warren Buffett. We fly movie stars, athletes, singers, lawyers etc., basically anyone who is weatlthy. I really wish I could attend the reunion, but Thanksgiving is our busiest time of the year, not to mention the fact that it is the most expensive time to travel. I'm also building my first house and I may be closing on it late November or December. I hope everyone has a great time and I hope to see you at the next reunion! Currently I have been working for CIGNA Insurance for the last 3 years. I have worked in the computer field now for almost 8 years total when you add in the time I worked with AEGON. In the 2 years prior to getting into computer work within Florida I did some traveling across the country via Tuscon, AZ and a brief interlude in Texas. I spend my weekends working on fixing peoples computers and also doing skydiving. Unfortunately I will not be able to attend this current reunion due to the time being the same period of time that my office is doing a site move. Those of you attending please make sure to drink a beer for me. My son is the splitting image of a Theisen (those of you who know how my family all looks similar) and is in the orcess of learning to speak and is in the process of potty training. My wife makes sure to pamper him and he is definately not deprived of love. After high-school I attended College of Marin for a while before transferring to Sonoma State University where I recieved my BA in Theatre. This summer we sold our house in Novato and I moved to Charlotte, NC where I was able to buy my own house. I am working in a bookstore while I return to school to get my master's in education. I hope to teach theatre in high-school or college in the next couple of years. Things are going well and I can't wait to catch up with everyone at the reunion! After high school I went to the SRJC for a couple of years, where I met Tim (my then boyfriend) and lucky for me he was transferring to UC Davis and I had just applied to transfer. In 1996 I transferred to UC Davis and in 1997 Tim graduated and bought a house in Sacramento (midtown). I graduated from UC Davis in 1998 and backpacked through Europe for six weeks. When I came home I got a job with a local magazine working as an event coordinator, but in 1999 I accepted a position with Hewlett Packard (in Roseville) and Tim started working for E*Trade. In June 2000 I married my college sweetheart and best friend and in 2002 we bought a brand new house and rented out our other one. Unfortunately I got laid off from HP in June of this year, but it was a blessing in disguise!! I decided I wanted to try to get into Pharmaceutical Sales and 3 months later I accepted an offer and one week ago I started working for GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) as a Pharmaceutical Sales Rep. Now I am very busy with training (a 6 month-1 year process). Tim is still with E*Trade, we love Sacramento and stay busy with work, friends, family and our dog Aspen. It's great to hear from all of you, see you at the reunion. While I was at San Jose State I met my wife Kristi. We have been married a little over 2 years and just had our first child \"Brett\" on 1/24/03. For the last 4 years I have been working for Marina Mortgage where I have made home ownership a reality for people who seem to have way too much personal debt, maxed out credit, and no savings... ahhhh, homeownership in the Bay Area! Other than that my life is pretty simple. Kristi is now a full time mom, my commute is less than a mile and I still play in the occasional \"mens basketball league\". Glad to see everybody is doing well, and I'll look forward to catching up with you guys at the dinner. I am currently living in Eugene Or. where i have been since right after graduating from H.S, spending half my time as a hairstylist and half my time as an educator for Paul Mitchell and I love it. I live with my boyfriend of 4 years, Max. He has an 8 year old son who lives with us part time so that keeps me busy when I am not working. I love living in Oregon and can't imagine my life any other way. Unfortunately i will not be able to make it to the reunion as we are spending the holiday in Colorado..Hope everyone has fun and see you at the next one..."
