        "text": "Susan Ann Hayes All too soon an amazing life came to an end on August 30, 2012 when our beloved friend and family member, Susan Hayes, went home. A chaplain and volunteer with the Novato Police Department, hypnotherapist and counselor, cat and animal lover, and devoted and beloved friend, throughout her life and her career in the fledgling software industry Susan overcame seemingly insurmountable obstacles with style, grace, wit, creativity and heart. Susan Ann Hayes was born on October 29, 1948 in Wellington, Ohio She graduated from Van Nuys High School in 1967, and then studied Criminal Justice at Los Angeles Valley College. In 1980 she became the first employee hired by a pioneering personal computer software publisher, The Software Toolworks (later renamed Mindscape), and remained with the company for 20 years, variously managing technical support, security and telecommunications, and moving with it from Los Angeles to Novato in 1990. In 2000, Susan began a new career as a hypnotherapist and counselor, offering her uniquely inspiring ideas and compassion to her clients. She fulfilled a lifelong interest in law enforcement in 2002 by becoming a Chaplain at the Novato Police Department, where she volunteered until her death and was a constant, calming presence. Her creative interests included scrapbooking, photography, genealogy, taking field trips with friends and continuing her long interest in writing. She loved animals, particularly cats. She was mother to a long succession of them, ranging from strays to a show champion, and her license plate read ME4CATS. Susan was always a fighter. She coped with a lifelong succession of serious medical conditions with grace, style, calm and an incomparable humor, and kept going energetically, less physically in the last few years but always personally and spiritually. There will never be enough or the right words to express how much Susan brought into each life she entered. Her presence enhanced the life of everyone she touched. She is survived by her sister, Patricia, her kitty, Mr. Fred and many friends whose lives are richer, fuller and blessed for knowing her. A memorial service will be held on October 4, 2012 at 11:00 AM at Valley Memorial Park in Novato, California. A reception will follow at the Novato Police Department, 909 Machin, Novato. In lieu of flowers please consider a donation to Marin Cat Connection or Pennies for Police Dogs."
