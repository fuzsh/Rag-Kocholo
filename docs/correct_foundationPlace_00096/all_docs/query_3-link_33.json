        "text": "Additional scholarship opportunities and resources\n\nDU Foundation Scholarships\n\nDavenport University awards scholarships funded by private donations to the Davenport University Foundation. These scholarships are awarded based on campus location you attend and/or special requirements established by the donors.\n\nYou are invited to apply, and we hope you will. Once you've submitted the application and you meet the criteria, you will be considered for our Davenport University Foundation scholarships. If you are selected to receive one of our Davenport University Foundation awards, we will notify you!\n\nApplications will be accepted throughout the academic year; however, scholarships are awarded on a first-come, first-served basis to students enrolled half-time or more. Continuing students must have a minimum CGPA of 2.8. Primary consideration will be given to the earliest applicants meeting the scholarship criteria.\n\nInstructions\n\nComplete the FAFSA if you have not yet done so (DU FAFSA code: 002249). Data from the FAFSA is used in the awarding process for various scholarships.\n\nSubmit your online foundation application\n\nMake sure you read each question carefully and complete all areas of the application.\n\nCompleting this application does not guarantee scholarship funds.\n\nSome of the Foundation Scholarships require essays. To see the essay requirements and how to apply click here.\n\nDU's Diversity, Equity and Inclusion Scholarships\n\nFor incoming freshmen:\n\nMLK Inherit the Dream Scholarship\n\nSí Se Puede César E. Chávez Scholarship\n\nFor current students:\n\nRev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Essay Contest - $750 Scholarship\n\nOutside and Community Scholarships\n\nDavenport University has pulled together a list of outside and community scholarships. The scholarships are listed as categorical and general scholarships. To see what you may qualify for visit davenport.edu/financial-aid/scholarships/outside\n\nScholarship Search Engines\n\nThere are many scholarship search engines available for students to use. These search engines can pinpoint scholarships based on your particular major, interests, where you live and other demographics. The links provided are some of the most popular and useful search engines.\n\nFinaid\n\nFastweb\n\nCappex\n\nScholarships.com\n\nCollegeBoard\n\nComputerscience.org\n\nHelpful hints for online searches\n\nDo not pay for a scholarship search. The search options Davenport lists are free searches; however, we encourage students and parents to read carefully all the information.\n\nDo not pay to apply for a scholarship. Do not pay for any kind of \"processing\" fee. Scholarships offered from legitimate sources do not require any fees.\n\nSet up a separate email account through yahoo, google, hotmail or some other service. Use this separate email just for your scholarship searches. Some scholarship searches do send out advertisements, and using an email account separate from your personal account will better protect your personal account from unwanted emails.\n\nResearch scholarships beyond just what the search engines provide.\n\nBe very careful about providing confidential information. You should never have to submit your social security number or anything similar to that. If in doubt, contact your Davenport financial aid counselor.\n\nUnderstanding Your Scholarship\n\nDavenport University provides institutional funding for student scholarships based on several factors that include but are not limited to the following: merit, financial need and/or other published scholarship criteria.\n\nKeeping Your Scholarship\n\nALL SCHOLARSHIPS MUST MEET THE FOLLOWING CRITERIA:\n\nStudent must file a FAFSA (excluding international students).\n\nStudent must meet specific criteria and deadline dates as required for each scholarship. Scholarships have limited funds; therefore, early application to the university is encouraged.\n\nStudent must provide the University with all requested information before the scholarship can be awarded.\n\nScholarships are awarded for the current semester going forward. We do not retroactively award scholarships.\n\nStudent must maintain satisfactory academic progress.\n\nStudent must demonstrate the academic excellence goals of Davenport University by meeting minimum CGPA as specified by the criteria of the scholarships.\n\nStudent who fails to meet a required CGPA to maintain a scholarship, but meets the requirements of a different scholarship, will receive that new scholarship. Student who has extenuating circumstances can appeal to the Financial Aid Office.\n\nStudent must be enrolled in classes at least half-time (minimum of 6 credit hours) except for the Study Abroad Scholarships.\n\nThe award year for scholarships is defined as fall and winter semesters. Any unused funds for the award year may be used spring/summer (not to exceed the per semester maximum).\n\nStudent must begin using the scholarship within the award year of selection.\n\nStudent can receive only one DU academic scholarship within the award year. If a student qualifies for multiple scholarships, the student will receive the most beneficial scholarship.\n\nStudents who are eligible for both a DU institutional scholarship and a tuition discount due to a Davenport partnership agreement will receive the more beneficial program.\n\nScholarships will cover up to tuition, fees and books after all federal and state aid (excluding student loans and work study) has been applied. External scholarships (Ex: Rotary Clubs, churches, etc.) can be used to cover other University costs such as books or food and housing, but will not result in a refund to the student."
