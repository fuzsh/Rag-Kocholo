Below are some pictures of the Porsche 911 GT1 driven by Allan McNish, Laurent Aiello, and Stephane Ortelli that won the 24 Hours of Le Mans in 1998. The kit is by Scale Productions, long out of production and built out of the box. Paint is House of Kolor white basecoat with an Omni urethane clear coat over the decals. Overall the kit was an easy build with the biggest challenge being the decals.
