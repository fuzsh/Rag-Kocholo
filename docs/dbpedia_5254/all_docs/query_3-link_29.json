        "text": "How the Porsche 911 GT1 Evo supercar came to be\n\nHomologation. It's the racing rule that results in some of the world's greatest road cars. To race, many cars have to be homologated, which means they have to have a number of street-legal counterparts to prove they're part of a brand's production line. Sitting high on this list of all-time...\n\nJeff Glucker July 3, 2018\n\nTake a ride in the Porsche 911 GT1 down a public street\n\nThere's something sublime about seeing a race car on the street. It's like catching a glimpse of a coyote in downtown Los Angeles or an XR400 in a lecture hall. There's something perfectly insubordinate about it. You may know the Porsche 911 GT1 as the the car that Porsche raced at Le Mans in the...\n\nZach Bowman May 10, 2017\n\nStreet-legal Porsche 911 GT1 Evo racer sells for $3.14 million\n\nOne lucky enthusiast now has a very special Porsche among his or her collection. This is the only Porsche 911 GT1 race car to be converted for street use, and it was just sold at an RM Sotheby's auction in Monaco for €2.77 million (approximately $3.14 million). Handling the conversion was...\n\nViknesh Vijayenthiran May 16, 2016\n\nOnly road-legal Porsche 911 GT1 Evo race car up for auction\n\nYou're looking at the one and only road-legal example of Porsche's 911 GT1 Evolution race car. And you can buy it, if you're the lucky top bidder at RM Sotheby's upcoming auction in Monaco. What's that, you say? Yes, Porsche did build a road-going version of the GT1 called the Strassenversion, and...\n\nAndrew Ganz March 9, 2016\n\nPorsche is back in the top tier of Le Mans racing this year, but the company has a rich history in the series, not the least of which involves a limited run of cars in the late 1990s as homologation specials, including the 911 GT1 Evo Strassenversion. The street-going version of the 911 GT1 race car, the Strassenversion--or, more properly, the Straßenversion--is just barely road-legal. It's a mid-engined, 592-horsepower, 2,530-pound (dry weight) race car for the road. And now one of the 20 1998 GT1 Evo homologation cars built is up for sale, chassis #6010. MUST SEE: Trion Nemesis...\n\nLast Porsche 911 GT1 Straßenversion built turns up for sale\n\nIf you’re looking for an exotic, limited-production supercar from a mainstream manufacturer, it doesn’t get much more exclusive than one of 20 built. To homologate its 911 GT1 for FIA competition, Porsche was supposed to build 25 road-going examples, called Strassenversion, and the 20...\n\nKurt Ernst July 31, 2012\n\nPorsche 911 GT1 Straßenversion up for sale\n\nWhen it comes to rare Porsches of the modern-era, few are as hard to come by as the Porsche 911 GT1 Straßenversion (street version). However, one of these rare beauties is now up for sale in Kyoto, Japan, and if you’re interested, it will set you back a cool $1.7 million. The particular...\n\nViknesh Vijayenthiran July 20, 2011"
