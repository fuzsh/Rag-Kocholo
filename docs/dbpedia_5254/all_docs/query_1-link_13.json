        "text": "Broad Arrow Auctions recently announced it will offer the 1997 Porsche 911 GT1 Rennversion at its upcoming Monterey Auction, August 14-15. Chassis 993-GT1-108 is one of just nine customer GT1s originally made and notably is offered directly from long-term private ownership where it has been in the hands of an esteemed Porsche collector for some time. Also of note is that it was never severely damaged or dismantled and today remains in superbly presented condition.\n\nJakob Greisen, Senior Car Specialist for Broad Arrow Auctions states, “We are thrilled to have been entrusted with the sale of this spectacular part of Porsche history, offered from one of the best curated private Porsche collections in the world.\n\n“This particular GT1 is an incredibly impressive example, not just because of its successful race history but also because it has lived a life mostly spared from serious damage or drama and it remains in exceptional overall condition. Impressively, the GT1 was collectible on day one of its life, and today, that remains even more so the case.”\n\nFirst campaigned by the highly successful German Roock Racing Team as their lead car in the 1997 FIA GT Championship it was then raced at the 1997 Le Mans 24 Hours by Le Mans winners Allan McNish and Stéphane Ortelli alongside former Formula One driver Karl Wendlinger. Following which it had an impressive 1997 U.S. PSCR season with Rohr Racing winning the IMSA GTS-1 class championship with four race wins in the hands of McNish and Andy Pilgrim among others. Formerly of The Drendel Collection, today it is offered from a prominent, world-class Porsche collector.\n\nOther notable Porsche variants consigned for this year’s auction include;\n\n1998 RUF CTR II, estimated at $2,200,000 – $2,500,000 1964 Porsche Carrera 904 GTS, estimated at $2,200,000 – $2,500,000 1988 Porsche 959 Komfort, estimated at $1,800,000 – $2,200,000 1998 RUF Turbo R Limited, estimated at $1,500,000 – $2,000,000 1995 Porsche 911 GT2, estimated at $1,300,000 – $1,600,000 1973 Porsche 911 Carrera RS 2.7 Lightweight, estimated at $1,250,000 – $1,500,000 2005 Porsche Carrera GT, estimated at $1,100,000 – $1,300,000 2021 RUF RT 12 R, estimated at $800,000 – $1,000,000 1989 Porsche 911 Turbo Slantnose Cabriolet, estimated at $350,000 – $400,000 2024 Porsche 911 Dakar, estimated at $350,000 – $400,000"
