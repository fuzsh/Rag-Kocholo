        "text": "TRAVERSE CITY, Mich., February 21, 2024 – The Amelia, known by its longtime attendees and fans as “the racers’ concours,” will display hundreds of the greatest-ever road and racing machines as it welcomes guests to its 29th annual event. The four-day gathering takes place from Thursday, February 29 to Sunday, March 3, 2024. Among cars on display are race winning examples, movie heroes, supercars and vehicles replete with history. Significantly, Sunday’s Amelia Concours d’Elegance will feature 275 cars representing the best-of-the-best from automotive history.\n\nBuilding to concours Sunday, a display of 375 cars at the Saturday, March 2nd Cars and Community will include an expanded RADwood display featuring an additional 250 cars from the trend-setting 1980s and 1990s. A special class of the hottest cars from 1984 will be on display at RADwood as part of the brand’s year-long celebration of Hagerty’s 40th anniversary. Additional activities and experiences celebrating Hagerty’s four decades serving the enthusiast community are planned throughout, including a new ad campaign and anniversary-focused Marketplace online auction.\n\n“History gathers on the lawns of The Amelia and you’re sure to learn something new or find an all-new car you’ve never heard of before,” said Matt Orendac, Concours Vice Chairman. “With so much to absorb, the reading you do before and after The Amelia can be as much fun as seeing and hearing the cars themselves. These are just a few of the cars you’ll see, but there are still plenty of surprises left.”\n\n1998 Porsche 911 GT1\n\nDriven by Allan McNish, Laurent Aïello and Stéphane Ortelli, this Porsche 911 GT1 took the overall victory at the 24 Hours of Le Mans in 1998. This marked the 16th time the famed German marque had taken the top prize at the race and the last time GT1 cars would compete in the race. This car, built as a 911 GT1-98 variant, is one of just 5 examples produced and is the actual car that took the checkered flag at Le Mans in 1998. The Porsche 911-GT1 will be displayed at RADwood and again at The Amelia on Sunday. It is joining The Amelia this year thanks to Mobil 1 who is celebrating their 50th anniversary. Fast fact: no other road legal car has won Le Mans since the GT1.\n\n1962 Ferrari 250 GTO\n\nThe Ferrari 250 GTO is known for its beauty, performance and racing pedigree and this example checks all those boxes. Finished is silver metallic paint and featuring a central French Tricolore stripe, this Ferrari finished 2nd in class at the 24 Hours of Le Mans in 1963 and 1st overall at the Tour de France the next year. You’ll be able to see this Ferrari 250 GTO at the Sunday Concours as part of the “Ferrari 250 Competition Cars” class.\n\n1971 Porsche 911T\n\nThis 911T was purchased new by Bill Warner, founder and Chairman Emeritus of The Amelia, and turned into the ultimate 911. After participation in the 1975 Cannonball Run, Warner had the engine increased to 2.7-liter Carrera specs. Other modifications include the wheels from the Peter Gregg 2.5-liter car and deck lid from the George Drolsom Carrera, making it a time capsul of some of the greatest Porsches in history.\n\n1965 Shelby Cobra 427 Competition\n\nOne of just 19 competition variants of the 427 Cobra, CSX3019 has an extensive race history including appearances at the Targa Florio, Spa, Silverstone, the Nürburgring and the 24 Hours of Le Mans in era. Fresh off an extensive restoration, this Cobra will appear at The Amelia in the class “Race Cars Post-War: 1956-1965.”\n\n2020 Bugatti Divo\n\nBugatti is known for creating the fastest and most refined hypercars in the world, and this Bugatti Divo is no exception. The 8-liter, quad turbo, W16 engine produces 1,500 horsepower good for a top speed of 236 mph. The Bugatti Divo is the more aggressive and focused version of the Bugatti Chiron, as such, it is said to have bested the time of its sibling on the Nardo Ring by eight seconds and produces over a half-ton of downforce at top speed. This Bugatti Divo will be on display in the class “Supercars: 2000 – Present.”\n\n2017 Pagani Huayra BC\n\nThis highly optioned Pagani Huayra is one of just 20 “BC” variants, named in honor of loyal Pagani customer Benny Caiola, the first person to buy a Pagani automobile. The BC builds on the already impressive Huayra by increasing power and decreasing weight making for the ultimate road going driving experience money can buy. The 2017 Pagani Huayra BC will be displayed as part of the class “Supercars: 2000 – Present.”\n\n1989 RUF CTR ‘Yellowbird’\n\nOnce the world’s fastest production car, the iconic ‘Yellowbird’ will join us at The Amelia in entirely original condition. Capable of an astonishing 211 mph in 1989, the CTR beat the likes of Ferrari and Lamborghini in an all-out speed contest. While it may resemble a Porsche 911, RUF is entirely its own manufacturer and the CTR was their top-of-the-line model in 1989. The CTR will participate as part of the special class dedicated to RUF.\n\n1996 Ferrari F50\n\nThe F50 was the flagship supercar built by Ferrari in the mid-’90s. Its Formula 1 derived V12 engine set it apart from its predecessors, the F40 and 288 GTO, while production was limited making it one of the rarest of Ferraris flagship supercars. This F50 was one of just 4 that were delivered new to South Africa and remains in remarkable condition. The F50 will be on display in the class “Supercars: 1980 – 1999.”\n\n1990 Chevrolet Lumina – NASCAR\n\nA chance meeting between Rick Hendrick, Paul Newman and a young Tom Cruise led to the iconic film Days of Thunder and the creation of this special car. Loosely based on the founding of Hendrick Motorsports and inspired by the likes of Hendrick himself, Harry Hyde, Tim Richmond, Geoff Bodine, Dale Earnhardt and others, the movie debuted in June 1990 to box office success. Hendrick Motorsports provided the stories and the mountain of cars necessary for filming an action flick – including this very No. 46 City Chevrolet Lumina driven by Tom Cruise.\n\n1938 Bugatti Type 57\n\nAmong an exceptional class celebrating the Bugatti Type 57 will be a 3-position convertible with coachwork by Letourner & Marchand. Delivered new to Jean Louis DuMontant in Vermorel, France, the car is as elegant as it is sporty. After decades of French ownership, the Type 57 was purchased by an American enthusiat who raced and won with the car at events in California. Attending The Amelia following a recent restoration, this Type 57 is one of several which will be on display, each with their own story to tell.\n\nThese and hundreds more world-class road and racing cars will be displayed as part of The Amelia festivities February 29 to March 3. As with any live motoring event, attending vehicles are subject to change. For more information and to purchase tickets, visit AmeliaConcours.com.\n\nAbout Hagerty, Inc.
