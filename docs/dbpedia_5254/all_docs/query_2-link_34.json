        "text": "Porsche is back in the top tier of Le Mans racing this year, but the company has a rich history in the series, not the least of which involves a limited run of cars in the late 1990s as homologation specials, including the 911 GT1 Evo Strassenversion.\n\nThe street-going version of the 911 GT1 race car, the Strassenversion--or, more properly, the Straßenversion--is just barely road-legal. It's a mid-engined, 592-horsepower, 2,530-pound (dry weight) race car for the road. And now one of the 20 1998 GT1 Evo homologation cars built is up for sale, chassis #6010.\n\nMUST SEE: Trion Nemesis Promises 2,000 HP, 'Predator Mode': American Vaporware\n\nA twin-turbo 3.2-liter flat-six engine mated to a six-speed H-pattern gearbox, brilliant yellow paint, full leather interior (with Recaro racing seats), carbon disc brakes, and a rich winning history at Le Mans also come with the car. According to the seller, this is thought to be the only yellow example built.\n\nAs rare as the road-going 911 GT1s are, they do come up for sale occasionally, including a silver example in 2012 and a white one in 2011. The car sold in 2012 was listed at $2,325,000; in 2011 the white car listed at $1,700,000.\n\nThere's no price listed on this yellow example, but you can find more details and images of the car at the official sale listing on Trofeo Cars.\n\n_______________________________________"
