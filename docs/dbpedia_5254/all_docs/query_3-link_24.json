        "text": "Porsche 911 GT1[]\n\nHistory[]\n\nWith the revival of international sportscar racing in the mid-1990s through the BPR Global GT Series (which then morphed into the FIA GT Championship) Porsche expressed interest in returning to top-level sportscar racing and went about developing its competitor for the GT1 category. Cars in this category were previously heavily modified versions of road cars, such as the McLaren F1 and the Ferrari F40. Porsche originally modified the 993 GT2 into EVO version and homologated it as a GT1,[4] but it was completely uncompetitive compared to the supercars in its class.\n\n911 GT1[]\n\nIn spite of its 911 moniker, the car actually had very little in common with the 911 of the time, only sharing the front and rear headlamps with the production sports car. However, its frontal chassis is based on the 993-generation 911, while the rear subframe was derived from the 962C[5] along with its water-cooled, twin-turbocharged and intercooled, 4 valves per cylinder 3,164 cc (3.2 L) flat-six engine fuel fed by Bosch Motronic 5.2 fuel injection, which was longitudinally-mounted in a rear mid-engine, rear-wheel-drive layout, compared to the rear-engine, rear-wheel-drive layout of a conventional 911. The engine generated a power output of about 600 PS (441 kW; 592 hp). In comparison, the 993 generation 911 GT2, which was otherwise the company's highest-performance vehicle at the time, used an air-cooled engine with only two valves per cylinder.\n\nThe 911 GT1 made its debut in the BPR Global GT Series (the FIA championship's predecessor) at the Brands Hatch 4 hours, where Hans-Joachim Stuck and Thierry Boutsen won comfortably, although they were racing as an invited entry and were thus ineligible for points. They followed up by winning at Spa and Ralf Kelleners and Emmanuel Collard triumphed for the factory team at Zhuhai.\n\nThe 1996 911 GT1 clocked at a top speed of exactly 330 km/h (205 mph) on the legendary Mulsanne Straight in the practice sessions of the 1996 Le Mans 24 Hours Race.\n\n1999[]\n\nWith Mercedes dominating FIA GT1 in 1998, all other entries including Porsche withdrew for the 1999 season. The GT1 class was cancelled, and the FIA GT Championship was contested with GT2 cars. Porsche could have entered at Le Mans, but chose not to try to defend the win of 1998 against the new entrants from other manufacturers.\n\nChampion Racing brought a 911 GT1 Evo to America to race in the American Le Mans Series, but was only allowed to do so as an LMP (Le Mans Prototypes) class entry, where it proved uncompetitive against actual prototypes such as the BMW V12 LMR.\n\nGunnar G-99[]\n\nFollowing Champion's purchase of a 911 GT1 Evo for 1999, Gunnar Racing offered a custom race car to the team with intentions to race in 2000. The car, known as the Gunnar G-99, was a custom-built 911 GT1 with an open cockpit. The chassis was made from scratch yet remained nearly identical to the 911 GT1 mechanically, even using the bulk of the body parts. A large rollbar was put over the open cockpit to help protect the driver. A 3.6-litre flat-6, from a Porsche 911 GT3, was used in place of the standard 911 GT1 unit.\n\nHowever, Champion would instead turn to buy a Lola B2K/10, so the Gunnar G-99 was temporarily abandoned. The car would resurface in the Rolex Sports Car Series in 2002, yet would not be allowed to race until it had a roof again. Therefore, Gunnar Racing[7] rebuilt the car with a near-identical GT1 roof, and briefly competed in 2003. The car would take a best finish of second in class twice before being retired due to lack of funding and due to the ban on SRP cars in favour of Daytona Prototypes.\n\nSynopsis[]\n\nThe successor to the Porsche 959, the 911 GT1 Strassenversion - German for road version - was designed to homologate the Porsche 911 GT1-98 racing car of which 20 units were built. It received a successor in 2003, the Porsche Carrera GT.\n\nThe 911 GT1 Strassenversion was developed from the 911 GT1-98 race car, with headlights derived from the 996-codenamed Porsche 911. Two other 911 GT1 Strassenversions, one delivered in early 1996 to the German government for compliance testing and another delivered to Bahrain-based private collector Khalid Abdul Rahim, use headlights from the 993-codenamed Porsche 911 instead.\n\nDetuned to meet European emissions laws, the 3.2L flat-6 engine, equipped with twin turbochargers, made 536 hp (400 kW) and 443 ft·lb (600 N·m) at 7,200 rpm, which proved to be more than adequate for the car. Power was sent to the rear wheels via a six-speed manual gearbox.\n\nTrivia[]\n\nUnlike other 911's, the GT1's engine is not placed in the rear due to rear engine placement not suitable for prototype GT racing."
