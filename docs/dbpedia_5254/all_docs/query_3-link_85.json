        "text": "I was going to write a long essay about my time in the passenger seat of Mark Sumpter’s awesome Porsche 911 GT1 Evo however, words really do not do this monster of a race car justice.\n\nI’m no stranger to the brutality of racing cars however, nothing could have prepared me for being strapped into to the 650bhp mid-engined 911 that was the subject of my first Total 911 feature back in issue 106.\n\nThe late Nineties GT1 era was what got me interested in sports car racing so to experience one of the icons from that period was just awesome. The first big hit of those carbon brakes into Brooklands was stunning, as was the grip through the famous Maggots-Becketts complex.\n\nIf you want to read all about Sumpter’s ex-Bob Wollek machine, pick up a copy of issue 106 from the Imagine Shop, or download it from Great Digital Mags. But, for now, please just sit back, turn the volume right up so you can hear the wastegates chatter, and enjoy this awesome car in high definition.\n\nOh, and if you enjoyed it as much as we did, make sure you share this video with your friends."
