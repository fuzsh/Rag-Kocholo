        "text": "Over the winter of 1996–1997, the Porsche racing department further developed the works GT1 for the 1997 Le Mans effort. Dubbed the GT1 Evo, the new model was a considerable improvement over the original and was immediately distinguished by its redesigned bodywork, complete with the “teardrop” headlamps which previewed the all-new generation of the (996) production 911 – unveiled in 1997.\n\nBeneath the bodywork, the front end of the car was revised including new aero and an optimised front suspension with widened track. These measures all resulted in improved significantly improved handling and lap-times.\n\nThis car\n\nManufactured by Porsche Motorsport and delivered new on 24th April 1997 to Messrs. FINLIGA S.A. and run by Konrad Motorsports (Germany). The car first appeared with Konrad Motorsports in GT1-96 spec (993 headlamps) running during the first half of the 1997 World FIA GT Championship, wearing Green-Blue Giesse / Warsteiner livery:\n\n‍1997 World FIA GT Championship\n\n• Le Mans Pre-qualifications\n\n• Silverstone\n\n• Helsinki\n\n• Nürburgring\n\n• Le Mans 24 hours\n\n• Spa\n\nIn August 1997, GT1-109 was one of two customer GT1 cars sent back to Weissach for Porsche Motorsport to convert to 1997 Evo specification –\n\nUpon completion the car was sold to JB Racing (France) for the remainder of the 1997 season. JB Racing already had a lucrative Marlboro sponsorship deal for their GT1-96 chassis 101 and upgraded cars mid-season to the newly converted GT1-109 Evo, running it in Marlboro livery for the remainder 97 FIA GT season:\n\n• Mugello\n\n• Laguna Seca\n\n• Sebring 12 hr\n\nFor the 1998 season the car was then acquired by Labre Competition (France) and re-liveried with new sponsorship from Sony Playstation.
