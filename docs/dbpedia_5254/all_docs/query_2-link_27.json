        "text": "If you’re looking for an exotic, limited-production supercar from a mainstream manufacturer, it doesn’t get much more exclusive than one of 20 built. To homologate its 911 GT1 for FIA competition, Porsche was supposed to build 25 road-going examples, called Strassenversion, and the 20 completed remain among the most desirable of modern Porsches.\n\nSlightly detuned for emission compliance, the 911 GT1 Strassenversion still produced some 537 horsepower from its 3.2-liter flat-six engine. Given the car’s dry weight of just 2,535 pounds, that was enough thrust to propel the car from 0-62 mph in only 3.9 seconds, on its way to a top speed of 191 miles per hour.\n\nThe road-going version also came with a more compliant suspension and a taller ride height, as well as gear ratios better suited to street than track. Steel rotors replaced the carbon ceramic rotors used on GT1s built for competition, and Strassenversion cars came with a carpeted interior, sport seats and a full dashboard.\n\nWhile prices have varied over the years, the rarity of the GT1 Strassenversion cars ensures that their value remains high. If you’re currently in the market for one, a duPont Registry seller (found on TeamSpeed) is offering the last GT1 Strassenversion car built for $2,325,000.\n\nWith only 4,900 kilometers (3,045 miles) since new, the car has recently been serviced by Porsche and is listed in “museum condition.” The price likely reflects the car’s last-built status, which will surely add to its value as a collector car in the future.\n\n_______________________________________"
