        "text": "Since 1964, Porsche has perfectly mastered the art of serving a broad range of customers ranging from those who simply love driving to ambitious sports pilots with the 911 model series. Technology transfer from motor racing to series production (and vice-versa) forms a firm part of the Porsche philosophy which is held in high regard by sports car drivers around the globe. No wonder, because the 911 is not only the world’s most frequently built racing car but also currently the most successful GT racing car ever.\n\nThe Italian term “Gran Turismo” – shortened to GT – denotes a traditional motor sport category. GT translates as “grand touring”, because relatively comfortable, enclosed two-seater sports cars built for endurance races were originally registered according to the GT regulations. Due to the technical proximity to series production, Porsche exploited GT motor racing as a proving ground for production development at a relatively early stage. The type 356 A 1500 GS Carrera GT from 1957 was the first Porsche sports car to bear the characteristic letters that were soon destined to become a huge sensation on race tracks worldwide. Other outstanding Porsche GT vehicles included the Porsche 356 B 1600 GS Carrera GTL Abarth and the 904 Carrera GTS, for instance.\n\nIn the mid-90s, the supreme motor racing body (FIA) once again reshuffled the various racing categories. Besides the top-performance GT1 class, GT2 and GT3 classes have also been in existence since then. For Porsche, the GT2 class increasingly became the Zuffenhausen racing cars’ main area of commitment thanks to its near-production regulations. By building GT racing cars such as the GT3 RSR, GT3 R, GT3 R Hybrid and the GT 3 Cup, Porsche has to this day continued the tradition of offering its customers vehicles with which they can successfully compete in motor racing around the world. In addition to numerous races under the FIA umbrella, Porsche customers from all corners of the globe also use their near-production racing cars in the Porsche brand trophies.\n\nAt Porsche, the close relationship between motor sport and series production has resulted time and again in the construction of road-legal homologation models which thrill with their uncompromising sportiness. Latter-day 911 models containing the letters “GT” in their name, the 911 GT3, 911 GT3 RS or GT2 RS, are uncompromisingly sporty production vehicles oriented closely to motor racing thanks to their outstanding power-to-weight ratio, high agility and extraordinary efficiency.\n\nCompletely in keeping with Porsche Intelligent Performance, they are continuing a success story which began with the legendary 911 Carrera RS back in the early 70s.\n\nPremier Sportscar Service is the industry leader in creating winners with all Porsche 911 GT models. There is no one is the business better suited to service, modify or build a champion race car with your Porsche GT.
