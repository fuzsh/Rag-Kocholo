        "text": "It wasn’t his acting skills, but his driving skills that earned Michael Douglas his first on-camera role.\n\nAs a young man visiting his famous father on location in Israel, Douglas was tapped to drive a Jeep in 1966’s “Cast a Giant Shadow.”\n\n“I was a pretty good driver and hit my mark,” he said. “So that was the extent of my first (appearance) on screen.”\n\nDouglas, 64, has gone on to star in or produce more than three dozen films over his 40-year career. He was honored for his work this month with the American Film Institute’s Life Achievement Award, being broadcast multiple times on TV Land.\n\nThe Academy Award winner sat down with The Associated Press to reflect on the most memorable movies and moments of his career.\n\n“Hail Hero,” 1969: “(This) could have been the beginning and the end of my career. I played a radical college student who was going off to Vietnam and the picture required me to have long hair and my father, (played by) Arthur Kennedy, cut it off. So we had to get a wig because of the continuity of the movie so I could shoot different things. So we worked on the wig and I put the wig on and I looked in the mirror and I looked just like Veronica Lake.”\n\n“The China Syndrome,” 1979: “Ten days after the movie opened, Three Mile Island happened. One of the other phenomenons besides that coincidence was in the movie, where we describe what the China Syndrome is, the character in the movie says it would destroy an area the size of Pennsylvania, and Three Mile Island was in Harrisburg, Pa. … It was a real epiphany for me and I thought somebody was trying to tell me something. That, on a personal note, began my whole quest in the area of nuclear disarmament, elimination of nuclear weapons. … It really made a lifelong pursuit for me in that area.”\n\n“Romancing the Stone,” 1984: “It was really a lot of heavy, heavy-lifting producing work. Danny DeVito, my oldest buddy — he and I roomed together in New York City early on in our career — and Kathleen Turner. I will always be indebted to her because I can’t think of any other actress who would put up with the production issues that we had. She was fantastic. And we pulled it off. It looks effortless, and it looks fun, but it was a tough picture. But we all like tequila, and that helped.”\n\n“Fatal Attraction,” 1987: “The pitch on ‘Fatal Attraction’ was so simple: A married man has an affair with a wacko who basically takes after his marriage … That was sort of the start, maybe a little earlier, the start of me playing these not particularly popular (or) nice characters and winning audiences over. Where basically you start off as an adulterer, and ultimately the audience is rooting for you. I don’t quite know where I got this sort of enjoyment, I think it’s a little bit about risk-taking with your performances — playing parts that are initially in a gray area, you can’t say they’re really good guys, but then you eventually, hopefully, win the audiences over to your side.”\n\n“Wall Street,” 1987: “Gordon Gekko is a great old-fashioned villain. Interestingly enough, if you look at most actor’s careers, their biggest achievement — not necessarily success — is playing bad guys.”\n\n“Basic Instinct,” 1992: “I was looking to do a slam-dance. I wanted to just let ‘er rip. Paul Verhoeven is such a wonderful director. … Well-structured, really, really good filmmaking. Star-making role for Sharon, she was wonderful in it; Jeanne Tripplehorn, and a good thriller. Great score.”\n\n“Falling Down,” 1993: “It was right after the end of the Cold War, the fall of Communism, the Berlin Wall came down. There was a time in Los Angeles when defense contracting was the biggest business in town, not movies. There were a lot of major defense contractors here. And the wall came down, and a lot of guys were given pink slips and told thank you for their work, good patriots. … It was just a great setup of this guy walking across L.A. and giving a story with that kind of hostility and dark humor.”\n\n“Wonder Boys,” 2000: “Curtis Hanson, great script, Robert Downey Jr., Tobey Maguire, lovely, lovely cast, Frances McDormand. It was maybe just a little too odd, kind of in that niche people just didn’t pick up. It’s hard these days. Everything’s geared on that first weekend because of the marketing costs and everything. It used to be that a movie could hang in there and find its legs and keep on going. It’s much more difficult now. It’s hit or miss.”\n\nTV Show\n\nWHAT: “TV Land Prime Presents The AFI Lifetime Achievement Award”\n\nWHEN: 8 a.m. today\n\nWHERE: TV Land\n\nOriginally Published: July 21, 2009 at 4:48 p.m."
