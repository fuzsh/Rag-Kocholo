        "text": "After a riveting conversation about American politics, no one on The View was expecting Michael Douglas to drop some hot gossip about his sex life with his wife Catherine Zeta-Jones.\n\nDouglas, who appeared on the daytime talk show to promote his new America’s Burning documentary, sent the co-hosts into hysterics while chatting about his and Zeta-Jones’ competitive nature — especially when it comes to golf.\n\n“What does she make you do when you lose to her?” Alyssa Farah Griffin asked, to which Douglas cheekily replied, “Whip it out.”\n\nSara Haines immediately covered her face in shock, while a laughing Griffin threw her hands up in the air.\n\n“She says, ‘You got to whip it out. Drop the trou and whip it out,'” Douglas added, while Griffin chimed in, “That’s the secret to marriage!”\n\nHaines then wondered what Zeta-Jones has to do when she loses in golf, prompting Whoopi Goldberg to quickly end the interview.\n\n“I don’t even want to know,” she said, before thanking Douglas for his time.\n\nDouglas previously revealed how golf helped him figure out that Zeta-Jones was the one for him.\n\n“You know, Catherine loves golf,” he explained in an April 2024 interview, per The Daily Mail. “Actually, that was kind of the closer. We first got together. Things were looking good and I said, ‘What do you think of golf?’ She said, ‘Oh, I love golf!’ And I said ‘Oh, you do?’ I said, ‘This is too good to be true.'”\n\nDespite being couple goals these days, Zeta-Jones wasn’t immediately enamored by Douglas.\n\nThe actor recalled the first time he me her during a 2016 appearance on The Jonathan Ross Show, revealing that he invited her back for a “nightcap” before telling her that he was “going to be the father of [her] children” someday. He thought he blew it with her when she responded, “You know I’ve heard a lot about you, and I’ve seen a lot about you, and I think it’s time that I say goodnight.”\n\nFlash forward and they now have two children together, and are gearing up to celebrate 25 years of marriage next year.\n\nThe View airs on weekdays at 11/10c on ABC."
