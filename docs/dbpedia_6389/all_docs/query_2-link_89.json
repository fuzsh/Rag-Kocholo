        "text": "On his parents\n\nI WAS born in 1944, blessed with the fact that my mother, Diana, is an actress. She met my father Kirk in acting school, so I guess it (was destined) I would get into this business, this craft, because of the joy they had. Soon after they got married my father moved out to Hollywood. The pressures of careers and celebritydom and being able to pick all the peaches from the trees, I think were a little tough for them, for anyone. They got divorced very soon and I moved back and lived in New York City. I would progressively go back and see my father in California over the years. I think the biggest advantage of being second generation is seeing your father with his best friends, be it Burt Lancaster, Frank Sinatra, as people - seeing their foibles, seeing their vulnerabilities, and not just the illusion on screen.\n\nSo I think it makes it a lot easier when it comes to how you conduct yourself in your own life later on. But they had a great camaraderie that existed in Hollywood in the '50s which really isn't there anymore because movies now are made around the world. The studio system has changed, technically and everything else. They use less sound stages, so people live and work all over the world and don't have the kind of camaraderie and close-knit feelings that existed then. My father, in his autobiography The Rag Man's Son, tells how he worked his way through. He has a great stamina and discipline, and I think that's ultimately what gives you a career. I mean, pure talent can give you a moment, but it's the discipline and stamina that give you a career, and the ability to make choices passionately and emotionally but also objectively.\n\nAnd I think I learned a lot of that from my father who was a very, very competent producer as well. Besides Spartacus (1960) his company, Brighter Productions, did a number of films and you learn, and I certainly did at a very early point, about story, and three act structures, and what your responsibility is to the piece.\n\nOn getting started\n\nI WAS a hippie. It was 1963, I was at the University of California in Santa Barbara. It was a very exciting time, the music scene was exploding in San Francisco. I was having a fabulous time. And it was my third year in the university and they called me into the office and they said, 'you've got to declare a major, you can't just be taking these general education courses, you're a third year in the university now'. So I was like, 'Ok man... I guess I'll take theatre, man'. My mother was an actress and she did theatre in New York. And there's my father, of course my father. I had terrible stage fright for a long time, you know... puking into waste baskets before (I went) on. And I don't know why, I just figured it was something to overcome really, and struggled with it for a long time, and was actually blessed when I finally got the TV series The Streets of San Francisco, playing Inspector Steve Keller. Not only blessed because of co-star Karl Maiden, who's an extraordinary man, but also because I did 104 hours and I knew there was no hook to pull you off. I was there and it was only through that route, constantly being in front of these lenses, that it just finally kind of got worn down. And I gained confidence at the same time.\n\nOn a steep learning curve\n\nCOMA was my first movie as an actor after Streets of San Francisco. What happens with television is that you pick up some sloppy habits sometimes; maybe the writing isn't so good, so you add stuff. Me and Genevieve Bujoid were playing live-in lovers, who were also interns in a hospital. Michael Crichton, who was the director, and also a very good writer himself, was a doctor in another life. The opening of Coma, over the credits, is Genevieve and I coming back to the apartment and talking about how our day was, what happened and this and that. And I had a long four-page monologue which involved a lot of medical terms and expressions. So anyway, I thought I had it memorised pretty good, and we started doing it and talking about these medical terms - the melanoma, the cathasisti. And Mike said, \"no, it's the melanoma carthasisis\". So I took off, I couldn't remember my name. I think it was actually 63 takes I did. It was one of the most painful lessons that I ever had in my life about learning your lines, like really learning your lines. It was a nightmare day that I'll never forget.\n\nOn the Cuckoo and Jack\n\nMY father bought the novel One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest in galley form before it was published. It went to Broadway in 1960, but wasn't successful, maybe because it was a little ahead of its time. And that's the process a lot of people do. Even today they take a piece of material to the theatre and then eventually make it into a film. And so he did it, and then he tried for about four or five years afterwards to try to get the film going, and he couldn't get the film going. While I'm at university, One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest, the novel, has been out and it's become required reading of 20th Century American lit courses. Now five years later the off-Broadway version of the play has come out and it's a success. Meanwhile I've started my acting career, it's going OK and I know my father's trying to sell the rights to Cuckoo's Nest now. And so I said let me see if I can set it up and we can get it going. And I did, and one of the only provisos, and to this day Kirk won't let me forget, was that he didn't get to play the part. The fact that he had gotten a lot older, that his career was in a different place, didn't matter. The fact he was a silent producing partner and the fact that he made more money out of Cuckoo's Nest than any other film he made didn't matter. The saving grace is how good Jack (Nicholson) was. He won the Oscar for Best Actor and the movie won one for Best Picture.\n\nWe actually shot in the state mental hospital that Ken Kesey used in the book. It was a state hospital, and the head of the hospital was taking quite a risk in letting us in there. Dr Dean Brooks looked at the script and he analysed a profile of some of the other characters in the film, what their problems might be and he created a portfolio. Then these actors, before we started during the rehearsal period, would go up on the ward but not tell the other patients that they were an actor. They would just be involved with them as a patient, and take part in the group therapy sessions with them.\n\nJack Nicholson could not make the early rehearsal period because of a previous commitment. So when he showed up at work and all of these actors were unknown, you know pretty much all unknown, everybody was in such character they never left it. So the first day he was looking around. We came to lunchtime, we had some lunch, and he took his tray and he pushed it away, going outside. I was a producer, it was my first day with Jack Nicholson. I said, 'Jack you all right?' He said, 'Who are these guys and what's going on. Nobody stops here. I mean, it's lunch time; can't we stop and have a lunch break? These guys are going all the time'. And that's the kind of environment which sometimes you need for those kinds of pictures, a closed environment. It made all the difference being there on location.\n\nOn that showe scene\n\nMY father was 90 in December and he's done 90 movies. He was used to doing four, maybe five movies a year. You have to remember there was only maybe two television stations that existed in black and white, nowhere near the outlets, so more people went to films. He was a workaholic. He was working all the time so on summer holidays I would visit him. This one summer I was 16 and I worked as an assistant film editor at Universal. And in those days there wasn't a commissary and so working in the editing room we had our little paper lunch bags. When they were doing the editing on Psycho (1960), our favourite thing to do at that time was take our lunch bags down at lunchtime to the Psycho editing room and look at the out-takes from Janet Leigh in the shower, and that was pretty exciting for a 16-year-old let me tell you!\n\nOn seeing Kurt kiss lana Turner\n\nI WAS probably nine or 10 and I went to visit the set the day that my father was having a romance scene with Lana Turner. And I walked into the set and it was all dark and he had her hair, he kissed her and he looked up and I remember looking at my father going, 'What's going on here? Oh my god!', and he just looked at me and he said, because I was in his sight line, 'Michael...' (gestures to move away)... So I moved away, but I remember the intensity of the two of them and it struck a strong chord that day.\n\nOn stepping out of Kirk's shadow\n\nWHENEVER you have successful parents you tend to be a late bloomer; it takes you longer to find out what you want to be, particularly if your father's an actor. He was Spartacus leading the slaves, saying come on, follow me, he was larger than life. As a young kid you kind of go 'wow' - if I can be an actor can I ever be the man that my father is? You know as you get a little older you start to separate the illusion which is on screen versus the reality and the struggles that people deal with, the pressures that go on all the time. If you're both actors the first thing people say is, 'Boy, you remind me so much of your own dad!' Well if you're trying to establish your own identity that's a little intimidating, you know, because half your genes are your father's. But people know my mother, so it takes you a lot longer to establish your own identity. But as far as stepping out of the shadow, I think it came at an early point. As an actor it was the year of Fatal Attraction (1987) and Wall Street (1987) - I got the Oscar for one, and the other was very commercially successful. So I just stepped out. A lot of actors were under studio contracts in those days. On one hand it guaranteed you a living, and the other hand limited the parts that you got a chance to play. My father was one of the few who fought the studio system and never really went under contract, but he took a big chance on his sixth or seventh movie, which was Champion (1949). It was produced by Stanley Kramer, and in that picture, in which he was nominated for his first Oscar, he took a chance and played against the kind of sensitive young man roles that he first started playing, and ironically, it was the first kind of roles which I did too.\n\nOn choosing films\n\nI CHOOSE a movie first - I don't think I choose a role. I look at scripts and see if I'm emotionally moved. If it scares me, if it's hot, it's romantic, it's funny, you know. I got an emotional movement from reading a script. Then from all of those years on Streets of San Francisco, I analyse a script; I close my eyes and I picture it structurally, and I see if dramatically the whole piece makes sense. I don't get seduced just by the written word. I then look at my part, asking myself if it's something I've done before, is it something different? I'm attracted to morally ambivalent characters, because that's how life is sometimes. I don't see a lot saints walking around, nor do I see pure sinners. It's about making choices in life. Sometimes people make the wrong choices, sometimes they make the right choices, and I think my responsibility of having a certain amount of success in this industry, and not worrying about where your next job is coming from, is to test yourself. And so I try to make the best movie possible. I'm not worried about audience support. I do like to dig a big hole for my characters and have people go, 'Oh, how's he going to get out of this?', and then try to maintain some reality and credibility about how you dig your way out of the hole.\n\nOn working with otehr actors\n\nI TRY to surround myself with the best actors possible. I'm not threatened if they're better actors than I am. Because the only thing that matters is a good movie. That's the only thing that matters, not how good you were in the picture. I then try and make everybody as good as they can be. If I'm the star, like in a lot of pictures I do, I'm in every single scene so I'm there every day. If new actors are coming in, you try to encourage them just to be as comfortable as they can in this uncomfortable environment, filled with lights, microphones, cameras.\n\nOn working with Danny DeVito\n\nDANNY'S my oldest friend. We met when I was working in the summer theatre when I was still in the university, it was called the National Playwrights Conference. It used to do new plays, and we were part of the acting repertory company that would present them. Danny was at the American Academy of Dramatic Arts, and from day one he was a great comedian. We obviously did Romancing the Stone (1984) together and he was a tremendous asset in making that picture work. Then came The Jewel of the Nile (1985) where Kathleen Turner and I worked with Danny. Then he directed us in War of the Roses (1989) which is a pretty dark comedy. He has a great, dark, wicked sense, and I try to follow his advice about playing it straight. But there's the other part of me which loves to camp it up, as it's so much fun.\n\nOn working with friends\n\nWHEN you work with friends or you work with people you've worked with before, you don't have to go through this introductory dance. You're comfortable with each other; you know each other's rhythms, tempo. I worked with Kathleen Turner for three pictures so you can take chances, not worrying if you're offending your actor or this or that, so it just makes it so much easier. Jack (Nicholson) I loved just because he's a wonderful actor. One of the great qualities that he has and I particularly liked was when we were talking about stage fright and being camera shy. He almost uses the camera as an excuse to open up; he uses this environment to be more open in front of a camera than he might be in real life. It's very effective and hopefully we'll work together some time.\n\nOn the Oscars\n\nI DON'T know if everybody knows, but your fellow actors nominate you to the Academy. So it meant a tremendous amount to me, particularly as I was stepping out of the shadow of my father. And I know what it meant to Catherine, and what a bang old performance she did (in Chicago, where she won an Oscar for Best Supporting Actress). It was so well deserved. In my father's case, winning a special Oscar meant a tremendous amount because he had a stroke just before he got it. It's just the luck of the draw that somebody who has done as many great pictures as he has, who had been nominated three times, had never won. So I remember it as a wonderfully emotional night in the large part because he was able to stand up there as he was starting to get his speech back. We won five for Cuckoo's Nest. And I said to the director, \"It's all downhill from here!\"\n\nOn Catherine Zeta Jones\n\nAS far as having a relationship with an actress, and as far as each understanding the other's work and business, you know she's been working for a long time. She was on the West End in Annie when she was nine, starring in 42nd Street when she was 16. Doing all those shows, that's a tremendous discipline. She's also got a wonderful screen presence, an idea of who she is, and I'm happy to see her in the last couple of films even stretch out more. I think she probably has the looks but she also has a talent that didn't exist among a lot of the old-time Hollywood stars in terms of her singing and her dancing, which is the real thing. Acting is so much more interpretative, you can get away with a little more. But you can't hide too much behind singing and dancing.\n\nOn working with the wife\n\nTHE rules are that as far as doing a romance together in a film for a married couple, audiences seem to lack the excitement, knowing somewhere in the back of their mind these people are together all the time. But particularly now that Catherine and I have a couple of children, young children together, and given the time it takes to make movies, anywhere from three to five months, in which you could be away from home. We'd love to find a picture to do together. I think I'd be the villain; I'd be the bad guy. 'Cos nobody likes these older guys with younger women, so we'll get her a young leading man and I'll be the bad guy. And I'll off one of them, you know.\n\nOn the future\n\nI TOOK a three-year break largely because I was a new husband and a new father which I never anticipated at this point in my life. And if you're going to have children, you might as well really, really enjoy them. I have an older boy and I missed a lot of his growing up as I was working so hard. Being around in the early developmental years of a child when you have their unequivocal love, before their teen years and all of that, was a treat. Besides that my wife is a very successful actress, she's in the prime of her career, and I knew Catherine would need some flexibility too, in terms of having some experience in trying to maintain the marriage and making it work. So I tried to make myself more flexible and I was just sort of ready for a break. I've always had the production company and I've kept things going. I know every time I say that's it, you know, six months from now I'm going to want to do something. And you're sort of responsible now more than ever for initiating your material. And I sort of work that way in fits and spurts. I'm looking forward to focusing my efforts back with the United Nations. I try to do a lot of work in the area of disarmament, small arms as well as weapons of mass destruction. Taking advantage of the fact as an actor people know you all around the world, and sometimes they'd rather talk to you than some of the diplomats, so you sort of have easier access with a lot of leaders of the world. So I think that will be a big focus of mine, as is continuing to have a deep respect for a family unit, knowing what that takes to make it work. I think it's just so tough for so many people early in their careers to start families and their careers at the same time, something's gotta give. And the movie business is not something that you can keep in balance - it's about obsessions, it's about being obsessive and passionate. So you've gotta make a choice sometimes.\n\n*An evening dedicated to the Douglases on film channel TCM (Turner Classic Movies) kicks off with Kirk Douglas in The Bad and the Beautiful at 6.15pm on March 27, followed by Michael Douglas in Off Set at 8.25pm"
