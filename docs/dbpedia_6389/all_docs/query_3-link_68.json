        "text": "All together, these men sitting up here [Teldar management] own less than 3 percent of the company. And where does Mr. Cromwell put his million-dollar salary? Not in Teldar stock; he owns less than 1 percent.\n\nGekko: Teldar Paper, Mr. Cromwell, Teldar Paper has 33 different vice presidents, each earning over 200 thousand dollars a year. Now, I have spent the last two months analyzing what all these guys do, and I still can't figure it out. One thing I do know is that our paper company lost 110 million dollars last year, and I'll bet that half of that was spent in all the paperwork going back and forth between all these vice presidents.\n\nThe point is, ladies and gentleman, that greed -- for lack of a better word -- is good.\n\nGreed is right.\n\nGreed works.\n\nGreed clarifies, cuts through, and captures the essence of the evolutionary spirit.\n\nGreed, in all of its forms -- greed for life, for money, for love, knowledge -- has marked the upward surge of mankind.\n\nAnd greed -- you mark my words -- will not only save Teldar Paper, but that other malfunctioning corporation called the USA."
