        "text": "One of my all time favorites was Rod Serling. I preferred Serling narrating the The Undersea World of Jacques Cousteau series to whomever took over after his passing, (George Wilson?). There was something in the replacement's voice that was flat. Jacques Cousteau was good at doing some of the narration.\n\nSame applies to David McCullough although not as extreme.\n\nBill Moyers narrated and interviewed during portions of Joseph Campbell and The Power of Myth. I enjoy Charlie Rose interviews partially because I enjoy his voice. They both sound similar to me in certain ways.\n\nJeff Bridges has an interesting voice for narration although I may have only heard him doing commercials.\n\nMichael Douglas, although I cannot name the film(s).\n\nAnthony Hopkins has a good voice for narration.\n\nRalph Waite was good narrating as an older John Boy in The Waltons.\n\nRobert Redford was good narrating as an older Norman Maclean in A River Runs Through It.\n\nThey say the voice is key to being a good actor. People overlook how significant it is because film is a predominantly visual medium. I can think of several actors who who were limited because they either had a weak voice or were unable to adopt plausible accents.\n\nFor instance, I know he started off strong in Primal Fear and has managed a long career with many good roles but I think Edward Norton has a weak voice limiting him even though I had not yet come to that conclusion and was able to find his performance in American History X plausible. His voice rendered him too much a man of our times for period pieces like The Painted Veil and The Illusionist. Those films left me in a position where I am now too aware of his nasally, weak, contemporary voice. ( obviously just sharing my opinion you may disagree 🙂 )\n\nMike Tyson had a brief dramatic role in Spike Lee's 25th Hour. It is unfortunate that he has such a distinct voice. I have seen worse performances. He was just as good as the average actor who typically would have a role like that. He played himself in The Hangover and was flawless delivering his lines and acting as himself. It isn't easy looking natural saying lines and doing things for a camera even playing yourself, in case anyone thinks \"well he is just playing himself.\"\n\nKevin Costner is another who comes up short because of his voice, (i.e. Robinhood). He missed the mark in JFK but to his credit he nailed the same accent in Thirty Days.\n\nMorgan Freeman, yes.\n\nInteresting about compensation. Narrating a book is typically a larger a project. But it does not surprise me that commercials pay more. There is greater potential money stimulated in advertising.\n\nMany actors have done voice work for cartoons, commercials and video games. It is bread and butter work in between film projects. The money is in animated film and commercials. An aside, attempting to sell an animated film based on who is voicing it is counterproductive to me. I don't care who it is. I care about what is created with the character. My favorite animated film experienced as an adult is Pixar's A Bug's Life. There were a few actors in that which had good voices for animated characters. One was Phyllis Diller. I wasn't compelled to see it because she voiced a character. I enjoyed it more because her aging voice was well-suited for her animated character.\n\nI have tried to enjoy audio books. No matter how good the narrator is I find it a relatively diluted way to experience a book. I get so much out of reading the book myself. For one thing, there is a rhythm in everything whether audio, visual or sensational. All three are available when I read myself. Visually, I am speaking of the words on the page not any illustrations or photographs which might be included. Writing and reading are both arts which can be appreciated seeing them on the page. Whether a narrator has the greatest speaking voice and reading ability or not listing to words read is not the same experience of this rhythm as reading the words myself.\n\nI cannot comment on narrated books without mentioning the wonderful experience I have had listening to a few of my grammar school teachers reading books to the class. I feel great love for these people who did this for us. Do teachers still read to their classes nowadays? I suspect kids are just too wild to appreciate this art.\n\nA key element is being present, hearing and perhaps sensing the vibe of the narrator's voice.\n\nAs an adult many years ago I attended a weekend retreat. It was lead by a man who was the classic old soul archetype. He was very intelligent and had a knack for relating to a diverse range of people. He could speak the language of the common people as well as the specialized elite. He had an exceptionally soothing voice. He was also an author. When he read a passage from his books I was captivated and sucked in like I had been when my teachers read to the class.\n\nIt isn't just being able to read and having the interesting voice. It is comprehending the message and conveying it infused with the appropriate emotion. If they get it, chances are the listener will too.\n\nOne last thing, I cannot say for certain because you only have one chance to experience it but I suspect I enjoyed Mary Shelly's Frankenstein: Or, The Modern Prometheus more because I was reading it myself and also listening to the audio book while driving around running errands. I was assisting a friend doing an analysis. The audio/errand time provided the distance and perspective to consider things and replay different passages. The narrator also read in character when covering The Creature's dialog. It was particularly effective.\n\nMel Blanc: It might have been an interesting piece of trivia when thought to be true how Bugs Bunny's voice actor was allergic to carrots. He used to bite and chomp on a carrot when doing some Bugs lines. He would have to quickly spit the carrot out so he could say the rest of the lines.\n\nHe was in a head on car crash and in a coma. The hospital had a TV next to his bed playing his cartoons hoping it would bring him back. Eventually a doctor decided to try asking Mel a question addressing Mel as Bugs Bunny and Mel responded.\n\nSomething else interesting is that Mel Blanc started smoking cigarettes when he was 9 years old. That alone is shocking to me and it makes his life story even more miraculous.\n\nHe had a major impact on generations of children. His contribution to the animation industry has been unprecedented. He used his voice to lend life to multiple famous characters earning the reference The Man of 1000 Voices. Many were distinct and unique. You could not tell they were done by the same person.\n\nHe managed this while jeopardizing the means to his livelihood, his voice. But in the early days the dangers of smoking were unknown to the general public. Cigarettes were advertised on television.\n\nI never smoked. I did try it. One of the things which discouraged me was the obvious consequence of breathing in any form of smoke. I choked and gagged. I was in my early teens. At that age each year involves a significant amount of growth. At 9, Mel was just a child.\n\nLater while smoking a pack a day he managed to make a living manipulating his voice. He finally quit smoking but died from complications of emphysema 4 years later at the age of 81."
