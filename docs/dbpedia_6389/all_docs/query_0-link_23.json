To this harried representative of his gender, any kind of sexual contact with someone other than his mate and the mother of his children is destined to come at a costly price.\n\nIn Fatal Attraction, he is an otherwise happily married man whose one-night stand with a seductress-from-Hell (Glenn Close) transforms his—and his family's—existence into a never-ending horror movie. In Basic Instinct—a title that purposefully features the same cadence as Fatal Attraction—he is a cop whose sense of professionalism evaporates when he becomes involved with a sexy murder suspect (Sharon Stone). Disclosure is a drama of sexual harassment in the workplace, only the tables are turned: the boss, the sexually aggressive harasser (Demi Moore), is a woman, while the underling, the happily-married nice-guy harassee (Douglas), is a man. The female characters in Fatal Attraction, Basic Instinct, and Disclosure are cutthroat villainesses, an anti-feminist's fantasy of a man-eating monster. Poor Michael Douglas is the Everyman who must contend with, and be victimized by, these women and their raging, psychotic sexuality.\n\nA fourth film to add to this trio is The War of the Roses, only here Douglas's tormentor is his wife (Kathleen Turner), with whom he is in the throes of divorce and cannot agree on a property settlement. The War of the Roses extends the Douglas Everyman in that his tormentor does not come from outside the family circle. His character literally digs into the trenches and goes to war with the woman whom he once loved.\n\nFalling Down is a natural extension of The War of the Roses. Here, Douglas plays an alienated powder keg who has lost his job and is estranged from his wife. All of his humanity has been stripped away by an uncaring society. One day, he explodes internally while his car is stuck in a traffic jam on a Los Angeles freeway, and he sets off on a violent odyssey across the urban landscape of Southern California.\n\nConversely, in Wall Street, Douglas for once gets to play the victimizer rather than the victim. Gordon Gekko is one of his most fascinating characters: the heaviest of heavy hitters, a stock and real estate speculator whose face adorns the cover of Fortune magazine. To Gekko, $800,000 is just another day's profit. Ambitious young stockbroker Bud Fox (Charlie Sheen) pursues Gekko, and soon becomes the master's protege. With this position comes a price, because involvement with the ruthless, passionless Gekko means twisting the rules, using insider information to trade stocks and artificially manipulate the market. If Gekko is no nice guy lost in a maze of aggressive females, he is another incarnation of the modern American male: the greedy yuppie personification of the Me generation, a white-collar criminal from skin to soul who is convinced that \"greed is good,\" and who is a fitting corporate villain for the Reagan years. He is played by Douglas with just the right touch of menace and swagger.\n\nUpon Douglas's earning major screen stardom in the mid-1980s with his delightful performance as an idealistic soldier of fortune in Romancing the Stone and its sequel, The Jewel of the Nile, it became easy to forget that he previously had enjoyed a successful career both in front of and behind the camera. In the 1970s, he co-starred with Karl Malden in the long-running television series, The Streets of San Francisco. He was the Academy Award-winning co-producer of One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest. He had a nice supporting role in The China Syndrome (which he also produced), a first-rate drama about the attempted cover-up of a nuclear power plant accident and one of the most intelligent Hollywood films of the late 1970s. In 1983 he had an interesting starring role in The Star Chamber, a provocative drama about a judge who has come to regard as inadequate the legal system with which he is such an integral part, and who becomes involved with a diabolical vigilante group. After scoring in Fatal Attraction and Wall Street, Douglas proved he could play a Stallone-like action hero in his role as a New York cop in Black Rain.\n\nDuring the second half of the 1990s, Douglas still kept playing yuppie victims and victimizers. He was the former in The Game, cast as a wealthy investment banker who becomes immersed in paranoia while participating in the title diversion; he was the latter in A Perfect Murder, an unnecessary remake of Dial M For Murder, playing a merciless commodities trader who schemes to do in his unfaithful wife (Gwyneth Paltrow). Douglas returned to the thriller genre in The Ghost and the Darkness, cast as a fabled American game hunter in 1896 East Africa. But in his best roles of the period, he deviates from these personas. First he reinvented himself as a suave, Clintonesque chief executive, a widower who begins dating a feisty environmental lobbyist (Annette Bening), in The American President. Then he gave his most acclaimed performance in years in Wonder Boys, cast as a disheveled, pot-smoking college English professor/writer who fears that he will be unable to repeat the success of his first novel.\n\n—Rob Edelman"
