        "text": "Michael Douglas is halfway through an explanation of how he's changed over the last decade when his cell phone goes off.\n\nHe checks the caller ID and smiles. \"Well, hello, darlin',\" he purrs. \"No, I'm doing an interview. Are you headed back to the apartment? OK. OK, then I'll talk to you later. Love you.\"\n\nI ask him if I can assume that was his lovely wife. \"Yes,\" he says, and then pauses and laughs. \"It had better be, right?\"\n\nThere was a time -- before Michael Douglas married Catherine Zeta-Jones in 2000, before he decided to re-settle their family in Bermuda, before he began to slow down -- when that answer couldn't have been assumed. But, Douglas says, he's not the man he was.Back then it seemed as if the son hadn't only inherited his famous father's square jaw, but some of Kirk's wanderlust, too. His first wife, Diandra, complained about Michael's womanizing. In the early '90s there were even reports he was being treated for \"sex addiction\" (the problem, he later said, was just garden-variety substance abuse).\n\nBut these days, it seems, the re-married Michael Douglas is finally settling down, with one woman -- albeit the glamorous Catherine Zeta-Jones, 25 years his junior -- and at a decidedly slower pace. They live most of the time in Bermuda, with their two children. When she won her Oscar for \"Chicago,\" he was content to applaud.\n\n\"My priorities have changed,\" he says. \"Like my father, like most actors, I was a pretty ambitious guy. I was focused on my career ... Starting a new family -- that was never in my plans. But then I met Catherine and that I haven't done much since isn't coincidental. It's tough to find a reason to leave home now and go do a movie.\"\n\nStill, when Douglas got the script for \"King of California,\" he went. It was a break from the last films he'd done -- the sluggish action picture \"The Sentinel,\" the unnecessary remake of \"The In-Laws.\" And the character was a real change of pace -- stoned and sixty-ish and slightly nuts, a down-and-out jazzman on a treasure hunt for Spanish gold.\n\n\"I just thought it was funny, tragic and terrifically written -- which is rare, because it seems like most of the great writers are off doing television now,\" Douglas says, during an interview at a publicist's Manhattan office. \"And the beauty about playing crazies is that it gives you the freedom to just sort of go.\"\n\n\"We did a lot of talking beforehand, and he looked at this thing in a very serious way,\" says writer and director Mike Cahill, whose movie opens Friday. \"But once we started, we had to move and just trust our instincts and I think he had enjoyed that .$?.$?. Michael has a certain craziness himself, I think, and it was certainly a pleasure for me to see that come out, because he doesn't always get that chance.\"\n\nWhat Douglas has most often gotten the chance to play are men in power. Masculine without question, confident without apologies, they are tycoons (\"Wall Street,\" \"The Game\"), big-game hunters (\"The Ghost and the Darkness\") and even chief executives (\"The American President\"). They are leaders, and they only lose control -- in \"Fatal Attraction,\" in \"Basic Instinct,\" in \"Disclosure\" -- when they let a woman into their lives.\n\nThey are, in fact, nearly the exact opposite of the real-life role he's relaxed into.\n\nBut then his life has always been a little surprising.\n\nAlthough his parents were both actors, Douglas' mother came from place and privilege; her father was the Attorney General of Bermuda, and her sister was married to Seward Johnson. Douglas was born in New Brunswick because his parents were staying at the Johnson estate, while his father went on New York auditions. He was the only struggling actor, Kirk Douglas later joked, who took New Jersey Transit home to a castle.\n\nHis parents soon moved to Greenwich Village, then Los Angeles, then divorced, and by the '50s Michael was back East with his mother. He went to Choate, and was expected to go on to the Ivy League. Instead, Douglas decided -- \"probably the biggest decision I ever made\" -- to enroll at the University of California, Santa Barbara.\n\n\"Dad has always thought it was because I wanted to be closer to him, which is nice,\" he says now with a smile. \"But I don't think he ever really took a look at the girls in Santa Barbara.\"\n\nDouglas took more than a look, which is probably why he quickly flunked out. But a year later he came back and, forced to declare a major, picked theater, because he expected it would be easy. \"It wasn't,\" he says. \"It was painful. I was shy -- I had terrible stage fright -- and I didn't know what I was doing. But for some reason I kept working at it. I don't know why, but there was this desire to be better. And then, later, the satisfaction of knowing I was getting better.\"\n\nWorking hard was a novel experience for the rich kid, and a surprisingly satisfying one. After college, he moved back to New York. He apprenticed with serious stage companies like the Neighborhood Playhouse. He took classes, shared rooms with Danny DeVito -- the beginning of a life-long friendship -- and eventually started doing movies. But it still took awhile to feel comfortable.\n\n\"Early on someone had told me, 'You know, the camera can always tell when you're lying,'\" he says. \"And, Jesus, that intimidated me. The camera can always tell? How am I going to do this? Until one day I thought, wait a minute, acting is lying. Acting is all about lying. And hey, I've lied to my mother, I've lied to girls -- 'Oh, baby, baby' -- I can be a great liar. So who's to know if I'm telling the truth on screen?\"\n\nThe decision to fake it wouldn't have pleased many of his old acting teachers, but Douglas found it liberating. When his first big break came in 1972 -- TV's \"The Streets of San Francisco\" -- he was 28, and he was ready. And after four seasons of doing it, he finally felt like a pro.\n\n\"On location eight-and-a-half months straight, shooting six-days-a-week, 26 episodes a season -- I got better. You just had to. And working with Karl Malden too -- fantastic guy, great listener, great work ethic. You started feeling as if they could throw anything at you. And then you woke up one day and realized, after years of watching all this, you knew all about producing, too.\"\n\nWhich was fortunate because his father still had the rights to \"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest,\" and was tired of trying to get studios interested.\n\n\"He had read that book in galleys, and bought the rights, and tried to get it going as a feature and couldn't.\" Douglas says. \"So he told me to try. And I'd never thought about being a producer at all, but I loved that book and ended up getting it made and it became the biggest change and influence in my life. I still owe him that.\"\n\nIt was a debt the elder Douglas sometimes felt hadn't quite been paid off. His son got the financing, but only with Jack Nicholson in the part his father still coveted, and when the film won Nicholson the Oscar -- and Michael another one, for producing -- for Kirk, the celebration was bittersweet.\n\n\"It's like that moment where you're proud that your son is doing well, you know,\" Douglas says. \"But he doesn't have to do that well.\"\n\nOver the '80s, the star's son quietly developed into a good actor. A familiar one, too. His Oscar-winning turn as Gordon Gekko in 1988's \"Wall Street\" seemed emblematic of the go-go '80s, from the power ties to the \"Greed is good\" mantra. But with his smooth patter and sleek hair, Gekko's really only a slightly more legit version of Whit Sterling, the slick gambler his father had played in \"Out of the Past\" more than 40 years before.\n\nEven as he established his own career, though, Douglas learned from his father, and the importance of choosing the movie, not the part.\n\n\"Sometimes you've got the colorful role in 'Wall Street,' and Charlie Sheen is carrying the story forward,\" Douglas says, \"and sometimes you're moving the plot forward in 'Basic Instinct' and Sharon Stone has the great role. You just have to know what your responsibility is to the movie, and live up to that, and be considerate of the other actors in the scene... I have never been competitive in that way -- I always want my leading ladies to be as good as they possibly can be.\"\n\nFor more than 20 years his offscreen leading lady had been Diandra, whom he wed in 1977 and who gave him a son, Cameron. But the same man who'd picked his college based on the coeds wasn't quite ready to settle down. Gossip columnists wrote about his hard partying, and Diandra complained about his bad parenting.\n\n\"In this biz it's very hard to balance it out,\" he says. \"A lot of times you're consumed with your career and your family takes a back seat.\"\n\nHis wife divorced him in 2000 -- which was helpful as he'd already impulsively proposed marriage to Catherine Zeta-Jones the year before. They married on Nov. 18, three months after the birth of their first child. The headlines generated by their nuptials -- focusing first on their selling of exclusive picture rights to a gossip magazine, and then their lawsuit when the photos appeared elsewhere -- gave things an ugly, early taint.\n\nStill, the start of the new decade was the start of a new life for Douglas. He had a solid part in \"Traffic,\" another topical hit, and a great role in \"Wonder Boys,\" playing a pot-smoking literary reprobate. The movie got him his best reviews since \"Wall Street,\" and talk of perhaps his second Oscar nomination. Instead the movie died at the box office, and was shunned by the Academy. It left Douglas hurt for a long time.\n\n\"That was one of those you just couldn't figure out,\" he says now, philosophically. \"It had a great screenplay, great cast. And the studio was great too, even re-released it later in the year. But nobody saw it. I think maybe it was a little too wiggy for people, with the pot-smoking and the transvestites... But then I think of 'Lonely Are the Brave,' which is my father's favorite of all his movies. It's a jewel, and when it came out nobody saw that, either.\"\n\nIt was around that time that Douglas started taking a step or two back. Although he's produced 20 films and TV series over the years, he admits he's \"getting worn down on development -- I just don't have the energy for all those rewrites.\" While he's proud of his box-office successes -- \"I had a pretty good run,\" he says of his '80s peak -- he no longer feels the need to work quite so much.\n\n\"King of California\" was an exception. An in-development sequel to \"Wall Street\" -- \"although I think old Gordon would probably get eaten up by this group that's out there today\" -- is another possibility.\n\nBut mostly, Douglas enjoys his newer, deeper relationship with his father, now 90, still hale and \"conducting the third act of his life with such aplomb.\" He enjoys his homes, most especially the place in Bermuda, where his mother's family goes back 400 years. And he enjoys, most of the time, his life in a quieter lane.\n\n\"Catherine and I have just chosen to disengage,\" he says of the tabloid world. \"We live on an island, literally, and have chosen a lifestyle that's just away from all that. And that, to me, is the real value of being older -- being able to realize that you are the luckiest guy alive, and to not take that for granted, but nurture and protect it. And so, OK, we've just stayed out of all that, and -- apart from the big shebang when we got married -- the celebrity gossip mags have moved on. They're focused on other people now, and that's just fine.$?.$?. Sometimes, you know, you think you miss it.\"\n\nHe smiles.\n\n\"But then,\" he says, \"you go fishing.\""
