Douglas's books have been translated into more than twelve languages.\n\nSIDELIGHTS:\n\nKirk Douglas is a respected actor who is well known for his performances in such classic movies as Spartacus, Seven Days in May, and Gunfight at the O.K. Corral. With the 1988 publication of his autobiography, The Ragman's Son, he also gained considerable status as an author. The Ragman's Son surprised many people, not with its lurid details of Hollywood sex and intrigue, but with the quality of its writing and honest insights into Douglas's driven personality. In addition to continuing his work in the realm of acting, Douglas followed the success of his autobiography with the publication of three novels, Dance with the Devil, The Gift, and Last Tango in Brooklyn, two children's books, and a second volume of memoirs titled Climbing the Mountain: My Search for Meaning. In 2002 he wrote My Stroke of Luck, describing his 1996 stroke and its aftermath.\n\nDouglas was born Issur Danielovitch, the son of illiterate Russian immigrants. He learned quickly that he was going to have to work twice as hard as others to get ahead—in part because he came from a poor immigrant family and in part, he has said, because he is Jewish. Hiding his identity under the name Kirk Douglas, he worked his way through college and, after leaving the U.S. Navy in 1944, began his acting career. He made his film debut as a bit player in The Strange Love of Martha Ivers, but his chiseled good looks and powerful screen presence soon won him the roles that led him to be considered one of Hollywood's greatest leading men. Douglas exercised his talent and clout behind the camera as well, producing and directing numerous films. Among the more notable of these films was Spartacus, in which Douglas served as both the lead actor and the executive producer.\n\nThe magnitude of Douglas's success meant that much of his private life was subject to public scrutiny and, quite often, misrepresentation. The victim of over seven unauthorized biographies, Douglas set the record straight on his past by publishing The Ragman's Son in 1988. The actor had contemplated and worked on the book for nearly thirty years, and Douglas admitted that writing it had been painful at times. Douglas doesn't flinch when he describes his brutal childhood or the anti-Semitism that drove him to become an ambitious and competitive man. \"Mr. Douglas is often excruciatingly honest about himself, his flaws and his strengths,\" noted Susan Stamberg in the New York Times Book Review. \"It is clear that he is a willful man, difficult to work with at times, driven (he made seventy-five films, usually three a year in his heyday), opinionated.\"\n\nCritics were impressed with Douglas's writing ability in The Ragman's Son, but few expected the actor to turn his attention to writing fiction, which he did with Dance with the Devil. The novel's main character, Danny Dennison, has hidden his Jewish identity to succeed in Hollywood, but a murder and his relationship with a young Polish refugee-turned-prostitute force him to reexamine his past. In writing his first novel, Douglas was challenged by his editors to provide descriptive passages that would convey the action of the story. New York Times Book Review contributor Robert Stuart Nathan commented that while Dance with the Devil \"stakes no claim as literature, it ranks up there with the best of Sidney Sheldon, Judith Krantz and Harold Robbins.\" Chicago Tribune contributor Michael Kilian called the novel \"a surprisingly successful effort that makes for highly compelling reading.\"\n\nIn 1991, Douglas was a passenger in a helicopter that collided with a small plane in California, killing the pilot and a young trainee instantly. Feeling guilty at his own survival and haunted by the tragedy, Douglas began to question the meaning of his life. Although he had explored his past as the son of a Russian Jewish ragman in his autobiography, Douglas had never been a practicing Jew and had never celebrated his religion's traditions. The accident changed him spiritually as well as physically. He began to ask himself why he had survived the accident while the two young people had died.\n\nDuring his recovery from his injuries, he began to feel a strong pull back to the Judaism of his birth. Since then Douglas has been studying the Talmud and the Torah and continues to rediscover the Jewish religion. Douglas told Graham Fuller in Interview, \"In my case I was born a Jew, but I neglected it for sixty years, and then it was suddenly awakened and I became a strong Jew, yet in a secular way.\"\n\nIn 1995, his faith was put to the test when he suffered a stroke. What started as a slight pain down his cheek left him without the power of speech. After a year of exhausting physical therapy and debilitating bouts of depression, he started working and writing again.\n\nClimbing the Mountain, a continuation of The Ragman's Son, came out of this period of personal crisis. Douglas tells how Bible stories and texts helped him cope with the many setbacks of recovery and taught him that spiritual growth comes out of adversity. The book culminates in his triumphant appearance at the 1996 Academy Awards to receive a lifetime achievement Oscar from his oldest son, Michael.\n\nTwo children's books have resulted from Douglas's rediscovery of Judaism. The first, The Broken Mirror: A Novella tells the story of a Jewish boy who denies his identity and loses his faith when everyone he loves is killed in the Holocaust. Finding himself alone, Moishe tells his American liberators that he is not a Jew but a Gypsy. The Americans place him in a Catholic orphanage in the States but he is desperately unhappy. He finally runs away and wanders the streets until he finds himself in front of a synagogue and hears the familiar sounds of the Sabbath services. When the congregation sees the numbers tattooed on his arm, he is warmly welcomed \"home.\" \"The style is quiet and usually true to the child's viewpoint, the history authentic, the horror confronted but kept at bay by the broad sweep of the personal account,\" wrote Hazel Rochman in Booklist.\n\nDouglas wrote Young Heroes of the Bible: A Book for Family Sharing because, as he told Graham Fuller, he felt that his generation had \"messed up,\" and he wanted to find a way to talk about morality to young people. \"I'm proud of this book because it came out of my own reading of the Bible that followed everything that had happened to me … I wanted to show that the Bible is an adventure story involving the young, hoping it will incite young people to have more interest in reading it in a different way.\"\n\nIn 2002, Douglas returned to the subject of his 1996 stroke and the difficult period of recovery. In My Stroke of Luck, he recounts how he battled depression, almost committed suicide, and finally found the strength to transform the illness into a life-affirming experience. Douglas has focused the book on helping other patients and their families cope with the consequences of a stroke. The last chapter is titled \"Operator's Manual,\" with advice, exercises and some handy tricks he picked up along to way to recovery.\n\nIn 2007, another memoir by Douglas was published. Titled Let's Face It: 90 Years of Living, Loving and Learning, the memoir presents a series of seemingly disconnected views of episodes in life, from the time of his youth onwards. In addition, the author writes about what he thinks of the modern world and the current state of affairs. For the most part, Douglas writes sparingly about his career accomplishments in film. Rather, he recalls fond youthful memories and his recent activities and family life, including his work with local schools in Los Angeles. Douglas, who has rediscovered his Jewish roots, also writes about Judaism and the state of Israel. In the book's \"deeper\" segments, Douglas ponders the meaning of life, remembers deceased friends, and laments the death of his son, Eric, to drugs and alcohol. \"Let's Face It offers a pleasant, entertaining read,\" wrote Richard A. Blake in America. \"It doesn't take itself too seriously, despite the seriousness of many of the reflections on mortality, and that constitutes a recommendation for anyone who relishes the movies of a bygone age.\" Rosellen Brewer, writing in the Library Journal, noted: \"There is less pomposity here and perhaps even more truth as the actor rethinks things he wrote earlier.\"\n\nBIOGRAPHICAL AND CRITICAL SOURCES:\n\nBOOKS\n\nBawden, Liz-Anne, The Oxford Companion to Film, Oxford University Press (New York, NY), 1976.\n\nBestsellers 90: Books and Authors in the News, Issue 4, Gale (Detroit, MI), 1991.\n\nContemporary Theatre, Film, and Television: A Biographical Guide Featuring Performers, Directors, Writers, Producers, Designers, Managers, Choreographers, Technicians, Composers, Executives, Dancers, and Critics in the United States, Canada, Great Britain and the World, Volume 38, Gale (Detroit, MI) 2001.\n\nDictionary of Twentieth Century Culture, Volume 1, American Culture after World War II, Gale (Detroit, MI), 1994.\n\nDouglas, Kirk, Let's Face It: 90 Years of Living, Loving and Learning, Wiley (Hoboken, NJ), 2007.\n\nDouglas, Kirk, The Ragman's Son, Simon & Schuster (New York, NY), 1988.\n\nHalliwell, Leslie, Halliwell's Filmgoer's Companion, 9th edition, Charles Scribner's Sons (New York, NY), 1988.\n\nInternational Dictionary of Films and Filmmakers, 4th edition: Volume 3, Actors and Actresses, St. James Press (Detroit, MI), 2000.\n\nKirk Douglas: An American Film Institute Seminar on His Work, Microfilming Corporation of America (New York, NY), 1977.\n\nLegends in Their Own Time, Prentice Hall General Reference (New York, NY), 1994.\n\nMcDonogh, Gary W., Robert Gregg, and Cindy H.

His screen persona has been characterized by resoluteness and ferocity, the typical ingredients of his steadfast, driven heroes, and occasionally the psychological foundation for his formidable and relentless villains. These variations on a theme of perseverance have pleased audiences who have come to know the Douglas face as a movie icon—eyes blazing with anger or resistance, teeth clenched in determination, a distinctive cleft in his firmly planted chin.\n\nFollowing a brief Broadway career and Navy service during World War II, Douglas made his movie debut in a supporting role as the ineffectual district attorney husband of Barbara Stanwyck in Lewis Milestone's melodrama The Strange Love of Martha Ivers. After appearing in another half-dozen features, Douglas earned major stardom as an unscrupulous boxer who punches and claws his way to the top in Mark Robson's Champion, a performance which earned him an Oscar nomination for Best Actor.\n\nThe next few years saw him star in a series of exceptional films by front-rank directors, including Michael Curtiz's Young Man with a Horn, Raoul Walsh's Along the Great Divide, Billy Wilder's The Big Carnival, William Wyler's Detective Story, Howard Hawks's The Big Sky, Vincente Minnelli's The Bad and the Beautiful, and King Vidor's Man without a Star. This series of memorable, strong-willed protagonists fixed the Douglas image firmly in the public's consciousness.\n\nThe actor's intense portrayal of the tormented Vincent van Gogh in Minnelli's Lust for Life was followed by that of an idealistic French officer fighting a corrupt military bureaucracy during World War I in Stanley Kubrick's powerful antiwar film Paths of Glory. Three years later, he again starred for Kubrick in the historical epic Spartacus as a slave who leads an insurrection against the powerful and oppressive leaders of Imperial Rome. In both Kubrick films, Douglas plays a strong-willed, noble leader who suffers an unjust defeat.\n\nAlthough the 1950s was his most accomplished decade, Douglas continued to star as a rugged individual in respectable, entertaining movies in the 1960s, including David Miller's Lonely Are the Brave, Minnelli's Two Weeks in Another Town, and John Frankenheimer's Seven Days in May. Nevertheless, many of his film projects of that era—including some through the auspices of Bryna Productions, his own production company—were of mediocre quality.\n\nAt the end of the 1960s, Douglas starred in what he has referred to as a trilogy: Martin Ritt's The Brotherhood (as a Mafia leader), Elia Kazan's The Arrangement (as an advertising executive), and JosephL. Mankiewicz's There Was a Crooked Man (as a prison inmate obsessed with escaping). The films were of wildly uneven quality, to be sure, but they served as evidence that Douglas, fast approaching 60, remained a sturdy, effective leading man.\n\nNone of his theatrical films since then has made such a strong impact, although as a canny veteran actor Douglas remains a convincing and watchable presence, effortlessly communicating resolve and urgency. Among his better late-career credits are Tough Guys, in which he was cast one final time with longtime friend and frequent co-star Burt Lancaster; the television movie Remembrance of Love, portraying a concentration camp survivor who has an emotional reunion with a woman he had loved decades earlier, in the Warsaw Ghetto; and another television movie, Amos, in which he played an elderly man living against his will in a nursing home.\n\nFinally, in his seventies, Douglas has launched a new career as a writer. In 1988, he published his autobiography, The Ragman's Son, and since has written several novels.\n\n—Bill Wine, updated by Audrey E. Kupferberg"
