From the previous October, when he was unveiled as the new 007, through to his first scenes on location in New Orleans and his final shot in New York, Moore describes his whirlwind journey as cinema's most famous secret agent. Taking in the sights of Jamaica before returning to Pinewood Studios, Moore's razor wit and unique brand of humor is ever present.\n\n1 out of 5 stars\n\nTrite\n\nBy Steve on 18-12-19\n\nThe Sound of Music\n\nThe Making of America's Favorite Movie\n\nBy: Julia Antopol Hirsch, Robert Wise\n\nNarrated by: Donna Postel\n\nLength: 5 hrs and 58 mins\n\nUnabridged\n\nOverall\n\n4 out of 5 stars 5\n\nPerformance\n\n3.5 out of 5 stars 5\n\nStory\n\n4 out of 5 stars 5\n\nThe Sound of Music is a classic film cherished in the hearts of millions. It won five Oscars, including Best Picture, upon its release in 1965. This tribute to a Hollywood classic is sure to thrill everyone who's ever sung along to \"My Favorite Things\" at one of the many screenings that still take place today. Through interviews with the cast and crew, in-depth access to memorabilia and personal scrapbooks, and archival research at Fox Studios, author Julia Antopol Hirsch reveals the lively human story behind the making of the von Trapp family film.\n\n5 out of 5 stars\n\nSound of music\n\nBy Linda T on 06-06-24\n\nHail to the Chin\n\nFurther Confessions of a B Movie Actor\n\nBy: Bruce Campbell, Craig Sanborn\n\nNarrated by: Bruce Campbell\n\nLength: 7 hrs and 49 mins\n\nUnabridged\n\nOverall\n\n5 out of 5 stars 286\n\nPerformance\n\n5 out of 5 stars 264\n\nStory\n\n5 out of 5 stars 261\n\nOne of my dad’s favorite jokes about getting older was: “I went out for coffee when I was twenty-one and when I got back I was fifty-eight!” I get what he meant now. Time flies. My first book, If Chins Could Kill: Confessions of a \"B\" Movie Actor, was published back in 2001 and it chronicles the adventures of a “mid-grade, kind of hammy actor\" (my words), cutting his teeth on exploitation movies far removed from mainstream Hollywood. This next book, an “Act II” if you will, could be considered my “maturing years” in show business, when I began to say “no” more often and gravitated toward self-generated material. Taking stock in the overall quality of my life, I fled Los Angeles and moved to a remote part of Oregon to renew, regroup and reload. If that sounds tame, the journey from Evil Dead to Spider-Man to Burn Notice was long, with plenty of adventures/mishaps along the way. I never pictured myself hovering above Baghdad in a Blackhawk helicopter, facing a pack of wild dogs in Bulgaria, or playing an aging Elvis Presley with cancer on his penis - how can you predict this stuff? The sheer lunacy of show business is part of the fun for me and I hope you'll come along for the ride.\n\n5 out of 5 stars\n\ndissapointed it ended.\n\nBy martin camp on 12-01-18\n\nI Loved Her in the Movies\n\nMemories of Hollywood's Legendary Actresses\n\nBy: Robert Wagner\n\nNarrated by: Robert Wagner\n\nLength: 7 hrs and 24 mins\n\nUnabridged\n\nOverall\n\n4.5 out of 5 stars 23\n\nPerformance\n\n4.5 out of 5 stars 21\n\nStory\n\n4.5 out of 5 stars 21\n\nIn a career that has spanned more than 60 years, Robert Wagner has witnessed the twilight of the Golden Age of Hollywood and the rise of television, becoming a beloved star in both media.

Signing her first contract in 1925, she was crowned an MGM star four years later and by the mid-1930s was the most popular actress in America. In the early 1940s, Crawford's risky decision to move to Warner Bros. was rewarded with an Oscar for Mildred Pierce. This triumph launched a series of film noir classics. She teamed with rival Bette Davis in Whatever Happened to Baby Jane?, proving that Crawford, whose career had begun by defining big-screen glamor, had matured into a dramatic actress.\n\nTrue Indie\n\nLife and Death in Filmmaking\n\nBy: Don Coscarelli\n\nNarrated by: Don Coscarelli\n\nLength: 11 hrs and 51 mins\n\nUnabridged\n\nOverall\n\n5 out of 5 stars 50\n\nPerformance\n\n5 out of 5 stars 42\n\nStory\n\n4.5 out of 5 stars 42\n\nBest known for his horror/sci-fi/fantasy films including Phantasm, The Beastmaster, Bubba Ho-tep, and John Dies at the End, now Don Coscarelli’s taking you on a white-knuckle ride through the rough and tumble world of indie film.

In Movie Freak, his enthrallingly candid, funny, and eye-opening memoir, Gleiberman captures what it's like to live life through the movies, existing in thrall to a virtual reality that becomes, over time, more real than reality itself.\n\nDaughter of the Dragon\n\nAnna May Wong's Rendezvous with American History\n\nBy: Yunte Huang\n\nNarrated by: Rebecca Lam\n\nLength: 13 hrs and 16 mins\n\nUnabridged\n\nOverall\n\n0 out of 5 stars 0\n\nPerformance\n\n0 out of 5 stars 0\n\nStory\n\n0 out of 5 stars 0\n\nBorn into the steam and starch of a Chinese laundry, Anna May Wong (1905-1961) emerged from turn-of-the-century Los Angeles to become Old Hollywood's most famous Chinese American actress, a screen siren who captivated global audiences and signed her publicity photos—with a touch of defiance—\"Orientally yours.\" Now, more than a century after her birth, Yunte Huang narrates Wong's tragic life story, retracing her journey from Chinatown to silent-era Hollywood, and from Weimar Berlin to decadent, prewar Shanghai, and capturing American television in its infancy.\n\nBecause He's Jeff Goldblum\n\nThe Movies, Memes, and Meaning of Hollywood's Most Enigmatic Actor\n\nBy: Travis M.

The guy primarily plays jazz music these days, but is more famous than ever. Actor, pianist, husband, father, style icon, meme. Goldblum contains multitudes, but why? What does he mean?"
