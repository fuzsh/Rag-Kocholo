Montgomery also directed the film, and he brought an interesting creative touch to it: Marlowe is mostly (aside from a couple of reflections) unseen by the audience; the tale is told via his first-person point of view, with the camera seeing what he does. Coupled with the fact that the film has almost no instrumental soundtrack, this production was especially unique for, and certainly ahead of, its time.

Costarring with Montgomery are Audrey Totter, Lloyd Nolan and Tom Tully.\n\nPredator v Prey\n\nBBC America, 8pm\n\nNew Series!\n\nThis new nature series follows the fortunes of the world’s most formidable apex predators — including lions, wolves and crocodiles — as they pit themselves against fearsome opponents such as bison, wildebeest and elephants in the ultimate battle for survival.
