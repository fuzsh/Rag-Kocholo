        "text": "Hair today\n\nDoug lost his beard, nose hair (interesting), ear hair and lower eyelashes, but that seems to have been due to the radiation. His head hair thinned a bit, but that was likely due to the stress of several weeks without eating. He took Cisplatin, which is not supposed to cause hair loss.\n\nWe can't imagine that someone like Michael Douglas had an easier or harder time than the rest of us. On the one hand, he's not hurting for money and he and his wife could devote all their energy to his care 24-7. On the other hand, not only did the disease threaten his life, but it threatened his way of life. I doubt it was easy on him and he can be an inspiration to others.\n\nStill, I'd rather be married to Doug. . .\n\nHair today\n\nDoug lost his beard, nose hair (interesting), ear hair and lower eyelashes, but that seems to have been due to the radiation.

Michael Douglas had a great chance to put Head and Neck cancer in the spot light for longer then it has been. Yes, there was alot of conversation about it when it was first mentioned that he was going to have to do treatment. But now, it is slightly mentioned and will soon be forgotten by the Media.\n\nI would only be guessing, but he might have had a tumor on his tongue, we really won't know, because I haven't seen anything about a Primary location. We know that if there was a tumor on his tongue, there might have been surgery to remove the tumor and maybe part of his tongue, which was my case. He might have chosen the Radiation and Chemo only and avoided the chance of having trouble speaking if he had part of his tongue removed. After all, he makes his living acting and the chance of not speaking correctly would be a big issue for him.\n\nAs mentioned, he might have already searched this board or others like it. He may have only lurked and learned and never posted. As mentioned above, if he did post, it wouldn't be under his real name as suggested, he would be followed, etc.\n\nHe might be an inspiration to some people, but the real people that inspire me are the people of this board. We have a boat load of people here that inspire each other and the new people that come here for advice when they first learn that they have cancer and are like a deer caught in a car's headlights. Their world has just been shattered into a zillion pieces, and we have already experienced it. So having people here that have survived this disease willing to give of their free time to help guide and advise the newer patients is all inspiring to me. You all know who you are as you post often and give sound advice. There isn't enough room here for me to post all the names of you. I Salute You.\n\nMy Best to Everyone Here\n\nWasn't sure what to say\n\nI have been thinking about this for a little bit.
