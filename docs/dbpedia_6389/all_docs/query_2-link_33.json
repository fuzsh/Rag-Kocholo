        "text": "The most spectacular sight in Ant-Man comes at the very beginning. An official-looking meeting in a big expansive room, filled with faces we’ve seen from other Marvel movies, is suddenly joined by what must be a ghost. It’s Michael Douglas, but not the goateed, 70-year-old Michael Douglas cast in Ant-Man. It’s Michael Douglas from the post–Wall Street, pre–The Game era. It’s impossible. It’s kind of head-spinning.\n\nAnd it could have not happened at all. To de-age Douglas 30 years for an opening scene set in the late 80s, the Ant-Man production team enlisted Lola VFX, the same company that magically shrunk Chris Evans in the early scenes of Captain America: The First Avenger. The team had already proven they could do stunning work, but director Peyton Reed admits there was a backup plan, too. Douglas, his goatee shaved and motion-tracking dots all over his face, was on set to film the scenes, but there was also a body double who looked convincingly like a late-80s Douglas. “It was absolutely a safety,” Reed admits. “I was incredibly nervous. If that effect didn’t come off, it’s the first scene in the movie . . .”\n\nHard as it was to convince the Captain America audience that the beefy actor seen in the trailers started as a 140-pound wimp, de-aging Michael Douglas didn’t just require trickery, but a kind of mental time travel. “Everybody knows what Michael Douglas looked like 25 years ago,” Reed says. That meant that specific details had to be included, not just from Douglas but the double, too. “It was always at least going to be some blend of Michael Douglas and this look-alike actor,” Reed continues. “From my standpoint, we wanted to gather as much material for Lola to have at their disposal to create this effect.”\n\nThe Ant-Man team wasn’t exactly lacking for challenges even before the de-aged Douglas idea came up. Director Edgar Wright left the project last May, after spending years developing it, and Reed stepped in just months before filming began, with star Paul Rudd and writer/director Adam McKay still at work polishing the script. Reed, whose previous film was the Jim Carrey comedy Yes Man and who also directed the throwback rom-com Down with Love, seemed about as far from the fanboy-beloved Wright as you could get.\n\nWright and his collaborator, Joe Cornish, are still credited for the film’s story, and critics have made a guessing game of spotting where Wright’s fingerprints still remain. But some of Ant-Man’s best moments—a fight-scene cameo from Anthony Mackie’s Falcon, a series of hilariously rambling montages narrated by Michael Peña’s petty crook, a trippy visit to the “quantum realm”—are Reed’s. The director who spent years developing a Fantastic Four movie and was a runner-up for Guardians of the Galaxy was a long time getting to his superhero movie, and though hewing in many ways to the Marvel house style, Reed has made it his own.\n\nAnd that includes making fun of the movie’s entire existence, starting with its leading man. “The Ant-Man powers are pretty absurd,” says Reed, who has compared the initial skeptical reactions to Ant-Man to what he heard when making Bring It On, a fluffy cheerleader movie now revered as a minor classic. “It’s important to have Rudd at the center of [the film] because he reacts the way the audience does.” Namely, with befuddlement: early trailers show Rudd’s Scott Lang being presented with the name “Ant-Man” and asking, “Is it too late to change the name?”\n\nThat ability to poke fun at superhero tropes has been present in Marvel’s zippy films since the first Iron Man, but last summer’s Guardians of the Galaxy—“What a bunch of A-holes”—brought the self-mockery to a new level. Ant-Man was well underway by the time Guardians became a hit, but its success still paved that road much more for Reed’s own tongue-in-cheek take on a superhero origin story. “I have to imagine that guardians gave Marvel some confidence that they could do some weird stuff and people would still show up,” he says, while insisting, “I think I was always instilled with that feeling from Kevin Feige from the beginning. The worst mistake you can make with Marvel is [to] repeat yourself.”\n\nComing from a guy who’s done a cheerleader comedy, a 60s sex farce, and now a Marvel movie, that’s pretty convincing advice.\n\nHollywood\n\nRobert Downey Jr. Returns to The Avengers, But Not as Iron Man\n\nThe Iron Man star will play iconic villain Doctor Doom in Marvel's next two Avengers movies.\n\nHollywood\n\nKamala Harris Impersonators Didn’t Just Fall Out of a Coconut Tree\n\nA handful of comedians already have the VP’s cadence and laughter just right—and could see their cachet grow as the presidential race heats up.\n\nHollywood\n\nSaturday Night First Look: How the SNL Movie Captures 1975’s Wild Opening Night\n\nDirector Jason Reitman calls it a “thriller-comedy” that counts down to the very first “Live from New York…”\n\nMovies\n\nThe Offer Leonard Nimoy Couldn’t Refuse: “How’d You Like to Have a Great Death Scene?”\n\nThe actor hoped he was done with Star Trek.
