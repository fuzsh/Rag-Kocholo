        "text": "During The View on Wednesday, the news broke that George Clooney wants Joe Biden to step down from the presidential race.\n\nAt the time, Michael Douglas was a guest on the show to talk about his documentary America's Burning about the declining state of the United States. Joy Behar asked the Wall Street star about his thoughts on Biden and the calls for him to leave the race.\n\nShe added that Michael was a staunch supporter of Biden, mentioning that he held a fundraiser at his home for the current president at his home. \"This is such a tough one,\" he told the panel.\n\nClick here to follow the Mirror US on Google News to stay up to date with all the latest news, sport and entertainment stories.\n\nREAD MORE: George Clooney demands longtime pal Joe Biden step down and rages 'he can't win battle against time'\n\nREAD MORE: Whoopi Goldberg slammed by Piers Morgan as she pretends to spit after saying Donald Trump's name\n\n\"I adore the guy, you know 50 years of public service, and this just happens to be one of the elections that’s so crucial,\" he continued, \"I don’t worry necessarily today or tomorrow but a year down the line...I worry. I am concerned.\"\n\nAlyssa Farah Griffin saw the opportunity to ask about the breaking news involving Michael's fellow actor. \"I do want to mention George Clooney came out with an op-ed calling for Biden to step aside saying the stakes are too high for future generations,\" she said, \"What do you - would you like to respond to that?\"\n\n\"I think it’s a valid point,\" Michael admitted. \"I’m deeply, deeply concerned. Especially it’s difficult because the Democrats have a deep bench, I mean they got a lot of heavy hitters. A lot of talent.\"\n\nPanelist Whoopi Goldberg later came to the defense of Biden. \"You can’t win in this game I really feel bad for him,\" she said.\n\n\"If he can’t do the job and we see he can’t do the job then he’s gotta go but until I can see that I’m gonna support him,\" Whoopi added.\n\nGeorge Clooney was vocal in the op-ed he wrote for the New York Times. The actor wrote: \"We are not going to win in November with this president. On top of that, we won’t win the House, and we’re going to lose the Senate. This isn’t only my opinion; this is the opinion of every senator and congress member and governor that I’ve spoken with in private. Every single one, irrespective of what he or she is saying publicly.\""
