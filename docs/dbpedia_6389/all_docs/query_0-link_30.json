        "text": "Jim McKay:\n\nWhen I was a kid my father used to say our greatest hopes and our worst fears are seldom realized. Our worst fears have been realized tonight. They have now said there were eleven hostages; two were killed in their rooms yesterday morning, nine were killed at the airport tonight. They're all gone.\n\nWalter Troger:\n\nI didn't like Issa of course because of what he was doing but I could have liked him when I met him elsewhere. He was not violent, I would have even trusted him in his word, not his compatriots and his partners. They were, like, what we say in German, Galgenvogel, gallows birds. But Issa was different from them.\n\nJamal Al Gashey:\n\nI'm proud of what I did at Munich because it helped the Palestinian cause enormously. Before Munich the world had no idea about our struggle but on that day the name of 'Palestine' was repeated all over the world.\n\nGad Zahari:\n\nSuddenly the reality of what's happening hits me. \"As I get closer he orders me in this direction, but as he's giving me the order I push his Kalashnikov aside and run. He shoots two or three rounds at me, but I don't think about the shots, I just run. I run for about 70 metres and then jump over the village fence and into the first building I see.\n\nHimself - Narrator:\n\nWith the help of members of the East German team the terrorist leaders had entered and studied the Olympic village in the days prior to the attack. Now they headed straight for the Israeli men's quarters.\n\nHimself - Narrator:\n\nThe negotiators knew nothing about the terrorists except what they saw. Three were visible at any one time. Issa, the leader, his face blackened with shoe polish. Tony, second in command, usually at the first floor window wearing a cowboy hat. And another man guarding the balcony door.\n\nUlrich K. Wegener:\n\nThen there was silence. And I told the minister...\"I think I have to go to look for what the police is doing. \"And then I went to the captainof the police company there... and said, \"Are you going to do something? You have to move your people there.You pull out the hostages or whatever, you know... and do something. \"They didn't do anything. \"I have no orders,\" he said. It was... It was a really tragic story... and so we could only look, you know. And when after... You could hear them yelling, you know."
