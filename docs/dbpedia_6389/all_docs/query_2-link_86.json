        "text": "Standing in a garden area outside L.A.’s Four Seasons hotel, a patient and generous Michael Douglas is acting the role of movie star.\n\nLooking trim and handsome, he smiles warmly as a group of foreign journalists crowd around him like giddy, star-struck fans trying to snap souvenir photos of him.It’s not surprising that Douglas knows how to act like a movie star.\n\nThe son of Hollywood icon Kirk Douglas, he has been in the public eye since the early ’70s, when he starred with Karl Malden in the hit TV series “The Streets of San Francisco.” In 1975, he won an Oscar for producing the Oscar-winning “One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest.”\n\nDouglas, 62, won an acting Oscar for the 1987 film “Wall Street,” and has amassed an impressive and wide-ranging filmography that includes political films (“The China Syndrome”), romantic adventures (“Romancing the Stone”), thrillers (“Basic Instinct”), cautionary tales (“Fatal Attraction”), black comedies (“The War of the Roses”) and risky character studies (“Falling Down”).\n\nHis latest film, “King of California,” falls into the latter category.\n\nWith a relatively small budget ($10 million) and a first-time director (Mike Cahill), “King of California” tells the story of a bipolar dreamer (Douglas) who is reunited with his 16-year-old daughter (Evan Rachel Wood) after being released from a mental institution. The daughter reluctantly joins him in a quixotic hunt for buried treasure.\n\nAfter his frenetic photo shoot, Douglas relaxes upstairs in a hotel suite and discusses his new film, what attracted him to his wife, Catherine Zeta-Jones (besides her looks), and why he works with the United Nations on disarmament issues.\n\nQ: You have two Oscars, more money than you’ll ever need and Catherine. Why do you ever leave home to work?\n\nA: It is tough to get me out of the house. Look at my resume since I met Catherine. It’s dropped off the face of the Earth. My priorities changed. It was all career first, and family second. Now, career is third behind family and the whole disarmament issue.\n\nQ: Besides the obvious, what’s your attraction to Catherine Zeta-Jones?\n\nA: We share the same birthday. We both like golf. We both like to do the crossword puzzle. We both love the news.\n\nQ: Other mutual attractions?\n\nA: Catherine and I seem to have the same pace and tempo. And we both have a strong work ethic and strong family ties.\n\nQ: What was it about this script that got you excited enough to leave Catherine?\n\nA: It was the challenge and the risk. I like flying without a net. That’s the way I’ve been my whole career. A lot of my biggest successes were not perceived as such when we started. This is one of those movies that seems risky, and that’s exciting to me.\n\nQ: And isn’t it true that the audience has to like this guy, which is not easy because he was a terrible father.\n\nA: I have a history of film roles, from “Black Rain” and “Falling Down” to “Fatal Attraction” and “The War of the Roses” in which I played bad guys who audiences accepted and even liked.\n\nQ: How did you get into the disarmament movement?\n\nA: That started around the time of “The China Syndrome.” Through making that movie, I got a sense of the size of one of these warheads and the damage it can do.\n\nQ: Why weren’t you punished for expressing your political opinions in this business? Actors like Tim Robbins and Sean Penn have been targeted by groups who don’t like their politics.\n\nA: I’m probably a little more of a diplomat than they are. I respect and admire them tremendously, but I try to find those areas where we can agree, rather than disagree."
