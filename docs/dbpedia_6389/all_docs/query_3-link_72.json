        "text": "I officially became my father in watching and enjoying “America: The Story of Us” a 12-part, 9-hour documentary-drama television miniseries. The 2010 History Channel production is a fascinating piece that follows a timeline of the United States. Starting with the Jamestown settlers and running through present day (2010) “America” features narration by actor Liev Schreiber. Also included is commentary by dozens of eclectic pundits.\n\n“America” works because it makes a comprehensive history lesson that’s easy to follow. The chronological presentation makes the viewer appreciate and understand things that can’t be done by simply going back to a specific period. The good and bad are equally explored. It progresses as a linear story and allows the viewer to have a better understanding than they would looking back with 2022 eyes.\n\nEpisodes are broken down by the key events they correspond to in time. I found the introduction and Revolutionary War episodes the most fascinating. The visuals used coupled with various experts weighing in gives a great appreciation and understanding of what’s happening.\n\nI also loved the segment on the construction of cities and Americas invention – the skyscraper. It was interesting to learn that New York City almost lost the Statue of Liberty. Even the most ardent of history buffs will find it challenging not to learn a thing or two.\n\nAs Liev Schreiber narrates, we get additional information from an assortment of talking heads. Ranging from Michael Douglas, Tom Brokaw, Buzz Aldrin, and Sheryl Crow – to barely scratch the surface. One can progress at their own pace and would be best advised to start and finish over a weekend or short period for full immersion.\n\nAs we celebrate the July 4 weekend and the nation’s 236th birthday, dial this up for a great lesson in history.\n\n“America: The Story of Us” is available to stream on Amazon Prime."
