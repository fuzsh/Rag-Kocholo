        "text": "After starring in more than 30 films, producing 20 more, winning a best actor Oscar, having had two wives, three children and one divorce, how will Michael Douglas celebrate his 60th birthday?\n\nDouglas has appeared in court twice in 2004\n\nHis face is sometimes more familiar to tabloid readers than cinemagoers.\n\nThe trial of a woman accused of stalking his Welsh actress wife, Catherine Zeta Jones, is just the latest in a string of juicy off-screen stories.\n\nIn July this year the death of his half-brother, Eric Douglas, after apparently mixing alcohol with prescription drugs gave him unwanted publicity.\n\nEarlier in the year a row with Hello! magazine over wedding photographs brought Douglas and Zeta Jones to the High Court in London.\n\nIn the early 1990s he was labelled a \"sex-addict\" and sought treatment in a Los Angeles clinic.\n\nAnd he raised a few eyebrows by divorcing his first wife, Diandra, in June 2000 four months before marrying Zeta Jones - exactly 25 years his junior.\n\nDistinguished career\n\nYet as an actor and producer he has enjoyed a distinguished career as formidable as that of his father, Kirk.\n\nDouglas was labelled a sex-addict by his first wife\n\nAfter odd-jobbing on films and featuring in minor roles during the 1960s, Douglas junior began to make a name for himself in the early 1970s, first of all as a stage actor, then on the small screen.\n\nHis role alongside Karl Malden in the iconic cop show The Streets of San Francisco brought him to the notice of the prime-time viewing public.\n\nHe dropped out of the series when the chance came to produce Ken Kesey's classic novel One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest for the big screen.\n\nThe project had been in the Douglas family for over a decade.\n\nKirk Douglas had played the lead role of Randle Patrick McMurphy in the stage version before buying the rights to the film in the 1960s.\n\nAfter several unsuccessful attempts to make the film himself, Douglas senior was, by this time, too old for the main part and Jack Nicholson filled the space.\n\nOut of his father's shadow\n\nThe 1975 film achieved triple success - critical acclaim, box office success, and five Academy Awards, including best actor, best actress, best picture and director.\n\nAs executive producer of the film, Douglas junior stepped out of his father's shadow.\n\nDouglas starred alongside his wife in the 2001 film Traffic\n\nIn a 1986 interview with Playboy magazine he admitted it was hard being the son of an icon.\n\n\"I saw my father as a gladiator, nailed to a cross, as an artist who cut his ear off and he would be shown doing these superhuman things,\" he said.\n\n\"I'd think, 'How can I possibly be a man? How can I be the man this man was?'\"\n\nIn contrast to his Kirk's all-American hero image, the younger Douglas began to produce controversial films, often with a political message.\n\nThe most notable of these was the China Syndrome where he starred with Jane Fonda in the story of an attempted cover-up at a nuclear power station.\n\nThe film was well-received and gained extra poignancy when, two weeks after it opened, there was a partial meltdown at the Three Mile Island nuclear plant near Harrisburg, Pennsylvania.\n\nSex and violence\n\nDuring the 1980s Douglas managed to mix lightweight, crowd-pleasing box office hits - Romancing the Stone, Jewel of the Nile - with hard-hitting social critique in Oliver Stone's Wall Street.\n\nIt was for his portayal of Gordon Gekko, the corporate raider with his \"greed is good\" mantra, in Wall Street that Douglas finally won the best actor Oscar.\n\nIn the early 1990s Douglas once again courted controversy.\n\nThis time he starred in a several films portraying sex and violence in a way many found unacceptable.\n\nErotic thriller Basic Instinct sparked outrage in 1992 for its stark sexual content.\n\nA year later he was mired in controversy over Falling Down, the story of an unemployed man enduring a psychotic episode and taking it out on anyone who crossed him.\n\nThe film was criticised for encouraging violence and intolerence.\n\nSince then Douglas has taken on a string of high-profile roles without hitting the heights of Wall Street, nor courting the controversy of the China Syndrome.\n\nA Basic Instinct sequel is one of Hollywood's most talked-about potential projects. It remains to be seen whether Douglas will reprise one of his most violent, sexually-charged roles or, in his sixtieth year, choose to act his age."
