        "text": "Harry Demsky would prove to be as challenging to our researchers as he was to his son.\n\nMichael had heard that Harry came to America to avoid serving in the Russian Army, and that the family's original surname was not Demsky, rather it was Danilovich.\n\nBut beyond that, Michael knew nothing about his grandfather's roots, and for a time, neither did we.\n\nThere were no records of Harry at Ellis Island, so we couldn't determine when he came to America or where he came from.\n\nWhat's more, Harry had two brothers who immigrated to the United States, Movsha and Abram, and we couldn't find an arrival record for Movsha.\n\nHappily, our luck changed with Abram, and the passenger list for a ship that arrived in New York in April of 1911.\n\nPlease read who was on board.\n\n\"Danilovich, Abram, age 42.\n\nOccupation, dealer.\n\nNationality, Russia.\n\nRace or people, Hebrew.\n\nMm-hmm.\n\nLast permanent residence, Chausy, Russia.\"\n\nChausy, Russia.\n\nYou know who that is?\n\nThat's your father's uncle.\n\nOh, wow.\n\nThat is the arrival of your great-uncle Abram, recorded with the surname Danilovich, arriving in New York.\n\nChausy is your ancestral hometown.\n\nWhoa.\n\nIt was then part of the Russian empire.\n\nDid you know, have you ever heard of this place Chausy?\n\nNever heard of that.\n\nChausy, wow.\n\nToday, Chausy is a small town in Eastern Belarus, but when Michael's relatives lived here, it was part of the notorious Pale of Settlement, the vast region where Russia confined and severely restricted its Jewish population.\n\nJews in the Pale were second class citizens, subject to continuous, sometimes violent discrimination, and though it's often difficult to learn about their lives, with Michael's ancestors, we were fortunate.\n\nWe found photographs of the neighborhood in Chausy, where we believe his family lived.\n\nIn essence, it was the town's Jewish quarter.\n\n90% of the residents there were Jewish.\n\nOkay.\n\nIt's the ghetto, right?\n\nYes, it's the ghetto.\n\nWhat's it like to learn this?\n\nWell, it just gives you a better understanding of how it all worked, you know, even then, how it all worked, I mean.\n\nI'm sure they all, Jews like to be together, but not together that much.\n\nBy law, Jewish people in the Pale were barred from owning land and denied access to higher education.\n\nAs a result, most worked as tradespeople, but as we researched Michael's family, we discovered that his great uncle Movsha found a more unusual way to support himself, crime.\n\n\"Under the decree of the Mogilev district court is wanted a Chausy townsperson, Movsha Danilovich- Uh-huh.\n\nAccused under Article 1654.\n\nAnyone who knows the whereabouts of Danilovich is obliged to inform the court where he is.\"\n\nYour great-uncle, Michael, was a wanted man.\n\nThis is wild.\n\nThis is, this is, do we know what he is wanted for?\n\nWe do, but have you ever heard this story?\n\nNo, no, I never heard.\n\nWell, as I said, we didn't find any firm record of his arrival to the United States, so it's possible he may have been in Russia as late as 1906, which is when that article was published.\n\nRight.\n\nIt's also possible that he'd already left when this wanted notice was issued, because he was...\n\nSounds more likely.\n\nAccording to this newspaper in 1906, Movsha was accused of what we would call armed robbery.\n\nWe don't know anything further about the case, so it's possible that he was innocent.\n\nHowever, as we dug deeper, that possibility seemed increasingly unlikely.\n\nRecords show that five years earlier in 1901, Movsha was imprisoned for a different crime.\n\nWhat's more, we discovered that Michael's grandfather, Harry, was born Girsh Danilovich, and that he, too, had trouble with the law.\n\nNovember 12th, 1903, Girsh Danilovich- Mm-hmm.\n\n\"Alexandr Perepechka - Good.\n\nAnd nobleman, Alexandr Benkovsky charged under articles 13 and 1642.\"\n\nMy God, this is a little gang here.\n\nYour grandfather Harry's real name was Girsh Danilovich.\n\nHe was charged with robbery like his brother, but not with a weapon.\n\nOkay.\n\nThis is your grandfather, no family stories about this?\n\nIncredible, no, never.\n\nI guess this is probably the part that they were not proud about when they first came to this country.\n\nYeah, we left that behind.\n\nYeah, yeah.\n\nWhat's it like to learn that?\n\nWell, it just all kind of comes to life.\n\nThey must have been struggling to make ends meet, but it looks like somewhat of a professional gang.\n\nIt doesn't seem like a one-off, it seems like they live and survive by robbery.\n\nYou know, the records at Ellis Island are pretty good.\n\nYeah.\n\nSo we're thinking, how come these guys don't show up?\n\nNeither of them?\n\nProbably aliases.\n\nI'm kind of reeling with this information, but sure, makes all the sense in the world, they were- And let's go back to the story your father told you, that his father came to America to escape the army.\n\nRight.\n\nHe came to America to escape- - Prison, yeah.\n\n- Prison, yeah.\n\nThis is blowing my mind a little.\n\nThis is really blowing my mind."
