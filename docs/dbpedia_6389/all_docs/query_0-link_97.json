Check back often to see how that’s going. Should be fun.\n\nIn other news, the long lists for the National Book Award came out today, and in the fiction category, there is a list of ten novels. My friend Amber Sparks was the first person I saw speak up about this on FB, noting that short stories are vital, there were a lot of great books released this year, the novel is so etc., etc., etc. I couldn’t agree more, because if you couldn’t tell, I kinda like short stories. Taking Amber’s lead, I put together a list of the story collections released in 2016 that I’ve covered so far on this blog, plus a bunch that are in my queue, plus a few that I either blurbed (making them ineligible for this project, as I’ve read them already) or published myself at Moon City Press. I regret this already—it’s going to take a long time to tag all of these names and books—but here’s the list:\n\nAmie Barrodale You Are Having a Good Time\n\nRick Bass For a Little While\n\nZack Bean Man on Fire\n\nLucia Berlin A Manual for Cleaning Women\n\nKatie Chase Man and Wife\n\nDinah Cox Remarkable\n\nHelen Ellis American Housewife\n\nAmina Gautier The Loss of All Lost Things\n\nAmy Gustine You Should Pity Us Instead\n\nBenjamin Hale The Fat Artist\n\nKatherine Heiny Single, Carefree, Mellow\n\nRobert Hellenga The Truth About Death\n\nBecky Hagenston Scavengers\n\nAllegra Hyde Of This New World\n\nJohn Jodzio Knockout\n\nCarmen Lau The Girl Wakes\n\nTara Laskowski Bystanders\n\nRobert Lopez Good People\n\nSara Majka Cities I’ve Never Lived In\n\nMaryse Meijer Heartbreaker\n\nLuke Mogelson These Heroic, Happy Dead\n\nAnna Noyes Goodnight, Beautiful Women\n\nJodi Paloni They Could Live with Themselves\n\nSusan Perabo Why They Run the Way They Do\n\nRebecca Schiff The Bed Moved\n\nAmber Sparks The Unfinished World\n\nPlus a bunch I have in my queue:\n\nKirstin Allio Clothed, Female Figure\n\nMatt Bell A Tree or a Person or a Wall\n\nBrian Booker Are You Here What I’m Here For?\n\nPolly Buckingham The Expense of a View\n\nJeff Fearnside Making Love When Levitating Three Feet in the Air\n\nMark Haddon The Pier\n\nBritt Haraway Early Men\n\nDustin M.

A ton of short story collections published in 2016—and this is just the ones I know about—and none of them made the long list for the NBA. Good thing I’m here, Story366.\n\nToday I’m knocking off one of those books from my queue, Alexander Weinstein’s Children of the New World, fresh off the presses from Picador. As I have a night of son-tending to do and I have to get this written, I had to wrench myself from the book, as I read five stories already, a couple more than I usually read before settling on one to write about. I could have written about any of them, but I’m going to write about the title story, as I like doing that, and I like this one a whole lot.\n\n“Children of the New World” is about this couple, Mary and the unnamed protagonist/narrator, who are getting on in years in the real world—she’s ten years past menopause—but decide to be pilgrims, volunteering to sojourn out into the New World, which in this story means some sort of virtual environment where any experience, memory, or even feeling can be downloaded and made a part of their lives, via a kind of three-dimension, real-feeling solid hologram. Almost immediately, they choose to become pregnant in the New World, having one, then two kids, June and Oscar. They have a loving and fun-filled life with their kids, taking them on vacations, sledding on fresh snow, just playing with them, smelling them, enjoying the little moments. If they think of these kids as some computer files, virtuosities that aren’t real, they never let on: June and Oscar are their kids like my kids are my kids.\n\nAlong with all the joys of being parents, Mary and our narrator, like any parents, also need a break sometimes, occasions on which they hire New World babysitters, or simply put their computers to sleep. And like in the real world, sometimes New World adults venture down roads to more adult pleasures, and sometimes, those pleasures bring about nasty viruses to their computer. This is what happens to this adventurous couple when they experiment with some New World sex sites, sites that don’t necessarily feature sex as we know it, but virtual experiences where you stand in the middle of a room and have air blow on you, or rooms where you lie on a table and experiences the feeling of a thousand fingertips tickling you, both of which produce climaxes. Weinstein has a lot of fun with these details, making up some pretty creative shit that’s way more interesting than anything I ever saw in that Michael Douglas movie, Disclosure.\n\nIn any case, what sucks about having a virus on their computer is that’s where June and Oscar are, or where they’re stored or live or whatever. It’s not that June or Oscar get all wanky, but the kind of perverted ads that come with viruses start showing up in our heroes’ house. It starts with a pixelated man in their bathroom, offering to please Mary in 69 different ways. Then a well hung guy offers to grow the narrator’s dick three inches. It gets worse from there. A call to customer support suggests the unthinkable: Rebooting the system, which will get rid of those nasty, uninvited viruses, but at the same time, erase June and Oscar.\n\nYou’ll have to read the story to see what happens, what this couple chooses, but I see this story as a metaphor, for all of us who have computers, all of us who do things we’re not supposed to on those computers, all of us who lose things because we did. Aren’t our files—our stories, our pictures, our emails—like our children? Doesn’t it kill us to work so hard creating something, be it an idea, a memory, or a labor of love, and find out it’s irretrievable? Well, yes and no. I’ve lost entire short stories, entire picture albums, and I’m guessing that it’s nothing like losing a child. But that’s why it’s a metaphor because it’s like losing something so vital. I’m on board with you, Alexander Weinstein. And I’m also glad I have a Mac, where that shit just doesn’t happen.\n\nAll of the stories I read in Children of the New World have some sort of sci-fi conceit like in its title story. “Rocket Night” is a “Lottery”-type story about a community that shoots the least desirable kid in the school off in to space, one day every fall. “The Cartographers” is half-Gibson and half-Saunders, about a hapless tech exec who sells downloadable memories, getting high, in a way, on his own supply. Etcetera. I love this brand-new collection from Alexander Weinstein and I’m so glad he’s coming to Springfield to read at Missouri State this January. I know my students are going to love him as much as I do. Go get this book now."
