        "text": "My name is Michael Kirk Douglas,\n\nand this is my Vanity Fair career timeline.\n\nMy father did a movie in Israel called Cast a Giant Shadow,\n\nI think it was about 1966, 67.\n\nI was a PA, but they were doing one scene\n\nand the local driver couldn't drive a Jeep up to the spot\n\nthat had to be exactly for the camera angle.\n\nSo my father's, Oh, Michael, throw a uniform on,\n\nget in there and you can do it.\n\nI went, Oh my god.\n\nSo I had total stage fright and everything else\n\nbut I was a pretty good driver.\n\nTo this day, of all the things I've done,\n\nI think Dad is as proud about the fact\n\nthat on the first take, I whipped that Jeep up\n\nand I hit my spot just like that.\n\nAnd that was the beginning of the end.\n\nYou didn't come home last summer.\n\nI was in jail.\n\nYou got a great body.\n\nI think you're freaky.\n\nHail, Hero was about a young guy\n\nwho did not want to go to Vietnam War,\n\nand he was a hippie, had long hair.\n\nWhat would happen if every soldier on both sides\n\nwould just try to love instead of hate?\n\nAnd in the picture, my father Arthur Kennedy\n\ncuts my hair off.\n\nSo because of continuity, they had to make a wig for me\n\nso I could have my short hair underneath.\n\nEverybody's so worried about how long hair is.\n\nNobody seems to care how long war's lasting.\n\nJust as the picture started,\n\nthey fitted me with my long-haired wig,\n\nand I looked exactly like Veronica Lake.\n\nIt comes to my eyes like this,\n\nand it was one of my first movies\n\nand I thought my career was over.\n\nNow, Senator, don't all wars just stink?\n\nYes, of course they stink.\n\n[Announcer] The Streets of San Francisco,\n\na dramatic new television series from ABC.\n\nMichael Douglas is Inspector Steve Keller.\n\nThe Streets of San Francisco,\n\nI was mentored by Karl Malden.\n\nKarl Malden taught me everything I knew.\n\nWe did 104 hours of television together over four years.\n\nTV was a wonderful experience for me\n\nbecause you're tied into a series,\n\na one hour show, that's eight and a half months nonstop,\n\nsix days a week because we were on a location.\n\nThat series allowed me to get comfortable with the camera.\n\nIt was the most important job in my life\n\nin terms of what I learned about both acting and producing.\n\n(laughs) How about it you creeps, you lunatics,\n\nyou mental defectives?\n\nOne Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest is one of the great,\n\ngreat novels that ever was written by Ken Kesey.\n\nI read it in 20th century American Lit,\n\nand by chance, my father had optioned that book\n\nand had it adapted into a play\n\nand had done the play on Broadway in 1960.\n\nUnfortunately, the play was not a big success,\n\nso he was unable, even though he tried for five or six years\n\nto make it into a film.\n\nMeantime, I had begun my acting career.\n\nI'd done two or three bad movies,\n\nwas sliding into doing episodic television,\n\nFBI, medical center,\n\nand Dad decided he was going to sell Cuckoo's Nest.\n\nI said to him please don't sell it,\n\nit's such a great project,\n\nlet me run with it for a little while.\n\nI promise to get you your money back,\n\nproducing credit, and I'll work hard to get you\n\nas the star, the actor in the picture.\n\nWell, the fact is that Dad did not get the part\n\nin Cuckoo's Nest, which he harbors to this day.\n\nHe's gonna be 102 in December.\n\nWhat he is happy about, because it was such a great,\n\ngreat piece of material\n\nis that we won five Academy Awards.\n\nJack Nicholson who played his role did a great job,\n\nand my father who shared in the backend\n\nproducing deal that I had\n\nprobably made more money on that picture\n\nthan any film he's ever done.\n\nWould you please do me the courtesy\n\nof looking at me when I'm speaking to you?\n\nThis is exactly what I'm talking about.\n\nIf you had any kind of manners, if you (screams).\n\nRomancing the Stone was one of the first efforts for me\n\nafter I won an Oscar as a producer,\n\nbut was still just a television actor\n\nfrom Streets of San Francisco\n\nwho was trying to make it in the business as an actor.\n\nWhat a comeback (laughs).\n\nSo they really didn't want me.\n\nIt was really up to chance when we found Kathleen Turner,\n\nand we were able to get the picture done,\n\nand I could play the part of Jack Colton.\n\nRomancing was one of those great scripts\n\nwhich read well but you had no idea how difficult\n\nit was to actually make.\n\nAnd so, I will be eternally grateful\n\nto Kathleen Turner as my female co-star.\n\nI don't know any woman who could have gone through\n\nwhat I put her through on that location.\n\nYou ba-- (screams)\n\nOh shit.\n\nSo where's your wife?\n\nWhere's my wife?\n\nFatal Attraction, it was the ultimate nightmare,\n\nthe story about an adulterous fling.\n\nI just want to be a part of your life.\n\nOh, this is the way you do it, huh?\n\nShowing up at my apartment?\n\nWell, what am I supposed to do?\n\nYou won't answer my calls,\n\nyou change your number.\n\nI'm not going to be ignored, Dan.\n\nI worked very closely with Sherry Lansing\n\nand Stanley Jaffe, our producers.\n\nWhen we went out to try to get a director to do the picture,\n\none director who said he wanted to do it,\n\nBrian De Palma, said that he would do it\n\nbut he didn't want Michael in the role,\n\ndidn't think I was right.\n\nMy producing partners Stanley and Sherry said,\n\nwell, he's in.\n\nI remember we brought the picture to France,\n\nand everybody said the French said,\n\nWell, we all have mistresses.\n\nThis is not a problem.\n\nEvery single French wife dragged their husband to that movie\n\nand it was a huge success.\n\n[Alex] I guess you thought you'd get away with it.\n\nWell, you can't.\n\nSee that building?\n\nI bought that building 10 years ago,\n\nmy first real estate deal.\n\nSold it two yeas ago, made $800,000 profit.\n\nIt was better than sex.\n\nWall Street, I really am totally indebted to Oliver Stone.\n\nOliver Stone supposedly was looking for actors\n\nthat had some kind of business acumen.\n\nI was a producer at the time,\n\nso I guess he thought I knew something about business.\n\nAnd that was a great part combined\n\nwith a wonderful director, great ensemble cast,\n\none of those nice moments where it all comes together.\n\nAlso, I remember not so fondly,\n\nOliver's intensity in trying to bring out\n\nthe best performance.\n\nA lot of times, directors will be like a patriarch figure\n\ndealing with their children, the actors,\n\nwho are vulnerable and try to support them.\n\nOliver always, as a Vietnam vet,\n\nalways had a feeling of being in the trenches.\n\nTrench warfare out there, pal.\n\nHey George.\n\nSo there was a war factor\n\nwhen you'd finish some of those scenes.\n\nThat Oscar particularly meant a lot to me.\n\nAs a second generation with a father\n\nthat was a big movie star in his time,\n\nit really allowed me for the first time\n\nto step outside of his shadow,\n\nand it gave me the confidence that I was standing on my own.\n\nGreed, for lack of a better word, is good.\n\nYou're in over your head.\n\nMaybe.\n\nBut this is how I'll catch my killer.\n\nBasic Instinct, the (bleep) of the century.\n\nWe all wanted to do a slam dance.\n\nIt was kind of getting to be a kind of conservative time,\n\nand we did it, man.\n\nPaul Verhoeven was the right guy for the job,\n\nand that picture sorta speaks for itself.\n\nEverybody has their own story.\n\nJeanne Triplehorn who plays my psychiatrist in the picture\n\nremembers looking at the call sheet for the day and saying,\n\nHmm, 12 pairs of ripped away panties.\n\nI wonder what this means.\n\nYou were right.\n\nIt was the (bleep) of the century.\n\nWhat would happen if I called Sydney Wade\n\nand asked her to be my date\n\nto the State dinner on Thursday evening?\n\nThe president can't just go out on a date.\n\nI'm having dinner at the White House.\n\nAaron Sorkin, Rob Reiner, Annette Bening was great.\n\nJust for me, a dream because it was the ideal\n\nliberal democratic president.\n\nI always thought Rob as the producer and the director\n\ngeared the picture more to be kind of a political statement\n\nwhen in fact it was a wonderful romantic comedy.\n\nWould you like to dance?\n\nYeah, I guess.\n\nI mean, yes, sir, I'd love to.\n\nAs a result of that picture,\n\nI got invited to the White House for a dinner\n\nfor the French president, just like the movie,\n\nwith President and Mrs. Clinton.\n\nThank you, oh, thank you so much.\n\nSo Behind the Candelabra was an emotional moment for me.\n\nI had just come out of stage four cancer.\n\nI was in remission, I was alive.\n\nI'd lost at least two of my friends\n\nto the same kind of cancer during that period,\n\nand I was offered this wonderful opportunity\n\nto play this character.\n\nAnd because we had to wait for a while\n\nfor me to gain weight, it gave me a longer rehearsal time\n\nto get the piano down and all of that.\n\nI will forever be grateful to Richard LaGravenese,\n\nhe's a screenwriter, to Steven Soderbergh and to Matt Damon.\n\nMatt Damon, who's a great kisser by the way,\n\na great kisser.\n\nGood morning.\n\nYou need to be skillful, agile, and above all,\n\nyou need to be fast.\n\nHold on, you gave her wings?\n\nAnd blasters.\n\nSo I take it you didn't have that tech available for me.\n\nNo I did.\n\nHere seems to be a movie that worldwide\n\nbrings people together, makes them laugh,\n\nhave a good time, and reminds us about the magic\n\nof movie making.\n\nI am into beginning of my 50th year in performance art.\n\nIt was really bad in the beginning, really bad.\n\nMy father would be the first one to tell you.\n\nAnd just grinded away.\n\nSo for all those out there who don't feel like\n\nthey've got a natural talent,\n\njust listen to what I'm telling you.\n\nGrind away, you'll get there."
