        "text": "Carys, 21, and Dylan, 23, supported their father at a New York City screening of political documentary 'America's Burning'\n\nMichael Douglas is getting some support from his kids.\n\nOn Wednesday, July 10, the actor, 79, made a rare red carpet appearance with his daughter Carys, 21, and son Dylan, 23, as they attended a screening of his new documentary America’s Burning in New York City.\n\nThe trio posed for photos on the red carpet at the DGA Theater, with Carys and Dylan matching in white, while Michael looked smart in a blue shirt, navy blue suit jacket and dark gray pants.\n\nCarys sported a white blazer and white satin skirt, while Dylan wore a crisp white shirt and a matching textured blazer and pants.\n\nMichael shares the siblings with his actress wife Catherine Zeta-Jones. The Wall Street star is also dad to son Cameron, 45, whom he shares with his ex-wife Diandra Luker.\n\nRelated: Michael Douglas' 3 Children: All About Cameron, Dylan and Carys\n\nBack in May, Michael shared a snap of himself on vacation with Catherine, 54, Carys and Dylan to mark Mother’s Day.\n\n“Happy #MothersDay to you all, and especially you darling! You deserve it and we all love you so much @catherinezetajones ❤️,” Michael captioned the photo.\n\nAhead of Michael’s appearance at the America’s Burning screening, the couple attended the British Grand Prix in England on Sunday, July 7, with Wednesday star Catherine sharing a selfie of the duo at Silverstone Circuit.\n\nThe PEOPLE Puzzler crossword is here!

We look forward to bringing this film and its message to people all over the country.”\n\nAmerica's Burning is in movie theaters from July 12.\n\nFor more People news, make sure to sign up for our newsletter!"
