        "text": "Executive produced by Academy Award winners Michael Douglas and Barry Levinson, America’s Burning probes the economic reasons for today’s hate and division. The middle class is shrinking. The American Dream’s promise of great economic mobility for all is being killed off by a ruthless corporate elite that is strangling American capitalism.\n\nNarrated by Michael Douglas and written and directed by NYT bestselling writer David Smick, the film suggests the middle class feels disenfranchised and these feelings have grown in recent decades under both political parties. The film’s extensive cast includes James Carville, Leon Panetta, James Baker and Larry Summers, and explores how a civil war could easily lead to a financial crisis that takes us all down. But the film is also hopeful and highlights America’s history of resilience. And how its best days could still lie ahead if its people do the hard work of understanding each other."
