        "text": "Michael Douglas thinks that Benjamin Franklin is a little like Elon Musk and Warren Buffett.\n\nDouglas came to this realization after portraying the iconic inventor, and revolutionary statesman, in a new series.\n\nBased on the book by Pulitzer Prize winner Stacy Schiff, the limited series Franklin explores the little-known story of one of the greatest gambles of his career.\n\nAt age 70, without any diplomatic training, Franklin convinced France — an absolute monarchy — to underwrite America’s experiment in democracy. The eight-year French mission stands as Franklin’s most vital service to his country, without which America would not have won the Revolution.\n\n“For me, I sort of felt [there are some reasonable] Elon Musk comparisons [because he’s a guy who is] slightly out there, but also you're wary of him because he was so bright and so knowledgeable on so many things, but he was very charming and tended to put people at ease,” says Douglas, a two-time Oscar winner.\n\nAs for his comparison to Buffett, Douglas feels that even though he was very, very smart, Franklin had a ‘folksy’ quality to him, just like the renown CEO of investment firm Berkshire Hathaway BRK.B .\n\nWhat drew him to the role, says Douglas, was because, “I’m at a point in my career where I’m trying different things. And now in close to a 60-year career, I’ve never done period. So, I wanted to see how I’d look in tights,” he says with a laugh, and adds, “Thank God I didn’t have to wear a wig.”\n\nDouglas also says, “Well, I guess I've always sort of been attracted to those characters who are in the gray area. I've never been attracted to true heroes. I mean, I always like people to have a little dark side to them because it just seems like a reality.”\n\nWhat Douglas discovered about Franklin is that, “He was very well aware of his position. He was very bright, but was a little bit of a rascal, too. He was a little bit of a philanderer, liked to imbibe, big flirt, and yet, had a wonderful ability, in terms of negotiating. So, he played himself up knowing his position pretty well.”\n\nHe goes on to say, “I enjoyed the ability he had to seduce. He could identify very quickly the foibles of somebody, whether it was flattery or something else, and knew how to bring the best out of them and make them all feel like [they were] Ben’s best friend, even though he had other ulterior motives.”\n\nThere were some interesting surprises for Douglas as he learned more and more about Franklin, he says. “He didn’t go to school past 12 years old. So, everything he knew was self-learned. He was a voracious reader at a very early age, which played a big part. He was involved in the printing business, which is one of his earlier things. Then, of course, he started his own newspaper, and then the number of inventions that we have besides electricity. He covered so many areas.”\n\nHe wasn’t great at everything though, says Douglas, “ I do not think being a good husband was one of his high points because he was very much involved with himself.”\n\nDiscussing what he took away from the project, Douglas mentioned that, “For me, it was a new appreciation for our Constitution and democracy; realizing how fragile it really was and how close we came to it not coming about.”\n\nThe timing of the Franklin debuting now is perfect, says Douglas, as he believes that the series can be, “a reminder in this day and age — and particularly this [election] year — of how precious democracy is.”"
