        "text": "THE 1972 OLYMPIC GAMES IN MUNICH should have been a peaceful and very joyous occasion. For the Federal Republic of Germany it was considered to be the ideal opportunity to demonstrate to the world how the country had changed since the atrocities committed during The Holocaust and the events of the Second World War. Significant also, is the fact that it was first time the Olympics had been held in the country since the 1936 Berlin Games, when what is often considered to be the „Most Controversial Olympics‟ were unashamedly exploited for the promotion of Nazi ideologies (Guttmann, 2002: 53 - 72). Hence, the opening ceremony of the Munich Games was a landmark event in world affairs and a tremendously emotional occasion (Alon, 2006 cited in Salzmann, 2006; Lalkin, 1972 cited in OCGXXO, 1974; Macdonald, 1999). In the country that was responsible for the deaths of over five million European Jews between 1933 and 1945 (Niewyk, 2000), an all-Jewish Israeli team marched through Munich‟s Olympiastadion holding the Star of David flag. The significance of this Israeli representation was commemorated by the West German NOC who chose to hold a special Olympic Memorial Service in Dachau at the location of the first Nazi concentration camp (Macdonald, 1999; OCGXXO, 1974).\n\nThe extraordinary impact of this artwork does not become apparent until some links are made to instances in Olympic history, signalled in the composition, to world political history. Consequently there are many tangents in this chapter which are followed for interest in their artistic relevance, and partly to satisfy curiosity. Unfortunately, the legacy of British foreign policy i.e. a desire to have an empire, seems to be implicated quite messily on this particular account of Olympic sport. Additionally, the persistent issues of anti-Semitism and middle-Eastern terrorism, from Nazism to Islamic extremism, all raise their heads through artistic inference in this artwork. The thought that Olympic sport and politics might ever be separated may be just a dream when the implications of The African Pearl of ’72 are realised fully. Therefore, the task of this chapter is to point to some of these instances to consider the powerful and critical implications of the Olympic artwork as presented.\n\nSports matter. Today sport is one of the most enduring social events that humans from across the world participate in, no matter their race, religion or gender. Moreover, the biggest of all those sporting events is the Olympic Games, which is held every four years. The modern version of the Games was founded by Frenchman Baron Pierre de Coubertin and first took place in Athens in 1896. New Zealand first competed alongside Australia as Australasia in London 1908 and Stockholm 1912. Following the games of 1916 which were cancelled due to World War I, New Zealand has competed as a sovereign nation since Antwerp 1920. Since 1908, over 1200 New Zealanders have competed at the Olympic Games, winning more than 100 medals. That performance in itself makes New Zealand one of the most successful nations in Olympic history on a per capita basis. That statistic alone underscores the relationship between the Olympics and national identity, as an embodiment of New Zealanders believing they ‘punch above their weight’ on the world stage. Benedict Anderson wrote about the imagined community, where the nation is imagined because it is impossible for every citizen to know each other. This research has found that sporting teams like the All Blacks and the New Zealand Olympic Team are perfect avenues to help create this imagined community. New Zealand’s national identity is not fixed, it has evolved, but the one mainstay of that identity is the sense of being an underdog on the world stage. The research has found that over the past three decades New Zealand governments have increasingly woken up to the importance of high-performance sport and following the disappointment of the 2000 Sydney Olympic Games, funding was increased, which has led to better results and more medals. Today New Zealand athletes are funded on a per-capita basis just as well as many other nations we would compare ourselves with. New Zealand politicians have been quick to associate themselves alongside sportsmen and women and often speak about the close link that exists between sport and identity in New Zealand. However, unlike Australia, New Zealand does not have a national sports museum, and also unlike Australia, and the United Kingdom, New Zealand legislation does not allow for free-to-air television coverage of games of national significance. New Zealand does not adequately showcase its sporting history, and this has the potential to negatively affect the importance New Zealanders place on sport and the Olympic Movement as an important part of its national identity. Ultimately this research has found that the New Zealand Olympic Team epitomises what it means to be a New Zealander and has found that across multiple levels of analysis, the Olympic Movement has significantly contributed to the development of New Zealand’s national identity. More broadly, the Olympic Games have become a key avenue in which that national identity can be projected to the world."
