        "text": "This article originally appeared in the April 1992 issue of Architectural Digest.\n\n“Michael has two prime criteria for accepting a part,” says his wife, Diandra Douglas. “A good script—which is the basis for any good movie. And the opportunity for stretching his range.” Those criteria have been met with such films as Coma, The China Syndrome, Romancing the Stone, Fatal Attraction, and The War of the Roses. When he takes on a film as producer, she says, he looks for “projects with a conscience, some relevance to pressing social issues.” Douglas was coproducer of One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest, which won the Oscar for Best Picture.\n\nIn 1984 Douglas was in preproduction on A Chorus Line, with two more New York-based projects in the works—Fatal Attraction and Wall Street (1987), for which he would win an Oscar for Best Actor. He agreed with Diandra that some time on the East Coast would be productive for the whole family.\n\nThe Los Angeles antiques dealer and designer Craig Wright had flown East with the couple, and together they sat on folding chairs in several potential residences watching the light change and listening to the room sounds. Wright had helped Diandra furnish the couple's estate in Santa Barbara (see Architectural Digest, April 1988), and Diandra says she never considered working with anyone else. “There were actually two schools of thought on New York,” Wright recalls. “Diandra, who was homesick for Europe, was ready for it. But from Michael's point of view, this move was an experiment, and he was somewhat alarmed to perceive that the apartment in which they were going to spend a trial year was going to take eight months to renovate.”\n\nEndowed, as are some of his heroes, with what is either a sureness of instinct or a romantic recklessness, Michael Douglas had proposed to Diandra after an eight-week courtship. She, in her own way, is equally reckless—or equally instinctive. Both the apartment and the estate were virtually the first properties that a realtor had taken her to see, and in both cases Diandra had scarcely bothered to shop further. “In coming to New York, I had a very specific and non-negotiable shopping list,” she recalls. “I didn't want to see any modern buildings. I wanted tons of natural light and a feeling of closeness to nature. We had a young son who was used to the freedom of a house—I was used to it—and we didn't want to feel confined. What else? High ceilings, fireplaces, rooms that would be both welcoming and formal. In essence,” she says with a smile, “this was as close to Paris as I could get without crossing the Atlantic.”\n\n1 / 5\n\nIf the park outside the window can't be mistaken for the Tuileries, the Douglas residence does have a rich, Neoclassical patina. Wright and his client aimed to balance the intrinsic grandeur of the space with a sense of warmth appropriate to the life of a young family. They gutted the bedrooms, kitchen, entrance hall, and library to accommodate—invisibly—those true servants of a princely modern house, its electronic systems. French furniture was, on the whole, too forbidding, both in price and in seriousness, so they focused instead on early-nineteenth-century Russian, which was “cleaner of line, more architectural, and less stuffy.”\n\nThey loved the Edwardian woodwork, which gave the rooms their “old New York character” but which were, says the designer, “too dark and academic.” So the paneling in the dining room received a sponged and glazed faux-marbre finish. The original mahogany doors from 1906 were bleached and given ebonized detail in keeping with the Russian mood. And a Baltic palette—the nacreous colors one associates with winter light and the consumption of caviar—was used for the living room.\n\n“As we went along,” remarks Diandra, “the effect of all that dove, ivory, oyster, and pearl struck us as a bit too decorous and chilly. I didn't want the drawing room of an old duchess. So we got daring and had some fun. We used our collection of classical torsos and Roman pottery—mostly gifts from my mother—as the excuse for Pompeian walls, and we copied the frescoes from a photograph of the Villa dei Misteri. Now,” she concludes, ”I think that color is the single most luxurious element of the rooms.\n\n“This is our ‘kit,’” Diandra adds with a nod toward her palatial double drawing room. It has been furnished with some choice Russian mahogany chairs and bureaus, a grand piano, Aubusson rugs, Hudson River School paintings, classical sculpture, a magnificent bureau à cylindre by Roentgen, and a chaise longue with gilt claw feet, upholstered in faux-leopard. “We've been fine-tuning it for eight years,” says Diandra Douglas. “It's a process of seasoning the décor rather than of finishing it, because I'm sure it will continue to evolve. But everything was bought with the idea that when we move, the ‘kit’ will move with us. I'm uncomfortable with the idea of following trends—and in particular the trend of doing things over from scratch every few years. It's not by replacing your possessions that you find an identity. You need a sense of the past.”\n\nDiandra Douglas's sense of the past comes from a restless and artistic European childhood. Her family summered in Venice and lived in an archduke's Moorish castle on Majorca. Her mother—an archaeologist and sportswoman—was Colette's neighbor in Paris. “It was a milieu in which no one had decorators,” she offers. And from this milieu Diandra distilled a confidence in her own style that seemed precocious to the people she met as a young bride in Hollywood. “I was accused of being too grown up,” she laughs. “At any rate, being too grown up definitely left you feeling out of place in the Los Angeles of fifteen years ago. For all its glamour, it can have the claustrophobia of a small town—its one horse being the film business. Michael and I both wanted more social texture, more reality, especially for our son.”\n\nPerhaps taking her accomplished mother as a model, Diandra embarked in New York on a career in film that didn't exploit Michael's fame or clout. She found a partner and started a company that has produced documentaries for the Smithsonian, the Metropolitan Museum of Art, and Time Warner. Her current project is a film biography of ceramist Beatrice Wood, the muse of Marcel Duchamp. “The documentary is my real love,” she says. “My mission has been to make the experience of art accessible, through film, to people who would never have the chance to visit museums or to meet artists firsthand.”\n\nMichael Douglas has his own full house of diverse projects. This spring he costars as an “elegant spy” with Melanie Griffith in Shining Through, a World War II love story. He plays what his wife calls a “low-down, aggressive and mixed-up cop” in Basic Instinct, a thriller set in San Francisco, a city familiar to him from the television series The Streets of San Francisco.\n\nAnd what, precisely, is his role in this successful design venture? One gathers that he plays the marginal but key part of the Incredibly Busy Husband—including the check-signing scenes—with the same charisma he brings to the screen.\n\n“He does terrific Craig and Diandra impersonations,” Wright confides, “while periodically threatening to have us both committed.” His wife calls him “our barometer,” adding, “He gives us practical advice. He has a great eye for art, and it was his idea to collect the Hudson River School.”\n\nMore important, perhaps, Michael Douglas was detached enough from the day-to-day frustrations of a complex project to provide what his wife calls “the leavening” for it. It is, after all, only when you're not the producer that you can afford to tell your talent, “There's enough time, there's enough money, let's just be happy.”\n\nRelated: See More Celebrity Homes in AD"
