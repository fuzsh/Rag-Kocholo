        "text": "“This time, no one can accuse me of ripping off Hitchcock.” Brian De Palma was in a fairly rough place by the mid-1980s. His films were struggling at the box office and even his most ardent supporters were starting to grow weary of his penchant for pastiche. Body Double, his 1984 riff on Rear Window, was widely considered a new artistic low point. As always, the best way to gauge the prevailing opinion of De Palma is through reading the barometer of the ever-generous Pauline Kael, who wrote in the New Yorker, “He stages the big scenes mechanically, without the zest that used to send them off to horror-comedy heaven.” If even Kael, the most vocal champion of all things De Palma, was losing patience, there was clearly a need to switch things up. De Palma did exactly that, returning to the sort of loosely satiric comedy that defined the earliest part of his career with the mobster spoofery of Wise Guys.\n\nAs indicated by the above quote, offered by De Palma as he ran the promotional circuit for the film, he made this return with a fair amount of petulance. Working from a screenplay co-credited to Norman Steinberg (partially responsible for the gangster movie spoof Johnny Dangerously two years earlier) and George Gallo (his first big screen credit, ahead of creating Midnight Run), De Palma often seems to be deliberately attempting to make an utterly generic movie. Except for the ill-advised use of fast motion to supposedly heighten the comedy of a scene involving a whole neighborhood panicking when a mobster’s car is started, there’s no distinctive stamp of De Palma’s stylistic restlessness.\n\nThe film follows the exploits of low-level mob toilers Harry (Danny DeVito) and Moe (Joe Piscopo). These are the kind of guys with heady dreams of the privilege and authority that come from their underworld occupation, but actually live an existence where their shiny-suited cohorts burst into laughter when the boss (Dan Hedaya) gives them the assignment of picking up his dry cleaning. They try to correct their lot in life when they’re given $10,000 of the boss’s money to bet at the track. Harry decides that there’s no way the longshot they’re charged with putting the money on will win and that he should simply follow his own instincts in placing the bet, collecting the inevitable winnings himself. Of course the plan falls apart in the worst possible way, and Harry and Moe are now stuck explaining why they’re not bring $250,000 back.\n\nWhen both Harry and Moe separately claim responsibility for the decision in order to save the life of their friend, it’s decided that the best way to punish them is by surreptitiously ordering each of them to kill the other, almost making it seem like a buddy comedy version of the previous year’s Prizzi Honor. But that narrative thread is barely followed as Harry and Moe instead run off to Atlantic City, in hopes of hiding out. They’re pursued by feared muscle Frankie “The Fixer” Acavano (Captain Lou Albano, in a casting choice that decisively carbon dates the film as a product of 1986) and seek asylum from old pal Bobby Dilea (Harvey Keitel), now running a posh hotel and casino. The film often seems like it’s striving to farcical highs, but it doesn’t have the energy for that. Instead, it’s a sluggish trod through a succession of dim scenes and tired stereotypes. Compounding the film’s sense of aimlessness, the actors seem desperately lost. DeVito is clearly trying to shake the Louie De Palma influenced stock character he was already stuck with, but he keeps lapsing into rascally aggression. Piscopo is even more problematic, playing individual moments with the saucer eyes and dopily innocent expression of an especially naïve kitten.\n\nKael suggested that Body Double almost seemed like a product of pure spite, De Palma aping classic Hitchcock films and scenes so accurately that it becomes “an assault on the people who have put [him] down for being derivative.” That’s an interesting read, but this is really the effort from this part of his career that reeks of exasperation. It’s devoid of style, stripped away of all the flourishes that the critics had begun to pick at De Palma over. It’s bland enough to view it as De Palma’s bratty counter-argument: “So is this the sort of dull cinema you’d rather see?”"
