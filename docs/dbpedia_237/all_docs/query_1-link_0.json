Guy Watson, known as a wise guy, decides to turn his traveling vaudeville troupe and tent into an evangelistic movement, and make more money preaching than acting. One of the troupers is Mary, a girl left destitute by her father's death. Watson is so good at his new calling that a band of followers build a tabernacle for him to preach his sermons. But when one of his former performers, \"Ma\" Parker dies, Guy prays honestly for the first time in his life, and then tells the congregation of his lying past. Mary, it turns out, is also a crook, and they go to jail with the intent of getting married when they are released, and starting a new honest life.",
