        "text": "This past weekend, Michael and I premiered our 9th film and I performed live for the first time in five years. It required: 1 - Hiring a babysitter for more hours than we could comfortably afford. 2 - Pumping after the kids went to bed and brainstorming ways to get my child to drink milk not directly from me. 3 - Commuting between rehearsals, screenings, performances, and home to nurse, hand off the kids, and spend quality time with them. 4 - Handling a sick child who couldn‚Äôt attend school and soothing a baby awake for two hours at night due to my accidental throat-clearing. On Sunday, we did not rest. It‚Äôs not an option with two small kids. The weekend was hectic but rewarding, and I am grateful for the experience, but Monday brought some much-needed relief. I don't share this to gain sympathy or compete in the exhaustion Olympics‚Äì \"Oh yeah, you only got 4 hours of sleep? Well, I only got -0.37!\" And yes, having children and pursuing my career are my choices. But when I hear stereotypes like \"Millennials are lazy and just don‚Äôt want to work,\" I question what the standard definition of \"work\" really is. Is it measured by a LinkedIn profile, frequent title changes, or hours logged in an office? Or by the income and possessions, it allows one to accumulate? If that's the case, then maybe I am lazy. Maybe I don‚Äôt want to ‚Äúwork‚Äù. Why would I? Curious: How do you define or redefine work üëáüèΩ?\n\nA moment of celebration! I released my first short film! If by released you mean uploaded to YouTube and submitted to six film festivals where I won't hear anything back until next March. I think it's important to do creative projects outside of work as it teaches new lessons, let's you exercise existing skills, and reminds you of things that have fallen below the noise level of the day-to-day. This was a blast to write, cast, direct, and technically problem solve issues during and after filming. Here are a few things I learned. - A film is way tougher to put together than a play. - Creating a believable soundscape is hard. - Rain will start 3-hours earlier than forecast on your shoot day. - No matter how well you plan you will forget something and need to \"fix it in post.\" Thanks to the great people that helped with this project, and if you need a chuckle and have 6:37 free, this might do the trick. And there is nothing that is unacceptable for work in this short comedy. https://lnkd.in/deuSSPyf\n\nShort Film Recommendation - Lights out! (2013) This two-minute short horror film got so popular that its feature version was made. The concept is simple‚Ä¶ You switch off the lights and you are doomed. When you are all alone in your room with walls closing in on you and you dare to switch off the lights don‚Äôt you feel the lingering presence of someone or something watching your every little move? Here‚Äôs the link to the OG short film - https://lnkd.in/gH2ZuSQJ #shortfilm #horror #film #recommendation"
