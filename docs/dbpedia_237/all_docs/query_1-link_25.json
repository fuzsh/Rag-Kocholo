        "text": "Peter Jackson (born October 31, 1961, Pukerua Bay, North Island, New Zealand) is a New Zealand director, perhaps best known for his film adaptations of J.R.R. Tolkien’s The Lord of the Rings and The Hobbit.\n\nWhen Jackson was eight years old, his parents bought an 8-mm movie camera, and he began making short films. He later purchased a used 16-mm camera and, with his friends, began work on what started out to be another short film. It kept growing, however, and, with the aid of a grant from the New Zealand Film Commission, Bad Taste was released in 1987. The comedy-horror movie won acclaim at the Cannes film festival and went on to become a cult favourite.\n\nBritannica Quiz\n\nOscar-Worthy Movie Trivia\n\nJackson followed up with Meet the Feebles (1989), which features puppets and people in animal suits engaging in the seamier aspects of human behaviour, and the zombie film Braindead (1992; U.S. title, Dead Alive), which won numerous international science fiction awards and was said by some to be the goriest film ever made. He then turned to a real-life incident for Heavenly Creatures (1994), about two teenage girls who kill one girl’s mother; the film starred Kate Winslet in her first major role. Its screenplay garnered Academy Award nominations for Jackson and Frances Walsh, his partner. The mock documentary Forgotten Silver (1995) and the ghost story The Frighteners (1996) followed.\n\nFor The Lord of the Rings, Jackson took the unprecedented step of shooting all three installments of the fantasy saga simultaneously, over a 15-month period in New Zealand. In addition to directing the films, he also cowrote the screenplays. The three movies—The Fellowship of the Ring (2001), The Two Towers (2002), and The Return of the King (2003)—were both critically and commercially successful. Jackson received Academy Awards for best director and for best adapted screenplay (which he shared with Walsh and Philippa Boyens) for The Return of the King, which won a total of 11 Oscars, including best picture.\n\nJackson next directed and cowrote King Kong (2005), a remake of the classic 1933 film, and The Lovely Bones (2009), an adaptation of Alice Sebold’s novel about a murdered girl who observes her family and killer from the afterlife. He then returned to the enchanting world of Tolkien with a series based on The Hobbit, the author’s predecessor to The Lord of the Rings. The trilogy comprised An Unexpected Journey (2012), The Desolation of Smaug (2013), and The Battle of the Five Armies (2014). In 2018 he directed the acclaimed World War I documentary They Shall Not Grow Old, which featured never-before-seen footage that Jackson and his team had restored and colourized. His next project was The Beatles: Get Back (2021), a universally praised docuseries about the legendary British band. It focused on the period surrounding the group’s last public performance, an unannounced rooftop concert in 1969.\n\nIn 1993 Jackson cofounded Weta Digital, a visual-effects company that became a leader in the field. Its credits included films by Jackson and others—Weta notably worked on James Cameron’s Avatar—and it received a number of Academy Awards for best visual effects. In 2021 it was announced that the American company Unity would be acquiring Weta’s “tools, pipeline, technology, and engineering talent” for more than $1.6 billion. As part of the deal, Weta’s digital-effects teams would remain a separate entity (WetaFX) with Jackson as the majority owner."
