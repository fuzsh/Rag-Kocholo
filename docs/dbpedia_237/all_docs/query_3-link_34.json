        "text": "Warner Bros. has a new title and new release date for its upcoming Robert De Niro mob movie. The film previously known as The Wise Guys is now titled Alto Knights. The project from director Barry Levinson also has a new release date of Nov. 15, 2024 (back from Feb. 2, 2024).\n\nThe film is one of multiple across Hollywood expected to shift dates amid the ongoing SAG-AFTRA strike, which has shut down production, though insiders say this move is not strike related.\n\nIt was the first movies greenlit under the new Warners regime after Warner Bros. Discovery was formed in 2022.\n\nDebra Messing and Kathrine Narducci also star in the feature, written by Nicholas Pileggi and produced by Irwin Winkler and Jason Sosnoff. The logline states that it “follows two of New York’s most notorious organized crime bosses, Frank Costello and Vito Genovese, and how their separate paths to power place them on a deadly collision course.”"
