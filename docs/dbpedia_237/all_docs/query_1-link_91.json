        "text": "“ As for you, Valiant, step out of line, and we'll hang you and your laundry out to dry. „ ~ Smartass threatening Eddie Valiant.\n\n“ \"Nose\"?! That don't rhyme with \"walls\"! „ ~ Smartass' last words before his death.\n\nSmartass is the secondary antagonist of Disney/Touchstone's 1988 hybrid film Who Framed Roger Rabbit.\n\nHe is the smart, humorous and wisecracking co-leader of the Toon Patrol. He is Judge Doom's second-in-command and right-hand man. He is also the most ruthless and dangerous villain in the film aside from Doom himself.\n\nHe was voiced by the late David Lander, who also voiced The Brickster in Lego Island, and Thumper in Disney/Pixar's A Bug's Life.\n\nBackground[]\n\nDescription[]\n\nSmartass is ranked a sergeant by Judge Doom. He has brown fur, sharp yellow teeth, and a black nose. He wears a buttoned-up light pink double-breasted zoot suit jacket with a gold chain in the left pocket, a white dress shirt with a hot pink bejeweled tie, matching hat, and spats on his feet. His weapon of choice is a revolver. However, in the bar scene, he is shown threatening Eddie with a switchblade. He does not appear to have a smoking addiction like Wheezy, but he does occasionally smoke cigars, as shown in his first appearance.\n\nPersonality[]\n\nThough very sarcastic and contemptuous fitting the definition of his name, Smartass is the straight-man of the group, possessing the most intelligence and self-control and the least \"Toonish\" attitude. While he is very antagonistic in the film, he seems to care about the other members of the Toon Patrol, being the first one to warn them about what will happen to them if they do not control their laughter. He is also quite abusive towards the other weasels when they laugh at something funny. However, like them, he still enjoys a good laugh himself, though he still remains the most serious member in spite of his occasional wisecracking. Furthermore, because of the fact that he is the most serious member, he is also much more ruthless as he clearly takes more pleasure than his men when tormenting others.\n\nHe is also shown to commit frequent malapropisms, such as when he says that a tip on Roger's whereabouts has been \"corrugated\" (\"corroborated\") by several sources, ordering his henchmen to leave no stone \"interned\" (\"unturned\") when telling them to search in Eddie's office for Roger, or when he asks his boss Judge Doom if they should \"disresemble\" (\"disassemble\") the bar in search of Roger.\n\nHistory[]\n\nWho Framed Roger Rabbit[]\n\nSmartass is the secondary antagonist in the film. He is Judge Doom's second-in-command and the co-leader of the Toon Patrol. He is the third weasel to die at the end of the film, even though he does not lose control of his laughter like the others. Upon pointing out a mistake with the lyrics in the song that Eddie \"entertains\" the weasels with, Eddie kicks him in the crotch, sending him flying into the mixer on the Dip machine, where he dissolves and dies, not even getting a ghost. His boss himself would meet this fate shortly afterwards.\n\nDisney Parks[]\n\nIn the related ride Roger Rabbit's Car Toon Spin, here referred to under the bowdlerized name Wise Guy, he can be heard at two points discussing his plans to get rid of Roger Rabbit, such as when Smartass orders Psycho to head to the Toontown Cab Co. to put Benny the Cab out of \"contrition\" (\"commission\") to stop Roger from leaving Toontown. Smartass also appears in the ride itself.\n\nGallery[]\n\nImages[]\n\nScreenshots[]\n\nMiscellaneous[]\n\nTrivia[]\n\nIn etymology, Smartass is a rude way to refer to someone who is smug, sarcastic and generally acts as if they know everything. Like the names of his fellow weasels, this name perfectly fits Smartass the weasel's smug and sarcastic personality, as well as him being smart but not as smart as he thinks.\n\nSmartass is the only weasel whose soul never appeared. This is because it is natural that when a toon dies in slapstick cartoons, their ghost would appear, but a toon getting \"dipped\" would cause them to die in the normal way, without a visible spirit, because all of their paint would be lost, including that of a toon ghost. Otherwise, the ghosts of Judge Doom and the Toon Shoe would have also appeared when they were dipped.\n\nSmartass's name is often changed in some media, often to \"Smarty\", \"Smart Guy\", \"Wise Guy\" or \"Sergeant Needlenose\". This is because the term \"smartass\"(especially the ass part of the name) would be inappropriate for media aimed at children.\n\nAt one point in the movie, Smartass warned the other weasels that they could die laughing as a way to get them to stop. Aptly enough, this is exactly how Stupid, Wheezy, Greasy, and Psycho end up dying. Since Smarty was the only weasel who could control his laughter, he was also the hardest one to kill.\n\nDespite Smartass's high intelligence, he commits malapropisms five times in the film and once on the ride. He either may not care or does not notice his misuse of words or such usage was typical for gangsters of their period. He attempts to impress others with an \"air of education\", as few would actually know the proper words either.\n\nSmartass has the most dialogue of all of the weasels in the film.\n\nIn the third draft of the film's screenplay, it was Judge Doom's pet vulture Voltaire the one who acted as his second-in-command rather than Smartass. Instead, all the weasels (including Smartass) died from laughter during the film's climax in this version and it was Voltaire the henchman killed with the ghastly green chemical paint thinner solution called the Dip. When Voltaire was scrapped from the film, Smartass was given most of his actions and filled his role as the only henchman killed by the Dip.\n\nWhen Smartass and the rest of the Toon Patrol are chasing Eddie and Roger (who are driving in Benny the Cab), he says \"I'm gonna ram him!\". He references a line that Biff Tannen said in Back to the Future, another popular film directed by Robert Zemeckis.\n\nIn the Latin Spanish dubbed version of the film, Smartass' name was changed to that of Sergeant \"Cola Loca\", which means Crazy Tale in Spanish. This was most likely done because his original name could feel offensive if translated.\n\nNavigation[]\n\nVillains\n\nToon Patrol\n\n(Leader):\n\nJudge Doom\n\n| (Minions):\n\nSmartass | Greasy | Psycho | Wheezy | Stupid\n\nVillains\n\nAnimated Features\n\nThe Evil Queen | Magic Mirror | Honest John | Gideon | Stromboli | The Coachman | Coachman's Minions | Monstro | Chernabog | Zeus | Vulcan | Boreas | Man | Ronno | Aconcagua | Toy Bull | The Wolf | Tetti-Tatti | Willie the Giant | Lumpjaw | Rustlers | Mr. Winkie | Weasels | Headless Horseman | Lady Tremaine | Anastasia Tremaine | Drizella Tremaine | Lucifer | Queen of Hearts | Card Soldiers | Cheshire Cat | Walrus & Carpenter | Captain Hook | Neverland Pirates (Mr. Smee) | Tick Tock | Rat | Si & Am | Maleficent | Diablo the Raven | Maleficent's Goons | Cruella De Vil | Jasper and Horace | Madam Mim | Shere Khan | Kaa | Bandar Log (King Louie) | Edgar Balthazar | Prince John | Sheriff of Notthingham | Sir Hiss | Captain Crocodile | Rhino Guards | Wolf Arrowmen | Trigger & Nutsy | Heffalumps and Woozles | Madame Medusa | Mr. Snoops | Brutus & Nero | Amos Slade | Chief | Horned King | Horned King's Army (Creeper & Gwythaints) | Cauldron Born | Orddu, Orwen & Orgoch | Arawn | Professor Ratigan | Thugs (Fidget & Felicia) | Bill Sykes | Roscoe & DeSoto | Ursula | Flotsam & Jetsam | Percival C.
