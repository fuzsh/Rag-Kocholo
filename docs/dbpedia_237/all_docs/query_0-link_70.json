        "text": "The same, alas, cannot be said for the other two properties FLLW owns on the block.\n\nWe didn't enter 2724-26 W. Burnham St., but it is the only one clad in aluminum siding.\n\n\"The only Wright house in the world with aluminum siding,\" quips Ellsworth as we walk past, toward the westernmost home.\n\nWalking up a staircase that is literally beginning to crumble underfoot, we enter the upstairs apartment of the duplex at 2734 W. Burnham St., formerly home to a drug dealer it seems.\n\nInside, it's a disaster. There is a dropped ceiling, some windows are spray painted black and there is a distinctively unpleasant odor about the place.\n\n\"It's totally stripped,\" says Elsner glumly. \"There is nothing of Wright left in here.\"\n\nBut even she admits that's not entirely true and living for the past 55 years in a Wright house, Elsner has an eye for the details. And she points them out to me, a trademark Wright wood trim along the stairs in the back hallway, the way one entire wall in the kitchen is opened up with windows, the built-in flower boxes outside the windows.\n\nThis one, as bad as it looks won't be impossible to fix. First off, there are those hundreds of drawings, which allow architects to see what Wright intended and how each room and the exterior likely looked. Then, there are the lessons learned from the work at 2714 and at the duplex next door that was restored by the family that currently lives there.\n\n\"A lot of the mysteries have been resolved so this should be easier to restore,\" says Elsner.\n\nAlso, FLLW has earned a second Save American Treasures matching grant -- this one for $400,000 -- that will help cover the cost of restoring 2734. But the group needs to raise the matching funds before work can commence.\n\n\"We have our work cut out for us,\" said FLLW board member Mike Lilek in an issue of the Wright in Wisconsin newsletter. \"This time we move forward with the sure and certain success of our recent restoration. ... The enthusiasm and response has been tremendous, and the feelings people have when they visit the home for the first time speaks volumes.\"\n\nThe goal of FLLW is to eventually acquire and restore all of the properties. They hope to keep a couple open as house museums to help document Wright's American System-Built Homes idea. Anther could be rented out as guest houses, like the popular Seth Peterson Cottage near Wisconsin Dells. The rest would be rented out to provide quality neighborhood housing.\n\nThe project got a public relations boost when it completed work on 2714 in October, just in time to host a visit from members of the National Trust Council, including Richard Moe, president of the National Trust for Historic Preservation.\n\n\"The Council was especially impressed with our visit to the Frank Lloyd Wright System-Built houses on Burnham Street,\" wrote Moe afterward. \"Many volunteers have done a wonderful job preserving the legacy of Frank Lloyd Wright and his many designs.\"\n\nTo help raise money and awareness, tours of the restored house at 2714 W. Burnham St. are open to the public on the second Friday and Saturday and last Saturday of the month from 1 until 4 p.m. Admission is $10. Reservations are not required.\n\nElsner believes the renewed interest in the Burnham houses has help add Milwaukee to the itineraries of Wrightian tourists, too.\n\n\"A lot of people go to Chicago to see what's there, come up to Racine and then go on to Madison,\" she says. \"There wasn't much here to see in Milwaukee. Now they come here to see my house and these -- and now that we have the Calatrava -- they stay overnight. That brings in tourism dollars. And when tourists come to see these they stay for a long time. They are very interested.\"\n\nWright and Like 2010: Poetic Spaces and Quiet Places\n\nThe latest installment of the annual Wright and Like tours of Racine and Kenosha is slated for Saturday, June 5, from 9 a.m. until 5 p.m. On the tour this year are the SC John Administration Building, Wingspread, Isermann House (by Milwaukee's Russell Barr Williamson), William Mason's Mason House, three homes by John Randal McDonald and the Walker House in Racine, the architect of which is unknown. The tour costs $55, $50 for members of Frank Lloyd Wright Wisconsin."
