        "text": "Alfonso Cuarón (born November 28, 1961, Mexico City, Mexico) is a Mexican director and screenwriter who earned an international reputation for fluid storytelling in a versatile range of genres.\n\nCuarón studied film at the Centro Universitario de Estudios Cinematográficos (a school within the National Autonomous University of Mexico) but was expelled for having helped create, as part of a class project, a film that was controversially shot in English instead of Spanish. Though Cuarón feared he would never work in the cinematic arts, he eventually found work in Mexican television as a technician. That position led to television directing, which in turn led to directing movies.\n\nBritannica Quiz\n\nOscar-Worthy Movie Trivia\n\nCuarón’s first feature-length film was Sólo con tu pareja (1991; Love in the Time of Hysteria), for which he also wrote the screenplay. The film was very successful in Mexico and brought Cuarón to the attention of the American director Sydney Pollack, who invited him to direct an episode of his film-noir television series Fallen Angels (1993). Cuarón then directed his first English-language theatrical release, the imaginative A Little Princess (1995), based on Frances Hodgson Burnett’s classic children’s book of the same name. This was followed by Great Expectations (1998), a loose adaptation of the Charles Dickens novel with a Hollywood cast that included Gwyneth Paltrow, Ethan Hawke, and Robert De Niro.\n\nCuarón’s breakout hit, however, came when he returned to Spanish-language filmmaking. Y tu mamá también (2001; “And Your Mother Too”), which he also wrote, tracks the friendship between two teenage boys as they set out on a road trip with an attractive married woman and is simultaneously a vivid commentary on social class within Mexico. The film earned Cuarón his first Academy Award nomination, for best original screenplay. Around this time he became identified, along with his compatriots Guillermo del Toro and Alejandro González Iñárritu, as part of a new wave of Mexican cinema.\n\nCuarón was next invited to direct the adaptation of another beloved children’s book, Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban, the third installment in J.K. Rowling’s Harry Potter series. Not only did the 2004 film nearly match the enormous profits of its predecessors—both of which had been overseen by American director Chris Columbus—but many critics found it more dramatically robust and credited Cuarón with the improvement. His stature rose further with Children of Men (2006), a gripping dystopian narrative based on a novel by British mystery writer P.D. James and starring Clive Owen, Julianne Moore, and Michael Caine. The film earned Cuarón two more Academy Award nominations, for best adapted screenplay and best editing. In 2013 he directed and cowrote Gravity, a visually stunning sci-fi thriller about two astronauts (played by George Clooney and Sandra Bullock) who are set adrift in space after their shuttle has been destroyed. The acclaimed film earned him a number of honours, notably an Academy Award for best director."
