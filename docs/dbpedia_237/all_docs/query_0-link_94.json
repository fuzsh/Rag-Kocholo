        "text": "I know he's not listed but I'd like to toss Sam Peckinpah into the mix. Not the greatest of all time but certainly one of the most copied directors. My father went to school with him and they remained friends until he died so on the rare occasion, I got to see him work and even though you could smell the alcohol on him a mile away? He was one of the most diligent directors I have ever seen and I've seen my share up close and personal.\n\n(3) Frank Capra 1934, 1936 and 1938\n\nOne of my favorite directors. \"It Happened One Night\" (1934) set the basic format for Rom-Coms that is still followed to this day.\n\nFor the time (30s/40s) he was somewhat controversial. The studio thought \"Mr. Deeds Goes To Town\" was a terrible idea for a film; it won the Oscar in 1937. \"Meet John Doe\" (1941) had no 'good guys' at the start of the film. The US Congress actually tried to prevent the release of \"Mr. Smith Goes To Washington\" (1939). And, of course, I must acknowledge \"It's A Wonderful Life,\" the quintessential Christmas film and a lovely slice of Americana; it wasn't a hit in 1946, but resurfaced with a vengeance in the 1980s.\n\nYes, I'm a fan of almost all of the directors on IndieTalks list, but am especially a fan of Eastwood and Spielberg in addition to Capra.\n\nThe best director is the one that makes a film that reaches YOU.\n\nOne of my favorite directors. \"It Happened One Night\" (1934) set the basic format for Rom-Coms that is still followed to this day.\n\nFor the time (30s/40s) he was somewhat controversial.

But certainly, for me, a few in the top ten, responsible for things that were, and that will remain, artistic landmarks, are:\n\nYes, Frank Capra, a particularly American sensibility, little guy v big guy, that, sadly, seems dated, Capra's natural constituency caricatured, co-opted by . . . but I won't start. I love these movies.\n\nIngmar Bergman. I had a film class, some x years ago, on Bergman, and those handful of movies--Wild Strawberries, Persona, The Seventh Seal, Smiles of a Summer Night, The Silence--have stuck in my brain, kind of depressing, but with frames of film you could actually frame and hang on some gallery wall.\n\nKubrick.\n\nSpielberg. To me, just raw pure talent.\n\nAnd I have to throw in David Lynch--a lot of it, to me, kind of inaccessible, but so unlike anyone else. And when he gets you, he really gets you. I have, for example, watched these 17 minutes maybe 10 times. Who else could have made them?\n\n(still buried on Netflix)\n\nedit: and, speaking of loglines, the one above is pretty good\n\nI think there is no best director, only possibly a pick of best directors for a given project. Give two directors the same or virtually the same project and you'll likely end up with two very different movies. Ex: The Cave vs. The Descent. For all of its technical achievements, the original Jurassic Park is kind of a turd. Steven Spielberg is too much of a \"safe\" director for this kind of material. Just about everything he's ever directed is family friendly. Which in and of itself is fine, except the material here features blood-thirsty dinosaurs. An upbeat score that doesn't fit the movie (rejected composer/score had a better idea), terrible pacing, and just about everyone survives including the kids because Hollywood $$ butts in seats. Too bad the movie didn't follow the book."
