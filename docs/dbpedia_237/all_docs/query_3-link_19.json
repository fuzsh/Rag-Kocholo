        "text": "A stretch of downtown Cincinnati is being transformed into 1950s New York for a new movie.\n\n\"The Wise Guys,\" a gangster drama starring Robert De Niro, is currently filming Downtown after starting production in the Queen City late last year, Kristen Schlotman, CEO of Film Cincinnati, confirmed to The Enquirer.\n\nA stretch of Eighth Street near Arnold's Bar and Grill was blocked off to cars and pedestrians earlier this week. Film set equipment and vintage cars with New York license plates could be seen nearby.\n\nCameras rolling:Arnold's temporarily closing to film 'major motion picture.' Here's what we think it is\n\nStars in Cincinnati:Robert De Niro spotted at Downtown restaurant amidst movie filming\n\nArnold's owner Chris Breeden said on social media that the historic bar is being rented out for a \"major motion picture\" and will remain closed until Feb. 21. Breeden couldn't confirm what movie was being filmed, but told The Enquirer Arnold's will serve as a stand-in for a New York \"hangout.\"\n\nIn October, Cincinnati-based casting director D. Lynn Meyers made a call for film extras on Facebook, \"especially anybody who is of Italian descent or who looks like they could be a NY mobster in the 1950s,\" she wrote.\n\nAccording to Deadline, \"The Wise Guys\" follows Vito Genovese and Frank Costello, who ran New York crime families during the mid-20th century. The film will star De Niro as both Genovese and Costello."
