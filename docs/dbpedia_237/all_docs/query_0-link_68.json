        "text": "Happy World Architecture Day! To celebrate the first art form of humanity (according to Hegel), I’m offering you a selection of movies. Filming locations and sets are certainly important for cinema, but sometimes, architecture can be a meaningful part of a movie, either playing a role, creating a specific atmosphere or even foreshadowing the plot. This selection is personal, of course. I think that these movies could be of interest for architecture lovers, both for entertainment, intellectual and aesthetical curiosity but also as food for thoughts about the role of architecture (and architects) in today’s world. But mainly, they are meant to spend a good time in fall and winter’s dull afternoons and evenings, watching elegant buildings and enjoyable designs.\n\nMovies and The City\n\nMost of the movies in this section could also appear in the Social Issue section of this article as class structure is usually an underlying theme of urban-set movies. Cities are indeed a great way to study societies, historical evolutions as well as artistic development. In movies, they can be more than a location and a set, they could play a part and influence the atmosphere.\n\n1&2. Blade Runner / Blade Runner 2049\n\nThe Architecture: In Blade Runner, if the city of Los Angeles receives a dystopian treatment, the locations chosen are highlighting its architectural heritage, especially with the Bradbury Building and the Ennis House, the 1st an icon of Romanesque Revival, the 2nd a wonder of Mayan Revival by Frank Lloyd Wright. In the 2nd movie however, not only the class structure theme is blurred behind sci-fi romanticism, but LA is just theorical. Indeed, the Villeneuve’s movie was not filmed in California at all. The second problem is the use of Brutalism in the futuristic set design. Brutalism indeed seemed futuristic when Le Corbusier played with « beton brut », but still considering it futuristic in 2017 (and even more in 2049!) is quite a lack of imagination. This point aside, we make do with this aesthetic, and the scene in the Exchange Palace of Budapest, with its Beaux-Arts architecture is wonderfully atmospheric.\n\nThe Movies: ⭐⭐⭐⭐ For lovers of dark poetry and slow, aesthetical movies\n\n3. Brazil\n\nThe Architecture: You can trust Terry Gilliam for originality, and the set design of his futuristic city is breathtaking. A special mention for the terrific Espaces d’Abraxas, a Postmodern building by Ricardo Bofill in Noisy-le-Grand near Paris, France.\n\nThe Movie: ⭐⭐⭐⭐ A weird dystopian comedy\n\n4. Good Bye Lenin!\n\nThe Architecture: This bittersweet comedy explores how we can read History on the buildings of a city. The movie uses the contrast between society’s evolution and Berlin’s fixed architecture. The East German aesthetic is visible with views of the Karl-Marx-Allee and the Kino International, a mid-century movie theatre near Alexanderplatz. The overall Ostalgie (the nostalgia for Communist Germany) of the story should really give architects food for thoughts about the historic/societal flexibility of urbanism.\n\nThe Movie: ⭐⭐⭐A witty comedy\n\n5. Inception\n\nThe Architecture: Architects always add something interesting to a plot, and indeed, this movie by Christopher Nolan doesn’t lack of interest. Of course, architecture here is paradoxical. The main example is the M.C. Escher’s Penrose Stairs inspired staircase scene. The bending of Paris’ Haussmannian buildings is also very impressive. Yet, again, in the same fashion as Blade Runner 2049, the architectural imagination is weak. When you can create anything, why would you stick to buildings from the past such as the Department of Water and Power building, designed by AC Martin and Partners in 1965?\n\nThe Movie: ⭐⭐⭐ Visually stunning and creative story\n\n6. Metropolis\n\nThe Architecture: In 1927, Fritz Lang is inspired by the Höchstadt, the vertical city of Ludwig Hilberseimer, as well as of Auguste Perret’s tower-cities. His Babylon Tower-like city is mixing Art Deco, Expressionism, Bauhaus Modern and Gothic in an unforgettable way.\n\nThe Movie: ⭐⭐⭐⭐ An old-school masterpiece\n\nArchitecture and Social Issues\n\nFrom rags to riches is a classic theme for a story, and nothing says more on social issues than architecture. From poor protagonists finding their place or doom in luxurious places to suggested unbreakable walls, directors know how to use locations to tell their message.\n\n7. Crazy Rich Asians\n\nThe Architecture: A romantic comedy is not an obvious choice for an architectural discussion, but a shrewd eye will reveal some interesting finds. The stunning Tyersall Park, for example, a 19th century estate in the botanical gardens, or the contemporary Marina Bay Sands by Moshe Safdie as well as the Supertree Grove, are showing an extensive view of Singapore’s architectural wealth. The Peranakan design and architecture are also superb.\n\nThe Movie: ⭐⭐⭐ Bling Rom-Com for Great Gatsby lovers\n\n8. Knives Out\n\nThe Architecture: I have a weakness for the Gothic Revival mansion that is used for the exterior of Harlan Thrombey’s manor as well as for the Georgian/Colonial Revival of the Ames Mansion used for the interiors. But let’s not forget the Mid-Century-Modern house designed by Walter Pierce chosen for Chris Evans’ character Ransom.\n\nThe Movie: ⭐⭐⭐ Pimp my Clue(do)\n\n9. Le Mépris (Contempt)\n\nThe Architecture: The movie starts in the derelict Cinecittà, the iconic studios of Italian cinema, then moves on in a modern high-rise before reaching its climax in the stunning Villa Malaparte, abandoned at the time of the shooting. This building, created by Adalberto Libera is especially remarkable for its staircase roof, serving as a clever symbol for the characters’ social quarrel.\n\nThe Movie: ⭐⭐⭐ Enigmatic film d’auteur with Brigitte Bardot\n\n10. The Neon Demon\n\nThe Architecture: The movies plays with contrasts. From a gloomy motel in Pasadena to a contemporary house by the beach in Malibu, from cold Industrial spaces to a trippy Neo-Baroque palazzo, the lethal ascent of an ingenue in the model industry is transcended by a serie of fascinating interiors.\n\nThe Movie: ⭐⭐⭐Not your typical horror movie/project Runway episode\n\n11. Parasite\n\nThe Architecture: The house of Parasite is the main character of the movie. Conceived by director Bong Joon-Ho, it has been brought to life by production designer Lee Ha Jun, and not by Namgoong Heonja, the fictional architect of the story. But we can spot many influences from famous architects in the Park House, from Mies van der Rohe’s Barcelona Pavilion to Richard Neutra’s Kaufmann House.\n\nThe Movie: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ The ultimate architectural/dark comedy masterpiece\n\nMovies and Old Stones\n\nArchicture doesn’t always have to be modern and ancient places are certainly giving style to any kind of story. The following flicks are for those who think architecture is a blast from the past.\n\n12. Crimson Peak\n\nThe Architecture: To create Guillermo Del Toro’s haunted house, production designer Tom Sanders made the most of Gothic Revival and the result is magnificent. You can’t take your eyes away from this dark three-story McMansion.\n\nThe Movie: ⭐⭐⭐ Style over substance fans only\n\n13. Emma.\n\nThe Architecture: If you are a sucker for ancient British architecture, you will feast your eyes upon the Elizabethan Chavenage House, the Georgian Firle Place and the stunning Tudor Wilton House.\n\nThe Movie: ⭐⭐⭐⭐Stylish Jane Austen adaptation\n\n14. The Grand Budapest Hotel\n\nThe Architecture: It took cardboard, CGI and a 9-foot-tall model to create the kitsch hotel of Wes Anderson. Mixing Art Nouveau with Eastern Bloc Modernism, the cake-like pink building is a tribute to European grandeur.\n\nThe Movie: ⭐⭐⭐⭐ Delicious pastry, I mean comedy\n\n15. The Handmaiden\n\nThe Architecture: I guess few viewers would concentrate on architecture, but it is worth noting that this movie has some sumptuous sets. The CGI-ed Rokkaen, the main house, is a stunning fusion of Japanese (Meiji period) and Western (Victorian) styles of architecture. Park Chan Wook used it to reflect the Korean identity crisis (and personal crisis of the characters).\n\nThe Movie: ⭐⭐⭐⭐ An hypnotizing erotic thriller\n\n16. Phantom Thread\n\nThe Architecture: This movie has an incredible visual beauty, and the locations are part of it. The Georgian refinement of the Fitzroy Square house has been completed with some Arts and Crafts influences.\n\nThe Movie: ⭐⭐⭐ Fifty Shades of Dressmaking\n\n17. Sunset Boulevard\n\nThe Architecture: There is nothing less iconic than Norma Desmond’s estate in this 1950 classic of film noir. The impressive Mediterranean/Renaissance Revival style of the Phantom House helps adding mystery and darkness to the plot, especially with the bizarre decoration of this interior, which completes its likeness with both a shrine and a mausoleum.\n\nThe Movie: ⭐⭐⭐⭐ All the glamour and danger of Hollywood in one film\n\nArchitecture and Horror\n\nIt’s Halloween soon, so why not including some recommendations for spooky architectural season? After all, the haunted house formula entirely relies on how well its architectural style is able to scare the living daylights out of the viewer!\n\n18. The Room\n\nThe Architecture: This 2019 Belgian movie has nothing to do with the unfamous disaster of Tommy Wiseau. Instead, it is a very interesting twist on the classic haunted house formula. The eerie atmosphere of the Italianate/Colonial Revival style mansion plays a great part in the interesting story.\n\nThe Movie: ⭐⭐⭐ An underrated and entertaining fantastic movie\n\n19. Rosemary’s Baby\n\nThe Architecture: The Gothic facade of the Dakota apartment building is a great appetizer for the movie’s subtile horror. The interiors were filmed in another famous location in Manhattan, The Osborne, which has a more discreet Italian Renaissance/Gilded Age style.\n\nThe Movie: ⭐⭐⭐⭐ Chilling Book-to-Film Adaptation\n\n20. The Shining\n\nThe Architecture: Yes, I have already put The Shining in another of my articles on cinema. But who is going to blame me? This Kubrick’s masterpiece is THE classic reference when it comes to architecture as the main character of a movie. The hypnotizing aerial shots of the Timberline Lodge and its Rustic Cascadian/Neovernacular style will forever haunt you. The even more eerie interiors of the fictional Overlook hotel were inspired by the Ahwahnee Hotel in Yosemite, with its intriguing « Parkitecture », a special style of architecture developed in the early and middle 20th century in the United States National Park Service to create buildings that harmonized with the natural environment. The Ahwahnee’s offbeat interior design actually mixes Art Deco, Native American, Middle Eastern, and Arts and Crafts styles.\n\nThe Movie: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ The house that Jack played in\n\n21&22. Suspiria / Suspiria (2018)\n\nThe Architecture: Two movies that couldn’t be more different, yet based on the same story. What if it had everything to do with architecture? For Dario Argento, the importance of the building is visceral. The red walls of the dance academy are organic, Gothic from the exterior (The Whale House) and an hypnotic mix of Art Deco and Art Nouveau inside. You get lost in his maze, and the reference to M.C. Escher is not insignificant. Luca Guadagnino (who has experience in architecture), on the other hand, chose a darker, colder art direction. Indeed, his dance academy is a bloodcurling Bauhaus-style building, using a customized Grand Hotel Campo dei Fiori. The sets are strongly modernists, with influences from Adolf Loos, Margarete Schütte-Lihotzky and Josef Hoffmann. The result is claustrophobic and many purists were infuriated, but architecture lovers could help to redeem this reimagination of the 70s classic.\n\nThe Movies: ⭐⭐⭐⭐ Artistic horror (but beware of the cultists)\n\n23. Winchester\n\nThe Architecture: The Winchester Mystery House is real. This Californian mansion is supposedly haunted, but its most interesting aspect is its crazy architecture. And when I say crazy, I mean crazy. Indeed, this late Victorian labyrinth was not erected according to the wise directions of an architect, but instead haphazardly connects 7 floors, random doors, stairs and windows, some of them not even serving their original purpose and leading to nowhere.\n\nThe Movie: ⭐⭐⭐ Your average horror flick\n\nMovies and Modern Architects\n\nContemporary architecture and directors are involved in a great love story. So obviously, their favorite buildings and aesthetics tend to have the main role in their movies. And this for the greater pleasure of architecture enthusiasts. But don’t downplay the meaning of architecture inn fiction to a mere fancy background.\n\n24. A Single Man\n\nThe Architecture: I must confess I have a weakness for Midcentury, so obviously, I cannot help but admire the use of the J.W. Schaffer House by John Lautner and its Organic style. It is perfect for this refined take on loneliness.\n\nThe Movie: ⭐⭐⭐⭐ A moving drama\n\n25. Columbus\n\nThe Architecture: The first film of Korean filmmaker Kogonada is hitting architecture lovers right in the feels. This slow-paced visit of the Midwestern Mecca of architecture is an ode to modernism and the buildings are treated like actors. Just enjoy.\n\nThe Movie: ⭐⭐⭐⭐ Humanity and architecture\n\n26-27. De Palma’s Body Double / Passion\n\nThe Architecture: De Palma’s weakness for architecture would need an article on its own, so I’m just offering a dual choice here. Another Modernist marvel by John Lautner, the Chemosphere House is playing a major role in Body Double, its retro-futuristic look almost distracting us from the story. Passion has a wider architectural case, with visions of Frank Gehry’s DZ Bank building, the cyberpunk Sony Center and other stylish locations.\n\nThe Movies: ⭐⭐⭐⭐ Sexy thrillers\n\n28. The Fountainhead\n\nThe Architecture: Ayn Rand modelled her fictional architect Howard Roark on Frank Lloyd Wright, who was supposed to provide architectural designs. But they are the creations of art director, Edward Carrere instead. This film is about ego and that’s a dangerous thing to have when you’re an architect. In a world where more than 6% of CO² emissions are related to construction industry and unethical projects, we need to watch the main protagonist with a critical eye. Because yes, Modernism can hurt.\n\nThe Movie: ⭐⭐⭐ The guide to be a terrible architect\n\n29. Gattaca\n\nThe Architecture: The minimalism and perfectionism of this movie’s aesthetic include some beautiful Modernist locations such as the Marin County Civic Center designed by Frank Lloyd Wright, the Brutalism of the California State Polytechnic as well as the atmospheric Sepulveda Dam.\n\nThe Movie: ⭐⭐⭐⭐ Thoughful science-fiction\n\n30. High-Rise\n\nThe Architecture: JG Ballard, the author of the novel adaptated in this movie, was fascinated by projects such as the Cité Radieuse (or Unité d’Habitation) of Le Corbusier, where tenants would have everything they needed without going out of their apartment buildings. Of course, Ballard’s tale is a grim, disturbing one, very far from the radiant idea of Corbu. In this adaptation, director Ben Wheatley is highlighting the ominous power of Brutalism. He and production designer Mark Tildesley conceived the high-rise as a fusion of The Barbican and John Madin’s Central Library. The shape of the building gives away the fall into madness that the tenants are about to experience.\n\nThe Movie: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ This movie will crawl under your skin\n\nBONUS: The House That Jack Built\n\nThe Architecture: Incomplete at best, gory at worst. The architecture of Lars Von Trier is more a symbol than a structural lesson (so please, don’t follow the path of the protagonist). The movie questions the existential purpose of creating buildings and houses, our obsession with leaving meaningful traces of ourselves in the future. But don’t expect great lessons of life, the movie is a very dark comedy. Yet, its tribute to arts will stick with you for a while."
