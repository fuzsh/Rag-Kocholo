        "text": "Frank Lloyd Wright is an architectural giant. We all know as much about him as we want to, and even a disinterested person knows who he is and why he matters. But I think he matters for the wrong reason. I will conclude this piece with 5 points to make the case.\n\nThe following views were conjured by the Frank Lloyd Wright house currently for sale in St. Louis, MO. As I took these photos of the place, I felt kind of bad that the family is enmeshed in #4 of the 5 Points of Wright.\n\nEvidence of a Crappy Architect\n\nA Google search gives you more evidence of Wright being a crappy architect than you may have time to read. So let’s do just a few bullet points to verify this claim:\n\n• Wright’s most acclaimed work is Falling Water, which the owner referred to as Rising Mildew. This piece neatly lays out some of the problems with the architect and the construction, which led to an $8 million restoration.\n\n• From Architecture magazine, November 1989: “Leaks are a given in any Wright house. Indeed, the architect has been notorious not only for his leaks but his flippant dismissals of clients’ complaint. He reportedly asserted that, ‘If the roof doesn’t leak, the architect hasn’t been creative enough.’”\n\n• This is a good laundry list of 7 things Wright got wrong about design. Which concludes the same way as most articles about his architectural ineptitude do: “genius justified his design mistakes.”\n\nEvidence of a Pioneering Artiste\n\nWhen reading about the engineering defects and customer complaints of Wright-designed residences, I can’t shake the image of a pretentious artiste abusing the largess of monied patrons who are willing to tolerate such behavior in hopes that their lives will reflect the golden light of artistic genius. This is a commonly accepted personality trait of Great Artists.\n\nArchitecture is most certainly an art, but one with inherent limitations because it’s about making structures that people use and depend on. The artistic aspirations of a building must successfully meld with the client’s intended function and the builders’ ability to construct it firmly and accurately (also known as the Vitruvian triad of beauty, commodity and firmness).\n\nCreating a building is much like shooting a film with the architect as director. This cooperative concept was better described by the professor (and inspiring analytical thinker) Witold Rybczynski in his book Looking Around:\n\n“…a building exists not solely as a vehicle for the skills or expression of the architect but as an object with a function… This prevents the architect from developing what is usually the hallmark of an artist: a consistent personal style. Or, at least it should.”\n\nA large percentage of Wright’s visionary reputation centers on complete control of every design detail. The concerns and needs of his clients and builders were ignored and treated like the football a boy threatens to take back if his pals won’t let him be full-time quarterback.\n\nHis art was the most important concern and his contempt for the residents who would live in the piece was palpable. His patrons were hypnotized into overlooking the practical failings of their home for the sake of great art.\n\nWright achieved artistic perfection despite the pesky requirements of owners; he proved that architecture could exist as an uncompromised high art, divorced from the practicality that had previously accompanied it for centuries. This is a revolutionary, pioneering concept.\n\nThe architectural community tends to side with the artistic brilliance of Wright. His vision altered the celebrity and prestige of the profession. To subsequent generations of architects, his technical failings hardly matter because: artistic brilliance. Yet, every architect in his wake will never get away lawsuit-free with the structural crap that Wright pulled off because they don’t lean into the obvious: Frank Lloyd Wright was not an architect. He was a great artist.\n\n5 Points of Wright: Crappy Architect, Brilliant Artist\n\nWith all humility (i.e., I don’t have an architectural or art degree!), I’m requesting a reclassification of Frank Lloyd Wright from Great Architect to The Greatest Artist of the 20th Century. My case is based on these 5 points:\n\n1. He forever changed the rules and boundaries of a classical art form.\n\nHe didn’t let the limitations of the ancient craft of architecture reign in his creativity. The architecture was merely a springboard to hurl him over the boundaries and onto a new plain. If great art inspires others to explore further and forge new paths of expression, he qualifies just from the hordes of architects who have followed in his steps.\n\n2. He created revolutionary art with new materials.\n\nRather than pencil, paint, stone or clay, he used life-sized three-dimensional building materials. Paper or canvas was not the proper place for realizing his ideals; only mixed media could bring his vision to light. The frames for his work measure thousands of square feet mounted directly to the earth, and no one since has been able to use his medium with such assurance and unrestricted creativity.\n\n3. He designed and built his own art galleries.\n\nNot only did he get funding to create amazing pieces that were arranged in powerful installations, but he also designed the perfect buildings to show them in. Many patrons pushed the bounds of propriety by living in his galleries, but they usually came to their senses and vacated before mussing the essence of his work.\n\n4. His galleries become museums.\n\nAfter removing their personal belongings, patrons usually transfer these galleries to foundations who turn them into museums dedicated to preserving his art for the delight and education of present and future generations. That we are able to view his works in their entirety, and that they continue to profoundly move us, proves the museum designations a sound decision. Also, 9 times out of 10, it’s impossible to treat these homes as a regular house sale. No realtor wants to deal with the consequences of social media outrage by letting a Wright be sold as a teardown.\n\n5. The opportunity to own any of his works is increasingly rare and expensive.\n\nWright was insistent that every piece of his work remained as it was designed. To get rid of a table or a light fixture was akin to chopping a toe off Michelangelo’s David. People have accepted this as a wise artistic decision and break their bank accounts to leave everything intact. But when the foolish do let go of individual pieces, they are snapped up by wealthy people who covet them as exceptional works of art. That the pieces retain their beauty and power when removed from the original context is testament to his clarity of vision and mastery of design. A person who owns a Wright piece then displays them as one would any important fine art object. Company would never be allowed to sit in one of his chairs or walk across one of his rugs. That would be as preposterous as using the Mona Lisa as a bulletin board.\n\nThese are towering artistic achievements that make Andy Warhol’s pop culture statements look like birthday candles on a cupcake. Analyzing Frank Lloyd Wright from a fine art point of view places him firmly in the pantheon of centuries of great artists, and with no serious competition for title of The Greatest Artist of the 20th Century.\n\nSt. Louis Addendum\n\nFrank Lloyd Wright did two homes in St. Louis, Missouri. One of them is already a museum. As of 2018, the other is technically for sale. But the details of point #4 above are in play; the effort is toward turning it into a museum.\n\nBrad Pitt & Angelina Jolie visit Falling Water on Thursday, and by Friday afternoon, we’re told about it, and given the classic photo op (above). They took a two-hour tour which ended with a private birthday (his) celebration afterward in the living room.\n\nThis isn’t a case of the media finding out and letting us know. This is clearly a case of Brad and His People making a concerted effort to get this photo and press release out. There are two points that Brad wants in the public consciousness.\n\n#1: “Brad said he had a visual sense of Falling Water but experiencing it in person, hearing the sound of the waterfall cascading under the house and smelling the wood from the fireplace, was better than anything he could have imagined.”\n\n#2: “Brad said he had wanted to experience Falling Water ever since he took an architectural history course in college,” said curator Cara Armstrong. “He and I talked quite a bit about design and art. He was incredibly well-informed about architecture.”\n\nPoint # 1 amuses me. How nice of Brad to share poetic thoughts on his Falling Water experience. It’s almost like enjoying his vacation photos over a glass of cabernet, isn’t it? Such a warm and fuzzy feeling.\n\nPoint # 2 slightly disturbs me. It’s that bit about wanting to see Falling Water ever since he took an architectural history course in college, which was well over 20 years ago.\n\nMr. Pitt has spent the last several years making sure that we know he loves architecture. We’ve heard details of how he personally re-designed the interior of a Hollywood home (and how it left Jennifer Aniston so unimpressed that she didn’t even want the place in the divorce). He’s gone out of his way to repeatedly insert his name into the star glow surrounding his favorite architect, Frank Gehry. And he’s been so successful at representing himself as a design-driven creature that what clothing accessories he prefers bears mentioning.\n\nAt first, I was enamored with Brad’s architectural bent. “Gee, he’s such a huge and handsome star, yet he spends his spare time immersed in architecture… he’s so smart.” But in reality, I know that stars of his magnitude only release that kind of information for precise purposes. And that’s what disturbs me.\n\nHe’s spent years rolling out this architectural image of himself, but other than the remodeled house that Aniston hated, nothing’s come of it. So, when he makes this latest concerted effort to share his Falling Water experience, I get concerned because it could indicate that his architectural id will finally manifest into the physical.\n\nI picture him financing a public building that he designed himself, or donating money to expand an architectural wing of a university in his name, or designing and building an entire village in one of those countries that his girlfriend adopts children from. I also know I’m lending him way more architectural gravitas than he actually has. He’s a movie star, an actor who enjoys acting like an architect…\n\nThen the mailman delivers my current Netflix selection, The Fountainhead. Gary Cooper as a barely-disguised Frank Lloyd Wright antagonized by his secret patron/love interest Patricia Neal. The movie was just finally released on DVD, which I consider a big deal. Brad Pitt probably does, too.\n\nAnd then it hits me!\n\nMr. Pitt wants a Fountainhead remake with him and Jolie!\n\nRather than having to make good on all his publicly-declared architectural aspirations, he can just act like the ultimate architect. So, he trots his girlfriend/co-star out into the snowy woods across from Falling Water for the photo op, sends out the press release, and in a few weeks he’ll be in the executive office of a major movie studio getting the financial green light for this project.\n\nThis idea would be the perfect resolution to his “I want to be an architect” desires, as well as a brilliant career move. Plus, I’d much rather he re-do The Fountainhead than actually foist upon the world a building he designed. So, here’s hoping for the win/win."
