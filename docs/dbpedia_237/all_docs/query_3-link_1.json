Pictures began work on the film in May 2022 and gave it the greenlight that August. Nicholas Pileggi wrote the script and Barry Levinson directed the film starring Robert De Niro in a double role.[4] In October 2022, Debra Messing and Kathrine Narducci joined the cast.[5][6] In January 2023, Cosmo Jarvis joined the cast.[2]\n\nThe production used vehicle vinyl wraps on 1950s-era cars and trucks to make the vehicles look new in the film.[7] Filming took place in December 2022 in Ohio. The production shut down part of US 35 in Greene County,[8] as well as SR 123 in the greater Cincinnati area before moving to the suburbs of Cincinnati.[9] In October 2023, the film was re-titled Alto Knights.[10]\n\nRelease\n\n[edit]\n\nThe film is set to be released on March 21, 2025.[11] It was originally scheduled to be released on February 2, 2024, taking over the original release date of Warner Bros. Pictures Animation's Toto, and then on November 15, 2024.[12][10] On October 24, 2023, Variety reported that, because of the 2023 SAG-AFTRA strike, Warner Bros. was considering to delay the film's release possibly to 2025 along with Beetlejuice Beetlejuice.[13]\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]"
