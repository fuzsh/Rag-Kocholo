Jules Furthman provided a screen story with scenario by Adela Rogers St. Johns. Mary Astor, James Kirkwood, and Betty Compson star.[1]\n\nPlot\n\n[edit]\n\nCast\n\n[edit]\n\nJames Kirkwood as Guy Watson\n\nMary Astor as Mary\n\nBetty Compson as Hula Kate\n\nGeorge F. Marion as Horace Palmer\n\nMary Carr as Ma Palmer\n\nGeorge Cooper as The Bozo\n\nReception\n\n[edit]\n\nBecause the Kirkwood character was a criminal posing as an evangelistic minister who performs marriage and burial ceremonies, the film was found by the New York Board of Censors to be sacrilegious and banned from distribution unless remade. The Board was also concerned by the number of times the name of the Deity appeared in subtitles spoken by the fake minister. First National estimated the cost of resolving the Board's issues to be an additional $50,000 above the initial cost of $175,000.[2]\n\nPreservation\n\n[edit]\n\nPreviously considered lost, a print of The Wise Guy is preserved at the National Archives of Canada.[3][4]\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]"
