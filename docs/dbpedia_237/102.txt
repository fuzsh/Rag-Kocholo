Production

Warner Bros. Pictures began work on Wise Guys in May 2022 and officially announced the film that August. Nicholas Pileggi wrote the script and Barry Levinson directed the film starring Robert De Niro in a double role.[1] In October 2022, Debra Messing and Kathrine Narducci joined the cast. Narducci previously worked with De Niro in A Bronx Tale, The Irishman, and the Levinson-directed telefilm The Wizard of Lies.[2][3]

The production used vehicle vinyl wraps on 1950s-era cars and trucks to make the vehicles look new in the film.[4] Filming took place in December 2022 in Ohio. The production shut down part of US 35 in Greene County,[5] as well as SR 123 in the greater Cincinnati area before moving to the suburbs of Cincinnati.[6]
