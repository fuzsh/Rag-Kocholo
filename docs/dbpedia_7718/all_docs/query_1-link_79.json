        "text": "Post by ozzy on\n\nHi,\n\nI am still a beginner player and I was only playing Acoustic so I wanted to try out some electric guitars since they are more versatile.\n\nSince I am a huge BB King fan(he primarily uses the Gibson E335) I would love to know what Harley Benton guitar would be an all rounder but also especially good for blues (similar to his style and tune) about the 200â‚¬ price range.\n\nThank you for your kind answers.\n\nPost by Deleted on\n\nI've watched Joe Bonamassa videos on YouTube when he was touring with Beth Hart. (I much prefer him as a band member than on his solo stuff). I noticed that for every different venue he seemed to use a different guitar to perform the same songs. Each sounded very fine. I wouldn't get particularly hung up about which HB model and go for something nicely balanced and comfortable, especially if you're planning to be sitting playing.\n\nPost by advb on\n\nAs Calebz says, if you want the 335 style then the HB-35 fits the bill and is in your budget. I have the basic HB-35 (not the Plus) and it is nice for blues. Unlike the Plus (which has alnico pickups and coil split), mine has lower cost \"vintage\" ceramic pickups and I find these a bit dark sounding. Again, fine for blues but might not be so good for some other styles.\n\nI should add that I often practice unamplified so I'm not the best person to give advice on pickups!\n\nUnfortunately, all the HP-35 models are currently out of stock and Thomann have a forecast of 7-9 weeks until the next stock.\n\nAs far as other models go, the great blues guitarist have played all sorts over the years. A quick Google search shows Albert King playing a Flying V, Clapton playing a Strat, Muddy Wates on a Telecaster and BB King playing an Esquire. @defjef is right, good blues can be played on most types of electric guitar.\n\nI'm sure others can suggest a good all-rounder - there are plenty of options in your price range, if you don't mind waiting for stock. The CST-24 series has a wide range of colour, pickup and bridge options and seems popular.\n\nPost by LeoThunder on\n\n@defjef said:\n\nI've watched Joe Bonamassa videos on YouTube when he was touring with Beth Hart.

Each sounded very fine.\n\nAs usual, marketing does what it can to plant implied needs into people's heads.\n\n\"Here's a rock guitar, here's a blues guitar, over there's a jazz guitar and this new one is a splithairmetal guitar. Buy all my guitars.\"\n\nOf course, \"reviewers\" in need of filling a blank page with words about yet another piece of wood with strings will amplify this or they'd have nothing to sell either.\n\nBB King style blues can be played on anything.\n\nMaybe not this:\n\nIt's all about the notes, anyway.\n\nPost by LeoThunder on\n\nAs Calebz says, if you want the 335 style then the HB-35 fits the bill and is in your budget. I have the basic HB-35 (not the Plus) and it is nice for blues.\n\nI would not call it, nor any guitar with Roswell LAF, an \"all-rounder\", which is also part of the OP's requirements. These pick-ups just lack clarity to qualify as such.\n\nPost by LeoThunder on\n\nUnlike the Plus (which has alnico pickups and coil split), mine has lower cost \"vintage\" ceramic pickups and I find these a bit dark sounding.\n\nAnd none of this has to do with the type of magnets. \"Lower cost\" might be the reason in that cheaper wire builds up more capacitance, as in cables. I'm only guessing here but the common prejudice making AlNiCo better than ceramic is unfounded.\n\nPost by Deleted on\n\nAs Calebz says, if you want the 335 style then the HB-35 fits the bill and is in your budget.

The LAF's are perfect for blues.\n\nAnd I've seldomly played pickups that were as versatile as these for classic styles. YMMV.\n\nPost by LeoThunder on\n\n@coldwar1977 said:\n\nI would not call it, nor any guitar with Roswell LAF, an \"all-rounder\", which is also part of the OP's requirements.

It seems that level of complexity was too high already.\n\nPost by Djangle on\n\nAsk a dozen guitarists to define tone, clarity, feel, balance etc for the various types of guitars on this planet and they're going to come up with a thousand different answers. At the end of the day these opinions are all subjective to the individual so only you can decide what pleases your ears and eyes. You love the sound of BB King (his guitar has humbuckers)and I'm assuming you like the look of his primary guitar so choosing the standard HB 35 is a no brainer.\n\nIs the HB 35 an all rounder? Again this answer is subjective to the individual. I've played the HB35 and found it to be a great sounding guitar on a par with my more expensive Hofner 335 type guitar and have no hesitation playing any genre of music on a humbucker equipped guitar.\n\nHowever it's important to realise pick ups ups on electric guitars generally fall into 2 (though some folk will say 3)categories.....humbuckers and single coils. To give you an idea of the differences here's a blurb from Dawson's Music store.\n\nwww.dawsons.co.uk/blog/humbuckers-vs-single-coil-pickups-beginners-guide\n\nMy advice is go with your gut instinct but look on You Tube for reviews of guitars that appeal to YOU before committing to buy. Good Luck"
