        "text": "Hey all!\n\nI just joined this forum because I stumbled into something that just blew my mind... well actually 2 things...\n\nI was just watching the some of the live footage from the DVD \"Stevie Ray Vaughan & DT ‎– Live From Austin, Texas\"\n\nIn the end of that DVD there is a montage with short video sequences of different blues musicians through the ages.\n\nOne of those includes a very short live footage of Albert King sitting down in what appears to be a diner and playing a SRV Signature Strat, how cool is that!\n\nI have NEVER seen another picture of Albert King holding another guitar than a Flying V apart from the cover photo of his album \"I Wanna Get Funky\"\n\nSCREENCAP from DVD (about 57:15)\n\nThe next thing I discovered was another short live footage of Albert King playing a white Flying V on stage in a live concert. Whats up with that?, I do not recognize that V.\n\nSCREENCAP from DVD (about 1:00:14)\n\nDoes anyone have any idea and more information about any of this, and maybe where you can find the full version of it?\n\nI deeply appreciate any information about this.\n\nThanks!\n\nAs for the vee s , Alberts First vee has a 59 serial number but early 60s parts on it allegedly given to him by Gibson in 62ish no one knows what he played before as he was a drummer before hand .\n\nIts now in the possession of Steven seagull after disappearing for over 20 years after being lost in a game of craps or similar . Gibson then gave him a 66 that he used to record things like born under a bad sign in the stax period .\n\nThe White one you mention is probably a version built by Dan Erlwine like lucy his main guitar for many years .\n\nAlbert to me is one of the greatest blues players there was along with Freddie King and BB king they all deserve the name king in my book.\n\nThe 59 , Lucy and the 66 all together all owned by Steven seagull.\n\nThanks for all the replies!\n\nand its fun to see that this interests others as well\n\nI'm a huge fan of both SRV and AK so anything \"new\" unseen is gold to me!\n\nI don't know if its worth a shot to try to contact the publisher of the DVD or something... like Sony or whatever.. hmm.\n\nAll this got me thinking though. About how much unseen material that still are out there, yet to be published or even discovered. Just the thought of it gets me excited!\n\nThanks for all the replies!\n\nand its fun to see that this interests others as well\n\nI'm a huge fan of both SRV and AK so anything \"new\" unseen is gold to me!\n\nI don't know if its worth a shot to try to contact the publisher of the DVD or something... like Sony or whatever.. hmm.\n\nAll this got me thinking though. About how much unseen material that still are out there, yet to be published or even discovered. Just the thought of it gets me excited!\n\nIts fascinating definitely, I'm sure a lot more will surface once what our American friends call the boomers pass away and there children find things and release them to the public . Or like the Hendrix memorabilia that his ex and uli roth have and sell every few years or the kossoff les paul bought from his ex girlfriend by Arthur Ramm after his death.\n\nI'm sure after his death claptons beano will re surface , bonamassa claimed to know where it was not long ago but then retracted from his story later on , some one knows where that guitar is .\n\nMarc bolans les paul that was stolen resurfaced a while back but the current owner got so much grief about how it should be returned to the estate its disappeared again.\n\nTheres lots of stories and famous guitars that have gone awol over the years and reappeared . Hendrix s painted flying v turned up in a music shop in the north of England re painted black .\n\nMost material if its unseen is heavily copyrighted for future books by people and gets drip fed to the public , some new shots of Clapton playing beano with john mayall surfaced a while back with the neck pup cover still on but were removed from public domain fairly quickly as they were being used in a book ."
