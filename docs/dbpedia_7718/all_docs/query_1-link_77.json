        "text": "The Gibson Flying V is one of the most distinctive and recognizable electric guitars ever made.\n\nBelow is a 'cut & paste' history I came across\n\n'As Guitar Aficionado notes, its look was Gibson's attempt to come up with a Modernist answer to the Fender Stratocaster. In 1956, Gibson president Ted McCarty commissioned some new designs, and the Flying V was the only one that survived the process intact.\n\nA patent was issued on Jan. 7, 1958, and it quickly became a favorite with blues stars Albert King and Lonnie Mack. King, in particular, liked it because, as a lefty, he could turn it upside down and it would look the same. But it originally didn't sell very well and was quickly discontinued.\n\nBut in 1965, Dave Davies of the Kinks picked one up on a U.S. tour when his only guitar was lost by an airline. Appearing with the Flying V on television brought exposure to the instrument, and it was reissued in 1966 with a few modifications to its design. Still, even with Richards playing one at the Rolling Stones' famous Hyde Park show in 1969 and Jimi Hendrix -- who was heavily influenced by King -- having one custom-made, it failed to sell in big numbers and production ceased in 1970.\n\nThey tried again in the mid-'70s and, this time, it caught hold with hard rock acts overseas, thanks to Michael Schenker of Scorpions and UFO, Marc Bolan of T. Rex and Bad Company's Mick Ralphs, and it hasn't been out of production since. It later became synonymous with '80s metal thanks to Metallica's James Hetfield and Kirk Hammett, a huge Schenker fan.'\n\nName your faviourite 'guitar solo's' on this wonderfull instrument.\n\nI'll start with Michael Schenker's 'Rock Bottom'\n\nThat's correct, Neil played Flying V during that tour, and even though Time Fades Away doesn't feature many guitar solos, and the fact that it's not Neil's traditional guitar, I had to post that picture."
