        "text": "Numerous specific things contribute to his tone - significant was his Brain and his fingers.\n\nLike Hendrix' date=' He tuned his guitar down 1/2 step to Eb - sometimes down a whole step to D. This aids in ability to perform vibrato techniques with more expressive bends.\n\nHe listened a lot to Albert King - SRVs version of Albert King's \"Sky is Crying\" is almost note for note copy. But no one would call SRV a dry copycat clone of his heroes. Note Albert had a unique style because he played a right hand Flying V guitar upside down - left handed. This places a different muscular reference pattern for the blues scales - and its SRV's emulation of Albert Kings phrasing that sets SRV apart from most white blues players at the time - who typically were focused on emulating John Mayall era Eric Clapton or Mike Bloomfield ( East / West LP w/ Paul Butterfield Blues Band)\n\nSRV pulled it off because he could get into the moment and express genuine passion that comes through like a beacon.\n\nMuch of his recorded tone is the result of playing through multiple amps at once. Each Amp was selected because each contributed specific signature sonic texture that contribute as an array to get his tone. He would use a '72 silver face Fender Vibrosonic Reverb, which is basically is a Twin Reverb loaded with one 15\" JBL D130F speaker - like **** Dale uses- this gave him clean attack and low end girth and full bodied tone - but in parallel to this he would use a Howard Dumble amp ( like Robben Ford, and a Marshall Major ( like Ritchie Blackmore), A Super Reverb ( like Derek Trucks) and Vibratone Leslie speaker for \"Cold Shot\" etc. He played very loud decibel level - which allowed him to sustain any note he desired infinitely. He would often kick in an Ibanez Tube Screamer for drama when he desired more \"rage\" -then kick it out again for expressive dynamic volume changes mid solo. And he had mastered Hendrix's Wah Wah style. - He used the Strat's middle PU quite a bit and Neck and or Neck + Middle PU - like Billy Gibbons does when he plays a strat (\"ZZ Top \"Sheik\" , \"Heard it on the X\")\n\nGet a copy of Live at El Macombo.\n\n[img']http://www.thesoundla.com/wiki/images/thumb/7/7a/SRV_Late80s_Rig.jpg/774px-SRV_Late80s_Rig.jpg[/img]\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stevie_Ray_Vaughan\n\nSRV's late-80s rig.\n\nAround early 1987, he would just use 2 Fender Vibroverbs and 2 Fender Super Reverbs stacked atop each other, with a Fender Vibratone on the very top. Later in the year, as shown in the photo to the right, he had a blackface Fender Twin Reverb to the very right, 2 Dumble Steel String Singers stacked atop a Fender Super Reverb, a Fender Vibratone on top of a Marshall 8x10\" cabinet, and a silverface Fender Twin Reverb to the very left.\n\nIn 1988, amps included a 200-watt Marshall Major power head, a Dumble SSS head (each driving a Dumble 4x12\" cabinet), and a Fender Vibratone. In this case, the Dumble was used to drive the Vibratone.\n\nThe effects were the same throughout this period. The Tube Screamer was upgraded to a TS-10 Classic, used with the Vox wah-wah, and the MXR Loop Selector.\n\nIn 1989, he changed his rig around a little, but basically the same sound. He had 2 Fender Super Reverbs, with a Dumble SSS and a Marshall Major atop each, and a Fender Vibroverb driving the Fender Vibratone.\n\nHe took a couple of Fender '59 Bassman Reissues on the road in 1990 and used these with a Vibroverb driving the Vibratone. On the '59 Bassman, he plugged a cable into \"Normal\" Input 1 with the Volume on 8, Treble 8, Middle 7, Bass 6, and Presence on 8. He used the stock tubes and the EVMs in these as well.\n\nHe also added more \"Hendrix\" effects to his pedalboard, acquiring two Arbiter Fuzz Faces (one \"Dallas-Arbiter\" and the silver, England version) and a couple of Octavias: one Roger Mayer version, and a Tycobrahe Octavia. He kept the TS-9 Tube Screamer and Vox wah-wah."
