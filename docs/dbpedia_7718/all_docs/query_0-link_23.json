        "text": "I'm sure a very limited list but let's hear em'\n\n1. Michael Schenker - his phrasing and innate melodicism are pure genius.\n\n2. Rudoplh Schenker - one of the tightest rhythm guitar rockers in the biz.\n\n3. KK Downing - some of the most brutal leads and aggressive riffs by this bloke.\n\n4. Jimi Hendrix - Although he isn't universally associated with the V his later performances on one were incredible.\n\nObviously there are others but only one guy is synonymous with the Flying V to me:\n\nSaw him recently. This guy is from another planet. His playing is so fluid and precise it's like a Porsche, Mercedes, and BMW all rolled into one. I've seen them all live in the past 39 years.. they all run their course of ideas but he just keeps coming up with fresh, new, and innovative melodic lines.\n\nA. King, Rhoads, and Hendirx for me... but very recently Bonamassa is bringing it back. When I see a Korina V it now has two associations!\n\nActually... didn't even realize that Van Halen played one... ran into this while looking for pictures to attach to this message...\n\nThe OP got it right in the first post.\n\nI never forget the UFO reunion tour in 1994. It was a general admission show and I had worked my way up to the front row to see Michael Schenker playing a white Gibson Flying V with #4 on it.\n\nI see him live with MSG every chance I get. Always includes the classic UFO tracks in the setlists.\n\nRudolph Schenker probably has the largest Flying V collection on the planet. He even has acoustic Flying V.\n\nLook up video footage of Live Vengeance â€˜82 for some great Flying V and SG action by K.K. Downing and Glenn Tipton."
