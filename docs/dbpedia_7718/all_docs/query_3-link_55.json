I can’t even fathom Stevie without a guitar. It meant everything to him. It took Stevie around the world. It introduced him to his heroes. It allowed him to express himself so he could speak, so he could have an identity. So he could find out who he was. When Stevie played, his guitar talked and told his story. If you listen, you can hear it. You can hear him speaking through his guitar. I know I can.”\n\nFrom 1977-79, Stevie Ray Vaughan teamed with singer Lou Ann Barton, in the Triple Threat Revue and Double Trouble.\n\n“Lou Ann was terrific, a great singer in her prime and a huge presence,” drummer Rodney Craig says in Texas Flood: The Inside Story of Stevie Ray Vaughan.\n\nEarly Double Trouble promo photo courtesy Joe Priesnitz > Lou Ann, Stevie, Chris “Whipper” Layton, Jackie Newhouse.\n\nBook out TOMORROW 8/13.

Material was still being written in the studio.\n\nRecalls drummer Larry Aberman, “Jimmie took out his acoustic guitar and said, ‘I’ve got this song I’ve been working on but it’s not quite done. I’d like to know what you guys think.’ He starts playing the hook: “Tick tock, tick tock, tick tock, people/ Time’s slipping away” and goes, ‘What do you think?’ We were all like, ‘It’s a f**king smash!'”\n\nPhoto by Mark Proct, one of 170 images featured in Texas Flood: The Inside Story of Stevie Ray Vaughan.\n\nBook out 8/13.

King was an intimidating man who stood 6-foot-5 with broad shoulders and usually had a pipe clenched between his teeth, which sparkled with gold. Onstage, his Gibson Flying V looked like a ukulele in his massive hands. His tough tone and aggressive playing style, marked by huge, multiple-string bends, were equally macho. The lefty held his right-handed guitar upside down and tuned in an enigmatic fashion that is still debated, the combination of which gave him a highly distinct style that’s been oft-copied but rarely duplicated. Stevie Ray Vaughan was an exception; Albert King’s style was at the very heart of his playing. He was not going to miss an opportunity to see his idol perform and hopefully to interact with him. Clifford Antone, who died in 2006, said that Stevie begged him to ask Albert to let him sit in.\n\nRecalls Jimmie Vaughan, “It was so far out: nobody would ask Albert King to sit in unless you were dumb or something. I don’t even know if Jimi Hendrix would do it…. Albert didn’t like anyone, but he liked Stevie! He put his arm around him, and from then on it was big Albert and little Stevie.”\n\nBook out 8/13.
