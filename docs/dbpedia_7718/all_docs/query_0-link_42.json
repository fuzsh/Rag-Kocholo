It has to do with the fertile soil deposited here by the ever-changing Mississippi River. And the recognition that what nature gives, it can easily take away. This acceptance leads to a special resilience in the people and diverse cultures that inhabit this area. You’ll see it and feel it as you travel the 15 counties that make up Arkansas Delta Byways",

        "text": "Albert King was born in 1923 in Indianola, Mississippi, and died in Memphis in 1992. A true blues legend, he was fascinated by blues musicians who frequented nearby West Memphis, most notably the works of Robert Nighthawk and Elmore James. He was a master blues guitarist, considered one of the most influential ever, and was famous for playing a Gibson Flying-V guitar. King was the first blues guitarist to perform with a symphony (1969) and in 1983, he was inducted into both the W. C. Handy International Blues Awards Hall of Fame and the Blues Foundation Hall of Fame. His blues hits included \"Born Under a Bad Sign,\" \"Crosscut Saw,\" \"I'll Play the Blues For You,\" \"As the Years Go Passing By,\" and hundreds more. He was a major influence on artists such as Stevie Ray Vaughan and Eric Clapton."
