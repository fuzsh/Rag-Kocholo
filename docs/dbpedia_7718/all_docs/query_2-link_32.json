        "text": "Albert King\n\nAllmusic Biography : Albert King is truly a \"King of the Blues,\" although he doesnt hold that title (B.B. does). Along with B.B. and Freddie King, Albert King is one of the major influences on blues and rock guitar players. Without him, modern guitar music would not sound as it does -- his style has influenced both black and white blues players from Otis Rush and Robert Cray to Eric Clapton and Stevie Ray Vaughan. Its important to note that while almost all modern blues guitarists seldom play for long without falling into a B.B. King guitar clichÃ©, Albert King never does -- hes had his own style and unique tone from the beginning.\n\nAlbert King plays guitar left-handed, without re-stringing the guitar from the right-handed setup; this \"upside-down\" playing accounts for his difference in tone, since he pulls down on the same strings that most players push up on when bending the blues notes. Kings massive tone and totally unique way of squeezing bends out of a guitar string has had a major impact. Many young white guitarists -- especially rock & rollers -- have been influenced by Kings playing, and many players who emulate his style may never have heard of Albert King, let alone heard his music. His style is immediately distinguishable from all other blues guitarists, and hes one of the most important blues guitarists to ever pick up the electric guitar.\n\nBorn in Indianola, MS, but raised in Forrest City, AR, Albert King (born Albert Nelson) taught himself how to play guitar when he was a child, building his own instrument out of a cigar box. At first, he played with gospel groups -- most notably the Harmony Kings -- but after hearing Blind Lemon Jefferson, Lonnie Johnson, and several other blues musicians, he solely played the blues. In 1950, he met MC Reeder, who owned the T-99 nightclub in Osceola, AR. King moved to Osceola shortly afterward, joining the T-99s house band, the In the Groove Boys. The band played several local Arkansas gigs besides the T-99, including several shows for a local radio station.\n\nAfter enjoying success in the Arkansas area, King moved to Gary, IN, in 1953, where he joined a band that also featured Jimmy Reed and John Brim. Both Reed and Brim were guitarists, which forced King to play drums in the group. At this time, he adopted the name Albert King, which he assumed after B.B. Kings \"Three OClock Blues\" became a huge hit. Albert met Willie Dixon shortly after moving to Gary, and the bassist/songwriter helped the guitarist set up an audition at Parrot Records. King passed the audition and cut his first session late in 1953. Five songs were recorded during the session and only one single, \"Be on Your Merry Way\" / \"Bad Luck Blues,\" was released; the other tracks appeared on various compilations over the next four decades. Although it sold respectably, the single didnt gather enough attention to earn him another session with Parrot. In early 1954, King returned to Osceola and re-joined theIn the Groove Boys; he stayed in Arkansas for the next two years.\n\nIn 1956, Albert moved to St. Louis, where he initially sat in with local bands. By the fall of 1956, King was headlining several clubs in the area. King continued to play the St. Louis circuit, honing his style. During these years, he began playing his signature Gibson Flying V, which he named Lucy. By 1958, Albert was quite popular in St. Louis, which led to a contract with the fledgling Bobbin Records in the summer of 1959. On his first Bobbin recordings, King recorded with a pianist and a small horn section, which made the music sound closer to jump blues than Delta or Chicago blues. Nevertheless, his guitar was taking a center stage and it was clear that he had developed a unique, forceful sound. Kings records for Bobbin sold well in the St. Louis area, enough so that King Records leased the \"Dont Throw Your Love on Me So Strong\" single from the smaller label. When the single was released nationally late in 1961, it became a hit, reaching number 14 on the R&B; charts. King Records continued to lease more material from Bobbin -- including a full album, Big Blues, which was released in 1963 -- but nothing else approached the initial success of \"Dont Throw Your Love on Me So Strong.\" Bobbin also leased material to Chess, which appeared in the late 60s.\n\nAlbert King left Bobbin in late 1962 and recorded one session for King Records in the spring of 1963, which were much more pop-oriented than his previous work; the singles issued from the session failed to sell. Within a year, he cut four songs for the local St. Louis independent label Coun-Tree, which was run by a jazz singer named Leo Gooden. Though these singles didnt appear in many cities -- St. Louis, Chicago, and Kansas City were the only three to register sales -- they foreshadowed his coming work with Stax Records. Furthermore, they were very popular within St. Louis, so much so that Gooden resented Kings success and pushed him off the label.\n\nFollowing his stint at Coun-Tree, Albert King signed with Stax Records in 1966. Alberts records for Stax would bring him stardom, both within blues and rock circles. All of his 60s Stax sides were recorded with the labels house band, Booker T. & the MGs, which gave his blues a sleek, soulful sound. That soul underpinning gave King crossover appeal, as evidenced by his R&B; chart hits -- \"Laundromat Blues\" (1966) and \"Cross Cut Saw\" (1967) both went Top 40, while \"Born Under a Bad Sign\" (1967) charted in the Top 50. Furthermore, Kings style was appropriated by several rock & roll players, most notably Jimi Hendrix and Eric Clapton, who copied Alberts \"Personal Manager\" guitar solo on the Cream song, \"Strange Brew.\" Albert Kings first album for Stax, 1967s Born Under a Bad Sign, was a collection of his singles for the label and became one of the most popular and influential blues albums of the late 60s. Beginning in 1968, Albert King was playing not only to blues audiences, but also to crowds of young rock & rollers. He frequently played at the Fillmore West in San Francisco and he even recorded an album, Live Wire/Blues Power, at the hall in the summer of 1968.\n\nEarly in 1969, King recorded Years Gone By, his first true studio album. Later that year, he recorded a tribute album to Elvis Presley (Blues for Elvis: Albert King Does the Kings Things) and a jam session with Steve Cropper and Pops Staples (Jammed Together), in addition to performing a concert with the St. Louis Symphony Orchestra. For the next few years, Albert toured America and Europe, returning to the studio in 1971, to record the Lovejoy album. In 1972, he recorded Ill Play the Blues for You, which featured accompaniment from the Bar-Kays, the Memphis Horns, and the Movement. The album was rooted in the blues, but featured distinctively modern soul and funk overtones.\n\nBy the mid-70s, Stax was suffering major financial problems, so King left the label for Utopia, a small subsidiary of RCA Records. Albert released two albums on Utopia, which featured some concessions to the constraints of commercial soul productions. Although he had a few hits at Utopia, his time there was essentially a transitional period, where he discovered that it was better to follow a straight blues direction and abandon contemporary soul crossovers. Kings subtle shift in style was evident on his first albums for Tomato Records, the label he signed with in 1978. Albert stayed at Tomato for several years, switching to Fantasy in 1983, releasing two albums for the label.\n\nIn the mid-80s, Albert King announced his retirement, but it was short-lived -- Albert continued to regularly play concerts and festivals throughout America and Europe for the rest of the decade. King continued to perform until his sudden death in 1992, when he suffered a fatal heart attack on December 21. The loss to the blues was a major one -- although many guitarists have tried, no one can replace Kings distinctive, trailblazing style. Albert King is a tough act to follow.

(Vaughn readily acknowledged Kings influence on him and often praised the elders immense talent.) By the time of THE BIG BLUES, King had long perfected his sound after years of touring. On \"Lets Have A Natural Ball,\" and \"I Get Evil,\" Kings voice is as expressive as any blues singer of his time, including Muddy Waters or Jimmy Reed (he backed the latter on a number of recordings).\n\nKing is remembered by many for his dabbling in the psychedelic sounds of the late 1960s, which set him apart from the more conservative blues players of the time. However, On 1962s THE BIG BLUES King was already showing an interest in exploring many genres of popular music. On the rumba-flavored instrumental \"This Morning\" he gets very close to a full-out surf guitar style, while one listen to the intro of \"I Walked All Night Long\" will reveal his subsequent influence on Stevie Ray.

They never gained a large audience, nor did they really capture the ferocity of his single-string leads. Then he signed with Stax in 1966 and recorded a number of sessions with the house band, Booker T. & the MGs, and everything just clicked. The MGs gave King supple Southern support, providing an excellent contrast to his tightly wound lead guitar, allowing to him to unleash a torrent of blistering guitar runs that were profoundly influential, not just in blues, but in rock & roll (witness Eric Claptons unabashed copping of King throughout Creams Disraeli Gears). Initially, these sessions were just released as singles, but they were soon compiled as Kings Stax debut, Born Under a Bad Sign. Certainly, the concentration of singles gives the album a consistency -- these were songs devised to get attention -- but, years later, its astounding how strong this catalog of songs is: \"Born Under a Bad Sign,\" \"Crosscut Saw,\" \"Oh Pretty Woman,\" \"The Hunter,\" \"Personal Manager,\" and \"Laundromat Blues\" form the very foundation of Albert Kings musical identity and legacy. Few blues albums are this on a cut-by-cut level; the songs are exceptional and the performances are rich, from Kings dynamic playing to the Southern funk of the MGs. It was immediately influential at the time and, over the years, it has only grown in stature as one of the very greatest electric blues albums of all time.

These guys were simply havin fun with some standard soul/R&B covers (e.g. \"Whatd I Say,\" \"Baby What You Want Me To Do\") and some wide-open originals, kickin back with some serious riffin. Cropper proffers his usual intense, simplistic soloing, while King swoops and dives in a stringbending fury. The added plus is the silky smooth near-falsetto of Pop Staples, whose vocal on \"Tupelo\" is suitably eerie...

With Booker T. drummer Al Jackson producing, the set includes such staples as \"You Threw Your Love on Me Too Strong,\" \"Wrapped up in Love Again,\" and a powerful version of Howlin Wolfs \"Killing Floor.\" For fans of Kings guitar work, the inclusion of the instrumental workouts on \"You Dont Love Me\" and \"Drowning on Dry Land\" are a special bonus. Not an essential Albert King album, but one of his good ones.

Chronologically, these are his next recordings after the Cobra sides and they carry a lot of the emotional wallop of those tracks, albeit with much loftier production values with much of it recorded in early stereo. Oddly enough, some of the material (\"All Your Love,\" \"Im Satisfied [Keep on Loving Me Baby]\") were remakes -- albeit great ones -- of tunes that Cobra had already released as singles! But Rushs performance of \"So Many Roads\" (featuring one of the greatest slow blues guitar solos of all time) should not be missed at any cost.

Kicking off with a typical reading of the Stones \"Honky Tonk Woman\" and including Taj Mahals \"She Caught the Katy and Left Me a Mule to Ride,\" the session is split between a Hollywood date with Jesse Ed Davis, Jim Keltner, and Duck Dunn in the band and one at Muscle Shoals with Roger Hawkins, David Hood, and Barry Beckett in the lineup. Although all of this is well-produced, theres hardly any fireworks out of Albert or any of the players aboard, making this an unessential addition for any but Albert King completists.

Granted, the sound of the album is entirely too polished, but there is genuine grit in the performances and some strong songs, such as \"You Upset Me Baby\" and \"Good Time Charlie,\" on the record. That may be enough for some hardcore fans to give a listen, but they should be forewarned that even those inspired moments arent enough to make King Albert a worthwhile release.

During those years, the label began earning significant clout amongst rock fans through events like Otis Reddings appearance at the Monterey International Pop Festival and a seemingly endless string of classic singles. When King signed to the label in 1966, he was immediately paired with the Stax session team Booker T. & the MGs. The results were impressive: \"Crosscut Saw,\" \"Laundromat Blues,\" and the singles collection Born Under a Bad Sign were all hits. Though 1972s Ill Play the Blues for You followed a slightly different formula, the combination of King, members of the legendary Bar-Kays, the Isaac Hayes Movement, and the sparkling Memphis Horns was hardly a risky endeavor. The result was a trim, funk-infused blues sound that provided ample space for Kings oft-imitated guitar playing. King has always been more impressive as a soloist than a singer, and some of his vocal performances on Ill Play the Blues for You lack the intensity one might hope for. As usual, he more than compensates with a series of exquisite six-string workouts. The title track and \"Breaking Up Somebodys Home\" both stretch past seven minutes, while \"Ill Be Doggone\" and \"Dont Burn Down the Bridge\" (where King coaxes a crowd to \"take it to the bridge,\" James Brown-style) break the five-minute barrier. Riding strutting lines by bassist James Alexander, King runs the gamut from tough, muscular playing to impassioned cries on his instrument, making Ill Play the Blues for You one of a handful of his great Stax sets.

True, the collection is tilted toward his Stax recordings, somewhat shortchanging his 50s and early-60s recordings, but it is also true that the late-60s/early-70s recordings are the cornerstone of Kings legacy, the ones that showcase his stinging guitar at its blistering best. By acknowledging as much the set gains credibility, it doesnt lose it, and while an artist with a career as long as Kings will certainly have some great cuts left off of a two-disc, 38-song collection, this truly does contain his very best work, particularly in regards to showcasing his influence as a guitarist. If youre looking for a succinct introduction, turn to Born Under a Bad Sign, one of the greatest blues albums and one that captures the full scope of his skills as well as this double-disc set, but if you want something a little more comprehensive, containing the great moments that arent on that album, this is what to get. After all, it doesnt just contain all but one song from that album, its one of the great blues collections.

The label aimed to continue the success King had enjoyed at Stax mixing blues backing and vocals with pop/soul arrangements and lyrics. He recorded six LPs for Tomato; this anthology culls 14 cuts from his Tomato releases, among them the slashing numbers \"Blues At Sunrise\" and \"Im Gonna Call You Soon As The Sun Goes Down,\" which vividly illustrated Kings guitar prowess. Others, like \"Truckload Of Lovin\" and \"We All Wanna Boogie,\" show how he skillfully crammed moments of inspiration into formulaic outings.

His recording career was, at least initially, erratic, though the quality of the sides he cut for the Parrot, King, and Coun-Tree imprints certainly was not. It wasnt until King signed to Stax in 1966, however, and the guitarists electric blues fused with the muscular bass, funky guitars, and sparkling horns of the labels outstanding session players, that he found his first home. King stayed with the label for eight years, leaving only when Stax was entering its financial decline. Funky London manages to dig up a few from the period that nearly got away, compiling three 45 sides and six unreleased tracks. The singles include a pair of instrumentals (a cover of James Browns \"Cold Sweat\" and \"Funky London,\" a dispensable, up-tempo 12-bar workout) and one vocal (\"Cant You See What Youre Doing to Me\"). By the nature of the material, those songs and the six that follow lack the cohesiveness of an album, though the quality of the music ultimately prevails. Downshifting for \"Lonesome,\" the combo is steeped in the blues. After a false start (\"Whats the matter with yall!?\" asks King), the band begins again, Kings crying guitar lines joined by keyboard commentary, smoky threads of wah-wah guitar and an exquisite horn arrangement. \"Sweet Fingers\" is an excellent example of funky blues ensemble playing and \"Driving Wheel\" a fine interpretation of the Roosevelt Sykes tune. Perhaps most important is the fact that the majority of the music here maintains the standards established on Kings official Stax releases, making this a desirable set.

Vaughan may have been the new news, but King was not suffering, either. He had a world-class supporting band and was playing as well as he ever had. In other words, the stage was set for a fiery, exciting concert and thats exactly what they delivered. Vaughan was clearly influenced by King -- there are King licks all over his first two recorded efforts, and it was an influence that stayed with him to the end -- and he was unafraid to go toe-to-toe with his idol. King must have been impressed, since In Session never devolves into a mere cutting contest. Instead, each musicians spurs the other to greater heights. For aficionados of either guitarist, that means the album isnt just worth a listen -- it means that its a record that sounds as exciting on each subsequent listen as does the first time through.

There may be a few favorites missing, from \"The Hunter\" to \"The Phone Booth,\" but the disc does a wonderful job of summarizing the classic Stax years while adding some highlights from his latter-day recordings for Tomato. In the end, what matters is that the bare basics -- \"Lets Have a Natural Ball,\" \"C.O.D.,\" \"Laundromat Blues,\" \"Oh Pretty Woman,\" \"Crosscut Saw,\" \"Born Under a Bad Sign,\" \"Personal Manager,\" \"Blues Power\" -- are all here, making this ideal for neophytes on a tight budget. (Of course, Born Under a Bad Sign remains an excellent introduction on its own terms, as well.)
