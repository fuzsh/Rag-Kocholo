        "text": "see...\n\n...SS amps can be just as viable. I really don't see at this point why it should need to be one or the other. I use both. If I ever reach the point where it's always gotta be a blackface circuit amp, fine. If they become more trouble than they're worth, then SS is just as viable, as long as they sound good, and my style works with them, which it does.\n\nTBO, I'm glad I'm on the younger side of the crowd here. It's made me ignorant (enough) to not be absolutely in love with old Tweeds, BFs, boutiques, etc. I'm saving bucks, happy with my tone, etc. And this is after extensively modifying a bunch of newer amps, now being the owner of a '65 BF that I got a hold of with everything origninal, playing a bunch of old Supers, Twins, a few older JCMs, etc...\n\nAnd thanks to monster players like Redd V. and Jerry D. it has been shown to me that you dont have to sacrifice a single thing tonewise with SS gear. You just have to be enough of a musician to give it a shot and see if your chops and attitude alone will get you there. An open mind also helps. Let's face it - SS amps are only part of the gear that some folks absolutely refuse to use, try, or even consider. I know alot of musicians that will bash this stuff without even trying it. Actually, they tend to be a bit more closed minded - along with the SS stuff tends to be mass produced tube amps, off the shelf pedals, anything with a PCB in it, any tube that isn't genuine NOS, and of course now anything with the word digital or modelling in it. Actually to me it's perfectly fine - you gotta have one thing, go get it. I love the flexibility of being able to choose from so many different amps that it's almost silly. And I know of at least 3 really great SS amps that will make me content enough to be happy just to be wailing on the Tele and not so concerned about being plugged into a worthy enough amp.\n\nMan, what a cool thread this has turned out to be. I applaud everyone's bravery for participating!\n\n-.011\n\nStandel\n\nDont' forget the '60s Standel solid state amps. They came out about the same time as the Thomas Vox amps. Not at all the same as the famous Standel tube amps favored by Chet, etc., they have a super-clean sound. Used by Wes Montgomery and, yes, Don Rich! ( required Tele content!) A bunch of '60s rock bands used them, like The Association.\n\nLike the Voxes, another maintenance nightmare : since transistor circuits were so new, everybody jealously guarded their designs. These Standel amps have separate \"potted\" modules for the preamp, power amp and reverb/trem circuits. Thus, you can't get in and copy the circuit! If one blows, you have to just get a new one. Some old music stores that were dealers still have caches of them. Luckily the new Standel company is repairing them.\n\nI picked up one of these amps at a garage sale for $40! Two channels, really surfy reverb and a weird trem. About 75 (ss) watts. It is so clean I could not get it to distort with a Flying V with the volume dimed! It has a 15 in Standel-branded JBL in it. With my '66 Tele it sounds awesome. It would also be great for steel.\n\nThese amps turn up on eBay now and then, and generally go for a song. Keep an eye out! Beware though, they weigh a ton because of the speakers! Mine has casters built into the cabinet!\n\nIt seems pretty obvious that solid state can be great for clean, but overdriven? I've just never heard one that sounds all that good over driven. Lots of jazz guys play solid state amps, but I've never hear done that didn't sound--yeah, it's a cliche--a little \"cold.\"\n\nWe played a gog today and the other guitarist had problems with his deluxe reverb. Fortunately the venue had a Roland JC120 available, and he played through that. good solid state amp, textbook pretty sound\n\nBUT--he didn't sound like he usually does the whole gig, and he turned to me at one point and said \"I hate that sound\" and I could hear exactly what he meant. In this case it was the particular way the roland was voiced, i guess\n\nI used to be a \"solid stae is good\" guy. then I got a good tube amp, and I was shocked at how good it sounded. It's been tubes all the way ever since. My ears are open though--I'm looking for a good sounding solid state amp\n\nactually for me...\n\n...overdrive with the right SS amp is the easy part. I had an older Peavey Stereo Chorus 212 that had an awesome overdrive channel. The magic was that the left and right channels were totally different - one had the standard 3 passive tone controls. The other had active, parametric eq. It was like having 2 amps, and it was all footswitchable! I actually still wish I had this amp now. Built like a tank, 2 12's, versatile, great tones.\n\nbut to me the downfall of a not-so-good SS amp is a too sterile clean channel. the beauty of clean tube amps is that they are actually not so clean. incorporating this into a SS circuit seems to be not so easy. the best way i've witnessed it done is with a lot of low gain semiconductor circuits cascading into one another. seems to make things fairly rich and complex, and not sterile. I seem to like the Tech 21 stuff best of all for the cleaner sounds. But Peavey made an older amp, I believe the 'Artist' - about 60 watts with a single 12 that I haven't personally owned but heard a few different guys playing a Tele thru on the clean channel that sounded pretty good. It seemed to have very flexible tone controls - I think that played a big part. I wouldn't mind playing around with one of those either.\n\n-.011\n\nIt seems pretty obvious that solid state can be great for clean, but overdriven?

I also own a Music Man HD210, Yamaha G30112, Peavey Blazer 158, Crate BX-80 bass amp, an Epiphone EP-800R and a Behringer GX110. I love my SS amps because they give me the sounds I want and the reliability I need. Yes, my ideal sound is probably an overdriven Fender Deluxe reverb, but I can get that with almost all of the guitar amps listed above (except the Crate and Yamaha).\n\nSS amps are grossly underrated. The Hughes & Kettner Warp 7 blows away almost every Marshall I've played in terms of sustain, tone, control and headroom. Marshalls always start sounding too compressed to my ears when they're cranked up the way I play. Other guitarists swear by their Marshalls and get great sounds, but I've never been able to make that connection on my own.\n\nI play an assortment of Hamers, Les Pauls, semi hollows, lap steels, Strats and Teles through my SS combos and they all sound great in the studio as well as on stage. Not saying it works that way for everyone, but definitely for me.\n\nYou just assumed the good sounds you've heard were tube...\n\nFamous Solid State Tones\n\nAcoustic\n\nModel 260\n\nRobbie Krieger (the Doors)\n\nAlbert King\n\nChuck Berry\n\nModel 270\n\nFrank Marino (Mahogany Rush)\n\nFrank Zappa\n\nErnie Isley (Clean Sounds)\n\nAward-Session\n\nSessionette:75\n\nEric Clapton (August)\n\nBlueTone\n\nPro 30M\n\nPete Townshend (circa 2004, endorsed)\n\nJohn Jorgenson (The Hellacasters circa 2004, endorsed)\n\nCarlsbro\n\nStingray Professional\n\nAndy Gill (Early Gang of Four)\n\nCrate\n\nGX-130C\n\nJack Oven (Cannibal Corpse – Vile and Bleeding)\n\nShockwave GT3500H\n\nKirk Windstein (Crowbar)\n\nFender\n\nSuper Showman\n\nJan Akkerman (Focus)\n\nRoc Pro 1000\n\nYngwie Malmsteen (boosted with TS9 for convention and clinic use, reported shot an instructional video using one)\n\nGallien Krueger\n\nGMT 226A\n\nSantana (’69 Woodstock – with prototype EH Big Muff)\n\n260ML\n\nDave Murray and Adrian Smith (Iron Maiden – Somewhere in Time)\n\n2000CPL\n\nAlex Lifeson (Rush – Hold Your Fire, Presto, A Show of Hands)\n\nDave Murray and Adrian Smith (Iron Maiden – Seventh Son of a Seventh Son)\n\nUnknown Model\n\nDave Mustaine and Marty Friedman (Megadeth-late 80’s Unconfirmed)\n\nH&H Electronics\n\nI/C 100\n\nSteve Hackett (70’s Genesis)\n\nDaniel Ash (Bauhaus, Love and Rockets)\n\nMarc Bolan (T Rex)\n\nUnknown Power Amp\n\nEddie Van Halen (early career)\n\nHenriksen\n\nJazz Amp\n\nLarry Coryell\n\nJimmy Bruno\n\nJim Hall\n\nJoe Diorio\n\nJordan\n\nUnknown Models\n\nMamas and Papas\n\nYardbirds\n\nRobbie Krieger (The Doors)\n\nKustom\n\nUnknown Models\n\nJackson Five (live)\n\nJohnny Cash\n\nK200\n\nJohn Fogerty (Creedence Clearwater Revival)\n\nJeff Beck (Jeff Beck Group ’69 US Tour)\n\nMarshall\n\nValvestate 8100 (Hybrid)\n\nChuck Schuldiner (Death)\n\nJay Yuenger (White Zombie)\n\nTommy Victor (Prong)\n\nMG100HDFX\n\nWayne Static (Static X)\n\nMF-350 Mode Four (Hybrid)\n\nJohn 5 (Marilyn Manson, Rob Zombie)\n\nDaron Malakian (System of a Down)\n\nAlex Scolnick (Testament - 2008 Tour)\n\nDave Navarro\n\nBloodhound Gang\n\nNorlin (Gibson)\n\nLab Series L5/L7\n\nTy Tabor (King’s X – Out of the Silent Planet, Gretchen Goes to Nebraska, Faith Hope Love, King’s X)\n\nAlan Holdsworth (I.O.U. era)\n\nBB King\n\nRonnie Montrose\n\nElliot Easton (Cars)\n\nAndy Gill (Latter Gang of Four)\n\nPearce\n\nUnknown Models (per the Pearce G3 brochure c. 1992)\n\nJohn Abercrombie\n\nReb Beach\n\nAllan Holdsworth\n\nStanley Jordan\n\nPhil Keaggy\n\nRonnie Montrose\n\nVernon reid\n\nRicky Skaggs\n\nMike Stern\n\nAndy Summers\n\nPeavey\n\nSpecial 100\n\nLuther Dickenson (North Mississippi Allstars, the Black Crowes – on rare occasions.
