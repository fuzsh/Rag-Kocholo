        "text": "Full Description\n\nView Full Description\n\nHot humbucker duo\n\nThe electronics of the Flying V Reissue play a crucial role in shaping the guitar's versatile and dynamic sound. A pair of Custombucker Alnico III pickups, which are featured in both the bridge and neck positions, are designed to deliver a faithful reproduction of the classic PAF humbucker tone. These electronics provide a well-balanced frequency response with an emphasis on mid-range warmth and smooth high-end clarity. The result is rich and articulate sounds that can easily be tailored to suit a wide range of musical styles, from blues and jazz to rock and metal.\n\nTo further enhance the control and flexibility, it is equipped with a comprehensive set of controls, including two volume knobs, one tone knob, and a three-way pickup switch. This setup allows you to seamlessly blend the distinctive characteristics of the bridge and neck pickups or use them individually to create their desired voicing. The black top hat control knobs with silver inserts not only add a touch of vintage charm but also ensure precise adjustments for optimal tonal shaping. With this level of control at your fingertips, you can effortlessly dial in the perfect settings for any performance situation, allowing the true potential of the Custombucker Alnico IIIs and the guitar's exceptional craftsmanship to shine through.\n\nThe perfect performance companion\n\nA testament to the original. The solid mahogany neck is crafted with an authentic '67 medium C shape, offering a comfortable and ergonomic profile that accommodates a wide range of hand sizes and playing styles. This neck shape allows for effortless transitions between chords and smooth navigation across the entire fingerboard, making it suitable for both rhythm and lead playing.\n\nThe Indian rosewood fingerboard with its twenty-two frets and pearloid dot inlays not only adds to the visual appeal but also contributes to its exceptional playability. The rosewood material provides a warm and responsive touch, while the 24.75\" scale length ensures a balanced tension across the strings, resulting in improved intonation. Furthermore, the nylon nut and Kluson double ring tuners work together to maintain stable tuning and precise intonation, allowing you to focus on your performance without worrying about tuning issues. An unparalleled playing experience that combines vintage-inspired aesthetics with modern-day comfort and precision.\n\nPerfection in every detail\n\nEach and every detail of the Flying V has been meticulously chosen to ensure durability, functionality, and aesthetic appeal. This guitar features chrome hardware, which not only adds a touch of elegance but also provides excellent resistance to wear and corrosion over time. The Kluson double ring tuners offer precise and stable tuning, ensuring that your model remains in tune even during the most demanding performances. The bridge and tailpiece are designed to provide optimal string alignment and sustain, contributing to the overall playability and tonal characteristics. This attention to detail in the hardware selection contributes to this Gibson Custom's status as a high-quality, reliable instrument that players can depend on for years to come.\n\nA legend recreated\n\nThe history and legacy of the Gibson Flying V are deeply rooted in innovation and bold design. First introduced in 1958, this model was a radical departure from traditional guitar shapes, showcasing a futuristic and eye-catching aesthetic that was ahead of its time. Initially met with scepticism, the Flying V would eventually find its way into the hands of legendary musicians such as Jimi Hendrix, Albert King, and Billy Gibbons, who embraced its unique appearance and exceptional tonal qualities. The guitar's distinctive look and sound have since become synonymous with rock 'n' roll and have inspired countless artists across various genres.\n\nOver the years, the Flying V has seen numerous iterations and reissues, with the Gibson Custom 1967 Reissue being one of the most recent and faithful recreations of the iconic model. This design pays homage to the '67 style, which featured a sleek new look and a Vibrola tailpiece, further solidifying the Flying V's place in guitar history. Today, this Gibson model continues to be a symbol of innovation and individuality, embodying the spirit of both its storied past and the cutting edge of guitar design.\n\nSpecifications\n\nProduct Code: FV67SBCM1 #TBC\n\nBody\n\nMaterial: 2pc Solid Mahogany\n\nShape: Designer Flying V\n\nColour: Sparkling Burgundy\n\nNeck and Fingerboard\n\nNeck Material: Solid Mahogany\n\nNeck Shape: Authentic '67 Medium C\n\nScale Length: 24.75\"\n\nFingerboard Material: Indian Rosewood\n\nFrets: 22\n\nInlays: Pearloid Dots\n\nNut: Nylon\n\nNut Width: 40mm\n\nHardware and Electronics"
