        "text": "What to know\n\nAlbert King, a true blues legend, died in 1992 and is buried in Paradise Gardens in Edmondson. He was fascinated by the blues musicians who frequented nearby West Memphis, Arkansas -- most notably the works of Robert Nighthawk and Elmore James. King was famous for playing a Gibson Flying-V guitar and for singing such hits as \"Born Under a Bad Sign\" and \"I'll Play the Blues for You.\" He is considered one of the most influential blues guitarists ever and is credited with influencing Stevie Ray Vaughan, Eric Clapton, and other great performing artists. He was the first blues guitarist to perform with a symphony (1969,). In 1983 he was inducted into both the W.C. Handy International Blues Awards Hall of Fame and the Blues Foundation Hall of Fame. To reach the cemetery, travel on Interstate 40 about four miles west of West Memphis and then turn south on Ark. 147 for about two and a half miles until you reach the cemetery. This is a stop on the Arkansas Delta Music Trail: Sounds from the Soil and Soul."
