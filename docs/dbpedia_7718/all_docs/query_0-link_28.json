        "text": "A 1958 Gibson Flying V electric guitar, once owned by bluesman Albert King, is the highlight of Richard Gere's $1m-valued guitar collection sale in October.\n\nThe star of Pretty Woman and Chicago is selling 110 vintage guitars he has amassed during his lifetime at Christie's New York on October 11.\n\nValued at $90,000, the 1958 Gibson is joined by a highly desirable 1931 Martin D-28, which is expected to make close to $70,000.\n\nGere said: \"I never planned to put together a collection, I just bought ones that I liked, the ones that sounded good and played well. Some are very special.\n\n\"Although it's more than a little painful to let them go, each one has been played, loved and appreciated- and will be again.\"\n\nThe sale will also feature guitars that once belonged to Bob Marley and the Wailers guitarist Peter Tosh and the guitar manufacturer James D'Aquisto.\n\nThe auction's proceeds will go towards humanitarian projects around the world.\n\nKerry Keane, head of Christie's musical instruments department, commented: \"What transpired over a lifetime is an almost encyclopedic representation of American guitar making.\n\n\"This is an exciting opportunity for collectors and fans alike to take advantage of Mr Gere's unrecognised talent for creating a cohesive collection.\"\n\nGuitars and memorabilia associated with famous musicians have a history of performing well at auction.\n\nWith the added attraction that these axes have been owned by Richard Gere, they could perform well.\n\nEric Clapton's 1948 Gibson L-5P sold for $82,960 at Bonhams in March.\n\nWe will bring you all the main results here.\n\nClick here to view ourMemorabilia stock items for sale\n\nLearn how you can getpleasure & profit from musical collectibles\n\nRead all the latestMemorabilia news"
