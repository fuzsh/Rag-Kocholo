        "text": "1. Albert King was left-handed, but he played the guitar right-handed. Despite this, he developed a unique style of playing that involved unconventional fingerings and string bending techniques, which contributed to his distinctive sound.\n\n2. Prior to his successful career as a musician, Albert King worked in various blue-collar jobs, including farming and construction. He often incorporated his experiences and struggles from these jobs into his songwriting, giving his music an authentic and relatable quality.\n\n3. King's physical appearance was quite striking. Standing at 6 feet 4 inches tall, he was known for his towering presence and large frame. He often used his size to his advantage during his live performances, captivating audiences with his commanding stage presence.\n\n4. Despite his groundbreaking influence on blues guitar, Albert King did not achieve mainstream success until much later in his career. It was not until the late 1960s, when he signed with Stax Records, that he gained significant recognition and commercial success, thanks to his signature song \"Born Under a Bad Sign.\"\n\n5. Albert King was not only an accomplished guitarist, but he also had a powerful and distinctive singing voice. His deep, soulful vocals perfectly complemented his unique guitar playing style, contributing to the impact of his music. His voice, combined with his guitar skills, made him a formidable force in the blues genre.\n\nYour attitude determines your altitude.\n\nAlbert King"
