        "text": "Essential Question\n\nHow can shapes be used to design an electric guitar?\n\nOverview\n\nThe instrument is relatively simple: 6 strings, a fretboard, and some magnetic pickups set into a wooden body. But coupled with an amplifier, the electric guitar has provided musicians with an endless variety of sounds, from the crackling riffs of Chuck Berry to the echoey reverberations of Dick Dale to the fuzzy crunch of Kurt Cobain.\n\nBut it’s more than the sound of the electric guitar that has made it the seminal rock instrument: it’s the look as well. The shape of the electric guitar has become the unofficial symbol of Rock and Roll, and various guitar models have become synonymous with rock guitarists, from the lightning bolt shape of James Hetfield’s Gibson Explorer, to Sister Rosetta Tharpe’s iconic Gibson SG, to Albert King’s futuristic Flying V. Today, the shape of electric guitars have become almost as diverse as the sounds they produce.\n\nIn this lesson, students learn how to identify shapes, and examine how different shapes combine to form well-known models of electric guitars. Students then design their own electric guitars, making sure to include all the components essential to the instrument.\n\nMaterials required for this lesson:\n\nCrayons, Markers, or Colored Pencils\n\nView More\n\nObjectives\n\nKnow (knowledge):\n\nHow to identify a shape based upon its characteristics\n\nThe difference between parallel and perpendicular lines\n\nThe construction and components of an electric guitar\n\nMastery Objective:\n\nStudents will be able to use shapes to design their own electric guitar.\n\nImages\n\nActivities\n\nMotivational Activity:\n\nTell students that in this lesson, they will be learning about shapes. Show Image 1, Types of Shapes. Ask students:\n\nHave you ever seen these shapes before? Which one? Where have you seen it?\n\nHow are these shapes different?\n\nPoint to each shape, and ask:\n\nHow many sides does this shape have? Can you count them?\n\nAre all the lines in the shape the same length, or are some lines longer than others?\n\nDo all the lines go in the same direction, or do they go in different directions? Are they parallel, meaning they will never cross into each other, or are they perpendicular, meaning if they keep going they will cross?\n\nTell students shapes are categorized based on the number of sides they have, how long the sides are, and whether the sides are parallel or perpendicular.\n\nGive students graphing paper, and ask them to practice drawing a few of the shapes they see in the image. (Alternatively, teachers may print out Image 1 as a coloring activity.)\n\nProcedure:\n\nTell students that shapes are used to create many things, and in this lesson they will be looking at what shapes are used to make a guitar. Show Image 2, Electric Guitar Diagram. Go over each of the main components of the guitar, asking students what shapes each component resembles (The neck is a rectangle, the pick-ups are rectangles, the volume and tone knobs are circles, etc.)\n\nTell students that most of the shapes of guitar components are similar, but the body of electric guitars come in different shapes, and some electric guitar bodies are combinations of shapes. Show students Images 3-7 of various guitar models. After showing each body type, ask students:\n\nIs this electric guitar body one shape, or a combination of shapes?\n\nWhat shapes are combined to make this guitar body? What shapes do you see first? (Encourage students to locate the shapes they identified verbally, drawing upon what their learned in Image 2: “I see a triangle under the tone knobs.”)\n\nPrint out several copies of Handout 1 – Electric Guitar Templates. Give students the template of the guitar body type they would like to design. Show again Image 2, Electric Guitar Diagram. Ask students to design their own guitar using marker, crayons, or colored pencils, making sure that components in the diagram are present in their guitar designs. Encourage students to be creative with their designs, and use as many shapes as they can in creating their own electric guitar.\n\nOnce students are finalizing their design, pass out to each student Handout 2 – Peer Assessment Checklist. Pair students, and have each student use the checklist to assess their partner’s project. Have the students make sure each needed element is in their partner’s guitar design, and have them identify which shapes are used in their partner’s design. If an element is missing, students should revisit their design to add the missing component.\n\nSummary Activity:\n\nHave students present to the class their electric guitar designs. Ask them about the shapes they used, the colors, and the other creative decisions they made in their design.\n\nShare your student’s creations by sending images to info@rockandrollforever.org!\n\nExtension Activities:\n\nShow works by famous artists, and ask students to create a guitar design in the style of a particular artists. Suggestions of artists include:\n\nKeith Haring\n\nAlma Thomas\n\nCarmen Herrera\n\nEllsworth Kelly\n\nJean Michel Basquiat\n\nYayoi Kusama\n\nTakashi Murakami\n\nSol Lewitt\n\nIcy and Sot\n\nJasper Johns\n\nHave students use their design to create a functional electric guitar with the The Guitar: A Musical Transducer lesson.\n\nHandouts\n\nHandout 1 – Electric Guitar Templates Handout 2 – Peer Assessment Checklist\n\nStandards\n\nCommon Core State Standards\n\nMath Standards\n\nK.G.A.1: Describe objects in the environment using names of shapes, and describe the relative positions of these objects using terms such as above, below, beside, in front of, behind, and next to.\n\nK.G.A.2: Correctly name shapes regardless of their orientations or overall size.\n\nK.G.B.4: Analyze and compare two- and three-dimensional shapes, in different sizes and orientations, using informal language to describe their similarities, differences, parts (e.g., number of sides and vertices/”corners”) and other attributes (e.g., having sides of equal length).\n\nK.G.B.5: Model shapes in the world by building shapes from components (e.g., sticks and clay balls) and drawing shapes.\n\n1.G.A.1: Distinguish between defining attributes (e.g., triangles are closed and three-sided) versus non-defining attributes (e.g., color, orientation, overall size); build and draw shapes to possess defining attributes.\n\n2.G.A.1: Recognize and draw shapes having specified attributes, such as a given number of angles or a given number of equal faces.1 Identify triangles, quadrilaterals, pentagons, hexagons, and cubes.\n\n4.G.A.1: Draw points, lines, line segments, rays, angles (right, acute, obtuse), and perpendicular and parallel lines.
