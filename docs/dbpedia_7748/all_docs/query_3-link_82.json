        "text": "A Centennial Anthology\n\nWritten by James D. Bratt\n\nAbraham Kuyper (1837-1920) is one of the most remarkable men in the history of Reformed Christianity.\n\nHe was eminent in Dutch public life for half a century and left a deep imprint on Dutch immigrant communities in the Unites States, Canada, and South Africa. A theologian, politician, journalist, university founder, and seminal thinker in the history of modern Calvinism, Kuyper offered an engaging critique of the nineteenth century that still has much to say at the beginning of the twenty-first century. The book brings together a representative selection of Kuyperâ€™s wide-ranging and creative Christian mind.\n\nPaperback, 504 pages, Index, notes, bibliography"
