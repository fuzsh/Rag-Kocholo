        "text": "Abraham Kuyper was one of Holland’s foremost leaders in politics, education, and the church from 1865 to 1917, a period of over 50 years. His influence is still felt today in his native land and in many other countries.\n\nKuyper is unique in that he carried on parallel careers in separate major fields, both as a thinker and as a doer. He carried a sword in one hand and a trowel in the other, for he was both a builder and a battler. His followers loved him with warm, undying devotion, while his enemies hated him as they hated no one else.\n\nThis biography, which is aimed at the general reader, gives us a running account of Kuyper’s 83 years on earth. It outlines his personal history and sketches the background whenever the scene shifts to a new phase in Kuyper’s many-sided career."
