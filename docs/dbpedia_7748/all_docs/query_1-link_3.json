        "text": "Prof. Hanko is professor of Church History and New Testament in the Protestant Reformed Seminary.\n\nChildhood and Youth\n\nAbraham Kuyper was born on October 29, 1837 to Rev. and Mrs. J. F. Kuyper, in the small fishing village of Maassluis, the Netherlands. It was a time of great apostasy in the Reformed Church, and Modernists occupied thousands of pulpits and all the important posts in the schools. Kuyper’s own father was somewhere between liberal modernism and mildly Reformed.\n\nTwo reform movements had swept the Netherlands—one a mere gesture towards reformation, the other a genuine reform of the church. The first, called the Reveil (Renewal), had spread throughout Protestant Europe, was more humanistic than ecclesiastical, and hoped to bring reformation into the church from within. The second, called De Afscheiding (The Separation), was led by Hendrik DeCock, and was composed of thousands of godly and pious people who were among the lower classes, whom Kuyper himself was later to call de kleine luyden (the little folk). These had separated from the false state church to re-establish the church of Christ. Kuyper was not touched by either movement.\n\nBram (as he was called) was home-schooled and early learned French and German. He was a promising student from the outset and not only showed an aptitude for languages, but quickly mastered whatever was put in his way. He studied in Middleburg and Leiden when his family moved to these cities to prepare himself for university work. He graduated from “gymnasium” in 1855 and delivered the valedictory address in German on the subject: “Ulfilas, the Bishop of the Visigoths, and His Gothic Translation of the Bible.”\n\nHis post-graduate studies were in the University of Leiden, a 280-year-old school with an enrollment of about 500 students. All the instruction he received was thoroughly modernistic. He graduated in 1858 summa cum laude and entered the Divinity School in Leiden to prepare for the ministry. No wonder that when Kuyper graduated from Divinity School in 1861 and earned his doctorate in 1863 he was a thorough-going Modernist of no use to God or man.\n\nConversion and Early Ministry\n\nBut God had other plans for this young man; he was destined to become one of the greatest and most influential Reformed preachers that either this century or the last has seen. To fashion him in the proper mold required his conversion. Kuyper tells us that three elements played a part in humbling him and bringing him to God.\n\nThe first experience took place in his university days and did not bear its fruit till later. While working on an essay which dealt with a comparison between Calvin’s and à Lasco’s views of the church, Kuyper could find none of à Lasco’s works, though he searched throughout the libraries of Europe. An old minister, the father of one of his liberal professors, had a complete set, perhaps the only one in Europe. Kuyper considered this almost miraculous and a special evidence of God’s providential direction of his life.\n\nThe second experience was brought about by a complete nervous collapse due to overwork, during which time Kuyper could do nothing but build a model ship and read light fiction. In reading Charlotte M. Yonge’s book, The Heir of Redcliffe, he was so moved by how God had humbled the arrogant main character of the book that he later wrote: “What I lived through in my soul in that moment I fully understood only later, yet from that hour, after that moment, I scorned what I formerly esteemed, I sought what I once dared to despise.”\n\nThe third experience took place in his first congregation where were a few genuine Christians. One, a peasant girl of thirty, Pietronella Baltus, refused to shake his hand and explained her actions by telling him that he was unconverted and not fit to be a minister. Kuyper was stunned by this, but had the humility to inquire further from these humble folk, who sent him back to Calvin and the Reformed fathers to learn the Reformed faith.\n\nThe Preacher\n\nAfter his conversion, Kuyper became a powerful and effective preacher of the Reformed faith, who was used by God to bring a revival of the Reformed faith to the Dutch church. He was an extraordinary exegete, a forceful orator, and a fearless critic of Modernism. He moved many to love the Reformed faith and he moved many enemies of the gospel to hate him passionately.\n\nHis first congregation was the small church of Beesd, from which he moved to Utrecht, a church of 35,000 members and eleven ministers. Here he had his first confrontation with the ecclesiastical hierarchy, which was to lead in the future to a split. After three years he moved to Amsterdam, the most influential, the largest, and the most prestigious church in the Netherlands. It had 140,000 members, 136 officebearers, 28 ministers, 10 sanctuaries, and 4 chapels.\n\nKuyper was not only a superb preacher, but he was also an effective liturgist. His prayers were eloquent and brought God’s people to the throne of grace. His reading of Scripture was so powerful that his colleague once said that hearing Kuyper merely read Psalm 148 was clearer exposition than most sermons on it and brought him to tears.\n\nHow effective he would have been if he had remained a preacher is impossible to say, but it was a loss greater than can be described that Kuyper resigned from the ministry in 1874 in the interests of entering politics. That marked the beginning of the decline of his effectiveness as a Reformed man.\n\nThe Journalist and Writer\n\nKuyper’s works fill a large shelf and are on such a variety of subjects that one marvels at his vast learning and extensive knowledge of almost any subject to which he applied himself. Already while in Utrecht he became editor of De Heraut (The Herald), a weekly, and remained in this post till the end of his life. In 1872 he became editor of De Standaard (The Standard), a Christian daily newspaper, and he held that post for almost 50 years, until he was 82 years old. He published a Dogmatics, a three-volume exposition of the Heidelberg Catechism, a three-volume work on “Encyclopedia,” a three-volume work on common grace, and hundreds of meditations published in various books. These latter are some of his finest writings and are still worthwhile reading today.\n\nKuyper made use of countless illustrations, some of which he used to prove his point rather than illustrate it. But Kuyper’s writings have been largely responsible for his influence in Reformed circles to the present.\n\nChurch Reformer\n\nAfter his conversion Kuyper became an implacable foe of Modernism, which had captured the universities and divinity schools and which had sapped the church of its spiritual life. His Reformed preaching and writing had been blessed by God to turn a significant part of the church back to the faith of their fathers. This brought him into conflict with the church.\n\nThe first confrontation took place in Utrecht when Kuyper’s consistory refused to answer a questionnaire sent out in the place of classical visitation. This refusal aroused the fury of the authorities and was finally to become an issue in the split.\n\nAs is so often the case in the church, confessional integrity was also an issue. The church was no longer requiring subscription to the creeds in many instances, but was satisfied with a vague promise “to promote the interest of the kingdom of God in general and especially those of the State Church.” Kuyper and the consistory of Amsterdam would have none of this.\n\nYoung people who showed in doctrine and walk that they were unbelievers were admitted to membership in the church and the Lord’s table. In Kuyper’s thinking this was intolerable.\n\nThe hierarchy acted against Kuyper and deposed officebearers in the congregation. The result was that about 200 congregations totaling 100,000 people left to form a new denomination called De Doleantie (The Aggrieved Ones). In time, also with Kuyper’s support, these people came together with De Afscheiding of 1834 to form what is now the Gereformeerde Kerken in Nederland (GKN)—which, though once Reformed, has now become as apostate as the state church in Kuyper’s day had ever been.\n\nThe Politician\n\nWhile to some Kuyper’s greatest glory came as a politician, it nevertheless remains a fact that Kuyper’s involvement in politics did great harm to the cause of the Reformed faith.\n\nEarly in his ministry Kuyper had begun involvement in the Anti-revolutionary Party founded by Groen VanPrinsterer. After resigning from the ministry and standing for election to the Second Chamber of Parliament, he, after twice being defeated, was elected in 1874.\n\nHe was re-elected a year later, suffered a nervous collapse a second time, which removed him from action for 15 months, returned with renewed energy to re-organize and re-vitalize the party, and finally came to the point where he saw the possibility of becoming prime minister.\n\nTo become prime minister, however, was possible only by forming a coalition with the Roman Catholics. The justification for forming such a coalition was in large part the motivation of Kuyper’s development of a thoroughly unbiblical and wholly philosophical theory of common grace.\n\nKuyper’s tenure as prime minister was short, but Kuyper the politician and proponent of common grace is the Kuyper remembered and adored.\n\nKuyper the Educator\n\nKuyper was always interested in education, Christian education in general, and Reformed higher education in particular. His love for children was great: he cared tenderly for his own children, and he took every opportunity to visit the orphanage in Amsterdam to spend time with and speak to the children there.\n\nBut, although he fought long and hard to make Christian education available to all the common folk whose financial burdens were too great to bear, his greatest achievement was the establishment of the Free University in Amsterdam. This university remains to the present, although it has become a hotbed of liberal and socialistic thought.\n\nIt was as an educator that he was invited to Princeton University where he delivered his “Stone Lectures.” This year marks the 100th anniversary of those lectures in which his common grace was popularized.\n\nThe Christian Man\n\nKuyper was a godly man who loved and cared for his family. While in Beesd he married Johanna Hendrika Schaay, a girl from Rotterdam. With her he had five sons and two daughters. The life of his covenant family was dear to him; family devotions were held regularly, to which the servants were invited; Scripture was explained and prayers were made; mealtimes were times of discussion, argumentation, fellowship, and laughter. The old year never passed away and the new year never arrived except Kuyper could be found with his family reading Scripture and in prayer. The custom was preserved till the end of his life.\n\nKuyper was a man of vast learning who knew and spoke many of Europe’s languages, who wrote on countless subjects, who lectured and wrote in Latin; but who also was deeply mystical, though in the Reformed sense of the word. No one can read without being moved Kuyper’s book: Nabij God te Zijn, translated under the title, “Nearness To God.”\n\nHe was a man of God with many flaws—as we all are. He was often intolerant even of friends who might disagree. He became increasingly crusty and belligerent with the passing of the years. When he was gently eased aside because the infirmities of old age made his work less effective, he became bitter. But God does not use perfect men in His church, and the Reformed faith owes more to Kuyper than it realizes. It is with sadness that Reformed men see the Kuyper of common grace extolled by today’s apostate church, while the Kuyper of sovereign and particular grace goes unremembered.\n\nHe died on November 8, 1920. The funeral, attended by thousands, was simple and without flowers. The climax was the thunderous singing of Kuyper’s favorite Psalm, 89:7, 8. On his tombstone were engraved the words: “Dr. A. Kuyper / Born October 29, 1837 / And fallen asleep in his Saviour November 8, 1920.”"
