To refresh you memory on who Kuyper is, here is the introductory paragraph from the previous post, with a fresh set of quotes then added…\n\nThe relationship between Christianity and politics is vexed, and for many (regardless if they know it or not) has been shaped by the thinking of Abraham Kuyper (1837-1920) who served as the 20th Prime Minister of the Netherlands from 1901-1905. A journalist, neo-Calvinist theologian and statesman, his political and theological views continue to be influential, especially in Reformed circles, and his thinking has impacted the views of Francis Schaeffer, Cornelius van Til, Alvin Plantinga, Nicholas Wolterstorff, Chuck Colson and Tim Keller – to name a few. Sadly his influence can also been seen in the rise of Christian Nationalism in South Africa, which in turn led to the Apartheid idealogy- a reminder that things do not always turn out just as we might imagine.\n\nThere is not a square inch in the whole domain of our existence over which Christ, who is sovereign over all, does not cry MINE – Abraham Kuyper\n\nWhatever man may stand, whatever he may do, whatever he may apply his hand – in agriculture, in commerce, and in industry, or his mind, in the world of art, and science – he is, whatsoever it may be, constantly standing before the face of God. He is employed in the service of his God. He has strictly to obey his God. And above all, he has to aim at the glory of his God – Abraham Kuyper\n\nThe holy art of “giving for Jesus’ sake” ought to be much more strongly developed among us Christians. Never forget that all state relief is a blot on the honour of your saviour. The fact that the government needs a safety net to catch those who slip between the cracks of our economic system is evidence that I have failed to do God’s work. The government cannot take the place of Christian charity. A loving embrace isn’t given with food stamps. The care of a community isn’t provided with government housing. The face of our Creator can’t be seen on a welfare voucher. What the poor need is not another government programme; what they need is for Christians like me to honour our saviour – Abraham Kuyper\n\nMore and more people imagine that Christ exists for our sake, while the much richer notion of our existing for the sake of Christ does not arise – Abraham Kuyper\n\nAs always, nice chatting…"
