        "text": "Steve Bishop writes about his recently-published paper on Kuyper. Abraham Kuyper (1837-1920) was a Dutch statesman, a theologian, a church reformer, a journalist and more. The recent project to translate his work into English has provided a stimulus for renewed interest in and work on Kuyper’s thought. Kuyper is also one Read more…\n\nAs the newest member of the Faith in Scholarship team, I’ve been asked to introduce myself as my colleagues have previously done. I am currently based in London (Ontario, Canada!) where I serve as chaplain and professor of theology at Western University. I also teach New Testament interpretation at Redeemer University part Read more…\n\nMike Wagenman takes a timely look at the power of big tech in the context of public theology. I’m honoured to introduce myself in this forum and suggest a way that Christian faith and the public academic vocation can fit together. My research takes place within the (Dutch) Reformed theological and Read more…\n\nFor anyone seeking an overview of Western philosophy from a Christian perspective, Bartholomew and Goheen’s latest book will be a welcome starting point. Written in an accessible and entertaining style, it takes us from the Pre-Socratic philosophers to the present day with illuminating commentary that reveals the authors’ wide-ranging expertise as philosopher-theologians in the tradition Read more…\n\nOne of the challenges facing Christians in many contemporary contexts is how to talk about our faith that Jesus is Lord and Saviour to the people we encounter at work. There may be several basic reasons why it’s difficult: Secularist attitudes (or even legislation) discourage it. We sense that it’s inappropriate Read more…\n\nRecently upon chatting with an older and wiser Christian we got onto the topic of discerning the idols of our culture. He, a pastor from Cambridge, quickly came out with the following: “healthcare and education”. Now, agree with him or not, his answer was telling. He continued by saying that Read more…\n\nA little while ago, I introduced you to Abraham Kuyper, also known as Abraham the Great. One of the things he was passionate about was Christian scholarship. This led him to founding and leading, as rector magnificus and as professor in theology and literature, a Christian university, the Free University in Amsterdam. Why Read more…\n\nRecently we’ve been running a mini-series of posts on “Why faith-in-scholarship?” These attempt to provide reasons for and excite Christian academics to be engaging their disciplines from a distinctly Christian perspective. Today we thought we’d share with you some aims of the FiSch Fellows, the team of us who write this blog Read more…\n\nWhen I moved from the Netherlands to the UK, I discovered that many British Christians knew the names of two Dutch Christians from the past: Corrie ten Boom [1] and Abraham Kuyper. However, though many had read some of Corrie ten Boom’s books, they did not know much about Abraham Read more…\n\nThe European Reformation of the 16th century clarified the distinction between Christianity and the Church.
