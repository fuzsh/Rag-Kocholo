        "text": "Abraham Kuyper (1837 – 1920)\n\nBorn: Maasluis, Holland\n\nRole: pastor, theologian, church leader, Prime Minister of the Netherlands\n\nEmphases: Calvinism, divine sovereignty, political pluralism, “sphere sovereignty”/pillarisation of society, work of the Holy Spirit\n\nProtested against: liberal/modernist theology; political revolutionarism, non-Christian ‘worldviews’\n\nAbraham Kuyper, the son of a Dutch Reformed minister, followed his father’s footsteps to study theology and enter the ministry in 1863, at age 25. Throughout his studies and into the early years of his ministry, Kuyper’s faith was infected with a theological modernism that led him to filter the truths of the gospel through a rationalistic framework. He was a spiritual bankrupt whose job was supposed to be instructing others in a faith he did not personally possess in truth.\n\nIt was Pietje Balthus, a single woman in his first congregation, who God used to give Kuyper a good shake-up and cause him to reconsider the evangelical faith. Balthus reportedly turned the tables on Kuyper during his first pastoral visit to her and confronted him with spiritual realities concerning salvation and eternity. Kuyper repeatedly returned for conversations with her and the Holy Spirit worked to change his heart and renew his mind in the gospel.\n\nA few years later, Kuyper was serving as a pastor in Amsterdam – the largest city in the Kingdom of the Netherlands – where he became one of the nation’s leading proponents of Reformed, evangelical orthodoxy. He acquired key newspapers to promote Reformed theology and Christian thinking in Dutch society and became increasingly active in various religious and political matters.\n\nThis mixture of a principled drive for religious and political reform led to Kuyper founding his own political party in 1879; a Reformed university in 1880; and a breakaway denomination, committed to the historical Reformed confessions, in 1886. These three endeavours encapsulated the multi-faceted significance of Kuyper as a political leader, church leader and internationally renowned theologian.\n\nKuyper was involved in Dutch politics from 1876 until his death in 1920. His Anti-Revolutionary Party was formed as a response to troubling, revolutionary manifestations of popular sovereignty in Europe, especially the French Revolution and the rise of Marxism. It sought to approach democratic politics from a uniquely Calvinistic/Protestant standpoint and build strategic alliances with Catholic political forces in order to withstand socialist and liberal movements within society that operated on assumptions that were antithetical to Christianity.\n\nKuyper’s great contributions to Christian political and social thought are “principled pluralism,” “pillarisation” and “sphere sovereignty.” Kuyper believed that when a nation like the Netherlands was apportioned into several major groupings with significantly different religious convictions (i.e. Reformed; Catholic; Socialist and ‘Liberal’) that each should have the freedom to operate as distinct society within one the nation-state and that the state should not preference or discriminate with respect to any single group, nor unnecessarily interfere with their self-expression of their religious identities.\n\nPrincipled pluralism was about being committed to religious freedom, power-sharing and mutual, civic respect between such groups, rather than a “winner-takes-it-all” or “revenge-cycle” approach to national politics. Pillarisation was the belief that each group would do best if they were allowed to form and operate their own institutions (churches, schools, media etc;) in line with their convictions. “Sphere sovereignty” denied the state unrestrained authority over each area of people’s lives, by insisting that different spheres of human life had legitimate authority to govern their own affairs (eg; churches, families and schools were not properly under the jurisdictional control of the state government).\n\nKuyper made an enormous contribution to Dutch and European politics through his promotion of these principles, the effect of which is still seen in some European countries and Christian Democratic Parties today. His political success saw him serve one term as Dutch Prime Minister from 1901-1905. Some of his most significant achievements during office were related to his vision for robust, independent religious schools throughout the Netherlands.\n\nAs a church leader, Kuyper led a Reformed resurgence in the Netherlands, which put him at loggerheads with proponents of the modernistic theology he himself had held to as a young man. Like Martin Luther’s attempt to reform the Catholic Church, Kuyper’s efforts at reform were repudiated by the hierarchy of the Dutch Reformed Church and he ended up on the outside. Kuyper’s followers and allies became known as the Doleantie – a Dutch term describing profound grief. They soon merged with an earlier breakaway denomination from the Dutch Reformed Church and established the “Reformed Churches in the Netherlands” in 1892, as a Reformed-orthodox alternative to the increasingly liberal state church.\n\nAs a theologian and academic scholar, Kuyper led the Free University in Amsterdam and ensured that students of the Reformed faith received a quality tertiary education that aligned with their religious convictions. He wrote and lectured in theology and socio-political issues, producing an Encyclopedia of Sacred Theology, a serialisation of articles on the Work of the Holy Spirit and delivering his famous Lectures on Calvinism at Princeton University in the United States.\n\nThe impact of Kuyper’s legacy has been widespread in Reformed Christianity in the century since his life. There are a range of NeoCalvinist figures and institutions in the United States that are heavily indebted to Kuyper’s thought and a number of organisations seek to approach political and cultural issues in a manner that follows his example and implements his key principles. On the darker side, Kuyper’s concept of pillarisation was bastardised by Afrikaners to justify the racial discrimination of apartheid in South Africa for many years, while theonomists and Reconstructionists in the United States have also misappropriated his ideas to claim support for their vision of a nation rearranged under biblical laws.\n\nKuyper’s most famous quote: “There is not a square inch in the whole domain of our human existence over which Christ, who is sovereign over all, does not cry ‘Mine!'” summarises his significance as a Protestant figure. His belief in the absolute sovereignty of God led him to earnestly seek the reform of church and society so that God’s people could live in a way that declared the glory of their Heavenly King.\n\nKuyper did not possess all the answers in response to the challenges of modernism, nor can we expect him to provide a fully-formed response to the post-modern era we find ourselves in. But he is an invaluable, historical dialogue-partner for Christians in the West today who are seeking to live out their faith in ‘liberal,’ ‘secular’ ‘democracies’ and wrestling with how to do so in a way that is faithful to the breadth and depth of our evangelical convictions.\n\nSources\n\nJ.D.
