        "text": "Dies Natalis is the day on which VU Amsterdam was founded, in other words, the university’s birthday. Although VU Amsterdam’s actual birthday is 20 October, the celebrations have been moved to Friday 6 November this year to be closer to the 100th anniversary of Kuyper’s death (8 November), in honour of his status as a figure who continues to inspire us today.\n\nThis year’s Dies Natalis Lecture was given by a very special speaker: Her Majesty Queen Máxima. She discussed promoting entrepreneurship.\n\nEntrepreneurship is the very foundation of our prosperity and employment market; it is what gives our society its resilience and optimism about the future. Now that large sections of the business community are being badly affected by the coronavirus pandemic, particularly in the SME sector, we face a double challenge. Not only do we need to ensure that healthy businesses can survive the crisis, but we also need to maximize our capacity for growth in the longer term. As a member of the Netherlands Entrepreneurship Committee, this is a subject that Her Majesty Queen Máxima is particularly committed to. How can we ensure we have a dynamic business sector, both now and in the future? How can we finance the investment that is necessary for education, innovation and growth? Which management style and forms of business have the most potential? And how can we as (future) entrepreneurs and employees continue to get the best out of ourselves and continue to take pleasure in our work? Queen Máxima shares her perspective with us.\n\nAt this celebratory gathering, honorary doctorates were also awarded to three individuals who have made their mark in the public domain at home and abroad in recent years: Khadija Arib, Ernst Fehr and Anne-Marie Slaughter.\n\nThe actor and speaker Bright Richards (New Dutch Connections) gave a performance, and our Writer in Residence Maxim Februari shared his thoughts with us in the form of a spoken column.\n\nWatch the registration of the Dies Natalis\n\nWe filmed three talk shows, during which we collected advice on how to improve education in the Netherlands. During the talk shows, an expert panel hosted by Karim Amghar discussed good examples in education. Those watching online were asked to contribute their own suggestions. An editorial board chaired by Renée van Schoonhoven assessed all the advice collected and selected the 23 most valuable recommendations for how to achieve outstanding education. During a concluding meeting on 21 April 2021 the 23 recommendations were presented by Renée van Schoonhoven to the chair of the National Education Council, Edith Hooge. That meeting was chaired by Paul Rosenmöller, chair of the Secondary Education Council.\n\nDuring three talk shows, we collected recommendations on how to improve education in the Netherlands. In these talkshows, an expert panel discussed good examples in education, led by presenter Karim Amghar. We also asked the digital audience for additions and their own suggestions. An editorial board chaired by Renée van Schoonhoven assessed the collected recommendations and selected the 23 most valuable recommendations for particularly good education. The 23 recommendations were then presented at a final meeting at the Vrije Universiteit on April 21, 2021. This meeting was led by Paul Rosenmöller, chair of the Secondary Education Council. There, the editorial chairman handed over the recommendations to Education Council President Edith Hooge.\n\nThe themes for the three talk shows were: citizenship education, good governance and equal educational opportunities. Because of the coronation measures, the talkshows were broadcast from the VU.\n\nYou can watch the talkshows here.\n\nDuring the Opening of the Academic Year on Monday 31 August, the Kuyper Year, with a special focus on social entrepreneurship, has officially commenced. Abraham Kuyper founded VU Amsterdam with funds from brewer Willem Hovy; a type of social entrepreneurship before it was officially invented. During economic downturns, the VU community is always bursting with innovative ideas that deserve an entrepreneurial approach. This entrepreneurial approach to ideas will be making a vital difference. More than ever before, VU Amsterdam wants to be an incubator for start-ups. During the OAY Mirjam van Praag, President of the Executive Board, discussed inspirational VU examples with top executive Marry de Gaay Fortman and management guru Ben Tiggelaar and Van Praag introduced the new Kuyper Challenge; a competition for VU Amsterdam students and recent graduates with entrepreneurial ideas to propel our society forward.\n\nWatch the registration of the OAY here"
