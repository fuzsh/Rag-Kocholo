        "text": "Cross\"\n\nIntroduction\n\nThis book about Abraham Kuyper is both short and personal.\n\nI decided to make it short because I want to introduce some basics about Kuyper’s thought for readers who may be curious enough about this nineteenth-century Dutch leader to read a fairly concise introduction. Kuyper has some enthusiastic devotees in the English-speaking world, and there are probably some out there who wonder what all the fuss is about, even though they may not be eager to know every detail. This book is meant to satisfy that kind of curiosity. There is a growing body of excellent and detailed scholarly commentary on Kuyper’s views on many subjects, but my intention here is to offer something that will be read by folks who might not make their way through some of those otherwritings—or, better yet, who may need a nudge in the direction of more serious engagement.\n\nBut this is also a very personal introduction to Kuyper. Abraham Kuyper covered a lot of subjects, and I am not even going to begin to cover all of the ground he covered. My focus is going to be on the Kuyper who lured me in.\n\nThe Lure of Kuyper\n\nI encountered Kuyper as a formative influence during the last half of the 1960s. It wasn’t that he had been a total stranger prior to that period in my life; I had actually read one of his long theological treatises, Principles of Sacred Theology, when it was an assigned textbook in a seminary course that I had taken earlier in the decade. Yet only when I turned to Kuyper’s writings about issues of public life did I find exactly what I urgently needed.\n\nIn the late 1960s I found myself immersed in the turmoil of secular university campus life. It precipitated a crisis of faith for me, as I wrestled much with how I as a Christian should be dealing with some of the big issues being debated in American public life. This was the time of the civil rights movement and the bitter debates about the legitimacy of the war in Vietnam.\n\nI felt ill-prepared for these challenges as an evangelical Christian. I had been raised in the kind of evangelical environment where the life of the mind was not held in high regard. We were suspicious of worldly learning. I had made my way out of that kind of anti-intellectualism, but I still was not sure where to look for help in finding an alternative to the other-worldly mentality of my younger years. I had been told often that getting involved in social action was not the kind of thing God wanted from us. One of the favorite lines I heard from preachers as a kid was that trying to improve things here on earth is like trying to rearrange the deck chairs on the Titanic. The attitude we were to have toward this world was summed up nicely in a song we often sang:\n\nThis world is not my home, I’m just a-passing through.\n\nMy treasures are laid up somewhere beyond the blue.\n\nThe angels beckon me from heaven’s open door,\n\nand I can’t feel at home in this world anymore.\n\nEager to distance myself from that mentality—especially given the pressures of the activist sixties—I explored other theological alternatives. But it was a frustrating time for me spiritually and theologically. I was not attracted to a liberal social gospel approach. And while the social teachings of the Catholic tradition made some sense to me, I was not ready to travel the road to Rome.\n\nIt was during this time that I came upon Abraham Kuyper’s Lectures on Calvinism, the Stone Lectures that he had delivered at Princeton Seminary during his 1898 visit to the United States. In Kuyper’s robust Calvinism I discovered what I had been looking for: a vision of active involvement in public life that would allow me to steer my way between a privatized evangelicalism on the one hand and the liberal Protestant or Catholic approaches to public discipleship on the other hand. I have attempted to walk in this way ever since.\n\nFocusing on Culture\n\nBecause what I will be discussing in these pages is my own personal take on Kuyper, I will purposely be concentrating on what I am calling his theology of culture. To be sure, there is a lot more to Kuyper. He addressed many audiences and in many formats. He authored technical works on difficult theological topics; he gave speeches to farmers’ associations and labor unions; he preached sermons and wrote meditations on biblical texts; and as a highly visible politician he articulated positions on countless matters of public policy. So I am going to be very selective in what I cover here.\n\nTo say all of that, of course, is itself an important introduction to Kuyper. If someone were to make a list of the most energetic multitaskers in the history of Christian thought, Abraham Kuyper would certainly rank high. He founded a newspaper, a university, a political party, and a denomination. Nor was he content to start something and then move on to a different project. During his career, which lasted from his ordination in the 1860s until his death in 1920, he regularly wrote articles for his newspaper; he taught theology at the Free University; he led his party both as a member of the Dutch parliament and, for a few years, as Prime Minister. And all the while he played an active role in the life (and controversies) of the Dutch Reformed churches, often addressing the issues by writing major theological books and essays.\n\nThe influence of Kuyper’s thought has long been felt in the Reformed—especially Dutch Calvinist—branch of American evangelicalism, but more recently the interest in his ideas has extended beyond those circles. His name turns up these days in more general discussions of Christian social thought and civil society, and his views are often compared to, or contrasted with, the Puritan political traditions, the liberal social gospel theology, recent Catholic social thought, and contemporary explorations in the social sciences.\n\nThe North American interest in Kuyper has now been advanced significantly by the establishing in 2002 of the Abraham Kuyper Center for Public Theology at Princeton Theological Seminary. The Center, which houses a major collection of Kuyper-related materials, sponsors an annual Kuyper Prize Lecture, accompanied by a conference on Kuyperian topics, as well as publishing the The Kuyper Center Review.\n\nAn Important Voice\n\nI have written this short and personal introduction to Kuyper because I am convinced his voice continues to speak in important ways. He certainly can be a big help to evangelical Protestants in the United States. During one of the public debates over potential justices for the United States Supreme Court, a political journalist observed that evangelical Protestants regularly make a lot of noise about such matters, but when conservative candidates come to the fore, they are typically Roman Catholics. The pundit remarked that this was a sign that evangelical Protestantism, in contrast to Catholicism, lacks intellectual heft.¹\n\nThat journalist had it pretty much right when it comes to theological perspectives on questions of public policy. Evangelicals have been a prominent presence in public life in recent years, but we have not been known for having a coherent theological-philosophical perspective on our efforts to influence the policies and practices of the larger society. Kuyper can be an important guide in this regard. As we will see, there is plenty in Kuyper that needs updating and even serious correcting. Yet almost a century after his passing, he still has some vital insights to offer about Christian cultural and political discipleship.\n\n1.

But in the rural village where he served his first pastorate he encountered parishioners who exhibited a vibrant evangelical faith, and through his contacts with them he experienced a life-changing evangelical conversion. The person who initially influenced him in this regard was Pietje Baltus, the young daughter of a miller. Pietje was known in the community to be a person of deep spirituality, but she did not regularly attend the worship services, choosing instead to meet in private homes with others who shared her Calvinist faith.\n\nWhen Kuyper found out that she was boycotting his services because of the content of his preaching, he paid her a pastoral visit. When he arrived at her home, she refused to shake his hand. This was a gesture of disrespect, and she was obviously signaling her rejection of his pastoral authority. Instead of being offended, though, Kuyper listened carefully to what she had to say, and he made a point of pursuing further conversations with Pietje and her friends. Later he wrote: I did not set myself against them, and I still thank my God that I made the choice I did. Their unwavering persistence has been a blessing for my heart, the rise of the morning star in my life.¹\n\nCreation’s Square Inches\n\nHaving embraced evangelical Calvinism, Kuyper ever thereafter placed a strong emphasis on personal piety. In the midst of his busy public career he wrote hundreds of meditations about the need for the individual believer to turn away from the demands of the active life and retreat into that very private sacred space where the soul is alone with her Maker.\n\nBut Kuyper was not content with a religion that was limited to the cultivation of a purely personal spirituality. In addition to his celebration of the experience of a Savior’s love, he also placed a strong emphasis on the supreme Lordship of Jesus Christ over all"
