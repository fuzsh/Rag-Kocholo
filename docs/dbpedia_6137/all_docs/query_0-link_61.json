        "text": "Bern Grush - Harmonize Mobility Inc. - Co-author of “The End of Driving”. Toronto, Canada\n\nMost times, when we choose to watch a documentary, it is about something for which we have only a passing acquaintance if that. Say a documentary about an ancient civilization, an unsolved crime, or the discovery of oxygen. We could also watch a documentary about something very intimate that we happen to be remarkably ignorant of, such as our digestive system or the sort of cancer that afflicts one of our family members. You watch any of these documentaries knowing you do not know much and might find it interesting or useful to know more.\n\nA documentary about cars, roads, and congestion doesn’t seem to follow that pattern. Most of us have an intimate relationship with traffic of whatever flavor happens to fill our usually tedious hour of travel each day. We certainly think we already know enough about this thing that we either hate or tolerate — after all, traffic and congestion gets more media play than the weather. And you learn painfully more each day from each person who comes late to a meeting or date. Many are eager to tell you whose fault all this is and how to solve it.\n\nSo, who can still be curious?\n\nConsider that like the irony that most of us know very little about how our bodies work, we know as little about how we became so tightly bound up with the automobile. We rarely see the full extent. Every interdependency. Every connection, every trap that holds us.\n\nOr most of us.\n\nIf you are willing to consider there might be something more profound in all of this other than merely arranging our roads and transport systems better than we have done. Something more than just electric cars and better subways. If you are inclined to consider our economic, social and emotional affair with the automobile, our mid-era break-up with the family car and the potential — or even the existential need — to love our cities differently. Then Life On Wheels is the best way to inform that consideration.\n\nSobering is the horror of how we’ve abused these two stunning inventions — city and the car — and even more remarkable is the payment automobility has exacted in blood, treasure, time, environment, and health. Why is it that what so surrounds us — sometimes even seems to drown us — drops to the sub-conscious level of noise? The societal noise of our cities and our civilization?\n\nThe film’s voice-over answers thus: “At the birth of every culture there is a tool, a technology, an idea, a new way to fulfill our most basic human desires. It begins as a promise and becomes an organizing principle. It unfolds a series of choices, each one shaping our movement, our identities, and our lives – often in ways we have never imagined.”\n\nWe’re in so deep — like fish in water — we don’t even see it.\n\nI confirmed this by watching Life On Wheels with two older friends, both retired office workers, life-long drivers, and very typical North Americans. I lost count of the number of times one or the other exclaimed: “I had no idea!”\n\nFor someone like me, born mid-20th-century, raised in semi-rural Pennsylvania, the idea of not-car was unthinkable. Like not-legs. Cars were simple. My father was able to repair anything that needed fixing. We were never without wheels. It never even occurred to me to ask, “what if we didn’t have a car?” I drove from 16.\n\nWhen I think back about my experience with automobility, I have lived almost every frame of this film. My parents were the caricatured ‘50s mom and dad. Dad was always driving the station wagon; me and four siblings in the back. There were no seat belts. Signaling a turn meant an arm out the window.\n\nI worked on road crews bulldozing new roads, moving creeks, erasing habitat, pouring concrete, and cheating on the drain tile when the state inspector was off-site at lunch. I sailed on Sun Oil tankers carrying crude from Texas to a refinery in Marcus Hook (I still remember the choke of sulfured air). I have owned nine or ten cars, and gotten a few dozen speeding tickets, had six or seven fender benders. Drove when I shouldn’t have. I finally stopped owning a car in 2019 after 50 years dedicated to getting around on my wheels. I can’t count the miles or the dollars. Or the hours. I often wondered how I escaped a severe crash.\n\nI have spent the majority of my professional career surveying the planet’s surface condition, developing technology for road-pricing, parking management, and now automated vehicles.\n\nWho would say I was not intimate with automobility?\n\nLife On Wheels, gorgeously shot and beautifully edited — its interviewees in black suspense, freed of background distraction — taught me that I was only intimate with its first half. The half is getting from 1890 to now. I have been part of the army of innovators tweaking the systems we have, in my case, trying to improve automobility by shifting and smoothing demand through road and parking pricing. Eager to see optimized use of our cars, I paid far less attention to other modalities, to housing, to transit optimization, to active transportation, and the changing nature of cities themselves.\n\nI knew all these things were valuable, even interconnected. But I did not fully appreciate that I had it backward. We need to optimize everything else — housing, zoning, transit, systems (and attitudes) for active transportation — before we could maximize automobility.\n\nWe can’t fix automobility without addressing the whole system. We can’t have people consider more fair use of private cars until we can attract them to better alternatives — and we have egregiously failed to do that. We have broken so many parts of how mobility and cities and society fit together. The automobility we now have is the ugly glue that holds it all together (some would say “keeps it all apart”) while simultaneously acting to pervert alternative solutions.\n\nWill reconsidering the full spectrum of mobility and its urban-factors and rethinking how we motorize private movement — perhaps automating it and divorcing it from private ownership as is now so dominant — provide us with a way out?\n\nIf not, then what?\n\nBern Grush\n\nJessica Alba – Policy advisor on sustainable and emerging mobility - Stanford University\n\nThe documentary Life on Wheels could not have been released at a more ideal time. We are at the cusp of a mobility revolution and, if guided in the right direction, the societal benefits will be immense.\n\nWhen the groundbreaking film An Inconvenient Truth came out in 2006, it prompted millions to ask questions about climate change for the very first time. It raised awareness at an unprecedented level and brought the topic to the forefront across the globe. I believe Life on Wheels can bring the same level of knowledge to the complex subject of mobility and all the facets and forces associated with it.\n\nFrom the very first minute of the documentary, David and Hi-Jin Hodge put a spell on the audience with a – literal – crash course in how our auto-dominated societies are impacting our lives. Sobering facts mixed with reflections from dozens of brilliant minds in the mobility space, along with breathtaking imagery, keep you at the edge of your seat, wondering what comes next.\n\nThe filmmakers take us on a journey through the darker sides of our love affair with the car. Traffic collisions, fatalities and injuries, air pollution, greenhouse gas emissions, congestion, cardiovascular and respiratory disease, the mental and emotional toll of being stuck in traffic, recovering from or have lost someone close in a car crash, the difficulty of getting around without a car, the high cost of owning a car – the list goes on.\n\nWe are also introduced to several opportunities that new and groundbreaking technology promises us — driverless cars, micromobility services, transportation-as-a-service, just to name a few. The film could very well have focused on these technological advancements and ended there. However, what I love the most about this documentary is that it allows the audience to recognize that technology and innovation are not the end goals here. The real goal is to bring back the focus onto us, the people, and our public spaces. How can we ensure that technology benefits our cities and built environment, and not the other way around? And how can cities and public agencies prepare for the inevitable paradigm shift that we're beginning to take shape? I'm not going to give the solutions away – you will have to watch the film and draw your conclusions. And I think you will love this film too.\n\nJessica Alba studied Earth and Environmental Sciences at Lund University in Sweden in the 90s and moved to the San Francisco Bay Area in 2004. With a strong foundation centered on sustainability, she merged her academic knowledge with a love for vibrant communities. Over the past two decades she has consulted and advised on hundreds of projects and policy efforts in the sustainable and emerging mobility realm. She is optimistic about the future, recognizing that as long as we promote sustainable practices, our cities and suburbs can mature beautifully through the coming mobility revolution."
