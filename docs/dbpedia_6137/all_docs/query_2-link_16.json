        "text": "Movie Title: The Way, My Way\n\nIf you have ever wanted to know what all the fuss is about walking the Camino Frances in Spain, then this movie is for you. The photography is gorgeous – truly capturing the beauty of Spain, plus the personalities are real and the friendships are warm.\n\nWhile The Way movie, starring Martin Sheen and Emilio Estevez, captured some of the feel of the path and kickstarted a massive influx of pilgrims, it was a Hollywood movie. This film is based on a true story.\n\nBut first, a little background…\n\nBackground & Connections:\n\nI stumbled across Bill Bennett and his book, The Way, My Way, back in 2021. A few people had suggested that I should read his book as I was a dyed-in-the-wool camino addict and he lived in my own home town.\n\nAs you can imagine, his book really resonated with me (Camino Addicts of the World Unite! 😊) and I shared a review of the book with you here. Since that time, I have met Bill and his partner Jennifer in person, and we have formed a small camino group to share all things camino with pilgrims and would-be pilgrims. All the reminiscing is a lot of fun. Did someone say camino bore?\n\nBill walked the Camino Frances back in the Spring of 2013. Unbeknownst to us, we followed in his footsteps in the Autumn. He wrote a blog and generated a book out of his experience, while I kept a private journal and generated an impressive range of blisters and missing toenails due to poorly fitting footwear. I also collected some fantastic memories.\n\nUnlike myself, Bill and Jennifer have had long careers in the film and television industries, and perhaps it was a natural progression for Bill to turn his book into a film. After a true labour of love, this film had its World premiere at the historic Mt Vic Flicks cinema on 16 April 2024.\n\nI have never attended a World premiere before and we were exceptionally pleased and proud to be part of the sell-out audience. The audience was chockful of fellow camino addicts with a strong representation from the Blue Mountains Camino Supporters group and the Australian Friends of the Camino Inc. En masse, we all laughed at the appropriate parts of the film as so many of us had had similar experiences to Bill. Who hasn’t weighed their underpants in an effort to reduce the weight of their backpack?\n\nAs the credits rolled, Bill, Jennifer and Johnnie Walker (genuine camino royalty) took to the stage and the audience had the opportunity to participate in a Q&A. It was a great way to understand the mechanics of film making and what it took to bring it to life up on the big screen. One of the most interesting facts was that only four professional actors appeared in the entire film. Many of the ‘extras’ were actual pilgrims who just happened to be walking past the film set at the right time.\n\nBut, how does the Promotional Blurb describe The Way, My Way?\n\nSynopsis: The Way, My Way is the charming and captivating true story of a stubborn and amusingly self-centred Australian man who decides to walk the 800 kilometre-long Camino de Santiago pilgrimage route through Spain. He doesn’t know why he’s doing it, but one step at a time it will change him and his outlook on life forever. Based on Bill Bennett’s best-selling memoir of the same name, The Way, My Way has been described by Camino elder statesman Johnnie Walker as the most authentic film ever made about the Camino. Source\n\nMy Thoughts:\n\nThis is a wonderfully gentle movie. Don’t watch this movie expecting an action-packed blockbuster with twisting plots and suspenseful interludes. Likewise, don’t go to the cinema expecting sex, drugs, violence and excessive bad language. It is a joy just to sit and be slowly swept along on Bill’s journey.\n\nAt the World premiere this movie was definitely preaching to the converted and for me, it was a wonderful trip down memory lane. I loved seeing all the sweeping vistas and beautiful scenery. Many times I nudged The Husband whispering “remember this?”.\n\nI suspect that like many other pilgrims, I have watched almost every camino movie and documentary ever made. The beauty of The Way, My Way is that it is based on a true story and delivers an authentic, honest and true representation of what it is like to walk a camino in Spain. In particular, the film nails the human element of walking a camino – the friendships, the ebb and flow of connection with other walkers, as well as a small handful of people that it wouldn’t matter if you never met again.\n\nI loved that many of the people in the film were real pilgrims who happened to walk through the film set, as well as many of Bill’s long-standing camino friends returning from all over Europe to star as themselves in the film. These are true camino friendships.\n\nI highly recommend this film if you:\n\nHave walked a camino in the past and are in need of a camino fix. I guarantee it will give you itchy feet!\n\nAre thinking about walking a camino one day and would like to see what is ahead of you, or\n\nWould like a feel-good movie experience with breathtaking scenery and likeable characters. And Yes, there is a happy ending.\n\nSo, what are you waiting for? The movie opens across Australia in Hoyts cinemas on May 16, 2024. Keep your eye out for it in International cinemas too.\n\nBuen Camino to you.\n\nFilmmaker Bio: The filmmakers are Bill Bennett and Jennifer Cluff, one of Australia’s most experienced and respected producing teams, having made 17 feature films and numerous documentaries over a forty-year period. Bill has received Australian Film Institute Awards for Best Film and Best Director, he’s had two films in Official Selection at the Cannes Film Festival, four films in Toronto, and had three major international retrospectives.\n\nBill first walked the Camino de Santiago in 2013, then wrote a book about his experiences - The Way, My Way - which became a best seller. He’s since walked four more Caminos.\n\nJennifer Cluff is not only a producer but an actress, having starred in the classic ABC series Seven Little Australians. She’s since worked in theatre, television and film. She’s also a dramaturge and script editor, working on screenplays and novels for major publishing houses. She´s walked four Caminos.
