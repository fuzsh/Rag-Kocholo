        "text": "Little Man only knew his grandfather after Pops had had a stroke and needed to use a wheelchair, but that never stopped the pair from doing all the little things families do together—and it never stopped them from having a special bond.\n\nBetter known as Levi, Little Man “had this understanding that my dad (Pops) needed a different kind of attention,” says Nikki G. Stahl of her nephew. “And my dad got such a kick out of him. He’d always ask, ‘Where is Little Man?’”\n\nIn 2021, Nikki wrote a children’s book, “Pops on Wheels,” inspired by the relationship between Nikki’s then-11- month-old nephew and her father.\n\nThe book is the first from the Thousand Oaks resident, a screenplay writer and director who owns a film production company, Nik + Jax Productions, with her husband, Jackson.\n\nNikki, who’s lived in California for about a dozen years, was thrilled when her parents decided around four years ago to move from New York to join her and her sister, Jackie, on the West Coast. The reunited family members went back to celebrating birthdays, going out to dinner and enjoying day-to-day moments together.\n\nIt was her parents who first fell in love with the Westlake/Thousand Oaks area. Nikki had been living in the Los Angeles area but moved north after her father, Robert Ganz, had a stroke.\n\n“We were all-hands-on-deck taking care of him,” Nikki says. “Everything became about making quality of life the best possible.”\n\nThat’s the way her father had always lived, she adds, taking notice of and appreciating the little moments in life.\n\nWhen she decided to write the book, initially meant only as a birthday gift for her nephew, she wanted to capture that trait.\n\n“The book itself is sort of about the simple, everyday things in life,” she says. “There is so much love in those—and you have so many more of those moments than the big ones; they build a lifetime.”\n\nBecause it was so personal and meant to be such a personal gift to Levi— Nikki’s son, Milo, had not yet been born when the book idea was being formed— Nikki wanted it to authentically pay homage to her family, even down to what the characters looked like. To that end, she tried her hand at illustrating with the help, in part, of YouTube lessons.\n\n“For this project, I had a very clear idea of what I wanted it to look like,” she says. “It was really necessary (that) this character was my dad.”\n\nAs the book developed, Robert, who would sit for the drawings, got to watch its progress. Life progressed as well.\n\n“He got to meet my son. He walked me down the aisle, and he was there through my entire pregnancy,” Nikki says. “It’s this period we almost didn’t have. We are so fortunate.”\n\nIt’s the period her family calls “the gifted time.”\n\nThat Robert would be supportive during that time was no surprise to the family. He was the kind of dad who read every school paper and coached every sports team. Nikki calls him her best friend.\n\nAn important aspect of the book, now that Nikki has published it, is sharing that the end of life as one has known it doesn’t mean the end of life.\n\n“None of us had any idea what life would look like (after his stroke). . . . We didn’t know we could get back this whole life that was very full and very beautiful,” she says. “For people at the beginning of the journey, there is fear and sadness and all of that, and I wanted to create some hope.”\n\nJudging by the positive responses the lyrical 32-page book has received, it appears the author was successful.\n\n“It was all good feedback from everybody who read the book,” says family friend Greg Leone. “They thought it was informative and a loving story, and they liked that their kids got to see from a little bit of a different viewpoint.”\n\nGreg owns Leone’s Original Italian Ices, the location for one of Nikki’s early book readings. It might not be a traditional reading location, but the Thousand Oaks shop made perfect sense, Greg says.\n\n“We cater to kids and that demographic,” he adds. “I was flattered that Nikki asked us to do it.”\n\nFor Nikki, every reading is an opportunity to share her love for her dad, who died a year ago, and the kind of person he was.\n\nPerhaps that’s why the book ends the way it does—by encouraging kids to spread happiness: “If you see my Pops or his friends on wheels, send a wave and a smile to give lots of good feels.”\n\n“My dad . . . would secretly go out in the world and do good, and I’m hoping this does the same thing,” Nikki says."
