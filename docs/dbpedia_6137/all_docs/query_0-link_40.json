        "text": "The Peanut Pals' passion for the iconic MR. PEANUT® is simply unmatched\n\nAUSTIN, Minn., Aug. 7, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- More than a century ago, a 14-year-old named Antonio Gentile entered a contest with a sketch, hoping to create a new PLANTERS® brand icon. A top hat, a monocle, and a cane were later added to that sketch of a smiling peanut, and thus, the iconic MR. PEANUT® was born. MR. PEANUT® has since become a globally recognized figure, appearing not only on PLANTERS® product packaging, but also on a wide range of merchandise; from antique signage and trinkets, to figurines of the dapper legume, himself.\n\nHormel Foods, which acquired the PLANTERS® brand in 2021, is today spotlighting a group of superfans that collectively possess thousands of pieces of MR. PEANUT® merchandise. A cohort comprised of more than 400 MR. PEANUT® collectors, the Peanut Pals are celebrated in the latest Inspired Fans™ film from Hormel Foods — Legendary Legume: The Peanut Pals and MR. PEANUT®.\n\n\"These amazing folks really do love me, and let me tell you, the feeling is mutual,\" said MR. PEANUT®, spokesperson for the PLANTERS® brand. \"The Peanut Pals' passion for the PLANTERS® brand never ceases to amaze me, and I am honored to hold such a special place in their hearts. They certainly hold a special place in mine.\"\n\nSince 1978, the Peanut Pals have regularly gathered at convention-style events across the country, giving each collector an opportunity to showcase their stockpile of MR. PEANUT® keepsakes, not only with each other, but with the public, as well. The Peanut Pals' unrelenting passion for MR. PEANUT® is what keeps them coming back year after year, always in search of new items to add to their respective collections.\n\n\"There's just something about MR. PEANUT®,\" said Scott Schmitz, president of the Peanut Pals. \"We enjoy what he does. We want to follow his journey. We've seen where he's been, and we want to know what he's going to do in the future. That's what we're all about.\"\n\nFor more information about the Peanut Pals, visit www.peanutpals.org.\n\nAbout the Planters® Brand\n\nFounded in 1906 in Wilkes-Barre, Pa., the Planters® brand has been the ultimate snacking solution for consumers for over a century with a vast portfolio of peanuts, snackable nut mixes, seeds, and so much more.
