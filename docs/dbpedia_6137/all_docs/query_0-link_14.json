        "text": "...does anyone remember this? It was shown with 'Grease' in the UK cinemas in late 1978 so I must have seen it a couple of dozen times. It was a documentary featuring Stacey Peralta and Tony Alva, and I'd love to see it again but can't find it anywhere. It had a great 60s/70s soundtrack. Can anyone help?\n\nThanks Ere. This one was in 1978 and the soundtrack was stuff like 'She's About A Mover' and various Bubblegum songs. It was a sort of 'day in the life' of Tony Alva and Stacey. I know of the one you mention. So it's worth a glance eh?\n\nDefinitely, one of the best stories told by documentary I've seen in years. One of their own was taking movies the whole time the gang was skating back then, along with some phenomenal still shots, which are woven into the narrative ... interspersed with recent interviews of the same skaters and an effective window into seventies and early eighties southern California.\n\nPeralta's documentary on extreme surfing, 'Riding Giants' is also superb and has a great soundtrack too.\n\nThe only other thing I can think of is Skateboard which had Alva playing a part but not Peralta. Typical dopey 70's drive-in fodder from 1977. It did have a UK release. The only thing that stands out in this film may be the soundtrack with three tunes from..... Mickey Thomas. Even warranted an RCA vinyl release (one on ebay now for a hundred bucks for the completist).\n\nThose stills look familiar, thanks! I especially remember the bit where Stacey was popping several 360s in both directions (!) for a minute or two without putting the front down! It drove me and my friends nuts with our cheap 'boards! I saved my money and got some red Kryptonics (two at a time!) then some ACS 580s, learned to ride the half-pipe. Could never afford one of those Alva decks, with the wide Gullwings and Bones Park Riders. Anyway......within two years of all that it was BMX. Wonderful time!\n\nHi folks.\n\nJust a some info to the skate movie Hot wheels.It was shot mostly in a old skate park in North London i dont think Stacy Peralta was in it.There was a young kid called Otto in it who told his mate to do an airborne.Also there was some footage of South Bank and hyde park.The hyde park shot had some lads doing some down hill skating with the track Oxygen playing.Hope this brings back memories.Had it on tape from telly back cant find it.Anyone got it.\n\nCheers Kev\n\nYeh, that's the one. I went down to the south bank in '78 to check it out. Just concrete slabs set off the paving at 40 degrees but it drew a lot of skaters. Some of the american guys came up to Liverpool in '79 to do a show. They were WAY to trusting and left their boards lying around between demonstrations. The scallys descended and cleaned them up. There were guys down at otterspool prom riding G&S fibreflexes with ACS 650s and brand new Kryps the next week trying to sell them for fifty quid!\n\nAnyone remember the spherical skateboard wheels 'Fireballs'?\n\npic is Hyde Park, '77\n\nThis brings back some memories and that pineappley smell of new grip tape. Thanks guys! Kev I must be getting mixed up with other movies at the time - I definitely remember the South Bank stuff now you mention it. But I remember Stacy doing 360s and Tony Alva eating doughnuts for breakfast.\n\n'Uptown Top Ranking' by Althea and Donna and there was a Scott Joplin rag playing whilst some guys did a downhill slalom - does that sound familiar Kev?\n\nSouth Bank was a bit disappointing. But there was a proper skateboard park Skate City (was that the name?) near Tower Bridge in the late 70s.\n\nHello again.\n\nThat is the movie i remember Uptown top rankin.Class track.So how can we find a copy off the movie.I have scoured all my sources and found nothing cant even find the title anywhere.This is the first source i have found that even mentions it.I am hoping that i find it back at me maw's house stuck on a shelf coverd in dust lol.Oh and by the way Grease is the word!!.\n\nKev\n\nps I recall the dude doing the 360ts Maybe was Stacy P\n\nThe smell of new urethane was totally intoxicating. I think I spent more time sniffing my Sims Pure-juice than actually riding them..\n\nWhat colour kryps did you have? Do you remember the original greens, transparent rather than that frog green? The 60mm were highly regarded..'little green dragons'. Blue kryps seemed the least popular but I liked them. Red wore down way to quickly on the munted pavements of Liverpool. 'Bones' were the big sensation in late '79. I never tried them. About that time there was a massive wave of the US skater sponsored product hitting the UK and I remember getting the UK 'Skateboard' magazine and being amazed by all these new wheels and trucks suddenly coming out.\n\nI discovered alcohol that year and skateboarding started to lose it's attraction for me....."
