        "text": "Theatre has been an integral part of society since the dawn of time. Performance is ingrained in human nature, regardless of social or economic status, ethnicity, and age. We all perform, even in our daily life. That doesn’t mean we lie, but rather that we consciously try to present ourselves in the best light possible in order to achieve something we really care about.\n\nThink about a job interview. If you want the job and if you think the job is the right one for you, you will try to positively impress the interviewer. You will “rehearse” your interview in front of a mirror, or you will enlist the help of a friend. You will carefully select what to say and how to say it; you will pick an outfit that you think best suits the expectations of the job and your personality. This isn’t all that different from what an actor does.\n\nTheatre allows us to immerse ourselves in a story as it happens live, right in front of our eyes, with real people going through it. It gives us the chance to put ourselves in those people’s—the characters’—shoes and almost feel what they feel. The proximity to the action and the shared space makes for an intense experience. Hence, theatre encourages us to develop empathy and to care for other people.\n\nTheatre fosters a sense of community, as well. The audience and performers are all together in the same time and space, witnessing the action and going through a common emotional reaction. While it can be argued that movies achieve the same objective for audiences, movies don’t reach the same level of engagement that a good theatrical performance obtains from its audience because the action is more removed from the viewers and only allows a more conscious and superficial connection. A recent study has proved that students who see a production of a play are able to better understand the story and the plot, significantly improve their vocabulary, and develop greater empathy and tolerance as they understand and value the characters. Theatre teaches us how to behave in social situations by providing examples and the opportunity to use them.\n\nBy demanding an immediate reaction, theatre forces us to have opinions and exercise our critical thinking, which is one of the reasons why theatre is part of the Liberal Arts—from the Latin Ars Liberalis —and is present in most colleges and universities in their General Education curriculum. Theatre represents life and human nature, encompassing a variety of subjects and issues through a wide perspective.\n\nWhat is Theatre?\n\nWhat do we need in order to have theatre? For something to be considered theatre, you need to have an actor telling a story and an audience, even if it is just one person, listening to it. That is the bare minimum.\n\nThe story itself is crucial, but it doesn’t have to be scripted. In fact, several theatrical traditions that survive to this day rely on improvisation. Over the centuries, scripts have been developed and playwrights have become famous; scripts are definitely instrumental to theatrical productions, but strictly speaking, they are not necessary.\n\nA dedicated theatrical space isn’t necessary either. Of course, it helps to be in a building that has been conceived for theatre productions, but theatre can happen everywhere, as long as there is a space for the actor and for the audience.\n\nArt or Craft?\n\nIs theatre an art? Or is it a craft?\n\nTheatre is a form of art because it is conceived artistically: the actor interprets the material and presents it to the audience following a particular artistic vision that is unique to that actor and to that performance only. This is what makes theatre a unique form of art. While the same script can be performed and produced over and over again, every single performance will be different because everything happens live and is tied to a specific concept.\n\nShakespeare wrote Romeo and Juliet in 1597. Since then, there have been millions of productions of it, if not more. The story is always the same: two young lovers fight to be together despite all obstacles, and tragically they don’t succeed. What changes for every production are the actors’ interpretations of the roles, the overall vision for the show (which usually comes from the director and the creative team), and the reaction of the audience.\n\nIt is important to understand that the actors perform their roles consistently in terms of interpretation and stage positions for any given production, but they are human too! What they receive back from the audience really does impact their performance. This goes back to what was mentioned before: the audience and the actors are going through the experience together, and although they have different roles, they influence each other significantly.\n\nThe uniqueness of theatre also relies on the once-in-a-lifetime experience that it provides. The audience experiences a theatre production on a specific day, and that will be it. Even if they attend it several times in a row, they will never see the exact same show; the structure will be the same, but there will be variations in the staging or in the single performances of the actors. The emotional response of the audience will be immediate and tied to that specific experience too. A painting, a sculpture, or a movie, even, stays the same. Time does not alter it. What changes is our emotional response to it, according to our personal emotional and life journey. Van Gogh’s Starry Night doesn’t change. What we see in it and our reaction to it changes in time.\n\nAside from its artistic nature, theatre requires technique. Talent alone won’t help the actor if he is not able to project his voice and be heard. Sets need to be built as well as costumes. As a result, there is a craft side to theatre too! Certain theatrical mediums require specific abilities, and those abilities need to be developed and trained: actors study voice, diction, and movement; scenic designers learn perspective, painting techniques, materials, and color schemes; and costume designers learn costume construction, fabrics, and color palettes.\n\nMost famous actors you see in blockbuster movies have dedicated their entire lives to their art and perfected their craft through years of training! Meryl Streep is a graduate of the Yale School of Drama, Bradley Cooper graduated from the Actor’s Studio and so did Al Pacino… just to name a few. Even improvisational theatre has a structure and rules, so it requires training in specific abilities.\n\nWhen you see a theatrical production, you experience the culmination of a complex and long process—you see the proverbial tip of the iceberg. On the one hand, that is exactly what you should see. Yet, you shouldn’t assume it is all that there is. Costumes and sets don’t just magically appear on opening night and actors don’t just naturally and effortlessly speak all of those lines in that specific order and in that specific way on the day you are in the audience.\n\nA Bit of History\n\nSince the Greeks, theatre has been perceived to be educational while also providing a form of entertainment. Two of the most influential classic Greek philosophers had very strong—and opposing—ideas about the role of theatre in the education of the people and in society: they are Plato (428-348 B.C) and Aristotle (384-333 B.C). Let’s see the differences between the two schools of thought.\n\nAccording to Plato, the world we live in is a mere representation, a copy, or mimesis, of the perfect world, which is the world of ideas. What corrupts our world and makes it imperfect is the fact that it is made of substance, which decays. We ourselves suffer the same flaw. The idea of a human being is perfect, while the incarnation of it is not. Our flesh and bones weigh us down; they make us age, suffer, become sick and eventually die. The truth, the beauty, lies in the idea, in the concept, and if we want to get closer to it we need to see beyond materialism.\n\nPlato said theatre presents the audience with a representation of reality, so if reality itself is a representation of the essence (of the truth), theatre becomes the representation of a representation. The copy of a copy. This is why Plato thought theatre corrupted the people rather than providing an educational instrument.\n\nPlato’s disciple had the opposite approach. Aristotle thought theatre was very important in shaping the minds and character of the people. He said theatre allowed people to see the representation of an action followed by its consequences. Additionally, through a process called catharsis, the audience would emotionally empathize with the characters undergoing the action on stage to the point of identifying with them. With the resolution of the dramatic action, the audience would feel emotionally purged and gain a better understanding of what is right and what is wrong.\n\nAt the same time, Aristotle said that in order to be effective, theatre must also offer a component of spectacle and entertainment to keep the audience engaged and motivated. It is important to note that the only theatrical genre that Aristotle considered in his analysis was the tragedy. He didn’t approve of comedy as he didn’t believe it had an educational value.\n\nTheatre Today\n\nToday it is safe to say that theatre both educates and entertains. Some plays are heavier on meaning, others on the spectacle, but it is very unusual to walk out of a theatre performance without feeling somehow different from when you walked in.\n\nInterestingly, theatre and psychology frequently cross over. Theatre investigates the psyche of human nature to represent it, while psychology investigates it to understand its dynamics and possibly correct unhealthy behaviors. Therapists can use theatrical exercises to unlock behaviors or to expose the core of an issue through Drama Therapy. By allowing the participants to shift their focus from themselves to a character or situation, they create an alter ego upon which they can transfer their experiences. It becomes a form of externalization, where the participants are able to distance themselves from the issue, see it for what it is, and go from there. Clearly, Drama Therapy requires very thorough and specific training and sees theatre professionals and therapists working and training together, making it far from any acting class you can take.\n\nHow does theatre work? How does it create meaning and connect with people?\n\nTo start off, as the audience approaches the performance, they are aware that they will witness something that is being created live in front of their eyes and that will present them with circumstances and characters that are fictional. Yet, as the show begins, the audience is willing to suspend their disbelief, or believe in the truthfulness of what they witness for the duration of the performance. This is a convention that is established between the actors and the audience. If the performance is good, the convention will never be broken.\n\nIn addition, theatre relies on metaphors and allegories to elevate a subjective, specific situation to its universal abstraction. Both metaphors and allegories are ways to endow narratives with deeper meaning, usually relating ethics, politics or social issues. While a metaphor is mostly related to language and associates words that usually don’t go together (“All the world’s a stage”… from Shakespeare’s As You Like It) , allegories rely on a tale, a fable or a story that reads straight forward and simple on the surface, but that hides a deeper meaning. A good example of a play in the form of an allegory is Arthur Miller’s The Crucible. On the surface, the play tells the story of the witch hunt that took place in 1692 in Salem (MA). In reality, the play is Miller’s commentary on McCarthysm, which is known as the political repression and, at times, persecution of individuals who were suspected of communist ideals during the 1940s and 1950s. Similarly, Shakespeare’s main characters in Romeo and Juliet become the symbol of ill-fated love and represent young lovers of all times.\n\nIn some cases, the meaning can be tied to a specific period in history, and as time passes its lesson might become less poignant or apparent. This is the case for some of Shakespeare’s plays, as he was often commenting on the society of his time, which modern audiences might not necessarily know much about. This kind of social commentary is even more evident in plays that respond to the experiences of a certain time period, such as those by playwrights like Ionesco, Genet, and Beckett who wrote about the shock and psychological void left behind by the horrors of the second world war."
