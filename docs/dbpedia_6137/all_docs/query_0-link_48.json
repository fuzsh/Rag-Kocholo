Mike has cerebral palsy, John doesnâ€™t, and this podcast is a recording of one of those conversations. Their discussions deal frankly with all kinds of adult subjects - bodily functions, sexuality, depression, physical pain, and other hilarious subjects. And they also talk movies because they both really love movies. Listener discretion is advised."
