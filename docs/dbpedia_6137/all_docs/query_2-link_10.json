        "text": "Image\n\nMeet Vinsen Faris, our Chief Executive Officer |email | LinkedIn\n\nFor Vinsen, making a difference is as simple as that. A giver at heart, Vinsen deeply believes in giving back. Every day at Meals on Wheels, Vinsen knows that they are helping to make a positive difference in people’s lives. With a degree from the University of Texas at Arlington and a rich experience in the food service and hospitality field, he learned the importance of customer service and satisfaction and has been prepped for a lifelong journey in the 'people' business.\n\nIn his free time, Vinsen loves to read or simply be outdoors. His family has a place in Llano County where they can stomp through the woods, walk in the pasture, or read a book on the back porch. There’s no better R&R. And when it comes to favorite Meals on Wheels dishes, the cornbread chili bowl is Vinsen's absolute favorite. From the slightly spicy chili to the slight sweetness of the cornbread, it doesn’t get any better!\n\nIf you could have dinner with any historical figure and share your favorite meal together, who would it be and what would you eat?\n\nTR with some BBQ, including brisket, pork sausage, chicken, and cabrito. Maybe eat on the ground near the campfire!\n\nImage\n\nMeet Forrest Myane, our Chief Strategy and Development Officer | email | LinkedIn\n\nForrest grew up with a mom who ran a nonprofit, so she didn't know there were other career options! She loves working at Meals on Wheels because, no matter what happens in the day, they fed thousands of seniors who may not have another option for food, and that is always rewarding. Forrest's degree in Radio, Television, and Film comes in handy as she figures out the best ways to communicate with community partners.\n\nForrest has had the privilege of working at several incredible San Antonio organizations, including Christian Assistance Ministries, Autism Community Network, and the Witte Museum. In her free time, she loves to cook, bake, and read. When she's not chasing her toddler around, she enjoys tackling projects around the house and sewing clothes for herself and her daughter.\n\nForrest's favorite Meals on Wheels dish is the chili and cornbread bowl (Spoiler Alert: you’ll be seeing this meal pop up as you read more!)\n\nIf you could have a baking competition with any celebrity chef, who would it be and what dish would you challenge them with?\n\nAfter discussing strategy and the logistics behind choosing a great baker or a beginner, Forrest decided to challenge Claire Saffitz, primarily as “an opportunity to learn and improve on her skills”. The pastry she would want to do is laminated dough (a.k.a. a croissant).\n\nImage\n\nMeet Kate Phipps, our Chief Services Officer | email | LinkedIn\n\nKate enjoys working at Meals on Wheels San Antonio because it allows her to pursue a mission that directly and positively impacts her community, a cause she is deeply passionate about. She takes great pride in advocating for both our clients and our dedicated staff.\n\nWith a Bachelor's degree in Business Administration from UTSA and a Master's degree in Long-Term Care from Texas State University, she is also a Licensed Nursing Facility Administrator and Certified Dementia Practitioner.\n\nIn her free time, she loves to travel, cook, spend time with family, and take walks with her dogs.\n\nAs for her favorite Meals on Wheels dish, there's nothing quite like a comforting meal of chicken fried steak with mashed potatoes and peas, a dish that always brings back warm memories of her mom's cooking.\n\nIf you could teleport to any restaurant in the world right now for dinner, which restaurant would you choose and what would you order?\n\nI can’t pick just one!... so here are three: The Seasonal Menu at Vetri Cucina in Philadelphia, The Stick Bread from Red Bicycle Breadworks in Park City. and The Homemade Biscuits and Sausage Gravy made by my Mom in her house.\n\nImage\n\nMeet Jacqueline Munoz, our Director of Human Resources | email | LinkedIn\n\nJacqueline first began her non-profit journey in 2012 and loves the meaningfulness of giving back and loves working for Meals on Wheels San Antonio as she loves to assist the community, seniors, and other individuals in need. After all, Meals on Wheels is mission-driven, and Jackie is proud to be part of an organization that shares the same passion! With a BA in Human Resource Management from Concordia University Texas, Jackie has dedicated 15 years to the field of Human Resources.\n\nIn her free time, Jackie enjoys reading and spending time with her family. She particularly cherishes stay-cations, savoring every moment with her grandbabies. While Jackie's long-time favorite meal was always the chili and cornbread, lately, the chicken fried steak has been edging out the chili for the top spot!\n\nWould you rather have a retirement fund that paid out in gourmet meals or one that provided an endless supply of your favorite dessert?\n\nI would say gourmet meals because they are different and unexpected every time/experience, in contrast to my favorite dessert (ice cream). I love ice cream, but an endless supply can hurt with no self-control at times!\n\nImage\n\nMeet Ruben Vasquez, our Director of Facilities & Property Management | email\n\nMeals on Wheels is the first non-profit organization Ruben has had the pleasure of working for, and he is moved by its impact. Coming from a background in museums, family attractions, and art spaces, he finds the non-profit world profoundly different. At Meals on Wheels, the joy of giving back to the community and supporting those who built the world before us is incredibly fulfilling.\n\nHe studied art design and audio production at San Antonio College and has completed the Certified Attractions Manager Program. He further honed his skills at Centro San Antonio, delivering cleaning and hospitality services for the Public Improvement District (PID) in Downtown San Antonio.\n\nRuben indulges in art, music, and technology. His favorite medium is charcoal and finds portraits rewarding and relaxing. He enjoys hands-on projects, often taking things apart and reassembling them to improve functionality. Above all else, he loves doing all these things with his family.\n\nRuben enjoys many of the meals we serve, but if he had to choose one, it would be the fried chicken. It's crispy and savory, making it an absolute delight!\n\nIf you could have a magical refrigerator that always stocked your favorite food, what would you want it to be filled with?\n\nIn this scenario, I would fill my fridge up with tres leches. It's the best cake ever created!\n\nImage\n\nMeet Jose Lerma, our Director of Special Initiatives | email | LinkedIn\n\nJose absolutely loves working at Meals on Wheels because of his personal philosophy: each delivery is an opportunity to learn something new from the incredible people we serve. Hearing their stories, understanding their contributions to our community, and seeing how they shaped San Antonio, and the surrounding area is always a delight.\n\nWith a Master’s in Administration with a Concentration in Communications, a Bachelor’s in Broadcast Meteorology, and a Minor in Communications, Jose feels well-equipped to connect with and support our clients. In his leisure time, he enjoys taking road trips to West Texas, watching movies, and indulging in both eating and cooking great food.\n\nHis favorite Meals on Wheels dish is a Mexican classic: Arroz con Pollo. But he did ask us to add in one additional detail: we also make fantastic Brussels sprouts!\n\nIf you could have a picnic at any iconic landmark in the world, where would it be and what foods would you pack to enjoy the view?\n\nI would love to eat authentic baba ghanoush and falafel while enjoying the view of the great Pyramids of Giza!\n\nImage\n\nMeet Ariana Barbour, our Director of Marketing & Communications | email | LinkedIn\n\nAriana works at Meals on Wheels because she believes that no one should go hungry, especially those who have made it possible for us to be where we are today. The people they serve built their city and should get to enjoy living there as long as possible. She also believes that everyone should make the world better than they found it—because it’s the right thing to do.\n\nAriana holds a Bachelor of Science in Public Relations from the University of Florida and a Master of Arts in Advertising from the University of Texas at Austin. With nearly 10 years of experience in nonprofit communications, she discovered her passion for using her skills in this capacity through volunteer work and made the jump from agency life to #nonprofitlife.\n\nOutside of the office, Ariana loves to spend time with her family and friends. They love exploring San Antonio, especially Southtown, whenever they get the chance. She also enjoys reading, watching TV, and listening to live music.\n\nAriana's favorite Meals on Wheels meal is picadillo with rice and beans. It’s delicious and satisfying, and she is always excited to see it on the menu.\n\nIf you could have a conversation with any fruit or vegetable, which one would you choose and what would you talk about?\n\nImage\n\nMeet Adriona Irby Knight, our Director of Individual Giving | email | LinkedIn\n\nAdriona's love for seniors is what brought her to Meals on Wheels San Antonio, and it's the very reason she feels incredibly fortunate to still be a part of this amazing organization. The profound sense of fulfillment and joy she experiences from supporting and caring for these individuals is beyond words. Being a vital part of a mission dedicated to ensuring the well-being and happiness of clients fills her with pride and a deep sense of purpose. Each day, Adriona is reminded of the importance of her work and the positive impact it has on the lives of those she serves, reinforcing her commitment and passion for her role at Meals on Wheels.\n\nBefore fundraising, Adriona worked in long-term care facilities with seniors for over 15 years. Since then, she has spent over 15 years in non-profit fundraising at Meals on Wheels San Antonio, managing our donor database and stewarding our generous supporters. In her downtime, she enjoys watching reality TV, playing Candy Crush, and caring for her plant babies. She also loves hanging out with her family by the water with a margarita in hand.\n\nAnd when it comes to her favorite Meals on Wheels dish, nothing beats a plate of cheese enchiladas!\n\nIf you could make one food item the size of a car, what would it be and why?\n\nPizza because it’s my favorite food… who wouldn’t?!\n\nImage\n\nMeet Stephanie McGowan, our Director of Community Engagement |email\n\nStephanie works at Meals on Wheels because she is passionate about helping the seniors in her community and loves contributing to the social interaction our clients look forward to receiving every day. Stephanie loves that each meal delivered is another wellness check, ensuring that people are safe and happy in their homes!\n\nShe graduated from Texas A&M University-San Antonio with a Bachelor of Science in Interdisciplinary Studies. After five enriching years at KLRN, Stephanie joined the Meals on Wheels team to help develop and grow the Comfy Casas and AniMeals services.\n\nIn her free time, she loves reading and is part of an exclusive, private (and top secret) book club that is invite-only and has just two special and honorary members—herself and her sister. She also enjoys watching movies, thrift stores, and indulging in arts and crafts. Her favorite Meals on Wheels dish is the delicious chili cornbread bowl!\n\nIf you could have any food item as your mode of transportation, what would it be and how fast would it go?\n\nThe Patty Wagon from the SpongeBob SquarePants Movie (2004), which is a hamburger on wheels. Ideally it would reach up to 65 mph on the highway and 30 mph in residential neighborhoods, so we can deliver efficiently while abiding by all traffic laws.\n\nImage\n\nMeet Allie Rodriguez, our Director of Client Services | email\n\nAllie holds a Bachelor of Science in Health from the University of Texas at San Antonio and has dedicated over a decade to serving the most vulnerable members of our community.

Growing up on a street where all her neighbors were elders, often women living alone, Christina learned a great deal from their strength and resilience.\n\nChristina holds a BA in Mass Communication/Public Relations with a minor in Women and Minority Studies from Texas State University. With over 22 years of experience in nonprofit work, she feels her calling is serving seniors and their caregivers.
