        "text": "I wasn't referring to the back pack in regards to the wheels/bed as that was more that in spite of the sacrifices they still managed to do something with the figure that was so simple in execution that makes us wonder why wasn't it thought of sooner.\n\nThe non-transforming Yolopark Megs doesn't scale with this, so now you're stuck with the upcoming SS86 figure that will inevitably have a sloppy alt mode. Why does a sloppy alt mode matter if you're willing to use a non-transforming figure anyway? Just don't transform SS86 Megatron and your problem is solved\n\nYou're right, and I agree with the spoiled consumer comment, but I still don't think this guy comes near justifying his price tag.\n\nI'm excitedly whelmed here and so far it really is a superior figure imo. It's just like missing $10 worth of something to hit it out of the park so guess saying it needed something for its back I get... That could be that little part to fully make it a complete victory imo.\n\nI guess they could have designed the thighs to be longer whilst slightly thinning up the calves thereby making him appear both taller and more lean that could have helped him look more nimble.\n\nIn any case, I really do like this figure. From the front he looks phenomenal. Only for the purposes of me using him with the Yolopark Megatron I'd want some modification. On his own, he looks fantastic. The alt mode's size is another appealing aesthetic.\n\nGo figure I wanted it for $20 less, although I paid the asking price so there's that."
