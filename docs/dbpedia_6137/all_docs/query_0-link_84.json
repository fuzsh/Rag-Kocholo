It was kind of like, they got a man to third base, but they just couldn’t get him home. There were lots of twists and turns in the river, but at the same time I wanted to tell the historical story, so it’s kind of like two films in one.”\n\nThe 90-minute film is a tremendous trip down memory lane by highlighting some of the greatest moments of the 36-year franchise in the city, combined with the heartbreak of Rick Monday’s devastating home run off Montreal pitcher Steve Rogers in 1981.\n\nBrought in as a reliever in the deciding game of National League Championship series, Rogers, the ace of the club’s starting staff, was tabbed by manager Jim Fanning to try to hold the Los Angeles Dodgers scoreless in the top of the ninth and that’s where the miracle run halted.\n\nIt’s referred to simply as Blue Monday by fans of the Expos because a whole country had its hearts broken when Monday launched the ball over the right-field wall. A trip to the World Series for the first time in franchise history was dashed.\n\nCromartie brought that team back to Montreal for a reunion in June 2012 and Hart spent time with them talking about their memories while they attended a dedication of a ballpark to the late Gary Carter in Ahuntsic.\n\nAdvertisement 4\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nThe defining moment for the franchise — and the beginning of the end — was the 1994 season, when the Expos were the best team in baseball, only to have the campaign cancelled by a strike. A group led by Claude Brochu decided to send players packing and, from there, Jeffrey Loria purchased the club as fans flocked away.\n\n“The next crack (for Montreal) will be expansion and that’s still three-to-four years away,” Hart said.\n\nThe most eye-opening part of the film is the effort billionaire Stephen Bronfman — whose father Charles brought the club to Montreal in 1969 — made to work with the Tampa Bay Rays and MLB commissioner Rob Manfred to try to have that franchise play half its season in Canada.\n\nBronfman spent countless hours with his partners working on the project and the conceptual designs of the stadium look incredible. It makes you wonder what could have been before the Rays announced they were only going to play in Tampa in 2022.\n\n“The Expos had a great love affair with the city of Montreal and to renew that love affair would be great,” Charles Bronfman said in the film. “The love affair broke, the team got broke and then Mr. Loria further broke it.”\n\nAdvertisement 5\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nYou can really feel that the Bronfman family is determined to right the wrong because the Expos never should have left in the first place. Those who want it back struggle with their emotions and Montreal rapper Annakin Slayd summed it up best.\n\nRecommended from Editorial\n\nBlue Jays’ Chris Bassitt offers grieving fan free tickets ‘as long as I’m here’\n\nBlue Jays president Mark Shapiro offers few answers to the many questions facing club\n\n“The nostalgia combined with the hope is a really interesting contradiction,” Slayd said. “You feel sad about the past, but then you see people like the Bronfmans and (Mayor Valerie Plante) talking about, ‘Maybe we’ve got a future here.’\n\n“Those endorsements make you feel so close, but at the same time, you think, ‘what if it doesn’t happen?’ It’s like you’re going to get that heartbreak all over again.”\n\nHart hit a home run with this film, but like Blue Monday, it stings and you can only hope there’s another chapter to this story.\n\nTO SEE THE FILM\n\nThe Ottawa Titans Field of Dreams Foundation and Adobe Productions International are hosting a screening of Nos Amours – The Saga of the Montreal Expos! Sunday, August 11th at the Canadian Museum of History. Doors open at 5 p.m. and the show begins at 6:30 p.m. Tickets are available at Ottawa Titans website.\n\nbgarrioch@postmedia.com\n\nArticle content\n\nShare this article in your social network\n\nLatest National Stories"
