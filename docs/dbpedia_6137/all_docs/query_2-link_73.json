        "text": "Am I the only one that finds him annoying? He may be a great guy but his you tube persona is so annoying. I feel dumber and feel like I have been talked down to all wrapped up in one when I try and watch his content. It is like watching a male version of ant Mable in the kitchen trying to save a burnt pie with those cutesy little sayings.\n\nI just don't understand what makes him so popular. Obviously he is doing something right. Maybe this is really an indictment of society. He definitely found a audience starving for this kind of content.\n\nWait. The new show is on motor trend. That explains things a bit. The quality of motortrend programming has been aimed lower and lower over the last couple years to the point that there really is nothing on motortrend that I care to watch any more. I just hope motortrend does not cause him to crash and burn down everything he has worked to build. I think motortrend needs him more than he needs them.\n\nI'm really surprised anyone finds him annoying, but different strokes, I suppose. He has developed a 'character' over time that is a lot like Red Green. I LOL frequently, and actually anticipate his terminology and folksy-ness. And, his subscriber numbers clearly show those of you who don't care for his schtick are in the minority. I'd be curious to hear what you would consider a 'good' car show, because most of them really suck.\n\nA large portion of his popularity is also because of his ethics, something rarely seen on TV or YouTube.\n\nHe's made it very clear that the MT show will not replace VGG. VGG is his main source of income and he really enjoys doing what he does.\n\nDerek Bieri and David Freiburger are probably the two biggest reasons I returned to working on car projects. I'd become dismayed with modern vehicles and always thought old stuff had to be restored to perfection to provide the fun I was seeking. Nope. I've totally embraced leaving paint as-is and focusing on making it fun to drive and reliable. The next guy can have the 'joy' of sanding for hours, painting and buffing paint only to worry about it getting a stone chip. I'm having the time of my life right now, and it's because of these guys plus Kevin at Junkyard Digs and Dylan McCool that have made cars fun again.\n\nIn reply to ddavidv :\n\nWhile I don't watch any of those shows, ( I prefer Calvin Nelson ) The whole movement away from flawless paint and to simplicity is where I'm at. That's why I'm here at GRM\n\nI Love the whole idea of the $2000 challenge even if I'm not doing it right now. I will be there following my retirement. In the meantime Jeff and Erick can take the Jaguar there and have fun with it if they want.\n\nI can see how the character is a little much to handle for some people, I have family in the UP so it's not too foreign to me. He mentioned in one of his recent videos that the Motortrend show was going to be almost exclusively revivals and the hardest part about him doing revivals on his own is the filming and production value. I'm hoping it's more like early Roadkill and he has creative control over the show. I was about to let my Motortrend subscription lapse until I heard about this and Alex Taylor on HRG.\n\nI actually love a guy. His schtick is approachable. I think he's funny. Someone mentioned Red Green. Exactly.\n\nI too have gotten back to looking forward to working on my vehicles because of him and Freiberger. I understand that with time and patience and a little work I can get my vehicles running and do so reliably.\n\nAnd Alex Taylor is a breath of fresh air.\n\nI was really disappointed to see Alex Taylor and Derek sign deals with Motortrend, because getting involved with Motortrend seems to have gone poorly for most people that have attempted it and I like these people. Alex seems to have already been bitten by \"Motortrend wanted my car at an event but it went to E36 M3 because I didn't have time to prepare it properly due to their nonsense scheduling\"."
