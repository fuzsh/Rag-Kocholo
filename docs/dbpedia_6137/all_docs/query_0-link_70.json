        "text": "I don’t rightly know what to call this set, but since it celebrates the 6 movies and 2 TV shows that existed at the time, “Film and TV” seems appropriate enough, right?\n\nI actually think this was a pretty cool concept to base a series of cars on. How do you begin to convey the themes and characters and surprises of a film to the design of car? ..I dunno, and I’m not even sure if these cars 100% succeeded in that regard, but I still like ’em. First we’ll take a quick look at what’s what:\n\n1 / 8 – The Phantom Menace – Gearonimo\n\n2 / 8 – Attack of the Clones – Nitro Scorcher\n\n3 / 8 – Revenge of the Sith – Duel Fueler\n\n4 / 8 – A New Hope – Motoblade\n\n5 / 8 – The Empire Strikes Back – Spectyte\n\n6 / 8 – Return of the Jedi – Ballistik\n\n7 / 8 – The Clone Wars – Brutalistic\n\n8 / 8 – Rebels – Jet Threat 3.0\n\nThis really is a tough lot to analyze when it comes to tying in car design to concept, so my notes on these will probably be a bit vague and abstract.\n\nThe Gearonimo reminds me somewhat of the Jedi Starfighters used in the Prequel Trilogy…otherwise it’s got a fairly clean yet technical feel to it, perhaps a nod to the galaxy’s use of droid rather than living people to fight. Maybe…?\n\nThe Nitro Scorcher is so small and slender that the only dots I can really connect are with the lanky Kaminoan….see” I told you this won’t easy!\n\nThe Duel Fueler is no doubt an awesome looking, possibly spacey-futuristic car. But where does it fit in with the fall of the Republic and the ascendancy of Emperor Palpatine and the death of the Jedi? I don’t know. I was going to talk about “dual” and the “duality” behind Anakin and Vader…and then I realized the world was “duEl, not “duAl.” So meh.\n\nNow this is interesting. Sorta. Tell me how – arguably – the tamest and most formulaic film of the saga gets one of the fucking craziest HW Originals there ever was: the Motoblade! That aberrant slice of metal near the cockpit really has an impact…makes it appear all jagged and asymmetrical. It looks like something that ought to be in a near-future demolition derby. It actually reminds me of that character Roadkill from the first Twisted Metal video game. I know they don’t really look alike but that exact thought entered my head when I first saw the Motoblade and it’s stuck ever since. What does any of this have to do with A New Hope? Nada.\n\nSpectyte, a pretty common sight in the world of Hot Wheels, looks a lot like the Enforcer from the Factions series. It reminds me of a Rebel Alliance-era X-wing more than anything, and I think the basic yet appealing design would’ve been well-suited to A New Hope. If there’s one thing to be said about Empire Strikes Back it’s that it’s a film about failure (not dissimilar to The Last Jedi) and not about how or why our heroes fail, but how they react to, confront, and deal with that failure. I guess what I’m getting at is that I’d expect something a little darker and foreboding.\n\nCommemorating Return of the Jedi we actually have something that looks a little Star Wars-y! It’s the HW Originals Ballistik, but the magic is in the paint job. We’ve got like a TIE Fighter cockpit window thing on the top, symbols of the Empire on the sides, and a gray and black color scheme that suited the Empire particularly well in the days of the Original Trilogy. This could almost be a Carship, and it’s perfectly at home with it’s Death Star / TIE Fighter vibe.\n\nBrutalistic is one hell of a cool looking car. It’s got a mild insectoid thing going on but it also feels very much like a hyper-advanced car, maybe even piece of mobile weaponry. I have a really hard time connecting it to The Clone Wars, mainly because I’ve never even watched an episode of The Clone Wars. I know that Anakin and Obi-Wan jaunt around the galaxy and Count Dooku is pretty much the Big Bad and Darth Maul lives and Ahsoka is Anakin’s padawan but any and all particulars are lost on me. Love that car though.\n\nI know even less about Rebels except that I do know who several of the characters are based on the Character Cars. I guess that the Jet Threat 3.0 is fitting considering that the show revolves around the Ghost spaceship and its crew. Maybe one day I’ll get around to watching this stuff, I just can’t get past this type of animation!\n\nWell that was hard. All in all a fun set of car though, definitely something worth getting creative over. Now that 4 movies have been added to the lore with 2 more on the way, I wonder if this is something they’ll revisit or even continue? Well, until next time…"
