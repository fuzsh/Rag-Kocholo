        "text": "You cannot help but fall in love with the Schneeberger family from the film The Nine Wheels. Toni (dad), Laetitia (mom), fighting a neurodegenerative disease, and their two sons (mountain biking prodigies) Raoul and Emric. The family still lives in their giant van, staying near Barcelona, Spain in the winter, and travelling through Europe from mid-February until the fall to attend bike competitions and festivals.\n\n15-year-old Raoul and his brother Emric (12) are still passionate about biking but don't prefer any particular discipline (dirt, BMX, or downhill). Emric climbed to the podium three times this season in Austria: in the European Cup of Downhill (category: under 13 years old); in Pumptrack and Downhill Crankworx, Innsbruck. Raoul placed on the podium at the Swiss Championship of Downhill (category under 17 years old pro) and two podiums in Innsbruck, Austria – Crankworx dual slalom and Pumptrack.\n\nSince the film, the family has had many opportunities to share their message with media in France and Switzerland – to encourage everyone to stick together in the face of adversity and choose activity over a sedentary lifestyle. The family attended a Banff World Tour screening in Sallanches, France, on March 16th, participating in a Q&A after the film.\n\nLaetitia is still fighting her illness, and inspiring love and courage to her entire family.\n\nAuthor: Cécile Neff (World Tour Host - France)"
