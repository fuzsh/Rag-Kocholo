        "text": "Lovecore, which shares the visuals and ethos of Valentine's Day, is based on the visual culture of manufactured romance. The forms of love that the aesthetic specifically focuses on are affectionate, dopamine-filled, and \"gushy.\" It can involve both requited and unrequited relationships, with both crushing on someone from afar and the rituals of dating being shown in these images. Relationships could be both new and juvenile or old and familiar. The more mature and philosophical or seductive and erotic aspects of love are not featured, as visually, these often do not match the visuals and younger audience of Lovecore.\n\nHowever, people who enjoy the aesthetic are not necessarily actively crushing on anyone or in a relationship depicted in the aesthetic. The aesthetic largely speaks about crushes and relationships in the theoretical, with there not being a true person that the original poster is thinking about. People who enjoy romance fiction, queer people who celebrate love, and people who wish for romantic experiences are some examples of people who appreciate the aesthetic.\n\nVisually, Lovecore tends to focus on the commercialization of love through Valentine's Day decorative trends. The rituals associated with romance are also heavily featured, especially in text. The aesthetic has substyles that can emphasize vintage, anime or Cottagecore visuals.\n\nLovecore originated on Tumblr but later spread to many other platforms such as TikTok and Pinterest.\n\nVisuals[]\n\nPopular motifs include hearts, boxes of chocolate, lipstick, love letters, cupid, angels, and the colours red and pink. There are also at times vintage elements present in the form of scans of Valentine's Day cards written in the 1950s and 60s. There is sometimes overlap with anime in the form of pink manga edits and images of anime characters with hearts in their eyes.\n\nAnime characters who are blushing or have hearts around them\n\nAnything shaped like a heart and in the lovecore colors\n\nBouquets of flowers\n\nCakes with pink frosting and cherries\n\nCandy such as lollipops or chocolates that are heart-shaped and pink or red\n\nCupid imagery such as angel wings and arrows\n\nCute animals such as kittens or dogs\n\nLipstick\n\nPaper Valentine's Day cards\n\nStuffed animals\n\nTypography expressing quotes about love\n\n\"Tunnel of Love\" amusement park rides\n\nPinterest Boards[]\n\n–lovecore by °❀𝔸𝕝𝕝𝕪𝔹𝕖𝕝𝕝𝕖❀°\n\naesthetics: lovecore 101 by Moonflower\n\nLOVECORE by space cowboy\n\nlovecore ✧ by faeriesope\n\nRetro Lovecore by Alexandra Tinsley\n\nlovecore by francesca <3\n\naes ; lovecore by sophie\n\n<3 by mercury\n\nFashion[]\n\nLovecore fashion is a mix of lingerie, angel wings, satin dresses, and just general formal date wear, though sometimes people who identify with the aesthetic adopt a softie look or opt for graphic t-shirts with the aforementioned themes. Larme-styled outfits are also popular. Colors like pink, red, and white, as well as motifs such as hearts and lipstick marks, are also fairly common. Some garments include:\n\nCrop tops with puffed sleeves, shirring, and other feminine details\n\nHeart-patterned garments and accessories\n\nSlip dresses with satin and lace\n\nTurtlenecks with a tighter fit\n\nPink lingerie\n\nAngel wings or wing imagery on clothing\n\nActivities[]\n\nWriting/decorating love letters\n\nBaking\n\nThinking about your crush/partner\n\nKissing\n\nHolding hands\n\nCuddling\n\nGoing on dates\n\nMaking paper hearts\n\nSubgenres[]\n\nPagano-Lovecore[]\n\nPagano-Lovecore focuses on the iconography of love in Greco-Roman mythology and the Italian Renaissance, rather than the popular culture and commercialized love. Fixated on Greco-Roman gods and goddesses, beautiful statues, doves, old jewelry, ancient love poetry, and other antique things in Rome or ancient Greece. Figures include Aphrodite, Eros, Adonis, and other love deities. Easy overlap with Dark Academia. More deities and visuals can be found at Hellenic.\n\nVisual Boards[]\n\nPagano Lovecore Academia by Ashleigh Judson\n\npagano lovecore aesthetic by Meg\n\nMusic[]\n\nPlaylists[]\n\n♡ (lovecore) by miraya ☁️\n\nlovecore Spotify playlist by constellacoding\n\nLovecore Spotify playlist by kylerclodfelter\n\nLovecore Spotify playlist by Nicole\n\nLovecore 💋 Spotify playlist by lotspot-nl\n\nlovecore💘 Spotify playlist by sparklinggoth\n\nlovecore Spotify playlist by Allan\n\n💖❣️💕 LOVECORE 💕❣️💖 Spotify playlist by archieonthetree\n\namorcito Spotify playlist by grape<3\n\n[1] +. ⋆♡..⋆..♡⋆.+ Spotify playlist by ewitzrobyn\n\nLovecore Mix (Spotify \"Niche Mix\"; personalized to users' individual tastes)\n\nSongs[]\n\nLovers Rock by TV Girl\n\nLove Drought by Beyoncé\n\nLIGHT SHOWER/Training Wheels/Highschool Sweethearts by Melanie Martinez\n\nI Do Adore by Mindy Gledhill\n\nI Wanna Be Your Boyfriend by Hot Freaks\n\nStrawberry Mentos by Leanna Firestone\n\nDark Red by Steve Lacy\n\nHeart Attack by Chuu of Loona\n\nlove4eva by Loona/yyxy ft.
