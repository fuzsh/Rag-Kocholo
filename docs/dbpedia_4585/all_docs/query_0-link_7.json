        "text": "Sir CHARLES HIBBERT TUPPER.\n\nThe argument that sent that gentleman here was I think not to the credit of the government, but it was one that prevailed, namely, that this crying injustice to the province might be remedied by sending a gentleman here in accord with the government of the day, and by that means they might obtain justice where justice would be denied to a free and independent member of the House who was not giving them a slavish support. That was the argument. It was not that the government had treated Victoria handsomely in the past; on the contrary, the gentleman who won the election said that practically all that had been given to that constituency was the result of his private conferences with the ministers of the day, though he had not been clothed with authority as a representative. Of course the argument was pressed home that if he were a representative he would obtain a great deal more at the hands of this government than could a free and independent member of the House, and particularly more than a man who did not see eye to eye with them on all public questions. I do not think that any member from the province of British Columbia, judging from what I have heard there, will rise in his place and say that that province is being treated at all fairly or at all generously by the government of the day, in connection with the vast expenditures that are being made in other parts of Canada. They do not complain of these expenditures, but I think the complaint is universal that there has been and there is a shameful neglect of the very pressing interests of the province.\n\nThe MINISTER OF PUBLIC WORKS My last argument then is to ask my hon. friend to be kind enough to wait until next year.\n\nNelson public building, $25,006.\n\nSir CHARLES HIBBERT TUPPER.\n\nI happen to have a lively recollection of the manner in which that question was dealt with. I do not think the gentleman who was successful in the late election in Victoria would altogether endorse the position the Minister of Public Works takes. It is true that the opponents of the government complained against the niggardly treatment the province received at the hands of this government, considering the circumstances, and considering the amount of public money at then disposal. It is true also that the victorious candidate resorted to this method ot reasoning : What can you expect if you send to parliament a gentleman who is opposed to the ministers who dole out the public funds ?-that is to say, according to .the principles enunciated the other flayT\n\nr The MINISTER OF PUBLIC WORKS. They have not read my speech.\n\nSir CHARLES HIBBERT TUPPER.\n\nThe hon. gentleman must know very well from official communications from the government of that province that they complain that this government is not doing well by British Columbia. This government is receiving enormous contributions from that province, out of all proportion to the expenditure made in it, and out of all proportion to the relative expenditure and receipts in the other provinces. That is a standing grievance in the province of British Columbia to-day, as represented by formal memorial from the local government. But it was not from that point of view that I rose to speak ; it was from a knowledge I had that one of the most enterprising portions of the province was not being well treated in the matter of public institutions. I think there is reason for great complaint. Several times the hon. gentleman has referred to the large expenditures being made, I think, in connection with the drill shed ; but I do not suppose it was ever pretended that the concession of that public building to the community of Burrard, or Vancouver, was meant to delay the accommodation they had long expressed a desire to have for a custom-house and post office.\n\nSir CHARLES . HIBBERT TUPPER.\n\nIt struck me that if we could look so far into the future-and I have nothing to say against it-as to acquire an enormous tract of land that we did not immediately need, a community which gives so much into the general revenue would have a right to expect immediate action with regard to the demands which have been so long standing.\n\nI believe that this want of better accommodation in Vancouver began to be felt in the days of the old government when our revenues were not as buoyant as they are to-dav The need to-day is all the greater aud the ground for dissatisfaction increased by the growth of the business of the city. Seeing that moneys are being voted to provide post office accommodation for communities that at present, whatever may be the hope of the future, are not paying so much into the exchequer as Vancouver is, the matter might well be brought to the attention of the minister."
