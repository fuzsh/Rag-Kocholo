Born July 2, 1821 in Nova Scotia, Tupper studied medicine at the University of Edinburgh in Scotland before returning to his home province to practice medicine. However, his passion for politics soon led him to a promising political career.

He was one of Canada’s Conservative leaders and held several important ministerial positions before becoming Prime Minister in 1896, for a shortened term of only 68 days.

He played a key role in the consolidation of the country and contributed to the development of economic and social policies that shaped modern Canada. Charles Tupper died on October 30, 1915, leaving behind a political legacy and a place in history as a committed and visionary leader.\n\nCharles Tupper, born July 2, 1821 in Amherst, Nova Scotia, is a major Canadian political figure. He comes from a family of Scottish origin who settled in Canada in the 18th century. His father, Charles Tupper Sr., was a doctor and a staunch Loyalist who supported the British Crown. His mother, Miriam Lockhart, came from an influential Protestant family in the area. Charles Tupper was the second child of six. His brother, William Johnston Tupper, also became a renowned Canadian politician. The Tupper family was very involved in local political life, which greatly influenced Charles in his professional career. Charles Tupper’s marriage to Frances Amelia Morse, daughter of a prosperous merchant, strengthened his connections and his social ascension. Together they had five children: Charles Hibbert Tupper, Thomas Prince Tupper, John Patterson Tupper, Frances Morse Tupper and George Jarvis Tupper. On the political scene, Charles Tupper held several important positions, including Premier of Nova Scotia from 1864 to 1867 and a member of the Canadian Parliament.

His political legacy was marked by his decisive role in the creation of the Canadian Confederation and his promotion of the system of universality of railways.
