He declared that he felt exceedingly well and that he looked forward with pleasure to the long rail journey over the line he was so instrumental in building.\n\nSeveral weeks will be spent by the aged statesman in Winnipeg as the guest of his son, Mr. W.J.

She will be profoundly missed by her daughters Susan McCormack (John), Sandra Couldwell (Joey), and son William (Marie). She is the beloved “Nan” to John (Hannah), Brendan (Anousha), Liam, Andras, Sandrine, Mitchell and Genevieve, and “Grand-Nan” to Aidan and Ronan. Janet was born on February 28, 1929 in Prince Rupert, BC to James MacDonald Tupper and Mary Agnes Tupper (nee Collins). She was predeceased by her brother Charles Hibbert Tupper in 2008. She spent her early years in Ottawa where her father was stationed as the head of the RCMP’s Musical Ride. This was the beginning of her lifelong love of horses. Her family moved to the Kerrisdale area of Vancouver when Janet was 11. After graduating from Magee High School she went into nursing at VGH and joined the Victorian Order of Nurses, a career that defined and honoured her compassionate and nurturing nature. Perhaps her greatest blessing during that time was meeting her husband Bill when he was a young intern at VGH. They married in 1951 and were together until Bill’s death in April 2012. After her three children were born, (all within three years) Janet lovingly devoted herself to her family full-time. In the coming years, she perpetuated her maternal devotion on to her grandchildren. Janet and Bill loved the Cariboo, and built a cabin on Green Lake where they were grateful to be able to spend over 50 years of summers, Thanksgivings and the occasional winter, with family and friends. A consummate homemaker and hostess, Janet prepared memorable meals and enjoyed many “happy hours” at sunset on the deck. When Bill pursued flying, Janet followed suit and obtained her pilot’s license. For several years they enjoyed vacations in their Cessna to Mexico and throughout BC. After Bill retired, they were able to spend more of the winter months at their condo in Maui. “Jan” was a lovely, sweet person and a true lady in every way. The great-granddaughter of Sir Charles Tupper, she was gracious and kind to everyone, and elegant always. She retained friendships from her high school days and nursing years and those she made throughout her marriage to Bill. She felt particularly blessed to form the new friendships she did when she moved to Tapestry at UBC in 2013. In the past few years Janet endured several painful illnesses. She faced and fought them with tremendous courage, strength and serenity. The family would like to thank the Drs. and nursing staff at VGH and UBC Hospitals who cared for Janet during her many hospital stays, and the devoted home care she received in her final months from Marlo and Fely. By request, there will be a Family Service followed by a private Celebration of Life at a later date. In lieu of flowers, donations in Janet’s name would be appreciated by the VGH School of Nursing Alumnae Association 855 West 12th Avenue, Vancouver, BC V5Z 1M9. She leaves behind a legacy of love and beautiful memories.”\n\nCouldwell, William, death notice, Vancouver Sun and/or The Province from Apr. 19 to Apr. 21, 2012: “Dr. William John Couldwell passed away peacefully April 8, 2012. He will be profoundly missed by his wife of 61 years Janet (nee Tupper), daughters Susan McCormack (John), Sandra Couldwell (Joey) and son William T. Couldwell (Marie); Grandchildren John (Hannah), Brendan (Anousha), Liam, Andras, Sandrine, Mitchell and Genevieve. He is pre-deceased by his parents Nada and William, and sister Joan. Bill was born in Telkwa BC on December 30, 1924 and grew up in Quesnel. Upon graduating from high school, he attended UBC prior to completing his medical degree at McGill University. He went on to specialize in Ophthalmology and practiced in New Westminster. Bill pursued his lifelong love of fishing and boating off the BC coast and on many lakes throughout the Interior. When he could no longer pilot his own airplane, he enjoyed building and flying model planes. On Remembrance Day, he looked forward to attending The Vancouver Air Force Association Dawn Patrol, and was an active member of The Quarter Century Flying Club until last Fall. During his retirement years, he and Jan escaped the winter months to enjoy their place and friends on Maui. To date, three generations of family and friends have been blessed with many happy memories of summers and Thanksgivings at the cabin he built at Green Lake, in his beloved Cariboo, where he said he always felt best. Bill was a good and wonderful man, generous with his knowledge, who helped, inspired and influenced many lives. He will be forever missed but joyfully remembered. His family wish to give special thanks to Dr. Tom Perry and the Drs. and nursing staff at VGH and UBC hospitals that cared for Bill during his final weeks. A celebratory reception will be held in Bill’s honor and memory on April 28th at 3:00 pm at the Point Grey Golf and Country Club where he was a member for almost 50 years.
