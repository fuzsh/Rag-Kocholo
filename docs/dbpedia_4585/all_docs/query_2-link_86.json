He was a volunteer for the Emotional Heart Support Group, Past President and founder of the Seniors’ Exercise Group, Time Stoppers, and a member of the CNR Retirees Association. Dad was known for his quick wit and sense of humour, his style and story-telling abilities. Dad loved his family of 5 girls and their spouses, grandchildren and their spouses, and great grandchildren, the Toronto Maple Leafs, his hartt shoes, music (in particular, Springhill musician Anne Murray), and Cape Breton. He attended High School in Judique, and from that time on, Judique always held a special place in his heart. We would like to thank the staff on Elm House wing, Loch Lomond Villa, and St. Joseph’s transitional care unit,for their hard work, kindness and dedication to ensure our father was properly taken care of. Special mention to Paula McDonough and Rick Benson who brightened his nursing home and hospital days with music, humour, support and friendship.\n\nArrangements are under the direction of the Fundy Funeral Home, 230 Westmorland Rd.
