Carmelo Anthony has slammed the Denver Nuggets for giving his previously worn No. 15 jersey to star center Nikola Jokic, as he called out the organization for what he described as a 'petty maneuver.'

The 39-year-old, former forward is widely considered as one of the most prolific Nuggets players of all time after having played eight seasons in Denver from 2003 to 2011. He also made three All-Star teams with the Nuggets before asking to be traded to his hometown New York Knicks.

'It was a petty maneuver,' he said on his podcast, 7PM in Brooklyn, on Thursday. 'It wasn't like, ''Oh we got numbers to choose from.'' It was like, ''Here, you got 15.'''

Jokic wore No. 15 while playing in Serbia before coming to the NBA in 2015, but Anthony thinks management could have given the big man his former number out of resentment for their former star, a.k.a himself.'

'And y'all put Jokic in the middle of that,' Anthony said. 'He don't know what the f*** going on. He could've been like, ''I want to wear 15.'' He could've been like, ''I want to wear 15, 15 is here.'' Oh that's Melo's number. You know what I mean?

'Just pay homage. I don't know. He could've wore it because he wanted to pay homage. But what I believe is that they gave him 15 to try to eras what I did.'

Anthony's departure for the Big Apple left him sitting third on the all-time scoring list with 13,970 points. Jokic isn't too far behind him nowadays, with 13,023 points as a Nugget.

The 2023 NBA champion also holds Denver's franchise records in rebounding (6,721), assists (4,307), double-doubles (408), and triple-doubles (116). He's a two-time MVP, too, while donning Melo's old number.

Anthony's exit from the Nuggets happened in 2011. Anthony Randolph was the heir to his No. 15 jersey in Denver for the 2013-14 season before Jokic joined the team just a year later.

At 28, the Serb still has time on his side to keep on breaking franchise and league-wide records with the No. 15 jersey. On the other hand, now that has been retired since 2022, Melo can only hope to be part of the rafters in Ball Arena one day.

'I used to think about it. I don't think about the s*** no more, though,' Anthony said.

'What's meant to be is meant to be.'
