        "text": "In the latest episode of his \"7 PM in Brooklyn\" podcast, Carmelo Anthony opened up about the Denver Nuggets' decision to give Nikola Jokic the No. 15 jersey, a number synonymous with Anthony's time in the Mile High City.\n\nAnthony believes this move was not a mere choice from a selection but a \"petty maneuver\" aimed at erasing his legacy with the team.\n\nCarmelo Anthony shows resentment towards Nuggets\n\nReflecting on his successful tenure with the Nuggets, Anthony expressed his surprise and disappointment at the jersey number change, stating, \"I'm like, (expletive) is going on? 15? So now, just start thinking, this is because this is the narrative that they put out there.\n\n'He wanted to leave. He wanted to do this.' Nah. But why would you disrespect by even offering that?\"\n\nAnthony believes the decision to hand Jokic his old number was a deliberate act of disrespect, showcasing the organization's desire to distance itself from his legacy.\n\nDespite leading the Nuggets to several playoff appearances and being named an All-Star multiple times during his seven full seasons with the team, Anthony perceives this move as a clear indication of the organization wanting to \"erase everything that came prior.\"\n\nJokic as the new face of the Denver Nuggets\n\nJokic, who has worn No. 15 since his youth basketball days in Serbia, might have intended to pay homage to Anthony.\n\nHowever, Anthony contends that the jersey change was orchestrated to undermine his accomplishments.\n\nHe sees it as a deliberate attempt to shift the narrative surrounding his time with the Nuggets.\n\nWhile Jokic has since become the face of the franchise, Anthony emphasizes that the number 15 in Denver now symbolizes a different era-the Joker's era.\n\nAnthony acknowledges the generational shift but believes the Nuggets are still holding onto a moment from over a decade ago, emphasizing that \"this is 2010. This is 13 years ago.\"\n\n\"When you think of 15 in Denver now, to this generation, you [think the] Joker,\" he said.\n\n\"And there's nothing towards that. It's just, it was two different generations. So that just goes to show me that y'all [The Nuggets] not past that moment. This is 2010. This is 13 years ago. So if you are, you are holding on to something that was 13 years ago.\""
