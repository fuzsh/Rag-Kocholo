        "text": "Carmelo Anthony and LeBron James have been linked to one another since they highlighted the star-studde 2003 NBA Draft Class, LeBron going No. 1 overall and Anthony going at No. 3.\n\nThey won two Olympic gold medals together, in the 2008 and 2012 Olympics Games.\n\nAnd just last month they were palling around at the Nike Peach Jam in North Augusta, S.C., where each sponsored grassroots basketball teams.\n\nNow they will finally unite in the NBA after Anthony agreed to a one-year deal to play alongside James with the Los Angeles Lakers, as reported by ESPN’s Adrian Wojnarowski. Anthony will join a super-team that features James, Anthony Davis and Russell Westbrook, and is the favorite to win the NBA title.\n\n“I’ve always wanted to play along Melo and if the opportunity presents itself, it would be great. So we’ll see what happens,” James said in 2018 after the two had dinner at a New York City steakhouse.\n\nAnthony, 37, is the 10th-leading scorer in NBA history (27,370 points), with James at No. 3 (35,367).\n\nHe spent the last two seasons playing well with the Portland Trail Blazers, averaging 13.4 points in 24.5 minutes per game while shooting a career-best 40.9% from 3.\n\nAnthony also played for the Denver Nuggets, New York Knicks, Oklahoma City Thunder and Houston Rockets.\n\nWith the addition of Anthony, the Lakers now have five players 35 or older, including James (36), Marc Gasol (36), Trevor Ariza (36) and Dwight Howard (35). They have eight players 32 or older, earning them the nickname “Purple and Golden Girls.”\n\n“They’re not just old, they’re the Senior Tour of the NBA right now,” ESPN’s Tony Kornheiser joked on ESPN’s “Pardon the Interruption.” “They’re going to petition to start their games at 5 in case they want to go to sleep at 7:30.”\n\nThe Lakers on Tuesday also agreed to terms with former Kentucky guard Malik Monk, 22, per Wojnarowski.\n\nMonk averaged 11.7 points per game and shot a career-high 40.1% from 3-point range last season with Charlotte.\n\nThe Lakers also added guard Kendrick Nunn, 26, on a two-year deal after he averaged 14.6 points and 3.2 rebounds last season with Miami, per Wojnarowski\n\nFormer Iowa State guard Talen Horton-Tucker also agreed to a three-year, $32M deal to stay with the Lakers, Wojnarowski reported."
