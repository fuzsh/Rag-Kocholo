        "text": "HOUSTON â€” Monday morning, Carmelo Anthony officially retired from the NBA after 19 seasons.\n\nAnthony announced his retirement in a social media post on Instagram and Twitter. He thanked everyone who supported him throughout his career while expressing his longing to have his son, Kiyan Anthony, carry his basketball legacy.\n\nAnthony's Hall-of-Fame career took a brief detour in 2018 after he joined the Houston Rockets. He averaged 13.4 points and 5.4 rebounds but played in 10 games with two starts before his premature exit.\n\nAnthony's short tenure with the Rockets was the lowest moment of his NBA career. But before joining the Rockets, Anthony had already established himself as one of the best players of his generation.\n\nAfter leading the Syracuse Orange men's basketball program to the national title, Anthony began his career with the Denver Nuggets as the No. 3 pick of the 2003 NBA Draft.\n\nHe spent eight seasons in Denver before a trade sent him to the New York Knicks in February 2011. Between his time with the Nuggets and Knicks, Anthony became a 10-time All-Star and NBA scoring champion in 2013.\n\nAs a member of the NBA's 75th Anniversary Team, Anthony received three Olympic gold medals. He scored 28,289 career points, which ranks ninth all-time in NBA history.\n\nIn addition to the Knicks, Nuggets and Rockets, Anthony also spent time as a member of the Oklahoma City Thunder, Portland Trail Blazers and Los Angeles Lakers.\n\nYou can follow Coty M.
