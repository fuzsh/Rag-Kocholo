        "text": "Garrett Ellwood/NBAE via Getty Images\n\nNikola Jokić helped the Denver Nuggets secure a 110-105 victory over the San Antonio Spurs on Tuesday with a brilliant performance and further cemented his place in franchise history in the process.\n\nJokić finished with 42 points, 16 rebounds, six assists, two blocks and one steal, which propelled him ahead of Carmelo Anthony for third on the Nuggets' all-time scoring list:\n\nThe big man now has 13,978 career points for Denver, which is ahead of Anthony's mark of 13,970. Only Alex English (21,645) and Dan Issel (16,589) are ahead of Jokić on the list at this point.\n\nAnthony played the first seven-plus seasons of his career on the Nuggets until they traded him to the New York Knicks during his eighth. He averaged 24.8 points per game during his tenure in Denver, which was the highest of any of his six stops during a career that went from 2003 to 2022.\n\nJokić has been with the Nuggets since they selected him with a second-round pick in the 2014 NBA draft. He has averaged 20.9 points per game and won back-to-back MVP awards in 2020-21 and 2021-22.\n\nHe also led Denver to a championship last season.\n\nWhile Jokić isn't known as just a scorer, he was unstoppable against Victor Wembanyama and the Spurs on Tuesday and went 18-of-32 from the field. It was quite the battle between the best big man in the league and the future star, and Wembanyama ended up with 23 points, 15 rebounds, eight assists and a stunning nine blocks."
