        "text": "When Carmelo Anthony stood on top of the podium in Beijing last year, clutching an Olympic gold medal, it was – to that point – as good as it had gotten. Sure, the Denver Nuggets' forward had won a NCAA Championship in his sole year at Syracuse University. He'd been named as an All-Star in the NBA. Been spoken about as a great scorer, a terrific personality. But in the same camera shot as Anthony stood USA team-mates who were his presumed peers but yet still stood apart.\n\nKobe Bryant, then the NBA's reigning Most Valuable Player, already had three championship rings in his jewellery box. Dwyane Wade, selected one place below him in the fabled 2003 Draft, had one (as, of course, did the man chosen one above, Darko Milicic). Although LeBron James was still awaiting his turn, he had enough plaudits in the bag to secure his status as The Next Great Thing.\n\nAnthony? He could put up the points and he had all the charm. However, Denver had suffered five straight first-round exits in the play-offs during his spell in the Rocky Mountains. There were glimmers of potential, signs that the New Yorker could still elevate himself among the adjoining uber-stars. That status, though, has the pre-condition of success attached.\n\nNow, with the Nuggets preparing to face Bryant's Los Angeles Lakers in the Western Conference finals, finally we might be witnessing the arrival of 'Melo into the genuine elite. Not only has his team smashed through the glass ceiling, it's done so with Anthony performing like someone who won't be satisfied with just one piece of high-value bling. During these play-offs, he's averaged 27 points and 6.4 rebounds. He's shot 48% from the field. Although Chauncey Billups remains the on-court leader, the face of the franchise has become more audible than ever before. Even though the Nuggets were the second seed in the West, many expected them to flame out. Instead, they extinguished New Orleans and Dallas inside five games in a statement of intent.\n\n\"A lot of people didn't expect us to be here,\" Anthony admitted. \"A lot of people didn't even except us to win our division. We were supposed to be third in our division. To overcome all of that, to stick together when people said we couldn't do something. And we did it.\"\n\nIt would be unfashionable to suggest the Nuggets have the edge over the Lakers, despite the struggles that Bryant & Co had in shaking off undermanned Houston in the last round. Anthony has been reminded more than once in recent days of his own struggles during this campaign against their rivals, averaging just 14.5 points as LA claimed the season series 3-1.\n\nThey've struggled on the road all year. And Kobe is still Kobe. Denver have undergone a gradual metamorphosis, however. \"We're just a totally different basketball team right now, so none of that stuff really matters,\" Billups underlined. \"It's play-off basketball. It's a different intensity, it's a different focus. Everything is different.\"\n\nHe could have been talking about his running mate, Anthony. A year ago, when the Lakers swept the Nuggets out in the first-round, he looked distinctly mortal. Now, he's ready for whatever they can bring.\n\n\"I'm not worried,\" Anthony said. \"They are going to do what they are going to do. They're going to send two, three people at me. They are going to shift the whole defence on me. I just continue doing what I've been doing throughout this whole play-offs.\"\n\nIf he can, the Nuggets might yet strike gold.\n\nPredictions\n\nEast Finals: Cleveland 4-1 Orlando (Game 1, Thursday, 1.30am on Setanta Sports 2)\n\nWest Finals: Denver 4-3 Los Angeles Lakers (Game 1, Wednesday, 2am on Five)\n\nOffensive Rebounds\n\nWith a handful of head coaching vacancies still up for grabs, the best playcaller outside North America isn't sitting by the phone. But if it rings, then he'll gladly take the call. Ettore Messina has won every honour imaginable in European club basketball, as well as coaching his native Italy to a European Championship final. His offensive schemes have long been the subject of admiration on both sides of the Atlantic. Having accomplished so much, there is only one avenue left to conquer.\n\nMessina, who recently took CSKA Moscow to the Euroleague final, is still regarded as a left-field contender for the Sacramento Kings post after being previously linked with New Jersey before Lawrence Frank held down his job. With the myth of Europe's players not being good enough for the NBA now firmly dispelled, surely the next step is for a coach to make the leap?\n\n\"It's not that I should consider the NBA,\" the 49-year-old Sicilian declared. \"It's that they should consider me. It would, for sure, be an interesting challenge and experience but it is not something I can control. Unfortunately nothing comes of it. You read the press, you enjoy the gossip because in this job, good press is important.\"\n\nMessina has some experience within the NBA system, having previously taken charge of Denver's summer league team. Yet even with his impeccable credentials, the varying nature – and rules – of Europe and the NBA would require an adjustment.\n\n\"It would be tough, certainly,\" he said. \"You would need time. You would need very good assistants. You would need a franchise who would be behind you and who would understand you might start off losing because it is a different environment and a different game.\"\n\nWith both October's NBA exhibition game between the Chicago Bulls and the Utah Jazz and Great Britain's Eurobasket warm-up tournament still to sell out, officials of the league and British Basketball are to confer this week to finalise a joint initiative to attract spectators to their respective events which are both at London's 02 Arena. The collaboration is expected to be the first of a number of shared marketing moves involving the organisations, with the domestic BBL also understood to be ready to work more closely with the national governing body in the lead-up to the 2012 Olympics."
