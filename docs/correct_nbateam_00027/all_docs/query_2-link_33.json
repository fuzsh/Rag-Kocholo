        "text": "Early Years\n\nCarmelo Kyam Anthony was born on May 29, 1984, in Brooklyn, New York. His father, Carmelo Iriarte, was Puerto Rican and a member of the Young Lords, a revolutionary civil rights group that fought discrimination against Puerto Ricans and advocated for Puerto Rican independence. Iriarte died when Anthony was two years old. Anthony’s mother, Mary Anthony, later relocated the family to Baltimore, Maryland.\n\nPlaying for Towson Catholic High School outside Baltimore, Anthony developed into a star player. As a senior in high school, he received a partial scholarship to attend Oak Hill Academy, a private prep school in western Virginia that was noted for its successful basketball program. One of the most sought-after college basketball recruits in the country, Anthony chose to attend Syracuse University in New York. In 2002–03 he led Syracuse to its first National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) men’s basketball championship during his freshman season. Anthony was named the NCAA Final Four Most Outstanding Player. He was also named Big East Conference Freshman of the Year. After playing just one year of college basketball, Anthony left Syracuse to play professionally. The 6-foot 7-inch (2-meter) forward was selected with the third overall pick of the 2003 NBA draft by the Denver Nuggets.\n\nNBA and National Team Career\n\nIn Anthony’s rookie year in the NBA he started in all 82 regular-season games. He averaged 21 points, 6.1 rebounds, 2.8 assists, and 1.2 steals per game that season. He helped lead the Nuggets to 43 wins, more than double their win total from the previous season. The Nuggets also earned a spot in the playoffs for the first time in nine years. Anthony was selected to the All-Rookie team.\n\nIn the 2005–06 season Anthony became the second youngest player in NBA history to reach 5,000 career points. The following season he made the first of his 10 All-Star Game appearances and averaged a career-high 28.9 points per game. In 2008–09 he helped the Nuggets reach the Western Conference finals, where the team lost to the eventual league champion, the Los Angeles Lakers. Despite Anthony’s stellar individual play, his tenure in Denver was marked by the club’s playoff disappointments. The Nuggets lost in the first round of six of the seven postseasons into which he led them. He was traded to the New York Knicks in February 2011.\n\nIn 2012–13 Anthony guided the Knicks to the second best record in the Eastern Conference. His scoring average of 28.7 points per game led the NBA. That Knicks’ season ended with a loss to the Indiana Pacers in the Eastern Conference semifinals. Anthony’s offensive brilliance continued over the next several seasons with the Knicks, though he missed much of 2014–15 with a knee injury. He returned to play 72 games during the 2015–16 season with a new emphasis on being a ball distributor. He averaged a career-high 4.2 assists per game that season. In 2016–17 Anthony posted averages of 22.4 points and 2.9 assists per game. However, the Knicks failed to qualify for the postseason for the fourth straight season. In the following off-season Anthony was traded to the Oklahoma City Thunder.\n\nWith the Thunder, Anthony was not his team’s primary scorer for the first time in his career. He averaged a career-low 16.2 points per game during the 2017–18 season. He was traded to and released by the Atlanta Hawks in the off-season and signed with the Houston Rockets. Anthony appeared in just 10 games with Houston. He was later traded to the Chicago Bulls but was released in February 2019. Anthony failed to sign with another team for the remainder of the season. In November he joined the Portland Trail Blazers. He started 58 games for Portland in 2019–20, but in 2020–21 he played mostly a reserve role. Anthony signed with the Los Angeles Lakers ahead of the 2021–22 season. He became a free agent in 2022 after playing primarily as a backup for the Lakers. He did not join another NBA team and in May 2023 announced his retirement from the league. He finished his NBA career with 28,289 points scored, which was the ninth highest total in league history at the time.\n\nIn addition to his professional achievements, Anthony was a member of the 2004 bronze-medal-winning U.S. men’s Olympic basketball team and the Olympic gold-medal-winning teams in 2008, 2012, and 2016. His four medals made him the most-decorated American men’s Olympic basketball player of all time."
