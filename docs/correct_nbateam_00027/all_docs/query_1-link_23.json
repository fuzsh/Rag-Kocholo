        "text": "One of the greatest scorers in NBA history has decided to hang up his sneakers.\n\nTen-time All-Star and three-time Olympic gold medalist Carmelo Anthony announced on social media Monday that he is officially retiring from professional basketball.\n\n\"Now the time has come for me to say goodbye,\" Anthony, 38, said in a video he posted on his personal Twitter account. \"Basketball was my outlet. My purpose was strong, my communities, the cities I represented with pride and the fans that supported me along the way. I am forever grateful for those people and places because they made me Carmelo Anthony.\"\n\nAn All-American and national champion in his lone collegiate season at Syracuse, Anthony was the third overall pick – two spots behind LeBron James – in the 2003 NBA draft by the Denver Nuggets. After eight seasons with the Nuggets, he was traded to the New York Knicks as part of a blockbuster three-way deal.\n\nWith the Knicks, Anthony won the NBA scoring title in the 2012-13 season at 28.7 points per game. However, he was never able to win an NBA title as he closed out his career with stints with the Oklahoma City Thunder, Houston Rockets, Portland Trail Blazers and Los Angeles Lakers.\n\nHe did not play this past NBA season.\n\nThe NBA released a statement confirming Anthony's retirement and posted a tribute on social media.\n\nAnthony averaged 22.5 points per game over 19 seasons, finishing his career with 28,289 points – good for ninth place on the all-time NBA list.\n\nIn 2021, Anthony was named one of the 75 greatest players on the NBA's 75th anniversary team.\n\nHe was also one of the greatest players in U.S. Olympic history, winning three gold medals and one bronze.\n\nAnthony ranks first in the U.S. Olympic men's team record books for games played (31) and is the USA's record-holder in points scored with 336. He also holds the record for field goals, rebounds and free throws."
