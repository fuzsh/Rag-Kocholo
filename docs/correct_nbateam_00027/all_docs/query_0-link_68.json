        "text": "It was his mad moment, 36 seconds of unadulterated honesty in front of the metaphorical media firing squad.\n\n“Most of the people are going to say, ‘You can’t win without a star.’ I’m tired of it. I’m fed up with it. I’ve been angry about it,” Nuggets coach George Karl said last week on the, give or take, seven bazillionth time he’s talked about winning without a star. “It’s a team game. I know Miami won the championship and had a superstar, but they were the best basketball team. Our job is to try to become the best basketball team. I honestly think it can be done. I think it’s silly to not even have one person stand up and say it could be done.”\n\nWith the Knicks’ Carmelo Anthony returning to Denver on Wednesday — the first time since the NBA star forced a trade from the Nuggets in February 2011 — the star debate is back in play.\n\nTwo years later, the smaller-market Nuggets still don’t have a star, though with the way point guard Ty Lawson is playing, that perception could change within the next year.\n\nBut by all indications, the Nuggets made out well in the Melo deal, star or no star.\n\nDenver is rolling along at 42-22 and in a fight for home-court advantage in the playoffs, possibly even a No. 3 seed in the West. Denver is the third-youngest team in the NBA. All of its key players are under contract for next season, though Andre Iguodala could opt out. The Nuggets are under the luxury tax and figure to be well under next season, even if Iguodala stays. And all of this stems from the haul that general manager Masai Ujiri and the front office collected in the blockbuster Anthony trade.\n\nThe Melo deal resulted in Denver getting current starters Danilo Gallinari and Kosta Koufos, key reserve Wilson Chandler, bench warmer Timofey Mozgov and point guard Raymond Felton — whom the Nuggets flipped for Andre Miller and two draft picks, one that resulted in Denver getting Jordan Hamilton. But actually 10 players on the Nuggets’ roster arrived as an offshoot of the Melo deal. A trade exception allowed Denver to get Corey Brewer from Dallas. Another trade exception from the Felton deal was used, along with Nene, to get JaVale McGee from Washington. A future first-rounder acquired in the Melo deal was included in the big swap that nabbed Iguodala last summer. And Denver used a second-round pick from the Melo trade to draft 19-year-old Quincy Miller. Also, the Nuggets gained the right to swap first-round picks with the Knicks in 2016.\n\n“It was a great trade,” said former NBA guard Steve Kerr, now a TNT analyst. “The pieces all fit really well with a coach who is renowned for player development and up-tempo basketball. … In the end, yes, the chemistry is better. It’s not as if the team was winning in the playoffs with Carmelo anyway.”\n\nThe Nuggets haven’t won without him in the playoffs, either, getting ousted in the first round the past two years, a familiar sight when Melo was a Nugget except for one run to the Western Conference finals.\n\nLawson, who entered the weekend averaging 20.8 points and 7.5 assists in the past 23 games, is the only Nugget left who was on the team with Anthony.\n\n“Last of the Mohicans, man,” he said.\n\nLawson was asked: “Let’s say Melo wanted to be a Nugget for life and the trade never happened. Where would the Nuggets be today?”\n\n“I think it would be the same,” Lawson said. “Melo actually is playing better in New York. He’s getting everyone involved. He’s making that open pass, which is making him more dangerous, because they can’t just double him. And he’s making the open shot. And his teammates are making shots.\n\n“We’ve gotten better on defense, but I think we’d still be the exact same at where we are. Melo brought the scoring aspect, but I think we’d be the same. … I think we’re a little more dangerous. You don’t know where our scoring is coming from. With Melo, everybody had their focus on him. With us, JaVale might step up. Gallo, Iguodala, we’ve got weapons all over the place.”\n\nClearly, the Nuggets must get beyond the first round for fans to believe the team has improved and for Karl’s theory to begin to prove true. The Nuggets’ goal is to move past the first round of the playoffs in April, and perhaps be a title contender by the following April as their young players mature.\n\nOr they could plateau, as it appears the starless Grizzlies could be doing. Two years ago, Memphis extended the conference semifinals series to seven games. It appeared on the cusp of becoming a title contender. Today, the Grizzlies are battling Denver for that No. 4 seed and home-court advantage in the first round.\n\nThe reality is this: The Nuggets had a star, were forced to trade a star, and an optimist could look at the roster and believe they will be contenders — in coming years — without a star. Which is what Karl believes.\n\n“I think it was a win-win for both teams,” Ujiri said. “Both teams have moved on, even though people talk about it. We’re happy with the growth of those players. It’s kind of what we hoped it would be.”"
