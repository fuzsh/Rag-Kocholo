None of the allegations have been proven in court.\n\nThe outcome of the case could have a bearing on professional sports franchises looking to offer big signing bonuses to convince unrestricted free agents to play north of the border — a task made harder by the Liberal government’s decision to raise the top federal tax rate from 29 per cent to 33 per cent in 2016.\n\nThe tax dispute could also discourage Tavares, 33, from re-signing with the Leafs when his current seven-year, US$77 million contract ends after next season. The vast majority of the star player’s compensation for the team is structured as a bonus, with Tavares taking a salary of less than $1 million per year.\n\nArticle content\n\nAdvertisement 3\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nAfter spending nine seasons with the Islanders, including five as team captain, Tavares became the NHL’s most coveted free agent in 2018, actively pursued by the Boston Bruins, New York Islanders, Tampa Bay Lightning, San Jose Sharks and Dallas Stars.\n\n“Tavares is a marquee player and there was a great amount of interest by the Bidding Teams in signing him,” his lawyers state in the appeal filing to the tax court.\n\nAt the time, Sports Illustrated said the higher combined tax rates in Canada and Ontario meant Tavares’s effective take-home pay would be US$4.5 million per year if he signed with Toronto, compared to US$5.9 million if he had inked a deal with Dallas.\n\nBut the Mississauga, Ont., native surprised hockey-watchers by signing with the Leafs, saying it was his childhood dream to play for his hometown team. He says he turned down larger bids from other teams to play in Toronto, including a US$91-million, seven-year offer from San Jose.\n\nThe US$15.3-million signing bonus offered by Toronto “was integral” in his decision, the appeal says.\n\nThe CRA’s reassessment says Tavares’s income for 2018 was $17.8 million higher than reported, and calculated that he owed an additional $6.8 million in taxes, plus $1.2 million in interest on the arrears, according to the appeal.\n\nAdvertisement 4\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nHowever, Tavares argues that the bonus was paid into his New York-based bank account in July 2018 and that he spent only 45 days in Canada between September and December of that year, once he began playing with Leafs.\n\n“The signing bonus was consideration for Tavares — a uniquely skilled and sought-after unrestricted free agent — committing to the seven-year Contract with the Toronto Maple Leafs,” the appeal says, claiming it was “not salary, wages or other remuneration in respect of employment.”\n\nThe $17.8-million payment in the CRA’s sights represents only the 2018 portion of Tavares’s entire signing bonus, which totals US$70.9 million over the term of his contract. The remainder of his overall compensation is paid in an annual salary of $910,000.\n\nTavares’s appeal argues that the bonus is different from salary, because it would still be paid to him if he were traded, sent to the minors or injured, and it should not be considered normal income for tax purposes.\n\nAs such, he argues, the 2018 portion of the bonus should be taxed at only the 15-per-cent U.S. inducement rate.\n\nAdvertisement 5\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nTax rates are only one factor professional athletes consider when signing contracts, along with the quality of the team and the city. New York City, for example, is considered particularly unattractive from a tax perspective because of the high combined federal, state and municipal rates.\n\nBut there are tax mechanisms, such as retirement compensation agreements, that can be used to defer income and offset the disadvantage of playing for the Toronto Blue Jays, Toronto Raptors or any of Canada’s seven NHL teams.\n\nNational Post\n\nRecommended from Editorial\n\nCRA has fired 185 employees who illegally received CERB\n\nFederal court throws out lawsuit of Ontario illegal pot farmer who sued CRA for $10M\n\nOur website is the place for the latest breaking news, exclusive scoops, longreads and provocative commentary.
