        "text": "The SouthCoastToday newspaper has reported that New Bedford, Massachusetts, the hometown of legendary soul music quintet Tavares, may be naming a street after the group.\n\nCity Council member Derek Baptiste has filed a motion to change the name of a portion of the city’s Griffin Court to Tavares Brothers Way. Baptiste told SouthCoast Today, “They never forgot New Bedford. When they were at their height they always represented New Bedford, they are beloved by our community and should be honored for the impact they had on both the city and the Cape Verdean community.”\n\nLongtime SoulTrackers know that Tavares was the first act we ever profiled on SoulTracks, way back in 2003. And the five brothers from New Bedford – Ralph, Tiny, Chubby, Butch and Pooch Tavares – created some of the most consistently high quality soul music of the 70s and 80s.\n\nOriginally called “Chubby and the Turnpikes,” the Tavares brothers spent the late ’60s and early ’70s in their native New England covering tunes of R&B greats at various clubs, while trying to land a record deal. They finally scored a contract with Capitol Records’ then-new black music division and released their first single, “Check It Out,” in 1973. It soared to the top 10 on the R&B charts and became the group’s first top 40 pop hit. It also became the centerpiece for the their Johnny Bristol-produced debut album of the same name. It also provided a glimpse of tight brotherly harmonies and alternating lead vocals that would become the Tavares trademark sound.\n\nOver the next half decade, Tavares moved to the A-List of popular Black groups, with smash hits like “It Only Takes A Minute,” “Heaven Must Be Missing An Angel,” and the Grammy winning “More Than A Woman.” One of the few groups that was able to create an identity as both an R&B and Disco act, Tavares featured consistently tremendous vocals and just as consistently strong material right into the early 80s, when they stopped actively recording. They’ve continued to be a touring group for the four decades since.\n\nBrother Arthur “Pooch” Tavares retired from the group in 2014 due to health issues, and Antone “Chubby” Tavares retired earlier this year. Sadly, Ralph Tavares died in 2021. The legacy of the group warrants the kinds of flowers that the members have received over the past several years, including the SoulTracks Lifetime Achievement Award. And it would be wonderful if New Bedford took this moment to honor the remaining living members of one of the great vocal groups of the past half century."
