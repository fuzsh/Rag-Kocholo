        "text": "It’s been almost 60 years since the Toronto Maple Leafs won a Stanley Cup. In 1967, the last year of the “original-six” NHL, they defeated the Montreal Canadiens four games to two to win their 13th Cup. Since then, Montreal has won 10 Cups. But their last was in 1993, which was also the last time a Canadian team won. Why the drought? Today, with 32 teams in the league, competition for talent is fierce, and Canada’s personal tax rates — among the highest in the world — make it hard for Canadian teams to attract hockey’s best players.\n\nBut our tax rates didn’t stop John Tavares from returning to Canada. Born in Mississauga and raised in Oakville, Tavares was selected first overall by the New York Islanders in the 2009 draft. In nine seasons with the Islanders, he averaged just over 30 goals a year and was a five-time All-Star.\n\nTavares was the crown jewel of the 2018 free-agent class. After meeting with six teams, he signed a seven-year, US$77-million contract with the Leafs. The San Jose Sharks had offered US$91 million for seven years. But Tavares was a hometown boy, and with young stars like Auston Matthews, the Leafs were a team with potential.\n\nTavares receives a relatively modest salary from the Leafs: less than US$1 million a year. Most of his compensation — about US$71 million — is legally a signing bonus.\n\nWhen Tavares received the first US$15 million bonus, he was still a tax resident of the U.S.: he only moved to Toronto later that year. Even as a non-resident, he was taxable in Canada — but at a rate of 15 per cent under the Canada-U.S. tax treaty, rather than the much higher personal tax rates Canadian residents pay. Or so he thought: the Canada Revenue Agency disagrees. It has assessed Tavares for more than $8 million in tax and interest, saying he was not in fact entitled to the reduced rate of 15 per cent. Lawyers for Tavares have filed an appeal, and it’s now up to the tax court to decide.\n\nIt seems odd that the CRA has decided to challenge Tavares. The Canada-U.S. tax treaty states that the tax rate on an amount paid as an inducement to sign an agreement for athletic services shall not exceed 15 per cent. And there’s a 1988 CRA interpretation letter confirming the 15 per cent rate for NHL players, provided the payment is for a “true signing bonus.” The treaty rate may seem generous but, as a U.S. tax resident, Tavares paid full U.S. tax on the $15-million bonus (minus a credit for the 15 per cent Canadian tax).\n\nWill the outcome of the Tavares case be pivotal when stars consider signing with Canadian teams in future? No. Even if Tavares prevails, little will change. The US$15 million he received while he was living in the U.S. was taxed in the U.S. And on the rest, including the “signing bonuses” of about US$56 million received from 2019 to 2022, he will have paid the federal/Ontario rate of 53.5 per cent.\n\nSigning bonuses are not the issue: the problem is Canada’s confiscatory personal tax rates — a problem exacerbated by the four-percentage point increase introduced by the Trudeau government in 2016. Our top-bracket rates are among the highest in the world, topped only by those in Japan, Denmark, France and Austria. But of course we aren’t competing with Japan, Denmark, France and Austria for hockey players: we’re competing with teams in the U.S. The top U.S. federal rate is only 37 per cent, and nine states — including five with NHL teams — levy no state tax at all. A player earning $6 million a year, for example, receives about $3.8 million after-tax if playing for a team in Florida, but only $2.8 million if playing in Ontario.\n\nHow fossils fuelled the GDP hockey stick\n\nCanada lost $225B in foreign investment since 2016\n\nCanada should follow Ireland’s path to thriving economy\n\nIn short, a court decision in favour of Tavares will not eliminate the tax disadvantage that applies to Canadian teams. And it won’t return the Stanley Cup to Toronto.\n\nFinancial Post\n\nAllan Lanthier, retired partner of an international accounting firm, has been an advisor to both the Department of Finance and the Canada Revenue Agency."
