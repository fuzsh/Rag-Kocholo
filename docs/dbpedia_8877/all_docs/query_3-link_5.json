        "text": "City in Florida\n\nTavares ( , tuh-VAIR-ees) is a city and the county seat of Lake County, Florida.[4] The population at the 2020 census was 19,003,[5] and in 2019 the population was estimated to be 17,749.[6] It is part of the Orlando–Kissimmee–Sanford Metropolitan Statistical Area.\n\nHistory\n\n[edit]\n\nOrganized in 1885, and completed in 1888 on land donated by St. Clair-Abrams, the Union Congregational Church was the first church in Tavares.\n\nTavares was founded in 1880 by Alexander St. Clair-Abrams, a newspaper and railroad man from a Creole family in New Orleans[citation needed] . He gave it the surname of a Portuguese ancestor. In 1883 a post office was established; by the next year, a hotel, three stores, a sawmill, and eight cottages were built.[7] St. Clair-Abrams's dream of Tavares as the state capital was not realized, but in 1887 it was designated the county seat of Lake County. St. Clair-Abrams later chartered a railroad from Tavares to Orlando. In 1919, Tavares incorporated as a town.\n\nGroveland Four\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Groveland Four\n\nIn 1949, the Groveland Four, were wrongly accused of raping a white woman in 1949.[8] One was killed after fleeing, and three were convicted at trial in Tavares. The two adults were sentenced to death and the minor to life in prison. The Supreme Court of the United States overturned the verdict and ordered a new trial for the two capital defendants. One was killed while being transported to Tavares in 1951. Walter Irvin survived the shooting by the sheriff and was convicted again at trial.[9] In 1955, his death sentence was commuted to life. He was paroled in 1968 and died in 1970. In 2016, the city of Groveland and Lake County formally apologized to families of all the men for injustice; in 2017, the Florida Legislature issued a formal apology and exonerated the men, calling on the governor to officially pardon them.[10]\n\nGeography\n\n[edit]\n\nTavares is at (28.801670, –81.733548).[11] It sits on an isthmus between Lake Eustis to the north and Lake Dora to the south. The city of Eustis borders Tavares to the northeast, and Lake Harris is to the west.\n\nU.S. Route 441 passes through the north side of Tavares, leading east 6 miles (10 km) to Mount Dora and west 10 miles (16 km) to Leesburg. Florida State Road 19 joins US 441 through part of Tavares, but leads northeast 5 miles (8 km) to Eustis and southwest 14 miles (23 km) to Florida's Turnpike in the outskirts of Groveland. Tavares is 32 miles (51 km) northwest of Orlando and 43 miles (69 km) southeast of Ocala.\n\nAccording to the United States Census Bureau, Tavares has a total area of 13.7 square miles (35.6 km2); of this, 12.2 square miles (31.5 km2) are land and 1.6 square miles (4.1 km2), or 11.62%, are water.[12]\n\nDemographics\n\n[edit]\n\nHistorical population CensusPop.Note%± 1900113—191017554.9%1920359105.1%19301,090203.6%19401,1192.7%19501,76357.6%19602,72454.5%19703,26119.7%19804,39834.9%19907,38367.9%20009,70031.4%201013,95143.8%202019,00336.2%\n\n2010 and 2020 census\n\n[edit]\n\nTavares racial composition\n\n(Hispanics excluded from racial categories)\n\n(NH = Non-Hispanic)\n\nRace Pop 2010[14] Pop 2020[15] % 2010 % 2020 White (NH) 11,047 12,932 79.18% 68.05% Black or African American (NH) 1,349 2,304 9.67% 12.12% Native American or Alaska Native (NH) 48 56 0.34% 0.29% Asian (NH) 235 725 1.68% 3.82% Pacific Islander or Native Hawaiian (NH) 7 7 0.05% 0.04% Some other race (NH) 22 103 0.16% 0.54% Two or more races/Multiracial (NH) 160 653 1.15% 3.44% Hispanic or Latino (any race) 1,083 2,223 7.76% 11.70% Total 13,951 19,003\n\nAs of the 2020 United States census, there were 19,003 people, 7,610 households, and 4,337 families residing in the city.[16]\n\nAs of the 2010 United States census, there were 13,951 people, 6,070 households, and 3,749 families residing in the city.[17]\n\n2000 census\n\n[edit]\n\nAs of the census[3] of 2000, there were 9,700 people, 4,471 households, and 2,821 families residing in the city.
