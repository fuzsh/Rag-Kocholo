        "text": "NEW BEDFORD - In a voice less strong than it once was, Antone “Chubby” Tavares thanked the many people who came out Saturday to celebrate the city's newest street, Tavares Brothers' Way.\n\nThe New Bedford street was named in honor of the internationally famous music group made up of the Tavares brothers.\n\nTheir celebrity filled their New Bedford community with pride - especially its vibrant Cape Verdean community - and reflected well on the city.\n\nTwo of the brothers have passed away - Ralph Tavares in 2021 and Arthur \"Pooch\" Tavares in April.\n\nChubby Tavares was joined Saturday by brothers Perry \"Tiny\" Tavares and Victor Tavares. The fifth brother in the group, Feliciano \"Butch\" Tavares wasn't in attendance.\n\nTavares Brothers' Way will remain 'in perpetuity'\n\nChubby, looking out over the crowd, said, \"I'm so happy to be here. I thank God every morning when I wake up that I've lived to see another day.\"\n\nHe added, \"This is what life is all about. I'm here today. You're here today. Gone tomorrow.\"\n\nBut that doesn't mean we won't see those loved ones again, he added, like his two brothers and his late son.\n\n\"God has another purpose for them. And we love them. And we pray for them every day. Like all the rest of our great Cape Verdean friends and family that have passed. I have a hard time speaking but you know where I'm coming from.\"\n\nTavares Brothers' Way will remain \"in perpetuity,\" said Mayor Jon Mitchell.\n\nHe said, \"We're naming permanently a very prominent street in the city.\"\n\nWhat was Griffin Court, intersecting with Route 18, is now Tavares Brothers' Way.\n\nThe street's location is 'most appropriate'\n\nThe location is most appropriate, he said, as the site of \"the original Cape Verdean neighborhood in the United States,\" which drew cheers and applause from the many in attendance.\n\nStreets are named to honor those who have done great deeds, he said.\n\nThe Tavares brothers have given back to the city time and time again, he said. He added their fame is not only international but generational.\n\nA 25-year-old New Zealand woman who was visiting the city recently took only three beats to recognize, \"More than a Woman,\" he said.\n\n\"They created something that was timeless,\" Mitchell said.\n\nCouncilor Baptiste: 'They put us on the map'\n\nCity Councilor Derek Baptiste, who made the motion to name the street in honor of Tavares, said, \"What a way to start Cape Verdean Recognition Week, by honoring the biggest. They put us on the map. They set the tone for a bunch of artists around here to make their way.\"\n\nBaptiste added, \"Everything they've done over the years. They still call here home. And they still treat us all with love.\"\n\nHow it started: New Bedford street could be named for hometown music icons Tavares\n\nCouncilor Gomes: 'Their achievements have been worldwide'\n\nCity Councilor Brian Gomes, long an advocate for officially recognizing Tavares' impact on the community, said, \"We all danced and sang to Tavares. And we all wanted to be Tavares.\"\n\nGomes added that Tavares has provided \"a lot of great moments. The love for Tavares in this community is stronger than ever. Their achievements have been worldwide.\"\n\nAnd, he said, \"I'll sing the songs until the last days I live.\"\n\nCity council: New Bedford honors iconic music group Tavares with street, Tavares Brothers' Way\n\n'Thank you all for coming out. We love you.'\n\nPerry “Tiny” Tavares thanked the city and city councilors for the honor.\n\n\"It's about paying tribute to our family, but it's also about paying tribute to the village because without the village we wouldn't be the gentlemen we are now, to get us where we are today. Thank you all for coming out. We love you.\"\n\nHe added, \"We have to keep in mind my brother Pooch, and my brother Ralph. They're with us. I feel them.\"\n\nRemember: Lead singer for the Grammy winning, Billboard topping R&B group Tavares dies\n\nTavares' stunning history of successes\n\nTavares' stunning history of successes included eight singles on Billboard's Top 40, 12 singles on the R&B Top 10 Chart (including three No. 1 records), three Dance Chart Hits, including a No. 1, and 10 hit albums.\n\nTheir hits included, \"Heaven Must Be Missing an Angel,\" in 1976 and the Bee Gees song, \"More Than a Woman.”\n\nTavares won a Grammy in 1978 for their work on the soundtrack to “Saturday Night Fever,” which was one of the most successful soundtracks in history.\n\nHow Tavares got started\n\nTheir musical talent came from their dad, Feliciano Tavares, who was known as “Flash” as he created a name for himself in the Cape Verdean-American music scene for many decades, according to a biography of the group.\n\nTheir journey began as a trio with Chubby, Pooch, and Butch called Chubby & The Realities playing at high school and Catholic Youth Organization dances across New England. Later in the 1950s, under the direction of famed studio musician and record producer Marvin Holzman, they became Chubby & The Turnpikes.\n\nThey released their first record in 1968, “I Know The Inside Story,” and became big news in the New England music scene. It would later be considered one of the finest Northern Soul records ever made.\n\nThe brothers were inducted into the Cape Verdean Museum Hall of Fame in 2006; in 2013, they were honored with \"Lifetime Achievement Awards\" by The National R&B Music Society Black Tie Gala; and they were inducted into the Rhode Island Music Hall of Fame in 2014.\n\nDeciding in 1971 to go with the family name\n\nChubby said Saturday they spent 15 years working hard on the road.\n\n\"Then we decided in 1971 we needed to go with that family name. We built ourselves up and now everyone knew us. That's when we decided to go with Tavares.\"\n\nThe Tavares brothers were honored later Saturday afternoon in Providence where they also have roots with a ceremony at the intersection of South Main and Power streets, which was given the honorary designation of Tavares Brothers Way, according to WJAR."
