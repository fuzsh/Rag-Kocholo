        "text": "The city of New Bedford will dedicate a street on Saturday to honor hometown music group, Tavares, Mayor Jon Mitchell said in a statement Thursday.\n\n“The Tavares Brothers gained worldwide fame through their timeless hit songs, but we in New Bedford know them for their many contributions to the city, especially its Cape Verdean community,” Mitchell said. “We’re proud to honor their enduring achievements with the renaming of a street in the country’s first Cape Verdean neighborhood.”\n\nThe surviving members of the group, Antone “Chubby” Tavares, Feliciano “Butch” Tavares, and Perry “Tiny” Tavares, along with friends and family of the band, will attend the dedication ceremony for Tavares Brothers Way, according to the statement.\n\nThe street will be dedicated at 11 a.m. on the corner of Griffin Court and S 2nd Street in New Bedford, the statement said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCape-Verdean brothers, Chubby, Tiny, Butch, Pooch, and Ralph Tavares, toured around the world and performed on television talk shows and music programs as music group Tavares in the 1970s and 1980s, according to their website. An American R&B, funk, and soul group, the brothers grew up in Providence, R.I., but they considered New Bedford home, said Jonathan Darling, a spokesperson for the mayor’s office.\n\nThe eldest brother and leader of the group, Ralph passed away in his South Dartmouth home in 2021, the family told the Globe in an interview. He had worked as a court officer in New Bedford and Fall River for 30 years.\n\nThe brothers sang Cape Verdean music growing up in Providence, according to their website. Their father, “Flash,” and grandfather were musicians, the group told the Globe in a 2019 interview.\n\nThe group started their career in nightclubs around Boston, including Paul’s Mall, the Sugar Shack, and Jim Nance’s Lounge in Roxbury, before finding success in Los Angeles. They signed with Capitol Records and earned a gold record for their 1973 debut, “Check It Out.” The group’s cover version of “She’s Gone” by Hall & Oates became a No. 1 R&B hit in 1974.\n\nDuring their time, the group placed eight singles on Billboard’s Top 40, 12 singles on the R&B Top 10 chart, 10 hit albums, and won a Grammy for their work on the soundtrack to the movie “Saturday Night Fever,” their website said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn 2014, the group was inducted into the Rhode Island Music Hall of Fame, according to their website.\n\nFor a decade, the five brothers had music at or near the top of the R&B singles chart, but by 1984, Ralph wanted to get off the road and dedicate himself to his family, the family told the Globe in 2021. The group played a free show in 2019 at Boston’s City Hall Plaza, according to the City of Boston website.\n\nAva Berger can be reached at ava.berger@globe.com. Follow her @Ava_Berger_."
