        "text": "They topped the music charts, charmed Dick Clark on \"American Bandstand,\" won a Grammy Award and performed for adoring fans around the world. But for Tavares, the soulful band of New Bedford brothers, there's no place like home and nothing more important than family.\n\nThat's why they'll take the stage at Bristol Community College's Fall River campus Saturday, April 5, for a special show dedicated to their late parents. Proceeds will fund a scholarship in memory of Albina and Feliciano \"Flash\" Tavares.\n\n\"It's always a pleasure to work at home and even more special doing it for mom and dad, and for all the right reasons,\" Perry \"Tiny\" Tavares said. \"It will be geared toward the family and friends who have come out to see us and have supported us. It's another way of paying respect to the people who got us where we are.\"\n\nThe 7:15 p.m. concert will feature some of the songs that made the brothers popular. The group burned up the dance and R&B worlds in the 1970s with hits such as \"Heaven Must Be Missing an Angel,\" \"It Only Takes a Minute,\" \"She's Gone\" and \"More Than a Woman,\" which appeared on the Grammy-winning \"Saturday Night Fever\" soundtrack.\n\nThe Fall River show — featuring active band members Arthur \"Pooch\" Tavares, Antone \"Chubby\" Tavares, Feliciano \"Butch\" Tavares and Perry — also will serve as a tribute to the family's rich musical legacy. \"Flash,\" the patriarch and a lifelong musician, was inducted with his sister, Vicki Vierra, into the Cape Verdean Heritage Hall of Fame in 2007, the year before his death.\n\n\"He pretty much gave us the wherewithal to know we could sing,\" Perry said of his father. \"Our music background comes from him and my mother. My mother had a beautiful voice as well, but she was busy taking care of all those children she brought into the world and adopted.\"\n\nThe scholarship idea was born last year at a party for Fatima Veiga, Cape Verde's outgoing ambassador to the United States. Perry was seated next to BCC President John J. Sbrega and Board of Trustees Chairman Fernando Garcia, who expressed interest in hosting a show.\n\n\"I think it was being in the right place at the right time, divine intervention,\" Perry said. \"It's a great thing to be able to give it back. Every time a kid walks up to receive a scholarship, it will be given by my mother and father.\"\n\nTavares enlisted the help of longtime family friend and Acushnet native Lorraine Telo to work out the details. Telo, a music promoter, said \"Flash\" loved to baby-sit and teach music to children, including her granddaughter. She lives in Hyannis, around the corner from the home where the beloved Tavares patriarch spent his last years.\n\n\"I'm not saying this just because I'm biased, but Tavares sounds just as good today as they did 30 years ago,\" Telo said. \"They're the best harmonizing group you'll ever hear. It's unbelievable.\"\n\nTavares last appeared on the U.S. music charts in the 1980s, but their popularity endures. Their songs have been sampled in recent years by artists including 50 Cent and Jennifer Lopez. \"Heaven Must Be Missing an Angel\" reappeared on the 2000 soundtrack for \"Charlie's Angels,\" next to songs by Destiny's Child, Aerosmith and Marvin Gaye.\n\nThe singers have passed down their musical legacy to their children and grandchildren. Perry's son, Brent, is artistic director of House of Music, a New Bedford-based performing arts program. His granddaughter, Lorae, is a singer and actress who has performed locally with Fall River-based Youth Musical Theater Corporation.\n\n\"We've been given many blessings,\" Perry said.\n\nThe brothers, all in their late 60s and early 70s, perform \"a lot\" in Europe, said Perry, who, at 64, is the baby of the group. After returning in mid March from Amsterdam, they played a show in Florida.\n\n\"We're trying to keep active,\" Perry said with a laugh. \"Getting older makes you change. We can't move around as good as we used to but we still try to give as much as we can. That aspect of it will never die until I die. And when I do, my children and grandchildren will carry it on. As long as we have breath, there will be Tavares.\"\n\n-- -- --\n\nIF YOU GO\n\nWHAT: Tavares in concert\n\nWHEN: Saturday, April 5, 7:15 p.m.\n\nWHERE: Bristol Community College Jackson Arts Center, 777 Elsbree St., Fall River\n\nTICKETS: Floor seats $45; balcony seats $30. 6:15 VIP reception tickets are $65.
