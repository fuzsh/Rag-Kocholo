        "text": "COMMERCE CITY, Colo. âÂ The Colorado Rapids have acquired midfielder Sidnei Tavares on an 11-month loan from Portugalâs FC Porto with an option to make the transfer permanent, the club announced today. The signing is pending receipt of his International Transfer Certificate (ITC) and P-1 Visa; Tavaresâ loan will run through June 30, 2024, and the midfielder will occupy a U22 Initiative and international slot on the Rapidsâ roster.Â\n\nâWeâre delighted to add a player of Sidneiâs quality to our roster,â said Colorado Rapids President PÃ¡draig Smith. âSidnei is a young, athletic midfielder who is technically gifted and has the attributes to immediately make an impact on both sides of the ball. We look forward to welcoming him to the club and getting him acclimated as quickly as possible.âÂ\n\nA native of Cascais, Portugal, Tavares joined Leicester City's academy at the age of nine in 2010, later signing his first pro contract with the then-English Premier League side in 2019 at the age of 17. He made his debut with Leicester in a UEFA Europa League match on February 25, 2021, against SK Slavia Prague and went on to record two Premier League appearances during his time at the club. At the youth level, he scored 11 goals and provided four assists for Leicester City's U-18 team and one goal with three assists for their U-21 side. Over the course of his youth career, he scored 12 goals and delivered seven assists across 56 appearances.Â"
