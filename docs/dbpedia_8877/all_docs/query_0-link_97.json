        "text": "Clarence Glynn Jr. AKA Skip, 51 years old, completed his journey in life in the comfort of his home in Upper Marlboro Maryland surrounded by his loving family on Monday February 4, 2019. Skip was born in Kingsville, Texas, July 27, 1967, the son of Clarence Glynn, United States Navy Ret, and Sandra (McCarthy) Tavares. He eventually settled and grew up in his hometown of East Providence, Rhode Island where he was a graduate of East Providence Senior High School. After graduating, Skip joined the United States Air Force and became an aircraft crew chief and subsequently completed a well decorated career retiring as a Master Sergeant. During his tenure, he supported several major campaigns to include Operation Desert Shield/Storm, Iraqi Freedom, Operation Enduring Freedom and others while serving at several storied locations around the world. His love of country drove him to continue serving as a civilian Foreign Disclosure Officer with the United States Air Force at the Pentagon. Always hungry for knowledge, Skip turned his focus to higher learning resulting in completion of a Bachelor of Science degree majoring in Homeland Security from the University of Maryland. In addition to his amazing professional accomplishments, his personal life benefitted even more when he found the love of his life, Zietta Lynn Thom, while living in Maryland. The two were married October 13, 2017 and renewed their vows in a beautiful ceremony in the Dominican Republic June 8, 2018 surrounded by close friends and family. Skip had a passion for basketball, guns, Woodford Reserve, cigars and the New England Patriots! Anyone who knew Skip can attest to the impact he had on so many lives. Skip welcomed everyone with open arms. His personality and presence were beyond measure. Skip was an anomaly among the status quo. The man never met a stranger, because strangers became friends and friends became family. He touched countless lives with his larger than life spirt, sense of humor, and personality. Skip is survived by his wife Zietta Lynn Thom, his daughter Taylor Glynn, his two step children, Erika Thom and Alex Lee all of Upper Marlboro, MD, his mother Sandra Tavares of Rumford RI, his father Clarence Glynn of Providence RI, his two older sisters, Pamela Mitchell of East Providence RI, Sheila Parker of Somerset MA, as well as his baby sister Juanita Melvin (Joseph) of Fayetteville NC. Skip was also a loving uncle to 4 nephews; Stephen, Jared, Paris and Drew as well as a great uncle to Dante, Dominic, Brooklyn and Dallas. We can all rest at ease knowing Skip walked into the afterlife smiling and asking everyone there “When’d you get here?”\n\nIn loving memory: He served his country and wants to keep serving through donations to the USO who do so many great things for our service members around the globe."
