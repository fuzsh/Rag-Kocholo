His fourth solo album Unlikely Heroes will be arriving in stores on June 22.\n\n\"This CD is in memory of my son Ryan and my brother Ralph,\" Tavares said.\n\nBefore the album is released, however, Chubby will be unveiling a single from the album titled \"If It's Written in the Stars,\" Wednesday morning, May 18 at 8:30 a.m.\n\n\"'If It's Written in the Stars' is a tasty mid-tempo tune that features a very cool guitar-led groove that can play on both soul and contemporary jazz radio stations,\" Tavares said. \"It was penned by legendary songwriter Preston Glass and British soul man David Nathan.\"\n\nSouthCoast fans have been following the famed brothers for more than a half century.\n\n\"On Wednesday's radio show, I plan on announcing an incredible gig we have planned next month at Cisco Brewery, just as Cape Verdean Recognition Week kicks off,\" Tavares said.\n\nTavares released his first solo album Jealousy 10 years ago, a few months after Tavares, The Four Tops – who recorded the original version of \"Remember What I Told You to Forget\" – and the Temptations toured the UK together.\n\nTheir Grammy-winning appearance on the soundtrack to the film Saturday Night Fever, when Tavares recorded the Bee Gees song \"More Than A Woman,\" reached the Top 40 in 1977. The soundtrack became one of the most successful albums in music history."
