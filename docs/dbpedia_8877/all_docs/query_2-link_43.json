Your Pot of Gold: Unleashing Your Inner Innovator This St. Patrick's Day üáÆüá™ While green rivers and shamrock decorations are fun, St. Patrick's Day offers a surprising lesson for professionals: it's a day to celebrate innovation! St. Patrick, the Unexpected Innovator Legend tells the tale of St. Patrick introducing a completely new concept ‚Äì a complex system of thought ‚Äì to a land with established traditions. The Innovation Mindset: Here's how St. Patrick's story translates to your professional world: - Challenge the Status Quo: He wasn't afraid to tackle a big idea, even in the face of resistance. Just like in any field, sometimes the best solutions come from disrupting the norm. - Adapt and Be Creative: He found ways to connect with the people, using their familiar symbols (like the shamrock) to explain a new concept. Think outside the box to make complex ideas accessible. - Focus on Impact: His goal wasn't just presenting something new, but creating a lasting and positive influence. Always consider the real-world value of your work. So, how will you find your professional pot of gold? - Embrace innovation! Be bold, creative, and think outside the box. Just like St. Patrick, find ways to make a positive impact in your field. Happy St. Patrick's Day! ‚òòÔ∏è #innovation #professionaldevelopment #StPatricksDay\n\nNew Release from Bernhard Living - From Here to There https://lnkd.in/ecqY5KWD The ‚ÄòFrom Here to There‚Äô album consists of three experimental tone-based compositions that explore the use of different harmonic structures in non-traditional musical forms. Composition 2023.02 (Untitled) consists of a single line moving in semi-tones and minor thirds - within a pitch range between A1 to C3. It suggests never ending permutation and endless movement through time. Composition 2023.03 (Untitled) is based on a seven-note tone-cell of C - C# - D - D# - E - F# - A# - and which appear as two-note and three-note chords - with the chords repeating from moment to moment. Composition 2023.09 (Untitled) is based on the chord sequence (changes) from John Coltrane‚Äôs 1960‚Äôs jazz composition ‚ÄòGiant Steps‚Äô. The title \"From here to there\" as a philosophical concept that encapsulates several themes and interpretations. Philosophically - this phrase can signify the process of change and transformation. It highlights the journey from one state of being or understanding to another. This can be related to the development and evolution of ideas - or broader social changes. It can also refer to the passage of time - where \"here\" represents the present moment and \"there\" represents the future.\n\nTHIS! Music's effect can be nearly instantaneous. It helps to have familiar music BUT familiarity is not required! We are able to eliminate burnout in 5 minutes with strangers. And the best thing about using music is that it only reinforces itself, in the same way that a song you know and love can instantly change your mood / cognition, the more you use our music, the faster your brain will react! Who else can say that, eh? By the way, by \"our music\" I mean Evoked Response's latest productions which are available on many apps, health programs and are embedded into multiple devices (one which is going for FDA approval for sleep). We do not have our own app. Strictly B2B. If you want to experience the music yourself we have some (admittedly old) samples on the site, but we also give our entire latest library to partners and researchers FOR FREE. Indeed this is actually how we sell our music - 90% of our clients want to conduct a thorough study on their own customers, and we are happy to let the results speak for themselves. If it's a brain gaming company maybe they test if user score increases, if it's a sleep company does it improve sleep. And even companies that just want better music for their product, whatever it is. Why? It boils down to one thing: Does this music increase my bottom line? Yep! It reduces churn, increases conversion, and significantly increases engagement with the app / device. Fortunately we have a therapy that is both effective and enjoyable. I even talked recently about how we can reliably induce frission (chills)! Yup making some bold claims here. Put me to the test here or DM."
