        "text": "TAVARES: Darling of Orange County, Birthplace of Lake County, is a history of how Florida’s “Great Lake Region” transitioned from a 19th century wilderness into a vibrant Citrus Belt district. Amazing pioneers dared to dream big– dared to imagine creating such places as Leesburg, Lady Lake, Mount Dora, Montverde, Eldorado, Eustis, Umatilla, Astor, Clermont, Yalaha, and Tavares, to name but a few.\n\nThis is a story of triumph over tragedy; of homesteaders becoming town builders; of steamboats and railroads forging a new homeland, and of remarkable men and women who made it happen. There is even a touch of mystery and intrigue.\n\nTavares: Darling of Orange County, Birthplace of Lake County is a history of the earliest days of settlements of Florida’s Lake County.\n\n​"
