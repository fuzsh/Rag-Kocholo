Research Interests

Membrane transporters are the gatekeepers of all cells and organelles, controlling influx and efflux of essential organic and inorganic solutes, drugs and excretory products. Each individual cell type possesses a unique, large and diverse complement of membrane transport proteins to enable that cell to interact with its environment to import and export all material essential for life. Carrier-mediated transmembrane transport is essential in nutrient absorption from diet, neurotransmission, drug transport, osmoregulation, pH homeostasis and in the supply of components for cell growth, protein synthesis and energy production. Previously unidentified transport systems play fundamental roles in organismal biology but their importance has been over looked. New transport systems are emerging as potential therapeutic targets. The overall aim of our studies is to identify the basic functional characteristics of individual transport systems so that the physiological and pathophysiological roles can be identified and rational approaches to drug design be developed. The research falls into a number of key areas:

Epithelial transport in the small intestine and kidney: physiology & pathophysiology

The role of membrane transporters in symbiotic relationships in blood-feeding and sap-feeding invertebrates

The role of pH homeostatic mechanisms in membrane transport

Amino acid transport in cancer cells

Novel transport proteins are characterised functionally by a combination of flux measurements, imaging and electrophysiological techniques using isolated cells or mammalian cell culture. Heterologous expression of novel transporters is accomplished using the Xenopus expression system.
