        "text": "If you’ve ever read any of the eight books by David Sedaris, you probably already consider him a close and personal friend. Through his witty short stories, he seamlessly weaves back and forth between autobiography and absurdist fiction, having the reader laughing and gasping at each turn of the page. He effortlessly wraps you up in his world, introducing you to his quirky family, and keeping you on the inside of every joke. So, it came as no surprise that he was just as enthralling and humorous in person as he is in his books.\n\nThis was David Sedaris’ fourth year coming to Dallas with Arts & Letters Live, and yet the 2,500 seat SMU Auditorium was still completely sold out. After several readings and a question and answer session, many hurried to get their place in line to meet David. I say meet, because David Sedaris does not just sign books, he has a conversation with each person who approaches his table as if welcoming them into his home. Despite this taking hours, going very late into the night, Sedaris maintains his energy and enthusiasm for each and every fan. He uses his comedic flare to start unusual conversations with each visitor, and then references the encounter in the book he signs for them. With a drawing or clever comment, Sedaris turns a brief interaction into a special inside joke between the fan and him.\n\nIn my case, I was so excited to see him that I ran out the door without either of my two favorite books that I wanted him to sign. Fortunately with a simple explanation, he was more than happy to sign the program for me instead, writing, “Oh Hannah you forget everything”. So, just like many of the fans in line, I got to walk away with my very own personal story of David Sedaris.\n\nDon’t miss out on the rest of this Arts & Letters Live season!\n\nIf you have any stories from an Arts & Letters Live event, please don’t hesitate to share in the comments below.\n\nHannah Burney\n\nMcDermott Intern for Teaching Programs and Partnerships\n\nI am often inspired by a good read and I am an equal opportunity reader. I love both fiction and non-fiction books and find that both can ignite my creative capacities. Through fiction, I escape the day-to-day to walk in a character’s shoes and visit places unfamiliar, perhaps discovering an interesting metaphor that results in a richer understanding of the world around me. Encountering new perspectives from an expert in another field and reading about real-world stories and events are a few things I appreciate about non-fiction reading. These too can lead to richer understandings. Here’s a list of books on my radar presently (some in the mail as I write) for which I have high expectations of stirring my creative spirit. After you take a look at this list, then share with us what’s on your bookshelf or nightstand that is provoking you to think in new ways and see the world with fresh eyes?\n\nImagine: How Creativity Works by Jonah Lehrer – This one comes out in March, 2012 and is the third book written by author Jonah Lehrer. Lehrer has a background in neuroscience and a strong interest in the relationships between art and science. In Imagine, he discusses new science about creativity and proposes that all of us can achieve increased creativity through effectively using a distinct set of thought processes. Lucky for me (and others), Lehrer will be in Dallas on March 23, 2012 presenting at the DMA’s Arts and Letters Live programming.\n\nSketchbook with Voices by Eric Fischl and Jerry Saltz – This collection of prompts from contemporary artists was compiled in 1986 by Fischl, an artist, and Saltz, an art critic. The book was reprinted this year and I discovered it recently as I ambled through a museum gift shop. Full of empty, ready-to-be-filled pages, this sketchbook includes inspirations from artists such as Richard Serra, Susan Rothenberg, and John Baldessari.\n\nMr. g by Alan Lightman – This is the forthcoming book from one of our department’s favorite authors! Remember the recent post about Einstein’s Dreams? We cannot wait for Lightman’s new book to come out in January, 2012. Lightman, like Lehrer, is a scientist intrigued by the blurred and crossing boundaries of art and science. However, Lightman explores these ideas through novels and in Mr. g, the story of creation is told, as narrated by God. Alan Lightman is also coming to Dallas next year! On May 20, 2012 Lightman will be the featured author for Arts & Letters Live.\n\nThe Toaster Project by Thomas Thwaites – This is a recent addition to my “books to read” list. I heard about it the other day on the radio and love the curious story behind the book. In pursuit of wanting to know more about where things come from, Thomas Thwaites decided to build a toaster from scratch….\n\nNicole Stutzman\n\nDirector of Teaching Programs and Partnerships\n\nI recently became really inspired by one of my favorite Go van Gogh programs in which we discuss an abstract painting that we have paired with a Shel Silverstein poem. I really loved the new associations and meanings this juxtaposition brought to light. I decided to find more connections between Silverstein and the collection. Below you will find the original pairing that inspired me, followed by my own couplings.\n\n1.\n\nThe Dancing Pants\n\nAnd now for the Dancing Pants,\n\nDoing their fabulous dance.\n\nFrom the seat to the pleat\n\nThey will bounce to the beat,\n\nWith no legs inside them\n\nAnd no feet beneath.\n\nThey’ll whirl, and twirl, and jiggle and prance,\n\nSo just start the music\n\nAnd give them a chance –\n\nLet’s have a big hand for the wonderful, marvelous,\n\nSuper sensational, utterly fabulous,\n\nTalented Dancing Pants!\n\nThe Reveler\n\n2.\n\nWhere the Sidewalk Ends\n\nThere is a place where the sidewalk ends,\n\nAnd before the street begins,\n\nAnd there the grass grows soft and white,\n\nAnd there the sun burns crimson bright,\n\nAnd there the moon-bird rests from his flight\n\nTo cool in the peppermint wind.\n\nClouds (Wolken)\n\n3.\n\nHug O’War\n\nI will not play at tug o’ war\n\nI’d rather play at hug o’ war,\n\nWhere everyone hugs\n\nInstead of tugs\n\nWhere everyone giggles\n\nAnd rolls on the rug,\n\nWhere everyone kisses\n\nAnd everyone grins\n\nAnd everyone cuddles\n\nAnd everyone wins.\n\n4.\n\nMy Guitar\n\nOh, wouldn’t it be a most wondrous thing\n\nTo have a guitar that could play and could sing\n\nBy itself – what an absolute joy it would be\n\nTo have a guitar…that didn’t need me.\n\n6.\n\nThe Deadly Eye\n\nIt’s the deadly eye\n\nOf Poogley-Pie.\n\nLook away, look away,\n\nAs you walk by,\n\n‘Cause whoever looks right at it\n\nSurely will die\n\nIt’s a good thing you didn’t…\n\nYou did? …\n\nGood-bye.\n\nSpace\n\nAnd last but certainly not least, a very special quote from Shel Silverstein…\n\nDraw a crazy picture,\n\nWrite a nutty poem,\n\nSing a mumble-gumble song,\n\nWhistle through your comb.\n\nDo a loony-goony dance\n\n‘Cross the kitchen floor,\n\nPut something silly in the world\n\nThat ain’t been there before.\n\nSpace\n\nThese are some of the artworks I associate with Shel Silverstein’s poems. What comes to mind when you read them? Are there other artworks that they could be paired with?\n\nWant to explore more literary connections to art? Check out Arts and Letters Live. See what this year has in store for music, film, and performance at the DMA when the 2012 season is announced on December 8th. Programs fun for all ages!\n\nSPACE\n\nHope you enjoy,\n\nHannah Burney\n\nMcDermott Intern for Teaching Programs and Partnerships\n\nspace\n\nImages used:\n\nThe Reveler, Jean Dubuffet, 1964, oil on canvas, Dallas Museum of Art, gift of Mr. and Mrs. James H.

Green\n\nNicolaus Copernicus was a cleric, a physician, a mathematician—a real renaissance man. Literally. But the true passion that drove him was astronomy. Throughout his life, he took every opportunity to observe the sky and the stars, making meticulous calculations of their positions at a time before the telescope had even been invented. With this detailed data, Copernicus formulated a new theory placing the sun at the center of the universe—an idea that helped to ignite the Scientific Revolution.\n\nLike Copernicus, the Maya were astronomically-minded. Without the benefit of telescopes and other modern advances, they built monumental structures at sites like Chichén Itzá in perfect alignment with the sun during important days of equinox and solstice. Their calendars were also based on the movements of the sun and moon. Their myths and rituals share this cosmological focus, which permeated their entire culture. Even their artworks reflect their celestial mindset.\n\nThis flint, shaped like a crocodile canoe carrying its passengers in profile, captures a scene from the Maya creation story. The Maya believed the soul of the First Father was paddled in just such a canoe to the underworld, after which he was reborn as the Maize God, the ancestor of all humans. Contemporary archaeologists have dated this event to August 13, 3114 B.C., based on the Maya calendar. This event was reflected in the heavens each year on August 13, when the Milky Way could be seen floating across the sky from east to west until midnight, when it shifted downward, north to south, plunging into the underworld.\n\nAtop this lidded bowl sits the Maya sun god, Kinich Ahau, also in a canoe. As he paddles through the underworld each night, his path takes him through the constellations, one of which is represented by the pig-like mammals incised into the bowl’s legs.\n\nNext Monday, October 24, Arts & Letters Live will welcome author Dava Sobel, whose new book A More Perfect Heaven recounts the revolutionary life and work of Nicolaus Copernicus. Had he been around to observe the skies of ancient America with the Maya, I think they might have found some common ground.\n\nSarah Coffey\n\nAssistant to the Chair of Learning Initiatives\n\nWe’ll host our 1st Annual BooksmART festival on Saturday June 11th from 11am to 5pm. General admission to the Museum will be FREE with a fun-packed day of events and activities celebrating literacy and the arts for the young and young-at-heart. Our stellar lineup of authors, illustrators and performers include Rick Riordan, Laurie Halse Anderson, Norton Juster, Jerry Pinkney, David Wiesner and many more!\n\nOne of the authors that I am especially excited to hear is Cynthia Leitich Smith, a New York Times bestselling and award-winning author whose fictionfor young readers is noted for its diversity, humor, lyricism, imaginativeness, compelling action, and mid-to-southwestern settings. And I got the chance recently to ask her a few questions.\n\nQ: Why did you decide on a career writing for children and young adults?\n\nAs a child and teen, I was an avid reader and writer. I read all of the Newbery winners and everything by Judy Blume. I transitioned to spooky stories during adolescence. Along the way, I also read graphic-format books (which we used to call “comics”). In sixth grade, I had a column, “Dear Gabby” in Mr. Rideout’s classroom newsletter, offering advice to the troubled and lovelorn.\n\nI went on to become editor of my junior high and high school newspapers. From there, I earned a journalism degree and law degree, working summers for small-town and major metro newspapers (including the Dallas Morning News) and in law offices.\n\nAs a first-generation college graduate, I was mindful of pursuing writing jobs with relative security to them. But in my late 20s, after the Oklahoma City Bombing, I was reminded that life can be short, unpredictable, and precious–that we should follow our dreams and do our best to uplift others. I could imagine no pursuit closer to my heart than books for young readers, and from that point on, I’ve dedicated myself to that end.\n\nQ: You are a member of the Muscogee (Creek) Nation. How has your Native American heritage and identity influenced your writing?\n\nThe quintessential advice we give to new voices is: write what you know. For me, that meant realistic stories of lower middle class, mixed blood Native American families from the mid-to-southwest. It meant stories of daily life and intergenerational relationships and military service and loss and healing.\n\nMy first book, Jingle Dancer is about a young girl who assembles her jingle dance regalia with the aid of women of every generation of her intertribal community and then dances to honor them at a powwow. My debut novel for tweens, Rain is Not My Indian Name, is about a girl who, after the unexpected death of her best friend, slowly reconnects to the important people in her life through the lens of a camera. Indian Shoes is a collection of humorous, touching short stories for middle grade readers. They’re about young Ray and his Grandpa Halfmoon.\n\nI’ve continued writing about Native characters and themes in my short stories. In 2012, I look forward to the publication of a companion short story to one by noted Abenaki author Joseph Bruchac, which will appear in Girl Meets Boy. Our tales are a fun pairing, about two Native teens–one who’s a tall, formidable basketball-star girl and one who’s a short, scrawny boy into martial arts. It’s a love story–naturally.\n\nQ: You shifted your emphasis to fantasy for your book TANTALIZE, the first in a series. What made you want to tackle the fantasy/gothic fiction genre?\n\nI occasionally joke that I’m in the thrall of the master, by which I mean Abraham Stoker. I was fascinated by Dracula, especially with regard to the timelessness of its themes for teen (and grown-up) readers today. The classic touches on gender and power, orientation, the “dark other” (which back in the day meant Eastern European), plague, invasion, and more. All of those topics are still very much with us today, and looking at the vampire mythology itself….\n\nQ: What has been one of your most meaningful interactions with one of your readers?\n\nA handful of teenage girls have written to tell me that they have left their abusive boyfriends because of Quincie, the hero of the Tantalize series. A girl has written to say that she felt differently–better about herself–after having been assaulted by someone she’d trusted.\n\nOther kids have written to say that Rain is Not My Indian Name helped them to cope with the loss of a loved one, and an aunt told me that her niece wouldn’t speak of a friend’s death until she could do so by using the novel as a reference point.\n\nMost recently, I’m reminded of a boy–about age 14–who came up to me on my recent book tour. I was in New York City, and he approached me with a well-loved and quite tattered copy of Tantalize. He said it was the first book he’d ever finished. “The first book?” I asked, and he nodded solemnly. “The first book ever,” he emphasized. “All the way through.”\n\nQ: What are you most excited about for the BooksmART festival? Can an art museum add something to the traditional book festival?\n\nI’m excited to connect with folks who have a global love of the arts–visual, literary, and beyond. They’re people of imagination and possibilities–kindred souls and the very kind of heroes that I love to write about. Austin may be my home now, but Dallas will always be dear to me. See y’all soon.\n\nCynthia Leitich Smith will be presenting on her young adult fiction, including her latest novel, Blessed, in Horchow Auditorium.\n\nShe will also present on her books for younger readers that explore Native themes and characters in the DMA’s exhibition Art of the American Indians: The Thaw Collection.\n\nKatie Hutton is Interim Head of Arts & Letters Live at the Dallas Museum of Art\n\nGrowing up, I loved to read. I looked forward to trips to the library, and the arrival of the Scholastic Book Fair was always the highlight of my school year. I’m still an avid reader today, and I have a soft spot for children’s literature and young adult fiction (Harry Potter, and yes, even Twilight). So imagine my delight when it was announced last month that Rick Riordan, author of the Percy Jackson and the Olympians series, was one of the featured keynote authors for the DMA’s first ever BooksmART Festival.\n\nWhat exactly is the BooksmART Festival? It is a day-long free event put together by the DMA’s Arts & Letters Live team. On Saturday, June 11th, visitors of all ages can enjoy presentations, book signings, and hands-on demonstrations from a wide array of award winning authors and illustrators. A complete listing of participants can be found on our Web site. A schedule of events – including storytelling, musical performances, and tours led by our Teen Docents – will be available shortly.\n\nIn preparation for the BooksmART Festival, I interviewed my colleague and friend, Katie Hutton. Katie is the Interim Head of Arts & Letters Live, and one of the great minds behind the festival.\n\nHow long have you worked at the DMA?\n\nI have worked at the Dallas Museum of Art for almost six years. I started as a McDermott Adult Programming Intern for a year and then worked for four years as Program Manager for Arts & Letters Live. Last November, I took over as Interim Head of Arts & Letters Live.\n\nDescribe your job as the Interim Head of Arts and Letters Live.\n\nArts & Letters Live is the literary and performing arts series at the Dallas Museum of Art. We are celebrating our 20th anniversary season this year and have featured some of the greatest names in contemporary literature and the performing arts.\n\nI oversee approximately thirty-five to forty Arts & Letters Live programs each season. I work with the Director of Programming and the Arts & Letters Live team to plan each season and implement the programs. I have found that the writers, actors and artists we bring in are some of the most thoughtful and interesting people I have ever met.\n\nDuring your five years with Arts and Letters Live, which author has left you the most star-struck? Why?\n\nOoooh, that’s a good question. I was definitely a little star-struck by Gary Paulsen, author of the children’s adventure novel, Hatchet. I read that book more times than I can count when I was growing up, so it was a real thrill to get the chance to meet the man behind the story.\n\nI was also definitely star-struck by Tony Kushner. I was a drama minor in college and loved Angels in America. Tony Kushner was so smart and funny. Getting to have dinner with him and get a sneak peek into the next play he was working on is one of the highlights of my time with Arts & Letters.\n\nHow did the idea for the BooksmART Festival come about?\n\nThe idea was born about a year-and-a-half ago. We have had a BooksmART series as part of Arts & Letters Live for a number of years, in which we brought in children’s and young adult authors and illustrators. We have developed a terrific, loyal audience base for this series over the years.\n\nWhat we found, however, was that these events were cost-prohibitive for some people, and we wanted to find a way to reach a broader cross-section of the Dallas community. We decided to shift the emphasis to a day-long free festival featuring something for everyone. We hope that our loyal BooksmART audiences will come and celebrate with us, and that we will also get new visitors to the Museum to discover and embrace all that the DMA has to offer.\n\nWhich BooksmART Festival author are you most looking forward to hearing speak?\n\nI am especially excited about Norton Juster, author of The Phantom Tollbooth, which celebrates its 50th anniversary this year. I heard Norton Juster at the National Book Festival last fall. He is in his eighties but still has this boyish zeal for life.\n\nI am also very excited about Cynthia Leitich Smith. A fellow Texan, she has such an incredible range to her work. She writes for very young children right up through older teens. I find that very admirable. I also love the ways she has incorporated her Native American heritage into her stories.\n\nMy hope is that people will perhaps come to hear an author they are more familiar with but will stay and discover some new favorite authors while they are here.\n\nShannon Karol\n\nManager of Docent Programs and Gallery Teaching"
