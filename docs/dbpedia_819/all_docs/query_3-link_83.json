This may result in inaccuracies.\n\nSmoothing has been applied to series for lower-frequency words, using a moving-average algorithm. This reduces short-term fluctuations, which may be produced by variability in the content of the Google Books corpus.\n\nDecade Frequency per million words 19400.002319500.003319600.00419700.005119800.006719900.007520000.008620100.0097\n\nEntry history for bird colonel, n.\n\nbird colonel, n. was first published in December 2019.\n\nbird colonel, n. was last modified in July 2023.\n\noed.com is a living text, updated every three months.
