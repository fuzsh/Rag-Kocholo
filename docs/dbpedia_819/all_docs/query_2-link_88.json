        "text": "British Antarctic Survey medical officer appointments\n\nGeneral\n\nThe Bases and research ship\n\nThe BAS Medical Unit\n\nAppointment of Medical Officers\n\nGeneral\n\nThe British Antarctic Survey (BAS) is responsible for all United Kingdom scientific activities in the British Sector of the Antarctic continent. This sector, 850,000 square miles in extent and stretching southwards to the Pole, includes the Antarctic Peninsula and the Weddell Sea area.\n\nThe Survey originated as a naval operation in 1944, but in 1945 the Colonial Office assumed responsibility for the post-war civilian organisation. Since that time work has continued without a break, the programme being based on long term studies of earth, atmospheric and life sciences. On 1st April 1967, the Natural Environment Research Council was given responsibility for BAS.\n\nThe Survey staffs five bases at coastal sites, three throughout the year and two during the Antarctic summer. The buildings are specially designed to withstand cold and high winds. Each includes living and sleeping quarters, kitchen, offices, communications room, generator room and bathroom. Laboratories are sometimes an integral part of the main building. Other buildings are often erected nearby to accommodate workshops, storage, warehousing, special scientific instruments and experiments.\n\nThree of the bases, Halley (military secondee),Rothera and South Georgia and the ship SDA have doctors on complement. A total of some 40 -45 personnel overwinter in the Antarctic/sub-Antarctic, with an increase to over 300 during the summer months. The Survey recruits a range of technical support, engineers in many disciplines, mountaineers, cooks and domestic staff, communications officers, and scientists across a range of scientific disciplines, including; physicists, zoologists, geologists meteorologists, etc.\n\nThe BAS operation is supported by the survey vessel, the Royal Research Ship Sir David Attenborough (SDA), four twin-engine Otter and a Dash 7 aircraft, snow tractors and motorised toboggans. RRS SDA is equipped for oceanographic, marine-geological, glaciological, meteorological and biological research work.\n\nBase is home and workplace. Work outside base includes the strenuous activity of the annual base relief, general husbandry, scientific recordings and biological work. A year-round diving programme is conducted from Rothera station. Infrequently diving may be conducted from the SDA as part of the ship-based scientific programmes.\n\nRemote/off station deep field work requires a self-contained unit of motorised toboggan, sledge and tent, field rations and clothing, scientific and personnel gear, radio for communications and medical equipment. Almost all the major (weeks to months) field journeys are now concerned with research into many aspects of the cryosphere and largely originate from Rothera station and to a lesser extent from Halley. The doctors do not participate in major field excursions but are often requested to support and undertake shorter journeys.\n\nBAS employs specialists. The general work necessary in running Antarctic stations is therefore undertaken by all on an equal basis.\n\nApproximately 40 wintering personnel are recruited annually. After any training, the ship’s doctor spends a summer season (some 8 months), an overwintering tour of duty (KEP & Rothera) (about 13-19 months for the period of overseas service for the station-based doctor). Occasionally BASMU will appoint a doctor for a short deployment over summer to Halley, however this medical cover is often managed in other ways.\n\nBack to top of page\n\nThe Bases and research ship\n\nHalley\n\nCoats Land (75°35’S, 26° 46’W)\n\nMean temperature range: summer -5°C to winter -30°C\n\nSnow falls on about 175 days\n\nAverage annual sunshine 1,450 hours\n\nHalley is the most southerly of the BAS stations and the only one to be on the mainland of the continent rather than on an island. Halley is, in fact, not on firm ground, but is built on a floating ice shelf - the Brunt Ice Shelf on the south-eastern coast of the Weddell Sea. The station is sufficiently far south that in summer it bathes in the midnight sun whereas in winter it is in total darkness for some 105 days. At times the auroral zone crosses over Halley giving magnificent auroral displays in winter though at present it is a summer only station.\n\nBecause of the location of Halley, somewhat apart from the other UK stations, located on the coast of the normally ice-bound Weddell Sea. Halley can therefore justifiably claim to be the most isolated of the UK stations. At present sea ice conditions and the fragility of the Brunt Ice shelf make ship access sporadic, thus at present it is a SUMMER only station operating for with staff ashore for 3 months. Input and extraction of staff is by air. Ship relief is planned on an every three year basis by commercial supply vessel.\n\nHalley is a centre for atmospheric science research. Indeed, because of its position, it is the centre for research into the upper atmosphere and near-space. Meteorological and climatological research is also carried out, and results from the continuous measurements, showing depletion of ozone above Halley, have assumed great international importance. The summer only status means a great deal of the science has been automated for the winter period.\n\nHalley is currently staffed by a short deployment through military doctor.\n\nSigny\n\nSigny Island, South Orkneys (60°43’S, 45°36’W)\n\nMean temperature range: summer 0°C to +3°C to winter -3°C to -15°C\n\nSnow falls on about 280 days\n\nAverage annual sunshine about 520 hours\n\nSigny Island is one of the South Orkney Islands. It is small, being only about 6.5km long and less than 5km wide. There is permanent ice cover over a large part of the island, which has a maximum height of 288m. In the summer, extensive areas of moss and some tufty grass are exposed and there are numerous freshwater pools and lakes.\n\nThe base at Signy was established in 1947 primarily as a meteorological station. It was then developed into a major biological station and was equipped with laboratories, with diving facilities, a 7m launch and a number of inflatable craft for work at sea. Diving beneath the ice in winter was supported by sledge and skidoo transport.\n\nFollowing the last full year of base occupancy and endeavour over 1995/96, Signy became a summer only station in 1997.\n\nSigny is supported by a seconded military medic through the summer months.\n\nKing Edward Point, South Georgia\n\nGrytviken, King Edward Point. (54°17’S, 36°30’W)\n\nMean temperature range: summer +4.8°C to winter -1.2°C\n\nKatabatic and Fohn winds are a regular occurrence reaching gale force. Moderate synoptic winds can accelerate to over 100mph in the lee of the island. Precipitation occurs throughout the year with the average at KEP being 1600mm. Snowfalls occur year-round but at coastal levels usually do not lie for more than a few days.\n\nSouth Georgia is an isolated, mountainous sub-Antarctic Island situated in the South Atlantic 2150km east of Tierra del Fuego and 1390km southeast of the Falkland Islands. The island is about 170km long and varies from 2 to 40km in width. Due to the surrounding Antarctic waters, it has a harsher climate than its latitude may suggest. More than 50% of the island is covered with permanent ice with many large glaciers reaching the sea. The main mountain range, which runs along the spine of the island, reaches 2960m in height. The history of seal and whaling industry activity on the island stretched from 1778 to 1965. Commercial fishing in this SW sector of the Atlantic has been undertaken since the late 1960’s. The South Georgia Museum was established in 1992 at Grytviken, which is visited by passing yachts and tourist vessels. Various species of whale, seal, albatross and penguin have their habitats on and around South Georgia.\n\nThis research station was built between September 2000 and May 2001, ready for occupation thereafter. The thrust of research is primarily fisheries and marine related activity; however, other research projects get supported across a range of scientific disciplines. The station is run by the British Antarctic Survey, with funding from the Government of South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands under the direction of the UK Foreign and Commonwealth Office.\n\nKing Edward Point station is supported by a BASMU recruited doctor for a period of around 12 months deployed.\n\nRothera\n\nAdelaide Island (67°34’S, 68°08’W)\n\nMean temperature range : summer -2°C to +1°C winter -5°C to -20°C\n\nSnow or sleet on about 225 days each year\n\nAverage annual sunshine 1,100 hours\n\nRothera is the centre of the summer air operations supporting research across a large range of scientific disciplines, both on site and at range from the station. A gravel runway was completed in 1992/93 which increased the capacity for field work and permitted an air bridge between the Punta Arenas/Falkland Islands and Rothera using the Dash 7 aircraft. A snow ski way is annually prepared at Halley, enabling Twin Otter flights between Halley and Rothera.\n\nIn 1996 Rothera was equipped (including laboratories and diving facility) for the transition to succeed Signy as the BAS centre for biological research.\n\nThe station was completed in 1978/79 and replaced an earlier base on the southern tip of Adelaide Island. There is a cluster of buildings including a 2-storey living complex (New Bransfield House), the main accommodation building (Admirals House) providing accommodation for up to 88 persons in summer, an ancillary accommodation building (Giants House) a building housing the generators, scientific laboratories, boat shed, cold rooms, a facilities building that includes the station surgery, aircraft hangar and a number of other service buildings. The normal winter complement is approximately 25 people. The facilities and complement have been increased for Rothera’s redevelopment, supporting up to 168 on site, through the provision of further temporary accommodation modules. This construction camp status will likely prevail until the end of the decade, with possible further development still being scheduled.\n\nMost summer scientists are flown to remote areas and established in tented field camps with skidoo and sledge transport. Field parties may spend from 10 days to 3-4 months away from base, travelling over snow covered terrain where glaciers and crevasses are encountered. Special safety cover is provided through the employment of “field guides” to travel with the scientists. These specialists all have experience and skills in mountaineering and of operating in potentially dangerous conditions.\n\nIncreasingly large static teams are being deployed in pursuit of highly complex industrial type processes using heavy equipment with hazards such as 415 V power support, hot-water under pressure, wires under tension, in pursuit of things such as ice core drilling, hot-water drilling to depth (max 2200 m, so far). Inland tractor traverse frequently supports these large campaigns and operational deployments, increasing the range and scale of inland deployments of equipment and the coastal offload of these supplies to those tasks. As example the latest large deployment involved deploying 550 tonnes of food and fuel to a remote ice shelf in 2018-19 season. This supporting a huge multinational research collaboration on the Thwaites Glacier, looking at rapid ice recession and its impacts on global sea level change.\n\nA summer station (manned by 2-3 people) at Fossil Bluff, Alexander Island, is used by field parties and the aircraft. This small base is the only British station maintained wholly by air.\n\nA deep-field camp at Sky Blu is used to support ice runway operations for science team and equipment deployment. This site is staffed by 3 staff summer long in support of air operations to the broader base field area.\n\nMaintaining radio contact with the field parties, which usually number about 15, involving over 40 personnel and the 5 aircraft, is a major task for the radio operator and field operations manager at Rothera in the summer months.\n\nA major development project at Rothera means a significant cohort of builders are on station during the summer months for the next few years. Thus, the summer population is often near it’s operational capacity of 168 beds.\n\nRothera is supported by a BASMU doctor for a period of roughly 21 months deployment. The ingoing doctor overlaps through most of the summer with the outgoing winter over doctor to ensure two doctor cover.\n\nRRS Sir David Attenborough (SDA)\n\nThe RRS Sir David Attenborough is one of the most advanced polar research vessels in the world. It was commissioned by NERC, built by Cammell Laird for operation by British Antarctic Survey. First deployed in the Antarctic in 2020—21 season to replace previous BAS vessels it operates as the primary logistics and science vessel. This multidisciplinary research platform will transform how ship-borne science is conducted in the polar regions and provide scientists with state-of-the-art facilities to research the oceans, seafloor, ice and atmosphere. The vessel departs the UK annually in October and is currently in the Antarctic for it’s first big season of science. It returns to the UK variably June to July depending upon Arctic science campaigns and operational requirements in Antarctica.\n\nThe SDA is supported by a BASMU doctor that deploys for approximately 9 months.\n\nBack to top of page\n\nThe BAS Medical Unit\n\nThe BAS Medical Unit was transferred to Plymouth Hospitals NHS Trust, centred at Derriford Hospital. in early 1997. BASMU works closely with the Diving Diseases Research Centre, Peninsula Medical and Dental School, Plymouth University and the Southwest Ambulance Service Trust to provide an integrated system of health care. This includes:\n\nPre-employment medical examinations for all personnel in order to establish medical fitness to work in or visit the Antarctic.\n\nRecruitment and preparation of medical staff to work on the Antarctic stations and the ships.\n\nMedical training for non-medical personnel.\n\nEmergency and other less urgent specialist and routine back up in Plymouth for medical staff working in the Antarctic, via voice and email satellite communications.\n\nDetermining requirements for, and the supply of, medical supplies and equipment for use on the stations, ship, for field parties, aircraft and emergency stores.\n\nSupervision of research projects undertaken by medical staff.\n\nAn overall advisory role, including development, on all medical matters relating to BAS activities.\n\nBack to top of page\n\nAppointment of Medical Officers\n\nDoctors are required for Rothera and South Georgia overwintering, plus summer only posts at Halley and on the ship RRS Sir David Attenborough (SDA).\n\nThe doctor is responsible for all aspects of medical care and should be prepared to meet emergencies arising from both injury and illness. The total medical workload is unlikely to be onerous because of the small “patient population”, each member of which is assessed as medically fit for service in the South. However, taxing medical problems can be present. The doctor has consultant medical advice available from Plymouth. The ship and bases are equipped to meet a wide range of medical conditions. There may be requirement to serve as ship’s doctor (though on occasions doctor cover for the ship will also be required in part independent from that provided by the over-wintering doctors whilst travelling to and from the Antarctic).\n\nAppointees must be GMC registered, preferably with Accident and Emergency experience, but could be recently registered or at any stage of vocational training or established practice. In past years the majority of those who get to interview tend to be about 3-4 years or more post qualification. Applicants should be physically fit.\n\nMedical Officer Posts are advertised in the British Medical Journal and Doctors.org website in August each year. A short list for selection interviews is prepared immediately after the closing date. Interviews are usually scheduled for late October / early November for appointments commencing May the following year. Some 6 months medical and research preparation is undertaken, based principally in Plymouth, before departure for the Antarctic.\n\nMedical Preparation\n\nThe main drive of the medical programme is to prepare for an effective role in what are usually specialist fields, e.g., anaesthesia, radiography and processing, dentistry and diving medicine, relating preparation to the equipment held in the South. Additionally, and depending on individual background, the opportunity is available to gain further experience in, e.g. A&E, ENT and Dermatology, by attending principally outpatient departments.\n\nResearch\n\nResearch is allocated and supervised when projects become feasible, appropriate and possible in consideration of the small remote cohort of subjects. Thoughts on studies from individual doctors are welcomed and considered.\n\nA number of smaller, short term or pilot studies are being conducted. This work has practical significance not only for BAS personnel, but for those who work in other remote sites. This aspect must be considered alongside the very small population we deal with thus certain aspects of research and proposals may not be acceptable.\n\nMedical\n\nAll consultations on bases and ships are placed on a computerised database. Subsequent analysis determines the nature of medical events and how they are dealt with. This information is important in the development of the medical training programmes, in determining any requirement for changes in the standards of fitness for Antarctic service and in guiding judgements on the nature and quantities of equipment and drugs which need to be provided.\n\nSmaller, Short Term or Pilot Studies\n\nPrevious studies have included:\n\nMicrobial testing of water supplies\n\nThe effect of an Antarctic tour on aspects of health\n\nSeal bite treatment\n\nUltra-violet light exposure\n\nCarbon monoxide levels in tents during field trips\n\nStudies into the validation of psychometric tests for selection of Antarctic personnel.\n\nAnalogue studies related to long distance space flight in collaboration with ESA.\n\nCOVID studies\n\nThe doctors participate in a two-week residential conference held in Cambridge in early September for all pre-tour South personnel. The first week give an introduction to the Antarctic and to BAS and its work and the second week is devoted to a medical training programme.\n\nFurther medical training is provided on Dartmoor for a week in late September to a small group of BAS staff and recruited/seconded doctors to provide context to field medical & SAR requirements.\n\nDoctors have the opportunity to gain a Certificate, Diploma or MSc in Remote and Global Health Care from the Peninsula Medical School through their work at BASMU or may elect to undertake another approved Post Graduate qualification that is delivered by distance learning methods.\n\nThe opportunity to disembark in South America and return to the UK “the long way home” is subject to ships’ itineraries and operational requirements.\n\nIt may not be possible to accommodate any preference for appointment to a particular base, and it may be necessary, even at short notice, to change the intended wintering location. These changes to deployment have been exercised a number of times in the past few years for various reasons.\n\nAny queries may be addressed to:\n\nDr Matt Warner, Medical Director, Matt.warner1@nhs.net\n\nMike Dinn, Business Manager, Mike.dinn@nhs.net"
