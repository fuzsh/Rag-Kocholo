        "text": "For some movies, the hype building up to their release isn’t based on its stars or director or plot, but by the boutique company putting it out to the public. Think A24. Think Laika. Think Blumhouse, the production org that’s become synonymous in horror with low budgets, big returns, and bigger thrills.\n\nOver the past two decades, magnate of monstrosity Jason Blum — who has also produced plenty of “normal” movies — has banked his legacy on reinventing how horror scripts are discovered and made, keeping the genre from going stale, like it infamously did in the ’90s. After all, blood dries quickly; gotta keep it fresh. Look to franchises like The Purge, Paranormal Activity, and Insidious: when you watch one Blumhouse horror movie, you’re probably gonna seek out what else they’re up to.\n\nBlumhouse had a very busy 2022 with The Black Phone, They/Them, Halloween Ends, and Nanny among their major releases. And they kick off 2023 with a dolled-up bang with M3GAN, their best-reviewed horror movie since Get Out. Since then, we’ve added Sick, Insidious: The Red Door, Totally Killer, and The Exorcist: Believer, and Five Nights at Freddy’s.\n\nWith 2024, they’ve released Imaginary, and have Speak No Evil and Leigh Whannell’s take on the Wolf Man coming up.\n\nNow, we’re ranking all Blumhouse horror movies by Tomatometer, with Certified Fresh films first!\n\n#1\n\nGet Out (2017) 98%\n\n#1\n\nAdjusted Score: 120618%\n\nCritics Consensus: Funny, scary, and thought-provoking, Get Out seamlessly weaves its trenchant social critiques into a brilliantly effective and entertaining horror/comedy thrill ride.\n\nSynopsis: Now that Chris and his girlfriend, Rose, have reached the meet-the-parents milestone of dating, she invites him for a weekend... [More]\n\nDirected By: Jordan Peele\n\n#2\n\nM3GAN (2022) 93%\n\n#2\n\nAdjusted Score: 110621%\n\nCritics Consensus: Unapologetically silly and all the more entertaining for it, M3GAN is the rare horror-comedy that delivers chuckles as effortlessly as chills.\n\nSynopsis: M3GAN is a marvel of artificial intelligence, a life-like doll programmed to be a child's greatest companion and a parent's... [More]\n\nDirected By: Gerard Johnstone\n\n#3\n\nCam (2018) 93%\n\n#3\n\nAdjusted Score: 97975%\n\nCritics Consensus: Smart and suspenseful, CAM is a techno-thriller that's far more than the sum of its salacious parts -- and an outstanding showcase for Madeline Brewer in the leading role.\n\nSynopsis: A camgirl has her principles, until a mysterious woman who looks just like her takes over her channel.... [More]\n\nDirected By: Daniel Goldhaber\n\n#4\n\nHush (2016) 93%\n\n#4\n\nAdjusted Score: 94201%\n\nCritics Consensus: Hush navigates the bloody waters of home invasion thrillers and incisive slashers for a contemporary horror puree.\n\nSynopsis: A deaf woman is stalked by a killer in her home.... [More]\n\nDirected By: Mike Flanagan\n\n#5\n\nSweetheart (2019) 93%\n\n#5\n\nAdjusted Score: 94227%\n\nCritics Consensus: Carried by Kiersey Clemons' performance, Sweetheart balances smart subtext and social commentary against effective genre thrills.\n\nSynopsis: A shipwreck survivor on an uninhabited island must fend off a malevolent force that surfaces each night.... [More]\n\nDirected By: J.D. Dillard\n\n#6\n\nThe Invisible Man (2020) 92%\n\n#6\n\nAdjusted Score: 117076%\n\nCritics Consensus: Smart, well-acted, and above all scary, The Invisible Man proves that sometimes, the classic source material for a fresh reboot can be hiding in plain sight.\n\nSynopsis: After staging his own suicide, a crazed scientist uses his power to become invisible to stalk and terrorize his ex-girlfriend.... [More]\n\nDirected By: Leigh Whannell\n\n#7\n\nThe Vigil (2019) 90%\n\n#7\n\nAdjusted Score: 95624%\n\nCritics Consensus: Consistently clever and creepy, The Vigil mines richly atmospheric supernatural horror from a deep well of religious traditions.\n\nSynopsis: Steeped in ancient Jewish lore and demonology, THE VIGIL is a supernatural horror film set over the course of a...
