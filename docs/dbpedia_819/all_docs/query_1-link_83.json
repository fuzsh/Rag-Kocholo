        "text": "Now in its second edition, this highly practical reference focuses on specific technical aspects of planning and delivery of radiation treatment for all major malignancies. Pocket-sized for on-the-go reference, it has been updated and expanded to embrace new technology that has become part of routine practice. The Handbook combines evidence-based information with knowledge gained by practitioners and represents a joint collaboration between residents and staff radiation oncologists in the Department of Radiation Oncology at the Cleveland Clinic. Information is organized by body site or system and also includes such specialized topics as palliative therapy and pediatrics. Following a discussion of general planning requirements, each specific sub-site provides more details on approaches to radiotherapy planning. More than 200 images support the text discussion. The Handbook will be a valuable tool for every radiation oncology practitioner or trainee. · new to the second edition: ■ Presents updated coverage of stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) for prostate and GI tumors ■ Includes new information about intraoperative therapy for GI tumors ■ Expands upon volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT) for brain tumors ■ Provides new coverage of MRI-based planning in simulation Recommended Shelving Category: Oncology"
