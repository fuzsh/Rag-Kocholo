Our soldiers, led by professional and trusted leaders, are physically and mentally prepared to meet the rigours of military operations.\n\nRegular Force\n\nOur full-time Regular Force personnel fill a wide variety of ranks and roles: Privates to Generals, technicians to special operations troops, intelligence specialists to medics. Our people are trained in skills specific to their trade as well as military skills applicable to their role such as planning, leadership and command. They serve on and support operational deployments and training, both in New Zealand and around the world.\n\nReserves\n\nOur Reserves provide extra depth and diversity by working and training with us part-time. Reserves complement our Regular Force by providing additional capacity and expertise, ready to respond to events in New Zealand and overseas.\n\nCivilian personnel\n\nCivilian employees fill a wide range of specialist and corporate roles that do not require deployment to an operational environment. The work they do is essential to our Army."
