        "text": "An Army officer assigned to the Defense Logistics Agency Troop Support was promoted to lieutenant colonel during a ceremony in Philadelphia Jan. 19.\n\nLt. Col. Corinne Bell is the future operations chief in DLA Troop Support’s Customer Operations directorate.\n\n“Today is a great day for the Army, DLA and the Bell family celebrating your promotion to lieutenant colonel,” said Brig. Gen. Mark Simerly, DLA Troop Support commander, who officiated the ceremony. “These accomplishments can’t be done without the unwavering support of family.”\n\nBell’s family has strong military ties. Her father is a retired Army officer and her sister is an Army officer currently deployed. She watched the ceremony via video teleconference.\n\n“You’re a well-rounded combat leader who’s proven in some of the harshest environments, continually seeks self-improvement and pushes others to do the same,” Simerly said. “You love your family and nation, and I look forward to seeing many more great things from you.”\n\nBell, a Gloucester, Virginia native, thanked those in attendance for supporting her throughout her 16-year career.\n\n“I stand proud knowing I’m here because of the support from my family and colleagues,” Bell said. “I’m grateful and humble knowing that I can always count on you.”\n\nBell also thanked her parents and husband for who she is today.\n\n“Thank you for your sacrifices, showing me the value of pride and giving me strength to leave the nest,” Bell said. “To my husband, I value and love you more than you’ll ever know.”"
