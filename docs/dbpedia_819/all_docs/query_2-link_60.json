        "text": "It is difficult to imagine what life was like in Muscat and Oman during the 1950s. This beautiful desert country was nominally ruled over by the despotic Sultan Said Bin Taimur who really did not believe in progress. In 1955, the country had just ten miles of tarmac road and no schools or medical facilities. The health of the population of 750,000 was terrible and illiteracy was very high at about 95%. The Sultan saw no reason to spend any of the revenues he made from customs duties to improve matters. This resistance to change would eventually see the old Sultan replaced in a bloodless coup by his son Qaboos bin Said, but that would not be for another twenty years.\n\nIn the meantime, the Sultan’s writ did not run particularly large outside the two main population centres of Muscat in the north of the country and Salalah in the far south. In fact, the country was effectively split in two. Said Bin Taimur ruled as The Sultan of Muscat whilst the interior of the country was known as the Imamate of Oman and ruled over by an Imam from the desert city of Nizwa. The dividing line between these two areas of control was a mountain plateau dominated by The Green Mountain or Jebel Akhdar. Until 1954 these two rulers existed in a state of mutual co-existence. This was mainly because the old Imam was a fairly benign ruler who believed in “live and let live”. All that would change when he died in that year. Technically, this was all one country known as The Sultanate of Muscat and Oman.\n\nThis incursion sparked a confrontation between a small contingent of Trucial Oman Levies (a predominantly arab fighting force led by British officers later known as Trucial Oman Scouts) who were protecting Patrick Stobart, the British political officer. Outnumbered by the Saudi contingent, Stobart’s guards were disarmed and he was briefly detained. The British Government complained strongly about this to Saudi Arabia. However, King Abdul Aziz Al Saud, the founder and ruler of Saudi Arabia gave this short shrift. No doubt he regarded British “interference” in the affairs of the Gulf Arab nations to be an impertinence. For its part, Britain would cite the fact that it was upholding the Treaties it had signed with Abu Dhabi and Oman to protect and support them.\n\nThe Saudis claimed that the Buraimi oasis was theirs since the Wahabis had occupied it in the nineteenth century. They were a strict Islamic sect who originated in Saudi Arabia and remained the power behind the Saudi throne from the 19th and into 20th Century. In reality, their tenure in Buraimi was fleeting at best with intermittent occupations of the oasis between 1800 and 1869 when they were finally evicted by the Sultan of Oman. In the tense and uneasy period of peace that followed, the Saudis extended their land claims to include a large part of the neighbouring sheikdom of Abu Dhabi.\n\nThen on 31st August 1952 the Saudis invaded the Buraimi Oasis occupying the Omani village of Hamasa. Their force which numbered about eighty men, forty of whom were armed, was led by Turki bin Abdullah Al Otaishan, the Emir of Ras Tanura, a city in the Eastern Province of Saudi Arabia He lost no time in spreading Saudi largesse in the form of clothes, money and other supplies amongst the impoverished locals. He won over the loyalty of one of the local sheikhs and his tribe. At a feast in this sheikh’s village, he declared himself the new Governor of Buraimi and protector of its tribes.\n\nIn a rare display of co-operation, Said bin Taimur and the Imam of the Oman Imamate raised an army of about 8000 tribesmen and made ready to march on Buraimi from the coastal town of Sohar. Had they been allowed to do this, the Omanis would have undoubtedly evicted the Saudi force from Buraimi in short order. Unfortunately, the British decided it was better to negotiate with the Saudis and pressured the Sultan to stand down his tribal army. Many consider this to have been a mistaken strategy since it not only prolonged the crisis but involved severe loss of face by Said Bin Taimur amongst the local tribes. This was no small matter in Gulf arab society.\n\nIn response to this, a MOFF force took the towns of Adam and Ibri. On 15th December they went a crucial step further by taking the Imamate capital of Nizwa. The M.O.F.F. under the command of a British officer, Lt Colonel Colin Maxwell also laid siege to the nearby fortress town of Rustaq whose Wali (leader) was Ghalib’s younger brother and close ally Talib bin Ali. The fort fell after a determined defence with Talib escaping into exile in Saudi Arabia.\n\nOnce there, he sought financial support from the Kingdom and other friendly regimes to carry on the fight against Sultan Said Bin Taimur. His efforts were undoubtedly successful with both the conservative Saudi Arabian and revolutionary Egyptian regimes backing the Imamate in an unholy alliance. A man of great charisma and drive, Talib also successfully raised a fighting force of about three hundred Omani expatriates whom he would lead back to Oman. However, with the Sultan’s flag fluttering over the great fort of Nizwa, it seemed that Ghalib’s revolt had been crushed almost before it began.\n\nTo set the seal on his domination of the Interior, Said Bin Taimur travelled from his southern city of Salalah to Nizwa, five hundred and fifty miles to the north. His convoy of trucks with its huge dust cloud must have been quite a sight as it tore across the desert. Once there, he took the oaths of loyalty of the local tribal leaders and declared the Imamate dead and buried. Appearing to accept this fait accomplis, Ghalib abdicated as the Imam and retired to his tribal base in the mountain village of Bilad Sait. His long term ally Suleiman Bin Hamyar climbed into his Chevrolet convertible (a gift from the Saudis) and retired to his town of Tanuf. There, he would resume his questionable style of autocratic rule over the tribespeople within his fiefdom surrounding Tanuf. This included travelling around local villages demanding, as their sheikh and Lord of The Green Mountain, to sleep with any wife or daughter that took his fancy.\n\nIn another ambush near Tanuf a vehicle carrying wounded from the fighting was fired on by some of Suleiman bin Hamyar’s fighters causing further deaths amongst the Sultan’s forces. Only a fraction of the Sultan’s Regiment made it back to Muscat. In fact, the Regiment was so depleted it had to be disbanded. With Ghalib’s white flag (not one of surrender) flying over Nizwa once again and Bahla Fort back in his hands, the battle of Bilad Sait had been a major victory for the rebels and a shattering defeat for the Sultan.\n\nOne question about this action which stands out is why the Ibriyid tribe failed to man the heights. It is tempting to think this was a simple case of treachery. Had this tribe changed sides or been in league with Talib bin Ali all along? Whilst there is no answer to this, the fact that the British would use the Ibriyid in operations again indicates its tribesmen were simply unreliable rather than treacherous.\n\nBy the end of 1957, Sultan Said Bin Taimur was in a very perilous situation. His weak and ill equipped armed forces were in no shape to confront rebel army of the Imamate. The Sultan’s forces numbered 720 men. 120 of these were a ceremonial palace guard. This tiny army was comprised mainly of Balushis from Pakistan, whilst their officers were British. On the other hand, the Imamate forces numbered about a thousand fighters backed up by thousands of irregular fighters from the towns and villages in the Omani interior. Most were highly motivated and skilled fighters who were also well armed, thanks to their Egyptian and Saudi backers. In addition to this, both Ghalib and Talib bin Ali were inspirational leaders well respected both by their men and the local community.\n\nFollowing the Suez debacle, Britain was in diplomatic, political and military retreat throughout the Middle East at this time. With the forces of arab nationalism and anti-colonialism in the ascendant, not many observers would have bet on the survival of weak backward states such as Sultan bin Taimur’s in Muscat. Without the support of a strong military power, Oman could well have fallen under the control of an anti-western regime. Had this happened, the Arabian Gulf with its strategic oil reserves and coastline would have been very different to what it is today.\n\nFortunately, the British Government did not throw in the towel when asked for help by Sultan Said Bin Taimur. On 16th July 1957, citing a treaty of friendship signed with the United Kingdom in the 1940s, the Sultan formerly asked Britain for help. She responded rapidly and British forces including the Cameronian Regiment and RAF fighters and bombers were placed at his disposal. In the summer of 1958, this assistance force with the strengthened and reformed Sultan’s Armed Forces took the battle for Oman to the Imamate forces of the Bin Ali brothers.\n\nIt would not be an easy fight. How much the air support provided by RAF Venom jets helped turn the tide of war is still a matter of debate. In twelve missions, Venoms rocketed the rebel forts at Izki, Nizwa, Tanuf and Birkat Al Mawz. In the mid 1980s damage from these raids could still be seen on the walls of Nizwa Fort. Tanuf, the seat of Suleiman Bin Hamyar (The Man with the Chevrolet), was left in ruins which can still be seen today.\n\nWhen Nizwa finally fell, Ghalib, his brother Talib and their followers made good their escape. They holed up in the caves of the mountain fastness of the Jebel Akhdar where they proved impossible to dislodge.\n\nFor the next two years, the rebel forces of the Bin Ali brothers fought a guerilla campaign from their base in the Jebel Akhdar. This consisted mainly of mining local roads and attacking SAF and oil company vehicles. In spite of the best efforts of the Sultan’s forces, supplies of money and mines continued to make it through to the rebels. The arms flowed in from Saudi Arabia by boat through Sharjah and then by truck to Jebel Akhdar. There, they were carried by hardy and long suffering local donkeys up the mountain to the rebel base. The variety of these arms was also formidable and included mortars, heavy machine guns, anti aircraft guns and mines. Out of all this weaponry, it was the mines that did the most damage. Between March and November 1958, 150 vehicles were damaged by mines. These included 18 Ferret armoured cars and 100 oil company vehicles. This threatened to halt the drilling at the new Fahud oil field.\n\nThe mines that were causing this havoc were sold to the Saudis by the Americans. In view of this, the Macmillan Government asked the U.S. Government if they would cease these sales. The British were firmly rebuffed by the Americans on the grounds this was a commercial contract that could not be broken. This must have been one of the occasions in recent history that a British Government questioned whether the ‘Special Relationship’ with the U.S. Government really existed or was just a sentimental myth.\n\nSmiley had served with distinction throughout the Second World War in a variety of roles and locations. As a captain in 52 Commando, he saw service behind the lines in Abyssinia (Ethiopia). Following that he fought the Vichy French in Syria. In 1943, he was recruited into the Special Operations Executive. It was in this role that he undertook his most hazardous missions being parachuted into occupied Albania twice to co-ordinate non-communist partisan operations against the Italians and Germans. It was here that he met Amery. For his work in Albania he was awarded the Military Cross and Bar (effectively a second military cross).\n\nHe worked closely with General Sir Frank Kitson and Lieutenant Anthony Deane-Drummond who commanded the detachment of 22 SAS Regiment in Oman. He was another soldier with a formidable reputation. During the Second World War, he was captured and escaped no less than three times. On the third occasion, after escaping captivity by the Germans at Arnhem, he hid in a wardrobe for thirteen days in the same house as German troops before escaping back to British lines. His formidable reputation as a leader of men came with him when he joined the SAS.\n\nThe three officers concluded that it would require two squadrons of SAS, a total of 160 men to take the Jebel. These soldiers of the legendary special service regiment were transferred from the steamy jungles of Malaya to Oman in an RAF Beverley transport aircraft. There they would take part in one of the most remarkable feats of arms in the Regiment’s history.\n\nIn Malaya, the dense jungle environment had limited visibility of twenty-five yards or less. This was further hampered by the jungle canopy cutting out any direct sunlight. In Oman, the SAS troops had to deal with the entirely opposite problem of visibility extending for up to 30 miles. This greatly aided the fearless mountain fighters who were now their enemy. They were excellent shots who could pick off a target often at great distances. This meant that any attack on the rebel stronghold would have to be done at night. After arriving from Malaya, the SAS squadrons spent some weeks in training and acclimatization for combat in this entirely new environment. After initial training in the Muscat area, they then moved to Tanuf and the area adjacent to Jebel Akhdar. The SAS soon developed a healthy respect for their enemy when one of their corporals, Douglas Swindell was fatally shot by a long-distance sniper in November 1958.\n\nThe constraints of time on this operation were acute. Because the Middle East including the matter of the war in Oman was due to be discussed at the UN General Assembly in April 1959, the rebels had to be defeated by then. For domestic political reasons, casualties also had to be kept to a minimum. Of course, no British overseas military action would be complete without the dimwitted interference by out of touch officials or politicians in London. This operation was no exception to this rule.\n\nA request was made to London for funds to purchase local donkeys to carry the SAS’ supplies and weaponry up the Jebel. London baulked at the cost of £40 per donkey and authorized the purchase of donkeys from Somaliland at £2 per beast. The result was that the forces in Oman received weak and flea-bitten animals that were incapable of carrying heavy loads up narrow mountain paths unlike the Omani donkeys. This prompted the comment from one of the soldiers involved that they had to carry the donkeys instead of those animals carrying their supplies and weaponry.\n\nSmiley decamped from Muscat to Nizwa where a communications centre had been established to oversee the operation. Between the months of July to December 1958 there was heavy fighting between the British backed Sultan’s forces and the rebels. The RAF were also involved with air strikes. In the last week of December, there was particularly heavy fighting on the mountain itself between the rebels and the SAS.\n\nThe decisive assault on the southern side of Jebel Akhdar was set for the night of 25th January 1958. As a feint, all the donkey drivers were gathered together by the British. They were told under conditions of great secrecy that an attack on the northern side of the Jebel would take place on 25th January. Word rapidly got back to Talib Bin Ali who was tricked into believing this ‘attack’ was genuine. As a result he concentrated most of his forces on that area.\n\nWith each man carrying eighty pounds of kit, the SAS force embarked on the gruelling task of scaling the Jebel Akhdar. It was an operation that carried a high level of risk. Had they got their timing wrong or Talib had not been fooled they could well have faced the guns of the enemy on the lip of the plateau. These would have been considerable including .303 Lee Enfield rifles, light and heavy machine guns and mortars.\n\nThey also faced a formidable enemy force of about twelve hundred and fifty hardened fighters. The SAS troops were backed up by a combined force of the Sultan’s regular troops including The Northern Frontier Regiment, The Muscat Regiment and the Trucial Scots. In addition to this, two hundred Ibrayid tribesmen were called in to provide a diversion on the North side of the Jebel. Since this was the same tribe who had failed to show up during the battle of Bilad Sait, a question mark hung over their reliability in this operation.\n\nDuring this night time operation, little opposition was encountered as the troops worked their way up the few narrow paths that led to the Jebel Akhdar plateau. At one stage, the SAS led by Major Watts, found it necessary to complete their journey by climbing the rock face of the Jebel. This meant jettisoning their rucksacks. However, it proved to be crucial to the success of the operation.\n\nJust before dawn, the SAS force reached the edge of the plateau and stormed it. The rebel forces were taken completely by surprise and scattered with barely a shot being fired. A wealth of material and information was found in the deserted cave that was Talib bin Ali’s H.Q. However, there was no sign of the three rebel leaders Ghalib and Talib bin Ali or Suleiman bin Hamyar. They had slipped away into the depths of the Omani interior. It took until 30th January of mopping up and securing various rebel hideouts to finally declare the Jebel to be in the hands of the Sultan’s Forces. After four and a half long years, The Jebel Akhdar War was finally over.\n\nA fortnight after the successful operation, the British received reliable information that the three rebel leaders were hiding out in a house in a certain location in the Omani Interior. An operation was quickly planned to surround the building and take the three rebels prisoner. The commanding officer of The Sultan’s Northern Frontier Regiment was ordered not to interfere with this operation in any way. However, for reasons better known to himself, he ignored the order and embarked on a ham fisted attempt to capture the fugitives himself.\n\nHe knocked on the door and asked the owner of the house if the Imam was in. When the answer was no, he simply took this at face value and left. Reputedly, when Talib bin Ali who was hiding in the house asked Bin Hamyar if he should shoot “the stupid infidel”, the latter replied “No, he’s not worth it.” Amen to that. The three leaders then escaped to exile in Saudi Arabia never to be apprehended.\n\nIn conclusion, this was undoubtedly a ‘small’ war. However, if Sultan Bin Taimur had lost, it could have had serious implications for Britain and the West. In that case, the Imamate of the Omani interior, would probably have been absorbed into a separate anti-western state. The precious oil reserves at Fahud would have been fallen into ‘unfriendly hands’. The strategic coastline on the Straits of Hormuz would also have been up for grabs. This would have threatened Britain and the West’s access to a large part of the world’s oil.\n\nFortunately, thanks mainly to British military support, this did not happen. With the rebel forces defeated, the threat of the Imamate seceding no longer existed. Muscat and Oman had been drawn closer together as one country. However, this would prove to be a temporary reprieve as a far more serious danger to Oman’s survival and stability appeared on the horizon."
