        "text": "His mother Moira: “Although Kyle was killed at the tender age of 21, he felt that earning his maroon beret and becoming a Para was an amazing personal triumph. Kyle had the most amazing smile, even his eyes smiled.\"\n\nHis father John, himself an ex-soldier: “He just wanted to be in the field, he kept saying ‘I just want to be out on patrol’.\n\n“I was the last person in the family to speak to him. He phoned about 12 o'clock at night, he said he was excited about the patrol. I spoke to him for about 20 minutes, he asked about the family, I said the family were OK and I said, ‘It's OK son’ and I said, ‘remember your Dad is always beside you’.”\n\n“He was always an outdoor boy, that's what he wanted - he couldn’t work in an office. Almost from the moment he could walk he wanted to be a cricket player. Later, he was taken on a day course to live the Army life. As soon as he saw that, that was him. But it had to be the Parachute Regiment - he only wanted to be a Paratrooper.\n\n“One thing I will always remember is that when he was home on his last R&R, he came up to me and said: ‘Dad, I’m not a soldier, I’m a Para’.\n\n“They are very, very together. They are very tight-knit. That’s what Kyle liked. He loved his family - his sisters Jacqueline and Dawn, his grandparents and his uncle Ken - and he adored his girlfriend, Charlene, but when he came home he wanted to be with his friends too, he loved his Regiment.”\n\n“Was I worried? I didn't let him know it because that's the worst thing you can do. We were all worried but we gave him our blessing.\n\n“When you meet the other families you look at each other and think, our sons are the true heroes. The word hero is used far, far too easily but these boys who put their lives on the line for us, to keep us safe, they are the real heroes.”\n\nHis friend Capt Helen Stamp: \"Since losing Ben five years ago, life has been a duller place. Ben was tragically killed in a helicopter crash whilst serving his country. The last memory I have of him is a phone call from Afghanistan where he was in a particularly upbeat and positive mood. Predictably everything Ben did was filled with positivity, and he could be relied upon to find amusement in everything we did in the Army.\n\n\"My two years spent with him on basic training were the best of times. Whether it was passing notes to each other in class, discussing 'what happened at the weekend' or trudging through the night on patrol, he would always find a way to lighten the mood. His zest for life was infectious, and I remember a particularly amusing ski trip to Les Deux Alpes in France where he decided that we should wear our best Officers Mess Kit on the ski slopes to celebrate the start of 2007. We drew many looks from confused skiers, but as ever he carried it off with the greatest of ease. We loved this ski trip so much, especially the local crepes, that we spent the next month discussing how we would escape from training to drive down to France to pick up takeaway crepes. All of this seemed to be within our grasp: although to most would have been a ridiculous idea, I, and many others, would have followed Ben anywhere.\n\n\"A consummate professional and undeniably charismatic leader, he was the epitome of what a modern day Army Officer should be. Fiercely intelligent and supportive, he was a loyal and utterly dependable friend. He approached each day with a determination that it would be a great day, finding hilarity in all that was thrown at him. On that tragic day in July 2009, I lost a best friend, and the world lost a character. He is an example to us all of what can be achieved in such a short space of time. He is missed every day by those that knew him but the memories never fade.\"\n\nHis father Stephen: \"David was just a fun-loving guy, he loved sports, either playing football or [watching] QPR. He seemed to make friends in all walks of life and just had that knack of getting on with people. I just remember one moment at the funeral – one of his friends said he is the sort of guy who could make a friend in an empty room.\n\n\"We hold a football tournament in his memory each year. This year it was on Sunday, October 12 in his memory and there were 500 people who showed up. There must have been 35 or so soldiers who, four years after his death, turned up for the first time. That summed it up to us.\n\n\"It is mainly local friends but a good number of soldiers and the amount of emails we get apologising they can’t make it this year but will come next year… If he had told me he had this many friends before he died, I wouldn’t have believed him.\n\n\"We have found it difficult to put it on every year, but we will carry on doing it as long as they keep coming and his friends still want to do it. We have made friends from all walks of life. They all just turn up for this football each year and it is brilliant.\n\n\"The other nice thing for us is that a lot of the Army friends who come over seem to interact with the local guys from Tring, so a lot of people have met up because of him, and that started when he first came back from Wootton Bassett. The crowds that were down there – I do remember the pub saying they did not recall seeing such big crowds for just one soldier. I miss him from the football side because we used to go and watch QPR every time he was on leave – I don’t go now, it just doesn’t feel the same without him. I’ve been with my wife and she said, 'This is just wrong, David should be here'. I’m sure I will start watching them again but at the moment it still feels so close.\"\n\nHis widow Sue: “It was about six weeks after they had gone out. It was a Saturday and a guy knocked on the door and showed me his ID badge, and he just told me.\n\n\"I had just been talking to him two nights before. It was really surreal. I just didn’t believe it, not for quite a while. I knew deep down he was not going to come back but it was a strange few months. Even now I still talk about him and think about his little quirks, and have a laugh or cry. It depends how you are feeling on the day, but it has definitely got better over time. Some things still make you upset, especially the Remembrance Services, and every time you hear Last Post.\n\n“We used to go out on the tandem bike quite a bit, we went to France and tandemed around 200 miles. He would sit at the front, always. He did the gears and everything. Our feet were clipped into the pedals so you couldn’t slack off. I did do that a few times and he’d say, ‘Come on, you’re not working hard enough!’. Now it is all covered in cobwebs. I used to cycle to work but it has dropped off considerably because it was his influence that helped me get outside – one thing he really loved was to be outdoors.\n\n“In 2011, family and friends set up a charity group called Willberforce and we’ve done various things, mainly quite extreme events like Tough Mudder, collecting money for Help for Heroes, which was one of his favourite charities. It seems to get more extreme and madder every year, but it’s got to be because it’s in memory of Will, so it has to be outdoors and as extreme as we can find – that’s what he did.”\n\nHis father Martin: \"Following his graduation in 2009, David entered the Royal Military Academy at Sandhurst. He received his Commission in August 2010 and joined the elite 1st The Queen's Dragoon Guards. He immediately made his mark on the Regiment. The many citations from his troop and fellow officers show how much he was respected and admired as a leader. It's then-Commanding Officer said of him: 'Lt David Boyce was a charming young officer who, quite simply, represented everything that is great about the Regiment and British Army. He led from the front, setting the very highest standards, and inspired his men and peers alike. The Regiment has been denied one of our best, and a professional commander for the future has been taken from us'.\n\n\"Even as a young boy, David was warm and gregarious and it was clear that he was a born leader. Whatever he did, he would dedicate himself to it and encourage everyone else with him to do the same. That was his nature: confidence in his own abilites and steadfast in his determination to succeed. His loss leaves an enormous void in our lives. There will always be an empty seat at the table. Yet his love of life and laughter brings sunshine into our lives every day. We can't think about Dave and not smile; smile at one of the many anecdotes or stories that surrounded him throughout his life.\n\n\"A recent tribute from one of his fellow officers in the QDG still serving in Afghanistan describes this perfectly: 'Dave, the personification of never letting the truth get in the way of a good story.' All our lives are enriched through knowing Dave. He brought laughter to everything we did and enjoyment to the lives of all those he met. Never letting anything hinder a good time, Dave made so many friends by his generous nature and charming character. Always willing to go the extra yard for his friends he will never be forgotten, and will remain a part of us all forever.\n\n\"'Boycey' will always be remembered for his pure passion for life. Those who knew and loved him feel his tragic loss sorely, but we take pride and comfort in knowing that David died doing a job he truly loved, surrounded by men who loved and who respected him.\"\n\nHis father Stephen: \"Not even a day goes by without Jim coming to my mind but it does make it easier knowing he was doing what he wanted to do. For that year-and-a-half in the Army, I could see what it meant to him. It was such a joy to behold.\n\n\"If he could speak to me now he would say, ‘Dad, I can't believe I didn't get the chance to do one full tour’. [He had been in Afghanistan for less than two weeks on his first tour]. That would devastate him. He would feel he'd let people down. But you can't give any more than your life.\n\n\"Their bravery stands out a mile. I have spoken to David Kirkness’s mum [L/Cpl David Kirkness died alongside James] and she said there are so many similarities between them. James would have been so proud to have been with him.\n\n“James was indestructible when he was a boy. I remember when he was one-and-a-half and he fell out of a window. It was a 12ft drop. I was out at the time and when I got the call my legs went to jelly. The air ambulance came and took him to hospital. But he came back about two hours later and they said there was nothing wrong with him. There's still a crack in the paving slab where he fell.\n\n“We went out to play snooker the night before James left. The dad of his best mate asked him ‘what happens if the worst comes to the worst and you lose arms or legs?’ James said, ‘I will just get myself a new pair’ - that was his mindset.\n\n“I remember the last time I saw him. I dropped him at the station and as he got out I said, 'Look after yourself' and shook his hand. I wished I'd given him a cuddle. His funeral was amazing. What the British Legion did was unbelievable. Shops closed for an hour. I had no idea what it was going to be like.\n\n“We walked behind the coffin... you just don't expect what we saw that day.\"\n\nHis parents Gordon and Susan: \"To try and capture David’s personality, character and what he meant to us is so very difficult and personal. David came into this world on May 31, 1990, and grew up surrounded by love with his older brothers Gareth and Mark. When he left school he went onto further education and began training as a motor mechanic and although he enjoyed this, his heart was not in it. He followed his older brother Gary into the military.\n\n\"We were very proud when David left home for the Royal Irish Regiment Training Centre, Cattrick, in January 2010. In phone calls home, he talked a lot about the training, but more about the great friendships he had forged. A week before his passing out he had phoned us and laughed that he was glad he hadn’t joined the Royal Scots as it was easier to iron a pair of trousers than a kilt.\n\n\"David passed out on July 24, 2010, and it was with immense pride, joy and tears that we, his brother Mark and David’s best friend watched him, march off the square. We learned that David would deploy with his Regiment to Afghanistan in September. We were worried, of course, about his deployment: we had an older son, Gareth, who had completed two tours of Iraq and was currently in Afghanistan, and, not understanding the logistics, we made Gareth promise to 'pop over and check on David'. David's phone calls home brightened up our days. We were told after that David would always leave the welfare phone back drained of battery.\n\n\"David came home on leave November 2010, and we saw a change in him. We had sent the military our youngest precious son and he had returned a well-grounded young man. We had planned an early Christmas for David; it was our last Christmas with our son.\n\n\"It has been three years nine months since our world crashed. On February 4, 2011, at 06:59 David was fatally shot. So began the roller-coaster of emotion. On February 10, he was repatriated to Wootten Bassett. With the help of Lady Silvia Hermon MP, we were allowed to see our son at Bristol Hospital on February 11 and for that we are eternally grateful. He looked beautiful, perfect.\n\n\"David returned home to us on February 15, his funeral was on February 18, 2011; it was a military funeral carried out with professionalism and dignity, his brother Gareth was part of the Military Bearer Party. On April 11, we met with S.I.B., we had a full, frank and sometimes brutal briefing but we learned how David died. On April 23 we met with the Rev Andrew Totten (Padre 1 Royal Irish Reg) at our home. The Rev Totten had been there and this was, to us, the most informative, gentle meeting to date, as it was explained to us in detail how David’s death had effected his Platoon, how the soldier who accidently shot David reacted. We watched a DVD that David’s Platoon had compiled and this put a human touch to this tragic accident. We began to understand and for that we cannot thank the Rev Totten enough. We took great comfort that David died surrounded by friends.\n\n''Twelve weeks after David died, we met with the soldier who shot him. This was probably one of the hardest decisions that we, as parents, had to make, he was able to give us an insight into David’s life in Afghanistan, how close they were, their long talks about family, friends and life back home. On May 31, 2011, he would have celebrated his 21st birthday. David was a loving son and touched the hearts of all who knew him in his short life, he had a beautiful smile, and infectious laugh, a cheeky grin he was outgoing, happy and extremely loyal. This has, and continues to be, a time of utter despair and disbelief at the situation we, our family and friends, find ourselves in. All our hopes and dreams for David have gone, and while we are very proud of what he achieved in his 20 years, we think about what he might have achieved in the future.\n\n\"Now there is a pre-David and post-David’s death. He was firstly our beloved son, he was a brother, nephew, uncle, boyfriend and best friend to all who had the privilege to know and love him. Secondly, he was a soldier and we are very proud that he served in such a distinguished Regiment.\n\n\"Our lasting memories of David is of him growing up as a child, our baby boy, as a toddler playing mini rugby where he got his nick name 'Diesel'; because he ran around so much, the coach asked had he been 'drinking diesel' and the name stuck. We have a burning dream that he will come home, that he is away on a secret military mission and some day he will walk into his family home again, come home. This is our dream.\n\n\"But that dream was shattered when the military told us in August 2012, that at post mortem they kept some of David’s body parts. This was handled diabolically by the military. They did not tell us they had kept parts of David and when it came to bringing the rest of my son home they trailed their feet. It was five months later in December 2012 we were able to have all of David back. When I asked why it had taken from August to December to sort this, we were told, to our utter despair and horror, that it was due to military financial restraints. We have a typed letter of apology.\n\n\"Our anger and argument was 'you had the cash to send my son 3,000 miles to fight a war on terrorism but not enough cash to bring him all back home to his family in Northern Ireland, taking body parts without consent or telling my wife and I it had been done, and not sending him back to his family for the sake of a few hundred pounds sterling'. In a heartbeat, I would give all I have, including my own life, to have my baby boy home safely.\n\n\"No one who has not lost a child can understand the monumental sense of loss and grief. Words have not been written yet, you could scan the Oxford Dictionary and never find the words to describe our feelings at the loss of David. It has changed us in every aspect of our lives there is nothing anyone can say to ease this daily pain.\"\n\nHer mother Rosemary: \"She always wanted to go into the Army. Her dad, Leslie, was in the Ulster Defence Regiment. When she was a toddler, she would take his beret out of his bag, put it on and march around the living room. As she got a bit older, he used to march round with her and show her how to do it.\n\n\"They had a Cadet stand at the school fair and from the age of eight she would ask each year: “Can I join?” They said she wasn’t old enough. But by the time she got to 12, I think they were fed up listening to her, so they said that she could join but she wouldn’t be able to go on exercises yet. We thought the Army was in Channing’s blood: it was all she ever talked about. She went to Cadets every single week – she would bat her eyelids at her Dad and he would iron her uniform. When she came back from exercises on Sundays, she wouldn’t have had much sleep all weekend so she would conk out in bed. She would dump her filthy kitbag for Mum to clean up.\n\n\"She was a real tomboy: she was the only girl in the school football team and one of the only girls in their ice hockey team. She played football and ice hockey for Northern Ireland. The more physical the sport, the more Channing loved it.\n\n\"When she was 16, she wanted to join the Engineers. She passed everything, but she was a couple of centimetres too short [she was 5ft 3in]. So she came home and we put a mark on the wall: we used to measure her each week. She went to the gym and she even used to lie down and one of us would pull her arms and the other her legs to try to stretch her. We had some laughs about it. But she didn’t grow one centimetre.\n\n\"She was absolutely devastated, so I suggested being a combat medic. She said: 'I don’t want to be in a hospital, I want to be on the front line.' We read through it and found that she could [do that]. She was so chuffed. Her passing out parade was very emotional because she was one of the tiniest girls there. I knew that was the career she wanted but I always had the worry of where she could go and what it would involve. But I was delighted when she said: 'Mum, I’ve made it, I’ve done it.' It meant everything to us, because it was her dream. I’m still very proud of her.\"\n\nHis father Robert: \"Oliver was our only child. He was a great outdoor person and sportsman and played rugby and hockey for his school. When he was 12, Oliver took up fencing and was among the top 12 for his age group in the UK, and when he was 17 he became the youngest BSAC Scuba Diving Instructor in the UK, qualifying before he was legally old enough to teach. He was also a highly proficient sky diver! I’m a retired chartered accountant, and the last thing he wanted to do was sit behind a blinkin' desk. Joining the Army was his choice and we fully supported him in it. In an argument, Oliver was like a terrier with a bone; he never gave way and was very independent minded. He had a wonderful close circle of friends who all miss him as much as we do, and who gave him the nickname Victor Meldrew. He always helped those who needed help. If people had problems with their payslips, Oliver was always prepared to go and talk to the authorities and sort it out. The last time I spoke to Oliver was on my birthday, two days before the crash. I was mowing the lawn when I decided to come in for a drink and at that moment he telephoned from overseas to wish me 'Happy Birthday'. We chatted for about 10 minutes. Unfortunately, his mother Priscilla was out at the time. We have so many happy memories and we are incredibly proud of him.\"\n\nHis friend Daniel: \"I first met Oliver at prep school. We were in different year groups so I moved on and we lost touch. Some years later we were reintroduced by a mutual friend and we immediately hit it off again. By this time Olly was in the Parachute Regiment, so we would only see each other when he was home on leave. At that time we were a crowd of five. Whenever we could, we would go out together. This was difficult as the four others were all serving members of the regiment, but as soon as the opportunity would present itself, we would go out and enjoy an evening together. I was one of the first of us to own my own place and it was always the nominated crash-pad after a night out.\n\n\"We would invariably stop for a late-night snack on the way home and wander the last few feet to the house. Olly was always serious about his food and would sit alone in the lounge to enjoy the culinary masterpiece served in a polystyrene box. The rest of us would stand in the kitchen to devour our complete dietary dish! Some time later, those of us in the kitchen would ask: 'where is Olly?' One of us would wander through to the lounge to see where Mr D had gone. I recall only ever once finding him asleep on the sofa. On every other occasion, Olly would have vanished! His dark-brown boaters would be sitting politely on the carpet, waiting for their master. He always walked out of the house, unbeknownst to us, without his shoes?! We would always find him some time later the following morning, as he had to be reunited with his shoes! Olly would later explain that he had received a text from his lady of the moment, offering a more comfortable bed for the night. He is missed every time we get together: his dry humour, intelligent arguments and dashing good looks leave our nights feeling like someone should be with us.\"\n\nHis father and stepmother Stuart and Alison: \"Dane was born in Zimbabwe, brought up in England but considered himself Welsh. At the age of six he came to live with myself, Alison, and Alison’s daughters, Jessica and Becky, in Stroud, Gloucester, but had spent a great deal of time with us previously. Dane showed an aptitude for two things - sport and being naughty! I’ve so many stories to tell about him I’ve thought about writing a book. From hiding his sprouts in his Christmas cracker to flushing Becky’s treasured collection of bath pearls down the toilet.\n\n\"Dane was academically very bright and beyond his years in some subjects. However, this meant he was easily bored, which in turn led to him getting up to mischief. In an attempt to get him through his final year of education he stayed with my parents in Devon and attended the local school. One day after being asked to leave the classroom due to his disruptiveness, he slammed the door and the handle came off in his hand. Being Dane, he decided to leave the school, taking the handle with him, and leaving the teacher and over 30 children unable to get out!\n\n\"After his return to Wales, we chatted about his future and I suggested we go along to the Army recruiting office in Cardiff. Dane was immediately keen to know more and soon afterwards took the entry exam to join up. We were immensely proud when he achieved such a high pass mark that he was selected to attend the Army Foundation College in Harrogate. He joined the Welsh Guards and served in Iraq and Bosnia prior to Afghanistan. Although he continued to live life to the full, he matured into a fine and respected soldier, being promoted to Lance Corporal, aged 22.\n\n\"Dane was killed on July 5, 2009, during Operation Panther’s Claw. His military headstone reads 'Man of Courage. Son of Wales'.\"\n\nHis mother Debby Morris: \"Everyone who knew Dane loved him, and it was no wonder why. He was kind, thoughtful, always putting others before himself. He had such a cheeky grin which was evident when you saw him or looked at his photos. He was always smiling.\n\n\"As a son he was the best, I know all mothers say that but we had a very special bond. On a Friday, when he was due home from camp, his dad and sister used to say, 'Look out wonder boy's home this weekend, we won't get a look in!' They were only joking, of course, as they were looking forward to having him home also.\n\n\"Friday night was always our special night. He would phone up from camp and say, 'Mam, I am on my way, what's the traffic like?' As myself or his dad had invariably been out on the roads travelling with our jobs, we always used to give him tips on the quickest way home. If he was early we used to all go out to the local pub, have a few drinks and then have an Indian takeaway, followed by a rather copious amount of JDs! He would roll around the floor with our big dog Lucky, who absolutely adored him and, as you can imagine, things would go flying.\n\n\"If he was running late he would meet us up the pub, and as he walked down the path he would be beaming at me through the window. As he walked through the door, the regulars would shout, 'Here comes mammy's little soldier'. He loved it and wasn't embarrassed at all, he would walk over and give me a massive hug and kiss. He so loved his Mam.\n\n\"Dane was a mischievous child, always in trouble at school. We were always being called there for one reason or another but he didn't have a malicious bone in his body. It was always the older boys that used to put him up to it, and Dane being Dane just used to do it. Our hearts have been torn apart by Dane's death and there isn't a moment goes by that he is not in our thoughts. He was and always will be our beautiful, precious Dane, always loved, always treasured.\"\n\nHis mother Carol Horan: \"Peter was a proper boy when he was little. We lived on a hill and he had a three-wheeler bike, and every day he would go to the top of the hill even though the bike had no brakes and he’d just zoom down and use his feet as support. He was a very bubbly and lively child and he used to love going to the big play area at the International Garden Festival site in Liverpool to play in all the different ball pools and on the swings – I have good memories of that. He liked fishing too, but that only lasted a short while because he got a fishing hook stuck in his nose. We all laugh at that now.\n\n\"He wanted to join the Army from the age of 11. He was a painter and decorator for six months while he was training and then he signed up when he was 17. He loved it. Before he died, he told his dad he wanted to go all the way, climb the ladder.\n\n\"He had a close circle of friends and all his mates still come round for a drink and go to the cemetery and put flowers down. It was three years in November for us since he died, and sometimes I feel like he’s still going to walk through the door. Sometimes I wake up and think, I can hear him coming in, and going, ‘Mum, it’s only me’. It does get harder each year. People say it gets easier but it doesn’t, because reality hits you.\n\n\"Peter had a lovely smile and was happy and friendly to everyone, polite and loud – all the Army lads used to say you’d hear him before you’d see him because you’d hear that big voice of his. Everything about him was amazing, he was a good boy. We’re all proud of our sons.\"\n\nHis mother Linda: \"He was interested in military matters from his early teens. He joined the Air Cadets and went on to do their young leadership scheme. He then joined the Air Training Corps at university. Later, he joined the Territorial Army in Milton Keynes and he wanted to join up as an officer. He volunteered to go to Afghanistan for a tour because he wanted to get a bit of experience under his belt. He said he didn't think it was right to lead men if he hadn’t experienced it himself. He went at the end of September 2009 and he died on November 15. We had one letter in the short time he was there. He asked that we send some supplies so he could give them to the children. Pencils and those sorts of things. He loved kids. He had a kind heart.\"\n\n\"He found a girl we were sure he would have married had he come back. And she is still part of our life. It is a great loss to us that she isn't going to be our daughter-in-law.\n\n\"The grief can catch you in odd ways and unexpectedly. A butterfly sets us off. That epitomised Andrew. He flitted from one thing to another. At the funeral there was this tortoiseshell butterfly that flitted around the church and landed on the shoulder of one of the Air Cadet friends who had done great things in helping arrange the funeral and the wake. It was poignant. The butterfly was there again when two of his closest friends got married - the same kind of butterfly. And this year on my birthday I went up to the churchyard to tend the grave and out from the church popped the butterfly and landed on my cheek. Whenever we see a tortoiseshell now it sends us off in floods.\"\n\nHis father Kevin: \"November 11 is always an extremely difficult day. It was the last time I ever spoke to Andrew. They had just had their Remembrance Service and - typical him - he had managed to get hold of a satellite phone to call me. It was only for a couple of minutes and he was asking me to send some supplies out to him. His brother, Adam, also managed to have a few words. He seemed quite buoyant despite the fact he found the way they treated women and children a bit medieval.\"\n\nHis brother Jason: \"Daniel was an extremely intelligent young man who put his all into everything he did in life. This is what allowed him to become a member of the 2nd Battalion, The Parachute Regiment, and how, out of 150 soldiers, he was one of only 10 selected to be trained as a Pashto linguist. He tried to understand the Afghan culture in order to make a difference. His bravery and empathy set him apart from his peers; always on the side of the underdog, he was there to lend a sympathetic ear and could not abide bullies.\n\n\"Daniel was planning a career in the Special Forces, as the military was his calling. He was extremely proud of being part of an elite regiment and cared deeply for his Brothers in Arms.\n\n\"When his battalion came back from their tour after Daniel's death, a lot of his comrades came and stayed with us. Telling stories about Daniel gave us an insight into life on the front line and how highly regarded he was. They told us about the night before he was killed, that 10 of them were all huddled together, sitting on a small camp bed around his solar-powered portable DVD player, which had a screen dimension of 6x4in, watching a movie and laughing together. This gives us all great comfort that, even though he was miles from home, he was with his second family.\n\n\"Away from the Army, Daniel was a keen karaoke singer, a car enthusiast and was a hugely popular character. He was always surrounded by people who admired and respected him. He would have made a fantastic uncle, and it is sad that his nieces and nephews will never get to meet him. As a family, we could not be more proud of what Daniel achieved. He was brave and selfless in death, as he was in life. Daniel will be missed by more people than he could ever know. Daniel, we love you, our Hero.\"\n\nHis uncle Paul Gunter: \"Martin was a very determined lad. His father, Danny, died from cancer when he was just five. At age seven he was determined to swim a mile to raise money for charity in his Dad’s honour. His mother, Susan, died from cancer, just before he was due to be deployed to Afghanistan. He died 11 weeks after her death.\n\n\"In caring for his Mum, he was always there at the good and bad times for her and all of his extended family. He'd be there for us all with a laugh and joke at times of worry during his mother's illness. He would often drive down from his base in Scotland just for a few hours to be with her, his brother, sister and girlfriend. On periods of leave he would be decorating and keeping their house and garden in order while still finding time to be with his girlfriend.\n\n\"He was posted to 42 Commando only a few months before their deployment to Afghanistan. This to some would have been daunting, fitting in with others who'd lived and trained together for months. From the accounts given to us after his death, it seems he soon fitted in and was well liked. This is borne out by him asking for certain items to be sent out to him in the shoe box parcels. Herbs, spices, and anything he could use to flavour up the food for himself and the lads when on basic rations. He also made a makeshift Monopoly board game from a compo ration box to use in their down time. We are told this is now framed and adorns a centre part of the Black Knights social bar in Plymouth. He is such a loved and missed part of our family.\n\n\"Sadly, as for Afghanistan, I fear it will go back to what it was when we leave, but that will never diminish what Martin and his colleagues achieved there and how proud we are of him.\"\n\nHis parents Sue and Mike: \"Describing Andrew and the impact his life and death has had on us as a family is almost impossible to do. Our lives were changed forever when we lost him, but that in so many ways he lives on with us all. We have remembered so often the good times and perhaps too often the bad times; when we sat with him in Birmingham and watched him pass away after fighting so hard to live. We often think of his sheer will to live that got him home to us and the fact that we had the chance to sit with him for so many days and to say goodbye. We so want one last chance to talk to him, to hear his voice, to feel his great big arms around our shoulders, as he attempts to crush us in his bear hug. We just want him back in a way that sometimes makes us feel ill and yet in our rational times, we know that we cannot have any of these things – just memories, which seem such little compensation for all that we have lost. There will forever be an Andrew-sized hole in our lives.\n\n\"Andrew loved his life and wanted all those he knew and met to experience the same joy he felt in simply being alive. He was always on the search for new activities and adventures, often roping in those less inclined to do so but always with a kind and generous spirit that charmed those he met. He was fiercely loyal to his family and his friends and was beloved in return. He brought so much love and happiness into our lives. We were so fortunate to be his family and will forever cherish our memories. We try to live our lives like he would – challenging it, relishing new opportunities, people and places.\n\n\"When he joined the Army he found his natural place, he was a born leader and excelled amongst his Kingsmen and peers, inspiring confidence and never asking anyone to do anything he wouldn't do himself. He was a soldier and an officer; he knew what he was doing, he knew the risks and day after day he took them, in the full knowledge of the consequences. His job on that day was to lead and he was wounded doing just that.\n\n\"As one of his best friends described him, he was a bear of a man with a lion’s heart. We will always remember and miss him. He was and always will be one of England’s finest.\"\n\nHis mother Sue: “In losing our son Brett, we lost the most kind considerate person anyone could have known he is missed by all of us every day.\n\nHis friends Rich and Kylie Cutcliffe: “We had the privilege of meeting Brett at secondary school. So many days we would spend at school, pretending to be soldiers. Every chance we had we would get into the role, and he was always the one with no fear. Climbing the tallest trees, jumping\n\nhead-first down the muddiest, steepest slopes. None of us had any doubt that the Army was where his heart lay.\n\n“He was a good friend to us both for years. He had faith in our relationship and was there for us both throughout our entire journey together. We were so happy when he joined the Army.\n\n“Although we worried about him, as this time it wasn't pretend play, his dream had come true. We still remember having regular phone calls from when he was on base. It always seemed to be an unknown number, and the phone call never ended with a goodbye. It always seemed to end when his credit ran out. Because she knew how crazy he could be, Kylie would spend her half of the conversation being a protective friend, obviously to this he would be cheeky in his response.\n\n“He would always be interested, would always listen. He was always happy to put time into his friendships. The other half of the time he spent talking to Rich about his job in the Army. They shared so many common interests in the Armed Forces, and the two of them could have gone on for hours on end. They would always joke about Rich being in a sticky spot with Brett showing up to save the day in his Challenger II.\n\n“The last time we spoke with him, he was so excited that we were getting married, and were expecting our first child. He was sad that he wouldn't be able to make our wedding as he would be on tour. Kylie remembers when we saw him the last time, two weeks before his death, they hugged goodbye and Brett said, ‘look after Chablebear’, which is one of Rich's nicknames.\n\n“His death hit us so hard. We were going to postpone the wedding, but he wanted so badly to be there. We knew he would want us to, and that's what we remember about him a lot. It was never about him, he always prioritised other people, he would love easily and anger slowly. We miss him so badly that it hurts unbearably, missing him every day - especially in September. There are still mornings where we wake up and feel he's still with us.\n\n“We are so proud of him. So proud of his bravery and everything he stood for, both as an individual and for his country. He made such a huge and profound impact on every single person he ever met, a testimony to which is the amount of people who attended his funeral. We think of him every day, and like to think that he checks in on us from time to time. We will see him again one day.”\n\nHis stepmother Leigh: \"Josh was a real comedian, an absolutely fantastic lad, and he literally had time for everybody. He would put everyone else before himself. He was just the tops, the best son, the best brother, we couldn’t be more proud of him. He had been in Afghanistan less than three weeks when he was killed, but he absolutely loved it. He would joke about getting a good sun tan, and in the pictures he sent us he and his friends looked like kids in a playground. But there was a serious side too, and he told us he had seen someone getting blown up. I said to him, ‘Can’t I just come out there and put you in a suitcase and bring you home?’ After he died his friend Lee made a bench in the shape of a tattoo Josh had on his shoulder, which is big enough for 15 people to sit on. We put it on the coastal path at Wembury, near Plymouth, so people can sit there and look out at the sea. Every year on his birthday, on the anniversary of his death and on Remembrance Sunday we go there with his family and friends and light lanterns and set off fireworks in his memory, or have a barbecue. Lee also made a box that we use to store our memories. Whenever the kids make a card or draw pictures for him, we put it in the box. The clothes he bought for his siblings just before he went to Afghanistan are in there too, so they can see them when they’re older. Now some of his siblings want to follow in his footsteps by joining the Army, which is tough. I don’t want my boys to go.\"\n\nHis mother Bridget: \"Daryl’s death has come as a shock to us all. He had only recently written to me saying that he would be home in August - in time for his 28th birthday. I am still coming to terms with it, it is so hard to take in. His passing has left a huge hole that I cannot begin to imagine ever being filled.\n\n\"Daryl had wanted to enlist from being a boy and when he was told he must wait three years because of childhood asthma, he never gave up hope. He was always determined and as soon as he could, he enlisted. When I asked him recently if he would ever leave, he told me that he intended to stay in for his pension. He may not have enjoyed every part of the Army, but he was proud to be a Guardsman. It was something he lived and died for.\n\n\"Daryl had already been to Iraq and was not worried about going to Afghanistan. He believed that they could make a difference. He never talked about the dangers that he faced, to Daryl it was just his job. We are all so very proud of him. Anyone who knew Daryl loved him and we have been overcome by the many cards and letters received from friends and colleagues, both in the Army and at home. While words cannot begin to express the loss that we feel, they have helped us try and come to terms with Daryl’s passing. They say that everyone has faults, but I couldn’t find one in Daryl.\n\n\"I would like to thank everyone for their words of kindness, our family and friends, and Daryl’s many friends in the Army and at home who have been so supportive through this difficult time. I do not intend to spend my life being bitter about Daryl’s passing because that would be a waste of his life. I want him to be remembered as the loyal, loving and generous son that he was to me and the devoted brother he was to his younger sister, Elaine; the son who took his mum to watch his favourite football team, Birmingham; the brother who supported his sister throughout her childhood and the man who always put others before himself. We all miss him so much. We pray for the safe return of Daryl’s comrades in the Grenadier Guards and ask God that no other families have to suffer such an unbearable loss.\"\n\nHis brother Michael: \"We were close all through our lives because he was just a year and two days older than me. When we were younger we used to fight - I think all brothers do - but once we had left school we were best friends. We both worked for my Dad, then I decided to join the Army and shortly afterwards Jonathan joined up. Part of the reason would have been for the challenge; it was a massive achievement just to actually get into the Marines. He always felt he got one up on me because I was in the Army and he was in the Marines – he used to give me a bit of stick about it. The Marines call the Army lads ‘pongos’ because they say they don’t wash, so that’s what he used to call me.\n\n\"We would come home on a Friday after being away all week and get together with our partners and have a big Chinese. My Mum loved us both coming home at weekends whenever we could; we are a close-knit family, which is why it was such a big blow for us. Jon was aware of the danger, without a doubt. He had been in Afghanistan for three months, he came home in January for his R&R for two weeks. He had a fiancée, Hayley, so he spent the majority of time with her. He’d only been back in Afghanistan for a few weeks before it happened.\n\n\"I had left the Army and he had actually signed off from the Marines, handed his chip in. By the end of 2007 he would have been due to leave. I think he’d sort of done his bit and had enough – though he enjoyed it because he loved the Marines and he loved what it was all about and loved the guys he worked with as well. You do your first five years and then you just want a bit of normality, you miss the family at home. We were both planning to work for my Dad again, with a long-term goal of being business partners. It was devastating. You really don’t expect it to happen to someone close to you who you love.\"\n\nHis parents Richard and Jenny: \"Hey Hun, So much has changed since we last saw you, but I think you’d be proud of us - as we are all so very proud of you. We’ve tried hard to “man up” and be brave, and live our lives like you’d want us to. You’d laugh at some of the things we’ve done and even now I can’t believe the lengths your dad has gone to in raising money in your memory – persuading people it would be a good idea to join him in walking 103 miles non-stop along the South Downs Way for one! It nearly killed him and there was very nearly a divorce or two along the way!! The karaoke at the Cricketers was phenomenal – I’ll never forget it but I’m not sure that many others can remember much about it - the lads were just back from “Ganners” – it was messy!! You’d have loved it.\n\nSome of your bessie mates and ex-girlfriends are married, others have split up. It’s hard to think you would be 27 and perhaps sensible and mature!! Ooops - sorry, that’s really mean – only joking! I know from your letters, phone calls and, of course, the stories we’ve since been told, how much you were enjoying the challenge and life of a Royal Marine in action. Living your dream I guess?\n\nSince you died we’ve heard so many funny stories about the things you got up to – your old tutor, Helen from South Downs has a great supply – that’s got you worried hasn’t it!!?\n\nAnd, of course, the family dynamics have changed - Dad and I rattle round the house and try to keep busy – Nick and Charlie have flown the nest (it took a while) - Nick’s a home owner and off to Vegas for his hols (he knew you’d approve)!! Chas is training to be a paramedic and loving London student life. Minstrel, your dog, has transferred his affections - to Nick if he’s around, and then Charlie, down the pecking order with me at the bottom of the list of course -walker, feeder and woman! We sold your car … another little bit of you gone.\n\nWe miss you hun, we miss the banter, we miss you loafing around the house, taking up so much space, and the mess. Family Christmases and your birthday each Boxing Day are an ordeal to be got through. The girlies help to distract us - you didn’t really know your gorgeous little cousins Lia and Sofie- they’re 7 and 5 now and would have adored you so.\n\nWe all send all the love in the world.\n\nxxxxx\"\n\nHis family: \"Jack was immensely proud to be both a Para and a New Zealander. He was absolutely passionate about what he was doing. He was never prepared to accept less than the best and was always striving for the next challenge. His decision to try for the Paras, which he regarded as the foremost Infantry Regiment in the world, reflected this drive and passion. Jack came from a loving family with a long military history. He was the fourth generation of our family to serve in the military. Jack was well-read and believed strongly in what he was doing. He had an understanding of the conflict he was engaged in and prepared his position robustly. However, he never let his profession detract from his innate humanity. Jack died serving alongside some of the great friends he had made in the Army. He comes from a strong and loving family and we miss him dearly.\"\n\nHis friend Jonathan Chilton-Towle: \"He was a great mate and part of the glue that bound our group of friends together. He was full of energy and laughs, and always had your back when things were tough. Even at a young age, Jack was interested in all things military. His best subjects at school were history and classics, probably because of all the battles. He was in the Air Training Corps, and I know his family had a strong tradition of military service. It wasn't that surprising when he left University and went to the UK to pursue his dreams by joining the Parachute Regiment. Next thing we knew he was fighting in Afghanistan.\n\n\"I was always in awe of the bravery it must have taken for him just to be there. From his stories and the emails, we knew he was involved in combat and that it was dangerous, but it still came as a huge shock when we heard he had been killed. We all took it pretty hard, and even though he has been gone for three years it still sometimes doesn't feel real. Jack may have left this earth far too soon but I believe he managed to squeeze every drop of life out of the 23 years he had. Miss you mate.\"\n\nHis father John: \"I was in the Queen’s Royal Lancers, as was Andrew’s uncle and granddad too, so it was in his blood. He signed up to the Signals to start with but a week into his training I got a call saying he’d re-badged.\n\n\"He was such a character, one of those people who just lives life for life. A lot of people called him ‘the joker’ because if anybody was down, he’d always try and put a smile on their face. He was a happy-go-lucky chap and his Colonel said he always volunteered to be the first one for anything, like a true soldier. He loved his family and I’ll always remember how he used to go up behind his granddad and ruffle his head, which used to annoy my dad big style.\n\n\"But really he had two families, us and the Army. All his best mates in the Regiment made a pact before they went out to Afghanistan that if anything happened to one of them, they would always go and visit the family now and then. On September 18, it was the anniversary of his death and about 10 of the lads came down to go and visit his grave. In a way it helped take my mind off things because it still hurts, despite what anyone says. To me, Andrew was the best son in the world. I want everyone in this country to remember not just him, but all of them and the sacrifices they have made to keep us safe.\"\n\nHis mother Sarah: \"He would walk in the room and it would light up. He was always joking and dancing, he loved his music. He liked to help people, even in the street if he saw an old lady, he’d help her across the road with her shopping. Him and his brother followed each other around, looked after each other and got up to all sorts they shouldn’t have! Even now, his brother feels like his right arm is lost without Andrew; they did everything together. He’s left such a big hole, because he was such a big character.\"\n\nHis mother Jacqui: \"Jamie was a real mummy's boy, being the youngest of seven. He was spoilt rotten. From a very early age he wanted to follow in his brothers' footsteps and join up. He overcame so much with dyslexia and chronic asthma, but he was so determined. When he was 16, he went off to the Foundation College in Harrogate. I was so proud.\n\n\"He was so excited about joining the Guards. He was thinking about being stood outside Buckingham Palace with girls coming up to him and asking for their picture taken with him. But, as it turned out, Jamie was a much better soldier in the field.\n\n\"He never told war stories but he was so, so proud of the good he was doing in Afghanistan. He would tell us how young girls were now able to go to school without the fear of being raped and how children were now able to play happily in the villages, and it was Jamie and the other lads who had made that possible. He achieved so much in his short life and I am so happy and proud that he lived his life to the full.\n\n\"Growing up he just didn't stop smiling, despite his asthma, he never complained and was always cheerful. He was the glue that helped keep our family together. I really believe that Jamie was put on this earth for a reason. The explosion that killed him could have taken a lot more lads and I know Jamie will be looking down saying, 'you may have got me, but you didn't get my mates'. That was him, always thinking of others. He was a real carer.\n\n\"I don't think I have fully accepted it and I don't forgive the Taliban, but I am just so grateful that Jamie made a difference to so many innocent lives in Afghanistan. After he died, I received letters from Afghan elders saying how sorry they were and how much he had achieved for them.\n\n\"Jamie was the youngest by six years and we used to joke that he was the best mistake that God ever made.\"\n\nHis parents: \"Tomasz was a loving and very likeable person with massive zest for life; ambitious and determined to do well, not only for himself but for his family; his wife and his two boys who he absolutely adored.\n\n\"He was a ‘man of action’, a real doer. He used to say that there is nothing impossible in life, but you must have a desire to achieve it. He loved learning, sport (being a big rugby enthusiast), facing new challenges and travelling. He spent time in Africa, sightseeing and working; he fell in love with the continent, planning to go back there one day with his family for a holiday.\n\n\"Tom loved his work: the work environment, his colleagues and simply being a Royal Marine. He was so proud to be part of the work that they were achieving in Afghanistan. Tom had enormous energy, and knowledge that he could have given so much more to life and others.\n\n\"We all lost a very precious person and our lives are not the same today because we miss his presence so much; especially as we approach Christmas, the time which should be full of joy and happiness.\"\n\nHis widow Emylie: \"What do I miss most? His drive and ambition, his laugh, his confidence... quite simply his presence, as cheesy as that sounds. We met when I was 18, during our first year at university. So much happened in the eight years that we were together – both of us graduated, Tom started his military training, we moved in together, got engaged and married, had two beautiful boys and chose our dog Dushka. We were building our lives together.\n\n\"Even now, I am having to figure out who I am without him, as well as try to keep things as normal as I can for our children. Being as sociable and fun-loving as he was, Tom made a lot of great friends; having them by my side has been a huge help over the past few years. I have done a fair bit of fundraising in my husband's memory, mainly to keep myself focused on doing something positive, for some good to come out of it all.\n\n\"I raised £2,000 for MOSAIC – a Dorset-based charity which supports bereaved children and their families. To mark what should have been my husband’s 30th birthday, I had a BBQ with friends and family and auctioned off Tom's sporting equipment (diving gear, climbing gear, mountain bike etc). There was also a sponsored 'Toddle for Tom', organised by our youngest son’s childminder, with all the children she cares for walking a mile to raise money for the same charity.\n\n\"The main fundraising event though, was Kilimanjaro last year. Tom had climbed the mountain before I met him. My brother and I came up with the idea because we wanted to do something memorable.\n\n\"Tomasz did so much in his life and I want to be able to say that I have lived my life as fully and as actively as he did, so that I can teach our boys to follow their dreams in the same way. I organised the trip which involved my brother and 11 other friends and colleagues. Together we raised around £15,000 for the Royal Marines Charitable Trust Fund. I have to stress that it was not all me – I have some amazing friends who took it upon themselves to help out in every way they could. I am not entirely sure of the total raised but I think it may be about £20,000.\"\n\nHis mother Maggie: \"I’m proud of him and I love the army, but like other mums I am up and down. I can’t move on. I still remember day one, I still remember that knock on the door. I remember it every day. You don’t forget.\n\nIt’s coming up to five years now and it just seems like yesterday and then you start thinking is he dead? Is he not undercover somewhere? And he is going to knock on my door some day. You know he isn’t but it gives you that bit of hope that what’s happened is not true.\n\nHe learned Pashto, did his snipering, did his lance corporal, which he was absolutely thrilled that he did. They asked if someone would learn the language because it was better if someone in group knew it so he put his hand up. He would learn it off a laptop that he brought home.\n\nHe wanted to intermingle with the Afghans when he was out and about; he wanted to know what they were saying. I am not sure whether it was all worth it, but I am sure if you asked him, and if he could, he would do it all again.\n\nHis brother Christopher’s in the army now. He’s been in 12 months come January. He is in 3 Rifles now - in David’s batallion - up in Edinburgh. David said when you are going in the army you are going to be with me - in my batallion. And he still kept his word even though David isn’t around anymore.\n\nI don’t go out these days. I haven’t got a life. I just exist since David’s death. It’s so hard. You don’t expect your kids to go before you. I’ve got to keep myself together because I’ve got Christopher. If it wasn’t for him I wouldn’t be here now.\n\nI’ve been trying to get Elizabeth Cross for nearly five years now and nobody wants to know. I’ve written to the Queen and everyone. Mums should get something. I don’t care about dads, but for mums there should be something. I’m the one he would speak to, I am the one who spent money so he had all the decent stuff, I spent thousands. Mums are suffering. No one seems to care. I give birth to that child and I had to make every decision for him.\n\nI’m just glad it’s over and all the lads have come home to their families now. I think it’s disgusting the way they were treated. They have to survive on nothing. People in prison get treated better than these lads did. People seem to think it’s all over. Well it isn’t over for people such as me.\"\n\nHis father Michael: \"'Michael got it into his mind that he wanted to be a Royal Marine and there was no stopping him. It's the hardest course in the British Army and he passed with flying colours. He loved being a Marine. He was a joker in the Marines but I think he was more like that with his mates than with us. He was a caring boy, willing to help people out even when he was young. And he was always smiling. From when he was a baby upwards, he always had a smile on his face.\n\n''I lost my wife, Janet, before Michael. She died in August; Michael came home and then went back to Afghanistan in September. He was there five months when he was shot. The doctors in Kandahar said he wouldn't regain consciousness but they flew him back [to Birmingham]. We turned off his life support. He was only shot once and there was no obvious trauma. He just looked like he was lying in bed asleep. I was really grateful for that.\n\n''At his funeral, there were so many people they couldn't fit in the church. The pub across the road opened early so people could sit down. I knew he had a lot of friends but I was taken aback by how many were there. I just remember all the people being outside. It's those things that stick in your mind.Our other son, Jonathan, was born later on in life. He was five when he lost his mother and five-and-a-half when Michael was killed. The last few years have been tough but we talk about his mum and brother all the time. We look through Michael's photos from Afghanistan. Sometimes Jonathan says, 'I want to be a Royal Marine like my brother'. I've always been one to say let them do whatever they want to do in life, but that would be very difficult. We miss Michael so much.\"\n\nEight months before Tpr Phillip Lawrence died, he had become a father, with the birth of his daughter, Jessica. His widow Amy: “Jess and I would most like Phil to be remembered for being the caring, happy-go-lucky person he was, who was always willing to help anyone any way he could. I think he would like to be remembered as the life and soul of the party, who was always the first person on the dance floor and who always made the most of life and never had any regrets.\n\n“Phil never spoke of the risks out in Afghanistan as he always said if you talk like that something will happen. When he came home on his R&R I noticed a difference to when he had first gone out. He didn't talk about what was happening or going on but the night before his flight back out to Afghanistan he said if anything was to happen to him, what he wanted for his funeral and how he wanted Jess to be brought up, and that he wanted us to be proud of him and know how much he loved us.\n\n“My happiest memory of Phil is the moment Jess was born and put into his arms for the first time. It's the one and only time I've ever seen him speechless and not know what to say, with just a massive grin on his face. I talk about Phil as much as Jess wants me to, and tell her how much she is like him, as she is a double of him in her personality and her features. We talk about his favourite things, how much he would be proud of Jess and how much he loves us and is still with us, just not physically. We also choose together something fun to do on Phil’s anniversary every year that Jess thinks we would have been doing together as a family.\"\n\nHis mother Wendy: \"Everybody smiles when they think of Robbie. He always wanted to be a soldier, even when he was a little boy. In the Army he was nicknamed 'The Morale Machine', because he made everyone laugh and kept everyone going. It was the same at home, he had this cheeky smile and a booming laugh and he was friends with so many people. We are all so proud of him, and to have known him. When he passed out from Catterick he was ‘best shot on light machine gun’ and also ‘best endeavour’, but could only take one prize and chose best shot. It underlines what a promising career it was that was cut short so tragically.\n\n\"He was brave, too. One of his Commanding Officers said he had earned a reputation for humour, dependability and courage, and had been in fierce battles with the enemy. He turned 18 in March 2009, arrived in Afghanistan in the May, and was killed two months later. But he had been in fierce battles, saved lives by clearing mines and packed a lot into his time there. He was proud to be a soldier, he was living his dream and you couldn’t have stopped him being a soldier. As his Platoon Commander said, his two passions in life were his family and the Army. He was a big, big personality and the five years since his death have been devastating for the family. Since his funeral we have started raising money for Help for Heroes, which has given us purpose. Rob was compassionate, he always put others before himself, he always looked after other people, and this is our way of doing that on his behalf. The last thing he bought me was a Help for Heroes wristband at the airport when he left, and so far we and his friends have raised £60,000 for the charity in his name. I know he would have approved.\"\n\nHis mother Helen: “I remember we were on holiday in Italy, he was only little. They had some little quad bikes and all the kids were on them, they were going round the circuit really carefully. Not him. He put his head down, revved it up and off he went. All the Italian blokes were running around waving. He was about five at the time - a little monkey. But he was determined. He took after his Dad in that - once he started something, he was determined. Later, the Army Careers people went to his school and he just came home and said, 'I'm joining up'. His Dad went and signed the papers. I thought, 'if he really wants to do it he'll do it when he's 18 anyway.\n\n\"He was deployed to Iraq when he was 18. He never really discussed it, he didn't say what he had seen or what he had done. It changed him, I don't know what it was but I found that when he was at home he couldn't sit still. Maybe it was because he was so used to being on the go all the time.”\n\nShortly before CFN Lombardi's next deployment, this time to Afghanistan, his fiancée Ellie Blakey gave birth to their son, Harvey. “He loved being a dad. Harvey was about six months when Anthony went to Afghanistan. He was due home in the October. He was home in June on R&R. He was tired but he was all right in himself. He didn't discuss what he had done, he brought some photographs home - and it was straight out to the supermarket to get a crate of beer. He enjoyed his time when he came home, meeting up with all his mates.”\n\nBut only weeks later he was killed. “To be honest, I used to stand in my kitchen and I would just imagine how the knock on the door would be,” said Mrs Lombardi. “I think deep down I didn't think he was going to come home. When he went to Iraq I was OK but Afghanistan to me seemed different.\"\n\nHis son Rob: \"My dad was an amazing man, he was loving and caring and always knew what to say to makes things seem OK. He was dedicated to whatever he focused on, whether that be work, or being a father.\n\n\"I honestly don't know if [Afghanistan] was worth the sacrifice that has been made, but I hope it was. I hope there are people who are able sleep feeling slightly safer and that they appreciate what has been given. I'm glad the campaign is ending, as I wouldn't want another person to have to feel the loss of losing someone in war.\n\n\"I miss having a Dad, who I can talk to when things aren't great. I miss his smile, and him telling me he is proud of me and that he approves of how my life is. I miss the fact that I can't tell him that I love him, or tell him how my day has been. He was always there for me, regardless of when it was. He took the time to go for walks/hikes with me, and go running, although I probably slowed him down!!! My Dad knew when I was trying to pull the wool over his eyes, and never let me get away with it!!! It's the small things that made him amazing.\n\n\"I wish I had been able to tell him that I am gay, I'm pretty sure he knew, but I never told him outright and that's a big regret of mine. I knew he wouldn't have cared, because I'm his son, and his love was unconditional.\" His wife Jennifer: \"We met at the Chinese takeaway where Robert worked in Deal – his home-town. I’d seen him and thought, ‘He looks a bit nice’. So when my friends asked, ‘where can we get a good takeaway? I said ‘I know one! I know one!’.\n\n\"When we went in he just passed me his phone number and said, ‘call me’. I didn’t call, though. Eventually he called me and said, ‘I’m still waiting for that phone call’, and I said, 'It’s not very ladylike for a woman to call a bloke, it should be the other way around.' He said, ‘Well I’m calling now’ and that was it, that was the start of our friendship, then it developed into a relationship and then it developed into a marriage.\n\n\"We loved doing spur of the moment things. We’d be sitting in the house, and think ‘right...' and then we’d get into the car, with our son Rob, and drive off. We’d just say pick that road, go left or right or straight ahead, and end up wherever... but there was always a burger bar. Rob and his Dad loved burgers. So we always ended up where there was a burger bar.\n\n\"Robert was a good man. He always put everybody before himself. Always. I’m not just saying that because he’s a soldier and fought for his country, I’m saying it because I was his wife. He loved the Army, he loved the British flag; he loved everything it stood for. He loved Queen and Country.\n\n\"Since he died, it has been horrible. Every time it comes to Remembrance Sunday, it’s like living through it all over again. Every time it comes and you lay a wreath, the grief comes all over again. But, you just have to knuckle down and get on with life.\n\n\"You expect them to come home after their shift at work and say, ‘OK, what’s for dinner? If there’s nothing cooked, we’ll have takeaway’. Life has to keep going on – you just wish that person was with you. One of his biggest dreams was to go to Reykjavík in Iceland and I’m going to go in January. I’m going to take a passport picture of my husband and I’m going to leave it in Iceland. I’ll do it for him.\"\n\nHis widow Sheralee: \"Carl and I met when he was at HMS Nelson in Portsmouth and I was working at an insurance company there. His friends asked him to go out to the local nightclub, Martine’s, and my friends also phoned to ask me to go out with them. Neither of us wanted to go: I was at home already and I wanted to stay in and watch a bit of TV. But both of us ended up there.\n\n\"I was having a really good evening and one of them, Julie, pointed Carl out to me and said: 'I’ve just seen this guy with the most fantastic smile'. I thought: he seems really nice. Then, as he was dancing with another friend, he was looking at me. So my friend said: 'I know her, would you like to meet her?' We arranged to meet up the next day, and that was that.\n\n\"He was a fantastic dad. Our daughter, Lara, has just turned 21, Daniel is 19, and Tom has just turned 17. He wasn’t one of these men who wouldn’t change nappies – he would do everything I did.\n\n\"With his job, he was away a lot but he would always take them out when he could. He would take them to the cinema and to the park. When they were a little bit older, the boys got into motorbikes so he’d take them off-road biking. Tom really loved it. They’d go to a farm outside Poole and spend hours there on a MoD range. They’d come back really tired, but they were so enthusiastic about it.\n\n\"I’ve got a couple of pictures of him with the kids as babies. There is one of us as a family: I’m next to him, he’s got Tom on his back and he is hugging the two other kids. He’s looking down at the kids and smiling. He was always smiling.\"\n\nHis father Dennis: \"I’m raising money to keep his name alive and the only way I can do it is through charity. He was the 120th to die and a lot of things changed at the time. Deaths were being publicised more – before that it was all behind closed doors. Nicky always wanted to join the Army. When he was three or four he had a picture of the Paras on his bedroom wall. Later he took up judo, football and boxing – he was an all-rounder. He was very close to his family and really looked after his sisters. He was never unhappy, always positive and always put himself forward for things. In fact, that was probably why he was killed. He’d drive people mad because he’d be getting people out of bed and make them go out and train with him. But he was kind and would cheer people up. If one of the lads was down, after five minutes talking to Nicky, they’d be laughing and joking. He would never talk about being in Afghanistan and I wouldn’t ask him about it. I tried to ignore him being out there and wouldn’t watch the news. When he was back home he would be his old self. He didn’t seem to have changed and would say that where he was based wasn’t dangerous which, of course, wasn’t true. I think once he went back there he would probably turn like a switch.\n\n\"Nicky had so much going for him. He was a great soldier and opportunities were being thrown at him. I often think about what he could have achieved. I started to raise money for Nicky to keep his memory alive – to make sure he is never forgotten. The response can be overwhelming sometimes and, now that we’re a registered charity - Lancecorporalnickymasonmemorialfund.co.uk - we can push out and further.\"\n\nHis sister Kelly. Kelly and her mother Linda have set up a charity in Tom’s memory: The Thomas (Tam) Mason Foundation. It raises money locally in Fife, Scotland, to help young people get involved in sport – a life-long interest of Tom’s: \"We wanted to do something to remember Tom. He was always a really keen sportsman. He started learning spirit combat [a martial art] when he was nine years old, and he ended up teaching it as a teenager. Tom decided I needed a bit more discipline in my life, so he took me along to the classes. I ended up getting my junior black belt, and I still do adult classes. It’s a connection Tom and I had, and it’s a way of staying close to him. It’s helped shape me into the woman I am today.\n\n\"Tom and I were always close growing up. We shared the same group of friends and at times I think he must have hated having to drag his wee sister round with him. I think he always wanted to be a soldier. I remember as kids playing war at the old Salvation hall across from our house. He shouted ‘bomb!’ when a brick fell off and hit me off the head (I still have the scars to prove it!).\n\n\"I turned 28 recently. Tom was 27 when he died, and I found it very difficult to be older than him. It was an emotional day, and I couldn't celebrate it. Tom was always my older brother. It feels wrong that I’m still here, older than him, and he's gone.\n\n\"One of the nice things that has happened since losing Tom is that I gained a new family member. Before Tom went to Afghanistan he got two puppies from my mum, Flash and Prophet. Tom’s widow couldn’t look after Flash, so she gave him to me. He has brought so much joy into my life as he’s a part of Tom. I speak to Tom through Flash every day. He always manages to put a smile on my face no matter how hard the day has been. I smile at the memories I have of Tom, but I cry because I know I can't make any more.\"\n\nHis mother Linda: \"Family and friends all go to the cemetery on that day every year to talk to Tom and remember him. In past years, we’ve set off Chinese lanterns in the evening.\n\n\"Tom was adorable as a child, a mother’s boy. He told me his friends were all jealous because he’d got the best mum. ‘You’re the prettiest and you make the best chips,’ he told me. ‘What could be better than that?’\n\n\"Because of his bright red hair, Tom always got caught doing naughty things because he stood out so much. It was carrot coloured, and as he got older he got very self-conscious about it. He’d say he was a strawberry blond, not a ginger!\n\n\"The charity is very important to us. We’ve raised about £8,000, and it’s spent locally in Fife. If kids can’t afford to go to a tournament, for instance, or they need sports equipment, they can apply for a donation. Tom would have been very proud.\n\n\"Things move on when somebody dies. It’s always fresh for us, his family, but obviously his ex-colleagues are doing other things now and there’s less about Afghanistan in the papers. Commanding Officers change, life moves on. It’s important for us to remind everyone that there was a man called Tom Mason, he did exist, he was an important person to a lot of people. He’s the first thing I think of when I wake in the morning, and the last thing before I go to sleep. People always ask me on Remembrance Day what I’ll be doing to remember Tom. But I don’t need one day of the year to think of him. I think of him every single day.\"\n\nHis mother Margaret McCormick: \"Aaron was very intelligent; he got four A-levels and nine GCSEs, and he always had to be constantly doing something to keep his mind busy. He played the clarinet and he was moving onto the saxophone. He wanted to join the RAF from being about two years old. He loved aeroplanes. But the Royal Irish was in his blood. They originally wanted him to go to Sandhurst, but he said he wanted to start at the bottom. He'd say how could he give anyone else orders, when he didn't know what it was like to take them?\n\n\"He was a Star Trek fan, he grew up being mad about everything to do with space. He was an adventurer and a practical joker; he was the joker of the family and had us all in stitches. If you were feeling down, he would always think of something to cheer you up. You never knew what was going to happen or where he would be hiding – wherever you'd least expect him. He would have loved the ice bucket challenge – the whole house would have been soaked. He was full of life, loved a good laugh and a good carry on. There was a serious side of him as well. All his friends say he was the one they'd go to if they ever had a problem, and that he was caring and wise beyond his years. He phoned home as much as he possibly could, but never let on he was scared. He kept all that from us so we weren't upset or worried. It's very hard. There is just a hole and it will never be filled, never. We still talk about him daily. If we're talking amongst the family, it's as if he's still here. Because he is, he'll always be with us. We're so proud of him. He was brave, he really was.\"\n\nHis mother Elaine McCulloch-Brandt: \"Luke always wanted to make you laugh. One time, we were sunbathing out in the yard and without notice he came and threw buckets of water over us. Or, when he was little, he’d come into my room in the middle of the night and pull my blankets off and run away laughing.\n\n''If things were hard or you were sad, he’d say, 'Mum, life’s too short. Let it go over your head.' Those are things I should be telling him, I’d think, not the other way around.\n\n''I’ve heard so many stories from Afghanistan about how he’d try and make everybody laugh. When they were packing up to go into the war zone he was the only one that calmed them down because of his attitude. I’m happy he was like that but not surprised – it’s who he was.\n\n''If he was anxious, we’d talk it out. But I don’t think he showed many people that side. He did once tell me he was scared in Afghanistan. He said, 'Mum, it’s not a nice place. It’s not nice what you see out there.' But he said he was doing it to make sure that violence doesn’t come here to us.\n\n''One time, they were out on patrol and came across a village with a lot of kids. The kids were thirsty, and even though it was three hours to get back to camp, Luke insisted on giving away most of the water. He was like that, he’d give the shirt off his back to someone else.\n\n''He wasn’t materialistic at all. One year when we were living in South Africa we were robbed just before Christmas. He took his presents, wrapped them up and told me to give them to his brother.\n\n''Luke wasn’t the type of young man who didn’t like his mother to kiss him in front of friends. I’m 5ft 4 and he’s more than 6ft but when we were at a wedding in Scotland and he bent down to let me kiss him. Something I do with both my boys is kiss them on their eyes, on their foreheads, on their cheeks and lips, and give them a hug. One friend said, ‘Why do you let your mum do that?' and he turned around and said, 'Because I love her.”\n\nHis brother Robert: \"Less than a year before than his death, whilst Stephen was attending his Section Commanders’ course at IBS Brecon, he travelled home on a weekend off to Ternhill to visit his heavily pregnant wife. Carley, by chance, gave birth to their baby daughter Keeley that weekend. Both were ecstatic. However, their joy was short-lived as disaster struck when their baby daughter died tragically two days later. Both Stephen and Carley were left heartbroken. Stephen returned to complete his course later on in the year. In late 2010, Stephen was offered the chance of a posting in the UK rather than joining the remainder of 1RIR halfway through another tour of Afghanistan. His response: 'I did not spend months doing my Section Commanders’ course to take the easy option.' I think that sums him up. On March 9, just days before the first anniversary of his daughter’s death, Stephen lost his life. In the days leading up to his death, he had the opportunity, by chance, to phone all of the family at home. He was laid to rest beside his daughter in his home town Banbridge. I know that his wife Carley, and indeed all of the family, drew great comfort from the fact that he is reunited with his little girl.\n\n\"Growing up, Stephen did not have much interest in the academic side of life, but excelled at anything sporty. After leaving school, he worked at various jobs before joining Royal Irish Regiment home service (3RIR) on a part-time basis. It was here that he caught the bug for the military life. When RIR Home Service was disbanded, he and younger brother Michael transferred to 1st Battalion Royal Irish, then based at Inverness. He was shortly after deployed on his first tour of Afghanistan on Op Herrick 8. Stephen enjoyed the Army life and was definitely in for the duration. And it was through the Army that he met Carley. Throughout his life he had more than his fair share of misfortune, between injuries and accidents. Despite this, Stephen always had a happy-go-lucky attitude, and I can honestly say was the most easy-going, honest, funny person I have ever met. In 27 years I never witnessed him having a disagreement with anyone.\"\n\nHis mother Sarah Adams: \"He was just good and honourable. Those are the words that spring to mind when I try to sum James up. He never caused me a moment's grief when he was growing up, he was just lovely. His smile and his blue eyes could light up a room. He was just so handsome. He had never harboured any ambition to join the Army, it came completely out of the blue. He had always wanted to work as a graphic designer, but then he did a couple of weeks' work experience in a graphic design office and he came home and said 'That's not for me mum.'\n\n\"As soon as he joined up he loved it. Everyone loved James, he had a fantastic group of friends and in a way they have become like my extra children. I have got to know more about him through them. He was always really quiet to me, but to them he was the joker. There wasn't anyone who didn't like him, he was just so lovely and easygoing. James was so laidback, nothing fazed him and you could never get a rise out of him.\n\n\"Every year on his birthday and on the anniversary of his death, we all get together and talk about him and laugh at the happy memories of him.\n\n\"Losing him is not something that ever goes away because it's there every day when you wake up. People say it gets easier in time. I don't know. I have tried to stay positive in James's memory, but five years of not seeing him and not seeing him become the person he could have been is hard.\n\n\"It has also been hard for James's brother Josh and sister Emma. Josh was just 16 at the time and he was in the house when the knock at the door came. He heard it all as they told me. James was Josh's hero when he was growing up. He always wanted to be just like him and copy everything he did. James was the one who got him into basketball and he had just been selected for the Welsh under 18 squad at the time, but he has not played basketball since.\n\n\"Despite the pain, every time I time I think about James, I smile. I remember when he was a little boy and he was always dressing up as Batman or Superman. The number of times I ended up in hospital with him because he thought he could fly.\n\n\"In November 2012 I travelled to Camp Bastion to be at the place where he closed his eyes for the last time. It was something I simply had to do. Being there felt like there had been a weight lifted from my shoulders.\"\n\nHis brother Josh: \"I miss the brotherly banter and just hearing his laugh... I can't explain it, its too hard.\"\n\nHis friends, Sarah Beckett, Christie Curran, Lara Homan, Scott Roberts, Dom Jarman and Dan Slade: \"We are so proud to have an amazing friendship group and Prosser will always be the star of all our unforgettable memories, he is still the glue that holds our group together. He was a real character with the wittiest sense of humour and will always be remembered for his outstanding one-liners.\n\n\"When he died at just 21 he left an empty space that nobody will ever fill, he was far too young to have enjoyed properly what life had to offer him. The amount of respect we have for him is indescribable, he is a true friend and a real hero.\n\n\"As we are all maturing there are occasions when its hard knowing that he's not here anymore, nothing will ever be the same without him, the heartache will never go away, but remembering that cheeky smile, it's not hard to brighten up your day.\"\n\nHis mother Shirely: \"When he was seven, Dave wanted to join the Army; it was his dream. He could not wait till he was 13 to join the Cadets to do his duty to God and Queen, along with his best friend John. Together they joined the Army at 16 and did tours in Northern Ireland, Bosnia, Iraq and his final tour Afghanistan. The lads all knew him as 'Lizard', as somehow he kept two iguanas in his barracks in Northern Ireland.\n\n\"His two brothers and two sisters miss him being part of their lives: to his big brother he was someone to look up to; he would talk problems over with his oldest sister and he would play games and fool about with his younger brother. He was a big kid and they would sit on the floor laughing their heads off – especially on Wii and playstation games. He did everything with his twin sister; they always took care of each other.\n\n\"To me, his mum, he was a best friend – he was the only one in the family that would get up and dance with me at any time, any place, anywhere. He was known for being a top lad. He was a morale booster when the boys were down – he would burst into Greenday songs while out on exercise and the lads would join in – he was an 'anyone for a brew' tea-maker, a supporter and someone who welcomed the new young ones. He loved tattoos – he had a big lizard on his back, along with Greenday lyrics to the song Jynx (he thought his life had gone down the wrong path once or twice). His love of keeping good cars was the same as his dress sense – it left much to be desired and was laughed about, but it made him an individual to remember.\n\n\"He was forever likeable and his cheeky grin was always there. He was down to earth and saw the good side in everyone. I chose you, we loved you and we all miss you, as you would have said from the song you asked for at your funeral (Greenday's Good Riddance): 'Something unpredictable but in the end is right, I hope you had the time of your life.'\"\n\nHis uncle Ronald: \"Martin was known as 'Rob the Gob' by his mates because he would always stand up for them. He would stand up to their seniors and for the other lads in the Platoon. His Commanding Officer once told me when they were still stationed here they had been booked to go down to the South coast for a bit of a break. It was a new Commanding Officer who had booked the trip and when they were down there, he went to Martin and asked him what he thought of it, asked if he was enjoying himself. And Martin said, ‘Whoever booked this was an idiot. He didn’t think about it or he wouldn’t have booked it a week before pay day!’ – and it was him who organised it. He was a great lad, so well liked and respected by everyone back home. We’re in a small village community here. He played football for the local football team, Machno United, whenever he was home on leave and to this day – five years later – they still remember him. His nickname was Rambo because when he was young he always wanted to be a soldier. And on the team’s football shirts, where the name of the sponsor would be, they have Rambo printed instead. And they have the logo of the Royal Marines on the back.\n\n\"He comes from a big family and it’s important to us that we keep his memory alive. We should never forget him. I don’t think anybody could ever forget him. His close friends still always talk about him, and even two of the Marines who were with him in Afghanistan have made friends with some of his mates from home. It’s good to see something nice come from something so terrible.\"\n\nHis father Ian Sanderson: \"Those who knew him remember his infectious, inspiring smile and zest for life. John ensured he made the most of his opportunities to travel and learn more about the world. His glass was always half full and his positivity rubbed off on those around him. He was always there to pick you up when you were down and to spur you on, and he took his enthusiasm and positivity into his military career.\n\n\"He cared deeply about his men and took a genuine interest in their lives, both professional and private. He believed in their mission in Afghanistan and was keen to see how their lives could be improved. He truly believed in the stabilisation of Afghanistan and on occasions when local nationals and others seemed negative, he always saw the best in people. Despite the often high intensity of combat operations, he remained focused on how he could help those living there. Noticing that a lack of basic veterinary care for local animals led not only to the the loss of liuvestock but also threatened people's livelihood, he campaigned passionately for a vet to come to the area. Although he did not achieve this in his time there, it happened on the following tour and proved successful.\n\n\"His letters home captured both the challenges being faced and his desire to succeed. Mindful of what an anxious time his deployment was for friends and family, he was careful to make sure his letters sent love and reassurance. His empathy for others partnered with his love of life made him a great boss, a wonderful friend, a treasured cousin, grandson and brother and a much loved son.\n\n\"He will always be missed but the many happy memories we have of him help to keep him alive in our hearts and his smile shines on.\"\n\nHis widow Karen: \"In May 2010, Seth prepared once again for another operational tour of Afghanistan. We were accepting of this routine and valued our family time, particularly when there was a period of separation ahead. There were milestones that Seth was most likely going to miss while he was away: Molly, aged 11, was transitioning from primary to senior school; Heather, aged 15, was going to be undertaking her Duke of Edinburgh Silver expedition, and Seth and I were going to be celebrating our 20th wedding anniversary in August.\n\n\"Having met at school, I had spent my entire adult life with Seth and felt secure and happy with the life we had. Seth balanced his work and home life as best he could; he was adventurous, committed, caring and devoted to the three of us and we accepted that he had to work away for long periods from time to time. He never burdened us with worries or heightened my concerns and I always felt confident that he would return home.\n\n\"The news that Seth was taken from us was devastating and has changed the course of our lives for all time. However, near at hand were the Royal Marines' military family and they embraced us. We never feel forgotten or hidden away. They offered us a security that was swept away that day and I shall always feel indebted to them.\n\n\"The children too have been supported in many ways and, just before the Christmas following Seth’s death, we were invited to a children’s Christmas party at 10 Downing Street, where we met other bereaved families. It was there that we heard about the good work of the Forces Children’s Trust and how it offers children like Heather and Molly opportunities to participate in enriching experiences that allow them to make new friends. Molly, in particular, has benefited from their support and has formed friendships that will, I’m sure, be cherished for the rest of her life.\n\n\"Seth was awarded the Conspicuous Gallantry Cross for his act of selfless bravery, which led to his death on July 1, 2010. But his sacrifice saved the lives of his comrades on that day. He was skilled and professional and I never doubted his commitment to those he worked with. After spending time away, he always slipped effortlessly back into family life; he was a spontaneous person who would make the most of every opportunity to relax and have fun. We miss him terribly but I am certain he would be so proud of Heather, who is now at university, and Molly, who is studying for her GCSEs. We have done our best to adjust to having a depleted family and, although we will continue to suffer sensitive days, we are at a stage when we can look back and smile as we remember him. When I think of Seth I feel immense pride and feel honoured and grateful that we filled such a big part of his life.\"\n\nHis friend and colleague Ben Scollick: \"In 2002 there was a war raging every night on the D Squadron floor of the barracks. One individual had bought a battery-powered, fully-automatic MAC 10 BB machine gun and made it quite clear that all targets were fair game.\n\n''One Sunday evening I had just arrived back at barracks and Tanz walks in with a big stupid grin on his chops. 'I've bought my BB guns back,' he said. Tanz's armoury had enough weapons to kit out all four lads in our room to a level where it became a 'non-target'. However, this did not make going to the ablutions any safer.\n\n\"I was brushing my teeth one evening when two lads came in armed with BB guns. Fortunately for me they were after whoever was in the shower. After a couple of seconds of giggling they picked the lock and opened the shower door. To their joint horror, Tanz was stood there, under the waterfall, naked as the day he was born, holding two Desert Eagle gas-powered BB canons. Tanz, in his best Darth Vader impression, uttered the iconic line: 'You underestimate the power of the dark side', while unloading said canons into the two lads foolish enough to cross him. For some reason they both felt it wise to drop to the ground and adopt the foetal position. With his extended magazines, Tanz made sure that no one would ever be targeted in the showers again. There are plenty of other stories that could have been told. This is one of the tamest but also one of my favourites. It truly was an honour to have had you in our lives. We miss you every day brother. I wrote this a short time after Sean's death:\n\nDreams\n\nLike a Fish out of water,\n\nOr a day without dawn.\n\nI can't hear his laughter,\n\nI'm so lost without Sean.\n\nMy life feels so empty,\n\nI'm only a shell.\n\nI'm living in torment,\n\nI think I've found hell.\n\nI stare at his photo,\n\nAnd remember those days.\n\nWhen carefree we stumbled,\n\nAlong life's rocky ways.\n\nBe it a British city street,\n\nOr an Iraqi desert road,\n\nAs brothers-in-arms,\n\nWe bravely strode.\n\nIt's all finished now,\n\nThe dream is well over.\n\nCanada is history,\n\nAnd I won't mention Dover!\n\nTogether till the end,\n\nNo questions asked.\n\nNow all I have,\n\nAre dreams of the past.\n\nForever mate.\"\n\nHis family: \"'Remember - do not mourn my death as hard as this will seem but celebrate a great life that has had its ups and downs - I love you all more than you would ever know.' These are some of the words written by our son Rfn Cyrus Thatcher aged 19, who was killed by an IED on June 2, 2009, in a letter he left, unbeknown to us, only to be read in event of his death.\n\n\"Where have these last five-and-a-half years gone? Oh, how we have tried and wish we could celebrate that ‘great life’ but as a family it has been impossible to do so when you spend the first year in complete shock, the second year with the knowledge that this is now a reality, the third year trying to accept this reality and the fourth and fifth years still wondering what on earth has happened to our lives, knowing every subsequent day is another day since we last saw his blue eyes, heard his infectious laugh and held him in our arms.\n\n\"He was an incredible young man who it turned out was born to be a soldier and what he amounted to in his short life leaves us wondering what he could have achieved had that life not been cut short. It is an agony we, as parents, face on a daily basis watching his brothers living on without him to share their lives. Zac, now 27, still feels the guilt of not being able to protect his younger brother and Steely, now 23, had to face the day he became older than his older brother.\n\n\"We will always have three sons who we are equally proud of and love with all our hearts, although there is one who consumes us because he is no longer here and the last sentence of his last letter will forever echo in our heads: 'I wish you all the best with your dreams. Remember chin up, head down. Love Cyrus.'\"\n\nHis father Kevin Tomlin: “Ryan knew what he wanted to do in life probably from the age of six or seven. He spent a short time as a Sea Cadet, went out on a boat for a week and said, ‘I’m not doing that anymore!’ But it was always going to be the Army or Air Force. My dad was in the RAF regiment and I think from then he knew what he was going to do.\n\n“He was always happy, and in later life he was always smiling. He was very outgoing, loved the ladies, loved a drink and loved his car. It’s a job to describe him because there was a side of him that we never knew about when he was in the Forces, but when we spoke to all his friends they all said he was fearless. He was always the first one to say ‘come on then, let’s get going, what are we all sitting around moping for?’ He was pretty highly thought of by everybody and he was always very adventurous. One of the quotes he liked was: 'If you're not living life on the edge, then you're taking up too much room.'”\n\nRyan’s friend, SAC Pete Buckland, RAF Regiment: “Ryan was an amazing soldier and a even better friend, not a day goes by where I don’t think of him. He is truly missed and will never be forgotten. Shortly after his death I wrote this poem, which I had tattooed:\n\nOn the battlefield is where you fell,\n\nA heroic story your legend will tell,\n\nA man so heroic, strong and bold,\n\nWe share a brotherhood that will never grow old,\n\nYou always thought with honour and pride,\n\nI felt so honoured to fight by your side,\n\nA hero of war you’ll forever be,\n\nMy brother, my friend, rest peacefully.”\n\nHis widow Katey: \"Sean loved the Army in every way. He was really into his fitness and enjoyed taking part in all the sporting challenges he could. He did the Devizes to Westminster canoe challenge a number of times and especially enjoyed being chased by a crazy swan en route. He also joined the rugby team, which I always thought was strange as he was a small-built man, but he said he enjoyed the buzz and hoped that by running fast enough no one would catch him. The social side was also really important to him; he would never turn down a night out with friends and, of course, a drink of port! He never turned down an invitation for anything. He was always enthusiastic about arranging days out and family get-togethers. Most weekends we were out and about having lunch with friends or family followed by a night on the town. He also had a strange love of ironing and would never be seen with a crease in his clothes. He loved walking the dogs and being in the countryside. He used to love getting involved in my job in a country park, helping out with all sorts from cleaning out the shire horses to working on a till taking money. He was always so chatty and warm and wanted to be everyone’s friend. He was regularly up and down the motorway visiting his mum, sisters and children. He always worried about them all and wanted to make sure they were all OK. We miss Sean every day but have comfort in knowing that he died doing something that he truly loved and was extremely important to him. Never forgotten and always in our hearts.\"\n\nHis colleague WO2 Kevin Rank RE: \"Although seven years have passed, the memories of you are still as fresh today as they were then. You were one person I could always call my mate, my comrade, my brother. I still raise a glass to honour you and I will continue to do so until we meet again, until then I know you are always beside me when I need you - I am sure you were during my last Afghanistan tour.\"\n\nHis partner Abbie Revill: \"He was very devoted to Lilly-Faith [his daughter, who was 18 months old when he died]. If you asked him to say one thing about himself, the first thing he would say is: 'I’ve got a daughter'. He was always talking about her.\n\n\"He found it very hard that he couldn’t come back much. He said: 'When I’m back from this tour, that’s it, I’m leaving the Army and spending the rest of my life with my daughter.' That was just before he passed away.\n\n\"He used to ring up to speak to Lilly-Faith every day when he was in Germany and every other day when he was in Afghanistan. He would do it on Skype so he could see her starting to crawl and the first time she said 'Dad'. I used to point the camera at her so he could see what she was like.\n\n\"He’d ask me how she was sleeping and whether she needed anything. He wanted to know every single thing. If she had a doctor’s appointment, he’d remember it the next week and ask how it had gone. That was amazing, because he had so much on his plate.\n\n\"We’ve made a memorial wall in her bedroom: there are two shelves full of his Army photos, pictures of them together and wooden ornaments he had made for her. She’ll say: 'Th"
