        "text": "Thwaites Glacier\n\nTed Scambos, Cooperative Institute for Research in Environmental Sciences (CIRES)\n\ntascambos@colorado.edu\n\nScambos studies the effects of climate change on the cryosphere, including one of the largest glaciers in the world: Antarctica’s Thwaites Glacier, which could be responsible for a significant part of sea level rise by the end of the century. He is the U.S. PI for the International Thwaites Glacier Collaboration Science Coordination Office.\n\nAGU highlight: “The Threat from Thwaites: The Retreat of Antarctica’s Riskiest Glacier”\n\n9 a.m. CST Dec. 13, press conference room and online through AGU's media center\n\nAtmospheric rivers\n\nJan Lenaerts, Department of Atmospheric and Oceanic Sciences\n\nJan.Lenaerts@colorado.edu\n\nLenaerts studies how polar regions are impacted by atmospheric rivers, or “rivers” in the sky that move warm air from wetter to drier locations. They’re important for the water cycle but can cause extreme precipitation or melting events. He leads the Ice Sheets and Climate lab at CU Boulder.\n\nAGU highlight: “The Contribution of Atmospheric Rivers to Antarctic Ice Sheet Snowfall”\n\n1:48 p.m. CST Dec. 16, Room 215–16\n\nClimate and weather modeling\n\nJennifer Kay, associate director for the CIRES Cryospheric and Polar Processes Division, associate professor of atmospheric and oceanic sciences and visiting scientist at the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR)\n\njennifer.e.kay@colorado.edu\n\nUsing global climate models, Kay examines projected Arctic sea ice loss, as well as changes in cloud and precipitation processes and ocean heat transport due to climate change. Her work also explores how integrating observations and models can help scientists better understand a rapidly changing Arctic.\n\nAGU highlight: “Less surface sea ice melt in the CESM2 improves Arctic sea ice simulation with minimal non-polar climate impacts”\n\n10:24 a.m. CST Dec. 17, Room 280–82\n\nArctic precipitation\n\nMark Serreze, director of the National Snow and Ice Data Center (NSIDC), distinguished professor of geography and CIRES fellow\n\nserreze@kryos.colorado.edu\n\nIn early 2020, NSIDC launched Snow Today, a website providing monthly insight into snow conditions and daily near-real-time data across the Western United States. Serreze is a co-author on new research in Nature Communications that finds more rain than snow will fall in the Arctic sooner than expected.\n\nAGU highlight: “Snow Today at the National Snow and Ice Data Center”\n\n1:07 p.m. CST Dec. 16, Room 211–13\n\nMonitoring methane emissions\n\nCaroline Alden, CIRES research scientist and Co-Founder LongPath Technologies, Inc.\n\ncaroline.alden@colorado.edu\n\nAlden’s work focuses on using trace gas measurements in the atmosphere to address carbon monitoring and carbon-climate mitigation challenges. LongPath Technologies Inc. uses Nobel Prize-winning technology to monitor and quantify methane emissions in real time.\n\nAGU highlight: “Network-based continuous methane emissions monitoring mitigates gas losses at scale”\n\n4–6 p.m. CST Dec. 14, Poster Hall D-F\n\nColorado River drought\n\nBalaji Rajagopalan, Cooperative Institute for Research in Environmental Sciences (CIRES) and professor of civil, environmental and architectural engineering\n\nbalajir@colorado.edu\n\nRajagopalan uses historical records and reconstructions to better understand and contextualize drought and climate change in the Colorado River Basin and across India, which helps stakeholders in these basins devise efficient water management strategies.\n\nAGU highlight: “How unprecedented is the current Colorado River drought?—a paleo perspective”\n\n1 p.m. CST Dec. 14, Room 203–05\n\nSpace weather\n\nDaniel Baker, director of the Laboratory for Atmospheric and Space Physics (LASP)\n\ndaniel.baker@lasp.colorado.edu\n\nBaker explores the connections between Earth and the sun, and the potential dangers that space weather poses to human society. He has served as an investigator on several NASA missions, including the Magnetospheric Multiscale (MMS) and the Van Allen Probes missions.\n\nAGU Highlight: “The Earth’s Radiation Belts: Lessons Learned From the Van Allen Probes Mission”\n\n10:20 a.m. CST Dec. 14, Room 388-390\n\nMars and exoplanets\n\nDavid Brain, Laboratory for Atmospheric and Space Physics (LASP)\n\ndavid.brain@colorado.edu\n\nBrain examines how the atmospheres of planets like Mars, Venus and others beyond our solar system evolve over time, insights that may help to shape the search for life on alien worlds. He recently launched an effort to study how magnetic fields may help—or not help— planets hang onto their atmospheres.\n\nAGU Highlight: “Atmospheric Escape Rates from Mars—If It Orbited an M Dwarf Star”\n\n4–6 p.m. CST Dec. 13, Poster Hall D-F\n\nAsteroids\n\nDaniel Scheeres, Ann & H.J. Smead Department of Aerospace Engineering Sciences\n\nscheeres@colorado.edu\n\nScheeres has investigated the dynamics of how asteroids move through space through his work on NASA’s OSIRIS-REx and Japan’s Hyabusa missions. He is leading the Janus mission, which will launch in 2022 and send twin small spacecraft to rendezvous with two pairs of binary asteroids.\n\nAGU Highlight: “Probing the structure and dynamics of NEO binary asteroids using targeted flybys: The Janus Mission”\n\n4:10 p.m. CST Dec. 13, eLightning Theater V\n\nJupiter and beyond\n\nFran Bagenal, Laboratory for Atmospheric and Space Physics (LASP)\n\nfran.bagenal@lasp.colorado.edu\n\nBagenal has studied planetary bodies throughout the solar system, from Jupiter and its moons to Pluto and Arrokoth, through NASA missions like Voyager, Galileo, Juno and New Horizons. She will also take part in NASA’s upcoming Europa Clipper mission.\n\nAGU Highlight: “Range of Plasma Conditions at Ganymede”\n\n4–6 p.m. CST Dec. 14, Poster Hall D-F\n\nCosmic dust\n\nMihály Horányi, Laboratory for Atmospheric and Space Physics (LASP)\n\nhoranyi@colorado.edu\n\nHorányi leads the Institute for Modeling Plasmas, Atmospheres, and Cosmic Dust (IMPACT), which studies how dust streams through space and can even damage spacecraft when they collide. He and his colleagues have explored the dust and plasma environments around the moon, Saturn’s rings, the Kuiper Belt and more.\n\nAGU Highlight: “The Lunar Meteoroid Monitor (LMM)”\n\n8:25 a.m. CST Dec. 17, Room 395-396"
