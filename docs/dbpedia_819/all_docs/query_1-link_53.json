        "text": "We invite you to explore our website and learn more about our courses, research projects, team members, and resources. If you have any questions or interests in our work, please don't hesitate to contact us. Thank you for visiting our page!\n\nOur Aims\n\nTo establish a world-class medical physics research institution that collaborates closely with clinical teams at affiliated hospitals to identify and address clinical needs.\n\nTo foster a culture of innovation and creativity within the research institution, encouraging interdisciplinary collaboration across various scientific disciplines to develop cutting-edge technology that can be applied to clinical problems in imaging and radiation therapy.\n\nTo promote strong clinical translation of research findings into clinical practice, ensuring that patients benefit from the latest advances in medical physics to improve patient outcomes.\n\nTo provide training and education opportunities for students, researchers, and clinicians interested in medical physics, developing new talent to drive the field forward.\n\nTo build strong partnerships with other research institutions to leverage resources and expertise and advance the field of medical physics.\n\nGraduate Programs\n\nStudents wishing to study medical physics with us may undertake either a coursework program towards the award of a Master of Medical Physics degree or a Graduate Diploma in Medical Physics, or a research program towards the award of a Doctor of Philosophy or a Master of Science.\n\nScholarships\n\nThe University of Sydney offers a limited number of CSP awards which are highly competitive. Browse the University's full range of scholarships for additional options.\n\nOther opportunities that you may want to look into are:\n\nAINSE Pathway Scholarship\n\nAnd for female physicists:\n\nThe IAEA Marie Skłodowska-Curie Fellowship Programme\n\nCOPPER\n\n(Collaborative Online Platform for Physics Experts in Radiation)\n\nCOPPER is an online sharing and collaboration platform aimed at radiation oncology and diagnostic imaging medical physicists. COPPER provides a forum for physicists to share a wide range of items. Access is limited to health professionals. To request access, please email Liz Claridge Mackonis. All users are encouraged to contribute content to share on the site. Watch this video for more information.\n\nVisit COPPER\n\nJournal Club\n\nOnce per month, the IMP holds a Journal Club for its students as well as the wider ACPSEM community. The slides from each presentation will be uploaded below:\n\n7th March 2024 - Dr Sirisha Tadimalla\n\n16th April 2024 - Dr Laura O'Connor\n\nR&D Workshop 2024\n\nDate: 16th August\n\nRegistration:\n\nClick here for non-members of the ACPSEM\n\nClick here for members of the ACPSEM\n\nDetails: All NSW Medical Physicists are invited to give a short presentation (one per centre) on their in-house research and development projects. We will have a particular focus on COPPER and AI. This event will be held at the University of Sydney. There will be an option to attend in-person or by Zoom. This event is free.\n\nClick here for the latest draft program. Please note that times are likely to change but this gives an idea of start/finish times for travel bookings.\n\nMedPhys24\n\nDate: 5th December\n\nRegistration: Coming soon\n\nDetails: This annual ACPSEM event, run in collaboration with the University of Sydney, provides an opportunity for all NSW/ACT medical physics students and TEAPs to present their work. As always, generous prizes will be on offer. This is a great networking event with everyone invited to attend.\n\nLeadership Course – Leading Self, Others and Teams\n\nDetails: As part of our NSW Ministry of Health (MoH) collaboration, the Institute of Medical Physics partnered with the University of Sydney Centre for Continuing Education to run a one-day leadership course for medical physicists.\n\nThe first leadership course was a great success. If you would like be kept informed of future courses, please contact Sarah Alnaghy at sarah.alnaghy@sydney.edu.au"
