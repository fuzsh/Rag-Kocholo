        "text": "British Army officer (1864–1922)\n\nNot to be confused with Henry Maitland Wilson.\n\nField Marshal Sir Henry Hughes Wilson, 1st Baronet, (5 May 1864 – 22 June 1922) was one of the most senior British Army staff officers of the First World War and was briefly an Irish unionist politician.\n\nWilson served as Commandant of the Staff College, Camberley, and then as Director of Military Operations at the War Office, playing a vital role in drawing up plans to deploy an Expeditionary Force to France in the event of war. He acquired a reputation as a political intriguer for his role in agitating for the introduction of conscription and the Curragh incident of 1914.\n\nAs Sub Chief of Staff to the British Expeditionary Force (BEF), Wilson was Sir John French's most important advisor during the 1914 campaign, but his poor relations with Haig and Robertson saw him sidelined from top decision-making in the middle years of the war. He played an important role in Anglo-French military relations in 1915 and – after his only experience of field command as a corps commander in 1916[1] – as an ally of the controversial French General Robert Nivelle in early 1917. Later in 1917 he was informal military advisor to British Prime Minister David Lloyd George, and then British Permanent Military Representative at the Supreme War Council at Versailles. In 1918 Wilson served as Chief of the Imperial General Staff (the professional head of the British Army). He continued to hold this position after the war, a time when the Army was being sharply reduced in size whilst attempting to contain industrial unrest in the UK and nationalist unrest in Mesopotamia and Egypt. He also played an important role in the Irish War of Independence.\n\nAfter retiring from the army Wilson served briefly as a Member of Parliament, and as security advisor to the Northern Ireland government. He was assassinated by two IRA gunmen in 1922.\n\nFamily background\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Wilson family claimed to have arrived in Carrickfergus with William of Orange in 1690, but may well have lived in the area prior to that. They prospered, as Ulster Protestants, in the Belfast shipping business in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth century and, following the Encumbered Estates Act of 1849, became landowners. Wilson's father James, the youngest of four sons, inherited Currygrane in Ballinalee (1,200 acres, worth £835 in 1878), making him a middle-ranking landowner. James Wilson served as a High sheriff, a Justice of the peace and Deputy Lieutenant for Longford, and attended Trinity College Dublin. As late as the 1960s the IRA leader Seán Mac Eoin remembered the Wilsons as having been fair landlords and employers.[2] The Wilsons also owned Frascati, an eighteenth-century house at Blackrock, Dublin.[3]\n\nBorn at Currygrane, Henry Wilson was the second of James and Constant Wilson's four sons (he also had three sisters). He attended Marlborough public school between September 1877 and Easter 1880, before leaving for a crammer to prepare for the Army. One of Wilson's younger brothers also became an army officer and the other a land agent.[4]\n\nWilson spoke with an Irish accent and at times regarded himself as British, Irish or an Ulsterman. Like many of his era, including Anglo-Irish or Ulster-Scots, he often referred to Britain as \"England\". His biographer Keith Jeffery suggests that he may well, like many Anglo-Irish, have played up his \"Irishness\" in England and regarded himself as more \"Anglo-\" while in Ireland, and may well also have agreed with his brother Jemmy's view that Ireland was not \"homogenous\" enough to be \"a Nation.\"[5] Wilson was a devout member of the Church of Ireland, and on occasion attended Catholic services, but disliked \"Romish\" ritual.[5]\n\nEarly career\n\n[edit]\n\nJunior officer\n\n[edit]\n\nBetween 1881 and 1882 Wilson made several unsuccessful attempts to get into the British Army officer-training establishments: two to enter the Royal Military Academy (Woolwich) and three for the Royal Military College. The entrance examinations to both relied heavily on rote learning. Sir John Fortescue later claimed that this was because as a tall boy he needed \"time for his brain to develop\".[7][8]\n\nLike French and Spears, among others, Wilson acquired his commission \"by the back door\", as it was then known, by first becoming a militia officer. In December 1882 he joined the Longford Militia, which was also the 6th (Militia) Battalion of the Rifle Brigade. He also trained with the 5th Battalion, Royal Munster Fusiliers.[9][10] After two periods of training he was eligible to apply for a regular commission, and after further cramming in the winter of 1883–84, and trips to Algiers and Darmstadt to learn French and German, he sat the Army exam in July 1884. He was commissioned into the Royal Irish Regiment, but soon transferred into the more prestigious Rifle Brigade.[9][11][12]\n\nEarly in 1885 Wilson was posted with the 1st Battalion of the Rifle Brigade to India, where he took up polo and big game hunting. In November 1886 he was posted to the Upper Irawaddy, just south of Mandalay, in recently annexed Burma to take part in the Third Burmese War, whose counter-insurgency operations in the Arakan Hills became known as \"the subalterns' war\". The British troops were organised into mounted infantry, accompanied by \"Goorkha police\". Wilson worked with Henry Rawlinson of the King's Royal Rifle Corps (KRRC), who described him in his diary as \"a very good chap\". On 5 May 1887 he was wounded above the left eye. The wound did not heal and after six months in Calcutta he spent almost the whole of 1888 recuperating in Ireland until he was passed fit for regimental duty. He was left disfigured.[13] His wound earned him the nicknames \"Ugly Wilson\" and \"the ugliest man in the British Army\".[8]\n\nMarriage\n\n[edit]\n\nWhile in Ireland Wilson began courting Cecil Mary Wray, who was two years his senior. Her family, who had come over to Ireland late in Elizabeth I's reign, had owned an estate called Ardamona near Lough Eske, Donegal, the profitability of which had never recovered from the Great Famine of Ireland of the 1840s. On 26 December 1849 two kegs of explosive were set off outside the house, after which the family only ever spent one more winter there. From 1850 Cecil's father George Wray had worked as a land agent, latterly for Lord Drogheda's estates in Kildare, until his death in 1878. Cecil grew up in straitened circumstances, and her views on Irish politics appear to have been rather more hardline than her husband's. They were married on 3 October 1891.[14]\n\nThe Wilsons were childless.[15] Wilson lavished affection on their pets (including a dog \"Paddles\") and other people's children. They gave a home to young Lord Guilford in 1895–1896 and Cecil's niece Leonora (\"Little Trench\") from December 1902.[16]\n\nStaff College\n\n[edit]\n\nWhile contemplating marriage, Wilson began to study for the Staff College, Camberley, in 1888, possibly as attendance at Staff College was not only cheaper than service with a smart regiment but also opened up the possibility of promotion. At this time Wilson had a private income of £200 a year from a £6,000 trust fund. At the end of 1888 Wilson was passed fit for home (but not overseas) service, and joined the 2nd battalion at Dover early in 1889.[17] Wilson was elected to White's in 1889.[18]\n\nAfter a posting to Aldershot, Wilson was posted to Belfast in May 1890. In May 1891 he passed 15th (out of 25) into Staff College. French and German were amongst his worst subjects, and he began study there in January 1892.[17] After his difficulty in entering the Army, passing the entrance exam proved that he did not lack brains.[8]\n\nColonel Henry Hildyard became Staff College Commandant in August 1893, beginning a reform of the institution, placing more emphasis on continuous assessment (including outdoor exercises) rather than examinations. Wilson also studied under Colonel George Henderson.[19] Whilst at the College he visited the battlefields of the Franco-Prussian War in March 1893.[20] Rawlinson and Thomas D'Oyly Snow were often his study partners. Rawlinson and Wilson became close friends, often staying and socialising together, and Rawlinson introduced Wilson to Lord Roberts in May 1893, whilst both men were working on a scheme for the defence of India.[19] Wilson became a protégé of Roberts.[8]\n\nStaff officer\n\n[edit]\n\nWilson graduated from Staff College in December 1893 and was immediately promoted captain.[21] He was due to be posted with the 3rd Battalion to India early in 1894, but after extensive and unsuccessful lobbying he obtained a medical postponement. He then learned that he was to join the 1st Battalion in Hong Kong for two years, but swapped with another captain – who then died on his tour of duty. There is no clear evidence as to why Wilson was so keen to avoid overseas service. Repington, then a staff captain in the Intelligence Section at the War Office, took Wilson on a tour of French military and naval installations in July. After a very brief service with his regiment in September, with Repington's help Wilson came to work at the War Office in November 1894, initially as an unpaid assistant, then succeeding to Repington's own job.[22]\n\nThe Intelligence Division had been developed by General Henry Brackenbury in the late 1880s into a sort of substitute General Staff; Brackenbury had been succeeded by Roberts protégé General Edward Chapman in April 1891.[23] Wilson worked there for three years from November 1894.[24][23][25][26] From November 1895 Wilson found time to assist Rawlinson with his \"Officer's Note Book\" based on a previous book by Lord Wolseley, and which inspired the official \"Field Service Pocket Book\".[23]\n\nWilson worked in Section A (France, Belgium, Italy, Spain, Portugal and Latin America). In April 1895, despite intensive tutoring of up to three hours most days, he failed an exam in German for a posting to Berlin. On 5 May 1895, he took over from Repington as staff captain of section A, making him the youngest staff officer in the British Army. His duties took him to Paris (June 1895, to inquire about the expedition to Borgu on the Upper Niger) and Brussels.[27] In January 1896 he seemed likely to be appointed brigade major of the 2nd brigade at Aldershot if the current incumbent, Jack Cowans, a notorious womaniser with a penchant for \"rough trade\", resigned, although in the event this did not happen until early September.[28]\n\nBoer War\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Second Boer War\n\nBelieving war with the Transvaal \"very likely\" from spring 1897, Wilson canvassed for a place in any expeditionary force. That spring he helped Major H. P. Northcott, head of the British Empire section in the Intelligence Division, draw up a plan \"for knocking Kruger's head off\". Leo Amery later claimed that Wilson and Lieutenant Dawnay helped Roberts draw up what would become his eventual plan for invading the Boer republics from the west. He received a medal for riding in Queen Victoria's Diamond Jubilee procession, but regretted that he had not won a war medal.[29] To his regret, and unlike his friend Rawlinson, Wilson missed out on a posting to the 1898 Sudan Expedition.[28] When tensions mounted again in the summer of 1899,[29] Wilson was appointed brigade major of the 3rd brigade, now renamed the 4th or \"Light\" brigade at Aldershot,[30] which from 9 October was under the command of Neville Lyttelton. War was declared on 11 October 1899, and he arrived at Cape Town on 18 November.[29]\n\nWilson's brigade was amongst the troops sent to Natal – by late November it was encamped on the Mooi River, 509 miles from besieged Ladysmith. Wilson's brigade took part in the Battle of Colenso (15 December), in which British troops, advancing after an inadequate artillery bombardment, were shot down by entrenched and largely hidden Boers armed with magazine rifles.[31]Buller, who was still in command in Natal despite having been replaced by Roberts as Commander-in-Chief, was awaiting the arrival of Sir Charles Warren's 5th Division. Artillery fire at the siege of Ladysmith could still be heard from Buller's positions, but he rejected a proposal by Wilson that the Light Brigade cross the Tugela River at Potgieter's Drift, 15 miles upstream. Wilson was critical both of the delay since 16 December and of Buller's failure to share information with Lyttelton and other senior officers. Buller allowed Lyttleton to cross at that spot on 16 January, with the bulk of his reinforced forces crossing unopposed at Trikhardt's Drift 5 miles upstream the following day.[32] Wilson took credit for the Light Brigade's diversionary artillery fire during the Trikhardt's Drift crossing.[33]\n\nDuring the ensuing Battle of Spion Kop (24 January), Wilson was critical of Buller's lack of a proper staff, of his lack of communication, and of his interference with Warren whom he had placed in charge. In an account written after the battle he claimed to have wanted to draw off pressure by sending two battalions – the Scottish Rifles (Cameronians) and 60th King's Royal Rifle Corps, as well as Bethune's Buccaneers (a Mounted Infantry unit), to occupy the Sugar Loaf two miles East-North-East of Spion Kop, where Warren's men were under fire from three sides. Lyttelton – 25 years later – claimed that Wilson had suggested to him to send reinforcements to help Warren. Wilson's contemporary diary is ambiguous, claiming that \"we\" had sent the 60th to take the Sugar Loaf, whilst Bethune's men and the Rifles went to assist Warren, and that as the Kop became crowded Lyttelton refused Wilson's request to send the Rifles to the Sugar Loaf to assist the 60th.[34]\n\nAfter the defeat, Wilson was once again scornful of Buller's lack of progress and of his predictions that he would be in Ladysmith by 5 February. Leo Amery later told a malicious story that Wilson had suggested gathering the brigade majors together to arrest their commanding general, although Wilson in fact seems to have thought highly of Lyttelton at this time. He was also highly critical of Fitzroy Hart (\"perfect disgrace … quite mad & incapable under fire\"), commanding general of the Irish Brigade, for attacking Inniskilling Hill in close order on 24 February (see Battle of the Tugela Heights), and, on the same day, leaving the Durham Light Infantry (part of the Light Brigade) exposed to attack (Wilson visited the position, and they were withdrawn on 27 February after Wilson lobbied Lyttelton and Warren), and for leaving Wilson to organise a defence against a Boer night attack on Light Brigade HQ after refusing Light Brigade requests to post pickets. The Light Brigade finally took Inniskilling Hill on 27 February and Ladysmith was relieved the following day, allowing Wilson to meet his old friend Rawlinson, who had been besieged there, again.[35] After the relief of Ladysmith, Wilson continued to be highly critical of the poor state of logistics and of the weak leadership of Buller and Dundonald. After the Fall of Pretoria he correctly predicted that the Boers would turn to guerrilla warfare, although he did not expect the war to last until spring 1902.[36]\n\nIn August 1900 Wilson was summoned to see \"the Chief\" and appointed to assist Rawlinson at the Adjutant-General's branch, choosing to remain there rather than return to his brigade-majorship (which passed to his brother Tono). Part of Wilson's motivation was his desire to return home earlier. He shared a house in Pretoria with Rawlinson and Eddie Stanley (later Lord Derby), Roberts' secretary – they were all in their mid-thirties and socialised with Roberts' daughters, then aged 24 and 29.[37] Wilson was appointed Deputy Assistant Adjutant-General (1 September 1900)[38] and Roberts' assistant military secretary in September, which meant that he returned home with Roberts in December. Lyttelton had wanted him in South Africa on his staff, whilst Kelly-Kenny wanted him on the staff of Southern Command which he was hoping to obtain.[37]\n\nRepington divorce\n\n[edit]\n\nOn 9 October 1899 Lieutenant Colonel Repington, for the sake of his career, gave Wilson his written promise to give up his mistress Mary Garstin. Wilson had been a friend of Mary Garstin's father, who had died in 1893, and she was a cousin of his friend Lady Guilford, who asked Wilson to get involved at Christmas 1898. On 12 February 1900 Repington told him that he regarded himself as absolved from his parole after learning that her husband had been spreading rumours of his other infidelities. During the divorce hearings Wilson refused Repington's request to sign an account of what had been said at their meeting, and was unable to grant the request of Kelly-Kenny (Adjutant-General to the Forces) for an account of the meeting as he had written no details of it in his diary (Lady Guilford had destroyed the letter which he had written her containing details). He was thus unable or unwilling to confirm Repington's claim that he had released him from his parole. Repington believed that Wilson had \"ratted\" on a fellow soldier. Army gossip later had it that Wilson had deliberately ratted out a potential career rival. Repington had to resign his commission.[39][40]\n\nEdwardian period\n\n[edit]\n\nWar Office\n\n[edit]\n\nIn 1901 Wilson spent nine months working under Ian Hamilton in the War Office, working to allocate honours and awards from the recent South African War. He himself received a Mentioned in Despatches[41] and a Distinguished Service Order,[24][42] which Aylmer Haldane later claimed Wilson had insisted on receiving out of jealousy that he had been awarded it.[43] Wilson was also recommended for brevet promotion to lieutenant colonel on attaining a substantive majority.[44]\n\nBetween March and May 1901, at the behest of the Liberal Unionist MP Sir William Rattigan, and against the backdrop of St John Brodrick's proposed Army reforms, Wilson – writing anonymously as \"a Staff Officer\" – published a series of twelve articles on Army Reform in the Lahore Civil and Military Gazette. He argued that given the recent great growth in the size of the Empire Britain could no longer rely on the Royal Navy alone. Wilson argued that the three main roles of the Army were home defence, defence of India (against Russia), Egypt and Canada (against the US, with whom Wilson nonetheless hoped Britain would remain on friendly terms), and defence of major coaling stations and ports for the Royal Navy's use. Unlike St John Brodrick, Wilson at this stage explicitly ruled out Britain becoming involved in a European war. Without her major colonies, he argued, Britain would suffer \"the fate of Spain\". He wanted 250,000 men to be made available for overseas service, not the 120,000 proposed by Brodrick, and contemplated the introduction of conscription (which had been ruled out by the Liberal Opposition).[45] In private Wilson – partly motivated by the poor performance of ill-trained Yeomanry units in South Africa – and other War Office officers were less complimentary about Brodrick's proposed reforms.[46]\n\nBattalion commander\n\n[edit]\n\nWilson gained both the substantive promotion to major and the promised brevet in December 1901,[47] and in 1902 became Commanding Officer of the 9th Provisional Battalion, Rifle Brigade at Colchester,[24][48] intended to supply drafts for the South African War, then still in progress. The battalion was disbanded in February 1903.[49]\n\nMilitary education and training\n\n[edit]\n\nWilson went back to the War Office as Rawlinson's assistant at the Department of Military Education and Training under General Sir Henry Hildyard. The three men led a committee which worked on a \"Manual of Combined Training\" and a \"Staff Manual\" which formed the basis of Field Service Regulations Part II, which was to be in force when the Army went to war in August 1914.[50] With £1,600 borrowed from his father, Wilson bought a house off Marylebone Road.[50] In 1903 he became an Assistant Adjutant-General.[51]\n\nAt this time Wilson was becoming friendly with political figures such as Arthur Balfour, Winston Churchill, Leo Amery and Leo Maxse.[16] Some of St John Brodrick's proposed reforms were criticised by the Elgin Report in August 1903. Brodrick was being attacked in Parliament by Conservative MPs, including Amery, to whom Wilson was feeding information.[52]\n\nEsher reforms and General Staff\n\n[edit]\n\nOn Leo Amery's suggestion Wilson's colleague Gerald Ellison was appointed Secretary of the War Office (Reconstitution) Committee (see Esher Report), which consisted of Esher, Admiral John Fisher and Sir George Clarke. Wilson approved of Esher's aims, but not the whirlwind speed by which he began making changes at the War Office. Wilson impressed Esher, and was put in charge of the new department which managed Staff College, RMA, RMC and officers' promotion exams.[53] Wilson often travelled around Britain and Ireland to supervise the training of officers and examinations for promotion.[54]\n\nWilson attended the first ever General Staff Conference and Staff Ride at Camberley in January 1905.[55] He continued to lobby for a General Staff to be set up, especially after the Dogger Bank incident of October 1904. Wilson proposed a strong Chief of the General Staff who would be the Secretary of State for War's sole adviser on matters of strategy, ironically the position which would be held by Wilson's rival Robertson during the First World War.[56] Despite pressure from Repington, Esher and Sir George Clarke, progress on the General Staff was very slow. In August Brodrick's successor Arnold-Forster issued a minute similar to Wilson's of three months previous. Lyttelton (Chief of the General Staff), unaware of Wilson's role, expressed support. In November Wilson released Arnold-Forster's memo to the press, claiming he had been ordered to do so; Arnold-Forster initially expressed \"amazement\" but then agreed that the leak had \"done nothing but good\".[57]\n\nThe Wilsons had Christmas Dinner with Roberts in 1904 and 1905. Wilson assisted Roberts with his House of Lords speeches, and the closeness of their relationship attracted disapproval from Lyttelton, and possibly French and Arnold-Forster. Relations with Lyttelton became more strained in 1905–06, possibly out of jealousy or influenced by Repington.[58] Wilson had predicted a hung Parliament in January 1906, but to his disgust, \"that traitor C.B.\" had won a landslide.[55][59]\n\nThere was a war scare in May 1906 when the Turks occupied an old Egyptian fort at the head of the Gulf of Aqaba. Wilson noted that Grierson (Director of Military Operations) and Lyttelton (\"absolutely incapable … positively a dangerous fool\") had approved the proposed scheme for military action, but neither the Adjutant-General nor the Quartermaster-General had been consulted.[60] Repington wrote to Esher that Wilson was an \"intriguing impostor\" and \"a low-class schemer whose sole aptitude is for worshipping rising suns – an aptitude expressed by those who know him in more vulgar language\".[61] On 12 September 1906 Army Order 233 set up a General Staff to supervise education and training and to draw up war plans (Wilson had drafted an Army Order late in 1905, but it had been held up by disputes over whether staff officers should be appointed by the Chief of the General Staff as Wilson preferred or by an eleven-man selection board).[60]\n\nCommandant, Staff College\n\n[edit]\n\nAppointment\n\n[edit]\n\nWilson had hoped, as early as March 1905, to succeed Rawlinson as Commandant at Staff College, Camberley. In July Lyttelton (Chief of the General Staff), who appears to have disliked Wilson, raised the job to a brigadier-general's position, for which Wilson was not yet senior enough.[62]\n\nOn 16 July 1906 Rawlinson told Wilson that he wanted him to succeed him at the end of the year, and the news appeared in the press in August amidst praise for Rawlinson, suggesting that he rather than Wilson had leaked it. Field Marshal Roberts wrote to Richard Haldane (Secretary of State for War) and Esher recommending Wilson on the basis of his excellent staff work in South Africa, and as a strong character needed to maintain Rawlinson's improvements at Camberley. Wilson, who learned indirectly from Aylmer Haldane on 24 October that he was to get the job, wrote to thank Roberts, and was in little doubt that his support had clinched it for him. Wilson remained very close to Roberts, often joining him for Christmas Dinner and attending his Golden Wedding in May 1909.[63] French (then commanding 1st Army Corps at Aldershot Command) had initially been suspicious of Wilson as a Roberts protégé, but now supported his candidacy, and by 1912 Wilson had become his most trusted adviser.[64]\n\nWilson was promoted to substantive colonel on 1 January 1907[65] and his appointment as temporary brigadier-general and Commandant Staff College, Camberley, was announced on 8 January 1907.[66] He was at first short of money – he had to borrow £350 (£46768 in 2016) to cover the expense of moving to Camberley, where his official salary was not enough to cover the cost of entertaining expected – and initially had to cut back on foreign holidays and social trips to London but after inheriting £1,300 on his father's death in August 1907 was able to buy polo ponies and a second car in subsequent years.[67] His pay as commandant rose from £1,200 in 1907 to £1,350 in 1910.[68]\n\nDoctrine\n\n[edit]\n\nIn speeches to students, Wilson stressed the need for administrative knowledge (\"the drudgery of staffwork\"), physical fitness, imagination, \"sound judgement of men & affairs\" and \"constant reading & reflexion on the campaigns of the great masters\". Brian Bond argued that Wilson's \"School of Thought\" meant not just common training for staff officers but also espousal of conscription and the military commitment to send a BEF to France in the event of war. Keith Jeffery argues that this is a misunderstanding by Bond: there is no evidence in Wilson's writings to confirm that he meant the phrase in that way.[69]\n\nAlthough Wilson was less obsessed about the dangers of espionage than Edmonds, in March 1908 he had two German barbers removed as potential spies from Staff College.[70]\n\nWilson was appointed a Companion of the Order of the Bath in the June 1908 Birthday Honours.[68]\n\nIn 1908 Wilson had his senior class prepare a scheme for the deployment of an Expeditionary Force to France, assuming Germany to have invaded Belgium. Questions were asked in the House of Commons when news of this leaked out, and the following year no assumption was made of a German invasion of Belgium, and students were sharply reminded that the exercise was \"SECRET\".[71] Wilson first met Foch on a visit to the Ecole Superieur de Guerre (December 1909). They struck up a good rapport, and both thought the Germans would attack between Verdun and Namur.[72][73] Wilson arranged for Foch and Victor Huguet to visit Britain in June 1910, and copied his practice of setting students outdoor exercises in which they were distracted by instructors shouting \"Allez! Allez!\" and \"Vite! Vite!\" at them whilst they were attempting to draw up plans at short notice.[72]\n\nAccompanied by Colonel Harper, Wilson reconnoitred the likely future theatre of war. In August 1908, along with Edward Percival (\"Perks\"), they explored south of Namur by train and bicycle. In August 1909, Harper and Wilson travelled from Mons then down the French frontier almost as far as Switzerland. In spring 1910, this time by motor car, they travelled from Rotterdam into Germany, then explored the German side of the frontier, noting the new railway lines and \"many sidings\" which had been built near St Vith and Bitburg (to allow concentration of German troops near the Ardennes).[74][75]\n\nWilson privately supported conscription at least as early as 1905. He thought Haldane's scheme to merge Militia, Yeomanry and Volunteers into a new Territorial Army would not be enough to match German training and efficiency.[76] Wilson successfully lobbied Haldane for an increase in the size of the Staff College to provide officers for the new Territorial Army. During Wilson's tenure the number of instructors rose from 7 to 16 and the number of students from 64 to 100. In total, 224 Army and 22 Royal Navy officers studied under him.[68]\n\nWilson voted for Parliament for the first time in January 1910 (for the Unionists).[77][78] He recorded that \"the lies told by the Radicals from Asquith down are revolting\".[79]\n\nLecturing style\n\n[edit]\n\nLauncelot Kiggell wrote that Wilson was a \"spell-binding\" lecturer as Commandant at Camberley.[8] During his time as Commandant, Wilson gave 33 lectures. A number of students, of whom the most famous was Archibald Wavell, later contrasted Wilson's expansive lecturing, ranging widely and wittily over geopolitics, with the more practical focus of his successor Robertson. Many of these recollections are unreliable in their details, may well exaggerate the differences between the two men, and may have been influenced by Wilson's indiscreet diaries published in the 1920s.[80]\n\nBerkeley Vincent, who had been an observer in the Russo-Japanese War (he was a protégé of Ian Hamilton, whom Wilson appears to have disliked), took a more critical view of Wilson. He objected to Wilson's tactical views – Wilson was sceptical of claims that Japanese morale had enabled their infantry to overcome Russian defensive firepower – and his lecturing style: \"a sort of witty buffoonery … a sort of English stage Irishman\".[81]\n\nSuccession\n\n[edit]\n\nIn May and June 1909 Wilson had been tipped to succeed Haig as Director of Staff Duties, although he would have preferred command of a brigade.[68] In April and May 1910, with his term of office at Camberley still officially running until January 1911, the Chief of the Imperial General Staff (CIGS), William Nicholson, told Wilson that he was to succeed Spencer Ewart as Director of Military Operations that summer and vetoed him from accepting Horace Smith-Dorrien's offer of a brigade at Aldershot.[82] King George V rounded off Wilson's tenure at Camberley with an official visit in July 1910.[68]\n\nWilson recommended Kiggell as his successor and thought the appointment of William Robertson \"a tremendous gamble\". He may have felt that Robertson's lack of private means did not suit him for a position which required entertaining.[83] Robertson visited Camberley with Lord Kitchener (28 July 1910), who criticised Wilson; this may have been one of the causes of the poor relations between Wilson and Kitchener in August 1914.[84] Edmonds later told a story of how Wilson had left a bill for £250 for furniture and improvements to the Commandant's residence, and that Wilson's predecessor Rawlinson, when approached by Robertson for advice, had commented that many of these improvements had been made by his own wife or by previous Commandants. Whatever the truth of the matter, relations between Wilson and Robertson deteriorated thereafter.[85]\n\nRepington (whom Wilson thought a \"lying brute\") attacked the current standards of British staff officers in The Times on 27 September 1910, arguing that Wilson had educated staff officers to be \"sucking Napoleons\" and that Robertson was a \"first rate man\" who would sort it out.[86]\n\nDirector of Military Operations\n\n[edit]\n\nInitial decisions\n\n[edit]\n\nIn 1910 Wilson became Director of Military Operations at the British War Office.[75][87] Wilson believed his most important duty as DMO to be the drawing up of detailed plans for deployment of an expeditionary force to France. Little progress had been made in this area since Grierson's plans during the First Moroccan Crisis.[8][88] Of the 36 papers which Wilson wrote as DMO, 21 were taken up by matters pertaining to the Expeditionary Force. He hoped also to get conscription brought in, but this came to nothing.[89]\n\nWilson described the size of Haldane's planned Expeditionary Force as simply a \"reshuffle\" of the troops available in Britain.[90] Ferdinand Foch was keen to enlist British military aid. He invited Wilson and Colonel Fairholme, British military attaché in Paris, to his daughter's wedding in October 1910. On a visit to London (6 December 1910) Wilson took him for a meeting with Sir Arthur Nicolson, Permanent-Under Secretary at the Foreign Office.[91]\n\nIn 1910 Wilson bought 36 Eaton Place on a 13-year lease for £2,100. His salary was then £1,500. The house was a financial burden and the Wilsons often let it out.[92]\n\nWilson and his staff spent the winter of 1910–11 conducting a \"great strategical War Game\" to predict what the great powers would do when war broke out.[93]\n\nEarly 1911\n\n[edit]\n\nWilson thought the existing plans for deployment of the BEF (known as the \"WF\" scheme – this stood for \"With France\" but was sometimes wrongly thought to stand for \"Wilson-Foch\") \"disgraceful. A pure academic, paper arrangement of no earthly value\". He sent Nicholson a long minute demanding authority over transport planning. He was given this after a lunch with Haldane.[94]\n\nOn 27–28 January 1911, Wilson visited Brussels, dining with members of the Belgian General Staff, and later exploring the part of the country south of the Meuse with the military attaché Colonel Tom Bridges.[95] Between 17 and 27 February, he visited Germany, meeting Chancellor Bethmann Hollweg and Admiral Tirpitz at a dinner at the British Embassy. On the return journey he dined in Paris with Foch, whom he warned against listening to Repington, and the French Chief of Staff General Laffort de Ladibat.[96] Admiral John Fisher was hostile to Wilson's plans to deploy forces to the continent.[97] By 21 March Wilson was preparing plans to embark the BEF infantry by Day 4 of mobilisation, followed by the cavalry on Day 7 and the artillery on Day 9.[98] Refusing Nicholson's request (April 1911) that he help with Repington's new Army Review, he declared him \"a man devoid of honour, & a liar\".[96]\n\nSecond Moroccan crisis\n\n[edit]\n\nWilson sat up till midnight on 4 July (three days after the German gunboat Panther arrived at Agadir in an attempt to overawe the French) writing a long minute to the CIGS. On 19 July he went to Paris for talks with Adolphe Messimy (French War Minister) and General Dubail (French Chief of Staff). The Wilson-Dubail memorandum, although making explicit that neither government was committed to action, promised that in the event of war the Royal Navy would transport 150,000 men to Rouen, Le Havre and Boulogne, and that the BEF would concentrate between Arras, Cambrai and St Quentin by the thirteenth day of mobilisation. In reality, the transport plans were nowhere near ready, although it is unclear that the French knew this.[99][100] The French called the Expeditionary Force \"l'Armee Wilson\"[101] although they seem to have been left with an inflated idea of the size of commitment which Britain would send.[102]\n\nWilson approved of Lloyd George's Mansion House speech (backing France).[103] He lunched with Grey and Sir Eyre Crowe (Assistant Under-Secretary at the Foreign Office) on 9 August, urging them that Britain must mobilise on the same day as France and send the whole six divisions.[104]\n\nCID meeting\n\n[edit]\n\nHankey complained of Wilson's \"perfect obsession for military operations on the Continent\", scoffing at his bicycling trips around the French and Belgian borders, and accusing him of filling the War Office with like-minded officers.[105] At Nicholson's request Wilson prepared a paper arguing that British aid would be necessary to prevent Germany defeating France and achieving domination of the continent. He argued that by Day 13 of mobilisation France would have the upper hand, outnumbering the Germans, but by Day 17 Germany would outnumber France. However, because of road bottlenecks in the passable parts of the war theatre, the Germans would at most be able to deploy 54 divisions in the opening phase, allowing the 6 infantry divisions of the BEF a disproportionate effect on the outcome. Ernest R. May later claimed that Wilson had \"cooked\" these figures, but his arguments were challenged by Edward Bennett, who felt that Wilson's numbers were not far wrong.[106]\n\nThis became the General Staff position for the CID meeting on 23 August. Sir Arthur Wilson proposed that 5 divisions guard Britain whilst one land on the Baltic coast, or possibly at Antwerp, believing that the Germans would be halfway to Paris by the time an Expeditionary Force was ready, and that the four to six divisions Britain was expected to be able to muster would have little effect. Wilson thought the Royal Navy plan \"one of the most childish papers I ever read\".[107] Henry Wilson set out his own plans, apparently the first time the CID had heard them.[75] Hankey recorded that Wilson's lucid presentation carried the day even though Hankey himself did not entirely agree with it. Prime Minister H. H. Asquith ordered the Navy to fall in with the Army's plans. Hankey also recorded that Morley and Burns resigned from the Cabinet as they were unable to accept the decision, and Churchill and Lloyd George never fully accepted the implications of committing a large military force to France. After the meeting Hankey began to draw up the War Book detailing mobilisation plans, and yet the exact deployment of the BEF was still undecided as late as 4 August 1914.[101]\n\nWilson had recommended deploying at Maubeuge. He thought (wrongly, as it turned out) that the Germans would only violate Belgian territory south of the Meuse. Over the next few weeks Wilson had several meetings with Churchill, Grey and Lloyd George, who were keen to obtain an agreement with Belgium. This attracted the opposition of Haldane and Nicholson, who suppressed a lengthy paper by Wilson arguing for an agreement with Belgium; the paper was eventually circulated to the CID by Nicholson's successor Sir John French in April 1912.[108]\n\nLate 1911\n\n[edit]\n\nThroughout the Agadir Crisis Wilson was keen to pass on the latest intelligence to Churchill. Churchill and Grey came to Wilson's house (4 September) to discuss the situation until after midnight. Wilson (18 September) recorded four separate reports from spies of German troops massing opposite the Belgian frontier. Wilson was also responsible for Military Intelligence, then in its infancy. This included MO5 (under George Macdonogh, succeeding Edmonds) and the embryonic MI5 (under Colonel Vernon Kell) and MI6 (under \"C\", Commander Mansfield Cumming). It is unclear from the surviving documents just how much of Wilson's time was taken up by these agencies, although he dined with Haldane, Kell and Cumming on 26 November 1911.[109]\n\nIn October 1911 Wilson went on another bicycle tour of Belgium south of the Meuse, inspecting the French side of the frontier, visiting Verdun, the battlefield of Mars-La-Tour, and Fort St Michel at Toul (near Nancy). On his way home, still keen to \"snaffle these Belgians\" he visited the British military attaché in Brussels.[110][111]\n\nRadical members of the Cabinet pushed for Wilson's removal, but he was staunchly defended by Haldane, who had the backing of the most influential ministers: Asquith, Grey and Lloyd George, as well as Churchill.[112]\n\n1912\n\n[edit]\n\nAfter Agadir the MO1 section under Harper became a key branch in preparing for war. Churchill, newly appointed to the Admiralty, was more receptive to Army-Navy cooperation. Intelligence suggested that Germany was preparing for war in April 1912.[112] In February 1912 Wilson inspected the docks at Rouen, had meetings in Paris with Joffre, de Castelnau and Millerand (War Minister), visited Foch, now commanding a division at Chaumont, and inspected southern Belgium and the Maastricht appendix.[113] Sir John French, the new CIGS, was receptive to Wilson's wishes to prepare for war and to cooperate with Belgium, although in the end the Belgian Government remained strictly neutral until the outbreak of war.[114] In April Wilson played golf with Tom Bridges, briefing him for talks with the Belgians, whom Wilson wanted to strengthen Liege and Namur.[115]\n\nThrough his brother Jemmy, Wilson forged links with the new Conservative leader Bonar Law. Jemmy had been on the platform in Belfast in April 1912 when Law addressed a mass meeting against Home Rule, and in the summer of 1912 he came to London to work for the Ulster Defence League (run by Walter Long and Charlie Hunter).[116] Wilson dined with Law and was impressed by him, discussing Ireland and defence matters. That summer he began having regular talks with Long, who used Wilson as a conduit to try to establish cross-party defence agreement with Churchill.[116]\n\nWilson thought Haldane a fool for thinking that Britain would have a time window of up to six months in which to deploy the BEF.[115] In September 1912 he inspected Warsaw with Alfred Knox, British military attaché in Russia, then met Zhilinsky in St Petersburg, before visiting the battlefield of Borodino, and Kiev, then – in Austria-Hungary – Lemburg, Krakow and Vienna. Plans to visit Constantinople had to be shelved because of the First Balkan War, although Wilson recorded his concerns that the Bulgars had beaten the Turks a month after the declaration of war – evidence that the BEF must be committed to war at once, not within six months as Haldane hoped.[115]\n\nBy 14 November 1912 the railway timetables, drawn up by Harper's MO1, were ready, after two years of work. A joint Admiralty-War Office committee, including representatives of the merchant shipping industry, met fortnightly from February 1913, and produced a workable scheme by spring 1914. In the event the transport of the BEF from just three ports (Southampton for troops, Avonmouth for mechanical transport and Newhaven for stores) would proceed smoothly.[114] Brian Bond argued that Wilson's greatest achievement as DMO was the provision of horses and transport and other measures which allowed mobilisation to proceed smoothly.[117]\n\nRepington and Wilson were still cutting one another dead whenever they met. In November 1912 Repington, who wanted to use the Territorial Army as a basis for conscription, urged Haldane (now Lord Chancellor) to have Wilson sacked and replaced by Robertson.[118]\n\nIn 1912 Wilson was appointed Honorary Colonel of the 3rd Battalion, Royal Irish Rifles.[119]\n\n1913\n\n[edit]\n\nWilson's support for conscription made him friendly with Leo Amery, Arthur Lee, Charlie Hunter, Earl Percy, (Lord) Simon Lovat, Garvin of The Observer, Gwynne of The Morning Post and F.S Oliver, owner of the Department Store Debenham and Freebody. Wilson briefed Oliver and Lovat, who were active in the National Service League. In December 1912 Wilson cooperated with Gwynne and Oliver in a campaign to destroy the Territorial Force.[120]\n\nIn the spring of 1913 Roberts, after previous urging by Lovat, arranged a reconciliation between Repington and Wilson. Repington wrote a letter to The Times in June 1913, demanding to know why Wilson was not playing a more prominent role in the debates of 1913–14 as to whether some British regular divisions should be retained at home to defeat a potential invasion.[118] In May 1913 Wilson suggested that Earl Percy write an article against the \"voluntary principle\" for the National Review and helped him write it. He was also drafting pro-conscription speeches for Lord Roberts.[120]\n\nWilson visited France seven times in 1913, including a visit in August to observe French manoeuvres. Wilson spoke French fluently but not perfectly, and would sometimes revert into English for sensitive matters in order not to risk speaking inaccurately.[121]\n\nIn October 1913 Wilson visited Constantinople. Wilson was unimpressed by the Turkish Army and road and rail infrastructure, and felt that the introduction of constitutional government would be the final blow to the Ottoman Empire. These views may have contributed to the underestimation of Turkey's defence strength at Gallipoli.[122]\n\nRoberts had been lobbying French to promote Wilson to major-general, a rank appropriate to his job as DMO, since the end of 1912. In April 1913, with a brigade command about to fall vacant, Wilson was assured by French that he was to be promoted to major-general later in the year, and that not having commanded a brigade would not prevent him commanding a division later.[123] Wilson believed that French wanted him to become chief of staff designate of the BEF after the 1913 manoeuvres, but that he was too junior. Instead Murray was appointed.[124]\n\nWilson was promoted major general in November 1913.[125] French confided that he intended to have his own term as CIGS extended by two years to 1918, and to be succeeded by Murray, at which point Wilson was to succeed Murray as sub-CIGS.[123] After a 17 November 1913 meeting of BEF senior officers, Wilson privately recorded his concerns at French's lack of intellect and hoped there would not be a war just yet.[126]\n\nEarly in 1914, at an exercise at Staff College, Wilson acted as Chief of Staff. Edmonds later wrote that Robertson, acting as Exercise Director, drew Wilson's attention to his ignorance of certain procedures, and said to French in a stage whisper \"if you go to war with that operations staff, you are as good as beaten\".[127]\n\nCurragh incident\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Curragh incident\n\nFamily political tradition\n\n[edit]\n\nWilson and his family had long been active in Unionist politics. His father had stood for Parliament for Longford South in 1885, whilst his older brother James Mackay (\"Jemmy\") had stood against Justin McCarthy for Longford North in 1885 and 1892, being defeated by a margin of over 10:1 each time.[128]\n\nAs far back as 1893, during the passage of Gladstone's Second Home Rule Bill, Wilson had been party to a proposal to raise 2,000–4,000 men, to drill as soldiers in Ulster, although he wanted Catholics also to be recruited. In February 1895 Henry and Cecil listened to and \"enjoyed immensely\" a \"very fine\" speech by Joseph Chamberlain about London municipal questions in Stepney, and Wilson listened to another speech by Chamberlain in May. In 1903 Wilson's father was part of the Landowners' Convention deputation to observe the passage of Irish land legislation through Parliament. In 1906 his younger brother Tono was Tory agent in Swindon.[129]\n\nCrisis brews\n\n[edit]\n\nWilson supported Ulster Unionist opponents of the Third Irish Home Rule Bill, which was due to become law in 1914.[1] Wilson had learned from his brother Jemmy (13 April 1913) about plans to raise 25,000 armed men and 100,000 \"constables\", and to form a Provisional Government in Ulster to take control of banks and railways, which he thought \"all very sensible\". Asked by Roberts (16 April 1913) to be chief of staff to the \"Army of Ulster\", Wilson replied that if necessary he would fight for Ulster rather than against her.[130]\n\nAt a meeting at the War Office (4 November 1913), Wilson told French that he \"could not fire on the north at the dictates of Redmond\" and that \"England qua England is opposed to Home Rule, and England must agree to it … I cannot bring myself to believe that Asquith will be so mad as to employ force\". French, whom Wilson urged to tell the King that he could not depend on the loyalty of the whole of the Army, was unaware that Wilson was leaking the contents of these meetings to the Conservative leader Bonar Law.[131][132]\n\nWilson met Bonar Law and told him that he did not agree that the percentage of defections in the officer corps would be as high as 40%, the figure suggested by the King's adviser Lord Stamfordham. He passed on his wife Cecil's advice that the UVF should take the patriotic high ground by pledging to fight for King and Country in the event of war.[133] Bonar Law immediately attempted to reach Carson on the telephone to relay this suggestion. Wilson also advised Bonar Law – at this time the government were attempting to offer Counties Londonderry, Antrim, Armagh and Down an opt-out from Home Rule, the plan being that a refusal would make Carson look intransigent – to ensure that negotiations failed in way which made the Irish Nationalists look intransigent.[134]\n\nHe met Nevil Macready, Director of Personal Services, who told him that he was being sent over to Ulster but that the Cabinet would not try to deploy troops. On 14 November he dined with Charlie Hunter and Lord Milner, who told him that any officers who resigned over Ulster would be reinstated by the next Conservative Government. Wilson also warned Edward Sclater that the UVF should not take any action hostile to the Army. Wilson found Asquith's Leeds speech – in which the Prime Minister promised to \"see this thing through\" without an election – \"ominous\", and on 28 November John du Cane turned up at the War Office \"furious\" with Asquith and asserting that Ulster would have to be granted Belligerent status like the Confederate States of America.[135]\n\nThe Wilson and Rawlinson families spent Christmas with Lord Roberts, who was strongly opposed to the planned legislation, as was Brigadier Johnnie Gough, with whom Wilson played golf on Boxing Day, as was Leo Amery with whom he lunched at White's on New Year's Day. Wilson's main concern was \"that the army should not be drawn in\", and on 5 January he had \"a long and serious talk about Ulster & whether we couldn't do something to keep the Army out of it\" with Joey Davies (Director of Staff Duties since October 1913) and Robertson (Director of Military Training), and the three men agreed to take soundings of army opinion at the annual Staff College conference at Camberley the following week. At the end of February Wilson went to Belfast, where he visited the Unionist Headquarters at Old Town Hall. His mission was not secret – the official purpose was to inspect 3rd Royal Irish Rifles and give a lecture on the Balkans at Victoria Barracks, and he reported his opinion of the Ulster situation to the Secretary of State and to Sir John French – but attracted press speculation.[136] Wilson was delighted by the Ulster Volunteers (now 100,000 strong),[137] to whom he was also leaking information.[138]\n\nThe incident\n\n[edit]\n\nAfter Paget had been told to prepare to deploy troops in Ulster, Wilson attempted in vain to persuade French that any such move would have serious repercussions not only in Glasgow but also in Egypt and India.[139] Wilson helped the elderly Lord Roberts (morning of 20 March) draft a letter to the Prime Minister, urging him not to cause a split in the army. Wilson was summoned home by his wife to see Johnnie Gough, who had come up from Aldershot, and told him of Hubert Gough's threat to resign (see Curragh incident). Wilson advised Johnnie not to \"send in his papers\" (resign) just yet, and telephoned French, who when told of the news \"talked windy platitudes till (Wilson) was nearly sick\".[140][141]\n\nBy the morning of Saturday 21 Wilson was talking of resigning and urging his staff to do the same, although he never actually did so and forfeited respect by talking too much of bringing down the government.[142][143] With Parliament debating a Conservative motion of censure on the government for using the Army in Ulster,[143] Repington telephoned Wilson (21 April 1914) to ask what line The Times should take.[118] Fresh from a visit to Bonar Law (21 March), Wilson suggested prodding Asquith to take \"instant action\" to prevent general staff resignations. At the request of Seely (Secretary of State for War) Wilson wrote a summary of \"what the army would agree to\", namely a promise that the army would not be used to coerce Ulster, but this was not acceptable to the government. Despite Robertson's warm support, Wilson was unable to persuade French to warn the government that the Army would not move against Ulster.[144]\n\nHubert Gough breakfasted with Wilson on 23 March, before his meeting with French and Ewart at the War Office, where he demanded a written guarantee that the Army would not be used against Ulster.[145] Wilson was also present at the 4pm meeting at which Gough, on his advice, insisted on amending a Cabinet document to clarify that the Army would not be used to enforce Home Rule on Ulster, to which French also agreed in writing. Wilson then left, telling people in the War Office that the Army had done what the Opposition had failed to do (i.e. prevent the coercion of Ulster). Wilson told French that he suspected he (French) would be sacked by the Government, in which case \"the Army would go solid with him\".[146] To his brother's amusement, Johnnie Gough \"hotted\" (teased) Wilson by affecting to believe that he was actually going to resign.[147] Wilson was worried that a future Dublin government might issue \"lawful orders\" to coerce Ulster. At the top of his diary page for 23 March he wrote: \"We soldiers beat Asquith & his vile tricks\".[148]\n\nAsquith publicly repudiated the amendments to the Cabinet document, but at first refused to accept the resignations of French and Ewart, although Wilson advised French that he must resign \"unless they were in a position to justify their remaining on in the eyes of officers\". French eventually resigned after Wilson tested the climate at a Staff College point-to-point.[138][149]\n\nEffects\n\n[edit]\n\nWilson telegraphed Gough twice and advised him to \"stand like a rock\" and hold onto the document, but received no reply. Milner thought Wilson had \"saved the Empire\", which Wilson thought \"much too flattering\". He thought Morley (who had advised Seely) and Haldane (who advised French) would also have to resign, which would bring down the government. Gough was angry that Wilson had not himself offered to resign and blamed Wilson for having done nothing to stop the government's plans to coerce Ulster until Gough and his officers threatened to resign.[142] The Gough brothers thereafter cut Wilson.[138][149][150]\n\nBetween 21 March and the end of the month, Wilson saw Law nine times, Amery four times, Gwynne three times, and Milner and Arthur Lee twice. He does not seem to have regarded these contacts with the Opposition as secret. Roberts was also leaking information which he was being fed by Wilson and the Gough brothers. Gough promised to keep the 23 March Treaty confidential, but it soon leaked to the press – it appears that both Gough and French leaked it to Gwynne, whilst Wilson leaked it to Amery and Bonar Law.[151]\n\nFirst World War\n\n[edit]\n\n1914\n\n[edit]\n\nOutbreak of war\n\n[edit]\n\nWilson visited France four times to discuss war plans between January and May 1914. With the CID having recommended that two of the BEF's six divisions be retained at home to guard against invasion, Wilson successfully lobbied Asquith, who was Secretary of State for War, to send at least five divisions to France.[152]\n\nDuring the July Crisis Wilson was mainly preoccupied with the apparent imminence of civil war in Ireland and vainly lobbied the new CIGS Charles Douglas to flood the whole of Ireland with troops.[153] By the end of July it was clear that the continent was on the brink of hostilities.[153] Wilson called on de la Panouse (French Military Attaché) and Paul Cambon (French Ambassador) to discuss the military situation.[154] Wilson may well have been keeping the Conservative leadership informed of discussions between Cambon and Foreign Secretary Grey.[155][156] The German invasion of Belgium provided a casus belli and Britain mobilized on 3 August and declared war on 4 August.[157]\n\nSub Chief of Staff, BEF: deployment\n\n[edit]\n\nWilson was initially offered the job of \"Brigadier-General of Operations\" but as he was already a major-general he negotiated an upgrade in his title to \"Sub Chief of Staff\".[158] Edmonds, Kirke and Murray all claimed after the war that French had wanted Wilson as Chief of Staff, but this had been vetoed because of his role in the Curragh Mutiny; no contemporary evidence, even Wilson's diary, confirms this.[159]\n\nWilson met with Victor Huguet (7 August), a French liaison officer summoned to London at Kitchener's request, and sent him back to France to obtain more information from Joffre, having told him of British plans to start movement of troops on 9 August. Kitchener, angry that Wilson had acted without consulting him, summoned him to his office for a rebuke. Wilson was angry that Kitchener was confusing the mobilisation plans by deploying troops from Aldershot to Grimsby in case of German invasion, and recorded in his diary that \"I answered back as I have no intention of being bullied by him especially when he talks such nonsense … the man is a fool … He is a d---- fool\". On Huguet's return (12 August) he met with French, Murray and Wilson. They agreed to deploy the BEF to Maubeuge, but Kitchener, in a three-hour meeting which was, according to Wilson, \"memorable in showing K's colossal ignorance and conceit\", tried to insist on a deployment to Amiens where the BEF would be in less danger of being overrun by the Germans coming north of the Meuse.[160] Wilson wrote not just of the difficulties and delays which Kitchener was making but also of \"the cowardice of it\", although historian John Terraine later argued that Kitchener's opposition to a forward deployment was proven entirely correct by the nearness which the BEF came to disaster.[161] The clash of personalities between Wilson and Kitchener worsened relations between Kitchener and Sir John French, who often took Wilson's advice.[162]\n\nWilson, French and Murray crossed to France on 14 August.[163] Wilson was sceptical of the German invasion of Belgium, feeling that it would be diverted to meet the French thrusts into Lorraine and the Ardennes.[164] Reconnoitring the area with Harper in August 1913, Wilson had wanted to deploy the BEF just east of Namur. Although Wilson's prediction of the German advance was less prescient than Kitchener's, had this been done, it is possible that Anglo-French forces could have attacked north, threatening to cut off the German Armies moving westwards north of the Meuse.[163]\n\nLike other British commanders Wilson, at first, underestimated the size of German forces opposite the BEF, although Terraine and Holmes are very critical of the advice which Wilson was giving Sir John on 22 August, encouraging further BEF advances and \"calculating\" that the BEF was faced only by one German corps and a cavalry division, although Macdonogh was providing more realistic estimates.[165][166] Wilson even issued a rebuke to the Cavalry Division for reporting that strong German forces were heading on Mons from Brussels, claiming that they were mistaken and only German cavalry and Jaegers were in front of them.[167]\n\nOn 23 August, the day of the Battle of Mons, Wilson initially drafted orders for II Corps and the cavalry division to attack the following day, which Sir John cancelled (after a message was received from Joffre at 8pm warning of at least 2 ½ German corps opposite[168] – there were in fact three German corps opposite the BEF with a fourth moving around the British left flank, and then a retreat was ordered at 11pm when news came that Lanrezac's Fifth Army on the right was falling back). On 24 August, the day after the battle, he bemoaned that no retreat would have been necessary had the BEF had 6 infantry divisions as originally planned. Terraine describes Wilson's diary account of these events as \"a ridiculous summary … by a man in a responsible position\", and argues that although Kitchener's fears of a German invasion of Britain had been exaggerated, his consequent decision to hold back two divisions saved the BEF from a greater disaster which might have been brought on by Wilson's overconfidence.[165][166][169]\n\nSub Chief of Staff, BEF: retreat\n\n[edit]\n\nThe BEF staff performed poorly over the next few days. Various eyewitnesses reported that Wilson was one of the calmer members of GHQ, but he was concerned at Murray's medical unfitness and French's apparent inability to grasp the situation. Wilson opposed Smith-Dorrien's decision to stand and fight at Le Cateau (26 August).[166] However, when told by Smith-Dorrien that it would not be possible to break off and fall back until nightfall, by his own account he wished him luck and congratulated him for his cheerful tone.[170] Smith-Dorrien's slightly different recollection was that Wilson had warned that he risked being encircled like the French at Sedan in 1870.[171]\n\nBaker-Carr recalled Wilson's standing in dressing gown and slippers uttering \"sardonic little jests to all and sundry within earshot\" as GHQ packed up to evacuate, behaviour which historian Dan Todman comments was probably \"reassuring for some but profoundly irritating for others\".[172] Macready recorded Wilson (27 August) \"walking slowly up and down\" the room at Noyon which had been commandeered as headquarters with a \"comical, whimsical expression\", clapping his hands and chanting \"We shall never get there, we shall never get there … to the sea, to the sea, to the sea\", although he also recorded that this was probably intended to keep up the spirits of more junior officers. His infamous \"sauve qui peut\" order to Snow, GOC 4th Division, (27 August) ordering unnecessary ammunition and officers' kits to be dumped so that tired and wounded soldiers could be carried, was, according to Swinton, probably intended out of concern for the soldiers rather than out of panic. Smith-Dorrien was later rebuked by French for countermanding it.[166][173] Lord Loch thought the order showed \"GHQ had lost their heads\" whilst General Haldane thought it \"a mad order\" (both in their diaries for 28 August).[174] Major-General Pope-Hennessey later alleged (in the 1930s) that Wilson had ordered the destruction of orders issued during the retreat to hide the degree of panic.[175]\n\nAfter the war Wilson claimed that the Germans ought to have won in 1914 but for bad luck. Bartholomew, who had been a staff captain at the time, later told Liddell Hart that Wilson had been \"the man who saved the British Army\" for ordering Smith-Dorrien to retreat southwards after Le Cateau, thus breaking contact with the Germans who had expected him to retreat southwest. Wilson played an important role liaising with the French, and also appears to have dissuaded Joffre against further attacks by Lanrezac, with which the British would not have been able to assist (29 August).[176] Whilst Murray was having an important meeting (4 September) with Gallieni (Military governor of Paris) and Maunoury (commander, French Sixth Army) to discuss the planned Allied counterattack which would become the First Battle of the Marne, Wilson was having a simultaneous meeting with Franchet d'Esperey (Fifth Army, on the British right), which envisaged Sixth Army attacking north of the Marne.[177] Wilson later persuaded Sir John French to cancel his orders to retreat further south (4 September) and helped persuade him to join in the Battle of the Marne (6 September).[176]\n\nLike many Allied leaders, Wilson believed after the victory at the Marne that the war was as good as won. He told Joffre's staff officer General Henri Mathias Berthelot (13 September) that the Allies would be in Elsenborn on the German-Belgian frontier in four weeks (Berthelot thought three).[178] Wilson also helped to persuade Joffre (late September) to allow the BEF to redeploy further to the left of the Allied line. When French, Murray and Wilson arrived to confer with Foch (then commanding the French Armies in that sector) in early October 1914, Foch greeted Sir John with a handshake but threw his arms around Wilson's neck and kissed him on both cheeks.[176]\n\nSuccession to Murray\n\n[edit]\n\nWilson acted as chief of staff for the BEF when Murray visited the War Office in October.[179] Like many senior Allied officers, Wilson believed that the war would be won by the following spring and felt that Kitchener was jeopardising the victory by withholding officers in Britain for what Wilson called his \"shadow armies\".[180] Wilson did not envisage British troops fighting under French command and opposed Foch's request that Allenby and two battalions take part in a French attack.[181] Murray (4–5 November) complained and threatened to resign when Wilson amended one of his orders without telling him.[182] Wilson was present at the deathbed of his old patron Lord Roberts, returning home for the funeral at St Paul's Cathedral.[180]\n\nAt the end of November and again in mid-December French told Wilson he was thinking of moving Murray to a corps command and insisting on Wilson replacing him, but Asquith forbade French to promote \"that poisonous tho' clever ruffian Wilson who behaved … so badly … about Ulster\". Wilson claimed to have heard Joffre complain that it was \"a pity\" that Murray had not been removed, but when he heard of this Asquith put it down to \"the constant intriguing of that serpent Wilson\" whom he and Kitchener were determined to block.[182] Asquith felt he was too Francophile and too fond of \"mischief\" (political intrigue), but despite Wilson's advising French that the reasons for their objections were largely personal, he was not able to dissuade them from blocking the appointment.[102] On a visit to London in early January Wilson heard from the King's assistant secretary Clive Wigram that it was Asquith rather than Kitchener who was blocking the promotion, which Carson and Law were eager for him to have.[182]\n\nJeffery argues that there is little specific evidence that Wilson intrigued to replace Murray, simply that he was widely suspected of having done so, and that his pro-French stance was regarded with deep suspicion by other British officers (Haig's staff officer Charteris likened Wilson's alleged request to the French, to lobby on his behalf for him to replace Murray, to \"mental adultery\").[183] When Murray was at last removed as chief of staff BEF in January 1915, his job went to the BEF Quartermaster-General \"Wully\" Robertson. Robertson refused to have Wilson as his deputy, so Wilson was instead appointed Principal Liaison Officer with the French, and promoted to temporary lieutenant general.[184][185] French technically had no authority to make this promotion, but told Wilson he would resign if the Cabinet or War Office objected. The French had been lobbying so hard for Wilson's appointment that even Sir John thought they should mind their own business.[186] Asquith (letter to Venetia Stanley 26 Jan) and Haig (diary 5 Feb) both remarked that this was putting Wilson out of mischief.[182]\n\n1915–16\n\n[edit]\n\nPrincipal Liaison Officer\n\n[edit]\n\nWilson was \"rather upset by the changes made in his absence\" whilst he was touring the French front – Robertson removed Wilson's ally, Brigadier General George Harper \"in a very untactful way\". Wilson's diary makes several references to Robertson being \"suspicious and hostile\" towards him.[187] Wilson was suspected of intriguing for Robertson's removal.[187]\n\nWilson saw Foch every 2 to 3 days[188] and sometimes smoothed tense meetings by creative (mis)translation.[189] Wilson opposed the Gallipoli Campaign and hoped it would be \"a fiasco\" to \"help get rid of Winston\". He also recorded his anger that, after shells had had to be sent to Gallipoli, the BEF, then numbering 12 divisions, barely had enough High Explosive shell for the Battle of Festubert, which he thought could be \"one of the decisive actions of the war\".[190]\n\nThe failure to achieve quick success at Gallipoli, and the Shell Shortage to which that campaign contributed, led to Conservative ministers joining the new Coalition Government in May, which boosted Wilson's prospects.[191] Wilson was knighted as a Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath in the June 1915 King's Birthday Honours,[192] having been passed over for the honour in February.[193] He was invited to speak at a Cabinet meeting in summer 1915.[194] From July 1915 Asquith and Kitchener began to consult Wilson regularly[194] and his personal relations with both men appear to have become more cordial.[191]\n\nWilson deplored the botched August Landing at Suvla Bay in Gallipoli, writing that \"Winston first & others after\" should be tried for murder.[190] In the summer of 1915 Wilson believed that the French government might fall, or France herself seek peace, unless the British committed to the mooted Loos offensive.[195] His efforts to be the main go-between of French and Joffre ended in September 1915, when it was decided that these contacts should go through Sidney Clive, the British liaison officer at GQG.[188] Leo Maxse, H. A. Gwynne and the radical Josiah Wedgwood MP, impressed by Wilson's support for conscription[196] and for the abandonment of Gallipoli, tipped him as a potential CIGS in place of James Wolfe-Murray, but Archibald Murray was appointed instead (September 1915).[191]\n\nAppointment as corps commander\n\n[edit]\n\nAfter the Battle of Loos, Sir John French's days as Commander-in-Chief were numbered. Robertson told the King on 27 October that Wilson should be removed for not being \"loyal\" – Robertson had earlier criticised Wilson for his closeness to the French.[197] Wilson was seen as \"an unofficial adviser\" of \"similar rank\" but \"totally different temperament\" to Robertson.[187] Sir John French, Milner, Lloyd George and Arthur Lee all raised the possibility of Wilson becoming Chief of the Imperial General Staff (CIGS) in place of Murray. Hankey thought he might have become CIGS were it not for lingering mistrust over the Curragh incident, but there is no explicit evidence in Wilson's diary that he coveted the job. Joffre suggested that Wilson should replace Kitchener as Secretary of State for War.[198]\n\nWilson was also given the honorary appointment of Colonel of the Royal Irish Rifles on 11 November 1915,[199] and was made a Commander and later Grand Officier of the Légion d'honneur for his services.[200][201][202] Wilson attended the Anglo-French Chantilly Conference (6–8 December 1915) along with Murray (CIGS), French and Robertson, as well as Joffre, Maurice Pellé and Victor Huguet for France, Zhilinski and Ignatieff for Russia, Cadorna for Italy and a Serb and Belgian representative. Wilson disapproved of large meetings and thought the British and French War Ministers, C-in-Cs and foreign ministers (6 men in total) should meet regularly which might discourage ventures like Antwerp, Gallipoli and Salonika.[203]\n\nWith French's \"resignation\" imminent, Wilson, who appears to have remained loyal to him, attempted to resign and go on half pay (10 December) as he felt he could not serve under Haig or Robertson; Bonar Law and Charles E. Callwell attempted to dissuade him.[1][198] Haig thought this unacceptable for such an able officer in wartime, and Robertson advised him that Wilson would \"do less harm\" in France than in England.[204] Haig thought (12 December) Wilson should command a division before he commanded a corps, despite his belief that Wilson had criticised himself and other British generals, and had instigated an article in The Observer suggesting that the BEF be placed under General Foch (commander, French Northern Army Group)[205] (Charteris wrote to his wife (12 December) apropos the articles that \"neither DH nor Robertson wants Wilson anywhere near them\").[206]\n\nRawlinson, rumoured to be in line for promotion to succeed Haig as GOC First Army, offered Wilson the chance to succeed him as GOC IV Corps, but Wilson preferred not to serve under Rawlinson, preferring instead the new XIV Corps, part of Allenby's Third Army and including the 36th (Ulster) Division. Asquith summoned Wilson to London and personally offered him a corps, and Kitchener told him the corps command was to be \"only temporary pending something better\", although Wilson thought impractical his suggestion that he simultaneously continue to perform Anglo-French liaison duties. Jeffery suggests Kitchener may have seen Wilson as a potential ally against Robertson.[206]\n\nLike many Conservatives Wilson was dissatisfied at Asquith's lack of firm leadership and at the delay in bringing in conscription, and from December 1915 he urged Bonar Law to bring down the government (Law refused, pointing out that the resulting General Election would be divisive and the support of Radical and Irish MPs would be lost to the war effort).[207]\n\nCorps Commander: spring 1916\n\n[edit]\n\nWilson was given command of IV Corps, which he noted was almost the same size (nearly 70,000 men) as the original BEF of August 1914. Given the difference in quality between his divisions, he took a keen interest in training and gave many lectures to officers.[208] Like many, Wilson initially thought the Easter Rising (26 April 1916) was German-inspired. Bonar Law tentatively suggested him as a possible commander to put down the Rising, but his Ulster record made this unwise. Wilson hoped the events would lead to Asquith's fall. Wilson thought that the crushing of troublemakers would prevent them infecting the supposed silent Unionist majority, and regretted the removal of General Maxwell later in the year \"to placate that giant fraud Redmond\".[209]\n\nWilson, in temporary command of First Army in Monro's absence from 9 to 22 May, had to take over some more trench from Byng's XVII Corps (part of Allenby's Third Army) opposite Vimy Ridge. Two divisional commanders, William Walker (2nd, sick) and Barter (47th, on leave) were away until 22 May, further disrupting the chain of command as various officers were required to act in their seniors' place. A surprise German attack on the evening of Sunday 21 May moved forward 800 yards, capturing 1,000 yards of the British front line. Wilson appears to have done all he could, arranging the assembly of artillery from First Army and neighbouring Third Army, but the planned counterattack was postponed until 23 May by Monro, who had just returned from leave. At a major meeting at Wilson's HQ (23 May) Monro and Allenby insisted the IV Corps counterattack must proceed, over the objection of John Headlam (artillery) and Tavish Davidson (Director of Military Operations) from GHQ, who passed on Haig's wishes that the counterattack be postponed by a fortnight.[210]\n\nThe counterattack failed, as two battalions in the centre found the German shelling too heavy for them to attack, and Monro eventually ordered a halt. Wilson wanted to court martial the two acting battalion commanders for \"funk\", after hearing the view of one of the actual COs (who had been acting in command of the brigade) that the attack had been feasible. Major Armytage, a staff officer from GHQ, visited the sector on 25 May and reported back that Brigadier-General Kellett (99th Brigade, but acting GOC of 2nd Division) was incompetent and \"in complete ignorance of the situation\". Haig wrote to Monro (27 May) that Wilson should be asked to explain and that IV Corps, formerly \"the most efficient in the army\" \"had much decreased in military value\" and Wilson \"had failed as a commander in the field\". Charteris also visited IV Corps HQ on 27 May, and reported back that officers there were \"downhearted\" and thought the Germans and French better fighters than the British – Wilson later claimed that the officers had been \"pulling Charteris' leg\" as he talked of \"sweeping victories\" within two months. Wilson was almost \"degummed\" (sacked) but was saved by a strong report in his favour by Monro. The two acting battalion commanders were not court-martialled, but Kellett was never promoted to command a division. Jeffery argues that Wilson was, like many \"unsuccessful\" corps commanders, largely in the wrong place at the wrong time, and that Haig's animosity for Wilson was a factor.[211]\n\nCorps Commander: summer and autumn 1916\n\n[edit]\n\nWith the major offensive on the Somme imminent, Foch told Wilson in May that until the Allies had far more guns and ammunition such an attack was \"suicidal\", worries which were shared by Clemenceau, who apparently came to Rouen especially to see Wilson. Like many British generals, Wilson was overly impressed by the amount of artillery available and wrote (22 June 1916) \"we run a serious chance of doing something considerable here (on the Somme).\" IV Corps did not directly participate in the Somme under Wilson's command.[212]\n\nIn August Haking, Wilson's junior and a favourite of Haig, was made acting Army Commander when Monro left to become Commander-in-Chief, India. Wilson claimed in his diary that Monro had recommended him to command First Army but this was vetoed by Haig. Despite the hopes of his many political friends Wilson was blocked from further promotion.[213]\n\nBy August Wilson had two elite divisions under his command, 63rd (Royal Naval) Division and 9th (Scottish) Division, but resisted pressure from Haig to conduct another attack until after 1 September. Wilson was aware that the greater success of French attacks on the Somme was largely owed to more concentrated artillery fire, and that British attacks at High Wood and Guillemont (late July) were less successful. It was decided to use a short traditional bombardment rather than a gas attack, and Wilson's men experimented (in vain) with a flamethrower (in May he had been impressed by an explosive device, a sort of prototype Bangalore torpedo, to clear wire). Wilson was displeased at the poor state of air support but impressed by the early artillery sound ranging device which he was shown. With Haig convinced he was going to \"smash the Bosh on the Somme\" in September, GHQ now postponed Wilson's attack until October, and now wanted the whole of Vimy Ridge taken, which would mean a joint attack with XVII Corps. Some of Wilson's artillery was moved down to the Somme. Wilson continued to work on air-artillery coordination and mining, but rejected a proposal to dig jumping-off trenches into No Mans Land, as this would give away the attack.[214]\n\nIn September 1916 Lloyd George, now Secretary of State for War, visited the Western Front and asked Wilson why the British had performed so much more poorly than the French on the Somme. Wilson stressed the inexperience of the British Army. On his visit Lloyd George had been told (falsely) that Wilson had not wanted to counterattack in May.[215]\n\nWilson then had the 63rd and 9th Divisions taken away, then (10 October) heard his whole Corps was to be transferred to Gough's Reserve Army, a prospect which did not please him.[216] In October Gough \"hauled him over the coals over the state of IV Corps\".[217] By 18 October IV Corps had no divisions at all, and Wilson had to take 2 weeks leave in the UK in early November. Edmonds later wrote that Wilson's preparations had laid the foundations for the successful capture of Vimy Ridge in April 1917.[216]\n\nWilson thought that \"to slog on at one spot\" on the Somme was \"dreadfully lacking in imagination\" and would have preferred a joint offensive by Russia, Italy and Romania in Spring 1917 to draw off 15 or 20 German divisions, allowing the BEF to \"completely smash the Boch line\". Summoned to see Lloyd George (13 November 1916) and asked if Britain could still hope to defeat Germany, Wilson advised him that she could, provided Haig were given enough men to fight \"two Sommes at once\", but that in reality Haig should be firmly told how many men he was to receive and told to plan accordingly. He thought at the end of 1916 that both sides were claiming victory from that year's fighting, but victory \"inclined to us\", and that Germany might be driven to sue for peace in 1917.[218]\n\n1917\n\n[edit]\n\nMission to Russia\n\n[edit]\n\nLloyd George's accession to the Premiership (December 1916) restarted Wilson's career. In January 1917 Wilson accompanied Lloyd George to a conference at Rome. Despite the growing alliance between Wilson and the Prime Minister, Wilson agreed with Robertson that British heavy guns should not be sent to Italy or to the Salonika front.[219]\n\nLloyd George wanted Russia persuaded to make the maximum possible effort, a necessity again stressed at the second Chantilly Conference in December 1916. Wilson was sent as Senior Military Representative on a British mission to Russia in January 1917, the object of which was to keep the Russians holding down at least the forces now opposite them, to boost Russian morale and see what equipment they needed with a view to coordinating attacks. The party of 50 included British (led by Milner), French (led by de Castelnau) and Italian delegations. The War Office briefing advised that Russia was close to revolution. Wilson met the Tsar but thought him \"as devoid of character & purpose as our own poor miserable King\". Even senior Russian officials were talking openly of assassinating the Tsar or perhaps just the Tsarina. Wilson was impressed by Generals Ruzski and Danilov, although he may have been influenced too much by the views of Knox, who had been British military attaché since 1911. He toured Petrograd, Moscow (where he was concerned at the food shortages) and Riga, and thought that even if Tsar and Tsarina were assassinated, Russia would not make a separate peace. His official report (3 March) said that Russia would remain in the war and that they would solve their \"administrative chaos\". However, many other observers at the time, e.g. the young Archibald Wavell in the Caucasus, felt that the advent of democracy in Russia would reinvigorate her war effort, so Wilson's views were not entirely unusual.[220]\n\nChief of British Mission, French Army\n\n[edit]\n\nDuring the Calais Affair (whilst Wilson was away in Russia) Lloyd George had attempted to sideline Haig, whilst Nivelle, the French Commander-in-Chief (who spoke fluent English),[221] would exercise operational command of the British Forces, through a British staff officer – Wilson was probably earmarked for this job. This plan fell through after Haig and Robertson threatened resignation. Wilson confessed to Derby that he did not get on with Haig or Robertson and told Robertson he wanted to return to commanding a corps. Hankey brokered an agreement whereby Haig would be subordinate to Nivelle only for the duration of the coming offensive and Wilson would do the liaison job but reporting to Haig. Haig asked him to accept \"as a favour\", but Robertson was \"staggered\" by Wilson demanding and getting a formal invitation from Haig, Nivelle and the War Cabinet, and a clear statement of his own and Haig's status. Nivelle came to Wilson's London house to beg him to accept. Wilson was appointed Chief of British Mission to the French Army on 17 March, with a promotion to permanent lieutenant-general which Robertson had blocked in November 1916. Gough wrote a damning letter to Stamfordham (i.e. for the King to see) complaining of how Wilson had made little impact either as a staff officer in 1914 or as a corps commander, but had a great reputation throughout the army for intrigue and for \"talk\". However, the appointment was welcomed by Curzon, and the King and Esher also urged Haig and Robertson to accept the deal.[222]\n\nThe new French War Minister Painlevé had a low opinion of Nivelle's plan to achieve a decisive \"rupture\", and after it failed he clearly wanted to sack Nivelle (contrary to Wilson's advice on 26 April) and replace him with Pétain, who favoured abstaining from major offensives until the Americans were present in strength. Wilson did not agree with this, although the alternatives were whirlwind attacks like those Nivelle had launched at Verdun in late 1916 or – Wilson's preference – a major attritional offensive like the Somme but \"with intelligence\".[223] He compared \"the school of the Great Offensive, of large numbers on long fronts, for unlimited objectives\" with the alternative of small and sudden offensives, and opined that \"both schools were wrong, and have been proved wrong over and over again\". He urged \"a middle course of big operations on long fronts for limited objectives\" which would cause \"maximum of damage to the enemy with a minimum of loss to ourselves\" and keep the Germans \"in a state of constant tension and anxiety\". (30 April 1917).[224] Wilson was pleased with the promotion of his friend Foch to be French Chief of Staff but not the promotion of Pétain as French Commander-in-Chief (10 May) – Wilson was seen as pro-Nivelle and Petain soon began to deal directly with Haig, leaving little justification for Wilson's job.[223]\n\nRobertson suggested once again that Wilson should return to commanding a corps, but Foch thought this a poor use of his talents. Haig's diary states that Painlevé had told Lloyd George that Wilson was no longer persona grata with the French government. Wilson returned to London to sound out opinion about resigning and nobody tried to dissuade him. Whilst he was in London Lloyd George asked him to brief the War Cabinet individually then collectively with his advice that Britain try for some military or diplomatic success to drive Turkey or Bulgaria out of the war. On return to France Wilson declined Haig's offer to command XIII Corps. Wilson then took a tour of the French line all the way down to the Swiss frontier, and was concerned that revolution seemed a possibility in France. He attempted to get a final interview with Painlevé but left after being kept waiting in a lobby with \"a pronounced whore\". He had a meeting with Haig, who was encouraged by the recent success at Messines, and agreed with Haig's plan for a major offensive in Flanders provided the weather remained favourable (Wilson was \"absolutely convinced that we should attack all we could right up to the time of the mud\") .[225]\n\nPossible entry into politics\n\n[edit]\n\nThe fall of Wilson's ally Nivelle, and his awkward relations with his successor Pétain and with Haig and Robertson (he thought the latter were \"dunderheads\") left Wilson without a post.[226] Shuttling between England and France in June 1917,[227] Wilson contemplated standing for Parliament. Back in 1916 the Conservative Party chairman Arthur Steel-Maitland had offered to get him a seat. Esher and Duncannon proposed forming a new \"National\" party of 20–30 MPs. The new party's policies would include more vigorous prosecution of the war – Wilson urged the extension of conscription to Ireland – and the detachment of Turkey and Bulgaria. Wilson was worried that it would be the end of his army career and was short of money. His brother Jemmy proposed getting him an Ulster seat, and thought that the prospect of Wilson as an MP would annoy Robertson, but the Irish Unionist leader Carson thought an English seat more sensible. Bonar Law was dismissive of Wilson's hopes that, like J. C. Smuts, he might be invited to join the War Policy Committee, and also poured cold water on the idea of Wilson becoming an MP. Wilson did not agree with Milner's suggestion that he succeed Sarrail as Commander-in-Chief at Salonika. Éamon de Valera of Sinn Féin had recently won the East Clare by-election and on a visit to Currygrane (his first in eight years) everyone Wilson spoke to – judges, landowners, police officers, a Redmondite local politician and \"some natives\" agreed on the need for Irish conscription. Wilson, a lifelong Unionist, seems not to have anticipated the political consequences of such a move.[228]\n\nBrock Millman argues that the threat to stand for Parliament, where he could have intrigued as a Unionist along with his friends such as Bonar Law, Leo Amery and Colonel Lord Percy, ADC to the King, was blackmail to get a military job out of Lloyd George.[229] Keith Jeffery rejects Millman's approach, arguing that Wilson would have been no threat as a new MP but as a military adviser was a useful rival to Robertson.[230] However, Robertson told Wilson directly in a meeting on 4 July that there was simply no job available for him.[231] Moreover, Wilson was surprised to learn that if he entered the House of Commons he would lose his army half pay.[232]\n\nEastern Command\n\n[edit]\n\nWith the Third Battle of Ypres, to which the War Cabinet had reluctantly agreed on condition that it did not degenerate into a long-drawn out fight like the Somme, already bogged down in unseasonably early wet weather, Viscount French (14 August 1917) told Riddell (managing director of the News of the World, and likely to pass on French's views to Lloyd George) that Henry Wilson's talents were being wasted, and that the government was not ascertaining \"the views of our leading soldiers\". Wilson thought \"ridiculous and unworkable\" a suggestion by Lloyd George that all Robertson's plans be submitted to a committee of French, Wilson and one other, and over lunch with French and Lloyd George on 23 August suggested an inter-Allied body of three Prime Ministers and three soldiers be set up over all the national Staffs. Lloyd George agreed, telling Wilson that he should be the British military member, and told him to sell the plan to the rest of the War Cabinet. Wilson also suggested that the autumn and winter mud in Flanders would be an ideal time to build on recent successes in Palestine and Mesopotamia without interfering with Western Front Offensives in 1918.[233]\n\nIn late August 1917 Wilson turned down a chance to go on the mission to the US, as he did not get on with Lord Northcliffe, the mission leader.[234] He took up Eastern Command, whose headquarters were conveniently at 50 Pall Mall in London, on 1 September 1917, enabling him to work closely with Prime Minister David Lloyd George.[1][235]\n\nThe War Cabinet (11 October 1917) invited Wilson and French to submit formal written advice, a blatant undermining of Robertson's position. Dining with Wilson and French the night before, Lloyd George criticised Robertson and called Haig's recent paper (8 October), which predicted that \"decisive success is expected next year\" provided Russia continued to pin down as many German divisions as currently, \"preposterous\". Wilson consulted Macdonogh (Director of Military Intelligence at the War Office) who held out little prospect of breaking the German Army but thought \"the heart of the German people\" might break in a year, and Macready (Adjutant-General) who warned that the British Army was facing a shortfall of 300,000 men by that time. Over lunch on 17 October Lloyd George wanted Wilson's paper rewritten to remove \"all semblance of dictation\" by the new inter-Allied body.[236] Wilson thought Haig's assumption that Russia would continue to fight was \"a large one\" and once again urged winter offensives against Turkey and Bulgaria. He affirmed that he was in principle a \"Westerner\" but wrote that it was \"no use throwing \"decisive numbers at the decisive time at the decisive place\" if \"the decisive numbers do not exist, the decisive hour has not yet struck and if the decisive place is ill-chosen\" \". Winston Churchill later wrote \"In Sir Henry Wilson the War Cabinet found for the first time an expert advisor of superior intellect, who could explain lucidly and forcefully the whole situation and give reasons for the adoption or rejection of any course\".[237][238]\n\nWilson delivered copies of the two papers to Hankey on 20 October; on 24 October Wilson breakfasted with Derby, who warned him that he had not yet submitted the papers as French's was \"too personal\" and Wilson's \"too unanswerable\". At the Prime Minister's request Wilson helped tone down French's criticisms of Robertson. On 26 October papers were at last sent to the CIGS, having been overtaken by disaster on the Italian front. The Battle of Caporetto began on 24 October, which Wilson was worried might lead to revolution in Italy.[239]\n\nSupreme War Council\n\n[edit]\n\nLloyd George told Wilson that he was to be the British Military Representative on the Supreme War Council, and that although he disliked his politics he admired him \"as a man & a soldier\" and that the future of the war rested in his shoulders – Milner told him much the same, adding that it was \"the eleventh hour\". Hankey also wrote to Lloyd George that Wilson was uniquely qualified for the job, owing in part to his close relations with the French Army and personal friendship with Foch. Wilson accompanied Lloyd George, Smuts and Hankey to the Rapallo Conference which set up the SWC (7 November). When he arrived on 5 November he met Robertson who had gone on ahead to supervise the transfer of British reinforcements to Italy – under questioning from Wilson Robertson said that he would not have done anything differently over the last two years – which Wilson thought \"curious\", noting that \"since he has been CIGS we have lost Roumania, Russia & Italy & have gained Bullecourt, Messines & Paschendal [sic]\".[239]\n\nWilson, sent to inspect the Italian Front, was worried that Venice might fall and on behalf of the SWC ordered the new Italian commander Diaz to construct new defensive positions on the River Brenta, which in the event were not needed as the line of the River Piave held.[240]\n\nLloyd George persuaded the War Cabinet that although Wilson was subject to the authority of the Army Council he should nonetheless have \"unfettered\" discretion as to the advice he gave. Wilson insisted to Robertson that there was no \"duality of advice\" as he spoke only on behalf of the SWC. Lloyd George also asked Wilson to send his reports directly to him, not through Robertson. On the train to the initial SWC meeting at the Hotel Trianon at Versailles Lloyd George, Milner and Wilson had \"long talks\" about Derby and Robertson's obstruction. Wilson correctly guessed that Foch would eventually become Allied generalissimo. Clemenceau was in the chair (1 December 1917), and his speech, drafted by Hankey, tasked the military representatives with studying the prospects for the 1918 campaign, and in particular whether German defeat would be best brought about by attacks on her allies.[241][242]\n\nAt the time, Allenby's successes, culminating in the Fall of Jerusalem (9 December 1917), demonstrated the potential of attacks in the Middle East, compared to Haig's offensives at Ypres and at Cambrai in November (initial British success followed by German retaking of gains). Russia had finally collapsed (Brest Litovsk Armistice 16 December) yet only a handful of American divisions were available so far in the west.[241] But with hindsight, it is unclear that stronger commitment to the Palestine front in the winter of 1917–18 would have led to great results, as that winter saw some of the heaviest rain in the region in living memory. Conversely, the success of the German 1918 Spring Offensives demonstrated that the Western Front was not as secure as Wilson believed.[243]\n\nIn December 1917 Wilson was given the temporary rank of general.[244]\n\nThe military representatives, egged on by Wilson, beginning 13 December 1917, recommended coordinated defence and reserves from the North Sea to the Adriatic, as well as reorganisation of the Belgian Army and preparing studies of the Italian and Salonika fronts. Wilson worked even on Christmas Day. He set up three main sections \"Allied\" and \"Enemy\" operations, and \"Material and Manpower\" – the latter under Frederick Sykes covered both sides and included air power. There was also a \"Political\" Branch under Leo Amery, although he reported to Hankey back in London. However, Rawlinson was unimpressed by the calibre of Wilson's staff and the young Archibald Wavell thought the atmosphere overly pessimistic. That month Wilson defended Haig to Clemenceau and Foch, both of whom wanted him removed (Clemenceau preferred Allenby as Haig's replacement, Foch preferred Plumer), telling Clemenceau that Haig was the right man for the \"bad times\" which were coming, although he was critical of Robertson.[245]\n\nWilson had his staff play a \"war game\", in which some of them had reversed their hats pretending to be German, which he demonstrated to important visitors and the contents of which became Joint Note 12. Wilson advised that the British line should be extended between the River Ailette and the Soissons-Laon Road. Haig was bored when shown it (11 January 1918) and read a memorandum in his hand, although a large part of the reason for setting up the SWC had been the poor intelligence and advice which Haig had been receiving from Charteris. Many of Wilson's predictions for the timing and location of the German offensive proved to be wrong.[246][247] Although Lloyd George would later (9 April) praise Wilson in the House of Commons for forecasting the date and time of the German offensive, he had in fact explicitly rejected the Somme as a sector and had predicted that 1 May or later would be the likely date of the attack.[248]\n\nSWC Joint Note 12 declared that, leaving aside improbables such as Central Powers internal collapse or Russian revival, neither side could win a decisive victory on the Western Front in 1918, although decisive results could be had against Turkey (although, at French insistence, no further troops were to be sent), possibly leading to diversion of German troops and encouragement of pro-Allied elements in Romania and southern Russia. Haig thought \"Wilson is playing the tune called by Lloyd George\" and Robertson, who opposed efforts against Turkey, thought it \"d-----d rot in general\". Joint Note 12 and Note 14 proposing the formation of a General Reserve were discussed at the second full session of the SWC (30 January – 2 February). In accordance with Lloyd George's wishes an Executive Board was set up to control the General Reserve, under Foch (with Wilson as his deputy). Robertson asked to be on the Board but was overruled. Wilson for the first time (2 February 1918) wrote explicitly in his diary of \"the long duel between (himself) and Robertson\" and speculated that Robertson might resign after his \"complete defeat\".[249]\n\nWilson seems from his diary not to have particularly welcomed the suggestion that he become CIGS. When told by Milner of rumours that he was to be given Robertson's job he said that he preferred to be given ever more power at Versailles where he was building up a prestigious post for himself, with Robertson reduced \"from the position of a Master to that of a servant\". Milner told Wilson (10 February) that Lloyd George wanted to move Robertson to Versailles. Ironically, if he became CIGS he wanted Robertson (whom he thought would refuse) or whoever else replaced him at Versailles to report to himself. There was talk of the government falling, Rawlinson writing to H. A. Gwynne (14 February 1918) that the best solution was to give Robertson a powerful role at Versailles and have Wilson as a weak CIGS in London \"where he will not be able to do much mischief – especially if Squiff replaced LG as PM\".[250]\n\nChief of the Imperial General Staff: 1918\n\n[edit]\n\nGerman March offensive\n\n[edit]\n\nOn 19 February 1918 Wilson was appointed Chief of the Imperial General Staff ('CIGS'),[251] after the removal of Robertson[252] and was the principal military adviser to Lloyd George in the last year of the First World War.[253] As CIGS, he was a member of the Army Council.[254][255][256][257][258][259][260][261][262][263][264] One of his first acts was to nearly triple the size of the Tank Corps from 18,000 to 46,000 men[237] He argued for \"turning out some of our senior generals & starting a flow of promotion\". A purge of corps commanders, including the corps commanders from the Battle of Cambrai (Pulteney, Snow and Woollcombe), was carried out in the early months of 1918. (Wilson diary 7 February and 7 March 1918).[265]\n\nFoch was pleased at Wilson's appointment, although Haig noted in his diary that Wilson was no longer so keen on a strong staff under Rawlinson, his successor at Versailles. Rawlinson for his part supported Haig's unwillingness to release any divisions to the General Reserve. Petain only agreed to release 8 French divisions and made a bilateral agreement with Haig to assist one another. Wilson protested to Lloyd George, who commented that Haig's attitude w"
