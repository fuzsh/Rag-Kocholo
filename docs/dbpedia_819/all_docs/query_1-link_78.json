        "text": "Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales is still over a month away from its Memorial Day release, but Brenton Thwaites recently discussed what we can expect from his character Henry Turner, who has been revealed as the son of the returning Will Turner, once again played by Orlando Bloom.\n\nSpeaking to USA Today, Thwaites described Henry Turner as “a guy who wants to do good and help people. Us young men are always trying to break the curse of our fathers. It will never end.” While not a direct quote from the actor himself, the character is also said to have “belief in the supernatural and mythologies [that] gets him in trouble”.\n\nSEE ALSO: Orlando Bloom’s Will Turner featured in new Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales TV spot\n\nJohnny Depp returns to the big screen as the iconic, swashbuckling anti-hero Jack Sparrow in the all-new “Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales.” The rip-roaring adventure finds down-on-his-luck Captain Jack feeling the winds of ill-fortune blowing strongly his way when deadly ghost sailors, led by the terrifying Captain Salazer (Javier Bardem), escape from the Devil’s Triangle bent on killing every pirate at sea – notably Jack. Jack’s only hope of survival lies in the legendary Trident of Poseidon, but to find it he must forge an uneasy alliance with Carina Smyth (Kaya Scodelario), a brilliant and beautiful astronomer, and Henry (Brenton Thwaites), a headstrong young sailor in the Royal Navy. At the helm of the Dying Gull, his pitifully small and shabby ship, Captain Jack seeks not only to reverse his recent spate of ill fortune but to save his very life from the most formidable and malicious foe he has never faced.\n\nSEE ALSO: Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales gets a batch of new images"
