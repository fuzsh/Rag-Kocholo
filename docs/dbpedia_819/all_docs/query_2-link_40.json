Ryan, though born in the United States, was raised in Tokyo until the age of seven.\n\nRyan got his start as the lead, \"Mike Fukanaga\" in Nickelodeon's \"Supah Ninjas,\" (2011-2013) working with the legendary, George Takei, who played his grandfather.\n\nIn 2014, he starred in Disney's animated superhero blockbuster, Big Hero 6. He voiced the lead character, Hiro Hamada, a child prodigy who teams with a large robot. The film was released in the U.S. at #1 and won the Academy Award for Best Animated Feature in 2015. He went on to voice the same character for the animated television show, Disney's Big Hero 6: The Series (2017...)\n\nRyan as of late, devotes most of his energy to raising awareness on water scarcity and security through his company Clear Matter. He is committed to championing the revolutionary technology of Moses West, a retired US hall of fame veteran that has built the Atmospheric Water Generator. Through building a recognizable brand, Potter will raise awareness globally on the importance of AWG technology and its ability to create water in a water scarce future.\n\nTeagan Croft is an Australian actress.\n\nCroft's career began when she played the part of Scout Finch in a theatrical adaptation of To Kill a Mockingbird when she was nine years old. She garnered enough attention to land the lead role in the 2016 film The Osiris Child. That same year, Croft had a recurring role as Bella Loneragan in Home and Away. In August 2017, she was cast as the DC Comics character Raven in the DC Universe series Titans, which premiered on October 12, 2018.\n\nCroft has two sisters.

He is of Czech, English, and German descent. Frequently relocating as the middle son of a military family, Alan learned to adapt and entertain in order to build friendships in new and unfamiliar environments. Certainly this has been a key ingredient in his success so far in the industry.\n\nAlan's early credits include portraying Aquaman in the long running series Smallville. This marked the first portrayal of the superhero in an officially licensed live-action production.\n\nRitchson has also taken on grittier leading man roles in the independent film market with the modern-day western \"Rex\" and the dramatic love story of \"Steam\" alongside Ally Sheedy.\n\nIn contrast, he also made quite a comedic impression with his love-to-hate-him character of Thad Castle on the football comedy Blue Mountain State.

He also portrayed the cool-but-crude Raphael in the Michael Bay produced reboot of TMNT.\n\nAmerican actress Conor Leslie began her career at age 15, acting in commercials and the unaired pilot for Spike Lee's M.O.N.Y.

Her most prominent roles have been as young courtesan Sabine in Klondike (2014), chipper computer Natasha in Other Space (2015), and gubernatorial aide Sarah Ellis in Shots Fired (2017).

Leslie played the lead in Zelda Williams's short film Shrimp (2018) about dominatrixes at a BDSM den, which is being pursued as a possible series.\n\nShe currently appears as Donna Troy / Wonder Girl on Titans (2018).\n\nAnna Diop is a Senegalese-American actress.\n\nDiop was born in Senegal, but moved to United States when she was six.
