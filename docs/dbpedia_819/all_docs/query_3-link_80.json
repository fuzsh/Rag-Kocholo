        "text": "Joseph is right. Modest capability and you'll retire at LTC. Making it to Colonel means you made it through one fairly discriminating cut. Getting a star means you were good at your job.\n\nIf you are a career officer (20 years) and of modest ability, it's likely your last rank before retiring\n\nThat's why I was curious. It seems like most people who aren't screw-ups make it to LTC. Is Major also considered a high rank?\n\nWhat I don't understand is this: A lot of LTCs are near the end of their careers, but someone who is a Brigadier General is really almost just starting out-- at least if they're on the path to hold four star rank.\n\nJoseph is right.

Also note that a lot - A LOT - of long-time LTC retire as COL, as they are promoted after they signal their intention to retire. (Have always been curious as to how much money this costs taxpayers)\n\nSecond, unless you're George McClellan, nobody who makes BG is \"almost just starting out.\" Almost nobody makes BG until after they're 50, which means they've been in 25-28 years. By that time - at least by the mid-50s, or 30 years in - guys who are still LTC see the writing on the wall, and retire.\n\nThese alignments between time served (30 years full pension) and promotion are not coincidences, in case you're wondering."
