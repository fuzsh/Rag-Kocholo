        "text": "Lieutenant colonels (LTCs) are an essential part of the U.S. Army. These field-grade military officers don’t just lead a squad or a platoon. They lead an entire battalion, which typically includes around 300 to 1,000 soldiers. As a result, they’re well-compensated for their work, but this isn’t a career you can jump into immediately. It takes years of training, which is reflected in a lieutenant colonel’s salary.\n\nLieutenant colonels are found all across the armed forces. There are lieutenant colonels in the Marines and Air Force, and in the Navy, the equivalent rank is commander. Although the basic pay rate is similar across the board because it’s established by the National Defense Authorization Act, those in this position see more than just a base salary. The overall compensation is calculated by adding a number of factors.\n\nTip\n\nLieutenant colonels in the U.S. Army make an average total salary of $95,085.05 to $143,548 per year.\n\nLieutenant Colonel Job Description\n\nA lieutenant colonel is a senior commissioned officer ranking above a major and directly below a colonel. According to FederalPay.org, LTCs are tasked with leading a battalion of between 300 to 1,000 people and have final authority on everything that occurs within the battalion.\n\nDepending on prior training and education, some LTC Army officers may work as physicians or attorneys, while others take on more traditional military occupational roles, such as engineering, aviation, law enforcement or intelligence. Some LTC Army officers also serve as executive officers or staff officers at high-level posts.\n\nLieutenant Colonel Salary\n\nLieutenant colonels are designated as an O-5 grade position, which means that it’s the fifth step on the Department of Defense’s commissioned officer pay scale. This doesn’t change, regardless of the particular branch of the armed forces. A lieutenant colonel in the Army makes the same as a lieutenant colonel in the Marines and the same as a commander in the Navy.\n\nOn average, a lieutenant colonel salary is between $95,085.05 to $143,548 per year, according to Military-Ranks.org. This figure includes the following additional compensation:\n\nBasic allowance for housing (BAH): The average of BAH is $1,892.13 a month for someone with no dependents and $2,349.26 for someone with dependents.\n\nBasic allowance for subsistence (BAS): The average BAS rate is $253.63.\n\nHazard pay: Lieutenant colonels can receive $250 per month in hazard pay while serving in an active combat zone or being subject to other hazards, such as hostile fire.\n\nLieutenant Colonel Education Requirements\n\nA bachelor’s degree is a requirement, whether you want to become an LTC Army officer or a lieutenant colonel Marine. The U.S. Army recommends undergraduates attend either:\n\nA U.S. military academy, with West Point generally considered the top academy\n\nAn Army Reserve Officers’ Training Corps (ROTC) program, which is available at universities across the country.\n\nAfter completing this type of education, students graduate as second lieutenants and can advance to a lieutenant colonel from there. Hopeful officers who complete a four-year college degree without military-specific training must attend Officer Candidate School (OCS). In addition, highly educated professionals in fields like law, medicine, or religion may be directly appointed as officers and rise in the ranks like everyone else.\n\nYears of Experience\n\nLieutenant colonel is a rank a person earns. It often takes 16 to 22 years serving in the armed forces to reach this rank. Most often, LTC Army officers gain their rank after being promoted from the rank of major. Particularly well-trained, experienced officers or those who show immense leadership skills can be promoted from lower ranks.\n\nThe lieutenant colonel salary increases with time, with an average base pay projection being:\n\n0-2 years: $69,3360 per year\n\n2-6 years: $78,109 - $87,908 per year\n\n8-12 years: $89,924 - $97,624 per year\n\n14-20 years: $101,833 - $114,361 per year\n\nMore than 22 years: $117,799 per year."
