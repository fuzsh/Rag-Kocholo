        "text": "We celebrate outstanding academic performance in the MBA Program in several different ways. Academic honors are determined on the basis of the Wharton Grade Point Average (GPA) during the fall and spring semesters (summer courses are excluded from consideration for honors, with the exception of courses taken by three-year JD/MBA students in the summer preceding Pre-Term).\n\nThe GPA is determined by assigning the following numerical weights to the letter grades received in Wharton MBA courses: A=4 points, B=3 points, C=2 points, D=1 point, and F=0 points, with + (plus) increasing the full grade value by .33 and – (minus) decreasing the full grade value by .33. A+’s carry a 4.0 point value, a University of Pennsylvania policy.\n\nCourses taken outside the Wharton MBA program are not included in the GPA computation. Thus, the GPA reflected on the transcript may not be the one used to compute academic honors as the transcript GPA reflects all coursework taken at the University of Pennsylvania. Courses taken on a Pass/Fail basis are not included in the GPA calculation unless a Fail grade is earned. To be eligible for academic honors, the student may not have any grades of Fail (for the Director’s List, this applies only to the semester under consideration). All academic honors are noted on the student’s academic transcript.\n\nStudents with violations to the MBA Code of Ethics are not eligible for Academic Awards. Furthermore, Academic Awards may be revoked following MBA Code of Ethics violation."
