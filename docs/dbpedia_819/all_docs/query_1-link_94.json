        "meta_description": "Abstract. Thwaites Glacier (TG), West Antarctica, has experienced rapid,\npotentially irreversible grounding line retreat and mass loss in response to\nenhanced ice shelf melting. Results from recent numerical models suggest a\nlarge spread in the evolution of the glacier in the coming decades to a\ncentury. It is therefore important to investigate how different\napproximations of the ice stress balance, parameterizations of basal\nfriction and ice shelf melt parameterizations may affect projections. Here,\nwe simulate the evolution of TG using ice sheet models of varying levels of\ncomplexity, different basal friction laws and ice shelf melt to quantify\ntheir effect on the projections. We find that the grounding line retreat and\nits sensitivity to ice shelf melt are enhanced when a full-Stokes model is\nused, a Budd friction is used and ice shelf melt is applied on partially\nfloating elements. Initial conditions also impact the model results. Yet, all\nsimulations suggest a rapid, sustained retreat of the glacier along the same\npreferred pathway. The fastest retreat rate occurs on the eastern side of the\nglacier, and the slowest retreat occurs across a subglacial ridge on the\nwestern side. All the simulations indicate that TG will undergo an\naccelerated retreat once the glacier retreats past the western subglacial\nridge. Combining all the simulations, we find that the uncertainty of the\nprojections is small in the first 30Â years, with a cumulative contribution to\nsea level rise of 5âmm, similar to the current rate. After 30Â years, the\ncontribution to sea level depends on the model configurations, with\ndifferences up to 300â% over the next 100Â years, ranging from 14 to 42âmm.",

MISMIP+ is one in a series of exercises that test numerical models of ice sheet flow in simple situations. This particular exercise concentrates on the response of ice sheet models to the thinning of their floating ice shelves, which is of interest because numerical models are currently used to model the response to contemporary and near-future thinning in Antarctic ice shelves.\n\nIceberg calving of Thwaites Glacier, West Antarctica: full-Stokes modeling combined with linear elastic fracture mechanics\n\nHongju Yu, Eric Rignot, Mathieu Morlighem, and Helene Seroussi\n\nThe Cryosphere, 11, 1283–1296, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-11-1283-2017,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-11-1283-2017, 2017\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe combine 2-D ice flow model with linear elastic fracture mechanics (LEFM) to model the calving behavior of Thwaites Glacier, West Antarctica. We find the combination of full-Stokes (FS) model and LEFM produces crevasses that are consistent with observations. We also find that calving is enhanced with pre-existing surface crevasses, shorter ice shelves or undercut at the ice shelf front. We conclude that the FS/LEFM combination is capable of constraining crevasse formation and iceberg calving.\n\nFull-Stokes modeling of grounding line dynamics, ice melt and iceberg calving for Thwaites Glacier, West Antarctica\n\nHongju Yu, Eric Rignot, Mathieu Morlighem, and Helene Seroussi\n\nThe Cryosphere Discuss., https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-2016-101,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-2016-101, 2016\n\nRevised manuscript not accepted\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe performed a 2D Full-Stokes (FS) modeling study of grounding line dynamics and calving of Thwaites Glacier, West Antarctica. We compare FS with simplified models on grounding line migration and we combine FS with Linear Elastic Fracture Mechanics to simulate crevasse propagation. We find that only FS is able to provide reliable grounding line migration and to explain observed crevasse. We conclude that it may be essential to employ FS in the grounding line region for 2D simulations.\n\nIce sheet model simulations reveal polythermal ice conditions existed across the NE USA during the Last Glacial Maximum\n\nJoshua Cuzzone, Aaron Barth, Kelsey Barker, and Mathieu Morlighem\n\nEGUsphere, https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-2091,https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-2091, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe use an ice sheet model to simulate the Last Glacial Maximum conditions of the Laurentide Ice Sheet (LIS) across the Northeast United States. A complex thermal history existed for the (LIS), that allowed for high erosion across most of the NE USA, but prevented erosion across high elevation mountain peaks and areas where ice flow was slow. This has implications for geologic studies which rely on the erosional nature of the LIS to reconstruct its glacial history and landscape evolution.\n\nCalibrating calving parameterizations using graph neural network emulators: Application to Helheim Glacier, East Greenland\n\nYounghyun Koo, Gong Cheng, Mathieu Morlighem, and Maryam Rahnemoonfar\n\nEGUsphere, https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-1620,https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-1620, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nCalving, the breaking of ice bodies from the terminus of a glacier, plays an important role in the mass losses of Greenland ice sheets. However, calving parameters have been poorly understood because of the intensive computational demands of traditional numerical models. To address this issue and find the optimal calving parameter that best represents real observations, we develop deep-learning emulators based on graph neural network architectures.\n\nDisentangling the drivers behind the post-2000 retreat of Sermeq Kujalleq, Greenland (Jakobshavn Isbrae)\n\nZiad Rashed, Alexander Robel, and Helene Seroussi\n\nEGUsphere, https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-1435,https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-1435, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nSermeq Kujalleq, Greenland's largest glacier, has significantly retreated since the late 1990s in response to warming ocean temperatures. Using a large ensemble approach, our simulations show that the retreat is mainly initiated by the arrival of warm water but sustained and accelerated by the glacier's position over deeper bed troughs and vigorous calving. We highlight the need for models of ice mélange to project glacier behavior under rapid calving regimes.\n\nImpact of boundary conditions on the modeled thermal regime of the Antarctic ice sheet\n\nIn-Woo Park, Emilia Kyung Jin, Mathieu Morlighem, and Kang-Kun Lee\n\nThe Cryosphere, 18, 1139–1155, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-18-1139-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-18-1139-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThis study conducted 3D thermodynamic ice sheet model experiments, and modeled temperatures were compared with 15 observed borehole temperature profiles. We found that using incompressibility of ice without sliding agrees well with observed temperature profiles in slow-flow regions, while incorporating sliding in fast-flow regions captures observed temperature profiles. Also, the choice of vertical velocity scheme has a greater impact on the shape of the modeled temperature profile.\n\nISMIP6-based Antarctic Projections to 2100: simulations with the BISICLES ice sheet model\n\nJames F. O'Neill, Tamsin L. Edwards, Daniel F. Martin, Courtney Shafer, Stephen L. Cornford, Helene L. Seroussi, Sophie Nowicki, and Mira Adhikari\n\nEGUsphere, https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-441,https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-441, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe use an ice sheet model to simulate the Antarctic contribution to sea level over the 21st century, under a range of future climates, varying how sensitive the ice sheet is to different processes. We find that, under stronger warming scenarios, ocean temperatures increases and more snow falls on the ice sheet. When the ice sheet is sensitive to ocean warming, ocean melting driven loss exceeds snowfall driven gains, so that the sea level contribution is greater with more climate warming.\n\nGraphics-processing-unit-accelerated ice flow solver for unstructured meshes using the Shallow-Shelf Approximation (FastIceFlo v1.0.1)\n\nAnjali Sandip, Ludovic RÃ¤ss, and Mathieu Morlighem\n\nGeosci. Model Dev., 17, 899–909, https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-17-899-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-17-899-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe solve momentum balance for unstructured meshes to predict ice flow for real glaciers using a pseudo-transient method on graphics processing units (GPUs) and compare it to a standard central processing unit (CPU) implementation. We justify the GPU implementation by applying the price-to-performance metric for up to million-grid-point spatial resolutions. This study represents a first step toward leveraging GPU processing power, enabling more accurate polar ice discharge predictions.\n\nExperimental design for the marine ice sheet and ocean model intercomparison project – phase 2 (MISOMIP2)\n\nJan De Rydt, Nicolas C. Jourdain, Yoshihiro Nakayama, Mathias van Caspel, Ralph Timmermann, Pierre Mathiot, Xylar S. Asay-Davis, HÃ©lÃ¨ne Seroussi, Pierre Dutrieux, Ben Galton-Fenzi, David Holland, and Ronja Reese\n\nEGUsphere, https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-95,https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-95, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nGlobal climate models do not reliably simulate sea-level change arising from ice sheet-ocean interactions. We propose a community modelling effort to conduct a series of well-defined experiments to compare models with observations, and study how models respond to a range of perturbations in climate and ice-sheet geometry. The 2nd Marine Ice Sheet Ocean Model Intercomparison Project, will continue to lay the groundwork for including ice sheet-ocean interactions in global scale, IPCC class models.\n\nImpact of time-dependent data assimilation on ice flow model initialization and projections: a case study of Kjer Glacier, Greenland\n\nYoungmin Choi, Helene Seroussi, Mathieu Morlighem, Nicole-Jeanne Schlegel, and Alex Gardner\n\nThe Cryosphere, 17, 5499–5517, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-17-5499-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-17-5499-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nIce sheet models are often initialized using snapshot observations of present-day conditions, but this approach has limitations in capturing the transient evolution of the system. To more accurately represent the accelerating changes in glaciers, we employed time-dependent data assimilation. We found that models calibrated with the transient data better capture past trends and more accurately reproduce changes after the calibration period, even with limited observations.\n\nModelling GNSS-observed seasonal velocity changes of the Ross Ice Shelf, Antarctica, using the Ice-sheet and Sea-level System Model (ISSM)\n\nFrancesca Baldacchino, Nicholas R. Golledge, Huw Horgan, Mathieu Morlighem, Alanna V. Alevropoulos-Borrill, Alena Malyarenko, Alexandra Gossart, Daniel P. Lowry, and Laurine van Haastrecht\n\nEGUsphere, https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2023-2793,https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2023-2793, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nUnderstanding how the Ross Ice Shelf flow is changing in a warming world is important for monitoring mass changes. The flow displays an intra-annual variation; however, it is unclear what mechanisms drive this variability. Sensitivity maps are modelled showing areas of the ice shelf where changes in basal melt most influence the ice flow. We suggest that basal melting partly drives the flow variability along the calving front of the ice shelf and will continue to do so in a warming world.\n\nInsights into the vulnerability of Antarctic glaciers from the ISMIP6 ice sheet model ensemble and associated uncertainty\n\nHÃ©lÃ¨ne Seroussi, Vincent Verjans, Sophie Nowicki, Antony J.

We highlight here the Antarctic glaciers showing the largest changes and quantify the main sources of uncertainty in their future evolution using an ensemble of ice flow models. We show that on top of Pine Island and Thwaites glaciers, Totten and Moscow University glaciers show rapid changes and a strong sensitivity to warmer ocean conditions.\n\nEvaluation of four calving laws for Antarctic ice shelves\n\nJoel A. Wilner, Mathieu Morlighem, and Gong Cheng\n\nThe Cryosphere, 17, 4889–4901, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-17-4889-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-17-4889-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe use numerical modeling to study iceberg calving off of ice shelves in Antarctica. We examine four widely used mathematical descriptions of calving (calving laws), under the assumption that Antarctic ice shelf front positions should be in steady state under the current climate forcing. We quantify how well each of these calving laws replicates the observed front positions. Our results suggest that the eigencalving and von Mises laws are most suitable for Antarctic ice shelves.\n\nNumerical stabilization methods for level-set-based ice front migration\n\nGong Cheng, Mathieu Morlighem, and G. Hilmar Gudmundsson\n\nGeosci. Model Dev. Discuss., https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-2023-194,https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-2023-194, 2023\n\nRevised manuscript accepted for GMD\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe conducted a comprehensive analysis of the stabilization and reinitialization techniques currently employed in ISSM and Ua for solving level-set equations, specifically those related to the dynamic representation of moving ice fronts within numerical ice sheet models. Our results demonstrate that the Streamline Upwinding Petrov Galerkin (SUPG) method outperforms the other approaches. We found that excessively frequent reinitialization can lead to exceptionally high errors in simulations.\n\nAntarctic Bedmap data: Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable (FAIR) sharing of 60 years of ice bed, surface, and thickness data\n\nAlice C.

Here, we present a new record of the Earthâs polar ice sheet mass balance produced by aggregating 50 satellite-based estimates of ice sheet mass change. This new assessment shows that the ice sheets have lost (7.5 x 1012) t of ice between 1992 and 2020, contributing 21 mm to sea level rise.\n\nThe Stochastic Ice-Sheet and Sea-Level System Model v1.0 (StISSM v1.0)\n\nVincent Verjans, Alexander A. Robel, Helene Seroussi, Lizz Ultee, and Andrew F. Thompson\n\nGeosci. Model Dev., 15, 8269–8293, https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-15-8269-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-15-8269-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe describe the development of the first large-scale ice sheet model that accounts for stochasticity in a range of processes. Stochasticity allows the impacts of inherently uncertain processes on ice sheets to be represented. This includes climatic uncertainty, as the climate is inherently chaotic. Furthermore, stochastic capabilities also encompass poorly constrained glaciological processes that display strong variability at fine spatiotemporal scales. We present the model and test experiments.\n\nSensitivity of the Ross Ice Shelf to environmental and glaciological controls\n\nFrancesca Baldacchino, Mathieu Morlighem, Nicholas R. Golledge, Huw Horgan, and Alena Malyarenko\n\nThe Cryosphere, 16, 3723–3738, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-16-3723-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-16-3723-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nUnderstanding how the Ross Ice Shelf will evolve in a warming world is important to the future stability of Antarctica. It remains unclear what changes could drive the largest mass loss in the future and where places are most likely to trigger larger mass losses. Sensitivity maps are modelled showing that the RIS is sensitive to changes in environmental and glaciological controls at regions which are currently experiencing changes. These regions need to be monitored in a warming world.\n\nOngoing grounding line retreat and fracturing initiated at the Petermann Glacier ice shelf, Greenland, after 2016\n\nRomain Millan, Jeremie Mouginot, Anna Derkacheva, Eric Rignot, Pietro Milillo, Enrico Ciraci, Luigi Dini, and Anders BjÃ¸rk\n\nThe Cryosphere, 16, 3021–3031, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-16-3021-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-16-3021-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe detect for the first time a dramatic retreat of the grounding line of Petermann Glacier, a major glacier of the Greenland Ice Sheet. Using satellite data, we also observe a speedup of the glacier and a fracturing of the ice shelf. This sequence of events is coherent with ocean warming in this region and suggests that Petermann Glacier has initiated a phase of destabilization, which is of prime importance for the stability and future contribution of the Greenland Ice Sheet to sea level rise.\n\nSimulating the Holocene deglaciation across a marine-terminating portion of southwestern Greenland in response to marine and atmospheric forcings\n\nJoshua K. Cuzzone, NicolÃ¡s E. Young, Mathieu Morlighem, Jason P. Briner, and Nicole-Jeanne Schlegel\n\nThe Cryosphere, 16, 2355–2372, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-16-2355-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-16-2355-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe use an ice sheet model to determine what influenced the Greenland Ice Sheet to retreat across a portion of southwestern Greenland during the Holocene (about the last 12 000 years). Our simulations, constrained by observations from geologic markers, show that atmospheric warming and ice melt primarily caused the ice sheet to retreat rapidly across this domain. We find, however, that iceberg calving at the interface where the ice meets the ocean significantly influenced ice mass change.\n\nA scalability study of the Ice-sheet and Sea-level System Model (ISSM, version 4.18)\n\nYannic Fischler, Martin RÃ¼ckamp, Christian Bischof, Vadym Aizinger, Mathieu Morlighem, and Angelika Humbert\n\nGeosci. Model Dev., 15, 3753–3771, https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-15-3753-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-15-3753-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nIce sheet models are used to simulate the changes of ice sheets in future but are currently often run in coarse resolution and/or with neglecting important physics to make them affordable in terms of computational costs. We conducted a study simulating the Greenland Ice Sheet in high resolution and adequate physics to test where the ISSM ice sheet code is using most time and what could be done to improve its performance for future computer architectures that allow massive parallel computing.\n\nGeometric controls of tidewater glacier dynamics\n\nThomas Frank, Henning Ã kesson, Basile de Fleurian, Mathieu Morlighem, and Kerim H. Nisancioglu\n\nThe Cryosphere, 16, 581–601, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-16-581-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-16-581-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe shape of a fjord can promote or inhibit glacier retreat in response to climate change. We conduct experiments with a synthetic setup under idealized conditions in a numerical model to study and quantify the processes involved. We find that friction between ice and fjord is the most important factor and that it is possible to directly link ice discharge and grounding line retreat to fjord topography in a quantitative way.\n\nLayered seawater intrusion and melt under grounded ice\n\nAlexander A. Robel, Earle Wilson, and Helene Seroussi\n\nThe Cryosphere, 16, 451–469, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-16-451-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-16-451-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWarm seawater may intrude as a thin layer below glaciers in contact with the ocean. Mathematical theory predicts that this intrusion may extend over distances of kilometers under realistic conditions. Computer models demonstrate that if this warm seawater causes melting of a glacier bottom, it can cause rates of glacier ice loss and sea level rise to be up to 2 times faster in response to potential future ocean warming.\n\nA new vertically integrated MOno-Layer Higher-OrderÂ (MOLHO) ice flow model\n\nThiago Dias dos Santos, Mathieu Morlighem, and Douglas Brinkerhoff\n\nThe Cryosphere, 16, 179–195, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-16-179-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-16-179-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nProjecting the future evolution of Greenland and Antarctica and their potential contribution to sea level rise often relies on computer simulations carried out by numerical ice sheet models. Here we present a new vertically integrated ice sheet model and assess its performance using different benchmarks. The new model shows results comparable to a three-dimensional model at relatively lower computational cost, suggesting that it is an excellent alternative for long-term simulations.\n\nThe Holocene dynamics of Ryder Glacier and ice tongue in north Greenland\n\nMatt O'Regan, Thomas M. Cronin, Brendan Reilly, Aage Kristian Olsen Alstrup, Laura Gemery, Anna Golub, Larry A. Mayer, Mathieu Morlighem, Matthias Moros, Ole L. Munk, Johan Nilsson, Christof Pearce, Henrieka Detlef, Christian Stranne, Flor Vermassen, Gabriel West, and Martin Jakobsson\n\nThe Cryosphere, 15, 4073–4097, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-15-4073-2021,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-15-4073-2021, 2021\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nRyder Glacier is a marine-terminating glacier in north Greenland discharging ice into the Lincoln Sea. Here we use marine sediment cores to reconstruct its retreat and advance behavior through the Holocene. We show that while Sherard Osborn Fjord has a physiography conducive to glacier and ice tongue stability, Ryder still retreated more than 40 km inland from its current position by the Middle Holocene. This highlights the sensitivity of north Greenland's marine glaciers to climate change.\n\nAssessment of numerical schemes for transient, finite-element ice flow models using ISSM v4.18\n\nThiago Dias dos Santos, Mathieu Morlighem, and HÃ©lÃ¨ne Seroussi\n\nGeosci. Model Dev., 14, 2545–2573, https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-14-2545-2021,https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-14-2545-2021, 2021\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nNumerical models are routinely used to understand the past and future behavior of ice sheets in response to climate evolution. As is always the case with numerical modeling, one needs to minimize biases and numerical artifacts due to the choice of numerical scheme employed in such models. Here, we assess different numerical schemes in time-dependent simulations of ice sheets. We also introduce a new parameterization for the driving stress, the force that drives the ice sheet flow.\n\nThe transferability of adjoint inversion products between different ice flow models\n\nJowan M. Barnes, Thiago Dias dos Santos, Daniel Goldberg, G. Hilmar Gudmundsson, Mathieu Morlighem, and Jan De Rydt\n\nThe Cryosphere, 15, 1975–2000, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-15-1975-2021,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-15-1975-2021, 2021\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nSome properties of ice flow models must be initialised using observed data before they can be used to produce reliable predictions of the future. Different models have different ways of doing this, and the process is generally seen as being specific to an individual model. We compare the methods used by three different models and show that they produce similar outputs. We also demonstrate that the outputs from one model can be used in other models without introducing large uncertainties.\n\nCalving Front Machine (CALFIN): glacial termini dataset and automated deep learning extraction method for Greenland, 1972â2019\n\nDaniel Cheng, Wayne Hayes, Eric Larour, Yara Mohajerani, Michael Wood, Isabella Velicogna, and Eric Rignot\n\nThe Cryosphere, 15, 1663–1675, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-15-1663-2021,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-15-1663-2021, 2021\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nTracking changes in Greenland's glaciers is important for understanding Earth's climate, but it is time consuming to do so by hand. We train a program, called CALFIN, to automatically track these changes with human levels of accuracy. CALFIN is a special type of program called a neural network. This method can be applied to other glaciers and eventually other tracking tasks. This will enhance our understanding of the Greenland Ice Sheet and permit better models of Earth's climate.\n\nISMIP6-based projections of ocean-forced Antarctic Ice Sheet evolution using the Community Ice Sheet Model\n\nWilliam H. Lipscomb, Gunter R. Leguy, Nicolas C. Jourdain, Xylar Asay-Davis, HÃ©lÃ¨ne Seroussi, and Sophie Nowicki\n\nThe Cryosphere, 15, 633–661, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-15-633-2021,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-15-633-2021, 2021\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThis paper describes Antarctic climate change experiments in which the Community Ice Sheet Model is forced with ocean warming predicted by global climate models. Generally, ice loss begins slowly, accelerates by 2100, and then continues unabated, with widespread retreat of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet. The mass loss by 2500 varies from about 150 to 1300 mm of equivalent sea level rise, based on the predicted ocean warming and assumptions about how this warming drives melting beneath ice shelves.\n\nBed topography of Princess Elizabeth Land in East Antarctica\n\nXiangbin Cui, Hafeez Jeofry, Jamin S.

The DEM covers an area of approximately 900 000 km2 and was built from radio-echo sounding data collected in four campaigns since 2015. Previously, to generate the Bedmap2 topographic product, PELâs bed was characterised from low-resolution satellite gravity data across an otherwise large (>200 km wide) data-free zone.\n\nISSM-SLPS: geodetically compliant Sea-Level Projection System for the Ice-sheet and Sea-level System Model v4.17\n\nEric Larour, Lambert Caron, Mathieu Morlighem, Surendra Adhikari, Thomas Frederikse, Nicole-Jeanne Schlegel, Erik Ivins, Benjamin Hamlington, Robert Kopp, and Sophie Nowicki\n\nGeosci. Model Dev., 13, 4925–4941, https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-13-4925-2020,https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-13-4925-2020, 2020\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nISSM-SLPS is a new projection system for future sea level that increases the resolution and accuracy of current projection systems and improves the way uncertainty is treated in such projections. This will pave the way for better inclusion of state-of-the-art results from existing intercomparison efforts carried out by the scientific community, such as GlacierMIP2 or ISMIP6, into sea-level projections.\n\nExtended enthalpy formulations in the Ice-sheet and Sea-level System Model (ISSM) version 4.17: discontinuous conductivity and anisotropic streamline upwind PetrovâGalerkin (SUPG) method\n\nMartin RÃ¼ckamp, Angelika Humbert, Thomas Kleiner, Mathieu Morlighem, and Helene Seroussi\n\nGeosci. Model Dev., 13, 4491–4501, https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-13-4491-2020,https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-13-4491-2020, 2020\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe present enthalpy formulations within the Ice-Sheet and Sea-Level System model that show better performance than earlier implementations. A first experiment indicates that the treatment of discontinuous conductivities of the solid–fluid system with a geometric mean produce accurate results when applied to coarse vertical resolutions. In a second experiment, we propose a novel stabilization formulation that avoids the problem of thin elements. This method provides accurate and stable results.\n\nA protocol for calculating basal melt rates in the ISMIP6 Antarctic ice sheet projections\n\nNicolas C. Jourdain, Xylar Asay-Davis, Tore Hattermann, Fiammetta Straneo, HÃ©lÃ¨ne Seroussi, Christopher M. Little, and Sophie Nowicki\n\nThe Cryosphere, 14, 3111–3134, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-14-3111-2020,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-14-3111-2020, 2020\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nTo predict the future Antarctic contribution to sea level rise, we need to use ice sheet models. The Ice Sheet Model Intercomparison Project for AR6 (ISMIP6) builds an ensemble of ice sheet projections constrained by atmosphere and ocean projections from the 6th Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP6). In this work, we present and assess a method to derive ice shelf basal melting in ISMIP6 from the CMIP6 ocean outputs, and we give examples of projected melt rates.\n\nThe future sea-level contribution of the Greenland ice sheet: a multi-model ensemble study of ISMIP6\n\nHeiko Goelzer, Sophie Nowicki, Anthony Payne, Eric Larour, Helene Seroussi, William H.

The results for two different greenhouse gas concentration scenarios indicate that the Greenland ice sheet will continue to lose mass until 2100, with contributions to sea-level rise of 90 Â± 50 mm and 32 Â± 17 mm for the high (RCP8.5) and low (RCP2.6) scenario, respectively.\n\nISMIP6 Antarctica: a multi-model ensemble of the Antarctic ice sheet evolution over the 21st century\n\nHÃ©lÃ¨ne Seroussi, Sophie Nowicki, Antony J.

This study presents an ensemble of model simulations of the Antarctic evolution over the 2015–2100 period based on various ice sheet models, climate forcings and emission scenarios. Results suggest that the West Antarctic ice sheet will continue losing a large amount of ice, while the East Antarctic ice sheet could experience increased snow accumulation.\n\nThe role of history and strength of the oceanic forcing in sea level projections from Antarctica with the Parallel Ice Sheet Model\n\nRonja Reese, Anders Levermann, Torsten Albrecht, HÃ©lÃ¨ne Seroussi, and Ricarda Winkelmann\n\nThe Cryosphere, 14, 3097–3110, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-14-3097-2020,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-14-3097-2020, 2020\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe compare 21st century projections of Antarctica's future sea-level contribution simulated with the Parallel Ice Sheet Model submitted to ISMIP6 with projections following the LARMIP-2 protocol based on the same model configuration. We find that (1) a preceding historic simulation increases mass loss by 5–50 % and that (2) the order of magnitude difference in the ice loss in our experiments following the two protocols can be explained by the translation of ocean forcing to sub-shelf melting.\n\nA kinematic formalism for tracking iceâocean mass exchange on the Earth's surface and estimating sea-level change\n\nSurendra Adhikari, Erik R. Ivins, Eric Larour, Lambert Caron, and Helene Seroussi\n\nThe Cryosphere, 14, 2819–2833, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-14-2819-2020,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-14-2819-2020, 2020\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe mathematical formalism presented in this paper aims at simplifying computational strategies for tracking ice–ocean mass exchange in the Earth system. To this end, we define a set of generic, and quite simple, descriptions of evolving land, ocean and ice interfaces and present a unified method to compute the sea-level contribution of evolving ice sheets. The formalism can be applied to arbitrary geometries and at all timescales.\n\nExperimental protocol for sea level projections from ISMIP6 stand-alone ice sheet models\n\nSophie Nowicki, Heiko Goelzer, HÃ©lÃ¨ne Seroussi, Anthony J.

MISMIP+ is one in a series of exercises that test numerical models of ice sheet flow in simple situations. This particular exercise concentrates on the response of ice sheet models to the thinning of their floating ice shelves, which is of interest because numerical models are currently used to model the response to contemporary and near-future thinning in Antarctic ice shelves.\n\nTwenty-first century ocean forcing of the Greenland ice sheet for modelling of sea level contribution\n\nDonald A. Slater, Denis Felikson, Fiamma Straneo, Heiko Goelzer, Christopher M. Little, Mathieu Morlighem, Xavier Fettweis, and Sophie Nowicki\n\nThe Cryosphere, 14, 985–1008, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-14-985-2020,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-14-985-2020, 2020\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nChanges in the ocean around Greenland play an important role in determining how much the ice sheet will contribute to global sea level over the coming century. However, capturing these links in models is very challenging. This paper presents a strategy enabling an ensemble of ice sheet models to feel the effect of the ocean for the first time and should therefore result in a significant improvement in projections of the Greenland ice sheet's contribution to future sea level change.\n\nCMIP5 model selection for ISMIP6 ice sheet model forcing: Greenland and Antarctica\n\nAlice Barthel, CÃ©cile Agosta, Christopher M. Little, Tore Hattermann, Nicolas C. Jourdain, Heiko Goelzer, Sophie Nowicki, Helene Seroussi, Fiammetta Straneo, and Thomas J. Bracegirdle\n\nThe Cryosphere, 14, 855–879, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-14-855-2020,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-14-855-2020, 2020\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe compare existing coupled climate models to select a total of six models to provide forcing to the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheet simulations of the Ice Sheet Model Intercomparison Project (ISMIP6). We select models based on (i) their representation of current climate near Antarctica and Greenland relative to observations and (ii) their ability to sample a diversity of projected atmosphere and ocean changes over the 21st century.\n\nExceptionally high heat flux needed to sustain the Northeast Greenland Ice Stream\n\nSilje Smith-Johnsen, Basile de Fleurian, Nicole Schlegel, Helene Seroussi, and Kerim Nisancioglu\n\nThe Cryosphere, 14, 841–854, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-14-841-2020,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-14-841-2020, 2020\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe Northeast Greenland Ice Stream (NEGIS) drains a large part of Greenland and displays fast flow far inland. However, the flow pattern is not well represented in ice sheet models. The fast flow has been explained by abnormally high geothermal heat flux. The heat melts the base of the ice sheet and the water produced may lubricate the bed and induce fast flow. By including high geothermal heat flux and a hydrology model, we successfully reproduce NEGIS flow pattern in an ice sheet model.\n\nProjecting Antarctica's contribution to future sea level rise from basal ice shelf melt using linear response functions of 16 ice sheet models (LARMIP-2)\n\nAnders Levermann, Ricarda Winkelmann, Torsten Albrecht, Heiko Goelzer, Nicholas R.

The full uncertainty range in the warming-related forcing of basal melt is estimated and applied to 16 state-of-the-art ice sheet models using a linear response theory approach. The sea level contribution we obtain is very likely below 61 cm under unmitigated climate change until 2100 (RCP8.5) and very likely below 40 cm if the Paris Climate Agreement is kept.\n\ninitMIP-Antarctica: an ice sheet model initialization experiment of ISMIP6\n\nHÃ©lÃ¨ne Seroussi, Sophie Nowicki, Erika Simon, Ayako Abe-Ouchi, Torsten Albrecht, Julien Brondex, Stephen Cornford, Christophe Dumas, Fabien Gillet-Chaulet, Heiko Goelzer, Nicholas R.

Results are improved compared to previous assessments and show that continued improvements in the representation of the floating ice around Antarctica are critical to reduce the uncertainty in the future ice sheet contribution to sea level rise.\n\nBrief communication: PICOP, a new ocean melt parameterization under ice shelves combining PICO and a plume model\n\nTyler Pelle, Mathieu Morlighem, and Johannes H. Bondzio\n\nThe Cryosphere, 13, 1043–1049, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-13-1043-2019,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-13-1043-2019, 2019\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nHow ocean-induced melt under floating ice shelves will change as ocean currents evolve remains a big uncertainty in projections of sea level rise. In this study, we combine two of the most recently developed melt models to form PICOP, which overcomes the limitations of past models and produces accurate ice shelf melt rates. We find that our model is easy to set up and computationally efficient, providing researchers an important tool to improve the accuracy of their future glacial projections.\n\nThe impact of model resolution on the simulated Holocene retreat of the southwestern Greenland ice sheet using the Ice Sheet System Model (ISSM)\n\nJoshua K. Cuzzone, Nicole-Jeanne Schlegel, Mathieu Morlighem, Eric Larour, Jason P. Briner, Helene Seroussi, and Lambert Caron\n\nThe Cryosphere, 13, 879–893, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-13-879-2019,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-13-879-2019, 2019\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe present ice sheet modeling results of ice retreat over southwestern Greenland during the last 12 000 years, and we also test the impact that model horizontal resolution has on differences in the simulated spatial retreat and its associated rate. Results indicate that model resolution plays a minor role in simulated retreat in areas where bed topography is not complex but plays an important role in areas where bed topography is complex (such as fjords).\n\nModeling the response of northwest Greenland to enhanced ocean thermal forcing and subglacial discharge\n\nMathieu Morlighem, Michael Wood, HÃ©lÃ¨ne Seroussi, Youngmin Choi, and Eric Rignot\n\nThe Cryosphere, 13, 723–734, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-13-723-2019,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-13-723-2019, 2019\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nMany glaciers along the coast of Greenland have been retreating. It has been suggested that this retreat is triggered by the presence of warm water in the fjords, and surface melt at the top of the ice sheet is exacerbating this problem. Here, we quantify the vulnerability of northwestern Greenland to further warming using a numerical model. We find that in current conditions, this sector alone will contribute more than 1 cm to sea rise level by 2100, and up to 3 cm in the most extreme scenario.\n\nImplementation and performance of adaptive mesh refinement in the Ice Sheet System Model (ISSM v4.14)\n\nThiago Dias dos Santos, Mathieu Morlighem, HÃ©lÃ¨ne Seroussi, Philippe Remy Bernard Devloo, and Jefferson Cardia SimÃµes\n\nGeosci. Model Dev., 12, 215–232, https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-12-215-2019,https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-12-215-2019, 2019\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe reduction of numerical errors in ice sheet modeling increases the results' accuracy reliability. We improve numerical accuracy by better capturing grounding line dynamics, while maintaining a low computational cost. We implement an adaptive mesh refinement (AMR) technique in the Ice Sheet System Model and compare AMR simulations with uniformly refined meshes. Our results show that the computational time with AMR is significantly shorter than for uniformly refined meshes for a given accuracy.\n\nComparison of four calving laws to model Greenland outlet glaciers\n\nYoungmin Choi, Mathieu Morlighem, Michael Wood, and Johannes H. Bondzio\n\nThe Cryosphere, 12, 3735–3746, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-12-3735-2018,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-12-3735-2018, 2018\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nCalving is an important mechanism that controls the dynamics of Greenland outlet glaciers. We test and compare four calving laws and assess which calving law has better predictive abilities. Overall, the calving law based on von Mises stress is more satisfactory than other laws, but new parameterizations should be derived to better capture the detailed processes involved in calving.\n\nExploration of Antarctic Ice Sheet 100-year contribution to sea level rise and associated model uncertainties using the ISSM framework\n\nNicole-Jeanne Schlegel, Helene Seroussi, Michael P. Schodlok, Eric Y. Larour, Carmen Boening, Daniel Limonadi, Michael M. Watkins, Mathieu Morlighem, and Michiel R. van den Broeke\n\nThe Cryosphere, 12, 3511–3534, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-12-3511-2018,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-12-3511-2018, 2018\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nUsing NASA supercomputers and a novel framework, in which Sandia National Laboratories' statistical software is embedded in the Jet Propulsion Laboratory's ice sheet model, we run a range of 100-year warming scenarios for Antarctica. We find that 1.2 m of sea level contribution is achievable, but not likely. Also, we find that bedrock topography beneath the ice drives potential for regional sea level contribution, highlighting the need for accurate bedrock mapping of the ice sheet interior.\n\nA statistical fracture model for Antarctic ice shelves and glaciers\n\nVeronika Emetc, Paul Tregoning, Mathieu Morlighem, Chris Borstad, and Malcolm Sambridge\n\nThe Cryosphere, 12, 3187–3213, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-12-3187-2018,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-12-3187-2018, 2018\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe paper includes a model that can be used to predict zones of fracture formation in both floating and grounded ice in Antarctica. We used observations and a statistics-based model to predict fractures in most ice shelves in Antarctica as an alternative to the damage-based approach. We can predict the location of observed fractures with an average success rate of 84% for grounded ice and 61% for floating ice and mean overestimation error of 26% and 20%, respectively.\n\nRepresentation of basal melting at the grounding line in ice flow models\n\nHÃ©lÃ¨ne Seroussi and Mathieu Morlighem\n\nThe Cryosphere, 12, 3085–3096, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-12-3085-2018,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-12-3085-2018, 2018\n\nBasal friction of Fleming Glacier, Antarctica â Part 1: Sensitivity of inversion to temperature and bedrock uncertainty\n\nChen Zhao, Rupert M. Gladstone, Roland C. Warner, Matt A. King, Thomas Zwinger, and Mathieu Morlighem\n\nThe Cryosphere, 12, 2637–2652, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-12-2637-2018,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-12-2637-2018, 2018\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nA combination of computer modelling and observational data were used to infer the resistance to ice flow at the bed of the Fleming Glacier on the Antarctic Peninsula. The model was also used to simulate the distribution of temperature within the ice, which governs the rate at which the ice can deform. This is especially important for glaciers like the Fleming Glacier, which has both regions of rapid deformation and regions of rapid sliding at the bed.\n\nBasal friction of Fleming Glacier, Antarctica â PartÂ 2: Evolution fromÂ 2008 toÂ 2015\n\nChen Zhao, Rupert M. Gladstone, Roland C. Warner, Matt A. King, Thomas Zwinger, and Mathieu Morlighem\n\nThe Cryosphere, 12, 2653–2666, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-12-2653-2018,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-12-2653-2018, 2018\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nA combination of computer modelling and observational data were used to infer the resistance to ice flow at the bed of the Fleming Glacier on the Antarctic Peninsula in both 2008 and 2015. The comparison suggests the grounding line retreated by ~ 9 km from 2008 to 2015. The retreat may be enhanced by a positive feedback between friction, melting and sliding at the glacier bed.\n\nSHAKTI: Subglacial Hydrology and Kinetic, Transient Interactions v1.0\n\nAleah Sommers, Harihar Rajaram, and Mathieu Morlighem\n\nGeosci. Model Dev., 11, 2955–2974, https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-11-2955-2018,https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-11-2955-2018, 2018\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nMeltwater drainage beneath glaciers and ice sheets influences how fast they move and is complicated and constantly changing. Most models distinguish between fast and slow drainage with different equations for each system. The SHAKTI model allows for the ice–water drainage arrangement to transition naturally between different types of flow. This model can be used to understand how drainage affects glacier speeds and the associated ice loss to further inform predictions of sea level rise.\n\nImplementation of higher-order vertical finite elements in ISSM v4.13 for improved ice sheet flow modeling over paleoclimate timescales\n\nJoshua K. Cuzzone, Mathieu Morlighem, Eric Larour, Nicole Schlegel, and Helene Seroussi\n\nGeosci. Model Dev., 11, 1683–1694, https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-11-1683-2018,https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-11-1683-2018, 2018\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThis paper details the implementation of higher-order vertical finite elements in the Ice Sheet System Model (ISSM). When using higher-order vertical finite elements, fewer vertical layers are needed to accurately capture the thermal structure in an ice sheet versus a conventional linear vertical interpolation, therefore greatly improving model runtime speeds, particularly in higher-order stress balance ice sheet models. The implications for paleoclimate ice sheet simulations are discussed.\n\nSimulating ice thickness and velocity evolution of Upernavik IsstrÃ¸m 1849â2012 by forcing prescribed terminus positions in ISSM\n\nKonstanze Haubner, Jason E.

Our simulation is forced with observed terminus positions in discrete time steps and is responsive to the prescribed ice front changes. Simulated frontal retreat is needed to obtain a realistic ice surface elevation and velocity evolution of Upernavik. Using the prescribed terminus position change we gain insight to mass loss partitioning during different time periods.\n\nDesign and results of the ice sheet model initialisation experiments initMIP-Greenland: an ISMIP6 intercomparison\n\nHeiko Goelzer, Sophie Nowicki, Tamsin Edwards, Matthew Beckley, Ayako Abe-Ouchi, Andy Aschwanden, Reinhard Calov, Olivier Gagliardini, Fabien Gillet-Chaulet, Nicholas R.

Compared to earlier community-wide comparisons, we find better agreement across different models, which implies overall improvement of our understanding of what is needed to produce such initial states.\n\nA new bed elevation model for the Weddell Sea sector of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet\n\nHafeez Jeofry, Neil Ross, Hugh F. J. Corr, Jilu Li, Mathieu Morlighem, Prasad Gogineni, and Martin J. Siegert\n\nEarth Syst. Sci. Data, 10, 711–725, https://doi.org/10.5194/essd-10-711-2018,https://doi.org/10.5194/essd-10-711-2018, 2018\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nAccurately characterizing the complexities of the ice-sheet dynamic specifically close to the grounding line across the Weddell Sea (WS) sector in the ice-sheet models provides challenges to the scientific community. Our main objective is to comprehend these complexities, adding accuracy to the projection of future ice-sheet dynamics. Therefore, we have developed a new bed elevation digital elevation model across the WS sector, which will be of value to ice-sheet modelling experiments.\n\nImplementing an empirical scalar constitutive relation for ice with flow-induced polycrystalline anisotropy in large-scale ice sheet models\n\nFelicity S. Graham, Mathieu Morlighem, Roland C. Warner, and Adam Treverrow\n\nThe Cryosphere, 12, 1047–1067, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-12-1047-2018,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-12-1047-2018, 2018\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nIce sheet flow is anisotropic, depending on the nature of the stress applied. However, most large-scale ice sheet models rely on the Glen flow relation, which ignores anisotropic effects. We implement a flow relation (ESTAR) for anisotropic ice in a large-scale ice sheet model. In ice shelf simulations, the Glen flow relation overestimates velocities by up to 17 % compared with ESTAR. Our results have implications for ice sheet model simulations of paleo-ice extent and sea level rise prediction.\n\nA JavaScript API for the Ice Sheet System Model (ISSM) 4.11: towards an online interactive model for the cryosphere community\n\nEric Larour, Daniel Cheng, Gilberto Perez, Justin Quinn, Mathieu Morlighem, Bao Duong, Lan Nguyen, Kit Petrie, Silva Harounian, Daria Halkides, and Wayne Hayes\n\nGeosci.

This allows for a new generation of websites that can rely on the entire code of a climate model, without compromising or simplifying the physics implemented in such a model. We believe this approach will enable better education/outreach websites as well as improve access to complex climate models without compromising their integrity.\n\nIceberg calving of Thwaites Glacier, West Antarctica: full-Stokes modeling combined with linear elastic fracture mechanics\n\nHongju Yu, Eric Rignot, Mathieu Morlighem, and Helene Seroussi\n\nThe Cryosphere, 11, 1283–1296, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-11-1283-2017,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-11-1283-2017, 2017\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe combine 2-D ice flow model with linear elastic fracture mechanics (LEFM) to model the calving behavior of Thwaites Glacier, West Antarctica. We find the combination of full-Stokes (FS) model and LEFM produces crevasses that are consistent with observations. We also find that calving is enhanced with pre-existing surface crevasses, shorter ice shelves or undercut at the ice shelf front. We conclude that the FS/LEFM combination is capable of constraining crevasse formation and iceberg calving.\n\nHow accurate are estimates of glacier ice thickness?

Considering 17 different models and 21 different test cases, we show that although solutions of individual models can differ considerably, an ensemble average can yield uncertainties in the order of 10 &pm; 24 % the mean ice thickness. Ways forward for improving such estimates are sketched.\n\nSimulating the evolution of HardangerjÃ¸kulen ice cap in southern Norway since the mid-Holocene and its sensitivity to climate change\n\nHenning Ã kesson, Kerim H.

Giesen, and Mathieu Morlighem\n\nThe Cryosphere, 11, 281–302, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-11-281-2017,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-11-281-2017, 2017\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe present simulations of the history of HardangerjÃ¸kulen ice cap in southern Norway using a dynamical ice sheet model. From mid-Holocene ice-free conditions 4000 years ago, HardangerjÃ¸kulen grows nonlinearly in response to a linear climate forcing, reaching maximum extent during the Little Ice Age (~ 1750 AD). The ice cap exhibits spatially asymmetric growth and retreat and is highly sensitive to climate change. Our results call for reassessment of glacier reconstructions from proxy records.\n\nOptimal numerical solvers for transient simulations of ice flow using the Ice Sheet System Model (ISSM versions 4.2.5 and 4.11)\n\nFeras Habbal, Eric Larour, Mathieu Morlighem, Helene Seroussi, Christopher P. Borstad, and Eric Rignot\n\nGeosci. Model Dev., 10, 155–168, https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-10-155-2017,https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-10-155-2017, 2017\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThis work presents the results from testing a suite of numerical solvers on a standard ice sheet benchmark test. We note the relevance of this test to practical simulations and identify the fastest solvers for the transient simulation. The highlighted solvers show significant speed-ups in relation to the default solver (~1.5–100 times faster) and enable a new capability for solving massive, high-resolution models that are critical for improving projections of ice sheets and sea-level change.\n\nIce Sheet Model Intercomparison Project (ISMIP6) contribution to CMIP6\n\nSophie M.

The approach enables data assimilation of observations to improve projections of polar ice sheet mass balance and contribution to sea-level rise. It is applicable to other Earth science frameworks relying on C++ and parallel computing, is non-intrusive, and enables computation of transient adjoints for any type of physics, hence providing insights into the sensitivities of any model to its inputs.\n\nA global, high-resolution data set of ice sheet topography, cavity geometry, and ocean bathymetry\n\nJanin Schaffer, Ralph Timmermann, Jan Erik Arndt, Steen Savstrup Kristensen, Christoph Mayer, Mathieu Morlighem, and Daniel Steinhage\n\nEarth Syst.

We corrected data from earlier products in the areas of Petermann, Hagen BrÃ¦, and Helheim glaciers, incorporated original data for the floating ice tongue of Nioghalvfjerdsfjorden Glacier, and applied corrections for the geometry of Getz, Abbot, and Fimbul ice shelf cavities. The data set is available from the PANGAEA database.\n\nExperimental design for three interrelated marine ice sheet and ocean model intercomparison projects: MISMIP v. 3 (MISMIP +), ISOMIP v. 2 (ISOMIP +) and MISOMIP v. 1 (MISOMIP1)\n\nXylar S.

Such models have a broad range of potential applications in studying the dynamics of ice sheets and glaciers, including assessing their contributions to sea level change. Here we describe the idealized experiments that make up three interrelated Model Intercomparison Projects (MIPs) for marine ice sheet models and regional ocean circulation models incorporating ice shelf cavities.\n\nFull-Stokes modeling of grounding line dynamics, ice melt and iceberg calving for Thwaites Glacier, West Antarctica\n\nHongju Yu, Eric Rignot, Mathieu Morlighem, and Helene Seroussi\n\nThe Cryosphere Discuss., https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-2016-101,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-2016-101, 2016\n\nRevised manuscript not accepted\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe performed a 2D Full-Stokes (FS) modeling study of grounding line dynamics and calving of Thwaites Glacier, West Antarctica. We compare FS with simplified models on grounding line migration and we combine FS with Linear Elastic Fracture Mechanics to simulate crevasse propagation. We find that only FS is able to provide reliable grounding line migration and to explain observed crevasse. We conclude that it may be essential to employ FS in the grounding line region for 2D simulations.\n\nneXtSIM: a new Lagrangian sea ice model\n\nPierre Rampal, Sylvain Bouillon, Einar Ãlason, and Mathieu Morlighem\n\nThe Cryosphere, 10, 1055–1073, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-10-1055-2016,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-10-1055-2016, 2016\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe Arctic sea ice cover has changed drastically over the last decades and undergone a shift in its dynamical regime, as seen by the increase of extreme fracturing events and the acceleration of sea ice drift. In this paper we present a new sea ice model, neXtSIM, that is capable of simulating both sea ice drift and deformation as observed from satellites, with similar spatial and temporal scaling properties. At the same time, the model reproduces sea ice area, extent, and volume correctly.\n\nModelling calving front dynamics using a level-set method: application to Jakobshavn IsbrÃ¦, West Greenland\n\nJohannes H. Bondzio, HÃ©lÃ¨ne Seroussi, Mathieu Morlighem, Thomas Kleiner, Martin RÃ¼ckamp, Angelika Humbert, and Eric Y. Larour\n\nThe Cryosphere, 10, 497–510, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-10-497-2016,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-10-497-2016, 2016\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe implemented a level-set method in the ice sheet system model. This method allows us to dynamically evolve a calving front subject to user-defined calving rates. We apply the method to Jakobshavn IsbrÃ¦, West Greenland, and study its response to calving rate perturbations. We find its behaviour strongly dependent on the calving rate, which was to be expected. Both reduced basal drag and rheological shear margin weakening sustain the acceleration of this dynamic outlet glacier.\n\nLinking glacially modified waters to catchment-scale subglacial discharge using autonomous underwater vehicle observations\n\nLaura A. Stevens, Fiamma Straneo, Sarah B. Das, Albert J. Plueddemann, Amy L. Kukulya, and Mathieu Morlighem\n\nThe Cryosphere, 10, 417–432, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-10-417-2016,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-10-417-2016, 2016\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nHere we pair detailed hydrographic measurements collected with an autonomous underwater vehicle as close as 150 m from the ice–ocean interface of the Saqqarliup sermia–Sarqardleq Fjord system, West Greenland, with modeled and observed subglacial discharge locations and magnitudes. We find evidence of two main types of subsurface glacially modified water localized in space that are consistent with runoff discharged at two locations along the grounding line.\n\nA new sub-grid surface mass balance and flux model for continental-scale ice sheet modelling: testing and last glacial cycle\n\nK. Le Morzadec, L. Tarasov, M. Morlighem, and H. Seroussi\n\nGeosci. Model Dev., 8, 3199–3213, https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-8-3199-2015,https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-8-3199-2015, 2015\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nA long-term challenge for any model of complex large-scale processes is accounting for the impact of unresolved sub-grid (SG) processes. We quantify the impact of SG mass-balance and ice fluxes on glacial cycle ensemble results for North America. We find no easy solutions to accurately capture these impacts. We show that SG process representation and associated parametric uncertainties can have significant impact on coarse resolution model results for glacial cycle ice sheet evolution.\n\nQuantifying mass balance processes on the Southern Patagonia Icefield\n\nM. Schaefer, H. Machguth, M. Falvey, G. Casassa, and E. Rignot\n\nThe Cryosphere, 9, 25–35, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-9-25-2015,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-9-25-2015, 2015\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe use a meteorological-glaciological multi-model approach to quantify, for the first time, melt and accumulation of snow on the Southern Patagonia Icefield (SPI). We were able to reproduce the high measured accumulation of snow of up to 15.4 m water equivalent per year as well as the high measured ablation of up to 11 m water equivalent per year. Mass losses of the SPI due to calving of icebergs strongly increased from 1975-2000 to 2000-2011 and were higher than losses due to surface melt.\n\nInferred basal friction and surface mass balance of the Northeast Greenland Ice Stream using data assimilation of ICESat (Ice Cloud and land Elevation Satellite) surface altimetry and ISSM (Ice Sheet System Model)\n\nE.

The inversion relies on automatic differentiation of ISSM and demonstrates the feasibility of assimilating altimetry records into reconstructions of the Greenland Ice Sheet. The boundary conditions provide a snapshot of the state of the ice for this period and can be used for further process studies.\n\nHydrostatic grounding line parameterization in ice sheet models\n\nH.

Robel, Vincent Verjans, and Aminat A. Ambelorun\n\nThe Cryosphere, 18, 2613–2623, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-18-2613-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-18-2613-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe average size of many glaciers and ice sheets changes when noise is added to the system. The reasons for this drift in glacier state is intrinsic to the dynamics of how ice flows and the bumpiness of the Earth's surface. We argue that not including noise in projections of ice sheet evolution over coming decades and centuries is a pervasive source of bias in these computer models, and so realistic variability in glacier and climate processes must be included in models.\n\nModeling the timing of Patagonian Ice Sheet retreat in the Chilean Lake District from 22â10 ka\n\nJoshua Cuzzone, Matias Romero, and Shaun A.

These results improve our understanding of the response of the PIS to deglacial warming and the patterns of deglacial ice margin retreat where gaps in the geologic record still exist, and they indicate that changes in large-scale precipitation during the last deglaciation played an important role in modulating the response of ice margin change across the PIS to deglacial warming.\n\nIce viscosity governs hydraulic fracture causing rapid drainage of supraglacial lakes\n\nTim Hageman, Jessica MejÃ­a, Ravindra Duddu, and Emilio MartÃ­nez-PaÃ±eda\n\nEGUsphere, https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-346,https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-346, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nDue to surface melting, meltwater lakes seasonally form on the surface of glaciers. These lakes drive hydrofractures that rapidly transfer water to the base of ice sheets. This paper presents a computational method to capture the complicated hydrofracturing process. Our work reveals that viscous ice rheology has a great influence on the short-term propagation of fractures, enabling fast lake drainage; whereas, thermal effects (frictional heating, conduction, and freezing) have little influence.\n\nUsing specularity content to evaluate eight geothermal heat flow maps of Totten Glacier\n\nYan Huang, Liyun Zhao, Michael Wolovick, Yiliang Ma, and John C. Moore\n\nThe Cryosphere, 18, 103–119, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-18-103-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-18-103-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nGeothermal heat flux (GHF) is an important factor affecting the basal thermal environment of an ice sheet and crucial for its dynamics. But it is poorly defined for the Antarctic ice sheet. We simulate the basal temperature and basal melting rate with eight different GHF datasets. We use specularity content as a two-sided constraint to discriminate between local wet or dry basal conditions. Two medium-magnitude GHF distribution maps rank well, showing that most of the inland bed area is frozen.\n\nSurging of a Hudson Strait-scale ice stream: subglacial hydrology matters but the process details mostly do not\n\nMatthew Drew and Lev Tarasov\n\nThe Cryosphere, 17, 5391–5415, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-17-5391-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-17-5391-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe interaction of fast-flowing regions of continental ice sheets with their beds governs how quickly they slide and therefore flow. The coupling of fast ice to its bed is controlled by the pressure of meltwater at its base. It is currently poorly understood how the physical details of these hydrologic systems affect ice speedup. Using numerical models we find, surprisingly, that they largely do not, except for the duration of the surge. This suggests that cheap models are sufficient.\n\nRegularization and L-curves in ice sheet inverse models: a case study in the FilchnerâRonne catchment\n\nMichael Wolovick, Angelika Humbert, Thomas Kleiner, and Martin RÃ¼ckamp\n\nThe Cryosphere, 17, 5027–5060, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-17-5027-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-17-5027-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe friction underneath ice sheets can be inferred from observed velocity at the top, but this inference requires smoothing. The selection of smoothing has been highly variable in the literature. Here we show how to rigorously select the best smoothing, and we show that the inferred friction converges towards the best knowable field as model resolution improves. We use this to learn about the best description of basal friction and to formulate recommended best practices for other modelers.\n\nQuantifying the uncertainty in the Eurasian ice-sheet geometry at the Penultimate Glacial Maximum (Marine Isotope Stage 6)\n\nOliver G. Pollard, Natasha L. M. Barlow, Lauren J. Gregoire, Natalya Gomez, VÃ­ctor Cartelle, Jeremy C. Ely, and Lachlan C. Astfalck\n\nThe Cryosphere, 17, 4751–4777, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-17-4751-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-17-4751-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe use advanced statistical techniques and a simple ice-sheet model to produce an ensemble of plausible 3D shapes of the ice sheet that once stretched across northern Europe during the previous glacial maximum (140,000 years ago). This new reconstruction, equivalent in volume to 48 ± 8 m of global mean sea-level rise, will improve the interpretation of high sea levels recorded from the Last Interglacial period (120 000 years ago) that provide a useful perspective on the future.\n\nThe stability of present-day Antarctic grounding lines â Part 2: Onset of irreversible retreat of Amundsen Sea glaciers under current climate on centennial timescales cannot be excluded\n\nRonja Reese, Julius Garbe, Emily A.

We find that present-day ocean and atmosphere conditions might commit an irreversible collapse of parts of West Antarctica which evolves over centuries to millennia. Importantly, this collapse is not irreversible yet.\n\nThe stability of present-day Antarctic grounding lines â Part 1: No indication of marine ice sheet instability in the current geometry\n\nEmily A.

We use three ice sheet models to show that the present-day locations of Antarctic grounding lines are reversible with respect to a small perturbation away from their current position. This indicates that present-day retreat of the grounding lines is not yet irreversible or self-enhancing.\n\nGeothermal heat flux is the dominant source of uncertainty in englacial-temperature-based dating of ice rise formation\n\nAleksandr Montelli and Jonathan Kingslake\n\nThe Cryosphere, 17, 195–210, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-17-195-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-17-195-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThermal modelling and Bayesian inversion techniques are used to evaluate the uncertainties inherent in inferences of ice-sheet evolution from borehole temperature measurements. We show that the same temperature profiles may result from a range of parameters, of which geothermal heat flux through underlying bedrock plays a key role. Careful model parameterisation and evaluation of heat flux are essential for inferring past ice-sheet evolution from englacial borehole thermometry.\n\nImproving interpretation of sea-level projections through a machine-learning-based local explanation approach\n\nJeremy Rohmer, Remi Thieblemont, Goneri Le Cozannet, Heiko Goelzer, and Gael Durand\n\nThe Cryosphere, 16, 4637–4657, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-16-4637-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-16-4637-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nTo improve the interpretability of process-based projections of the sea-level contribution from land ice components, we apply the machine-learning-based SHapley Additive exPlanations approach to a subset of a multi-model ensemble study for the Greenland ice sheet. This allows us to quantify the influence of particular modelling decisions (related to numerical implementation, initial conditions, or parametrisation of ice-sheet processes) directly in terms of sea-level change contribution.\n\nSubglacial hydrology modulates basal sliding response of the Antarctic ice sheet to climate forcing\n\nElise Kazmierczak, Sainan Sun, Violaine Coulon, and Frank Pattyn\n\nThe Cryosphere, 16, 4537–4552, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-16-4537-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-16-4537-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe water at the interface between ice sheets and underlying bedrock leads to lubrication between the ice and the bed. Due to a lack of direct observations, subglacial conditions beneath the Antarctic ice sheet are poorly understood. Here, we compare different approaches in which the subglacial water could influence sliding on the underlying bedrock and suggest that it modulates the Antarctic ice sheet response and increases uncertainties, especially in the context of global warming.\n\nThe predictive power of ice sheet models and the regional sensitivity of ice loss to basal sliding parameterisations: a case study of Pine Island and Thwaites glaciers, West Antarctica\n\nJowan M. Barnes and G. Hilmar Gudmundsson\n\nThe Cryosphere, 16, 4291–4304, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-16-4291-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-16-4291-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nModels must represent how glaciers slide along the bed, but there are many ways to do so. In this paper, several sliding laws are tested and found to affect different regions of the Antarctic Ice Sheet in different ways and at different speeds. However, the variability in ice volume loss due to sliding-law choices is low compared to other factors, so limited empirical knowledge of sliding does not prevent us from making predictions of how an ice sheet will evolve.\n\nSimulations of firn processes over the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets: 1980â2021\n\nBrooke Medley, Thomas A. Neumann, H. Jay Zwally, Benjamin E. Smith, and C. Max Stevens\n\nThe Cryosphere, 16, 3971–4011, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-16-3971-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-16-3971-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nSatellite altimeters measure the height or volume change over Earth's ice sheets, but in order to understand how that change translates into ice mass, we must account for various processes at the surface. Specifically, snowfall events generate large, transient increases in surface height, yet snow fall has a relatively low density, which means much of that height change is composed of air. This air signal must be removed from the observed height changes before we can assess ice mass change.\n\nEvaluation of six geothermal heat flux maps for the Antarctic LambertâAmery glacial system\n\nHaoran Kang, Liyun Zhao, Michael Wolovick, and John C.

We estimate basal thermal conditions of the Lambert–Amery Glacier system with six GHF maps. Recent GHFs inverted from aerial geomagnetic observations produce a larger warm-based area and match the observed subglacial lakes better than the other GHFs. The modelled basal melt rate is 10 to hundreds of millimetres per year in fast-flowing glaciers feeding the Amery Ice Shelf and smaller inland.\n\nImpact of runoff temporal distribution on ice dynamics\n\nBasile de Fleurian, Richard Davy, and Petra M.

Here we use an ice dynamics and subglacial hydrology model with simplified geometry and climate forcing to study the impact of variations in meltwater on ice dynamics. We focus on the variations in length and intensity of the melt season. Our results show that a longer melt season leads to faster glaciers, but a more intense melt season reduces glaciers' seasonal velocities, albeit leading to higher peak velocities.\n\nCan changes in deformation regimes be inferred from crystallographic preferred orientations in polar ice?\n\nMaria-Gema Llorens, Albert Griera, Paul D. Bons, Ilka Weikusat, David J. Prior, Enrique Gomez-Rivas, Tamara de Riese, Ivone Jimenez-Munt, Daniel GarcÃ­a-Castellanos, and Ricardo A. Lebensohn\n\nThe Cryosphere, 16, 2009–2024, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-16-2009-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-16-2009-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nPolar ice is formed by ice crystals, which form fabrics that are utilised to interpret how ice sheets flow. It is unclear whether fabrics result from the current flow regime or if they are inherited. To understand the extent to which ice crystals can be reoriented when ice flow conditions change, we simulate and evaluate multi-stage ice flow scenarios according to natural cases. We find that second deformation regimes normally overprint inherited fabrics, with a range of transitional fabrics.\n\nStabilizing effect of mÃ©lange buttressing on the marine ice-cliff instability of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet\n\nTanja Schlemm, Johannes Feldmann, Ricarda Winkelmann, and Anders Levermann\n\nThe Cryosphere, 16, 1979–1996, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-16-1979-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-16-1979-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nMarine cliff instability, if it exists, could dominate Antarctica's contribution to future sea-level rise. It is likely to speed up with ice thickness and thus would accelerate in most parts of Antarctica. Here, we investigate a possible mechanism that might stop cliff instability through cloaking by ice mÃ©lange. It is only a first step, but it shows that embayment geometry is, in principle, able to stop marine cliff instability in most parts of West Antarctica.\n\nOn the periodicity of free oscillations for a finite ice column\n\nDaniel Moreno, Alexander Robinson, Marisa Montoya, and Jorge Alvarez-Solas\n\nThe Cryosphere Discuss., https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-2022-97,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-2022-97, 2022\n\nRevised manuscript accepted for TC\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nOur study tries to understand how the ice temperature evolves in a large mass as in the case of Antarctica. We found a relation that tells us the ice temperature at any point. These results are important because they also determine how the ice moves. In general, ice moves due to slow deformation (as if pouring honey from a jar). Nevertheless, in some regions the ice base warms enough and melts. The liquid water then serves as lubricant and the ice slides and its velocity increases rapidly.\n\nEffective coefficient of diffusion and permeability of firn at Dome C and Lock In, Antarctica, and of various snow types â estimates over the 100â850 kg mâ3 density range\n\nNeige Calonne, Alexis Burr, Armelle Philip, FrÃ©dÃ©ric Flin, and Christian Geindreau\n\nThe Cryosphere, 16, 967–980, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-16-967-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-16-967-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nModeling gas transport in ice sheets from surface to close-off is key to interpreting climate archives. Estimates of the diffusion coefficient and permeability of snow and firn are required but remain a large source of uncertainty. We present a new dataset of diffusion coefficients and permeability from 20 to 120 m depth at two Antarctic sites. We suggest predictive formulas to estimate both properties over the entire 100–850 kg m3 density range, i.e., anywhere within the ice sheet column.\n\nThe instantaneous impact of calving and thinning on the LarsenÂ C Ice Shelf\n\nTom Mitcham, G. Hilmar Gudmundsson, and Jonathan L. Bamber\n\nThe Cryosphere, 16, 883–901, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-16-883-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-16-883-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe modelled the response of the Larsen C Ice Shelf (LCIS) and its tributary glaciers to the calving of the A68 iceberg and validated our results with observations. We found that the impact was limited, confirming that mostly passive ice was calved. Through further calving experiments we quantified the total buttressing provided by the LCIS and found that over 80 % of the buttressing capacity is generated in the first 5 km of the ice shelf downstream of the grounding line.\n\nDerivation of bedrock topography measurement requirements for the reduction of uncertainty in ice-sheet model projections of Thwaites Glacier\n\nBlake A. Castleman, Nicole-Jeanne Schlegel, Lambert Caron, Eric Larour, and Ala Khazendar\n\nThe Cryosphere, 16, 761–778, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-16-761-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-16-761-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nIn the described study, we derive an uncertainty range for global mean sea level rise (SLR) contribution from Thwaites Glacier in a 200-year period under an extreme ocean warming scenario. We derive the spatial and vertical resolutions needed for bedrock data acquisition missions in order to limit global mean SLR contribution from Thwaites Glacier to ±2 cm in a 200-year period. We conduct sensitivity experiments in order to present the locations of critical regions in need of accurate mapping.\n\nA comparison of the stability and performance of depth-integrated ice-dynamics solvers\n\nAlexander Robinson, Daniel Goldberg, and William H. Lipscomb\n\nThe Cryosphere, 16, 689–709, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-16-689-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-16-689-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nHere we investigate the numerical stability of several commonly used methods in order to determine which of them are capable of resolving the complex physics of the ice flow and are also computationally efficient. We find that the so-called DIVA solver outperforms the others. Its representation of the physics is consistent with more complex methods, while it remains computationally efficient at high resolution.\n\nA new vertically integrated MOno-Layer Higher-OrderÂ (MOLHO) ice flow model\n\nThiago Dias dos Santos, Mathieu Morlighem, and Douglas Brinkerhoff\n\nThe Cryosphere, 16, 179–195, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-16-179-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-16-179-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nProjecting the future evolution of Greenland and Antarctica and their potential contribution to sea level rise often relies on computer simulations carried out by numerical ice sheet models. Here we present a new vertically integrated ice sheet model and assess its performance using different benchmarks. The new model shows results comparable to a three-dimensional model at relatively lower computational cost, suggesting that it is an excellent alternative for long-term simulations.\n\nOn the contribution of grain boundary sliding type creep to firn densification â an assessment using an optimization approach\n\nTimm Schultz, Ralf MÃ¼ller, Dietmar Gross, and Angelika Humbert\n\nThe Cryosphere, 16, 143–158, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-16-143-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-16-143-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nFirn is the interstage product between snow and ice. Simulations describing the process of firn densification are used in the context of estimating mass changes of the ice sheets and past climate reconstructions. The first stage of firn densification takes place in the upper few meters of the firn column. We investigate how well a material law describing the process of grain boundary sliding works for the numerical simulation of firn densification in this stage.\n\nMarine ice sheet experiments with the Community Ice Sheet Model\n\nGunter R. Leguy, William H. Lipscomb, and Xylar S. Asay-Davis\n\nThe Cryosphere, 15, 3229–3253, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-15-3229-2021,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-15-3229-2021, 2021\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe present numerical features of the Community Ice Sheet Model in representing ocean termini glaciers. Using idealized test cases, we show that applying melt in a partly grounded cell is beneficial, in contrast to recent studies. We confirm that parameterizing partly grounded cells yields accurate ice sheet representation at a grid resolution of ~2 km (arguably 4 km), allowing ice sheet simulations at a continental scale. The choice of basal friction law also influences the ice flow.\n\nThe transferability of adjoint inversion products between different ice flow models\n\nJowan M. Barnes, Thiago Dias dos Santos, Daniel Goldberg, G. Hilmar Gudmundsson, Mathieu Morlighem, and Jan De Rydt\n\nThe Cryosphere, 15, 1975–2000, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-15-1975-2021,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-15-1975-2021, 2021\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nSome properties of ice flow models must be initialised using observed data before they can be used to produce reliable predictions of the future. Different models have different ways of doing this, and the process is generally seen as being specific to an individual model. We compare the methods used by three different models and show that they produce similar outputs. We also demonstrate that the outputs from one model can be used in other models without introducing large uncertainties.\n\nInferring the basal sliding coefficient field for the Stokes ice sheet model under rheological uncertainty\n\nOlalekan Babaniyi, Ruanui Nicholson, Umberto Villa, and NoÃ©mi Petra\n\nThe Cryosphere, 15, 1731–1750, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-15-1731-2021,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-15-1731-2021, 2021\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe consider the problem of inferring unknown parameter fields under additional uncertainty for an ice sheet model from synthetic surface ice flow velocity measurements. Our results indicate that accounting for model uncertainty stemming from the presence of nuisance parameters is crucial. Namely our findings suggest that using nominal values for these parameters, as is often done in practice, without taking into account the resulting modeling error can lead to overconfident and biased results.\n\nThe tipping points and early warning indicators for Pine Island Glacier, West Antarctica\n\nSebastian H. R. Rosier, Ronja Reese, Jonathan F. Donges, Jan De Rydt, G. Hilmar Gudmundsson, and Ricarda Winkelmann\n\nThe Cryosphere, 15, 1501–1516, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-15-1501-2021,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-15-1501-2021, 2021\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nPine Island Glacier has contributed more to sea-level rise over the past decades than any other glacier in Antarctica. Ice-flow modelling studies have shown that it can undergo periods of rapid mass loss, but no study has shown that these future changes could cross a tipping point and therefore be effectively irreversible. Here, we assess the stability of Pine Island Glacier, quantifying the changes in ocean temperatures required to cross future tipping points using statistical methods.\n\nSensitivity of ice sheet surface velocity and elevation to variations in basal friction and topography in the full Stokes and shallow-shelf approximation frameworks using adjoint equations\n\nGong Cheng, Nina Kirchner, and Per LÃ¶tstedt\n\nThe Cryosphere, 15, 715–742, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-15-715-2021,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-15-715-2021, 2021\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe present an inverse modeling approach to improve the understanding of spatiotemporally variable processes at the inaccessible base of an ice sheet by determining the sensitivity of direct surface observations to perturbations of basal conditions. Time dependency is proved to be important in these types of problems. The effect of perturbations is analyzed based on analytical and numerical solutions.\n\nQuantifying the effect of ocean bed properties on ice sheet geometry over 40 000 years with a full-Stokes model\n\nClemens Schannwell, Reinhard Drews, Todd A. Ehlers, Olaf Eisen, Christoph Mayer, Mika Malinen, Emma C. Smith, and Hannes Eisermann\n\nThe Cryosphere, 14, 3917–3934, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-14-3917-2020,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-14-3917-2020, 2020\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nTo reduce uncertainties associated with sea level rise projections, an accurate representation of ice flow is paramount. Most ice sheet models rely on simplified versions of the underlying ice flow equations. Due to the high computational costs, ice sheet models based on the complete ice flow equations have been restricted to < 1000 years. Here, we present a new model setup that extends the applicability of such models by an order of magnitude, permitting simulations of 40 000 years.\n\nBayesian calibration of firn densification models\n\nVincent Verja"
