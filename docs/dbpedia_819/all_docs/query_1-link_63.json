Scientific observations of a significant concentration …\n\nNational Capability for Global Challenges\n\nPolar Expertise – Supporting Development\n\nTesting space flight missions at Halley\n\nThe remoteness and winter isolation of communities working in Antarctica provide an excellent environment for research into human behaviour, performance, health and well being. Many studies of overwintering staff in Antarctica …\n\nCambridge Centre for Climate Science\n\nCCfCS promotes interdisciplinary research in climate science across the wide range of departments and institutes in Cambridge."
