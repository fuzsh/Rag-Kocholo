People discover, learn about, follow, and shop from brands on social media, so if you’re not on platforms like Facebook, Instagram, and LinkedIn, you’re missing out! Great marketing on social media can bring remarkable success to your business, creating devoted brand advocates and even driving leads and sales.\n\nIn this complete guide to social media marketing, you’re going to learn:\n\nWhat social media marketing is, with benefits, stats, and tips.\n\nHow to build a social media marketing strategy and a plan to carry it out.\n\nThe seven best social media marketing platforms and how to use them\n\nClick to view full-size.\n\nTable of contents\n\nWhat is social media marketing?\n\nBenefits of social media marketing\n\nSocial media marketing statistics\n\nSocial media marketing strategy\n\nCreating your social media marketing plan\n\nSocial media marketing tips\n\nThe best social media marketing platforms\n\nSocial media marketing courses\n\nSocial media marketing services\n\nWhat is social media marketing?\n\nSocial media marketing is a form of digital marketing that leverages the power of popular social media networks to achieve your marketing and branding goals. But it’s not just about creating business accounts and posting when you feel like it. Social media marketing requires an evolving strategy with measurable goals and includes:\n\nMaintaining and optimizing your profiles.\n\nPosting pictures, videos, stories, and live videos that represent your brand and attract a relevant audience.\n\nResponding to comments, shares, and likes and monitoring your reputation.\n\nFollowing and engaging with followers, customers, and influencers to build a community around your brand.\n\nSocial media marketing also includes paid social media advertising, where you can pay to have your business appear in front of large volumes of highly targeted users.\n\nBenefits of social media marketing\n\nWith such widespread usage and versatility, social media is one of the most effective free channels for marketing your business today. Here are some of the specific benefits of social media marketing:\n\nHumanize your business: Social media enables you to turn your business into an active participant in your market. Your profile, posts, and interactions with users form an approachable persona that your audience can familiarize and connect with, and come to trust.\n\nDrive traffic: Between the link in your profile, blog post links in your posts, and your ads, social media is a top channel for increasing traffic to your website where you can convert visitors into customers. Plus, social signals are an indirect SEO factor.\n\nGenerate leads and customers: You can also generate leads and conversions directly on these platforms, through features like Instagram/Facebook shops, direct messaging, call to action buttons on profiles, and appointment booking capabilities.\n\nIncrease brand awareness: The visual nature of social media platforms allows you to build your visual identity across vast audiences and improve brand awareness. And better brand awareness means better results with all your other campaigns.\n\nBuild relationships: These platforms open up both direct and indirect lines of communication with your followers through which you can network, gather feedback, hold discussions, and connect directly with individuals.\n\nThe bigger and more engaged your audience is on social media networks, the easier it will be for you to achieve your marketing goals.\n\nSocial media marketing statistics\n\nWith regard to the benefits above, don’t just take our word for it. Let’s take a look at some social media marketing statistics that prove its power:\n\nThe average US adult spends 2.25 hours on social media every day.\n\nOver 70% of people who have a positive experience with a business on social media will recommend that business to their networks.\n\nFacebook users click on 12 Facebook ads on average every month.\n\n81% of people use Instagram to research products and services.\n\nNearly 80% of Twitter users feel more positive about a business when they get a response to their tweet.\n\n4 out of 5 people on LinkedIn drive business decisions.\n\n46% of TikTok users engage in the app without any other distractions.\n\nThe essentials of a successful social media marketing strategy\n\nA successful social media marketing strategy will look different for every business, but here are the things they will all have in common:\n\nKnowledge of your audience: What platforms they use, when they go on them and why, what content they like, who else they’re following, and more.\n\nBrand identity: What is the message you want to convey to your audience? How do you want them to feel when viewing your content?\n\nContent strategy: While there is a level of spontaneity on social, you’ll need a structured content strategy to be able to have a consistent voice and produce quality content regularly.\n\nAnalytics: Quantifiable insights will inform your strategy, including who you’re reaching, the right content to share, the best times to post, and more.\n\nRegular activity: Social media is a real-time platform. If you want to use it to grow your business, you need to post regularly, stay on top of engagements with your business, engage back, keep up with trends, and maintain accurate profiles.\n\nInbound approach: Don’t use social media to pitch your business. Focus on adding value through useful and interesting content and building up those around you. This, in turn, will organically promote your business and others will promote it for you.\n\nFor more help, head to our Easy Guide to Social Media for Small Businesses\n\nCreating your social media marketing plan\n\nNow that you know the essentials of a social media marketing strategy, it’s time to put it into action. Your social media marketing plan is the roadmap to carrying out your strategy. It puts structure around your efforts so you can measure your success and make sure you’re spending your resources wisely. Here’s how to create your social media marketing plan:\n\nChoose your platforms: Choose based on your target audience, platforms popular for your industry, as well as your bandwidth. Only take on the number of platforms you can actively keep up with. You can always start with one and then add on more slowly as you get the hang of them.\n\nSet goals and objectives: These should be simple and task-like to start, like post once a day for a month, get your profiles set up, or do a competitive analysis. Once you get into a rhythm and gather insights, you’ll be able to set more specific and strategic goals like increase your following by X% or publish X [content types you’ve found your audience likes] per month.\n\nReport and adjust regularly: Use each platform’s analytics to identify which posts generate the most engagement, whether you’re getting more followers, and to see your audience demographics. Harness and scale up what works and nix what doesn’t.\n\nSocial media marketing tips\n\nReady to get started with marketing on social media? Here are a few social media marketing tips to kick off your social media campaigns.\n\nCreate diverse content\n\nConsistent with other areas of online marketing, content reigns supreme when it comes to social media marketing. Make sure you post regularly and offer truly valuable information that your ideal customers will find helpful and interesting. This includes:\n\nHow-tos, quick tips\n\nLocal and industry news\n\nData and insights\n\nPolls, questions, contests\n\nUpdates and announcements\n\nIt also means making use of the variety of formats social media offers, including images, videos, stories, live streams, online stores, and more.\n\nFor help with creating awesome social media content:\n\nCheck out our guides on Instagram Live, Facebook Live, and YouTube Live.\n\nTry out these 6 Epic Instagram Story Hacks You’ll Wish You Knew Sooner.\n\nUse templates! Like these Holiday & Christmas Social Media Post Templates.\n\nStay consistent\n\nUsing social media for marketing enables your business to project your brand image across a variety of different social media platforms. While each platform has its own unique environment and voice, your business’s core identity, whether it’s friendly, fun, or trustworthy, should stay consistent.\n\nDon’t just post—participate\n\nIn other words, don’t just log in once a month to schedule out all your posts. Social media channels are communities. You need to pay attention to who’s engaging with your content and engage back—respond to comments, like, share and comment on their posts, run live streams, post polls and real-time questions to spark discussions, and repost others’ content.\n\nUse content creation tools\n\nDon’t let anyone tell you that Instagram is the most visual social media platform. They all are! If you want to stand out in a person’s feed, you need to accompany your posts with attractive visuals—photos, illustrations, text turned into art. Content creation tools like Freepik and Canva have templates and features that allow you to quickly create visuals that look professional, have your logo on them, and are consistent with your brand.\n\nRepurpose, repost, recycle\n\nSocial media is a crowded place, so if you want to gain traction with your audience, you need to post great content regularly. The secret to doing this? The three Rs:\n\nRepurpose: Create a Facebook post from a customer review, splice up a blog post into a series of Tweets, distill a case study down into a customer spotlight on Instagram; turn a webinar deck into a carousel post on LinkedIn. The possibilities are endless.\n\nRepost: To be done in moderation, but a great way to fill gaps in your content calendar. Repost on Instagram and retweet user-generated and influencer content. You can also curate content from authoritative sources and share those links in your posts.\n\nRecycle: Post your TikTok videos and Instagram Reels to YouTube; re-share your top-performing blog posts every month to get in front of new followers; add your Facebook Live recordings to your YouTube channel.\n\nCurate your own feed\n\nWe’re always looking for ways to show up in others’ feeds, but we forget that there is value to be derived from our own. Follow your competitors so you can keep tabs on them, get ideas you can adapt to your own strategy, and identify gaps you can fill. Follow influencers to stay on top of trends and educate yourself. Follow brands that share your values or that have great content strategies for inspiration and outside the box ideas.\n\nMeasure success with analytics\n\nYou can’t determine the success of your social media marketing strategies without tracking data. Google Analytics can be used as a great social media marketing tool that will help you measure your most triumphant social media marketing techniques, as well as determine which strategies are better off abandoned. Attach tracking tags to your social media marketing campaigns so that you can properly monitor them. And be sure to use the analytics within each social platform for even more insight into which of your social content is performing best with your audience.\n\nTry paid social\n\nAmong the many reasons to advertise on social media is that it is a highly cost-effective way to expand your reach. If you play your cards right, you can get your content and offers in front of a huge audience at a very low cost. Most social media platforms offer incredibly granular targeting capabilities, allowing you to focus your budget on exactly the types of people that are most likely to be interested in your business.

For example:\n\nSocial media management software: Social media management platforms like HootSuite and Sprout Social use proprietary technology to help more experienced social media marketers streamline their processes and get advanced analytics.\n\nSocial media marketing agencies: Some agencies specialize in social media marketing only, like Akvertise or even just paid social advertising only.\n\nDigital marketing agencies: Just as one platform doesn’t do it for social media marketing, one channel doesn’t do it for overall marketing. Digital marketing agencies can help you to incorporate social media marketing into your broader strategy that includes email, website, SEO, and more.\n\nHybrid services: Some offer a mix of the above. For example, LOCALiQ’s social advertising offerings use proprietary technology to manage your strategy and allow you to focus on social alone or as part of a broader plan.\n\nStart prioritizing your social media marketing strategy\n\nUsing social media in marketing does more than improve site traffic and increase your reach. It turns your business into a personality that your audience can communicate and connect with on a deeper level.\n\nRegardless of which platforms you use or how you use them, the most important thing to remember is that social media is not a platform to pitch your business. It’s a community for you to express your personality, demonstrate your values, share useful information, and build up those around you. With people naturally following you and promoting your content, there will be no need for pitching. And with this approach, you’ll achieve not just your business goals but all of the other intangibles that translate to gratification and fulfillment."
