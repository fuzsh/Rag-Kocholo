        "text": "It seems like not a day goes by without billionaire Elon Musk making headlines.\n\nThe boss of X (formerly Twitter), Tesla and SpaceX is the world's richest person and has used his platform to make his views known on a vast array of topics.\n\nHe has also charged ahead with human brain chip trials at his firm Neuralink, played with turning X into a super app and tried to play a bigger role in the fast-growing world of artificial intelligence, despite having warned it could lead to humanity's extinction.\n\nBut Mr Musk's moves such as suing the creator of ChatGPT and commenting on political issues around the world have continued to attract attention and controversy.\n\nWhere was Elon Musk born?\n\nSince bursting on to the Silicon Valley scene more than two decades ago, the 53-year-old serial entrepreneur has kept the public captivated with his business antics.\n\nBorn in Pretoria, South Africa, Mr Musk showed his talents for entrepreneurship early, going door-to-door with his brother selling homemade chocolate Easter eggs and developing his first computer game at the age of 12.\n\nHe has described his childhood as difficult, affected by his parents' divorce, bullying at school and his own difficulty picking up on social cues because of Asperger's Syndrome. At the earliest opportunity, he left home for college, moving to Canada and then the US, where he studied economics and physics at the University of Pennsylvania, an Ivy League college.\n\nIn a 2010 essay for Marie Claire, his first wife, Justine Musk, a writer whom he met in college and married in 2000, wrote that even before making his millions Mr Musk was \"not a man who takes no for an answer\".\n\n\"The will to compete and dominate, that made him so successful in business, did not magically shut off when he came home,\" she recalled, adding that he told her while dancing at their wedding, \"I am the alpha in this relationship.\"\n\nHow did Elon Musk make his money?\n\nAfter being accepted to a physics graduate degree programme at Stanford University, Mr Musk quickly dropped out and founded two technology start-ups during the \"dotcom boom\" of the 1990s. These included a web software firm and an online banking company that eventually became PayPal, which was sold to eBay in 2002 for $1.5bn (£1.2bn).\n\nHe ploughed his fortune into a new rocket company, SpaceX - which he aimed to make a cost-effective alternative to Nasa - and a new electric car company, Tesla, where he chaired the board until becoming chief executive in 2008.\n\nThe two firms are credited with upending their industries, even as they sometimes veered close to financial collapse.\n\nMore recent business ventures include his takeover of social media platform Twitter in October 2022.\n\nSince then he has dramatically reduced the size of its workforce including, controversially, cuts to teams responsible for keeping the platform safe; rebranded the company as X; and introduced new premium subscriptions so that the business does not rely on advertising alone for income.\n\nMr Musk's long-term ambition is for X to become an \"everything app\" offering a range of services. However, so far the value of the firm has plunged from the $44bn he originally paid to just $19bn, according to reports.\n\nHe also has ambitions in the AI sector, being an early investor in ChatGPT's parent company before parting ways in 2018, and setting up his own company xAI\"to understand the true nature of the universe\" in 2023.\n\nIn February, hesued OpenAI and its boss Sam Altman, saying the firm he helped found had reneged on its non-profit, open source origins by hitching its wagon to Microsoft.\n\n\"I'm never hugely convinced that he knows what he wants to do tomorrow,\" says journalist Chris Stokel-Walker of Mr Musk's wide-ranging interests. \"He very much leads by instinct.\"\n\nIn a 2015 biography, author Ashlee Vance described Mr Musk as \"a confrontational know-it-all\" with an \"abundant ego\". But he also called him an awkward dancer and diffident public speaker.\n\nIn the press, he's been dubbed both a mad genius and Twitter's biggest troll - known as much for his lofty ambitions as his petty fights, not to mention the more serious lawsuits he and his companies have faced from regulators, investors and others over issues such as racial discrimination and the trustworthiness of his claims.\n\nDivorced three times - twice from the same woman, British actress Talulah Riley - Mr Musk is frank about his faults.\n\n\"If you list my sins, I sound like the worst person on Earth,\" Mr Musk said in a TED interview last year. \"But if you put those against the things I've done right, it makes much more sense.\"\n\nWhat is Elon Musk's net worth?\n\nAll those contradictions appear to be part of Mr Musk's appeal - and it certainly hasn't stopped him amassing a fortune.\n\nBloomberg ranks him as the world's richest person, estimating his net worthto be around $228bn.\n\nThat's based largely on the value of his shares in Tesla, of which he owns more than 13%. The company's stock soared in value - some say unreasonably - in 2020 as the firm's output increased and it started to deliver regular profits.\n\nThe shares plunged at the end of 2022, with some blaming the distraction of the Twitter takeover for the fall, though they have since recovered ground.\n\nMr Musk also champions digital currencies and has a hand in several other smaller companies, including tunnel-maker the Boring Company and experimental brain-computer start-up Neuralink.\n\nMr Musk, who wears the mantle of a workaholic proudly, has often said he's not in business simply to make money - claims he repeated recently with regard to his Twitter takeover.\n\n\"Elon only gets involved with things if he feels that they're critically important for some reason... for the sake of society or humanity,\" says friend and Tesla investor Ross Gerber.\n\nWhat are Elon Musk's political views?\n\nMr Musk, who became a US citizen in 2002, has resisted efforts to label his politics - calling himself \"half-Democrat, half-Republican\", \"politically moderate\" and \"independent\".\n\nThat doesn't mean he's shied away from political debate.\n\nHe has shared controversial takes on X about local issues facing countries worldwide, such as suggesting the UK was on the cusp of \"civil war\" amid violent unrest in August.\n\nAnd he has injected himself into some of the world's hottest geopolitical fights - suggesting that China should establish a \"special administrative zone\" in Taiwan, and proposing terms to resolve the war in Ukraine that were adamantly rejected by many of the country's top leaders.\n\nMr Musk made the remarks in response to a video showing people aiming fireworks at police.\n\nThe prime minister's spokesperson said there was \"no justification\" for Mr Musk's comments, adding there was more that social media companies \"can and should be doing\".\n\nWhile Mr Musk provided his Starlink satellite internet service to Ukraine, he also attracted criticism for refusing an emergency request from Kyiv to activate Starlink in Sevastopol, home to a major Russian navy port.\n\nIn the US, he moved to Texas, complaining of California's regulations and high taxes; has clashed with union organisers; and, in the spring of 2020, decried coronavirus lockdowns as \"fascist\".\n\nAnd while he was one of the first business executives to distance themselves from Donald Trump during his presidency,Mr Musk officially endorsed the former president for a second term in 2024 after his attempted assassination.\n\nHe's made it clear he's not a fan of President Joe Biden, whom he sees as snubbing Tesla while promoting electric vehicles.\n\nHe has said that he sees his businesses as a form of philanthropy, because they are focused on solving major human issues, such as climate change in the case of Tesla.\n\nAnd despite his own interest in artificial intelligence, he has also been one of the most prominent figures worried about the supposed threat to humanity's future that super-intelligent AIs might pose.\n\nHe has claimed that the rise of artificial intelligence, combined with a declining birth rate, could result in \"not enough people\" being in the world.\n\nHere, you can't accuse him of not doing his part.\n\nMr Musk has had 12 children - six with his first wife, three with Canadian singer Grimes, and three with Shivon Zilis.\n\nFollowing the birth of his twins with Ms Zilis, he tweeted: \"Doing my best to help the underpopulation crisis.\"\n\nAdditional reporting by Liv McMahon"
