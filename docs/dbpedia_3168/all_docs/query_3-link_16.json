        "text": "In a bid to make its platform even more appealing to its die-hard fans and newcomers, Twitter introduced several new features over the past couple of years.\n\nOne of the most recognizable and appreciative efforts was Twitter Communities, which provides users with an exclusive online space to get closer to the discussions they care about the most.\n\nIf you observe the current scenario, Twitter Communities are increasingly grabbing eyeballs, and for a good reason. Brands are now looking for innovative ways to leverage Twitter Communities in order to reach their audience.\n\nThey offer an outstanding opportunity to build a community of brand advocates and strengthen brand visibility.\n\nIf you are a business wanting to know how to grow your brand with the help of Twitter Communities, you are at just the right place.\n\nIn this post, we‚Äôll discuss how you can use Twitter Communities as a potential marketing channel that will help create and nurture valuable relationships with prospective buyers and your existing customers. Let‚Äôs begin:\n\nWhat Are Twitter Communities?\n\nTwitter Communities are online groups where individuals can engage and interact with other individuals with the same interests.\n\nAs long as they follow Twitter‚Äôs terms of service , Twitter Communities can be based on any specific type of interest. In these dedicated spaces, users can connect, share content, and conduct discussions.\n\nSimilar to Facebook and Slack, users are able to create and moderate these social communities.\n\nHere‚Äôs an example of a Community on Twitter created for shoe lovers to come together and discuss everything sneakers:\n\nAnyone can view the tweets in these communities, but only community members can participate and engage in a discussion.\n\nIndividuals can start and manage Communities on Twitter as admins and moderators, who keep the conversations fun, informative, and relevant. They also enforce Community rules.\n\nAlso, an individual who accepts an invite to join a Community becomes its member. An individual can also ask to join a Community, and the Community admin can accept it.\n\nHow to Create Twitter Communities?\n\nThe primary purpose behind Twitter Communities is to let a person create a group of individuals who share the same passions, hobbies, goals, and interests.\n\nTo create a Community on Twitter, you need to (here üëâ) submit a form for approval after you log in to your account. Here‚Äôs what the form looks like:\n\nOnce you do this, you have to wait for approval. Once approved, community creators can build a hub enabling Twitter users to have relevant discussions.\n\nHow to Find, Join, and Tweet in a Twitter Community\n\nMarketers need to understand other communities on Twitter in order to create an engaging, dedicated Community for their brand‚Äôs current and potential customers. So, first thing first ‚Äì how to find Twitter communities?\n\nHere are the steps you need to follow to find and join a Community you are interested in:\n\nSign in to your Twitter account through the mobile app or website.\n\nOpen the Twitter Communities account page as shown below:\n\nScroll down to look for a Community that interests you. Then, click on ‚ÄúView Community.‚Äù\n\nNext, click on ‚ÄúJoin.‚Äù\n\nNow, all you need to do is go through the rules for that Community and choose the ‚ÄúAgree and Join‚Äù button. Check this image below:\n\nAnd you are done!\n\nIf you want to join an ‚Äúinvite-only‚Äù community, select ‚ÄúAgree and Ask to Join‚Äù (as shown in the image below).\n\nNow, you would simply have to wait for approval from the moderator.\n\nHere‚Äôs another way you can find and join a Community on Twitter:\n\nOpen Twitter.\n\nSearch for ‚ÄúTwitter Communities‚Äù in the search bar.\n\nOnce the search results appear, tap on the official Twitter Communities account.\n\nNext, tap on the ‚ÄúLikes‚Äù of the Twitter Communities account.\n\nNow, tap on the search icon and enter the name of the Community you want to join. For instance, search for a Community called ‚ÄúWordle.‚Äù\n\nNow simply tap on Wordle‚Äôs post by the Twitter Communities official. Then, click on Join. That‚Äôs it, you are done!\n\nListen Up:\n\nAfter you join your first Community, a ‚ÄúCommunities‚Äù icon shows up on the bottom bar of your app or in the left menu of your Twitter page.\n\nOnce you select this option, you can scroll down to the Discover section to check out more communities (refer to the image below):\n\nIn case you want to check if a Community exists for a topic or want to search for a specific community, type the keyword or name in the search field (located at the top).\n\nHow to Post in a Twitter Community?\n\nTo post your tweet in a Community, here‚Äôs what you need to do:\n\nEnsure you are viewing the Community‚Äôs feed. Now, select the Tweet button.\n\nNext, just type your Tweet and then post it.\n\nHow to Use Twitter Communities to Grow Your Brand?\n\nNow that we have the most common questions out of the way let‚Äôs come to our main subject‚Äìhow to leverage Twitter Communities for the growth of your brand.\n\nThese communities are fantastic tools for businesses to connect with their target audience and develop a community around their brand. These groups can help businesses to boost sales and achieve successful business growth.\n\nAll said and done, it‚Äôs time to take a detailed look at how you can use Twitter Communities to grow your brand. Let‚Äôs begin:\n\n1. Focus on Topics That Matter\n\nAs we mentioned, don‚Äôt use these communities to fixate on promotion and marketing. As these groups allow you to position yourself as a friend, influencer, and leader, use them to focus on topics that matter.\n\nShare helpful, relevant, and timely content. This also ensures that your members continue to follow and spread the word about your brand to others.\n\nTake a look at this image that shows how you can share helpful and relevant content in a Community:\n\n2. Extend a Helping Hand\n\nUse your Community to provide value, carefully listen to, and extend a helping hand to your Community members. Also, ensure the conversations are always carried out in a positive setting.\n\nAll of this humanizes your brand, and you gain your audience‚Äôs confidence.\n\nCheck this post that encourages a conversation that can be helpful for everyone in the Community:\n\n3. Create VIP Experiences\n\nIn this day and age, people want to be treated specially. One of the best and easiest ways you can use Twitter Communities is to offer VIP experiences to your customers. For instance, you can offer priority passes for brand events.\n\nWhen you provide such an experience, you can turn your customers into evangelists and loyal fans.\n\nTake a look at this example where a Twitter user shares a limited-time deal offer within a Community, which can definitely make everyone in the Community feel a little extra special:\n\n4. Focus on Engagement\n\nA good rule of thumb you must follow with any social media channel is to cultivate genuine engagement.\n\nSharing content with your Community members that they will be very interested in and relate to is the best way to engage them and keep them coming for more. You can easily tailor content according to what your Community members care about.\n\nTo know more about the engagement you create, check Twitter Analytics:\n\n5. Learn About Your Community Members\n\nTwitter communities also offer brands the means to gain more information about their audience.\n\nFor instance, they get to know their pain points, what topics they discuss, what strikes a chord with them, and what problems or challenges they face.\n\nAll of this information helps a business build a more solid brand that resonates with its audience.\n\nTake a look at how you can promote conversation within a Community to know more about the Community‚Äôs members:\n\n6. Leverage a More Intimate Space\n\nIf you observe the present scenario, the online Community, in general, has become somewhat superficial and saturated. Due to this, people are now searching for more intimate spaces.\n\nEnter Twitter Communities.\n\nThese exclusive spaces help brands share relevant content with their Community members, carry out fruitful conversations, and leverage the opportunity to get closer to their audience.\n\nTake a look at how Scott Zona uses Twitter Communities to promote his book to the Community members of ‚ÄúPlant Twitter‚Äù to help them know more about plants:\n\n7. Showcase Your Authenticity\n\nIn today‚Äôs modern world, people value authenticity. It is what gives a human touch to your brand. Using Twitter Communities to share exclusive, valuable content with your audience is one surefire way to build authentic connections.\n\nTake a look at this example where Tai Samut, a restaurant, showcases its authenticity by sharing exclusive dishes within a Community:\n\nThe best thing about Twitter communities is that they enable brands to build a close-knit community, instilling confidence and trust for your brand in your target audience.\n\nManaging a Community\n\nLet‚Äôs now take a look at some important pointers that you, as a brand, must know about managing a Community on Twitter:\n\nAn admin is the owner of a Community.\n\nAdmins can add new moderators from the list of members. They also can remove current moderators.\n\nA Community needs to have a minimum of one rule. It can have a maximum of ten rules. Here‚Äôs an example of rules that are set for a Community on Twitter:\n\nNo limit exists to the number of moderators for a Community.\n\nTwitter allows only admins to change the settings of a Community. Under Membership, they can find two options‚ÄìRestricted or Open. Here are the two options we are talking about:\n\nIf they choose ‚ÄúOpen,‚Äù it enables any individual to join the Community automatically by clicking on ‚ÄúJoin.‚Äù\n\nThe additional roles of a moderator can include managing member requests/invites to join a Community. They can also set the tone for discussion within the Community.\n\nYour community manager should be fully aware of Twitter‚Äôs rules. This ensures that your Community doesn‚Äôt get deactivated. Also, always be on the watch for harmful, offensive, or abusive comments.\n\nWrapping It Up\n\nTwitter Communities offer the perfect opportunity to develop a community around an interest, purpose, or belief. People looking for more authentic and uncluttered niche hangouts are the ones that are drawn to these communities the most.\n\nIf you follow the tips we‚Äôve discussed so far, you will move steps ahead in growing your brand with the help of Twitter Communities. This is because your Community members will comprise a highly-targeted group that trusts you and looks forward to content from your brand.\n\nIf your business caters to different interests, you can think about creating multiple Communities.\n\nAll said and done, it‚Äôs now time you use Twitter Communities to develop your community of brand advocates. Keep an eye out for any new updates related to these online groups, and you are all set!"
