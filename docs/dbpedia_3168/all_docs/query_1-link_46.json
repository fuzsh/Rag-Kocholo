        "text": "Vocational Rehabilitation Services\n\nConnect with OVR on Social!\n\nTo apply for OVR services, please contact the OVR District Office that serves your county or apply for services online via the PA CareerLink's Job Seeker Registration Page.\n\nThe Pennsylvania Office of Vocational Rehabilitation, or OVR, provides vocational rehabilitation services to help persons with disabilities prepare for, obtain or maintain employment. OVR provides services to eligible individuals with disabilities, both directly and through a network of approved vendors. Services are provided on an individualized basis. The OVR counselor, during face-to-face interviews, assists customers in selecting their choice of vocational goals, services and service providers. An Individualized Plan for Employment (IPE) is developed, outlining a vocational objective, services, providers and responsibilities. Certain services are subject to a Financial Needs Test (FNT) and may require financial participation by the customer. Counseling and guidance, diagnostic services, assessments, information and referral, job development and placement, and personal services such as readers or sign language interpreters are provided at no cost to the individual. Also, by law, OVR customers receiving Social Security benefits for their disability (SSI, SSDI) are exempt from OVR’s Financial Needs Test.\n\nStatewide there are 21 District Offices staffed with trained, professional Vocational Rehabilitation Counselors who serve Pennsylvania in all 67 counties. The Hiram G. Andrews Center in Johnstown provides vocational training and comprehensive rehabilitation services to people from across the state. OVR’s Bureau of Blindness and Visual Services provides specialized services to blind and visually impaired individuals. These services are designed to increase an individual’s independence and employability. OVR's central administrative offices in Harrisburg provide technical assistance to local district offices in order to improve service delivery.\n\nTypes of Vocational Rehabilitation Services\n\nOVR provides a wide range of services to eligible applicants. Some services can help you overcome or lessen your disability; others can directly help you prepare for a career. The services you receive will be arranged to meet your individual needs. Not everyone will need every service. OVR services include:\n\nDiagnostic Services: Medical, psychological, and audiological examinations and tests used to better understand your disability and your needs for specific types of services.\n\nVocational Evaluation: Aptitude, interest, general ability, academic exams, work tolerance and \"hands-on\" job experience used to understand your vocational potential.\n\nCounseling: Vocational counseling will help you to better understand your potential, to rely on your abilities, to set realistic vocational goals, to change them when necessary, to develop successful work habits and to begin a satisfying career. Counseling is available throughout your rehabilitation program.\n\nTraining: Education to prepare you for a job, including, but not limited to, basic academic, vocational/technical, college, on-the-job, independent living skills, and personal and work adjustment training.\n\nRestoration Services: Medical services and equipment, such as physical and occupational therapy, wheelchairs and automobile hand controls can be provided to enable you to pursue and achieve employment.\n\nPlacement Assistance: Counseling, job-seeking programs, job clubs, and job development used to increase your ability to get a job. You will receive ideas, practice and advise on finding job leads, filling out applications, getting interviews for a job and on how to interview. Your counselor may also give you job leads or contact employers about available tax credits and hiring incentives. The more contacts with employers you make, the better your chances are of finding a job. For more details, go to our Services for Job Seekers page.\n\nAssistive Technology: Assistive technology includes a wide range of devices and services that can empower persons with disabilities to maximize employment, independence and integration into society. OVR can assist an individual with a disability in effectively selecting and acquiring appropriate assistive technology. OVR can arrange for a consultant to evaluate your situation and to make appropriate recommendations. OVR also operates and maintains our own Center for Assistive and Rehabilitation Technology (CART) at the Hiram G. Andrews Center. There is no charge for evaluation and vocational counseling services through OVR. Based upon your financial needs, you may have to contribute to the cost of assistive technology devices and services. For more details, visit our Assistive Technology page.\n\nSupport Services: Other services are provided for eligible persons if they are necessary for you to start and maintain employment. Such services may include:\n\nRoom, board and transportation costs during an evaluation or while completing a rehabilitation program.\n\nOccupational tools, licenses or equipment.\n\nHome modifications, adaptive or special household equipment in order to help you get ready to go to and be on time for your job. Van or car modifications, including special driving devices or lifting devices to enable you to travel to your job.\n\nPersonal care assistance provided to help you with your daily needs in order to enable you to participate in a vocational rehabilitation program.\n\nJob site modifications that will enable you to get and keep a job. Independent living training to provide the means for you to become more self-sufficient and thereby make it possible for you to participate in employment.\n\nText Telephone (TTY), signaling devices, hearing aids, and interpreter services may be provided to help you communicate.\n\nSpecialized services such as Rehabilitation Teaching, and Orientation and Mobility Training for persons who are blind or visually impaired.\n\nWhat if I have Questions or Complaints?\n\nOVR will facilitate your rehabilitation program. Don’t hesitate to ask questions about anything. You are entitled to the best service that OVR can give you. Your comments, suggestions, and criticisms are important.\n\nIf you are an applicant or a customer of OVR and are dissatisfied with a determination or service OVR is providing, you may file an appeal.\n\nAppeal Procedures: A written request for a hearing must be made within thirty (30) days. This request must be mailed to or filed with the Director:\n\nBureau of Vocational Rehabilitation\n\nOffice of Vocational Rehabilitation\n\n651 Boas Street, 7th Floor\n\nHarrisburg, PA 17121\n\nAn impartial hearing officer will be assigned to hear and decide your case. You will be given the opportunity for an informal administrative review prior to the impartial hearing. At any time during your program you may contact the Client Assistance Program for help.\n\nWhat is the Client Assistance Program (CAP)?\n\nIf you have questions or concerns about OVR services, CAP can help. CAP is a federally mandated program that provides assistance and advocacy to applicants for and recipients of OVR services. CAP is not a part of OVR, and services are provided at no cost to its clients.\n\nContact CAP\n\nPhone: 215-557-7112 (voice/711Relay) or 888-745-2357 (voice/711Relay)\n\nFax: 215-557-7602\n\nEmail: admin@equalemployment.org\n\nMail: Client Assistance Program, 101 Greenwood Avenue, Suite 470, Jenkintown, PA 19046\n\nSubmit an inquiry on the CAP website"
