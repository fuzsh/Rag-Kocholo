        "text": "Using threads and long posts\n\nIn this section, we’ll look at the top X/Twitter thread formats of 2022 so you can borrow from the best and explode your X/Twitter growth with viral threads that will scale your account. Whatever applies to thread also applies to long posts because all these are the same\n\nWhy X/Twitter threads?\n\nX/Twitter is more than just a platform for venting your random thoughts so you don’t have to sit with them alone or to get things off your chest. You can be more strategic with it!\n\nX/Twitter is a marketing and networking tool. The best users understand the upside to having a powerful X/Twitter presence, and are busy making a name for themselves.\n\nHow do you establish yourself as an authority?\n\nThere are a couple of ways that professional X/Twitter users establish themselves, whether it is by sharing high-value tweets, giving insightful commentary on current affairs or trending topics, or displaying their expertise on industry discussions — but X/Twitter threads are how they get everyone to stop and think: “Wow, she knows what she’s talking about. I’m going to follow her.”\n\nX/Twitter threads are the best way to show the extent of your specific knowledge and the depth of your wisdom. On a platform where everyone is sharing platitudes and boring information, X/Twitter threads show that you have some insight to offer, that you do your research and take time to clarify your thoughts, and that whenever you share something, there’s a lot of value to be gained in paying attention.\n\nThreads display your unique style of thought and writing and let everyone know what ideas you like, what interests you, and what you’re good at.\n\nThat is the power of threads, and every day on X/Twitter smart people are using them to build their audience, create opportunities, expand their networks, and signal to like-minded individuals that they could get together and do amazing things.\n\nHow can you write your thought-provoking scroll-stopping threads?\n\nHere are a few X/Twitter thread ideas you can use to make everyone stop and take notice.\n\nAdvice threads\n\nThe first type of X/Twitter thread the pros have mastered is the advice thread.\n\nThis is a great thread with life lessons, realizations, or some reflections, which feel like stumbling upon that one revelation you’ve been waiting for to turn everything around. It makes you feel like scrolling isn’t a waste of time! This person has gone through a period of introspection and is now sharing what you can learn from their experience.\n\nIf your life has taught you a lot, these are the types of threads you should be writing. The key is to have authentic advice that’s useful and anything but generic.\n\nIf that’s not you, you can try to paraphrase Marcus Aurelius or other thinkers. You can curate the thoughts of different experts in the same field to give people something to think about. But be warned, accounts shilling ripped-off philosophy and sage zen wisdom are a dime a dozen, and you’ll have more success writing the other threads below than repeating the same old stuff.\n\nHere is a stellar thread by Naval on “How to Get Rich (without getting lucky).” This thread was such a success because, first, who doesn’t want to get rich? But more importantly, it offered actual, solid advice, especially in comparison to your typical best-selling motivational book.\n\nComplex topic thread\n\nThe next type of thread you can use to show off your brilliant thinking and your follow-worthiness is a X/Twitter thread on a complex topic or subject.\n\nThis type of thread is a guaranteed winner because the world has no shortage of things people don’t or only partially understand. When someone comes along and so kindly breaks down something that’s been puzzling everyone, the Twitterverse has no choice but to pay attention — because class is in session. You can take advantage of your niche knowledge in a layered topic and explain it in a way that the average person can understand.\n\nThe best X/Twitter users grasp this fundamental concept and are always on the lookout for topics that people can’t seem to wrap their heads around. When they find them, they are the first to make sense of what’s happening and share it in a detailed yet simplified way that everyone can appreciate.\n\nOf all the different X/Twitter threads you can use, this one gives you a relatively high chance of success. All you have to do is stay on the lookout for topics in the news that everyone is talking about — but not necessarily getting the full picture on. When you find one, do your research and get a grip on what’s going on, then put it all in a thread and share it.\n\nYou don’t necessarily have to wait for news topics either. You can find subjects in your niche that people usually get wrong and go in-depth on them. That way, you’re not only waiting for stories to find you, but you can actively seek them out for yourself.\n\nThis is a great example of a thread explaining a complex current affairs topic for everyone to understand. Notice how the first tweet of the thread starts by pointing out the complexity involved and ends by stating that this topic matters, letting everyone know to pay attention.\n\nIf you’re going to write a thread on a complex topic, don’t find random things no one couldn’t be bothered about. Find things people are watching and be fast.\n\nThe same thread above doesn’t get half the success it does if it’s shared a week or a month after everyone’s forgotten about it or had it explained to them by their favourite news reporter.\n\nExpert skill/knowledge thread\n\nIf you’re going to be known for something on X/Twitter, being known for doing one thing exceptionally well would be a great position to be in.\n\nX/Twitter is filled with all kinds of experts (you probably know some) but the best ones are those who let everyone in on how they make the magic happen from time to time. It’s a way to build authority as a person and not as an institution.\n\nThe expert skill thread is powerful because it lets everyone know what you’re about. That way, you create opportunities for yourself and you stick on to a lot of people’s radars once they know you’re legit. Plus, there’s the added benefit of building an audience that wants to learn from you.\n\nIf you have ambitions of one day monetizing your account, sharing expert knowledge is one of the best ways to build an audience that allows for that. You’ll have no shortage of people offering to work with you in some way, and if you ever release a course or a guide, there’ll be people ready to part with their money the moment it’s available.\n\nTo pull this thread off, you’ll need to have some skills or talent to show for yourself. If that’s not you, don’t worry, all experts start somewhere and you can begin by sharing threads on your journey to expert status!\n\nIf you spend a month learning how to code, there is a lot a person that’s never tried it could learn from you, and you could write for them. In that sense, being an expert is kind of relative. The point is, you should be writing and actively building an audience whatever level you’re at.\n\nHere is a great example of an expert skill thread from Dickie Bush. He is one of the founders of the Ship 30 for 30 Cohort, and if you follow him for any length of time, you’ll quickly realize that he is one of the most prolific writers on X/Twitter.\n\nTo write your expert thread, think about something your followers could do to get the same results as you. It could be a system you use, sources you rely on, or resources your followers could get to work as well as you do. Whatever it is, if it can help your followers get to your level, put it in a thread and share it.\n\n‘How I did it’ thread\n\nIf you’re a creator or entrepreneur, one of the most powerful pieces of content you could make is a breakdown of how you accomplished something.\n\nOn X/Twitter, that takes the form of a thread. And no, this type of thread is not the same as the expert thread we mentioned above!\n\nThis thread is more specific to an accomplishment or a goal, whereas experts share niche tips, processes, and general overviews of what it takes to get to a certain level.\n\nThe “how I did it” thread involves telling the story of how a particular goal was achieved. This could be something like launching a business, landing a client, achieving a certain amount of revenue in a given time, getting a certain number of subscribers, or something of that nature.\n\nThis thread requires you to have accomplished a goal you know your followers would like to achieve as well. In this thread, you would lay out a roadmap which, were it to be followed by somebody and they had the same bit of luck you had, could lead to an achievement similar to yours.\n\nThis is a powerful thread to use because you’ll find that a lot of people in your audience follow you because they aspire to have the same success as you.\n\nThe “How I did it” thread is how you help your audience achieve their goals, and if you share a lot of them in great detail, you’ll be rewarded with a loyal audience and the knowledge that you’ve truly positively impacted the people that look up to you.\n\nStory thread\n\nThe story thread is an incredible asset because the stories you share don’t even have to be yours for them to be thread-worthy. Story time is a universal tool that garners growth on multiple social media platforms.\n\nIf you’ve got a talent for recounting stories, put it to use and write as many threads as you can. They could be stories from your own life, from relatives, or even ones you read or heard about somewhere.\n\nAs useful as X/Twitter can be, it’s also just another place where people come to get entertained and a great story thread is always well-received.\n\nHere is an example of an amazing story thread. This one gets bonus points for having unravelled in real-time, but the point is that a great story gets people engaged and invested, and that’s what you should aim for.\n\nThe last two types of thread are slightly different from the rest but they are effective for growing your X/Twitter account and getting your audience engaged. They are also perfect if you don’t fancy yourself a master wordsmith.\n\nVisual thread\n\nThe first is a thread in a visual format. If you’re a visual content creator, this is one of the best ways to share your ideas or your work. Moreover, visual content has been shown to generate 70% more engagement than a basic tweet.\n\nIn this example, Shivsak takes Naval’s thread we mentioned earlier and shares the ideas expressed in it through a thread of images.\n\nAnother way to use a visual thread is to share your ideas. As you know, pictures are worth a thousand words, so adding images to your threads will help you get your point across even if you’re not the strongest of writers.\n\nA great example of this is Alex using images to relate ideas about a topic he loves.\n\nThe last type of thread you can use to build your X/Twitter audience could require the least amount of writing on your part: the compilation thread.\n\nCompilation thread\n\nAll you have to do to make a compilation thread is find a lot of similar or related share-worthy things and put them together in a thread. You could do this with other people’s threads or tweets, with recommendations, resources, links, or any collection of things you’d like to share with people. Curation is becoming a big thing in the media and creator economy and this is just one way of doing that.\n\nA compilation of threads like the one Hypefury CEO Yannick Vey made in this mega-thread is one of the most popular ways to do this. In the thread, he shares a compilation of visual threads to show how powerful sharing ideas in a visual format can be.\n\nAnother great example of a compilation thread is this thread from the AngelList account sharing a compilation of blogs from founders Naval and Nivi, giving out startup advice.\n\nChoosing the right thread genre for your particular audience\n\nYou can’t attract a valuable audience by sharing X/Twitter threads full of platitudes. You have to be intentional and specificin your approach.\n\nCatering to a small audience by presenting your niche thoughts in a niche style is the fastest way to grow and stand out on Twitter.\n\nDifferent audiences want to hear different things and you can’t serve everyone. Some audiences want inspiring content, others want how-tos and some want to hear the particular steps you took to get to where you are.\n\nFor example, David Perell is known for creating threads that combine visuals and text to produce impactful content. Here he talks about learning and education for children.\n\nOn the Internet, differentiation is free marketing. The best way to build is by creating content around earned secrets. These are ideas that only you can create content about. Find ideas that other people haven’t discovered and synthesise them in new ways.\n\nAlma Asinobi combines her skill as a storyteller with her job as a travel content creator to create threads that can only attract a unique audience. Creating a thread about the 14-year old friend she made on the plane is the definition of differentiation.\n\nKiller copy: Make the 1st tweet in the thread an amazing hook\n\nThe first tweet of your thread is the determining factor. It decides whether a reader will go ahead to read the whole thread, so you can’t afford to take it lightly.\n\nIt is the first tweet people see so it has to grab attention. It’s a lot like a headline or an email subject line: if it doesn’t suggest that you have valuable things to share, people won’t read the rest of what you have to say.\n\nThe first tweet of your X/Twitter thread should do two things: state clearly the purpose of the thread, and inspire enough curiosity in your target reader to read the whole thread.\n\nFor example, in the first tweet of this thread, David Perell states exactly what the whole thread is about, namely “becoming a better writer.” He used an amazing hook to pull people into the rest of the tweets.\n\nYour thread’s first tweet has to work as a singular message. It must also entice someone to click— either through the promise of some kind of valuable knowledge being shared, or the signal that you are about to disclose a coveted unique perspective.\n\nHere, Janis Ozolins uses his first tweet to state his thesis in a format that incites curiosity. “Productivity masterclass under 2 minutes, put your project on paper.” Then he explains the steps through the rest of the thread.\n\nCrafting a shareable thread, however, goes beyond a great first tweet. You need to make sure people clicking on the thread are going to read something worth their time.\n\nCall to action: End the thread with a clear call to do something\n\nThe definition of a waste of effort is not closing out your X/Twitter thread strategically.\n\nThe end of your thread is your opportunity to circle back, summarise and drill home the point that you’re trying to make. A report that focused on the engagement of threads found that engagement usually drops dramatically within the first two tweets of the thread. You’ve had the privilege of holding your user’s attention up to this point so you might as well cement this effort!\n\nEnd your thread with a clear call to action. Don’t be afraid to ask your consumers to do something on X/Twitter.\n\nIf you want your audience to take action, you need to tell them precisely what action you want them to take. Providing direction can be a powerful device – for example, previous research has shown that simply by including “Please ReTweet” in your tweet copy, you can increase retweets by 4X.\n\nA great example of this is how Aadit closes out his threads, with a call to action that can lead to growth on his account and his other platforms which provide more depth.\n\nX/Twitter threads are a powerful tool. If you want to establish yourself as an attention-worthy personality, you will have to share many of them to get people to realize that your account is where the good stuff is at!\n\nGo through the threads, study them, see why they work, and then go and write your own.\n\nFor more information on X/Twitter threads, check out our full article.\n\nSince X/Twitter launched the ability to link newsletters to your profile back in 2015, it has been all the rage. It exposed hard-working writers to a new and improved audience engagement loop – thanks to X/Twitter, you can gain new subscriptions to your newsletter, and thanks to your newsletter, you can gain new followers on X/Twitter!\n\nOver the course of 8 years, many people have learned tips and tricks to increase their email list. Here are some of the best practices for growing your X/Twitter newsletter!\n\nMake your first impression professional\n\nX/Twitter is known for being unprofessional and very laid-back compared to other social media platforms. You can keep that attitude for your replies and DMs, but the first impression for anyone coming across your page should be professional. You want to make sure that people are going to trust your newsletter and potentially want to work with you!\n\nMany huge creators have used this approach and have been successful in promoting their newsletters.\n\nTo make a successful first impression, make sure your profile is complete. This is crucial! It must include a neat profile picture with 60% of it showing your face (see above for more details), a standard header, a bio stating what you do with appropriate links to your profile, and of course, the link to your newsletter, as well as a nice pinned tweet.\n\nMake your newsletter easier to share\n\nRather than a suggestion at the bottom of the newsletter asking readers to share what they just read, why not add a link or button which directly shares the newsletter to your readers’ X/Twitter page? Your readers are more likely to share your content when the share button is easily accessible to them.\n\nTweet about it\n\nDon’t be afraid to talk about your newsletter! You’ve done a great job with it and it deserves all the attention it can get. Every 3 to 4 hours, send out a tweet talking about your newsletter and highlight some key points from it, using power words to get your newsletter more traction.\n\nPower words are persuasive words that are persuasive without coming across as pressuring or exaggerated. Some of those words are:\n\nNow\n\nWhy\n\nNo\n\nEnough\n\nInteract with your audience\n\nWithin the time intervals of your tweets, interact with your audience as much as possible. You can do this by replying to their comments and their DMs and sending a little message about your newsletter to your most loyal followers asking them for feedback.\n\nYou can also try interacting with big accounts in your niche. They will usually respond and give you feedback based on their own experience, which can help you steer your content in the right direction.\n\nDon’t sleep on analytics\n\nX/Twitter Analytics will give you an idea of which tweets worked best and which didn’t. The metrics provided include top tweets, tweet impressions, profile visits, mentions, and followers. This information will let you know how many people visited your profile at a given time, helping you figure out when to tweet and talk about your newsletter, as well as when to publish a new issue to gain traffic.\n\nPromote your new readers\n\nNotice someone who is a regular and loves reading your newsletter? Give them a shoutout on X/Twitter! This helps your exposure on their page and vice versa. Readers may also pay more attention to you knowing that they could get a free shoutout!\n\nGiveaways!\n\nYou can be even more generous and intriguing to your followers with giveaways.\n\nPost a tweet saying, “Subscribe to my newsletter for new information on niche and a chance to win asset, drop an emoji once you have subscribed!”. This gains a LOT of traction because people love free things!\n\nBut let’s talk about assets.\n\nYou can do this in 2 ways. You can give away a physical asset that isn’t related to your niche, such as money or a cool object, or you can give away something related to your niche – perhaps a free profile review, a free 3-week course on marketing, etc.\n\nOffering physical assets unrelated to your niche may attract lots of attention, but these people may not stick around! Offering them something related to the topics relevant to what you do, by contrast, will create a buzz in your community and bring you long-term subscribers.\n\nBe sneaky\n\nDisney is notorious for its smart tactics, as in this tweet.\n\nhttps://twitter.com/DisneyParks/status/899727614549659648\n\nThe Bambi wallpaper was within the tweet itself but users thought the link would lead them to it. Instead, the link revealed a page celebrating Bambi and its years in the box office!\n\nYou can do something similar. Tweet “Check out these analytics on niche” and attach an image of the analytics to your tweet as well as the link. This will radically increase your click rate!\n\nHowever, we don’t recommend doing this too often. You could eventually come across as being too sneaky and untrustworthy! Limit yourself to using this method once or twice with a newsletter that isn’t getting enough traction.\n\nCreate a schedule and stick to it\n\nWhile it’s very natural to get lost in other work and get delayed on a few tasks, try not to let that happen with your newsletter. Create a schedule and follow it religiously, especially if you’re new on social media! You don’t want to come across as unreliable and keeping your newsletter on schedule helps create more traction. Your loyal readers will be able to know exactly when to come to your profile for your latest newsletter!\n\nRepurpose old newsletters\n\nIf you send newsletters out pretty regularly, try linking an old newsletter with a tweet stating “Did you miss this?” This will give your followers a glance at what they sign up for when they subscribe to your newsletters and allows for more exposure if you use words related to your niche!\n\nYou can either send out a tweet simply sharing the newsletter with words from your niche, or you can add the newsletter to an extra tweet after a tweet that did very well! Hypefury has auto plugins that can automatically do that for you.\n\nInclude content from other platforms\n\nAdd in tweets, Instagram posts, LinkedIn posts, and TikToks –– and don’t forget to tag the creators! You will certainly catch their eyes. This gives you a chance to grow your newsletter to a greater extent by exposing you to different communities.\n\nQuestions\n\nWhen tweeting about your new newsletter, start with a question. It’s the easiest way to grab people’s attention and create a conversation with your followers. Frame your questions to be more about what your followers want to learn and provide them with an answer in the same tweet! Here are some examples:\n\nhttps://twitter.com/ExCCBusiness/status/1539919914743504897\n\nhttps://twitter.com/huttonboots/status/1542134583516311553\n\nOptimize your newsletter landing page\n\nWhen you’re promoting your email list, you will be directing your followers to landing pages. Those could make or break the deal.\n\nAlong with actionable language like “Let’s go!” or “Subscribe now!”, you also need good design.\n\nActionable language will get you an increase in clicks but a landing page design will get you your subscribers.\n\nLet’s be honest: we all are very busy and have very short attention spans. When we see colors and a great design, we are automatically drawn to that page!\n\nHere are a few tips to use for your landing page:\n\nCommunicate your unique selling point! It’s important to stand out in the incredibly saturated environment that is social media. At the very beginning of your page, start with a line that sets you apart from everyone else. For most people, it’s their inspiring story, for others their humor, and for some, it’s their unique outlook on life.\n\nUse a clean and simple design so as not to overwhelm your followers! Use 3 colors that represent your brand best and direct all the focus on the primary goal of your campaign. Remove anything that may deviate from your offer and use white space appropriately. White space removes congestion and gives the brain a moment to process all the given information.\n\nMake a catchy and short headline that’s easy to digest. Tell your followers what your offer is and immediately catch the attention of your readers.\n\nUse graphics to draw the eye, be it an image related to your niche, a meme, or a graph!\n\nReady to improve your newsletter?\n\nThese are just a few of the practices that professionals are following nowadays to improve their newsletter. It’s very normal to get lost in all the noise and not want to write anymore due to lack of traction, but consistency and patience are key!\n\nKnowing when is the best time to tweet would be the ultimate X/Twitter hack, but it is very difficult to pin down. Even if there were a best time, it wouldn’t be the same for everyone, which isn’t a very helpful realization. Finding your own best time to tweet will come down to your audience and your content strategy – but that doesn’t mean we can’t help you get pretty close to your engagement happy hour!\n\nFinding the best time to tweet: a question of logic\n\nIt essentially takes two things to find the best time for you to tweet: a little number crunching, and a lot more common sense.\n\nGreat tweets have more to do with the conversations your followers are into in that timeframe, and less to do with the time of day in and of itself.\n\nIf you don’t know where your audience is located yet, you can use Followerwonk to analyze your followers. Start tweeting based on where your followers are from and adjust what you tweet based on their timezones!\n\nTimes of day do matter\n\nAs we’ve discussed, the best time to tweet has very little to do with time itself. But since we’re talking time, it’d be a little unfair not to throw out some hours at you! Let’s look at the three times during the day when you should be looking to get a tweet out.\n\nThe morning rush (7 am – 10 am)\n\nSending tweets in the morning works really well because that’s the time when everyone is on their commute and looking to keep their minds occupied. If you want to maximize your engagement, go for a good morning tweet, such as a motivational post, or share how you and your followers can tackle the day.\n\nThe midday break (Noon – 2 pm)\n\nThe second best time to tweet during the day is around noon, when everybody is well into their day and looking to take a break. At that time of day, you can expect your followers to be heading to lunch or just checking in to see what kind of day everyone else is having.\n\nKeep your tweets lighthearted, quick and definitely not information-heavy. Sharing how you’re staying productive, a meme to lighten things up, or how you’re getting things done is the way to go at that time of day.\n\nThe end of day wind down (4 pm onwards)\n\nTweets towards the latter part of the day do really well because at this time, people are mostly done with their day and they can actually spend some time online. Sending your tweet when people haven’t quite started with their evening plans is a great way to pick up some engagement for yourself. Sharing how your day went, your plans for getting ahead or the fun stuff you’ll be getting up to for the night are great ways to strike up a conversation with your followers. Taking an interest in how your followers’ days went and their plans is also a great way to invite them to get talking to you.\n\nHow to time your tweets properly\n\nNow that you’ve got a pretty good idea of when to be posting your tweets, we’re going to look at a whole different aspect of timing for your tweets. As we mentioned earlier, virality and your tweets gaining traction aren’t a matter of when you tweet but how you tweet.\n\nBe relatable\n\nThe best time to tweet is when you feel your followers are going to relate to the thought you’re sharing. If the tweet you’re thinking up feels relatable to the average guy or girl going through their feed, share it. The more relatable you are through your tweets, the more people share you with their audience.\n\nBe timely\n\nThe next thing you should focus on is making your tweets as timely as possible. Being timely is all about having your tweets feel right for the time when you do post them. You don’t want to see good morning tweets towards the end of the day or tips on how to optimize your sleep on your timeline at midday. The same should go for your tweets. Have your tweets reflect the time your followers will see it, it’ll make your content that much more relatable.\n\nFollow the conversation\n\nA great way to time your tweets is to follow the topics that are dominating the conversation in your circle. Wherever the conversation goes in your corner of X/Twitter, you should never miss a chance to share your two cents. The only qualifier to that would be to avoid being a know-it-all or commenting on topics you know very little about it.\n\nYour best time to tweet\n\nTiming your tweets properly doesn’t have to be a drag. With Hypefury, getting your timing right is even simpler than you imagine!\n\nThe average tweet has a lifespan of about 15 minutes. That’s a very small window for it to gain traction but with Hypefury, you don’t have to worry about that. Hypefury recycles your tweets so more people can engage and interact with you. With Hypefury, the best time to tweet is whenever you feel like it. You worry about the tweets, and we’ll get you the engagement and account growth you want!\n\nCreating great content just isn’t enough to rise on X/Twitter. For your users to care about what you post, you need to build a relationship with them! This takes work, but only so much if you know how to be strategic.\n\nEngage 100x more everyday\n\nYou want to become the next big account on X/Twitter. If you’re already thinking that this will take you way too much time, you’re wrong! In under 30 minutes, you can start on your journey to X/Twitter success. ****\n\nHere is the thing: if you want to grow your X/Twitter account, you don’t just need followers, you need loyal followers from the start. Here’s why:\n\nTheir interaction with your account is going to matter for your account’s growth. Their likes, comments, and retweets are going to get you new followers. Their interaction is super important for your account.\n\nAnd how do you get them to interact with your account and tweets? Here are some of the ways:\n\nDirect Interactions\n\n1. Polls in tweets\n\nConduct polls regularly. I’m not talking about generic polls, but the kind that actually do matter to your followers. Make sure you are conducting polls not to grab attention but for a genuine reason that you and your followers would connect to – consider your niche. Polls need to not only consider your existing audience, but also your non-followers. The goal is for a person to:\n\nLand on your profile page;\n\nRead your bio;\n\nScroll down to watch your pinned tweet, most likely;\n\nCheck if you would be helpful to him/her.\n\nAnd there you have it: you get a new follower!\n\nTip for More Engagement: Make sure the wording of questions and answers is to the point and will be relevant to your followers.\n\nSchedule for this: Prepare your polls in advance once or twice a week.\n\n2. Questions in tweets\n\nAsk questions in your tweets. Don’t do this with the intention to go viral but to genuinely get answers to your questionsfrom your followers and the people on X/Twitter. Even in your questions, be niche-specific and stick to it! That way, you are actually giving out a statement that you belong to this niche – you identify yourself with it. Enable X/Twitter Notifications and make sure to reply to comments as soon as possible; and if the replies you get aren’t in good taste, diffuse the situation with a bit of humor.\n\nTip for More Engagement: Ask the questions which actually do bother your followers and people on X/Twitter in real life. This makes engagement much more likely.\n\nSchedule for this: Find a question for each day.\n\n3. Message your followers\n\nIf anyone follows you, DM them and ask them why did they follow you and what are they expecting from your tweets. Don’t be shy! People are on X/Twitter for value. Build a one-to-one relationship with each of your followers at least for the first 100 ones. Turn on your X/Twitter notifications so that whenever somebody follows you, you can message them. Have a customized message template in place so as not to waste time for the same repetitive actions. Be kind and show some warmth. People are then more likely to interact with your tweets & recommend you to others as well.\n\nTip for More Engagement: Ask your followers these two things.\n\nIf you can help them in some way or other;\n\nIf they have any feedback for your content.\n\nSchedule for this: Have an automated system in-place. When somebody follows you, send them a welcome message. Have a template ready to save time.\n\n4. One-on-One Calls\n\nHave a calendly account and let your followers know about it. Tell them you are free for a brief chat if they can take a 30min break from their day. Out of your conversation, you will figure out the way you can help them, be it on X/Twitter for growth or in their career, and if you realize that you are not the right person for them, you can direct them to someone on X/Twitter in that niche who will be.\n\nTip for More Engagement: If they are growing or trying to grow on X/Twitter, tweet about them after the call. This way, they will become one of your loyal followers.\n\nSchedule for this: You can do this at your convenience but most people would love such calls on weekends. Do not forget to take a screenshot of the call and share it on your feed with the person’s consent.\n\n5. Follow your followers\n\nFollow at least 30% of your followers, engage with their tweets, and let them know you are there. Like and reply to their tweets, and if you think any of those add real value, retweet them. Let these people know in their DMs that this is how you can improve, or just pat their back for their efforts on X/Twitter. It’s not about growing the community or getting the number of followers you wanted, but rather about really making friends online! These are the ones who will like or comment on your tweet when it’s not going viral. And soon, with their help, you will go viral!\n\nTip for More Engagement: Be the first one to start the conversation and interact with people on X/Twitter. People (and X/Twitter) would love you for that!\n\nSchedule for this: Although not absolutely necessary, since you could do this spontaneously or once every couple days, scheduling this tactic could save you some time and energy.\n\nIndirect interactions\n\n6. Pictures & videos in tweets\n\nTweeting a picture of yourself doing whatever your niche thing is can give a huge boost to your followers and many may engage with these kinds of more personal and relatable tweets. If you are comfortable enough doing this, try getting out of your shell and go tweet a video of yours and see the reaction. Make sure you take on any feedback you receive to improve in the future. Pictures and videos don’t have to be strictly personal, however. You could tweet a picture of:\n\na roadmap;\n\na template;\n\na checklist;\n\nan infographic,\n\nwhich is related to your niche and appeals to your audience.\n\nTip for More Engagement: Try posting pictures related to content that would be helpful for your followers.\n\nSchedule for this: Ideally, engage in this tactic once a week, but you can increase to twice a week if you see good engagement.\n\n7. Be an advocate\n\nBe an advocate of something you really believe in, and repeat it as much as possible in a non-intimidating way. In this way, your followers will get to know what you stand for and what it really means to you. For example, if you believe that the future is really about remote work, start talking about it! Tweet about remote working at least a couple of times a day, have the remote work keyword in your bio, on your X/Twitter banner, and also in your pinned tweet. When you are doing this and helping people, the next time a discussion about remote work happens on X/Twitter, your followers will own your opinions and comment on your behalf.\n\nTip for More Engagement: Quantity over Quality, or Quality over Quantity. Stick to one option and go all out!\n\nSchedule for this: You can use this hack almost every day, but do make sure to understand the feedback you get through engagement and adapt accordingly.\n\n8. Help people\n\nTweet your tips, tricks and hacks for productivity. Productivity is something everyone is trying to get better at. Give your followers the necessary motivation once in a while, irrespective of your niche since people are always in dire need of motivation. If they find it in your words, they are going to associate you with this boost in determination! Productivity and motivation are the two specific niches that can be plugged into any other. More importantly, the more people you help, the more people your account is going to reach!\n\nTip for More Engagement: Share your own stories of productivity and motivation. Learn the art of storytelling below 280 characters!\n\nSchedule for this: These kinds of tweets can get you a lot of good engagement, but do not take this technique for granted and overuse it or get too far away from your niche too much.\n\n9. Replying to big accounts\n\nReply to big accounts, agreeing or disagreeing with them, but put your opinion out there and stand by it! This way, not just your followers but many other people will get to know that you are on X/Twitter, and this will intrigue them to click on your profile, thus resulting in another profile visit and, hopefully, another follower. The bigger the audience, the more engagement, the more feedback, and the higher the quality of your tweets.\n\nTip for More Engagement: Find the big accounts in your niche and constantly interact with their tweets.\n\nSchedule for this: Find the best tweets from the best accounts and apply this method. You can do this every day!\n\n10. Interacting with not-so-big accounts\n\nYou will always find some great content from people who are still trying to grow and make their mark on Twitter. Support them, help them in whatever way you can, like their tweets, retweet their content, and have some healthy value-adding discussions. With people like you who don’t have so many followers, you have the convenience of collaborating and trying to figure out content for each other. This will help you in the near future!\n\nTip for More Engagement: Make friends, not followers.\n\nSchedule for this: At your convenience, plan to use this hack a couple of times a day.\n\nHere’s one more tip:\n\nIf you can actively do 2 of these direct interactions and 2 of these indirect interactions every day, which will not take you more than 20 minutes, your engagement will grow 100x from it currently is.\n\nAt least 1000 people will be looking at you, your name, and your niche at least twice in the time they spend on Twitter. If you can do this consistently, it will help you boost your account!\n\nTwitter requires you to be supremely consistent with your content if you are to grow your audience.\n\nThis article will give you insights into the most powerful scheduling and automation tools for Twitter available out there, with which you could save countless hours for yourself! And we will also talk about Twitter marketing software as well\n\nScheduling\n\nAlmost all of us are struggling with consistency, be it in our personal life or at work. Getting consistent enough would allow for most of our processes to get on auto-pilot and make our lives simpler.\n\nOn Twitter, planning your content in advance can help you stay consistent in terms of social media presence.\n\nWe call this kind of planning ‘scheduling.’\n\nScheduling makes you more productive and makes your work easier.\n\nYou can schedule your day, week or month, your quarter or your year. Planning a year-long stream of content would be difficult and near impossible, so find a middle ground between a week and a year: start planning your month!\n\nOn the last day of the month, give yourself the full day to prepare content and schedule it for the upcoming month.\n\nOn every Sunday of that month, you can take time to assess your content’s performance and modify things accordingly for the following week.\n\nCaution:\n\nMake sure to also take some time to understand the way you are positioning yourself with the kind of content you are putting out. With all of this scheduling and content preparation, you might sometimes forget why you started. Take a step back at times to reflect.\n\nThere are countless tools available to help you schedule your content. All of those help you with scheduling but each of them has its unique primary purpose, and it is on you to choose the right tool for the way you work.\n\nTypes of Schedulers\n\nThere are 2 types of schedulers on X/Twitter: Cloud-based schedulers and on-premise schedulers.\n\nCloud-Based Schedulers: Every bit of your content that is scheduled will be hosted on the cloud and it doesn’t matter if your device is switched on or off.\n\nOn-Premise Schedulers: These tools and apps work from your device and you need to make sure to switch on the device from which you’re scheduling.\n\nThe wiser choice is Cloud-Based Schedulers – and among those, why not try Hypefury!\n\nYes, X/Twitter has its own scheduler\n\nThis is something that you can take advantage of. You wake up in the morning, gather your content, and schedule your tweets for the rest of the day. That’s you being productive! However, there are limitations to this way of working.\n\nThe drawback\n\nAlthough you can see a list of tweets scheduled for the day, week, month, or year, you can’t have a proper and precise display of how your content is going out in the next week or month.\n\nThe solution\n\nIn the next section of this guide, you will find a list of scheduler tools you can explore (including Hypefury!). With those, you can schedule a tweet for the 125th day of 2027, for instance, very easily.\n\nSome of these tools are free but, for most of them, you will have a limit on the number of tweets that can be scheduled within a trial period.\n\nLet’s look at what automation looks like and how a tool like Hypefury can help you there as well.\n\nAutomation\n\nThe dictionary defines automation as ‘the technique of making an apparatus, a process, or a system operate automatically.’\n\nHow does automation help?\n\nIt can automatically do tasks like tweeting content for you. This can free up your time to focus on other things, such as developing your X/Twitter platform and promoting your tweets.\n\nAutomation can help you grow your X/Twitter following by helping you find and follow potential new followers. Automating this process can help increase the number of people who are aware of what you’re saying and potentially ready to buy from or contact you.\n\nYou can manage your X/Twitter account more efficiently by scheduling tweets and looking at your X/Twitter analytics. By automating these tasks, you can ensure that all of your tweets are sent at the right time and that they’re being effective in reaching your target audience.\n\nAutomation can help you save money on X/Twitter advertising by automatically targeting ads to potential customers based on their interests. This is a great way to reach a large number of people without spending a lot of money on advertisement campaigns.\n\nYour customer service can be improved by automatically responding to customer inquiries and complaints. By using automation tools, it will be much easier for you to keep track of all customer communication and respond quickly when necessary, which will improve the overall experience for both yourself and those complaining about something!\n\nAll this time saved makes it easier to keep track of what is happening on X/Twitter, stay engaged with your followers, and respond quickly when necessary.\n\nBy using automation tools, you can focus on what matters most – getting your message out there!\n\nGet more email subscribers & more sales\n\nOut of your last 25 tweets, there will be at least one tweet with more engagement than the others. With a tool like Hypefury, you can leverage this as well! Hypefury’s ‘Autoplugs’ auto-comments with your newsletter, course or website below your tweets that do well.\n\nAutoplugs can get you hundreds of new email subscribers and many more sales every single month!\n\nGet more engagement without lifting a finger\n\nHypefury also automatically retweets your best tweets, giving them a second life.\n\nThis allows your tweet to appear on the feeds of new followers, who may like the tweet and thus float it in front of even more eyes, and so on!\n\nIt’s as powerful as it is simple.\n\nWith scheduling and automation, you can get a lot done in less time than expected, allowing you to focus on your content and your connections!"
