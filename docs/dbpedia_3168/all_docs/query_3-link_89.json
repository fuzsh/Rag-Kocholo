SWOT Analysis of Twitter\n\nThe article details prime aspects of the Twitter SWOT analysis. The SWOT analysis of Twitter will enumerate its strengths and weaknesses. The SWOT Analysis is also significant because it will provide valuable information regarding the companyâs future scope and possible threats.\n\nStrengths\n\nSubstantial market value: It is known as the second most popular platform for social media users. In April 2022, the market share of Twitter was 7.13%. The market share of Twitter in Europe is 5.74%. It has the highest share in the USA. In North America, it stands at 8.18%. This social media company has more market share than YouTube, Reddit, Instagram, and Pinterest. Twitter acquired a considerable market share as it entered the market pretty early.\n\nImage of the brand: Twitter entered the field as a micro-blogging site in 2006. It has developed a unique logo, mascot, and color for the brand. It is pretty smooth to recognize, and many celebrities flock to Twitter, making it all the more popular and adding more value to its brand image. Twitter has ranked fourth in the list of most visited websites, according to Finances Online. The iconic bird of the Twitter logo is highly noticeable.\n\nRevenue models: There has been observable diversification to generate revenue. Twitter has engaged in businesses beyond the technology arena, which helped them to diversify the revenue stream.\n\nThe Positive sales taxes included: No matter what you buy, where you buy it from, and how you do that, there is always inclusion of taxes on every product you buy. So, even though consumers have to pay taxes to purchase products from SHEIN, they still have a pretty high sale of products.\n\nPopularity as a Communication platform: It has become almost akin to a mainstream news channel where the official provides updates through Twitter handles. Not just individuals but organizations have their Twitter handles through which they disseminate informational updates. It is easy to send a direct message to the crowd through Twitter. So almost 67% of organizations treat Twitter as a B2-B advertising platform.\n\nWeaknesses\n\nMisuse of information: The users who sign up on the platform provide information, and it is up to Twitter to protect against hacking information and misuse of clientsâ information by sponsors. But information leaks have been observed, and the micro-blogging platform has acknowledged and issued an apology in 2019.\n\nInsufficient Modernization: The platform is necessary for reading quick updates and news, but it is still behind the innovation offered by other social media platforms. There is no process to edit a wrong tweet or spelling errors in a tweet. The only way to resolve mistakes while tweeting is to delete the tweet and post the correct one. The lack of an edit function is a huge negative point when most social media platforms and applications offer users the option to edit their posts. It has led to slower growth as many people are getting bored with the lackluster features of Twitter.\n\nUpgrading the Business Model: Competitors in the field of social media or computer services can easily employ the simplistic business model of Twitter. It is vital to have a system that can integrate end users with vendors or suppliers to grow as a platform. An innovative business model is required to fight against the growing competition.\n\nAccounts without real users: The problem of fake accounts is a pronounced issue on Twitter. Estimates claim that around 5% of active users use spam accounts. The reputation of the social media platform has plummeted due to the high increase in the number of spam activities.\n\nOpportunities\n\nStreaming of videos: It is a huge advantage to have a video streaming feature on Twitter because it already has an excellent database. Competing social media platforms like Facebook also inserted the video streaming option. Moreover, it is necessary to have this feature to bring in more users.\n\nLocal Partnership: Local tie-ups are a great way to augment growth. It is beneficial to build more opportunities in international markets, and working with local companies with expertise in that arena is a great way to create new global processes.\n\nFalse news: Twitter users are often dealing with false information. There is also the issue of abuse and lack of protection of usersâ information. These are burning issues that worry users on the platform, and people are leaving the micro-blogging site to avoid such harassment and complications. The platform needs to alleviate the concerns of the users because, in the end, it is hampering user interaction on this platform.\n\nE-commerce platform: Buying and selling products online is not limited to specific e-commerce sites. Moreover, social media is also part of this e-commerce culture. Twitter can enhance the usersâ engagement with the site by offering a marketplace where users can purchase items. Twitter can become not just a place for interaction but also for making purchases.\n\nThreats\n\nCelebrity exits: There are influencers and celebrities on Twitter that improve brand image and value, but often it has been observed that well-known names have suddenly left Twitter. It results in a loss of fan base, and if the trend continues, it will create a big threat for Twitter as it will reduce their user base.\n\nAdvanced Excise duty: The European Union imposed tax duty as an advanced assessment for technological companies. Twitter is also a tech company and needs to pay the required advance tax, which will impact the companyâs productivity.\n\nThe Powerful competition: Social media is highly influential, and there are quite a few platforms that allow users to interact with others via their platform. Facebook is a potential competitor and has grown magnanimously, and Twitter needs to realize the threat of such a giant social media company. There is a massive difference between the market share of Twitter and Facebook.\n\nLegal threats: The WTO regulations have made the legal processes lengthy and expensive. Twitter is already facing legal actions. Moreover, it can lead to scanty investment in new markets. It will harm the overall growth of Twitter.\n\nTwitter SWOT Analysis Diagram\n\nWith the help of EdrawMax, you can work on the visual side of SWOT analysis.
