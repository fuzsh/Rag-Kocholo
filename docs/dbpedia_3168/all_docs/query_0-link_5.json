        "text": "This is a weekly newsletter about tech, media, and culture. To receive this newsletter in your inbox each week, subscribe here:\n\nToday‚Äôs piece is the fourth (and final) in a series on consumer social platforms.\n\nIf you missed them, here are the pieces on TikTok, Instagram, and Snap:\n\nüéµ Why TikTok Is So Groundbreaking\n\nüõçÔ∏è Instagram‚Äôs Mid-Life Crisis\n\nüëª Snap, Niantic, And Our Augmented Reality Future\n\nTwitter & The Unbundling of News\n\nMark Zuckerberg doesn‚Äôt mince words when it comes to Twitter. Zuckerberg once told friends: ‚ÄúTwitter is such a mess, it‚Äôs as if they drove a clown car into a gold mine and fell in.‚Äù\n\nThat‚Äôs a little harsh, but it‚Äôs also not too far off. Twitter‚Äôs cultural and societal impact is massive‚Äîwhat other platform does the President use 200 times a day? But Twitter consistently fails to capitalize on that impact.\n\nCompare revenue across major consumer social platforms:\n\nTwitter‚Äôs revenue isn‚Äôt commensurate with its value creation. (You can‚Äôt convince me that LinkedIn creates more cultural and societal value than Twitter.) The story is even worse on a per-user basis. Twitter‚Äôs ARPU (Average Revenue Per User) for North America is about $20; Facebook‚Äôs is over twice that. And while Facebook‚Äôs stock is up +570% since its IPO, Twitter‚Äôs stock is trading below where it traded on its IPO day.\n\nThis is a piece about Twitter, but it‚Äôs also a piece about how the Internet changed how we consume and share information online. An alternate title could be ‚ÄúHow the Internet Disrupted News‚Äù. Twitter was both a catalyst of and beneficiary of that shift. But while it creates enormous value, it keeps little of it.\n\nTo understand this, I‚Äôm going to look at:\n\nHow the Internet changed news and Twitter‚Äôs role in it.\n\nWhy Twitter‚Äôs business model needs to change.\n\nThe Unbundling of News\n\nThere‚Äôs some debate about whether Twitter is a social network. Twitter does have a social graph‚Äîyou follow people, and they follow you back‚Äîbut it primarily functions as a content sharing platform. I would argue that Twitter began as a social network in the vein of Facebook and Instagram, but evolved into a content platform more like YouTube and TikTok.\n\nTwo events, both in 2009, marked this shift:\n\nFirst, on January 15, 2009, US Airways Flight 1549 made an emergency landing on the Hudson River. The first report of the incident didn‚Äôt come from a traditional news outlet, but from Twitter:\n\nThe ‚ÄúMiracle on the Hudson‚Äù revealed Twitter‚Äôs true value and purpose. The Internet (and mobile Internet, in particular) was rapidly changing how information could be shared. What used to take a CNN crew could now be done by anyone with a smartphone.\n\nLater in 2009, Twitter switched from asking ‚ÄúWhat are you doing?‚Äù to ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs happening?‚Äù The change in wording was subtle, but important: it positioned Twitter as a site for reporting all of the world‚Äôs news, rather than as a site for reporting what you had for lunch.\n\nTwitter continued to disrupt the old guard. During the Arab Spring, violent protests broke out in Iran. While news of the protests spread around the world on Twitter, CNN was reporting the ‚Äúnews‚Äù that semi-nude photos of Miss California had surfaced online. The hashtag #CNNFail began to trend.\n\nSuddenly, Twitter was the place to share the world‚Äôs information. Twitter‚Äôs retweet feature made it uniquely suited to viral content; content could reach well beyond a user‚Äôs social graph. Facebook and Instagram, in contrast, weren‚Äôt wired for virality.\n\nAshton Kutcher, appearing on The Oprah Winfrey Show, summed up Twitter‚Äôs rise:\n\n‚ÄúThis is a commentary on the state of media. I believe we're at a place now with social media where one person's voice can be as powerful as a media network. That is the power of the social web.‚Äù\n\nIn order to understand the world that Twitter grew up in, it‚Äôs important to digress for a minute to look at how the Internet was changing media.\n\nThe Internet gave everyone a voice. It‚Äôs hard to get your op-ed in The New York Times, but anyone can write online. One out of every three websites in the world is a blog (some 500 million sites) and 2 million blogs are published every day.\n\nWith people getting their news online, the newspaper industry began to crater:\n\nIn its place, a new generation of digital media startups emerged. These startups basically resembled online newspapers: they covered a variety of topics and they still made money through ads. Their ad-based models created a race for ‚Äúclicks‚Äù, with writers using clickbaity headlines to drive eyeballs and, thus, ad revenue. This had the effect of emphasizing quantity over quality.\n\nMost digital media companies from this era struggled‚Äîthey simply didn‚Äôt have the scale to survive on ads. In the words of one editor-in-chief: ‚ÄúEven very well-read stories for large outlets may only generate $75 or $100 in revenue online. Not enough to pay a writer for a day‚Äôs work.‚Äù\n\nThe second generation of digital media startups began to finally unbundle the newspaper and move away from ads:\n\nBy verticalizing, digital media companies could tap into more valuable niche audiences. Many of the companies above eschewed ads in favor of subscription or events, which better mined value from their most engaged customers.\n\nSo where does Twitter fit into all of this? The Internet created an explosion of content; Twitter helps make sense of it. Twitter is online media‚Äôs tool for discovery‚Äîfor finding and acquiring customers.\n\nIn a cover piece for Time magazine, Steven Johnson wrote:\n\n‚ÄúPartially thanks to the move from asking people to talk about their status to talk about what's happening, Twitter has become a pointing device instead of a communications channel: sharing links to longer articles, discussions, posts, videos ‚Äî anything that lives behind a URL. It's just as easy to spread the word about a brilliant 10,000-word New Yorker article as it is to spread the word about your Lucky Charms cereal habit.‚Äù\n\nAs the Internet reinvented media, Twitter became the map by which to chart the new media landscape. But as Twitter grew critical to the value chain of information on the Internet, it failed to capture its opportunity.\n\nJust taking a quick breather to remind you to subscribe if you haven‚Äôt already!\n\nA Long-Overdue Business Model Shift\n\nLet‚Äôs cut straight to the chase: advertising isn‚Äôt the right business model for Twitter. Twitter doesn‚Äôt have the scale for advertising (it has about 10% as many MAUs as Facebook) nor the ad chops (hence its low ARPU).\n\nBut Twitter is unique among social apps in that it has a small portion of users who are very, very engaged. According to Pew Research, the top 10% of Twitter users account for 80% of all tweets:\n\n44% of all Twitter users have never tweeted; of 550 million users that have, half sent their last tweet more than a year ago.\n\nThis skew signals that Twitter can more deeply monetize its power users. It can borrow lessons from other companies on how to do it:\n\nLinkedIn & Discord\n\nConsumer social platforms can be roughly mapped across those primarily for entertainment, and those primarily for utility:\n\nTwitter operates like it‚Äôs built for entertainment, but it‚Äôs built for utility. This puts it in the company of LinkedIn and Discord.\n\nLinkedIn doesn‚Äôt make much money from ads. Most of its revenue comes from subscriptions sold to professional recruiters and from premium plans for power users:\n\nIn arguing that Twitter should follow LinkedIn‚Äôs model, Packy McCormick put it concisely: ‚ÄúOn professional networks, like LinkedIn, most users are the product, but power users are the customers.‚Äù\n\nDiscord is another example. As a chat platform used mostly for gaming, Discord seems at first glance to be built for entertainment. But Discord is mission-critical for gamers, making it a utility product. Discord has a freemium business model and doesn‚Äôt serve ads at all. For $9.99 / month or $99 / year, Discord Nitro users get a variety of premium features beyond the free tier‚Äôs features.\n\nTo Twitter‚Äôs credit, it is (finally) exploring a subscription option. TechCrunch reported a survey of potential features that Twitter sent out and The Verge reported that Twitter listed a job opening for someone to work on subscription.\n\nHere‚Äôs my mock-up of what a pricing plan could look like:\n\nSubstack & The Athletic\n\nSubstack and The Athletic deliver value to customers while also building sustainable, scalable businesses.\n\nSubstack (which is where I write this newsletter) grew 60% in the first three months of the pandemic. The New York Times columnist David Brooks wrote of Substack:\n\nThe next good thing is there are no ads, just subscription revenue. Online writers don‚Äôt have to chase clicks by writing about whatever Trump tweeted 15 seconds ago. They can build deep relationships with the few rather than trying to affirm or titillate the many.\n\nAt TPG, we invested in The Athletic, which is a subscription offering for local sports coverage. The Athletic realized that local sports fans are die-hards and that they‚Äôll pay money for best-in-class sports journalism. The company just hit 1 million subscribers, $60 million in revenue, and a $500 million valuation.\n\nBoth Substack and The Athletic do what the Internet does best‚Äîcarve out deep, lucrative niches‚Äîand both rely on Twitter for discovery.\n\nI recently got this email in my inbox from Substack:\n\nSubstack and The Athletic are creating enormous value for the media ecosystem‚Äîoff of Twitter‚Äôs back‚Äîand they‚Äôre reaping all of the rewards. Twitter reaps nothing.\n\nTwitter needs to earn a share of revenue from the traffic it drives, across the Internet. It can also easily launch a Substack competitor (paywalled long-form writing) and offer media outlets paid placement on dedicated pages for various niches.\n\nIn July, Twitter reported second-quarter ad revenues of $562 million, a 23% decrease year-over-year. Twitter‚Äôs influence is surely greater than it was a year ago; shouldn‚Äôt its revenue reflect that?\n\nA shift away from advertising is happening across the Internet: I‚Äôve written about how Fortnite has a $100 ARPU (over twice Facebook‚Äôs) by monetizing with microtransactions and about how Influencers can now earn money in ways beyond ads. What‚Äôs elegant about business models like Discord‚Äôs, Substack‚Äôs, and The Athletic‚Äôs is that they better align willingness to pay with ability to pay. They allow less value to leak out of the system.\n\nFinal Thought: Digital Darwinism\n\nWhen I think of Twitter, I think of Digital Darwinism. Digital Darwinism is the phenomenon that technology and society evolve faster than an organization can adapt.\n\nThis may just be a nicer way of phrasing Zuckerberg‚Äôs clown car comment. Twitter happened upon a once-in-a-generation shift: the Internet was changing everything about the flow of information. Twitter stumbled into such a massive opportunity that it couldn‚Äôt evolve quickly enough to ride the wave.\n\nBut if Twitter can understand its place in the media ecosystem‚Äîas a wayfinder of sorts for a sea of Internet content‚Äîand if it can pivot to a business model that better serves its most valuable users, it can better align cultural value and financial value. It can begin to capitalize on its potential.\n\nSources & Additional Reading\n\nCheck these out for further reading on this subject:\n\nHatching Twitter by Nick Bilton. I can‚Äôt recommend this book enough. It reads like a novel and is full of incredible reporting.\n\nIf you‚Äôre interested in how the Internet has changed the newspaper industry, Benedict Evans has a good piece on it here.\n\nScott Galloway argues for a Twitter subscription model‚Äîand for lots of media acquisitions‚Äîhere.\n\nPacky McCormick has a good take on Twitter here, including the Bill Gates Line and the ‚ÄúJobs To Be Done‚Äù framework. I especially like Packy‚Äôs point that Twitter messing up Vine may have been a blessing in disguise.\n\nDavid Brooks‚Äô piece on the evolving media landscape: The Future of Nonconformity.\n\nBen Thompson has some great writing on the changing news environment; my favorite is Never-Ending Niches.\n\nFor a deep-dive on how The Athletic got to 1 million subscribers, check out this piece.\n\nThanks for reading!
