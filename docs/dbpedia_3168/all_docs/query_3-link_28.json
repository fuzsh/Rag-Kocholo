        "text": "Tweet News\n\nYou keep up with the news and developments in your field, right? So why not share the latest news with your Twitter followers?\n\nWhen people hear something interesting from you first, it establishes you as someone with their finger on the pulse, someone who knows what’s happening.\n\nBreaking the news helps you establish yourself as an expert in your field – someone people can trust. And people like to do business with people they trust.\n\nYou don’t have to be the first person to find or publish the story – as long as your followers hear it from you first, you’ll get the benefit.\n\nAnnounce Special Offers\n\nReward your followers for their attention, by giving them special offers on Twitter.\n\nPeople like to feel special, and they love to save money – so create a discount or offer that’s exclusively for your Twitter followers.\n\nA time-limited offer also trains your followers to pay attention to your tweets – and rewards them when they do.\n\nShow Behind the Scenes\n\nPeople know the public face of your brand. If you’re doing a good job of advertising and marketing your business, they’re familiar with your logo, your website and your products.\n\nBut it’s always fun to catch a glimpse behind the scenes.\n\nTweeting a photo of your team, or your workplace or some event or forthcoming product is another great way to make your Twitter followers feel special and connected with your brand.\n\nJust be careful not to reveal more than you intended – double-check what’s showing on any screens in the photo – and what’s happening in the background!\n\nUse Images in your Tweets\n\nImages are critical to success on Twitter. There are now so many photos getting posted that tweets without images are easily overlooked.\n\nIn fact, according to Brandwatch.com, tweets with images get 150% more re-tweets, 89% more likes and 18% more clicks than tweets without.\n\nTweets with images get 150% more re-tweets, 89% more likes and 18% more clicks Click To Tweet\n\nSo illustrate your tweets with images – it will make your account much more engaging to visitors.\n\nThree Great Sources for Images you can Tweet\n\nOf course, you can’t just take any image you find on Google Images – you have to respect copyrights and only use images that you have a licence to share.\n\nIdeally, you should create your own original images – but sometimes you just don’t have anything suitable. Don’t worry, here are three wonderful sources of images you can add to your tweets:\n\n1. Unsplash\n\nWith more than 300,000 images and contributions from 50,000 photographers, there’s a wide range of high-quality images available at Unsplash.\n\nSimply go to Buzzsumo.com, enter a subject e.g. Internet Marketing, and Buzzsumo will return the most shared and linked articles on that subject. You can also enter a specific website to see the most shared articles from that site.\n\nBuzzsumo gives you the top few results free of charge. If you search a few different terms, you’ll find plenty worth tweeting, but if you want to go into more depth, you can upgrade to Buzzsumo Pro for a monthly fee.\n\nWhat’s the Perfect Length for a Tweet?\n\nFor years, tweets were limited to 140 characters. This limit was originally introduced to make it easy to fit one tweet into a standard SMS text message.\n\nBut in November 2017, Twitter doubled this limit to 280 characters, after their research showed that users were getting frustrated trying to fit messages into the old limit.\n\nSo what is the perfect length for a tweet – and how does tweet length affect engagement?\n\nThere’s a variety of research – for example:\n\nResearch by Buddy Media shows that tweets with less than 100 characters boost engagement by 17%.\n\nTrackSocial.com has concluded that the perfect length for a tweet is around 100 characters.\n\nResearch by Dan Zarella showed that tweets that include links perform best between 120 – 130 characters.\n\nThe message seems to be that shorter tweets are better for engagement – so even though there’s a new limit – don’t give in to the temptation to use it all!\n\n100 characters is a good rule of thumb – but it’s ok to go a bit longer if you need to, or if you’re including a link.\n\nPeople’s behaviour may change as they get used to seeing longer tweets, so we’ll be keeping an eye out for updated research in this area.\n\nTweet a Controversial Quote From Your Article\n\nRather than just tweeting your article title, scan through it, looking for an interesting or controversial quote.\n\nFor example – don’t tweet: “Dog Training for Spaniels”\n\nTry\n\n“Spaniel owners often neglect basic training and end up with anti-social dogs”\n\nYou might get some feedback from people who don’t agree with you, but you’re much more likely to get re-tweets and engagement with controversial tweets.\n\nTweet a Surprising Fact or Statistic\n\nIf you have any surprising facts or stats in your article – these can be a great thing to tweet, as they get people’s attention, arouse their curiosity, and make them more likely to click through to your article.\n\nAdd a Call to Action\n\nOnline Marketers know that telling someone exactly what you want them to do is the best way to get them to do it.\n\nHaving a clear call to action has been proven to increase response rates, and Twitter is no different. If you want someone to click on your link – tell them:\n\n“Did you know a dog’s sense of smell is 10,000 times better than a human’s? – Find out more…”\n\n“Specially trained diabetes alert dogs can warn their owners that their insulin levels are too low – Find out how they do it…”\n\n“True or False: Dogs have at least 18 muscles in each ear. Guess, then click to find out if you’re right…”\n\nIf you only ever tweet your own content and links to your own website, your followers will probably get bored and unfollow you – or at least tune out your tweets.\n\nThe easiest place to find other things to tweet is on Twitter itself. Scan down your feed, and when you find something that will interest your readers, re-tweet it.\n\nIt only takes a second, and it will make your feed far more interesting to your followers, as well as helping you engage with the people whose tweets you are sharing.\n\nIf you’ve followed a lot of people, you might struggle to find things worth re-tweeting in the noise of your feed. If so, check out the section on Twitter Lists which can help you focus on great sources for re-tweets.\n\nTweet As You Surf\n\nIf you’re anything like me, you probably research and read quite widely in your market. Most days I’ll read some articles and analysis for the niches I’m involved with.\n\nSo while you’re doing that – why not tweet the most interesting articles you find?\n\nIt takes no time at all, and your followers will definitely appreciate your recommendations.\n\nI find that Buffer’s browser plugin is the fastest way to share articles on Twitter, but lots of other scheduling tools and plugins are available.\n\nGet More Clicks\n\nIf you can get more people to click the links in your tweets, that’s more traffic coming to your website.\n\nAccording to data published by Signupto.com, the average Click Through Rate varies between 6.16% for accounts with less than 1,000 followers, down to 0.45% for accounts with more than 10,000 followers.\n\nSo how do you increase the number of people clicking your link?\n\nOne way to get more clicks is to include a call to action in your tweets:\n\n“Check it out!”\n\n“Click to find out more”\n\n“Get your copy today”\n\nDan Zarella found that links near the start of a tweet (about 25% of the way through) get more clicks than links at the end.\n\nTime of Day also has a big influence on CTR according to Signupto.com – with more than 16x as many people clicking through at 6pm, compared to the period between midnight and 6am.\n\n(Infographic courtesy of Signupto.com)\n\nSo make sure you’re tweeting when your audience is awake and available. Tweriod can help you find the best times to tweet.\n\nBe Human\n\nDon’t forget, Twitter is a Social Network, and it’s most effective when it helps people to connect.\n\nOccasionally sharing something personal, rather than just “business stuff” helps to show you’re a real human being, and promotes engagement.\n\nDon’t overdo it and start posting mundane updates like what you’re having for lunch – but when there’s something interesting to share – if you’re getting a new puppy:\n\nor if you’re running a marathon at the weekend, don’t be afraid to let your Twitter followers know.\n\nAs you can see, there are lots of options – here’s how to use them:\n\nWords:\n\nAll of these words: Enter one or more words which must all appear in all the tweets returned (although they may appear in any order).\n\nThis exact phrase: Returns tweets containing all the same words in the same order.\n\nAny of these words: Will return tweets containing at least one of the words you entered, but not necessarily all of them.\n\nNone of these words: Tweets containing any of the words entered here won’t be returned. Ideal for filtering out irrelevant tweets from your results.\n\nThese hashtags: Returns tweets containing ANY of the hashtags entered here. You don’t need to type the # symbol.\n\nWritten in: A chance to choose which language you want returned. Very useful if you’re targeting non-English markets.\n\nPeople:\n\nFrom these accounts: Tweets sent from the accounts you enter here. No need to use the @ symbol. Handy for keeping an eye on competitors.\n\nTo these accounts: Returns replies to the accounts you enter here. Useful for spying on competitors’ conversations, and finding people who engage with competitors – they might be good people to follow or mention to make them aware of you.\n\nMentioning these accounts: Returns tweets that mention one or more of the accounts you enter here. You can use this to quickly check who’s mentioned you, or for competitive research.\n\nPlaces:\n\nNear this place: If you’re running a local business, this is a great filter to add to your search so you can see who’s talking about your market in your local area.\n\nDates:\n\nFrom / to this date: Allows you to see only tweets from a particular time. Most useful to return recent results, and find current conversations you might want to be part of.\n\nIt goes without saying that you can fill in several fields, and combine search criteria to make complex and powerful search queries.\n\nSo for example you could search for all tweets containing the word “Labrador” but not containing the word “Canada” with the hashtag #puppy, in your location last month.\n\nTweet More Often\n\nA question I’m often asked is: How often should I tweet?\n\nAnd the short answer is – It depends on how much you have to say.\n\nThat might sound trite – but there’s a serious point: Tweeting more often is a good thing, but only if quality doesn’t suffer. Your tweets have to be interesting and relevant to your audience, otherwise, people will stop paying attention to you, and you’ll lose followers.\n\nEvery tweet you send that links back to an article on your website is an opportunity for someone to click through – and that’s another visitor.\n\nBut if you only have five articles on your site – there’s a limit to the number of tweets you can send pointing back to those five articles before your followers get bored seeing them.\n\nIf you have 500 articles on your site, then obviously you have a lot more scope for creating different tweets that link to those articles, and you can tweet a lot more often without annoying your audience.\n\nIn either case, I’d suggest not just sending tweets that link back to your own stuff – mix it up by tweeting interesting and relevant news items in your market, links to other people’s best articles and re-tweeting interesting tweets from people you follow.\n\nThat way you’re serving your followers by creating an interesting and balanced feed of information they’ll enjoy – and they’ll be happy for you to tweet more often.\n\nSo – how often?\n\nAim for a minimum of 5 tweets per day – 1 to your own website, and 4 others.\n\nIf you have a larger site, with lots of content, go for 10 tweets per day, perhaps 3 to your own stuff, and 7 others.\n\nOnce you have a very large site, with a huge amount of interesting content to share, you can try increasing these numbers, to 15 or even 20 tweets per day, and see how that affects your traffic and follower count.\n\nIt’s worth testing different approaches – for example, Neil Patel has successfully tested tweeting as often as 40x per day!\n\nBut then Neil has a huge amount of content to share, so what works for him might not work so well for everyone.\n\nIf you’re tweeting many times per day, make sure your tweets are spread out throughout the day, rather than all landing at once. A scheduling tool like Buffer makes this easy.\n\nSend Tweets More than Once\n\nMost people have so many tweets coming in every day, they only see a fraction of them, and that means if you only tweet something once, most of your followers will probably miss it.\n\nSo it’s OK to send a tweet out two or even three times to maximise the number of people who see it.\n\nI don’t recommend doing this for every tweet, as it could become annoying for people who don’t follow many accounts, as they may see every tweet you send.\n\nIf you’re promoting a great new article that you’ve put a lot of effort into, or a special offer, then it makes sense to tweet it several times.\n\nIf you’re nervous about doing this, you might want to use the same link, but change the image, or slightly tweak the text, so each tweet is slightly different.\n\nTake into account how timely the tweet is – a tweet about an event or special offer will have a short life, and you’ll need to tweet it only 2 or 3 times over a short period.\n\nBut if you’re promoting an evergreen article, you could tweet it a lot more often – but over a much longer period of time.\n\nIf you have an active Twitter account, it wouldn’t do any harm to re-send a few of your “Top Tweets” every month or so. Provided they’re high quality, and mixed in with plenty of fresh tweets, it won’t cause any problems.\n\nDon’t forget that if your Twitter account is growing, your newer followers will have missed these tweets the first time around – so they’ll be completely fresh for some people.\n\nPin a Popular Tweet to the Top of your Feed\n\nHave you got a particular tweet that you’d like to be the first thing people see when they visit your Twitter page?\n\nIf so, why not pin it to the top of your feed?\n\nAll you need to do is click on the “down arrow” at the top right of the tweet, and choose “Pin to your profile page” from the menu.\n\nRiteTag will show you the relative popularity of different hashtags so you can target the most popular ones and reach more people.\n\nIt will also show you related hashtags that you might not have considered, as well as data on how often each hashtag is being used, retweeted, used with images etc.\n\nThe basic version of RiteTag with all the information I’ve mentioned is free to use.\n\nTweet Live Coverage from an Industry Event\n\nIf you’re planning to attend a conference, seminar, trade show or product launch that you think many of your Twitter followers would be interested in, then why not live-tweet from the event?\n\nIf the event has an official hashtag – make sure you use it, so that your tweets reach people who are interested in (or attending) the event.\n\nSo what can you tweet from an event? Photos, video, good quotes from speakers or industry figures, answers to questions about the event – there are lots of possibilities.\n\nDon’t forget all your followers will be seeing your tweets – not just other people attending the event, or people who wanted to attend – so try to make sure your tweets provide value to your whole audience.\n\nFollow New People Every Day\n\nOne of the best ways to build your following on Twitter is to follow other people – because some of the people you follow will follow you back.\n\nBut to prevent spammers just following millions of accounts, Twitter limits you to following 1,000 people per day – which is more than enough for legitimate users.\n\nThere’s also a limit on the total number of people you can follow: You’re allowed to follow 5,000 people, and then you’re limited as to how many more people you can follow, based on the ratio between the number of people you’re following and the number of people following you.\n\nFor that reason, you need to think before you follow: You want to build a responsive audience of people who might be interested in what you have to share on Twitter – so don’t follow just anybody. Here are some ideas for groups of people to follow:\n\nFollow people who follow your competitors – they’re more likely to follow back. Simply go to a competitor’s profile, and click on “Followers” to see a list of their followers. Don’t just blindly follow them all though – look for people who’ve uploaded a profile photo – and written a decent description.\n\nCheck out tools like Tweepi and ManageFlitter which can help you find relevant people to follow.\n\nFollow People Who ReTweet Competitors Tweets\n\nPeople who re-tweet your competitors’ tweets, are likely to re-tweet your tweets too – if you can get them to follow you.\n\nSo it makes sense to find these people and follow them – in the hope they’ll follow you back.\n\nHere’s how:\n\nGo to your competitor’s timeline and find an on-topic tweet that’s been re-tweeted\n\nClick on the Tweet to open it in a pop-up window\n\nClick on the XX Retweets link shown:\n\nA list of all the people who’ve re-tweeted this tweet will pop up\n\nFollow some of them.\n\nUnfollow Selectively\n\nSome of the people you follow will follow you back – but many won’t.\n\nEventually, you’ll need to unfollow some people who aren’t following you back, or Twitter will stop you following any more people.\n\nJust look at your “following” list, scroll down to find the oldest ones, and unfollow some of the people who haven’t followed you back.\n\nTools like ManageFlitter or Tweepi can help with this process.\n\nDon’t aggressively follow and unfollow huge numbers of people just to build followers – it’s against Twitter’s terms of service and can get your account suspended or even banned.\n\nBut 5 minutes a day spent managing your following and followers will help you build followers steadily over time.\n\nAdd “Follow Us On Twitter” and “Share This on Twitter” Buttons to your Website\n\nMake sure you have a “Follow Us on Twitter” button clearly shown on your website.\n\nMost website visitors visit once, and never come back. Make it easy for them to follow you on Twitter, and you’ll be able to remind them you exist, and bring them back with interesting tweets and even special offers.\n\nAs well as a button asking people to follow your account, you should make it easy for people to share your best content on Twitter.\n\nIf you add a “Share on Twitter” button to each blog post, it makes it easy for your visitors to share it with their followers – and some of them will want to follow you on Twitter to get more of your great content.\n\nWhen you reply to someone’s tweet (by clicking “Reply” or having their @username as the first thing in your tweet), that will also appear in their notifications tab – even if they’re not following you. But only people who follow you and the person you replied to will see your tweet.\n\nOf course not everyone sees every notification on their account – but Twitter gives you a chance to interact with “big names” who you’d struggle to reach any other way.\n\nJoin Twitter Chats for your Market\n\nA twitter chat is a group that meets at a certain time to discuss a particular topic.\n\nThe host will have chosen a hashtag, and all participants use that hashtag so they can find all the tweets in that chat.\n\nTypically the host will lead the discussion and can ask questions (Q1. Q2. Q3 etc), and participants will respond with their answers labelled (A1. A2. A3).\n\nTwitter chats are a great way to network with others interested in your niche. You should find lots of people with interesting things to say that you’ll want to follow – and if you make a good impression, you’ll usually get some new followers as well.\n\nYou can find twitter chats to participate in by searching Tweet Reports or Twubs.\n\nIf you participate in Twitter Chats regularly, you might want to check out some tools designed for the purpose, such as Tweetchat, although Hootsuite and Tweetdeck are also very useful.\n\nDon’t forget your tweets will be going to all your other followers too – so you might want to tweet a “High Volume Warning” first.\n\nStay positive, don’t get drawn into arguments, and don’t try to spam the chat with your sales pitch – just let your expertise become obvious by adding value to the chat.\n\nHost a Twitter Chat\n\nIf you’re a regular participant in Twitter Chats, the next logical step is hosting one of your own.\n\nYou’ll need to choose the Hashtag – so make it something short and memorable.\n\nIf you’re planning to make your chat a regular feature, then submit it to Twubs, Tweet Reports and any other directories of Twitter Chats – so that people can find you.\n\nYou don’t need to plan a chat in too much detail – they can be quite fluid things – but you should have an outline of the subject you want to focus on, and a few questions to get things going.\n\nBuffer\n\nIt’s important to use a scheduler with Twitter, because dumping 5 or 10 tweets into your timeline at the same time will get a poor response – many people will miss them altogether, and others can be annoyed at getting so many tweets at once.\n\nBut it’s too time-consuming to keep going into Twitter every half hour throughout your day and finding something new to tweet.\n\nBuffer makes it easy to schedule tweets so that they are posted evenly throughout the day, or at the times your audience is most likely to engage with them.\n\nThere are lots of schedulers out there – but Buffer has browser plugins and a streamlined interface that make it really fast and easy to schedule new tweets when you find something worth sharing.\n\nThere’s a free version that supports one account for each of Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn, Instagram and Google+, and will let you schedule 10 posts for each – so you may never need the paid version at all.\n\nhttps://buffer.com\n\nHootsuite\n\nHootsuite is a social media dashboard that will let you manage your accounts on all the most popular social networks.\n\nThe tool is especially good for monitoring the activity on your Twitter account, as you can organise your account into several tabs, so you can see at a glance who has mentioned you in a tweet, you have a tab of messages sent to you, a tab of tweets you have sent, a tab for your favourite sources etc."
