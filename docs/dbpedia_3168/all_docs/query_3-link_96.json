If you want to establish an engaging approach for your audience to share your information and drive the conversation on Twitter, then Twitter Card might be the answer. In this article, we’ll cover what does every marketer or small business owner needs to know about Twitter Cards — their functions, setting up procedures, and strategies to make Twitter cards stand out.\n\nTwitter Card Functions\n\nTwitter cards were developed when Twitter only permitted anyone to tweet 140 characters at a time.

This includes a title, description, thumbnail image, Twitter account attribution, and a direct link to the content.\n\nSummary Card with Large Image\n\nA Summary card with a large image is intended to provide the reader with a rich visual experience, with the visitor being sent to your website by clicking on the image. This includes a huge, full-width significant picture alongside a tweet. Summary Cards are an excellent method to promote testimonials on your website, highlight new blog posts or share articles, and present a new deal on your items.\n\nPlayer Card\n\nA Player card allows your viewers to see, listen to, or click through your media without having to leave Twitter. Player Cards automatically play videos on timelines and feeds so users don’t have to leave the app to interact with rich media, and your content receives more views.\n\nPlayer Cards improve your brand’s visibility by promoting it to a large audience. Take a look at this example below on how YouTube card allows users to watch a YouTube video while remaining within Twitter.\n\nApp Card\n\nThe App Card is a terrific method to showcase mobile apps on Twitter and encourage people to download them.

These meta tags are used to describe the card type and username of the website. Twitter offers guide documentation on how to do this, with the code all set for you to plug your information into.\n\nHere are the most commonly used Meta tags in all Twitter Card types:\n\ntwitter: card – The card type to use, which will be one of “summary”, “summary_large_image”, “app”, or “player”.\n\ntwitter: site – The @username for the website used in the card footer.\n\ntwitter: title – The title as it should display in the Twitter Card with maximum of 70 characters.\n\ntwitter:description – The description of content with maximum 200 characters.\n\ntwitter:image – The URL of the image to use in the card.
