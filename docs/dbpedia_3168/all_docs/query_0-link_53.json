        "text": "Twitter is all about doing a lot with a little. Even with its recently doubled character count, brevity is the name of the game. The most successful Twitter brands are the ones that deliver their message in a way that’s sharp, focused and valuable.\n\nAnd the stakes are high. A poor tweet game means your feed will sink into oblivion – or worse, become a meme for all the wrong reasons. Getting it right builds reach, trust and brand equity.\n\nBut don’t worry. Your followers want you to succeed. 93% of users who follow your business on Twitter plan to buy from you – and many already have. They’re also open to spreading the word about your business: about a third of users have retweeted a business tweet in the past.\n\nHere’s how to tweet your way to virality.\n\nEvery Tweet is a Mini PR & Media Release\n\n74% of Twitter users use the network to get their news. And some 2 billion search queries are served through the site daily. That means that you have two audiences: the “feed” audience, and the “search” audience.\n\nHere’s how to deliver value to both.\n\nThink of every tweet as a mini media release. You need to serve up key information at a glance in a way that’s compelling, informative and actionable. Before putting thumb to touchpad, know what you want to say and what you want to achieve.\n\nThe perfect tweet is:\n\nFront loaded. Put the most important words at the start of the tweet to catch a follower’s eye.\n\nScannable. Write simply and concisely. You want followers to “get” it first go.\n\nSpecific. Make your content valuable and useful. Make it matter to your followers.\n\nActive. Use strong verbs and skip the adjectives and adverbs.\n\nFocused. Limit yourself to one idea per tweet. The rest can go in a blog post.\n\nCompelling. Give followers a reason to click through. Clickbait headlines work for a reason!\n\nShort. You may have 280 characters now, but you don’t have to use them all!\n\nOn brand. Your tweets should sound like you. Re-read to check you’re on brand.\n\nCrafting Irresistible Tweet Content\n\nSo now you know what your tweet should look like – and do. But what types of content get the best reactions from your followers? Here are a few tweet types that beg to be retweeted.\n\nMedia tweets. Images, videos, and gifs stand out on a timeline. Use them!\n\nStats and figures. Tips, statistics, and facts engage while delivering value.\n\nQuestions! Asking a question positions your followers as experts and gets them to chime in.\n\nQuotes. Everyone loves to hear from a thought leader. Use quotes to drum up interest.\n\nJokes. If your brand allows for it, jokes get good traction. Just exercise good judgment.\n\nLike if “no”, retweet if “yes”. Twitter lets you do polls, but this format encourages sharing.\n\nHashtags. Capture the search audience or create your own branded “chatroom” with a hashtag.\n\nTry a thread. Have more to say on a topic? Do it piecemeal with a Twitter thread.\n\nLeave them wanting more. “Find out”, “See why” and “Here’s how” are great ways to encourage click-throughs. Give it a try!\n\nTiming matters. You might have written the perfect tweet, but if it goes out at the wrong time it’ll get lost in the noise.\n\nInspired to write a tweet for the ages? Go forth and make it happen!\n\nNeed some help building your social media presence and strategy?
