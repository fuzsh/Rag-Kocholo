        "text": "Social media networking giant Twitter have announced the impending launch of a new function ‘Twitter Communities’, and the impending feature could unlock a wealth of opportunities for the membership sector to better connect about topics and conversations online.\n\nThe MemberWIse Network’s Digital Excellence 2021/22 Report* evidences an increase in adoption of online communities by the sector (from 29% in 2018 to 41% this year – up 12%), so perhaps membership organisations/associations should consider this new free resource.\n\nThe platform is following in the footsteps of LinkedIn and Facebook, who have seen incredible growth and success of their ‘groups’ function. Many of our association clients have developed strong online communities using these tools, connecting members and sharing information and knowledge in a more accessible and casual online group setting.\n\nTwitter promises the combination of tagged topics with closed group interaction, applying a strong discussion focus and inviting topical streams in an expert environment. This is especially poignant and potentially very valuable to the membership sector as a tool to unite professionals in a ‘safe’ space to share opinion and provide exceptional raw insight into how members view the industry, the association and the world.\n\nEarly stages, big changes\n\nThe roll out of this new feature is happening gradually, with only select groups being launched under the moderation of Twitter, however it is expected that the Twitter Communities function will be widely available in the coming months. The introduction of Communities is a bold move for the platform that has remaining largely unchanged for ten years.\n\nAlthough limited for now, eventually communities will be user generated, but Twitter is launching an initial batch that centre on less politically-charged yet popular topics including: weather, dogs, footwear and astrology. Although in its campaigning, Twitter features Cryptocurrency and black female photographers.\n\nSo how can I apply to start a community?\n\nTwitter is accepting applications to start communities here.\n\nUsers must be eligible and meet certain criteria and there will need to be appointed moderators to monitor and ensure compliance within the community. You will need to consider how a Twitter community would be of benefit to your members, and the resources required to ensure the content and conversation is relevant and aligned with the purposes of the group and your association.\n\nUnlike in a Facebook Group, Twitter says that anyone will be able to read, report and quote content posted in a community, without being a member. Twitter is currently testing methods of moderation and removal of non-compliant communities as part of the initial phase of launch.\n\nWe’re already using Facebook and LinkedIn Groups, how is this different?\n\nThe premise of Twitter Communities is to unite people about conversation streams already happening. Which means communities and streams are discoverable under relevant hashtags. Used correctly, Twitter Communities could be integral to discovering new members online and demonstrating authority and opinion on subjects stirring your sector.\n\nUnlike closed groups, Communities will enable people from outside to view content and conversations. But with added freedom and added exposure comes elevated risk. Which is why stringent moderation and close monitoring will be essential in ensuring conversation is relevant and appropriate.\n\nWe have invested in a Private Online Community Platform, should we now consider this option as a replacement?\n\nWe spoke to MemberWise Network Founder, Rich Gott, and his answer was a short and sharp “No”. We asked him why this was so, and he explained:\n\n‘The functionality, personalisation, measurement and control a private member community provides for associations can’t really be compared with these free tools (provided by many of the major free online social networks). However, if a membership organisation doesn’t yet host an online community, it may be something to trial/pilot to see if community (as a concept) works as a member benefit.”\n\nWatch this space for you and your members\n\nThe platform that currently serves as a tool to share breaking news and trigger public conversation is changing, to create features to help users discover people and conversations important to them. It could be the perfect way to place your association or membership organisation at the heart of a topic or industry in the coming months and a key tool to help new members discover you, and you discover new groups of potential interest. The platform for projection could soon become a platform for connection.\n\n*Digital Excellence Report 2021/22 is statistically significant and available to download via the MemberWise website – https://memberwise.org.uk/dx2021research/"
