We’re moving a 600 kilos robot, and we’re driving that robot with an Elmo motor controller smaller than a playing card.”\n\nDuncan Mclennan\n\nProduct Manager, Avidbots\n\n“12 Elmo Twitter modules used for controlling. Elmo was the only one offering a small servo and EtherCAT bus control. Thanks to Elmo, having several articulations working simultaneously over a bus was easy!”\n\nFabien Expert\n\nDir. Mechatronics, Wandercraft\n\n“Our robot must be able to work at full speed with humans in its network. Thanks to Elmo who developed the “Safe Absolute Torque” feature, Wyzo robot is fast as a high-speed delta robot and safe as a collaborative robot.”\n\nChristian Vouillamoz\n\nCTO, Wyzo"
