Central to Web 3 projects is the demand for efficient communication and community engagement, which social media platforms have effectively addressed. Among these platforms, Twitter has become a critical component of the Web 3 environment by facilitating smooth communication, fostering community development, and promoting the adoption of cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology.\n\nIn this article, we will explore the significant role of Twitter in Web 3 projects. We will delve into the ways Twitter serves as a communication channel, fosters community building and engagement, and contributes to influencer marketing and thought leadership in the Web 3 space. Furthermore, we will examine Twitter's impact on crypto and blockchain adoption, including its role in providing news and market updates, announcing token launches and airdrops, and influencing market sentiment.\n\nTwitter's Influence in Web 3 Projects\n\nTwitter as a Communication Channel\n\nTwitter serves as a powerful communication channel within Web 3 projects, facilitating real-time and decentralized information exchange. Its concise and immediate nature makes it ideal for sharing updates, announcements, and insights related to blockchain, AI, and cryptocurrencies.\n\nReal-time Updates: Twitter's fast-paced nature allows project teams and community members to share and receive instant updates on Web 3 developments, including project milestones, partnerships, and technical advancements.\n\nDecentralized Platform: Twitter's decentralized nature aligns with the principles of Web 3, where power and control are distributed. It provides a level playing field for communication, enabling anyone to participate and contribute to the discourse.\n\nFluid Information Exchange: Twitter's brevity and simplicity encourage concise discussions and the sharing of valuable resources. Threads and replies allow for in-depth conversations, fostering a dynamic and fluid exchange of ideas.\n\nCommunity Building and Engagement\n\nTwitter plays a vital role in community building and engagement for Web 3 projects, providing a platform for like-minded individuals to connect, share knowledge, and collaborate.\n\nHashtags and Mentions: Twitter's use of hashtags allows users to tag relevant keywords, making it easier to discover and engage with specific Web 3 topics. Mentions enable direct communication and networking with project teams, influencers, and thought leaders.\n\nPolls, Threads, and Spaces: Twitter's features like polls enable community members to express opinions and gather feedback. Threads facilitate the organization of complex discussions, while Spaces provide an interactive audio experience for hosting live conversations and AMAs (Ask Me Anything) sessions.\n\nNetworking Opportunities: Twitter serves as a virtual gathering place for Web 3 enthusiasts, developers, investors, and industry professionals. Engaging in discussions and following influential voices can lead to valuable connections and collaboration opportunities.\n\nInfluencer Marketing and Thought Leadership\n\nTwitter has become a hub for influential figures and thought leaders in the Web 3 space, shaping opinions and driving conversations around blockchain, AI, and cryptocurrencies.\n\nInfluence on Project Perception: Influencers on Twitter possess the ability to amplify the reach and visibility of Web 3 projects. Their endorsements, opinions, and insights can significantly impact project perception, attracting attention from potential users, investors, and partners.\n\nKnowledge Sharing and Education: Influencers and thought leaders often share educational content, tutorials, and resources on Twitter, making it a valuable platform for learning about Web 3 technologies and their potential applications.\n\nTwitter's influence in Web 3 projects extends beyond communication and community engagement. In the next section, we will explore its role in driving crypto and blockchain adoption, providing news and market updates, and influencing market sentiment.\n\nTwitter's Role in Crypto and Blockchain Adoption\n\nTwitter plays a significant role in providing real-time news and market updates within the crypto and blockchain industry. It serves as a valuable source of information for investors, enthusiasts, and project teams.\n\nTimely Information Dissemination: Twitter's fast-paced nature allows for the immediate sharing of news related to cryptocurrencies, blockchain technology, regulatory developments, and market trends. Users can follow relevant accounts and hashtags to stay informed about the latest updates.\n\nBreaking News and Announcements: Twitter often becomes the go-to platform for project teams and industry leaders to make important announcements. Token listings, partnerships, product launches, and regulatory decisions are often first revealed on Twitter, providing real-time updates to the community.\n\nToken Announcements and Airdrops\n\nTwitter serves as a platform for token announcements and airdrops, creating opportunities for crypto projects to engage with their communities and distribute tokens.\n\nToken Launches: Many projects utilize Twitter to announce token launches, providing details about token distribution, tokenomics, and token sale events. This enables projects to reach a wide audience and generate interest in their tokens.\n\nAirdrop Campaigns: Airdrops, where free tokens are distributed to community members, are often promoted and coordinated through Twitter. This approach helps projects bootstrap their communities, increase token adoption, and generate awareness.\n\nInfluencing Market Sentiment\n\nTwitter has a significant impact on shaping market sentiment and influencing cryptocurrency prices. Tweets from influential figures can create both positive and negative effects on the market.\n\nInfluencer Effect. Influential individuals, including prominent industry figures and celebrities, have the power to sway market sentiment through their tweets. Positive endorsements or negative remarks can lead to increased buying or selling activity, affecting cryptocurrency prices.\n\nMarket Analysis and Predictions. Twitter serves as a platform for experts and analysts to share their market analysis, price predictions, and trading strategies. These insights contribute to market sentiment and influence investor decisions.\n\nTrend Identification. Twitter's trending topics and hashtags provide valuable insights into the most discussed cryptocurrencies, blockchain projects, and market trends. Monitoring these trends can help investors stay informed and identify potential investment opportunities.\n\nTwitter's role in crypto and blockchain adoption extends beyond communication and community engagement. In the next section, we will address challenges and considerations associated with using Twitter for Web 3 projects.\n\nChallenges and Considerations in Using Twitter for Web 3 Projects\n\nWhile Twitter offers significant benefits for Web 3 projects, there are also challenges and considerations that project teams should be aware of. These factors can impact the effectiveness and sustainability of utilizing Twitter as a communication and engagement platform.\n\nCensorship and Centralization Concerns\n\nCentralized Platform\n\nContent Moderation\n\nBuilding Resilient Communities\n\nDependency Risk\n\nDecentralized Alternatives\n\nBy understanding these challenges and considerations, Web 3 projects can develop strategies to overcome them. And eventually: build resilient communities that are not solely reliant on Twitter. This ensures the long-term sustainability and independence of their communication and engagement efforts.\n\nConclusion\n\nIn Web 3 projects, Twitter holds a crucial position. It is a potent communication medium that promotes community formation, engagement, and the adoption of cryptocurrency and blockchain technology. Through real-time updates and fostering connections between individuals with similar interests, Twitter sets the stage for industry leaders to guide discussions. Nonetheless, obstacles such as censorship and centralization issues emphasize the importance of creating strong communities for Web 3 projects and investigating decentralized options. By capitalizing on Twitter's advantages while keeping these concerns in mind, Web 3 initiatives can efficiently utilize the platform to flourish within the decentralized tech sphere.

Game theory allows for designing incentive-machines that can't be turned-off and resemble artificial life.\n\nEmergent Optimization\n\nGame theory provides a robust framework for analyzing strategic interactions with mathematical models, which is particularly useful in blockchain environments where multiple stakeholders interact within a set of predefined rules. By applying this framework to token systems, developers can design systems that influence the emergent behaviors of network participants. This ensures the stability and effectiveness of the ecosystem.\n\nBonding Curves\n\nBonding curves are tool used in token design to manage the relationship between price and token supply predictably. Essentially, a bonding curve is a mathematical curve that defines the price of a token based on its supply. The more tokens that are bought, the higher the price climbs, and vice versa. This model incentivizes early adoption and can help stabilize a token’s economy over time.\n\nFor example, a bonding curve could be designed to slow down price increases after certain milestones are reached, thus preventing speculative bubbles and encouraging steadier, more organic growth.\n\nThe Case of Bitcoin\n\nBitcoin’s design incorporates game theory, most notably through its consensus mechanism of proof-of-work (PoW). Its reward function optimizes for security (hashrate) by optimizing for maximum electricity usage. Therefore, optimizing for its legitimate goal of being secure also inadvertently optimizes for corrupting natural environment. Another emergent outcome of PoW is the creation of mining pools, that increase centralization.\n\nThe Paperclip Maximizer and the dangers of blockchain economy\n\nWhat’s the connection between AI from the story and decentralized economies? Blockchain-based incentive systems also can’t be turned off. This means that if we design an incentive system that optimizes towards a wrong objective, we might be unable to change it. Bitcoin critics argue that the PoW consensus mechanism optimizes toward destroying planet Earth.\n\nLayer 2 Solutions\n\nLayer 2 solutions are built on the understanding that the security provided by this core kernel of certainty can be used as an anchor. This anchor then supports additional economic mechanisms that operate off the blockchain, extending the utility of public blockchains like Ethereum. These mechanisms include state channels, sidechains, or plasma, each offering a way to conduct transactions off-chain while still being able to refer back to the anchored security of the main chain if necessary.\n\nConceptual Example of State Channels\n\nState channels allow participants to perform numerous transactions off-chain, with the blockchain serving as a backstop in case of disputes or malfeasance.\n\nConsider two players, Alice and Bob, who want to play a game of tic-tac-toe with stakes in Ethereum. The naive approach would be to interact directly with a smart contract for every move, which would be slow and costly. Instead, they can use a state channel for their game.\n\nOpening the Channel: They start by deploying a \"Judge\" smart contract on Ethereum, which holds the 1 ETH wager. The contract knows the rules of the game and the identities of the players.\n\nPlaying the Game: Alice and Bob play the game off-chain by signing each move as transactions, which are exchanged directly between them but not broadcast to the blockchain. Each transaction includes a nonce to ensure moves are kept in order.\n\nClosing the Channel: When the game ends, the final state (i.e., the sequence of moves) is sent to the Judge contract, which pays out the wager to the winner after confirming both parties agree on the outcome.\n\nA threat stronger than the execution\n\nIf Bob tries to cheat by submitting an old state where he was winning, Alice can challenge this during a dispute period by submitting a newer signed state. The Judge contract can verify the authenticity and order of these states due to the nonces, ensuring the integrity of the game. Thus, the mere threat of execution (submitting the state to the blockchain and having the fraud exposed) secures the off-chain interactions.\n\nGame Theory in Practice\n\nUnderstanding the application of game theory within blockchain and token ecosystems requires a structured approach to analyzing how stakeholders interact, defining possible actions they can take, and understanding the causal relationships within the system. This structured analysis helps in creating effective strategies that ensure the system operates as intended.\n\nStakeholder Analysis\n\nIdentifying Stakeholders\n\nThe first step in applying game theory effectively is identifying all relevant stakeholders within the ecosystem. This includes direct participants such as users, miners, and developers but also external entities like regulators, potential attackers, and partner organizations. Understanding who the stakeholders are and what their interests and capabilities are is crucial for predicting how they might interact within the system.\n\nAssessing Incentives and Capabilities\n\nEach stakeholder has different motivations and resources at their disposal. For instance, miners are motivated by block rewards and transaction fees, while users seek fast, secure, and cheap transactions. Clearly defining these incentives helps in predicting how changes to the system’s rules and parameters might influence their behaviors.\n\nDefining Action Space\n\nPossible Actions\n\nThe action space encompasses all possible decisions or strategies stakeholders can employ in response to the ecosystem's dynamics. For example, a miner might choose to increase computational power, a user might decide to hold or sell tokens, and a developer might propose changes to the protocol.\n\nConstraints and Opportunities\n\nUnderstanding the constraints (such as economic costs, technological limitations, and regulatory frameworks) and opportunities (such as new technological advancements or changes in market demand) within which these actions take place is vital. This helps in modeling potential strategies stakeholders might adopt.\n\nCausal Relationships Diagram\n\nMapping Interactions\n\nCreating a diagram that represents the causal relationships between different actions and outcomes within the ecosystem can illuminate how complex interactions unfold. This diagram helps in identifying which variables influence others and how they do so, making it easier to predict the outcomes of certain actions.\n\nAnalyzing Impact\n\nBy examining the causal relationships, developers and system designers can identify critical leverage points where small changes could have significant impacts. This analysis is crucial for enhancing system stability and ensuring its efficiency.\n\nFeedback Loops\n\nUnderstanding feedback loops within a blockchain ecosystem is critical as they can significantly amplify or mitigate the effects of changes within the system. These loops can reinforce or counteract trends, leading to rapid growth or decline.\n\nReinforcing Loops\n\nReinforcing loops are feedback mechanisms that amplify the effects of a trend or action. For example, increased adoption of a blockchain platform can lead to more developers creating applications on it, which in turn leads to further adoption. This positive feedback loop can drive rapid growth and success.\n\nDeath Spiral\n\nConversely, a death spiral is a type of reinforcing loop that leads to negative outcomes. An example might be the increasing cost of transaction fees leading to decreased usage of the blockchain, which reduces the incentive for miners to secure the network, further decreasing system performance and user adoption. Identifying potential death spirals early is crucial for maintaining the ecosystem's health.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe fundamental advantage of token-based systems is being able to reward desired behavior. To capitalize on that possibility, token engineers put careful attention into optimization and designing incentives for long-term growth.\n\nFAQ\n\nWhat does game theory contribute to blockchain token design?\n\nGame theory optimizes blockchain ecosystems by structuring incentives that reward desired behavior.\n\nHow do bonding curves apply game theory to improve token economics?\n\nBonding curves set token pricing that adjusts with supply changes, strategically incentivizing early purchases and penalizing speculation.\n\nWhat benefits do Layer 2 solutions provide in the context of game theory?\n\nLayer 2 solutions leverage game theory, by creating systems where the threat of reporting fraudulent behavior ensures honest participation.\n\nToken Engineering is an emerging field that addresses the systematic design and engineering of blockchain-based tokens. It applies rigorous mathematical methods from the Complex Systems Engineering discipline to tokenomics design.\n\nIn this article, we will walk through the Token Engineering Process and break it down into three key stages. Discovery Phase, Design Phase, and Deployment Phase.\n\nDiscovery Phase of Token Engineering Process\n\nThe first stage of the token engineering process is the Discovery Phase. It focuses on constructing high-level business plans, defining objectives, and identifying problems to be solved. That phase is also the time when token engineers first define key stakeholders in the project.\n\nDefining the Problem\n\nThis may seem counterintuitive. Why would we start with the problem when designing tokenomics? Shouldn’t we start with more down-to-earth matters like token supply? The answer is No. Tokens are a medium for creating and exchanging value within a project’s ecosystem. Since crypto projects draw their value from solving problems that can’t be solved through TradFi mechanisms, their tokenomics should reflect that.\n\nThe industry standard, developed by McKinsey & Co. and adapted to token engineering purposes by Outlier Ventures, is structuring the problem through a logic tree, following MECE.\n\nMECE stands for Mutually Exclusive, Collectively Exhaustive. Mutually Exclusive means that problems in the tree should not overlap. Collectively Exhaustive means that the tree should cover all issues.\n\nIn practice, the “Problem” should be replaced by a whole problem statement worksheet. The same will hold for some of the boxes.\n\nA commonly used tool for designing these kinds of diagrams is the Miro whiteboard.\n\nIdentifying Stakeholders and Value Flows in Token Engineering\n\nThis part is about identifying all relevant actors in the ecosystem and how value flows between them. To illustrate what we mean let’s consider an example of NFT marketplace. In its case, relevant actors might be sellers, buyers, NFT creators, and a marketplace owner. Possible value flow when conducting a transaction might be: buyer gets rid of his tokens, seller gets some of them, marketplace owner gets some of them as fees, and NFT creators get some of them as royalties.\n\nIncentive Mechanisms Canvas\n\nThe last part of what we consider to be in the Discovery Phase is filling the Incentive Mechanisms Canvas. After successfully identifying value flows in the previous stage, token engineers search for frictions to desired behaviors and point out the undesired behaviors. For example, friction to activity on an NFT marketplace might be respecting royalty fees by marketplace owners since it reduces value flowing to the seller.\n\nDesign Phase of Token Engineering Process\n\nThe second stage of the Token Engineering Process is the Design Phase in which you make use of high-level descriptions from the previous step to come up with a specific design of the project. This will include everything that can be usually found in crypto whitepapers (e.g. governance mechanisms, incentive mechanisms, token supply, etc). After finishing the design, token engineers should represent the whole value flow and transactional logic on detailed visual diagrams. These diagrams will be a basis for creating mathematical models in the Deployment Phase.\n\nObjective Function\n\nEvery crypto project has some objective. The objective can consist of many goals, such as decentralization or token price. The objective function is a mathematical function assigning weights to different factors that influence the main objective in the order of their importance. This function will be a reference for machine learning algorithms in the next steps. They will try to find quantitative parameters (e.g. network fees) that maximize the output of this function.\n\nModified Metcalfe’s Law can serve as an inspiration during that step. It’s a framework for valuing crypto projects, but we believe that after adjustments it can also be used in this context.\n\nDeployment Phase of Token Engineering Process\n\nThe Deployment Phase is final, but also the most demanding step in the process. It involves the implementation of machine learning algorithms that test our assumptions and optimize quantitative parameters. Token Engineering draws from Nassim Taleb’s concept of Antifragility and extensively uses feedback loops to make a system that gains from arising shocks.\n\nAgent-based Modelling\n\nIn agent-based modeling, we describe a set of behaviors and goals displayed by each agent participating in the system (this is why previous steps focused so much on describing stakeholders). Each agent is controlled by an autonomous AI and continuously optimizes his strategy. He learns from his experience and can mimic the behavior of other agents if he finds it effective (Reinforced Learning). This approach allows for mimicking real users, who adapt their strategies with time. An example adaptive agent would be a cryptocurrency trader, who changes his trading strategy in response to experiencing a loss of money.\n\nMonte Carlo Simulations\n\nToken Engineers use the Monte Carlo method to simulate the consequences of various possible interactions while taking into account the probability of their occurrence. By running a large number of simulations it’s possible to stress-test the project in multiple scenarios and identify emergent risks.\n\nTestnet Deployment\n\nIf possible, it's highly beneficial for projects to extend the testing phase even further by letting real users use the network. Idea is the same as in agent-based testing - continuous optimization based on provided metrics. Furthermore, in case the project considers airdropping its tokens, giving them to early users is a great strategy. Even though part of the activity will be disingenuine and airdrop-oriented, such strategy still works better than most.\n\nTime Duration\n\nToken engineering process may take from as little as 2 weeks to as much as 5 months. It depends on the project category (Layer 1 protocol will require more time, than a simple DApp), and security requirements. For example, a bank issuing its digital token will have a very low risk tolerance.\n\nRequired Skills for Token Engineering\n\nToken engineering is a multidisciplinary field and requires a great amount of specialized knowledge. Key knowledge areas are:\n\nSystems Engineering\n\nMachine Learning\n\nMarket Research\n\nCapital Markets\n\nCurrent trends in Web3\n\nBlockchain Engineering\n\nStatistics\n\nSummary\n\nThe token engineering process consists of 3 steps: Discovery Phase, Design Phase, and Deployment Phase. It’s utilized mostly by established blockchain projects, and financial institutions like the International Monetary Fund. Even though it’s a very resource-consuming process, we believe it’s worth it. Projects that went through scrupulous design and testing before launch are much more likely to receive VC funding and be in the 10% of crypto projects that survive the bear market. Going through that process also has a symbolic meaning - it shows that the project is long-term oriented.\n\nIf you're looking to create a robust tokenomics model and go through institutional-grade testing please reach out to contact@nextrope.com.

Each of these stages should be tailored to the specific needs of a project.\n\nIs token engineering meant only for big projects?\n\nWe recommend that even small projects go through a simplified design and optimization process. This increases community's trust and makes sure that the tokenomics doesn't have any obvious flaws.\n\nHow long does the token engineering process take?\n\nIt depends on the project and may range from 2 weeks to 5 months."
