        "text": "In nearly five years as President of Coppin State University, Dr. Jenkins has not only deepened Coppin’s community engagement, but he has also expanded its academic portfolio, elevated its national brand, and achieved historic milestones in fundraising, student-retention, graduation rates, fundraising, endowment growth, corporate partnerships, alumni giving, and increased enrollment - a reversal of a 12-year enrollment decline. He launched the Presidential Scholarship as well as other crucial initiatives such as Expand Eagle Nation, Coppin Food Pantry, the President and First Lady’s Closet and the Eagle Achievement Center. Under his leadership, for the third consecutive year, Coppin State has claimed the highest student-athlete graduation rate in the MEAC and is home to the reigning MEAC baseball and volleyball champions.\n\n“I am honored to be recognized by the Baltimore Business Journal. This award is a testament to the collective hard work and dedication of our entire university community. It is a privilege to lead Coppin State University, Baltimore’s hometown university, committed to affordability, innovation, upward economic mobility, and student success,” said President Anthony L. Jenkins.\n\nPresident Jenkins will be formally recognized at the Power 10 Awards Ceremony on Thursday, September 12, where he will join other esteemed honorees from various sectors across the city."
