        "text": "Your trademark won’t register if it’s only used as the title of a single creative work. However, if your trademark is the name or title of a series of creative works, it may register. You need to provide evidence that shows the title is being used for the entire series, not just one creative work in the series.\n\nFor example, the book title \"The Tipping Point\" identifies a single book and the film title \"The Manchurian Candidate\" identifies a single movie. However, C.S. Lewis’ \"The Chronicles of Narnia\" books, National Public Radio’s \"All Things Considered\" radio programs, and \"The Twilight Saga\" films are each a series because they identify more than one creative work under that name.\n\nSimilarly, your trademark won’t register if it’s only used as a portion of a title of a single creative work. For example, the title portion \"The Magic School Bus\" that’s in the book title \"The Magic School Bus: Going on a Field Trip\" is considered a portion of a title. But, a portion of a title of a single creative work may be registerable if the name of a portion of a title:\n\nIdentifies that the title portion is being used for a series of creative works;\n\nCreates a commercial impression that’s different from the complete title; and\n\nIs promoted and recognized as a source-indicator for the series.\n\nFor more information, see TMEP section 1202.08.\n\nDefinition of a single creative work\n\nA single creative work is one, individual work in which the content does not change significantly, whether that work is in printed, recorded, or electronic form; provided live on stage or in a live performance, or merely translated into different languages.\n\nExamples:\n\nA single book in all media formats\n\nA single book provided in English- and Spanish-language versions\n\nA single sound recording, downloadable song, downloadable ring tone, DVD, and audio CD\n\nA single film or movie\n\nA single creative work issued in sections or chapters\n\nA single creative work that uses the same title in different media formats (e.g., a printed and electronic book) or on unabridged and abridged versions of the same work\n\nTheatrical performances such as a play, musical, opera, or similar production\n\nA single radio or television episode\n\nFor more information, see TMEP section 1202.08(a).\n\nDefinition of a series of creative works\n\nGenerally, a series of creative works is a type of work in which the content changes significantly with each edition, issue, or performance.\n\nExamples:\n\nPeriodically issued publications such as magazines, newsletters, comic books, comic strips, guide books, and printed classroom materials\n\nA book with a second or subsequent edition in which the content changes significantly (such as a jacket cover for a cookbook that states it’s \"new and revised\")\n\nLive performances by musical bands\n\nTelevision and radio series\n\nMovies and films that are provided as a series\n\nEducational seminars\n\nComputer software and computer games\n\nColoring books and activity books\n\nFor more information, see TMEP section 1202.08(b)–(c), (d)(ii).\n\nEvidence showing use for a series\n\nProvide evidence to show that your trademark is being used as the name, title, or title portion for a series of creative works. Evidence typically consists of photographs, screen printouts or captures, point-of-sale displays, download links, and advertising. However, the use of a title of a book, for example, on collateral goods, such as posters, mugs, or t-shirts, does not establish a series, as those other goods are not books.\n\nThe examples below show how a name, title, or portion-of-a-title can be used for a series of creative works.\n\nDownloadable books (International Class 9)\n\nTitle portion NINJANGO® appears on a point-of-sale webpage display showing use on two different digital book covers of the series.\n\nRecorded DVDs (International Class 9)\n\nFilm title THE CHRONICLES OF NARNIA® (first example) and RUSH HOUR® (second example) shown on DVD jacket covers for two different titles in a film series.\n\nPrerecorded audio CDs (International Class 9)\n\nTitle THE 20/20 EXPERIENCE® used on two CD album covers showing use on a series for musical recordings.\n\nPrinted books (International Class 16)\n\nThe title THE CHRONCILES OF NARNIA® shown on a box set for a series of books.\n\nTwo book covers showing the title of a book series. DIARY OF A WIMPY KID®.\n\nThe book covers show the portion of a title THE COMPLETE IDIOT’S GUIDE TO® used on a series.\n\nPodcasts and radio program services (International Class 41)\n\nTitle SERIAL® shown on webpage advertising as a title of a series of non-downloadable podcasts.\n\nDISCLAIMER: References to particular trademarks, service marks, certification marks, products, services, companies, or organizations appearing on this page are for illustrative and educational purposes only and do not constitute or imply endorsement by the U.S. government, the U.S. Department of Commerce, the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, or any other federal agency.\n\nAdditional evidence required for portion-of-a-title\n\nIn addition to providing evidence showing use of the portion-of-a-title for a series of creative works (see TMEP section 1202.08(d)(ii)), you must do both of the following:\n\nProvide evidence that a portion-of-a-title creates a separate commercial impression apart from the complete title. For more information, see TMEP section 1202.08(d)(i).\n\nExample. The trademark THE LITTLE ENGINE is used as a portion-of-a-title for a series of books, with specimens showing the title on two different book covers as THE LITTLE ENGINE THAT WENT TO THE FAIR and THE LITTLE ENGINE THAT WENT TO SCHOOL. The wording THE LITTLE ENGINE creates a separate commercial impression from the rest of the title because it appears on the cover as separate from the rest of the wording in the title, and this wording is shown more prominently in a larger and bolder lettering style.\n\nProvide evidence that a portion-of-a-title is promoted and recognized as a source indicator for the series. For more information, see TMEP section 1202.08(d)(iii).\n\nExamples. Evidence of promotion or recognition as a trademark for a series includes advertising materials showing the series being promoted by the title portion (e.g., “Travel with ‘THE LITTLE ENGINE’ series!”); third-party reviews showing use of the title portion to refer to the series; and declarations from consumers such as retailers and purchasers showing recognition of the title portion as a source indicator for the series.\n\nExamples of additional evidence\n\nPrerecorded DVDs (International Class 9)\n\nDVD cover and box set show the PIRATES OF THE CARIBBEAN® series title:\n\nBeing promoted as a source-indicator for the series.\n\nCreating a separate commercial impression from the complete title on each DVD cover (e.g., the title “THE PIRATES OF THE CARIBBEAN THE CURSE OF THE BLACK PEARL”) and from the complete titles of the movies listed on the side of the box set.\n\nBeing shown more prominently than the other wording in the complete titles.\n\nIs part of a series of movies, as seen in the box set.\n\nPrinted books (International Class 16)\n\nThe book covers show the portion of a title FOR DUMMIES® used on a series. These covers also show that this title portion creates a separate commercial impression from the complete title as the wording FOR DUMMIES® appears in a different font and slightly separated from and below the rest of the book title. The webpage explaining about the series shows FOR DUMMIES® is promoted and recognized as a source-indicator for the series.\n\nThe box set shows that the title portion RAMONA® is used for a series and creates a separate commercial impression from the complete title of the books (e.g., BEEZUS AND ROMONA, RAMONA THE PEST, RAMONA THE BRAVE). The point-of-sale webpage shows RAMONA® is promoted and recognized as a source-indicator for the book series.\n\nRadio program services (International Class 41)\n\nWebpage advertising shows that the title portion THE NATIONAL CONVERSATION® is promoted and recognized as a source-indicator for the radio series, and creates a separate commercial impression from the complete title, which you can see through the repetition of “On this broadcast of 'The National Conversation' ... ” on the webpage. The episode list and characterization of the radio program as a “special series” show use as a series.\n\nDISCLAIMER: References to particular trademarks, service marks, certification marks, products, services, companies, or organizations appearing on this page are for illustrative and educational purposes only and do not constitute or imply endorsement by the U.S. government, the U.S. Department of Commerce, the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, or any other federal agency.\n\nResponse options for overcoming a refusal\n\nThere are several possible response options to overcome the refusal, some of which are discussed below. Not all options may be applicable to your specific situation. Review your office action carefully to determine which, if any, of these options may apply.\n\nResponse options for title of a single work refusal\n\nTo overcome this refusal, you can do one of the following:\n\nProvide evidence showing use of the title for a series of creative works\n\nTEAS instructions to provide evidence\n\nFollow the “how to respond” link in your office action to open the appropriate TEAS form.\n\nAnswer “Yes” to question 1. Review the remaining question(s) and select the “Yes” or “No” radio buttons, as appropriate.\n\nIn the \"Argument(s)\" section, use the \"Click here to Enter Argument(s)\" button to enter arguments as to why the trademark is eligible for registration.\n\nIn the \"Evidence\" section, use the “Click here to Attach Evidence” button to upload your evidence for use as a series as JPG/PDF files. You may enter a description of your evidence in the text box below the attach button.\n\nChange the basis of the application to intent to use, or withdraw an amendment to allege use, if one was submitted\n\nUse this response option if either of these are true:\n\nYour application is based on use in commerce under Trademark Act Section 1(a).\n\nYou submitted an amendment to allege use (AAU).

However, you can’t reinsert the deleted goods or services later.\n\nTEAS instructions to delete goods or services\n\nFollow the “how to respond” link in your office action to open the appropriate TEAS form.\n\nAnswer “Yes” to question 2.

You may enter a description of your evidence in the text box below.\n\nChange the basis of the application to intent to use, or withdraw an amendment to allege use, if one was submitted\n\nUse this response option if either of these are true:\n\nYour application is based on use in commerce under Trademark Act Section 1(a).\n\nYou submitted an amendment to allege use (AAU).
