        "text": "2007\n\nCity Locations\n\nDrumheller Valley, Alberta, Canada\n\nLocation Types\n\nCabins, Ranch, Rustic\n\nLocation Styles\n\nRanch Style, Racing, Rustic, Desert, Cabin\n\nAbout Heartland\n\nNumerous books have been adapted into movies or TV shows for years, but one of the best ones you should definitely watch in your lifetime is Heartland. Based on the novel series by Lauren Brooke, Heartland is currently the longest-running one-hour drama in Canadian TV history. It revolves around the life of Amy Fleming (Amber Marshall) and her relationships with her family at Heartland ranch.\n\nIf youâve been following the series since its first release in October 2007, you might want to visit the Heartland film location and walk in your favorite characterâs footsteps. But if you havenât watched a single episode, be warned! Weâve covered some notable scenes from different seasons (spoiler alert!) and included information on the beautiful filming locations for you to check out.\n\nHorse lover or not, youâll enjoy this family drama for its heartwarming stories that will leave you with a good feeling after every episode. It follows all the highs and lows of a ranching family in Canada who deals with various relatable experiences through marriage and friendship and love and loss.\n\nThroughout the 15 seasons, youâll watch Amy grow from a teenager mourning her motherâs death to becoming a mother herself. Youâll also see her perfect her unique horse-whispering ability, a gift she inherited from her late mother. With her genuine compassion and extraordinary talent, sheâs able to help abused and troubled horses by listening to them. With her horse rancher grandfather Jack Barlett (Jaun Johnston), Amy works to revive the family ranch.\n\nThis CBC original series is delightful to watch with incredibly genuine and relatable characters, making it easy for viewers to connect with and understand their dilemmas and daily struggles. Its touching tales present universal lessons that can resonate with anyone. Thatâs why itâs not surprising that itâs one of the most-loved Canadian TV series of all time, airing over 230 episodes on CBC across fifteen seasons.\n\nHeartland Locations\n\nThe filming location of the Heartland TV series and its surrounding areas are stunning places worth learning about, whether youâre planning to visit them or just curious where your favorite drama was filmed. Heartland is set on a ranch at the foot of the Rocky Mountains, near the town of Hudson.\n\nAlthough Hudson is a fictional area, the small town in Alberta actually exists that the drama fans can visit. Its real name is High River, a small community located about thirty minutes from the south of Calgary. This town is rich in history and offers outdoor adventures, picturesque scenery, and nearly thirty kilometers of biking and walking trails. So if youâre here to discover the Heartland locations, you can do other activities to keep you busy.\n\nThe ranch that provides the setting for the TV series is situated about forty-five minutes from High River and ten minutes from Millarville, which is another shooting location. Unfortunately for Heartland fans, you canât just rock up at the ranch and take a tour. Since itâs private property, entering it without the ownerâs permission would be considered trespassing and disrespecting the owner. Some of the interior scenes were shot inside a studio in Calgary.\n\nAmy and Ty got off on the wrong foot when they first met, but youâll see their relationship gradually blooms as the first season progresses. Thereâs been a time when Ty comforts her, and the couple nearly kiss. However, the much-awaited kiss didnât happen until the first season's final episode.\n\nOn the night of Amyâs victory after competing in the Fall Finale and winning first place with her horse, Spartan, she and Ty have a serious conversation in the barn. Amy is still ecstatic about winning and feels delighted with Spartanâs performance. Ty declares heâs proud of her and wants to say something else but struggles to find the right words to tell her how he feels. Then Amy says her famous line, âTalking is underrated.â Then Ty takes a step, holds her close, and kisses her.\n\nThis iconic moment happens in the season one finale, Coming Together, in episode 13. Itâs a heartwarming scene and certainly a treat to the couple's fans waiting for their sweet moment.\n\nBesides this kissing scene, the barn was featured in numerous remarkable parts and episodes of the show, from season 1 to 15. Itâs one of the dramaâs primary shooting locations in High River, and some of the best scenes in Heartland were filmed here. However, the Heartland production also created a perfect replica of the barn inside a studio. They used both locations for filming barn scenes.\n\nDiscover Film Studio Spaces\n\nWho would forget the gossip and date scenes that bring color to the characters and events in Heartland? Perhaps, one of the Heartland film sets that play a significant role in the drama is Maggieâs Diner, Tack & Feed store. In the series, itâs a busy local store owned by Margaret âMaggieâ Duval (Suzanne Coy). Itâs a popular meeting point and a place where everyone hangs out, chats, and gets lunch or a nice cup of coffee.\n\nIn the season 7 Wrecking Ball episode, youâll find Tim and Lou on the opposite ends of a fight as Maggieâs diner was put up for sale. It sparks a competition between the father and daughter because Tim wants to tear down the store to build a Buff Burger franchise, but Lou wants it to âstay the way it is.â Adding to her sentiments is the fact that itâs been in the town since 1902.\n\nMaggieâs Diner, Tack & Feed is one of the notable locations in the drama with its charming rustic log cabin style. Unlike other television shows that use real restaurants or working businesses, Maggieâs Diner is a dedicated set for shooting. Itâs a popular tourist spot, especially among the seriesâ fans looking to tour the location.\n\nWhile you canât go in to have a slice of pie or order coffee here, you can always stop by, see the exterior, and take a picture outside. Youâll see the diner with a kitchen area, countertop, chairs, and tables, just like the ones youâll see in the drama when you look through the window. If you walk around the area, you might recognize a few other storefronts that have also been featured in the show throughout the seasons.\n\nIf youâre coming from Calgary, no direct bus will take you from the city to the High River. The best and most convenient way to get to the town is through a taxi or a private vehicle.\n\nLocate Filming Locations\n\nSince itâs a drama series centered on a horse-whisperer living on a ranch, expect to see horse-riding scenes, races, and rodeos. In one of the scenes in season 5, episode 5, Never Let Go, Amy does a trick riding performance in front of Ty with a horse that would only go counterclockwise, which she noted that âtrick riding horses are trained to do.â\n\nIn episode 8, season 14, Riders on the Storm, Emmett (Justin Rain) appears as Scottâs nephew, seeking to continue his familyâs relay racing tradition. Heâs having trouble with one of the horses, Barega, whoâs the fastest on the circuit, but Emmett feels sheâs wasted on him.\n\nFrustrated and annoyed during a training session, he asks why he canât land it, as Barega is always ready to take off and run. Of course, our heroine finds a solution, and Emmett eventually decides to race despite his doubt and reluctance at the beginning.\n\nThese and many other rodeo and horse racing scenes take place in the fictional Hudson race track. In reality, they were filmed in a small village called Millarville. It is home to The Millarville Racing & Agricultural Society, just 35 minutes southwest of Calgary.\n\nThis historical racetrack has been around for over a century and now hosts various family-oriented events. These include Millarville Heritage Rodeo, seasonal Farmerâs Market, races, etc. It also offers facility rentals and a campground in a gorgeous natural setting for a relaxing camping experience. Thereâs no direct connection from Calgary city to Millarville. But you can take the tram 201 to Sb Somerset-Bridlewood C-train Station. Then, youâll have to take a taxi or drive to the village. The fastest way to get to Millarville from Calgary is by taxi.\n\nBrowse Video Shoot Locations\n\nDo you remember Heartlandâs fourth episode in season 4, Graduation? How about the A Time to Remember episode in season 13? If youâve followed the series from the beginning, youâll most likely remember these critical milestones in Amy and Georgieâs lives â their high school graduation!\n\nEven if youâre not a fan of the series, youâve probably heard or taken note of the quote about obstacles from the valedictorian speech during Georgieâs graduation. Perhaps, one of the things we can get from that moving speech is that âobstacles arenât meant to be tackled alone.â\n\nAmy and Georgieâs graduation scenes took place in an outdoor setting at George Lane Memorial Park. Avid watchers of the show who visit the site will undoubtedly recognize the famous red gazebo. It is located next to the beautiful downtown of High River, featuring a playground, a baseball diamond, horseshoe pits, an events stage, and picnic areas. It is also home to mature black cottonwoods, many of which are over a hundred years old.\n\nThe park and campground is only a few minutesâ walk from shops, bars, and restaurants. Itâs also close to the Highwood River, which is great for swimming. However, youâll need a car or hire a taxi to get to the park, as it could take you over three hours on a bus to get there. If you want to take the train, you can catch the Line 201 tram and ride two buses, which could take about three hours and a half.\n\nExplore Film Shoot Locations"
