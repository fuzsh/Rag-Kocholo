The person with dementia may be aware of — and frustrated by — the changes taking place, such as difficulty recalling recent events, making decisions or processing what was said by others.\n\nIn the later stages, memory loss becomes far more severe. A person may not recognize family members, may forget relationships, call family members by other names, or become confused about the location of home or the passage of time. He or she may forget the purpose of common items, such as a pen or a fork. These changes are some of the most painful for caregivers and families.\n\nSuch types of behavior is sometimes incorrectly referred to as \"senility\" or \"senile dementia,\" which reflects the formerly widespread but incorrect belief that serious mental decline is a normal part of aging.\n\nLearn more: Stages of Alzheimer's, Age-related Memory Loss vs. Alzheimer's, Dealing with Memory Changes\n\nCauses\n\nThe main underlying cause of memory loss and confusion is the progressive damage to brain cells caused by Alzheimer's disease. While current medications cannot stop the damage Alzheimer's causes to brain cells, they may help lessen symptoms for a limited time.\n\nCertain situations — such as a change in living arrangements, switch in routine or certain infections — can cause symptoms to worsen. Any time there is a sudden change in behavior, it is important to have a medical evaluation to rule out other causes.\n\nHow to respond"
