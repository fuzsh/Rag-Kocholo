        "text": "By now Connie Britton must be a little tired of playing variations on the tough, beleaguered wife, as she did for five seasons on “Friday Night Lights” and one on “American Horror Story,” picking up three Emmy nominations along the way. But she’s back at it, this time as a country music queen in ABC’s new drama “Nashville,” and she’s still outstanding: “Nashville” is the best of the fall pilots, if only because of her presence.\n\nThere are other virtues to the show, which was created by the screenwriter Callie Khouri (an Oscar winner for “Thelma and Louise”) and has Ms. Khouri’s husband, the celebrated T Bone Burnett, as its music producer. The depiction of the modern country music business in “Nashville” feels reasonably authentic, and when the story stays within that realm, it has the mix of hardheadedness, sentimentality and honky-tonk come-on you can get from a good country song.\n\nAs a young sensation who plays it innocent in public while sleeping with any man who can further her career, Ms. Panettiere is believably seductive and petulant. Her range isn’t much wider than that, but in the big scenes Ms. Britton, an expert at reaction shots and cutting asides, is often there to bail her out.\n\nAnd it may be Ms. Britton’s job to keep bailing out the show, which spins along smoothly enough in Wednesday night’s premiere but not without some danger signs. Ms. Khouri’s résumé tends toward high-class soap opera (“Something to Talk About,” “Divine Secrets of the Ya-Ya Sisterhood”), and there are some alarmingly ripe moments in the pilot, particularly a tearful phone conversation between Ms. Panettiere’s Juliette Barnes and her drug addict mother that’s set in a backstage closet.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
