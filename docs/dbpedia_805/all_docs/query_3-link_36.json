        "text": "What do we mean by signs and stages of dementia?\n\nThere are many different types of dementia and all of them are progressive. This means symptoms may be relatively mild at first but they get worse with time, usually over several years. These include problems with memory, thinking, problem-solving or language, and often changes in emotions, perception or behaviour.\n\nAs dementia progresses, a person will need more help and, at some point, will need a lot of support with daily living. However, dementia is different for everyone, so it will vary how soon this happens and the type of support needed.\n\nIt can be helpful to think of there being three stages of dementia:\n\nearly stage\n\nmiddle stage\n\nlate stage.\n\nThese are sometimes called mild, moderate and severe, because this describes how much the symptoms affect a person.\n\nThese stages can be used to understand how dementia is likely to change over time, and to help people prepare for the future. The stages also act as a guide to when certain treatments, such as medicines for Alzheimer’s disease, are likely to work best.\n\nClick the orange play button to listen to an audio version of this page:\n\nHow important are the stages of dementia?\n\nThe stages of dementia are just a guide and there is nothing significant about the number three. Equally, dementia doesn’t follow an exact or certain set of steps that happen in the same way for every person with dementia.\n\nIt can be difficult to tell when a person’s dementia has progressed from one stage to another because:\n\nsome symptoms may appear in a different order to the stages described in this factsheet, or not at all\n\nthe stages may overlap – the person may need help with some aspects of everyday life but manage other tasks and activities on their own\n\nsome symptoms, particularly those linked to behaviours, may develop at one stage and then reduce or even disappear later on. Other symptoms, such as memory loss and problems with language and thinking, tend to stay and get worse with time.\n\nIt is natural to ask which stage a person is at or what might happen next. But it is more important to focus on the person in the present moment. This includes their needs and how they can live well, and how to help them with this.\n\nFor more support on living well with dementia see The dementia guide: living well after diagnosis (for people living with dementia) or Caring for a person with dementia: a practical guide (for carers).\n\nAnd for more information about treatment and support for the different types of dementia go to the following pages:\n\nWhat is Alzheimer’s disease?\n\nWhat is vascular dementia?\n\nWhat is dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB)?\n\nWhat is frontotemporal dementia (FTD)?\n\nWhy is dementia progressive?\n\nDementia is not a single condition. It is caused by different physical diseases of the brain, for example Alzheimer’s disease, vascular dementia, DLB and FTD.\n\nIn the early stage of all types of dementia only a small part of the brain is damaged. In this stage, a person has fewer symptoms as only the abilities that depend on the damaged part of the brain are affected. These early symptoms are usually relatively minor. This is why ‘mild’ dementia is used as an alternative term for the early stage.\n\nEach type of dementia affects a different area of the brain in the early stages. This is why symptoms vary between the different types. For example, memory loss is common in early-stage Alzheimer’s but is very uncommon in early-stage FTD.\n\nAs dementia progresses into the middle and later stages, the symptoms of the different dementia types tend to become more similar. This is because more of the brain is affected as dementia progresses."
