        "text": "Rayna James is Country Music. Or maybe it’s more accurate to say: Rayna James is what Country Music was. In the opening minutes of the premiere of Nashville, we meet Rayna at her big house getting ready for a big show. She gives a big hug to her two adorable children and her genial hubby. Within moments, she’s onstage at the Grand Ole Opry, celebrating Watty White: Producer, Nashville legend, Rayna’s person Mr. Miyagi. She’s flanked by lead guitarist and love-slave Deacon Claybourne, and she’s singing one of her hits. She’s Faith Hill, or Reba McEntire, or Tami Taylor with a singing voice. She’s on top of the world. There are cracks in the facade, of course: Her husband happily tells the kids that they’re rich, but they’re a different kind of rich: “Cash poor.” But she’s a star. Stars don’t go broke. What could possibly happen to upset Rayna’s happy life?\n\nTime could happen. The evolving state of the music industry could happen. Juliette Barnes could happen. We meet Juliette Barnes backstage. Juliette is a multimedia darling. She’s written a book: Driven ‘Em Crazy, a bestseller, no credit given to the ghostwriter. She’s got a number-one album in a weird new era where people never buy albums. Her voice is pretty, but auto-tune makes it sound robo-beautiful. She’s Taylor Swift, or Carrie Underwood, or the cheerleader from Heroes with zero moral code. And she’s got a new line of perfume, coming soon to a Wal-Mart near you. Juliette tries out some perfume recipes. It doesn’t smell like anything. The actual content of the perfume doesn’t matter; all that matters is her name on the bottle. We’re less than three minutes into the first episode of Nashville, and already, the show has provided a handy metaphor for modern pop stardom: A beautiful perfume bottle filled with water vapor.\n\nJuliette’s handlers tell her to meet Rayna. “Just kiss the ring. Tell her you’re a huge fan.” Juliette tells Rayna that her mom was a huge fan, back in the miserable days before Juliette Barnes was born and brought light back to the world. “Well, bless your little heart,” says Rayna. “That is a charming story. You probably gotta go on soon, make sure you got those girls tucked in real good!” Juliette makes a face that looks like a smile. And this is how we are introduced to one of the most important supporting characters in Nashville: The Barely-Repressed Hayden Panettiere Bitchface.\n\nIt’s a look that seems to say: “I am a bloodthirsty Warlord Chieftess, and I am laughing while I decide whether I’m going to decapitate you or disembowel you.”\n\nJuliette goes onstage, and the label boys lay some truth grenades on Rayna. The new album is failing. It charted at 20 and hasn’t stopped falling. Her tour is hemorrhaging money. But here’s a hot high-concept idea, straight from the new head of the label: Why not co-headline a tour with Juliette? The kids love her! She’ll sell out stadiums from New York to LA. “Who goes on first?” asks Rayna. The label boys hem and haw and stare at the ceiling. “Yeah, no,” says Rayna. The conversation ends. Rayna stares up at the screen as Juliette squawks through her latest multi-platinum chart-topping country-pop hit. The youth of America is singing, and so we are introduced to another supporting character: Connie Britton’s Nails-On-The-Chalkboard Wince of Abject Existential Disgust.\n\nIt’s a look that seems to say: “My name is Sarah Connor, and SkyNet has officially taken over the world.”\n\nFrom there, the show quickly sketches in the ecosystem of power which underlies the modern country-music metropolis. Rayna is the prodigal daughter of Lamar Wyatt, a man so powerful that Nashville gave him his very own holiday. “Happy Lamar Wyatt Day!” says Rayna to her non-prodigal sister, a professional Girl Friday and future Shadow-Empress of Nashville named Tandy. Rayna is planning to support her old friend Coleman in the mayoral race. (Aside: Fans of The Wire will recognize Coleman as Robert Wisdom, the guy who played Bunny Colvin, mayor of Hamsterdam. Fans of Prison Break will recognize Coleman as “the dude from the Season 3 Prison,” and then wonder why they were still watching Prison Break in season 3. Based on those two previous roles, we can assume that Coleman’s mayoral platform includes a lenient drug policy and also totalitarianism. End of Aside.) But Lamar has his own plans for the mayoral race. He wants to build a baseball park in the middle of Nashville. Coleman is anti-baseball, apparently. So Lamar suggests an alternate candidate: His son-in-law, Teddy Conrad, Mr. Rayna James.\n\nNEXT: Alt-Country Punk, but more cerebral!\n\nAs fate would have it, Teddy isn’t doing too much just now. He went bust in the Recession. “I’m working on some deals right now,” he tells Rayna — “working on some deals” being the preferred American synonym for “Unemployed.” Like a lot of characters on Nashville, Teddy is rich and could become poor at any minute. Rayna worked her way up from the bottom, and doesn’t want to go back. She tells her producer that she’d love to cut one of those three surefire hit songs he’s always talking about. Problem: Those songs have already been taken. And another problem: The producer is now recording songs with Juliette. (He’s got an ex-wife or three. Gotta pay the bills somehow.) “Why do people listen to that adolescent crap?” asks Rayna. “It sounds like feral cats to me!” Cut to upstairs, where Juliette is laying in bed naked, and we meet the final important supporting character on Nashville: Hayden Panettiere’s Unrepressed Full Bitchface.\n\nIt’s a look that seems to say: “I’m going to tape your eyes open and let you watch while I destroy your whole entire world.”\n\nMeanwhile, Deacon is playing some of his original material at the Best Little Music Bar in Tennessee: The Bluebird Cafe. He says hi to his niece, Scarlett, a girl with a thing for poetry and the wrong men. The latest wrong man is Avery Barkley, a songwriter who describes his genre as: “Alt-Country Punk, but more cerebral.” This is a genre also known as Doucheboat Folk, and I should know, because I listen to that music all the time. Deacon is greeted outside by Juliette, who tells him that she wants to record his music, tour with him, make sweet requited love to him. “Rayna’s not the only woman in the world, you know.” “You’re a girl,” he says. “That, too,” she responds, taking the compliment. (Aside: The dialogue on this show! Good on you, producer/writer Callie Khouri. Make some room next to that Thelma & Louise Oscar for an Emmy or three. End of Aside.)\n\nRayna throws a diva fit during a practice session and storms out with Deacon. “It whatn’t that long ago that I was the future of country music,” she says. (I could listen to Connie Britton say “whatn’t” for an hour each week and be happy.) Rayna and Deacon flirt like old lovers who’ve become friends that could become lovers. “You’re not some overnight sensation. But you are sensational overnight, to the best of my recollection,” he says. She laughs: That’s why she never recorded any of his songs.\n\nMeanwhile, across town, Rayna’s husband and Rayna’s father are having a their own flirtmance, man-to-man. Lamar is offering Teddy power, pure and simple. “This is a thriving, prosperous city. An industrial and cultural juggernaut,” says Lamar, with a voice that sounds like hundred-dollar bills dipped in rich aged bourbon. “Do you understand the kind of power you’re gonna have?” Teddy says yes, but asks: Who’s going to tell Rayna? “You are,” says Lamar. “Your first order of business as a mayoral candidate is to grow a pair.”\n\nSo Teddy tells Rayna he wants to run for mayor. The conversation goes something like this:\n\nTeddy: “Mayor! I could run for Mayor! You wait and see, Rayna. I will be mayor! I’ll be the most powerful man in Nashville, and I’m gonna clean up this town.”\n\nRayna: “Good. You can start by cleaning the floor.” [Hands him a broom]\n\nTeddy begs Rayna. He has no illusions. He knows that he wasn’t her first choice. But he has stayed by her. “How about letting me step into the limelight for a change?” (Fans of Friday Night Lights will recognize this as essentially the same conversation that Connie Britton was having with her last TV husband, except with the gender roles reversed.)\n\nMeanwhile, at the Bluebird Cafe, Scarlett stays for a late clean-up shift with Gunnar, an adorable struggling musician who is the polar opposite of Scarlett’s boyfriend in every way: Open-hearted, kind, classic country. Gunnar steals a look at Scarlett’s poetry. “These aren’t poems! They’re songs!” he says. They’re all about the same dude: The ex-boyfriend who also happens to be her current boyfriend. “I’ve tried being without him, and I can’t. He’s the one,” she says. “There’s always another one,” Gunnar whimpers, waving his hands frantically while his guitar gently weeps.\n\nNEXT: “The older business models are irrelevant.” “How dare you insult Cindy Crawford like that!”Rayna and Watty pay a visit to Edgehill Republic, the record label that Rayna carried from a tiny one-room office all the way to the top of a very tall skyscraper. (Country Music fans: Did you spot the real-life musicians up on the Edgehill Wall of Fame?) Rayna meets Marshall Evans, the new man in charge. Marshall Evans is a fierce, focused, Albert-Brooks-in-Drive-lookin’ dude. He smirks while Rayna talks about the past: How she cut her first album with Edgehill, how she won Nine Grammys, how she built this company, how she stayed loyal. Loyalty doesn’t matter in the new economy, though. “Ms. James: You’ve got to find your place in a new market.”\n\nThat sets Rayna off. She’s not an old woman, but she comes from a positively Cro-Magnon era when tradition whatn’t a bad word. She spent 21 years at Edgewood — probably longer than Juliette has been alive. “Your little ingenue wouldn’t make it as one of my backup singers,” she says. Marshall laughs off the insult. He’s all-business. “Ms. James, we will need your decision.” Rayna, with the putdown of the night: “You can kiss my decision as it’s walking out the door.” (Aside: Callie Khouri! Connie Britton! End of Aside.)\n\nRayna is facing problems all over the place. She paid a visit to her dad and asked him why he felt the need to play the snake in the grass to her beloved husband. Lamar couldn’t stand her acting all high and mighty. “Every dime you ever earned is because of me!” he said. “Who do you think paid for your first album? That pissant little record label?” That cut deep, slicing right into Rayna’s self-made self-image. And the next cut went even deeper: Lamar asked how she could possibly embarrass her husband any more, especially in light of “Little Maddie,” her oldest daughter. Is Maddie not actually Teddy’s daughter? Is she Deacon’s daughter? How many country songs have there been called “The Deacon’s Daughter? So many questions, not enough answers!\n\nRayna storms out, claiming: “We cannot be bought, and I cannot be bought!” With that, Rayna might have set forward one of the main overarching story arcs of Nashville: The battle between art and commerce, the question of just how much of yourself you’ll sell for the chance at success and power. That all came together in the closing minutes of the episode. Gunnar convinced Scarlett to get onstage for a duet. They sang a song together, with a simple chorus: “If I didn’t know better/But Dammit, I Do.” While they sang, we saw Producer Randy swing by Juliette’s house. Juliette turned him away. She was rehearsing with Deacon. Said rehearsal involved a vicious and vengeful makeout sesh which — given the fact that Deacon’s music was a formative influence on Juliette — doubled as a handy visual portrait of the Elektra Complex in action. Meanwhile, Teddy officially launched his campaign against Coleman. No political leanings were announced, but Coleman’s banner was blue and Teddy’s was red; draw your own conclusions. Meanwhile, Watty was sitting in the Bluebird listening to Gunnar and Scarlett sing; he called Rayna, let her listen to the song, and told her: “Call you later. I got an idea.”\n\nAll in all, fellow viewers, that was one heck of a series premiere, and we didn’t even get into Juliette’s drug addicted momma, all the awesome Nashville locations, and the fact that the lyrics of Juliette’s big hit are “Boys and Buses got a lot in common/They both pick up speed when you try to stop ’em.” Be sure to check out Ken Tucker’s review of the premiere here, and start talking in the comment boards. What did you think of the first episode? Which audiotape would you purchase first: Powers Boothe Reads the Phone Book, Connie Britton Flirts With the Phone Book, or Hayden Panettiere Stabs the Phone Book in the Back While Sleeping With the Phone Book’s Lifelong Crush? Does auto-tune make everything better? Is country music dead?"
