        "text": "Common questions about first aid for someone who is choking\n\nWhat should I do if back blows don't stop the person choking?\n\nIf back blows do not dislodge the blockage, stand behind them, join your hands around their tummy and form a fist. Pull your hands sharply inwards and upwards. Repeat up to five times.\n\nThis is sometimes called the Heimlich manoeuvre or abdominal thrust. Donâ€™t do this on a child under a year old.\n\nWhat should I do if the person becomes unresponsive?\n\nSupport them, lowering them gently to the ground and treat them as someone who is unresponsive and not breathing.\n\nFind out how to help someone who is unresponsive and not breathing.\n\nShould I help a child who is choking in a different way to how I help an adult?\n\nHelp children more than a year old in the same way as adults. Give up to five firm blows on the back, reducing the force of the blows for a smaller child.\n\nFind out more about how to help a child who is choking.\n\nHow do I help a baby who is choking?\n\nBabies under one year old should be held face-down along your thigh with their head lower than their bottom. Hit them firmly on their back up to five times to dislodge the blockage.\n\nFind out more about how to help a baby who is choking.\n\nDuring life-threatening emergencies, call 999, or for non-emergency medical help, call 111."
