        "text": "It‚Äôs been literal years, but Bridgerton season 3 is finally upon us! Penelope Featherington and Colin Bridgerton‚Äôs love story drops May 16 on Netflix, which means both the hotly anticipated mirror scene and carriage scene are incoming. Well. Ish.\n\nFor reasons that are best described as üò≠üò≠üò≠, Netflix has been experimenting with releasing seasons of their most popular shows (hi, Stranger Things) in two parts. And Bridgerton season 3 is no exception. Of course, absence only makes the heart grow fonder/thirstier, so if you find yourself desperately needing to know when Bridgerton drops...here‚Äôs what to expect.\n\n‚ÄúThe ones we love have the power to inflict the greatest scars.‚Äù ‚ÄîLady Whistledown talking about Netflix, probably\n\nBridgerton Season 3: Episodes 1‚Äì4\n\nThe first four episodes of Bridgerton season 3 drop on May 16 and consist of...*ahem*...\n\nSeason 3, Episode 1: ‚ÄúOut of the Shadows‚Äù\n\nSeason 3, Episode 2: ‚ÄúHow Bright the Moon‚Äù\n\nSeason 3, Episode 3: ‚ÄúForces of Nature‚Äù\n\nSeason 3, Episode 4: ‚ÄúOld Friends‚Äù\n\nNetflix shows typically premiere at 12:00 a.m. PT, so if you feel like staying up and bingeing episodes 1 through 4 on Thursday night, they should be available at the stroke of midnight on the West Coast.\n\nSide note, here‚Äôs the official season 3 synopsis‚Äîin case you want to parse it for clues:\n\nPenelope has finally given up on her long-held crush on Colin after hearing his disparaging words about her last season. She has, however, decided it‚Äôs time to take a husband, preferably one who will provide her with enough independence to continue her double life as Lady Whistledown, far away from her mother and sisters. But lacking in confidence, Penelope‚Äôs attempts on the marriage mart fail spectacularly. Meanwhile, Colin has returned from his summer travels with a new look and a serious sense of swagger. But he‚Äôs disheartened to realize that Penelope, the one person who always appreciated him as he was, is giving him the cold shoulder. Eager to win back her friendship, Colin offers to mentor Penelope in the ways of confidence to help her find a husband this season. But when his lessons start working a little too well, Colin must grapple with whether his feelings for Penelope are truly just friendly. Complicating matters for Penelope is her rift with Eloise (Claudia Jessie), who has found a new friend in a very unlikely place, while Penelope‚Äôs growing presence in the ton makes it all the more difficult to keep her Lady Whistledown alter ego a secret.\n\nWATCH BRIDGERTON\n\nBridgerton Season 3: Episode 5‚Äì8\n\nThe final four episodes of Bridgerton Season 3 drop on June 13, and honestly I, for one, am intrigued by the titles (especially episode 7)...\n\nSeason 3, Episode 5: ‚ÄúTick Tock‚Äù\n\nSeason 3, Episode 6: ‚ÄúRomancing Mister Bridgerton‚Äù\n\nSeason 3, Episode 7: ‚ÄúJoining of Hands‚Äù\n\nSeason 3, Episode 8: ‚ÄúInto the Light‚Äù\n\nSo, yeah: We have to wait just under a month to find out what happens between Penelope and Colin. That‚Äôs the bad news. The good news is that this delay gives everyone plenty of time to spoil themselves by reading Julia Quinn‚Äôs Polin book Romancing Mister Bridgerton.\n\nWhy Is Bridgerton Season 3 in Two Parts?\n\nNetflix hasn‚Äôt given a specific reason, but they‚Äôve done this with several major shows including The Crown and Stranger Things‚Äîand it seems to be a format they‚Äôre continuing to experiment with (Emily in Paris season 4 will also have two parts). It goes without saying that splitting a hugely popular show helps retain subscribers for a longer period of time!\n\nWhat About Bridgerton Season 4?\n\nAs for Bridgerton season 4, we have a whole breakdown of the release date, cast, filming, and plot over this way, but the top notes? We don‚Äôt know which Bridgerton sibling the show will name ~diamond of the season~ just yet, but producers sure do.\n\nAuthor Julia Quinn confirmed as much to People at the NYC premiere of Bridgerton season 3, saying, ‚ÄúI do know, but I can‚Äôt say.‚Äù\n\nGuess we‚Äôll have to wait for the next Lady Whistledown dispatch!"
