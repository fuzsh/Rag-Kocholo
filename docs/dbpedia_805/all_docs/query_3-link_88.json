        "text": "In celebration of 40 years of Reading Rainbow, we will be sharing 40 FULL EPISODES of Reading Rainbow on our YouTube channel!\n\nFor a limited time only, enjoy full episodes of the original series. Episodes will be made available to stream on YouTube one at a time, released every Tuesday and Thursday - through February 2024.\n\nStay posted to see which episodes are included in this special 40th Anniversary treat for YOU (or check YouTube if you just can't wait ) and subscribe to our YouTube channel to never miss an episode.\n\nThe broadcast and creation of new Reading Rainbow episodes ended in 2006 due to funding challenges and a growing need to update the show’s concept to adapt to changing technology and delivery methods. The series continued to air in re-runs until 2009. The media landscape of children’s programming has expanded considerably since the show’s premiere over three decades ago; there is now an abundance of new shows, channels, and means of watching video, including on-demand, streaming, and on tablets and mobile devices. These means allow for direct links to related interactive activities and educational games.\n\nBuffalo Toronto Public Media (BTPM) plans to re-establish Reading Rainbow as a leader in children’s education programming. To meet the needs of kids today and ensure the longevity of the series, it is necessary to adapt to evolving digital media needs and delivery methods. New and emerging technology has opened up a whole new world of possibilities for this type of creative engagement, and there is now more evidence-based research on the most effective teaching strategies across different media. BTPM is currently exploring the most popular and effective methods of developing and enhancing content in order to determine the optimal course of action for reimagining this program.\n\nWe have some exciting projects in the works for Reading Rainbow, so check back to our website often and be sure to follow us on social media!"
