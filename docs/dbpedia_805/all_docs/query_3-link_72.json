Hailing from Pennsylvania, Joey loves to hike, surf, and explore nature — something he hopes to share with a future wife.\n\nHow Old Is the New Bachelor?\n\nBachelor Joey Graziadei is 28 years old.\n\nWhere is The Bachelor Mansion?\n\nThe Bachelor mansion is located in Agoura Hills, California.\n\nWho was the Last Bachelor?\n\nBefore Joey, Zach Shallcross was the season 27 bachelor.\n\nThe Bachelor Episode Recap\n\nEpisode 1 — Week 1\n\nLet the journey begin!\n\nIt’s night one, and Joey finally meets his bachelorettes — all 32 of them. No pressure, that’s only the most contestants in franchise history. Some bachelorettes stepped outside the box to make a first impression, like Jess, who not-so-casually “sailed” up to the mansion on a boat. As it turns out, her grand entrance is fitting — it’s only the first night, and there’s already a boatload of drama.\n\nWatch: Episode 1\n\nEpisode 2 — Week 2\n\nThe first group date of the season had Joey and half of the contestants dressed to the nines for a fake wedding while the remaining hopefuls geared up for a boot camp-style tournament. As for the first one-on-one? Daisy stole our hearts on the sweetest date since Gerry and Theresa’s first date back in September.\n\nDon’t let all this love in the air fool you, though. Where there’s love, drama will surely follow on The Bachelor. Back at the mansion, “the dumbest fight in Bachelor history” took place, according to contestant Maria.\n\nWatch: Episode 2\n\nEpisode 3 — Week 3\n\nIt’s Week 3, and the battle of Maria vs. Sydney continues, but what’s The Bachelor without some drama?\n\nThe first group date of the week has the ladies showing off their talents at the “Mrs. Right Pageant” where Golden Bachelor favorites April, Susan, Kathy, and Nancy make guest appearances as the judges. From strutting their stuff to showcasing their hidden talents, Joey’s ladies step outside of their comfort zones on this date, so it’s no wonder why everyone was a little thrown off when Joey crowns Lexi the winner for her “talent” — being the best kisser and proving it by making out with Joey on stage in front of everyone.\n\nJoey’s one-on-one date with Jenn went swimmingly as the pair spent the day surfing and rolling around on the beach, ending the night with a romantic dinner featuring deep conversations, big emotions, and a romantic light show.\n\nAs for the second group date? Welcome to the lamest pool party ever (aside from the buffet of fried chicken and biscuits). The only thing making a splash on this date is the drama.\n\nWatch: Episode 3\n\nEpisode 4 — Week 4\n\nGet ready for the first travel episode of the season! Joey and his remaining 16 ladies (including Maria and Sydney) jet off to Malta where they experience the largest group date in Bachelor history (and the most awkward two-on-one date in Bachelor history, too).\n\nThe dates kick off with Lexi and Joey, and it’s undeniable that sparks are flying as they spend the day experiencing Malta’s culture. At dinner, she opens up about a health diagnosis that may complicate their potential marriage, but in true Joey nature, he displays no signs of fear or deterrence.\n\nNext up: the group date. Joey and the girls trek to ancient Fort Manoel and dress up gladiator-style to compete in intense challenges, including a romantic staring contest and a less-romantic game of bobbing for sausages.\n\nThe last date of the episode includes a two-on-one between Joey, Maria, and Sydney (yikes!). But the Maria/Sydney drama-saga ends here, and a new villain is crowned — can you guess who?\n\nWatch: Week 4\n\nEpisode 5 — Week 5\n\nThe journey continues this week in the south of Spain and tensions are high following the chaos in Week 4. The episode starts with Kelsey A. getting the Lizzie McGuire Movie one-on-one date of our dreams when Joey drives off with her on a Vespa to go shopping, drink wine, and explore the local culture.\n\nAt this point, it’s getting difficult for the girls to watch Joey create deep connections with the other women. It’s especially tough for Lea who has taken Sydney’s place as the resident Maria-hater.\n\nIn this week’s group date, Joey and the ladies get to show off their art skills (or lack thereof) with a painting challenge. Lea thinks her art skills make her a shoo-in, but Joey gravitates towards the simplicity and meaning behind Jess’ painting instead and chooses her for extra one-on-one time after the group date.\n\nRachel scores the Week 5 one-on-one, and the pair put on their dancing shoes for a flamenco dancing lesson. Joey doesn’t think his date outfit through but still pulls off shorts and flamenco shoes in a way that only he can.\n\nAs the episode comes closes, more Maria-based drama ensues at the cocktail party when Maria asserts herself for more time with Joey even though she already has a rose from an earlier date, and Lea and Jess aren’t having it.\n\nWatch: Week 5\n\nEpisode 6 — Week 6\n\nAu revoir, haters! Joey and the girls are off to Montreal where Canadian native Maria is excited to spend solo time with Joey for the second one-on-one date of the episode. And it’s not just any date — it’s the infamous shopping spree date of the season (if you know, you know). The connection between Joey and Maria is electric (he even drops an accidental “I love you” in French), but that doesn’t keep Joey from being down in his feelings and fears that he’ll be standing alone at the end of the season.\n\nThe other one-on-one date in Montreal belongs to Kelsey T. The pair leaves the date with their heads spinning (and it’s not just because of their whirlwind romance).\n\nFor the group date, Joey and his lovely ladies take a cooking class where they make their own unique poutine dishes. Emotions are high as Joey’s connections grow deeper with some more than others. Later, Jess admits to Joey that she’s been in her head about the status of their relationship. Instead of getting the reassurance she’s hoping for, he confirms her worst fears.\n\nMeanwhile, Lexi realizes she’s not on the same page as Joey when it comes to starting a family. He wants to wait a while, which is not a luxury Lexi can afford due to her medical condition.\n\nWatch: Week 6\n\nEpisode 7 — Week 7\n\nWith hometowns just days away, this week in Alberta, Canada is a big one for Joey and his six remaining women. Bachelor fans are excited to see the episode start with a one-on-one date with Daisy as the two horseback ride through the breathtaking (and incredibly romantic) terrain up to a hot tub nestled among the mountains.\n\nDaisy admits that she’s not in love with Joey just yet, but she can picture herself getting there (and this flawless date could be enough to do her in).\n\nKelsey A. snagged the second one-on-one in Alberta, where the two explored the area and even participated in a local Polar Plunge.\n\nBoth Daisy and Kelsey A. walked away from their dates with a rose, which means next week Joey will be going to their respective hometowns.\n\nAs for the remaining ladies? Fan-favorite and top contender Maria falls flat during this week’s group date, which hits her especially hard after coming off a fairy tale one-on-one date the week prior in Montreal.\n\nWatch: Week 7\n\nEpisode 8 — Week 8, ‘Hometowns’\n\nThe final four (Daisy, Kelsey A., Rachel, and Maria) make it to the coveted ‘Hometowns’ week, where Joey visits each of the contestants in their hometown to meet their respective families. For what feels like the first time in Bachelor history, all four hometown dates go off without a hitch — until the end of Maria’s visit where she froze before being able to tell Joey that she’s falling in love with him.\n\nFeeling regret for missing the moment to be open with Joey, she shocks everyone when she stops the rose ceremony to have a quick conversation with him. Is her bold but romantic gesture enough to win him over or did Maria muster up the courage only to find out it’s too late?\n\nWatch: Week 8\n\nEpisode 9 — Week 9, ‘Overnights’\n\nJoey’s top three — Rachel, Kelsey, and Daisy — make it to the coveted “Fantasy Suites” week, where the remaining contestants spend an entire day (and night) alone with their Bachelor. All three overnight dates went well, as long as you’re not counting Rachel’s emergency trip to the hospital and Kelsey’s post-date panic attack.\n\nWill Kelsey’s fear of the unknown make her walk away willingly, or will Joey have to choose someone to send home?\n\nWatch: Week 9, ‘Fantasy Suites’\n\nEpisode 10 — ‘The Women Tell All’\n\nHas Bachelor Nation ever been so excited for a “Women Tell All” episode with the return of fan-favorite, Maria?\n\nIn this episode, Jesse Palmer sits down with Joey and the women from this season to take a look back at all of the biggest moments, including the Maria/Sydney/Lea drama. Plus, we finally get closure from Week 9 — why did Kelsey leave Joey that cryptic note, what is it exactly that she needs to talk about, and which of the final three was sent home? Oh, and don’t forget about the blooper reel.\n\nWatch: The Women Tell All\n\nEpisode 11 — “Finale and After the Rose”\n\nDaisy or Kelsey — who will Joey get down on one knee for? The moment will shock you in this Bachelor Nation first. Plus, the newest Bachelorette is crowned! Don’t let the spoilers get to you before watching the last episode of the season now on Hulu.\n\nWatch: The Finale and After the Rose\n\nNot ready to say “goodbye” to Joey? Don’t worry — we aren’t either. Watch every episode of this season on-demand now, exclusively on Hulu."
