        "text": "There will be a bouncer near the entrance. Walk over to him and speak to him. You’ll present your fake I.D. to him but he won’t buy it and won’t let you in. There is a key item you’ll need to interact with before you convince him to let you in.\n\nFirst, have Chloe examine the motorcycle closest to the bouncer with the flower decal on it. This will open up new dialogue options with the bouncer. Then walk towards the two guys arguing near the trailer. To their left will be a receipt. Pick it up and read the name circled on it since you will need to know it.\n\nNext, head behind the big trailer and throw up some graffiti on it.Head back to the bouncer and speak to him again. This time select the Back Talk option that says Let me inside, now. Select the following dialogue options to get inside.\n\nI thought we went over this. Isn’t it past your bedtime?\n\nYour bedtime?\n\nReal cute. But I still don’t know you.\n\nI don’t do ‘cute’.\n\nOk, kid. I get it, you’re tough.\n\nThis isn’t a playground.\n\nA girl like you… I can’t protect you in there.\n\nFlowers on your bike?\n\nLook. My boss decides who gets in, alright?\n\nWho’s your boss?\n\nAfter back talking to the bouncer, he'll lighten up and finally let you inside.\n\nAwake: old mill - interior\n\nOnce inside, head towards the music. This should lead you towards the left side of the bar. When you reach the crowd, the option will come up to push through. Select this option and it will trigger an event where you bump into two skeevy guys and cause one to spill his beer.\n\nIt doesn’t matter how you respond to this because you will inevitably interact with them later.Since you can’t get to the stage through the crowd, walk back into the front room and approach the guy sitting on the couch next to the stairs.\n\nHis name is Frank. Talk to him. When the first set up dialogue options come up, make sure to select “Who was that guy I pissed off?” Frank will bring up Damon (the name that was circled on the receipt outside.)\n\nYou’ll find out that Frank and Damon are connected somehow then another set of dialogue options will pop up. Select “Where do those stairs go?” He’ll give you a snarky answer but you can end your conversation here and head up the stairs.\n\nChloe will start enjoying the show but she’ll be interrupted by the two skeevy guys from early. They’ll want to start a fight with you and as things start to get intense, a girl named Rachel will come to your rescue.\n\nYour first decision with consequences will come up. You can choose to either Attack or Run.\n\nWhatever decision you make, you’ll escape the confrontation. Frank fends off the skeevy guys and you’ll enjoy the rest of the show with Rachel.\n\nAwake: price house - upstairs\n\nThe next morning, you’ll wake up in your room before school. Read your latest journal entry, and look at the picture to the right of your bed. Chloe will bring up seeing Rachel Amber at the show along with some other stuff.\n\nHer mom will call you down for breakfast. Head to the dresser near her bed and change her clothes. As you head out of the room, Chloe will mention that her phone is missing.\n\nAfter you leave her room, walk towards her mother’s room at the end of the hallway next to the stairs. Head straight towards the nightstand next to the bed. You’ll find her mother’s and she'll use it to call her own.\n\nLeave her room and walk towards the bathroom at the other end of the hall. Chloe’s phone will be to the left of the toilet under a towel. Once you grab her phone, her mom will ask you to grab her purse and phone.\n\nGo back into her mom’s room and walk to the right where the desk is. On the left side will be her purse. Once you grab this, you can head downstairs.\n\nAwake: Price House - Downstairs\n\nWhen you reach downstairs, walk all the towards the back of the house until you see the dining table to the left. Place Chloe’s mom’s purse on the table then walk into the kitchen and talk to her. She’s going to start lecturing you about a lot of things.\n\nYou can respond however you want until you reach the part where Chloe’s mom tells you that David will be taking you to school. Chloe’s response will be, “Are you serious? This is such…” and her mom will reply with, “What, Chloe? Such what?” You can choose to Be understanding or Say what you feel.\n\nOnce you finish talking to her mom, walk towards the back of the house again. Next to the sliding doors on the right is an ashtray with the keys her mom was talking about. Pick them up and head out the front door.\n\nOnce outside, Chloe will walk up to David who is fixing his car. He’ll ask you to go inside the garage and grab him a socket wrench. Head to the open garage and in the middle on the ground, there will be a small toolbox. Open it and there will be a socket wrench kit inside.\n\nTake it and bring it back to Dave. Speak to him for a little while more then he will finish fixing the car. He’ll put his toolbox in the garage and then take you to school.\n\nIn the car, Dave will try to lecture you. You have two options. You can choose the Back Talk action called Shut.This.Down. or Ignore and Endure.\n\nAfter that interaction, Chloe will have a dream about being in the car with her father. Look at the socket wrench in front of you and the purse to the left of you.\n\nSpeak to Chloe’s dad in the driver’s seat. Chloe will tell her dad to turn the music up. The dream sequence will end with a car accident.\n\nAwake: School Campus\n\nAfter you wake up, Dave will drop you off at school. The first person you bump into is a boy named Eliot who’ll ask you about the night before. He’ll then invite you to a play at school called The Tempest. Choose your response wisely since it impacts your relationship with him in the game.\n\nYou’ll immediately get a text from a girl named Steph. She has a DVD for you and is sitting at the picnic tables with a boy named Mikey. Take a right at the water fountain and walk straight until you see 2 people sitting at a picnic table to the left.\n\nSteph will give you the DVD and ask you about your night with Rachel Amber. She’ll then invite you to join her and Mikey in their tabletop game. This will not impact your game but is pretty fun to participate. It can take about 20-30 minutes.\n\nOnce that’s over, head back to the front of the school. You’ll find a boy named Nathan Prescott being picked on by another jock called Drew North. While it’s going down, a friend of Nathan’s will ask you to do something. You will be prompted to Stay Out or Step in.\n\nAfter the immediate outcome of your choice takes place, Rachel Amber will pop out of the front doors of the school and drag you inside.\n\nAwake: School Drama Lab\n\nRachel will take you to the theater room where students are practicing lines to the upcoming play. As the students and teacher begin discussing the scene they were just practicing lines for, Rachel will ask you for your opinion on the character Miranda and her feelings for Ferdinand.\n\nThe question is: Are Miranda’s feelings of instant passion for Ferdinand just inexperience and dramatic circumstances or… has she actually just met the love of her life? Your options will be Miranda’s an idiot or It’s true love.\n\nThe group will break up and Rachel will run to the back to get changed. She’ll ask you to grab her belt from her bag. Turn to the left and walk all the way to the back of the classroom to find her bag. Inside, you’ll find a picture of Rachel as a little girl with her dad in the woods. Then you’ll grab Rachel’s belt.\n\nOnce you have the belt, walk to the changing room on the opposite side of the room (Rachel went into earlier.) Inside the room, turn to the right and walk towards to the room divider to give Rachel the belt. When she finishes changing, she’ll start talking to you about the night before.\n\nShe will then ask you to join her on a little field trip and Chloe will go with her to ditch class.\n\nAwake: Train\n\nYou’ll jump onto a moving train with Rachel and she’ll ask you to pull up a chair and check out the view. Behind you will be some cargo that you can move and sit on. Chloe will be nervous but Rachel will break the ice pretty quickly.\n\nYou’ll talk to her for a bit until she proposes you play a game called Two Truths and a Lie. It’s up to you if you want to play by the rules. After playing the game, Chloe will mention wanting to listen to music. A choice that impacts your relationship with Rachel will come up. You can choose to Share with Rachel or Listen alone.\n\nA scenic sequence will commence. Press shift anytime to end it. Chloe will compliment Rachel on her bracelet and Rachel will reveal that she wants to leave Blackwell. Chloe will offer to be an accomplice. Shortly after, you’ll arrive at your destination and Rachel will tell you to jump off the train. Another important choice that affects your relationship with Rachel comes up. You can choose to Jump or say No way.\n\nAwake: Overlook\n\nYou and Rachel will arrive at a park. Chloe will follow her to a vantage point where there are two viewfinders. She’ll challenge you to another game and this time it involves spying on people in the park.\n\nWhen she puts the quarter into the viewer, you’ll both discover that it’s out of order. Rachel will get visibly upset and ask you if you have a spare quarter. Chloe will confess she doesn’t but she’ll offer to Macgyver the situation.\n\nChoose to have Chloe investigate the viewfinder then speak to Rachel. She will give you a nail file but don’t use it on the viewfinder. Turn to face the opposite direction of the viewfinders and walk towards the right. You'll see a couple of benches in the distance. Pass by the first bench and head towards the bench next to the trash can.\n\nOn that bench will be a metal dedication plate. Use the nail file to unscrew it. Bring the dedication plate back to the broken viewfinder and have Chloe use it to pry it open. She’ll be able to retrieve the quarter and give it to Rachel.\n\nRachel will insert the quarter into the other viewfinder and set the rules for the game: Spy on people and act out what they’re saying and thinking. When you look through the viewfinder, you’ll see a woman standing alone in a dress. Ignore her and move the viewfinder all the way to the right.\n\nStart by looking at the various people throughout the park, slowly making your way back to where that woman was standing.There will be a father and son grilling. After looking at them, Rachel will bring the viewfinder back to the woman who will be meeting with a man.\n\nChloe will watch the two make out passionately and will make some funny commentary about it. When Chloe turns around, Rachel will be standing with her back turned to her. Chloe will ask her if she’s alright. Rachel will turn around and ask why you two aren’t drunk yet since you both have been ditching for hours.\n\nShe’ll propose to get drunk and you can respond to her with I’m in or I’m still hungover. Regardless of what you say, she’ll lead you to a couple in the woods who are enjoying a picnic. They’ll have a bottle of wine that Rachel wants to steal it from them. Despite Chloe offering to go to a liquor store, Rachel will insist on taking the wine.\n\nShe’ll walk by the couple and pretend to faint. Walk towards the bottle of wine. The couple will acknowledge Chloe every time you try to steal it so you will have to initiate Back Talk by selecting the Help Rachel dialogue option. Put on your best acting skills to take the couple’s attention away from you long enough to steal the wine.\n\nEven if you do a terrible job, you’ll still be able to get it. Once you both have the alcohol, Rachel will offer you some. After you reply, she’ll take a giant swig out of the bottle and talk about being excessively sober. She'll begin walking deeper into the woods and Chloe will follow her.\n\nAwake: Junkyard\n\nThe next scene will cut to both of them hanging out by the train tracks. Chloe will point out the cool junk yard. Rachel will call it a pile of trash and Chloe will respond with \"Uh, Yeah, an awesome pile of trash. Let’s explore.\"\n\nRachel will turn down her offer then walk away to sit down. At this point, Chloe will acknowledge that Rachel has been acting weird and standoffish. Walk over to her and select the Call her out option. The two will start to bicker but Rachel will still keep pushing Chloe away until she smashes the wine bottle.\n\nChloe will find a baseball bat in the junkyard. You can choose to Give Rachel the bat or Give Rachel a show. Rachel will respond with \"I asked you to leave me alone.\" Chloe will get fed up and tell her off. Rachel will begin to leave but Chloe will call her back. She’ll say she doesn’t want to ruin what they have and Rachel will ask \"And what is 'this' exactly?\"\n\nThe two will get back to arguing and Rachel will finally leave with a \"Goodbye, Chloe.\" Chloe will get super upset and pick up the bat again. A sequence will initiate that lets you smash various objects in the junkyard.\n\nSmash the bottle, sign, mannequin, box of junk, and toolbox. Chloe will beat up on a truck and continue to lash out until she notices a car in the junkyard that looks exactly like the one her father got into the car accident with. Smash the hood of the car continuously until another dream sequence triggers.\n\nChloe will be in the back of her dad’s car yet again but this time she will be surrounded with various items. Look at each item in the car: the poster, the wine bottle, and the mannequin head. Each time, Chloe's dad will say something to you about the fight you got into with Rachel. Rachel will eventually show up outside of the car and place her hand on the window. She’ll ignite into flames and a train will hit the car.\n\nChloe will wake up in the backseat of the car in the junkyard. At this point, it will be night time and she’ll walk towards the train tracks.\n\nAwake: Overlook Night\n\nChloe will find Rachel standing next to a tree and she’ll look like she’s been crying. Rachel will say she wants to tell you something. You can respond however you want here but she’ll tell you about the couple you saw earlier through the viewfinder. She’ll confess that the man was her father and that the woman he was with was not her mother.\n\nThe two will talk for a bit. Rachel will pull out the picture you found in her bag at the school earlier of her and her dad. She’ll tell you how she broke her arm that day and how her father carried her down the mountain. She'll talk about how much of a huge comfort he was to her that day and how she trusted him.\n\nAfterwards, she will apologize to Chloe. The two will continue to talk until Rachel says, \"What I wouldn’t give to leave this place and never look back…\" Chloe will respond with \"So if I came to you tomorrow and told you to pack your bags...\"\n\nRachel will say she’s serious about the offer and Chloe will take her up on it. Rachel will then pull out the picture again and ask for your lighter. She’ll light the picture on fire and throw into a trash can. As she watches it burn, Chloe will say \"Come on.\" Rachel won't budge and instead, kicks the trash can over and screams.\n\nThe tree next to the trash will catch on fire. Chloe will nervously stand there and watch with Rachel as the entire forest catches on fire. The game will cut to a bunch of different scenes involving various characters as they all watch the fire burning in the distance.
