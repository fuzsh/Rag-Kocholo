It was a great group of studentsâ€”truly, just great. I like to leave each class with a list of resources to continue their leadership journey. I have a few of my favorites, including newsletters (The Hustle and Pour Over) and Podcasts (the Wall Street Breakfast and WSJ What's News). What are your favorite ways to stay educated on current events from a leadership perspective?\n\nMiddle TN Friends! This is for you! Summer is flying by, and if you're like many of us, you might have a list of to-dos that still need to be tackled. Whether it's knocking out your to-do list without distractions, getting your certification hours in before December, or finally making those important appointments, now is the time to act. Let me share a story with you: I always loved flying on planes because it was the best time to be productive. No one to bother me, headphones in, no text messages, calls, or drop-bys. It was a rare moment when no one needed me, and I could focus entirely on my tasks. That's the kind of environment we're creating for our Day of Accountability with Small Town Startup. Join me for a focused day of productivity and accountability. Let's work together to make sure you finish the summer strong and set yourself up for success in the months ahead. Imagine what you could accomplish with a dedicated day to focus on your goals! Don't let the summer slip away without making progress on the things that matter most. Ready to get started? Let's do this together! ðŸŒŸ https://lnkd.in/eyTSqpaf #AccountabilityDay #Productivity #GoalSetting #EndSummerStrong\n\nThank you Jacquelynda Cook, MBA, Laura Ferguson Mimms, Elliott Kershaw, and Zach Evans for being panelists in my Values-Based Leadership Class at Lipscomb University College of Business. After the panel, I asked the class what their one takeaway was, here was their answer: Donâ€™t stress so much about grades but more so put time into the experience - from Jacquelynda Cook FEAR - false, expectations, appearing, real - from Elliott Kershaw Leadership is intimate work. You have to know yourself first before you can lead others. - Laura Ferguson Mimms If it ever becomes easy to make hard choices with people, you probably shouldnâ€™t lead - Zach Evans\n\nI am looking for two individuals who are willing to assist one of my students in my Introduction to Business class this summer. The student is a cybersecurity major and needs to complete a networking assignment. The time commitment would be approximately 15 minutes via phone or Zoom. The ideal candidates would be professionals currently working in or with experience in cybersecurity. They should be able to answer some basic questions about the field suitable for a college freshman. If that's you and you have time in the next couple of weeks, message me or comment below, and I'll be in touch.\n\nI'm putting together a list of tips and tricks for my grad class on keeping notes related to reading class material. I would love your suggestions. I've used a combo of Goodreads, Readwise, and Evernote. Goodreads to mark the books I've read and keep up with my yearly reading challenge. Readwise to sync highlights from Kindle. And Evernote for more long-form thoughts. I'm sure there's more I'm unaware of, and I would love to include it. How do you keep up with your notes from books you've read?\n\nI love Small Town Startup and this week I had the opportunity to present at their second Mastermind for small business owners on Influence and Persuasion. Based right where I live in Robertson County, Small Town Startup, is a game-changer for small businesses. They go beyond just getting you started; they help you thrive and succeed in todayâ€™s competitive market. From innovative marketing strategies to personalized support, they have everything you need to turn your business dreams into reality. For all the small business owners looking to make a big impact, I can't recommend them enough! ðŸ’¼âœ¨ And if you're thinking about starting a business, they can help you refine your idea and make it happen. Plus, they offer a co-working space, perfect for those who need a quiet place to work (shoutout to working moms in the summer!). As promised to those who attended Tuesday's Mastermind, today's Management Minute Newsletter will feature content on winning hearts and minds through persuasion. If youâ€™re interested, sign up here: http://eepurl.com/iHgDGo newsletter will go out later today.
