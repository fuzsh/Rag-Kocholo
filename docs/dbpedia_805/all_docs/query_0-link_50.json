        "text": "ABC's \"Nashville\" finished filming its third season last week, but the TV show's stars are still hard at work.\n\nOn Monday morning, Charles Esten — who plays country singer Deacon Claybourne on the prime-time drama — was singing and strumming at the Grand Ole Opry House, backed by a band of Music City pros.\n\nEsten and many of his castmates are getting ready for their second annual \"Nashville\" concert tour, which kicks off Wednesday with two sold-out shows at the Beacon Theatre in New York City. It will stop in nine cities, including Philadelphia, Boston, Washington, D.C., and Los Angeles, before closing May 10 in Phoenix.\n\nWhile many cast members perform at the Opry and other local venues year-round, getting to take the stage elsewhere around the country is a rare treat for them, as well as their fans.\n\nCast member Clare Bowen (Scarlett) thought back to the first show of their inaugural tour in 2014. She was singing her character's \"Black Roses,\" but thought she was getting some sound interference on stage. She soon realized that she was actually hearing the entire audience singing along with her.\n\n\"That's kind of when I realized that's how much we reach people,\" she said. \"It's just wild.\"\n\nIt was a thrilling moment offstage for \"Nashville\" executive producer Steve Buchanan, who created the tour to promote the show as well as the city. The tour is hitting many of the country's largest TV markets and has teamed with local ABC affiliates to offer travel promotions. It also will rally viewers at a crucial time — just before ABC will decide whether to renew the show for a fourth season.\n\n\"(The tour) is one of the things that we can do unlike any other series that is on the network,\" Buchanan said. \"And given that opportunity, it's something we should take full advantage of. Not only is that beneficial to the television property, but it's beneficial to the destination.\"\n\nLast week, Esten and Bowen shot their third season finale for \"Nashville,\" and once again left the set without knowing if they'd ever get to return. Esten is \"cautiously optimistic\" about a season 4.\n\n\"I don't get to say how long this goes,\" he said. \"Other people get to say that. I only get to say how deep it is, for me. So that's why I dig in as deep as I can, every single day, not just into the role, the show and music, but also this town.\"\n\nLike Esten, Bowen has purchased a home in the Nashville area and also is embarking on a recording career. She \"can't help but be positive\" about the future of \"Nashville.\"\n\n\"I just can't see it ending,\" she said. \"It makes people so happy.\"\n\n\"Nashville\" airs Wednesdays at 9 p.m. CT on ABC. Its season 3 finale airs May 13.\n\nReach Dave Paulson at 615-664-2278 and on Twitter at @ItsDavePaulson."
