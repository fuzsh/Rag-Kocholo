        "text": "Have you ever wondered how Nashville, Tennessee earned its moniker as Music City USA? What's so special about the music scene in Nashville that it warrants being the capital of continental music culture? Haven't just as many musicians passed through cities like Las Vegas and New York? The story of Music City is one of Tennessee's most interesting facts. Here's what you need to know.\n\nThe History of Music in Nashville\n\nWell, Tennessee has been known for some world-class fiddlin' all the way back since its roots in the 1700s, but it really started to earn recognition in 1824 when a hymnal, called Western Harmony, was published out of Nashville. The hymnal's popularity spread like wildfire and set the scene for Nashville's later musical significance.\n\nFast forward to the late 1800s, when what is now known as Ryman Auditorium first began to draw crowds. It quickly became one of the country's premier auditoriums because of its phenomenal natural acoustics and by-then-central location. It didn't take long for Ryman Auditorium to become recognized as the Carnegie Hall of the South.\n\nIn 1925, Nashville's position of national significance cemented when radio station WSM chose Ryman Auditorium as its Grand Ole Opry radio show. Today the Grand Ole Opry is the oldest still-running live radio show in existence, which should also tell you something about the demand for country music and its quality.\n\nFinally, we come to the year 1950 when Nashville was officially dubbed Music City USA by WSM's announcer at the time, David Cobb; the name stuck, and that's how we see the city today. Many people make the mistake of assuming that the name primarily refers to country music, but this actually isn't the case at all. Nashville always has been and always will be a diverse and open musical culture… From jazz to bluegrass to country to R&B to rock to gospel, Nashville has had a hand in it all.\n\nThe musicians who move to Nashville to further their career in music bring with them all their local and cultural traditions, which then go towards the rich cosmopolitan melting pot of all the Nashville residents. The relocation of the Nissan headquarters to Franklin also added to the influx of Californians who have all brought their own pice of the LA lifestyle. It's no coincidence that the number of restaurants has dramatically increased!\n\nIn short, Music City USA earns and keeps its name because, unlike other big cities in the USA, music isn't just part of the culture; it IS the culture.\n\nNashville is known by many as Music City, but many residents and visitors don't know why. Of course, the music scene is booming within the city, and that is part of the reason. However, there are many other reasons for the name Music City.\n\nThe History of the \"Music City\" Name for Nashville\n\nWhen the city was settled in the late 1700s, it was quickly celebrated with fiddle tunes and buck dancing. Davy Crocket was the first celebrity of the city, and he was a fiddle player with all types of colorful stories.\n\nThe 1800s brought more reasons for the nickname of Music City. Nashville grew and became a national place for music publishing. Fisk Jubilee Singers came from Nashville's Fisk University, and they were the first musical act to tour around the world. The Queen of England may have been the first to call Nashville the \"Music City.\" She said that the Fisk Jubilee Singers must come from the \"Music City.\"\n\nThe Famous Music Venues in Nashville\n\nThroughout the history of the city, many music venues have been added to the landscape.
