        "text": "MaryLand is a moving portrait of sisterhood that’s full of heart and fiercely relatable. Watch the official trailer, and find out about episodes, the powerhouse cast, and the immersive plot, which the Independent (UK) says “recalls, at times, projects like Broadchurch, Bad Sisters, and Mrs. Wilson.”\n\nGet updates on everything coming to MASTERPIECE when you subscribe to our email newsletter.\n\n1.\n\nWhat’s MaryLand about?\n\nWhat first strikes you as a potential thriller is actually a finely observed relationship drama with a love story between two siblings at its core. Estranged adult sisters Becca and Rosaline are reunited when they learn their mother Mary’s body was found on the Isle of Man. Becca is pulled from a busy family life where she’s had little time to think about herself, while the more controlling and driven Rosaline must drop everything involved in her high-flying London career.\n\nArriving in a place they’ve never visited and with no idea why their mother was there, these polar opposites begin to unravel the long-held secrets of a woman they thought they knew, while keeping their own secrets from each other. Confined on the island and forced to face the life-changing consequences of their mum’s decisions, will sisters Becca and Rosaline get a chance to reframe their relationship or close the door on it for good?\n\nMaryLand is “a chamber piece about family dynamics, female identity and ways of finding freedom before it is too late,” says The Guardian (UK). “It is a joy.”\n\n2.\n\nWho’s in the MaryLand Cast?\n\nYou will come to deeply admire the two affecting leads in MaryLand if you don’t already. Suranne Jones (Gentleman Jack, Doctor Foster, Scott & Bailey) co-created MaryLand and takes the role of younger married sister Becca. Eve Best (The Crown Season 8, House of the Dragon, Nurse Jackie) co-stars as Rosaline, the career-focused older sibling based in London. They’re joined by Oscar® nominated Stockard Channing (The Good Wife, The West Wing, Grease) as Cathy, their mum’s larger-than-life friend on the island, among others.\n\n“Jones and Best excel in toeing the nuances of the dysfunctional tightrope of sisterhood—their chemistry is easy, and their bickering and rage feel comfortingly familiar,” says The Standard (UK). “Another standout performance comes from Stockard Channing.”\n\n3.\n\nWhen is MaryLand airing on MASTERPIECE?\n\nMaryLand debuted on MASTERPIECE on PBS Sunday, May 5, 2024. You can see full episodes any time when you watch with PBS Passport, an added PBS station member benefit.\n\n4.\n\nHow Many Episodes in MaryLand?\n\nThe sisters’ transformational journey plays out over three one-hour episodes. The depth, complexity, and love contained in just three installments is a real achievement. Waiting for each new episode will be devilishly hard in this case.\n\nEpisode 1 | May 5, 2024 at 9/8c\n\nEstranged sisters Becca and Rosaline receive shocking news about their mother. They fly to the Isle of Man to find out more.\n\nEpisode 2 | May 12, 2024 at 9/8c\n\nAs revelations surrounding Mary’s death come in thick and fast, Becca and Rosaline seek solace in different directions.\n\nEpisode 3 | May 19, 2024 at 9/8c\n\nRichard and Jim descend on Bayview. While the family tries to heal and reconnect, the fallout from Mary’s actions continue to reverberate.\n\n5.\n\nWhere was MaryLand Filmed?\n\nWhile the story is set on the Isle of Man, filming happened in various Ireland locations including Howth Peninsula east of Dublin and the Isle of Wight, according to ITV News. “It was just so beautiful to be there on location rather than in a studio,” says actor Eve Best who portrays sister Rosaline. “The presence of the sea itself at the end of a hard day is very soothing. It was a lovely place to be and a lovely team to work with. I found myself looking in a lot of real estate windows.”\n\nWhere exactly is the real Isle of Man and who governs it? The 33-mile-long island sits in the middle of the Irish Sea, off the northwest coast of England. It’s roughly equidistant between England, Ireland, Scotland, and Wales. The Isle of Man “is a unique self-governing kingdom; a Crown dependency belonging to neither the UK nor the European Union, [and] boasts its own parliament, laws, traditions and culture,” according to Historic UK.\n\n6.\n\nWatch the Official MaryLand Trailer\n\nCheck out the trailer for MaryLand and start making a list of everyone you want to share it with.\n\nMASTERPIECE Newsletter\n\nSign up to get the latest news on your favorite dramas and mysteries, as well as exclusive content, video, sweepstakes and more.\n\nEnter Your Email Address\n\n*** START *** The plugin meta info in content-specialfeature.php:\n\n*** END **********************************************************************"
