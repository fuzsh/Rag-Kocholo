        "text": "The mid-season return of CMT's Nashville hits airwaves in less than 24 hours. So-called \"Nashies\" have been eagerly anticipating its return following the death of series star Rayna Jaymes (played by Connie Britton) in the first half of Season 5. Based on the trailer for the back half of the season, it doesn't appear Britton's departure will have much of an impact on the show's drama—or its popularity among superfans. Although the character of Rayna anchored the show, the charm of the series has long been the strength of its ensemble cast, which continues to shine even in the absence of Britton's character.\n\nCMT (in partnership with Hulu, the series' longtime SVOD partner) announced almost exactly a year ago that it would pick up the show following a cancellation by ABC. Despite a decline in ratings numbers from the ABC days, Nashville has become the highest-rated and most-watched show in CMT's history, averaging 2.1 million L+7 viewers per episode. Although not as high as the network viewership at ABC (which averaged between 4 and 5 million viewers), those numbers helped CMT notch the biggest year-over-year growth for any Top 50 cable channel in the first quarter of the year.\n\nCMT announced in April that Nashville has been picked up for a sixth season. At 16 episodes, Season 6 will be the shortest in the show's history—each previous season of the show has featured 21 or 22 episodes. The network has launched impressive promotional campaigns for the show and frequently plugs cast regulars into its other properties. Fan favorite Charles Eston will host the CMT Awards on June 7, and other cast members will likely make appearances. New faces headed to the Nashville set include stars Rachel Bilson (The OC, Hart of Dixie) and Kaitlyn Doubleday (Empire) as regulars and Jeff Nordling (Big Little Lies) in a multi-episode recurring role."
