        "text": "This handbook will help you tackle all the variables involved in starting your first podcast from the ground up. Feel free to bookmark this article and use it as a directory to refer back to when you want to read up more on a specific element of the podcasting process.Â\n\nâ\n\nReady to press play on your podcasting dreams?\n\nâ\n\nThe basics\n\nBefore jumping into this tutorial, letâs start by covering the basics and getting you up to speed with Spotify for Podcasters.\n\nâ\n\nWhat is a podcast?\n\nLetâs be real. Most of us have a general understanding of what a podcast is (a collection of digital audio or video files that are made available for audiences), but as we enter the podcast world ourselves, more questions start popping up.Â\n\nâ\n\nA podcast can be many different thingsâand it all depends on you, the creator. A podcast can be:Â\n\nâ\n\nOne person speaking into a microphone (or even their phoneâs mic) alone in their apartment or podcast studio\n\nA pair of friends or a group of five\n\nIt can be serious, funny, boisterous, cerebral, quirky, sarcastic, or a little bit of everything.Â\n\nBut in its simplest form, a podcast needs two things: an idea, and a voice to bring it to life. Plus, now that video podcasts on Spotify are available to more creators than ever, the answer to âwhat is a podcast?â has expanded even further.\n\nâ\n\nWhat is a video podcast, and should I try making one?\n\nVideo podcasts on Spotify bring the mediums of video and audio together in perfect harmony. Where available, this feature allows current video creators (or audio-only podcasters!) to expand their reach to new fans on Spotify, and deepen their connections with current fans. Itâs as easy as uploading a video file via Spotify for Podcasters, and it gets published right to Spotifyâthen your audience can choose to watch or listen in the background, so they can enjoy your episodes wherever they go.\n\nâ\n\nWhy should I start a podcast?\n\nEvery voice is a podcast voiceâand yes, that includes yours. Whether you want to use your voice to create, express, or build, podcasting is the perfect way to say it all. It also helps that podcasting continues to grow as a medium: More people than ever are creating audio (and now video) stories. Even if you already have a fan base from a different hustle, podcasting can help you expand your reach and connect with your audience in a deeper, more authentic way.Â\n\nâ\n\nWhat is Spotify for Podcasters?\n\nSpotify for Podcasters is a free platform that helps creators distribute, grow, and monetize their show â all from our app or website. Get powerful tools to connect directly with fans, understand how your podcast gets discovered, and stand out on the worldâs most popular listening platform.\n\nâ\n\nIf you already have a podcast hosted elsewhere, you can still take advantage of Spotify's free growth tools for podcasters, like analytics and fan engagement. You can do this by claiming your show on Spotify for Podcasters. Claiming your show does not change ownership over your content or off-platform management. Get started in minutes.Â\n\nâ\n\nWhy should I use Spotify for Podcasters?\n\nSimply put, Spotify for Podcasters is the most comprehensive tool for growing your podcast. You can use Spotify for Podcasters to, distribute, analyze, and grow your show as well as gain access to exclusive earning tools and formats like video podcasts on Spotify. You might be wondering, is it really free? And it isâweâve made Spotify for Podcasters free for everyone, all the time. So go ahead, focus on your content and weâll take care of the rest.Â\n\nâ\n\nWhat do you need to start a podcast?\n\nThe good news is, starting a podcast is not as complex as you might think. All you need to do is nail down a couple of foundational elements, and youâll be ready to get your show on the road.Â\n\nâ\n\nCheck out some quick tips in our video, and dive deeper below:\n\nâ\n\nChoose a podcast topic\n\nPicking a podcast topic requires you to look inward and answer a simple question: What do you love to talk about? One way to answer this question is to think about when youâre the most happy, fulfilled, or excitedâand use that as a jumping-off point. You could even think about what podcasts you currently enjoy listening to, and use those for inspiration. It might also help to think about a podcast topic broad enough to cover many episodes, or perhaps even multiple seasons.\n\nâ\n\nHere are a couple of podcast ideas to get your wheels turning on a podcast topic if youâre not sure where to begin:\n\nâ\n\nCheck out our article featuring podcast topic advice from four experienced creators and let them guide your initial process\n\nLook for trending podcast topics within your broader areas of interest. This will help you produce relevant and timely content while also providing inspiration when youâre experiencing a creative dry spell (it happens to all of us!).Â Â Â\n\nDetermine a podcast format\n\nThere are several podcast formats to choose from, and itâs important to pick the right one for you. Ask yourself the following: Do I see myself podcasting solo, or with one or maybe more friends or co-hosts? Do I want to interview guests with expertise in specific areas? Do I want to talk about reality, or make up a fantastical world of my own?Â\n\nâ\n\nAll of these things are worth considering, but you can dive even deeper with our complete guide to podcast formats. And if youâre rolling the cameras, there are plenty of ways to get inspired for a unique video podcast, too.Â\n\nâ\n\nConsider your podcast audience and how youâll reach them\n\nDefining your ideal audience is the first step in the journey toward building a loyal base of listeners whoâll engage with you and your show. Consider:\n\nâ\n\nYour niche\n\nThe kinds of people who would be interested in consuming content about it\n\nHow you can best reach them.\n\nFor an in-depth guide about the early stages of finding potential listeners, check out our resource on how to discover your podcast target audience.\n\nâ\n\nKeep in mind that no matter who you are, your podcast audience will start off small, and thatâs okay. Every successful podcast had to start somewhere. Itâs important to begin with simple goals in mindâthings like getting to know yourself as a creator, getting to know your listeners, and connecting with them through avenues on social media, like TikTok or Instagram. What feels like little steps will lead to big accomplishments, like getting your first 100 listeners.Â\n\nâ\n\nHow to choose your podcast equipment\n\nYou can use your computer to record solo, or bring in your favorite guests to record audio or video interviews right on our Spotify for Podcasters website through our new integration with Riverside - an excellent platform that offers powerful, AI-driven recording and editing tools used by creators of all sizes.\n\nâ\n\nHowever, thereâs also a wide variety of podcast microphones (from XLR to USB microphones) available to enhance your audio recording setup and improve audio quality. If youâre interested in exploring podcast tech beyond your phone, head out to our complete podcast equipment guide for creators, where we touch on everything from recording software to pop filters and cables. Curious to know how you can elevate the recording environment even further? Read our guide on how to set up your podcast studio for the best results.\n\nâ\n\nHow to develop your podcast branding\n\nYou are unique, and so is your podcast. And the way you convey that unique identity to your listeners is through podcast branding. From your podcast cover art to your podcast description, intro theme, and even your podcast trailer, every element associated with your podcast comes together to establish the tone and character of your show. The visual and audio identity these elements express are what sets your podcast apart and makes it top of mind for listeners.\n\nâ\n\nChoose a podcast name\n\nNaming your podcast can be a tricky thing, but luckily we've put together a resource on how to choose a great podcast name to make it easier. Your podcastâs name has the potential to make your show exponentially more memorable and appealingâor not.Â\n\nâ\n\nPro-tip: you donât actually need to add the word âpodcastâ. Here are a couple of podcast name ideas to help you nail this aspect of your podcast identity.\n\nâ\n\nCreate a signature podcast intro and outro\n\nBoth your podcast intro and outro are key elements of your podcast. A standout podcast intro is your chance to make a great first impression and hook listeners enough that they stick around until the end (and come back for future episodes!). A memorable outro is how you end a podcast on a high note and keep listeners engaged and connected.\n\nâ\n\nIntros and outros are also uniquely your own. Theyâre a chance to reinforce your identity, your topic, your name, and encourage your audience to do something that will help your show grow. You can accomplish the latter through calls-to-action (CTAs)â for example, asking listeners to rate your show, leave their thoughts in the comments, participate in polls, follow your social media accounts, or tell their friends and family about your podcast. Just make sure you stick to one CTA so you donât overwhelm the audience with too many options and they end up doing nothing.\n\nâ\n\nHow to makeÂ a podcast episode\n\nThe process of creating a podcast episode begins before you hit record and ends long after you step away from the microphone. From scripting all the way to editing, here are the key steps to put together a podcast episode youâll be proud of.\n\nâ\n\nPre-production\n\nNothing wrong with winging an episode, especially if inspiration strikes at a random moment! But a surefire way to both keep your podcast consistent and maintain your quality standards is to stay one step ahead. Use the pre-production stage to plan. Think about:\n\nâ\n\nThe topics you want to discuss\n\nThe guests you want to interview\n\nWhat a new potential listener might want to hear.Â\n\nA podcast schedule can help you stay on top of your tasks and manage your podcast workflow to the best of your ability. Using a podcast planning template during pre-production is also a great strategy to anticipate tasks that need to be completed and when, like writing an episode script or reaching out to potential guests.\n\nâ\n\nIf you do plan on having a guest, itâs a good idea to brainstorm a few questions before recording. But as our article on writing great interview questions points out, itâs a balancing act: a combination of being prepared but flexible at the same time. Once youâre sitting with a guest recording an episode, anything could happen. As a podcast host, your ability to switch gears is crucial. But of course, there are ways to increase your chances of an A-plus interview, like asking open-ended questions, following up on interesting points, and doing your research beforehand.Â\n\nâ\n\nPodcast recording\n\nYouâve done your planning, and now youâre ready for the next step. When youâre thinking about podcast recording, the location might not be the first thing you consider, but it can make or break your episode. People record from so many different placesâthe living room, bedroom (or bed), the closet, the at-home studioâbut sound quality is important.Â\n\nâ\n\nTry creating an acoustically-friendly environment free of background noise, echoes and other distractions. If you find yourself in a bind, our integrated Riverside Magic Tools can erase noise and improve your recording, even in noisier places like a coffee shop or the back of a car. And if youâre making a video podcast, be sure to consider your visual setup as well.\n\nBefore you start recording your first episode, pause and make sure youâre set up for success:\n\nÂ\n\nIs your recording equipment ready?Â\n\nAre your devices charged?\n\nIs your script or outline where you can see it?Â\n\nHow is your Wi-Fi connection?Â\n\nIf you have guests youâll interview remotely, are they ready with a quiet space to record and good WiFi signal, too?Â\n\nIf youâre filming a video podcast, are your lights and cameras placed correctly?Â\n\nTake a moment to consider the details, then take the most important step of all: press record.Â\n\nâ\n\nPodcast editing and post-production\n\nOnce your episode is recorded, then itâs time to edit. Podcast audio editing can be a challenge for many new podcasters who arenât familiar or experienced with podcast editing software.Â Â There are certainly better ways to edit than others. Thatâs why we chatted with two Spotify producers to explain the most important editing dos and donâts. They cover topics like goal-oriented editing, assembling your tools, and creative audio storytelling. Making a video podcast? Weâve got you covered with video-specific editing tips.Â\n\nâ\n\nAt the editing stage, you can add extra audio files to your episodes to make them pop and elevate the listening experience, like sound effects and music.\n\nâ\n\nPost-production is also when you put the finishing touches on each episodeâs brandingânamely, the episode title, podcast artwork (though episode-specific artwork isnât required, rather a nice to have), and description. For the latter, start by thinking about the essence of your episode: what keywords come to mind? These could be certain words that jump off the page and grab your attention, or they could be specifics like topics or guest names. This advice and much moreâlike episode length, optimization, and consistencyâcan be found in our article about writing the perfect podcast episode description.Â\n\nâ\n\nHow to distribute your podcast\n\nNow that you have your first batch of episodes ready, itâs time to share them with the world.Â\n\nâ\n\nAn essential first step is publishing your podcast to Spotify and the many other podcast directories where people tune in to their favorite shows . You distribute your podcast via your podcast hosting service, the place where your podcast audio and information lives. Most hosting sites generate something called a podcast RSS feed. A feed functions like your podcastâs unique ID, and is what you use to share your podcast on other directories.Â\n\nâ\n\nEvery podcast episode created with Spotify for Podcasters is automatically published to Spotify, which currently has over 100 million podcast listeners. Your show will also appear on every major podcast hosting platform as well, if you choose to distribute elsewhere.Â\n\nâ\n\nHow to promote your show with great podcast marketing\n\nPromotion isnât an afterthought. Things like capturing behind-the-scenes content and pinpointing the best clips to repurpose should be integrated with the overall creation process. This will make it a lot easier to get the marketing wheels turning when itâs time to promote a specific episode.Â\n\nâ\n\nHaving social accounts dedicated to promoting your podcast is maybe the easiest and most accessible way to market your showâand donât forget to cross-promote on your personal accounts as well. However, there are other ways to gain traction, including:Â\n\nâ\n\nCreating a podcast newsletter\n\nScoring press coverage (hereâs a straightforward guide to pitching your podcast, both to the press and beyond)\n\nLeveraging word of mouth (you never know who might be listening, so go ahead and spread the word)\n\nTaking advantage of outlets to network with other podcasters and finding promotion opportunities.\n\nConnecting with other creators has become easier with the help of Spotify for Podcastersâ Facebook Community. Other ways to network and get new eyes and ears on your podcast could be appearing as a guest on someone elseâs show, or doing a crossover episode with another podcaster.Â\n\nâ\n\nHow to grow your podcastÂ\n\nBelieve it or not, publication and marketing arenât the end of your podcast journey. With Spotify for Podcastersâ innovative tools and support on your side, each episode is a new opportunity to grow your audience, promote your show, and even monetize your podcast content (more on that later).Â\n\nâ\n\nThereâs a fully comprehensive guide to gaining momentum with your podcast growth right on our Resource hubâcovering topics like tracking your ratings, finding new global podcast listeners using analytics, and taking advantage of interactivity tools. Read on to learn more about how you can keep growing your podcast once you get a hang of the essentials.\n\nâ\n\nOptimize your podcast for growth\n\nIf you want to increase your chances of more fans finding you, then you need to prime your podcast for discovery. Start by optimizing your Spotify show page to get the attention of the millions of listeners who get their podcasting needs met by Spotify. Youâll also want to pay attention to your podcast SEO. The words you use in your podcast title, episode descriptions, show notes, podcast website, and more, play a significant role in how easy it is for listeners to find your podcast in directories and search engines.\n\nâ\n\nFind ways to boost audience engagement\n\nAs you grow your show, youâll want to develop a deeper connection with fans and really work towards building and retaining a loyal audience. Spotify for Podcasters has launched a number of in-app features that make engaging your fans feel as natural as talking to a friend. Among our favorite features to increase audience engagement are polls, which let you ask your fans quick survey questions and add them to any episode, and comments, with the ability to like and respond directly in the Spotify for Podcasters app.\n\nâ\n\nOf course, creators are always encouraged to interact with their fans through social media in their own distinct voice and style. All of this helps listeners feel even closer to the content they already love.\n\nâ\n\nLeverage analytics to measure success\n\nYouâre making an effort to promote your podcast and keep your audience engaged, but how do you know whether what youâre doing is actually working? At the end of the day, how do you measure podcast success?\n\nâ\n\nFirst, itâs important to define what success means for you and your show. New listeners? More subscribers? Increased audience engagement? Once you know what you want to measure and monitor, you can use Spotify for Podcastersâ analytics features to help you understand your episode performance.Â\n\nâ\n\nHereâs how to access your podcast analytics:Â\n\nâ\n\nLog into your Spotify for Podcasters dashboard.\n\nHead over to Catalog (for non-hosted users) or Analytics (for hosted users).Â\n\nYou can also view your analytics on your phone or tablet with Spotify for Podcastersâ mobile analytics. Now that youâre looking at the data, thereâs a few helpful ways to use it: things like using listener stats (age, gender, location) to inform your content, or using your most popular episodes as inspiration.\n\nâ\n\nKeep growing your podcast on Spotify\n\nSpotifyâs podcast editorial team is always looking for passionate new creators to feature. Put yourself out there by submitting your podcast to the editorial submission form, where up-and-coming shows are featured across one of Spotifyâs community destinations or in the New Releases section.\n\nâ\n\nHaving a podcast on Spotify is something to brag about, and luckily thereâs an easy way to do it: Promo Cards will generate personalized, Spotify-branded assets for you to share with fans on social. Simply search for your podcast name, choose your favorite color, and use your promo card to spread the word.Â\n\nâ\n\nHow to make money podcasting\n\nHave you ever wondered how creators make money podcasting? There are multiple ways you might go down that road, both within and outside of Spotify for Podcasters.Â\n\nâ\n\nA podcast subscription, for example, is a monetization model where listeners extend a monthly payment in exchange for subscriber-only content and other perks. If youâre curious about what that process entails, you can read about how two creators launched profitable subscriptions using Spotify for Podcasters.\n\nâ\n\nAdvertising is another popular vehicle for podcast monetization. You can leverage ads for your show through:\n\nâ\n\nHost-read ads, where you voice the ad yourself, and infuse your own personality into it (these ads are available on Spotify for Podcasters in certain countries)\n\nThird-party ads, where you insert sponsor-read advertisements into pre-selected show breaks.\n\nThere are other methods available to monetize your show, including listener donations, tipping, and merch. Each of those ways allows you to maintain control of your creative vision, while earning money in the process. Learn more about how you can monetize your podcast with Spotify.\n\nâ\n\nKeep your listeners close\n\nNo matter how much you grow, youâll want to keep your listeners engaged. You can use Fan Study or your Podcast Analytics to better understand your fans on Spotify. Seeing your stats is a good reminder that you arenât just publishing into a voidâyouâre building a community of real people with every new episode.Â\n\nâ"
