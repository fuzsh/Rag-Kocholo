        "text": "Even famous country singers get stage fright sometimes—or at least the ones who play them on TV.\n\nHayden Panettiere—who played country pop singer Juliette Barnes on all six seasons of Nashville from 2012 to 2018—recently recalled how petrified she was upon recording music for the show for the first time.\n\n\"I was not trained. Like, terrified, scared s--tless, shaking,\" Hayden exclusively told E! News' The Rundown. \"I walk in, apologizing to the producers already because I'm like, ‘Look, it's gonna take me a long time to warm up but I will get there. I will get it done, I promise.'\"\n\nThat's when things took a turn, and she had the most relatable reaction of all.\n\n\"They told me mid-session, ‘All the producers are going to stop by,'\" Hayden told host Erin Lim Rhodes. \"I almost puked, pooped, fainted. I think I called somebody and said, ‘Nobody told me,' hiccupping and crying.\"\n\nHayden would, of course, eventually become more comfortable and go on to record a long list of memorable songs for Nashville. Her track \"Telescope\" from the first season of the show even cracked the Billboard Country Songs Chart in 2012."
