        "text": "“Downton Abbey” creator Julian Fellowes chose the Newport Mansions to provide authentic scenery for his historical drama “The Gilded Age.” Scenes for the Emmy Award-winning Season 1 were filmed at The Breakers, Marble House, The Elms, Rosecliff, Chateau-sur-Mer and Hunter House. In 2022, scenes for Season 2 were filmed at Marble House, The Elms, Chateau-sur-Mer and Kingscote.\n\nSet in the 1880s, “The Gilded Age” tells the stories of “old money” New York elites and their escalating feud with nouveau riche neighbors who threaten the established social order.\n\nSpaces and features in the Newport Mansions directly inspired the sets created by “The Gilded Age” Production Designer Bob Shaw. Bertha Russell’s room is modeled after Alva Vanderbilt’s bedroom in Marble House, while the Marble House grand staircase with its ornate wrought-iron railing influenced its counterpart in the Russells’ mansion.\n\n“The Gilded Age” also draws upon the history and real-life people of the period. The parallels between the character Bertha Russell and Alva Vanderbilt of Marble House are striking. Alva famously manipulated the queen of New York society, Caroline Schermerhorn Astor, into attending her gala costume ball by refusing to invite Mrs. Astor’s daughter unless Mrs. Astor called upon her. Mrs. Astor called; the Astors then attended the Vanderbilt ball; and Alva secured her place in society. This true story is lifted from history in “The Gilded Age,” where Bertha Russell uses the same strategy.\n\nSee these magnificently preserved Gilded Age places in person!"
