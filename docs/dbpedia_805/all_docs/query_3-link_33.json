        "text": "Common podcast script elements\n\nScripting podcast segments is a great way to add structure to your show, even if the rest of the episode is ad-libbed.\n\nHere are some common elements you can use to customize your own template.\n\nIntro\n\nYour podcast intro lets you give listeners an overview of the episode up front and helps you capture your audience's attention at the outset.\n\nThe content of this segment will change from week to week, but the structure shouldn't vary much.\n\nExample: \"Hello and welcome to [podcast title], the show that [insert concept of show or tagline]. I'm [host name].\n\nIn today's episode, we will discuss [insert talking points] with [guest name]. We'll discuss the ins and outs of [episode topic] and offer listeners a special surprise at the end. Be sure to listen all the way through for the details!\"\n\nGuest intro\n\nJotting down some basic facts about your podcast guest helps establish rapport and get off to a strong start.\n\nExample: \"Our guest today is [guest name]. They are a [insert role, title, experience] with a passion for _______.\n\nThey're going to share with us [episode topic]. Hi, [guest first name]! Thanks so much for joining us!\"\n\nSponsor message\n\nSometimes podcast sponsors give hosts a script to read from verbatim, and other times the host crafts their own sponsor message.\n\nIt's important to create a quality sponsor message that kicks your show off well, reflects your sponsor's brand, and sounds natural.\n\nExample: \"[Your podcast name] is sponsored by [insert brand name]. [Sponsor] is a company that [describe company values and products as well as their relevance to your audience].\"\n\nSegue\n\nA well-placed segue can make your podcast flow between topic changes and help create a cohesive episode. Segues can be a phrase, sound effect, or musical jingle.\n\nSummary\n\nA good summary recaps the main points of your episode for listeners.\n\nMost podcasts cover a lot of information in one episode, and listeners appreciate it when hosts reiterate the key takeaways.\n\nOutro\n\nYou can use this section to make announcements, give a teaser for your next episode, play a closing jingle, or share resources to help listeners.\n\nExample: \"Next week, we'll continue to help you frame your podcast by helping you nail down the details that will give structure to your new podcast! [Outro music].\"\n\nCall to action (CTA)\n\nA call to action is an announcement that requires action from your audience. You can ask listeners to follow you on social media, leave a rating or review, etc.\n\nThe content of your CTA will change over time based on your sponsors, show content, and current merchandise.\n\nLimit your call to action to one clear thing you'd like from your audience. More than one CTA can overwhelm listeners.\n\nExample: \"Want to ask a question on a future episode of \"Podcasting Q&A\"? Click on the link in the show notes to record your question in a voicemail! [Outro music].\"\n\nPodcast script best practices\n\nFollow these tips to optimize your script and streamline your workflow!\n\nDo keyword research\n\nUsing a keyword research tool is a powerful way to get inside your listeners' minds. You can type your episode topic into one of these tools to see what questions your audience has about it.\n\nAnswer the Public\n\nGoogle Trends\n\nKeyword Generator\n\nUse dictation software\n\nSome people prefer to dictate their script rather than write it out. Here are some free speech-to-text tools we like:\n\nOtter.ai\n\nGoogle Docs Voice Typing Tool\n\nMicrosoft Dictate\n\nKeep it simple\n\nTry to keep your podcast template as simple as possible unless you need a word-for-word script.\n\nMost podcasters find that a flexible script is enough to keep them focused while still speaking in a natural, clear way.\n\nAdd delivery notes\n\nDelivery notes indicate how to present your written content, like where to add emphasis or pause for effect.\n\nThese notes can be helpful to make a fully scripted episode sound more natural.\n\nDo a dry-run\n\nYou don't have to rehearse your whole episode verbatim, but it's a good idea to do a quick run-through out loud to make sure it flows.\n\nYou can use your podcast script example PDF to practice in front of a mirror or record part of the episode using a voice recording app.\n\nFinal thoughts\n\nA good podcast outline can make episodes sound effortless to listeners and minimize recording mistakes that could take significant time to fix.\n\nWhichever podcast template you choose, the goal is to provide the amount of structure you need to effectively communicate your message and keep your audience listening!\n\nFollow Buzzsprout on YouTube for more podcasting tips, tricks, and tutorials!"
