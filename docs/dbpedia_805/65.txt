There’s 1,352 guitar pickers in Nashville – at least that’s what Steve Earle and the Lovin’ Spoonful said. Nashville is a music mecca, where hopefuls flock and fight for notoriety in a city that puts country crooners on the map (and the radio.) On television, Nashville delivers the lifeblood of its subject and then some: it’s a potent mix of concert and drama, with colorful accents and larger-than-life personalities to boot. And its music has been converting disinterested channel surfers since day one: Tracks for the first season were produced by T Bone Burnett, whose O Brother, Where Art Thou? soundtrack won five Grammys and who more recently produced the Inside Llewyn Davis LP. He’s since left the show, but Season Two’s transition to Buddy Miller as has been relatively seamless. These 22 tracks represent the program’s best performances to date.
