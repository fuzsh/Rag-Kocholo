        "text": "Russia is failing to address the gravity of torture use by authorities in Chechnya. That’s the conclusion of the Council of Europe’s anti-torture Committee.\n\nYesterday, the committee issued a public statement. It urges the Russian Federation to do more to investigate reports of atrocities and an anti-gay purge.\n\nLocated in the North Caucasus region, Chechnya is a subject of the Russian Federation.\n\nIts president is Ramzan Kadyrov, who has been in power since 2007. He tends to rule the country in accordance with traditional Islamic social codes, even if these contravene Russian law. Since late 2016, the country has arrested, detained and tortured LGBT citizens. Some men have disappeared, believed murdered.\n\nThere has been an international relief effort to help get LGBT people out of Chechnya. Political condemnation led Russian President Vladimir Putin in summer 2017 to say that Russia would investigate the reports. However, no action appears to have been taken.\n\nNew wave of atrocities\n\nIt was believed that international attention led to Chechnya halting its persecution of gay and bi people. However, late last year reports began to emerge that arrests had recommenced.\n\nThe full statement from the Council of Europe’s Committee for the Prevention of Torture and Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment (CPT) can be read here.\n\nThe CPT has issued statements on the use of torture in Chechnya on three previous occasions: 2001, 2003 and 2007. It returned to the region in November and December 2017 to see if the situation remained the same.\n\n‘Regrettably, it is clear from the information gathered by the Committee in the course of those visits that resort to torture and other forms of ill-treatment by members of law enforcement agencies in the Chechen Republic remains widespread, as does the related practice of unlawful detentions which inevitably heightens significantly the risk of resort to ill-treatment, in particular due to the denial of fundamental safeguards.\n\n‘Further, it remains deeply worrying that, in their responses to the CPT’s visit reports, the Russian authorities have failed to acknowledge the gravity of the situation.’\n\n‘A deep-rooted problem’\n\nThe statement says, ‘torture and other forms of ill-treatment of detained persons in the Chechen Republic has remained a deep-rooted problem.\n\n‘This speaks not only to a dereliction of duty at the level of the Republic’s authorities, but also to a failure of effective oversight and control at the Federal level. It is clear that the manner in which law enforcement officials in the Chechen Republic deal with persons in their custody must be subject to far closer and more robust supervision.’\n\nThe committee notes widespread reports of an anti-gay purge in Chechnya. This includes, ‘abductions, unlawful detentions, severe ill-treatment and extrajudicial killings of a large number of people – including but not limited to LGBTI persons – by, at the instigation, or with the acquiescence of law enforcement officials at various locations in the Chechen Republic.\n\n‘The facts found during [our] 2017 visit lend credence to those claims.’\n\n‘Impasse’\n\nIt says the committee has made repeated requests to Russia to carry out investigations.\n\n‘Regrettably, the CPT’s ongoing dialogue with the Russian authorities on this subject has reached an impasse.’\n\nRussian authorities have failed to show evidence to the committee that it is carrying out any investigation.\n\nThe committee says Russia must deliver, ‘a firm and unambiguous message of “zero tolerance” of ill-treatment to all members of law enforcement agencies operating in the Chechen Republic. … As part of this message, it should be reiterated that all forms of ill-treatment are absolutely prohibited, and that both the perpetrators of such acts and those condoning them will be punished accordingly.’\n\n‘Intolerable’\n\nThe report was welcomed by human rights advocates. Rachel Denber is a Deputy Director with Human Rights Watch, overseeing Europe and Central Asia.\n\nShe describes the report as, ‘powerful and important.’\n\n‘It calls out the widespread practice of torture in Chechnya.\n\n‘The Russian authorities’ failure to cooperate with the committee in no way diminishes the importance of this report. It’s essential for an agency that is as authoritative and expert as the CPT to document this intolerable abuse – for the sake of the victims, and the sake of the facts themselves.’\n\nHow you can help\n\nGay Star News is currently running a fundraiser to help raise money to halt the crisis in Chechnya. Money raised will go directly to the Russian LGBT Network to help tackle the crisis and to aid LGBTI people to flee Chechyna and seek asylum elsewhere.\n\nThe new president of Chile’s upper house of parliament, the Senate, has promised to pass an equal marriage bill this legislative year.\n\n‘Chile is in full cultural change, [and] demands wider freedoms and rights’ Jaime Quintana, who will take office on Tuesday [12 March] wrote on Twitter.\n\n‘There is no doubt’ Quintana wrote, the Senate will ‘discuss and approve the equal marriage this legislative year’.\n\nChile has recognized same-sex civil unions since 2015. And, in 2017, former President Michelle Bachelet introduced an equal marriage bill.\n\nHowever, when Sebastián Piñera took office in March last year, his government said it would not prioritize the bill.\n\nBut now, new president of the Senate, Quintana, has promised to pass the bill.\n\nÓscar Rementería, the spokesman of Chilean human rights organization Movilh, said there was a ‘clear horizon in sight’, according to local media.\n\n‘We are happy with this announcement, which comes to justice around a brutal and irrational legal inequality that weighs on couples just because of their sexual orientation’ he told Radio Agricultura.\n\nHe said the group would be in talks with Quintana next week to end the bill’s ‘paralysis’.\n\nLGBTI rights in Chile\n\nChileans overwhelmingly support LGBTI rights in the South American country.\n\nA recent survey showed 65% of Chileans above the age of 18, supported marriage equality. That’s a seven point jump since February.\n\nBut, in January, two men in Chile were violently attacked and tortured in two separate homophobic attacks.\n\nIn September last year, Chile passed a Gender Identity Bill. Now, transgender people in Chile can now change their legal name and gender, without having to go through surgery.\n\nIt allows anyone over the age of 14 to self-identify their gender. But people 14-18 years old will need consent from their parents or legal guardians.\n\nChile currently offers civil partnerships to same-sex couples.\n\nThe previous president introduced a bill to legalize love but the new Chilean president stated legalizing same-sex marriage is not a priority.\n\nA transgender woman who is running to be prime minister of Thailand has said she is ready to take the role – but wonders if the people are ready to accept a transgender candidate.\n\nPauline Ngarmpring transitioned at the age of 49, and has said she is “comfortable” and has “nothing to hide” ahead of the general election on March 24.\n\nThe trans Thai candidate said that—while she is ready for the race—she is accepting that she will likely not become prime minister on this occasion, according to the Thomas Reuters Foundation.\n\n“I know having my candidacy is a symbolic gesture. I know I will not be prime minister now,” said Ngarmpring. “But we hope we will get some seats and represent LGBT people in the country. And perhaps next time, even a transgender woman will have a chance.”\n\nPauline Ngarmpring is running so future generations will have equality\n\nShe also said that she decided to run now for prime minister so that future generations “who may be transgender, gay, male or female” will be able to have equality.\n\nShe is putting herself forward as a candidate for prime minister with the Machachon Party, a political party that is running with human rights and equality at the fore.\n\n“I know having my candidacy is a symbolic gesture. I know I will not be prime minister now.”\n\n– Pauline Ngarmpring, transgender candidate\n\nIf they win enough seats, the party wants to decriminalise sex work and improve LGBT+ rights – and in particular, wants to give transgender people the right to change their gender on official documents.\n\nNgarmpring told the Thomas Reuters Foundation that politics was always her main interest throughout her career—she worked as a news reporter—but that she was not in the right frame of mind to delve in until after she transitioned.\n\n‘Women are not taken seriously in Thailand’, says the trans candidate\n\nNgarmpring opened up about her experience of undergoing gender reassignment surgery in the United States, where she spent three years while she transitioned.\n\n“I was fortunate because I had already had a long and successful career as a man before I transitioned,” she said.\n\nShe said that transgender people often lack job opportunities and struggle to gain employment, and that women also experience difficulties.\n\n“It took me 40 years to admit to myself I was born a woman.”\n\n– Pauline Ngarmpring, transgender candidate\n\n“Women are not taken seriously in Thailand; there have been some women politicians, but it’s very difficult to enter politics without family connections.”\n\nNgarmpring also said that she often receives messages from LGBT+ people asking her for advice as they see her as “an inspiration.”\n\n“I tell them: take your time, it’s not about what other people think, it’s about being clear to yourself. It took me 40 years to admit to myself I was born a woman.”\n\nGay dads are more active in child-rearing than heterosexual men, according to a new study.\n\nConducted by Éric Feugé from the Université du Québec à Montréal (UQAM), the study is the ‘first of its kind’.\n\nIt observed 46 families (including 92 gay fathers and 46 children – ages one to nine) over seven years.\n\nThe study analyzed the roles gay dads take in raising their kids and found the way they parent is ‘very equitable’.\n\n‘We learned that gay fathers’ sharing of tasks is very equitable,’ Feugé told the Montreal Gazette. ‘There was a high degree of engagement in all types of parental roles.’\n\nSam Blaylock and gay dads at Portland Pride 2017. | Photo: Sam Blaylock (@xxsamraiderxx) Instagram\n\nHe then added: ‘[Gay dads] have a larger palette than (men in) traditional heterosexual families.\n\n‘What’s really interesting is that they don’t conform to roles of conventional fathers. They were able to redefine and propose new models of cultural notions of paternity and masculinity.\n\n‘They could be playmates, caregivers, protectors, role models, morality guides,’ he said.\n\nThe study found men with higher revenue were less invested in family life. It also found men with ‘culturally defined feminine traits’ were more involved in childcare.\n\nGay dads and stigma\n\nAnother recent study reported two thirds of gay dads have experienced stigma.\n\n63.5% of 732 gay fathers from 47 US states reported facing stigma for being a gay dad. Furthermore, half of respondents (51.2%) reported avoiding situations for fear of stigma, in the last year.\n\nGay dads Wayne and Gus with their family, Lucas, Logan and Eva. | Photo: Stephanie Horn Photography\n\nMost of this stigma comes from religious environments.\n\nStigma is defined as gay fathers ‘made to feel uncomfortable, excluded, shamed, hurt, or unwelcome.’\n\nAround a quarter of respondents also reported experiencing stigma in the past year from family members, neighbors, gay friends and/or service providers such as waiters, service providers, and salespeople.\n\nAccording to the authors of the study: ‘Ongoing health supervision should include discussions about stigma and help families learn strategies to counteract its corrosive effects.’\n\nAnother recent study found gay dads make better parents than straight dads.\n\nGermany plans to push ahead with a ban on gay cure therapy, the country’s health minister has said.\n\nGermany’s health minister Jens Spahn, the country’s most senior gay politician, told newspaper Die Tageszeitung that he would seek a ban on the discredited practice.\n\nIn the February 15 interview he said: “Homosexuality is not a disease and it doesn’t need to be cured. That’s why I’m in favour of a ban on conversion therapy.\n\n“I do not believe in these therapies because of my own sexual orientation. I [believe] that God has something in mind.”\n\nSpahn said the challenge was in “practical implementation” of a ban, adding that he will seek to shape the law with the country’s Minister of Justice Katarina Barley.\n\nThe politician said: “The law must be clear enough to make an impact.”\n\nHe added that Germany would be looking at the models of existing conversion therapy bans internationally.\n\nSThe Stars You Didn’t Know Have An LGBT SiblingThe Straight Stars Who Went Gay For Pay\n\n15 US states including New York have passed laws banning conversion therapy on minors, while Malta was the first European country to outlaw the practice in 2016.\n\nSpahn said he would aim to get agreement on the issue by the summer, adding that he would like the law to go “as far as possible” to stamp out conversion therapy.\n\nThe politician denied his actions may upset the religious factions inside the governing conservative CDU/CSU, adding that he does not believe any of the party’s MPs believe in conversion therapy.\n\nHowever, the party has proven divided on LGBT+ issues before.\n\nIn November, CDU education minister Anja Karliczek faced a backlash for comments about same-sex marriage and gay parents.\n\nKarliczek had said she was unsettled by the fast pace of change in the country, calling for a “study” into the impact of gay parenting on children.\n\nThe comments led to a clash within the cabinet, with families minister Franziska Giffey emphasising: “Studies have already shown that children develop just as well under homosexual partnerships as they do in families with mothers and fathers…what counts is that people lovingly take care of their children.”\n\nSpahn was one of three candidates who put their name forward in November to succeed Chancellor Angela Merkel when she stands down ahead of elections in 2021.\n\nThe conservative lawmaker lost out to Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer, the favourite of the Merkel camp, in the race\n\nMajor businesses have pulled their advertising with media website Daily Mail after it published a story that incorrectly identified a double child murderer as trans.\n\nHotel chain, Travelodge, and online survey portal, Survey Monkey both stopped advertising with Daily Mail after the story.\n\nThe Daily Star originally reported – and then retracted – that Ian Huntley convicted of murdering two children in 2003 was trans. The Star corrected the story that Hunter wanted to transition genders so he could move to a female prison.\n\nThe Daily Mail also published the story but did not change the incorrect the claims that Hunter now identifies as female.\n\n‘The implicit association between murderer Ian Huntley, and the transgender community (specifically trans women) has been extremely damaging – cited by anti-trans groups like FairPlay For Women and Women’s Place UK, as a reason to not extend proposed changes to the GRA, as well as lobbying to remove existing legal rights for trans people as currently provided under the 2010 Equality Act,’ said trans advocate @mimmymum.\n\n‘It was cited in numerous occasions during the GRA consultation, and has generated a barrage of abuse towards trans people.’\n\nStop Funding Hate\n\nTrans advocates called for the Daily Mail to scrap the story. That’s where online campaign, Stop Funding Hate, stepped in.\n\nStop Funding Hate is a campaign which aims to make ‘hate unprofitable by persuading advertisers to pull their support from publications that spread hate and division’. It has recently set its sights on media outlets who publish transphobic stories.\n\nRichard Wilson, director, Stop Funding Hate said the past year has seen a flood of toxic media stories targeting trans people\n\n‘But being a consumer gives each of us a voice,’ he told Gay Star News.\n\n‘If enough of us speak out, and urge the companies we shop with to stop advertising with media that fuel hate and misinformation about the trans community, this could help to turn the tide.’\n\nWilson said the long-term goal was to bring about a healthier and fairer media by making hate unprofitable.\n\n‘We know that one of the reasons newspapers publish toxic and inflammatory stories about trans people and other minority groups is that this can be an effective way of driving “clicks” and boosting advertising revenue,’ he said.\n\n‘But this only works so long as advertisers are prepared to go along with it. And we know that many brands are now beginning to think more carefully about where their advertising money is going.’\n\nThe campaign has shown great success in reducing anti-migrant and anti-Muslim headlines in the UK media.\n\nCompanies respond\n\nWithin one day of targeting the Daily Mail, both Survey Monkey and Travelodge pulled their advertising.\n\nSurveyMonkey confirms it is no longer advertising with the Daily Mail | Photo: Twitter\n\n‘Our hope is that if enough people now use their power as consumers to challenge UK newspapers over their coverage of trans issues, this could help bring about a similar reduction in anti-trans hate and misinformation within the UK press,’ Wilson said.\n\nWilson celebrated the two companies’ decision to stop advertising with the Daily Mail.\n\n‘Surveymonkey deserve credit for taking prompt action after discovering that their ad was appearing on this Daily Mail article, which repeats the toxic (and debunked) suggestion that one of the UK’s most notorious murderers is trans,’ he said,\n\n‘The companies we shop with care what their customers think, and our experience has been that many brands will act when these issues are brought to their attention.’\n\n‘Many Travelodge customers will be heartened to see that the company has taken action after their ad appeared on a debunked story which has caused such concern within the trans community,’ Wilson said.\n\n‘We hope that other advertisers will take note – and that the Daily Mail will commit to reporting more responsibly on issues that impact on trans people.’\n\nAt the time of publication, the Daily Mail has still not removed the story.\n\nMehdi is terrified of returning to Iran | Photo: Courtesy of Carlo Rapisarda15 February 2019 15:12 GMTJoe Morgan\n\nA gay 19-year-old is fighting for survival as he fears being executed in his home country of Iran.\n\nMehdi Shokr Khoda, who also identifies as Christian, is hoping he will be granted asylum in Sweden in his final appeal.\n\nThe final decision will be made in two weeks.\n\nTerrified of being deported to Iran\n\n‘I cannot live open as a gay in Iran,’ Mehdi told Gay Star News.\n\n‘They won’t understand something about you. They will just kill you first.’\n\nIn his corner is his partner, 23-year-old Carlo Rapisarda – originally from Italy.\n\nThe two of them have been together close to a year.\n\nMehdi followed his transgender sister, who fled to Stockholm from Iran a few years ago. Because she was granted asylum, he traveled to Sweden in 2017 in the hopes he would be given the same protection.\n\nTheir parents are unaware of their two children’s true sexual or gender identity.\n\nFinding love in Sweden\n\nMehdi met Carlo on Tinder in January last year. The two quickly fell for each other and moved in with each other after six months.\n\n‘He understands me well. When we fight we are not fire with fire – we are fire with water,’ Mehdi added to GSN.\n\n‘He’s so mature… This is the kind of thing I love about him so much.’\n\nAt the end of last year, the Migration Board rejected Mehdi’s application as they thought he was lying.\n\nThey appealed the decision and went to court at the end of January 2019. Carlo testified for their relationship.\n\n‘They want evidence,’ Carlo said.\n\n‘We live together, we love each other, we’ve known each other a long time. Isn’t that evidence enough?\n\n‘There’s not a scientific way – you can’t hook him up to cables and check.’\n\nThe couple also got a letter from the Swedish Federation for LGBT rights. It said: ‘There’s no doubt. Medhi is gay and in need of protection. ‘\n\nThey were once again rejected saying Mehdi was unable to explain his coming out process.\n\nRejected on basis of lacking ‘nuance’\n\nSweden’s government questioned why Mehdi had only been baptised when he came to Stockholm. They also said the 19-year-old’s ‘thoughts and reflections’ on Christianity were lacking.\n\nMehdi said his faith is private, something he learned to do in Iran.\n\n‘You’re either Muslim or you’re dead,’ Mehdi added.\n\nThe couple also blames their failure on a ‘terrible interpreter’.\n\nBut what the Swedish courts don’t understand, Mehdi says, is that he didn’t really have a coming out process.\n\nHe was bullied for speaking higher than other boys, a ‘gay voice’, from a young age.\n\nAt 15, a boy befriended him and gained his trust. But then the boy screen-shotted the chats they had and sent them around the school.\n\n‘It was awful for me,’ Mehdi said, quietly.\n\nMehdi and Carlo have considered getting married. However, they’re in a Catch 22. To go through the normal route involves getting permission from Iran (not an option). But to get married also means Mehdi needs a resident’s card, something he can’t have without the Swedish government’s permission.\n\nSlim chance at survival\n\nIf the asylum appeal fails, Mehdi will have two weeks to leave the country.\n\nIf he is deported, his life is in immediate danger.\n\n‘[Officers] will absolutely figure it out,’ he said. ‘They’ll ask questions.\n\n‘If they find out I’m Christian or I’m gay or I tried to seek asylum, they will not understand that.\n\n‘They will execute me.’\n\nThere is still a slim chance Mehdi and Carlo will win their court battle. Thousands have already been raised on their Go Fund Me page.\n\nAnd if they do win, they’ll be able to start their lives together. Mehdi will be able to finish school, get a job, and start a life where he’s free to do so.\n\n‘I would like to be a pharmacist – make medicine – make people better,’ he said.\n\nAnd while Carlo is a Master’s student at a technical university, he’s willing to drop it all to follow his partner.\n\nHe said: ‘If he has to go to another country, I will follow him.’\n\nPhoto: Facebook/Asociacion Aspidh Arcoiris Trans18 February 2019\n\nA transgender woman who was killed in El Salvador was reportedly deported by United States immigration officials before her death. They allegedly did not believe her concerns of being in danger in her home country.\n\nCamila died on 3 February, though the cause of death remains undisclosed at this time.\n\nLGBTI organization Presentes is investigating what happened to the 29-year-old sex worker. Some of Camila’s fellow sex workers told Presentes they saw police attack Camila and dump her body.\n\n‘Presentes has asked police for an official response but it has closed the case and has not responded,’ the organization said in a statement.\n\nAsociación Aspidh Arcoiris Trans, another Salvadoran trans group, told the Washington Blade they learned Camila was taken to Rosales National Hospital on 31 January with numerous injuries.\n\nUS immigration policies\n\nCamila migrated to the US over threats posed to her in El Salvador. Advocates say that immigration authorities in the US allegedly didn’t believe her concerns and deported her back to her native country.\n\nAislinn Odaly’s, an LGBTI rights advocate, told the Blade: ‘She migrated to the US because of threats that she had received, but she was deported because they didn’t believe her.’\n\nThis case is a magnifying glass on immigration policies in the United States.\n\nLast week, Donald Trump declared a national emergency over the border wall he wants along the US-Mexico border. He did this over a perceived ‘crisis’ at the border caused by illegal immigration.\n\nThis, however, affects LGBTI people fleeing the violence and discrimination in their home countries, as seen in the case of Camila.\n\nEven when immigrants make it to the United States, though, they face new obstacles. A recent report revealed US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) is currently holding over 100 transgender individuals.\n\nOne trans woman, Roxsana Hernández, died in ICE custody last year.\n\nFashion designer Karl Lagerfeld has died, aged 85. The German-born, creative director of Chanel had reportedly been suffering ill health over the past few weeks, although no official cause of death has been revealed.\n\nFrench magazine Closer broke the news of Lagerfeld’s death. Sources at Chanel have confirmed the news.\n\nThe designer missed two Chanel catwalk shows in late January. However, at the time the company said it was due to tiredness.\n\nIt was the first time he had ever missed a Chanel catwalk show since taking over the helm in 1983.\n\nCareer and controversy\n\nLagerfeld was born in Hamburg in 1933: the son of a businessman and former lingerie saleswoman. He undertook his secondary schooling in Paris, after which he took up a job as an apprenticeship with the designer Pierre Balmain.\n\nHe designed his first haute couture collection, for Jean Patou, in 1958.\n\nLagerfeld built a name for himself during the 1960s, working extensively with Chloe and Curiel. He also began to collaborate with the Italian fashion house, Fendi.\n\nLagerfeld was appointed creative director for Chanel in 1983, which is when he truly became a global fashion brand. Instantly recognizable, he became as known for his trademark silver hair, ponytail, sunglasses, large white shirt collars and leather gloves as his clothing and accessory designs.\n\nHis career was also not without controversies. He was a frequent target of animal rights groups such as PETA for his use of fur in his designs. He also had to apologize after using a verse from the Qur’an in his spring 1994 couture collection for Chanel.\n\nDubbed ‘Kaiser Karl’ and ‘Fashion Meister’, he was also known for the occasional his bitchy remarks.\n\nIn 2012, he said of the singer Adele, ‘She is a little too fat, but she has a beautiful face and a divine voice.’\n\nOnce asked his views on Russia, the designer said, ‘If I was a woman in Russia I would be a lesbian, as the men are very ugly.’\n\nHe also looked down upon those who made little effort with their attire: ‘Sweatpants are a sign of defeat. You lost control of your life so you bought some sweatpants.’\n\nMore recently, he was criticized for his response to the #MeToo movement after saying: ‘If you don’t want your pants pulled about, don’t become a model!’\n\n‘Elegance is an attitude’\n\nHowever, he was also known for his craftmanship and vision. He was an accomplished artist, continuing to hand-draw his own designs until late in life, and photographer.\n\n‘Elegance is an attitude,’ is one Lagerfeld quote that fans will fondly remember him for.\n\nAmong the first to pay tribute to Lagerfeld is Donatella Versace. The Italian designer posted a photo of her with Lagerfeld and a message: ‘Karl your genius touched the lives of so many, especially Gianni and I. We will never forget your incredible talent and endless inspiration. We were always learning from you.’"
