        "text": "History, Identity, and Justice in Sixteenth-Century Michoacán, Mexico\n\nAround 1539, the Spanish viceroy to Mexico Antonio de Mendoza commissioned a Franciscan friar to record the customs of what is today the state of Michoacán, Mexico, so that he could govern it more effectively. The friar, together with indigenous artists and noble informants from two distinct ethnic factions, produced the illustrated manuscript known as the “Relación de Michoacán.” This presentation analyzes the Relación’s images of justice, their representation of the body and its relationship to history and ethno-political power."
