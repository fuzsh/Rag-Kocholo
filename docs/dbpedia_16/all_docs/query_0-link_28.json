        "text": "According to the communiqué, several members of the LEAR [League of Revolutionary Writers and Artists] were scolded by the League’s Executive Committee for overextending their stay in New York and abandoning their League duties, The members were ordered to return immediately or risk appropriate disciplinary measures.\n\nNew York offered visibility to any artist. It was an undeniable opportunity, and political differences between Rufino Tamayo (1899–1991) and the Social Realism movement led to very specific conflicts of interest when his artistic goals did not mesh with the demands of political activism. As is well known, Tamayo was not the only one in this situation, as shown by the fact that he was called home along with Juan Bracho and Antonio Pujol, who was very close to David Alfaro Siqueiros."
