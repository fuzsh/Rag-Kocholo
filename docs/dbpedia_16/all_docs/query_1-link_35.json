        "text": "In the spring and summer of 1939—as the Second World War was looming—the Taller artists produced an extraordinary group of eight posters to publicize a series of lectures against fascism sponsored by an organization of anti-Nazi German emigrés, the Liga Pro-Cultura Alemana (League for Pro-German Culture). The Gallery owns five of the eight. This poster, on the subject of German fascism, shows a vulture and a skeleton in military helmets; the skeletal figure—with a swastika at his wrist and holding a gun with a bayonet—towers over a scene of destroyed buildings and distraught, fleeing women and old men. Antonio Pujol, one of the artists who produced the image, had recently fought on the Loyalist (antifascist) side in the Spanish Civil War."
