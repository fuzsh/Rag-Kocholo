Chef and owner Enrique Olvera pioneered the new Mexican gastronomy movement, shining a bright light on a sophisticated cuisine with a storied history.\n\nI’m not always completely blown away by restaurants sporting Michelin stars or on the world’s 50 best lists. Sometimes, the techniques and artistry are amazing, but I’m left cold or unmoved by a stiff formality on the plate and in the room.\n\nBut I was happy at Pujol. Olvera moved the restaurant to new digs last March and at the same time took a more relaxed approach to food and dining.\n\nAn area is reserved for an elongated taco bar. The new room is a low-key beauty, a little bit mid-century, a little bit Zen, with Mexican sourced materials and furnishings.\n\nThe kitchen reflects Mexican cookery, doing away with burners and sauté stations. Instead, staff use a wood-fired grill, comals (earthenware or cast iron cooking surfaces) for making tortillas, and a brick oven outside for barbacoa. The food is haute, but the atmosphere is very relaxed.\n\nArticle content\n\nAdvertisement 3\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nPujol’s six-course tasting menu — there is no à la carte — costs $CND 128 per person (excluding drinks and tip), but also includes an amuse bouche, palate-cleanser sorbet, and post-dessert treat of a skinny, spiral churro.\n\nThe main act begins with a “street snack.” To Olvera, street food is but a Cinderella in need of a prince. And so, we started with a sort of elote, a common street food of grilled corn on the cob slathered with cotija cheese and spicy mayo.\n\nHere, it arrived in a perfect hollowed gourd, sleek as ceramic art. Corn husks smouldered inside, releasing a poof of smoke upon lifting the lid. Nestling baby corns were coated in chicatana mayo (flying ant mayo, further flavoured with coffee, lime and costena chile). Flying ants appear only during the first two June rainfalls in parts of Mexico and I’m happy to have had this bite of Mexico’s fascinating cuisine.\n\nMoving through the courses, I had ceviche-style sea bass with cacahuatzintle (heirloom corn) juice and celery (such gossamer texture); cauliflower with almond salsa macha (a Veracruz salsa with chipotle chilies, oil, garlic, peanuts, sesame seeds) and chile de arbol, which the server said also contained crispy chicken skin; and finally, duck with black recado (achiote paste), a gorgeous dish.\n\nAdvertisement 4\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nMy husband’s choices were octopus with habanero ink, ayocote and veracruzana sauce (a mini-horror nightmare to me with the plump blackened tentacle sticking out under fresh herbs but beautifully tender and delicious); charred eggplant tamal and chard; and lamb with mint mole and baby potatoes. The later was the only dish that rated a “meh.” It was cooked to medium rather than medium rare and was not as tender as it should have been.\n\nEveryone is served the baby corn dish and another signature that climaxes the tasting menu — the Mole Madre. The mole does not come with a protein. It is, basically, sauce on a plate except for blue corn tortillas, embedded with a leaf, to scoop it up. A black mole (mole negro) encircles a light-coloured one like a bull’s-eye.\n\nThe dark mole is a mother sauce, like a sourdough bread starter that keeps on going, and is added to each day. When we had it, it was 1,465 days old, and amazingly deep and complex and beautifully balanced as the pedigree of the mole and the chef suggests. The lighter mole (mole nuevo) spooned into the centre is freshly made. I asked the server about the ingredients in the dish and he responded with a deer-in-headlight look. He explained it has more than 80 ingredients, and they change.\n\nAdvertisement 5\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nMy dessert — an apple tamale with a paper-thin crisp disk of apples crowning the dish — didn’t exactly look like a tamale (nothing was wrapped), but it was delicious.\n\nMy husband chose chocolate torte with caramelized banana and vanilla ice cream with intrigues of pennyroyal gelatin kisses and pinole, an Aztec-inspired crumble of ground maize, cocoa and spices.\n\nPujol’s wine list ranges from Latin America to Europe, but curiously, there’s no wine pairing option with the tasting menu. This is, however, an eye-popping array of mescals and other agave spirits.\n\nIf Pujol isn’t in your budget, Olvera also runs Eno, a casual restaurant chain in Mexico City. In New York, Olvera operates Cosme, which ranks 40th in the World’s 50 Best Restaurants list.\n\nSoul food for Lunar New Year\n\nWith Lunar New Year (Feb. 16) soon upon us, you’ll want to to start of The Year of The Dog well fed.\n\nConsider Chinese Soul Food: A Friendly Guide for Homemade Dumplings, Stir Fries, Soups, and More. It’s a totally inviting cookbook by popular and smart (award-winning food journalist) cooking instructor Hsiao-Ching Chou.\n\nAdvertisement 6\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nSoul-pleasing dishes include braised beef noodle soup, red-braised pork belly, dry fried green beans, garlic eggplant and potstickers. (Her potstickers so impressed Anthony Bourdain he invited her to make them on his TV show No Reservations.)\n\n“(Lunar) New Year,” she says, “is what centres me. It’s my holiday Olympics. It’s Thanksgiving, Christmas and New Year’s all wrapped into one. I love thinking about the menu and what symbolic dishes I’ll spend days preparing and then savouring the delicious moments of watching my extended family devour the feast.”\n\nShe was recently in Vancouver, promoting her cookbook, stopping by at Fong on Food on Roundhouse Radio. In Seattle, she teaches at Hot Stove Society cooking school operated by Seattle’s longtime celeb chef Tom Douglas.
