        "text": "Nestled on the streets of Mexico City’s upscale neighborhood of Polanco, Pujol could seem like a private home with futuristic architecture to the untrained eye. It’s easy to see why it’s widely revered as one of the top 25 restaurants in the world and associated with Relais & Châteaux.\n\nPujol offers the following menus to select from: Seven course tasting menu (corn or sea) or a ten course taco bar menu, selected by the chef.\n\nI selected the corn tasting menu and my boyfriend, Matthew selected the sea. It was an amazing seven course meal that fused Mexican cuisine with Japanese presentation and style.\n\nThe Maiz tasting menu starts with “street snacks” served in a pumpkin. From there, the meal went as followed: Tlayuda with black beans, cheese, tomato and grasshopper! (!!!) Huitlacoche with black truffle. Eggplant Tamal with swiss chard. Cauliflower with Sikil P’ak. The famous Mole Madre – which was 6 years old (2116 days to be exact). Corn cake with blueberries for dessert… Yum!\n\nThe Mar menu features the following: Street Snacks. Chayote Squash, Scallop Pico. Kampachi Ceviche, Cacahuazintle Juice, Celery, Yuzu. Octopus, Chintextle, Pickled Carrot. Striped Bass, Mole Verde, Fava Bean, Kusho. Mole Madre and Mole Nuevo. Matcha Nicoatole, Soursop, Shiso, Basil.\n\nIt was fun to share and try bites from each of the tasting menus. We received an extra course, compliments of the chef – tortillas de hoja santa topped with a white, flaky fish that was grilled to perfection! If you’re a tortilla lover (like me), be sure to make an extra stop at Chef Enrique Olvera’s tortilleria, Molino el Pujol.\n\nWhile the tasting menus were exciting on it’s own, I was surprised to be invited back to the kitchen to meet Chef Alex Bremont and his team! I was instantly impressed with Chef Alex’s professionalism and charisma and it was fun to interview him for my upcoming YouTube series.\n\nOverall, the night was one to remember. I’ll continue day-dreaming about my meal at Pujol for months to come! Chef Enrique Olvera also has restaurants in Los Cabos, Oaxaca, New York City and soon to come in Los Angeles. They are all on my bucket list!"
