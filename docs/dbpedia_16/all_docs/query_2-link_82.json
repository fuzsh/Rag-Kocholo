        "meta_description": "What does it mean to be happy? The vast majority of cross-cultural studies on happiness have employed a Western-origin, or “WEIRD” measure of happiness that conceptualizes it as a self-centered (or “independent”), high-arousal emotion. However, research from Eastern cultures, particularly Japan, conceptualizes happiness as including an interpersonal aspect emphasizing harmony and connectedness to others. Following a combined emic-etic approach (Cheung, van de Vijver & Leong, 2011), we assessed the cross-cultural applicability of a measure of independent happiness developed in the US (Subjective Happiness Scale; Lyubomirsky & Lepper, 1999) and a measure of interdependent happiness developed in Japan (Interdependent Happiness Scale; Hitokoto & Uchida, 2015), with data from 63 countries representing 7 sociocultural regions. Results indicate that the schema of independent happiness was more coherent in more WEIRD countries. In contrast, the coherence of interdependent happiness was unrelated to a country’s “WEIRD-ness.” Reliabilities of both happiness measures were lowest in African and Middle Eastern countries, suggesting these two conceptualizations of happiness may not be globally comprehensive. Overall, while the two measures had many similar correlates and properties, the self-focused concept of independent happiness is “WEIRD-er” than interdependent happiness, suggesting cross-cultural researchers should attend to both conceptualizations.",

        "text": "Country-level variables.\n\nThe current analyses use several country-level variables obtained from publicly available databases. Country level variables were chosen to represent a range of socioecological, geographic, and psychological variables that could be feasibly related to country level differences in the conceptualizations of happiness [25, 31]. We grouped the country level variables into two categories of “objective” variables (statistics measured by government or other organizations) and “subjective” variables (aggregated from individual responses to psychological measurements). For a complete list of all country scores for each of the listed variables, see S1 File.\n\nObjective country-level variables. A number of “objective” country level variables were chosen to reflect basic characteristics of the country as measured by various organizations, selected based on plausible relevance to happiness and the availability of data for at least 40 of the countries included in our data. These variables were also chosen to be as independent from each other as possible, as many country characteristics (e.g., GDP & life expectancy) are highly correlated with each other and would thus produce redundant results.\n\nHuman Development Index (HDI). The Human Development Index (HDI) is a composite measure of a country’s development, consisting of life expectancy, educational opportunities, and standard of living [32]. HDI scores were available for all ISP countries except Taiwan. Country HDI scores ranged from .49 (Uganda & Senegal) to .95 (Norway), with higher scores indicating greater economic development.\n\nPopulation density. Population density is the number of people per sq. km of land area (The World Bank [33]). Population density data was available for all ISP countries except Taiwan; however, both Hong Kong (7,040 people per sq. km) and Singapore (7,916 people per sq. km) were excluded from analyses because their unusually high density skewed the country-level results. The remaining population density scores ranged from 3 people per sq. km (Australia) to 756 people per sq. km (Palestine).\n\nGrowth rate. Population growth rate is the average annual percent change in population of a country [34]. Growth rate data was available for all ISP countries except Palestine. Country scores ranged from -1.08 (Latvia) to 3.20 (Uganda), with positive scores indicating an increase in population size and negative scores indicating a decrease in population size.\n\nSuicide rate. Suicide rate is the age-standardized suicide rate per 100,000 people, averaged across sexes [35]. Suicide rates were available for 60 ISP countries. Country scores ranged from 2.50 (Pakistan) to 26.10 (Lithuania), with high scores indicating a higher suicide rate.\n\nAverage temperature. Average temperature is the average daily temperature throughout the entire year in Celsius [36]. Because some larger countries have a wide range of average temperatures depending upon exact location, the average temperature used was that of the city or cities in which ISP data collection took place. For most countries, only one city was included in the average daily temperature. Data on average daily temperature was available for all 63 ISP countries and ranged from 4°C (Russia) to 29°C (Thailand).\n\nSubjective country level variables. Subjective country level variables were chosen to reflect the psychological or cultural characteristics of a country.\n\nWEIRDness. WEIRD country level scores are a measure of cultural distance from the United States [37]. As computed by Muthukrishna and colleagues [37], the scores reflect a country’s overall dissimilarity to the United States on a range of psychological variables from the World Values Survey (WVS), including personality traits, cultural values, and tightness/looseness. These psychological variables were selected by the authors to include all questions from the WVS that were judged to be culturally transmissible. The United States was chosen as the reference group because of the large American dominance in the field of psychology. Psychological distance scores were also calculated for China as a comparison, but were excluded from present analyses because the comparison measure of interdependent happiness was developed in Japan. Notably, the cultural distance calculated between the United States and Japan was similar to the cultural distance between China and Japan, meaning the scores computed for China would not be representative of the cultural similarity to the IHS. For the cultural distance scores presented for the United States, we reversed the country scores to make higher scores indicate more similarity and thus a higher level of “WEIRD-ness” as it was originally conceptualized (i.e., more Western, Educated, Industrialized, Rich and Democratic, similar to the United States). Cultural distance WEIRD scores were available for 46 ISP countries. The ‘most WEIRD’ countries (most psychologically similar to the United States) were Canada (.97) and Australia (.97), and the least WEIRD countries was Jordan (.81).\n\nCultural values. Schwartz’s cultural value orientation scales represent seven distinct bipolar values assessed in national surveys of students and teachers in 80 countries [38]. The scales measure embeddedness (how embedded people are in their groups), intellectual autonomy (the independent pursuit of ideas and knowledge), affective autonomy (the independent pursuit of pleasure), harmony (valuing the group rather than the self), egalitarianism (valuing cooperation and concern for all), hierarchy (reliance on structured and hierarchical social roles), and mastery (valuing success through self-assertion). Country scores for all seven of Schwartz’s cultural values were available for 59 ISP countries.\n\nReliability of the happiness measures.\n\nThe first set of individual level analyses concern the reliability of the happiness measures within each country. We present multiple tests of internal consistency using the broad approach prescribed by generalizability theory [39]. Each result is presented for each country, considering each as a separate sample, as well as the average across all countries. The internal consistency scores for the Subjective Happiness Scale (SHS) are presented in Table 2 and the internal consistency scores for the Interdependent Happiness Scale (IHS) are presented in Table 3. Averages of these countries’ scores for both happiness measures within geographic regions are presented in Table 4 (see Table 1 for a list of countries and their corresponding region).\n\nTotal common variance (ωt). We first estimated the total reliability of the happiness measures using McDonald’s [45] omega total (ωt). This metric is similar to Cronbach’s alpha, and can be interpreted along the same scale, but provides a better estimate of reliability [39]. Both the SHS and the IHS had identical average total common variance across countries (ωt Mean = .84). For the SHS, only four countries had ωt < .70: Senegal (ωt = .59), India (ωt = .65), Pakistan (ωt = .68), and Uganda (ωt = .69). The countries with the highest SHS total common variance were the United Kingdom (ωt = .94) and Belgium (ωt = .93). Overall, countries in Africa had the lowest total variance (ωt Mean = .72) while Western Europe had the highest (ωt Mean = .90). For the IHS, none of the countries had a total common variance score ωt < .70. The countries with the lowest total common variance were Uganda (ωt = .74) and Indonesia (ωt = .77) while the highest proportion was in Peru (ωt = .90). Similar to the SHS, the lowest total common variance for the IHS was found in African countries (ωt Mean = .81) but the highest proportions were in East Asian countries (ωt Mean = .87). While the total reliability for both happiness measures were lowest in African countries, the average was higher for the IHS ωt (Mean = .81) than the SHS (ωt Mean = .72).\n\nGeneral factor saturation (ωh). Next, we estimated the proportion of the variance in the observed happiness scores that can be attributed to the general latent factor. The general factor saturation of the test was calculated using McDonald’s [45] omega hierarchical (ωh) coefficient. Omega hierarchical is a useful test for assessing the homogeneity of a measure. A low score would indicate that the observed scores are not accurate predictors of the latent score and the variability in the items may be due to other factors [39]. Omega hierarchical is useful because, unlike omega total, the reliability estimates are not a function of test length. This is particularly important when comparing the reliability of two measures with unequal numbers of items, as is the case for the two measures of happiness. Both the SHS (ωhMean = .59) and IHS (ωhMean = .60) average coefficients were very similar, however the SHS (ωhSD = .34) varied considerably more than the IHS (ωhSD = .08). The countries with the lowest SHS general factor saturation coefficients were Bolivia (ωh = .002) and Estonia (ωh = .003) while the countries with the highest SHS general factor saturation were Belgium (ωh = .91) and Sweden (ωh = .89). The region with the highest average SHS general factor saturation was Western Europe (ωhMean = .85) while the lowest scores were found in South Asian countries (ωhMean = .29). For the IHS, the countries with the lowest general factor saturation were Portugal (ωh = .32) and Uganda (ωh = 41) while the highest countries were Thailand (ωh = .81) and Taiwan (ωh = .77). The region with the highest average IHS general factor saturation was East Asia (ωhMean = .70) while African countries had the lowest average (ωhMean = .51).\n\nSmallest split half reliability (β). Another assessment of the homogeneity of a test is the smallest split half reliability of the test, calculated from all possible splits of the items for each happiness measure The smallest split half reliability is similar to an alpha or ωt, as it is an estimate of the total reliable variance. However, similar to ωh, it is not influenced by test length, and thus useful for comparing measures with unequal items. For interpreting results, a β around .50 would indicate that about half of test reflects one general factor of happiness [39]. The SHS had the highest averaged smallest split half reliability (βMean = .77) than the IHS (βMean = .64). The worst lowest split half reliability for the SHS was in Uganda (β = .20), followed by Indonesia (β = .34) and Pakistan (β = .39). The best lowest split half reliability scores for the SHS were in Belgium (β = .91) and Sweden (β = .89). Overall, for SHS, the worst lowest split half reliabilities were in African countries (βMean = .55) while the best lowest split half reliabilities were in Western European countries (βMean = .85) and Western English-speaking countries (βMean = 84). For the IHS, the worst lowest split half reliability was in Kenya (β = .46) followed by Uganda (β = .47) while the best lowest split half reliability scores were in China (β = .80) and South Korea (β = .79). Similar to the SHS, the worst lowest split half reliability scores for the IHS were in African countries (βMean = .55) but the best lowest split half reliability scores were in East Asian countries (βMean = .75).\n\nCommunality scores ( ). Communality scores are the square of the factor loadings of the item on the latent trait and represent the percent of variance in the item that can be explained by the latent trait [46]. As communality scores are essentially correlation coefficients, the results can be interpreted similarly [47], with scores of less than .40 suggesting the items may not be strongly related to the latent variable. Tables 5 and 6 present the communality scores for the SHS and IHS across countries, respectively. Because the two happiness measures do not have an equal number of items, we also calculated the average communality score for each measure [39], presented in Table 4.\n\nThe bottom row of Table 5 presents the average communality score for each item of the Subjective Happiness Scale across countries. The first 3 items of the SHS had high communality scores (ranging from .60 to .70), suggesting a high proportion of their variability could be explained by the latent independent happiness variable. However, there was a substantial drop in communality scores for the fourth item on the scale. The communality score for the SHS item #4 was less than .40, suggesting this item may not be as strongly related as the other items. Notably, item #4 is also the only reversed item on the scale–“Some people are generally not very happy…To what extent does this characterize you?”. For some countries, such as Kenya, Vietnam, and Pakistan, the communality scores for the first three items were all acceptable while the communality score for item #4 was almost zero. Even in the United States, the country of origin for the measure, the communality score for item #4 might not be considered acceptable. Overall, this suggests this item should be removed to improve the overall reliability of the measure.\n\nFor the Interdependent Happiness Scale, the communality scores for all of the items were much more consistent. Two of the items (#4 & #6) had average communality scores below .40 but were not substantially lower than the other items that ranged from .40 to .60. These two items from the IHS pertain to the quiescence component of the scale, regarding the absence of negative aspects in one’s life. However, while these two items were lowest on average, these items were not consistently low within countries. For example, Austria and Brazil had low (< .30) communality scores for item #4 but extremely high communality scores for #6. However, in Japan, the country of origin for the IHS, the communality score for item #6 was considerably lower. The item with the highest overall average communality score was #9, “I generally believe that things are going well for me in its own way as they are for others around me,” followed by items #7 and #8. These last three items on the measure pertain to the embeddedness aspect of interdependent happiness.\n\nEach measure’s average communality score was calculated as the average of each item’s communality score within each country and then averaged across countries (see Table 4). Across all countries, the average communality scores for the SHS ( = .62) were higher than the average communality scores for the IHS ( = .47). The countries with the lowest average communality scores for the SHS were Senegal ( = .31) and India ( = .35), while the highest scores were in the United Kingdom ( = .80) and Belgium ( = .78). Overall, the lowest average communality scores for the SHS were in Africa ( = .48) while the highest average communality scores were in Western Europe ( = .71). For the IHS, the countries with the lowest average communality scores were Pakistan ( = .36) and Uganda ( = .37) while the highest average communality scores were in Peru ( = .58) and Jordan, Sweden, and Thailand ( = .57). Overall, the lowest average communality scores for the IHS were in South Asia ( = .45) and the best average communality scores were in East Asia ( = .51).\n\nRelationship between happiness measures.\n\nTo test for the relationship between the two happiness measures we used Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) to account for differences in the reliability of the measures. For the Interdependent Happiness Scale (IHS), the 9 items were grouped into 3 corresponding parcels to decrease the total number of parameters estimated. There were no missing data and thus no imputation was needed.\n\nGiven the range of sample sizes across countries, post hoc power analyses were conducted for estimating the relationship between the two latent variables using the pwrSEM app [48]. Rather than calculate power estimates for all 63 countries, we tested the power to detect an effect given the average observed relationships among variables and then with a combination of the lowest observed relationships among variables. For the first power analysis, we estimated the factor loadings for the 4 item SHS should be .75, given an average reliability of .84. The factor loadings for the 3 item IHS with an average reliability of .84 were estimated at .80. The average correlation between the observed SHS and IHS in the data was r = .59, which gives an estimated latent variable correlation of .69. Given these estimated parameters and an average sample size of 246 participants across countries, we estimated the power to detect an effect between the two latent happiness variables to approach 1.\n\nNext, we conducted a power analyses using the lowest observed values, to determine the minimum power we could expect for any of our countries. The lowest reliability of the SHS was .59 (Senegal), so the estimated factor loadings were set to .51. For the IHS, the lowest reliability observed was .74 (Uganda), so the estimated factor loadings were set to .70. The smallest observed correlation between the two happiness measures was r = .26 (Indonesia), so using the lowest reliabilities we estimated the lowest correlation between the two latent variables to be .39. Lastly, power was calculated using these parameter estimates with the smallest sample in our data of 54 (Macedonia), resulting in power of .72 to detect an effect between the happiness measures. Given that there would still be reasonable power to detect an effect despite this exact combination of lowest possible parameters not actually appearing in our data, we concluded all of our country’s sample sizes were sufficient for estimating the latent relationship between the SHS and IHS.\n\nA model with the two latent happiness variables was first fitted using all of the data (see Fig 1). The first factor loadings for each measure were fixed to 1 and the SHS was set as the predictor variable. Results indicated overall good fit for the model (RMSEA = .06, CFI = .98). Unsurprisingly, the SHS was significantly related to the IHS, b = .31, β = .79, z = 72.99, p < .001. Next, the same model was used to calculate the relationship between the SHS and the IHS within each country. Results are presented in Table 7. The countries with the strongest standardized relationship between the SHS and the IHS were Hungary (β = .97), New Zealand and Romania (β = .93). The countries with the weakest standardized relationship between the two happiness measures were Indonesia (β = .31) and Uganda (β = .36). Both Western and Eastern European countries had the highest average association between the happiness measures (βMean = .85) while the lowest associations were found in African countries (βMean = .66). Overall, while the relationship between the two happiness measures varied across countries, the were no countries in which the two measures were unrelated or negatively associated with each other.\n\nNote. IHS = Interdependent Happiness Scale. SHS = Subjective Happiness Scale. Model fit statistics: RMSEA = .06, CFI = .98, R2 = .63. Estimate between SHS and IHS: β = .79, b = .31, z = 72.99, p < .001. IHS.1 was an average of the first 3 items on the IHS, IHS.2 was an average of the next 3 items on the IHS, and IHS.3 was an average of the last 3 items on the IHS.\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0242718.g001"
