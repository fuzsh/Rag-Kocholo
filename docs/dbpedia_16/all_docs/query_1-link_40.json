        "text": "(2 of 2)\n\nNot quite so embattled as these U. S. expatriates are the six native Mexican muralists. Two from Yucatan, Fernando Gamboa and Miguel Tzab, have done simple, Maya-like designs. Pedro Rendon applies himself to the Adulteration of Milk; Antonio Pujol to Cereals; Ramon Alva Guardarrama. eldest of the group, to a simple landscape of a Mexican wheat farm, hard and exact in detail.\n\nAngel Bracho, borrowing from Rivera's famed mural, has taken on Vitamins. A fish spews up Vitamin A, thoughtfully labeled, into one composition, dividing the subjects into the healthy Mexicans who get it, the dreadful wrecks who do not. In a companion piece the whole grains of rice and wheat divide the composition into B-glutted, sleek-skinned, joyful extraverts, and Bless emaciates with beriberi."
