        "text": "Finally having “Instagrammed” our past Mexico City- Puebla-Tlaxcala trip, I am ready to begin ravings on our upcoming September trip. A “few” photos of this past trip here, too:\n\nThis slideshow requires JavaScript.\n\nThis is an unusual business: one has a need to savour, relish and reflect on the most recent travel to Mexico. The very interesting, complex people– both participants and regional presenters– the breadth and scope of flavors, ingredients, knowledge and history behind each food shared with us make for deep brooding, and heartwarming reminiscing.\n\nBut ….onward to the next culinary adventure!\n\nSeptember 21–29, 2019\n\nMexico City-Querétaro-San Miguel de Allende\n\nThis trip is for food aficionados, starting and ending in Mexico City, where we will explore cultural and culinary delights, and onward to discover parts of colonial Mexico and local foods via Querétaro and mainly, San Miguel de Allende!\n\nIn San Miguel, a UNESCO Cultural heritage Site since 2008, we will discover Guanajuato and Querétaro’s little known delicious cuisines through our demos and classes in a private home, with chefs, and cooks. Beneath and beyond the foreign retirees and visiting nationals, a thriving local world of course, exists… And the setting is beautiful– colonial architecture, along with galleries, fine handicraft shops, traditional bakeries, and all sorts of bars, cafés and restaurants.\n\nPlan to arrive at least a day early to join our group from the very first gathering in Mexico City on Saturday, September 21, 2019 at 6pm.\n\nThe fee for this Culinary Adventure is $3750 double occupancy, $4000 single occupancy. As is custom these past 30+ years, our fee includes daily classes or demos, 8 nights hotel, at least two meals a day and all fees associated with the trip, excluding airfare. All classes include well-served tastings or meals– you do not go hungry on our trips!\n\nA $400 deposit is required to reserve a spot on our trip, with the balance due June 12th, 2019.\n\n[Please read our policies here https://culinaryadventuresinc.com/policies/]\n\nEmail Carmen now for questions and to sign up:\n\noffice@culinaryadventuresinc.com\n\n¡Hasta pronto!\n\nDates for our San Miguel de Allende Trip are September 21st – 29th, 2019!\n\nSign up now as we are already filling our roster…\n\nJoin us on an adventure to the high, fertile el Bajío (lowlands) region or heartland of Mexico, where vestiges of the colonial past stand as reminders of their Spanish domination both in San Miguel as in Querétaro.\n\nFrom chef classes to in-home meals, regional cooks to demos of local foods both pre-Colombian and post, along with our customary local cultural experiences, we will soak up the warmth of this region, with some time to roam and ramble throughout the charm of San Miguel… and of course, we include a taste of Mexico City. Contrasts- as always- on our culinary adventures!\n\n¡Nos veremos en septiembre!\n\nEmail Carmen to sign up plus more information at: office@culinaryadventuresinc.com\n\nWe are very happy to announce our March Culinary Adventure to the central high plateau of Mexico– Puebla and Tlaxcala!\n\nStarting off and ending in Mexico City, our very own Chef Ricardo Muñoz Zurita will launch us into this culinary world and recap at the end of our adventures. We will explore the colonial beauty of Puebla– which is Ana Elena Martínez‘s hometown, the small but mighty and historically weighty Tlaxcala– with Chef Irad Santacruz, Cooks Nicolás Hernández Muñoz and Dalia Rodríguez Hernández, delving into the distinctive, extraordinary foods that each place adds to Mexico’s soul satisfying gastronomy.\n\nPlan to arrive at least a day early to join our group from the very first gathering on Sunday, March 10th, 2019 at 6pm.\n\nThe fee for this culinary adventure is $3750 double occupancy, $4000 single occupancy.

After 33 years, we still get all revved up planning a new adventure!\n\nEmail Carmen now to sign up at: office@culinaryadventuresinc.com\n\n¡Hasta pronto!\n\nIf you have joined us in the past, you will recognized these two.\n\nAna Elena Martínez: quiet, dignified, tremendously talented, and kind. A chef and pastry specialist-including chocolate- in her own right, Ana Elena makes coordinating trips seem effortless. (She is also a great joy to have morning coffee with and muse on our days events.)\n\nRicardo Muñoz: What can I say? As pioneer chef of Mexican cuisine and ardent researcher of Mexican foods and ingredients, he has written many Mexican cookbooks including his Diccionario Enciclopédico de Gastronomía Mexicana [Encyclopedic Dictionary of Mexican Gastronomy] (Larousse, 2012), which awaiting final editing from the University of Texas Press for its English version. In August, 2016, the “Chevalier de l’Ordre Mondial de L’Académie Culinaire de France” was awarded to him. Ricardo is chef/owner of the Azul restaurants in Mexico City. And on our trips Ricardo brings a contagious joy and passion to his classes which is simply a delight to witness.\n\nMexico is a place that becomes etched upon your soul, through it’s people, and cultures. Oaxaca is one of the most dramatic of our regions. Our trip is filling up. Take the leap and sign up now!\n\n¡hasta pronto!\n\nCarmen\n\nWe have limited space and reservation time, so if interested in participating, a $400 deposit is due asap, balance, July 2. Celebrating our 30 years of pioneering culinary travel in Mexico, our Oaxaca Trip 2018 is $3750 and includes daily classes and demos, 8 nights hotel, two meals a day and all fees associated with the trip, excluding airfare. (Based on double occupancy, there is a $250 single supplement fee)\n\noffice@culinaryadventuresinc.com Carmen’s phone:760-577-2810\n\n“No es de donde es el ingrediente originario, sino lo que el ingrediente representa para una cultura” . “It’s not the origin of an ingredient that’s important, but what that ingredient represents for a culture.” –Chef Ricardo Muñoz Zurita\n\nThese words by Ricardo caught my attention before leaving to our Mexico City Chef’s Trip in January. They got me even more excited for the trip; the reunion with both Ricardo Muñoz and Ana Elena Martínez, our shared sense of purpose, the smells, sounds, colors of people, of foods, structures, skies–everything that makes your land of birth sing to you, always calling you home. These words especially got me looking forward to seeing our guests fall for Mexico and, “getting” the importance of what an ingredient can, indeed, represent for a culture.\n\nAnd fall they did. Some- once again, others- for the first time, others still- through our viewpoint. A marvelous combination of food people, from different backgrounds and cultures and culinary experiences. They soaked up the subtle difference of a cooked- as opposed to an uncooked- tomatillo in a “raw” salsa, our delicious mestizo food world and it’s class differences- visible in our cuisines, a joyful miscegenation of ingredients and techniques; the depths that corn reaches back into our culture, the soul food of Tlaxcala, a warm northerner’s rock and roll edgy cooking, the happily “surreal” idiosyncrasies of our country and their influence on a chef and perception of color, a chef’s conscientious quest to go back- and bring forward- old styles a la slow foods….Chefs Ricardo Muñoz, Josefina Santacruz, Irad Santacruz, Cooks Nicolas Hernández and Dalia Rodríguez, Chefs Antonio de Livier, Martha Ortíz and Gerardo Vázquez Lugo outdid themselves and REALLY showcased those ingredients and what they represent to our multi cultures of Mexico. I can’t thank them enough.\n\nWe will be posting photos of the trip now and then between sending out a cry for Oaxaca, which we shall visit in September at the end of the abundant harvests of rainy season. More to come on that fabulous trip!\n\nI had Ricardo’s words in my mind on the way to Mexico City. But they came back to me while reflecting on Marilyn Tausend’s departure and what she means to me, her unplanned influence on so many people over 30 years, her stubbornness for Mexico, for cooking, writing, learning and, connecting people. Her lost soul as a child, found again perhaps in Mexico, makes me realize that it is not her origin that is important, but what she means and represents to the Mexican culture and the world she created.\n\nMil gracias, Marilyn, q.e.p.d."
