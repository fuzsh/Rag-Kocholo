        "text": "James Outman homered on the first swing of his first big-league at-bat and finished with three hits and three RBIs as the Los Angeles Dodgers beat the Colorado Rockies 7-3 and closed out July with 21 victories.\n\nManny Machado was out of the lineup a day after spraining his left ankle, but Padres acting manager Ryan Flaherty is optimistic the All-Star third baseman won’t need to go on the injured list.\n\nSan Diego Padres All-Star slugger Manny Machado wasn’t in the lineup a day after spraining his left ankle and acting manager Ryan Flaherty was optimistic his former teammate won’t need to go on the injured list.\n\nThe San Diego Padres will see how star third baseman Manny Machado is feeling, a day after he sprained his left ankle while taking a tumble running out a grounder.\n\nMiguel Cabrera needed only one at-bat on Saturday to deliver his long-awaited 3,000th career hit, quickly reaching the mark as the Detroit Tigers routed the Colorado Rockies 13-0 in the opener of a day-night doubleheader.\n\nDetroit Tigers star Miguel Cabrera has gotten the 3,000th hit of his decorated career, becoming the 33rd major leaguer to reach the mark and the first player from Venezuela to accomplish the feat.\n\nScherzer will make his Nationals-record sixth opening day start April 1, facing the New York Mets in Washington. The original lineup released by Washington before the game featured a designated hitter; that was revised to include Scherzer batting for himself. DeGrom struck him out, part of his 4 2/3 scoreless innings with three hits and five Ks. YANKEES 8, BLUE JAYS 3Gerritt Cole struck out eight in five innings, allowing one run in his fourth spring start for New York. BRAVES 11, RAYS 1Atlanta starter Max Fried gave up three hits and struck out five over six innings.\n\nTrailing 3-2, the 40-year-old Pujols lined a fastball from Carlos Estevez (1-3) into the empty seats in left-center for his 660th homer. Pujols now trails only Barry Bonds (762), Hank Aaron (755), Babe Ruth (714) and Alex Rodriguez (696) on the career home run list. It was a crazy day at the plate for the Angels, who had more walks (10) than hits (six). The Angels took two of three from Rockies and wrapped up a six-game trip with a 3-3 mark. If you’re good, you’re young and you’re not hurt, you’ll work through it.\n\n(AP Photo/David Zalubowski)DENVER Charlie Blackmon raised his batting average to an amazing .500 with three more hits, including a key double during a six-run burst in the eighth inning that led the Colorado Rockies over the Arizona Diamondbacks 8-7 Tuesday night. Blackmon doubled off Kevin Ginkel (0-1) during the Rockies' big inning that made it 8-2. Gallen went seven innings and allowed two runs on seven hits, with seven strikeout and no walks. Kyle Freeland went seven innings for Colorado and allowed two runs on seven hits. UP NEXT Arizona RHP Luke Weaver (0-3, 12.19 ERA) returns to the mound seeking his first win of the season.\n\n(AP Photo/David Zalubowski)DENVER Starling Marte homered and drove in four runs as the Arizona Diamondbacks battered the Colorado Rockies 13-7 Wednesday in a Coors Field slugfest featuring 34 hits, but none by blistering Charlie Blackmon. Blackmon began the game batting an astonishing .500 for the Rockies. Blackmon was on deck when Trevor Story, who doubled twice and singled, grounded into a game-ending double play. Rockies: Following an off day Thursday, the Rockies begin a stretch of 20 games in 20 days starting Friday night in a series opener against the Texas Rangers. Colorado RHP Ryan Castellani (0-0, 0.00 ERA) is slated to start against the Rangers RHP Lance Lynn (2-0, 1.16 ERA)."
