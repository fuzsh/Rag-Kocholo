        "text": "A while back, DBM asked if we would do a little background story on Dino Ebel, the Dodgers 3rd base coach. So, I told Jeff I would do it. He sent me some sites with additional information, and I am grateful for the help.\n\nEbel was born on March, 30, 1966 in Barstow California. After graduating from high school, he went to San Bernardino Valley College where he was drafted in the 27th round by the Phillies in 1986. But he elected to go to Florida Southern College and was a member of the 1988 NCAA Division II Championship team.\n\nHe signed with the Dodgers as a free agent in 1988. He was named the GCL player of the year in 1988 for the GCL Dodgers…that is the Gulf Coast League. In 1989 he went to the Vero Beach Dodgers and was a member of the 1990 FSL League Champion team.\n\nIn 1991, Ebel was promoted to the Albuquerque Dukes of the PCL where he was a utility player. But Ebel only played 2 games at AAA. Most of his time was spent in A ball with a short sting at AA San Antonio thrown in.\n\nHe also played ball in the 89,90, and 91 off seasons for the Adelaide Giants of the Australian Baseball League, a Dodger affiliate. In 1991, he became a player coach for the Bakersfield Dodgers, a position he held until 1994.\n\nHe coached with the San Antonio Missions of the Texas League for 2 years, and then in 1997, he began his managerial career taking over San Bernardino late in the year. In 1998 he managed Great Falls. From 1999 until 2004, he managed various teams in the Dodger organization, usually at the lower levels.\n\nIn 2005, after 17 years with the Dodgers, Ebel joined the Angels and became a coach with the Salt Lake Stingers of the PCL. When Maddon left the Angels to manage the Rays, Ebel took over as the Angels 3rd base coach. With Ebel at 3rd, the Angels were a much more aggressive team on the basepaths.\n\nThey had adopted a sort of NL brand of baseball. Probably due to the influence of Ebel, and Mike Scioscia, who both were long time members of NL franchises. In 2013, Ebel succeeded Rob Picciolo who had been fired as the bench coach.\n\nEbel is well known for his loud whistle, which he uses to relay defensive alignments such as shifts during games. His minor league managerial record is 531-496 in 8 seasons. In 2018 he went back to being the Angels 3rd base coach when Ron Roenicke was named the bench coach of the Red Sox.\n\nThen on the 28th of November, 2018, he was named the new 3rd base coach of the Dodgers. Ebel has added that aggressive nature to the Dodgers base running game, and he is one of the more active 3rd base coaches you will ever see. Always moving in the coaching box.\n\nBut Ebel likes to give back. He returns to Barstow often to hold clinics for young players. He has been doing that for 11 years. He was joined in the 2020 clinic by big league pitcher, Aaron Sanchez. Sanchez is also a Barstow native. The clinic’s give the kids hope by seeing that other members of their city have made it in professional baseball. And they learn skills to help their game.\n\nI am not sure if Covid will allow the clinic this year, probably not. But you can bet as soon as the restrictions are gone, Ebel will be out there teaching the game.\n\nEbel has become a very valuable member of Roberts staff. He is exuberant on the field and has the respect of the Dodger players. He also is a creature of habit. Every morning he goes to the gym and does a 30 minute 4 mile run.\n\nBut what he does for breakfast, well, I could not do that. He goes to Starbucks, gets 4 of their tubs of oatmeal, some blueberries, and walnuts. He brings this home and mixes it all together. That is his breakfast. Sorry, I have a tummy ache!\n\nDino is married to Shannon. They have 2 kids. His biggest thrill prior to this season was being a member of the organization when they won in 1988. His second floor man cave in his home holds 32 years of baseball memories. Autographed bats, balls, photos. He is still close friends with Albert Pujols and has commemorative bats from his homers.\n\nEbel will be entering his 3rd year as a Dodger coach. A post he hopes to man for many more years."
