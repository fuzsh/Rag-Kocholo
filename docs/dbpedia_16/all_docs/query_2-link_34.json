It changes in response to the needs of artists and informs and engages the public about their work.\n\nArt in General was founded in 1981 by artists Martin Weinstein and Teresa Liszka in the General Hardware buildingâhence the name âArt in General.â Weinstein and Liszka aimed to create a space where artists could exhibit unconventional work and exchange ideas with their peers. The first exhibition took place in 1982. In its twenty-five years, the organization has emerged as one of New York Cityâs leading nonprofit arts organizations.\n\nToday, Art in General fulfills its mission through a variety of ways, including the organization and presentation of exhibitions, hosting a national and international artist residency program, and through educational in-school art training, regular public programs and membership events. Beginning in 2005, its exhibition program has focused on the commissioning of new work from artists.\n\nScope and Content\n\nThe records at Art in General document the history of this alternative art space, which has promoted international contemporary art since its foundation. Their website lists all archived programs since the formation of Art in General.\n\nThe archives of Art in General consist mainly of operational records such as exhibition files and photography documenting exhibitions and programs. The gallery files start in 1982, although there are no Latino or Latin American artists until 1987. Art in General has published catalogues and brochures documenting the work of many Latin American and Latino artists.\n\nOverall holdings of archives and research material: Fifty-four linear feet\n\nOverall holdings of archives and research material related to Latino art: Ten linear feet\n\nInclusive dates of files: 1982âpresent\n\nBulk dates: 1987âpresent\n\nLanguages in which records are written:\n\nEnglish (85%); Spanish (10%); other (5%)\n\nHoldings - Primary Sources\n\nArchives of institutionâs history and operation related to Latino art:\n\nTen linear feet\n\nThe operation records from 1982 to 2002 are located on the fourth floor. Those from 2003 to the present are located in the office space on the sixth floor. Most of these records are gallery files documenting exhibitions that have taken place at Art in General. Within the gallery records artist sub-files can be found. They are organized using a coding system developed by Art in General based on the location of the exhibition in their space (i.e. Audio in the Elevator, Window Installation/Project Space, Gallery 4, and Gallery 6). Records in those categories are classified chronologically by exhibition history.\n\nExhibition files include records from solo shows by artists Alberto Casado, MarÃ­a Elena GonzÃ¡lez, CÃ©sar Paternosto, and Cecilia VicuÃ±a. Art in General also has the archival records of group shows that included Latino and Latin American artists such as Abel Barroso, Tania Bruguera, Los Carpinteros, Sandra Ceballos, Claudio Nolasco, Carlos Garaicoa, Silvia Gruner, NadÃ­n Ospina, Manuel PiÃ±a, and LÃ¡zaro Savaadra. These exhibitions included AdiÃ³s Columbus: Vistas Latinas Part IV (Sept.âNov. 1992), Domestic Partnerships: New Impulses in Decorative Arts from the Americas (AprilâJune 1996), 1990s Art From Cuba (May-June 1998), Re-Drawing the Line (Sept.âOct. 2000) and Between Two Cities/Punto de vista: entre dos ciudades (Nov. 1999âJan. 2000). Various Latino and Latin American artists and scholars, such as MÃ³nica Amor, Charles Byasini-Rivera, Ernesto Pujol, YasmÃ­n RamÃ­rez, Juana ValdÃ©s, and Raul Zamudio, have collaborated in some of these exhibitions as curators, organizers, and writers.\n\nArchival holdings pertaining to Latino art also include the records of exhibitions organized as part of the Artists in Residency program. These have included: Carlos Garaicoa (1996); AimÃ©e GarcÃ­a, Embracing the Earth/Abrazando la Tierra, Gallery 4 (MayâJune 1998); Flavia Gandolfo, A Contemporary Fresco Mural/Mural ContemporÃ¡neo al Fresco (Aug.âOct. 2001), Anna Maria Maiolino, N Times One/N Vezes Um (Dec. 2001âFeb. 2002); JosÃ© A. Toirac with collaborator Meira Marrero DÃ­az, Think Different (AprilâMay 2002), Javier TÃ©llez, Blind Data *Oct.âDec. 2002); Luis GÃ³mez (JanâMar. 2004); RubÃ©n Ortiz Torres (Sept.âNov. 2004), and Chemi Rosado (Oct.âDec. 2005).\n\nNewsletters and magazines published in-house:\n\nArt in General has published Inside, a quarterly newsletter/invitation, since 1990. Past copies are available at the institution.\n\nSlides and photographs:\n\nThirty-four items\n\nThirty-four binders with slides and photographs document the work of artists that Art in General has showcased. Photographs include general pictures representative of the artistsâ production, as well as the works that have been exhibited at Art in General.\n\nDigital images:\n\nRecent artist and exhibition files may have some digital images on CDs.\n\nArt objects and artifacts available for research:\n\nThe artwork available for research consists of Art in Generalâs âLimited Editions,â series of signed and numbered prints, photographs, sculptures, and objects created by contemporary artists who have donated their work to support exhibitions and programs by emerging artists and public and educational programs. As of January 2005 the Limited Editions have included works by Allora & Calzadilla, Maria Elena GonzÃ¡lez, and Carlos Garaicoa. For current information, please visit the institutionâs website.\n\nExhibition catalogues published in-house that include work by Latino artists:\n\nNine items\n\nSome titles include 1990s Art from Cuba: A National Residency and Exhibition Program (1997); Cloud-net (2000); Tonel: Lessons of Solitude (2001); Un real estates: Maria Elena GonzÃ¡lez (2003); Alberto Casado: todo clandestino, todo popular (2005). Art in General has also published brochures documenting the work of its artists in residence. Among these are Flavia Gandolfo (2001); AimÃ©e GarcÃ­a (1998); Luis GÃ³mez (2004); Anna Maria Maiolino (2002); Javier TÃ©llez (2002); and JosÃ© A. Toirac and Meira Marrero DÃ­az (2002).\n\nHoldings - Secondary Sources\n\nVertical file materials related to Latino art: artist files, brochures, pamphlets, clippings:\n\nArtist sub-files can be found within the gallery files.\n\nHoldings - Finding Aids\n\nThe current finding aid consists of an exhibition history. At the present, Art in General is cataloguing its archival holdings using a catalog system provided by Franklin Furnace. This catalog will eventually be accessible online.\n\nAccessibility\n\nCurrently, there is no space designated for researchers who wish to consult Art in Generalâs records. Nonetheless the institutionâs staff will be happy to arrange desk space upon availability for scheduled researchers.\n\nRestrictions\n\nResearchers can access records by appointment.\n\nGeneral Assessment\n\nThe archives of Art in General document the history of this important alternative art space in New York. The gallery records are of particular interest, due to the importance of Art in General as a jumping-off point for many contemporary Latino and Latin American artists. Exhibitions such as Domestic Partnerships, curated by Yasmin RamÃ­rez, and 1990s Art from Cuba, co-directed by Holly Block and Bettie-Sue Hertz, were among the first shows in the U.S. to give exposure to the 1990s generation of artists from Cuba.\n\nThe systematic organization of these archives makes them easily searchable.\n\nRelations to other Latino and Latin American organizations\n\nThe gallery has collaborated with other Latino and Latin American art organizations such as the Centro Wifredo Lam, the Ludwig Foundation in Cuba, and Havana Art & Idea in Mexico City Centro.\n\nBronx Council of the Arts (BCA)\n\n1738 Hone Avenue (main office)\n\nBronx, NY 10461-1486\n\nTel.: (718) 931-9500\n\nhttp://www.bronxarts.org\n\nLongwood Arts Project (LAP)\n\nGallery, Hostos Community College\n\n450 Grand Concourse\n\nBronx, NY 10451\n\nTel.: (718) 518-6728\n\nFax: (718) 518-6690\n\nhttp://www.longwoodcyber.org\n\nContact\n\nWilliam Aguado (BCA), Executive Director\n\n[email protected]\n\nEdwin RamorÃ¡n (LAP), Gallery Director and Curator\n\n[email protected]\n\nHours open to the public\n\nMondayâThursday, 9:30 a.m.â5:30 p.m.\n\nThe archival collections at both institutions can be viewed by appointment only.\n\nHistory of the Institution\n\nFounded in the early 1960s, the Bronx Council on the Arts (BCA) is a non-profit organization whose mission is to encourage and increase the publicâs awareness and participation in the arts, and to nurture the development of artists and cultural organizations. Longwood Arts Project (LAP) is the visual arts program of the Bronx Council on the Arts. LAPâs mission is to raise the profile and the technical/creative ceiling of artists from under-represented groups, including women and artists of color. It does so through exhibitions at the Longwood Art Gallery at Hostos Community College and the Longwood Cyber Residency and Exhibition Program.\n\nInitiated by the BCA in 1981, LAP was founded under the direction of artist Fred Wilson in the former Public School 39 at 986 Longwood Avenue in the Bronx. The school was closed due to attrition of school-age children in the district at that time, when the area was physically and economically devastated. Community leaders turned the unfortunate closure into an opportunity to help stabilize the neighborhood by developing it into a multi-service building with city agencies and non-profit organizations as its tenants.\n\nFrom 1981 to 2002 LAP occupied ten rooms on the second floor of the Longwood building. From the onset, most of the rooms were turned into artist studios that were available as part of the Scholarship Studio Programs or at a subsidized rental fee. Past resident artists include Ernesto Pujol and PepÃ³n Osorio. In 1985, the Project established the Longwood Arts Gallery with a strong commitment to presenting works by contemporary local, national, and international artists in its thematic and solo exhibitions.\n\nIn 1991, a second gallery was created to focus on Bronx-based artists. The exhibition program at the gallery has addressed urban conditions and space, national and cultural identity, immigration, violence, racism, the environment, street culture, local Bronx history, and popular culture.\n\nIn the autumn of 2002, the PS 39 building at 965 Longwood Avenue was converted back into a school administered by the NYC Board of Education. A year later LAP relocated its office and Cyber Residency Program to La Casa Blanca at Pregones Theater (www.pregones.org), at 571 Walton Avenue, in the South Bronx. One block east of their new offices at Pregones Theater, they established a new exhibition program known as Longwood Art Gallery at Hostos in cooperation with the Hostos Center for the Arts & Culture on the campus of Hostos Community College at 450 Grand Concourse. LAP continues promoting the creative visions of artists living in the Bronx and fostering exchange between these artists and their community.\n\nScope and Content\n\nThe Archives of BCA/LAP contain all the administrative documents related to their organization and management of cultural services and arts programs in the Bronx. BCA has an independent artist program named BRIO, through which they support artists who are Bronx residents. Approximately forty percent of the funds managed by BCA are related to the visual arts. About one-third of the artists who have received funds are Latino. In other words, between twelve and fifteen percent of the total funds granted by BCA are dedicated to Latino artists.\n\nThe BCA collects records they generate, as well as the records of visual artists, writers, and musicians that apply for their grants and programs. The records at the Longwood Arts Project pertain to the exhibitions they have organized. LAP collects vertical files on artists the gallery has showcased.\n\nOverall holdings of archives and research material:\n\nBCA: 850 linear feet\n\nLAP: Forty linear feet\n\nOverall holdings of archives and research material on Latino art:\n\nBCA: Eighty linear feet\n\nLAP: Sixteen linear feet (40% of their archival records)\n\nInclusive dates of files: (BCA and LAP) 1985âpresent\n\nBulk dates: (BCA and LAP) 1990s-present\n\nLanguages in which records are written:\n\nMainly English\n\nHoldings - Primary Sources\n\nArchives of institutionâs history and operation:\n\nBCA: Twenty-seven linear feet\n\nLAP: Twelve linear feet\n\nThe BCAâs institutional papers generated before 1990 are stored at the Bronx Historical Society. The estimate of twenty-seven linear feet of institutional records on Latino and Latin American artists stored onsite at the BCA was obtained by multiplying 560 linear feet (the total of operation records) by forty percent (percentage of records on visual arts), and multiplying the result by twelve percent (percentage of records pertaining to Latino and Latin American artists).\n\nThe Longwood Arts Project holds 2.25 linear feet of operational papers at the BCA site and 9.75 at their own site. These records are exhibition files comprising curatorial statements, artistsâ statements, exhibition loan forms, resumes, correspondence, slides, videos, photographic materials, and supplementary research materials such as exhibition announcements, articles, and reviews.\n\nNewsletters and magazines published in-house:\n\nBCA published a newsletter until 2001. Currently they publish a bimonthly or quarterly leaflet with opportunities for artists. BCA also publishes monthly updates on the Internet and a yearly journal that started circa 1991â92.\n\nOral histories\n\nBCA has oral histories with cultural activists pertaining to the âCasitasâ project, which documented the cultural centers in New York built after the model of wooden houses in Puerto Ricoâs countryside. The recorded interviews are stored at BCA. This project became a traveling exhibition in 1991 titled âLas Casitas: An Urban Cultural Alternativeâ organized by the Smithsonian Institution.\n\nRecorded interviews and performances:\n\nTen items\n\nA video produced for the âCasitasâ project is available to researchers at BCA. LAP holds recorded performances by artists such as Josely Carvalho, Claudia Joskovicz, and Paul Henry RamÃ­rez, among others. Items are on DVD and VHS formats.\n\nSlides and photographs:\n\n1,000 items\n\nThere is no registry of slides at BCA. LAP holds un-catalogued slides of artists such as Freddy HernÃ¡ndez, Manny Vega, the artists in residence at BCA, and recipients of the Community Arts Grants. The artists in residence are listed by year on LAPâs website.\n\nDigital images:\n\nOver 200 items\n\nSome of the artists whose work is documented digitally at LAP include Judith Escalona, Marcos Dimas, George Crespo, Wanda Raimundi-Ortiz, and Jaime Permuth. Some of these images are accessible at the galleryâs website.\n\nArt objects and artifacts available for research:\n\nFive items\n\nThese include some murals that were taken down from the original site of Longwood Arts Project and are now stored at BCA. Esperanza CortÃ©s and Ernesto Pujol were among the artists who participated in the creation of these murals. BCA also owns a print by John âCrashâ Matos.\n\nLAP does not own artwork by Latino artists.\n\nExhibition catalogues published in-house that include work by Latino artists:\n\nTwo items\n\nLAP published annual journals for years 1992/1993 and 1993/1994. These feature curatorial statements and essays by Bettie Sue Hertz, Edwin PagÃ¡n, and YasmÃ­n RamÃ­rez, among others, who wrote on the artists showcased at LAP during the years of this publication. Artists discussed include Carlos Barbot, Daniel del Valle, Luis Flores, MarÃ­a Mar, Carlos Ortiz, Ernesto Pujol, EurÃ­pedes RodrÃ­guez, Juan SÃ¡nchez, and Kukuli Velarde.\n\nHoldings - Secondary Sources\n\nExhibition catalogues, books, and periodicals related to Latino art:\n\nTwelve linear feet\n\nLAP has a small library primarily for internal use. It includes catalogues for solo exhibitions of numerous artists whose work has been exhibited at LAP. Among these there are catalogues for solo exhibitions of Dina Bursztyn and Grimanesa AmorÃ³s.\n\nFilms by or about Latinos:\n\nThirty items\n\nLAP keeps approximately thirty videotapes related to Latino art. They are divided into performance art, symposia, and panel discussions. The videos include a recording of the public program Artists in Cuba, organized in conjunction with the exhibition 1990s Art from Cuba held at Art in General (1997); AztlÃ¡n Today, a program organized for the traveling exhibition Chicano Art Resistance and Affirmation (1991); Images of MemoryâCuba & the 6th Havana Biennial (1997); Vanessa Aquino: Child Cries Freedom; and Paul Henry Ramirez: Unruly Acts (1998).\n\nVertical file materials related to Latino art: artist files, brochures, pamphlets, clippings\n\n5.75 linear feet\n\nLAP holds an artists registry with artist files. The artists represented include Luis Cruz Azaceta, DiÃ³genes Ballester, RocÃ­o Cabello, William CÃ³rdova, Humberto ChÃ¡vez, Marcos Dimas, MarÃ­a DomÃ­guez, Esperanza CortÃ©s, Tatiana Garmendia, FÃ©lix GonzÃ¡lez-Torres, Marina GutiÃ©rrez, Renny Molenaar, Wanda Raimundi-Ortiz, Juan SÃ¡nchez, Elaine Soto, Nitza TufiÃ±o, Virginia Ayress, among others. Not all the artists showcased at Longwood have artist files. Artist files are not regularly updated, except for artists shown since 2002 and past Resident Artists and Commissions Artists.\n\nHoldings - Finding Aids\n\nLAP is working on an artist registry for their records.\n\nAccessibility\n\nThe records at BCA and LAP have been developed for internal use. At BCA the records are not separated according to artistic genre (e.g. music, literature, visual arts). It is up to the researcher to go through these materials and sort out the projects related to visual arts and to Latino artists. The records at BCA are stored in a basement. There is no study space designated for researchers.\n\nRecords at the LAP are easier to consult due to their location in the gallery space and because of their focus on the visual arts. There is no space designated for researchers at LAP, but the gallery staff is willing to receive researchers and to assist them with their queries.\n\nRestrictions\n\nFinancial information of BCA and LAP is confidential.\n\nGeneral Assessment\n\nFor over forty years the Bronx Council on the Arts has been a major funder and promoter of arts in the Bronx. Thus, its archives constitute an important record on the development of music, literature, and visual arts in that borough. Some Latino visual artists that have benefited from their support, and who may be documented in the BCAâs archival records include Arthur AvilÃ©s, Marcos Dimas, Carlos Ortiz, Moses Ros, Joe Wippler, and dance and visual arts organization PepatiÃ¡n. Through its cyber residency and its gallery, the Longwood Art Project has been instrumental in facilitating and showcasing the projects of both established and emerging Latino visual artists. The artist registry and the exhibition records at LAP reflect this long trajectory and offer valuable information on artists whose works are not extensively documented elsewhere.\n\nRelations to other Latino and Latin American organizations\n\nBCA/LAP have worked in collaboration with the following Latino art institutions: the Association of Hispanic Arts, The Bronx Museum of the Arts, El Centro de Estudios PuertorriqueÃ±os, En Foco, Hostos Community College, Lehman College, MediaNoche, El Museo del Barrio, PepatiÃ¡n, Pregones Theater, PR Dream, and Taller Boricua.\n\nThe Bronx Museum of the Arts\n\n1040 Grand Concourse\n\nBronx, NY 10456\n\nTel.

The Museum functioned as a small exhibition space within the Bronx Courthouse until 1982, when it moved to its current location. The Bronx Museum of the Arts seeks to collect, conserve, interpret, and exhibit twentieth- and twenty-first-century works by artists of Latin American, Asian, and African descent and artists with strong ties to the Bronx.\n\nScope and Content\n\nWhile the Museum has no formal archival collection policy, the content of the museumâs records reflects its mission to collect works from the latter half of the twentieth century to the present by artists of Latin American, Asian, and African descent and artists with strong ties to the Bronx. Records pertaining to Latino artists are estimated to represent 1/8 of the total records of the museum.\n\nThe Museumâs slide collection is organized into three sub-groups: collection slides, artist slides, and installation slides. Artist files are subdivided into files of artists in the permanent collection, and general artist files, which contain information on artists who have been part of the Artists in the Marketplace program (see Secondary Sources), artists who have exhibited at the BxMA, and artists being considered for future exhibitions. Slides and artist files are organized in alphabetical order and not divided by ethnic background.\n\nOverall holdings of archives and research material: 120 linear feet\n\nOverall holdings of archives and research material related to Latino art: Thirty-two linear feet\n\nInclusive dates of files: 1920âpresent\n\nBulk dates: 1970âpresent\n\nLanguages in which records are written:\n\nEnglish, Spanish, Portuguese (5%)\n\nHoldingsâPrimary Sources\n\nArchives of institutionâs history and operation related to Latino art:\n\nFive linear feet\n\nNewsletters and magazines published in-house:\n\nTwo linear feet\n\nThe BxMA published a museum newsletter from 1981 until 1991\n\nRecorded interviews and performances:\n\nFifteen items\n\nThese include performances by PepÃ³n Osorio and PepatiÃ¡n.\n\nSlides and photographs:\n\n1,720 items\n\nThis includes fifty slides and transparencies of collection objects created by Latino artists, 1,300 slides of exhibition installations including Latino artists, and 370 miscellaneous slides collected by curators or donated by Latino artists. These slides include works by Rimer Cardillo, Valeska Soares, Luis JimÃ©nez, and Ester HernÃ¡ndez, among others. Slides cannot be checked out, but duplicates can be purchased for research purposes.\n\nArt objects and artifacts available for research:\n\n165 items\n\nThe BxMA has an outstanding collection of works on paper by Latin American and Latino artists, including Ana Mendieta, Roberto Juarez, and Juan SÃ¡nchez, as well as sub-collections of prints from Argentina and Puerto Rico and many prints and drawings by Chicano/a artists like Ester HernÃ¡ndez and Luis JimÃ©nez. Researchers may be granted authorization by the curators to view these items closely.\n\nExhibition catalogues published in-house that include work by Latino artists:\n\nEighteen items\n\nSome important titles include The Latin American Spirit: Art and Artists in the United States 1920â1970, Luis Cancel, ed. (1988); Rimer Cardillo: Araucaria, Marysol Nieves, ed. (1998). Raquel Rabinovich: Invisible Cities (1986). Annual AIM (Artist in the Marketplace) catalogues from 1984 to the present include Latino artists.\n\nHoldingsâSecondary Sources\n\nExhibition catalogues, books, and periodicals related to Latino art:\n\nEight linear feet\n\nBooks are for internal use and are located in curatorsâ workspace. Some titles on Latino art include CARA: Chicano Art Resistance and Affirmation Richard Griswold del Castillo, Teresa McKenna, and Yvonne Yarbro-Bejarano eds. (1991), and Chicano Annotated Bibliography (1995) Shifra Goldman and TomÃ¡s Ybarra-Frausto eds. (1985).\n\nVertical file materials related to Latino art: artist files, brochures, pamphlets, clippings:\n\nFifteen linear feet\n\nThe vertical file materials are organized in alphabetical order. They are composed of artist files containing clippings, rÃ©sumÃ©s, and slides of artists who have exhibited their work at the BxMA, including Liliana Porter, Juan SÃ¡nchez, and Ernesto Pujol. The artist files also contain material on every artist who has participated in the AIM (Artists in the Marketplace) program. Every year this program provides exhibition opportunities and artistic training for thirty-six emerging artists chosen by the Bronx Museum. The program has been ongoing for twenty-four years and has included many artists from New Yorkâs Latino community such as Miguel Luciano, DiÃ³genes Ballester, and Sandra BermÃºdez. Additionally, there are numerous artist files generated by the curatorial staff to serve their exhibition needs.\n\nFollowing the mission of the BxMA, the artists files focus on artists of Latin American, Asian, and African descent, as well as artists with strong ties to the Bronx. Approximately 1/8 of the artist files are dedicated to Latino artists.\n\nThere is also a section of the vertical files dedicated to artists who have works in the permanent collection of the BxMA; Latino artists like Ana Mendieta, PepÃ³n Osorio, and Ester HernÃ¡ndez are included. The BxMA has a permanent collection of 800 works of art; approximately 1/16 of this collection is devoted to works by artists of Latin American descent.\n\nArtist files are generated as new exhibitions take place at the BxMA or as new works of art are added to the permanent collection.\n\nHoldingsâFinding Aids\n\nThere is a database for the collection, but not for the archives.\n\nAccessibility\n\nThe museum currently lacks the infrastructure to facilitate scholarly use of its archives. The archives are spread throughout several rooms in the museum and access to them is only possible by appointment and with prior knowledge of the files to be researched. However, the BxMA plans to organize a small library for internal use as well as archives accessible to the general public.\n\nRestrictions\n\nThe BxMA restricts access to selected records, some of which are confidential. Special permission from the curator is required to view the Museumâs files. Some artistsâ files or collection files contain confidential information such as personal addresses or phone numbers.\n\nGeneral Assessment\n\nThe content of the museumâs archive reflects the institutionâs mission to collect works from the latter half of the twentieth century to the present by artists of Latin American, Asian, and African descent and by artists with strong ties to the Bronx. The artist files are the strength of the BxMAâs research materials. They are an excellent resource for information on many emerging Latino artists (especially those who participated in the AIM Program) as well as more established Latino and Latin American contemporary artists that have exhibited at the BxMA, including Josely Carvalho, Liliana Porter, and PepÃ³n Osorio. Researchers may access videotaped walk-throughs of previous exhibitions.\n\nThe BxMA has a valuable slide collection of Latino and Latin American contemporary artists who are rarely represented in other slide collections around the city.\n\nHowever, the BxMAâS files are fairly difficult to access because the museum does not have an area reserved for researchers, and materials can therefore only be viewed upon advanced request.\n\nRelations to other Latino and Latin American organizations\n\nThe multidisciplinary Latino art organization PepatiÃ¡n, regularly presents projects at the BxMA. In 1986 The Bronx Museum produced an exhibition with the Puerto Rican photography collective En Foco. In its early years the BxMA also collaborated with El Taller Boricua.\n\nEl Centro de Estudios PuertorriqueÃ±os/The Center for Puerto Rican StudiesâLibrary & Archives\n\nHunter College\n\n695 Park Avenue, Room E 1429\n\nNew York, NY 10021\n\nTel.

The mission of El Centroâs Library is twofold. One part of that mission is to collect, preserve, and provide access to archival and library resources documenting the history and culture of Puerto Ricans. The other is to produce, facilitate, and disseminate interdisciplinary research about the diasporic experiences of Puerto Ricans and to link scholarly inquiry to social action and policy debates.\n\nScope and Content\n\nThe collection includes books, periodicals, audio and video tapes, manuscripts, photographs, prints, and recorded music documenting the history and culture of Puerto Ricans who migrated to the United States and Puerto Ricans on the island.\n\nThe photographs in El Centroâs collection are of particular interest as many of them are both art works and historic material documenting the Puerto Rican diaspora. El Centroâs holdings in books and catalogues related to Latino visual arts production, while limited, include rare and out-of-print books, making it a valuable resource. Among those books are Peter Blochâs Puerto Rican Painting (1978) and catalogues from recent and past Â exhibitions of Puerto Rican artists in the island and the mainland. El Centro holds also a growing collection of artist files.\n\nOverall holdings of archives and research material: 4,000 linear feet\n\nOverall holdings of archives and research material on Latino art: 129 linear feet\n\nInclusive dates of files: 1900âpresent\n\nBulk dates: 1940âpresent\n\nLanguages in which records are written:\n\nEnglish, Spanish. Finding aids are bilingual.\n\nHoldingsâPrimary Sources\n\nPersonal papers of artists, critics or art historians associated with Latino art:\n\nEight linear feet\n\nThese include the personal papers of writer Clemente Soto VÃ©lez, which contain numerous materials related to art, including works on paper by Nuyorican artists such as Jorge Soto, MeriÃ¡n Soto and her dance company PepatiÃ¡n, and PepÃ³n Osorio, among others. El Centro also holds the personal papers of literary critic and art collector Rafael RodrÃ­guez, which contain material related to the visual arts. El Centro holds as well the personal papers of art historian Mario CÃ©sar Romero, a long-time resident of El Barrio, East Harlem. Â\n\nArchives of institutionâs history and operation related to Latino art:\n\n42.2 linear feet\n\nThese include, among other holdings, the records generated for the symposium Assessment and Valuation of Puerto Rican, Chicano, Latino, and Hispanic-Caribbean Art, co-organized by The Center for Puerto Rican Studies, the Inter-University Program for Latino Research, Notre Dame, and Appraisers Association of America, Inc. This event was held on May 20â21, 2005 at Hunter College. Records include as well the exhibition files generated by El Centro for the artists showcased since the inception of their gallery program in 2003.\n\nNewsletters and magazines published in-house:\n\nSince 1994 El Centro publishes Centro Journal, a peer-reviewed academic journal dedicated to the Puerto Rican diaspora. The Fall 2005 issue of this journal is titled âPuerto Rican Visual artists and the United Statesâ and was edited by YasmÃ­n RamÃ­rez. The work of artists NÃ©stor Otero, Marcos Dimas, Fernando Salicrup, and Rafael Trelles and others has appeared on the cover of this journal. El Centro recently published a two-volume CD-Rom entitled Puerto Ricans in the USA: 1898â1999. El Centro also publishes a bi-annual newsletter. The Centro Journal and the newsletter can be accessed online on El Centroâs website.\n\nRecorded interviews and performances:\n\n57 items\n\nThese include all the interviews with personalities of art and culture conducted by YasmÃ­n RamÃ­rez for her doctoral dissertation on Nuyorican art. Those interviewed include: Jack AgÃ¼eros, Brenda Alejandro, DiÃ³genes Ballester, Petra Barreras, Antonio Bechara, Marimar BenÃ­tez, Peter Bloch, Charles Biasiny Rivera, Luis Cancel, Evelyn Collazo, Papo Colo, Rafael ColÃ³n Morales, Marcos Dimas, Adrian GarcÃ­a, Chino GarcÃ­a, Antonio Martorell, Irving McManus, Rafael MontaÃ±ez OrtÃ­z, Isabel Nazario, Carmen Nelson, PepÃ³n Osorio, Dylcia Pagan, Gladys PeÃ±a, Nilda Peraza, Geno RodrÃ­guez, Federico Ruiz, Fernando Salicrup, Juan SÃ¡nchez, Nitza TufiÃ±o, and Rafael TufiÃ±o. El Centro holds as well a video produced for the 30 Year Portfolio of Digital Prints published by Taller Boricua, and a video by Rafael MontaÃ±ez-Ortiz titled âIntrospective: Selection of works from 1950â1990.â These items are on VHS, mini-DV, and audiotape formats.\n\nSlides and photographs:\n\n25,000 items (seventy linear feet)\n\nThese include the photographs from the Office of Information of Puerto Rico, which contain images by Jack Delano, Edwin and Louise Rosskam, Charles Rotkin and others photographers who documented life in Puerto Rico in the 1940s and 1950s. The Library also holds a vast and rich collection of over 10,000 photographs by Justo A. MartÃ­, a Cuban photojournalist who worked for El Diario La Prensa. These photos document the Puerto Rican and Latino community in New York in the 1950s, 1960s, and 1970s. In addition, some of El Centroâs collections of personal papers contain photographs dating to the early part of the century. El Centro Library and Archives also holds photographs by contemporary photographers such as AdÃ¡l Maldonado, MÃ¡ximo ColÃ³n, Tony VÃ©lez, and Hiram Maristany.\n\nDigital images:\n\n350 items\n\nThis represents half of the entire collection of paintings, prints, and posters at El Centro. El Centro hopes to complete digitization by June 2004, when they will have 700 digital images.\n\nArt objects and artifacts available for research:\n\n165 items\n\nEl Centro has 8.5 linear feet of flat files, which include silk-screens produced for the DIVEDCO films by masters of the â50s Generationâ like Rafael TufiÃ±o and Lorenzo Homar. Other renowned Puerto Rican and Nuyorican artists in the collection include Julio Rosado del Valle, Nestor SambolÃ­n, Epifanio Irizarry, Antonio Martorell, Jorge Soto, Fernando Salicrup, Marcos Dimas, Gilberto HernÃ¡ndez, Elizam Escobar, Manuel Vega, Juan SÃ¡nchez, and Hiram Maristany. El Centroâs collection includes five paintings and twenty-five drawings. In 2003 El Centro started commissioning limited editions of prints by Puerto Rican artists to be sold. This initiative is a way to promote artists while fundraising for other art projects organized by El Centro. Miriam HernÃ¡ndez was the first artist to create a print for El Centro. Forthcoming in 2006 is a new edition by Miguel Luciano.\n\nFilms by or about Latinos:\n\nUndetermined\n\nEl Centro holds numerous films by Puerto Rican directors and producers which deal with aspects of Puerto Rican culture in the island and the mainland. These include Miguel PiÃ±ero Reading at magic Gallery (1964); Myrna Baez: Los Espejos de Silencio/Mirrors of Silence (1989); Nine Artists of Puerto Rico (1970); The Oxcart (1970), among many others. A complete list with descriptions is available on their website. El Centro also owns the films produced by the Division of Community Education (DIVEDCO) in Puerto Rico from the 1930s to the 1950s, in which visual artists collaborated with filmmakers to create films of educational value.\n\nHoldingsâSecondary Sources\n\nExhibition catalogues, books and periodicals related to Latino art:\n\nEleven linear feet\n\nEl Centro regularly receives AztlÃ¡n, a Chicano Studies journal that often includes articles on visual arts. El Centro has various art journals in microfilm published between 1923 and 1969 such as Artistas Hispanos, New York, 1948; Cine Variedades, New York, 1953â1954; La Voz del Artista, New York, 1960; and Artes y Letras, New York, 1933â1935 and 1936â1939.\n\nVertical file materials related to Latino art: artist files, brochures, pamphlets, clippings:\n\nSix linear feet\n\nEl Centro has a growing collection of vertical files of Puerto Rican and Latino artists, including: Manuel Acevedo, John Ahearn and Rigoberto Torres, Elia Alba,Â JosÃ© Alicea, CÃ¡ndida Alvarez, Myrna BÃ¡ez, DiÃ³genes Ballester, Tony Bechara, Charles Biasiny-Rivera, HÃ©ctor MÃ©ndez Caratini, Wilfredo Chiesa, Papo Colo, MÃ¡ximo ColÃ³n, MarÃ­a Cortijo, Marcos Dimas, Jack and Irene Delano, Perla De LeÃ³n, James de la Vega, MarÃ­a Dominguez, Elizam Escobar, Rafael Ferrer, Adrian GarcÃ­a, Anaida HernÃ¡ndez, Luis HernÃ¡ndez Cruz, Miriam HernÃ¡ndez, YasmÃ­n HernÃ¡ndez, Lorenzo Homar, Carlos Irizarry, Miguel Luciano, AdÃ¡l Maldonado, Antonio Martorell, MalaquÃ­as Montoya, Arnaldo Morales, JosÃ© Morales, Rafael ColÃ³n Morales, Wanda Ortiz, Rafael MontaÃ±ez Ortiz, PepÃ³n Osorio, Miguel Pou, Arnaldo Roche, GenoÂ RodrÃ­guez, Gloria RodrÃ­guez, Freddy RodrÃ­guez, Charlie Rosario, Ray Rosario, Julio Rosado del Valle, Fernando Salicrup, Juan SÃ¡nchez, Scherezade GarcÃ­a, Elaine Soto, Jorge Soto, Rigoberto Torres, Tanya Torres, Miguel Trelles, Nitza TufiÃ±o, Rafael TufiÃ±o, ,Julio Valdez, Jorge Vargas, Manuel Vega, Tony VÃ©lez, Pedro Villarini,and Â Joe Wippler (Ezo).\n\nHoldingsâFinding Aids\n\nEl Centro Library has twenty-five full finding aids for its collection of personal papers, along with a number of incomplete finding aids. El Centroâs finding aids are all bilingual. All books and exhibition catalogues in its collection can be found through the database of CUNY libraries (CUNY+). El Centro is preparing an inventory of the art in its flat files, which will be made available on its Web site. Additionally, El Centro will be cataloging these items, making them accessible through CUNY+. El Centro has a list of the films in their collection available online. El Centro Journal is reproduced on El Centroâs website.\n\nAccessibility\n\nThe Center for Puerto Rican Studies is an academic research center. Materials are catalogued and well preserved. Appointments are required to use archival materials, but the library is open to the general public without appointment.\n\nRestrictions\n\nEl Centro restricts access to selected records, some of which are confidential. El Centro is a non-circulating library. Please note that the Library and Archives are open to the general public and no academic ID is required. In the interests of better serving researchers with the limited staff available, the Archives are available by appointment only.\n\nGeneral Assessment\n\nAlthough El Centro Library and Archives is best known for its holdings in history, literature, sociology, and cultural anthropology, its holdings in Puerto Rican visual arts are of comparable strength. El Centro is one of the few research centers in New York where this material is catalogued, making it easier for the general public to find the materials they seek.\n\nThe Centro Library and Archives is committed to making its resources available to a wide audience. For this reason, El Centro allows the public to examine its holdings closely, even allowing researchers to handle works of art under staff supervision.\n\nRelations to other Latino and Latin American organizations\n\nEl Centro has had collaborative relationships with many of the major Puerto Rican and Latino organizations in New York City. For example, El Diario/la prensa, ASPIRA, the Puerto Rican Legal Defense and Education Fund, the Puerto Rico Federal Affairs Administration, Julia de Burgos Cultural Center, and El Museo del Barrio, among others.\n\nEl Centro had a close relationship with visual artists in New York when it was founded in 1973. This relationship has, however, become less prominent over the last two decades. Many of El Centroâs early publications contain reproductions of rarely seen works by Nuyorican artists such as Jorge Soto and Manuel Neco Otero. Artist NÃ©stor Otero has maintained a collaborative relationship with El Centro Journal. In 2003 El Centro began a program of monthly exhibitions, displaying works from their permanent collection as well as works by invited artists.\n\nClemente Soto VÃ©lez Cultural and Educational Center\n\n107 Suffolk Street\n\nNew York, NY 10002\n\nTel: (212) 260-4080\n\nhttp://csvcenter.org\n\nContact\n\nJan Hanvik, Executive Director\n\n[email protected]\n\nHours open to the public\n\nArt Gallery: Monday-Thursday, 4:00â10:00 p.m.\n\nHistory of the Institution\n\nNamed after the respected Puerto Rican poet, the Clemente Soto VÃ©lez Cultural and Educational Center was created to nurture and aid in the development of the Puerto Rican and Latino arts in the Lower East Side.\n\nThe Clemente was founded in 1993 by Edgardo Vega YunquÃ©, Nelson Landrieu, and Mateo GÃ³mez. At the time, Teatro La Tea, established by Landrieu and GÃ³mez, was the only functioning theater in the building that now houses the Clemente. Less than a year later, after much hard work and payment of an outstanding debt of over $30,000, the devoted trio acquired the lease to the city-owned building, on 107 Suffolk Street from Solidaridad Humana, a community-based education and human services organization.\n\nThe Clemente is located at 107 Suffolk Street, between Rivington and Delancey Streets; it is the foremost architectural landmark in that part of the Lower East Side still known as Loisaida. The Dutch Neo-Gothic building is a former public school (PS 160) constructed in 1898 by the Board of Education of the City of New York. By the mid-seventies the building had ceased to serve as a public school. From 1984 to 1990 it housed Solidaridad Humana, a revolutionary community-based education program that was comprehensive and bilingual.\n\nAs with most Latino arts centers and organizations throughout the country, the Clemente has struggled against many odds to keep its doors open. Lack of funding, benefactors, or patrons to support Latino arts programs present hardships. Nevertheless, the space is steadily being improved with the intention of making the Clemente a focus of Latino art and culture in New York City.\n\nCurrently the Clemente houses twelve resident companies and fifty-three individual artists, of which one-third are Latino / Hispanic.\n\nScope and Content\n\nThe archival records of the Clemente are mostly self-generated. They include the organizationâs operation records, which are comprised mainly of occupancy agreements and documents regarding the buildingâs operations and maintenance. The Clemente also holds one linear foot of artist files regarding its resident artists.Â\n\nThere is no formal archival policy in place. The Clemente keeps application materials sent by artists soliciting studio space. These materials include artistsâ letters of interest, press on solo or group exhibitions, and resumes. Promotional materials on exhibitions and cultural events held at the Clemente are mostly limited to emails and flyers.\n\nThe Clemente can mediate the access to the archival records of resident companies.\n\nOverall holdings of archives and research material: Thirty-five linear feet\n\nOverall holdings of archives and research material on Latino art: Thirty-two linear feet\n\nInclusive dates of files: 1984â2005\n\nBulk dates: 1993â2005\n\nLanguages in which records are written:\n\nEnglish\n\nHoldingsâPrimary Sources\n\nArchives of institutionâs history and operation related to Latino art:\n\nThirty-one linear feet\n\nThe Clemente keeps information such as occupancy agreements, donation information, bills, checks, brochures, and some artist file materials.\n\nArchives of manuscripts of other institutions related to Latino art:\n\nThe main office of the Clemente holds solely records on their operations. However, most of the resident companies in the Clemente building, including Teatro La TEA and SEA hold their own archival records. The contact information for the resident companies can be found on the Clemente website.\n\nDigital images:\n\nTwenty-two items\n\nThe organization has digital images documenting the work of many of its resident artists. These images will soon be made accessible through the Clementeâs website.\n\nExhibition catalogues published in-house that include work by Latino artists:\n\nThe Clemente has not published any catalogues, but flyers and postcards are printed for most of the exhibitions they organize.\n\nFilms by or about Latinos:\n\nThe Clemente does not actively collect films, although there are some in its archive. Some Latino film companies like Cine HuracÃ¡n and MoxieFilms, and independent filmmakers including Vlamyr Vizcaya, Luis Castro, and Isabel Bigalow hold studios at the Clemente. The organization can facilitate contact with these artists and companies in order for researchers to have access to their productions and archival materials.\n\nHoldingsâSecondary Sources\n\nVertical file materials related to Latino art: artist files, brochures, pamphlets, clippings:\n\nOne linear foot\n\nArtist files document the resident artists at the Clemente. They include materials on Sira Ayensa, Natalia Campos, Luis Castro, Anibal Cicardi, Silvio de la Cruz, Rafael Mendez, Freddie Molina, Miguel Trelles, and Rafael TufiÃ±o, among others. Files are created as an artist becomes a tenant of the Center and are updated as he or she builds a base exhibition portfolio.\n\nHoldingsâFinding Aids\n\nThere are no finding aids to the Clemente archives.\n\nAccessibility\n\nCurrently there is no space designated for researchers, but there is a conference table that can be made available when it is not being used by the staff.\n\nRestrictions\n\nArchival records are accessible by appointment only.\n\nGeneral Assessment\n\nFor more than a decade, the Clemente Soto VÃ©lez Cultural Center has served as an important incubator for the arts in the Lower East Side. It has provided workshop and exhibition space for numerous Puerto Rican and Latino artists, as well as to artists of other cultural backgrounds. The archival holdings that are of interest to researchers are currently limited. Nonetheless, the Clemente is starting to develop an archive in the hopes of documenting the artists who hold working space there.\n\nRelations to other Latino and Latin American organizations\n\nCurrently the Clemente houses twelve resident dance, theater, film, and performance companies. These include:\n\nLa Tea (Latin American Theater Experimental & Associates) Theater Company is the oldest resident theater at the Clemente. Founded in 1982, La Tea is committed to nurturing and promoting Latin American literature, music, and visual art.\n\nSEA Society of the Educational Arts, Inc./Sociedad Educativa de las Artes, Inc. was founded in 1985 in Puerto Rico, and has been operating in New York since 1993. SEA is a not-for-profit Hispanic/Bilingual Arts-in-Education Organization dedicated to the empowerment and educational advancement of children and young adults.\n\nFantastic Experimental Latino Theater (FELT) was founded in 1994, to strengthen and develop social and cultural awareness of Latinos in New York City. FELT addresses social and economic issues affecting the health and general well being of New York Cityâs Latino population.\n\nHOLA Hispanic Organization for Latin Actors is a Hispanic arts service organization committed to exploring and expanding available avenues for projecting Hispanic artists and their culture into the mainstream of the Anglo-American industry, culture, and society.\n\nMark DeGarmo Dancers/Dynamic Forms, Inc. was founded in New York City in 1982 by choreographer, dancer, arts educator, and artistic director Mark DeGarmo and incorporated as a not-for-profit organization in 1987.\n\nAfro Brazil Arts (ABA)/Capoeira Angola Palmares Academy, a non-profit organization founded in 1991, expands the circle of people who express themselves through art with capoeira instruction, performance, and the production and distribution of educational material.\n\nFÃ©raba is an African dance and percussion ensemble. The members of FÃ©raba originally came from Austria, Japan, the United States, and West Africa and brought their diverse cultural backgrounds with them to this growing eclectic company.\n\nArtists Alliance\n\nPier Studios\n\nArts for Arts\n\nLES Visual Arts Collective\n\nIn addition, the Clemente has served as a venue for the Latin American Dance Festival and exhibitions from Organization of Puerto Rican Artists (O.P. Art).\n\nCooper Hewitt National Design Museum\n\n2 East 91 Street\n\nNew York, NY 10028\n\nTel.

The Museum believes that design shapes our objects, making them more desirable, functional, and accessible. Celebrating the nature of design, the Museum explores designâs impact on the quality of our lives. The Cooper-Hewitt presents compelling perspectives on the impact of design on daily life through active educational programs, exhibitions, and publications.\n\nThe goals of the Cooper-Hewittâs historical and archival collections are to document the history of design, to encourage and assist scholarly research in design and related areas, and to increase public knowledge in these subject areas. The Cooper-Hewitt Archive, like the Smithsonian Libraries, supports the mission of the institution to increase and disseminate knowledge by building, organizing, managing, housing, preserving, and making readily available these special collections.\n\nThe Museum was founded in 1897 by Amy, Eleanor, and Sarah Hewittâgranddaughters of industrialist Peter Cooperâas part of The Cooper Union for the Advancement of Science and Art. A branch of the Smithsonian since 1967, the Cooper-Hewitt National Design Museum is housed in the Andrew Carnegie Mansion on Fifth Avenue in New York City.\n\nThe Museumâs Latino/Hispanic Archive was created in 1995 in response to the growing need for information about, and a fuller awareness of, the diversity of those working in American design. As the Smithsonianâs national repository of documentary and visual materials on Latino and Hispanic designers and their work, the Archive facilitates research in the fields of industrial and graphic design, architecture and interior design, urban planning, and the design of textiles, wallcoverings, floorcoverings, jewelry, furniture, glass, ceramics, and theatrical and movie sets.\n\nScope and Content\n\nThe Cooper-Hewittâs Library is a branch of the Smithsonian Institution Libraries and contains more than 70,000 volumes, including books, periodicals, catalogues, and trades literature dating from the fifteenth through the twenty-first centuries.\n\nVolumes cover American and European design and decorative arts, with concentrations in architecture, graphic design, interior design, ornamental patterns, furniture, wallcoverings, textiles, metalwork, glass, ceramics, and jewelry. The Libraryâs Archive contains photographs, correspondence, promotional material, drawings, writings, and related resource items for more than thirty American designers, including Henry Dreyfuss and Donald Deskey. Additionally, the library maintains research files on contemporary African American designers.\n\nWithin the Libraryâs Archive, the Latino-Hispanic Archive documents the work of contemporary designers of Latino and Hispanic descent, with a focus on those working in the United States and the Caribbean; South American and Central American designers are also represented. The designers and architects included demonstrate a level of expertise and achievement that warrants recognition by the academic and professional design communities. The archive consists of slides, photographs, exhibition catalogs, clippings, promotional materials, and periodicals. The work of designers and architects such as Miguel Baltierra, Benjamin Noriega-OrtÃ­z, and JosÃ© Rugueiro can be found the archive.\n\nOverall holdings of archives and research material: 70,000 volumes\n\nOverall holdings of archives and research material related to Latino art: Twelve linear feet\n\nInclusive dates of files: 1400âpresent\n\nBulk dates: (Latino/Hispanic Archive) 1980â1998\n\nLanguages in which records are written:\n\nEnglish, Spanish, Portuguese\n\nHoldingsâPrimary Sources\n\nArchives of institutionâs history and operation related to Latino art:\n\nOne linear foot\n\nThese files contain correspondence between Luis Badillo, organizer of the Latino/Hispanic Archive, and the artists, architects, and designers who sent their materials to be archived at the Cooper-Hewitt National Design Museum.\n\nNewsletters and magazines published in-house:\n\nThe archive contains copies of the Cooper-Hewitt Magazine that mention the Latino/Hispanic Archive. This magazine is published three to four times a year. The Latino/Hispanic Archive only has the issues published between 1996 and 1999.\n\nSlides and photographs:\n\n200 items\n\nSome of the artistsâ files contain slides (approximately 200 in total) and/or photographs of their works. Slides or photos of the work of architects Warren James, Miguel Baltierra, Rafael ViÃ±oly, Cesar Pelli, etc. can be found in the archive.\n\nArt objects and artifacts available for research:\n\nOne item\n\nThe archive holds an artist book by the graphic designer Carlos Segura from the design firm Segura Inc.\n\nHoldingsâSecondary Sources\n\nExhibition catalogues, books, and periodicals related to Latino art:\n\n2.25 linear feet\n\nCatalogues, books, and periodicals are loosely arranged and many are located within the artist files.\n\nThe Latino/Hispanic Archive has several sets of architecture and design journals published in Latin America. The CHM Latino/Hispanic Archive stopped receiving most of these periodicals around 1998. These include HeliografÃ­a, a quarterly newsletter of the Architecture School at the University of Puerto Rico. The Cooper-Hewitt has the issues of this quarterly newsletter that were published between 1993 and 1996.\n\nThe Latino/ Hispanic Archive has issues 6â11, published between 1997 and 1998, of Proyecto DiseÃ±o, a quarterly Colombian design magazine. The Latino/ Hispanic Archive also has issues 1â8, published between 1983 and 1990, of Brazilian architectural magazine Arquitetura Revista.\n\nMore Latino/Hispanic materials would likely be found at the American Art/Portrait Gallery Library (AAPG), or the National Museum of American History (NMAH), or at the Hirshhorn Museum Library, all located in Washington, DC. The Cooper-Hewittâs Library does not collect books related to Latino/Hispanic art and artists, as this objective would overlap with the collection policies of the branches of the Smithsonian Institution in DC. However, it is possible to arrange intra-library loans from these branches.\n\nVertical file materials related to Latino art: artist files, brochures, pamphlets, clippings:\n\nSeven linear feet\n\nThe artist files of the Latino/Hispanic Archive contain clippings, resumes, slides, photographs, brochures, and thin catalogues of artists and designers who work in lighting, furniture, graphics, interior design, architecture, and other decorative arts. Among the artists represented are the architects Miguel Baltierra, Warren James, Eugene Kopac, Cesar Pelli, Rafael ViÃ±oly. Graphic artists and designers Carlos Segura, NÃ©stor Otero, jewelry designer Pola Lubezki, and furniture designer JosÃ© Regueiro also have artist files.\n\nArtist files are not organized alphabetically.\n\nEach artist file has a tag that identifies the branch of design in which the artist works.\n\nHoldingsâFinding Aids\n\nThere is a list of the artists represented in the artist files of the Latino/Hispanic archive. Artist files are not organized alphabetically, but each artist file has a label identifying the branch of design in which the artist works.\n\nAccessibility\n\nThe Latino/Hispanic Archive is located within the Cooper-Hewitt Library, and therefore has the necessary infrastructure for servicing researchers.\n\nRestrictions\n\nNone.\n\nGeneral Assessment\n\nThe Latino/Hispanic Archive at the Cooper-Hewitt National Design Museum constitutes a unique resource for its emphasis on architecture, design, and decorative arts. Information on architecture, design, and decorative arts made by Latinos is hard to find even in specialized art libraries. The artist files contain research material on many Latino architects and designers working in New York and in Latin America. Since 1998 there has been no one in charge of adding new materials to the archive.\n\nRelations to other Latino and Latin American organizations\n\nThe Cooper-Hewitt National Design Museum is part of the Smithsonian Institution, which implemented policies for Latino Initiatives starting in 1993. The Smithsonian Center for Latino Initiatives opened its doors on August 10, 1998. The Centerâs vision was shaped by means of extensive dialog, conferences, and collaboration among educators, scholars, and community leaders, as well as museums, universities, and cultural and public institutions. Their website, which includes exhibitions, resources, and educational opportunities, can be visited at: http://latino.si.edu.\n\nDominican Studies Institute Library, City College, CUNY\n\nConvent Avenue & 138 Street, NAC 4/107\n\nNew York, NY 10031-9198\n\nTel.: (212) 650-7496\n\nFax:(212) 650-7489\n\nhttp://www.ccny.cuny.edu/dsi\n\nContact\n\nSarah Aponte, MLS, MSEd.

Founded to address the lack of reliable information on Dominicans for academic researchers and others, it is the first and only university-based research institution in the United States focusing on the study of Dominican life in the diaspora. The CUNY-DSI began as a pilot project in August of 1992, with a development grant made available by CUNYâs Chancellor. Upon official approval by the Board of Trustees in 1994, the CUNY-DSI became an integral component of the City University of New York.\n\nThe CUNY-DSI Library is a unique collection whose mission is to identify, collect, organize, preserve and make available bibliographical sources documenting the Dominican experience in the United States. As an organized research unit of the university, the institute sponsors research projects covering areas that include, but are not limited to, education, migration, language, literature, history, economics, womenâs issues, politics, youth, cultural identity, sports, performing arts, and visual arts.\n\nRegular donations combined with a budget allocation from the CUNY-DSIâs annual operating budget have enabled the library to grow systematically, becoming the largest specialized collection on U.S. Dominicans in the country.\n\nScope and Content\n\nThe archival holdings of CUNY-DSI Library pertain to Dominicans in the United States, the Dominican Republic, and elsewhere.

From the start, its founders recognized a lack of exposure for artists whose work challenged social, political, sexual, or aesthetic norms and raised difficult questions of race, ethnicity, gender and equality. In its first decade Exit Art presented a series of mid-career retrospectives with catalogues that helped to bring wide public attention to artists now firmly established, including Juan Sanchez and Cecilia VicuÃ±a.\n\nAfter moving in 1992, Exit Art identified the emergence of a generation of young artists with diverse backgrounds, perspectives, and aesthetics and expanded its curatorial model to become an incubator for the careers of these emerging artists. One important project was 1992âs Fever, named one of the ten most significant shows of the decade by Newsweekâs Peter Plagens in 2000.\n\nIn 2000, Exit Art felt the necessity to connect beyond the art world and inaugurated a series of thematic exhibitions exploring critical issues in contemporary society. The first exhibition in this series was Paradise Now: Picturing the Genetic Revolution (2000), which provoked widespread discussion about genetic research and bioengineering. Reactions (2002) presented over 2,500 responses to how 9/11 changed public and private behavior, and was acquired by the Library of Congress for its American Memory project.\n\nOne of Exit Artâs curatorial models since moving to Hellâs Kitchen in 2002 has been conceptplus, which began with an idea for an exhibition publicized through an international call to artists using the Internet. Exit Art has received hundreds of proposals from throughout the world, from which each exhibition is curated, broadening the group of artists into a global community and allowing for a more democratic curatorial process.\n\nExit Artâs mission is to create and present exhibitions and programs that explore the diversity of cultures and voices that continually shape contemporary art and ideas in America. Exit Art is also committed to bringing to public attention the work of under-recognized and emerging artists experimenting with the convergence of film, video, performance art, music, design, and visual art. Exit Artâs exhibitions, projects, and performances have expressed a unique creative vision that has frequently challenged traditional notions of what art is and offered new opportunities to bring together artists and the public. Over the past twenty years Exit Art has acquired a substantial international reputation for curatorial innovation, providing crucial support to artists at the beginning of their careers and anticipating the newest trends, movements, and ideas in the culture at large.\n\nScope and Content\n\nThe archives of Exit Art pertain mostly to the institutionâs operations. Primary and secondary sources include exhibition files, slides and digital images, catalogues, recordings of interviews and performances, artwork, and artist files. Included in these records is information on many Latino and Latin American artists. These records are also invaluable as sources documenting the history of one of the main alternative art spaces and centers of multiculturalism in New York and the United States.\n\nOther outstanding sources include the personal papers of visual artist and cultural producer Papo Colo, and the administrative papers of The Cultural Space and Trickster Theater, two organizations he founded. Exit Art also has a personal notebook of poems by the deceased Nuyorican poet Miguel PiÃ±ero.\n\nThere is no formal collection policy in place. Exit Art archives its operational records. Artist files are mostly created for those who have worked with or had exhibitions at Exit Art. There are approximately 1,000 artist files all together, though the institution has showcased over 2,300 artists. Approximately 200 of the 2,300 artists who have exhibited their work at Exit Art are Latinos. In 2004 the Institute of Museum and Library Services (IMLS) awarded Exit Art a grant for the organization and digitization of its archives.\n\nOverall holdings of archives and research material: Approximately 300 linear feet\n\nOverall holdings of archives and research material related to Latino art: Seventy-five linear feet\n\nInclusive dates of files: 1982âpresent\n\nBulk dates: 1982âpresent\n\nLanguages in which records are written:\n\nMostly in English, some correspondence in Spanish.\n\nHoldingsâPrimary Sources\n\nPersonal papers of artists, critics or art historians associated with Latino art:\n\nTwenty linear feet\n\nExit Art owns a folder with personal papers of the Nuyorican poet Miguel PiÃ±eiro (1947â1988). The papers include PiÃ±eroâs handwritten poetry and a notebook he wrote while imprisoned in Attica for second-degree armed robbery. These papers came to Exit Art as part of the papers of the Lower East Side artist Martin Wong, who collaborated with PiÃ±ero.\n\nThe personal papers of artist Papo Colo, co-founder and co-director of Exit Art are also housed at the institution.\n\nArchives of institutionâs history and operation related to Latino art:\n\nSeventy-five linear feet\n\nArchives include exhibition files, artistsâ files and administrative files. During its first ten years Exit Art organized mostly solo shows; a few of those were devoted to Latino and Latin American artists. In 1993 Exit Art began organizing group shows. Of the 165 exhibitions/events that have taken place at Exit Art, 82 have included Latino artists. This number is continuously growing, since virtually every exhibition since 1993 includes the work of Latino and Latin American artists. What follows is a list of selected individual and group exhibitions that have included Latino and Latin American artists since the inception of Exit Art:\n\nIllegal America (1982); Fantastic Landscape (1984); Pedro LujÃ¡n (1985); Surplus Show (1985); Ringside Gallery: CÃ¡ndida Alvarez (1985); Transculture/Transmedia (1986); Papo Colo: Will, Power, And Desire, 1976â1986 (1986); Immigrants & Refugees/Heroes or Villains (1987); Concrete Crisis (1987); Films With a Purpose: A Puerto Rican Experiment in Social Films (1987); RaÃºl Ruiz: Work for and about French TV (1987); 1988 International Forum of Super 8 (1988); Juan SÃ¡nchez: Rican Structured Convictions (1989); Cecilia VicuÃ±a: Precarious (1989); Internal Exile: New Films and Videos from Chile (1989); Jaime Davidovich: Forces/Farces (1991); Parallel History: The Hybrid State (1991); The Hybrid State FilmsÂ (1991); Speaking Tongues (1992); The Design Show: Exhibition Invitations in the U.S.A., 1940â1992 (1993); CÃ©sar Paternosto: Abstraction as Meaning: Painting and SculptureÂ (1993); Mapping Interior Spaces: Video at the Edge of the Millennium (1993); Poverty Pop: The Aesthetics of Necessity (1994); Endurance (1995); Counterculture: Alternative Information from the Underground Press to the Internet (1996); Sweat (1996); Terra-Bomba (1997); La TradiciÃ³n (1997); Hybrobar (1998); Hybro Video (1998); The End (2000); THE LP SHOW (2001); Exit Biennial: The Reconstruction (2003); L FactorÂ (2004); Praying Project (2005); Exit Biennial II: Traffic (2005); The Studio Show (2006); The Drop (2006); Wild Girls (2006).\n\nNewsletters and magazines published in-house:\n\nIn 1992 Exit Art conceived a newsletter entitled El Primer Mundo where artists would be invited to submit letters to fictional or historical characters.

Guillermo GÃ³mez-PeÃ±a contributed to this issue.\n\nIn 2002 Exit Art created the online newsletter Exit Culture Online. This publication is accessible at www.exitart.org. In November of 2005 Exit Art started Exit Times, a weekly newsletter distributed by email.\n\nArchives of manuscripts of other institutions related to Latino Art:\n\nEleven linear feet\n\nThese comprise five linear feet of records generated by Cultural Space, and six linear feet of records generated by the Trickster Theater.\n\nThe Cultural Space/The Laboratory was operational between 1990 and 1992. It was founded by artist Papo Colo in recognition that changing economic times demanded a new approach to servicing artistsâ needs. The Cultural Space was conceived as an artistsâ laboratory with minimum administrative staff and costs. It proposed to establish an arena in which a new understanding of American culture could be presented without the limiting labels of ethnicity, race, gender, or cultural background, presenting programs that dissolved boundaries but did not erase differences, creating bridges of understanding. The Cultural Space closed in 1992. Despite its short existence, The Cultural Space received enthusiastic notice in art journals and the press.\n\nThe Trickster Theater was begun as The First World Theater by Papo Colo in 1992. A founding principle was to enable people to work in theater who would otherwise not have the opportunity: students, visual artists from other media, and young people starting out in theater performance or technical craft. In its theatrical explorations, The First World Theater broke down barriers between media and created a theater intimately influenced by the visual arts. Clips of performances can be accessed at www.trickstertheater.org.\n\nRecorded interviews and performances:\n\nFifty-four items\n\nThe audiovisual archival holdings of Exit Art include several interviews with its co-founders. The organization has also numerous audiovisual materials that have been featured in its exhibitions, as well as recordings of performances organized in conjunction with exhibitions at Exit Art.

These items are recorded in MiniDV format.\n\nHoldingsâFinding Aids\n\nExit Art is currently working on a database of its archival holdings. The archives database will eventually be online and will include images. The institution is hoping to have a version available sometime in the fall of 2006, though without images. The complete database, with images, will most likely be available in 2007. In the meantime, they have compiled lists of their exhibition files, artist files, publications, and a catalog of their library that reference their holdings.\n\nAccessibility\n\nCurrently, there is no space designated for researchers, although Exit Art is happy to organize working space upon request for scholars wanting to consult its archives.\n\nRestrictions\n\nNone\n\nGeneral Assessment\n\nSince its inception, Exit Art has been an enclave of avant-garde international art in the United States. During its twenty-five-year history this institution has exhibited the work of numerous Latino and Latin American artists. The archival records of Exit Arts contain invaluable information on the organizationâs important role as a showcase for experimental international art, including work by Latino and Latin American artists. Finding aids and the systematic organization of records facilitate research in the archives.\n\nRelations to other Latino and Latin American organizations\n\nExit Art collaborated with El Museo del Barrio and The Museum of Modern Art in the organization of the program Films with a Purpose: A Puerto Rican Experiment in Social Films, held April 23âMay 3, 1987.\n\nFelix Gonzalez-Torres Foundation\n\nAndrea Rosen Gallery\n\n525 West Twenty-fourth Street\n\nNew York, NY 10011\n\nTel.

Since its establishment, the Foundation has been housed at Andrea Rosen Gallery. It may eventually have its own site.\n\nThe mission of the Foundation is to foster an appreciation for the work of Felix Gonzalez-Torres among the general public, scholars, and art historians. The Foundation provides guidance and assistance to those who are interested in including his work in exhibitions and helps people gain access to appropriate works for exhibition. In addition, the Foundation holds the copyright to all of the artistâs work and fills reproduction requests, for reviews, articles, and catalogues. It also issues non-exclusive license agreements outlining the terms of usage.\n\nScope and Content\n\nThe Foundation always obtains one copy of publications to which it lends an image.Â These publications are available for research. The Foundation has access and can facilitate access to the archival materials on Felix Gonzalez-Torresâs work that are housed at Andrea Rosen Gallery. These materials include slides and transparencies of all of his works and installation shots of nearly every exhibition in which his work was included, exhibition catalogues, magazine and newspaper articles, and reviews.\n\nOverall holdings of archives and research material: Thirty-six linear feet\n\nOverall holdings of archives and research material on Latino art: Twenty-eight linear feet\n\nInclusive dates of files: 1986âpresent\n\nBulk dates: 1986âpresent\n\nLanguages in which records are written:\n\nMost materials are in English.\n\nHoldingsâPrimary Sources\n\nArchives of institutionâs history and operation related to Latino art:\n\nOperational records such as correspondence with both curators and owners of the work regarding the organization of exhibitions and loans of work to exhibitions issued on behalf of collectors, who may wish to remain anonymous, are kept confidential. Anyone wishing to exhibit the work of Gonzalez-Torres or who has an interest in learning more about the nature of his work can obtain access to sample loan forms, however. The Foundation provides guidance in helping curators determine which pieces work best depending on their showâs context. Communications with museums often include instructions for the fabrication, installation, maintenance, and de-installation of those works by the artist that can be refabricated. The Foundation knows who owns individual artworks, and who is likely to loan.\n\nSlides and photographs:\n\n2,400 slides; 400 photographs; 900 transparencies\n\nThe Andrea Rosen Gallery owns and houses all slides, transparencies and photographs. Every single artwork is documented with high-quality photography. Since many of the artworks can be refabricated for exhibition, each of these manifestations are documented as well. Wherever possible, the work is photographed in the context of other work in the show in order to provide a more complete understanding of the installation. High-quality images and high-resolution scans are available for reproduction.\n\nDigital images:\n\n2,500 items\n\nThe Foundation scanned all transparencies housed at Andrea Rosen Gallery in 2010 in order to provide them when requested for research and publication. The slide collection has not been scanned as of 2011.\n\nHoldingsâSecondary Sources\n\nExhibition catalogues, books, and periodicals related to Latino art:\n\nSeventy-five linear feet\n\nThese include a library of books, catalogues, and periodicals that have addressed or featured the work of Gonzalez-Torres.

Catalogs are filed by the name of the institution, and magazine articles are filed by name of publication. Newspaper clippings are arranged chronologically. Images are organized by the inventory number that the gallery assigns. A catalog raisonnÃ© was published in 1997 by the Sprengel Museum in Hanover, Germany, providing a useful tool that is accessible at the Foundation for research.\n\nAccessibility\n\nThere is no designated area for researchers at this time, but there may be in the future.\n\nRestrictions\n\nCorrespondence between the Foundation, museums, and owners of Gonzalez-Torresâs work is confidential. The archive is only accessible by appointment.\n\nGeneral Assessment\n\nThe Felix Gonzalez-Torres Foundation can facilitate access to the archival records on the artist owned by Andrea Rosen Gallery.
