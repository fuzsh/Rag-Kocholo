It was formed in Mexico in 1937 as a workshop within the Liga de Escritores y Artistas Revolucionarios (League of Revolutionary Writers and Artists, LEAR), a group of artists and intellectuals active during Lázaro Cárdenas’s government who identified with progressivist causes and the left-wing ideals of the time.\n\nThe founding members of the workshop were Leopoldo Méndez, Raúl Anguiano, Luis Arenal, and Pablo O’Higgins, who were joined shortly afterward by Ángel Bracho and Alfredo Zalce. The TGP’s first statutes, published in 1938, state that its objective was to foment graphic production “in the benefit of the interests of the people of Mexico” through a system of collective work. By then, the TGP had separated from the LEAR, which was starting to disintegrate.\n\nMembers of the workshop customarily met on Friday afternoons to discuss current issues, decide which organizations in the workers’ movement needed support, and democratically determine whether and how the TGP could assist them. Every project was carried out collectively, with several members collaborating to produce, assess, and optimize each graphic work. Often, one member would do the design, another would correct it or transfer it to stone, linoleum, or wood in accordance with the group’s agreed decisions, and a third would take charge of printing it. Finally, the work would be signed with the initials “TGP.”\n\nOne of the TGP’s guiding principles was that production could go ahead “so long as it does not tend . . . to favor reaction or fascism.”1 Another was not to accept financial support from the state, which allowed the group to preserve its independence. To cover the workshop’s expenses, each member paid a membership fee.\n\nFrom the foundation of the TGP to the present day, thousands of prints have been created by more than one hundred artists. As a collective body, these works constitute a unique testimony to the history of Mexico, reflect everyday life in both the city and the country, form an encyclopedia of events, and illustrate the struggle of laborers for better working conditions. They also reflect their creators’ convictions, their love of life, and their profound desire to live in peace. Today, many of the group’s ideals seem to belong to the past, although the yearning for fairer living conditions remains constant. [. . .]\n\n1. The Foundation of the Taller Editorial de Gráfica Popular and the Artistic Collectives That Preceded It [. . .]\n\nThe idea of strengthening individual creativity through collective work emerged within the Mexican muralist movement, which sought to carry out monumental projects that were too demanding for a single individual. Murals were painted in public buildings, markets, and schools to steer social conscience in the direction desired by the person or institution that had commissioned them. Originally, these murals were painted by several artists. One of the principal objectives of art in Mexico in the first half of the twentieth century was to instruct the population through propaganda and win its enthusiasm for the numerous reforms of the postrevolutionary governments. Artists soon realized the great advantages of graphic art over muralism. It was cheaper and more up-to-date, and large print runs offered the chance to reach a larger public. Moreover, it was independent of government commissions and so less corruptible.\n\nFrom the beginnings of the muralist movement, artists and intellectuals gathered in workshops and unions like the Sindicato de Obreros Técnicos, Pintores y Escultores (Union of Technical Workers, Painters, and Sculptors), which from 1923 to 1926 represented the interests of artists working to engage Mexico’s cultural scene in progressive projects. In particular, David Alfaro Siqueiros, a painter whose work was avant-garde in form and content, declared himself in favor of organizing the artists who took part in the painting of murals. Under his direction, the Bloc of Mural Painters was formed in Los Angeles in 1932, and the Siqueiros Experimental Workshop opened in New York in 1934. In these two groups, both ephemeral, Siqueiros promoted the use of innovative techniques and the rejection of traditional ones.\n\nCollective work is the organic form corresponding to monumental painting and to subversive art. It is the only way the mechanics of plastic art can be applied. It alone is capable of giving the proletariat the ample agitation and propaganda material it needs for its daily struggle.2\n\nSiqueiros held to this position all his life and never ceased to insist that engravers should not lapse into stagnancy in their use of traditional techniques. In Mexico, he took part in the founding of the LEAR in 1934, and the following year the organization incorporated a workshop-school of revolutionary and collective mural painting and graphics. However, the LEAR initially supported the production of murals and cultural missions in which artists were sent by the government to country villages to support literacy campaigns and help to solve their principal problems. The support of the engravers became increasingly important in this work. The workshop-school of the LEAR was in charge of illustrating textbooks and pamphlets. At the same time, it furthered the antifascist struggle when, after the initial successes of the Mexican Revolution, the forces of the conservative far right began a counterrevolution that threatened to erase the achievements of the first. The disputes and struggles that followed were intense, and the artists took part by creating pamphlets to support the union of artists and writers with the workers against capitalist exploitation and fascist terror.\n\nArts promised workers free painting, drawing, engraving, stage design, sculpture, and art history lessons based on Marxist principles. Printed in vigorous black and red, the poster shows four men—whose headgear identifies them as workers— enthusiastically walking to the LEAR’s school along a route denoted by various signposts. The school’s teachers included Ignacio Aguirre, Arenal, Bracho, Méndez, O’Higgins, and Antonio Pujol, all future members of the LEAR’s direct successor, the Taller Editorial de Gráfica Popular (People’s Graphics Publishing Workshop, TEGP; the initial name of the TGP).\n\nAt thirty-three, Méndez was the most experienced artist in this group. After studying at the Academia de San Carlos, he produced illustrations for the magazine Horizonte (Horizon), published by the stridentists in Xalapa, and after the founding of the TEGP he devoted himself exclusively to engraving. Inspired by the work of the renowned engraver José Guadalupe Posada, Méndez’s goal was to turn the art of engraving into an instrument of popular propaganda. At the LEAR’s workshop-school, he was the director of the engraving section.\n\nAguirre was the oldest member of the group and the only one to have taken part in the revolution as a soldier in Venustiano Carranza’s army. He had been a miner and discovered an artistic calling through the theater group Ulises. Later he studied artistic pedagogy and worked as an art teacher at cultural missions in various villages. Aguirre may have taught stage design at the workshop-school.\n\nPujol was, at age twenty-one, the youngest member of the group. A shepherd, he had worked on the murals of the Mercado Abelardo L. Rodríguez (a market in Mexico City named after the former Mexican president) and been a delegate of the LEAR at the Congress of American Writers in New York, where he joined the Siqueiros Experimental Workshop. He probably taught mural painting at the workshop-school.\n\n[.\n\n. .] Julio\n\nPrieto’s October 1935 posterinvitation to the LEAR’s Workshop-School of Plastic\n\nArenal was slightly older than Pujol and had recently been appointed general secretary of the LEAR. He met Siqueiros after training as a temporary worker in Los Angeles. Arenal shared with Pujol an enthusiasm for the so-called insurrectionists and for the muralist’s impassioned discourse, and they would assist as collaborators on Siqueiros’s future murals and political actions.\n\nBracho, just twenty-four, was also a temporary worker. He was introduced to art at the evening courses of the Academia de San Carlos, where he joined the group of muralists who painted the Mercado Abelardo L. Rodríguez. Bracho also took part in the government’s cultural missions.\n\nOriginally from the United States, O’Higgins was thirty-one when he became one of the founders of the LEAR. As a child, his parents had encouraged his artistic vocation with piano lessons and academic courses. At the age of twenty he arrived in Mexico, where he joined Diego Rivera’s team of assistants and was active in the cultural missions. He formed part of the group working on the mural decoration of the Mercado Abelardo L. Rodríguez and subsequently was a member (together with Méndez, Zalce, and Fernando Gamboa) of the group that painted the murals of the Talleres Gráficos de la Nación (Graphic Workshops of the Nation). Afterward he collaborated in the production of artworks for the Centro Escolar Revolución (Revolutionary Educational Center), an enterprise notable for its collective nature. None of the works made there were individually signed. The intention was to oppose the collective to the individual, and works were thus signed with the group’s initials, “LEAR.” In 1936 and 1937, the LEAR organized several exhibitions. Those dedicated to painting and sculpture were not well reviewed, but the exhibitions of engravings were a success.\n\nWhile working together, Méndez and O’Higgins started a great friendship. Because of their physical appearance, one with black hair and the other blond, they were dubbed “Café con Leche” (Coffee with Milk). Their enthusiasm was such that they eventually set up a graphic workshop of their own because they wanted a press that would be available to artists practically day and night. With the LEAR having lost some of its impetus as members dispersed across Mexico to organize events, cultural missions, and exhibitions, Méndez and O’Higgins decided to concentrate fully on engraving and thus encourage its development as a tool for propaganda work.\n\nThe LEAR played an active part in political events both nationally and internationally. It ratified its friendship with the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and organized trips to Moscow. During the Spanish Civil War, many members of the\n\nLEAR traveled to Spain to fight in solidarity with the Republicans against the forces of fascism. In 1937, several members of the LEAR went to Valencia to attend the Second International Congress of Writers for the Defense of Culture, an occasion Méndez took advantage of to gather the engravers who had remained in Mexico to build a new project. He asked artists interested in collaborating to contribute fifteen pesos toward basic materials. Méndez and the artists he recruited had no intention of following in the tracks of the LEAR or of concocting grand schemes; rather, they planned to work independently, without government support, and to place their creative work at the service of the public, concentrating particularly on the medium of engraving.\n\nInitially, Méndez described the idea as a way of concentrating talent and protecting artists after the fall of the LEAR:\n\nThe LEAR died of the worst disease: opportunism. A lot of people joined it because it was a way to get a job or two. But some of us were unwilling to attend the funeral of the LEAR. . . .\n\nI thought it was very serious that the group should disband and that all those youngsters should more or less be doing any odd jobs they could find, and I proposed to them that we should gather around a workshop, even if a small one, but where we would have our tools and do some work. 3\n\nThe TEGP was founded in the summer of 1937 without a great deal of fuss. The engravers simply began to meet and work. During the transitional phase, which lasted until the TEGP approved its statutes, set up its facilities, and finally mounted its own press, the first members continued to work on the premises of the LEAR at number 5, Calle Allende, near the recently built and inaugurated Palacio de Bellas Artes (Palace of Fine Arts) in the historic center of the city. There the workshop’s first commission was completed: a calendar for the year 1938 requested by the Universidad Obrera de México (Workers’ University of Mexico). In addition to work by Méndez, the calendar included lithographic prints by Arenal, Jesús Bracho, and O’Higgins. The themes of the twelve plates of the calendar were centered on the revolutionary movement in Mexico, independence, the great workers’ movements, the nationalization of the railroads, and the omnipresent threat of fascism. All the works were lithographs in two inks. As they did not have a press of their own, the artists went to the workshop of Jesús Arteaga, a former printer and collaborator with Posada, who placed his machines at the disposal of the group:\n\nHe generously gave us the largest room, where there was a machine that engraved clouds and arabesques for what was called “security” paper. There, among other things, we worked on the originals of a calendar for the Workers’ University, and a folder hailing the constitution for the Mexican Federation of Workers. Señor Arteaga’s studio had a tradition. . . . That room would merit a detailed description, with its dusty curtains of faded red satin that seemed to have been motionless for centuries. That studio, with its two good hand presses and piles of cardboard sheets between which he would carefully place the lithographic prints, gives an idea of what a craftsman was in the good days of the graphic arts in Mexico.4\n\nToday, individual leaves of the calendar are hard to find. They were used at the time and most likely were thrown away at the end of each month. However, at least one full calendar for 1938 survived and was included (along with the 1939 calendar) in the exhibition Estampa y lucha (Print and Struggle), held to celebrate the eightieth anniversary of the TGP. The 1938 calendar is signed with the acronyms “TEGP” and “LEAR,” which indicates that it was created during the transitional period when the artists were still members of the LEAR but the project to found the TGP was already underway.\n\nA pamphlet mentioned by Méndez in an interview with Elena Poniatowska is identifiable as the leaflet ¡Viva la unidad del proletariado en provecho de la cultura del Pueblo! El Taller de Gráfica Popular saluda a todos los delegados al Primer Congreso de la Confederación de Trabajadores de México [. . .] (Long live the unity of the proletariat for the benefit of the culture of the People! The People’s Graphics Workshop salutes all the delegates at the First Congress of the Mexican Federation of Workers [. . .], p. 175). At this congress, held in February 1938, the TGP offered its services to the gathered trade union representatives, specifying that it could provide “posters, popular pamphlets, monographs, graphic histories of the struggles of the workers’ organizations, illustrations of the active life of the unions, illustrations for leaflets, dust jackets, etc., etc.” Méndez’s lithograph, printed on a sheet folded into a triptych, shows a worker distributing leaflets in the center; on the left, a man points at a poster and comments on it to a woman next to him; on the right, two men read another poster. The image eloquently illustrates how and to what ends the prints and engravings of the TGP could be used.\n\nOne month later, in March 1938, the members of the TGP approved the first version of their statutes:\n\nThis Workshop is founded with the purpose of stimulating graphic production in the benefit of the interests of the people of Mexico, and to this end it is proposed to gather the largest possible number of artists around a constant endeavor, principally through the method of collective production.\n\nEvery production of the members of the Workshop, whether individual or collective, will be permissible so long as it does not tend in any way to favor reaction or fascism. 5\n\nXavier Guerrero designed the first emblem of the TGP, which symbolizes collective work: a hand raising a flagpole with five pennants pointing in two directions, all framed by the name of the group. In the background are the figures of the sun and the moon above and the earth below. This emblem was used for nearly ten years. At first, the TGP was called the Taller Editorial de Gráfica Popular (People’s Graphics Publishing Workshop), indicating that the group intended to commercialize the work it produced.\n\nIn July 1939, the members of the workshop finally moved into their own premises on Calle Belisario Domínguez and secured their own lithographic press. It was the start of a special period for the workshop. “In three small rooms off the courtyard,” twelve artists ran what American art collector and writer MacKinley Helm described as “a tight shop where today, taken as a whole, the most wonderful prints to be found in the entire Western Hemisphere are produced.”6\n\n2. The Members of the Collective\n\nIn the course of the eighty-year history of the TGP, many members and guest artists from Mexico and other countries contributed to the collective’s success. The exhibition [ Estampa y lucha] held at the Museo Nacional de la Estampa (National Museum of Graphic Arts) included the most comprehensive collection heretofore assembled (based on available information) of names, portraits, and biographical data of TGP members and guest artists.7 The goal was to show that a collective is made not only of stars and leaders but of all the people who have collaborated with or been a fundamental part of it.\n\nIn the early years, working collectively meant that every Friday night the members of the TGP would meet to debate matters of current interest. At these sessions, for example, members discussed which workers’ organizations needed support, whether the TGP was prepared to collaborate with them, and how. Every proposal was worked on jointly. Several members would collaborate to produce, critique, and optimize the design of each work. Often, one member would do the sketch, while another would correct it and transfer it to stone, linoleum, or wood, following the group consensus. Afterward, a third member would take charge of the printing. Finally, the work was signed collectively with the initials “TGP.” Minutes of the weekly sessions summed up the key points discussed. Everything was well organized.\n\nWhat factors coincided to guarantee the TGP’s success for so long? Frequently only external circumstances are mentioned; namely, the political development of Mexico, the popular front against fascism, the government of President Cárdenas, the workers’ movement and its strengthened trade unions, and the arrival of large numbers of refugees and their organizations-in-exile. All of these factors influenced the TGP and offered it a broad field of action. Nevertheless, another crucial factor was the diversity of the group’s members and organization. For collaboration to function smoothly, the TGP had to have reliable statutes.\n\nThe Standards of the TGP\n\nThe first statutes of the TGP were signed on March 17, 1938, and were relatively brief. Later modifications specifically addressed collaboration. [. . .]\n\nThe declarations of principles reflect changes in the workshop’s function. The first declaration states that the group’s graphic production should benefit the interests of the Mexican people and in no way support fascists or reactionaries. By 1940, this imprecise formulation was seen as a limitation, however, and a new declaration was approved that focused on artistic work and sought to organize the collective by means of statutes [. . .].\n\nThe third declaration of principles, written in 1945 and published four years later in a book edited by Hannes Meyer on the occasion of the TGP’s twelfth anniversary, was in force for longer than the first two.8 Regarded as the quintessential statement of the TGP, it reads,\n\nThe TGP is a center of collective work for the functional production and study of the different branches of engraving and painting.\n\nThe TGP continually endeavors for its works to benefit the progressive and democratic interests of the Mexican people, especially in their fight against fascist reaction.9\n\nThe third declaration remained in force until 1956, when it was replaced by a declaration that redefined the TGP’s function:\n\nThe Taller de Gráfica Popular is a center of collective work for the functional promotion and study of the different branches of engraving and painting and the different reproductive media . . . The Taller de Gráfica Popular will work continually to ensure its production helps the Mexican people defend and enrich the national culture, which cannot be achieved without the independent existence of Mexico in a peaceful world.10\n\nIn this fourth declaration, the workshop’s function was thus reoriented from the fight against fascism to a defense of the national culture and participation in the peace movement.\n\nAs the TGP’s declarations changed, so, too, did the rules on internal discipline and on the rights and obligations of members. The rules became increasingly strict and eventually included a full range of expulsion procedures.\n\nThe Members\n\nOne important factor in the fruitful collaboration among members of the TGP was their diversity.\n\nLeopoldo Méndez\n\nViva la unidad del proletariado [Long live the unity of the proletariat], 1938\n\nLeopoldo Méndez\n\nIncidentes melódicos del mundo irracional [Melodic incidents of the irrational world], 1944\n\nTheirs was a multifaceted group respectful of the most diverse characters and origins and based not on dogmatism but tolerance. Discussions about the quality of the group’s work were ongoing, but the workshop’s objective—to benefit the interests of the Mexican people—was never in doubt. Nevertheless, opinions differed about how to achieve this objective. A small fraction of TGP members always identified with the [Mexican] Communist Party, which tended to consider its point of view as the only valid one. A larger fraction was less radical and took part in trade union movements or identified with the Partido Popular (People’s Party) founded and led by Vicente Lombardo Toledano. From the various ideological tendencies, interesting work emerged. In later years, however, as the collective became more ideologically uniform, the quality of the work diminished.\n\nFrom 1940, the collective distinguished regular members from temporary members and guest artists. When the TGP became famous in the United States and around the world, many artists arrived from abroad (and from other regions of Mexico) to learn the group’s model. The artists would spend a month in Mexico City taking part in classes taught by members of the TGP. Class fees brought in considerable income for the workshop. Many of the guest artists then stayed on to work with the collective for several months. They were given the right to vote in the general assemblies and to use the TGP’s machines and tools for their own work. They were required to attend meetings and adhere to the principles of the workshop. Regular members were also obliged to take part in collective projects and donate two copies of each individual work to the TGP archives.\n\nThe collective system of work was a successful model and, over the years, had more than one hundred members. In addition to its members (who are mentioned in the exhibition Estampa y lucha), the minutes of the TGP’s assemblies record the names of many guest artists and others whose biographies have proved impossible to ascertain. That is, not all are as well-known as the great muralists Siqueiros and Rivera, who thought highly of the quality of the work of the TGP’s printer, José Sánchez, and often sent print jobs to the workshop.\n\nMéndez, the most experienced engraver, was always a recognized leader of the group he had founded. His style, his vigorous engraving technique, and his absolute command of composition long marked the artistic direction of the group. He was also influential on a personal level, although he would always accept the majority opinion in debates. Never an authoritarian, Méndez kept up friendly relations with all the members, and for many years he upheld the group’s interests on the committee that determined its artistic orientation. His authority was the product of his work and infinite creativity. He was the most frequent participant in the workshop’s collective engravings. Politically, he identified not with the radical communist sector but with the group linked to Lombardo Toledano’s Partido Popular.\n\nMéndez’s production was surpassed in number only by Alberto Beltrán, who joined the group in 1944 after qualifying as a tailor. (Both men would leave the TGP in 1960.) Beginning in 1948, Beltrán assumed various functions for the TGP. In 1958, he traveled as the group’s president to the Stockholm Peace Conference. Beltrán was incredibly productive and devoted himself wholeheartedly to newspaper illustrations, trade union propaganda, and pamphlets for literacy campaigns and for the Instituto Nacional Indigenista (National Indigenist Institute). For many years he acted as editor-in-chief of the cultural supplement of the newspaper El día (The day). His light, fluid drafting style makes his work unmistakable. Like Méndez, Beltrán took an active part in the administrative tasks of the TGP committee.\n\nThe longest-lasting member of the TGP was Bracho, who remained with the workshop from its founding in 1937 until his death in 2005. His large number of works denotes a tireless enthusiasm. He was president of the TGP from 1952 to 1953 and again from 1961 to 1963 after the departure of the group that had formed around Méndez. The TGP was his life. Bracho participated prolifically in its collective works, and the number of works he produced at the TGP is the third highest after Beltrán and Méndez.\n\nO’Higgins had been Méndez’s closest friend since the days of the LEAR. As a founding member of the TGP, he maintained close connections with the group until he left with Méndez in 1960. In 1944, he served for a year as TGP secretary general. However, rather than devoting himself to engraving like Méndez, he continued to work as a painter and muralist. He won many commissions in his native land and took advantage of his trips north to establish links between the North American trade union movement and the TGP. Many of the TGP’s exhibitions in the United States and many of its commissioned works were the result of O’Higgins’s initiatives. With their picturesque style, the prints and lithographic posters he produced at the workshop are masterpieces of graphic art.\n\nAdolfo Mexiac joined the TGP at the age of twenty-three and was a member until 1959, when he withdrew from the circle shortly before the departure of Méndez. He was enormously productive, creating many works for the trade union newspaper CeTeMe and for textbooks published in indigenous languages. When he was not in Chiapas, where he worked for the Instituto Nacional Indigenista, he would work in support of the committee of the TGP. [. . .]\n\nFrancisco Mora was even younger than Mexiac when he joined the TGP at the age of nineteen. With his work he supported the magazines of the schoolteachers and their union, as well as the [Mexican] Communist Party. From 1947, Mora was married to the American artist Elizabeth Catlett, who was a guest artist of the TGP along with her ex-husband Charles White. Mora and Catlett were members of the collective until 1965. During the years they remained with the workshop, Mora and Catlett attempted to give it a new orientation, and Catlett served as general secretary.\n\nThe list of most-productive TGP artists would not be complete without Aguirre, who was active in the LEAR until joining the TGP at its founding. Like Mora and Catlett, Aguirre was a member of the [Mexican] Communist Party and remained in the TGP until 1965. He was one of the most experienced artists to join, and he soon had solo exhibitions and started to travel frequently. In the 1950s, he was active in the Frente Nacional de Artes Plásticos (National Front of Plastic Arts, FNAP), which sent him to Eastern Europe and China to present that organization’s great traveling exhibitions.\n\nMany of the TGP’s guest artists either were or would become famous in their countries of origin. As participants in the meetings of the workshop, where they had full rights to express their opinions, they provided a significant impulse for the group’s activities. After their stay in Mexico, they returned home with new ideas, and many of them organized exhibitions of the TGP in their home countries, thus helping to spread its concept. Each of the following artists worked at the TGP: Jean Charlot, from France, who later lived in Hawaii; Jim Egleson, from Canada; Juan Antonio Franco, from Guatemala; Galo Galecio, from Ecuador; Luis García Robledo and Julio Girona, from Cuba; Moshe Gat, from Israel; Miguel Marshall Goodman, Gloria Heller, Jules Heller, Max Kahn, Seymour Kaplan, Misch Kohn, Robert Mallary, Rini Templeton, Margaret Burroughs, Frank Vavruska, White, and John Woodrow Wilson, all from the United States; Josep Renau, from Spain; Koloman Sokol, from Czechoslovakia; and Albe Steiner, from Italy. All of them worked temporarily at the TGP, made their engravings, and left two copies of each piece with the workshop’s archives.\n\n3. The Liga Pro Cultura Alemana and the Exiles’ Organizations\n\nThe success of the TGP was due not just to its statutes and the collective work of its members but also because of its administrative organization. Largely, this was left in the hands of the guest artists.\n\nDuring the years of the Spanish Civil War (1936–1939), Mexico received many sympathizers of the Second Spanish Republic who were fleeing the advance of troops led by Francisco Franco. After the rise of the National Socialist Party in Germany, many refugees from that European country also fled to Mexico. The Liga Pro Cultura Alemana (League for German Culture, LPCA), the first organization of exiled Germans to be established in Mexico, was founded by Heinrich Gutman, who had held administrative positions in the LEAR, including that of editor of the magazine Frente a Frente. 11 In Berlin, Gutman had edited a sensationalist newspaper, and he was one of the first to emigrate in 1933 after Nazi sympathizers began burning books. In Mexico, Gutman met Méndez and the group of engravers at the LEAR and witnessed the early development of the TGP. The LPCA was formed in Mexico in the spring of 1938. From the autumn of 1938 through the spring of 1939, the Liga organized several talks on Nazism and fascism with the goal of informing the Mexican public about the crimes being committed by the Nazi regime. This task was by no means an easy one, as the German embassy at that time fully supported Adolf Hitler’s policies, as did many among the colony of German traders and adventurers who had long been established in Mexico. At first, the circle of exiles was small. The LPCA had only twenty members, and fewer than half a dozen of the German colony in Mexico joined the valiant anti-Nazi group. Nevertheless, with the support of the Secretaría de Educación Pública (Secretary of Public Education), the group organized a series of talks by Mexican scientists and intellectuals on German culture. These were held at the Palacio de Bellas Artes and broadcast nationwide by Mexican radio stations. The German embassy criticized the initiative and accused it of Marxism, leading to tensions in diplomatic relations.\n\nNonetheless, the LPCA soon organized a second series of talks, also with the support of the Mexican government. These talks included direct political criticism of the Nazi regime. The members of the TGP designed the posters for these events, which not only appeared in the streets but were even distributed in schools by the Secretaría de Educación Pública. With thick blocks of text framing spaces for images, the posters and the typographic fonts used in their design recall the graphic features often seen in Frente a Frente, the magazine Gamboa directed for the LEAR.\n\nThe first talk in the series was organized on short notice, and a poster could not be produced in time.12 For the second talk, “La tragedia del campo” (The tragedy of the countryside), given at the Palacio de Bellas Artes on September 21, 1938, Aguirre produced a poster showing the arm of a man, identified as a Nazi by a swastika armband, greedily appropriating a sheaf of corn. The other side of the image showed two emaciated hands barely managing to hold a broken stalk of wheat.\n\nBalas en vez de pan (Bullets instead of bread), a lithographic illustration by Egleson, was produced for the promotional poster for the third talk, entitled “Totalitarian Economy.” The illustration shows a crowd of hungry people reaching toward a loaf of bread that is held in front of them on a bayonet. Instead of sustenance, the starving people receive only munitions, thrown at them by a huge hand. The poster for the fourth lecture, “Juventud perdida” (Lost youth, p. 219 top), was produced by two artists invited to take part in this collective work, Mallary and José Luis Franco.13 Their astutely rendered depiction of a humanized machine includes a small robot emerging over the silhouette of a man’s head. With guns on its head and bayonets for hands, the robot is warlike in appearance. The futuristic image seems to be inspired by Fritz Lang’s 1927 film Metropolis and ingeniously criticizes toys that allude to war and subject children to militarism.\n\nThe lithograph made by Méndez for the fifth lecture, dedicated to Nazi espionage and propaganda, illustrates the threat of the German propaganda machine in Mexico. A figure whose head is a loudspeaker enfolds the map of Mexico in its arms while holding a bomb in one hand. Through an effect of perspective and modified proportions, the machine with a human body has an extremely menacing appearance.\n\nFor the sixth talk (p. 210 center), Jesús Escobedo criticized the Nazis’ ambivalent stance toward the Catholic Church by using the symbols of the cross and swastika. The poster shows a figure in a Nazi armband destroying a cross with its claws, a representation of the subjugation of the church to the Nazi order.\n\nFor the poster announcing the talk entitled “El hombre en la sociedad nazi” (Man in Nazi society), O’Higgins showed a man tied to a swastika, an image that recalled a powerful photomontage by the German artist John Heartfield.\n\nZalce’s illustration for the poster of the eighth lecture, “La mujer en la sociedad nazi” (Woman in Nazi society), shows a woman lying with a baby in her arms as she gazes in terror at the horrifying phalanx of child soldiers, guns with bayonets on their shoulders and gas masks on their faces. Women, the poster suggests, are treated by the Nazis as mere machines for producing troops.\n\nBy this point, the German embassy in Mexico had already vigorously protested the series of talks, claiming that Mexican civil servants were committing an offense against the German state. This prompted General Heriberto Jara to cancel his lecture, “Alemania bajo bayonetas” (Germany under the bayonets), scheduled for October 28, 1938, out of consideration for the German authorities. The TGP had designed two posters for this talk, one by Francisco Dosamantes and the other by Bracho. Both were great designs. Dosamantes showed the stylized image of a code of justice destroyed by bayonets, a clear representation conveying a precise message. Bracho’s design featured the highly symbolic image of a man in a steel helmet and boots marked with Nazi insignia crushing a group of people while striding toward a ravine and his downfall.\n\nIn addition to Jara’s cancelled lecture, a second talk was also scheduled for October 28, titled “Razas de primera y de segunda clase” (First- and second-class races, p. 210 bottom). The poster commissioned for this lecture is less expressive than the two by Dosamantes and Bracho, and to this day the artist responsible for it has not been identified. It shows a soldier—identified as a Nazi by his uniform and salute—astride a map of Mexico drawn on a globe. The lithograph appears to have been hastily executed.\n\nHaving secured the participation of another speaker, the lecture on “Germany under the Bayonets” was rescheduled as the ninth lecture in the series. The image for the poster was the work of Everardo Ramírez. In it, a giant swastika leans against tanks and guns, crushing the people who move under its enormous weight.\n\nThe image Dosamantes produced for the cancelled lecture by General Jara was eventually used in the poster for the talk entitled “Justicia y ley” (Justice and law), arguably a more eloquent and fitting pairing. The final lecture in the series was Lombardo Toledano’s talk entitled “El Tercer y el Cuarto Reich” (The Third and the Fourth Reich). The powerful image on the poster, the work of Anguiano, shows a proletarian fist destroying a swastika with a hammer.\n\nA few months later, in 1939, a new series of talks on fascism was initiated. Once more, everything was planned at short notice, so no poster was designed for the first lecture, “Génesis y crisis del fascismo internacional” (Genesis and crisis of international fascism), given by Mexican historian Jesús Silva Herzog. For the second talk, a lecture by Francisco Frola on fascism in Italy (p. 211 top), Dosamantes drew a fasces with a bloodstained ax and a murdered man lying in the lower left corner of the image. Zalce completed the scene by drawing two women fleeing the terrifying spectacle.\n\nFor the third lecture, on the subject of German fascism, Arenal and Pujol created an exceptional poster (p. 211 center) that used resources from expressionist collages and photomontages. A ruined city, its inhabitants in flight, is outlined in stencil. Above the city a bayonet and two steel helmets float menacingly in the air. One helmet crowns the figure of a condor and the other a skull, a representation of the aerial attack on the Spanish town of Guernica by German warplanes of the Condor Legion, which had taken place two years earlier, on April 26, 1937.\n\nThe poster for the lecture on “El antisemitismo como arma del fascismo” (Antisemitism as a weapon of fascism) was designed by Isidoro Ocampo and features a brutal image of a Jew tied by the neck to a post, where he is being tortured to death.\n\nThe next three talks were devoted to the different manifestations of fascism in other countries. Ocampo showed Franco behind a row of bayonets, confronted by the Spanish people (p. 211 bottom). José Chávez Morado referenced fascism in Latin America by showing the human form as a pre-Hispanic sculpture in a loincloth, its fist clenched and a star on its breast.14 A crocodile, its huge jaws open and its scales formed by dozens of swastikas, threatens to devour the valiant warrior but evidently fails. Japanese fascism was illustrated by Ocampo, who represented it as a spider with the head of Emperor Hirohito. The spider menaces the Republic of China, whose map is laid out beneath it, as though Hirohito were spreading his web across Asia.\n\nFinally, the series of talks was again brought to a spectacular close with a lecture that proposed strategies for “how to combat fascism” (pp. 212–213). The poster, designed by Escobedo, shows four men—a bourgeois, a soldier, a worker, and a peasant—walking in a line, their arms linked, symbolizing the popular front of that period. The lecture, by Lombardo Toledano, was attended by a large audience and was enthusiastically received and applauded, prompting fresh protests from the German embassy, which demanded Lombardo Toledano’s indictment for an offense against another country’s head of state.15\n\nThe series of eighteen posters produced for the two lecture series is a masterpiece of the first two years of the TGP. Two thousand copies of each poster were printed on thin paper and put up on walls and in schools. They are difficult to find today, and few have been preserved in archives. [. . .] They remain outstanding for their modern concept, their use of resources (including photomontage and collage), their highly expressive images, and their relationship to certain influences and elements of surrealism, Dadaism, and expressionism.\n\nAt the beginning of 1939, the Swiss architect Meyer, who had directed the Bauhaus in Dessau from 1927 to 1930, arrived in Mexico at the invitation of President Cárdenas to direct the Instituto de Urbanización y Planeación (Institute of Urbanization and City Planning) in Mexico City. Meyer established links with the LPCA. As more and more communists arrived from Germany, many of them found the LPCA excessively soft. In early 1941, they therefore founded the Club Heinrich Heine and the journal Alemania libre (Free Germany), institutions that thenceforth formed the cultural core of the German exile community in Mexico. For Alemania libre, Méndez contributed two versions of his engraving La carta (The letter), a piece rich in contrasts. Both versions show a woman hunched over a letter in an attitude of mourning, a powerful antiwar metaphor. In the style of the pacifist works of Käthe Kollwitz, the image is a moving illustration of the sadness of a mother who has lost a son in the war.\n\nThrough Alemania libre, the Alemania Libre en México (Free Germany in Mexico) movement was founded in 1941 with a more radical communist orientation than the LPCA. The goal was to set up a movement among exiled Germans who could construct a free Germany after the anticipated end of the war. The movement soon had more members than the LPCA, the magazine was printed with a circulation of 3,500 copies, and the publications reached other antifascist circles on the American continent.\n\nA publishing house, El Libro Libre, was founded in 1942. Méndez designed the cover for La séptima cruz (The Seventh Cross, p. 340), a successful novel by Anna Seghers that was published by El Libro Libre in January 1943. In the novel, Seghers relates the flight of seven prisoners from a concentration camp, of whom only one, the seventh, survives. Seghers wanted to show the world that it was possible to escape from a concentration camp, that people were fighting against fascism in Hitler’s Germany, and that the National Socialists were not omnipotent. Méndez’s cover illustration features a striking image: the last of seven topless trees on which, symbolically or literally, the seven fugitives were to be hanged. Because the seventh has managed to escape, his cross remains empty. In the background, Nazi henchmen brutally beat a victim while another Nazi, his face hidden, searches for the escaped prisoner behind the seventh tree. The soldier’s boots, armband, and pistol symbolize the cruelty of the regime.\n\nIn April 1943, with the support of President Manuel Ávila Camacho, El Libro Libre brought out the significant Libro negro del terror nazi en Europa (Black book of Nazi terror in Europe) for the Mexico City book fair. Illustrated with images by the artists of the TGP, the book documents evidence of the terror imposed on Europe by the Nazi regime. The project was unique, involving fifty-six writers and twenty-four artists and had an initial print run of ten thousand copies, far larger than usual. The edition sold out within two weeks of publication. A second edition came out in September 1943.16\n\nMeyer was the artistic director for Libro negro del terror nazi en Europa, and it was he who invited the members of the TGP to collaborate on the book. The twenty-two engravings and illustrations produced by the TGP undoubtedly contributed to its great success. Some of the works had originally been designed for the LPCA’s lecture series, while others were new creations. Among the latter were several works by Méndez—including Deportación hacia la muerte (Tren de la muerte) (Deportation to death [Death train], p. 309) and La Gestapo, asesinos de comandita (Tortura) (The Gestapo, hired assassins [Torture])—that were the first artistic documents to address the subject of the persecution and extermination of the Jews.17\n\n4. The Collective Work, the Meetings and Protocols, the Graphics, the Engravers, and the Engraving Techniques\n\nThe TGP’s weekly meetings established the course of its collective work. At these meetings, the members discussed, planned, argued, and modified their views. Opinions often clashed, but the meetings were also opportunities to mediate and search amicably for solutions. Besides the discussions, which are mostly recorded in the group’s minutes, the practical work and printing process on the machines were also important.\n\nThe TGP was a workshop, not just a discussion chamber. At first, in 1937, the TEGP had no space of its own in which to print its works, so it turned to the master engraver Arteaga. Only lithographs could be produced in his workshop, however. The TGP’s characteristic linotypes would come later.\n\nThrough Arteaga, the members acquired an old press, and in July 1938 they moved into their own premises, where the printing press was installed. The members dubbed the press the “Paris Commune,” since it bore a label identifying its origin as “Paris 1871.”\n\nOld as it was, it had all its teeth. The cogs looked as though they had just come off the milling machines. What good metals, and how excellent was the casting done then! Not like today’s, so expensive, and made to need repairs owing to rapid wear, like the automobiles of today, which boast an “aerodynamic” line but need a garage as soon as they turn a corner. Our “Paris Commune” was very heavy, but it was driven by a second-hand (at least, as it was quite old) three-phase motor. The poor press made quite a lot of noise, and lived on with us only while we lasted at Belisario Domínguez. Afterward, it wasn’t possible for it to work. It was used only for making proofs or small runs of engravings.18\n\nIn Calle Belisario Domínguez, the TGP had three rooms: one for the press, another that served as an atelier for the artistic designs, and a third that was used as a meeting room and gallery.\n\nIn 1938 the photographer Josefine Vollmer helped to fit out the workshop’s premises. She had good friends who helped the group obtain a secondhand machine. Méndez later said repeatedly that, without Vollmer’s help, founding a print shop— especially one as long-lived as the TGP—would hardly have been possible. Vollmer never asked for any recompense for her work. Unfortunately, little more is known about this woman whom Méndez saw as so important to the early years of the TGP.\n\nAt the end of 1939, Sánchez joined the workshop as printer. He was twenty-eight and was an enthusiastic worker. Unfortunately, he was one of the people arrested and imprisoned for a few days when the TGP found itself involved in Siqueiros’s attempt on the life of Leon Trotsky—the muralist, together with Arenal and Pujol, had used the print shop to prepare the assassination attempt. When he was released from prison, Sánchez resumed his work and over the years became one of the best and most reputed printers in the country.\n\nIn 1943, the TGP moved to rooms that were more economical, as Mariana Yampolsky later recalled:\n\nIn Regina we had three very dark rooms, and we always worked with electric lighting. As the door was always shut, the comrades would whistle so that someone would open up for them; we had a characteristic whistle. At that time, José Sánchez printed so many posters on the large machine that it was left in tatters. The meetings lasted until midnight, and the rooms would fill up with smoke because the comrades smoked a lot, especially Alfredo Zalce. In the middle of the discussions, it was impossible to see who was speaking because the smoke was so thick. I think discussions among the comrades were more frequent then than they are today.19\n\nIn 1944, when the storm over the attempt to assassinate Trotsky had died down, Siqueiros came back from exile. In his publications and talks, he spoke once again of the renovation of Mexican realist art. He thought the TGP had stagnated with its old techniques and that it was essential to renew them. For some time, he had demanded and practiced the modernization of muralism through the use of spray guns and acrylic colors. He now exhorted the members of the TGP to replace their old machines with new ones—or at least to buy an offset press. He published his critique in the magazine Hoy:\n\nThe Taller de Gráfica Popular needs to make determined inroads in the terrain of new techniques . . . such as offset and many other plastic materials used for mechanical multi-reproduction in the industrial present. This stagnation in craftsmanship . . . stems fundamentally from the fact that the Taller de Gráfica Popular has not amply fulfilled its historic destiny during the almost five years the war has already lasted.\n\nIt is because of the drift into elitism of Mexican engraving over the last five years . . . that the State and the country’s antifascist organizations have not gone to the Taller de Gráfica Popular for the production their pro-democratic activities required.20\n\nAt the TGP, Siqueiros’s proposals were subjected to intense debate. Despite his criticism, members agreed to allow him to make prints in the workshop, where he preferred to use the classic machine worked to perfection by Sánchez.\n\nIn 1948, Sánchez suffered a terrible accident at another print shop and lost his right arm. From hospital, after learning to write with his left hand, he wrote to inform O’Higgins of the accident. In a splendid message, far from requesting help, he asked whether he was needed at the TGP: “Pablo, I send you greetings and inform you that having suffered an accident, I am in bed at the Italian Sanatorium of the IMSS, Calzada de Tlalpan 930. If something crops up with regard to work, come and see me and warn the boys. Mexico City, May 12, 1948.”21 Méndez described the accident in a letter to Georg Stibi:\n\nI’m going to put all the bad things that have happened to us first, and here’s the second one, which is sad and serious for us at this time, because we can’t now replace what we’ve lost: José Sánchez, our lithographer, lost his right arm in an accident at the press where he worked during the day. Fortunately, however, this young worker has shown exemplary mettle: all he wants is to have the best mechanical arm so as to be able to keep doing the same work, which, as he says, he likes very much and has done since he was a boy. I think he really does love his job. A few details will give you an idea of this boy’s character, although you already know him. When the machine severed his arm at the elbow, he didn’t pass out. With his left hand, he held his arm, which was hanging from some tendon, and while the owner of the press, who was behind him, ran off to hide in his office like a rat, and another worker fainted and others didn’t know what to do, he very calmly set about giving himself some first aid, asking one of his workmates to tie his arm to staunch the bleeding, and in that way he remained fully conscious until the operation. Pablo and I see him nearly every day, and at the TGP we’re planning the best way to help him.\n\nIn a gesture of solidarity, all the artists who had printed their works with Sánchez gave money to help cover the cost of a prosthesis. After a few months, Sánchez resumed his activities despite his handicap, working the press with his left hand. From then on, his wife, María Luisa Plata, assisted him on all printing jobs. In 1959, he went with Méndez to Haarlem in Holland to supervise the publication of La pintura mural de la Revolución Mexicana (The Mural Painting of the Mexican Revolution). After the group centered on Méndez had left the TGP, Sánchez opened his own lithographic print shop and worked there for several years.\n\nMany of the engravings printed in higher numbers, like the Estampas de la Revolución Mexicana (Prints of the Mexican Revolution), were not reproduced by hand but run off on an ordinary press at the Imprenta Galatea. In these cases, one of the TGP artists was always present to supervise the process.\n\nIn an interview with Poniatowska published in 1963, Méndez, who had by then left the TGP, responded to Siqueiros’s criticism of the TGP’s “anachronistic” methods and need for an offset press:\n\nThe TGP has produced its work with “anachronistic” materials like lithographic stones. . . . A lithograph, as everyone knows, is a drawing done on a stone. It is useful in that a lot of things can be done with a lithograph that perhaps could not be done on a piece of paper. It is also possible to work directly on a zinc plate instead of on the stone—something that has been done for many years, since Toulouse-Lautrec. There has been an interest expressed by most of the members of the TGP in using or owning an offset press so as to work with a modern procedure, the main purpose being to print large editions. The idea has always seemed a praiseworthy one to me, and still seems so, but it does not fit inside the reality and the possibilities of the workshop. A machine of this type prints four thousand copies an hour. In a working day, it could run off a large number of drawings because five, six, or seven drawings can be printed on the same plate. This means that in one hour, if there are four engravings on a plate, 16,000 copies of an engraving can be printed. This requires a very efficient distribution system of the sort any large business has, whereas we’ve never even remotely resembled businessmen! Besides, a machine can’t be stopped. It needs to work constantly to justify its existence and also so that it can pay for itself. The artists aren’t going to work it, either. It would be absurd to ask the artists to manipulate it themselves. That’s why I have been against the mechanization of the workshop as it is today!22\n\nIn the 1960s, after the departure of Méndez and his group, the TGP decided to buy an offset press.\n\nFrom then on, the TGP’s annual greeting cards were printed on this machine, and so were the calaveras (skulls) and some portfolios made with old plates under the direction of Jesús Álvarez Amaya. The quality of the prints had by this time regrettably deteriorated and cannot be compared with the beautiful lithographs and manual impressions of the previous years. The offset impressions were frequently overladen with black ink and lost the fineness and detail characteristic of linoleum plates. Moreover, as Méndez had said, the machine generated high running costs, and the enormous number of poor-quality engravings it produced proved difficult to distribute. The members of the TGP made various attempts to secure financial support from the state to cover their expenses. These attempts, which included inviting the expresident Adolfo López Mateos to breakfast in August 1965, failed to achieve the expected results and led to divisions within the group, since many members still remembered that López Mateos’s government had been responsible for repressing the schoolteachers’ and rail workers’ strikes and for imprisoning Siqueiros.\n\nAs no minutes or agendas are available for the meetings held in the latter years, pinpointing the moment when the TGP began to decline and became dependent on official funding is not possible. Years later, the group persuaded the authorities of Mexico City to provide them with a house and even pay its electricity bills.\n\nThe TGP archives are no longer open to the public. Since 1981, Francisco Javier Calvo Sánchez has been in charge of the TGP’s prints, and today he is the coordinator of the group. The offset machine purchased in the 1960s is no longer used and appears to be out of order.\n\nThe disused machine is the clearest evidence that Méndez was right: it is better to produce small runs of high quality, which can be sold to cover the workshop’s few expenses, than to have a large machine that increases operating costs that are impossible to pay off because the larger runs are of poor quality and thus difficult to sell.\n\n5. La Estampa Mexicana: The Importance of Good Organization\n\nMeyer’s first contact with the TGP was to produce the works for El libro negro del terror nazi en Europa. He used his own peculiar system to get to know the members, interviewing them with questionnaires to glean information about their working and production methods, their contacts and personal affairs. He thus identified weak points and started to develop solutions. From his experiences at the Bauhaus in Germany, he was convinced that art needed a good marketing strategy, because the artist, apart from requiring income, has to strive within the bounds of social responsibility to produce work that is valued. The Bauhaus attempted to link art with craftwork and ultimately with industrial commercialization to give the humbler classes access to art. The objective was to adapt designs to the industrial process. A return to craft processes was meant to help with the development of a new language of forms that would be a match for mass production. Meyer consequently proposed that the TGP should found an editorial venture of its own that could publish its works in portfolios produced using modern graphic design. His idea was to publish signed and numbered editions, meticulously printed and bound, to be offered to wealthy collectors, museums, and libraries, especially in the United States.\n\nThe TGP, while still known as the TEGP, had published two calendars for the Universidad Obrera de México and two smaller leaflets with excellent lithographs but more rustic standards of production. The calendars were printed on thick paper and the leaflets on extremely thin paper, which prevented them from generating income, despite the fact that the lithographs—especially those for En nombre de Cristo . . . (In the name of Christ . . .)—were true masterpieces. All the workshop’s first lithographic editions were republished on paper of better quality and sold separately or included in other collections, examples being Homenaje a la Revolución (Homage to the Revolution), the 1939 calendar for the Universidad Obrera de México, and Méndez’s series En nombre de Cristo . . . .\n\nIn 1942, after these first publications of the TGP, Meyer worked to establish La Estampa Mexicana as the workshop’s publishing house. The goal was to create an editorial venture that would permit the organized sale of the, mainly original, work of the artists who were members and friends of the workshop.23 Establishing it as a legal company proved difficult, however, since it initially had too few members and no capital. The lawyer Luis Córdova summarized the legal problem:\n\nHannes Meyer\n\nLa Estampa Mexicana presenta algunas obras del TGP / Mexihkanantli / “Río Escondido”\n\n[La Estampa Mexicana presents some of the works by the TGP / Mexihkanantli / “Hidden River”], 1948\n\nElizabeth Catlett\n\nNiño Otomí: Taller de Gráfica Popular desea a sus amigos Feliz Navidad y Año Nuevo\n\n[Otomí Child: Taller de Gráfica Popular wishes its friends a merry Christmas and a happy New Year] ca. 1960\n\nLa Estampa Mexicana is a de facto company, formed by fewer than ten people, who propose the publication of books of various kinds, and which has an extremely limited capital that is barely recovered after each of its publications. Its gains do not even permit it to amortize that capital, since all it recoups through a job goes mainly into a new investment. . . . In conclusion, as the group of people who make up La Estampa Mexicana cannot form a corporation, the only resort they have left is to register themselves legally as a Civil Association for cultural ends, which functions for commercial purposes as a profit-sharing association.24\n\nOnce established, La Estampa Mexicana published its first two editions under Meyer’s direction. The pamphlets Homenaje a la Revolución and En nombre de Cristo . . . counted as the first publications, although they came out before the official founding of La Estampa Mexicana. [. . .] The third and fifth editions of La Estampa Mexicana, both from 1943, were portfolios of twenty-five images, one based on a selection of original engravings by Posada, the other a set of prints by Méndez, both of 1943.\n\nWith the publication of the first album, dedicated to Posada, Méndez realized one of his principal dreams, as the great master of Mexican graphics was a figure of enormous significance for him and his colleagues. Méndez repeatedly expressed his admiration for the engraver from Aguascalientes and regarded the TGP as his successor. Just as Posada used popular engravings to illustrate current events and everyday life, Méndez wanted the TGP’s imagery to do likewise, unpretentiously but with a social commitment to serve the Mexican people.\n\nThe editors wanted the TGP’s first portfolio to pay tribute to their great idol, and at the beginning of 1943, after obtaining Posada’s original plates from Arteaga’s studio, La Estampa Mexicana published the first fifty copies of its album dedicated to Posada. Zalce, Kahn, his wife (Connie Kahn), and Sánchez were the primary collaborators. A shortage of paper during the years of the Second World War meant that the planned run of one hundred copies had to be halved. Neither Chinese rice paper nor money was available for more copies. However, the edition was finished years later as funds became available. In the early years, La Estampa Mexicana lived on dreams and a shoestring budget.\n\nOne hundred copies were printed of the second portfolio, which contains twenty-five woodcuts created by Méndez for the magazine Horizonte and for the LEAR. Few copies are extant today. The author Juan de la Cabada, who, like Méndez, had been a member of Lucha Intelectual Proletaria (International Proletarian Struggle) and of the LEAR, wrote the prologue for this edition: “Here I voice my praise and the honor it does me to speak of Leopoldo Méndez, a great artist, the best engraver in Mexico, and one of the most extraordinary human beings I have met.”\n\nSmall, carefully designed brochures were published for promotional purposes. This was a novelty for the graphics market and an idea typical of Meyer, who regarded the commercialization of the group’s works as a matter of particular importance. Thanks to good administration, optimum handling of the balance sheet, the transparency of income and expenses, and continual contact with trade unions and museums to market its albums in the United States, the TGP and La Estampa Mexicana soon made considerable profits, which allowed them to function successfully for several years.\n\nAs Meyer still hoped to make sufficient income from his profession as an architect, he gave up his job at La Estampa Mexicana and left it in the hands of a new director, Stibi:\n\nIn July 1943, it was decided to employ a paid administrator. It was at that time that Georg Stibi started to collaborate with La Estampa Mexicana, having been proposed and accepted by the administration, with a salary of 100 pesos a month, which was later increased in November–December 1943 to 150 pesos. In January 1944, the premises at Artes #9 were rented for La Estampa Mexicana.25\n\nIn Germany, Stibi had been imprisoned for his activities as editor-in-chief of the communist newspaper Die Freiheit (Freedom) and had therefore sought refuge in Mexico. From 1943 to 1946, he handled the affairs of La Estampa Mexicana scrupulously and meticulously, generating considerable financial profits for the publishing house. In the TGP, the Jews, communists, and antifascists who had taken refuge in Mexico found the propaganda support they needed to express their plight. For its part, the TGP found that the newly arrived refugees, who hoped to find new jobs and duties, offered the potential to optimize their organization. The situation proved perfect for close collaboration but lasted only until the war ended and the refugees returned to their homeland.\n\nSeven editions were created during Stibi’s administration: Rito de la tribu Huichol (Rite of the Huichol tribe, 1945), by Bracho; Dichos populares (Popular sayings, 1944), by Anguiano; Incidentes melódicos del mundo irracional (Melodic incidents of the irrational world, 1944), by Méndez and Cabada, plus an album of Méndez’s forty woodcuts for the book (1945); Estampas de Yucatán (Prints of Yucatán, 1946), by Zalce; El sombrerón (The big sombrero, 1946), by Zalce with a text by Bernardo Ortiz de Montellano; and Bajo la línea del Ecuador (Under the Equator, 1946), by Galecio.\n\nRito de la tribu Huichol, with four lithographs by Bracho, was produced in an edition of only ten copies. In fine gradations of gray tones, the pages show the sun dance and peyote ritual of the Huichol Indians. The cardboard cover has an interesting and typographically modern design.\n\nThe art historian Justino Fernández wrote the prologue for the edition of twenty copies of Anguiano’s Dichos populares. In his text, Fernández relates the popular sense of Anguiano’s images, which the artist had endowed with a new language, to certain aspects of medieval art and to fantasy in modernist art.\n\nAt 1,200 copies, Cabada’s Incidentes melódicos del mundo irracional was La Estampa Mexicana’s largest project during this period. Like Anguiano’s album, this magnificent volume tells of the irrational world of the present using satirical figures from the animal kingdom. It is illustrated with forty woodcuts by Méndez, some of which were published in a special edition of twenty-five high-quality copies that was awarded a prize at the 1946 Mexico City book fair. Carl O. Schniewind, a curator with the Art Institute of Chicago, made the following remarks on this work:\n\nHis woodcuts and lithographs have long been known outside Mexico, but the illustrations of this work, which [Méndez] has just finished, are in my view a sign of an important step in his artistic career. The splendid technique is not sufficient to explain the force of these illustrations, which is due to the powerful simplicity of a composition that despite its small size has the monumental impact of a mural. Méndez has freely used ancient and recent Mexican sources with the assuredness of one who recognizes they are part of him and he of them.26\n\nZalce’s album of eight lithographs, Estampas de Yucatán, was published with a run of one hundred copies. Méndez wrote of it,\n\nThe force of Alfredo Zalce’s lithographs in his Estampas de Yucatán resides and becomes clearest, in my opinion, in what pertains to the plastic arts, which Zalce handles with profound expertise. The so-called black style in which he has made these prints is, I think, especially difficult to apply while preserving plastic emotional freshness, but Alfredo Zalce manages this, and achieving it requires true mastery. Nevertheless, what most draws my attention, what most seduces me, is the genuine realism he produces, human realism, which has nothing to do with naturalist realism.27\n\nAlso published in 1946 was Montellano’s book El sombrerón, another story from the world of the fantastic, with illustrations by Zalce. The last work published during Stibi’s administration of La Estampa Mexicana was the volume of thirty linocuts by the Ecuadorean artist Galecio. This edition was awarded a prize at the Mexico City book fair. Méndez wrote the prologue, and the publication drew praise from the press:\n\nThese small works of art present different aspects of life in the land of cocoa, of the cold mountains of the Andes and the hot coasts of the Pacific. Under the influence of Mexican artistic circles, Galecio has evoked scenes and typical figures of his country with the expressive force refined by the memory of distant models.28\n\nWhen Stibi returned to Germany in 1946 after administering La Estampa Mexicana for three years, he left the publishing venture in good financial shape. The balance sheet showed a credit of more than thirteen thousand pesos, a great success in view of the initial balance of one hundred pesos. Back in Germany, Stibi became the editor-in-chief of the newspaper Neues Deutschland (New Germany) and was later appointed minister of foreign relations of the German Democratic Republic. However, he always kept in touch with the TGP, as he remembered his years of exile in Mexico with nostalgia.\n\nAfter Stibi’s departure, Meyer retook the helm of the publishing house he had founded and remained in the post of director until his return to Switzerland in 1949. Another five portfolios were produced under his supervision, as well as four complete series of postcards, a dozen brochures designed in the Bauhaus style, and El Taller de Gráfica Popular: Doce años de obra artística colectiva (The Taller de Gráfica Popular: Twelve years of collective artistic work).\n\nHis wife, Léna Meyer-Bergner, who had graduated in textile design from the Bauhaus, helped him with the graphic design. She was responsible for the beautiful linen-lined folders of the TGP’s portfolios. The first of these was Mexihkanantli by the French artist Charlot, which was published in 1947 in an edition of 150 copies. This beautiful symphony of lithographs in harmonious colors is a tribute to mothers and their children. The blue portfolio designed by Meyer-Bergner provided the perfect frame for the chromolithographic prints.\n\nThat year, Meyer finished the edition of prints by Posada, as he finally managed to obtain enough high-quality rice paper in Chicago to print copies fifty-one to one hundred.\n\nTo sum up, under Meyer’s direction, the following publications were brought out by La Estampa Mexicana: Mexihkanantli: Mexican Mother—10 Chromolithographs (1947), by Charlot; the collective portfolio Estampas de la Revolución Mexicana, 85 grabados del Taller de Gráfica Popular (Prints of the Mexican Revolution, 85 engravings by the Taller de Gráfica Popular, 1947, pp. 262–301); Río Escondido (Hidden River), with ten linocuts (1948), by Méndez; Vida en mi barriada (Life in my neighborhood), with fifteen prints (1948), by Ramírez; the collective portfolio CTAL 1938–1948: Diez grabados de los artistas del Taller de Gráfica Popular (CTAL 1938–1948: Ten engravings by the artists of the Taller de Gráfica Popular, 1948); four series of postcards (1948); and El Taller de Gráfica Popular: Doce años de obra artística colectiva (1949). Meyer also created a photographic collection with photographic reproductions of the TGP’s best work for distribution to the press and interested clients. Used for publicity, the catalog also allowed the workshop to avoid sending original graphics when, for example, it was asked for an image to illustrate a newspaper article.\n\nLa Estampa Mexicana’s biggest project was the edition Estampas de la Revolución Mexicana, to which the artists of the TGP dedicated many hours of work. Meyer wrote of this edition,\n\nIt seems to us that the last of these three editions merits our full enthusiasm and heralds a new phase in the 10-year life of the TGP; for it is the first work of a truly collective nature in which nearly all our artists have taken part, without its being easy to distinguish each one. The 75 prints are of virtually the same artistic quality and technique, and reflect the high artistic discipline acquired in 10 years of collective training. It is a collective work of Mexican realism, profoundly linked to the revolutionary sentiments and memories of the people, and artistically it speaks in their language, it is comprehensible to all, and it is illustrative, like Posada, like “Les misères de la Guerre” by Callot, or “Les images d’Epinal” (in France) and the “Neuruppiner Bilderbogen,” colorful engravings that were popular in Prussia in the last century.29\n\nWith the brochures designed in the Bauhaus style, a new market was opened for the collective’s portfolios. Moreover, thanks to its beautifully produced editions, the TGP emerged from years of financial crisis. Now, for the first time, it was in a position to hire a treasurer. Ruth Covo started to look after the finances and acted as administrator of La Estampa Mexicana. New Year’s greeting cards started to be published once more, helping to popularize the TGP’s work.\n\nThe portfolio with ten linocuts by Méndez, originally created for the intertitles of the film Río Escondido, was published in 1948 in two editions, rustic and deluxe. The linen-bound deluxe edition was offered to museums, galleries, and the wealthiest clients. Ramírez’s Vida en mi barriada, was brought out in no fewer than three editions: twenty-five copies on Chinese rice paper, twentyfive on Corsican paper with gray binding, and twenty-five on ivory-colored cards.\n\nMeyer’s greatest legacy is the black-bound Doce años de obra artística colectiva celebrating the twelfth anniversary of the TGP. For this project, Meyer carefully drafted biographies of all members of the workshop, dedicating a double-page spread to each. He also recounted the first ten years of the TGP, describing its various collective projects, posters, and albums. A unique work, Doce años is the most complete edition of the TGP’s and La Estampa Mexicana’s first decade to have been published and has served as the basis for numerous studies.\n\nWhen Meyer departed Mexico, he left the TGP’s accounts with a positive balance of 10,300 pesos and a complete inventory of engravings, albums, and plates. Unfortunately, the work of La Estampa Mexicana came to an end almost immediately. No further portfolios or special editions of the same quality were produced, as the income generated was insufficient, and without professional administration the TGP struggled to cover its operating costs.\n\n6. The Frente Nacional de Artes Plásticas and the Civil Association\n\nThe TGP’s achievements in the 1940s—especially the wonderful Estampas de la Revolución Mexicana and the Doce años de obra artística colectiva —gave it a solid foundation on which to confront the initial phase of the Cold War. The artists then devoted themselves mainly to work connected with the International Peace Movement. They also won new commissions thanks to their close links with the trade union movement in the United States.\n\nOne of the most outstanding works of this period was the set of transparencies for the project Who Wants War? Who Wants Peace?, carried out for a peace conference in the United States. Designed for a slide presentation, the images came from lithographs and drawings reproduced photomechanically, a technological innovation at that moment. Since its foundation, the TGP had created telones (curtains), stage backdrops or large posters for display on a curtain or wall behind speakers at public events. Nobody kept them, and all have now disappeared. By 1950, the TGP was already producing conference presentations with sequences of images that provided supporting material for speakers trying to rouse an audience with antiwar slogans.\n\nThe artists, and above all Méndez, made use of the modern technique of photo reproduction, but they also employed the resources of cinematography. For films by the director and actor Gabriel Figueroa, Méndez made several engravings that have the look of backgrounds used in the credit and title sequences of silent films. The engravings were projected on the cinema screen in a monumental ten-meter format. Ten of these engravings made for the cinema were subsequently published in the album that bears the film’s title, Río Escondido, in a special edition produced by La Estampa Mexicana. For the artists, seeing their delicate engravings transferred to a large format was a dream come true. Engravers and muralists had long engaged in a kind of subliminal competition, as the latter tended to be regarded as more important. For this reason, the reproduction of the engravers’ works in a monumental format was an opportunity they seized with enthusiasm.\n\nThe TGP created many large posters for the different peace conferences held during the 1950s. The posters, along with various prospectuses and small pamphlets—including, for example, Queremos vivir (We want to live, 1950, p. 193 top right), illustrated with nineteen woodcuts made collectively by the members of the TGP—were created as propaganda against the new arms race. The trade union movement, which had found a charismatic leader in Lombardo Toledano, also enjoyed the continual support of TGP artists.\n\nDuring this period, the TGP’s posters were no longer illustrated with lithographs but almost entirely with linocuts. Many were made into wonderful multicolored prints, such as the collective work for the poster La mortandad de niños por hambre y enfermedades en Rosita y Cloete, es grande. Ayudemos a los que quedan (Child mortality owing to hunger and disease in Rosita and Cloete is great. Let us help those who are left), by Méndez, Escobedo, and Catlett. The image is regarded as a successor to Kollwitz’s important sculpture Mutter mit totem Sohn (Mother with Dead Son), also known as Pietà, which the German artist created after the loss of her son in the First World War. Both works are of a similar monumentality.\n\nOther important examples of realist graphics in the style of the TGP are the engravings sent by Arturo García Bustos from Guatemala, where he had founded a graphics studio during the government of Jacobo Árbenz. The studio functioned until Árbenz’s democratically elected administration was deposed in a military coup led by the United States, thus preventing the workshop from continuing its practice in that Central American country. García Bustos’s magnificent and highly proficient series of eleven engravings, entitled Testimonio de Guatemala (Testimony of Guatemala), shows not only how much he had learned from Méndez but his ability to apply that knowledge independently.\n\nGuatemala was not the only nation where a political shift to the right occurred. The peace movement, which the TGP supported so enthusiastically, was soon deemed by the U.S. government to have been infiltrated by communists supported by the countries of the socialist bloc and their sympathizers. During the smear campaign waged against communists in the United States, the TGP was also declared a “Communist front organization.” Its members were blacklisted and denied the right to travel to the United States. Working exclusively for peace organizations thus limited the possibilities of the workshop and its artists throughout the continent.\n\nIn those years, however, the artists gathered to defend their interests, as they had done in 1934 in the LEAR. A call went out on March 18, 1952, inviting all Mexican artists to convene a national assembly, which was held on May 22. Over the course of three days and thirty speeches, various cultural associations, the TGP among them, denounced the grave deficiencies in the cultural policies of the time and demanded greater commitment from the government. In a paradoxical change of direction, the artists even voiced their opposition to artistic freedom and their support for more planning and control by the state. This, however, led them into cul-de-sac. The TGP, for example, demanded that a government delegation meet with delegates from the FNAP to organize effective propaganda within all government departments and official and semiofficial organizations and to use all available means to address nationwide industry, trade, and banking so that when these organizations need (any) work related to the plastic arts, they will know where to go. . . . This committee must work to exert total control over all the plastic artworks the government needs to execute. 30\n\nTo ask for the arts to be organized and controlled by the state—a situation common in the socialist countries of that time—was highly unusual. In other publications, criticism was increasingly leveled at artists who tried to avoid state controls, who practiced another kind of art, and who did not adhere to the realist tradition of the muralist movement.\n\nWhen the FNAP was founded, its demands were neither left-wing nor radical but rather aspired to moderation, to collaboration between artists and the state. Nevertheless, some members hoped for closer collaboration and more support. The fact that many of the members of the FNAP were simultaneously members of the TGP must have influenced the FNAP’s decision to organize a series of major art competitions, such as the graphics competitions held in 1952 and 1953 on the themes of “Interpretation of the program of hydraulic works of the six-year term 1946–1952” and “Second centenary of the birth of the liberator Miguel Hidalgo y Castillo.” In both competitions, the works submitted by the TGP received the best reviews and the largest number of prizes.\n\nDuring this period, the TGP wanted to improve its internal organization and decided to approve new statutes and acquire the status of a civil association. The new declaration of principles, approved in January 1956 after lengthy discussion, introduced several changes to the workshop’s functions. “The defense of the national culture” was declared to be the TGP’s central function, but artists who set themselves such a lofty goal are doomed to failure. The full scope of this contradiction becomes more apparent in light of the TGP’s demands for greater support from the government—support needed to acquire an offset machine, for example, or to assist with competitions—while also claiming to defend freedom of opinion and the professional interests of artists, ignoring the tendency of the government to suppress artistic freedom.\n\nThe TGP’s new declaration of principles was derived from three resolutions taken at the Continental Congress on Culture, held in Santiago de Chile in 1953:\n\n1. To protect and foster the national cultures of America.\n\n2. To strengthen cultural exchange.\n\n3. To defend the free expression of opinion.\n\nThe central points of the new declaration of principles were thus:\n\n1. The Taller de Gráfica Popular is a collective work center for the functional promotion and study of the different branches of engraving and painting and the different means of reproduction.\n\n2. The Taller de Gráfica Popular will make a constant effort to ensure its production helps the Mexican people to defend and enrich the national culture, which cannot be achieved without the independent existence of Mexico in a peaceful world.\n\n3. The TGP considers that an art at the service of the people must reflect the social reality of its time and requires the union of realist content and forms. Applying the foregoing principle, the TGP will work for the constant enhancement of the artistic capabilities of its members in the conviction that the goal of art at the service of the people is reached only with the finest artistic quality.\n\n4. The TGP will cooperate professionally for other studios or cultural institutions, workers’ organizations, and all progressivist movements and institutions in general.\n\n5. The TGP will defend freedom of expression and the professional interests of artists.\n\nWith its new statutes and declaration of principles, the TGP became a civil association under the name “Taller de Gráfica Popular, A.C.” The group decided to end its administrative negligence, which had left the balance sheet in the red since the departure of Stibi and Meyer, and efforts were thus made to manage the accounts and protocols with special care. However, these were difficult times.\n\nIn its twenty years of existence, the TGP had exhibited works in nearly five hundred exhibitions, an average of about two exhibitions per month. The volume of work implied by such a schedule is difficult to comprehend. The figures are most comparable to those of a large museum, with the difference that the workshop had far fewer personnel. Calculating how many engravings were damaged or worn, how many prints were lost, and how much was spent on their transport and delivery is impossible. Entire exhibitions never came back, either because they were lost in transit or simply because they were never returned. An extensive exhibition administration would have been needed to maintain control over the huge volume of works going in and out; however, only one member of the workshop took charge of this area. If the TGP had charged a small amount to defray the expenses occasioned by the exhibitions, as is done today, its economic problems might have diminished.\n\nThe first great wave of TGP exhibitions to be held in the United States took place under the direction of Meyer and Stibi, even before the exhibitions in Mexico became popular. 31 From the late 1940s, following the onset of McCarthyism in the United States, hardly any exhibitions of the group’s work were shown there. Concurrent with this development, the countries of the communist Eastern bloc discovered the work of the TGP and were enthused by its combative style of realist art.\n\nDuring the World Peace Council’s Congress of the People for Peace, held in Vienna in 1952, the TGP was awarded the council’s International Peace Prize. The wording used at the award ceremony, which took place the following year, was ambiguous: the prize was awarded “to Leopoldo Méndez and his collaborators.” This led to considerable disagreement among the members of the TGP, as the prize was to be placed on the lapel of a jacket, and that jacket belonged to Méndez. Although some members were upset and disappointed, the award increased the TGP’s popularity in Europe, leading to a series of exhibitions there, particularly in the countries behind the Iron Curtain, which regarded the art of the Mexican Revolution and its successor state as confirmation of the existence of a realist art with social and revolutionary commitment. The first\n\nLeopoldo Méndez\n\nEl sembrador: Órgano popular del PNR [The sower: Popular organ of the PNR], 1931\n\n¡Queremos vivir! [We want to live] 1950\n\nMéxico está en peligro [Mexico is in danger], 1958\n\nFrancisco Dosamantes\n\nTaller de Gráfica Popular: Exposición 20 litografías\n\n[Taller de Gráfica Popular: 20 lithographs exhibition], 1939 works from the golden era of the TGP adhere less to this line, however, showing instead the influences of surrealism, avant-garde photomontage and collage, expressionism, and the Bauhaus. After the success of the TGP’s exhibitions in Poland, Romania, Czechoslovakia, and the Soviet Union, its style grew more uniform. Details were rendered more through the contrast of black and white than through scales of gray.\n\nThe TGP held an extraordinary number of exhibitions in Eastern Europe from 1948 to 1963, and they were tremendously successful. For example, Aguirre went to China, Bustos to Cuba, and Méndez and Arenal to Vienna. The fame of the TGP even reached China, where its engravings found favor with both the people and the leaders of the Chinese Communist Party.\n\nSpecial exhibitions were sometimes accompanied by members of the TGP, to the great benefit of its artists. The TGP’s representatives abroad expanded the group’s horizons while sharing its ideas with other countries, so that the concept of an artistic collective served as an example for other groups. After returning to Mexico, the artists related their experiences to the group, and the writings on art of Mao Tse-tung, for example, were then studied and published in Materiales de estudio del Taller de Gráfica Popular (Study materials of the Taller de Gráfica Popular). Some of the TGP’s exhibitions remained abroad if museums bought the exhibited works. Other exhibitions were reciprocated with gifts—for example, Polish and Soviet posters and albums of work by artists such as Maria Hiszpańska-Neumann and Alfred Hrdlicka—were used to organize exhibitions in Mexico.\n\nThe TGP’s reception in Poland merits special attention, since that country’s own graphic tradition gives it a special affinity with engraving. The TGP’s 1949 exhibition in Poznań was such a resounding success that four other Polish cities decided to show the works that same year. The following year, another TGP exhibition toured six Polish cities. A third exhibition followed in 1951 within the framework of the World Peace Council’s international peace conference, and another in 1954. Finally, in 1955, a large exhibition of Mexican art, organized by the FNAP, was held in Warsaw before traveling to Kraków and Wrocław. The artists who accompanied the show also gave talks in Łódź,\n\nLublin, Gdańsk, Kraków, and Wrocław. The Polish government even published an album— Grafika Meksykańska (Mexican graphics)—of twenty-four large-format engravings by artists such as Aguirre, Anguiano, Arenal, Beltrán, Roberto Berdecio, Fernando Castro Pacheco, Catlett, Dosamantes, Gabriel Fernández Ledesma, and Andrea Gómez.\n\nAn extensive book by Norbert Frýd, Mexická grafika (Mexican graphics), was published in Prague in 1955, and in 1956 Gerhard PommeranzLiedtke wrote Mexikanische Grafik (Mexican graphics), a book published in Berlin by the Akademie der Künste (Academy of the Arts).\n\nAnother surprising success was the presentation in China of the exhibition The Graphic Art of Mexico in Struggle, shown in March and May 1956 in Beijing and Guangzhou respectively. This was followed by another major exhibition organized by the FNAP, which opened in Beijing in July. The artist who accompanied the July exhibition, Aguirre, taught several courses in graphics in the Chinese capital, with large numbers of pupils enrolled. This influenced the later opening in China of several centers dedicated to graphics and operated with a system resembling that of the TGP.\n\nIn short, the TGP’s international reputation swelled considerably during the 1950s. On the occasion of the twentieth anniversary of the workshop, several exhibitions were held in Mexico. Both in the nation’s capital and in its various states, celebrations were organized, and numerous catalogs and reviews were published.\n\nThat this growing popularity abroad was not reflected by the atmosphere within the TGP is regrettable. The arguments over the group’s orientation that began with the disagreements over the International Peace Prize led to a crisis in the group’s productivity. Possibly the frequent absence of its most important members—those chosen to accompany the TGP’s overseas exhibitions— undermined the working spirit of those who remained in Mexico. As a result, the exhibitions of the 1950s almost exclusively showed production from earlier years, with little new work included.\n\nThe artists’ popularity even prompted the nomination of Beltrán and Méndez as parliamentary candidates for the Partido Popular in the 1955 elections. Neither artist was elected, but the electoral campaign occupied considerable time that would otherwise have been devoted to artistic work. For this reason, even minor jobs were left incomplete, as Méndez lamented in his notebook. With great effort over the course of several years, the workshop managed to finish one major portfolio in 1960, 450 años de lucha: Homenaje al pueblo mexicano (450 years of struggle: Homage to the Mexican people). Partly a reprint of Estampas de la Revolución Mexicana (sixty-five engravings were drawn from that earlier work), supplemented with sixty-nine new images, the volume had the highest print run of any TGP album: five thousand copies. The new works were partly taken from old contexts and significantly reduced in size, and the images, reproduced in litho-offset, were of an inferior quality. The resulting publication was less homogenous than Estampas de la Revolución Mexicana of 1947, and the impressions made using the litho-offset technique fell short of the quality of the original album.\n\n8. The Division in 1960, the Archive, the TGP Today\n\nOn August 9, 1960, Siqueiros was arrested, accused of “social dissolution,” and detained in the Palacio de Lecumberri, at that time still a prison northeast of Mexico City. Méndez was still in Europe overseeing the printing of La pintura mural de la Revolución Mexicana.\n\nAs repression grew in Mexico, with restrictions on the right to strike and an increasing number of political prisoners, the factions within the TGP approached an irreparable rupture. Those who identified with the [Mexican] Communist Party protested against the arrest of Siqueiros and refused to participate in the Second Inter-American Biennial of Mexico. The faction headed by Méndez won the First Prize for Engraving at the same biennial and soon ceased to cooperate with the TGP. Mexiac, Gómez, Carlos Jurado, Yampolsky, Iker Larrauri, Anguiano, Berdecio, and Méndez himself all left the workshop at this time.\n\nAfter the government of López Mateos nationalized the electrical industry in 1961, a new political party, the Movimiento de Liberación Nacional (National Liberation Movement, MLN) emerged from a successor to former president Cárdenas’s Comité Impulsor de la Paz (Committee to Promote Peace). By this time, the TGP’s active members were Mora, Catlett, García Bustos, Aguirre, and Xavier Íñiguez, who collaborated with the MLN. Pujol and Guerrero had also returned to the group. The following year, Adolfo Quinteros was elected general secretary of the TGP, and O’Higgins, Alberto Beltrán, Fanny Rabel, and Íñiguez left the collective. Méndez, Guillermo Bonilla, Yampolsky, Alberto Beltrán, Luis Beltrán, and Íñiguez then tried to recover their plates, which were in the custody of the TGP. Only a modest exhibition was held at the Universidad Obrera de México to commemorate the TGP’s twenty-fifth anniversary.\n\nIn 1963, for the first time in its history, the TGP’s directorial posts were occupied by women— Catlett, Celia Calderón, and Mercedes Quevedo— who created numerous posters and engravings for the feminist movement.\n\nDuring the electoral campaigns of 1964, the MLN split in two. The Frente Electoral del Pueblo (People’s Electoral Front, FEP) was created in opposition to both the government and the socialist Partido Popular. The division of the MLN led to a new division within the TGP and to endless arguments within the group. Bracho, Catlett, and the women directors renounced their responsibilities to the workshop, which decided to pause its activities for one year. During this time, no meetings were held, and no work was produced.\n\nMany additional members left the TGP after 1965 in protest of a breakfast that the group’s workshop coordinator, Arenal, organized for ex-president López Mateos with the purpose of “thanking him for benefiting the organization” during his mandate and asking him for additional support. This initiative, according to its critics, was taken without consulting the group and, if successful, would have meant the loss of its financial independence. As internal divisions grew, a gradual but relentless decline of the TGP unfolded. Mora, Guerrero, Catlett, Quevedo, Calderón, Franco, María Luisa Martín, and Alberto Rovira, among others, left at this time, never to return. Quinteros was expelled, and Sarah Jiménez left in 1965. At this point only Bracho, Francisco Luna, Ramón Sosamontes, and Álvarez Amaya remained in the TGP.\n\nIn 1968, a year marked by the violent repression of the student movement in Tlatelolco, Álvarez Amaya was appointed general coordinator of the TGP, a function he continued to fulfill until his death in 2010. From then on, the workshop\n\nLibertad de expresión [Freedom of expression], 1968 concentrated on poetry readings and on the organization of sales and auctions of works from the archive. In 1975, the government of President Luis Echeverría Álvarez provided financial support for the TGP’s move to a new location on Dr. Carmona y Valle, paid all its maintenance costs, and gave the group a new offset machine. Nevertheless, the TGP’s main source of financial support at this time was the sale of works by former members.\n\nThe only collective editions published since 1970 by the TGP are three portfolios dealing with topical issues of the day: Zapata (1972), Chile (1974), and Vietnam.\n\nIn the late 1990s, the government of the federal district granted the TGP, then under the direction of Álvarez Amaya, a building to house its workshop.\n\nThanks to its numerous exhibitions abroad in the 1950s, the TGP had years of splendor, followed by a gradual decrease in the creation of collective projects and of posters referring to political issues of the day. The only collective works that continued to be produced regularly were the calaveras. Made every November by the TGP since its founding, the calaveras in time became a highly popular classic. Drawing inspiration from a retrospective analysis of political, social, cultural, and economic events, the TGP’s artists caricatured the most important personalities and happenings of the previous months. In league with Mexican and immigrant writers, the artists devoted themselves enthusiastically to inventing rhymes and poems, turning this activity into a feast of collective creativity.\n\nFortunately, this practice is still ongoing at the TGP. The genre employs a great deal of humor to portray the decadence of national politics and the problems of contemporary Mexican society. However, many of the works of the latest generations are not the result of working with traditional engraving techniques but with offset impressions taken from drawings.\n\nSince the TGP was founded, its statutes have laid down the guidelines for its organization, group dynamics, and creative methods. One key requirement was that two (later three) copies of every work printed at the TGP be handed in for inclusion in the group’s archive. Thanks to the resulting collection, the TGP was able to organize its many exhibitions in Mexico and abroad.\n\nIn May 1972, thirty ex-members of the TGP and Méndez’s widow filed suit with the attorney general of the republic against the Taller de Gráfica Popular, A.C., for continuing to sell works from the archive, which the plaintiffs argued should be deemed “cultural assets of the Nation.” The plea, ratified in August 1972, was ultimately unsuccessful.\n\nIn 1973, the TGP deposited 3,558 prints and sixty-two posters from its archive at the Academia de Artes. Three years later, the TGP inaugurated the Museo de la Estampa Militante (Museum of the Militant Print), which ceased to exist shortly after opening. What remains in the archive today is in the custody of the Taller de Gráfica Popular, A.C. The contents are neither inventoried nor available for public consultation.\n\n* Helga Prignitz, Estampa y lucha: El Taller de Gráfica Popular 1937–2017, exh. cat.
