        "text": "Mexico and Mexican-descent immigrants continue to be ignobly thrown into the U.S. public opinion arena without mercy.\n\nThis time, extremists are uptight to hear the sound of Spanish. That is, they dislike the language of Cervantes being spoken on this side of the border. Quick to blame it on recent immigration, their attacks are inconsistent with the chronology of U.S. history. As the most senior European language in America, Spanish must merit as high a degree of respect as that given to English. The question is, why isnt it? In answering that question, I offer the following five reasons justifying its positive influence in our nation. I do so with two goals in mind. First, give notice to skeptics who insist on keeping Mexico and the Spanish language out of the U.S. story. Second, get the attention of Mexican-descent U.S. citizens who may be unaware of their long, honored history in the U.S.\n\nReason 1. None other than Stephen F. Austin saw Mexico as a bright future for poor, sharecropper Anglo families. Economically excluded by the U.S. upper class, this first wave of anguished citizens sought refuge in Mexico, adopting its distinctive way of life. In fact, Austin legally changed his first name from Stephen to Esteban and was proud to be bi-lingual. Sadly, revisionist mainstream Texas historians changed that initial white Anglo Saxon migration to Mexico from one of despair and want, to one contrived in 1836 Texas Revolution myths.\n\nReason 2. The large number of Spanish-named places in the U.S. is not the work of recent Mexican immigrants bringing their culture over here. In truth, it was U.S. Anglos who swam across at least three rivers (Mississippi, Red, and Sabine) to reach these Spanish-speaking towns. For example, San Antonio, Texas; Santa Fe, New Mexico; Tucsón, Arizona; and Los Angeles, California are the best known 16th-18th Century towns settled by Spanish Mexican pioneers. (Key Point: Santa Fe, New Mexico, born in 1610, is the oldest capital city in the U.S. Thus, Spanish traces are quite visible still, creating the vibrant Spanish Mexican (Native American) ambiance the region is known for today.)\n\nReason 3. Our New Spain ancestors (for instance, Las Villas del Norte in Nuevo Santander (Tamaulipas), San Antonio, Nacogdoches, and La Bahia/Goliad) helped the English colonies with soldiers, food, war materiel, clothing, and financial support. Specifically, they donated money; (Españoles, two pesos; Mestizos and Indios, one peso each). Oddly, mainstream historians ignore the Spanish-speaking Americans quick response to the colonists needs. Rather, U.S. history today supports only an English viewpoint. Thats in spite of the fact that we vigorously celebrate July 4th, 1776, as our day of independence from, yes, England. Ironic, isnt it?\n\nReason 4. Last year, after nearly 240 years since it was first proposed, General Gálvez received U.S. honorary citizenship for his vital help to General George Washington. Upon hearing the news, most citizens (sadly many of Hispanic-descent) were surprised to hear about General Gálvez Independence involvement. To be sure, General Marquis de Lafayette was given the prestigious honor in 2002. The reason why General Galvez wasnt saluted at the same time lies in the selective teaching of mainstream U.S. history. Thats the same mindset that contributes to todays negative view of Mexico and the Spanish language in the U.S.\n\nReason 5. There is much the U.S. owes to the Spanish Mexican culture. For example, Mexican currency was a preferred legal tender for merchants and citizens alike in the U.S. colonies. Too, over two-thirds of U.S. land has Spanish footprints. For example, Spanish-speaking people inhabited the entire middle-lower tier of states, from Florida to California. Again, Anglo settlers moving west used Spanish maps and Camino Real trails. In the words of Author H. E. Bolton, Half of the U.S. rests on Spanish land; perhaps more if only the U.S. respected Spanish territorial claims from the 16th-18th centuries.\n\nTo be fair, in encountering weaker civilizations around the world, all European countries ruthlessly exploited native cultures. Spain and England both led the pack. In fact, Walt Whitman said it this way in 1883, It is time to realize that there will not be found any more cruelty, tyranny, and superstition in the résumé in past Spanish history than in the corresponding résumé of Anglo-Norman history.As shown above, there is no basis in fact regarding todays nasty, negative view of the Spanish language in the U.S. political rhetoric field. As they gain strength in numbers, Spanish Mexican-descent students deserve a more positive picture of their heritage in the classroom. If they are taught that the U.S. Northeast is favorably known as New England, then their teachers should also teach them that the Southwest is New Spain.\n\nIn closing, authoritative writers consider human historical events as common property belonging to all mankind. So it must be for the Spanish influence in U.S. history. As to its importance, the narrative has for too long been written by unfriendly hands. Clearly, its time for fairness and balance  time for belated recognition.\n\nThe year 2019 marks the 500th anniversary of the arrival of our Spanish ancestors on the Texas coast in 1519. All Spanish Mexican-descent citizens must unite in calling for celebration from Texas to California! Theres no better time to do the right thing for the right reasons. ¡Viva América Española!About the Author: José Joe Antonio López was born and raised in Laredo, Texas, and is a USAF Veteran.

The sign has been there for 9 yearsas long as Ive been at the University. The sign reminds me of a line by William Shakespeare: That one may smile and smile and be a villain [still]. This is a line from one of Hamlets soliloquys in the play (Act 1, Scene 5) where Hamlet is struggling with the incredulity of his mother Gertrude marrying Claudius her deceased husbands brother so soon after her husbands death. Despite Claudiuss benign behavior toward him, Hamlet knows him to be a villain feigning sincerity since his fathers ghost (spirit) told him it was his brother Claudius who poisoned him while sleeping in his garden (see Ortego, 1966).\n\nIt occurs to me that in the general populace there are those who smile and smile at American Hispanics projecting concern and sympathy for their plight but who in reality harbor malevolence toward them as Ive chronicled in the first three series of La Leyenda Negra (Somos Primos, 2009-2013). From the looks of things I doubt that anti-Hispanic sentiments can be dam-pened any time soon. This doesnt mean we should stop trying.\n\nThe current anti-Hispanic brouhaha in the United States stems from the immigration rhetoric raging in the public square exacerbated by dire Congressional alarm that the U.S.-Mexico border is broken and that a wall or fence will mend it and take care of the problem. Easier said than done! The question here is why is the focus of illegal (undocumented) immigration on the U.S.-Mexico border and not on the U.S.-Canadian border or the non-border points of entry into the United States along the nations shoreline? Why is it that some groups can gain entry to the United States and access to citizenship by simply setting foot on American soil or by pleading for asylum? Need I explain? Well, heres part of the answer.\n\nThe immigration issue has become a bȇte noire for the proponents of America for Americans, Catonists (Xenophobes) who fear the incursion of foreigners into the country who are not like themselves. Coupled to this is racism based on colorwhich pretty much includes all those who are not whiteas Comte de Gobineau (1816-1882) expostulated in his theory of racism and the inequality of the human races.\n\nA solution to the immigration problem vis-à-vis Hispanics generally and Mexicans specifically was to round them up and ship them back to their country of origin. This scenario was played out in the United States in the 1930s under the rubric of repatriation when the U.S. Immigration Service carried out a wholesale national effort to diminish the Hispanic (read Mexican) presence in the United States by rounding up Mexicans (including Mexican Americans despite the 14th Amendment). Repatriation was undertaken because of the swollen number of Mexicans who came north from Mexico between 1910 and 1930 to escape the Mexican civil war and the destabilization of the Mexican economy and propitiously to fill the need for agricultural workers to pick the fruit and vegetable crops of the United States.\n\nIn the 20th century until World War II the U.S.-Mexico relationship was a push-pull affair. When the U.S. needed workers, it pulled them from Mexico; when it no longer needed them, the U.S. pushed them back to Mexico. Because of the need for field workers during World War II, in 1942 the U.S. struck a deal with Mexico for Mexican braceros (hands) to pick American crops that would otherwise rot in the field. This 20-year arrangement (1942-1962) brought almost a million Mexican workers to the United States.\n\nIn all, the 3 million Mexicans who were part of the Mexican Cession of 1848 and the Gadsden Purchase of 1854, the million-and-a-half Mexicans of the exodus north from Mexico between 1910 and 1930, and the million or so Mexican braceros from 1942 to 1962 became the core population of Mexican Americans. Important to note is that Mexican American are essentially a territorial minority and their growth as a demographic entity is due principally from fertility and motility than immigration.\n\nDespite this history Mexican Americans have been treated like strangers in their own land. By 2014 attacks against American Hispanic communities more than tripled (http://www.The daily beast.com/articles/2014/02/20/hate-crime-victimization-statistics-show-rise-in-anti-hispa- nic-crime.html). Mexicans comprise the single largest component of the Immigration Court caseload.\n\nConsistent with theories of modern racism . . . white, non-Hispanic Americans have adopted a coded, race-neutral means of expressing prejudice toward Hispanic immigrants by citing specific behaviors that are deemed inappropriateeither because they are illegal or threatening in an economic or cultural manner. (Hartman, Newman, Bell, 2013)\n\nAnti-Hispanic Hate Crime Incidents\n\nFor many non-Latino Americans, the words Latino and illegal immigrant are one and the same. A new poll released by the National Hispanic Media Coalition and Latino Decisions finds over 30 percent of non-Hispanics believe a majority (over half) of Hispanics are undocumented. However, the actual figure of undocumented Hispanics in the U.S. is around 18 percent, and only 37 percent of U.S. Hispanics are actually immigrants, per the Pew Hispanic Center (Lilley, 22012).\n\nAccording to Alex Nogales, National Hispanic Media Coalition, The media is doing a disservice with coverage that is misleading the public about Latinos who live in the U.S. (Ibid). The increase in violence against American Hispanics correlates closely with the increasingly heated debate over Comprehensive Immigration Reform and an escalation in the level of anti-immigrant vitriol on radio, television, and the Internet (Ortego, 2013).\n\nNational Latino groups say Donald Trump's \"bigoted\" and \"hateful anti-immigrant rhetoric\" is creating a backlash against Hispanics. In Boston, a 58-year-old Mexican national was beaten with a metal pole by two brothers who urinated on him and who told troopers afterwards they were inspired, at least in part, by Trump. A police report about the incident quoted one of the brothers as saying: Donald Trump was right, all these illegals need to be deported.\" According to Roger C. Rocha, Jr., president of the League of United Latin American Citizens, Its obvious that Trumps vision of making America great does not include Latinos (Lienas, 2015).\n\nOn Long Island, New York on November 8, 2008, Marcelo Lucero, a 37 year-old Ecuadorian real estate agent, was beaten and fatally stabbed by seven teenagers who were driving around to \"go find some Mexicans to f up.\" The teens spotted Lucero and a friend, then proceeded \"[l]ike a lynch mob...got out of their car and surrounded Mr. Lucero,\" beating and stabbing him, according to the local prosecutor. The teenagers, all 17 and 16 years old, were charged with felony gang assault. One of them was also charged with manslaughter as a hate crime. Steve Levy, the County Executive of Suffolk County, where the murder occurred, has frequently and forcefully spoken out against immigrants, including on Lou Dobbs Tonight.\n\nEditorial, \"A Death in Patchogue,\" The New York Times, November 10, 2008\n\nIn Brooklyn, New York, on December 7, 2008, Jose Osvaldo Sucuzhañay, a 31 year-old Ecuadorian and father of two, was walking home from a bar and a church party with his brother, their arms around each other, as is common among men in many Latino cultures. Three men drove up to the brothers yelling anti-gay and anti-Hispanic slurs. While his brother escaped, Sucuzhañay, who ran a local real estate agency and had lived in New York for a decade, was struck on the head by a beer bottle and fell to the ground. Another attacker beat his head with an aluminum baseball bat. The three attackers continued kicking and punching him. Suffering severe head fractures and extensive brain damage, he died two days later.33 Keith Phoenix, 28, and Hakim Scott, 25, were indicted on March 3, 2009. The two men were charged with second-degree murder, manslaughter and assault, all as hate crimes, and could face 78 years to life in prison. Both men claim that they are not guilty.\n\nKareem Fahim, \"2 Indicted in Fatal Beating of Ecuadorian Immigrant,\"\n\nThe New York Times, March 3, 2009.\n\nOn the night of May 30, 2009, posing as U.S. Marshals the marauders led by Shawna Forde, head of Minutemen American Defense (MAD), and two of her white-supremacist vigilante cohorts, Jason Bush and Albert Gaxiola, shot and killed Raul Flores and his 9 year old daughter Brisenia, wounding Flores wife after busting into the Flores home. The story is that as a known drug dealer, Flores was fair game for robbery. The Forde gang was charged with two counts of first-degree murder and one count of attempted murder. All were represented by the Pima County public defenders office. Ignoring the racist motivation of the home invasion, a spokesman for the Pima County Sheriffs Office attributes the raid to cash and drugs.\n\nIn a subsequent report, the Center for American Progress Action Fund (CAPAF) warned precisely about this kind of anti-immigrant extremism, linking the vitriolic rhetoric to the growing number of hate crimes against Latinos and perceived immigrants (Shakir, et al, June 19, 2009). From 2004 to 2007 hate crimes against Latinos rose by more than 40 percent. In 2008-2009 the number of hate crimes against Latinos rose from 426 to 595 incidents. Shawna Forde was reported to have declared We will not stop until we get the results that we need to have.\n\nMAD has ties to extremist groups like Aryan Nation and the Federation for American Immigration Reform (FAIR). From 2008-2009 Forde was Border Director for Jim Gilchrists Minuteman Civil Defense Corps. Gilchrist has appeared regularly on Fox News Glenn Beck and Hannity & Colmes shows and CNNs Lou Dobbs Tonight (Ortego, 2007).\n\nThere's no doubt that the tone of the raging national debate over immigration is growing uglier by the day. Hispanics have become the whipping boy for the rise of bigotry many Americans thought had been quashed by the gains of the Civil Rights Movement. Words are not without consequences, as the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in its Chaplinsky v. New Hampshire decision (1942). Although the Court seemingly curtailed the fighting-words doctrine in later decisions, it has never overruled the Chaplinsky decision, so it remains in effect.\n\nNo matter how much we may emphasize that sticks and stones may break our bones but words can never hurt us. Oftentimes, words can be like steel darts, piercing, and wounding us deeply and as severely as sticks and stones. An ancient bromide cautions us that there are two sides to every story. Immigration reform in the United States is a cautionary undertaking with two sides: the rhetoric and the reality.\n\nBackpedalling on the story, Arivaca residents are touting their live and let live philosophy and characterizing themselves as a community that watches out for each other. That being true then the Arivaca murders are indeed a failure of the community. But the failure is not Arivacas alone. The Arivaca murders are a failure of the state to curb the rhetoric of hate that permeates much of the public discourse on immigration in Arizona. Actually, the rhetoric of hate permeates much of the public discourse on immigration across the country.\n\nCan the rhetoric of hate prompt murder? Of course! Unequivocally. The murders of Raul Flores and his 9 year-old daughter Brisenia were prompted by the rhetoric of hate associated with the Black Legend. Jason Bush may have pulled the trigger but the rhetoric of hate gave him 007 license to kill Raul and Brisenia Flores. How is that? Because the rhetoric of hate fatwalizes the victims, putting them beyond the pale of judicial protection. This was the case in the murder of Marcelo Lucero, an Ecuadorian immigrant in Long Island, New York, on November 8, 2008, by white teenagers hunting for beaners (Mexicans).\n\nAccording to the National Institute for Latino Policy, in its 41 year history, Saturday Night LIve has had only two Latino cast members, Horatio Sanz and Fred Armisen. And in its 789 episodes has featured only 12 Latino guest hosts. Latino hosts comprise 1.5 percent of the total (Romero, October 14, 2015).\n\nThe future for Hispanics in the United States looks grim but not insurmountable.\n\nReferences\n\nHartman, Todd K., Newman, Benjamin J.

To her adopted parents, shes a loving if reclusive 13-year-old girl. But Leticia has a secret: while her parents think shes in her room, Leticia is actually roaming the streets of New York in search of evildoers to demolish.\n\nLAK6, Leticias alter ego, is the latest superhero to be introduced by Darryl Makes Comics, the independent publishing house created in 2013 by hip-hop legend Darryl DMC McDaniels and art director Edgardo Miranda-Rodriguez. Along with other famed graffiti artists and writers, Darryl Makes Comics is creating a universe that speaks to a generation of children of color raised on hip-hop culture.\n\nRecently I spoke with Miranda-Rodriguez, editor-in-chief of Darryl Makes Comics, about their newest heroine and the confluence of hip hop and comics in communities of color.\n\nhttp://www.latinorebels.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Edgardo-Miranda-Rodriquez.jpg\n\nEdgardo Miranda-Rodriguez, art director and editor-in-chief at Darryl Makes Comics\n\nLETICIA LEBRON appeared briefly in last years DMC #1 as a brooding student who describes the title superhero as useless in the face of a criminal justice system designed to profit off the poor and minority groups. Did you know she would appear later issues as a heroine in her own right when that scene was being put together? How did you decide that Leticia would be the main heroine of DMC #1.5?\n\nWhen we set out to make our inaugural graphic novel, we focused our energy on creating a universe that reflected a New York that was familiar to all of us. I initially had the idea of a city that looked like it was set in the 1980s because of the grittiness of the streets and the wildstyle graffiti everywhere. I was personally acquainted with many graffiti artists so I wanted them to be part of a comic book, which was never done before. I also knew that were we to create an alternate universe in which Darryl McDaniels never picked up a microphone or became part of Run DMC, it needed to be set in the 1980s to parallel the height of his music career. In this world he graduated from St. Johns University and went on to get his M.A. and became a teacher.\n\nI used to teach high school in the early 1990s at Brooklyns El Puente. As an art teacher, I introduced many of my students to hip-hop culture via lessons that embraced the entire culture of graffiti, DJing, emceeing and b-boying (breaking). Many artists came to El Puente via my class, like Crazy Legs of the Rock Steady Crew a master class, Alan Ket who designed sets with students, Rob Raida who gave students a DJing demo in one of my classes, and Q-Tip who moderated a talk and free-styled with students. The classroom for me was a space where knowledge was shared from the facilitator (teacher) to the student and back again.\n\nFor DMC #1, the students in the classrooms needed to reflect the savviness of growing up in Nueva York. A student like Leticia Lebron was very real for me. Shed not only be street smart, but would also take it upon herself to educate herself on what affects her and her peers as an adolescent. We wanted all of our characters for that book to have substance and depth. As a character, DMC was a legend that needed to be brought to life by characters who themselves had interesting personalities. DMC has been quoted many times saying that his goal has always been to expand the universe and introduce more characters. He was using himself and notoriety to open doors in this fictional world similar to how he did in the real world (he brought Public Enemy to Def Jam).\n\nWe didnt create DMC #1 with a deliberate plan to develop our characters, but it happened for us organically. These characters spoke to us. Leticia spoke the loudest. She wanted her own adventure, to step up. It felt right to give her the first try. The three of us I remember sat in that meeting staring at each other and excited about giving LAK6 her own book. I was then charged with the responsibility of putting together the team to do it.\n\nI did an extensive search for talent and found Tula Lotay from England to work with me to design LAK6s costume. It needed for me to look like a b-girl and graffiti writer. I spoke with Lady Pink about her design as well, who emphasized that she shouldnt look to girly, but rather badass. I also wanted to keep her young, at 13, so that she would be drawn as a young woman. Next I brought in writer Amy Chu who first came to New York in the 1980s as a college student. Coincidentally she did a paper on Lady Pink at this time, so it was destined that she pen the script based on the short story I had come up with. I went on Instagram and the internet to find our books illustrator and was introduced to the work of Allison Smith who had just recently crowd sourced funds for her first graphic novel Temujin, an illustrated book about Genghis Khan. DMC #1.5 would be Allisons debut in comic books. I went back to Lady Pink who provided all the original graffiti for the book, and brought in my friend Kristin Sorra to digitally color all of the art.\n\nhttp://www.latinorebels.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/LAK6-DMC.png\n\nOf course Miles Morales, whos half black and half Puerto Rican, replaced Peter Parker as Spider-Man in 2011. As for Latina superheroes, I cant really think of any off the top of my head. Are there any you can think of, and how does LAK6s portrayal differ from depictions of Latinas in the past?\n\nThere are a few Latina superheroes from Marvel that Im aware of like the White Tiger, based on Marvels first Puerto Rican superhero of the same name created by Marv Wolfman and George Perez. In addition, a team very close to me are The Santerians created by Joe Quesada based on the orishas who were the stars of my first art exhibition with Marvel at the Caribbean Cultural Center here in New York.\n\nLAK6 is a unique character in that she represents an amalgamation of cultures and a composite of real life women. She represented graffiti, b-girls and wing chun. Lady Pink and my madrina Iris Morales of the Young Lords were for me inspirations for LAK6, so she needed to come across as a badass. Shes also a foster child being raised by a couple in Chelsea, a neighborhood in New York that was once very much a Puerto Rican community. I purposefully picked this neighborhood to remind people of what the city was before all of the development and gentrification. If we dont tell our stories, no one will.\n\nYou and Darryl DMC McDaniels are self-described nerds who spent their formative years reading comic books during the 1980s golden age of hip hop  something DMC senior editor Riggo Riggs Morales termed b-boy geeks. (Judging by his works, author Junot Díaz would probably place himself in that category as well.) How would you describe a b-boy geek?\n\nJunot Díaz is a personal friend, and he and I have geeked out over comics and sci-fi for over 20 years of our friendship. He personally told me that for his book The Brief and Wondrous Life of Oscar Wao he drew direct inspiration from the Fantastic Four. Beli is the Invisible Woman, Yunior is the Human Torch, Dr. Abelard is Reed Richards and Oscar himself is the Thing. Junot and I would also go on and on about hip hop, from Wu Tang to Nas. Hes definitely a #BBoyGeek. To me, thats a person grounded equally in all that is nerdy like comic books, sci-fi and fantasty to all that is cool like hip hop. For me its easy to love both because they are both rooted in escapism and role playing.\n\nI was born in 1984, which may explain why I was less into superhero comics as a kid and more into superhero shows that exploded in the latter half of the Eighties, such as X-Men, Spider-Man, The Incredible Hulk, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles and Ghostbusters. Nonetheless, why do you think these characters and their stories are so popular with kids, specifically black and Latino kids often from working-class families?\n\nSuperheroes speak to all cultures generation after generation. Its our mythology. Its our novelas.\n\nhttp://www.latinorebels.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Leticia-Lebron-LAK61.jpg\n\nSent by Latino Rebels\n\nLatino issues, as they are presented in the media and in our communities, have more or less calcified and threaten to become parody. When a Latino celebrity or media personality is asked onto a show, what do they speak about? Immigration. No matter which country you come from in Latin America, your issues are eventually whittled away until they can fit into the putrid-smelling box that is immigration. Even attempts to decrease stereotypes of Latinos in the arts by showing us as coming from all walks of life, those journeys are inevitably tied to achieving the American Dream and fulfill the promise of the immigration that brought us here.\n\nNo matter what we do, we cannot escape the subject of us being foreigners. Here, and yet not here. The modern Latino movement is predominantly driven not just by our outsider status but by our obnoxiously overwhelming desire to no longer be outsiders. In the immigration debate, no matter which group is being talked about, the assertion that these people are or want to be Americans  that they love this country, its values, its people and its freedoms  is touted before anyone who will listen. Yet at the same time, Latino activists are the first to tout the great things about Latino culture, like the food, the music, the fashions and the art. Just not the language.\n\nI dont mean Spanglish. I mean straight-up Spanish. To be fluent and celebrating the beauty and the fact that what binds together this region of 21 countries is that, in spite of their myriad differences, Latinos can all understand one another, is brushed aside. What has been prevalent recently have been videos which showcase the growing community of Latinos who choose not to learn Spanish for one reason or another (and it is a choice) but are frustrated by the expectation of Latinos and whites alike for them to know the language.\n\nSpanish, and ones proficiency in it, is being seen by a whole generation as a burden, a wall that prevents them from being fully accepted by the society they grew up in. Spanglish was the happy medium, where we could celebrate both sides of our culture. To utilize Spanglish was viewed as a method for empowerment, but for many young Latinos and Latino activists, Spanish is anathema.\n\nYet to promote ones latinidad is to promote the culture itself, and culture is intimately tied to the language in which it is communicated. And dont start with me about how Spanish was a colonial language forced upon natives and so you dont want to learn it because its the language of your oppressors. Is English any better in terms of colonialism and Native American genocide? Why speak English but not Spanish? Why embrace Latino values, culture and traditions, but not the language associated with it? Why arent Latino activists promoting bilingualism and trying to push the United States to promote multilingualism in the education system and greater tolerance of minority languages?\n\nWell, it has something to do with articles like this.\n\nQuite simply, native Spanish speakers are to blame for U.S.-born Latinos not learning or championing the language of their people. While some might argue that assimilation is inevitable in immigrant communities, what about peoples who are officially stateless in a hostile country, like the Kurds, the Basques or, until 1948, the Jews? Those groups have made preservation of their language central to the cohesiveness and survival of their race. The Jews did it for almost 2,000 years, and the Kurds and Basques have been doing it for hundreds of years. So why cant Latino immigrants keep their language alive for more than a generation?\n\nWell, it doesnt help that pretty much every Latino has a story similar to this one:\n\nGrowing up, my dad wanted only English spoken around the house. Him and my mom believed you couldnt teach children two languages at the same time, and even though my mom tried to teach us some things here or there, they never really stuck. My cousins on the island would make fun of me, say I wasnt really Puerto Rican because I didnt speak Spanish. Whenever I met a Spanish speaker, they would shame me for not speaking the language and ask why my parents didnt teach me. When I did attempt to speak, and Id make a mistake, I would be either made fun of or the person would switch to English. Whenever I spoke and did not make a mistake, I would be told I did not speak Spanish correctly or that I had no accent. Eventually, I had a big inferiority complex about speaking the language that I never got over.\n\nStatue of 17th-century author Mig\n\nI recently asked Yo Soy Latina author Linda Nieves-Powell about the subject, and here is what she had to say:\n\nI think because if you are a Latino who chooses to speak English, their perception is that you are selling out or you are not to be trusted because you are not a true Latino because of course, real Latinos speak Spanish. Lol. I have to tell you that even when I tell people I understand it but dont speak it, they continue to push the issue.\n\nThats right, native speakers: you all are assholes.\n\nYou also have no one to blame but yourselves, and before you get too angry by my saying that, hear me out. If you leave your country for one with a different dominant language, and you raise your kids giving them hell over their use of your mother tongue, and you use it as a source of criticism and shame, while at the same time telling everyone how proud you are to\n\nWith the exception of the last sentence, the story is my own. I did have an inferiority complex, but I got over it and eventually became fluent. (But more on that later.)\n\nStatue of 17th-century author Miguel de Cervantes at the entrance of Spains National Library.

Lol. I have to tell you that even when I tell people I understand it but dont speak it, they continue to push the issue. Who is to blame?\n\nNo one is to blame but yourselves, and before you get too angry by my saying that, hear me out. If you leave your country for one with a different dominant language, and you raise your kids giving them hell over their use of your mother tongue, and you use it as a source of criticism and shame, while at the same time telling everyone how proud you are to be in this new country and that you are making a better life than what was in your old country, so inevitably you make the old country seem like a backward hell hole, and your kid grows up not caring for either your homeland or its language, your kid isnt to blame. You are.\n\nhttp://www.latinorebels.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Miguel-de-Cervantes.jpg\n\nThat is the contradiction at the heart of so many Latino identity crises and issues. How can we expect Latino unity when half our population makes us feel bad for not meeting a certain standard of latinidad? How can you expect people to carry on traditions and maintain the culture, when you all but tell them they have to abandon the old ways in order to fit in and achieve the American Dream? The behavior is beyond hypocritical, and it is the reason why when I see a video of a slam poet bashing the Spanish language and how she associates Spanish with all the bad things in her life, and the comment boards are praising her to high heaven and calling her brave (for what, I am not sure), I cannot help but feel sad. Sad for her. Sad for my community. Sad for all those people who praised her because at some point in their past, they were made to feel ashamed for the fact that their parents left their homeland. Worse of all, the people who made them feel ashamed were most likely their own parents.\n\nYou see, I love Spanish. It is an incredibly beautiful, lyrical, and profound language. Speaking more than one language is scientifically proven to increase brain functions and expand a persons learning abilities. Being multilingual allows a person to understand multiple perspectives, because built into every language is a worldview that is distinct and, when coupled with another culture, can better inform a person on why their dominant culture is the way it is. It also opens up job opportunities, travel opportunities and the opportunity to discover great literature, music and movies in the original languages.\n\nhttp://www.latinorebels.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Gabriel-Garcia-Marquez.jpg\n\nGabriel García Márquez, author of Cien años de soledad (thierry ehrmann/Flickr)\n\nAppreciating art is actually how I came to be fluent in Spanish. When I was 18 I read One Hundred Years of Solitude. It was the first novel I read by a Latino author, and while I had taken Spanish in high school, I never took it very seriously due to the aforementioned inferiority complex. Yet reading that classic novel made me determined to read Marquez in his original language. To read and understand his poetic narratives the way he meant for them to be read became an obsession of mine, and so when I became fluent and earned a degree in Spanish studies, it wasnt so I could impress my cousins or strangers, or even so I could go back to the island and communicate with everyone in our native tongue. No, it was so I could experience these wonderful artists as they had expressed themselves, rather than through the filter of a translator. As a result, for a while I read Spanish better than I spoke it, but once I met my wife and she encouraged me to speak more, I improved in that area as well. The negative connotations I had grown up with eventually faded away, and I came to see how integral Spanish is to being Puerto Rican.\n\nI dont want to make the mistake of my elders and use this moment to chastise you for understanding Spanish but not speaking it, or only knowing a few phrases, or none at all. Ive just demonstrated my first-hand knowledge of how wrong that is. Instead, I encourage native speakers, when you come across a Latino who isnt a fluent Spanish speaker, that you ask them about their interests and maybe recommend a musician, a filmmaker or a writer from their country of origin and inspire them to become a fan. Maybe they still wont learn the language, but they will create a positive relationship with the culture and, in turn, with Spanish as well. Preserving a culture requires cultivating appreciation, and that begins with our elders and native speakers dropping the shame tactics, dropping the arrogance and purity tests, and instead being a positive spokesperson for the beautiful Latino cultures who proudly express themselves in Spanish.\n\n***\n\nJonathan Marcantoni is a Puerto Rican novelist and co-owner of Aignos Publishing.

(Mel Melcon / Los Angeles Times) By S. Irene Virbila, Reporter, Dining and Drinking Wines\n\nNext time you're in downtown Los Angeles at Olvera Street and the historic El Pueblo complex, look up. A grapevine seems to float across the top of vendors' stalls, its tendrils creeping this way and that, leaves healthy and green. The canopy covers almost 400 square feet, filling available space like kudzu. Follow its labyrinthine path over the roof of the Avila Adobe and back down into the newly restored Avila Adobe courtyard. There are actually three grapevines, two there, and one in front of a storefront down the street, each with massive roots that are more like tree trunks.\n\nThese are vines that are possibly older than California itself.\n\nCity Archivist Mike Holland, a home winemaker, has had his eye on the vines for a while, curious about their origin and how old they might be. He's an avid history buff and shares his obsession with his friend Wes Hagen, a third generation Angeleno and consulting winemaker for J. Wilkes Wines in Santa Maria Valley.\n\nLast year Holland asked Hagen whom he could contact at UC Davis to get a DNA analysis done on the vines. He referred him to the Foundation Plant Services at UC Davis, which keeps a database of all plant material it analyzes. \"When I told the lab manager Jerry Dangl that I wanted to get an analysis of three vines on Olvera Street at the old Pueblo site, he offered to do the analysis at no cost,\" says Holland. They sent him a kit. He cut the leaves as requested and sent the whole thing off to the lab.\n\nThe results, when they came back three weeks later, were stunning. \"The three vines are identical to one another and they match what has become known as'Viña Madre.' This is the famous 'old Mission grape of California' growing at the San Gabriel Mission. We know from our analysis of samples from San Gabriel that this variety is a first-generation hybrid between a native Southern California grape (Vitis girdiana) and the European grape (Vitis vinifera) variety 'Mission,'\" Dangl wrote in an email. The latter was introduced by the Spanish missionaries in 1769.\n\nThink about it. Since the Avila Adobe dates from 1818, the vines could possibly be 150 years old  or more.\n\n\"This is a vine that produced fruit in Los Angeles before wines were commercially made in California,\" says Hagen. \"Before Napa. Before Sonoma. Before Monterey. Even before Santa Barbara. A vine that is older than the state of California itself. We're talking about the genesis of New World wine and a vine that represents a link to Junipero Serra, to the Mission era.\"\n\nOlvera Street grapevines\n\nMel Melcon / Los Angeles Times\n\nThe sun filters through a grapevine located at El Pueblo de Los Angeles.\n\nLos Angeles City Archivist Mike Holland is harvesting some of these grapes with plans to turn them into wine. Of course, it still hasn't been established exactly how old the vines actually are  or whether they were planted to make wine or to create a shady pergola. (The Mission grape is a particularly vigorous and leafy vine.) Because the genetic material is the same, we can assume that the vine cuttings originally came from Mission San Gabriel.\n\nOver the last several weekends, with the permission of El Pueblo director Chris Espinosa, Holland has been picking the grapes in the early morning before anyone is around. His plan is to make some wine. By last week he'd harvested just 10 pounds of grapes and should pick up a few more on his last pass this weekend. It's not much  and means that at most, he'll be able to produce less than a case. \"The rule of thumb is 18 pounds per gallon and I have barely a thumb's worth,\" says Holland.\n\nAfter a gentle pruning earlier in the year and the removal of a tree that had been blocking some light, the vines looked healthier and this year produced more grapes than before. Because the Avila Adobe is a historic site, Holland can't do anything to damage the integrity of the specific area. That means no trellising, and he can't use nails or hammers. He can't even tie down the vine. He can only suggest the vine grow in a certain way by slightly shifting a shoot in one direction or another with his hands  but the vine has its own mind.\n\n\"What is there is there and I have to adapt to what the vines are doing. In a normal vineyard system, you have your trellis, your spacing, your canopy management,\" he explains. \"Up there, it's literally a green carpet of leaves and tendrils with clusters here and there.\"\n\nThe only thing Holland did was to trim some leaves to give some clusters more light and air on his day off on Fridays. \"It's really like a rooftop vineyard.\"\n\nThis first batch of wine will be a test run. He wanted to keep it small and simple. \"I'll probably make it in my garage like I do my other wines,\" Holland says. But he's very curious to see what it will taste like. So is Hagen, who's standing by if Holland needs any advice. And also pestering him with questions via email about what style of wine he thinks he's going to make.\n\nSee the most-read stories in Life & Style this hour >>\n\nDry? Or something semi-sweet like the original communion wines? The Mission grape, which thrives in Southern California's warm weather, was used to make sweet sacramental wine and may not be suited to make a great table (dry) wine. That's yet another reason why wine production eventually moved north.\n\nSo far Holland is playing it close to his vest. He'll know by spring what he's got.\n\nBut for a twist of fate, says Hagen, who often gives talks on the history of wine, Southern California would have been the locus of commercial winemaking in California. In fact, the Frenchman Jean-Louis Vignes had a large-scale commercial winery as early as 1833 very close to the site of what is now Union Station. By the time California became a state in 1850, Los Angeles County had approximately 100 vineyards. And by 1860 was producing 162,980 gallons of wine, well over half of California's entire production of 246,518 gallons.\n\n\"Most people don't know that Los Angeles is the birthplace of commercial wine in the New World,\" says Hagen. \"Two things drove grape production north: Anaheim disease (later known as Pierce's disease) which decimated vineyards in the Los Angeles basin in the 1880s, and the Gold Rush. Without those two factors, Los Angeles would have been the predominant wine-producing region throughout the 19th century and into the 20th.\"\n\nThat didn't happen. But we still have a little piece of history right here on Olvera Street to celebrate. And maybe, just maybe, we'll have some wine from a vine that goes back to the very beginning of California wine.\n\nA timeline of wine in Los Angeles\n\nAs wine historian Thomas Pinney, author of the massive \"A History of Wine in America,\" has observed, \"For most of the 19th century, if you said California wine, you meant Los Angeles wine.\" Here is a timeline for the divine drink in the City of Angels.\n\n1771 Mission San Gabriel Arcángel is established by Father Junipero Serra, the fourth of the 21 Spanish missions in California.\n\n1778 The first vine cuttings are brought to the Alta California missions from, most likely, Baja California, and planted at mission San Juan Capistrano.\n\n1781 The new pueblo of Nuestra Señora de la Reina de Los Angeles on the bank of the Los Angeles River is founded by settlers from Sonora and Sinaloa who stopped at San Gabriel Mission and most likely brought vine cuttings from the mission with them.\n\n1782 The first Alta California vintage is made at Mission San Juan Capistrano.\n\nMid-1790s Sometime before 1799, José Maria Verdugo plants the first secular vineyard in all of California on his Rancho San Rafael north of the pueblo where downtown Glendale is today.\n\n1818 The Avila Adobe is built by prominent ranchero Francisco José Avila, who was mayor of Los Angeles in 1810. It remains the oldest standing residence in Los Angeles.\n\n1820s Mission San Gabriel's vineyards, of 147,000 to 163,000 vines, are the most extensive of all the missions up and down California.\n\n1833 Frenchman Jean-Louis Vignes establishes his winery El Aliso on the site of what is now Union Station. He plants Mission grapevines, but also sends to Bordeaux for cuttings of Cabernet Sauvignon and Sauvignon Blanc in an attempt to supersede the dominant Mission grapes. At about the same time, William Wolfskill establishes a vineyard at Alameda and 3rd Street.\n\n1840s Antonio Pelanconi, an Italian immigrant, starts the first winery on Olvera Street (originally called Calle de los Vignes or Vine Street and renamed in 1877). The Pelanconi house is the original winery building. Several other wineries were located within and near El Pueblo. What is now La Golondrina restaurant and El Paseo across the street were both once wineries.\n\n1848 Los Angeles winemakers begin shipping wines north to thirsty miners in the Gold Rush. But the demand from all the immigrants pouring into Northern California eventually means wine production moves north to the Sierra foothills and Napa and Sonoma.\n\n1850 California becomes the 31st state in the union. Los Angeles County has approximately 100 vineyards and wineries, 85 in the pueblo alone. In the same period, Northern California had a couple in Napa, two in Sonoma and a handful in the Santa Clara Valley around San Jose.\n\n1857 The demand for wines from Los Angeles is so high that vintners look for property elsewhere and establish huge plantings in Anaheim. Within 10 years, there are 47 wineries. By 1883, the total vineyard acreage in the Santa Ana River valley is estimated at 10,000.\n\n1858 Hungarian-born Agoston Haraszthy of Buena Vista winery in Sonoma writes a \"Report on Grapes and Wine in California.\" In it, he decries the dominance of the Mission grape and recommends blending. Haraszthy had imported and was growing 165 varieties of grapes at his Sonoma estate.\n\n1860 Wine production census shows a total of 246,518 gallons of wine produced in California, with Los Angeles producing 162,980 gallons of that, or well over half.\n\n1870 Los Angeles is producing 531,710 gallons of wine a year, making it effectively the center of wine in California.\n\n1882 Anaheim disease (later renamed Pierce's disease), is discovered in Anaheim and within a few years the insect-borne bacterial infection decimates vineyards in the Los Angeles basin. The blighted vineyards are later replanted with citrus groves.\n\n1917 Italian immigrant Santo Cambianica puts an old railroad boxcar on a tiny lot on Lamar Street and paints \"San Antonio Winery\" on its side. That's the beginning of the downtown Los Angeles winery that's still in operation today.\n\n1920 Prohibition is voted in, dealing California wineries a decisive blow. San Antonio Winery survived because founder Santo Cambianica had contracted with the Catholic Church to produce sacramental wine. During Prohibition, his output actually increased.\n\n1930 Olvera Street opens to the public as a Mexican Marketplace. It now receives over 2 million visitors a year.\n\nTo read more about the fascinating (and complicated) history of wine in our town, see the book \"Los Angeles Wine: A History From the Mission Era to the Present (The History Press, 2014)\" by Stuart Douglass Byles.

Reuther.\n\nThe trip itself was an adventure. We left the Cardine Center on a very old WWII bus donated to the MAAC Center by the Marines. It seems that old military buses were being donated to non-profit agencies at that time. Leaving San Diego and traveling to a place I had never been was exciting in itself. Going to the place where the grape strike began was invigorating, exciting, scary and emotional.\n\nMany of my friends from school were driving to Delano for the weekend but my mothers birthday was that Sunday and I had to be back in San Diego, thus the decision to travel on that very old bus instead of riding with friends. Our trip was a long one not because of the distance to Delano but because the bus kept overheating and we had to stop over and over again and wait for the bus to cool enough to continue our trip.\n\nAt the 50th anniversary celebration on Saturday, September 26, I learned for the first time that the bus driver was Carlos LeGerrette! I have told the story of that bus trip several times but did not remember that he was the driver. Standing at the Forty Acres with Carlos, Linda, Gloria and a group of students from Oakland the story was retold and that was when Carlos said he was the bus driver.\n\nThose of you who know Carlos are familiar with what I will refer to as his gift of gab. I recognize that others have another term for it. Carlos had talked his way into obtaining the bus which upon our return he would then deliver to the MAAC Center.\n\nWhen we finally arrived at the Forty Acres in 1969, we were able to attend the dedication of the Reuther building. We listened and watched as the Teatro Campasino, which was founded in 1965 on the Delano Grape Strike picket lines, performed. We listened to many speeches.\n\nI had two first experiences on that trip. During the blessing of the building, a very non-traditional communion was celebrated with wafers made from tortillas. Father Victor Salandini was one of the officiating priests. He would became known as the Tortilla Priest.\n\nI also met Cesar Chavez. I remember thinking that Cesar was such a quiet person. Because of his leadership role, I thought he would be louder and more boisterous. In my very short conversation with him I found a modest, quiet man. I remember telling him that my mother was also born in Yuma and thanked him for all he did for us.\n\nLast weekends trip would be different. Instead of a rickety non air-conditioned bus, we would drive up in the comfort of an SUV.\n\nMaria and Gloria\n\nThere was a small problem. We werent exactly sure the best way to get drive to Delano, however a friend told me I-5 to the 99 and follow the signs. I have a Tomme (GPS) but I like using it as a way to confirm that I am going in the right direction. The trip was uneventful as we drove along reading the names of places we had read about in books about La Huelga. Names like McFarland, where a cancer cluster linked to pesticide use emerged among children in that agricultural community, leading Chavez to declare a third grape boycott in 1984.\n\nAfter reaching our hotel and being directed to the best place to eat in Delano we were off to explore. As it turns out the best place was really not even average but the server did share directions to the Forty Acres. Gloria and I kept sharing stories from picket lines and other Chicano movement stories. That evening Gloria checked the UFW web site and we learned that the first 1000 checking in would receive a gift bag. That cinched it for us. We were determined to be one of the first 1000.\n\nUnknown to us the hotel was located less than 5 miles from the Forty Acres and we arrived there within a few minutes. The event was very well organized with volunteers directing us to parking, and with water, coffee and pan dulce available for everyone. There was a large white tent with hundreds of chairs, some booths with items to purchase or with information about such topics as health care. We signed in, picked up our gift bag and went off to find our seats. Gloria picked up coffee and we waited for the program to begin.\n\nThe atmosphere was festive, exciting and there was a very special warmth among the many guests. I carried a poster with the photo of the old bus from the 1969 trip and several people asked if they could take picture of it and of course I said yes. Sharing old memories and struggles was certainly part of the interaction among the many guests.\n\nTo our pleasure and surprise the program started within minutes of the ten oclock starting time. Among the first to enter the room were Mrs. Helen Chavez, Cesars widow, Kris Kristofferson, the singer, Dolores Huerta, cofounder of the UFW and Robert Kennedy Jr. Kris Kristofferson has been a longtime supporter of the farm workers. In 2012 he donated five concerts to advance the work of UFW. One of the concerts which I had the pleasure of attending was held in San Diego with the remaining four concerts being performed throughout California.\n\nDanny Valdez There were many speakers which could have eventually become boring, but on the contrary it was rewarding to hear about past struggles and the new accomplishments and gains. Danny Valdez was there representing the Treatro Campasino and provided musical entertainment through-out the program.\n\nThe first speaker was Paul Chavez, Cesars son and himself a keeper of the keys. Paul quoted his father saying his father believed ordinary people could do extraordinary things. Two members of the California Assembly spoke Rob Bonta, and Rudy Salas. Mr. Salas represents the lower Central Valley and is a supporter of social justice and public service.\n\nThe other Assembly speaker was Rob Bonta, the first Filipino American to be elected to the State legislature in the history of California. Mr. Bonta grew up in a trailer near the Cesar Chavez home. He witnessed firsthand the importance of collaboration between Filipino and Mexican American workers. He recently introduced a bill that the contributions of Filipino Americans be included when teaching California history.\n\nDolores Huerta was next on the program. Anyone who has ever heard Dolores speak knows how articulate and dynamic she can be. As the cofounder of the UFW she stood side by side with Cesar at meetings, negotiations, and every aspect of the farm workers movement. In 1988 while at a peaceful protest of then candidate George Bush she was severely beaten by a San Francisco Police Officer. She sued and won her case. She had to take a leave from the UFW to recuperate from her many injuries. After her recovery she spent a couple of years focusing on womens issues.\n\nAt this weekends event she took time to talk about the indignities women faced while working in the fields. I had always thought of not having a toilet available as embarrassing. However, listening to Dolores speak I realized she was right, it was an indignity. Dolores is not only the voice for the farm workers but the voice for women everywhere. She is a women of great dignity. If you are not aware of Dolores role and contributions I urge you to take time and read about her.\n\nCesar Chavez breakfast 2015  John Armington with Adriana and Eligh Segovia\n\nJudge John Armington spoke about how he grew up watching every aspect of the union activities. He remembers the owners turning off the gas, lights and water hoping to force the farm workers to return to the field. His father, Mariano Armington, was the president of the Filipino Community of Delano. It was Mariano who made the motion to call for a strike by the Agricultural Workers Organizing Committee on September 8, 1965 against the grape growers. Within two weeks they were joined by the National Farm Workers Association and the UFW was born.\n\nJohn grew up in Delano and spoke with great pride of the accomplishments of many of the sons and daughters of the farm workers. He shared the names of students that attended various colleges including Yale, Stanford and Harvard. John himself received a BA from the UCSD and a Masters from USC. In 1989 John received his American Jurisprudence award for legal research and appellate brief writing from Western State University.\n\nAfter his speech I went over to talk to him for a few minutes and to thank him for the kindness he had shown my niece and nephew when he spoke at the Cesar Chavez breakfast a few months ago. As we spoke he told me he was writing a book that will include the stories of the accomplishments of those young people who grew up in Delano. This book will no doubt help us better understand many of the events that took place in Delano as well as the successes that came from the second generation group of young people.\n\nArturo Rodriguez is the President of the United Farm Workers of America. Arturo was born in San Antonio Texas, the son of a school teacher and sheet metal worker. He attended and graduated from La Salle High school in 1967. In 1971 he graduated from St Marys University. He learned about Cesar Chavez from a priest who had been to a march in the Rio Grande Valley. As a college student he became active in the grape boycott.\n\nArturo Rodriguez, Dolores Huerta, Paul Chavez\n\nWhile working on his Master degree at the University of Michigan he organized support for the farm workers boycott. He first met Cesar in 1973. He worked at various positions within the UFW organization. In 1974 he married Linda Chavez, Cesars daughter. At this celebration Mr. Rodriquez spoke of the accomplishments that have been made by the UFW. The union has the highest paid tomato workers of any place in the country.\n\nThere are now many UFW members with full medical coverage and in some cases dental and vision benefits. The Robert Kennedy medical plan has become a regular part of their daily lives. The union offers life insurance to its members as well as discounts for many other services.\n\nThere are more effective, timely and consistent inspections of farms to enforce heat standards. They serve as a watchdog protecting members from physical abuse, or loss of wages abuse. The union has even worked to protect non-union members in their quest to improve the life of the farm worker. The UFW has worked with the White House to support the Presidents order to protect immigration reform.\n\nRobert Kennedy Junior represented his mother as well as his other family members. The Kennedy family has supported the UFW since the 1960s. Robert explained to the crowd that Mrs. Ethel Kennedy said that even under far different circumstances Robert Kennedy senior and Cesar would have been friends for the following reasons: Both men were small in physical stature; they were both devoted Catholics; and they both had a lot of children.\n\nIt was Cesar that Robert Kennedy first whispered to that he planned to run for president. According to Robert Jr. he had not shared this plan with his family. None of us will ever forget the horror the terrible night in Los Angeles when Kennedy was shot. Dolores Huerta was standing on the stage although not close enough to be injured but close enough to see everything that happened to her friend and supporter Robert Kennedy. Cesar was scheduled to be there but because he was so tired and was still weak from his fast he had gone home to rest.\n\nAt this point the names of striking workers, marchers, boycotters and full time staff members from1965-1970 were introduced. Unfortunately this part of the program was rather long and people seemed to lose interest. All of these folks not only deserve our attention but our gratitude for the many scarifies they made in those early years. A little known fact is that 95% of the strikers lost their car or their home in the early years of the strike.\n\nGloria, Robert Kennedy, Jr., Maria\n\nDiscouraged by the very long food line, Gloria and I made the decision not to eat lunch at the celebration. We decided to look for old friends. We soon ran into Natalie, Carlos and Linda Le Gerrettes granddaughter who was also looking for her grandparents.\n\nWe continued to explore and ran into Robert Kennedy Jr. patiently posing with everyone for pictures. Not to be left out Gloria and I followed the example of others and asked to pose with him for a picture.\n\nWe soon found Linda and Carlos. Linda introduced us to a group of students from the Oakland who have been involved in research at the Forty Acres. I shared my old bus poster with the students and that was when Carlos shared his bus story.\n\nHuelga Gas Station Cesars 1st fast\n\nThe place of Cesar Chavez first fast.\n\nGloria and I walked over to what had once been Huelga gas station, the first building constructed at the Forty Acres. It is now a museum. The walls are hung with pictures and posters. The room where Cesar spent his first fast is located here. There is a cross on the wall, a bed and a water pitcher.\n\nLike Cesar the room is very modest and yet you could imagine the history that was made in that building. We both agreed we were honored to have had the opportunity to be there and see everything. (Picture of the Bed where Cesar slept and of the garage from the front of the building) # 1499,1500 and 1501\n\nFrom there we drove the short distance to the Paolo Agbayani Village. Agbayani Village was a retirement community that had been named after a Filipino union member who had a heart attack and died on the picket line. Today this village is a historical landmark and a museum. Its original purpose was to provide a home for those men who worked in the fields and supported the strike. Gloria and I had the privilege of being the only two visitors at that moment. Our tour guide walked from room to room explaining many of the things we were viewing.\n\nAgbayani Village Community Kitchen\n\nThe Village has a community kitchen, dining room and a garden. The private rooms are separated by a bathroom and there was a total of 59 units. This is also where Cesar spent his time when he decided to once again fast in the summer of 1988.\n\nThis fast was not to protest for better salaries but to protest the use of the deadly pesticides. Cesar had a very strong belief that we had not done enough to protect the workers or children from the effects of pesticides.\n\nCesars last fast\n\nHe believed a fast would serve to focus on the dangerous of pesticides. Paul Chavez received a phone call from his mother telling him that his father was starting another fast. Once again his body would endure the abuse of a prolonged fasted.\n\nWe left the Agbayani Village and decided that Bakersfield would be our lunch/dinner stop. As we exited into Bakersfield we spotted a Sizzler and decide that would be our choice for dinner. We were just about done with our food when Gloria realized she did not have her cell phone. She walked out to the car to look for and returned within minutes. She explained that Helen Chavez and her daughter were also there having dinner. We walked over and asked for permission to take a picture with them. They were very kind and said yes. We exchanged pleasantries and thanked them for sharing Cesar with the public.\n\nHelen Huertas daughter, Maria Garcia, Helen Huerta, Gloria Serrano-Medina\n\nOur drive home was filled with beautiful memories of our very special day. The word incredible is often over used. Gloria and I agree that this weekends celebration was indeed incredible. The Forty Acres and the celebration was beyond any of our expectation. This experience will live in our hearts and memories for the rest of our lives.\n\nThere is a fitting post script to the celebration. On September 29, 2015 new EPA rules finally afforded farm workers nearly all of the same pesticide protections enjoyed by other US workers.\n\nBio\n\nMaria Garcia is a retired school principal and has been an activist in the Chicano movement since 1968. She is the recipient of the 2015 SOHO Cultural Heritage Award for her Neighborhood House series and was designated as one of six Women of the Year (2015) by State Senator Ben Hueso for her historical preservation of life in Logan Heights.\n\nSent by Dorinda Moreno\n\npueblosenmovimientonorte@gmail.com\n\nThe first Mora settlement was called San Antonio de lo de Mora and it lasted until 1833 when Plains Indians, mainly Comanches, drove the settlers out. Two years later, Governor Albino Perez created the Mora Land Grant which extended from today Mora, all the way to Wagon Mound. 76 individuals, most with families, colonized the area. The valley then consisted of two parts; El Valle de San Antonio, AKA El Valle de Arriba, the Upper Valley, which included Chacon, Cleveland and Holman, and El Valle de Santa Gertrudis, the lower part of the valley, including present day Mora. The town of Mora was a collection of neighborhoods such as El Alto, Juarez, Tramperos and even China Block, for reasons unknown. Other communities nearby would follow, such as Guadalupita, which is formally; Nuestra Senora de Guadalupita, LeDoux, which originally was San Jose, then changed to honor the Frenchman, Antoine LeDouxLlano del Coyote, AKA Rainsville and other communities well known to the locals of Mora.\n\nHispanic settlers occupied lands within the Mora Valley without legal title ever since Governor de Anza made peace with the Comanches in the late 18th century, opening up the east side of the Sangre de Cristo Mountains for settlement. However, Mora was formally founded as a farming community in 1835. The settlers came primarily from Las Trampas, but also from Picuris and Embudo. The 76 families each received a strip of land by grant of Governor Albino Perez. The valley, the river and the town took their name from the family name \"Mora\" of several of the settler families.\n\nIn 1843, there was a raid on the town by Texas freebooters under Colonel Charles A. Warfield claiming that people in Mora had purchased stolen beef from the Comanches. The Texans rode in and killed five men and took eighteen women and children captive as well as 75 horses. The men of the Mora Valley convened a posse, overtook the Texans, recovered their livestock and family members and sent them back to Texas on foot after some much due punishment. The Texans did not return.\n\nChapter 11 The Battles for Mora\n\nAt the time of the revolt at Taos, a similar action occurred in the village of Mora, NM. Following is the account of the battles at Mora;\n\nThe First Battle of Mora was part of the Taos Revolt and the Mexican-American War, between U.S. Army troops and the NM Militia. It took place in January 1847.\n\nThe rebellion began with the capture and subsequent execution of a group of eight American merchants traveling to Missouri by insurgents of the revolt of 1847. On 20 January 1847, Capt. Hendley learned of the Mora insurrection while in command of the grazing detachment along the Pecos River, and he took possession of Las Bagas (Las Vegas), with 250 men, where the insurgents were beginning to gather. On 22 Jan., Capt. Hendley learned that the insurgents had gathered a force of about two hundred men in Mora, where he headed with 80 of his men. The rest stayed behind in Las Bagas, (Las Vegas).\n\nOn 24 Jan., Capt. Hendley arrived in Mora and \"found a body of Mexicans under arms, prepared to defend the town. His men were attacked by the Mexicans who fired from the windows and loop-holes of their houses. While pursuing the rebels into an old fort, Capt. Hendley was shot and killed. The Americans then retired, lacking artillery.\n\nLieutenant Colonel Philip St. George Cooke, a member of the Army of the West, reported the battle thus:\n\nAt the handsome village of Mora, eighteen miles west of the present [as of 1878] Fort Union, eight Americans were murdered. January 22d, Capt. Hendley, Second Missouri Volunteers, marched there from Las Vegas on the 24th, with eighty men. He found it occupied by over one hundred and fifty men who he engaged, attempting to enter the town, who were supported by a sally. He then assaulted the town and penetrated from house to house, some of which were destroyed and into one end of their fort, where he was killed and several were wounded. Lieut. McKarney then expecting the return of from three hundred to five hundred men, who had left there that day, withdrew and marched back to Las Vegas with fifteen prisoners; he reported fifteen to twenty of the enemy slain.\n\nThe Americans returned for revenge in the Second Battle of Mora.\n\nThe Second Battle of Mora was a military engagement during the Taos Revolt of the Mexican-American War. Seeking revenge for the death of Capt. Hendley, Waldo, Noyes, Culver and others in the First Battle of Mora, Capt. Morin and his men destroyed the village on Feb. 1, with the insurgents fleeing into the mountains. The fate of the women and children of Mora was not reported. The dead bodies of the Americans were buried at Las Bagas (Las Vegas).\n\nOn February 1, approximately 200 United States troops led by Captain Jesse I. Morin returned to Mora armed with two howitzers and a raging commitment to avenge their fellow soldiers deaths. Israel R. Hendley was defeated and killed in the First Battle of Mora due to his lack of artillery and overwhelming enemy forces. The two forces of 200 men each were about the same strength of one company. The difference between the combatants was that the U.S. troops were well trained in military tactics and the use of weapons while the men of Mora were farmers, skilled in farming, ranching and occasional hunting of game for the table with limited armaments and ammunition. The Americans set up their artillery and began the battle with a short artillery barrage on the fort protecting Mora. The Americans then attacked and the New Mexicans quickly gave up, mainly due to the lack of ammunition. They were routed after the fort fell and a few minutes of skirmishing in the dirt streets of Mora. The majority of insurgents fled up and over the surrounding mountains, to other villages of northern New Mexico. Morin directed his men to pursue the fleeing New Mexicans and ordered the complete destruction of Mora, regardless of the disposition of the women and children.\n\nMorin's men burned the wheat fields that surrounded the town, which was unnecessary, while others chased after the New Mexicans through the Mora Valley. The women and children also fled to the mountains. They left because the burning of the town left no food or shelter. Captain Morin later justified his actions by stating that he fought the New Mexicans in such a manner in revenge for their killing of Captain Hendley at Mora just a week earlier. This battle marked the end of one campaign during the New Mexican revolt. No American casualties were reported and the Mexicans suffered several dead or wounded as well as seventeen men captured. Captain Jesse I. Morin would go on to fight the final engagement of the revolt at the Battle of Cienega Creek. The surviving New Mexican civilians returned to Mora later and rebuilt their town.\n\nIn 1847, after the Battle of Mora, Federal troops killed stragglers, looted and burned the town, the nearby ranches, and all the crops. The town was essentially destroyed and was rebuilt by the people who had fled at the news of artillery coming up the valley. After 1851 when Fort Union was established on the Santa Fe Trail, these same farmers had restored their crop fields and harvested enough for themselves and for sale to others. They sold their excess crops to the fort. A commendable example of survival and revival of a people.\n\nCeran St. Vrain settled in Mora in 1853 and built a grist mill and became a major supplier of flour, grain and fodder to Fort Union. At the peak in the 19th century there were five grist mills operating in Mora. The ruins of St. Vrains mill still sit one block north of Moras main street.\n\nThus ends this account of Moras bloody Battles, although surely there are other sides to this story which will probably never be heard as those participants in the battle are no longer living. Certainly, the people of Mora, descended from those farmers and ranchers of that time, who rose up in arms to defend their way of life, have their own versions of the events as told to them by their ancestors in quiet oral history. Please note that in this account, containing the actual statements made by the U.S. military officers and others, they refer to the citizens as Mexicans instead of Spanish people which is what they were. At the time, these Spanish people had been citizens of the Republic of Mexico and were therefore technically, Mexicans, however, the U.S. authorities made no distinction between the two., to them, they were all Mexicans in a derogatory sense of the word.\n\nAlthough this historical account of the battles of Mora and its people is sad enough in its outcome, the people of Mora would have yet another battle to endure, although thankfully not as bloody, but equally threatening in its attack on their ability to live peacefully, cultivating their fields and enjoying the fruits of their labor. The next battle would occur in the courts and their attackers would be even more skilled and merciless in the form of the most prominent lawyers of their time, Thomas E. Elkins and Thomas B. Catron, the masters at separating Spanish and Mexican Land Grants from their legal owners, using the legal system and a legal practice of lawful robbery called The Santa Fe Ring !\n\nChapter 12 The Third Invasion of Mora \n\nThe Taking of The Mora Land Grant\n\n(Portions of this account are from Wikipedia)\n\nOn 22 February 1916, the common lands of the Mora land grant were sold to \"The State Investment Company\" at the courthouse door in Mora. Without access to the grazing and timbering lands, many residents were forced to seek work outside Mora and left the lands of their ancestors.\n\nPerhaps those intrepid Mora citizens of 1847 who revolted against a new United States form of government were in fact correct in their belief that the new government would eventually take their lands and either starve them out or force them to leave their rightful lands in desperation. Indeed, it came to pass although not on a battlefield but inside the very courts that were supposed to protect their rights under the U.S. Constitution. Skillful lawyers, practicing methods developed in the New Mexico courts, solely for the purpose of taking lands from Spanish / Mexican citizens legally, within a band of lawyers, judges, bankers and others called The Santa Fe Ring, eventually succeed in doing just that. Like the predator that waits for his prey to become helpless before striking the death blow, so did lawyers like Elkins and Catron, wait out the desperate land owners until they could no longer afford to defend their rights in a corrupt court, finally give up their throats for the kill..! They were forced off their lands by Sheriffs Sale for failure to pay taxes or some other legal action that resulted in the same end forcing the poor Spanish land owner off his own land..!\n\nIn cases like the Sale of the Mora Land Grant, Elkins and Catron manipulated a series of sales of lands, whether they owned it or not, to an accomplice who soon sold it to another within the conspiratorial group for $1.00, and then to yet another, until the paperwork was so convoluted that the rightful owner could not afford to fight the old pea under the walnut shell trick and the land was soon taken from him legally. In a Land Grant where there were 76 people who had to be named in every legal action, it soon became almost impossible to find, notify and register every owner within the time allowed, so many tracts of land were declared abandoned or owner unable to be identified, and so those parcels were sold to the County, who put them up for sale at the Courthouse steps to the highest bidder, usually a member of the conspiratorial group..!\n\nThe Mora Land Grant became the Mora Land Grab in the courts and eventually, as in a shark feeding frenzy, the Land Grant owners were consumed by the greedy lawyers until today, the Grant is fragmented and some of the legal Spanish recipients of the Grant are nowhere to be found and what is left of the Grant is in the possession of some financial group set up specifically for this purpose. The American Dream at work in its finest fashion..! To be fair, there must by some families today, who somehow managed to keep their lands in their families possession.\n\nThe only thing that has not changed for the worse in Mora, is the awesome beauty of the Mora River Valley and the surrounding villages where Spanish people continue to live, work and maintain a wonderful relationship with each other. Although many family members have moved away to other places to make a living in this modern competitive world, they maintain a close kinship with each other. As one cousin from Mora told me, anymore, we mainly get together for weddings and funerals.\n\nMora is a place that has survived much and from conversations I have had with many of my cousins of Mora and the nearby communities, it will always be a place of great love and beauty, both of the land itself and the people who have lived the history of Mora It will never die..!\n\nLouis F. Serna\n\nAugust 2015\n\nSernabook@comcast.net\n\n505-933-3168\n\nIn recognition of the just concluded Hispanic Heritage Month I offer the story of an Hispanic family that pioneered the development of the city of Harlingen, Texas.\n\nThe illustrious Gutierrez family has a long history in South Texas. It began more than a century ago when Secundino Gutierrez, who was born July 1, 1850 ( another source says 1849) in Amozoc Puebla, Mexico, came north with his father Manuel. Secondino was 12 years old at the time. The move was precipitated by hardships endured by the family due to conditions of unrest prevailing in Mexico at the time. Manuel had suffered losses of horses and cattle and acts of vandalism which even included poisoning of the water for his stock.\n\nOnce settled in Brownsville the family operated a water supply business. This likely would have meant hauling settled water obtained from the river, a resaca, cistern, or a well on a cart holding a large barrel (pipa). The wagon (carreta) would have been pulled by either an ox, a mule, donkey, or horse, or even in some instances human labor. Because there was yet to be a city system domestic water supply, homes would need daily service to replenish water supplies for cooking, washing, cleaning, and drinking uses. Naturally for the latter the water required boiling to be safely consumed.\n\nSecundino moved on to northern Cameron County where he worked from 1862 to 1882 at different ranches. In the 1870s he was to find the love of his life, Guadalupe Loya Loya, later to be affectionately called Mama Lupita. They would be married in 1872 by the famed Oblate missionary, Father Pierre Yves Keralum, O.M.I. This reverend is best remembered for designing a number of churches in the Lower Rio Grande Valley. (This very year in November Father Keralum disappeared while traversing west of the current Delta Lake area. His remains were not discovered until 10 years later.) The sacrament of marriage took place on El Mameado Ranch which today would be located 2.7 miles north of FM 498 on extension FM 507 or east of present-day Lyford.\n\nThe couple settled on the La Jarita Ranch (now located on FM 1420 between Willimar and Santa Moniica). Here the couple began a large family. They had nine children. These were Manuel b. 1876, Prajeris, Felipa, Francisco 1881, Jose 1882, Petra 1884, Eugenio 1885, Guadalupe 1888, and Josefina 1889.\n\nThe year 1890 was to see a significant change for the family, for it was this year that the family moved to a new ranch  La India. Manuel Tatita, the father of Secundino, was to acquire the La Crucita Ranch with about 1,920 acres on September 9, 1882. This property incorporated what was once three separate ranches  La Crucita, El Gigante, and La India. La Crucita was the central ranch of the three.\n\nThis area had never been in a Spanish nor Mexican land grant. It initially belonged to the State of Texas and was surrounded by land mostly designated school land, however the land on which the ranch sat had once been awarded by the state to the Corpus Christi, San Diego and Rio Grande Narrow Gauge Railroad Company as an incentive to construct a railroad to the area. It encompassed parts of Tracts 39, 40, 293, 294, and 295. When no railroad came to pass the state reclaimed the land and sold it. In today's geography the ranch boundaries would be Dilworth Road on its east, the Arroyo Colorado on its south, Garrett Road on its north, and Altas Palmas Road on its west.\n\nThe southeast corner of the ranch had a historical connection. What is now Dilworth Road ran along the ranch's east side and led to a low water crossing of the arroyo and on to Turner Road leading to the Military Road. These unpaved trails provided a route to go to Brownsville. It was here, in June of 1864 during the Civil War that Confederate troops led by Col. John Salmon Rip Ford crossed the Paso de Gigante low water ford and went on to Las Rucias where they decisively defeated a Union force stationed there.\n\nSecundino and Lupita would enlarge their family while on the ranch. Born there were Juan Francisco (Frankie) in 1893, Virginia 1897, Eloisa 1899 and Francisca, who is thought to have died as a baby.\n\nIt was not a fortuitous time for the family to have successfully ranched. One of the many periodic droughts to affect Texas was in its birth. This drought had commenced in the late 1880s and deepened in the 1890s. The Lower Rio Grande Valley has had, in effect, 17 significant droughts in the period 1892-1992. The worst of this particular dry period in the LRGV ran from 1893 to 1902. By 1896 the grazing pastures ranched by the Gutierrez family had been totally denuded. Much of the cattle stock perished from starvation and lack of water.\n\nPortions of the ranch would have to be sold for the family to survive. Five sections nearly equal in east to west width would be sold over time. The east-most former Georgetown Railroad Tract 39 was acquired and platted by real estate baron F. Z. Bishop. Adjacent to it the G. S. Dorough tract was platted as the Leelands Subdivision and still later, in part, the Stuart Place Resubdivsion. Next to it the old Corpus Christi, San Diego and Rio Grande Narrow Gauge Railroad (CCSD&RGNGRR) Tract became the Dougherty & Paillet Subdivsion. The Dayton Moses Tract eventually transformed into the Stuart Place subdivision. And finally the west-most tract of the CCSD&RGNGRR became the Leelands Subdivision.\n\nIt was in 1904 that the railroad came to the Valley and Lon C. Hill moved to develop the vast land holdings that he had purchased. The Lon C. Hill Town and Improvement Company, and later the Harlingen Land and Water Company, would become the vehicle on which Hill would develop the town of Harlingen. Key to its success would be the major canal that Hill constructed for agricultural irrigation from the river to Harlingen and then beyond.\n\nPerhaps, with ideas of selling the ranch, it had been surveyed in 1896 according to available records. It was in the year 1905 that many of the Secundino (Papa) Gutierrez family moved to a homestead at 313 W. Van Buren, Harlingen. Some apparently continued on the ranch until as late as 1912. Secundino after selling the ranch closed his general store in that area and was first to commence a bakery on W. Van Buren then later open a dry goods and grocery store on W. Harrison. By 1909 son Jose is operating the store at 408W. Harrison Avenue. Secundino would have a long and fruitful life before dying in 1949.\n\nThe accomplishments of the many Gutierrez family descendants are much too numerous to elucidate here. I shall however note two especially outstanding ones.\n\nRosaura Guttierez was the daughter of Eugenio, one of Secundino's 13 children. Maria Rosaura Chachi Gutierrez was born in Harlingen on January 18, 1918. After being graduated from Harlingen High School in 1938, she started her vocational career with the Eagle Loan Company. Upon the establishment of the U.S. Cadet Nursing Program on July 1, 1943, Rosaura was accepted into this program. She then attended Saint Mary's University in Leavenworth, Kansas. Wanting to expand her horizons, she wished to join the World Health Organization (WHO) as a nurse. Her father however wanted her to complete some nursing time in Harlingen. Rosaura dutifully obliged and spent the year 1952 at the Valley Baptist Hospital. She then went to work with WHO where she served as a nursing consultant, developed nursing school curriculum for nursing schools in Mexico, Central & South America and various Caribbean Islands. Furthering her education she went on to receive a Bachelor's Degree from the Catholic University of America in Washington, D.C. and a Master's Degree in Public Health from Boston College. She subsequently traveled the world serving humanity in a number of third world countries. Retiring in Harlingen in 1981, Rosaura continued to contribute to the community\n\nwhile actively serving on the Cameron County Historical Commission and especially by initiating its student Art History contests. She was a stalwart in researching and maintaining records of the Gutierrez family history and genealogy. Lastly it is reflected that Rosaura was deeply religious and a faithful member of the Immaculate Heart of Mary Catholic Church, Harlingen's mother Catholic church.\n\nSecond Lieutenant George Gutierrez Jr. was the first-born grandson of Harlingen pioneer Eugenio and Sabas Gutierrez and the only son of Mr. and Mrs George Gutierrez Sr. His birth date was January 20, 1941. At the time of his birth his parents, George and Graciela, were living at 419 W. Van Buren Avenue. His father was employed by the Magnolia Beer Company. The younger Gutierrez was a Harlingen High School football star and student body leader.George Jr. was to be the first casualty of the Vietnam War for the City of Harlingen.\n\nGeorge was in the last high school class to use the old high school on 13th Street and the first to graduate from the new high school on Marshall Street. In his sophomore year he was elected president of the Pan American Student Forum. This was highly unusual in that the forum was composed primarily of juniors and seniors. George played both baseball and football for the Cardinals in the years 1958 and 1959. In the former year, as guard for the football team, he was on the Cardinal's District Champion- ship team. He also participated in the school's Slide Rule Club.\n\nGeorge was a cadet corps member while attending Texas A&M and after graduation continued on in the U.S. Army Reserve. His Bachelor of Science Degree from Texas A&M recognized him as a graduate Civil Engineer. He was employed as a civil engineer for the California Division of Highways, Los Angeles before joining the military in April 1965. While the war began in November 1955, U.S. involvement didn't escalate until after the Gulf of Tonkin incident in 1964. It was on June 8, 1965 that Second Lieutenant Gutierrez commenced his active duty after volunteering to become an Army UH1 Huey helicopter pilot. He was also qualified to fly utility and single rotor light cargo aircraft. The unit that Lt. Gutierrez took action with was the 197th Assault Helicopter Company, 145th Aviation Battalion (nicknamed Old Warriors and First in Vietnam), 12th Aviation Group.\n\nGeorge spent 14 weeks training to become a helicopter pilot at Fort Rucker, Alabama. He then spent two weeks with his family in Harlingen before going overseas.\n\nWithin one month of being assigned to duty in Vietnam, at age 24 on September 1, 1965 Lt. Gutierrez became a war casualty when the lead helicopter he was piloting crashed after an explosion due to hostile action, near Binh Duong, 25 miles southwest of Saigon in South Vietnam. Also to die in the helicopter crash were three American soldiers and a Vietnamese observer.\n\nThe mission of the helicopter (HU-1B tail number 63-08567) was to escort and provide cover for a road convoy. The crew had noticed suspicious activity east of the highway at Ben Cat and had approached to investigate the known VA area.\n\nThe lieutenant's body was recovered and returned to America. He was awarded numerous military honors including the Distinguished Flying Cross, the Bronze Star, and the Purple Heart.\n\nLt. Gutierrez was not married and left no heirs. Following a solemn service at the Immaculate Heart of Mary Catholic Church, of which George was a member, he was interred in Mont Meta Memorial Cemetery north of San Benito, Texas.\n\nOn October 15, 1980 Diaz Park at 500 W. Harrison Avenue between C and D Streets was renamed the Lt. George Gutierrez Park in honor of the Vietnam hero. The park's amenities on its two acres consist of picnic areas, benches, playground and bandstand.\n\nIt was on November 13, 1996 that the School Board named the new middle school at 3205 W. Wilson Road the Lt. George Gutierrez Jr. Middle School.\n\nThe following article is based on an oral presentation made at the Joseph and Susanna Dickinson Hannig Museum at Austin, Texas. The presenters were SAGHS First Families of Bexar County Honorees Dorothy M. Perez (#78) and her brother Rueben M. Perez (#79) discussing and honoring their ancestral family members who were present at the Battle of the Alamo.\n\nEdited and adapted by Larry Luckett\n\nWhen we were fifth graders in elementary school at San Antonio we had classes in Texas History. For a young person it was pretty exciting learning about Texas History and the Battle of the Alamo. However, we felt something was wrong, as the picture from the stories that we heard at home was different from what the teacher and the books were saying. We would accompany our mother, Adelina Casillas Carrola Perez, when she would pick up our father, George Newton Perez, from work at the Post Office directly across the street from the Alamo. He would always say, Over there is where your great great grandmother and great grandfather were during the Battle of the Alamo. Yet, that was not what we were hearing at school. There they would only talk about Susanna Dickinson and her daughter as survivors of the Alamo, and in passing mention there were also Mexican women and children. It was not until much later in life that we would come to know those other women and children of the Alamo and come to appreciate our heritage even more. One of those women is our great-great-grandmother, Juana Navarro Veramendi Peres Alsbury.1.\n\nAll together, there were six members of our extended family inside the Alamo: Juana Navarro, her baby Alejo E. Peres, her sister, Gertrudis, Juanas husband, Dr. Horace Alsbury (a messenger from the Alamo who was there earlier but not present when it fell, her brother in-law James Bowie, and her brother-in-law, Manual Peres, a soldier in the Mexican Army force attacking the Alamo. As we honor and tell the story of Juana, we must not forget the other brave women and children of the Alamo.From the little Villa of San Fernando and the Royal Presidio of San Antonio de Bexar, Province of Texas, the Republic of Mexico, the words Remember the Alamo were heard around the world. The call for independence was once again heard in Texas in 1836, as it had been earlier in Texas in connection to Mexicos struggle for independence from Spain. One of the largest battles that occurred on Texas soil was the Battle of Medina, south of San Antonio on 18 August 1813, when over 1,800 Spanish Royalist forces under Joaquin de Arredondo defeated the 1,500 rebels of the so-called Republican Army of the North led by Colonel Bernardo Gutierrez de Lara. With the exception of a few who escaped, those Republicans not killed on the battlefield were captured and returned to Bexar and executed at Military Plaza in San Antonio. The remaining bodies lay on the battlefield without a burial for nine years.\n\nMore lives were lost in this one battle than were lost during the entire struggle for Texas Independence some 23 years later.2Little is ever mentioned about the over 300 women who after the battle of Medina were rounded up in Bexar, accused of having relatives supporting the rebel cause. They were imprisoned, humiliated, and enslaved in La Quinta (the Curbelo house) for 54 days.3 Many suffered daily lashes, forced to work making tortillas for the soldiers while their children were in the streets begging for food. The price was steep for the women whose husbands were lost in the battle or were captured and executed. Many families fled and later had their homes confiscated for not being loyal to the Spanish Crown.\n\nTwenty-three years later, this scenario was to be repeated. Brave men and women would help forge the history of Texas at the Battle of the Alamo. We must tell their stories, become their voices, and remember their heroic efforts. Our brave patriots made supreme sacrifices during the trying and turbulent times in our states history. Many of our ancestors played an important role in the quest for Independence of Texas, from which we gained the freedom and opportunity that we still enjoy in our country today. Yet after 175 years, the brave women and children who survived the battle remain largely unknown, unsung, and unhonored. Those who fought and died at the Alamo have become legendary heroes, and the siege and battle of the Alamo mean many things to many peoplefor those of us who are direct descendants, that page in history becomes personally meaningful.\n\nDuring the first meeting of the Alamo Defenders Descendants Association in 1995, inside of the Alamo Chapel, the grandson of Alejo Perez, the youngest survivor and the last to die in 1918, stepped up to the podium to give the opening prayer.\n\nWith tears in his eyes, his voice quivering and unable to conclude the prayer, this person had been born just early enough to know as a child his grandfather, an Alamo survivor. The distance of time seemed suddenly much shorter, as there stood a person who knew someone who had been at the 1836 battle. It was as close as most of us would ever be to the people and the event. That person was our father, George Newton Perez.\n\nThere were women and children at the Alamo, a dozen or so of them. To this day, no one knows exactly just how many or who they all were. What we do know is that their lives were all changed.\n\nOn this special occasion, we honor a noted Tejana woman and Alamo survivor, Juana Navarro Veramendi Peres Alsbury. As we do, she will represent all of the brave women whose lives are a part of the rich heritage and history of our State.\n\nJuanas family came from afar, over the dusty trails of Texas, to carve a place in the history of San Antonio and Texas. Her father, José Ángel Navarro, was a lieutenant in the Spanish Army and in 1832 was a signer of the Bexar Remonstrance, a list of grievances from the Bexar government requesting the central government of Mexico to re-allow immigration from the United States and to separate Texas from Coahuila. He served as or (Mayor) of Bexar from 1821, when"
