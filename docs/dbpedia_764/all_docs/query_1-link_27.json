The houses, the streets, the square, the church. This was the great work to be carried out by all those who managed to reach those lands.\n\nSan Antonio de Texas was founded by 10 Canarian families (seven from Lanzarote and three from Gran Canaria, Tenerife and La Palma). In total, 55 people of which 43 were from Lanzarote.\n\nOn August 1, 1731, the following people, who would pass on to posterity, were organized as the first municipal government of Texas from those elected, all from the Canary Islands:\n\nJuan Leal Goraz . First councilor (Dean Councilor and first mayor of first vote)\n\nJuan Curbelo. Second councilor\n\nAntonio Santos. Third councilor\n\nSalvador Rodríguez. Fourth councilor\n\nManuel Ruiz Fifth councilor\n\nJuan Leal Alvarez . Sixth councilor\n\nFrancisco Arocha. Notary of the Public Council\n\nAntonio Rodríguez. Butler\n\nVicente Alvarez Travieso, Senior Constable\n\nOur park was born with the hope of honoring the people of Lanzarote who left Teguise on February 20, 1730 for the first time in their lives and embarked on a sloop to the island of Tenerife first, from there on March 15 of the same year to Havana in Cuba. Afterwards, they sailed to Veracruz in Mexico and begin by land in a caravan, enduring all kinds of suffering and hardship, a long journey to settle and found what we know today as San Antonio de Texas.\n\nThis tribute that we pay is worth it so that the value, effort, courage and all the hardships that the Canarian families who emigrated and created what was believed to be impossible at that time had to go through are not forgotten.\n\nWe quote an excerpt from the book “Crónicas canarias en Texas” by the writer Armando Curbelo Fuentes, which reflects the reason for our tribute. In this fragment, a Lanzarote native, María Curbelo Perdomo, in 1800, expresses her concern about the danger that the Canarian legacy was in the United States.\n\nHis words capture the spirit of what the islanders of the US and those here feel today:\n\n«(…) the city that the Canarian families founded with so much interest and effort, little by little is losing its original identity (…) this great Canarian work in America must pass to posterity (…) what they have done will be lost in time made the canaries and I (…) write this diary as a testimony of\n\nrecognition to my companions so that future generations, from here and there, truly know what we humble canaries who came from so far away to these lands of promise have done»\n\nIn this century the Canarian Archipelago suffers a spectacular emigration by its people to America.\n\nThe main contributor was the fact that from 1720 to 1730, especially in the year 21, one of the deepest agrarian crises in memory occurred, which made it necessary to allocate vineyard lands to the cultivation of cereals.\n\nThe antecedents of this important crisis can be found in the 17th century, and it was the consequence of the extensive specialization of the Canarian economy on wine.\n\nFrom 1620 to 1630, due to the approval of a regulation that prevented the trade of wine to its American colonies, the Canarian product had to look for other markets in the Portuguese colonies, but this solution did not last long because in 1640 the Portuguese Crown stopped belonging to Spain and, therefore, its colonies. Due to this event, relations deteriorate until this market closes.\n\nDespite the decline in the wine trade, it is possible to continue trading towards Europe through a single distribution channel through the English, but relations between Spain and England are unstable and the marketing of the product worsens even more.\n\nFrom 1684 to 1688 the progressive collapse of the market occurred, which was reduced to English control. Relations with England become complicated because the English begin to buy wine from Portugal and Madeira (much cheaper compared to Canarian wine that had a high price due to its quality) and a marketing period also ends with this market.\n\nDue to this situation, a subsistence economy based on cereal develops.\n\nThe situation is aggravated because poor harvests mean that production is not even enough to feed the population, so the Crown was forced to export 250,000 bushels of wheat duty-free. This situation is more serious in the eastern islands, Lanzarote and Fuerteventura, because they were specialized in a single product. Hunger and mortality force the population to emigrate, not only to America but also to other islands, especially Tenerife and Gran Canaria, aggravating the situation of these central islands as well.\n\nThe situation in the Canary Islands, as we have seen, was one of such hardship and famine that it evidently favored emigration, and many families found themselves involved in an adventure in which they left behind their birthplaces, lineage and land. In 1729, in a Royal Office Addressed to the judge of Commerce of the Indies in the Canary Islands, the King states his concern about a possible attack on Texas from French Louisiana .\n\nIn this way, it became necessary to send families to populate and maintain the province of Texas, which was one of the richest and most valuable in America due to the fertility and richness of the soil. At least 400 people should be sent to go by boat to Havana in groups of ten or eleven.\n\n• This Royal Office ordered that the will of Philip V be made known and those families who wanted to voluntarily go to Cuba be taken into consideration.\n\nUpon receiving it, the judge of Commerce of the Indies in the Canary Islands notifies its contents to all the Town Councils of the islands that would like to contribute families to populate the Indies.\n\n• The first to respond was the city council of Teguise, in Lanzarote, and it was Juan Leal Goraz , one of its councilors who would become the first president of the Cabildo of San Antonio, who encouraged seven of the ten families that were going to enlist. start a trip.\n\n• In total there were: seven families from Lanzarote, one from La Palma, one from Tenerife and one family and one bachelor from Gran Canaria. Although the initial condition was that only families would be sent, Antonio Rodríguez was allowed to board because his girlfriend was in the group and also because they would get married during the trip, which was the case.\n\nAlmost a year passed from the moment the Canarian families left Tenerife on March 27, 1730 until they arrived in San Antonio. We can divide this time between trips and stays into three stops or moments.\n\nFIRST STAGE . SANTA CRUZ DE TENERIFE – CUBA\n\nDon Bartolomé de Casabuena , the mayor of Trade with the Indies in the Canary Islands, ordered that the ship “Santísima Trinidad y Nuestra Señora del Rosario” be assigned for the trip from the port of Santa Cruz de Tenerife to Veracruz via Havana.\n\nFrom the remaining islands they arrived at Tenerife on the sloop “San Telmo”.\n\nOn March 3, the first visit was made to the ship to be loaded the next day with provisions and supplies for the trip. No family was lacking the corresponding bushels of gofio.\n\nThe departure to Havana took longer than expected due to rough seas and seeing enemy ships, so the families, not being prepared for such a long stay, even had to spend part of the food they brought for the trip.\n\nOn March 26, the ship was loaded with belongings and left on March 27, 1730.\n\nThey arrived in Havana on May 10 and were received by its governor. Here they stayed for a time, staying in a fortress adapted for this purpose. They are treated by a doctor and given clothing and food.\n\nDuring this stay they are joined by two Canarians who have lived in the city for a long time.\n\nOn July 9, the “Holy Trinity and Our Lady of the Rosary” heads to Veracruz.\n\nSECOND STAGE . VERACRUZ\n\nThis journey lasts 10 days due to the calm prevailing during the trip, 84 days having already passed since they left the port of Santa Cruz de Tenerife. In Veracruz they were received by the mayor on behalf of the viceroy of New Spain.\n\nThe viceroy Don Juan de Acuña, Marquis of Casa Fuerte, already knew of the arrival of the Canarian families through the Royal Dispatch of 1729, which ordered their transfer to the area of Texas advised by the forger, Marquis of San Miguel de Aguayo.\n\nFor this reason, he met with Brigadier Don Pedro Rivera, an expert in the northern and northeastern areas due to his many trips, and commissioned him to study Aguayo’s proposal to take the Canarian families by boat from Veracruz to the Bahía del Espíritu Santo.\n\nRivera’s negative response in this regard was quite clear and concise, since from his experience he knew that it was impossible to reach that place, much less survive.\n\nThe Brigadier then finds himself with a great dilemma: send all the families to the designated place with the consequent danger to their lives or not comply with the King’s order and expose himself to a possible judicial demand for responsibility.\n\nMeanwhile, oblivious to all this, the Canarian families remain in Veracruz for 13 more days.\n\nTHIRD STAGE. VERACRUZ – SAN ANTONIO\n\nIn the end, this journey did not turn out to be what they expected, which was initially to travel by boat. On the contrary, the viceroy, advised by Rivera, had decided that the trip would be made by land.\n\nOnce the decision was made to go by land, the mayor of Veracruz was ordered to make a guide, Francisco Duval, horses and also mules and carts available to the Canarians.\n\nCanarian families receive the news with concern, knowing the dangers and difficulties they could encounter: attack by Indians, passing through mountainous, rugged and inhospitable areas, etc. They would go from desert areas to high mountains, with cold and snow. To all these difficulties we must add the lack of skill of the Canarians when it came to bridling and harnessing horses and mules, which meant that a lot of time was lost in those areas.\n\nThe first objective was to reach Cuautitlán, a town northwest of Mexico City where they will be given clothing, tools and money. They passed through Texcoco and then Cholula to reach Cuautitlán on the afternoon of August 27, 1730, after 26 days.\n\nAfter everything they had been through, Cuautitlán was a paradise for them and, in addition, they received all kinds of attention from the mayor who provided them with food, housing and clothing during their stay.\n\nJuan Leal and guide Duval are appointed leaders of the group, responsible for solving any problems that may arise. But even though the route and the conditions for the trip were planned, after spending two and a half months in Cuautitlán, the Canarian families, who had experienced the difficulties of the road and heard what awaited them, insisted more and more frequently on staying.\n\nFinally, they left on November 15 to avoid desertions.\n\nThe route from here is as follows: Cuautitlán to Tepexi del Río, Ruano, San Juan del Río, Coyotillos Chicos, Amascala , Puerto Pinto, Carboneras, San Luis de la Paz, Sauceda de Los Mulatos, Valle de San Francisco, San Luís de Potosí, Las Bocas, La Diana, El Venado, Laguna Seca, Arroyo Seco, Matehuala, El Cedral, Pozo Nuevo, Aguadulce, Cieneguilla, Encarnación, Agua Nueva and El Saltillo.\n\nThey were not to deviate from the path, and always camp on the outskirts of the towns with their consent. A person would go in front who would anticipate the arrival of the families. The person who abandoned the caravan would be considered a deserter and, as such, would be persecuted and brought to justice.\n\nFrom El Saltillo to San Antonio the dangers increased as they entered Comanche territory, towards the northwest. The first attack surprised them at night when trying to cross the Rio Grande, but luckily no human life was lost.\n\nAfter going through several difficulties along the journey, they finally arrived in San Antonio at dawn on March 9, 1731, after more than eight months of caravan and almost a year since they left the port of Santa Cruz de Tenerife. The families settled in the houses of the prison soldiers in huts and carriages.\n\nThe captain of the prison had orders from the Viceroy to distribute the lands among the families by assigning them to lots, but it was not easy and many disputes arose, so it was decided to leave it for later and for the moment to plant together an area already cleared by the military and their families.\n\nThanks to the harvest they were able to survive on their own since royal aid had run out.\n\nAt the beginning of July, the streets begin to be laid out, for which stones and stakes are given to the families. The land is distributed in a flat area and the pasture areas are delimited. The city was located between the San Antonio River and the San Pedro Arroyo, and before the families arrived, five Franciscan missions already existed on the site. The closest was San Antonio Valero, which will be known to this day as El Álamo. Between this mission and the San Antonio prison was where the city was founded with a municipal government called Cabildo.\n\nAs we stated in other sections of this website, from this theme park we want to pay an emotional tribute to our island ancestors who founded San Antonio de Texas.\n\nThe following is a list of the fifty members of the fifteen families, plus four celibate men, who left Cuatlitlán on November 15, 1730 and who left for, at that time, San Fernando de Béxar to found San Antonio de Texas on the 1 August 1731.

Relations with England become complicated because the English begin to buy wine from Portugal and Madeira (much cheaper compared to Canarian wine that had a high price due to its quality) and a marketing period also ends with this market.\n\nDue to this situation, a subsistence economy based on cereal develops.\n\nThe situation is aggravated because poor harvests mean that production is not even enough to feed the population, so the Crown was forced to export 250,000 bushels of wheat duty-free. This situation is more serious in the eastern islands, Lanzarote and Fuerteventura, because they were specialized in a single product. Hunger and mortality force the population to emigrate, not only to America but also to other islands, especially Tenerife and Gran Canaria, aggravating the situation of these central islands as well.\n\nThe situation in the Canary Islands, as we have seen, was one of such hardship and famine that it evidently favored emigration, and many families found themselves involved in an adventure in which they left behind their birthplaces, lineage and land. In 1729, in a Royal Office Addressed to the judge of Commerce of the Indies in the Canary Islands, the King states his concern about a possible attack on Texas from French Louisiana .\n\nIn this way, it became necessary to send families to populate and maintain the province of Texas, which was one of the richest and most valuable in America due to the fertility and richness of the soil. At least 400 people should be sent to go by boat to Havana in groups of ten or eleven.\n\n• This Royal Office ordered that the will of Philip V be made known and those families who wanted to voluntarily go to Cuba be taken into consideration.\n\nUpon receiving it, the judge of Commerce of the Indies in the Canary Islands notifies its contents to all the Town Councils of the islands that would like to contribute families to populate the Indies.\n\n• The first to respond was the city council of Teguise, in Lanzarote, and it was Juan Leal Goraz , one of its councilors who would become the first president of the Cabildo of San Antonio, who encouraged seven of the ten families that were going to enlist. start a trip.\n\n• In total there were: seven families from Lanzarote, one from La Palma, one from Tenerife and one family and one bachelor from Gran Canaria. Although the initial condition was that only families would be sent, Antonio Rodríguez was allowed to board because his girlfriend was in the group and also because they would get married during the trip, which was the case.\n\nAlmost a year passed from the moment the Canarian families left Tenerife on March 27, 1730 until they arrived in San Antonio. We can divide this time between trips and stays into three stops or moments.\n\nFIRST STAGE . SANTA CRUZ DE TENERIFE – CUBA\n\nDon Bartolomé de Casabuena , the mayor of Trade with the Indies in the Canary Islands, ordered that the ship “Santísima Trinidad y Nuestra Señora del Rosario” be assigned for the trip from the port of Santa Cruz de Tenerife to Veracruz via Havana.\n\nFrom the remaining islands they arrived at Tenerife on the sloop “San Telmo”.\n\nOn March 3, the first visit was made to the ship to be loaded the next day with provisions and supplies for the trip. No family was lacking the corresponding bushels of gofio.\n\nThe departure to Havana took longer than expected due to rough seas and seeing enemy ships, so the families, not being prepared for such a long stay, even had to spend part of the food they brought for the trip.\n\nOn March 26, the ship was loaded with belongings and left on March 27, 1730.\n\nThey arrived in Havana on May 10 and were received by its governor. Here they stayed for a time, staying in a fortress adapted for this purpose. They are treated by a doctor and given clothing and food.\n\nDuring this stay they are joined by two Canarians who have lived in the city for a long time.\n\nOn July 9, the “Holy Trinity and Our Lady of the Rosary” heads to Veracruz.\n\nSECOND STAGE . VERACRUZ\n\nThis journey lasts 10 days due to the calm prevailing during the trip, 84 days having already passed since they left the port of Santa Cruz de Tenerife. In Veracruz they were received by the mayor on behalf of the viceroy of New Spain.\n\nThe viceroy Don Juan de Acuña, Marquis of Casa Fuerte, already knew of the arrival of the Canarian families through the Royal Dispatch of 1729, which ordered their transfer to the area of Texas advised by the forger, Marquis of San Miguel de Aguayo.\n\nFor this reason, he met with Brigadier Don Pedro Rivera, an expert in the northern and northeastern areas due to his many trips, and commissioned him to study Aguayo’s proposal to take the Canarian families by boat from Veracruz to the Bahía del Espíritu Santo.\n\nRivera’s negative response in this regard was quite clear and concise, since from his experience he knew that it was impossible to reach that place, much less survive.\n\nThe Brigadier then finds himself with a great dilemma: send all the families to the designated place with the consequent danger to their lives or not comply with the King’s order and expose himself to a possible judicial demand for responsibility.\n\nMeanwhile, oblivious to all this, the Canarian families remain in Veracruz for 13 more days.\n\nTHIRD STAGE. VERACRUZ – SAN ANTONIO\n\nIn the end, this journey did not turn out to be what they expected, which was initially to travel by boat. On the contrary, the viceroy, advised by Rivera, had decided that the trip would be made by land.\n\nOnce the decision was made to go by land, the mayor of Veracruz was ordered to make a guide, Francisco Duval, horses and also mules and carts available to the Canarians.\n\nCanarian families receive the news with concern, knowing the dangers and difficulties they could encounter: attack by Indians, passing through mountainous, rugged and inhospitable areas, etc. They would go from desert areas to high mountains, with cold and snow. To all these difficulties we must add the lack of skill of the Canarians when it came to bridling and harnessing horses and mules, which meant that a lot of time was lost in those areas.\n\nThe first objective was to reach Cuautitlán, a town northwest of Mexico City where they will be given clothing, tools and money. They passed through Texcoco and then Cholula to reach Cuautitlán on the afternoon of August 27, 1730, after 26 days.\n\nAfter everything they had been through, Cuautitlán was a paradise for them and, in addition, they received all kinds of attention from the mayor who provided them with food, housing and clothing during their stay.\n\nJuan Leal and guide Duval are appointed leaders of the group, responsible for solving any problems that may arise. But even though the route and the conditions for the trip were planned, after spending two and a half months in Cuautitlán, the Canarian families, who had experienced the difficulties of the road and heard what awaited them, insisted more and more frequently on staying.\n\nFinally, they left on November 15 to avoid desertions.\n\nThe route from here is as follows: Cuautitlán to Tepexi del Río, Ruano, San Juan del Río, Coyotillos Chicos, Amascala , Puerto Pinto, Carboneras, San Luis de la Paz, Sauceda de Los Mulatos, Valle de San Francisco, San Luís de Potosí, Las Bocas, La Diana, El Venado, Laguna Seca, Arroyo Seco, Matehuala, El Cedral, Pozo Nuevo, Aguadulce, Cieneguilla, Encarnación, Agua Nueva and El Saltillo.\n\nThey were not to deviate from the path, and always camp on the outskirts of the towns with their consent. A person would go in front who would anticipate the arrival of the families. The person who abandoned the caravan would be considered a deserter and, as such, would be persecuted and brought to justice.\n\nFrom El Saltillo to San Antonio the dangers increased as they entered Comanche territory, towards the northwest. The first attack surprised them at night when trying to cross the Rio Grande, but luckily no human life was lost.\n\nAfter going through several difficulties along the journey, they finally arrived in San Antonio at dawn on March 9, 1731, after more than eight months of caravan and almost a year since they left the port of Santa Cruz de Tenerife. The families settled in the houses of the prison soldiers in huts and carriages.\n\nThe captain of the prison had orders from the Viceroy to distribute the lands among the families by assigning them to lots, but it was not easy and many disputes arose, so it was decided to leave it for later and for the moment to plant together an area already cleared by the military and their families.\n\nThanks to the harvest they were able to survive on their own since royal aid had run out.\n\nAt the beginning of July, the streets begin to be laid out, for which stones and stakes are given to the families. The land is distributed in a flat area and the pasture areas are delimited. The city was located between the San Antonio River and the San Pedro Arroyo, and before the families arrived, five Franciscan missions already existed on the site. The closest was San Antonio Valero, which will be known to this day as El Álamo. Between this mission and the San Antonio prison was where the city was founded with a municipal government called Cabildo.\n\nAs we stated in other sections of this website, from this theme park we want to pay an emotional tribute to our island ancestors who founded San Antonio de Texas.\n\nThe following is a list of the fifty members of the fifteen families, plus four celibate men, who left Cuatlitlán on November 15, 1730 and who left for, at that time, San Fernando de Béxar to found San Antonio de Texas on the 1 August 1731.
