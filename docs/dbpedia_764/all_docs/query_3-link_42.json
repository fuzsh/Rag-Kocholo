Even more anomalous is the fact Ithat at no time in the history of Spanish dramatic litera- i jture has America served as a genuinely important source of either inspiration or material. The explanation in the case! of the sixteenth century is patently simple; the drama of ] that era was in the process of taking form and the majority ; of the plays, excepting of course the farces of Dope de Rueda, were either Spanish imitations of the Italian human­ istic comedy or representations of familiar religious ! themes, neither of which required much originality on the part of the playwrights of the period. The explanation with| respect to the later drama is not so simple since, with the I flowering of the seventeenth century theater, some impact of| {the events that were taking place in the New World could be j I jexpected. Such was not the case. Although countless plays i 'were written during this century in which the important_____ Incidents in the political and social development of Spain were dramatized, the march of history in America was only 'faintly reflected in the dramatic output of the age. It is this extreme rarity of Golden Age plays on the 'New World theme, together with the fact that the few that do exist have been ignored, with few exceptions, by literary historian and critic, that has inspired the present study. I The comparative silence with respect to these plays ! I is not hard to explain since not only are they few in numberi ! ■ jbut also the majority have been considered of too little i jliterary merit to warrant detailed investigation. Aside j from passing mention by such writers as Adolph Schack and George Ticknor, to mention two, only three scholars in the ! : field of dramatic literature have undertaken to study this i I jsegment of Spanish drama. The first to interest himself in { jthe dramas was Marcelino Menendez y Pelayo who included the I jthree known plays of Lope de Vega that deal with the New jWorld in the collection of that dramatist’s works which he | ■ 1 I prepared for the Royal Spanish Academy. Included in the i I P same collection is a single auto sacramental which has its ; {setting in America. The eminent Chilean scholar Jose ; 1 I ^ These plays are: El Nuevo Mundo descubierto oor ICristobal Colon. El Brasil restituido. and Arauco domado. I 2 ; A one act, allegorical, religious drama. The title 'of this one is: La araucana. 3 Toribio Medina edited two of the plays that deal with the history of Chile and included his own edition of Lope’s La I ^ araucana. Medina’s work is preceded by a prologue in which; all of the plays concerned are mentioned by title, and, in some cases, are discussed in more or less detail, depending { Lpon the information he had at his disposal. However, the | prologue cannot be considered as definitive in any sense of I I I |the word, since, excepting those plays about Chile, Medina i I i was not in possession of many of the others when he prepared | his study, and, in some cases at least, has listed as lost j plays that have since been located. j Marcos Morfnigo has studied the American influence on j I j [ | . jthe theater of Lope de Vega in a work, which, although | {chiefly concerned with the total impact of the New World on j Lope’s drama, contains information with respect to the ■compositions of other playwrights in which the American | I I I theme enters. I ; i One other work remains to be mentioned. This ' ^ Dos comedias famosas y un auto sacramental basados princioalmente en La Araucana de Ercilla. anotadqs y precedidos de un orologo sobre la historié de America como fuente del teatro antiguo esoahol (Barcelona, 1917») I The plays included in Medina’s study are; Pedro de Rejaule’s L& bellfgera esoahola. and Caspar de Avila’s El 'gobernador prudente. ^ ^ America en el teatro de Lope de Vega (Buenos Aires, comprises a series of studies undertaken in 19^7 by the Institute of Gonazlo de Fernandez de Oviedo in commemoration of the fourth centennial of the death of Cortez.^ Among these is a chapter on the various dramas in which the latter appears as protagonist. Any theory as to why the discovery of America, \"the greatest event since the creation,\" as Gomara aptly describes I ; it, should not have exerted a strong influence on the drama ; must be conjectural. Several theories have been proposed j with respect to the matter, of which the most plausible ap- j pears to be the one that lays the blame for the almost total| I lack of dramatic material dealing with America on the | {general ignorance which prevailed on the part of the public j i I with respect to the affairs of the New World. It was this | [ignorance that prompted Alonso de Gvalle to undertake the ! writing of his Historica relaclon in which he set forth some; f t of the events which had taken place in Peru. This ^ Spain.

I, xviii.) iMedina adds: \"Es un hecho muy digno de notarse la jignorancia y muchas veces absolute e increfble en los que jtrataron de las cosas de Chile y de America en general, se .......................................... 5 ignorance may be attributed in part, at least, to the ! Y ■extreme slowness with which information was disseminated. This sluggishness is well illustrated by the fact that thirty years elapsed between the time that Columbus first set foot on American shores and the appearance of the first account of exploration in America. Oddly enough this was not Columbus’ relation of his journey and discovery, but, rather Cortez* second Carta de relacion which appeared in I A printed form in 1522. Other major works dealing with ! America were published sporadically throughout the sixteenth Lentury; but it should be remembered, however, that the mere 'encontraban respeto de las produooiones de otros escritores,| y aun de los puntos mas culminantes de hechos sucedidos casi; coetaneamente con ellos. La historia del descubrimiento ' mismo del Nuevo Mundo era casi un mito para los literatos bel coloniaje.\" (Ibid.. I, xx-xxi.) While the printed word may have traveled slowly, such was not the case with information that passed from mouth to mouth as Las Casas ’ account of how the news spread relative to Columbus’ journey from Seville to Barcelona will bear out. \"Tomo oomienzo la faraa a volar por Castilla, que ! se habfan descubierto tierras que se llamaban las Indias, y ' gentes tantas y tan diverses, y cosas novisfmas, y que por jtal camino venfa el que las descubrib, y trafa consigo de j aquella gente; no solamente de los pueblos por donde pasaba ' salfa el mundo a lo ver, pero muchos de los pueblos, del I bamino donde venfa, remotos, se vaciaban, y se henchfan los ! ■oaminos para irlo a ver, y adelantarse a los pueblos a ! recibirlos.\" (Historia general de las Indias (Mexico, 1877), I, 298.) ^ Cortez’ third and fourth Cartas de relacion ap­ peared In 1525 and 1525, respectively. fact that a work of the type in question appeared in print Loes not imply that it enjoyed wide circulation.^ The scarcity of paper and the lack of facilities for printing, to say nothing of the cost, would in all probability have precluded the issuance of a large number of copies or I numerous editions. Nevertheless two historical works jdealing with the New World proved to be so popular that jseveral reprints appeared within the space of a few years. These were Lopez de Gomara's Historia general de las Indias which was first published in 1552 and reprinted in 1553, 1554 (two editions), and 1555; and Cieza de Leon's Orbnlca I ^ Other accounts of discovery and exploration which jwere published in the sixteenth century are as follows; Francisco de Jerez' Conauista del Peru (l53^), Oviedo's Historia general de las Indias (1535 and 1547/, Cabeza de Vaca's Naufragios~TlB42). Albenino's Verdadera relacion de lo sucedido en los reinos ^ orovincias del Peru (1549). Las Casas' Brevfsima relacion de la destruccion de las Indias (1552), Cabeza de Vaca's Comentarios (l555)2 Diazdel Castillo's Verdadera historia de la conauista de la Nueva Bspaha although completed in 1568 was not published until i Irving A, Leonard, in his biography of Carlos de iSigtienza y Gbngora, writes as follows with respect to the 'matter; 'He was so unfortunate as to live in a time and environment when chiefly those writings which glorified the Church and its servants were thought worthy of the press. The religious censorship imposed by the inquisition too often precluded the publication of works of a more secular nature. This, in itself, might not have been so serious an obstacle to Sigtienza who later became a 'corrector * of the Holy Office. But excessive cost of paper and printing rendered it impossible for this famous scholar to publish the results of his own studies.\" (Don Carlos de Sigüenza y Gbngora. a. Mexican Savant of the Seventeenth Century r bel Peru which appeared in 1553, was republished twice in 1554 and still again in 1555- Aside from the factors already mentioned, it seems safe to assume that this igno­ rance may also have resulted, in part at least, from the 1 11 rigid censorship of the press that prevailed at the time. Enrique de Vedia sets forth a second theory with respect to the absence of America in the drama in his intro- jduction to Historiadores prlmitivos de Indias. In his opinion the poets of the seventeenth century were so en­ grossed in imitating the classics and in adapting Italian form to Spanish verse that they had no desire to search the iworks of the chroniclers and historians for new material or for fresh sources of information. De Vedia makes particular note of the fact that Alonso de Ercilla was so intent on | 1 I jimitating classical form when he composed his La araucana jthat he completely ignored the grandiose spectacle of nature which surrounded him and lost himself in an atmosphere of ^ classical antiquity. How otherwise can it be explained that! (Berkeley, 1929), pp. I6-I7.) n Bailey ¥. Diffie states that owing to the strict application of the laws governing censorship \"Not a few of the most famous and authoritative works on America were not printed until the nineteenth and twentieth centuries . . .,\" (Latin American Civilization (Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, 1945), p. 511•) For a detailed discussion of the censorship laws and their effect on the publication of books see Henry Charles Lea, A History of the Inquisition in Spain (New York> 1906-07), III, 8' tie chose to amuse his soldiers during a long night with a poetical account of the loves of Dido and Aeneas, rather than I 12 with some tale or legend closer to them in time and space? How otherwise can the fact be explained that the native characters that appear in the poem bear greater resemblance to the heroes of Greece and Troy, with whom they are constantly compared, than they do to the persons they were supposed to represent? Menendez y Pelayo, remarking on the fact that so few plays have been written about Columbus, has evolved still a I third theory in his endeavor to explain the matter which, if, In de Vedia's words; \"La alteracibn que sufrib la. poesfa en la epoca que hemos citado consistib principalmente; en dar toda importancia a las formas, descuidando hasta cierto qunto las ^demas condiciones, y haeiendola de pura imitacibn; perdib pues su caraeter nativo, su originalidad y frescura, ganando por otra parte en pureza, eorreccibn y elegancia; los ritmos italianos la dierqn mayor armonfa, y la copia de las ideas y pensamientqs clasicos se llevb a tal extreme, que en cualquiera situacibn en que se hallase el ; poeta, su imaginacibn le trasladaba a los tiempos mitolbgi- ' cos y a los antiguos imperios de Grecia y Roma. Sblo asi f puede explicarse, por eJemplo, que Ercilla, para entretener i a los soldados despues de una marcha penosa por las ' soledades ^de los Andes, les cuenta una noche los amores de ! iDido y Eneas, en vez de trasraitir a sus lectores los efectos^ I que en su fantasfa causaba el grandioso espectaculo que la : inaturaleza ofrecfa a sus ojos\"; (Historiadores orimitlvos de' Indias (Madrid, 1852), I, x. (Vol. XXII, Biblioteca de autores esoanoles.) This lack of references to New World phenomena is {also strikingly noticeable in such other poetical works of ;the age as; Pedro de Ona's Arauco domado. Laso de la Vega's I Cortes valeroso y la. Meiicana. and Barco Centenera * s la { Argentina. applicable in the case of the latter, would apply equally in jthat of Cortez and Francisco Pizarro. His theory holds that the personages that took part in the discovery and conquest (and he is speaking from the seventeenth century point of view) were not sufficiently ancient to have assumed the patina of myth and legend that would attract the attention of a dramatist in search of a subject or a protagonist. To jbulwark his theory, Menendez y Pelayo cites, among others, the cases of the Cid and the Infantes de Lara, who, having lived, achieved, and died in a remote past had, by the seventeenth century, gained the legendary status necessary to invite dramatization. In addition, Menendez y Pelayo 'points out that the enormity of the historical events relative to America was such that it tended to suppress and annihilate poetic invention.^^ Whether or not this theory is true is a matter of opinion,‘and it is not within the scope of this study to According to Menendez y Pelayo; \"Es uno de los casos en que la sublime realidad oprime y anonada la invencibn poetica. Y aqui la historia es de ayer, [he is referring to Columbus] comprobada y documentada en todas sus partes, sin que le quede a la fantasia^modo de refugiarse enI la penumbra de la leyenda, a la oual sblo convienen los itierapos remotos y fabulosos. Guando comienza la historia critica, acaba la epopeya. Cuando la poesfa sale de los archives, fuera insensatez buscarla en boca de los juglares y rapsodas. Para que la historia moderna pueda ser fuente de poesfa, sera precise que el transcurso de los siglos vaya deformando la nocibn histbrica y engendrando nuevos mitos. ' (Obras de Looe de Vega (Madrid, 1900), XI, cv.) ------------------------------------------------------------------------lü challenge it. What does seem evident however, in view of the foregoing, is the fact that the body of material con­ cerned with America was sufficiently extensive and written ■in such detail that to compose successfully a play from a segment of it would try the skill of the most able dramatist; Of the latter there were many, but there were few among these who were sufficiently motivated by the material to undertake to sort out the facts for the purpose of recasting them in dramatic form. There are other possible explanations for the unpopu­ larity of the American theme which seem to have points in their favor. One which deserves more attention than it has received attributes this unpopularity to the fact that, aside from Tirso de Molina, none of the dramatists who wrote |on New World subjects had ever been in America. Such being i ■ the case, none of them was familiar with the locale, and I lacking the intimate acquaintance that could be gained only through first-hand contact, were uninterested or unable to produce dramas with American settings. As proof of this, ! I two instances can be cited in which the dramatist, writing a; I play which had its setting both in Spain and in the New | World, excelled in the scenes which were set in territory familiar to him but failed to hold interest when the setting^ was moved to American soil. The plays are Moreto's Vida v | 1 muerte de San Luis Beltran, and Cervantes' E2. rufian dichosol 11 The same holds true to some extent with Tirso de Molina's fcrilogy on the Fizarros. To summarize; As soon as the author endeavors to re-create settings which are totally un­ familiar to him his work loses animation, and his characters become wooden figures moving in a stereotyped world. It can be said, of course, that many successful plays dere composed in the seventeenth century in which the action rt?as developed outside of Spain. This is true, but it must I be remembered that these plays dealt with classical or tra- j I I ditional subjects, which, as has been previously stated, were as familiar to the playwrights writing them as their own environs. I I Medina, still concerned with the problem at hand, has advanced still another conjecture, which although seemingly a little far-fetched, cannot be ignored. In his opinion, with the end of the era of discovery and exploration, i.e., jthe sixteenth century, the New World, remote as it was from Spain, ceased yielding material interesting enough to t 'justify dramatization. The great explorers, adventurers, and conquerors had stepped into history; the crossing of un­ charted seas and the conquering of strange lands and peoples bad become a matter of record. Life had settled into a l2i prosaic and ordered routine. \"Junto con acabar el siglo XVI,\" writes Medina, \"y 12 Still not mentioned, although related to the matter peing discussed, is the fact that the Golden Age playwrights were, for the most part, engaged in writing plays that had a popular appeal, and the public of that era, demanding come- kies of the cloak and dagger type, or representations, replete with miracles, based on familiar national and re­ ligious figures, was not interested in dramatized versions of the biographies of Columbus, Cortez, or Pizarro. | It has already been stated that the plays which enterj I into this study are not well known. It now remains to be | determined why this should be true. While at no time will it be my objective to evaluate each play from the standpoint el reinado de Felipe II, habia encontrado tambien su termine^ casi en todas partes, el perfodo de la conquista en America | con sus hazanas de titanes, cuyos nombres, en no escaso , , numéro, habfa recogido la historia para divulgarse luego, i |como hemos visto, llevados al escenario dramatico.

It is singular to note that even in the cases of the New World (dramas of Tirso, Lope de Vega, and Calderon, none is ranked among the best works of its author, and in all cases, with- Lut exception, have either been slighted completely, or merely listed among the known works of their authors. Why should this be true? The answer to the question is to be Lound, in part, in what has been said previously regarding the playwrights’ lack of familiarity with the New World |scene, and, in part, to other factors which bear mention. For one thing, leaving aside all of the other elements involved, biographies, such as those of Columbus and Cortez, to mention two, ordinarily do not make good dramatizable , material. The subject is too big, and the gaps in time and j space are such that any attempt to reduce them to the ' confines of a three act play is certain to be unsuccessful. In the second place, many of the plays, particularly those j which comprise the Araucanian cycle, are eulogies in dra- i I matic form and as such were not the result of genuine poetic, inspiration; the author received a price for writing them. j Each of these plays contains long and effusive encomiums | which completely nullify any interest that it might other- | jwise have contained. Finally, in almost all cases these | I [plays are overweighted with history. The amount of ------------------------------------------------------------------------ lif background information necessary to prepare the audience or the reader for the action that is to follow, is so extensive |bhat it completely overshadows the development of the plot. These elements, together with what may well have been a I general lack of interest in the American scene of the pre­ ceding (sixteenth) century, may partially explain why none of the dramas on a New World theme has gained distinction for its literary excellence. The question now arises as to the identity of the various plays which form the basis for the present study and bhe sources from which they were secured. At the outset it must be pointed out that these plays, which number twenty- jone in all, are not the only ones which were written on a New World theme during the Golden Age since others are known by title only, and it is not improbable that still others I i may exist in forgotten editions or may still remain in manu-| script form. Twelve of the plays under consideration were I .... j {contained in a list presented to me by Professor Marcos | Morfnigo at whose suggestion this study was undertaken. The! remainder were found through the mention of their titles by : j I such writers as Jose Toribio Medina, Marcelino Menendez y ! i Pelayo, and Barrera y Leirado; or through an examination of fche catalogue of the British Museum for its list of plays by he various authors who were known or thought to have com­ posed plays on the American theme. Once the task of collecting the plays was completed it was found that they all fell into more or less definite groups. These are as follows : The Cortez cycle Cortés triunfante en Tlascala^^ (Augustfn Cordero) La conauista de Mexico^^ (Zarate y Castronovo) El valeroso espanol y orimero de su casa^'^ (Caspar de Avila) The Pizarro cycle Las palabras a ^los reves y gloria de los Fizarros.

Later the term became synonymous with millionaire. 19 the time he has spent wandering in those strange regions. It was not until the appearance in 1557 of Las cortes be la Muerte. which was begun by Miguel de Caravajal and completed by Luis Hurtado de Toledo, that the influence of âmerica was definitely felt in the drama. The chief im­ portance of Las cortes is the fact that its appearance shortly after the middle of the sixteenth century coincided jwith the fact that the treatment accorded the natives of the ew World was uppermost in the minds of all who were inter­ ested in American affairs.No better presentation of the matter has been presented in any of the plays dealing with America than that of Caravajal and Hurtado de Toledo, who, expressing themselves through the medium of the chieftain, make clear that they are entirely sympathetic to the cause of the Indian even though they do not condone his barbarous way of life and his idolatrous religion. In the opening scene of Las cortes Death announces her intention of holding general courts to which all mortals who have complaints against her may come to present their cases. In the nineteenth scene a native chieftain or cacique arrives to present the case of the native inhabit­ ants of the New World, who, prior to the arrival of the 59 See chapter entitled The Motives for the Conquest for a discussion of this matter. 20\" Spaniards, had lived a life of peace and plenty, but who since their arrival had suffered endlessly at the hands of jbhe conqueror. The chieftain asks Death why the Spaniard should come preaching Christianity on the one hand while on the other murdering and robbing the very ones he has come to convert : 6Que injuria, o que villanfa o que deshonra o despecho les habemos hecho hoy dfa porque tal carnicerfa hagan en nos, como han hecho? ^Robamosles por ventura sus campos, sus heredades, sus mujeres? ^Que locura es esta, y tal desventura de tantas enmistades? The chieftain continues to lament the fact that the Spaniards ' insatiable lust for gold should have caused his people to suffer cruelrabuses at their hands. He censures jthe Spaniard for having brought to America such instruments i of destruction as the sword and the harquebus when such ! 'instruments had not been known there before. The case of I I the Indian is summarized and the verdict of Death is awaited : Pues sblo resta saber si en estas oortas tan dinas se pudiese preveer como quitar el poder destas gentes y rapinas. Y si no hay para que, no nos espere mas dfa; mas antes nos da tu fe llevarnos, y luego ve a librar tal tiranfa. iSanto Domingo Intervenes to curse the evils that have ■21\" resulted from the discovery of America: Di, India, ^por que mostraste a Europa esos tus raetales falsos con que la llevaste, y despues nos la enviaste cargado de tantos males? ^No le bastaban las minas de pecados que tenfa tan profunda8 y continas, sino cargarla de espinas con que mata cada dfa? ;0h India, que diste puertas a los mfseros mortales para males y reyertasI ÎIndias, que tienes abiertas las gargantas infernales I IIndia, abismo de pecados I (India, rica de maldadesl (India, de desventuradosI (India, que con tus ducados entraron las torpedades!

Las cortes apparently enjoyed a temporary popularity, at least, since there is some reason to believe that it is one and the same with the auto which was represented by the 40 company of Angulo the Bad in the Quiiote. Justo de Sancha states in the introduction to his edition of Las cortes: \"No serfa imposible que esta compo- sicibn sea el Auto de las cortes de la Muerte. que iba irepresentando Angulo el Malo, de que se hace mend bn en el Quiiote. La fecha de la composicibn, el tftulo, y hasta la indicacibn de algunos de los personajes que iban en el carro, lo hacen presumir con hafto fundamento; pero como no tenemos una seguridad compléta, puede quedar esta sospecha en el carapo de las conjecturas fsic 1.\" (Biblioteca de autores espaholes (Madrid, 1872), XXXV, footnote, viTj 22\" One play remains to be mentioned. This is Antonio iurtado de Mendoza’s Cada loco con su tema ^ ^ montanes indiano. which, although belonging to the seventeenth centu­ ry, the period with which the present study is concerned, will be discussed in this chapter since it is related only Indirectly to the New World. As in comedia Selvagia. the entire action of Mendoza's play is developed in Spain around the amorous adventures of a Spanish gentleman recently re­ turned from Peru, in this case one Heman Perez. In the play le is referred to by the other characters as an indiano. which fact pleases him not at all. In one passage he takes pains to point out that his wealth came through a dowery and was not the product of his own labor: Pobre a las Indias pase y en ellas, por mi nobleza, con gran dote de rigueza y de virtud, me case. No querio de indiano el nombre que su riqueza mezquina es hacienda en la picina que le viene a faltar hombre. Infrequent references are made to places in the New World. In one of these passages a character speaks of Lima: Nacf en la eiudad de Lima, donde los virreyes tienen la bien respetada silla del iraperio del occidente. Mention is also made of Arequipa: Un volcan tiene Arequipa, que, de fuego armado, suele ^3 en las conveeinas tlerras haeer estragos ardientes. The term criollo^^ appears now and again. In the following passage it is used with disparagement: ve que soy de un criollo engendrada a lo moderno? Considerable thought has been devoted to the question jas to the best method of treating the plays concerned in the present study. It was finally decided to discuss each of them separately from the standpoint of the following: l) Date of composition (whenever possible), date of publi­ cation, and editions, particular attention being accorded the latter if the play is obscure or rare. 2) Sources. Where did the playwright obtain the background material on which he based his play? If more than one source was avail­ able, which ones did he use? 3) Reasons for writing the play. Was it the product of poetic inspiration, or did the dramatist have other motives? 4) Historical background. This will be given in general for each cycle, and the im­ mediate background of each play will be developed in sufficient detail to place it definitely as to time and place. Comparisons will also be made between the actual history and the historical material presented in the play In the strictest sense of its meaning criollo is used to designate a pure blooded Spaniard born in America inj contrast to the mestizo. a half-breed. f for the purpose of determining the relative accuracy of the dramatist in his presentation of events. 5) Flot. A detailed resume will be given of each of the plays. This is deemed necessary in order that the reader may evaluate them as they relate to the other plays belonging to the same group as well as to those which belong to other groups, and ■in order that the relationship of each of the dramas to the American scene as a whole may be clearly seen. A complete account of the action is also necessary for the purpose of comparing the historical incidents as they actually occurred land as they are represented in the dramas, and, finally, for the purpose of illustrating »the extent to which the subject jof America served as a vehicle for dramatic representation. 6) Finally, there will be some discussion of the play as a whole which will include any points not covered by the topics listed above. The concluding four chapters will be given over to a consideration of the plays as a group as they serve to illustrate the following: l) The motives for the conquest. 2) The American native as he is presented in the plays. 3) The first impressions that the natives re­ ceived of the Spaniards. 4) The influence of Alonso de Ercilla’s La araucana (aside from serving as a source) on the plays on American themes. CHAPTER II I THE CORTEZ CYCLE The seventeenth century plays which have Hernando I jCortez as their principal character and Mexico as their scene are as obscure as those whose settings are laid in Peru and in which the Pizarros play the leading roles. In all only five dramas are known to have been written about ! him during the Golden Age and of these El valeroso espanol % j i primero de su casa. attributed to Caspar de Avila, is the ! only one that has found its way into modern print. Two 1 other plays, Augustfn Cordero's Cortes triunfante en Tlas- ' O X y !cala. and Zarate y Castronovo's La conauista de Mexico survive only in extremely rare editions of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries.^ The two remaining plays. La ^ This play has also been listed among the works of iLope de Vega and Luis Velez de Guevara. ! ^ There is the possibility that this play was com­ posed during the eighteenth century and hence does not properly belong within the scope of the present study. See pp. 34-36 for further discussion with regard to the matter. ^ The present study of these two plays is based upon microfilms obtained from the British Museum. (Now on file in the library of the University of Southern California.) conauista de Portés^ and Marqués del Valleboth attri­ buted to Lope de Vega, are known to me by title only. El valeroso espanol is not concerned with the conquest of Mexico but rather purports to dramatize some of the incidents which occurred in Spain from 1527 to 1550, the years that Cortez spent in that country endeavoring to defend himself against various charges that had been brought against him. (These will be discussed later.On the other hand. La conauista de Mexico and Cortes triunfante en I ' Tlascala both have their scene in Mexico at the time of the Lonquest. Unlike Tirso de Molina and Luis Velez de Guevara, who used their plays based upon the lives of the Pizarros as ^ According to Barrera y Leirado conauista de Cortes exists in manuscript form. Unfortunately no infor­ mation is given with respect to the present location of the manuscript nor does Barrera state the source of his infor­ mation regarding it.

It is also mentioned by H. Rennert and A. Castro in their catalogue of Lope's plays with the following notation after the title: ’. . . jen el Catalogo de los herederos de Medel del Castillo consta ique esta pieza se hallaba de venta en 1755.\" (Vida de Lope be Verna (Madrid, 1919), p. 471.) Marcos Morinfgo is of the 'opinion that both plays are one and the same appearing under different titles.

I Gaspar de Avila on the contrary may have been moved to write I his drama through the desire to vindicate the conqueror of I Mexico. One thing particularly worthy of note with respect ! I I to the plays that comprise the Cortez cycle as a group, is ■ I I that all three dramatists present the character of Cortez in a very favorable light. Throughout their works the latter is portrayed as a shrewd, determined man, boundless in ener­ gy and equal to any occasion. Perhaps the keynote of his | i I character as revealed in the plays is his gift of leadership, 1 I his decisiveness, and his singleness of purpose. These i qualities as they are brought out as the action of the | dramas unfold make Cortez feared and loved at the same time ' by Spaniard and native alike. The latter in particular are | at once disarmed by his friendliness and rendered fearful by j 1 I his unflinching determination. i The immediate historical background of the plays of Zarate y Castronovo and Cordero begins on February l8, 1519, on which day, according to Gomara, a squadron of some twelve ’ ships set sail from the port of Trinidad on the island of Cuba bound for an unexplored land to the west which was reported to be of vast extent and rich in gold. Landing was first made on the island of Cozumel which lies off the northern tip of what is now the peninsula of Yucatan. While the ships were at anchor here Geronimo Aguilar, a surviving member of Juan de Grijalva's ill-fated expedition of some years before, presented himself to Cortez and gave an ac­ count of his life, among the natives since being shipwrecked. The expedition then continued to explore the coast of Yucatan and finally dropped anchor off the coast of Tabasco. The natives of the region, remembering the treatment that hac been accorded them by the members of Grijalva's expedition, received Cortez and his men with open hostility. A bloody battle took place between the Tabascans and the forces of ! Cortez in which the Spaniards emerged victorious, thanks to the fear that the sight of the horse and the noise of fire­ arms instilled in the foe. The native ruler, now recog­ nizing the superiority of the Spaniards, hastened to show his goodwill by presenting Cortez with food and gifts. Among the latter were several native women one of whom was a |high-born Aztec maiden who was destined to play an important part in the conquest. Soon after Joining the expedition shej j I was baptized and was given the Christian name of Marina. | ______Exploration of the coast continued until finally, on I 29 April 19, 1519, a landing was made on the coast of the island of San Juan de Ulua. It was here that Teudile, Montezuma’s jemissary, was received by Cortez and was informed by the latter that as the representative of the Emperor of Spain he desired to deliver in person a message to the ruler of the In the meantime Montezuma had thoroughly informed himself of the progress of the expedition and had received with alarm the reports of the victories of the bearded Ltrangers from over the sea. His perturbation was all the greater since in the arrival of the Spaniards Montezuma saw the fulfillment of a prophecy that he and his empire would fall into the hands of Just such men as these. It was with the hope, a faint one to be sure, that the Spaniards could be persuaded to leave the land, that Teudile was dispatched to greet Cortez. This mission was a failure since the richness of the gifts, many of which were of worked gold, and the reports concerning the splendor of the capital city of Anahuac made Cortez more determined than ever to pene­ trate the land. When at last it had become apparent that the Spanish leader would carry out his plans, the natives who had received the Spaniards with overtures of friendli­ ness and had provided them with food all departed within the space of a single night, and the little band of Spaniards I Ifound itself completely alone in a hostile land and at the ■ ■ ^01 meroy of a hundred thousand or more of merciless enemies. ' I I Lack of food and other hardships threatened the | expedition with disaster. Pessimism and discontent were rife and many of the men were in favor of returning to Cuba. Cortez, realizing the seriousness of the situation and jfeeling that his men had lost confidence in him, resigned as leader of the expedition so that another leader might be selected by popular vote. This was a master stroke on his part as he was immediately re-elected to the position by unanimous vote. Shortly following the election the city of I , I Vera Cruz, the first Spanish settlement in New Spain, was founded. This event took place on May 15, 1519. 1 Soon after the establishment of Vera Cruz malcontents among the men plotted to seize the ships and return to Cuba but Cortez became informed of the scheme, thwarted it, and lin order to avoid any further attempts at defection, ordered I !the ships destroyed. With all possibility of retreat ruled out the Spaniards rallied around Cortez to the last man and ’ preparations were made to penetrate into the interior of the I [land. I Soon after the expedition, which consisted of some I ;five hundred Spaniards, began its trek inland it was joined |by a force of Tontonac warriors, who, being bitter enemies of the Aztecs, welcomed the opportunity to take part in what they hoped would be the annihilation of their enemy. The route that Cortez chose to follow lay through the kingdom of j piascala whose people were also enemies of the Aztecs, This j decision was based upon the fact that the Spanish leader had been informed of the animosity that existed between the Tlascalans and the inhabitants of Anahuac and hoped not only to gain permission to pass through Tlascala on his march to the Aztec capital, but also to add the Tlascalan army to his growing forces. After four days of march the frontiers of the latter country were reached and four Tontonac chieftains were sent ahead to request permission to pass through that land. The request was refused after the matter had been argued at great length in the Tlascalan senate. The news of the refusal did not daunt Cortez who ordered that the land ibe entered by force. After several pitched battles the iTlascalan forces were defeated, thanks to the courage and I leadership of Cortez. This victory achieved more than Cortez had hoped for since the Spaniards were not only re­ ceived with great rejoicing on the part of the inhabitants of the Tlascalan capital, but in addition the native array jjoined the Spanish forces as an ally. ■ News of the approach of the Spaniards was received with consternation by Montezuma who sent emissary after emissary, each bearing richer gifts than the preceding one, ’ I I in the vain hope that by this means the intruders could be .bribed to leave the land. The effect was just the opposite ' j - 32 since the sight of the riches convinced the Spaniards that ^hey would be richly rewarded for their risks in continuing with the conquest. When this strategy failed Montezuma endeavored to enlist the support of the Tlascalans but to no avail, and the Spanish forces, now numbering in the thousands, entered the valley of Mexico. When news of the approach reached Montezuma and he realized that further efforts to dissuade Cortez from entering the capital would be useless, the Aztec ruler advanced to meet him. The I encounter of the two men was a dramatic one. The Mexican Emperor was accompanied by a retinue of the highest nobles of Anahuac, all impressively attired, while Cortez was followed by a weary band of men whose appearance was certain­ ly not one to inspire admiration or awe on the part of the j 'Aztecs. When the two parties had approached sufficiently, - Cortez dismounted and advanced to meet Montezuma, who in the; meantime had descended from his palanquin. Upon reaching i . the spot where the Emperor awaited him Cortez made a gesture' I as if to embrace him, but the Monarch’s retainers restrained; him saying that to touch their ruler’s person was a crime ; I Î punishable by death. The entry of the Spaniards into the capital city of ' y i Anahuac was a triumphant one but in spite of the affir- j mations of friendship on the part of Montezuma and the ! cordial reception accorded him and his men Cortez had I- - - - - ■ — - - - - - - - - - I misgivings, and in order to assure the safety of the Spaniards he ordered the seizure of the Emperor as a hostagej An excuse for this audacious act presented itself when word was received that an attack had been made upon the Spanish I garrison in Vera Cruz and Montezuma, although he asserted ! that he was in no way responsible for the hostile act, was made a prisoner in his own palace where he remained until he met death at the hands of his own subjects.? | Very little information is available concerning Augustfn Cordero or his Cortes triunfante en Tlascala which i I ! dramatizes the progress of the conquest from Cortez' landing on the coast of Tabasco to the triumphant entry of the Spaniards into the capital city of Tlascala. Barrera y Leirado lists the play and gives the date of publication as Q 1780 but no other details. It is apparent that Barrera did not know the playwright's given name since only his surname appears after the title and a blank space is left where the first name would ordinarily go. ' ? Por a detailed account of the conquest of Mexico from its beginning until the death of Montezuma the reader is referred to Lopez de Gomara's Conauista de Mexico (Mexico, 1870), and to Bernal Dfaz del Castillo's Historia verdadera de la conauista de Nueva Espana (Madrid, 1955), Vol. I. William H. Prescott's Conquest of Mexico (New York, 1886) offers the most detailed account of the conquest written in the English language. 8 Barrera y Leirado, cit.. p. 100. - - - ------------- It has already been pointed out? that the possibility j exists that Cortes triunfante belongs to the eighteenth | rather than to the seventeenth century. This possibility was not entirely discounted when, owing to the almost total lack of information concerning its author and the fact that there is much about the play from a structural standpoint^^ I I that would justify placing it in the earlier century, it was : I I decided to include it in the present study. A microfilm of ; ithe 1780 edition was secured from the British Museum which at least added Cordero's given name to the scant information 11 which I already had. Shortly after I completed the study of the play, however, my attention was brought to Jorge Carapo's remarks on Cordero in his Hernando Cortés en la I 9 Cf. p. 23, footnote 2. t Of. p. 25.

This author expresses the opinion [that Cortes triunfante was written during the eighteenth century but gives no reasons whatsoever for his assumption aside from remarking that the play is classical (neo­ classical?) in tone and is composed in the \"new style.\" While Campo fails to define what he means by the latter term lit can be assumed that he is referring to the neo-classic ! 'style which developed in Spain during the eighteenth century partly if not entirely as the result of Ignacio Luzan's ! jcriticism of the drama of the Golden Age in Book III of his P o e t i c a Campo gives no biographical data concerning jcordero nor does he mention the date of composition of the play. The only edition he mentions is the I78O one. It is jSignifleant to point out that on one of the pages of the play reproduced in facsimile form in Campo's study it is stated that Cortes triunfante was presented, not published [for the first time in Madrid in 1769.

I For a discussion of Luzan’s Foetica and its , influence on the eighteenth century in Spain the reader is I referred to Robert E. Fellissier's The Neo-Classic Movement ' in Spain During the XVIII Century (Stanford University Press, üpain ______ 1918), p. 36 ei. passim. to the eighteenth century, I decided for lack of conclusive | |information to that effect to continue to place him in the | seventeenth century. The reasons for doing so are as I follows: 1) The three unities considered so essential to a } well-constructed neo-classic drama are totally ignored by i Cordero. The action of the play is not completed within the) I I specified twenty-four hours, the scenes shift from one geo- ! graphical location to another, and the plot, far from ad- ■ I ; hering to the principle of simplicity and verisimilitude, is ^ exaggerated and fantastic. In short, it violates most if i not all of the rules set forth by Luzan. 2) The structure j I I of the play as regards plot development, the relationship ofj the major and minor characters to one another (the gracioso ; jto the hero and the graciosa to the heroine), and the forms |of versification employed all place it definitely well [Within the seventeenth century. 3) Finally, there is no I basis for the assumption that the I780 edition was the first: ' 14 I or only one , The question now arises as to where Cordero secured I |the background material for his play. Two of the most like-, ^ ^ i ,ly sources are the accounts given by Lopez de Gomara and j In an effort to obtain further information re­ garding Cordero and the play in question a letter was written to Mr. Campo in care of the Instituto de Gonzalo Oviedo in November, 1951. To date (July, 1955) no reply has been received. Bernal Dfaz del Castillo in their respective histories of the conquest of Mexico. The former's Conauista de Mexico was published in 1552 and forms the second part of his I Historia general de las Indias; while the latter's Historia verdadera de la conauista de la Nueva Esoana appeared for 'the first time in print in Madrid in I632. Since both of 'these works deal with the same historical material and are I in agreement so far as all of the major events are concerned, either one could have served equally well as a source for \\ i Cortes triunfante en Tlascala. Despite this fact there is ; I ^ ; pome evidence that leads to the opinion that Gomara suppliedi at least a part of the historical material that is drama­ tized in the play. Por example, there is a scene at the ^conclusion of the first act in which Cortez has firearms discharged in order to impress and terrify the natives. The I reaction of the Indians is almost identical in both the play and Gomara's account of the incident while Dfaz del Casti­ llo's version differs slightly. The latter merely states that the Indians were frightened by the things that were so new to them while in both the play and in Gomara's account ithe natives fall to the ground on hearing the sound of the artillery Por a comparison of the passages see Gomara's Conauista de Mexico (Mexico, 1870), II, 515; and Dfaz del Castillo's Historia verdadera de la conauista de la Nueva Another indication that Cordero may have secured his i y background data from Gomara is to be found in the fact that his portrayal of Cortez is much more in harmony with the former's characterization than it is with that of Dfaz del Castillo whose attitude toward the conqueror of Mexico is more critical and less complimentary. In both the play and kn Gomara*s account the figure of Cortez is given a promi­ nence which is noticeably lacking in Dfaz del Castillo's work, and both Gomara and Cordero rarely miss the oppor­ tunity to emphasize those qualities in the character of jCortez which are most worthy of admiration and respect. On the other hand Dfaz del Castillo, although he characterizes Cortez as a man with unusual capabilities, does not eulogize I him, nor does he permit him to dominate the entire scene of the conquest. Esoana (Madrid, 1935), 1, 121. I Dfaz del Castillo does not openly criticize Cortez but rather makes his critical attitude manifest or expresses his disapproval through his selection of words or the slant that he gives to his account of certain of Cortez' actions. This point is well illustrated in the comment that he makes on the execution of Cuautemoc and the two caciques : \"E fue lesta muerte que les dieron muy injustamente, e parecio mal a jtodos los que fbamos.” (pp. cit.. II, 541.) Gomara devotes a chapter to the same matter but presents his material in [such a way that no doubt is left in the reader's mind as to the guilt of Cuautemoc and the other two supposed conspira­ tors.

Addressing the Tlascalans he laments that his i ! ! people should suffer oppression under the yoke of Aztec ' domination. His speech is interrupted by the sound of a ' i I I salvo which comes from the direction of the coast. The | natives are expressing their fear of the terrifying j I I noise and are conjecturing as to what has caused it when, suddenly, the priestess Alfa appears running and seeks I to address Gicotencal who, not knowing whether she is mortal or goddess, asks the reason for her distress. I I Alfa reveals her identity and informs Gicotencal that i ; I ! the god Cozumel has appeared to her at an isolated lake ; ; in the depth of the mountains and has informed her that I his temples in Tabasco have been destroyed and his I I I Images desecrated by strangers who have appeared j mysteriously from over the sea. Alfa continues to re- ' late that Cozumel has told her of a battle that has taken place between the intruders and the Tabascans in which a strange and terrible weapon that spat flame and I smoke has created great havoc. In his closing words the I god has informed the priestess that his dominion over the people is drawing to a close and that he must seek for new regions inhabited by human beings who will revere him. At the conclusion of Alfa's speech Gicotencal replies: El estranjero se acerca a esta parte: el intricado bosque ocultarnos podra: Alfa Divina, entre tanto que halle el modo de estorbar tu ruina, mi sobresalto. Magiscacin now appears and relates his good fortune in having been able to escape from the strange men. All are filled with fear as he tells of his encounter with them, and they beseech the aid of their gods in the struggle which they foresee. The scene now shifts to the coast where Cortez and his men have just landed and the former is relating all of the salient facts concerning the discovery, explo­ ration, and settlement of the New World from the time of Columbus until the moment of his speech. In concluding Cortez states that since the expedition has sailed from Cuba without the permission of Diego Velasquez, he can no longer consider himself as its leader. Upon hearing these words there is a unanimous vote that Cortez be re­ tained as leader. The latter has misgivings however: Dira el mundo que Cortes ambicioso, y mal amigo de Velasquez, por mandar, y por llegar a ser rico con esta nueva conquista traioion a su amistad hizo. The alcaldes of the first Spanish settlement in the new land are now chosen and Cortez is named chief among them : He then selects a name for the new colony: . . . en ella [the beach] que se funde determino ^ i nuestra primera poblacion, ! y para su nombre elijo I el de Vera Cruz, que acuerde 1 a los venideros siglos, j el primer dfa en que, : del mundo tan no creido, j para inmortal gloria nuestra I pisaraos el fertil sitio. I Alfa, Magiscacin, and the graciosa Cotorra now appear and^ marvel at the strange appearance of the Spaniards, and ; Cortez, seeing them approach, asks the priestess for | information about the land. The latter, believing the ' Spaniards to be divine beings, cannot understand why such information should be requested of an ordinary : i mortal. Her growing doubt as to the celestial origin of| Cortez and his men is expressed in the following words: , ^Cref ^ i dandoos mas alto principio que es sobrada preguntar para saber, mas he visto que tienen mucho de humanos los que presuraf Divines. Realizing then that the Spaniards know nothing about the land, Alfa informs them of the Mexican empire and of its powerful and feared emperor, Montezuma. Teutile now presents himself accompanied by Indians bearing gifts of fruit, cotton cloth, and gold ornaments and addressing Cortez informs him that he has come as Montezuma’s ambassador to receive the strangers whose arrival on the coast has come to the Monarch’s attention. The speech although diplomatically expressed, tells the Spaniards that their presence is not welcome and warns them not to endeavor to penetrate the land. The undertone of threat angers Cortez who replies that he will not leave the j land until he has personally delivered a message from ! his own Emperor to the ruler of the Aztecs. Although | Teutile’s attitude now changes from one of cautious I friendliness to open threat, Cortez is not to be dis­ suaded, and just as the Aztec emissary is taking leave in a haughty and arrogant manner a curtain is withdrawn : I revealing the full strength of the Spanish forces. The | sight of the weapons, armor, and particularly, of the I I horses, fills the Indians with awe. Cotorra asks in , amazement : ;Ay Sehores y que mixto de hombres y fieras aquell | A volley of shots is fired to further impress the natives with the strength of the Spaniards. Teutile, realizing that the latter are determined to enter Mexico despite his warnings, withdraws without saying more. Act Two opens with a speech in which Cortez exhorts his men to conduct themselves cautiously and in which he warns them not to become over-confident because of their easily won past victories. The necessary preparations having been made, the Spanish forces now delay their advance until the return of two Indian emissaries who have been sent to Tlascala for the purpose of requesting safe passage through that country. The emissaries re­ turn with the message that the Tlascalan senate after a day’s debate has decided against allowing Cortez and his men to pass through that country. After Cortez, out­ raged at the news of the refusal and swearing to reduce the capital city to ruins, has harangued his men and assigned them to their battle positions, the attack on Tlascala begins. The first encounter is of short duration as the superior numerical forces of the enemy is no match for the swiftness of the horses and the accuracy of the firearms of the Spanish. The scene now shifts to the interior of a temple in Tlascala. A pro­ cession enters to the accompaniment of the chant of a chorus, and Alfa, Magiscacin, and Cotorra appear __ ------------------------- followed by Marina who is escorted by several Indians.^? | Marina is to be sacrificed to placate the gods who in their ire have granted victory to the Spaniards. As the victim is led to the sacrificial stone a commotion is heard outside and several Tlascalan soldiers enter the temple to take refuge saying that Gicotencal is enraged at them because of the cowardice they have displayed in the battle with the Spaniards. Gicotencal now enters in| pursuit of the men but is stopped before he reaches them] by Magiscacin who informs the Tlascalan leader that it is he who is to blame for the defeat and not his men. Gicotencal is angered at this accusation and threatens Magiscacin with his sword, but Alfa stays his arm and endeavors to settle the quarrel in which the two men have become engaged. The sacrificial ceremony now pro- | ceeds and Marina is on the point of having her heart torn out when Cortez appears and saves her life. Marinaj grateful to the Spaniard for having saved her life, is prompted to relate to him how she happened to be in The entire ceremony including the arrangement of the chorus is identical with the Christian ritual as per­ formed in the autos of Calderon. The only distinguishing 'feature is the names of the characters, the mention of the sacrificial instrument, and the invocation of the pagan , deities. The chorus repeats at intervals during the ceremony? Fiedad, gran Bios, piedad clemencia, Dios, cl emend a. ; Tabasco when the Spaniards landed there. Cortez for his part is openly repelled by the custom of human sacrifice; and paying little heed to what Marina is saying he ex­ coriates the Tlascalans for this practice as well as for their cannibalism. His views on the matter are well ex­ pressed by the following: I Como,^Indios inhumanos, exécutais la Fiereza de raanchar de humana sangre las aras, en que venera vuestra oeguedad, inmundos fdolosi ^Que error eleva a la grandeza de Dioses la escandalosa caterba de figuras irrisibles entre vosotros? ^Qué ciega barbaridad os conduce, a creer que gratas sean a imaginarias Deidades, unas tragedies tan ciertas? jCabe mas en el horror I 6Que la supersticion pueda traer la vfctima humana desde el altar a la mesa? The natives who hear this speech marvel that the earth does not open to swallow Cortez up for his blasphemous utterances. The latter, however, oblivious to the effect of his pronouncement, now turns to Marina and invites her to join the women who are engaged in making bread for his army, and exhorts her to forsake her idolatrous beliefs and to become a Christian. The act ends with the christening of Marina and with a night attack on the Spaniards in which the Tlascalans are again defeated. At the beginning of the third act Gicotencal, dis­ guised as a burden bearer, appears at the Spanish camp and seeing Marina requests her permission to talk with Alfa. When this request is granted the Tlascalan leader announces that he has come to ask the Spaniards for peace. In the scene that follows Alvarado is heard warning Cortez that many of his men, fearful of the fact that they are greatly outnumbered by the enemy, plan to desert and return to Cuba. Cortez, who has been aware of uneasiness on the part of the men and concerned with the possibility of their defection, calls them together and assuring them of victory urges them to put aside their fears. This speech is interrupted by the arrival of two ambassadors one of whom is Gicotencal, who has ; determined to talk with the Spanish leader, and the other, Teutile, Montezuma’s emissary. The latter, real­ izing that the Spaniards have no intention of leaving I I the land and fearful that they will enter into an al- j liance with the Tlascalans, has decided to negotiate j with Cortez. For his part the Mexican Emperor has agreed to grant the Spaniards concessions under two con-| ditions: l) that they do not enter into an alliance with the Tlascalans for the purpose of making war upon ' him, and 2) that Cortez shall not persist in his effort Î - - - ----------------- I to reach the Mexican capital. Gieotencal now states the reason for his presence. Addressing Cortez he announces that the Tlascalans have decided to guarantee the Spanish forces safe passage through that land, and con­ veys the invitation of the senate and of the people for the Spaniards to enter the city and lodge themselves while they make preparations for their march on Mexico, Teutile who has heard the offer of Gieotencal warns Cortez of possible treachery but his warning is not heeded and the Spanish forces make a triumphal entry Into the city where they are received with great cere­ mony and rejoicing. In the final scenes of the play the Tlascalans accept Charles I of Spain as Charles I of Tlascala, Teutile is told to return to Montezuma to re­ port to him what he has seen, and Gieotencal and Alfa ^ are reunited. Thus Cortes trlunfante en Tlascala is brought to a happy if not logical close. 1 i Cordero has adhered fairly faithfully to historical j fact as presented by Gomara in his dramatization of that part of the conquest of Mexico which is encompassed within the I I confines of his play. The landing of the Spaniards on the coast of Tabasco, which is mentioned only indirectly in the ^ drama, the resignation of Cortez as leader of the expedition i I and his unanimous re-election, the founding of the city of I Vera Cruz, the arrival of Teudile and his conversation with Cortez with Marina acting as interpreter, the subsequent exchange of gifts between Cortez and Montezuma, all follow the historian’s account very closely. One interesting dis- I crepancy has been noted in the first act however, and that is that Cordero has Vera Cruz founded on the coast of Yucatan rather than in its actual location. The second act of the play, which has its action in the province of Tlascala, also contains much that is in accord with Gomara’s account. The decision of Cortez to send emissaries to the Tlascalan capital to request safe passage through that land, the debate in the Tlascalan senate over whether or not to grant the request, the final ! denial of the petition and the offering of armed resistance all appear in the same sequence as related by both Gomara and Diaz del Castillo. Most of the scenes of the final act are also reasonably accurate from a historical standpoint. The peace mission headed by Gieotencal which was sent by the i I Tlascalans to negotiate with Cortez, the simultaneous arrival of the Aztec mission headed by Teudile, Gieotencal’s invi- ' tation to enter the city and Teudile's warning against ac- i cepting it, Cortez' decision to accept the invitation, the entry of the Spaniards into the city and the lavish welcome accorded them by its inhabitants coincide with Gomara’s account of the same happenings. On the other hand neither ! Gomara nor Bernal Dfaz del Castillo mentions that Gieotencal went in disguise to the Spanish camp for the purpose of making peace, nor do they report that Alvarado warned Cortez of the possibility of defection among some of his men. | I j ; What has been said with regard to the historical ve- | racity of Cortes trlunfante en Tlascala applies only to those i ! scenes in which the Spaniards alone or in which the Spaniards I and the natives take part. The other scenes which purport to I dramatize events that took place in Tlascala prior to the ; arrival of the Spaniards and in which all of the characters | are necessarily natives are entirely imaginary. Zarate y Gastronovo’s La conauista de Mexico which takes up the conquest of Mexico with the landing of the Spaniards on the coast of Tabasco (in this respect it is identical with Cordero's play) and ends with the clash in jVera Cruz between Cortez and Fanfilo de Narvaez and the I imprisonment of the latter, is another of the dramas on a New World theme about which very little is known. Although I its author is mentioned briefly in some of the more complete histories of the Spanish drama, 1 have been unable to obtain any information concerning this particular play. (Not even Lopez de Gomara, Conauista de Mexico (Madrid, 1852), pp. 326-522. its title is included among the dramatist’s other works.) The present study of the play has been based upon a micro- ■film of an undated edition obtained from the British Mu­ seum. ! : It has already been pointed out in the introductory statement to this chapter that neither Cordero nor Zarate y I Castronovo was confronted with the need of justifying the character or actions of Cortez when they composed their plays in which he appears as the protagonist; and that Cordero was not concerned with the justification of the presence of Spain in Mexico. As much cannot be said for Zarate y Castronovo since throughout La conauista de Mexico references are made to the fact that the sole reason for the subjugation of the Aztec empire is to bring Christianity to the heathen native. The idea of material gain does not enter into the ' pn play at all. Frequently the characters in the play engage I in discussion of the reasons for the expedition, and while ithe minor characters unashamedly admit that their chief ^ On the concluding page of the microfilm (now on file in the library of the University of Southern California) the following information appears : Con liciencia: en Sevilla, por Manuel Nicolas Vasquez, en calle / de Genova, donde se haliara esta y otras muchas corregidas / por sus legftimes originales; y todo genero de surtido /de Intre- meses, Relaciones, y Romances.’ * 20 See chapter entitled The Motives for the Conquest for a more detailed discussion of this matter. ! 51 interest is a material one, Cortez states again and again that the conversion of the natives is important above all else. In the second act, for example, he informs Teudile that the Spaniards have come not to make war but rather to convert. The problem as to the source which provided Zarate y Castronovo with the historical data for Lg. conauista de MexiCO is much the same as the one encountered in the analy-I I sis of Cordero's play since again there is some evidence, as meager as it is, which leads to the conclusion that the dramatist based the action of his play on Gomara's account j of the conquest rather than on that of Dfaz del Castillo. Por example, a comparison of the passages in which Aguilar relates his experiences among the natives to Cortez reveals that they are almost identical in both Gomara and in the = I play while Dfaz del Castillo's account omits details common to the other two. A concrete example of this is to be found^ in that part of Aguilar's account which has to do with ! Valdivia who, it will be recalled, was a member of Juan de Grijalva's expedition. Whereas both the playwright and I Gomara state that he was taken captive, killed, and eaten by : the natives, Dfaz del Castillo merely mentions his name. ; The following comparison between this passage as it appears j I in Gomara and in the play will reveal the similarity between the two : 32 La conauista de Mexico Aguilar relates: Puimos presos de los indios y un cacique, que con rabia sacrlficando a Valdivia, que era un capitan de faina, asado se lo comio, y otros cuatro otra manana sirvieron en un comvite que hizo a su esposa Aglaura. (Act I) Gomara's history A Valdivia y otros cuatro sacrifice a sus fdolos un raalvado cacique, a cuyo goder venimos, ^ y despues se los comio, haciendo fiesta y plato dellos a otros indios. As a final word with regard to the sources of La conauista de Mexico it cannot go unnoticed that its title and that of Gomara‘s work are identical, nor can the fact be ignored that, as in Cordero's play, the spelling of the names of the native characters more closely approximates that of Gomara than it does that of Dfaz del Castillo as the following comparison will prove: ■The Plav Teudelli Qualpopoca Gomara Teudilli Cualpopoca Pfaz del Castillo Tendile Quetzalpopoca Lopez de Gomara, L§. conauista de Mexico (Mexico, , I, 304. Dfaz del Castillo's version of Aguilar's account is found in his Historia verdadera de la conauista de la Nueva Esoaha (Madrid, 1932), Vol. I, Ch. XXIX. 32 The characters that take part in the play are: Cortés Tapia Anasco Alvarado Fonseca Ortuno Panfilo de Narvaez Soldados espanoles Un sarçento Un alferez Aguilar Mariana Religion Christiana Guainacaba Moctezuma Teudelli Qualpopoca Tallemo Tricello Glasira Glaura Solrao Alcinda Cayeguani Marati Demon Un fdolo Indios MusiCO The following characters also appear in the play but are not listed among the dramatis personae : La Frovidencia La Idolatraa Diego de Soto The plot: The opening scenes of the play dramatize the disem­ barkation of Cortez and his men on the coast of Tabasco. No sooner have they landed than a heated discussion takes place between the two soldiers Anasco and Tapia with regard to the purpose of the conquest. Cortez has informed the men that they are not to take gold from the natives or even ask for it since the sole reason for the expedition is to bring Christianity to the idolatrous heathen. Tapia avers that he has not joined the forces of Cortez with the idea of enriching himself but rather to take part in the conversion of the benighted natives. Anasco replies that without the promise of gold he would not have departed a league from his house: Vive Dios que no sallera una legua de ml casa 54 si pensara que pus1era en esto del oro tasa. While the latter is engaged in an eloquent defense of his material desires Ortuno enters with three Indian maidens j whom he has captured. When one of these sees that the ! Spaniards apparently have no harmful intentions she \"beckons to the other natives to come forth from their ' hiding places; and Cortez, in order to gain the good will! of the people, distributes such things as combs, knives, | fish hooks, and mirrors. While the Indians are engaged in examining and marveling at the things that they have 1 received, the Spaniards plant the Cross on the shore. When the inhabitants see the symbol of the Christian religion they approach it and try to uproot it but are prevented from doing so by the Spaniards who open fire upon them. The sound of the muskets and the sight of the smoke that belches forth from them terrifies the natives who fall to the ground panic stricken. At this moment a dove appears and comes to rest on the Cross which now becomes a sacred object to the Indians who have witnessed the incident. Meanwhile the Spaniards have busied themselves with unloading the ships and setting up camp, and the nat.ives, who have again fled to the mountains, . watch with curiosity. In a moment of idleness some of the men complain of the hardships that they are called upon to endure and recall nostalgically the life of ease they have left behind in Spain. When the alferez says that no amount of gold they might discover can possibly repay them for the risks and hardships, he is reminded by one of the soldiers that Cortez has come to convert the heathen rather than for material gain. Cortez now appears and beckoning to the Indians to come down from their hiding places assures them that they will suffer I I no harm at the hands of his men. A few come forth and receive more gifts from the hands of Cortez who takes advantage of the moment to launch into a discussion of \\ \\ the nature of Christ and of the Holy Trinity. This dis- j course, which is not understood by the natives, is inter­ rupted by the arrival o/f Aguilar in a canoe. The latter is not recognized because of his native attire but once he has been taken to Cortez he is not long in proving his identity. Aguilar now relates that he and the other members of Grijalva's expedition had been shipwrecked I some years before and that he had been adopted by the natives and treated as one of them. At the end of his account Cortez embraces him and asks him to Join the expedition. In a scene that follows Cortez enters a temple which is near the Spanish encampment and orders that the Cross be planted in the midst of a group of idols. At the moment his order is carried out devils are seen scurrying out. One of the latter, more bold than the others, informs Cortez that if idolatry is driven from the land, the devils, dispossessed, will pass to Europe. The Indians who have witnessed this miracle are now convinced that the Spaniards are the representa­ tives of a more powerful deity than their own and rush to prostrate themselves before the Cross. Act Two begins with an allegorical scene in which Providence, Idolatry, and Christian Religion appear. Thé I latter claims the new lands for herself while Idolatry i asserts that any attempt to win the land will fail and | predicts that five hundred Spaniards will be sacrificed I to the native gods. This argument is cut short by the ■ sound of a commotion as the Spaniards and natives enter j fighting. The former led by Santiago are victorious and' the Indians, realizing that their force of some forty thousand men is no match for the Spanish forces led by a supernatural power, lay down their arms and flock to the' Spanish side to offer their services to Cortez. With Aguilar acting as interpreter Alican informs the Spanish leader that there is a great kingdom and vast quantities of gold in the interior of the land. At first the Spaniards show no interest in Alican's report but when they are informed of Moctezuma and his wealthy capital they ask for more details than the former can give. - - - - - . . . __ 57 Cortez then inquires if by chance there is one of pp , Moctezuma's subjects among those present, and Alican : replying in the affirmative has Teudelli sent for. The latter, richly dressed and with impressive accompaniment ‘ enters bearing gifts of gold and finely worked textiles ' p% for Cortez. Mariani, an Indian maiden converted to Christianity, addressing the Aztec ambassador in his own , tongue, requests that he convey the message to the ! I Emperor that the Spaniards have not come to make war but rather to convert the inhabitants of his empire to Christianity. Teudelli for his part warns Cortez of the dangers and difficulties that he will encounter if he j persists in carrying his campaign further into the j interior. Cortez is not impressed by this veiled warning and tells Soto that he is determined to continue: Yo he de hacer aunque me sepa perder, esta espantosa Jornada, yo he de ir a Mexico, Soto. When Soto replies that many of the men will desert if they learn of this intention, Cortez informs him that he' plans to scuttle the ships thus making escape impossible. pp The Spanish spelling of Montezuma’s name will be used when he is referred to as a character in the plays. The dramatist’s spelling of Marina will be used when reference is made to her as a character in the play. — Soto cannot believe what he has heard: Soto ^ iQue dices? Cortes Lo que has ofdo, parte al mar, y da barreno a las naves. Soto No condeno tu valor. Jamas vencido, pero mira que sin naves, a gran peligro te pones. Cortes No me ayude con razones, ve, Soto, que Dios me gufa. When Mariani reports that Teudelli has forbidden the Spaniards to advance further Cortez becomes more deter­ mined than before and calls his men together to make his intentions known to them. Various members of the expedition, stunned by the knowledge that there will be no turning back, argue in vain in favor of withdrawing: Tapia A cien raillones de hombres, dime, pones quinientos espanoles mal arraados. Alvar. Cortes, ^son de tu pecho essas razones o has perdido el sentido en los cuidados? Fonseca Si tuviese aquf los escuadrones de Carlos, en la Italia exercitados, en Francia, en Flandes, Alemania, Ungria, y Tunez, fuera Justa tu osadfa, pero con sels descalzos es locura. [ When the news is brought that the ships have been sunk, the Spaniards are filled with consternation. Cortes dis­ avows all responsibility for the deed: : Hi Jos, espanoles mfos, ‘ no tengo culpa yo, mas Dios quiere que volver no podamos. Upon hearing these words from their leader and realizing that any further thought of escape is futile, the men resolve to face a perilous future. Alvarado rallies them with the following: ; Heroiea hazana î ; a Mexico espanoles, viva Espana! ■ The third act opens in the palace of Moctezuma. When j Teudelli arrives with the news that the Spaniards will I I not turn back, the Emperor is overwhelmed since in it he sees the fulfillment of a prophecy that Mexico will be | conquered and he overthrown. After the order has been ! i given for the mustering of a million men, Moctezuma asks| Teudelli: ^Que es este espanol tan fuerte que aquf me ponga temor? &Como que el gran Moctezuma, senor del raundo, a qulen solo I desde su eclfptica Apolo i Reinos y Ciudades suma? ; A Moctezuma, de quien tiembla el mar en la ribera, donde primero en su esfera los rayos del sol se ven, y en el ifmite postrero cuya margen cubre de oro donde entre sangre, y tesoro, se ve naciendo el lucero? A Moctezuma, que adoran tres mil diversas Naciones, y a Mexico envfan dones del postrer reino en que moran? 6Que es este divino Apolo? un estranjero soldado | de solo codicia armado, tantos recelos me dio, mis reinos pisa atrevido y a rais rebeldes ajunta, [referring to the ya pgr Mexico^pregunta, -Tlascalans] de donde, o comg ha venido? 6Que hombre es este, Teudelli? Teudelli informs the Emperor of Cortez and in order to | j quell his fears assures him that the latter has not come I to overthrow his kingdom or rob him of his treasure, but^ rather to tell him of the great Charles of Spain and of j the Christian religion. When Teudelli leaves the scene i the sun god appears and tells Moctezuma to have no fears, about the future and advises him to increase the human | sacrifices and to bathe the altars of the temples with I human blood. The scene now shifts to the Spanish camp where Cortez has Just received a letter from Mariani warning him that an attempt will be made on his life. , j When Moctezuma receives word that his plot to kill the | Spanish leader has failed, he orders a hundred thousand pesos in gold sent to him with orders that he leave Mexico at once. Cortez accepts the bribe but disregards the order and advances on the Mexican capital supported by an array of ten thousand Indian enemies of Moctezuma. The latter realizing that further efforts to force the Spaniards to leave his country are useless, advances to meet them. The meeting between the Mexican Emperor and ' Cortez, a most dramatic one, is climaxed when the Spanish leader is refused permission to embrace Mocte­ zuma. Teudelli warns the Spaniard: No se toca a nuestro Rey, que hay entre nosotroa ley, que no se puede tocar. When the Emperor retires with his retinues Tapia appears to inform Cortez that the news of his successful enter­ prise has reached the ears of Diego Velasquez, Governor of Cuba, and that the latter. Jealous of his success, has dispatched an expedition of ten ships and a thousand men for the purpose of impeding further advance of the con­ quest. Moctezuma who has been made a prisoner because of his attempt on Cortez' life is now brought before the latter to whom he offers a fortune in gold as his ransom. He addresses Cortez as follows: Cortes, yo te dare tanto rescate, que no puedan llevar naves el oro, y lo dexes sembrado en las orillas. This offer makes no impression on the Spanish leader who well realizes that the gold will be his without con- i senting to the release of the Emperor. Moctezuma, noting the impassivity of Cortez in response to his offer, | informs him that he will become a Christian and a vassal i of Charles V in return for his freedom. The scene now | shifts to the coast where Cortez and his men are engaged | in battle with the forces of Panfilo de Narvaez. When | I the former emerges victorious Narvaez realizes that he has more to gain through Joining forces with Cortez than through continuing to resist him and exhorts his men to accept Cortez as their leader. An allegorical scene | brings La. conauista de Mexico to a close. A cart appears in which Christian Religion is riding and behind which Idolatry is being dragged. When the vehicle reaches the place where Cortez is standing it stops, and Religion places the laurel of victory on his head. Cortez then mounts the cart and taking his place beside Religion is drawn triumphantly from the stage. In LsL conauista de Mexico Zarate y Castronovo has combined a fairly accurate dramatization with a good deal of Lonvincing fiction in his presentation of some of the major events in the subjugation of New Spain from the landing of the Spaniards in 1518 on the shores of that country to the armed encounter between the forces of Cortez and those of Panfilo de Narvaez. It is of interest to note that the ! I I dramatist has telescoped several important historical epi­ sodes in order to make them fit into the framework of his i play, and has on one occasion at least improved upon the |Lruth for the purpose of simplifying the action and adding , |to the element of suspense. A good example of the con- | I ' densation of historical material is found in the fact that ! ! phe action is transferred from the coast of Tabasco directly, I to the Valley of Mexico omitting entirely the involved | ' I Tlascalan interlude. The reason for the omission of this i important phase of the conquest is not hard to understand since it would be manifestly impossible to compress all of even the most salient events within the confines of a single Lay. An example of the dramatist's dexterity in the manipu­ lation of fact to suit the needs of his play is to be found Ln the scene in which he has Marina write Cortez that Montezuma is planning an attempt on his life, and further­ more, has the Spanish leader use this information as an excuse to make the Mexican Emperor a prisoner. According to jcervantes de Salazar, it is true that Cortez used the pre- | itext that Montezuma was plotting against the Spaniards as an j I pll ! ^excuse for making him a captive but according to Cervantes I jde Salazar, the Mexican Emperor was not guilty of these par­ ticular charges, and, in an endeavor to prove his innocence, dad the real plotters brought before him for accusation and ithen turned them over to Cortez who had them put to death. jconvenient fiction also is Marina's letter of warning to ' Cortez since none of the historians whose works have been ! consulted mention that any correspondence ever passed be­ tween them. There is very little in the first act' of La conauista' de Mexico that can be termed historical aside from the Lccount of the arrival of Aguilar and his recital of his life Cervantes de Salazar, Cronica de la Nueva Esoaha | (Madrid, 1914), 328-29. j 25 Ibid.. pp. 354-56. i among the natives, which is essentially the same in both the I / o fi drama and in Gomara's history. On the other hand, the ! second act, apart from its allegorical opening, contains I much that is historical. Although fictitious characters are Introduced, the meeting of Cortez and T e u d i l e , the former's determination to scuttle the ships and the carrying but of this decision in spite of the dissatisfaction of the men,2^ as well as the preparations for the march^^ to the ! Mexican capital are all a matter of record. The first scenes of the third act are imaginary, as are all of the scenes in which the Spaniards do not appear. The meeting of I Montezuma and Cortez, however, is impressive in its faithful i ‘ reproduction of Gomara's account of that historical en­ counter . Identical also with Gomara is the final scene in which Narvaez is defeated and goes over to Cortez' side. 26 Lopez de 1852), pp 303“ 04. 27 Ibid. , P 28 Ibid. , P 29 Ibid. , P 30 Ibid. , P 31 Ibid. , P The third and final play of the Cortez cycle, El valeroso espanol % primero de su casa. is one of the ten jfcnown comedias of Caspar de Avila whose name, although well enough known during his life time, has in modern times all out been forgotten.

This statement together with what Information the play itself contains on the subject leads to the opinion that de Avila's j reason for writing El valeroso esoanol was to clear his lero's name of charges of treason and dishonesty. What has been said regarding the lack of information concerning the date of composition and editions of this play holds equally true with respect to the sources from which the dramatist drew his material for the portrayal of the character of Cortez and the dramatization of the various events in his life from the time he returned to Spain in L527 to his reerabarkation for New Spain in 1530. There is nothing in the play which would point to one source in preference to another. El valeroso esoahol is far removed in space if not in time from the scenes of its protagonist's greatest triumphs. The setting is Spain and the year 1530. Nine years have passed since the death struggle of the mighty empire of Montezuma and during that brief period of time Cortez has gone about unceasingly bringing all of the tributary peoples under the Spanish yoke. With each new conquest successfully completed, the conqueror of New Spain has found himself a step nearer the pinnacle of fame, his power undisputed, his Wealth immeasurable. However, the achievement of power and riches which earned for Cortez the envy and admiration of !the European world were at the same time to bring him the feeling of failure and disillusionment that he had never come to know during the years of physical encounter with the enemy on the field of battle. According to Gomara, the jealousy of those who were near the King was responsible for many serious charges being brought against Cortez. Among the most persistent of those who were determined to undermine his standing at court was Fanfilo de Narvaez who had carried with him on his return to Spain a full report of how Cortez had tricked Diego Velasquez and how he had flouted royal orders and had committed treason in order to carry to its successful conclusion the conquest i of New Spain. He was also accused of failing to set aside a j fifth of the captured treasure for the royal coffers, and it j ‘ j had been rumored that he had found the treasure of Guatemozini and had kept it all for himself. Finally, and most serious jof all, there were rumors that Cortez had surrounded himself | with regal splendor and that he was on the point of having I \"Xg , himself proclaimed emperor of New Spain.These reports , did not fail to impress Charles V who was none too satis- ' 1 t fled with the amount of wealth he had received as a result ! I I of the conquest. A commissioner, therefore, was sent to I 55 These charges are mentioned briefly by Gomara (pp.. pit.. (Madrid, I852), pp. 420^21, and by Dfaz del Castillo in detail in his Historia verdadera de. la. conauista de la Nueva Esoana (Madrid, 1933), Vol II, Ch. CLXVIII. Mexico to investigate the rumors about Cortez. When the com­ missioner died suddenly and under mysterious circumstances shortly after his arrival in the Mexican capital and the j I word was spread that Cortez had poisoned him, the latter de-I tided to go to Spain to defend himself. Two ships were out­ fitted and after a forty days' voyage anchor was dropped at jbhe port of Palos in December, 1527- Passing through I Seville where throngs received him as a returning hero--the journey was one of triumph since the name of the conqueror had already become a legend in the minds of the people-- Gortez reached Madrid a short while later. To add to the laurels of his fame, the intrepid Spaniard completely won the hearts of the people with his distinguished appearance, dis courtly manners and, above all, with his profuse gener­ osity, Once in the Spanish capital, Cortez sought an ; jaudience with the King which was granted without delay since, Ithe latter was eager to hear from the lips of the conqueror ! 1 himself the story of the subjugation of the Mexican empire. | Lfter he had enumerated the many services he had performed tn the name of His Majesty and had satisfactorily vindicated' himself of the charges of those whose jealousy had prompted | jthem to do him harm at court, Cortez was ordered to rise, j and the Monarch, satisfied with the manner in which he had j Acquitted himself, bestowed upon him the title of the Marquis of the Valley. With his title Cortez received rich estates with which to uphold the dignity of his position and in addition was named Captain General of New Spain. The conquest of Cortez was now complete since he was not only bhe conqueror of half a world but also a man of title, wealth and renown whose favor at court gave him an enviable influ­ ence throughout Spain. It ^s therefore not surprising that lis request for the hand of the beautiful and accomplished liece of the Duke of BeJar was eagerly accepted. (Cortez lad become a widower a short while before he embarked for Spain.) The nuptials of the battle-worn but still handsome warrior and Dona Juana were celebrated in a brilliant cere­ mony attended by the King and Queen and the loftiest nobles of the realm. The luxurious and idle life at court soon began to weary Cortez however, and he found himself longing for the New World and for the adventures and risks to which he was so accustomed. Finally, in 1530 he and his Marchioness set sail for New Spain where they arrived on July 15 of that I 3 7 year.
