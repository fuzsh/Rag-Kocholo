He also served on the Board of Directors of Elderhostel, the National Committee to Preserve Social Security and Medicare, the American Association of Retired Persons (AARP) Foundation.\n\n*Updates from Previous Articles*\n\nJudge Alberto Diaz: U.S. Circuit Judge for the 4th Circuit in Richmond , Virginia (Confirmed December 2010) (See August 2010 issue of Somos Primos for complete biography)\n\nDavid Lopez: U.S. General Counsel of Equal Employment Opportunity Commission in the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission Department Note: (See June 2010 issue of Somos Primos for complete biography)\n\nNOTE: President Obama nominated David Lopez on Oct. 22, 2009.

He was given a recess appointment on March 27, 2010, Confirmation by the full Senate December 2010)\n\nHispanic Representation Up To 1960\n\nFrom 1900 to 1960, only seventeen Hispanic Americans served in Congress. However, nine of these representatives were Resident Commissioners of Puerto Rico, who did not have voting privileges. Seven more delegates represented New Mexico . Not until 1936 did the first American-born Latino serve a full term in the U.S. Senate. Dennis Chávez, a Democrat, represented his New Mexico constituency for 27 years until his death in 1962.\n\nThe Tide Changes in California\n\nBy 1960, the number of Hispanics living in the United States had reached 6.9 million, which represented roughly 3.9% of the total population of the country. Approximately 1.5 million Hispanics lived in California representing more than 9% of the California population, but 20% of these Hispanics were foreign-born, many of whom were not naturalized and, as a result, were not eligible to vote. As a result, not a single one of California s 38 seats in Congress was held by a Chicano representative in 1960.\n\nAs the new decade commenced, there were still no Chicanos in the California State Senate, the Assembly or in the California Congressional delegation. There was no representation of the Mexican-American population in any part of California , primarily because of political fracturing of Chicano communities. In the early 1960s, the Chicano community of East Los Angeles was fractured into six separate Congressional districts and, before 1962 none of these districts sent a person with a Spanish surname to the House of Representatives.\n\nNovember 1962 Election\n\nThe redistricting that took place in 1961 created a Congressional district, which would pave a way for Edward Roybal to run for Congress. In the November 1962, Roybal defeated the Republican candidate for the 30th District, Gordon McDonough, to become the first Hispanic from California to be elected to Congress since the 1879 election of Romualdo Pacheco to California s 4th Congressional District. Edward Roybal took his seat in the House of Representatives on January 3, 1963 at the start of the 88th U.S. Congress. He would serve for thirty years from the 88th Congress to the 102nd Congress, retiring on January 3, 1993.\n\nTexas Representation\n\nUp to 1960, Congressional redistricting and reapportionment in the State of Texas had been very unfavorable to Tejano and African-American representation. In 1965, a Federal Court held Texas  Congressional Districting act to be unconstitutional and stated that the Texas Legislature must redraw the Texas Congressional Districts in compliance with Wesberry v. Sanders. This would set the stage for a new era of Tejano representation to Congress.\n\nHenry B. González\n\nIn 1961, Congressman Paul Kilday, a Democrat, was appointed to the federal bench by President John F. Kennedy. This left his congressional seat with the 20th District vacant. In a special election to fill that seat, Henry B. González (1916-2000), a native of San Antonio , was elected, winning by a margin of 10,000 votes, becoming the first Mexican-American representative to the U.S. Congress from Texas since statehood. Senator González served as a Congressional Representative from 1961 to 1999 (the 87th to the 105th Congresses).\n\nThe Elimination of Voting Barriers\n\nWith the ratification of the 24th Amendment on January 23, 1964, the U.S. Congress helped to bring an end to the Texas poll tax, which had been adopted early in the century. Stating that the right of citizens to vote shall not be denied or abridged by reason of failure to pay any poll tax, the Amendment laid the legal foundation for ending the tax and opening the voting polls to all Texas citizens, Hispanic, Black or White.\n\nIn addition, the signing of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 by President Johnson in 1965 took steps to eliminate any standard, practice, or procedure, including redistricting plans, which resulted in denial or abridgement of the right of any citizen of the United States to vote on account of race or color. This act would have far-reaching consequences for the political representation of Latinos in the coming decades.\n\nKika de la Garza\n\nAfter serving six consecutive terms as a representative in Austin , Eligio Kika de la Garza (born 1927) was elected in 1964 to the U.S. House of Representatives to represent Texas  15th Congressional District, which primarily included the southern towns of McAllen , Edinburg and Kingsville . When the 89th Congress convened in 1965, Representative de la Garza took his seat as a Democrat, effectively ending a thirteen-year career in the Texas House of Representatives. Kika would serve in Congress from January 3, 1965 until the January 3, 1997 (the 89th to 104th Congresses).\n\nA New Decade (the 1970s)\n\nIn 1970, California had a total population of 19,971,069 persons. Of this total, 2,369,292 were Hispanics, who made up 10.8% of the states total population. Of the 2.4 million Hispanics living in California , 490,892 were foreign-born, making up 22.9% of the total Hispanic population. A significant number of the foreign-born residents had never been naturalized and were therefore ineligible for American voting privileges. This represented a significant stumbling block in electing Chicanos to Congress. As a result, Edward Roybal represented the only Chicano sitting among the 43 California Representatives in Congress after the 1971 reapportionment.\n\nIn 1970, Texas had only two representatives: Henry B. González represented Bexar County s 20th District, while Kika de la Garza represented the 15th District of the southern border area. Puerto Rico was represented by Resident Commissioner Jorge Luis Córdova Díaz, who served during the 91st and 92nd Congresses (January 3, 1969 to January 3, 1973).\n\nIn New Mexico , Manuel Luján, Jr. served as Representative of the First District, while Joseph Manuel Montoya served in the U.S. Senate. Senator Montoya would continue to serve his state as Senator from the 87th to 91st Congresses (November 3, 1964 to January 3, 1977).\n\nProgress during the 1970s\n\nThe 1970s represented new opportunities for Chicano candidates. The beginning of true Hispanic representation would be established during this decade. In 1970, Herman Badillo (born 1929), a native of Puerto Rico, was elected to the U.S. House of Representatives from New Yorks 21st District in the South Bronx., becoming the first Congressman born in Puerto Rico to represent a district in the continental United States. Congressman Badillo would serve as Representative for his district from the 92nd to 95th Congresses (January 3, 1971 to December 31, 1977).\n\nThe 1980s\n\nAccording to the 1980 census, Hispanic Americans increased their numbers to 14,608,673 persons at the turn of the decade and now represented 6.4% of the national population. As their numbers began to increase, the political representation of Latinos took small strides forward. In Texas , the Hispanic population had reached 2,985,824, representing 21% of the total state population of 14,225,513. However, in spite of this impressive demographic event, only two of Texas  24 Representative seats in Congress were occupied by Tejanos: Henry B González and Kika de la Garza.\n\nPuerto Rico was represented in Congress by Resident Commissioner Baltasar Corrada del Río (born 1935), who would continue to serve in that capacity from the 95th through the 98th Congresses (January 3, 1977 to January 3, 1985). In New Mexico , with the end of Senator Joseph Manuel Montoyas Senate career, Manuel Luján, Jr. served as the sole Hispanic representative of the people of that state.\n\nIn New York State , Representative Badillo had resigned in 1978 to become Deputy Mayor of New York City . A special election to fill his position brought Robert Garcia (born 1933), a Bronx native, to Congress.\n\nIleana Ros-Lehtinen\n\nThe 1980s were notable for the election of Ileana Ros-Lehtinen (born 1952) who became the first Hispanic woman and Cuban-American elected to Congress. A native of Havana , Cuba , Ileana had immigrated to the United States when she was seven years old. In 1989, Ros-Lehtinen was elected to represent Florida s 18th District, becoming the first Hispanic elected to represent Florida in 166 years.\n\nThe 1990s\n\nFrom the 101st Congress in 1990 to the 105th Congress in 1999, the representation of Latinos in Congress increased from 11 to 19.\n\nThe increase in political representation, which was also manifested in several state legislatures, took place as qualified Latino candidates stepped forward to run for offices in states where they had previously held little or no political power. In most cases, these candidates won elections by developing coalitions that crossed ethnic and racial lines.\n\nThe first Latino Representative from the State of Illinois , Luis Gutiérrez, was elected as the Representative of Chicagos Fourth District in the General Election of 1992. A native of Chicago , Representative Gutiérrez had worked as a teacher, social worker and alderman on the Chicago City Council before his election to the One Hundred and Ninth Congress.\n\nIn New Jersey , Robert Menéndez, a native of New York City and the son of Cuban immigrants, was elected in 1992 with 64% of the vote to the U.S. House of Representatives, becoming the first Hispanic from New Jersey to serve in Congress. Representative Menéndez eventually rose to become the third-highest ranking Democrat in the U.S. House of Representatives before moving on to the Senate in 2006. Today, Robert Menéndez continues to serve in the U.S. Senate.\n\nThe New Millennium (19 Latino Congressional Representatives)\n\nOn November 7, 2000, the first General Election of the New Millennium took place. Before the election, nineteen Hispanic Congressional Representatives served from seven states: California (6 Representatives), Texas (6), New York (2), Florida (2), Arizona (1), Illinois (1) and New Jersey (1). Fifteen of the nineteen Representatives were Democrats, while four were Republicans.\n\nHowever, by the time the votes had been tallied up from the General Election, it became apparent that Latino representation in Congress would remain at 19, with no significant gains by the group over the previous election in 1998.\n\nThe Election of 2002 (22 Latino Congressional Representatives)\n\nAfter the November 5, 2002 General Election, Latino representation in Congress would increase from 19 to 22. Although Hispanic representation in Congress would remain confined to seven states, some of those states saw a modest increase in their Latino representation: California (7 representatives), Texas (6), Florida (3), Arizona (2), New York (2), Illinois (1) and New Jersey (1).\n\nThe Election of November 2004 (25 Latino Congressional Representatives)\n\nThe Election of November 2, 2004 represented a watershed in Latino political representation, as it brought two Hispanic Senators into that house of Congress, which had not seen a Latino in its chambers since Joseph Montoya had left office in New Mexico 27 years earlier.\n\nA fifth-generation Coloradan, Ken Salazar had served as Colorado s Attorney General for six years before running for the office of Senator. In the General Election of 2004, Salazar, who came from a long line of farmers in the San Luis Valley , was elected to serve as Senator of Colorados 3rd Congressional District. At the same time, his brother John Salazar became Colorado s first Latino to serve in the House of Representatives.\n\nAlso in 2004, Mel Martinez, formerly the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, was elected to serve as the first Latino U.S. Senator from the State of Florida . Ironically, New Mexico , which had been represented in Congress by Latinos almost continuously between 1853 and 1997, had no Hispanic representation in either the Senate or the House. In both California and Texas , all of the incumbents had held onto their seats.\n\nOverall, Latino representation in the U.S. Congress reached its highest point in history, with the following numbers:\n\nArizona (2 Representatives)\n\nCalifornia (7 Representatives)\n\nColorado (1 Senator, 1 Representative)\n\nFlorida (1 Senator, 3 Representatives)\n\nIllinois (1 Representative)\n\nNew Jersey (1 Representative)\n\nNew York (2 Representatives)\n\nTexas (6 Representatives)\n\nThe victories of the incumbents and challengers brought the representation of Latinos to 25 at the start of 2005, a significant jump from the six Congressional Representatives who were serving twenty-five years earlier (1980)\n\nThe Election of November 2006 (26 Latino Congressional Representatives)\n\nIn November 2006, the number of Hispanic citizens eligible to vote reached 17.2 million, or 8.6% of the total electorate, a slight increase from the 2004 figure of 8.2%. In the U.S. Senate, Robert Menendez won election to serve his first full term as the nations first Latino U.S. Senator from New Jersey . As a result, for the first time in history, three Latinos were serving in the U.S. Senate.\n\nIn the U.S. House, all Latino Democratic incumbents won their re-election campaigns. And they were joined by State Representative Albio Sires (D-NJ), who gained the seat formerly held by Robert Menendez before he was appointed to the U.S. Senate. All three Latino Republican incumbents in Florida were also successful in their re-election bids, meaning that the number of Latino Representatives in the House remained at 23 (20 Democrats and 3 Republicans\n\nThe Election of November 2008 (27 Latino Congressional Representatives)\n\nThe William C. Velásquez Institute reported that, by the time of the November 2008 Presidential election, the Latino electorate had grown to an estimated 12.1 million registered voters. Ultimately, 9.7 million Latinos cast votes in the election, representing a 79.85% turnout figure. The Latinos also represented 7.43% of all votes cast in the United States during that election.\n\nIn the November 2008 election, all Latino incumbents won their re-election campaigns. They were joined by Ben R. Lujan, a Democrat, who became the first Latino to represent New Mexico in Congress since Governor Bill Richardsons tenure in Congress had ended a decade earlier. With Lujans addition to the House, there were now 24 Latinos serving as voting members of the U.S. House of Representatives.\n\nHowever, by the end of January 2009, the number of Hispanics in the U.S. Senate decreased from three to two, with the resignation of Ken Salazar ( Colorado ) to join President Obamas cabinet as U.S. Secretary of the Interior. Bob Menendez, D-NJ, and Mel Martinez, R-FL, continued to occupy the Senatorial seats that they had won.\n\nWith Salazars resignation, the number of Latino Congressmen dropped back to 26 representatives.\n\nThe Election of November 2010 (26 Latino Congressional Representatives)\n\nAccording to the national House exit poll in November 2010, Latinos represented the same share of all voters that they did in 2006 (8%). The number of eligible Latino voters had increased to 19 million, representing more than 9% of all eligible voters nationwide.\n\nOn November 3, 2010, the National Association of Latino Elected and Appointed Officials (NALEO) reported that when the 112th Congress convenes in January 2011, it will have a record number of Latino Republicans in the U.S. House. The New York Times, commenting on this trend, reported that Latinos won an unprecedented voice in the Republican Party with the election of more Latino Republicans than ever before -- sometimes without the support of Latino voters.\n\nIn all, there will be five new GOP Hispanic members of the House: two from Texas (Bill Flores of Bryan and Francisco Canseco of San Antonio ); Jaime Herrera of Camas, Washington (the first Latino to represent that state); Raul Labrador from the Idaho district that includes Boise , and David Rivera of the Miami area of Florida .\n\nIn addition, former Florida House Speaker Marco Rubio was also elected to the Senate and would become the one and only Hispanic Republican member of the U.S. Senate since Senator Mel Martínez had retired from the seat in August 2009. With the election of Rubio to the Senate and the upset victory of Republican Bill Flores over Democratic Representative Chet Edwards, a 10-term incumbent in Texas , there will now be a total of eight Latino Republicans in the House and Senate.\n\nThe eight Hispanic Republican Congressmen will join 18 Latino Democrats, three fewer than before (after the election losses of Representatives Ciro D. Rodríguez and Solomon P. Ortiz in Texas and Representative John Salazar in Colorado ). This would bring the total number of Latino Congressional Representatives in the new congress to 26.\n\nSome of the most impressive milestones are noted here:\n\nIn Idaho s First District, Republican Raúl Labrador becomes the first Latino to represent that state in the U.S. Congress. In Washington State s Third District, Representative Jaime Lynn Herrera, a Republican, becomes the states first Latina to represent the state in the U.S. Congress, defeating businessman Danny Heck. NALEOs press release observed the same trends that the New York Times had noticed, reporting that several of these candidates successfully ran in districts which do not have Latino majorities, demonstrating that Latinos are able to run in non-Latino districts and can have broad appeal across all ethnicities and communities.\n\nIn addition to proving that many Latino candidates have broad appeal across ethnic and social lines, the November 2010 gave Latinos Congressional representation in more states than ever before: California , Florida , Texas , Idaho , Washington , Illinois , New Mexico , New Jersey and New York .\n\nPrimary Sources:\n\nFenner, Louise, Hispanic Voters and Candidates Influence U.S. Elections, November 5, 2010, Online:\n\nhttp://www.america.gov/st/democracyhr-english/2010/November/20101105185027esiuol0.2705347.html\n\nGonzalez, Antonio and Ochoa, Steven, The Latino Vote in 2008: Trends and Characteristics (Los Angeles, William C.

From a point of virtually no representation in 1950 to the most recent elections of 2010, Latinos have steadily gained representation in a wide range of states across the country. Their progress in some states has been dramatic and impressive, while in other states it has been slow, erratic and inconsistent. The more recent gains of the last three decades are clear indicators of the growth of the Latino population in many states beyond its so-called traditional homeland in the Southwestern United States. Some of the highlights of the Latino struggle for political representation are discussed below.\n\nRestrictions on the Latino Vote\n\nIn 1901, the Texas Legislature passed a poll tax, requiring voters to pay $1.75 at the voting booth. In November 1902, Texas voters ratified the poll tax by a two-to-one margin. For the next six decades, the poll tax would be very effective in keeping poor Latinos from participating in the electoral process.\n\nIn addition to the poll tax, the primary means of limiting minority representation in Texas, California and other states was the process of gerrymandering. In many parts of the U.S., state legislatures would divide a county or city into oddly shaped representational districts to give political advantage to one group or another in elections. Gerrymandering resulted in voter dilution, in which the political representation of a unified minority was diminished or altogether obstructed. The end result was that even districts containing a majority of Latinos in some parts of the United States were unable to elect Hispanic representatives for many decades.\n\nA New Breed\n\nIn the devastation and uncertainty of World War II (1939-1945), a new breed of Latinos was created. Fighting alongside their Anglo brothers, hundreds of thousands of young Mexican-Americans and Puerto Ricans had taken part in the battle against the tyranny and oppression of Nazi Germany and Imperial Japan. With the end of the war, these young veterans came home to a state where their rights as citizens were not always recognized and  in some cases  blatantly violated. These proud young veterans, having fought to defend their native land, believed it was time to assert their rights as American citizens.\n\nBut added to that pride was the reward that survivors were given for their wartime service. The G.I. Bill made it possible for thousands of Latino veterans to attend college and make a better life for themselves. The G.I. Bill Act of June 22, 1944  or the Servicemens Readjustment Act  put higher education within the reach of thousands of minority veterans. The Veterans' Readjustment Assistance Act of 1952 provided similar privileges to Korean War veterans.\n\nOver the next decade, Latino veterans attended local and nationwide colleges and universities to obtain college degrees. In many cases, these vets were the first members of their families to receive a higher education. Armed with the weapon of education, many of these veterans became the Chicano leaders of the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s.\n\n1952: 22 Hispanic State Legislators\n\nIn 1952, 22 Hispanic representatives were serving as legislators in state houses in the following four states: New Mexico (19 legislators), Arizona (one legislator), Colorado (1) and Texas (1). It is not surprising that New Mexico had a considerable number of Latino legislators at this time because a significant number of the states inhabitants were descended from the pre-1848 population that had lived in the area since the Seventeenth and Eighteenth Centuries. In the case of Texas, the lone Latino, Arnold J. Vale, representing the 74th District (Rio Grande, Starr County) served in the Texas Legislature from 1937 to 1947 and from 1949 to 1955. He would soon be joined by others.\n\nHispanic Representation in Texas (1952-1960)\n\nIn 1952, Eligio (Kika) de la Garza, a native of Hidalgo County and a World War II veteran, ran for office in the 38th District of Hidalgo County, recently created by the 1951 redistricting process. When Arnold Vales term expired in 1955, de la Garza would be the only Hispanic legislator in Texas. However, in 1957, Kika was joined by Oscar M. Laurel, a native of Laredo and another World War II veteran. Laurel represented Laredos 80th District in Webb County and, during his tenure, would also serve as the National President of the League of United Latin American Citizens (LULAC).\n\nIn 1959, Kika de la Garza and Oscar M. Laurel were joined by a third Chicano representative in the Texas House. Mauro Rosas became El Pasos first Tejano representative to Austin during the Twentieth Century. Representing the 105th District, Position 3, Rosas would serve in this capacity for two legislative sessions.\n\nIn 1956, Henry Barbosa Gonzalez broke down another barrier to Mexican-American political representation in Texas. Enrique Barbosa González, a native of San Antonio, took office in 1957 as the first Mexican American elected to the Texas Senate in the Twentieth Century. Senator Gonzalez would serve from 1957 to 1961, before moving on to the U.S. Congress in 1962.\n\nThe Texas Legislature in the Early 1960s\n\nThe 57th Texas Legislative Session marked a turning point for Tejano political representation. From one representative (Arnold J. Vale) in the 52nd Session (starting in January 1951) to the 57th session (starting in January 1961), Hispanic representation increased to seven legislators (one senator and six representatives). While Kika de la Garza (Hidalgo County) and Rosas (El Paso) continued to serve their respective constituencies, four new representatives took their seats in the House:\n\nVidal M. Trevino (80th District, Laredo) replaced Representative Oscar Laurel\n\nJohn C. Alaniz (68th District, San Antonio)  the first Latino to serve Bexar County\n\nRudy Esquivel (68th District, Position 2, San Antonio)\n\nRaul L. Longoria (38th District, Position 1, Pharr, Hidalgo County)\n\nThe representation of Tejanos would continue to increase in the following years. More detailed discussion of the Texas Legislature and elections in the 1960s can be accessed at the following link: http://www.houstonculture.org/hispanic/tejanorepprint.html\n\n1962: 35 Hispanic State Legislators\n\nBetween 1952 and 1962, the number of Latino representatives in the state legislatures increased from 22 to 35. During this period, the number of Hispanic legislators in New Mexico had increased from 19 to 24, but most impressive was the jump from one state representative to six representatives in the State of Texas (By this time, Henry González had left the Texas Senate for the U.S. Congress.)\n\nArizona in the 1960s\n\nIn Arizona, a large influx of elected Latinos would take place during the 1960s. By 1962 their representation in the Arizona Legislature had already increased to three (from one representative in 1952). During the 1960s, the following Hispanic representatives would take their seats within the Arizona Legislature:\n\nEmilio V. Carrillo served in the Arizona House of Representatives from 1959 to 1961 and 1972 to 1979.\n\nRamon Gallego Michelena, State Senator from Santa Cruz County (1961-1964)\n\nJoe D. Ybarra, Democratic Representative, serving District 14 (Pima County) from 1961 to 1966\n\nTony S. Carrillo, Democratic Representative, serving District 2 (Tucson, Pima County) from 1963 to 1968\n\nDavid M. Valenzuela, Senator from District 6 (Phoenix, Maricopa County), elected to serve from 1964 to 1966\n\nLeonard M. Calderon, Jr., Senator from District 10 (Phoenix, Maricopa County) elected to serve in 1965\n\nJoe Castillo, State Senator from District 7-A (Pima County) elected to serve in 1967\n\nTony Abril, Democratic Representative from District 8-G (Maricopa County), served from 1967 to 1970 and 1973 to 1982\n\nManuel Lito Peña, Jr., Democratic Representative from Phoenix 1967 to 1972 and State Senator from 1972 to 1996\n\nCalifornia in the 1960s\n\nIn the June 5, 1962 California Primary Election, eleven Chicano candidates ran for office in the California Assembly. However, by the time the votes were tallied from the November 6 General Election, only two men would take their seats in the California Assembly. John Moreno and Philip Soto became the first two Latinos from Los Angeles County to be elected to the California State Legislature in the Twentieth Century. They were also the first Latinos to be elected to serve in the State Assembly since the election of Miguel Estudillo of Riverside County in 1907. The election of these two men set a precedent for a long line of Latino legislators committed to the service of their communities. But progress would be limited and sporadic over the next two decades.\n\nIn the 1964 elections, only Philip Soto was left in office. Assemblyman Moreno had been opposed by another Chicano candidate, Dionisio Morales. This contest split the Chicano vote and led to victory in the Democratic Primary by Jack Fenton, effectively ending Morenos political tenure.\n\nIn the 1966 elections, fifteen Chicanos ran for positions on the Assembly and all of them lost. Even, the one Latino incumbent Philip Soto lost his bid for re-election. Another nine Latinos ran for State Senate seats, and all of them lost as well. The result was that the California Legislature  once again  did not have a single Mexican-American in the Assembly or the Senate. Only the election of Alex Garcia to the 40th Assembly District in 1968 brought Latinos back to the California Legislature.\n\n1970: 59 Hispanic State Legislators\n\nBetween 1962 and 1970, the representation of Latinos in State Legislatures increased from 35 to 59. By this time, California had two Latino legislators and Colorado was experiencing a renewal with four legislators (up from zero in 1962). New Mexico still held the largest number of Latino representatives (36), followed by Texas, which now had an unprecedented 12 representatives in both state houses.\n\nHispanic Representation in Minnesota\n\nIn 1977, Conrado (Conrad) M. Vega, a native of South Saint Paul, became the first known Hispanic to serve in the Minnesota Legislature. Serving as the Democratic Senator for District 52 (Dakota and Washington counties), Senator Vega was of Mexican ancestry (St. Paul Pioneer Press, June 13, 2004) and had previously worked as a social studies high school teacher. Mr. Vega served Senate District 52 from 1977 to 1982 and Senate District 39 from 1983 to 1986.\n\nTwo years after Vega took office, Frank Rodriguez, Sr. became the first known Hispanic to serve in the Minnesota House of Representatives. A native of Sheridan, Wyoming and the son of Mexican immigrants (Union Advocate, July 2, 1979), Mr. Rodriguez served as the Representative for District 67A from 1979 to 1982 and District 65B from 1983 to 1984. A resident of St. Paul, Rodriguez served constituents in Dakota and Ramsey counties.\n\nWith the departure of Senator Vega after 1986, Minnesota would have no Hispanic legislators until 1991, when both Carlos Mariani and Edwina Garcia took their respective seats in the Minnesota House of Representatives.\n\nRepresentation in Kansas\n\nPaul Feleciano, Jr., a native of New York City, was first elected as a Democrat to the Kansas House of Representatives in 1973. He served in the House from 1973 to 1976 and then moved on to the State Senate, where he represented the 28th District (Wichita, Sedgwick County) from 1977 to 2003. Feleciano served two terms as President of the National Hispanic Caucus of State Legislators and in the fall of 2003 resigned his Senate seat to accept an appointment by Governor Kathleen Sebelius.\n\nIn 1983, Alfred Ramirez was elected to serve as the Republican Representative of the 40th District (Bonner Springs) in the Kansas House. In 1993, Ramirez moved from the House to the Senate, where he served until 1996. In 1989, George Gomez  an attorney  became the third Hispanic state legislator when he took office as a Democratic Representative of Topekas District 57 (Shawnee County).\n\nChicano Representation in the California Legislature (1980-1990)\n\nBy 1980, Chicano representation in California had finally gained some traction in spite of its lethargic start in the 1960s. After the November 1980 elections had ended, there were seven Hispanic representatives in both of Californias Houses: two senators and five Assemblymen. However, progress towards true representation remained painfully slow and by 1985 there were still only seven Latinos in the state legislature, making up only 6% of the total membership.\n\nEssentially, the Latino community of California remained disenfranchised, when one considers that Hispanics represented 26% of the California population in the 1990 census. However, because many Latinos were foreign-born non-citizens or below the age of 18, they only made up 5% of the California electorate at this time, effectively reducing their influence in electing Latinos to political offices in the State Legislature. The Latino share of the California electorate, however, would increase dramatically to 14% by 1998.\n\nNew Jersey  Hispanic Representation in the 1980s\n\nThe first Hispanic to serve in the New Jersey Legislature was the Republican Jorge Rod, who was elected to serve the 9th District (Ocean County) in the New Jersey Assembly in 1981. Assemblyman Rod was followed in 1985 by another Latino Republican, Jose Arango, a native of Cuba who was elected to serve Hudson County in the Assembly.\n\nAssemblymen Rod and Arango were followed in 1987 by the first Hispanic Democrat, Robert Menendez, who would serve in the General Assembly from 1987 to 1991 and in the New Jersey Senate from 1991 to 1993, before moving on to the U.S. Congress.\n\nAssemblyman Jorge Rod, a lifelong Republican, lost his party's nomination for re-election in the June 1985 primary after the GOP withdrew its support, apparently because Rod was not voting along party lines. He subsequently made an unsuccessful bid as a Democratic candidate.\n\nThe 1984 Elections: 120 Hispanic State Legislators\n\nBefore the November 1984 elections, Hispanics held 111 elective legislative offices at the state level nationwide. After the elections, they had increased this to 120 state posts spread across 19 of the 50 states (Santa Fe New Mexican, Nov. 23, 1984, page 6). The New Mexican explained that a 29 percent increase in voter registration had most likely contributed to this significant increase in representation.\n\nIn New Mexico, Hispanics made a net gain of five in the 112-seat state legislature and thus now comprised 35 percent of the body, approaching parity in a state that was already 37 percent Hispanic. They went from 12 to 13 in the Senate and 22 to 26 in the House. At the same time, Floridas Hispanic representatives in the Florida Legislature increased from three to seven in a single election. The states with the largest number of Latino representatives were:\n\nNew Mexico  39 legislators\n\nTexas  24 legislators\n\nArizona  12 legislators\n\nColorado  8 legislators\n\nCalifornia  7 legislators\n\nFlorida  7 legislators\n\nNew York  7 legislators\n\nIn Texas, the number of Hispanics remained at four in the Senate, but dropped from 22 to 20 in the House. During this election, Minnesota lost its lone Hispanic House member (Rodriguez)  who was beaten in the primary  but kept its Hispanic Senator (Vega). Kansas now had three Hispanic representatives and Montana had two. With the election of Jose Lugo as Representative to the 130th District (Bridgeport), Connecticut was now able to boast of one Latino delegate to its state house.\n\nIllinois\n\nIn January 1982, a three-judge federal panel in Chicago had ordered revisions in a redistricting plan to rearrange two Senate and three House districts to bring about an increase in Hispanic representation in Illinois (Chicago Daily Herald, January 13, 1982, page 74). As a result, Joseph Berrios was elected as state representative to Chicagos 9th District in 1982 and was re-elected in 1984.\n\nHispanic Representation in Indiana (1984)\n\nWhen 24-year-old Jesse Villalpando took office as the Indiana Legislatures first Hispanic and youngest member, he was a third-year law student at Indiana University. Serving as a Democrat for District 12 (Griffith), Villalpando replaced Representative Peter Katie who resigned to become a city judge in January 1984(Logansport Pharos-Tribune, January 05, 1984).\n\n1985: 114 Hispanic State Legislators\n\nAccording to the NALEO Education Fund, in 1985 there were 114 Hispanic state representatives in the United States (81 representatives and 33 senators). The 114 legislators were spread across 14 states, including Connecticut (1), Hawaii (1), Illinois (2), Indiana (1), Kansas (3), Minnesota (1), Montana (2), Pennsylvania (1) and Rhode Island (1). The states with the largest number of Latino legislators were:\n\nNew Mexico  34 legislators\n\nTexas  23 legislators\n\nArizona  12 legislators\n\nFlorida  7 legislators\n\nCalifornia  7 legislators\n\nNew York  7 legislators\n\nMassachusetts - 1988\n\nThe 1980 United States census tallied 76,450 Puerto Ricans living in Massachusetts, with 18,899 of this group residing in the City of Boston. With the increasing leverage provided by their growing numbers, Puerto Ricans were fast becoming a respected cultural group within Bostons diverse ethnic mix. This new status provided Nelson Merced, a Puerto Rican, with the incentive to run for elected office. In 1988, Mr. Merced became the first Puerto Rican and Latino elected to statewide office in Massachusetts, when he became the state representative for the 5th Suffolk District (Dudley Square and North Dorchester). Representative Merced served for two terms until 1992.\n\n1990: 128 Hispanic State Legislators\n\nAccording to the NALEO Education Fund, in 1990 there were 128 Hispanic state legislators in the United States (90 representatives and 38 senators). The 128 legislators were spread across 17 states. The states with the largest number of Latino delegates were:\n\nNew Mexico  38 legislators\n\nTexas  27 legislators\n\nArizona  12 legislators\n\nColorado  11 legislators\n\nFlorida  11 legislators\n\nNew York  7 legislators\n\nCalifornia  6 legislators\n\nAt this time, approximately four-out-of-ten Hispanics were not U.S. citizens, with 5 million Hispanics ineligible to vote due to non-citizenship. This factor was crucial in explaining why representation parity had not been achieved in most states despite the obvious progress made in the previous few years.\n\n1995: 163 Hispanic State Legislators\n\nAccording to the NALEO Education Fund, there was a dramatic increase in the number of Hispanic State Legislators from 128 in 1990 to 163 in 1995 (115 representatives and 48 senators). The 163 legislators were spread across 21 states. The states with the largest number of Latino delegates were:\n\nNew Mexico  43 legislators\n\nTexas  33 legislators\n\nFlorida  14 legislators\n\nCalifornia  14 legislators\n\nNew York  10 legislators\n\nArizona  9 legislators\n\nIllinois  7 legislators\n\nConnecticut  7 legislators\n\nColorado  6 legislators\n\nHispanic Representation in Nevada\n\nBrian Edward Sandoval, a native of California, ran for office in Nevadas Assembly in 1994. He was elected as the Representative of the 25th Legislative District and served from 1994 to 1998 as the second Hispanic member of the Assembly (after Paul Leveaga who served in 1874-1876). Sandoval would also serve as the Nevada Attorney General from 2003 and 2009 and was elected the first Hispanic Governor of Nevada in November 2010.\n\nNovember 1998 Election\n\nBy 1998, the 28 million Latinos in the United States represented 11 percent of the population. However, fewer than half of these Latinos were eligible to vote. After the November 1998 elections, Latinos held seats in 15 state senates and 25 state houses or assemblies, according to the NALEO. In Massachusetts, where there had been no Latinos serving in the State House of Representatives since Nelson Merced in the 1980s, three Latinos were elected to the State Legislature.\n\nMichigan and Wisconsin\n\nIn November 1998, Latinos broke new ground in several states that did not have large Latino populations, including Michigan and Wisconsin. A native of Ponce, Puerto Rico, Pedro A. Colón was elected to the Wisconsin State Assembly to serve the 8th Assembly District. Taking office in 1999, the Milwaukee-educated lawyer became the first Latino elected to the Wisconsin legislature and was re-elected in the next five elections.\n\nIn Michigans 8th District (Wayne), Belda Garza was elected as the first Hispanic Democratic State Representative to the Michigan Legislature after winning an impressive 85.13% of the vote. A native of Mexico City, Mexico, State Representative Garza had come to the U.S. at the age of 8 and grew up in Southwest Detroit. During the same election, Michigan native Valdemar Valde Garcia won a seat as a Republican representing central Michigan. In 2001, he moved to the Michigan State Senate, where he still serves.\n\nNovember 2000 Election: 198 Hispanic State Legislators\n\nAccording to the NALEO Education Fund, there was a dramatic increase in the number of Hispanic State Legislators to 198 after the 2000 election. The 198 legislators were spread across 27 states and consisted of 51 State Senators and 147 representatives in the lower houses. The states with the largest number of Latino delegates immediately after the election took place were:\n\nNew Mexico  44 legislators (15 senators and 29 representatives)\n\nTexas  35 legislators (7 senators and 28 representatives)\n\nCalifornia  27 legislators (7 senators and 20 representatives)\n\nFlorida  15 legislators (3 senators and 12 representatives)\n\nNew York  12 legislators (4 senators and 8 representatives)\n\nArizona  13 legislators (4 senators and 9 representatives)\n\nColorado  10 legislators (1 senator and 9 representatives)\n\nIllinois  6 legislators (2 senators and 4 representatives)\n\nConnecticut  5 legislators\n\nNew Jersey  5 legislators\n\nWashington  3 legislators\n\nMassachusetts  3 legislators\n\nGeorgia\n\nDuring the early part of the new millennium, Latino representation made progress in several southern states. In Georgia Sam Zamarripa became the first Latino to serve in the Georgia State Senate, representing the 36th District (Eastern Fulton County). In 2002, Pedro Marin  a native of San Juan, Puerto Rico  became the first Latino ever elected to the Georgia General Assembly, representing District 96 (Gwinnett County). He continues to serve in that capacity.\n\nNovember 2002\n\nWhile the general trend of the 2002 elections favored the Republicans, Latino Democrats made a number of gains in several states. For example, José Peralta  a first-generation Dominican American, won election to the New York State Assembly with 74 percent of the vote. Other breakthroughs occurred in Massachusetts where, for the first time, four Latinos were elected to serve in the legislature.\n\nCalifornia Representation  2004\n\nIn the 2000 census, the number of Latinos in California reached 10,966,556, representing 32% of the states total population. Furthermore, the number of total Latino adults was 6,915,731, or 28%. However, the number of Latino registered voters in the State was considerably smaller: 2,471,811 people, or 16.5% of all registered voters. Although voter registration remained a stumbling block to representation in the California legislature, the total number of Latino state legislators had increased from 14 in 1996 to 27 in 2003 (NALEO, 2004 Primary Election Profile, California).\n\nTexas Representation  2004\n\nThe Latino representation in the State of Texas in 2003 was similar to that of California in some ways. The 6,669,666 Latinos living in Texas, representing 32% of the total state population (as with California). Like California, the number of qualified registered Latino voters in Texas was considerably smaller: 2,164,346 Latino registered voters in January 2004 represented only 17.8% of the all registered voters. In spite of this, between 1996 and 2003, the number of Latino state legislators had increased from 33 to 37 (NALEO, 2004 Primary Election Profile, Texas).\n\nArizona Representation  2004\n\nIn the State of Arizona, the total Latino population in 2000 was 1,295,617, representing 25% of the total state population. There were 304,000 registered voters, or 16% of all registered voters. This population was successful in sending more representatives to the State Legislature, as the number of Arizona state legislators increased from 8 in 1996 to 15 in 2003 (NALEO, 2004 Primary Election Profile, Arizona).\n\nIllinois Representation  2004\n\nBetween 1990 and 2000, the number of Latinos in Illinois grew from 904,446 to 1,530,262, while their share of the population increased from 8% to 12.3% during the same period. However, in 2000, Latino voters accounted for only 4.3% of the states voters. From 1996 to 2002, there were six Latino state legislators, but in 2003, their numbers increased dramatically to 11.\n\nNovember 2004 Elections: 231 Hispanic State Legislators\n\nAnalysis of Election 2004 conducted by NALEO Educational Fund indicated that the number of Latinos serving in lower state houses grew from 161 to 171 representatives, an increase of 6%. Latino gains were particularly noticeable in states that were not the traditional centers of Latino population. In Kansas, the number of Latinos in the state House of Representatives doubled from two to four. Latinos also won additional seats in Michigan (1), New Hampshire (1), Rhode Island (1), and Utah (2).\n\nIn Utah, Mark Wheatley  a Democrat  won election to the Utah House of Representatives in District 35, which was 15.4% Latino at the time. Another Democrat, Ross Romero won 65% of the vote in District 25. Although District 25 included parts of Salt Lake and Summit counties, both of which had significant Latino populations, Hispanics only made up 5.2% of the district population at that time.\n\nIn 2004, the total number of Latino state senators declined from 61 to 60, but the NALEO Educational Fund attributed this to some unique political developments in this election cycle rather than a long-term erosion of Latino political progress. For example, two Latino State Senators did not run for re-election, and no Latinos ran to replace them. In Oregon, State Senator Sal Esquivel (R) decided to run for the Oregon State House of Representatives instead of the State Senate, and emerged victorious in his race.\n\nIn state senate races, California Assemblymember Abel Maldonado made history by becoming the first Latino Republican to be elected to the California State Senate. According to Arturo Vargas, Executive Director of the NALEO Educational Fund, Latino state house victories demonstrated that Latinos are making political progress throughout the nation, particularly in regions with emerging Latino populations. They are not only representing diverse constituents in all corners of the nation, but state legislators also have the power to address the most important issues affecting Latinos, including education, good jobs, and health care.\n\nNovember 2006 Election: 238 Hispanic State Legislators\n\nBetween the 2004 and 2006 elections, the overall representation of Latinos in state legislatures in creased from 231 to 238 (58 state senators and 180 delegates to lower state houses).\n\nIn state lower houses, Latinos saw a very modest overall net gain of two seats, bringing the total number of Latinos in lower state chambers to 180. The Latino Democratic delegations in seven states each gained one additional member: Illinois, Maryland, Minnesota, New Hampshire, Nevada, Texas, and Wyoming. Latino Republican delegations in Idaho, New Mexico and New York also each gained one additional member, including Schoharie County Clerk and former state legislative staff member Peter D. Lopez, who became the first Latino to be elected to the State Assembly from upstate New York (District 127).\n\nThe total number of Latino state senators declined from 60 to 58. This decline was due to the fact that three Latino state senators did not run for re-election and no Latinos ran to replace them. The most notable victory was Patricia Torres Rays election to become the first Latina elected to the Minnesota State Senate.\n\nThe November 2008 Election: 242 Hispanic State Legislators\n\nIn the November 2008 elections, the number of Hispanic state legislators increased from 238 (in 2006) to 242 (65 state senators and 177 representatives in lower state houses). Overall, Latinos saw a modest net gain of four State Senate seats, bringing the total number of Latinos to 65. In one of these races, Wyoming gained its first Latino State Senator, with the victory of State Representative Floyd Esquibel in District 8 (Laramie County). Previously, Esquibel  a native of New Mexico  had served as a representative in the Wyoming House of Representatives from 1997 to 2008.\n\nIn Tennessee, State Representative Dolores Noguera Gresham  a Lieutenant Colonel in the U.S. Marines and the granddaughter of Mexican immigrants  moved from her seat in the Tennessee House of Representatives to become the first Latina in the Tennessee State Senate, representing District 26. The native of San Antonio, Texas was first elected as the representative of Tennessees 9th District in 2002.\n\nIn state lower houses, Latino representation decreased from 190 to 177, in part because of the departure of five Latino state representatives who were unsuccessful in their bids for higher office. However, new milestones were also achieved. For example, Oklahoma's House of Representatives gained its first Latino member, with the victory of Republican Charles Ortega, a third generation resident of southwest Oklahoma, who became the representative of the 52nd District. In addition, the number of Latinos in the Connecticut House of Representatives increased from six to eight.\n\nNovember 2010 Election: 246 Hispanic State Legislators\n\nIn its analysis of the most recent election results, NALEO noted a small increase in the number of Latino State Legislators from 242 to 246 (66 state senators and 180 delegates in lower state houses). In the November 2010 election, the number of Latino State Senators increased from 64 to 66  consisting of 60 Democrats and six Republicans.\n\nWhile the number of Hispanics in lower chambers nationwide - 180 - remained unchanged, the net losses of Latino Democrats and one Independent were offset by net gains made by Latino Republicans. Texas experienced the largest gain (five). Of the 180 Latino State Representatives, 147 will now be Democrats, while 33 will be Republicans.\n\nNew milestones were reached in this election, including the election of State Assemblyman Adriano Espaillat who became the first Dominican-American elected to the New York State Senate (and the first nationwide). In Maryland, State Delegate Victor Ramirez became the first Salvadoran-American to win a State Senate seat.\n\nIn its final analysis of the election, NALEOs press release observed that several of the Latino candidates successfully ran in districts which do not have Latino majorities, demonstrating that Latinos are able to run in non-Latino districts and can have broad appeal across all ethnicities and communities.\n\n© 2011, John P.

In the Coachella Valley, though, Pierce Street is a narrow blacktop running through sagebrush and desiccated palms, across alkali-crusted sand.\n\nHeading toward the Salton Sea a dozen miles south of Coachella, the nearest incorporated town, Pierce Street passes the Duros trailer camp. The desert here belongs to the Torres Martinez Desert Cahuilla Indians, a Native American tribe whose name for themselves is Mau-Wal-Mah Su-Kutt Menyil, or Deer Moon Among the Palms. In 1876, when the U.S. government recognized the tribe, Toro was the name of the local town here, and the Martinez Indian Agency administered the reservation. Hence the combined name of Torres Martinez.\n\nThe Duros trailer camp sits on reservation land, along with a sister trailer park, Chicanitas, on nearby Avenue Seventy.\n\nTogether they create a unique situation. This small reservation is home to a few hundred Native Americans, that is, indigenous people whose land lies within the present borders of the United States. The reservation is now home also to a far larger number of indigenous Mexican migrants, P'urhépecha people from the Mexican state of Michoacan. Over 2000 P'urhépechas live in the\n\ntwo camps, and the number of migrants here rises to over 5000 during peak harvest in the surrounding fields.\n\nP'urhépechas now make up a significant part of the workforce in the Coachella Valley, one of the oldest agricultural areas in\n\nCalifornia. It was in the valley's grape fields in 1965 that Filipino farm workers walked out on strike, leading eventually to the formation of the United Farm Workers. Today hardly any Filipinos are left in Coachella fields. The work they did half a century ago - picking grapes and lemons, and cutting lettuce - today is performed by indigenous Mexican migrants.\n\nThe trailers at Duros aren't in great shape. People came here looking for living space after Riverside County began requiring the demolition of tumbledown trailers in other, smaller settlements outside the reservation. Harvey Duro, for whom Duros is named, had a lease for land from the tribe, and the camp quickly grew as people were forced out elsewhere. Chicanitas expanded for the same reason.\n\nEventually Duros too was threatened with demolition, since its trailers were often in worse condition than those the County had\n\ncondemned. In 2008 U.S. District Judge Stephen G. Larson ordered improvements to the trailers and the camp's infrastructure. California Rural Legal Assistance went to bat for the residents, advocating better conditions, but also opposing any demolition. In April 2009, Judge Larson agreed with them. Tearing down the trailers and relocating residents yet again \"would create one of the largest forced migrations in the history of this state,\" he said, comparable in size to the internment of Japanese-Americans at Manzanar. A caretaker was appointed for the Duros camp, and today conditions are much better, according to\n\nMeregildo Ortiz, president of the P'urhépecha community of Coachella Valley.\n\nIn Duros and Chicanitas most residents don't speak English or Spanish, but a language that was centuries old when Columbus arrived in the Americas. Every December, P'urhépechas begin practicing the Danza de los Ancianos, the Dance of the Old People. It too is a central part of their cultural identity. Late at night at Chicanitas, long lines of young people shuffle around the trailers to the music of guitars and horns, in a stylized imitation of the halting gait of the very old. They're getting ready for the procession they'll eventually make to the church in Mecca, a few miles away. But the practice also introduces children to the culture in which they've been born. And as the lines snake and shuffle, wood smoke rises into the dark sky from a fire warming a galvanized tub of cinnamon-flavored coffee, which everyone shares when the practice ends.\n\nPeople don't make much money picking lemons or grapes. Jobs only last a harvesting season, and many have to leave the valley for at least part of the year as they follow the crops elsewhere. But dancing together in the desert is part of the glue that holds the P'urhépecha community together in these two trailer camps -- something to come back for.\n\nPedro Gonzalez was one of the first P'urhépechas to leave his home state to travel to the U.S., looking for work. Over the three\n\ndecades that followed, he was joined by thousands of others. He was the community's first president, before Ortiz. Today he's 60 years old, and lives in a trailer at Duros with his wife Dorotea Gonzalez Fosar. In an interview with David Bacon, he recounted the history of the P'urhépecha migration that created the Duros and Chicanitas camps.\n\nI grew up in Ocomichu, Michoacán, which is a P'urhépecha town. When I was growing up, nobody knew how to speak Spanish. When you asked them something in Spanish while they were working in the fields they would run, because they didn't\n\nunderstand what you were saying. You suffer when you don't know the language. My father wasn't P'urhépecha, though, just my mother, so he taught us Spanish when we were young.\n\nI first came to the U.S. in 1979. When I first arrived in Riverside I didn't get a paycheck for two weeks. We survived off\n\ntortillas and oranges. We were working in the orange fields, and ate them for every meal. Someone lent us a couple of dollars and we would buy a package of tortillas. We need to help each other, even when someone just needs a dollar. I just felt like crying back then, not knowing what to do.\n\nToday in Duros or Mecca you can practically go anywhere and speak P'urhépecha with anyone. It wasn't like that when I got\n\nhere. I didn't have anyone to talk to. I lived with an African American man in Palm Springs for two months, and felt very lonely. Nowadays the younger generation says our memories of what we suffered are not real and exaggerated. That makes me feel bad.\n\nWe walked two nights and two days crossing the border back then. Now it costs about $1,500, even as much as $3,000 to cross the line. You have to work for more than two or three months to earn that much. It used to be that you didn't have to pay another person to help you cross. Now it's much harder, though, and the coyotes charge so much. I used to help people cross for $300, and it was no big deal. I've helped others cross and they've never paid me. They forget.\n\nI would say we have about 3,000 P'urhépecha people in this area now. There are a lot of us. In Riverside alone I think there\n\nmust be 1,500 people. Our hometown in Michoacan has also grown a lot. It used to be a small town, but it's now a lot bigger. A few years back they conducted a census in Mexico and determined there were about 8,000 indigenous people living in the hills of that area of Michoacán. I would say most are still there, but there are many of us now all over the U.S. We're spread out in Palm Springs, Coachella, Indio, and Riverside.\n\nHere in the Duros trailer park there were only four trailers when I came in 1999. Slowly people started arriving and everything started growing. Now I think there must be hundreds of people in these two parks, Duros and Chicanitas.\n\nMost of us here work picking lemons and grapes, depending on the time of year. I like working the lemon harvest the most, because it pays piece rate and not by the hour . If you work by the hour, it's just over $7. On piece rate you can make about $1,550 every two weeks. If you do odd jobs here and there it's enough for us to live on. But piece rate makes you work fast, and some people don't like it because they don't like to work hard. For example today I finished nine rows while some others only did\n\nfive.\n\nThe owner of the park here is a good man, a Native American. He even helped me fill out the immigration paperwork for my family, and only charged $500 when others would have charged me $2,000.\n\nBut we used to have a lot of problems [before the state took control of the park]. A big one was the lack of security. Once my wife heard a knocking right after we'd left for work. She thought we'd come back, so she opened the door. It was an intruder. She yelled and he ran off, but the security guards wouldn't do anything to protect us.\n\nRent on the trailer here costs us about $250, and with garbage, water and security it goes up to $300 a month. If you're getting paid $7 or $8 an hour, that's hard. Gas prices keep going up and our wages don't. Food prices are high. I spend more than $300 every time I go buy food. If people got together and decided not to work for one day it would have a tremendous impact on the economy, but people don't do that because they are in need of money. We participated in a strike once. But there were\n\nother people who really needed work. They went into the fields to work even though we told them not to.\n\nMy kids are here legally now and I'm in the process of obtaining legal residency for my last child. They all speak P'urhépecha, which is what we speak in the house. My wife doesn't speak Spanish too well. She refused to learn it in the beginning because she said she wouldn't need it. But now look at how necessary it is to speak English in this country.\n\nWhen my kids were young we had such a humble life in Mexico. They used to run around with holes all over their clothes. But our life has changed. Now if they have a little tear they want to throw the clothes away. They even waste a lot of food. They don't know how to value things.\n\nMy family still has land in the ejido. My brother sold his plot when the land reform law changed, but I still have mine. My father died but my mother is still alive, and my wife's mother as well. We never forget about them and send them money continuously. I don't think my kids will return to Michoacán to live, though. Even though some were born over there, when we go to visit they always want to come back.\n\nBut I don't think they will lose their language and culture living here. We hold onto the P'urhépecha traditions, with dances,\n\nweddings, baptisms, and quinceañeras. We all help each other out. There are many P'urhépechas here so everyone feels at home.\n\nI might go back to Mexico to live someday, but I don't know when. I haven't been over there in years. I don't even have my voter card. I've never voted in my life.\n\nAt age 17, Sergio Marquez left his hometown in the Mexican state of Michoacán and traveled to the small U.S. town of Wapato, located amid the fertile farmlands of Washington's Yakima Valley. Even in Mexico, he had heard about the valley's famed apple treesand the work that could be found picking, pruning, and thinning them.\n\nIt took him a week, several bus rides, and one coyote-led walk across the border to reach Wapato. Just two months later, he was deported, after a traffic stop brought his illegal status to light.\n\nSo he made the illicit journey again. Soon enough, he found himself living in a trailer with 19 other guys from Michoacán and taking up the farm-working life common to so many of his compatriots. His first paycheck, for three days of pruning in the hot sun, came to $80. It wasn't quite the easy life he expected in America.\n\nBut 33 years later, his life looks very different. He still puts in long hours on the farmbut it's a farm he owns, all 106 acres of it, neatly planted with rows of Fujis, Cameos, Honeycrisps, Galas, and other varieties. Last year, he says, he made about $100,000 in profit. This year he's leased another 85 acres, and expects to nearly double his apple harvest to more than six million pounds. During his busy seasons, he employs about 50 workers, nearly all Mexican immigrants like him. Marquez himself became a citizen, thanks to his marriage to a native-born American in 1981. (She later left him, he says).\n\nGregarious and mustachioed, Marquez (pronounced mar-KEZ) surveyed his orchard on a recent day and reminisced about the path that led him to become his own boss. When he first arrived at this farm as a laborer some 15 years ago, \"trees were dying and there were a lot of empty spots,\" he says. The owner, John Hunter, had other businesses in town, and, as Marquez tells it, the foreman at the time had neglected the land. Marquez essentially took over, planting many more trees per row to increase the harvest. Impressed, Hunter made Marquez foreman.\n\nLater, when the aging farm owner decided he was too occupied with other affairs to keep up the placeand his children were disinclined, or unprepared, to take it overhe turned to the one man he knew he could rely on: Marquez.\n\nIn 2004, Hunter sold his foreman the farm (including all equipment and a modest ranch house on the property) for $400,000, a bargain price. It was still a considerable sum for Marquez, which he raised with help from a low-interest loan program run by the federal Farm Service Agency. When Hunter died a few years later, Marquez, his second wife Lilia (also from Michoacán), and their four children started spending even more time at the Hunter homestead, located a quarter-mile down the road and occupied by 66-year-old widow Judy, a grown daughter, and a 10-year-old granddaughter.\n\nTo this day, Marquez cleans the Hunters' pool, sends his workers over to mow the lawn, and has his daughter babysit Judy's granddaughter. \"He's family,\" Judy says of the man she calls \"Sarge\" and whom she describes as a \"real, honest Christian.\" Indeed, Marquez attends Catholic services two nights a week, plus Sundays, in Wapato. On a breezy June evening, he traded his chinos and blue button-down for a black dress shirt and pants, and sat in the parish's second-from-the-front pew with his wife. They have two sons in college, and their 17-year-old daughter was recently crowned beauty queen in the neighboring town of Harrah.\n\nIn other words, you could hardly find someone who better embodies the small-town values of farm, family, and faith than Sergio Marquez. And he's far from alone. These days, in the Yakima Valleyacclaimed not only for its apples but its cherries, peaches, asparagus, and hopsnearly 20 percent of farmers are Hispanic.\n\nLatino immigrants, of course, have long supplied the grueling, low-paying work that a lot of agriculture requires, and that native-born Americans seemingly find beneath them. Now these immigrants are managing to buy farms and put down roots, just as the American ethos says they should be able to do.\n\n\"Latino farmers are taking over agriculture in the state of Washington,\" says Malaquías Flores, who runs a program at Washington State University that helps Latinos access farm loans and manage their businesses.\n\nHe says WSU started the program nine years ago because it was looking to foster growth in small-scale farming, and found that Latinos were mostly the ones wanting to get into the business. (The program only assists immigrants who are here legally.)\n\nNationwide, according to the latest figures, the number of Hispanic farmers increased 14 percent between 2002 and 2007twice the rate of growth among farmers overall, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture. The West Coast, New Mexico, and Texas saw the biggest increases in Latino farmers, who also have become a presence in Arizona, Florida, Texas, and Hawaii.\n\n\"It's well-recognized by many of us that the future of the industry is with Hispanicmostly Mexicanimmigrants,\" says Mike Gempler, executive director of the Washington Growers League, a Yakima-based organization representing farmers around the state. \"They know the business. They love it. And that's who it's being passed on to in many respects.\"\n\nHispanic immigrants are propping up small-town real-estate markets too, even if they have to dig into what Nestor Hernandez, a realtor and president of Yakima County's Hispanic Chamber of Commerce, calls their \"mattress money.\" Indeed, Hispanics are virtually the only people buying property in a whole series of farming towns east of the Cascade mountains.\n\nMeanwhile, many of the politicians who like to celebrate small towns and family farms in their political rhetoric are also the ones calling for a crackdown on illegals. Speaking at the GOP convention in 2008, for instance, Sarah Palin famously declared: \"We grow good people in our small towns...They're the ones who do some of the hardest work in America, who grow our food and run our factories and fight our wars.\" (She was, in part, quoting the journalist Westbrook Pegler.) But this May, she stood with Arizona Governor Jan Brewer at a press conference and declared her support for the new state law requiring local law enforcement to question suspected illegal immigrants.\n\nMissouri Congressman Sam Graves, who's running for re-election this year and whose bios highlight his status as a \"sixth-generation, full-time family farmer\" from the tiny town of Tarkio, has proposed shutting down even legal immigration until the borders are secure, according to The Washington Post Company website Who Runs Gov.\n\nHere in Washington state, U.S. Senate candidate and Tea Party favorite Clint Didier is playing up his roots as a \"Home Town Farm Boy\"indeed, those are the first words to load on his home page. His posted bio lauds him for returning with his family, after a professional football career, to the farming life in eastern Washington that he knew as a child. Yet he suggested last month at the Republican state convention in Vancouver that the U.S. stop granting citizenship to the children of illegalsa position arguably more radical than Arizona's governor's. Didier, whose Pasco farm is located roughly 75 miles from Marquez's orchard, grows grains such as wheat and barleycrops whose harvest is heavily mechanized, with considerably less need for cheap labor.\n\nWhen the Washington Farm Bureau's political action committee met last week, neither Didier nor presumed GOP front-runner Dino Rossi managed to get the two-thirds majority vote necessary for a primary endorsement. And Didier's immigration views might well have worked against him. Steve Appel, a Palouse farmer who heads the Bureau, tells Seattle Weekly that Latino immigrants \"are vital to the economies of entire communities\" in eastern Washington. \"If agriculture dries up and goes away,\" he says, \"those communities go away. It's just that simple.\"\n\nBordering the Yakama Indian Reservation, Wapato has for decades drawn Native Americans, as well as Filipinos, Japanese, and Hispanics, many of whom went to work on the surrounding farms. Whites once made up roughly half Wapato's population, says Mike Gilmore, 59, who grew up in the town and now is the head of the Yakima Valley Savings & Loan.\n\nThe demographics of Wapato have changed gradually, Gilmore says, as older whites passed away or moved to nursing homes in bigger cities, while younger ones left for school and never came back.\n\nBut the promise of farm work and small-town life never got old for Hispanic immigrants, who kept arriving. WSU's Flores explains that most of the newcomers hail from rural towns in Mexico. He says everyone there had a plot of land to produce food for the family\"corn, beans, tomatoes, jalapeños, squash\"and make a little money if they had produce left over. So it's only natural that they should turn to farming here.\n\nIn fact, you only have to cross the road from Sergio Marquez's orchard to find another Mexican-born farmerand another example of a formerly illegal immigrant turned small-businessman: Manuel Herrera. Speaking through a translator, Herrera says he always wanted to work in the fieldsthat's how he grew up, on farms owned by both his parents and his grandparents. The 46-year-old father of seven says he crossed into the U.S. illegally in 1980, but later became a permanent resident through a federal amnesty bill signed into law by Ronald Reagan in 1986. He recently bought a 15-acre plot and leases another 47. [This story has been corrected since it was first posted. It originally gave a wrong year for when the amnesty bill was signed.]\n\nBut it's not just agriculturethe whole town's economy is built on Hispanic commerce. The signs on the establishments lining Wapato's handful of commercial blocks tell the story: Jose Hardware, Alfonso's Sports Bar, Martinez Body Shop & Auto Sales. The town also boasts Mexican-owned bakeries, laundromats, a butcher shop, and a construction company.\n\nThe local Catholic churchofficially called St. Peter Claver Parish, but known as \"San Pedro\" to much of the congregationis also presided over by a Mexican immigrant, who delivers services in both Spanish and English. One Wednesday evening, a Spanish-language mass draws some 50 people, many of whom rise to the pulpit to deliver impromptu words of praise for the Lordlike the woman who repeats \"Gracias, Señor\" over and over again until her emotion reaches a fever pitch.\n\nHispanic immigrants do not exactly run the townbut the children and grandchildren of immigrants do. Wapato currently has its first Latino mayor, police chief, and fire chief.\n\nAntonio Delgado Sr. is typical of the town's small-business owners. Speaking one evening in his grown daughter's houselocated in the nearby town of Moxee and painted in electric shades of red and green seldom seen in the muted Northwestthe 53-year-old Delgado says he too was once illegal and received amnesty in the '80s. For eight years, he worked as a farm worker, and he put in another 10 years at an apple-packing company. Then a friend and fellow Mexican who owned two laundromats in Wapato offered to sell him one.\n\nTo buy it, Delgado got a loan from a Yakima nonprofit called Rural Community Development Resources. Founded in 1991, the organization uses federal grants to help an array of budding Latino entrepreneursbut only ones who provide identification indicating they are legal residents or citizens, according to RCDR founder Luz Gutierrez.\n\nIn time, Gutierrez's organization dispensed a second loan to Delgado to start a bakery next door to the laundromat, which led him to start two more bakeries in Harrah (not so profitable and eventually closed) and Moxee.\n\nDelgado's bakeries offer the oversized pastries favored by Mexicans: fruitcakes, cream-filled \"tacos\" (resembling rolled crepes), fruit turnovers that in Mexico would never hold apples but which in Washington make use of the local bounty.\n\nDelgado's 20-year-old son, also named Antonio, works full time at the laundromat in Wapato. And though he plans to re-enter school soon, he declareseven out of earshot of his parentshis intention to come right back to Wapato when he's done. \"Everyone's family,\" he says of the town.\n\nAnd often that's just about literally true. Mayor Jesse Farias, 65, is surrounded in Wapato by nine of his 11 siblings. The grandchild of Mexican immigrants who grew up in a section of town then called \"Tortilla Flats,\" he signed up for the military during the Vietnam War. \"I thought there had to be a better life,\" he explains in Wapato's one-story, brick city hall.\n\nThere wasat least for a while, he says, but he eventually lost both legs in the war. Out of the military and consigned to a wheelchair, he moved to Olympia. He worked for many years at the state's Employment Security department, then received two gubernatorial appointments, one of which made him the state director of the Department of Veteran Affairs.\n\nIn 1999 he returned to Wapato, where he became mayor in 2004.\n\nWhy did he trade the state capital for a town one-tenth its size? \"This is my home,\" he says. \"I'll always come back.\"\n\nSimilarly, Lorenzo Alvarado, son of a Mexican farm worker and a school principal in nearby Yakima, counts five of his seven siblings as neighbors in Wapato. His wife, a Mexican native, has family in town too.\n\nEvery weekend, Alvarado says, there's some kind of family event: \"a barbecue, a birthday party, a quinceañera.\"\n\n\"All the culture I need is here,\" he says.\n\nFlores, of WSU, says he believes immigrants' ongoing love affair with the valley has kept its housing market afloat. As real-estate values in the rest of the country tanked, the valley's stayed relatively stable. Local home prices even rose during one of the worst points of the recession last summer. At the time, ABC's Good Morning America (citing figures from Seattle's Zillow.com) referred to Yakima County as one of the best places in the nation to sell a home.\n\nAnd to buy one, too. The median price for houses (excluding new construction) is $147,000, according to WSU's Washington Center for Real Estate Research. Those prices have been accessible to many of the region's immigrants, says realtor Hernandez, who estimates that his clientele is 90 percent Hispanic.\n\nPaul Regimbal, president of the Catholic Credit Union in Yakima, says that his business is targeting Latino customers as part of its strategic plan for growth. He notes that many Catholic Hispanics naturally gravitate toward his company, which was originally set up as a cooperative for Catholics in the valley but now serves all faiths. The credit union builds on that affinity by advertising in Spanish-language newspapers and TV and radio stations.\n\n\"Any business that is not wrapping their arms around the facts in this valley is missing the boat,\" Regimbal says. By \"facts,\" he means Hispanic immigrants. \"These folks are here. They pay their bills. They're not going away.\"\n\nIn the years since 9/11, and even more so following the mortgage crash, many financial institutions have effectively made it harder for illegal immigrants to get loans and accounts by requiring a valid Social Security number. The USA Patriot Act required banks to more stringently verify a customer's identity in order to prevent money-laundering by potential terrorists.\n\nThe Patriot Act, though, doesn't specifically require customers to prove their legal status, allowing them to authenticate their identity with what the Internal Revenue Service calls an \"individual taxpayer identification number,\" which one can obtain without a Social Security number. That suffices for the Catholic Credit Union. Regimbal says it's simply not his company's job to delve into immigration matters.\n\nHernandez says that's another reason the credit union is popular among the Hispanic community. Even so, he says, the rule-tightening in the industry overall is partly to blame for the significant drop-off in business he has seen over the past couple of years. Whereas he once handled approximately 10 transactions a month, he now does about half that.\n\nOne of his clients, Jesse Anguiano, just bought a $275,000, 3,500-square-foot house on a 1.7-acre plot on the outskirts of Wapato. Anguiano's father was a Mexican farm worker who brought him here illegally as a child. Later, Anguiano says, the family received amnesty. Now a citizen, he works as the operations manager of a logging company on the Yakama Reservation.\n\nHe bought his first house in the city of Yakima nine years ago, but longed for the country. Gesturing on a recent day to the orchards and open fields that surround his new house, he says he loves the place for \"the view and the space,\" and the chance to get his kids (three of them, with one more on the way) away from the TV. He's built a chicken coop behind the house, is thinking about buying horses, and is scoping out the best place to build a fire pit for making s'mores.\n\nOnly a few miles away from this bucolic scene, in Anguiano's former home of Yakima, the debate over illegal immigration is still roiling the citizenry. With a population of 84,00067 percent white, 37 percent Latino, according to the latest census estimateYakima is the region's major metropolis, and there's widespread resentment between the two communities. Just as in Arizona, whites blame Hispanics for a crime problem: Gang violence claimed 25 lives in the valley during just the first half of this year. And Hispanics accuse whites of bigotry.\n\nGutierrez, of Rural Community Development Resources, says she originally called her Yakima-based organization the Washington Association of Minority Entrepreneurs, but changed that about five years later to the more innocuous name.\n\nOn May 1, a day when pro-immigrant marches took place across the country, 3,000 people gathered in Yakima, galvanized by anger over Arizona's new immigration law. Gempler of the Growers League marched with them. Like many in the farm lobby nationally, he has long supported so-called \"comprehensive\" immigration reform, including the \"path to citizenship\" proposed by Obama.\n\nYakima police chief Samuel Granato, the grandchild of Mexican immigrants, spoke to the crowdin Spanish. The chief, who described himself to Seattle Weekly as \"just to the left of Attila the Hun\" on most issues, announced to those assembled that he didn't support the Arizona law, in part because he needs the help of all immigrants, legal or illegal, to fight crime. \"I don't need you to be afraid that local police are going to arrest you,\" is how he put it.\n\nGranato's remarks weren't well received by some in town. The Yakima Herald-Republic editorialized that they were inappropriate for a city official, and Granato came to a Yakima City Council meeting to defend them and assure critics he was speaking only for himself, not describing an official department position.\n\nThe council, meanwhile, has been busy recently debating a proposal to require the city and its contractors to vet new hires through the government-run E-Verify system. Designed to ensure that potential employees are legal residents or citizens, it uses federal databases to check Social Security numbers. A growing number of statesincluding Arizona, California, and Georgiarequire contractors, or in some cases all private employers, to use the system.\n\nIn Washington state, Lewis, Clark, Pierce, and Whatcom counties have adopted E-Verify, and an all-volunteer group called Respect Washington! tried to get an initiative on the ballot this year that would have required statewide use of the system. (The measure, which also called for local law enforcement to enforce immigration laws, as in Arizona, failed to get enough signatures.) With Yakima's council scheduled to vote on the issue on May 25, Respect Washington! took out a full-page newspaper ad enc"
