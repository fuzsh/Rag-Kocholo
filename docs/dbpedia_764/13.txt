The ordinances of June 9, 1728, marked a significant shift in the silver coinage model adopted in the Spanish Indies. Henceforth, the coinage would feature the renowned plata gruesa (national) of Mundo y Mares, commonly known as Columnarias, bearing the inscription Vtraque Vnum ‘both are one’ a reference to the Letter of St. Paul to the Ephesians (2:14), across all denominations. Production of these coins commenced in Mexico from 1732 and in Guatemala from 1733, with no other Indian mints minting during Philip V's reign. These reforms were implemented towards the end of the term of a Creole viceroy, Don Juan de Acuña y Bejarano, Marquis of Casa Fuerte, known for his enlightened policies during his twelve-year rule. However, in 1731, he faced an uprising from miners protesting against the Crown’s proposal to levy an additional real for each mark of silver coined. Ultimately, the tribute was rescinded.

During the period of the monetary change, we find pieces marked by assayer Felipe Rivas Angulo (F), both in the new Mundo and Mares pieces and in the old types, specifically in redondos or galanos. This is the case of this extraordinary piece, crafted using the traditional hammering technique, previously unknown and marking the end of an era at this mint.
