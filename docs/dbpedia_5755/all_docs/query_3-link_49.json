        "text": "Who Am I?\n\nAs a young boy, Lionel Messi tagged along when his two older brothers played football with their friends. Although he was small, the bigger boys never intimidated Leo, as he was known. His size meant that he could move fast. By the age of four, Leo was playing football for his local club and at six, he moved to Newell’s Old Boys. They only lost one match in the next four years, and Messi scored over 500 goals!\n\nWhen he was ten, he was diagnosed with a hormone deficiency which restricted his growth. The medical treatment was expensive, but Barcelona Football Club offered to pay if he went and played in their youth academy. So, Leo and his dad left Argentina and went to live in Spain. Leo was determined that nothing would stop him from training hard and working towards his goal of being the best footballer he could be. Although he became a Spanish citizen, he always intended to play for the Argentina team.\n\nWhat Am I Known For?\n\nToday, many people consider Lionel Messi the best football player of all time. He became so successful that Barcelona paid for him to have his own physiotherapist, who would travel with him and help him stay injury-free. In 2012, he won the record for the most goals ever scored. For many years, the World Cup was the only tournament he hadn’t won, but in 2022, he achieved that in Qatar.\n\nHe is grateful for the opportunities he has had in life. He established the Leo Messi Foundation, which helps poor children with their education and medical care and also provides them with the opportunity to participate in sports. He works to help children realise their dreams, saying, “You have to fight to reach your dreams. You have to sacrifice and work hard for it.”\n\nHow About You?\n\nTake a moment to reflect on which elements of self-control are most difficult for you to manage. Your emotions, your behaviour or your actions?\n\nHow do you tap into your self-control to get you through when you encounter obstacles?\n\nOther Amazing People (you can find them on the website)\n\nLily Parr’s story is quite inspirational and recounts how she overcame many obstacles to become an amazing footballer. Her story is available on our website.\n\nThinking about the role of self-control in the life of someone amazing is one way to reflect on this important strength. Ada Lovelace’s story is one of self-control. Her mother believed that her father, Lord Byron, was lacking in this area, and she strongly encouraged Ada to develop this strength. Explore her story on our website and see what can be learned from her.\n\nOther Useful Resources (available on the website)\n\nAya Miyama is featured in our Amazing Women Footballers resource. Like Messi, she was told her short stature would hold her back, but the opposite was true. Subscribers can find this helpful resource by logging in and going to the Search page.
