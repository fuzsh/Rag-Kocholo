Born in Argentina in 1987, Messi began playing football at a young age and quickly developed a reputation as a prodigious talent.\n\nHe joined FC Barcelona's youth academy in 2000 at 13, and just three years later, he made his debut for the first team. In the years that followed, Messi quickly established himself as one of the greatest players of his generation.\n\nHe has won numerous individual awards, including a record seven Ballon d'Or trophies, and helped Barcelona win multiple titles, including four Champions League titles and 10 La Liga titles.\n\nDespite his success on the pitch, Messi has faced numerous challenges throughout his career. He was diagnosed with a growth hormone deficiency as a child, which required expensive treatment and put a strain on his family's finances.\n\nIn 2021, he won his first major international trophy, guiding Argentina to a Copa America triumph. He helped his country lift their third World Cup title in Qatar a year later.\n\nOff the pitch, Messi is known for his philanthropic work. He has established the Leo Messi Foundation, which aims to improve the lives of children in need worldwide. He has also been involved in numerous charitable initiatives, including a project to build a children's hospital in his hometown of Rosario, Argentina.\n\nBut what are the 13 things you need to know about the attacker?"
