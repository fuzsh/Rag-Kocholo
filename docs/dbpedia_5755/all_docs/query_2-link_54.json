        "text": "Canada made Argentina work\n\nFor long stretches of its 2024 Copa Am√©rica opener, Argentina looked shaky. The defending champions ‚Äî of South America, and of the world ‚Äî labored at times during a battle with Canada. They played some fluid, dynamic f√∫tbol, but also some very lax soccer. At halftime, they very easily could have been behind.\n\nBut four minutes into an action-packed second half, Lionel Messi unlocked Canada ‚Äî with a pass that was either ingenious or inadvertent.\n\nDid he see Alexis Mac Allister, and feed the midfielder's run? Or was he looking for Juli√°n √Ålvarez's feet, before √Ålvarez ran elsewhere? The answer hardly matters. Only the conclusion does. Canadian goalkeeper Maxime Cr√©peau clattered into Mac Allister, who'd latched onto Messi's pass. Cr√©peau's foul would have yielded a penalty, but √Ålvarez rendered that unnecessary.\n\nIn the waning minutes, Messi undressed Canada again. Lautaro Martinez finished. And Argentina exhaled.\n\nMartinez's 88th-minute goal sealed a 2-0 Argentina victory in Thursday's opener. But it ‚Äî and the flurry of chances that Argentina created and missed in the second half ‚Äî also masked an imperfect performance.\n\nIn the end, Argentina deserved its victory. Messi and Co. are well on their way to the tournament's knockout rounds after just one night. But they benefitted from Canadian misses and good fortune. They are, on Matchday 1, not yet in top gear.\n\nSo they will surely have to improve to defend their title captured three years ago in Brazil. They will need to prove that their core has not aged to the dark side of its peak.\n\nYou can relive Thursday's game as it happened below.\n\nLIVE COVERAGE IS OVER47 updates\n\nFINAL: Argentina 2-0 Canada\n\nThe reigning champs sit atop Group A with 3 points!\n\nMartinez puts Argentina up 2-0 after another crisp assist from Messi!\n\nCanada's substitutions for the final 10 minutes or so of the match: Richie Laryea on for Cyle Larin, Jacen Russell-Rowe for Liam Millar and Jonathan Osorio for Ismael Kone.\n\nBombito's slide tackle had Messi writhing in pain on the field, but he's back up and back in action after a brief pause in action.\n\nTons of chances, still 1-0 ‚Äî somehow\n\nAfter the latest missed chance, Lionel Messi went down.\n\nCanadian center back Mo√Øse Bombito flew into a tackle, and caught Messi flush in the ankle.\n\nMessi is up now, but limping. He'll likely stay in, but that'll hurt. And it was scary.\n\nMessi gets another 1-on-1 but once again misses the target\n\nSubstitutions Nos. 2 & 3 for Argentina with Nicolas Otamendi replacing Leandro Paredes and Lautaro Martinez coming in for Julian Alvarez. Earlier, Canada's Jacob Shaffelburg replaced Tajon Buchanan.\n\nCanada howls for a penalty...\n\nJacob Shaffelburg dipped past an Argentine defender into the big, and got taken down.\n\nThe referee seemed to bring his whistle halfway to his mouth ... then didn't bring it all the way.\n\nOn replay: It was absolutely a foul, but probably just outside the box, so there's nothing the VAR could do.\n\nScaloni makes the first substitution for Argentina as Giovani Lo Celso replaces Angel Di Maria.\n\nChances at both ends!\n\nRemember when Pel√© wowed at the World Cup even when he sent shots wide? Messi just did something similar. He sat two Canadian players down with one feint on a break, and nearly scooped the ball into a gaping net, but his clever shot was blocked.\n\nAt the other end, Jonathan David just flashed a header a few yards high and wide.\n\nStill 1-0 to Argentina.\n\nMessi magic still loading ...\n\nDi Maria a tad bit late here:\n\nOn Argentina's goal: Messi magic? Or a bit of good fortune?\n\nTo the untrained eye, Argentina's goal was the umpteenth example of Lionel Messi's greatness. His through-ball to Alexis Mac Allister was one that nobody else on the field could see.\n\nBut I'm not sure Messi saw it either.\n\nHe seemed to be looking for Julian √Ålvarez's feet. Alvarez, though, made a diagonal run, so Messi's pass went into no-man's land ... which Mac Allister happened to be running into.\n\nThe 24-year-old √Ålvarez continues to do his part for the Albiceleste\n\nArgentina breakthrough!\n\nMessi to Mac Allister, who gets cleaned out by Canadian keeper Maxime Cr√©peau.\n\nIt would've been a penalty, but Mac Allister's touch fell right to Julian √Ålvarez, who finished well.\n\n1-0 to Argentina.\n\nSecond half starts now after a longer-than-usual halftime (20+ minutes).\n\nCan Canada hold on?\n\nIn Canada's two pre-tournament friendlies, they also held elite opponent scoreless for 45 minutes.\n\nIn the first, they got blown out by the Netherlands after halftime and lost, 4-0.\n\nIn the second, they held on for a 0-0 draw with France.\n\nThis third such game could really go either way. (Or, it could very easily go to Canada.)"
