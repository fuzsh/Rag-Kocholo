        "text": "Lionel Messi conquered his final frontier after lifting the World Cup in Qatar in 2022. Hence, there was renewed optimism that the soccer icon would return to the next edition in 2026. But, La Pulga sent shockwaves last year as he rated his chances of participating as ‘difficult.‘ Meanwhile, Messi’s acquaintance Angel Di Maria has announced his retirement after Copa America. What could then be the Inter Miami star’s plan for the future? Well, coach Lionel Scaloni’s tactics might reveal the picture.\n\nAccording to a report from Bola Vip, the Argentine National Team is optimistic that Lionel Messi will feature in the World Cup 2026. A major reason for the optimism is the current squad depth. Boasting players like Enzo Fernandes, Julian Alvarez, and more, there is a belief that this team is one of the best from La Albiceleste. Moreover, there have been no comments from the AFA regarding Messi exiting national team duties after the Copa America.\n\nThe biggest challenge for Messi to be at the next World Cup revolves around his age. By the time the tournament commences, the playmaker would have been 38. Age is catching up with the Argentine maestro as seen by his repeated injuries for Inter Miami. Fortunately for Messi, Lionel Scaloni will be managing the group in 2026.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nArticle continues below this ad\n\nTo accommodate an aging Lionel Messi, Scaloni and his team look for the ideal players to complement the soccer icon. As such, youngsters like Carboni, Medina, Ezequiel Fernández, Claudio Echeverri, and Alan Varela are touted to play significant roles moving ahead. However, it’s not just Scaloni who has an important part to play in Messi’s continuity, but his current club, Inter Miami as well.\n\nHere’s how Inter Miami can ensure Lionel Messi’s participation at the next World Cup\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nArticle continues below this ad\n\nLa Pulga’s current contract with Inter Miami runs till December 2025. Based on his current form, Lionel Messi is surely in line for a contract extension. If Messi agrees to a contract, it pretty much confirms his presence in the coveted tournament. Playing for the Herons would allow the 8-time Ballon d’Or winner to keep in rhythm and stay match-fit.\n\nAlso, the setting for the next World Cup is the US, which could also influence La Pulga’s process. As such, Inter Miami can generate significant hype for the tournament by promoting their talisman. Additionally, Lionel Messi and his family have taken well to life in the country. Hence, an opportunity to dazzle at the highest level in front of his friends and family for one last time might be too hard to turn down.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nArticle continues below this ad\n\nWill Lionel Messi play in the upcoming World Cup? Rate his chances below in the comments."
