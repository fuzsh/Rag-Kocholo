        "text": "Lionel Messi, the usually reserved football icon, has always been passionate about his homeland Argentina.\n\nIn 2022, Messi finally clinched the elusive World Cup trophy for Argentina in Qatar, a crowning achievement in his illustrious career. But it was during the intense World Cup quarter-finals that year when Messi's emotions spilled over while defending his nation.\n\nThe match against the Netherlands was fraught with tension, culminating in several confrontations between the Argentine and Dutch players. Notably, Virgil van Dijk pushed Leandro Paredes after the latter kicked the ball towards the Dutch bench in the 88th minute.\n\nREAD MORE: Who is Endrick?

After a nail-biting penalty shootout, Argentina secured their win in a game marked by an extraordinary 15 yellow cards.\n\nPost-match, however, the drama continued as Messi interrupted his interview to confront Weghorst, exclaiming in Spanish: \"What are you looking at fool? Get back there.\"\n\nThough Messi is known for his calm demeanor, his passionate reaction after a match highlighted his deep connection to Argentina and his willingness to stand up for his country. Two years on from lifting the World Cup, Messi is back in action with Argentina at the Copa America, cherishing every opportunity as his illustrious career enters its final chapter.\n\nClick here to follow the Mirror US on Google News to stay up to date with all the latest news, sport and entertainment stories.\n\n“I’ve done this all of my life,” he told ESPN Argentina earlier this month. “I love playing ball. I enjoy the practices and the day-to-day, the games. Yeah, there’s a bit of fear that it’s all ending. It’s always there. It was a difficult step leaving Europe to come here [Miami].”\n\n\"The fact we won the World Cup helped, it helped a lot, to see things in another way,” Messi continued. “But I try not to think about it. I try to enjoy it. I do that more now because I'm aware that there's not a lot of time left. So I have a good time with the club, being lucky having good teammates and friends at my side.\n\n“I enjoy my time with the national team, where I also have good friends, too, and a lot. I enjoy those small details that I know I'll miss when I stop playing.”\n\nMessi's fellow Argentinians know that his time donning the blue and white is winding down, yet they're savouring potentially his last big international event."
