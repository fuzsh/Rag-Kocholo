        "text": "Lionel Messi is set to be the headline attraction as he prepares to feature for the MLS All-Stars, with an ensemble cast of stars from rival teams upon his return to club action from Copa America.\n\nCurrently the legendary winger's focus is on defending his country's title in the continental tournament as he looks to lead Argentina to another international triumph. The 37-year-old has failed to find the net for his nation in the competition so far, starring in the La Albiceleste's first two group games as he led the team to back-to-back wins.\n\nHe was rested for their final match in Group A, as his teammates defeated Peru - with Ecuador now set to come in the quarter-finals. It is almost certain that Argentina's talisman will be restored to the starting XI for the knockout rounds, with the team now three games from retaining the trophy they won back in 2021.\n\nREAD MORE: Cristiano Ronaldo, Lionel Messi and the 20 highest international goalscorers of all-time\n\nREAD MORE: Lionel Messi responds to stunning five-goal haul with Argentina warning\n\nWith the Copa America final set to take place on July 15, Messi could have nine days between his next game if he is to take his team all the way to the showpiece in Miami. Assuming he does not feature for Inter Miami on July 18 and 21, his next outing could come in the MLS All-Star Game on July 24.\n\nThe star is among four players from Vice City who have been selected for the game, with Luis Suarez, Jordi Alba and Sergio Busquets also having been called up. The match will see leading stars from MLS pitted against their equivalents from Mexico's Liga MX, at Lower.com Field in Columbus, Ohio.\n\nThe roster for the All-Star Game consists of 30 players and has been put together as a result of voting via fan, players and the media. Meanwhile, the Columbus Crew head coach Wilfried Nancy also has had a hand in the final selection, along with MLS commissioner Don Garber.\n\nFollow us on Xfor the best and latest in sports news\n\nCamilo Durana, MLS Executive Vice President of Properties and Events spoke with excitement ahead of the spectacle, saying: \"Weâ€™re excited to host Liga MX at the 2024 MLS All-Star Game presented by Target, showcasing the global and rising stars of our leagues, and the strength of our sport in North America.\"\n\nMeanwhile, LIGA MX President Mikel Arriola said: \"It is a privilege to participate in the 2024 MLS All-Star Game for the third time. LIGA MX will bring together its best players to form a competitive team. This will be another chapter of this sporting rivalry, which allows us to continue building a great partnership with MLS.\n\n\"We are very excited about the opportunity to reconnect and be close to the Mexican fanbase in the United States. I'm sure we'll have a great experience in Columbus.\""
