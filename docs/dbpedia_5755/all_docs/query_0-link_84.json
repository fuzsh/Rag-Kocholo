        "text": "Lionel Messi is in the news because of his retirement from international football. The 5 time Ballon D’or winner decided to end his international career after the loss against Chile in the Copa America Centenario 2016. Taking a break from the gloom of his retirement, here are some interesting facts about Lionel Messi!\n\nMessi’s first contract with Barcelona was detailed out on a paper napkin! FC Barcelona sporting director Carles Rexach was so impressed with Messi’s skills that he wanted to make a contract immediately and there was no paper available at that time.\n\nALSO READ:\n\nMessi was not very healthy and nutritious in his childhood days like the other boys around. He was diagnosed with a growth hormone deficiency which was stopping his normal growth rate at a tender age of 11. His parents could not afford his treatment, which was $900 a month, which Barcelona paid for after signing him.\n\nMessi holds passports for both Spain and his native Argentina, and turned down an opportunity to play with the Spanish national team because he sees himself as Argentinian, despite spending many of his formative years in Spain.\n\nIn 2012, Messi became the all-time leading scorer for Barcelona in all club competitions, at the age of 24!\n\nIn 2012, Messi broke the record of the most number goals scored in a calendar year, which was previously held by Gerd Muller with 85 in 1972.\n\nLionel Messi became his country’s all-time top scorer when he scored in the Copa America 2016 semi-final against the United States to take his international tally to 55 goals."
