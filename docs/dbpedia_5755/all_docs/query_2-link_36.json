        "text": "Lionel Messi admits his retirement from international football is edging over closer after leading Argentina to World Cup glory last year.\n\nMessi achieved the crowning moment of his career in Qatar, as one of the sport’s all-time greats finally won football’s greatest prize.\n\nThe Inter Miami star admits that his days wearing those famous blue-and-white stripes are numbered.\n\nPremier League\n\nMan City hearing set to start in September, outcome likely early 2025 – Paper Round\n\n12/08/2024 at 21:32\n\n“Honestly, I don’t know until when. I think it will happen when it has to happen,\" said Messi in an interview with TV Publica.\n\n“After having achieved everything recently, the only thing left to do is to enjoy. God will say when that moment will come.\n\n“Logically, because of my age, I’m sure it will be soon. But I don’t know exactly when will be the right time. I think about the day-to-day, enjoying everything beautiful.\n\n“We had to go through very hard times in the national team. We were fortunate enough to be World Cup and Copa America champions. It’s time to enjoy.\"\n\nThe 36-year-old was being quizzed by his Argentina team-mates, with Roma’s Paulo Dybala asking if Messi had ever considered the magnitude of his achievements.\n\n\"When you are always competing, when you always have goals ahead of you, you don’t value much what you really deserve, what you are achieving,\" he added.\n\n\"I am at a moment in my career where I enjoy everything that happens to me and I value everything much more because I know that these are the last years. But I think that when I retire and I’m not playing anymore, I will value all of this much more.\n\n“And even more so the fact of being a World champion, which will last a lifetime, especially in a country like ours, that is so fond of football, so grateful for it.”\n\nLionel Messi to mistrz świata z reprezentacją Argentyny\n\nImage credit: Getty Images\n\nAttention turned to Messi’s club career after rejecting Saudi advances to seal a move to Inter Miami in the MLS.\n\nHe insists that this transfer does not signal an intention to slow down his career, and is relishing the prospect of playing across the Atlantic.\n\n\"My mentality and my head will not change and I will try, wherever I am, to give the maximum for me and for the club, in order to continue to perform at the highest level,” he explained."
