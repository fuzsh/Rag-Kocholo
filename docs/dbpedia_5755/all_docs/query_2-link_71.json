        "text": "International soccer star Lionel Messi and the Argentinian national team took the pitch at George Mason University last week.\n\nThe team practiced at George Mason in preparation for their friendly against Guatemala on June 14.\n\nThe two teams squared off at FedEx Field, where Argentina won 4-1. Messi scored twice in the victory.\n\nDistrict residents welcomed Argentina to the city with immense fanfare, as they arrived at their hotel in downtown D.C. before the highly anticipated matchup.\n\nDMV soccer fans missed their opportunity to see the eight-time Ballon D’or winner play in March, as Messi sat out Inter Miami’s game against DC United due to injury.\n\nRoughly 65,000 fans attended last week’s game, according to ESPN.\n\nReigning World Cup champion Argentina is gearing up for the Copa América tournament.\n\nThe team will look to defend its 2021 Copa América title against international powerhouses like Brazil and Uruguay.\n\nFanduel has Argentina favored to win the tournament at +175 odds.\n\nThey begin group play tonight at 8 p.m. against Canada."
