        "text": "As Inter Miami gears up for their next match, football fans are already wondering where is Messi and if they can expect to seem him out on the field.\n\nMessi, widely regarded as one of the greatest footballers of all time, has enjoyed a remarkable career spanning over two decades. His latest stints on the field have seen him playing for Major League Soccer club Inter Miami along with the Argentina national team, but many years ago, he made his first-team debut for Barcelona in 2004. Messi went on to achieve unparalleled success with the club, winning numerous La Liga titles, UEFA Champions League trophies, and individual awards, including multiple Ballon d’Or titles.\n\nIn August 2021, Messi transferred to Paris Saint-Germain (PSG) after spending his entire professional career with Barcelona due to financial constraints. Two years later, news broke that the legendary footballer rejected an offer from Saudi Arabia to sign with Inter Miami. “I made the decision that I am going to go to Miami,” he told the Spanish publication Sport in July 2023.\n\nRegardless of the club, Messi’s talent in the world of football remains indelible—and fans are eager to see him play. For everything we know about where is Messi and if he’s playing for Inter Miami tonight, keep on reading below.\n\nIs Messi playing tonight?\n\nSo, is Messi playing tonight? According to ESPN, Lionel Messi will miss Inter Miami’s match against Sporting Kansas City on September 9, 2023.\n\nCoach Gerardo Martino told reporters back in August 2023 that the footballer would miss at least three games this season due to his existing commitments with the Argentina national team. The footballer is expected to be in Latin America for World Cup qualifiers during Inter Miami’s game as Argentina is set to face Ecuador and Bolivia on September 7, 2023, and September 12, 2023, respectively.\n\nWhen asked if he expected Messi to return to Miami instead of joining Argentina’s match against Bolivia, Martino suggested that it was unlikely. “I wouldn’t venture to say as of now,” Martino told reporters on September 8, 2023, per ESPN. “It is early. Today could be an important day [regarding that decision], but I don’t imagine so if he has a chance to play against Bolivia,” he added at the time.\n\nMessi has always been expected to miss some games with Inter Miami. Back in August 2023, Martino confirmed that the footballer would miss “at least three games” with the Miami team this season. “The importance is that we value winning and winning this way because it’s something we have to get accustomed to,” Martino told reporters at the time. “He’s gonna get called up by his national team and others too. We know that the team has to continue to win without them at times.”\n\nSince his debut with the club in July 2023, Messi has contributed 11 goals and six assists over the course of the team’s 11-game unbeaten streak. When asked who might step in to replace Messi during his absence, Martino remained coy on the specifics: “Well, that’s difficult to answer when it’s asked like that, but we have an idea of who will play,” the manager told reporters, per the Miami Herald. “We will adapt our system to the players we have available and the way Kansas plays.”\n\nMessi’s teammate, forward Leo Campana, told the Herald that he would be missed until his eventual return. “We will miss Leo, of course, but we have high quality players and Leo has raised the level of everyone on the team, lifted our confidence, we are a totally different team than we were before,” he shared.\n\nWhat is Messi’s Inter Miami schedule?\n\nWhile Martino didn’t specify which games Messi would miss with Inter Miami this season, it’s possible that the footballer will skip any upcoming MLS matchups while he’s with the Argentina national team for World Cup qualifiers on September 7, 2023 and September 12, 2023.\n\nThe next time Inter Miami takes the field will be Saturday, September 9, 2023 at 7:30 PM ET when the team hosts Kansas City. After that, Inter Miami’s schedule includes:\n\nSeptember 16, 2023: Inter Miami at Atlanta United\n\nSeptember 20, 2023: Home vs. Toronto FC\n\nSeptember 24, 2023: Orlando City vs. Inter Miami\n\nSeptember 27, 2023: Home vs. Houston Dynamo FC\n\nLionel Messi and The Art of Living By Andy West\n\nAlthough the details of Messi’s story are already well known, The Art of Living examines afresh and anew his highs and lows, his successes and failures, his ongoing evolution and his endless struggle to succeed. It encourages us to consider, to analyze, and—above all—to think about Messi’s career from a different viewpoint, understanding how his journey can be related to our own lives on a meaningful and impactful level.\n\nOur mission at STYLECASTER is to bring style to the people, and we only feature products we think you’ll love as much as we do.
