        "text": "It took Lionel Messi 17 years and 5 editions to win a FIFA World Cup with Argentina. During those years that he didn’t win the World Cup, soccer circles had it that he could have won if he played for Spain. Though the talk has subsided, ex-Atletico Madrid star Mariano Pernia has now reignited this discourse, laying bare how Messi could have chased two consecutive world cups with Spain had he chosen a different path in his ‘early days‘.\n\nThough Messi was born in Argentina, he spent much of his years in Spain, since enrolling in Barcelona’s academy before teenage. In addition to that, he also qualified for Spanish citizenship due to his great-grandfather, who was born in Spain’s Catalan region. Therefore, La Pulga could indeed have played for Spain.\n\nMariano Pernia claims Messi would have been better off in Spain\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nArticle continues below this ad\n\nIn a recent interview with Flashscore, Pernia spoke about his La Liga stint and experiences as a racecar driver. Pernia himself is an Argentine born, who chose to play for Spain because he had Spanish citizenship. Soon, Pernia stated he fancied Lionel Messi also followed his suit. ” I told everyone here, ‘if Messi had chosen to play for Spain, he would already have two World Cups’. Undoubtedly, the one Spain won (2010), Messi would have won it too, and the next one, he would have won it too, because Messi was at his best. That was my reading: if Messi had chosen to play with Spain, he would have won two World Cups in his early days,” said Pernia.\n\nAfter Lionel Messi moved to Barcelona, the then club director Carles Rexach had urged the Royal Spanish Football Federation to secure him. Messi, too, was informally asked if he wanted to represent Spain. However, La Pulga was then hellbent on serving Argentina, which to this day he is. But people like Pernia still think both Messi and Spain fell short because of the former’s decision. Anyhow, Pernia is not the only one with the same feeling.\n\nCesc Fabregas’ take on Lionel Messi’s Spanish prospects\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nArticle continues below this ad\n\nLionel Messi’s former Barcelona teammate, Cesc Fabregas, totally backed his decision to play for Argentina. However, that does not mean he did not fancy Messi’s Spanish prospects at all. Fabregas had once not-so-subtly told that Spain had fallen short at times due to the lack of a player like the Argentine veteran. He told the team would have won more titles if La Pulga graced the side.\n\nREAD MORE: Here’s How Diego Maradona’s 1986 WC Win Overshadowed Lionel Messi’s 20-Year-Long Career Heroics\n\nIn fact, Lionel Messi would have given the Spanish team a better result, especially in the 2014 World Cup if he played for them. The then defending champions, Spain, had faced an embarrassing group stage exit in 2014. Meanwhile, he was at his best and that was evident when he took Argentina to the final in 2014. But then a numb Messi left the stadium with his head hanging low. It would have perhaps been a different picture if he followed Pernia’s train of thought. However, good things took time, and Leo completed soccer last year by finally winning the last piece.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nArticle continues below this ad"
