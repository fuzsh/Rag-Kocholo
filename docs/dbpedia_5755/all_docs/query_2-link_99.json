        "text": "Argentina are going for glory at the Copa America 2024 in the USA.\n\nThe world champions headed to the U.S. as the current holders of the trophy, which was followed up by their FIFA World Cup triumph in Qatar at the end of 2022.\n\nA double title win for Lionel Messi ended years of frustration for both him and the long-suffering Argentina fans, as they won a first Copa America title since 1993, and a first World Cup since 1986.\n\nBoth trophies secured a milestone for Messi, as he finally matched Diego Maradona's world title from 1986, with the former Barcelona star producing a sensational showing en route to glory in Qatar.\n\nDespite moving to Inter Miami in July 2023, Messi has remained committed to his role as Argentina captain, as he turned 37 during the tournament.\n\nFOLLOW LIVE: Copa America final score updates as Argentina battle Colombia\n\nIs Lionel Messi playing at Copa America 2024?\n\nMessi has remained a firm part of Lionel Scaloni's plans and was named on the Argentina roster for the tournament when it was announced in early June.\n\nAlthough he missed a group-stage match against Peru with a muscle injury, Messi has still led Argentina throughout the tournament, with Inter Miami showing flexibility and allowing him to continue his national team career while at the club.\n\nMessi has featured in four of five matches at Copa America 2024 and has been named in the starting lineup for the final against Colombia on July 14.\n\nLionel Messi schedule at Copa America 2024\n\nMessi and Argentina were drawn in Group A of the tournament in the USA, alongside Peru, Chile and playoff winners Canada.\n\nThey kicked off the tournament against the Canadians on June 20 in the opening match, winning 2-0 before becoming the first team to book a place in the quarterfinals with a 1-0 win over Chile.\n\nVictory over Peru on the final matchday meant they went into their quarterfinal against Ecuador unbeaten.\n\nThe last-eight clash was nervy, and after Lisandro Martinez's first-ever goal for his country gave them a lead, Kevin Rodriguez equalised for Ecuador in injury time. That sent the game to penalty kicks, and although Messi missed in the shootout — trying an audacious \"Panenka\" chip that hit the crossbar — goalkeeper Emi Martinez saved twice to send them through.\n\nIn the semifinal against Canada, Messi finally got on the scoresheet, scoring his first of the tournament as La Albiceleste won 2-0 to book a spot in the decider.\n\nYou can check out Messi's full schedule at the Copa America here.\n\nHas Lionel Messi won the Copa America?\n\nThe 2021 Copa America final was a battle between the two superpowers of CONMEBOL football in Rio de Janeiro,\n\nMessi and Argentina reached the knockout stages after progressing unbeaten through their group and beating Ecuador and Colombia in the next phase.\n\nDespite Angel Di Maria netting the winner in the 1-0 final victory over Brazil, the Argentina players surrounded Messi at the full time whistle, as he sealed a first-ever Copa America title in his sixth attempt.\n\nLionel Messi's Copa America record\n\nCopa America 2024 is Messi's seventh Copa, and Messi has racked up a record 38 appearances and 14 goals, including the Golden Boot award in 2021.\n\nHe went past Chile's Sergio Livingstone as the player the most appearances (34) in the competition against Canada in the group stage, and is three behind Norberto Mendez and Zizinho (17) as the tournament's highest-ever goalscorer."
