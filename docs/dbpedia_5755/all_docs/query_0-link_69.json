        "text": "FC Barcelona icon Lionel Messi's son Thiago Messi said that he would like to play with Lamine Yamal, and also for the Argentina national team one day despite being born in Spain.\n\nThiago Messi currently plays for the U12s of the club his father joined last summer, Inter Miami, which has recently contested the La Liga FC Futures tournament.\n\nInter Miami drew 0-0 against Real Sociedad in its first group game but was then beaten 5-0 by La Masia - which famously reared Thiago Messi's father - and therefore failed to advance to the quarterfinals where Barca was knocked out by Real Madrid 3-1 on penalties.\n\nIf the Messi family returns to Barcelona where Thiago was born when the eight-time Ballon d'Or winner retires as he often said, there is a good chance his sons will also be picked up by the Blaugrana academy.\n\nThis might one day see Thiago fulfil a dream explained in a short interview uploaded to social media by Mundo Deportivo, where he said \"I would like to play with Lamine\", alongside his Inter Miami teammate in Luis Suarez's son Benjamin Suarez.\n\n\"Playing makes me more nervous than watching my father play. I'm not good with my left foot,\" he also confessed, which is a marked difference to Messi Senior and Lamine.\n\nFurthermore, Thiago revealed that \"I want to play with the Argentine national team and I don't think there's any way the Spanish national team can convince me.\"\n\nAs for his father's \"most beautiful goal\", Thiago Messi went for the header scored against Manchester United in the 2009 Champions League final, netted at a time when the English press wrote the number 10 off as lacking an aerial threat.\n\nElsewhere, Benjamin Suarez didn't show his own father's killer instinct by saying he doesn't \"dream of goals\". Though his collective attitude can't be knocked as he added that he dreams \"of the team winning\" instead.\n\nSimilar to Thiago, Benjamin said \"I'm going to play with Uruguay\" and not England, where he was born, or Spain where he lived for a good eight years or so in Barcelona then Madrid."
