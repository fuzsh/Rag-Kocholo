        "text": "Updated Jun. 9, 2023 3:07 p.m. ET\n\nItâ€™s official: Lionel Messi will join MLS side Inter Miami CF on a free transfer in July.\n\nDespite talks of re-joining FC Barcelona or signing an incredibly lucrative deal with a Saudi Pro League club, the 35-year-old World Cup winner will take his talents to MLS once his contract with Paris Saint-Germain expires on June 30.\n\nWith arguably the biggest superstar in the history of the sport coming to the United States, FOX Sports Research decided to take a look at each chapter of his career, examining his performance as well as his accolades and honors. Since turning pro 19 years ago, there have only been two seasons in which he did not win a trophy (2013-14, 2019-20). Letâ€™s take a look below.\n\nYouth career: Grandoli, Newellâ€™s Old Boys, Barcelona (1992-2003)\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nMessiâ€™s football career actually started at the age of four, when he signed with Grandol, a local club that was coached by his father. Shortly after at the age of six, he joined Newellâ€™s Old Boys, a team he had supported throughout his childhood. There, heâ€™d score an absurd 500 goals over the course of six years before moving to Spain in 2000.\n\nLionel Messi's top 10 goals of all time\n\nFC Barcelona (2004-2021)\n\nThe Argentine phenom spent four years in Barcelonaâ€™s youth academy, with some time on the B and C senior teams. But the legend of Messi truly began once he was called up to the senior squad at Barcelona. At 17 years old, he made his debut with the first team in 2004, which started what would ultimately be the most storied career in the clubâ€™s history.\n\nIn 17 seasons, he won 35 major trophies with Barcelona, more than any player in the club's 123-year history. That Includes 10 La Liga titles, eight Spanish Supercopas, seven Copa del Reys and four Champions Leagues. Below is a breakdown of his dominance in the Spanish league during that time.\n\nBarcelona's all-time goalscorer (672) and appearance-maker (778)\n\nLed Barcelona to two trebles (2008-09 and 2014-15)\n\nWon six of his seven Ballon dâ€™Or trophies with Barcelona\n\nHolds record for most goals in El Clasico with 26 goals in 45 games\n\nHolds La Liga league records for career goals (474), most goals scored in a season (50), career assists (192), most assists in a single season (21), career hat-tricks (36), most hat-tricks in a single season (8- tied with Cristiano Ronaldo)\n\nHolds record for most La Liga appearances by a foreign-born (player (520), as well as record for most top-flight league titles in Spain than any other non-Spanish born player (10)\n\nLed La Liga in scoring in seven different seasons with Barcelona\n\nLed Champions League in scoring in six different seasons with Barcelona\n\nHolds the record for most goals in a single calendar year (men's) with 91 goals in 2012 (79 for Barcelona and 12 for Argentina)\n\nFirst player to score five goals in a Champions League match, doing so with Barcelona in 2012\n\nYoungest South American player ever to score 15 goals in Champions League, doing so at 21 years and 288 days old in 2009\n\nPSG (2021-2023)\n\nThe worldâ€™s greatest player was forced to make a change in 2021 and left the only European club he had played for in order to team up with the likes of Kylian MbappÃ© and Neymar at Paris Saint-Germain. In his short time there, Messi won three trophies, hoisting the Ligue 1 championship twice in addition to the TrophÃ©e des Champions.\n\n32 goals and 35 assists in 75 total appearances for the club\n\n16 goals (10th most) and 16 assists (most) in Ligue 1 play this season\n\n15 assists (second most) in Ligue 1 play last season\n\nScored 6 goals in Ligue 1 play and 5 goals in Champions League play last season\n\nWon his seventh Ballon dâ€™Or in 2021 with PSG\n\nArgentina (2005-present)\n\nOftentimes, superstars in the soccer world are dominant in club play but fail to replicate the same success on the international scene. Many pundits had criticized Messi for failing to claim a World Cup title for Argentina, especially after a 1-0 loss to Germany in the 2014 final. However, Messi layered the icing on the cake of his career with a World Cup trophy in Qatar last year. Below is an overview of his absolute dominance for Argentina since his senior debut at 18 years old in 2005.\n\n2022 FIFA World Cup champion\n\n2022 Finalissima champion (CONMEBOL vs UEFA championship)\n\n2021 Copa Amâ€‹â€‹Ã©rica champion\n\n2008 Olympic Gold medalist\n\n2005 FIFA U-20 World Cup champion\n\n2-time World Cup Golden Ball winner (2022, 2014), only player to have won it twice\n\nArgentinaâ€™s all-time leader in appearances (174) and in goals scored (102)\n\n19 consecutive senior seasons scoring a goal (first goal in 2024 will make it 20 straight), record is currently 22 straight by Cristiano Ronaldo\n\nFirst man to score in the final, semifinals, quarterfinals and round of 16 at a single World Cup\n\nSecond-oldest goalscorer in a World Cup final at 35 years and 177 days old\n\nOldest menâ€™s player to ever score five goals at a single World Cup\n\nMost World Cup appearances by any man, with 26 matches played\n\nOne of five men to score 13 goals in World Cup play, and Argentinaâ€™s all-time leading scorer in the tournament\n\nOnly Argentina player to score in three different knockout stages of the World Cup\n\nOnly man to score in the World Cup in his teens, 20s and 30s\n\nOnly man to register an assist in five different World Cups\n\nOne of five men (and first Argentina player) to score at four World Cups; Cristiano Ronaldo holds the record, having scored in five different World Cups; PelÃ©, Uwe Seeler, Miroslave Klose each scored in four different World Cups\n\nOne of six men to play in five World Cups; Rafa MÃ¡rquez (Mexico), Antonio Carbajal (Mexico), Lothar MatthÃ¤us (Germany), AndrÃ©s Guardado (Mexico), Cristiano Ronaldo (Portugal)\n\nSix assists in knockout stage games, tied with PelÃ© for the most of any menâ€™s player all-time\n\nInter Miami (July, 2023-present)\n\nWhile Messi is the ultimate game-changer, Inter Miami has struggled since its first season in MLS. Below is a quick look on what Messi will be up against when he joins the club.\n\nFired manager Phil Neville on June 1\n\nCurrently in last place in the Eastern Conference at 5-11-0 (W-L-D)\n\nHave never finished above .500 in any of its three seasons, going a combined 33-44-14 (W-L-D) in that span\n\nRecorded a goal differential of -36 in three seasons prior to 2022-23\n\nFOLLOW Follow your favorites to personalize your FOX Sports experience\n\nLionel Messi\n\nInter Miami CF\n\nArgentina\n\nGet more from Lionel Messi Follow your favorites to get information about games, news and more"
