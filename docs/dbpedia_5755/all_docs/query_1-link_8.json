        "text": "Lionel Messi Cuccittini (Spanish pronunciation: [ljoˈnel anˈdɾes ˈmesi] ( ); (born 24 June 1987) [5] is an Argentine footballer.[6] As of summer 2023, he plays for the Argentinian national team and American club Inter Miami.\n\nMessi is widely recognized as one of the best players of all time.[7] His playing style and skills have been compared to the Argentine legend Diego Maradona. There is much competition between him and Portuguese footballer Cristiano Ronaldo. In 2009, Messi was included in the \"World Player of the Decade 2000s\", ranking second behind Ronaldinho but ahead of Cristiano Ronaldo.[8] Messi has played alongside many football greats, such as Ronaldinho, Deco, Samuel Eto'o, Luis Suárez, Xavi, Andrés Iniesta, Sergio Busquets, and Neymar.[9]\n\nMessi played his first professional match at 17 years old on 16 November 2003 against Porto. He played the 2003-04 season with the Barcelona B team. He was promoted to the A team for the 2004-05 season, and made his league debut on 16 October 2004 against Espanyol as a substitute. He made his league debut at age 17, and became the youngest player to play for Barcelona's first team in an official competition. He scored his first professional goal on 1 May 2005 against Albacete Balompie from a sublime assist by Ronaldinho. The goal made him the youngest-ever scorer for the club at that time. Barcelona won the La Liga that season for the first time in 6 years, and won the league for a second time in a row along with the Spanish Super Cup and UEFA Champions League in 2006.\n\nHis first breakthrough season was in the 2006–07 season; he became a first team regular by scoring his first hat-trick of his career in El Clásico. On 18 April 2007, he scored a goal almost exactly identical to Maradona's \"Goal of the Century\" against England in the 1986 World Cup, where Maradona got the ball behind the halfway line on the right side and beat 4 defenders and the goalie to score. Messi's goal was similar to this; he received a pass from Xavi on the right side behind half-field, and then nut-megged an opponent and 4 others including the goalie before finishing off with his right foot inside the penalty box.[10] In 2019, Barcelona fans voted it as the best goal in the club's history, receiving 45% of votes.[11] After Ronaldinho left the club at the end of the 2007-08 season, Messi was handed the number 10 shirt. The 2008-09 season was arguably one of the most successful seasons in his stellar career. In this season, Messi scored 38 goals in all competitions, including one in the Champions League final against Manchester United that Barcelona won 2–0 as part of their treble. In the following 2009–10 season, Messi scored 47 goals in all competitions. That levelled to Ronaldo Nazario's record total for Barcelona. Messi also won his first Ballon d'Or in December 2009, and also won his second a year later. He scored again in the 2011 Champions League final against their same opponent two years earlier, Manchester United. Barcelona won 3-1. Messi won his third Ballon d'Or in a row that year.\n\nParis Saint-Germain\n\n[change | change source]\n\nAfter a situation involving FC Barcelona and their overwhelming wage bill, Messi made the most shocking transfer to the French football club Paris-Saint Germain.\n\nInter Miami\n\n[change | change source]\n\nOn 7 June 2023, Messi confirmed in an interview that he was joining Inter Miami of Major League Soccer (MLS).[12]\n\nInternational career\n\n[change | change source]\n\nMessi was allowed to play for both Spain and Argentina since he had dual-nationality, but he decided to play for his home country, Argentina. He led the team to the final game of the 2005 U-20 World Cup by scoring important goals in the knockout stages. Messi scored two goals in the final against Nigeria, and Argentina won 2–1. In addition to receiving a winner's medal, Messi was also awarded the Golden Shoe for most goals scored (6), and Golden Ball for best player.\n\nMessi played his first game with the senior team on 17 August 2005 against Hungary. He came on as a substitute. However, he was shown a red card 45 seconds into the game for hitting an opponent in the face on accident while Messi was trying to pull the opponent off from his shirt. Messi scored his first goal for Argentina in a friendly match against Croatia on 1 March 2006. Argentina lost the game 3-2.[13] He was selected for the 2006 World Cup by coach José Pekerman. In Argentina's second game against Serbia, he became their youngest player to play at a World Cup. He also assisted a goal scored the last one in the 6–0 victory. That goal made him the youngest goalscorer in the 2006 World Cup.\n\nMessi won the 2008 Olympics with Argentina as well, as he assisted Ángel Di Maria's goal in the final against Nigeria in Beijing. Messi was made captain of the national team in 2011. He scored his first hat-trick with the country in his 68th appearance during a 3-1 victory against Switzerland in February 2012.[14]\n\nOn 21 June 2016, he broke the top scoring record for Argentina by scoring his 55th goal with a gem of a free-kick against the United States in the Copa América Centenario. It was regarded as the best free-kick scored by Messi during his career. The record was previously held by Gabriel Batistuta with 54 goals.[14]\n\nOn 26 June, Argentina once again lost to Chile on penalties 4-2 in the Copa América Centenario final after a 0–0 tie. Messi missed his penalty in the penalty shootout. This was Messi's third consecutive defeat in a major tournament final with Argentina, and his fourth overall. A day after the match, Messi announced his retirement from international football. In an emotional interview after the game, he said he was very sad that he missed the penalty and also sad that he wasn't able to win any trophies in four finals.[15][16][17]\n\nReturn from Retirement\n\n[change | change source]\n\nHe came out of retirement in October 2016 for the 2018 World Cup qualifiers.\n\nAfter a slow start to the 2018 FIFA World Cup, he helped Argentina qualify to the next round of the competition by scoring the first goal in the 2-1 win over Nigeria.\n\nJumping to 2021 with the new coach, Lionel Scaloni, Argentina won the Copa America in June. With Dimaria's goal in the 11th minute, they beat Brazil 1-0 in their home ground. Which was one of the main reasons for Messi winning the Ballon dO'r for the record 7th time and counting.\n\nIn the mid-year of 2022, Messi and the Argentina team along with Lionel Scaloni beat Italy 3-0 and won the Finalissma trophy.\n\nIn the winter of 2022, Messi won the World Cup after scoring 7 goals and providing 3 assists as well as winning the player of the tournament.\n\nPersonal life\n\n[change | change source]\n\nMessi has three children with his wife Antonella Roccuzzo. They are named Thiago Messi, Mateo Messi and Ciro Messi. Thiago was born on 2 November 2012, Mateo was born on 11 September 2015 and Ciro was born on 10 March 2018. On the bottom of Messi's cleats is the name of his first son, Thiago.\n\nMessi and Antonella married in June 2017.[18]\n\nWhen not playing on the field, Messi finds time to do charity work. He started the Leo Messi Foundation in 2007 which helps children in at-risk situations. Messi also opened a kids park for children living in a hospital in Barcelona. He also donated 1 million euros for the Covid-19 virus in Barcelona.\n\nIn July 2016 he was convicted of tax fraud and sentenced to spend 21 months in prison. Messi was also fined two million Euros.[19] Messi never went to prison, and the problem was be solved with probation. He told the court he \"only played football\" and didn't know anything because he left his money problems to be dealt with by his father, Jorge Messi.[20]\n\nGoal Stats\n\n[change | change source]\n\nGame Shoot accuracy Number of shoots for each game Average distance of shoots Assist per game 1 40 5 18 1 2 50 4 20 0 3 30 6 22 1 4 45 5 19 2 5 60 3 17 0 6 55 4 21 1 7 35 6 23 0 8 70 3 16 2 9 65 4 18 1 10 50 5 20 0 11 27 4 19 1 12 24 5 21 2 13 29 3 18 0 14 20 6 22 1 15 33 4 17 2 16 30 3 20 0 17 23 5 19 1 18 26 4 21 1 19 31 3 18 1 20 28 5 20 2\n\nClub career statistics\n\n[change | change source]\n\nAs of 23 June 2020\n\nAppearances and goals by club, season and competition Club Season League Copa del Rey Champions League Other Total Division Apps Goals Apps Goals Apps Goals Apps Goals Apps Goals Barcelona C 2003–04 Tercera División 10 5 — — — 10 5 Barcelona B 2003–04 Segunda División B 5 0 — — — 5 0 2004–05 17 6 — — — 17 6 Total 22 6 — — — 22 6 Barcelona 2004–05 La Liga 7 1 1 0 1 0 — 9 1 2005–06 17 6 2 1 6 1 0 0 25 8 2006–07 26 14 2 2 5 1 3[a] 0 36 17 2007–08 28 10 3 0 9 6 — 40 16 2008–09 31 23 8 6 12 9 — 51 38 2009–10 35 34 3 1 11 8 4[b] 4 53 47 2010–11 33 31 7 7 13 12 2[c] 3 55 53 2011–12 37 50 7 3 11 14 5[d] 6 60 73 2012–13 32 46 5 4 11 8 2 2 50 60 2013–14 31 28 6 5 7 8 2 0 46 41 2014–15 38 43 6 5 13 10 — 57 58 2015–16 33 26 5 5 7 6 4[e] 4 49 41 2016–17 34 37 7 5 9 11 2 1 52 54 2017–18 36 34 6 4 10 6 2 1 54 45 2018–19 34 36 5 3 10 12 1 0 50 51 2019–20 26 21 2 2 6 2 1 1 35 26 Total 478 440 75 53 141 114 28 22 722 629 Career total 510 451 75 53 141 114 28 22 754 640\n\nInternational career statistics\n\n[change | change source]\n\nAs of 17 November 2020\n\nAppearances and goals by national team, year and competition Team Year Competitive Friendly Total Apps Goals Apps Goals Apps Goals Argentina[21][22] 2005 3[f] 0 2 0 5 0 2006 3[g] 1 4 1 7 2 2007 10[h] 4 4 2 14 6 2008 6[f] 1 2 1 8 2 2009 8[f] 1 2 2 10 3 2010 5[g] 0 5 2 10 2 2011 8[i] 2 5 2 13 4 2012 5[f] 5 4 7 9 12 2013 5[f] 3 2 3 7 6 2014 7[g] 4 7 4 14 8 2015 6[j] 1 2 3 8 4 2016 10[k] 8 1 0 11 8 2017 5[f] 4 2 0 7 4 2018 4[g] 1 1 3 5 4 2019 6[j] 1 4 4 10 5 2020 4[f] 1 0 0 4 1 Total 95 37 47 34 180 106\n\nBarcelona[23]\n\nLa Liga: 2004–05, 2005–06, 2008–09, 2009–10, 2010–11, 2012–13, 2014–15, 2015–16, 2017–18, 2018–19\n\nCopa del Rey: 2008–09, 2011–12, 2014–15, 2015–16, 2016–17, 2017–18, 2020-21\n\nSupercopa de España: 2006, 2009, 2010, 2011, 2013, 2016, 2018\n\nUEFA Champions League: 2005–06, 2008–09, 2010–11, 2014–15\n\nUEFA Super Cup: 2009, 2011, 2015\n\nFIFA Club World Cup: 2009, 2011, 2015\n\nArgentina U20\n\nFIFA U-20 World Cup: 2005\n\nArgentina Olympic team\n\nSummer Olympics: 2008\n\nArgentina Senior team\n\nCopa America: 2021, 2024\n\nFIFA World Cup: 2022"
