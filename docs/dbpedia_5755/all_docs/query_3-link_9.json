        "text": "Much like the players at FootballPlus, Lionel Messi started playing kids football at a young age and pursued his dreams at 13. Today, Messi is an undisputedly prominent figure in the football arena, known for his agility and control. Many aspiring football youths in Singapore look up to him as a role model. However, for Messi, it has always been more than just the question of ‘how to play football well’. The heart of the game and his character is what he chooses to focus on.\n\nDespite all his achievements, Messi always remembered the importance of humility. He embodies such a character not only on, but off the field. Despite being Barcelona’s top scorer, he still chose to serve the ball to his teammates on many occasions, entrusting them to a goal even when he had an opportunity to score. It takes humility to realise that we cannot play the game alone.\n\nAlongside his nimble footwork, Messi’s skills and character has definitely made him an outstanding player in the scene. The attitudes that he has displayed is something we wish to nurture in players at our football academy.\n\nEx-Barcelona Manager and Former Footballer, Tata Martino, talks about Messi’s Extraordinary Skills:\n\n“He sees passes that most people can only see whilst watching the game on TV, not ones that you can normally see on the pitch.”\n\nDespite pressures on field, Messi maintains his elegance in movements. The star player does not get distracted by the threat of his competitors. Instead, he engages in critical thinking, alongside his agility and composition. The ability for a player to continue performing his footwork well on the field boils down to him being able to keep his head in the game, all while enjoying it.\n\nHowever, Messi’s abilities are not what he prides himself in. He chooses to keep his eyes on character development, which to him is the heart of what is most important in his football career.\n\nMessi Talks about Character Development\n\n“I prefer to win titles with the team ahead of individual awards or scoring more goals than anyone else. I’m more worried about being a good person than being the best football player in the world. When all this is over, what are you left with? When I retire, I hope I am remembered for being a decent guy”\n\nMessi recognises that there are far more important things in life than his achievements on field. To him, it is not simply just about learning how to play the football. His humility grounds him to his biggest aspiration of wanting to constantly be a better person for himself and for others.\n\nNurturing Players of Character in our Academy\n\nTo us, football is more than just a sport. Football coaching is about teaching our players skills both on and off the field. It is more than just clinching titles or the technical football training we do. Instead, it is where life’s best lessons are learnt. No doubt, Messi’s personal qualities are what makes him an outstanding player. Similarly, with our youth football programs, we hope to nurture players in our academy to be individuals with outstanding characters."
