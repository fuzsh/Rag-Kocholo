        "meta_description": "The Netherlands Carillon has been a symbol of freedom and friendship between the Netherlands and the U.S. since World War II. In 2021, after enduring years of weather and corrosion, the Carillon underwent major renovations. The National Park Service removed, cleaned, and replaced all the exterior panels, and the Netherlands Embassy added three new bells to the instrument. Now, the Carillon is renewed, ringing, and ready for visitors! This project and this video were funded by your fee dollars.",
