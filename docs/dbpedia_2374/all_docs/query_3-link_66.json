        "text": "There is no wonder why Ticonderoga manifests historic charm, scenic beauty, and an abundance of recreation and activities, being the name’s origin is from the Iroquois word tekontaró:ken, meaning \"it is at the junction of two waterways.\" This lovely little town nestled between Lake George and Lake Champlain is sure to satisfy any vacationer’s cravings!\n\n1. Fort Ticonderoga and Mount Defiance\n\nFort Ticonderoga, previously Fort Carillon, is a large 18th-century fort built by the French located at the south end of Lake Champlain. Between museum exhibitions, lively daily programs, and special events and reenactments, a full day can be planned right at the Fort. In the warmer months the King’s Garden is the perfect spot to relax and take in the natural beauty of one of America’s oldest cultivated landscapes!\n\nTo further your Fort Ticonderoga experience, embark on a journey with Carillion Boat Cruises. Enjoy gorgeous, sweeping panoramas of Vermont's Green Mountains and New York's Adirondack Mountains during a 90-minute narrated boat tour aboard the Carillon and learn even more about the local history and heritage!\n\nFor optimal viewing, take a trek up Mount Defiance for an aerial look at the Fort and a panoramic view of Lake Champlain.\n\n2. Star Trek Original Series Set Tour and Montcalm Street\n\nWalking through the CBS licensed Star Trek Original Series Set Tour will make you think you stepped through your TV and onto the Enterprise itself! Here you’ll find the most accurate rebuild of the original sets, because the sets are complete recreations built using the original blueprints from the show!\n\nNo trip to Ticonderoga is complete without taking a stroll down Montcalm Street. Small businesses and restaurants with a hometown feel are sprinkled throughout the street, with promises of finding the perfect meal or souvenir from your Ticonderoga trip. The small shops here are great places to browse and find exactly what you’re looking for.\n\n3. Heritage Museum\n\nWalk into the ornate 1888 Building and take a step back in time to learn about Ticonderoga’s industrial history at the Heritage Museum. Discover the Ticonderoga Pencil’s origin and the many stages of what is now known as International Paper. In addition to operating as a museum, the 1888 Building also hosts children’s summer artist workshops during the months of July and August and has a gift shop of local artists’ pieces.\n\n4.

Ti triple play\n\nWhat better backdrop for a day of sports than the historic Lord Howe Valley, where the 18-hole Ticonderoga Golf Course is located. Serious and novice golfers alike can practice the sport here.\n\nFor the young and young at heart, Five Nations Golf offers a historically-themed Mini Golf with a fun and challenging course featuring locally produced decoration.
