The museum opened just three years after President Harding died from a heart attack in 1923. Mrs. Harding died 15 months later from kidney disease. In her will, she made arrangements for the home and the bulk of the contents to go into the hands of the Harding Memorial Association (HMA).\n\nThe HMA formed just after President Harding’s death on Aug. 2, 1923 to oversee fundraising to construct the Harding Memorial. They owned the 10-acre Memorial site and the Harding Home until 1978, when both sites were turned over to the State of Ohio. The sites today are administered by the Ohio History Connection with the help of local manager Marion Technical College.\n\nWhen the museum opened in February 1926, visitors could view just the first four rooms of the residence – the reception hall, parlor, library and dining room. The rooms were not presented as they were when the Hardings lived there; instead, all of the rooms featured glass display cases of objects. Photos and framed documents covered the walls. The on-site caretakers lived upstairs.\n\nIn 1965, the HMA completed a restoration of the Home, showcasing it for the first time as a house museum. The group chose 1900 as the year it wanted to depict, choosing wallpapers that reflected that year. The caretakers continued to perform the maintenance and lead tours but now lived off-site.\n\nHarriet Beecher Stowe House\n\nAdmission to the Harriet Beecher Stowe House is approx. $5/person.\n\nOpen: February – April on Saturday from 10am – 4pm, and Sunday from 12 – 4pm (last entry at 3pm).\n\nLocation: (Map It) 2950 Gilbert Avenue (State Route 3, U.S. 22) in Cincinnati, Ohio\n\nPhone: 513-751-0651\n\nWeb: click here\n\nThe Harriet Beecher Stowe House: Harriet Beecher Stowe is the author of Uncle Tom’s Cabin.

Tours on the hour.\n\nLocation: (Map It) 6152 Rankin Hill Road in Ripley, Ohio\n\nPhone: 800-752-2705\n\nWeb: click here\n\nThe John Rankin House in Ripley, Ohio, is a National Historic Landmark and a famous station on the Underground Railroad.\n\nThe brick home was built in 1825 by Reverand John Rankin and sits high atop Freedom Hill overlooking the small river town of Ripley, Ohio. It features extraordinary tales of bravery and fantastic views of the Ohio River and its meandering bends between the Appalachian foothills of southern Ohio and northern Kentucky.\n\nRankin began his 44-year ministry at Ripley’s Presbyterian church in 1822. He and his wife and 13 children were ardent abolitionists. They dedicated their lives to helping their fellow human beings. Reverend John Rankin was one of the most active “conductors” of the Underground Railroad. His family never lost a “passenger” along their trek of the line. Over the years, more than 2,000 “passengers” stayed at the Rankin House. At times, up to a dozen runaway slaves lived in the humble brick home in addition to the 15 family members. It only took one encounter for slave owners and hunters to learn not to try and seize escaped slaves from the Rankins. Family members always stood armed and watchful.\n\nThe Harriet Beecher Stowe novel Uncle Tom’s Cabin cites a true story of a lady pushing her child across the thin ice on the Ohio River, desperate to cross to the Rankin House. When a slave hunter met her on the other side, he was so moved by watching her determination that he let her pass through to the home on the hill, shining its candle in the window at night to guide her and so many other escaped slaves to potential freedom.\n\nMerely crossing the Ohio River didn’t bring freedom, even though Ohio was a free state. The Fugitive Slave Law of 1850 meant runaway slaves could be apprehended in free states and returned to slavery. The Underground Railroad had to get its “passengers” into Canada. Making it to the Rankin House was a milestone, to be sure, but the final trek from southern Ohio to northern Ohio and ultimately out of the United States still had many obstacles to maneuver.\n\nThe modest home has received more than $1 million in renovations to return it to an authentic representation of how it was when the Rankin family lived there. It is quite a time capsule.\n\nThe floorboards are original and in great shape. Several original family items, such as the family’s Bible, remain. Well-informed guides give tours. They learn vital information to share but are encouraged to do some research to develop additional points of interest to further make the Rankin House story come alive for its visitors. In her research, a young tour guide named Niya found that her fourth-generation grandfather was at the Rankin’s house in the 1840s.\n\nThis little place in the middle of nowhere attracts many visitors and has a large parking lot. The tour takes about 30 minutes. Another 30 minutes can be spent taking in the incredible scenery of the forested hills and Ohio River stretching east and west as far as the eyes can see.\n\nThe John Rankin House is one of those little stops you always remember.\n\nJohn P.

Parker once stood near this very same spot in the mid-1800s and decided to build a home and open his machine shop and foundry in this bustling rivertown.\n\nParker was a freed slave who would become a successful businessman and inventor, and from about 1850 until the end of the Civil War; he was one of the most active conductors on the Underground Railroad. At great risk to his own life and freedom, he repeatedly crossed into Kentucky to help enslaved brothers and sisters escape across the river in wooden boats.\n\nThe John P. Parker National Historic Landmark features exhibits, a display center of Parker’s products, and guided tours enlightening visitors about his adventurous, daring life. It is a travel destination for families eager to experience a compelling episode in American history when the Ohio River was the line between bondage and freedom.\n\nJohnston Farm & Indian Agency\n\nJohnston Farm & Indian Agency admission is approx. $10/person (less for kids).\n\nOpen: June – August on Thursday & Friday from 10am – 5pm, and Saturday & Sunday from 12 – 5pm.

The lives of the hard-working men who slog like moles hundreds of feet beneath, and sometimes miles back under the earth’s surface have always seemed intriguing as well as personifying the American spirit.\n\nSo, you would think that a material equated to gemstones would be applauded for its key role in the industrialization that made this the greatest nation on the planet. Instead, coal and mining, which currently gain news prominence only after a disaster, are almost viewed as antisocial.\n\nAlthough more than half of the power consumed in our country is still generated by coal, the “greenies” would like to eliminate its use altogether. And due to nearly complete removal from home use, knowledge by later generations of the fossil fuel known as “black diamonds” is limited to its extraction by hazardous, gritty labor, far removed from, and seemingly unrelated to the sanitized information age.\n\nBut there is an organization that does not want you to forget the vital function that coal has played in one of the most inventive and ingenious chapters of our history.\n\nThe nonprofit organization labeled “Little Cities of Black Diamonds” refers to the old “played out” coal mining communities in Hocking, Perry, and Athens counties of southeast Ohio. “Cities” denotes that during the boom years when coal was king (approximately 1850 to 1925) these communities, although small—were indeed city-like, providing every amenity that society had to offer.\n\nAnd it wasn’t just coal that created prosperity in the region. There was oil, clay and iron ore, but the production and use of those resources was only possible due to energy from coal and its derivative coke that created power and fired the kilns and furnaces.\n\nThe Black Diamonds’ organization feels that the story of coal and its influence should not be forgotten because it so accurately defines an era and the character of this part of the country.\n\nOne of my warmest memories of childhood is of those winter mornings hearing my father rattle the grate in the furnace and bank the fire. The expanding cast-iron jacket would soon begin to crackle and pop, echoing up through the ducts, and heat from the coal flames boiling through the registers would transform a cold house to comfort within minutes.\n\nWhen snow and ice turned our inclined driveway into a sled run, my father would spread the ashes and clinkers (incompletely burned impurities) in the tire tracks, and then drive up the hill like it was summer.\n\nBut coal furnaces, like steam locomotives, were not destined for the modern age. Although, even with the glory days gone, coal heat extended its popularity into the ‘70’s, and current industrial use persists because compared to alternatives, it is cheap, plentiful and reliable.\n\nOf course coal has its drawbacks, as anyone old enough to remember hosing the soot off a porch floor would know. Then we became aware of black lung disease, and acid rain due to the high sulfur content of coal found in the Appalachian basin. It was the latter that put a kink in the pipeline of southeastern Ohio coal production that it has never recovered from, even following the implementation of scrubbers on smoke stacks that clean up most of the pollution.\n\nConsidering coal’s demise, there is still much to be celebrated in the southern tri-county region and more history than you may be able to absorb in one trip. There are literally dozens of worked-out mines and related hamlets in the “black diamonds” area—some with little reason for existing other than displaying remnants of a vaunted past. But the organization has plotted thirteen specific destinations with enough varied interests to satisfy most anyone.\n\nThere are group tours for organized parties of 12-15 people. For $50 per person per day, one or two-day excursions are available that include transportation by van, lunch and a professional guide. But most people will probably prefer to tour at their own pace and curiosity since there is enough interest at single sites to hold you for an entire day.\n\nThe best starting point is at the Wayne Forest Visitors Center located on Rt. 33 between Nelsonville and Athens. The coal tipple-style building is headquarters for Ohio’s only national forest and they provide a driving tour map and brochure of the little cities and other novelties of the region. Some examples are:\n\nRobinson’s Cave (mine) in New Straitsville is the unofficial birthplace of United Mine Workers Union, and the nearby museum relates the history of the town and mining in general.\n\nShawnee is the best original example of boomtowns still standing in Ohio, and some say in the eastern U. S. Its Victorian architecture presents shopping, restaurants, museums and two opera houses. It’s one of the places where you’ll want a camera.\n\nHaydenville is billed as Ohio’s last company-owned town. Industrialist Peter Hayden who dealt in iron, clay and coal, built the town using houses, stores and churches to display his products. One of the houses is now a museum.\n\nNelsonville was at one time the gateway to the “little cities” area due to its location on both the Columbus and Hocking Valley Railroad and the Hocking Canal. It was, and remains the most prosperous of the rollicking cities that sprung up in the mining period, cresting at more than 8,000 residents. It’s also the present boarding point for the Hocking Valley Scenic Railroad that runs passenger cars up and down the valley during summer and fall. Call them at 800-967-7834 for more details.\n\nRendville stands out because it was a social experiment. Founder William P. Rend recruited blacks to work his mines, but with his blessings they also held the leadership positions of the town such as mayor, postmaster, physician, ministers, and labor union bosses. The original Baptist Church is now The Rendville Art Works, which is open every day but Sunday.\n\nIn addition to the historical sites, the area offers hiking trails, swimming, boating and fishing. Burr Oak State Park is said to be Ohio’s most remote and picturesque state park. Another bonus is the drive up SR 78 East from Bishopville. It’s known as the “Rim of The World.” The views are spectacular—especially at this time of the year.\n\nBut whatever you’re viewing, you’ll be aware that it was coal that developed this area, and its decline, perhaps, that has let it down—a useful cue that nothing is forever—that change is inevitable, and hopefully for the best.\n\nThe house I grew up in was eventually converted to electric, but regardless of the cleanliness, convenience and thermometer reading, we all agreed that it was somehow never as comfortable as coal-fired heat.\n\nIn recent times there are mornings when in that semi-conscious state, I hear that old coal furnace crackling and popping. At first the ghostly quality was frightening. There is nothing in my present house that can possible make that noise, yet I clearly hear it even when I’m awake enough to know I’m not dreaming. But I’ve learned to welcome the sound because when it ceases I get up; I’m warm, I’m comforted, and all seems to be right with the world.\n\nGo to LittleCitiesofBlackDiamonds.org or call 800-394-3011 or (local) 740-394-3011 for more information.\n\nMaria Stein Shrine of the Holy Relics\n\nWelcome to the Maria Stein Shrine of the Holy Relics.\n\nOpen: Friday & Saturday from 9:30am – 4pm, Sunday from 12 – 4pm, and Monday – Thursday from 9:30am – 6pm.\n\nLocation: (Map It) 2291 St. Johns Road in Maria Stein, Ohio\n\nWeb: https://mariasteinshrine.org/\n\nThe Maria Stein Shrine of the Holy Relics is situated on nearly 30 acres of beautifully landscaped, peaceful rolling grounds in rural Maria Stein, Ohio.

When the War Between the States broke out, they volunteered. All fifteen of them.\n\nThe Civil War was personal. What kind of men rush into a conflict knowing they might have to fight their neighbors or relatives? What goes through a man’s mind who encourages his brother and sons to join the fight knowing the odds are that some, maybe all of them will fail to return? It has been said that it is “the passion of fools and the most foolish of passions.” Patriotism.\n\nTo whatever instincts were embedded in the genetic code, it was definitely a passionate response by the McCooks—the fighting McCooks, as they became known.\n\nRecollection of American history frequently summons heroic names from both sides such as Sherman, Grant, Jackson and Lee. However, from schoolbooks, the McCook name barely jingles a distant bell, but it should chime with clarity. There was hardly a Civil War battle, north or south of the Mason-Dixon line, without the participation of a McCook.\n\nBut now you can discover what academia left out. The saga of the McCooks is related through chronicled accounts and memorabilia displayed at the antebellum McCook House Museum in Carrollton. The house is owned by the Ohio Historical Society and managed by the Carroll County Historical Society.\n\nThe house recently reopened after a $300,000 renovation kept it shuttered for the past six months. It’s easy to recognize. It’s the large building on the southwest corner of the Carrollton town square. It is notable for its Federalist architecture—a two-story red-brick box-like structure with prominent chimneys on either side, no porch or portico, and numerous windows. The house was built by Daniel McCook, a Carrollton attorney, in 1837 and occupied by his family that included eight sons and three daughters until 1848. The other part of the clan was Daniel’s brother John and his five sons, hailing from Steubenville (as did President Lincoln’s Secretary of War Edwin M. Stanton.)\n\nYou may explore the house at leisure, but guided tours are more rewarding, especially for Civil War buffs. Downstairs you will see the parlor, Daniel’s law office, dining room (now a Civil War display) and the original small kitchen. Then head upstairs to view the four large bedrooms.\n\nManager and tour guide Shirley Anderson says, “People are always surprised at the number of items displayed here.” There are five Civil War swords belonging to the McCook sons; Daniel’s Henry rifle; GAR medals, period furniture; and a large set of china purchased in Paris in the 1860s. There’s also a large painting of Daniel and his sons (a copy of the original hanging in the Statehouse in Columbus).\n\nWhen the war began, Daniel McCook was 63 years old—elderly by the standards of that era—but he volunteered as a nurse. Early in the conflict, he was present at the battle of Bull Run, where his son Alexander commanded the 1st Ohio regiment, and his eighteen-year-old son Charles fought in another regiment.\n\nOutnumbered, it was a humiliating defeat for the Union and Charles joined his father who was tending the wounded. When Johnny-Rebs overran the field hospital, Charles set off to rejoin his company, dispatching the first Reb with a well- placed shot, but was quickly surrounded and ordered to surrender. Seeing the futility, Daniel called upon the boy to submit, but Charles refused, calling back, “Father, I can never surrender to a Rebel. I will never surrender to a traitor.” At that point, he was shot in the back.\n\nWord of the young man’s brave resistance traveled fast—told and retold hundreds, possibly thousands of times, plus the various accounts in print, but the premise never deviated. Charles McCook became the cause celebre—his death the resulting harmony among those irrational impulses driving the war.\n\nJohn McCook and his five sons, all officers, were in for the duration, fighting every battle that came their way, and safely returned home. Daniel and his sons—five of whom were generals—possibly because of displaying extraordinary valor, did not fare as well.\n\nDaniel’s son, General Robert McCook, was seriously wounded but returned to the battlefield while still debilitated and issued orders from an ambulance wagon. When Rebels attacked the ambulance, he was unable to defend himself and was killed.\n\nIn 1863 Daniel who was not a cavalryman, but by then an aged paymaster, spontaneously seized a vacant command and led an advance party in an attempt to intercept marauders who had crossed the river near Cincinnati, and died in the skirmish.\n\nA quote by an unknown officer of the time exemplifies the McCooks: “They were born leaders; they were all men of noble bearing, such man as would naturally be selected in conflict requiring valor, judgment, and influence with men.“\n\nNothing more epitomizes that statement than the actions of Dan McCook Jr. Perhaps in a lapse of judgment, General William Tecumseh Sherman in his march across Georgia, ordered a near-suicidal assault on a Confederate stronghold atop Kennesaw Mountain. Colonel McCook, leading one of the three prongs of attack, quoted to his men inspirational historic verse about “how better to die than against fearful odds,” before making the charge up the mountain where he fell.\n\nDisplayed in the museum are two original military commissions for Alexander McDowell McCook. One has the signature of Abraham Lincoln—the other usually found more interesting—and is signed in 1854 by Jefferson Davis, at the time Secretary of War. Of course, Davis was later President of the Confederacy, against which commissioned officers were sworn to fight. It was a deliberative and confusing time.\n\nMuch has been said about the present understanding of honor and responsibility compared with the concept a century and a half ago. Today’s willingness to fight one’s neighbors and relatives, even over the most serious of disagreements, seems like a distortion of duty. But through all the mistakes, it can be said that they did what they thought was right. Where the McCooks were concerned, the simplest explanation may be that they just didn’t know when to quit.\n\nBy Robert A.

Cleveland’s Euclid Avenue, otherwise known as Millionaires Row, was once the residential street of some of the most influential families in American history and their lavish estates. These monstrous mansions with broad sweeping lawns, ornate architecture and wondrous landscapes used to be home to industrial tycoons and celebrated philanthropists like Rockefeller, Mather, Wade, Severance, Gund, Stone, Brush and Everett and political figures such as John Hay, Tom Johnson and Leonard Hanna. Now, only 10 homes remain on the once famed avenue. And most of those are hidden from view by the byproduct of their industrial architects – buildings. However, you can still take a stroll down memory lane and see what’s left but do so at your own risk because this isn’t exactly Rockefeller’s neighborhood anymore.\n\nThe homes that remain in whole or in part include the following:\n\nLuther Allen House (7609 Euclid Avenue)\n\nMorris Bradley Carriage House (7217 Euclid Avenue)\n\nJohn Henry Devereaux (3226 Euclid Avenue)\n\nFrancis Drury House (8625 Euclid Avenue)\n\nHall-Sullivan House (7218 Euclid Avenue)\n\nHowe Residence (2248 Euclid Avenue)\n\nSamuel Mather Residence (2605 Euclid Avenue)\n\nStager-Beckwith House (3813 Euclid Avenue)\n\nLyman Treadway House (8917 Euclid Avenue)\n\nH.W.

Guests experience life during the Canal Era on the Canal Town Journey tour, during which they are guided through historical buildings staffed with costumed interpreters and enjoy hands-on activities at the Visitor Center. Afterward, they may stroll the lush gardens, take a horse-drawn canal boat ride, browse the numerous quaint shops, and enjoy casual family dining.\n\nExcerpt from a past edition of OhioTraveler\n\nRoscoe Village was a vibrant center of commerce along the legendary Ohio & Erie Canal. Forty years ago, it was brought back to life. Today, visitors can ride the canal just like their traveling counterparts back in the 1830s on their way to the streets of a vibrant canal town and all its dressings.\n\nThe famous port town is now known as Historic Roscoe Village. As its guests step onto the red brick ways, they are pulled in different directions. Some come just to relax in the beautiful gardens, some enjoy the living history journey back in time, others thrive on the original shops, and everyone marvels at the dining atmosphere and specialty dishes. Roscoe Village is a fully functional town that basks in its history yet entertains today’s interests. Special events fill the calendar, hands-on activities abound, and for those that want to get lost in relaxation and Yesteryear, there’s a variety of lodging accommodations.\n\nThroughout the town, you see trendy shoppers and costumed canal-era interpreters mingling along the streets and in the shops. Bicyclists frequent the streetscapes, stopping for ice cream or a shade tree—tour groups snake in and out of historic buildings for hands-on experiences. Roscoe Village has always had a charm that attracts children, seniors, and young women on a girls’ day out. There’s that much to see, do, and enjoy.\n\nThe journey begins for most at the visitors’ center. It is there that sleeves are rolled up, and work begins. All ages are welcome to try their hand at candle dipping, making rope, punching tin, and crafting other bygone creations. A guide in period dress provides insight into the forgotten lifestyles of the town during the era long past. They demonstrate their skill at the workstations and provide punchy presentations filled with information, wit, and personality.\n\nThrough the gardens and down the road past a few historical homes is a blacksmith’s shop. The rather large, rickety, old, red barn is dark inside, but the blacksmith’s tools and workstation are strangely illuminated perfectly by the window light. Let the pounding begin. The blacksmith on duty will hammer and bend iron into just about anything the mind can imagine.\n\nA few shops down, there’s a building where brooms are made. A demonstration shows the strange old machines and techniques for making one of the most used tools of the 1800s. The tour guide may have a little-known tale, such as coaxing a spectator to jump over the broomstick on the floor followed by a bellowing – “Now we’re married.” Details are explained on-site.\n\nAll aspects of life are explored, including the doctor’s office where an exam is given, another stop is made to make a bucket, and a little house with huge looms goes into action weaving. One of the more fun, interactive moments comes in the old schoolhouse where kids of all ages experience something they know – school. Don’t misbehave, or you’ll experience something unknown in today’s classrooms – a ruler on the knuckles!\n\nAround lunchtime and dinner, too, the streets lure the hungry into the historic brick-and-stone eateries and fine dining houses. One of which is The Warehouse Steak n Stein. This architectural gem is smack in the middle of the village and, in the 1830s, was the Mill Store and main docking point for the village along the canal. Its lower level is P.R. Nyes Lock Twenty-Seven, accented by the canal’s original stone walls.\n\nAn after-dinner glass of wine or cup of coffee can be had at Uncorked Wine & Coffee Bar. With over 200 different types of wine, it’s a full-service bar with hot and cold gourmet coffees. Many find a great place to relax: on the patio, in the shade, listening to jazz or blues music.\n\nWalking off a bite to eat is an easy thing to do in Roscoe Village. The charming shops are diverse and unique. Visitors often hit them all because it’s so convenient to walk from one to the next, marveling at the façade and gazing at the merchandise.\n\nThe wares made by the village blacksmith, broom squire, weaver, and woodworker are available at the Village Crafter’s Shop, located in the Visitor Center.\n\nThe Roscoe General Store is a throwback to historic community general stores. It offers everything from antiques to collectible bears and pottery to unusual toys for kids. Its candy bouquet temps with Lindt’s truffles, jelly beans, lollipops and gourmet chocolates.\n\nThe shopping list goes on. River Ridge Leather tans leather the old-fashioned way and hand stitches leather handbags, belts, harnesses, and more. Visitors are invited to see a live demonstration of the old art and the trade’s original tools dating back to the 1800s.\n\nOver at Garden Gate, visitors find novel gardening gifts, herbs, flowers, fountains, and other accessories. The House of G.A. Fisher is known for one-of-a-kind jewels and keepsakes, Lenox, clocks, and watches. Liberty House has a fashionable collection of purses, scarves, wraps, and whimsical styles of women’s clothing. Wildwood Music is happy to hook you up with a handmade stringed instrument like a dulcimer, mandolin, banjo, or guitar. And the Village Soap & Candle Shop has lotions, soaps and powders that are primitive and homespun.\n\nAlthough walking around town may be like a living history museum outdoors and in, there is an actual museum to boot – The Johnson-Humrickhouse Museum. This nationally accredited museum has incredible collections in several galleries, including the American Indian Gallery, Historical Ohio Gallery, Decorative Arts Gallery, Oriental Gallery, and a Special Exhibits Gallery that features a variety of collections throughout the year.\n\nRoscoe Village is never more alive than during its special events. Annual favorites include the October Apple Butter Stirrin’ Festival and the December annual Christmas Candlelighting.\n\nWhen the day winds down, Historic Roscoe Village offers beautifully landscaped gardens to take a load off and melt into the scene on a park bench. Perhaps the favorite leisure-time activity is a 45-minute canal boat ride tugged by horses walking along the towpath along the canal banks. An overnight stay may be better instead of packing the plentiful activities into one day. Various lodging options are nearby and include bed and breakfasts, inns, cabins, guest houses, motels, campgrounds, and a lodge.\n\nRose Hill Museum\n\nAdmission to Rose Hill Museum is usually free.\n\nOpen: Hours vary.\n\nLocation: (Map It) 27715 Lake Road in Bay Village, Ohio\n\nPhone: 440-871-7338\n\nWeb: click here\n\nThe Rose Hill Museum in Bay Village: This museum home was built in 1818 as a private residence and once served as the town’s library.

Rather, it is the caretaker’s house for a lavish mansion that was never built. The stone castle-like home was built in the 1890s by Feargus Squire, one of the founders of Standard Oil Company. He had planned a summer estate in the Cleveland countryside. His plans changed when his wife died. And the mansion never left the drawing board. However, the Squire Castle is still a nice place to visit although it has been stripped of its glass windows, interior walls and furnishings and had the basement filled for fear of vandals. Still, wandering this stone home is interesting. It will leave the mind to wonder what if… Bring a picnic basket and spend the afternoon in the forest by this century-old architecture.\n\nStearns Homestead\n\nAdmission to Stearns Homestead is free.\n\nOpen: May – October on Saturday from 11am – 2pm\n\nLocation: (Map It) 6975 Ridge Road in Parma, Ohio\n\nPhone: email stearnshomestead@gmail.com or call 440-845-9770\n\nWeb: click here\n\nStearns Homestead in Parma: This 48-acre historical farm includes the 1855 Stearns House, 1920 Gibbs House, country store, meeting cabin, outbuildings, barn, and farm animals.

If you are traveling the modern streets of Rome, look to one side or another and you may see over a railing down to an excavation revealing what the community looked like thousands of years ago. The contrast is such that you lose yourself for a moment in wonder. So too is it – albeit on a smaller scale – when you drive through a small town in America and suddenly there’s a downtown within a downtown, both hundreds of years apart.\n\nWith globalization we have learned so much about so many things on a grand scale, we yearn for new discoveries. Adventurous minds have made remarkable finds in the nooks and crannies of history, often unearthing a vein of gold in the form of fascinating stories that capture the imagination at a local level. ….Read More….\n\nClick here to read the rest of the story\n\nYoder’s Amish Home\n\nAdmission to Yoder’s Amish Home is approx. $15/adult’s package and $10/kid’s package.\n\nOpen: Thursday – Saturday from 10am – 5pm from Spring to Fall.\n\nLocation: (Map It) 6050 State Route 515 in Millersburg, Ohio\n\nPhone: 330-893-2541\n\nWeb: https://yodersamishhome.com/\n\nYoders Amish Home is an authentic Amish farm.

Others flock to them. Those in the latter category will find esoteric thrills galore at the Punderson Manor State Park Lodge in northeast Ohio’s Punderson State Park. And it doesn’t have to be Halloween, or even a dark and stormy night, to bring on the action.\n\nSome employees have heard the sound of children’s laughter when there are no children around. Fires go out. Pencils fly across a room. Doors open and shut of their own volition. Faucets turn off and on with no one near. Televisions turn on by themselves – or off. Usually at inconvenient times.\n\nIt’s enough to make a housekeeper cry, “Stop!” and sometimes these strange occurrences do. For example, guests sometimes hear loud noises coming from rooms next to them, which are in fact unoccupied or, in one case, from the room above (except that guest was on the top floor). Most of these happenings are just annoying – or entertaining, depending on how open the guest is to experiencing such strange events.\n\nBut at least one event was pretty grisly: The specter of a lumberjack was seen hanging from a beam in the lounge for nearly three hours. Many staff members saw it. This was the only really scary event of dozens reported since the elegant 31-room manor opened in northern Ohio in the 1950s.\n\nThe land was originally settled by Lemuel Punderson and his wife, Sybal who operated a grist mill and distillery. After their deaths, the family sold it to W.B. Cleveland, whose heirs sold it to Detroit millionaire Karl Long in 1929.\n\nHistorians believe the 29-room mansion (with 14 baths) was being built for Long’s wife. Rumor has it, she disliked Detroit while others say it was just a vacation home for the Longs. But Long never completed the home as he lost his fortune during the Great Depression and died before the home was completed. The property reverted back to its original owners, the Cleveland family, and eventually to the state of Ohio.\n\nThe state finally completed construction on the mansion in 1956, turning it into a resort with both lodging and dining. It added 26 two-bedroom cabins and by the 1970s it was a popular getaway for Clevelanders as well as a stop for other travelers. It was about then that resort employees began reporting the strange goings-on.\n\nA self-proclaimed psychic spent some time on the property and says she spoke with a ghost who said he would continue to haunt the manor “until his rocking chair was returned.” Some think that the chair to which he refers is the rocking chair that belonged to Sybal Punderson, which was inherited by Cleveland and ended up in a historic collection.\n\nFew clues can be found to explain the other happenings. No children ever lived at the manor, and there were no suspicious or tragic deaths there, as far as anyone can tell. The manor, however, was built across the lake from the old Wales Hotel, which burned in 1885 and where some children died in the fire.\n\nMost guests don’t experience, or even seek out, these ghostly occurrences. They’re too busy playing golf on an 18-hole championship course, playing tennis or basketball, swimming in the pool, and boating or fishing at the nearby lake. There’s also great hiking in the summer and sledding, snowmobiling or cross-country skiing in winter.\n\nThe resort is managed by Xanterra Parks & Resorts and is open year round. To make reservations at the Punderson Manor State Park Lodge, call 1-800-282-7275 or visit pundersonmanorstateparklodge.com/.\n\nTo reserve rooms in these state parks or for more information, visit the individual web sites or ohiostateparklodges.com.

Situated along meandering Indian Creek, the 160-acre farm was purchased in 1820 by Elias Staley who built a commercial-sized distillery across from the grist mill that he and his brothers had built several years earlier for the previous owner. “Liquid Gold” was produced by the mix of grains from the Grist Mill and his handmade double copper distilled rye whiskey became the “profit of the times” for his pioneer family. Staley Rye Whiskey became famous for its quality. Customers (including Indians) came from miles around to get their jugs filled with the tasty liquid.\n\nAfter Elias’ death in 1866, sons Andrew, Simon, and John continued the distilling operation. During their lifetimes, the grist mill was expanded, a two-story warehouse was built, and the construction of a 1500 gallon mash tub enabling them to increase production. At times, there were 100 barrels aging in the Bond House and the distillery ran 24 hours a day.\n\nSimon’s son, George Washington Staley continued to operate the distillery after the death of his father and two uncles. It was his sad duty to close the doors of the family’s profitable whiskey distillery when Prohibition was made the law of the land in 1920. With great foresight, George hid the old stills and associated distilling equipment from the government agents on the top floor of the warehouse. He also recorded the mash bill or recipe that the family had used for 100 years.\n\nAfter George passed away, two generations came and went with only memories of whiskey-making times at The Staley Mill Farm. But the past met the present when the next generation (Joe and Missy) resurrected history.\n\nToday, a new artisan farm distillery has been built, and once again Staley Rye Whiskey is flowing from the still house. The distillery represents the legacy of early farm distilling: past, present, and future. It’s the only family-owned historic artisan farm distillery in the United States using the old-fashioned double copper distilling method. Whiskey is distilled using the original copper pot stills that Missy’s great-great-great-grandfather Elias used in 1820, the same mash bill, and the same water source (spring water).\n\nA “true sip of history”, these whiskeys are uniquely small batch where art and science meet in the middle to produce a spirit like no other. Award-winning, old-fashioned frontier whiskeys are created with a passionate dedication to authenticity using the Early American Distilling Method. Produced by the 6th generation, these historic artisans, keepers of the past, fan the flames of the future… The spirit of America in a bottle!\n\nA visit to Indian Creek Distillery will transport you to the “Old Northwest Territory” where the Frontier was wild and whiskey was king!\n\nSo come to the farm where it all began two centuries ago. Learn about upcoming events. Sample and purchase Early American Rye Whiskeys and shop for flasks, glasses, t-shirts, and more in the retail shop. The tasting room features the family’s historic photos and artifacts, some dating back to the early 1800s when Staley’s whiskey-making legacy began.\n\nHours are Thursday – Saturday from 10-5.

In addition, his typewriter, briefcase, family photographs, and more are on display.\n\nExcerpt from a past edition of OhioTraveler\n\nThe Night The Ghost Got In\n\nThe Ohio Lunatic Asylum burned down, killing seven people on November 17, 1868. Those grounds in downtown Columbus later included a house at 77 Jefferson Avenue. And from 1913-1917, the Thurber family rented it. On the 47th anniversary of the fire, two Thurber brothers were home alone upstairs when they heard footsteps circling the dining table below. When they investigated, standing at the top of the stairs, the sound faded. A rushing, pounding of feet leaped the steps two at a time with a dead bead for the two young men. But the young men did not see anybody there. Nonetheless, they frantically scurried into nearby rooms slamming doors behind.\n\nLater, James Thurber, one of the two brothers (attending Ohio State University at the time of the incident), penned “The Night the Ghost Got In.” Thurber went on to become a famous author, humorist, and cartoonist. As for the house at 77 Jefferson Avenue, it’s still there. And open for tours as a living museum.\n\nVisitors and residents at Thurber House, listed on the National Register of Historic Places, have also reported strange encounters with the unknown. The dining footsteps have reoccurred over the years, as have opening and closing doors, books flying off shelves, and a citing of a mysterious silhouette of a hefty, stooped figure moving about near a window. Another figure was reported in someone’s bedroom sitting in a rocking chair in the corner of the room, hunched, watching and then disappeared.\n\nIn 1984, the house opened as a literary arts center and museum of Thurber remnants. It is furnished in the style of the 1913-1917 period in which James Thurber lived there with his parents and two brothers. The first two floors are open daily for tours. At the direction of the Thurber family, unlike typical museums, visitors are encouraged to sit on chairs, play the piano, and otherwise act as guests to the home. Tours are daily (except holidays). Self-guided tours are free Monday through Saturday. Guided tours are offered on Sunday.\n\nIn addition, The Thurber House hosts many writing workshops, special events, a conference center next door, a Reading Garden (between the historic house and conference center), a gallery, and a museum shop. More information is available at www.thurberhouse.org, including detailed accounts of haunting witnessed over the decades.\n\nJames Thurber died from pneumonia on November 2, 1961. He is buried at Greenlawn Cemetery in Columbus, Ohio.\n\n“I have lived in the East for nearly thirty years now, but many of my books prove that I am never very far from Ohio in my thoughts and that the clocks that strike in my dreams are often the clocks of Columbus.”\n\n– James Thurber\n\nWestcott House\n\nAdmission to the Westcott House is approx. $20/person.\n\nOpen: Call to schedule docent-guided tours only\n\nLocation: (Map It) 1340 East High Street in Springfield, Ohio\n\nPhone: 937-327-9291\n\nWeb: click here\n\nWestcott House is Frank Lloyd Wright’s only Prairie Style home in Ohio.
