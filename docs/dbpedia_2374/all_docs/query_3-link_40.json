The National Park Service preserves the site and interprets the history of the Valley Forge encampment. The park contains historical buildings, recreated encampment structures, memorials, museums, and recreation facilities.\n\nThe park encompasses 3,500 acres (1,400 ha)[2] and is visited by over 1.2 million people each year. Visitors can see restored historic structures, reconstructed structures such as the iconic log huts, and monuments erected by the states from which the Continental soldiers came. Visitor facilities include a visitor center and museum featuring original artifacts and providing an introduction to the American Revolution and the Valley Forge encampment. Ranger programs, tours (walking and trolley), and activities are available seasonally. The park also provides 26 miles (42 km) of hiking and biking trails, which are connected to a regional trails system. Wildlife watching, fishing, and boating on the nearby Schuylkill River also are popular.\n\nHistorical encampment\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Valley Forge\n\nApproximately 12,000 Continental Army troops under George Washington's command were encamped at Valley Forge from December 19, 1777 to June 19, 1778. Washington chose the site for the encampment because it was between the Second Continental Congress in York and supply depots in Reading, and close to Philadelphia, the revolutionary capital that the British occupied following the Battle of Brandywine and the city's fall.\n\nThe Valley Forge encampment was one of the most trying moments for the Continental Army during the war, but they also used the encampment to retrain and rejuvenate. The shared hardship of the officers and soldiers of the Continental Army and the professional military training provided by Baron Friedrich von Steuben are considered a turning point in the Revolutionary War, which secured the independence of the Thirteen Colonies and the establishment of the United States.\n\nPark history\n\n[edit]\n\nValley Forge was established as the first state park of Pennsylvania in 1893 by the Valley Forge Park Commission (VFPC) \"to preserve, improve, and maintain as a public park the site on which General George Washington's army encamped at Valley Forge.\"[3] The area around Washington's headquarters was chosen as the park site. In 1923, the VFPC was brought under the Department of Forests and Waters, then incorporated into the Pennsylvania Historical and Museum Commission in 1971.[3]\n\nValley Forge was designated a U.S. National Historic Landmark in 1961 and was listed in the initial National Register of Historic Places in 1966.[4][5] The area covered by these listings goes outside what was the Valley Forge State Park boundaries to include four historic houses where the Marquis de Lafayette and other officers were quartered.[5]: 6\n\nIn 1976, Pennsylvania gave the park as a gift to the nation for the United States Bicentennial. Congress passed a law, signed by President Gerald Ford on July 4, 1976, authorizing the addition of Valley Forge National Historical Park as the 283rd Unit of the National Park System[6] and allocating a budget for essential facilities.[7]\n\nThe Centennial and Memorial Association of Valley Forge[8] was incorporated in 1878 with the purpose of saving, acquiring, and preserving General Washington’s Headquarters and surrounding acreage.[9] A large Centennial event was held on June 19, 1878, the 100th anniversary of Washington’s Army exiting Valley Forge.[10]\n\nPark Superintendents\n\n[edit]\n\nState Park Superintendents\n\n[edit]\n\nFrederick D.

Ninety-minute bus tours of the park and bike rentals are available seasonally. The 18-minute film \"Valley Forge: A Winter Encampment\" is shown in the park's theater next door.\n\nRanger in Continental Army uniform explaining Revolutionary War artillery\n\nVisitor Center\n\nHeadquarters buildings\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Washington's Headquarters (Valley Forge)\n\nA key attraction of the park is the restored colonial home used by General George Washington as his headquarters during the encampment. Rehabilitation of the headquarters area was completed in summer 2009 and included the restoration of the old Valley Forge train station into an information center, new guided tours, new exhibits throughout the landscape, and the elimination of several acres of modern paving and restoration of the historic landscape. Quarters of other Continental Army generals are also in the park, including those of Huntington, Varnum, Lord Stirling, Lafayette, and Knox.\n\nReconstructed works and buildings\n\n[edit]\n\nThroughout the park there are reconstructed log cabins of the type thought to be used during the encampment. Earthworks are visible for the defense of the encampment, including four redoubts, the ditch for the Inner Line Defenses, and a reconstructed abatis. The British burned the original forges on Valley Creek three months before Washington's occupation of the area; neither the Upper Forge site nor the Lower Forge site has been reconstructed.\n\nWashington Memorial Chapel\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Washington Memorial Chapel\n\nThe Washington Memorial Chapel and National Patriots Bell Tower carillon sit atop a hill at the center of the park. The chapel is a functioning Episcopal Church, built as a tribute to Washington.[17] The bell tower houses the Daughters of the American Revolution Patriot Rolls, listing those who served in the Revolutionary War.\n\nMemorial markers\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: National Memorial Arch\n\nThe National Memorial Arch dominates the southern portion of the park and is dedicated \"to the officers and private soldiers of the Continental Army December 19, 1777 – June 19, 1778\". It was commissioned by Congress in 1910 and completed in 1917. It is inscribed with George Washington's tribute to the perseverance and endurance of his army:\n\nThe drive is lined with large memorial stones for each of the brigades that encamped there. Crossing Gulph Road at the arch, the drive proceeds through the Pennsylvania Columns and past the hilltop statue of Anthony Wayne on horse. More brigade stones line Port Kennedy Road.\n\nA comprehensive free Valley Forge audio tour is available with over 40 historical narrations tied to GPS coordinates.\n\nMount Joy Observation Tower\n\n[edit]\n\nA steel observation tower used to stand on top of Mount Joy, the highest elevation in the main park area, but it was closed in the 1980s because of deterioration and liability concerns. It was removed and shipped to a private area near Wellsboro, Pennsylvania, where people can still climb it.\n\nTrails\n\n[edit]\n\nThere are 26 miles (42 km) of hiking and biking trails within the park, such as the Valley Creek Trail and the River Trail. The main trail is the Joseph Plumb Martin Trail, which encircles 8.7 miles of the park. Portions of regional trails also run through the park, including the Horse Shoe Trail and the Schuylkill River Trail.\n\nRecreation\n\n[edit]\n\nThe many trails in Valley Forge allow for different activities such as jogging, walking and biking. Other activities include horseback riding and canoeing/kayaking. There are three picnic areas located on the site. In addition, Park Rangers dressed in period uniforms are stationed as the Muhlenburg Brigade Huts and Washington's Headquarters, ready to inform visitors about the historic events that happened on the site. The Valley Forge 5-Mile Revolutionary Run is also held in the park every April.\n\nTrain station\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Valley Forge station\n\nThe Valley Forge Train Station is near Washington's Headquarters. It was completed in 1911 by the Reading Railroad and was the point of entry to the park for travelers who came by rail through the 1950s from Philadelphia, 23.7 miles (38.1 km) distant.[18] The station was restored in 2009 and is used as a museum and information center that offers visitors a better understanding of Washington's Headquarters and the village of Valley Forge.[19] It is constructed of the same type of stone as Washington's Headquarters.[20]\n\nModern problems\n\n[edit]\n\nIn 2001, a privately held 62-acre (25 ha) tract of land was offered for sale within the park boundaries. Toll Brothers, a real estate development company, purchased it for $2.5 million. The federal government bought it from the developer two years later for $7.5 million.[21]\n\nIn 2007, the non-profit American Revolution Center purchased 78 acres (32 ha) of land within the park boundary with plans to construct a conference center, hotel, retail, campground, and museum on the site.[22] The National Parks Conservation Association and local citizens sued Lower Providence Township over the zoning change that enabled this proposal.[23] The two parties agreed to allow the NPS to keep the land, and in exchange, the American Revolution Center was given property in Philadelphia, where it built the Museum of the American Revolution.\n\nAn overpopulation of white-tailed deer has resulted in \"changes in the species composition, abundance, and distribution of native plant communities and associated wildlife\" in the park. In 2008, the National Park Service released a draft deer management plan and environmental impact statement for public review. The intent of the plan was to \"support long-term protection, preservation, and restoration of native vegetation and other natural resources within the park.\"[24] Hunting is prohibited by the legislation that created the park, and action by Congress would be required before it could be sanctioned.[25]\n\nGallery\n\n[edit]\n\nSee also\n\n[edit]\n\nPhiladelphia portal\n\nFreedoms Foundation at Valley Forge\n\nList of National Historic Landmarks in Pennsylvania\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]"
