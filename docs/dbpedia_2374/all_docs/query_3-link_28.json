        "text": "Description\n\nNaperville Riverwalk was built by residents in 1981 to commemorate the city's 150th birthday. Since then, it has become a focal point of the community and is recognized as one of the most beautiful spots in the Midwest, and has won state and national awards. Its covered bridges, fountains, landscaping, and distinctive shepherd's-crook light poles have become symbolic of Naperville's ties to its historic past as the oldest settlement in DuPage County. Visitors travel from far and near to enjoy the splendor of the Riverwalk and the quaint restaurants and shops in downtown Naperville. Known as the \"Crown Jewel of Naperville\" the Riverwalk attracts lunchtime strollers, families and early morning joggers. Stroll along the brick-paved winding paths of the Riverwalk, view the art pieces of the Century Walk, have a picnic at the pavilion, or enjoy a summer outdoor concert. A memorial to the victims of the September 11 attack is located on the Riverwalk's south bank, adjacent to City Hall."
