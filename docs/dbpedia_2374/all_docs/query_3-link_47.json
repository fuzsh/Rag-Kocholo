        "text": "Hiking and Biking Trail Maps at Knoch Knolls Park\n\nEnlarge the Map\n\nFind more information about Park District trails here.\n\nA Brief History of Land Acquisition at Knoch Knolls Park\n\nOn March 24, 1980, the Naperville Park District received 13 acres of farmland as a donation from Judge Win Knoch and Irene Knoch to be used for park purposes for the benefit of all that are entitled to the use of park lands. Following this donation, the Park District purchased the remainder of the Knoch farmland, totaling 115 acres, with assistance from a Land and Water Conservation Grant in the amount of $625,933. In 1988, the Park District purchased Glyman Woods to the east (55.8 acres) with the assistance of a $300,000 Open Space Lands Acquisition and Development (OSLAD) grant, and then added the Biannucci Confluence to the west in 1989, which expanded Knoch Knolls Park to approximately 218 acres. In 2021, a Beneficiary of the Frank Rus Trust donated nearly 40 acres of land to expand Knoch Knolls Park to the west. More information about this donation can be found below.\n\nFrank Rus Preserve at Knoch Knolls Park\n\nThe Frank Rus Preserve at Knoch Knolls Park is a 39.95--acre wooded area on the west side of Knoch Knolls Park that was donated to the Naperville Park District through a gifting agreement with the Beneficiary of the Frank Rus Trust. This land already has been designated as preservation land under a Grant of Conservation Right and Easement dated June 14, 2000 and administered by The Conservation Foundation. The Park District will continue to maintain the land as open space for the community. The west side of the property is open to the public. Visitors may park their vehicles in the parking lot at Knoch Knolls Park and access the Frank Rus Preserve via the DuPage River Trail. Per the donation agreement, the east side of the property will remain closed to the public at this time.\n\nTurf trail access to Frank Rus Preserve - Click Here\n\nAmenities\n\nKnoch Knolls Park Map\n\nTurf trail access to Frank Rus Preserve\n\nOne route for hiking to confluence\n\nKnoch Knolls Park Nature Center & Disc Golf Course\n\nAdditional Area Trails & Maps\n\nDuPage County Trail Map\n\nDuPage River Trail Map\n\nNaperville Biking Map & Info\n\nRegional Water Trails Map & Info\n\nSeasonal Events\n\nSpring Wildflowers\n\nEach spring the Lower Grove Picnic Area explodes with color due to the Virginia Bluebells blossoms.

Join a Naturalist on a family, or adult, hike to view this autumn display. Check our fall Program Guide for dates and times.\n\nMobile Tours\n\nKnoch Knolls Park offers three outdoor mobile tours to use on your smartphone. These self-guided tours are available anytime the park is open - sunrise to one hour after sunset. Our Scavenger Hunt is designed for families, scout groups, and homeschoolers.

Rus pavilion installation and site improvements project is planned to be completed in 2024 at Knoch Knolls Park as a result of a generous donation in the amount of $250,000 from the Frank J. Rus Trust to assist with funding the project. The new pavilion will support the Park District's outdoor educational and recreational programs and provide visitors to the park with an area to picnic in a beautiful natural setting. The pavilion is being constructed in the Upper Grove of Knoch Knolls Park, which is located on the south side of the DuPage River and accessible from the bicycle/pedestrian bridge. The Park District planned to repair the existing fireplace as part of the pavilion installation. However, during the initial repair, it was identified that the bricks, joints, and structural components were no longer stable and a new fireplace would need to be built as part of the project. The new fireplace will be very similar in size and appearance when compared to the earlier version. The Frank J. Rus pavilion installation and site improvements project is slated to be completed and ready for community use this summer.\n\n2023 Projects\n\nInvasive removal will be happening in a section of woodland at Knoch Knolls Park in the next week. This will include the removal of dead wood and standing dead trees. This will be happening on the south side of the river near the firepit area.\n\nInvasive woody plants and less desirable species are being removed in two other areas to provide space for new and existing desirable species.\n\nKnoch Knolls Park 2023 Project Maps\n\n2022 Projects\n\nWoody plants, including box elder trees and invasive buckthorn and honeysuckle, are being removed along the river shoreline to better stabilize the banks, minimize erosion, and enhance water quality in the river. Following removals, the area will be planted with a seed mixture of native plants to protect the shoreline from erosion and promote a healthy, diverse ecosystem.
