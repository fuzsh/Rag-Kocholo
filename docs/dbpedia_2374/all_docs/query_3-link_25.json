        "text": "The Charles Baird Carillon, third heaviest in the world, contains 53 bronze bells cast by John Taylor & Co. in Loughborough, England. The largest bell, which strikes the hour, weighs 12 tons, while the smallest bell, 4½ octaves above, weighs just 15 pounds. In 2011, the carillon underwent a restoration to return the original highest two octaves of bells and original keyboard.\n\nHistory\n\nCharles Baird, the University of Michigan’s first athletic director, donated the carillon. The iconic Burton Memorial Tower on Ingalls Mall, built with funds donated by hundreds of Ann Arbor community members, is named for former University president Marion Leroy Burton. The tower and its carillon were dedicated in 1936.\n\nIn celebration of the University’s bicentennial, the tower floodlights were replaced with a new system that illuminates Burton Tower and its carillon from within, with more than 100 LED bulbs that can be programmed in a multitude of colors.\n\nThe University added a second carillon in 1996. The Ann and Robert H. Lurie Carillon of 60 bells stands on the Eda U. Gerstacker Grove on North Campus.\n\nVisiting the Baird Carillon\n\nThirty-minute recitals are performed on the Charles Baird Carillon at noon every weekday that classes are in session, followed by visitor Q&A with the carillonist from 12:30–12:45 pm. There are no open recitals on campus holidays, study days, or final examination days. An online schedule of recitals, rehearsals, and instructional playing time on the Baird Carillon is available on Google Calendar.\n\nThe bell chamber may be accessed via a combination of elevator and stairs. Take the elevator to the highest floor possible (floor 8), and then climb two flights of stairs (39 steps) to the bell chamber (floor 10). Earplugs are available from the carillonist upon request. Be prepared to walk on ice and snow in the bell chamber during winter.\n\nBuilt in 1936, the Charles Baird Carillon is not ADA accessible. Visitors with mobility concerns are invited to visit the ADA-accessible Lurie Carillon."
