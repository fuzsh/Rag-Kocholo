Featuring a number of exhilarating tunnel slides and the Archeology Adventure Zone, History on the Hill has become a popular spot for guests of all ages.\n\nComplete with picturesque walking trails, wild flowers, idyllic shelters, historical artifacts, geological remnants, and a breathtaking bird’s eye view of Carillon Historical Park and the city of Dayton, the Moraine Trails are the Park’s best-kept-secret.\n\nThe History on the Hill exhibit highlights the evolution and cultivation of the Carillon Historical Park property and the remnants of the quarantine hospital and ancient Hopewell earthen enclosure that once stood on the grounds."
