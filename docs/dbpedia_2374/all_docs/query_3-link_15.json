        "text": "See why The University of Alabama campus is recognized as one of the Most Beautiful Colleges in the South and Tuscaloosa has earned the reputation as one of the Top 30 College Towns in the nation.\n\nFounded in 1831 as the stateâs flagship university, The University of Alabama is steeped in tradition and success. Legends have been made in our academic halls, on our athletic fields and courts, and in our endeavors to shape a better world through our teaching, research and service. The University of Alabama has always focused on being the best. This is Where Legends Are Made.\n\nWhether youâre planning a trip to tour campus or coming to town for a game, we look forward to welcoming you to Tuscaloosa and The University of Alabama campus. Our prominent campus is nationally renowned for its beauty, immaculate upkeep, award-winning student housing and first-class academic buildings and laboratories. And while our University is among the best in the nation, itâs not the only great thing about Tuscaloosa, Alabama, which USA Today ranked as one of the Top 30 college towns in America. The Druid City features a vibrant downtown with several music venues, art galleries and some of the best restaurants in the state. When you visit, youâll quickly see thereâs no place quite like Tuscaloosa.\n\nLearn more about the Universityâs history through stopovers at noteworthy locations such as Malone-Hood Plaza, Autherine Lucy Hall, Manderson Landing, Denny Chimes, Bryant Museum, the Walk of Champions and Bryant-Denny Stadium. Other UA must-sees include our contemporary facilities, including Drummond Lyon Hall, Julia Tutwiler Hall, Hewson Hall and Stran-Hardin Arena. From tulips and cherry blossoms in the spring to golden leaves in the fall, a walk around campus is sure to impress.\n\nTop Photo Spots on Campus\n\nOutdoor Campus Attractions\n\nCrimson Promenade\n\nDedicated in 2001 and recently renovated, the Crimson Promenade brick walkway celebrates the achievements of generations of UA students, alumni, leaders and friends. More than 18,000 personalized pavers are located adjacent to the Student Center.\n\nBryant-Denny Stadium\n\nBryant-Denny Stadium is not only one of the most iconic facilities on The University of Alabama campus, but it is also often one of the most visited destinations in the state. The current seating capacity of 100,077 makes Bryant-Denny Stadium one of the nation's largest on-campus football stadiums.\n\nWalk of Champions\n\nThe Walk of Champions, featuring relief tributes to UAâs championship football teams as well as statues of Bear Bryant, Nick Saban and other championship-winning football coaches, is outside Bryant-Denny Stadium.\n\nDenny Chimes & the Quad\n\nLocated on the Universityâs Quad, the tower was named in honor of former University President George H. Denny. Completed in 1929, Denny Chimes offers carillon performances throughout the day. Outside the chimes, concrete blocks â the Walk of Fame â display handprints, footprints and names of UA football captains, including Joe Namath, DeVonta Smith, Derrick Henry and Bryce Young.\n\nMalone-Hood Plaza & Autherine Lucy Clock Tower\n\nOutside Foster Auditorium stands the Malone-Hood Plaza and Autherine Lucy Clock Tower, which honor the three people who integrated The University of Alabama: Autherine Lucy, Vivian Malone and James Hood. Built in 1939 and named for former UA President Richard Clarke Foster, Foster Auditorium is listed on the U.S. Civil Rights Trail.\n\nManderson Landing\n\nThe site of a former lock on the Black Warrior River, the Park at Manderson Landing features a paved walking trail along the river, picnic areas and UA Rowingâs boathouse. The site also features a stunning 30-foot statue of Minerva and a bicentennial timeline sculpture, both dedicated in December 2019.\n\nMarr's Spring\n\nTucked behind the Student Center lies Marrâs Spring, originally the Universityâs main water source. The area encompasses the spring and a man-made lake, both surrounded by a walking path, and multiple benches. It is a great spot to unwind or have a picnic.\n\nPeter Bryce Preserve\n\nThe Peter Bryce Preserve, located on the east and west sides of Bryce Lawn Drive leading to Bryce Main, is 23 acres of green space that includes numerous beautiful trees, Adirondack chairs and benches for relaxing and a walking path. In March 2023, A Southern Magnolia tree located at the Bryce Preserve was recognized as an Alabama Champion Tree by the Alabama Forestry Commission for being the largest of that species in the state.\n\nPresident's Mansion\n\nThe Presidentâs Mansion was built originally in 1841 and survived the 1865 Civil War burning of the campus. The building serves as the private residence for the UA president. It also serves as a reception center for dignitaries and events hosted by the president, and is a favorite photo spot, especially for UA grads.\n\nTuska Plaza\n\nTuska, a 19-foot-tall, seven-ton bronze elephant statue that resided at the NorthRiver Yacht Club for more than 20 years, was placed at the corner of University Boulevard and Wallace Wade Avenue in spring 2021. The bronze elephant statue is believed to be the largest of its kind in the world. The Tuska Plaza project included new landscaping, a large pedestal for Tuska to stand on, sidewalks surrounding the statue and lighting.\n\nRose Administration Building\n\nNoted for its unique elephant topiary, the Rose Administration building is named in honor of the 21st University president Frank Anthony Rose whose administration saw the successful integration of the campus, the glory days of Paul âBearâ Bryant, and the protection of student rights during the start of the Vietnam War.\n\nWoods Quad\n\nThe original campus quadrangle built after the Civil War and the site of the first Alabama football game, Woods Quad now holds a Sculpture Garden. Currently, seven sculptures occupy the quad grounds, including Goldie, a robot lying on its side, which was forged at Sloss Furnaces in Birmingham.\n\nThe Arts & Museums\n\nAlabama Museum of Natural History\n\nLocated in Smith Hall, museum exhibits show off Alabamaâs rich natural history, including fossil tracks, skulls and skeletons, a Basilosaurus cetoides â the state fossil of Alabama â and rocks and minerals. The museum hosts family-friendly events, as well as summer trips and camps.\n\nGorgas House Museum\n\nBuilt in 1829, the museum is the oldest structure on UA's campus and one of four buildings to survive the 1865 campus Civil War burning. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1971.\n\nMoundville Archaeological Park\n\nOn the Black Warrior River 13 miles south of Tuscaloosa, the park preserves massive flat-topped earthen pyramids, arranged around a vast central plaza. The park frequently hosts hands-on events, including the annual Native American Festival, which celebrates Native American culture through performers, vendors, demonstrators, living history teachers and more.\n\nPaul R. Jones Museum\n\nLocated in downtown Tuscaloosa, the museum houses exhibits drawn from the Paul R. Jones Collection of American Art, one of the largest and most comprehensive collections of 20th-century African American art in the world. The museum also hosts lectures, concerts, workshops and theatre performances.\n\nPaul W. Bryant Museum\n\nLocated on UA's campus, the museum exhibits artifacts and memorabilia that trace the long history of University of Alabama football.

Situated along the banks of the Black Warrior River in west-central Alabama, the city lies about an hour southwest of Birmingham.

The area offers a wide range of outdoor spaces highlighting Alabamaâs natural beauty.
