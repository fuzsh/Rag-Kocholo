        "text": "What is a city? Is it a mere collection of streets, homes, and buildings where people live and work? Or is it something more than that?\n\nI view a city as something akin to a living, breathing organism, everchanging, and yet reflecting the hopes, dreams, and aspirations of the people there.\n\nWhile cities do change over time (they have to), they also retain a certain DNA that sets them apart, which makes them different from other places. The same can be said for regions that surround or encompass a city or cities. Each has a certain character that is revealed to the casual observer over time.\n\nThe more that I have visited Dayton, Ohio, and the surrounding region in Southwest Ohio, the more I have become intrigued by the \"Gem City.\" By the way, no one knows why it became known as that. One explanation is that came from an article from August 18, 1845, written by a Cincinnati Chronicle reporter known as “T:”\n\n“The most indifferent observer will not fail to notice Dayton. The wide streets, kept in excellent order, the noble blocks of stores, filled with choice, and of course, cheap goods, and more than all, the exceeding beauty and neatness of the dwellings, you at once mark with a 'white stone,' in a small bend of the Great Miami River, with canals on the east and south, it may be fairly said that Dayton is the gem of all our interior towns; it possesses wealth, refinement, enterprise and a beautiful country.”\n\nI have seen it change, all the while retaining its culture of innovation that I believe continues to set it apart from other places. If you look back at Dayton's history, you see great minds collaborating with one another and making big things happen. In the first decade of the 20th century, Dayton generated more patents per person than New York, Boston, Cleveland, Philadelphia, or Detroit. Entrepreneurs thrived.\n\nMany people say the Dayton metro area’s economy today is largely on “eds, meds and feds,” referring to jobs in education, healthcare, and government. And there is a great deal of truth to that: education and health services account for about 18 percent of total local employment, and government accounts for about 16 percent of local jobs, while trade, transportation and utilities represent about 17 percent.\n\nBut were it not for manufacturing, now representing 11 percent of local jobs, Dayton would not be Dayton. “Dayton was built on building things,” wrote Thomas Gnau, a reporter for the Dayton Daily News who covers manufacturing, military affairs and business.\n\nAs one who grew up in a manufacturing family, I make no secret of my bias in favor of American manufacturing. I believe that if our nation is to remain a superpower, we have to make things. And, thus, Dayton has a real feel to it for me. There is something substantial here.\n\n“Industrial technology” — a catchall term for manufacturing, robotics and hardware production -- is making a comeback in Dayton and countless other places in America's Heartland. And this is as it should be.\n\nAs the U.S. economy took off after World War II, Dayton was home to the largest concentration of General Motors employees outside of Michigan. The city was the birthplace of more than a few companies that became Fortune 500 stalwarts. They included National Cash Register (NCR), Mead Paper Company, Standard Register, Reynolds and Reynolds, Dayco and Phillips Industries. Many are gone now.\n\nDayton's population peaked at just over 262,000 in 1960, and today it's about half that. Like other cities in the industrial Midwest, Dayton lost people in the decades that followed due to white flight to the suburbs, interstate highways that made commuting easier, relocation of manufacturing to lower-cost states (the Southeast particularly benefitted and still does to some degree) and a perception of higher crime.\n\nBut I am convinced those things no longer hold Dayton back. Indeed, I see billions of dollars being invested in downtown Dayton and detect a positive vibe when talking to its people. I also see a rejuvenation of smarter manufacturing, armed with 3-D printing and artificial intelligence, and an influx of entrepreneurs with big dreams.\n\nAccording to the book, “The Titanium Economy: How Industrial Technology Can Create a Better, Faster, Stronger America,\" we are now entering a renewed manufacturing era, what the authors call \"the Great Amplification Cycle.\"\n\nI also think we will see more companies reshoring their factories from China and elsewhere and that we will see more companies building manufacturing operations in smaller metro areas like Dayton.\n\nAnd while America’s love affair with Big Tech appears to be waning with significant layoffs crashing across Silicon Valley, manufacturing continues to add jobs, to the tune of 367,000 new jobs this year alone. Manufacturing grew by 32,000 jobs in October, continuing what can only be interpreted as a historic resurgence of this blue-collar sector, which now provides 137,000 more jobs than it did before the pandemic.\n\nThis aligns with the Biden administration's focus on supporting domestic manufacturing, supply-chain resilience, and creating good manufacturing jobs at home. Again, Dayton and the surrounding region is well positioned to take advantage of these opportunities.\n\nStarting in the early school years, the Dayton region has developed numerous programs to provide a skilled workforce. They include Preschool Promise, STEM educator training, ideation, and mentor relationships. Currently, more than 25,000 students from the 14-county region are enrolled in Tech Prep, Project Lead the Way, and Ohio College Credit Plus (CCP).\n\nPrivate industry and the Wright-Patterson Air Force Base are partnering with local universities and community colleges to graduate top talent. Within a 60-mile radius, there are more than 120 degree-granting institutions.\n\nThe logical starting point and ending point for economic development -- and this goes for any community -- are workers learning new skills, bringing home fatter paychecks, buying homes, and upgrading their lives. Success then builds upon success. More people come looking for a better quality of life. (For what it's worth, the Dayton region sports the nation's largest paved bike trail network with more than 340 miles of paved, multi-use bikeways.)\n\nAnd when more people come, more businesses open, injecting capital and contributing to the local culture. This is not theory, it happens. I’ve seen it before and I’m seeing it again in Dayton, a city that is investing in itself. Every time I have returned, I have seen progress.\n\nConsider just these recent developments:\n\nHonda will spend $3.5 billion on a new battery production site in Fayette County, about an hour southeast of Dayton, that is expected to create 2,200 new jobs. Construction will start next year.\n\nFuyao Glass America, the world’s largest automotive glass supplier, will spend $300 million and create 500 new jobs by expanding its windshield production plant in Moraine. The Chinese-based company began production in a former General Motors assembly in October 2016. Fuyao employs more than 2,000 workers at the facility.\n\nMore than $2 billion has been invested in the greater downtown Dayton area in the last 12 years, as hundreds of new apartments and hotel rooms are being built. Projects in the pipeline could push the total north of the $3 billion mark, according to the Downtown Dayton Partnership. Among the companies that have moved downtown are a host of defense and tech companies, including JJR Solutions, Barbaricum, cybersecurity firm Tenant3, digital signage company Stratacache (which owns a historic office building downtown), Mile Two, and Parallax Advanced Research, located in the rebirthed The Hub section of the Dayton Arcade, a downtown icon that has been reborn. (See the story below Rebirth of an Entrepreneurial Hub Downtown.)\n\nThe Dayton International Airport has become a dynamic hub for aerospace, logistics and manufacturing companies. Sierra Nevada is currently constructing a hangar for MRO facilities at the airport and is expected to create about 147 new jobs. It joins Procter & Gamble, Spectrum Brands, Crocs, Chewy Inc., Purina Mills, and others.\n\nThe signs are there for all to see, that a transformation to a titanium economy, a creative economy, and an innovation economy, is well underway. This is history repeating itself as you will learn in the stories below. Dayton, with its tradition of collaboration, has a strong foundation to build upon.\n\nNo One Living Can Guess What is Coming\n\n“If I were giving a young man advice as to how he might succeed in life, I would say to him, pick out a good father and mother, and begin life in Ohio.” – Wilbur Wright, 1910\n\nHow did they do it? Neither Orville Wright nor Wilbur Wright had graduated from high school. And yet by working for years in their Dayton-based shop with printing presses, bicycles, motors, and other machinery, the two brothers gained the mechanical skills to solve a problem that had defied better-known experimenters for centuries.\n\n“It wasn’t luck that made them fly; it was hard work and common sense; they put their whole heart and soul and all their energy into an idea and they had the faith,\" wrote the late David McCullough, author of the book The Wright Brothers.\n\nA quote from Wilbur seems to confirm as much: \"We could hardly wait to get up in the morning.\"\n\nAll that time and effort would eventually pay off as they would invent, build and fly the world's first power-driven, heavier-than-air machine capable of free, controlled, and sustained flight. All successful airplanes since then have incorporated the basic design elements from their original work.\n\nAnd while the Wrights made their first controlled, sustained flight on December 17, 1903, in North Carolina, at what is now known as Kill Devil Hills, they perfected their invention between 1904 and 1905 at an 85-acre cow pasture eight miles northeast of Dayton called Huffman Prairie.\n\nOn September 20, 1904, at Huffman Prairie, Ohio beekeeping businessman Amos Root, a technology enthusiast, watched Wilbur Wright fly the first complete circle in an airplane. He wrote about it for his Gleanings periodical on Jan. 1, 1905, having delayed publishing the story until the following January at the request of the Wrights. Root offered his reports to Scientific American magazine, but received no reply.\n\nRoot recognized that the Wrights' invention would bring profound changes:\n\n\" ... these brothers have probably not even a faint glimpse of what their discovery is going to bring to the children of men. No one living can give a guess of what is coming along this line, much better than any one living could conjecture the final outcome of Columbus’ experiment ...\"\n\nIn later years, Dayton newspapers would celebrate the hometown Wright brothers as national heroes. But the local reporters somehow missed one of the most important stories in history as it was happening a few miles away.\n\nJames M. Cox, then publisher of The Dayton Daily News, expressed the attitude of many in those days when he admitted years later: \"Frankly, none of us believed it.\"\n\nThe Wrights made about 150 flights at the pasture, leading to the development of the 1905 Wright Flyer III, which they considered to be the first practical airplane. That aircraft has been restored and is now displayed at the Carillon Historical Park in Dayton.\n\nEstablishing the Wright Company in November 1909, the first company established for manufacturing airplanes, the brothers returned to Huffman Prairie Flying Field the following year, using it as a testing ground, flying school, and home to their exhibition team.\n\nWilbur Wright's tenure as company president was cut short when he contracted typhoid fever. He died on May 30, 1912. Orville became president of the company, but apparently had little taste for executive life. He sold the company on Oct. 16, 1915. Orville made his last flight as a pilot in 1918.\n\nToday, Huffman Field is located on Wright-Patterson Air Force Base.\n\nThe First Airplane Factory in the World\n\nWhile the Wright Brothers were incredibly talented as inventors and builders, they may not have been the most astute businessmen.\n\nThe company produced about 120 airplanes in 13 different models between 1910 and 1915. Orville sold his interest in the company on Oct. 15, 1915, following Wilbur’s death in 1912, and essentially retired from aviation. In 1916, the Wright Company merged with the Glenn L. Martin Company to form the Wright-Martin Company.\n\nIt become the Dayton-Wright Company the following year and then General Motors bought the plant in September 1919. The factory expanded over the years as thousands of GM workers turned out auto parts, first as Inland, later as Delco, and finally as Delphi. Delphi closed in 2008.\n\nI took the photo above of the historical plant in West Dayton, the oldest airplane factory in the world. The buildings now sit behind a chain-linked fence, closed to the public. The 54-acre site is currently being planned by the National Park Service and is being managed by the City of Dayton. The National Aviation Heritage Alliance has been awarded more than $1.4 million in state capital grants to eventually conduct cultural activities there.\n\nThe Rise of Wright-Patterson AFB, Ohio's Largest Employer\n\nWere it not for their experimental flights in developing what would become the first practical airplane at Huffman Field, Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio's largest employer, would probably not exist today.\n\nAircraft operations on land now part of the base began in 1904–1905 when Wilbur and Orville Wright used an 84-acre plot of Huffman Prairie for experimental test flights with the Wright Flyer III. Their flight exhibition company and the Wright Company School of Aviation returned to use the flying field to train America’s earliest military pilots from 1910 to 1916.\n\nIn 1917, Edward A. Deeds, a founder of the Dayton-Wright Company, assisted the Army in acquiring what would become three military installations in his hometown: McCook Field, Wilbur Wright Field, and the Fairfield Aviation General Supply Depot.\n\nMcCook was used as a testing field and for aviation experiments. Wright was used as a flying field (renamed Patterson Field in 1931); Fairfield Aviation General Supply Depot; armorers' school, and a temporary storage depot. McCook's functions were transferred to Wright Field when it was closed in October 1927, and Wright-Patterson Air Force Base was established in 1948 as a merger of Patterson and Wright Fields.\n\nToday, Wright-Patterson Air Force Base is Ohio’s largest single-site employer, generating 32,000 direct jobs and another 50,000 indirect jobs. Its annual economic impact on the surrounding region is estimated at $16 billion.\n\nThe base covers more than 8,000 acres of land and provides operational support for more than 100 associate units located at Wright-Patterson. There are two runways, supporting an average of 47,000 aircraft operations every year.\n\nThe base uniquely houses 11 “center of gravity” mission sets, including the National Air and Space Intelligence Center, the newly formed National Space Intelligence Center, and the Air Force Research Lab. It is the latter that serves as a primary scientific research and development center in developing warfighting technologies for our air, space, and cyberspace force. It demonstrates that innovation and discovery is still very much alive and well in the Dayton region.\n\nRebirth of an Entrepreneurial Hub Downtown\n\nSome six years ago when I first toured the downtown property, the Dayton Arcade had been mothballed for decades and was the largely haunt of pigeons. But I was immediately impressed by the historic, architecturally elegant complex.\n\nBuilt between 1902 and 1904, the Dayton Arcade consists of nine interconnecting buildings topped by a glass-domed rotunda, 70 feet high and 90 feet in diameter, below which two balconied upper floors circle a central enclave.\n\nYes, I told my friend Erik Collins, director of Montgomery County Community & Economic Development, this could be something very special. And today, after years of neglect and false starts, it truly is.\n\nThrough the first four decades of the 20th century, the main spaces were used for a major food market, with retail stores, offices, and apartments on the upper floors. It was one of Dayton's prime destinations -- \"The City Within a City\" -- offering a supermarket of sorts offering fruit and vegetables, seafood, baked goods, food specialties, meats and meat specialties, fresh-cut flowers, and assorted luxury items.\n\nBut after years of decline, the Arcade was closed to the public in 1990, its fate unknown. Numbers were crunched on the cost of demolition. Then a curious thing happened, a not-for-profit group, \"Friends of the Dayton Arcade\" published a book in 2008 entitled, \"The Dayton Arcade; Crown Jewel of the Gem City.\" It set wheels in motion.\n\nAfter lackluster investment spanning decades, the Dayton Arcade officially reopened to the public with a two-day Arcade Festival on Aug. 6 and 7th, 2021, held in conjunction with Dayton’s Art in the City.\n\nUnlike past efforts, however, this development project has no feel of a false start and is far more than just a collection of beautifully renovated buildings.\n\nBehind the rebirth is the University of Dayton, which recognized that it could play an important role in the entrepreneurial environment of downtown Dayton. The result: a collaborative center of big thinkers, dreamers, and doers\n\nSoon after being installed as UD's 19th president, Eric F. Spina toured the mothballed and deteriorated Arcade.\n\n\"I found myself looking beyond the crumbling, neglected structure to envision its huge potential. Gazing up in awe at the soaring glass-domed rotunda, I felt goose bumps,\" Spina wrote in a UD blog on March 1, 2021.\n\n\"Closing my eyes, I could picture this historic gem coming alive, strengthening the connection between the University and downtown Dayton, and teeming once again with vitality and great purpose.\n\nWithout a moment’s hesitation, I immediately knew UD needed to be a partner in the ambitious and complex endeavor to restore the storied Arcade and turn it into a grand stage for reclaiming Dayton’s legacy as a city of bold innovators and inventors. We believed that this could be a powerful site for student learning and entrepreneurial opportunity for all of UD.\"\n\nThe university subsequently signed a joint venture agreement with the Entrepreneurs’ Center, entering into a 10-year lease to become the anchor tenants. The space -- 95,000 square feet devoted to creativity and collaboration -- is called “The Arcade Innovation Hub Powered by PNC Bank.” It is said to be the largest university-anchored innovation hub in the country.\n\nThe Hub is the home of the UD Crotty Center, which offers a distinctive approach to entrepreneurship education with experiences such as starting their own micro-businesses and regular contact with successful entrepreneurs. It's here where UD students attend classes in the College of Arts and Sciences, entrepreneurship courses, and The GEM, a social innovation incubator for the Institute of Applied Creativity.\n\nThe Hub also houses studios for painting, printmaking, photo and graphic design for students; a satellite office for the Greater West Dayton Incubator; a student-managed café featuring locally sourced menu items from underrepresented entrepreneurs; a “shark tank” venue for business plan competitions; and plenty of co-working space for start-ups.\n\nKnowing that entrepreneurs drive innovation, diversify the local economy, and fuel prosperity, The Entrepreneurs' Center brings together resources for start-ups and scale-ups. Experienced advisors, entrepreneurs-in-residence, and full-time staff are there to provide operational guidance with business planning, mentoring, networking, and more.\n\nOf EC's 1,100 small business clients about 850 are based in the Dayton region, with about 300 nationally. Virtually all are less than five years old and about 80 percent have five employees or less, said EC President Scott Koorndyk, who has led the organization since 2015.\n\nMany times, the EC works with individuals at the earliest stages when they are contemplating starting a business.\n\n\"We have boot camps that we run when you've got a bright idea, but you haven't formed your company yet. You want to test the theory a little bit, you want to do some customer discovery,\" Koorndyk told me.\n\n\"You want to understand the kind of structure your business ought to be. You want to build a business plan. We have a boot camp program that we put clients through there.\"\n\nDayton defense firm Infinity Labs, LLC, named the winner of the “2020 Entrepreneurial Startup” award by the Dayton Development Coalition, has moved its operations into the circa 1883 Kuhns Building, the oldest structure in the Arcade complex.\n\nTable 33, a prominent local restaurant, recently signed a lease at the Dayton Arcade. Four of the Arcade’s nine interconnected buildings offer apartments and developers are working to bring a 91-room hotel there as well.\n\nThe Miami Valley Was the Silicon Valley of Its Day\n\n“Be it known that we, ORVILLE WRIGHT and WILBUR WRIGHT, citizens of the United States, residing in the city of Dayton, county of Montgomery, and State of Ohio, have invented certain new and useful Improvements in Flying-Machines … .”\n\nThat’s how United States Patent No. 821,393, filed on March 23, 1903, began. At the time, Dayton claimed more patents per capita than any other city in the nation.\n\nConventional wisdom concerning innovation is one of math -- that with more people, comes more innovation. Hence, bigger cities with greater populations will be where the most innovation takes place.\n\nBut Dayton, a midsize city, breaks the mold. Historically, inventors have thrived here and that tradition continues today, as the region serves as a proving ground for cutting-edge aerospace and defense technology. Again, all this goes back to two brothers who owned and operated a local bicycle shop and became obsessed with following a dream. Dayton, it seems, has always built real businesses from real technology,\n\nAnd it wasn't just the Wrights. They were a multitude of other inventors in Dayton who have left their mark. Here are a few stories exemplifying that storied legacy of innovation.\n\nWhile on a ship bound for Europe in 1878, Dayton saloonkeeper James Ritty saw a machine that counted the number of times that the ship's propeller completed a revolution. It convinced him that he could invent a machine that could keep track of his sales. Upon returning to Dayton, he patented his \"Ritty's Incorruptible Cashier\" on November 4, 1879.\n\nRitty established a company to manufacture cash registers in Dayton. Unfortunately, Ritty's invention did not draw much enthusiasm from other business owners, and Ritty's new company quickly closed. Ritty eventually sold his patent to a group of Ohio investors.\n\nAmong them was John H. Patterson, who eventually turned Ritty's invention into a fortune. In 1884, Patterson founded the National Cash Register Company, the forerunner to today's NCR Corp.\n\nPatterson developed the nation’s first sales training schools and was a pioneer of employee wellness initiatives such as factories with windows, cafeterias, and on-site recreational parks. Still, he had a rather cruel way of letting employees know they had been fired. He would have their desks taken outside and burned.\n\nAt its height, the company, which residents called \"the Cash,\" employed 20,000 people. Today, NCR remains a sore spot for Dayton. The company, now principally a software company, moved its corporate headquarters from Dayton to Georgia in 2009 to Georgia, thereby eliminating 1,200 jobs in Dayton. (Dayton has had other troubling losses of company stalwarts, including that of Mead Corporation and Lexis-Nexus, once a part of Mead.)\n\nAnother noteworthy invention took place at Deeds Barn in Dayton in 1909. It was there where two Ohio farm boys, Edward Deeds, and Charles Kettering, solved one of the biggest problems facing the nascent auto industry: How to start a car without having to turn an extremely heavy crank by hand at the front of the car. Back then, using the hand crank was dangerous work. It was not uncommon for the engine to kick back tremendously, breaking a thumb or a wrist.\n\nKettering is credited for inventing the electric ignition system -- what he called an \"engine starting device\" -- and partnering with Deeds, an NCR executive, in founding the Dayton Engineering Laboratories Company (Delco) in 1909. Cadillac began installing Kettering's electronic ignition systems on production models in 1912. Deeds barn now stands at the Kettering-Moraine Museum.\n\nIn 1928, Thomas Midgley Jr. and Kettering invented a “miracle compound” called Freon. Frigidaire, then a General Motors subsidiary based in Dayton, received the first patent for the formula for CFCs on Dec. 31, 1928. Because Freon is non-toxic, it eliminated the danger posed by refrigerator leaks. Kettering's home may be the first home to have air conditioning.\n\nThe story goes -- and if it's not true it should be -- that while at a picnic with friends and family in 1959, a thirsty Ermal Fraze discovered he had left his \"church key\" can opener at home, forcing him to use a car bumper to open cans of beer. Fraze, founder of the Dayton Reliable Tool & Mfg. Co., decided there had to be a better way, leading to his creation of the pull-tab opener.\n\nFraze received U.S. patent for his invention in 1963 and subsequently sold it to Alcoa. By 1965, around 75 percent of U.S. breweries were using them, but in the mid-1970s, pressure from environmentalists due to litter led to the development of the non-removable tabs used today.\n\nA master carpenter by trade, John H. Balsey received a patent in 1862 for a safety stepladder. Although stepladders had been in use before 1862, his primary contribution to safety was the replacement of round rungs with flat steps.\n\nFrom 1921 to 1926, Frigidaire appliances were produced by Delco-Light, a General Motors subsidiary in Dayton. Arthur J. Frei, who while working at Frigidaire, developed 23 patents, among them, inventing the ice cube tray with a quick-release lever.\n\nWith borrowed money, James Floyd Smith built and then taught himself to fly his own airplane. In May 1920, he won a patent for the first backpack, free fall type, ripcord operated parachute. His original ripcord parachute is on display at the National Museum of the United States Air Force in Dayton.\n\nA self–educated high school dropout, John L. Janning epitomizes creativity and learning through experience. A member of the Engineers Club of Dayton, Janning is enshrined in the Engineering and Science Hall of Fame for perfecting the liquid crystal display (LCD) and inventing the thermal printing wafer.\n\nWhile heading a teach of IBM researchers in North Carolina, Paul McEnroe, a 1959 electrical engineering graduate of the University of Dayton, is credited for creating a vertical-bar coding system, commonly known as the bar code, an industry standard by the late 1970′s and still used throughout the world today.\n\nThe Cheez-It was first introduced by the Dayton-based Green & Green Company in 1921, but its origin goes to 1847 when Dr. William Wolf of Dayton determined his patients with dietary restrictions needed a different kind of food. To fill the need, Dr. Wolf created his own food, a hard butter cracker that became known as the Dayton Cracker. Dr. Wolf’s cracker became so popular it kicked off the growth of the cracker-baking industry in the city.\n\nA from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1913, Dayton native Levitt Luzern Custer’s first invention was the Custer Bubble Statoscope, which registered the rise and fall of aircraft. By 1916, his Statoscope had proven so popular that Luzern had a four-story brick building constructed housing his Custer Specialty Company.\n\nThousands of American veterans returning home from World War I came back as amputees. That prompted Custer's 1919 patent for the Custer Invalid Chair, a three-wheel, electric motorized wheelchair with a range of 10 to 15 miles before recharging. He later developed a gasoline version which sold for $175.\n\nA rather confusing note on geography: In the headline, I referred to the Miami Valley in Southwest Ohio as being the Silicon Valley of its day. For my purposes, I am referring to the Dayton Metropolitan Statistical Area consisting of Greene, Miami and Montgomery counties.\n\nGeographers, however, might consider additional counties to be in the Miami Valley, those of Greene, Pebble, Clark, Darke, Champaign, Shelby, Logan, Butler, Warren, Wayne, Mercer, and Auglaize.\n\nHow One Industrial Site Changed Over the Years\n\nFrom 1917 and continuing today, different things have been built by different owners on this one site in Moraine, a suburb community of Dayton. First, it was airplanes, then refrigerators, then small pickup trucks and SUVs, and today glass windshields.\n\nDuring its early years of operation, from 1917 to 1923, Dayton-Wright produced more than 4000 aircraft, including the DeHavilland observer/bomber plane (a First World War British design).\n\nDayton Wright was sold to General Motors in 1919 and GM exited the aircraft business in 1923. In 1926, GM enlarged and upgraded the plant and used it to build its Frigidaire refrigerators. GM continued to manufacture appliances on the site until 1979 when it sold Frigidaire.\n\nThe decision was then made to retool the plant to produce vehicles. The plant reopened in 1981 and began turning out Chevrolet S-10 pickup trucks. A paint shop was added in the 1990s along with a nearby engine plant that is still operating today.\n\nThe large assembly plant continued to turn out varying models until it was closed Dec. 23, 2008. About GM 2,400 workers found themselves without jobs.\n\nThings stayed quiet until the summer of 2013 when word started leaking out that a big manufacturer was on the prowl and was looking at Dayton. In the fall of 2013, Cao Dewang, chairman of Fuyao Glass Industry Group, a Chinese maker of automotive glass, met with U.S. Rep. Steve Chabot, R-Cincinnati. Not long after, the city of Moraine applied to Montgomery County for development dollars, in a bid to bring a big company to the former GM plant.\n\nAt that point, it was all very hush-hush. That all changed in January 2014 when Gov. John Kasich and Fuyao chairman Cao announced at the Ohio Statehouse that Fuyao would initially hire at least 800 workers to begin glass-making operations in part of the former GM plant.\n\nIt was one of the biggest Chinese manufacturing investments east of the Mississippi River, and at the time the biggest investment project ever in the state. (It has since been dwarfed by others.)\n\nIn May 2015, Cao paid $15 million for 1.4 million square feet of the 4.4-million-square-foot shuttered complex. By October of that year, Fuyao had already begun producing automotive glass. Today, the company employs about 2,000 workers at its portion of the site.\n\nFast forward to earlier this month, Fuyao announced that it would construct an additional 600,000-square-foot facility as part of an expansion and would thereby create 500 new jobs. The combined project investment when accounting for site improvements, infrastructure, machinery, and equipment is about $300 million, according to the documents obtained by the Dayton Daily News.\n\nAgain, Fuyao did not buy the entire footprint of the former GM Moraine Assembly. The last unoccupied building, originally constructed as the aforementioned paint shop, is currently undergoing rehabilitation and is expected to be available for potential users early next year according to Industrial Commercial Properties, which purchased the complex in 2010 with its partner Industrial Realty Group.\n\nOhio's Achilles' Heel (It's Not Just My Opinion)\n\nOhio has talent. It has a legacy of manufacturing and innovation. The Buckeye State is geographically well-positioned and it has a substantially robust transportation infrastructure in place. The Columbus region in particular is rip-roaring right now with growth.\n\nWhat it does not have, however, -- and this is not only coming from me -- is a particular business-friendly tax environment. The nonpartisan Tax Foundation's 2023 State Business Tax Climate Index ranks Ohio at 37th, below each of its five neighboring states.\n\nOhio's Commercial Activity Tax (CAT) is one of only a few gross receipts taxes still levied in the country. These taxes are uniquely uncompetitive, discourage investment in the state, and drive inefficient business decisions divorced from economic merit.\n\nThe problem, according to the Tax Foundation, is that gross receipts taxes are completely divorced from whether a business has the ability to pay. As such, they can be extra burdensome, particularly for startups that often experience losses in their first years of operation. Bottom line: Ohio's current tax system does little to reward risk-taking, that which is essential to growing a local economy. Rather, it does just the opposite.\n\n\"The cat is out of the bag on gross receipts taxes: they harm states’ competitiveness and result in non-neutral tax treatment,\" wrote Ulrik Boesen for the Tax Foundation in November 2021.\n\n\"Ohio would improve its competitiveness through repeal of the CAT. Despite offering some revenue stability, gross receipts taxes do more harm than good to the economy. Currently, Ohio has some financial capacity to revisit the CAT, and phasing it out would encourage increased investment and economic growth in the Buckeye State.\n\nIn its \"Blueprint for Ohio's Economic Future,\" the Ohio Chamber of Commerce called for comprehensive tax reform. It seeks a review of state and local tax liabilities for businesses and a uniformity of tax rates and filing requirements.\n\n“With over 800 local taxing jurisdictions, Ohio’s businesses struggle to navigate a complex and burdensome municipal tax code. Differing definitions of income, variable rates, and onerous filing systems reduce productivity and increase costs. Policymakers should support efforts to standardize filing requirements and rates, while improving processes to reduce compliance burdens,” the chamber policy document reads.\n\nAlthough most U.S. cities and counties do not impose a local income tax, they are imposed by 4,964 jurisdictions in 17 states, and Ohio is one of them. It has 649 municipalities and 199 school districts that tax the income of people who live or work in a specific area.\n\nThe local income tax is in addition to federal income and state income taxes. It means a person is getting hit up separately three times for making an income. To that I say, \"Ouch.\"\n\nDo you know someone who would like this newsletter? Feel free to share it with them.
