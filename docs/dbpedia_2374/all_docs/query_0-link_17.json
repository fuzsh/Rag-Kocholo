The first modern carillon in this country was installed in 1922 at the Church of Our Lady of Good Voyage in Gloucester, Massachusetts. The first in New York State was donated by John D. Rockefeller, Jr. to the Park Avenue Baptist Church in New York City in 1925. This church moved to Riverside Drive in 1931 with the relocated carillon having been expanded to 72 bells, the largest in the world at the time. The second instrument was installed at the Albany city hall in 1927 and the third at St. Thomas Episcopal Church in New York City in 1929. These were widely publicized and concerts were often broadcast over radio.\n\nThe new library building on the River Campus for Men was seen as an ideal location for a carillon, which had become popular in the United States in the late 1920s. Costs proved prohibitive even for a downsized chime of less than 23 bells and a single bell might have ended up being installed in the library tower when the three children of contractor Arendt W. Hopemana native of the Netherlandsdonated a chime of 17 bells that was installed in the lantern above new Rush Rhees Library dome in 1930. The Hopemans also paid to expand the lantern tower above the library dome to house the bells.\n\nThe Hopeman Memorial Chimes were presented to the University of Rochester in 1930 by Albert A. Hopeman, Bertram C. Hopeman, and J. Margaret Hopeman in memory of their father, the late Arendt Willem Hopeman. The seventeen bells were installed in the lantern on top of the Rush Rhees Library tower by Meneely and Company of Watervliet, New York, with Harold Gleason of the Eastman School acting as music consultant.\n\nThe ringing of the chimes was an unpaid service provided by various members of the University community. In 1930, the year the River Campus opened for students, English professor John R. Slater was placed in charge of the chimes, which he rang regularly for the next twelve years. By the time he retired in 1942, Slater had composed several hundred pieces especially for the Hopeman Memorial Chimes.\n\nRobert F. Metzdorf became assistant bellman in 1937 and was promoted to chief bellman in 1942. He was succeeded in 1949 by Arthur Frackenpohl. G. Marshall Abbey succeeded him circa 1953. In May 1954 the Bellman's Society was organized to involve students in the ringing of the chimes. It consisted of a limited number of undergraduates selected through competition, with two senior bellman in charge. The Bellman's Society evolved into the Carillon Society, which has been very active in recent years..\n\nTwo additional bells, a middle F sharp and upper G, were made by the Dutch company Petit and Fritsen, Ltd. and added in 1956. All necessary expenses, along with a $10,000 maintenance endowment, were borne by the Hopeman Family in addition to their original gift. By 1973, however, an extensive study of the proper care of the chimes determined that some were beyond repair or tuning. Repair costs were high enough to consider a replacement of the entire installation. Through Schulmerich Carillons, Inc. the University was put in touch with the Royal Eijsbouts Bellfoundry Ltd. of Asten, Holland, who conducted a thorough evaluation of the bells. It was their strong recommendation that a full carillon be installed to allow for a greater range of music. The original bells were removed, and six of the decommissioned bells were transferred to Christ Church at 141 Rochester's East Avenue, where they sound daily on the hour.\n\nThe Hopeman Memorial Carillon was formally dedicated on December 9, 1973 with a concert by Arie Abbenes, city carillonneur for Eindhoven, Asten and Tilburg in Holland Its fifty bells cover four octaves and weigh a total of 6,668 pounds. David Caldwell began playing the Hopeman Chime as a freshman in 1971 and learned to play the carillon from Abbenes, who also taught some of the bellmen the rudiments of carillon playing. Caldwell was the University Carillonneur from 1978 through 1989.\n\nThe traditional \"Westminster Quarters\" (or \"Big Ben\" chime) was replaced during the University's sesquicentennial celebration in 2000 by the \"Rochester Quarters,\" composed by former Department of Music professor Daniel Harrison. The \"Westminster Quarters\" returned in 2004. The carillon was restored in 2017 and today, the Hopeman Memorial Carillon is one of seven carillons in New York State, of which only five are currently playable.\n\nContributed by Doris Aman, Director of Carillon Activities, Arthur Satz Department of Music, July 2022\n\nI am attaching several documents sent to me by Tim Verdin of Verdin Company https://www.verdin.com/ regarding the Hopeman Chime. These were part of the Meneely Company records entrusted to his father who recently passed away. You may find these supportive of your project as additional source documentation. The original Hopeman Chime bell array had the exact bell notes necessary to play the Star Spangled Banner. This was a marketing scheme for the Meneely Company. The original electric keyboard for the chime is stored in Rarebooks archives.\n\nThe advisor called in to inspect the bells in the 1960-early 1970's was James Lawson, then carillonneur at Riverside Carillon at New York City, friend of President Sproul. It was Lawson who suggested making a switch to the Eijsbouts carillon installation rather than repair the Meneely chime. Schulmerich and Eijsbouts become noticed due to the New York City World's Fair carillon installations. The blueprints you uploaded are from Schulmerich. More on Shulmerich and Eijsbouts at the Fair: http://nywf64.com/schulmerich02.shtml\n\nIt is pertinent to both Hopeman Chime and Hopeman Carillon that the Hopeman family were Dutch immigrants, shipbuilders by trade. They engineered the massive girder structures interior to the famous RRL library dome necessary to support the tonnage of bells additional to the stacked weight of books in Rush Rhees Library.\n\nMany of the buildings on campus and along downtown Rochester are still graced by the intricate custom carpentry carvings of Hopeman Contractor workmen.\n\nThe bells bringing Dutch culture and music to the campus are within hearing distance to ring over family members buried in Mt. Hope Cemetery as a living memorial.\n\nReferences\n\n1920 \"Carillon Planned As War Memorial,\" Democrat and Chronicle, May 21, 1920, Page 31.\n\nBell Music of Flanders May Be Introduced in Washington.\n\n1921 \"National Peace Carillon,\" Democrat and Chronicle, September 10, 1921, Page 10.\n\n1927 \"First U.S. Carillon Resounds in Albany,\" Democrat and Chronicle, September 19, 1927, Page 1.\n\nAlbany tonight dedicated the first municipal carillon in the country when Jef Denyen, Belgian carillonnieur, struck the opening notes on the sixty bell group in the tower of city hall.\n\n1927 Rochester, the making of a university, by Jesse Leonard Rosenberger, with an introduction by President Rush Rhees.

It is one of only six carillons in New York State. Weighing almost three-and-a-half tons, it consists of 50 stationary cast-bronze bells that are sounded by clappers. Each clapper is connected by a half mile of thin metal rod to one of 48 wooden keys or 26 pedals. The carillonneur sits on a bench and plays by depressing the keys with loosely clenched hands. The pedals, connected to the heavier bass bells, are depressed with the feet. As with a piano, expressive playing is achieved by varying the touch. In addition to its frequent use as a performance instrument, the Hopeman Carillon has been an educational resource: Students of acoustics and physics of music have studied its reverberations, Eastman faculty and student composers have written for it, and students and alumni study carillon technique on it. The present carillonneur, Lauren Marino, began playing the carillon at Cornell University in 1999, while working toward her undergraduate degree in applied economics and management. She is currently studying carillon performance at Alfred University.\n\n2006 \"The Carilloneur,\" Commencement program, May 2006, Page 27.\n\nThe carilloneur for today, Doris Aman, played her first bells when, as a precocious child, she climbed alone up a bell tower. Instead of punishment, she was invited to ring a bell. She has been privileged to play at Alfred University, Valley Forge, and the Netherlands Carillon at Arlington, Va., near the Iwo Jima Memorial.\n\n2006 \"Carillon, oh carillon,\" Campus Times, October 12, 2006, Pages 9 & 12.\n\nStudents have not been afforded regular presentations on the carillon in decades, since the disappearance of a student-run carillon guild in the 1970s.\n\n2006 \"A Passion for the Bells,\" @Rochester, December 8, 2006\n\nEvery Wednesday from noon to 1 p.m. music rings out of the Rush Rhees Tower, and most folks trekking across the quad or heading outside for a lunchtime break have no idea that Tiffany Ng is the person behind the performance.

But costs were highimport charges, for example, increased the cost of bells bought in Europe by 40 percentand Rochesters ambitions were scaled back, and back again. Plans for a carillonwhich must have 23 or more bellsbecame plans for a chime, which has fewer than 23 bells. At one point cost-conscious supporters discussed the possibility of buying just one bell.\n\nTo the rescue came the Hopeman family. A native of the Netherlands, where bells have long been popular, Arendt Hopeman arrived in the United States in 1868. One year later, he founded the construction companylater incorporated as A. W. Hopeman and Sons, General Contractorsthat oversaw construction of the River Campus, the Eastman Theatre, and the Eastman School. He died in 1928, and to honor his memory and his Dutch heritage, his childrenMargaret Hopeman, Class of 1903, who earned a masters degree in 1906, Albert, and Bertram Corneliusmade a gift of a 17-bell chime forged by Meneely & Co. In the bell business since 1826, Meneelys foundry branch of Watervliet, N.Y., had already created bells for locations such as Valley Forge, Pa., and Cornell University.\n\nThe bell lantern atop the dome of Rush Rhees library was added specifically to house the chime. The bells were so immense that they required additional heavy steel girders for the dome, a cost that the Hopeman family bore. The original bells installed in the library weighed more than 17 tons. Two more bells came in 1956, adding six more tons to the weight and giving players a greater range of tones. The largest of the bellsthe second largest ever cast at the Meneely foundryweighed 7,500 pounds. It was said to be one of the deepest-toned bells made outside Europe at the time.\n\n2012 Rochester Carillon, by Steve Boerner Topography and Design\n\nCutaways and detailed models explain the workings of the Hopeman Memorial Carillon.
