        "text": "Join us for a uniquely-San Diego experience! The California Tower is one of our city's most iconic historic landmarks. Make the climb on a guided tour that highlights the origins of Balboa Park and the histories of some of the many diverse communities that call the region home. All tours culminate in breathtaking 360-degree views of San Diego from the Tower’s eighth-floor viewing deck—from the Pacific Ocean in the west to the Cuyamaca Mountains in the east, and beyond.\n\nAbout the Tour\n\nCalifornia Tower tours are only available with purchase of admission or with Museum membership. Tours are booked by reservation and all guests must have a tour ticket.\n\nTour Schedule\n\nMonday-Thursday: 10:30 a.m., 12:30 p.m., 2:30 p.m. and 4:30 p.m.\n\nFriday-Sunday: Hourly from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m.\n\nCalifornia Tower tours are offered four times a day on Monday-Thursday, and hourly on Friday, Saturday, and Sunday. Tours last 40 minutes, which include 10-15 minutes on the viewing deck.\n\nbook your tour\n\nTour Guidelines\n\nLearn more and prepare for your California Tower tour.\n\nCalifornia Tower tours accommodate up to six (6) people.\n\nGuests may buy tickets at the Museum lobby or purchase their tickets in advance online. Tours are limited and may sell out.\n\nCalifornia Tower tour tickets are non-refundable.\n\nGuests must be at least six years old to participate. All guests must be able to make the climb up the Tower unassisted.\n\nGuests must arrive at the Museum at least 10 minutes before their tour starts. Tours will not wait for late guests and late guests will not be allowed to join a tour that has already begun. Tickets will not be refunded or exchanged for guests who are late for their tour.\n\nArrive at Balboa Park early to allow plenty of time for parking and getting to the Museum. Find more information about parking and directions here.\n\nGuests will need to sign waivers for themselves and any minors accompanying them.\n\nThe tour goes to the first viewing deck of the Tower. It does not include the second and third viewing decks, which are the top two levels of the Tower.\n\nIt is recommended that guests wear flat-soled shoes that cover the whole foot.\n\nBring your point-and-shoot or smartphone cameras! There are lots of great pictures to take.\n\nWe offer free lockers where guests can store personal items while on a California Tower tour. No bags of any kind (no matter how small or large or fanny-packed) are permitted on the tour. Flying devices, large video cameras, or large photography gear are also not allowed, and other items may be forbidden at the discretion of Museum staff. If in doubt, please ask! We recommend you leave big or valuable items at home. The Museum is not responsible for items placed in lockers.\n\nGuests are not permitted to climb the California Tower tour on their own. Guests must stay with their group and be accompanied by a tour guide at all times. Any guests who do not stay with the group will immediately be escorted out of the California Tower.\n\nThe Views\n\nHave your camera ready for these epic views.\n\nTo the North, the criss-crossing green cars of the San Diego Zoo’s Skyfari catch your eye as they glide over the canyon landscape just beyond the Old Globe Theater. You can see a bird aviary and sometimes hear animal calls. Beyond that, there’s the North Park water tower and the Cuyamaca Mountains in the distant northeast.\n\nTo the West is the Cabrillo Bridge, Banker’s Hill, downtown San Diego, the massive spur of Point Loma, and the glimmering San Diego Bay and Pacific Ocean, dimpled by the movements of sailboats and military vessels going about their business. To the northwest — just a few feet away — you see the brightly-tiled California Dome, the sister landmark to the California Tower. Look to the northwest over the dome and you may see Mount Soledad and the taller buildings of Hillcrest.\n\nTo the East, you see the ever-evolving heart of Balboa Park with beautiful buildings, the Plaza de Panama, and the sports fields and trails. All this is set in front of the backdrop of the Laguna Mountains and the antenna-covered peak of San Miguel Mountain. You may even see helicopters land at the Naval Medical Center.\n\nTo the South, you see the curving arc of the Coronado Bridge, busy shipbuilding yards, glittering downtown skyscrapers, the Coronado Peninsula, Mexico’s misty Coronado Islands, the flat top of Tijuana’s Otay Mesa, and beyond that, more of Baja California and Mexico. Airplanes fly past as they descend toward the airport, and red-tailed hawks often soar over the park’s canyons.\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\n\nFor more information, please see our Tour Guidelines above.\n\nSupporters\n\nThank you to our Tower Tour community contributors and supporters.\n\nTower Tour Community Contributors:\n\nLaurie Egan-Hedley\n\nDirector, Barona Cultural Center & Museum\n\nHeather Ponchetti Daly, PhD.\n\nKumeyaay–Iipay Nation of Santa Ysabel\n\nUniversity of California, San Diego\n\nAlberto Pulido, PhD.\n\nUniversity of San Diego\n\nDirector of the Turning Wheel Project\n\nChicano Park Steering Committee Member\n\nChuck Ambers and Associates\n\nMoro African-Latin Museum\n\nNatalie Zhang\n\nActing Curator and Collections Manager, San Diego Chinese Historical Museum"
