        "text": "Whether through RSOs, outreach programs, internships, or their own relationship-building efforts, UChicago students have always had a role on the Chicago and South Side communities and have always been a key part of the University’s efforts to be an engaged campus. Join the Office of Civic Engagement to hear from a panel of current student leaders on how they think about that work at this moment of the University’s history, and learn how offices such as the University Community Service Center and the Neighborhood Schools Program are supporting them to build positive and mutually beneficial relationships with our neighbors. Attendees will also have the opportunity to hear from Christian Mitchell, AB’08, vice president of civic engagement at the University of Chicago.\n\nJoin International House as we celebrate the end of the academic year and bring to a close a period of sharing experiences and knowledge with friends from many parts of the world. I-House alumni, staff, and current graduate student fellows are invited to close the 2023–24 academic year with a special dinner reception and our annual candle-lighting ceremony. Typically held in conjunction with Sunday Supper, the ceremony brings together our entire community. This candle-lighting ceremony also recognizes our programming that promotes international friendship and cultural exchange.\n\nMatsudaira Sadanobu (1759–1829), the de facto ruler of Japan from 1787 to 1793, copied out by hand The Tale of Genji seven times and could not remember how many times he had copied out The Tales of Ise. The story of Sadanobu’s copying activities contradicts the image of the Edo period (1600–1868) as the age in which commercial printing took off in Japan. It was during the Edo period that printed books were profusely illustrated by the most famous artists of the day, that they reproduced the fine calligraphy of manuscript originals, and that they spread to all corners of Japan. But if that was the case, there are some difficult questions to answer. Why did Sadanobu undertake all that copying? Why did so many people copy out printed books? Why was so much knowledge, including the discovery of anesthesia, confined to manuscripts? Why did some of the most popular works of fiction circulate only in manuscript form? There is another side to the history of the book in Japan, one that consists of manuscripts rather than printed books. Japanese manuscript expert Peter Kornicki will focus on exposing the underworld of manuscript books dealing with secret knowledge, shocking scandals, and obscure rituals.\n\nThe US economy used to spend 2% of its GDP on R&D in the 1980s; now, that figure stands at 3.5%. The fraction of the workforce identified as \"inventors\" has more than doubled since 2000. However, rather than experiencing acceleration, the economy has faced a productivity slowdown in return. Despite proactive policies directing additional resources toward fostering faster growth, where does the economy fall short?\n\nJoin us in Saieh Hall to reconnect with Chicago Economics, enjoy a lecture by Ufuk Akcigit, the Arnold C. Harberger Professor in Economics and the College, and a discussion between Prof. Akcigit and Robert Shimer, Chair of the Kenneth C. Griffin Department of Economics and the George J. Stigler Distinguished Service Professor in Economics and the College. This lecture will argue that it's not solely about the quantity of resources allocated for industrial policy, but also about the \"who\" behind their utilization. Following the lecture, Prof. Akcigit will participate in a discussion with Robert Shimer, Chair of the Kenneth C. Griffin Department of Economics and the George J. Stigler Distinguished Service Professor in Economics and the College.\n\nAndrea Ghez is the Lauren B. Leichtman & Arthur E. Levine Chair in Astrophysics at UCLA. One of the world’s leading experts in observational astrophysics and head of UCLA’s Galactic Center Group, she is best known for her groundbreaking work on the center of our galaxy, which has led to the best evidence to date for the existence of supermassive black holes. In 2020 Ghez became the fourth woman to be awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics. She has received the Crafoord Prize in Astronomy from the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences, the Bakerian Medal from the Royal Society of London, and a MacArthur Fellowship. She is a member of the National Academy of Sciences, the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, and the American Philosophical Society.\n\nJoin University of Chicago graduate students for a unique view of the ancient cultures of West Asia and North Africa as they lead you through an exploration of objects that inspire them in their daily studies. Learn about student involvement on current ISAC projects, and delve into the passions that fuel the research of tomorrow. This tour will allow you to see the collections through the eyes of the next generation of academic leaders.\n\nJoin UChicago Art History students for a guided tour of the Smart Museum of Art exhibition-Meiji Modern: Fifty Years of New Japan (March 21-June 9, 2024). This landmark exhibition takes a fresh look at the art of Japan's Meiji era (1868-19120), four remarkable decades that propelled the country into the modern era. Comprising nearly 150 artworks—including paintings, prints, photographs, sculptural works, and some objects in various media, such as enamel, lacquer, embroidery, and textiles—the exhibition presents some of the finest examples of Meiji period artworks in American collections, both public and private. Close-looking activities and group conversation will be features of this tour. Families welcome. Refreshments provided.\n\nThis panel event with the University of Chicago Latinx Alumni Network is designed to facilitate a meaningful dialogue between esteemed alumni and current students on a range of topics: -\n\nJourney from Campus to Career: Panelists will share personal journeys from being students to successful professionals and will discuss challenges faced, milestones achieved, and lessons learned. They will offer tips for navigating the transition from academia to the professional world.\n\nLatino Identity: Panelists will discuss navigating cultural and professional identity, explore how cultural identity has influenced their professional lives, and share insights into how they’ve navigated challenges related to cultural diversity in the workplace. They will offer strategies for embracing and leveraging cultural identity in a professional setting.\n\nCommunity Engagement: Panelists will discuss community engagement and giving back.\n\nPanelists for this program include: Peter LoPresti, AB’11 Marty Madera, AM’08 and Oscar Romero, Booth Chicago Management Institute 2013\n\nA carillon tower tour, requiring about 60 minutes, involves visiting the tower’s mechanical room, seeing the bells (100 tons of bronze!) up close, viewing a demonstration of how the carillon is played, and enjoying the 360-degree view from the roof. The 271-step spiral staircase is taken at a leisurely pace and is not recommended for anyone who may be afraid of heights or claustrophobic. Anyone who does not wish to ascend the tower can remain on the lower level to watch the playing demonstration via live video and audio feed. Children are allowed as long as they can make it up the stairs and are accompanied by an adult.\n\nAfter decades of steadily declining in crime, gun violence is now up across the country, including in Chicago. Public debates about how to respond have generated a lot of heat but too little insight about constructive and feasible paths forward. Join us at the University of Chicago Crime Lab to hear a very different—and fundamentally more optimistic—perspective on the problem and what to do about it.\n\nPre-registration required.\n\nHow can higher education help shape a society—and citizens—equipped to face tomorrow’s challenges? Join three UChicago academic leaders to discuss the vital and evolving role of universities in a time of great change, unique challenges, and unprecedented potential. This candid panel conversation will feature some of the University of Chicago’s newest academic leaders: Melina Hale, PhD’98, dean of the College and the William Rainey Harper Professor in Organismal Biology and Anatomy; Nadya Mason, dean of the Pritzker School of Molecular Engineering and the Robert J. Zimmer Professor of Molecular Engineering; and Deborah L. Nelson, dean of the Division of the Humanities and the Helen B. and Frank L. Sulzberger Professor in English Language and Literature and the College.\n\nFollow in the footsteps of UChicago’s most famous fictional alumnus: Indiana Jones! Explore the ISAC galleries with a challenging scavenger hunt that opens up the ancient cultures of West Asia and North Africa while testing your knowledge of popular cinematic lore. Scour the cases for clues as you come face-to-face with the towering Lamassu and the statue of King Tut. ISAC graduate students and staff members will be on hand, in the galleries, to answer questions and help you along your journey.\n\nThe Social Justice Address will precede the Crown Family School Alumni Association’s annual alumni awards presentation. Adrian Perkins, American politician and attorney who served as the mayor of Shreveport, Louisiana, will discuss the challenges and opportunities of making change at the local level. He will share his own experiences as Mayor during the COVID pandemic and what his own journey can teach us about the difficult, rewarding work of addressing society's most pressing issues. We hope you will join us to acknowledge and celebrate the professional accomplishments and societal impact of this year’s recipients. A reception will follow the program.\n\nSpecials\n\nEnjoy the Quadrangle Club’s historic setting and delicious menu during Alumni Weekend festivities!

Children are allowed as long as they can make it up the stairs and are accompanied by an adult.\n\nVaccines are one of the great human accomplishments of the 20th century, a powerful weapon that has curtailed the spread of deadly and disabling diseases. They have led to an unprecedented improvement in both human life span and quality of life. But even best-in-class formulations can have limited efficacy, and vaccine side effects can create barriers to widespread adoption. Aaron Esser-Kahn, professor of molecular engineering, takes an engineering approach to this problem, creating better adjuvant designs that can provide safe, lasting protection. He will discuss recent progress in the field, and its implications for global health.\n\nThe Art to Live With student loan program is celebrating 66 years at the University of Chicago. The product of conversations between artist-dean of students Harold Haydon and alumnus-art collector Joseph Randall Shapiro, it is one of the first university art rental programs in the country. All are welcome to visit the Smart Museum's Study Room to reunite and acquaint themselves with the collection, featuring 10 artwork selections by UChicago Alumni and 10 contemporary student-led acquisitions selected in partnership with the Smart Museums Student Advisory Committee. Drop in to view this mini pop-up exhibition and speak with current University of Chicago students about the annual ritual of living with a fine artwork. “The best way to become acquainted with art—and to appreciate it—is to live with it.”—Joe Shapiro, on the launch of the Art to Live With program in 1958. Light refreshments provided. Register for a time slot here.\n\nVisit ISAC and explore the history of games in the ancient world.

Games will be available to play outdoors, weather permitting.\n\nIs institutional neutrality possible in 2024? For 57 years, the Kalven Report has been used as the University of Chicago’s compass navigating the University’s role regarding political and social action. In the report, the role of UChicago is defined as “the discovery, improvement and dissemination of knowledge….It is not a lobby.” Does this guidance still make sense? Is true neutrality even possible? Join leadership from the newly formed Forum for Free Inquiry and Expression for a case study workshop to examine these questions and much more.\n\nUChicago Library’s Hanna Holborn Gray Special Collections Research Center is hosting Scav Hunt at UChicago: Seeking Fun, Finding Tradition, an exhibit looking down memory lane at Scav’s origins, traditions, and the lists that have turned this annual springtime event into a beloved campus institution. On Saturday, May 18, from 1 p.m. to 2 p.m., Scavenger Hunt founder Christopher Straus, LAB’84, AB’88, MD’92, will be at the exhibit to talk about the early days of Scav and how the first team of judges went about creating lists. He will share fun stories about list items that still make him chuckle.\n\nThe exhibit is on view at the Regenstein Library in the Special Collections exhibition gallery on Thursday, May 16, and Friday, May 17, from 9 a.m. to 4:45 p.m., and on Saturday, May 18, from noon until 3 p.m. Walk-ins welcomed.\n\nA carillon tower tour, requiring about 60 minutes, involves visiting the tower’s mechanical room, seeing the bells (100 tons of bronze!) up close, viewing a demonstration of how the carillon is played, and enjoying the 360-degree view from the roof.

Children are allowed as long as they can make it up the stairs and are accompanied by an adult.\n\nJoin us for a screening of Catalyst, an independent documentary film about how Duro “Shame Love Tempo” Wicks ’85 fell in love with hip-hop and helped give it a home on the Chicago music scene of the early 1990s. The film examines why hip-hop blew up so much later in Chicago than in other cities, how a tiny 100 watt college station became Chicago’s hip-hop radio powerhouse, why it was so difficult for a young Black entrepreneur to get a party started, and how the era’s social, political, and economic conditions ultimately made Duro’s dream unsustainable, even though it was more successful than anyone ever imagined it could be. The screening will be followed by a talkback with the film’s director, Dave Steck’84.\n\nJoin us for a screening of True North. Over the course of eight years, the film follows the Minneapolis North High School Polars from being ranked worst in the city to becoming the state champions (and from a 35 to a 95 percent graduation rate) and beyond. From basketball courts to skating rinks and from classrooms to family rooms, True North is a film about overcoming odds, building bridges, and making quantum leaps of change. The screening will be followed by a Q and A with director Jane Barrash, LAB’74, executive director, Continuum Center. View a preview.\n\nSeparate ticket required. Attendees are encouraged to register in advance before May 13. A limited number of tickets may be available for purchase at the door.
