        "text": "We were blessed to have our Women’s Retreat for the 2nd year at beautiful Epworth By The Sea! We saw life change through Jesus Christ as we spent time away focused on our Lord! We relaxed, meditated on the Word, and enjoyed sweet fellowship! Trice and her team made us feel welcomed and cared for! We left blessed and refreshed having time away with our Jesus and friends! Thanks for a great weekend as we learned how to ABIDE with Christ!\n\n<Parkview Retreat Team\n\nEpworth By The Sea changed my life. I can think of several pivotal moments in my journey when my life trajectory was profoundly affected while I was at Epworth. Sometimes it was sitting in a session in Nalls Auditorium. Sometimes it was during a powerful inspirational worship service in Strickland. Other times it was having an adult volunteer pray for me in Lovely Lane Chapel, or just all by myself looking for hope in the Prayer Chapel. The first time I ever heard preaching that pricked my heart was at Epworth in the 8th grade. In the 11th grade I attended a retreat that began to plant the seeds of a call to ministry in my heart. Years later I would come to Epworth as a young pastor, and again, I got much needed encouragement and teaching so that I could stay in ministry for the long haul. I now have children of my own attending retreats and coming home bursting with their own stories. Stories of how God showed up! Stories of how Epworth was amazing!\n\n< Rev. Tom Carruth - Senior Pastor, Perry United Methodist Church\n\nAs a high school football coach, I have had the great pleasure of bringing my football teams to Epworth By the Sea for the last 22 years. It is one of my favorite places on earth. It started with Camden County, then Prince Avenue Christian, Grayson, T.L. Hanna, and now Camden again. EVERY year has been a great experience for our players and coaches. The facilities are good, the food is excellent, and everyone on the staff is so welcoming that you feel like you are at home! I know that our players and coaches have benefitted not only from our football time together but also the spiritual reflection that you can’t help but feel as you walk around the beautiful grounds and churches. It is truly good for the soul and for developing any type of team.\n\n< Jeff Herron - Head Football Coach, Camden County High School\n\nThe Georgia Head Start Association has been traveling to beautiful St. Simons Island and Epworth by the Sea for many, many years for our annual Spring event. We always look forward to this event and it is highly much anticipated. Epworth provides us with a calm, relaxing, tranquil environment and plush surroundings for our event that is also conducive to learning, networking and fostering relationships. The staff is always friendly and courteous and eager to help us make our event run smoothly and efficiently. The food is delicious, the facilities are always clean, and the grounds are well maintained. Visiting Epworth by the Sea is an excellent way to jumpstart Spring! We can't wait to come back in 2024.\n\n< Juanita Yancey - Executive Officer, Georgia Head Start Association\n\nI’ve been in youth ministry for 37 years. I first brought a youth group to Epworth in 1986. Since that summer, I have brought multiple groups each year through my church and Fellowship of Christian Athletes. I have seen hundreds of teenagers and young adults make life changing commitments to Jesus on those Holy grounds. The retreat atmosphere at Epworth is second to none. Everything you need for a successful event is right inside the gates. Worship areas for large and small, beautiful quiet time space right by the river, up to date housing, good food, fire pits, recreation areas and much more. The thing I appreciate the most is the partnership in ministry that I have with their staff. Their main goal is to make our time at Epworth the most stress free environment it can be. I have never had a bad ministry experience at Epworth. It is truly Holy Ground!\n\n< Scott Adams - Area Director, East Cobb, FCA\n\nEpworth By The Sea has provided a place of solitude and recovery for police officers from across the country who have experienced traumatic events beyond the imagination of most people. The first home of the Post Critical Incident Seminar in Georgia, the GA Office of Public Safety Support partners with Epworth in providing this field-tested peer-based support seminar to help officers put the past in the past. As one of the founders of the PCIS program for state and local officers, I have always said, “the place” where you provide the assistance to officers is critical to your success. For us, Epworth is exactly the Right Place!\n\n< Rev. Dr. J. Eric Skidmore - State Police Chaplain (SC)\n\n\"When we look back on our time at Epworth, we smile. Our minds immediately go to the incredible sunsets of red, orange, and yellow that put us at ease amidst God's creation. We fondly think about the prayer chapel and how it brought us God's peace. We know that the Holy Spirit was present at Epworth as it was felt. The staff became family to us in a short period of time. Last but not least, it was the ideal environment for our families living through Childhood Cancer to find absolute rest, true relaxation, priceless connection, and intersect with God to find hope in more than a cure. Thank you, Epworth!\" - Lighthouse Family Retreat\n\n< Chris Woodruff - CEO, Executive Director, Lighthouse Family Retreat"
