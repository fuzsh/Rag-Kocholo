Other wildflowers seen in the park include milkweed, ox eye daisies, goldenrods, asters, and wild sunflowers. As with most protected lands, it is against the law to pick any flowers inside the park, so please leave these spring flowers to be enjoyed by future guests.\n\nWhitetop Mountain—Mount Rogers National Recreation Area\n\nPhoto Credit: Trevor Frost, @tbfrost\n\nWildflowers burst into color in mid-spring along Whitetop Mountain in Mount Rogers National Recreation area, but the best time to visit is in June, when the native flame azalea is at its peak.
