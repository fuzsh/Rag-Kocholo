Registers with wood cabinets were primarily made between 1885 and the early 1890’s. The first generation cast metal cabinet registers were made in the early 1890’s and continued through 1908.

        "text": "The Class 300 was a basic cash register capable of keeping track of total sales. It served in a variety of setting including candy stores, cigar stands, restaurants, and dry goods stores. The cost of Class 300 new in 1909 ranged from $50 to $175, possibly higher depending on the options added. The 1909 National Cash Register Catalog describes it in this manner:\n\n“All Class 300 Registers are total-adding machines and are operated by pressing down the registering keys. When an amount key is pressed down the amount represented by it is automatically recorded and added on the total-adding counter, the amount recorded is shown by figures on the indicators in the top of the register, a bell is rung and the cash drawer thrown open. The total-adding counter shows at all times the total of all the cash recorded. This enables the merchant to know accurately and quickly how much money should be in the cash drawer at the close of a day’s business or at any time during the day. The amount shown by the adding wheels can only be seen when the lid of the register is unlocked and open.” (from The National Cash Register Catalog, August 16, 1909)\n\nExplanation of Model Numbers – Class 300\n\nThe Class 300 register comes in 5 sizes and with or without a sales printer. The five sizes are as follows: size1 – 15 keys, size 3 – 22 keys, size 4 – 27 keys, size 5 – 33 keys, and size 6 – 37 keys. There is no size 2 in this numbering system. In the Class 300 model number, the first number indicates Class. The second figure denotes the size. The third number tells the kind and key arrangement. Numbers ending in 2 and 3 are registers without a detail strip printer. Numbers ending in 6, 7, 8, and 9 are numbers with a detail strip printer. Numbers ending in 2, 6, and 8 have 1-cent key arrangements. Numbers ending in 3, 7, and 9 have 5-cent key arrangements.\n\nNumbering Example:\n\nModel number 357 – the first figure (3) denotes the class (Class 300). The second figure (5) denotes the size (33 keys). The third figure (7) indicates the kind and keyboard arrangement (detail strip printer with a keyboard laid out in 5 cent increments)."
