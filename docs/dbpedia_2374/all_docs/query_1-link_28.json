For a stretch of water to garner official state designation as a water trail it needs to include a public planning process, maps and signage, access points, management/stewardship commitment, safety information, and local government partnership.\n\nThe Great Miami River, Mad River, and Stillwater River were designated as state water trails in August, 2010 and all three water trails were designated as a national water trail in 2016. These three water trails are managed in partnership with the Miami Conservancy District, and other local government organizations.\n\nGetting Started\n\nSigning up for an instructional program is a great way to get started in local paddlesports.
