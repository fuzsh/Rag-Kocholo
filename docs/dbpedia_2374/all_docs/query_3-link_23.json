Friends funds also support and expand educational programs and school outreach.\n\nThrough the support of the Friends group, the museum has been furnished according to John Carlyle’s 1780 probate inventory, which lists items such as “1 Old Tea Chest Called the Mistake” and “2 walnut Clothes presses.” While the museum displays a fabulous array of 18th–century furnishings, the collection is not yet complete. As a Friend, you can help complete the Carlyle inventory. The Friends of Carlyle House sponsor a number of fundraising projects to support the collections.\n\nMembership benefits include:\n\nFree admission to the museum\n\n10% discount in the museum shop\n\nInvitations to events and exhibits\n\nIndividual Membership - $35 BUY NOW Family Membership - $50 BUY NOW Contributor Membership - $100 BUY NOW Patron Membership - $250 BUY NOW Benefactor Membership - $500 BUY NOW Braddock Society Membership - $1000 BUY NOW"
