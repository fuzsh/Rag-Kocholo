The Easter Sunrise Service is Carillon Historical Park’s oldest event. Since 1942, this powerful display of faith has continued, unbroken—a ceaseless tradition in an ever-changing city.

“As dawn broke on Sunday morning, April 5, the first Easter Service was held at the Deeds Carillon. An estimated crowd of 10,000 made the pilgrimage by automobile, bus and on foot.” The detail was included on page 14 of the April 1942 edition of the NCR Factory News.

As Carillon Historical Park’s first official event, the 1942 Easter Sunrise Service set a high precedent for the organization. At 6:30 a.m., with the sun rising from behind Ohio’s largest carillon, NCR organist Robert Kline entered the carillon console of the 151-foot limestone tower to herald the dawn of Easter Sunday. Amongst the swelling crowd were Carillon Historical Park founders Edward A. and Edith Walton Deeds.

For years on end, the Easter Sunrise Service has continued. In fair weather and foul, during triumphant and trying times, people from all walks of life have gathered at Deeds Carillon, in Dayton’s early morning Easter light, for this powerful display of faith.
