His will stated that the prizes should be awarded to “those who, during the preceding year, shall have conferred the greatest benefit to humankind.”\n\nFind out more about the establishment of the Nobel Prizes\n\nWho was Alfred Nobel?\n\nAlfred Nobel was an inventor, entrepreneur, scientist and businessman who also wrote poetry and drama. His varied interests are reflected in the Nobel Prizes which he laid the foundation for in 1895 in his last will and testament.\n\nLearn more about Alfred Nobel\n\nHow long have you been awarding Nobel Prizes?\n\nThe first Nobel Prizes were awarded in 1901 and they have been awarded annually since then. There have been years in that time when the Nobel Prizes have not been awarded - mostly during World War I (1914-1918) and II (1939-1945).\n\nSee a full list of all Nobel Prizes.\n\nWhat are the Nobel Prize categories?\n\nThe Nobel Prize categories are physics, chemistry, physiology or medicine, literature and peace – these were laid out in the will of Alfred Nobel. In 1968, Sveriges Riksbank (Sweden’s central bank) established the Sveriges Riksbank Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel.\n\nWhy isn’t there a Nobel Prize in mathematics, engineering, biology or environmental science?\n\nThe Nobel Prizes were designated in the will of Alfred Nobel and are in physics, chemistry, physiology or medicine, literature and peace. The economics prize was established much later and is a memorial prize, as indicated by its full name: the Sveriges Riksbank Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel. Its addition was an exception, to celebrate the tercentenary of Sweden’s central bank in 1968.\n\nSee the will of Alfred Nobel\n\nWhy is the Nobel Peace Prize awarded in Norway?\n\nIn his will Alfred Nobel laid out who he wanted to be responsible for the selection of the Nobel Prize laureates. The prizes were to be awarded by Swedish institutions – apart from the peace prize, whose award was to be decided by a committee of five persons elected by the Norwegian Parliament.\n\nDuring Nobel’s lifetime Sweden and Norway were joined in a union but we still don’t know exactly why Alfred Nobel chose for the peace prize to be awarded in Norway. However as the prize committee is located in Oslo, it follows that the prize is also awarded there.\n\nMore about the Norwegian Nobel committee\n\nWhere does the prize money come from?\n\nWhen Alfred Nobel died leaving the majority of his fortune to the establishment of the Nobel Prize he stated that the money should be converted into a fund and invested in “safe securities.” Today the interest earned on that money is used to fund the Nobel Prizes.\n\nMore about the prize money\n\nIs it possible to revoke a Nobel Prize?\n\nNo. Neither Alfred Nobel’s will nor the statutes of the Nobel Foundation mention any such possibility.\n\nRead a Q&A with Olav Njølstad, Director of the Norwegian Nobel Institute on this topic\n\nNobel Prize laureates\n\nWhy are they called Nobel Prize laureates?\n\nThe word “laureate” refers to being signified by the laurel wreath. In ancient Greece, laurel wreaths were awarded to victors as a sign of honour. Put that together with the Nobel Prize and we get “Nobel Prize laureate”.\n\nMore Nobel Prize facts\n\nHow many people can share the same Nobel Prize?\n\nA Nobel Prize can be shared by up to three individuals, or in the case of the peace prize, it can also be awarded to an organisation. The rule that a prize can only be awarded to three people comes from the statutes of the Nobel Foundation, which is responsible for fulfilling the intentions of Nobel’s will. It specifically states: “In no case may a prize amount be divided between more than three persons.”\n\nRead the statutes of the Nobel Foundation\n\nCan you award a prize posthumously?\n\nNo, a Nobel Prize cannot be awarded posthumously.\n\nHowever, since 1974, if the recipient dies after the prize has been announced they can still be awarded it. Previously, a person could be awarded a prize posthumously if they had already been nominated before 1 February of the same year, which was true of Erik Axel Karlfeldt (Nobel Prize in Literature 1931) and Dag Hammarskjöld (Nobel Peace Prize, 1961).\n\nFollowing the 2011 announcement of the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine, it was discovered that one of the medicine laureates, Ralph Steinman, had passed away three days earlier. The Board of the Nobel Foundation examined the statutes, and came to the conclusion that Ralph Steinman should continue to remain a Nobel Prize laureate, as the Nobel Assembly at Karolinska Institutet had announced the 2011 Nobel Prize laureates in physiology or medicine without knowing of his death.\n\nRead the statutes of the Nobel Foundation\n\nCan someone affiliated with an organisation (like the EU or the IPCC) which was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize claim to have received the honour?\n\nWhen an organisation is awarded the Nobel Peace Prize the organisation becomes the laureate, not the individuals working there. Therefore those people connected to or working for a Nobel Prize awarded organisation cannot in any way refer to themselves personally as a Nobel Prize laureate.\n\nHow do you look upon criticism of Nobel Peace Prize laureates after they have been awarded?\n\nFor answers to this and other questions about the Nobel Peace Prize read our Q&A with Olav Njølstad, Director of the Norwegian Nobel Institute.\n\nThe Nobel Foundation does not disclose addresses to Nobel Prize laureates out of courtesy. Please contact the institution, organisation or university to which the Nobel Prize laureate was affiliated at the time of the award. For literature laureates please contact their publishing house. Alternatively you may be able to contact some laureates via social media.\n\nHow Nobel Prize laureates are chosen\n\nWho selects the Nobel Prize laureates?\n\nIn his last will and testament, Alfred Nobel specifically designated the institutions responsible for the prizes he wished to be established.\n\nThe Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences for the Nobel Prize in Physics and Chemistry\n\nKarolinska Institutet (now The Nobel Assembly at Karolinska Institutet) for the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine\n\nThe Swedish Academy for the Nobel Prize in Literature\n\nA committee of five persons to be elected by the Norwegian Parliament (Storting) for the Nobel Peace Prize.\n\nLinks to the prize awarding institutions’ websites\n\nHow do you become nominated for a Nobel Prize?\n\nIn order to become a Nobel Prize laureate you must first be nominated for a prize by an eligible nominator. Self-nomination is not allowed. Except for the Nobel Peace Prize, nomination is by invitation only and nominators must fulfil the criteria set out by the awarding institutions.\n\nEligible nominations are then considered by the prize awarders, who make the final decision as to who will receive a Nobel Prize.\n\nTo find out who can be a nominator in each prize category, see the links below.\n\nNomination and selection of physics laureates\n\nNomination and selection of chemistry laureates\n\nNomination and selection of medicine laureates\n\nNomination and selection of literature laureates\n\nNomination and selection of peace prize laureates\n\nNomination and selection of economic sciences laureates\n\nHow can you become a nominator?\n\nOnly people who fulfil the criteria set out by the prize awarding institutions are allowed to nominate candidates for the Nobel Prize. To find out who can be a nominator in each prize category, see the links below.\n\nNomination and selection of physics laureates\n\nNomination and selection of chemistry laureates\n\nNomination and selection of medicine laureates\n\nNomination and selection of literature laureates\n\nNomination and selection of peace laureates\n\nNomination and selection of economic sciences laureates\n\nIs being nominated an endorsement by the Nobel Prize?\n\nNo. Hundreds or thousands of nominations are received for the Nobel Prize every year from members of academies, university professors, scientists, previous Nobel Prize laureates, members of parliamentary assemblies and more.\n\nIn theory anybody could be put forward for a prize and as such being nominated is in no way an endorsement by the Nobel Prize. That is reserved for those individuals and organisations that are selected as Nobel Prize laureates.\n\nAre three nominations enough to be awarded the Nobel Prize?\n\nFrederick G. Banting and John Macleod were awarded the 1923 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine the first year they were nominated (with three nominations) for their discovery of insulin. By contrast, Robert Koch was nominated 55 times over 4 years before he received the prize in 1905 for his discoveries concerning tuberculosis.\n\nSearch in the nomination archive for more information\n\nIs it possible to nominate someone for a posthumous Nobel Prize?\n\nNo, it is not possible to nominate someone for a posthumous Nobel Prize.\n\nSee Can you award a prize posthumously? as well as paragraph 4 of the statutes of the Nobel Foundation.\n\nCan I find out who has been nominated for a Nobel Prize?\n\nNominations can only be made public at least 50 years after the nomination has taken place – so nominations for this year’s Nobel Prizes are a closely guarded secret. Any rumours regarding recent nominees are either just rumour, or someone among the invited nominators has leaked information. Since the nominations are kept secret for at least 50 years, you’ll have to wait until then to find out.\n\nFor prizes older than 50 years old, you can browse the nomination archive. Note that in some cases the archives are sealed as long as people mentioned are still alive.\n\nCan an eligible nominator reveal who they have nominated for the Nobel Prize within 50 years?\n\nAccording to the statutes of the Nobel Foundation, information about the nominations is not to be disclosed, publicly or privately, for a period of fifty years. The restriction not only concerns the nominees and nominators, but also investigations and opinions in the awarding of a prize.\n\nHow do the committees decide who to award the prizes to?\n\nEvery committee is slightly different but ultimately they all work to fulfil the will of Alfred Nobel which stated that the Nobel Prize should be awarded according to those who have “conferred the greatest benefit to humankind.”\n\nYou can find out more about the process of selection for each Nobel Prize at the links below:\n\nNomination and selection of physics laureates\n\nNomination and selection of chemistry laureates\n\nNomination and selection of medicine laureates\n\nNomination and selection of literature laureates\n\nNomination and selection of peace laureates\n\nNomination and selection of economic sciences laureates\n\nIs it possible for a committee to look over my work?\n\nNo, the committees cannot comment on work outside of their Nobel Prize responsibilities. It is not in the purpose of these committees to generally assess or evaluate any scientific or literary work beyond the assessment of nominations for the Nobel Prizes.\n\nSee also How do you become nominated for a Nobel Prize?\n\nDo the Nobel Committees ever reconsider a choice?\n\nNo. For the very same reasons a prize cannot be revoked. According to the statutes of the Nobel Foundation, § 10, “No appeals may be made against the decision of a prize-awarding body with regard to the award of a prize”.\n\nWhat if the awarded inventions fail after some time, say two years later?\n\nA Nobel Prize cannot be revoked.\n\nSee also Do the Nobel Committees ever reconsider a choice?\n\nThe Nobel Prize award ceremonies\n\nWhat is the Nobel Day?\n\nThe Nobel Day – which takes place on 10 December every year – marks the anniversary of Alfred Nobel’s death and is the day that the Nobel Prizes are presented to Nobel Prize laureates.\n\nSee Nobel Prize award ceremonies for more information.\n\nFor the Nobel Prizes in Physics and Chemistry and the Prize in Economic Sciences: The Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences, see www.kva.se/en/contact-us/\n\nFor the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine:\n\nThe Nobel Assembly at Karolinska Institutet, e-mail: [email protected]\n\nFor the Nobel Prize in Literature:\n\nThe Swedish Academy, e-mail: [email protected]\n\nFor the Nobel Peace Prize:\n\nThe Norwegian Nobel Committee, e-mail: [email protected]\n\nCopyright photos and images\n\nCan I use a photo of a Nobel Prize laureate?\n\nFor uses of photos permission from the Nobel Foundation or Nobel Prize Outreach AB, and in certain cases, from the photographer, is required.\n\nTo apply for a permit for a photo, contact Nobel Prize Outreach.\n\nIf permission is granted, “© The Nobel Foundation” or “© Nobel Prize Outreach” must be indicated.\n\nThe Nobel Foundation can unfortunately not grant permissions to use portrait photos of the Nobel Prize laureates of 1901-2006 due to copyright restrictions.
