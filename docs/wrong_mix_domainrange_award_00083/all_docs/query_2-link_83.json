        "text": "Abstract: This paper presents an empirical study on the frequency of discoveries and inventions that were awarded with the. More than 70 per cent of all Nobel Prizes were given to discoveries. The majority of inventions were awarded at the beginning of the twentieth century and only three inventions had a direct application for society. The emphasis on discoveries moves the Nobel Prize further away from its original intention to reward the greatest contribution to society in the preceding year.\n\nNobel Prize Physics 1921 on Wrong Theory And Incomplete Work. as Photoelectric Effect is Triggered by Divine Mechanics Rather Than Quantum (Particle) Nature of Photon. It is Divine MONB (Modified Neils Bohr) That Underpins Laws of Photoelectric Effects Rather Than Quantum Theory (Wave Packet) Abstract: Matter (usually metals) when light shines on it , Einstein explained the effect by proposing that light consists of small particles, or quanta, called photons, which carry energy that is proportional to the frequency of light. The electrons in the matter that absorb the energy of the photon get ejected. Einstein did not give the right explanation , hence the work is incomplete. It is divine mechanics that triggers the phenomenon. The energy of photons is an stimulus and the thoughts which are triggered or expressed are fed thoughts and feeding was done in precreation era by the highest center of the universe (Creator B.B.B). Different types of stimulus (different magnitudes of energies) trigger different thoughts that give different effects when they interact with matter. These effects are photoelectric effect, Compton effect and pair production effect. There are many thoughts that trigger and control the phenomenon. But to understand the concept , few thoughts are depicted in diagrams. There is a feedback to higher center before next thought is triggered. It confirms divine nature of Photon and matter rather than particle nature or dual nature (wave packet) .\n\nWe briefly discuss the myth of a possible missing letter from Bohr to Lattes and show the only content of the Bohr archives concerning the Brazilian physicist. We also analyze and discuss the Nobel Prize in Physics Nominations and Nominees from 1901 to 1963. For example, the highest number of nominations (considering data up to the year of the Nobel Prize) was received by Otto Stern, with a total of 82 nominations. It was found that the average number of nominations per Nobel Prize awarded was 30.7, and only nine of the total 80 prizewinners surpassed this average. In contrast, it was observed that in many years, there were laureates with just zero, one, two or three nominations - an indicator of high subjectivity, as verified by experts on bibliometric data. From the data presented, it is concluded that Lattes (as well as his colleague, collaborator and friend ‘Beppo’ Occhialini) received enough nominations to be awarded the Nobel Prize not once but twice; thus, the necessity of a letter on this subject remains valid\n\nThis paper examines the early years of decision making in the award of the Nobel Prize in physics and chemistry, and shows how the prize became a tool in the boundary work which upheld the social demarcations between scientists and inventors, as well as promoting a particular normative view of individual scientific achievement. The Nobel committees were charged with rewarding scientific achievements that benefited humankind: their interpretation of that criterion, however, turned in the first instance on their assessment of the groundbreaking nature of the ‘science’, with the applied or practical ‘benefits’ of that discovery being treated as very much secondary factors in the award. Through an interrogation of the reports sent by the committees to the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences, this paper shows how committee members depended on a notion of ‘post-dated utilitarianism’ in reconciling potential tension between rewarding basic and applied science, and explores the ways in which ...\n\nThe Nobel Prize has acted as a surrogate record of invention and discovery throughout the twentieth century. Based on this surrogacy, many claims are made regarding both trends in research and claims for places of research excellence. In this paper I propose that any analysis should be weighted by the 'prize share' made by the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences to each recipient. In addition, I argue for a focus on the organization and period when the prize-winning research was carried out, rather than when the award was made and the often quoted 'affiliated organization at the time of award'. I use this to briefly examine types of invention and discovery for all Nobel Prizes in Physics awarded to date (1901-2019). I then use this 'place' lens to briefly explore trends in invention and discovery in the awarding of the Nobel Prize in Physics. I conclude by drawing attention to the difference between institutions claiming Nobel Laureates and institutions where Nobel Prize-winning discoveries and inventions have been made."
