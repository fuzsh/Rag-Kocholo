        "text": "New research by NBER affiliates, circulated prior to peer review for discussion and comment. NBER Working Papers may not offer policy recommendations or normative judgments about policies, but may report analytic results on the effects of policies. The NBER distributes more than 1,200 Working Papers each year.\n\nPapers issued more than 18 months ago are open access. More recent papers are available without charge to affiliates of subscribing academic institutions, employees of NBER Corporate Associates, government employees in the US, journalists, and residents of low-income countries. All visitors to the NBER website may access up to 3 working papers each year without a subscription.\n\nThe NBER endeavors to make its web content accessible to all. To request an accessible version of a Working Paper, please contact webaccessibility@nber.org and one will be provided within 5 business days.\n\nThe free New This Week email, which contains the abstracts of each new batch of working papers, is distributed every Monday morning. Account log-in or creation is required."
