Biography

Johannes Stark is Notable.

Johannes Stark is born April 15, 1874 in Schickenhof, German Empire.[1] He was the son of farmer Georg Stark and Maria Margaretha Christina Gollwitzer.[2]

He is a German physicist who is awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1919 "for his discovery of the Doppler effect in canal rays and the splitting of spectral lines in electric fields". This phenomenon is known as the Stark effect.

Stark receives his Ph.D. in physics from the University of Munich in 1897 under the supervision of Eugen von Lommel, and serves as Lommel's assistant until his appointment as a lecturer at the University of Göttingen in 1900. He is an extraordinary professor at the University of Hannover from 1906 until he becomes a professor at RWTH Aachen University in 1909. In 1917, he becomes professor at the University of Greifswald, and also works at the University of Würzburg from 1920 to 1922.

A supporter of Adolf Hitler from 1924, Stark is one of the main figures, along with fellow Nobel laureate Philipp Lenard, in the anti-Semitic Deutsche Physik movement, which seeks to remove Jewish scientists from German physics. He is appointed head of the German Research Foundation in 1933 and is president of the Reich Physical-Technical Institute from 1933 to 1939. In 1947, he is found guilty as a "Major Offender" by a denazification court.

Johann Nikolaus Stark married Luise Katharina Uebler on 16 Aug 1905 at Bezirksamt Mannheim, Kreis Mannheim, Großherzogtum Baden, Deutsches Reich. The transcription lists his parents as Joh. Georg Stark and Maria Christine Margarethe (alias Gollwitzer) and hers as Johann Friedrich Uebler and Eva Maria Magdalena (alias Bärenklau). He was born 15 April 1874 and she was born 21 September 1884. [3] Note that this paragraph relies on the transcription online except for his birth date, which was transcribed incorrectly. Her family name is written with a "b" rather than the "p" seen on most sites.

Stark dies June 21, 1957 in Traunstein, West Germany. There is a monument shown on FindAGrave, but it is not clear whether this was the actual burial location.[4]

Research Notes

Johann Stark's wife is called Luise Uepler at the Nobel prize site[5] and that spelling has been copied elsewhere. It seems to be incorrect. Her marriage record shows Uebler and a German biography site has Uebeler.[6] Also note that while "ü "is often written "ue" in English the German sources have "Ue" at the beginning of the name, so this was apparently not a name with an umlaut.

A biographical sketch at FindAGrave names his parents Alton Stark and Elizabeth Erhart. This contradicts the names Joh. Georg Stark and Maria Christine Margarethe (alias Gollwitzer) seen elsewhere, but more work is needed to resolve this.

The Nobel site says that he had five children. A headstone naming Johannes and Luisa also shows Friedrich (1906-1955) and Maria (1915-1995). The Deutsche Biographie site appears to list 2 sons, Fritz and Hans and 3 daughters Anneliese (1913), Elfriede (1914), and Marlene (1914). This is packed into a single cryptic line, so it is not clear whether the years represent birth dates or something else, nor is it even certain that S stands for Sohn and T for Tochter as I have assumed. This information can't be considered definitive, but may provide useful starting points for further research.
