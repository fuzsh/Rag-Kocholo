And the great thing -- the truly democratic thing about it -- is that you don't even have to be a player to lose.\n\nBarbara Ehrenreich\n\nDemocracy is two wolves and a lamb voting on what to have for lunch. Liberty is a well-armed lamb contesting the vote!\n\nBenjamin Franklin\n\nThey that can give up essential liberty to purchase a little temporary safety deserve neither liberty or safety.\n\nBenjamin Franklin\n\nThey that can give up essential liberty to obtain a little temporary safety deserve neither liberty nor safety.\n\nBenjamin Franklin\n\nVote for the man who promises least; he'll be the least disappointing.\n\nBernard Baruch\n\nThose against politics are in favor of the politics inflicted upon them.\n\nBertolt Brecht\n\nA democrat need not believe that the majority will always reach a wise decision.

Mencken (1880-1956)\n\nThe argument that capital punishment degrades the state is moonshine, for if that were true then it would degrade the state to send men to war...

Mencken (1880-1956)\n\nThe most common of all follies is to believe passionately in the palpably not true. It is the chief occupation of mankind.\n\nH.L.

Mencken (1880-1956)\n\nIt is impossible to imagine the universe run by a wise, just and omnipotent God, but it is quite easy to imagine it run by a board of gods. If such a board actually exists it operates precisely like the board of a corporation that is losing money.\n\nH.L. Mencken (1880-1956)\n\nUnder democracy one party always devotes its chief energies to trying to prove that the other party is unfit to rule--and both commonly succeed, and are right...\n\nH.L. Mencken (1880-1956)\n\nWherever politics intrudes upon economic life, political success is readily attained by saying what people like to hear rather than what is demonstrably true. Instead of safeguarding truth and honesty, the state then tends to become a major source of insi\n\nHans F. Sennholz\n\nDemocracy is based upon the conviction that there are extraordinary possibilities in ordinary people.\n\nHarry Emerson Fosdick\n\nDemocracy cannot be forced upon a society, neither is it a gift that can be held forever. It has to be struggled hard for and defended everyday anew.\n\nHeinz Galinski\n\nOur democracy is but a name. We vote? What does that mean? It means that we choose between two bodies of real, though not avowed, autocrats. We choose between Tweedledum and Tweedledee.\n\nHelen Keller\n\nThe majority is never right. Never, I tell you! That's one of these lies in society that no free and intelligent man can help rebelling against.

William Fulbright\n\nDemocracy without morality is impossible.\n\nJack Kemp\n\nIn a democracy the people get what the majority deserves.\n\nJames Davidson\n\nThinking of mass democracy as government controlled by its employees helps explain the difficulty of changing government policy.\n\nJames Davidson\n\nThe tendency of democracies is, in all things, to mediocrity, since the tastes, knowledge, and principles of the majority form the tribunal of appeal.\n\nJames Fenimore Cooper\n\nIt is the besetting vice of democracies to substitute public opinion for law. This is the usual form in which the masses of men exhibit their tyranny.\n\nJames Fenimore Cooper\n\nThe disposition of all power is to abuses, nor does it at all mend the matter that its possessors are a majority.\n\nJames Fenimore Cooper\n\nDemocracies have been found incompatible with personal security or the rights of property; and in general been as short in their lives as they have been violent in their death.\n\nJames Madison\n\nThe ultimate authority ... resides in the people alone.\n\nJames Madison\n\nThe advancement and diffusion of knowledge is the only guardian of true liberty.\n\nJames Madison\n\nIf we advert to the nature of republican government, we shall find that the censorial power is in the people over the government, and not in the government over the people.\n\nJames Madison\n\nDemocracy gives every man the right to be his own oppressor.\n\nJames Russell Lowell\n\nDemocracy is the form of government that gives every man the right to be his own oppressor.\n\nJames Russell Lowell\n\nThose accept an obligation lightly who feel lightly about letting it drop.\n\nJanis Rainis\n\nDemocracy is good. I say this because other systems are worse.\n\nJawaharlal Nehru\n\nDemocracy means having the choice.

Indeed, the world is ruled by little else.\n\nJohn Maynard Keynes\n\nAnarchy is the sure consequence of tyranny; for no power that is not limited by laws can ever be protected by them.\n\nJohn Milton\n\nDemocracy ... is a system of self-determination. It's the right to make the wrong choice.\n\nJohn Patrick\n\nDemocracy encourages the majority to decide things about which the majority is blissfully ignorant.\n\nJohn Simon\n\nDemocracy encourages the majority to decide things about which the majority is ignorant.\n\nJohn Simon\n\nIf mankind minus one were of one opinion, then mankind is no more justified in silencing the one than the one - if he had the power - would be justified in silencing mankind.\n\nJohn Stuart Mill\n\nThose who suppress freedom always do so in the name of law and order.\n\nJohn V. Lindsay\n\nThe well being of democracies regardless of their type and status is dependent on one small technical detail: The right to vote.

Tucker\n\nI personally call the type of government which can be removed without violence 'democracy,' and the other, 'tyranny.'.\n\nKarl Popper\n\nIt is wrong to ask who will rule.

Its limit is reached when the looted turn on the looters.\n\nLlewellyn H. Rockwell, Jr\n\nIt is bad to be oppressed by a minority, but it is worse to be oppressed by a majority.\n\nLord Acton\n\nThe essence of democracy is not that everyone makes and administers laws but that lawgivers and rulers should be dependent on the people's will in such a way that they may be peaceably changed if conflict occurs.\n\nLudwig von Mises\n\nIn the long run the ideas of the majority, however detrimental they may be, will carry on. The future of mankind depends on the ability of the elite to influence public opinion in the right direction.\n\nLudwig von Mises\n\nDespots and democratic majorities are drunk with power.\n\nLudwig von Mises\n\nThose believing they have not voted are mistaken, for their indifference affects all our futures.\n\nM.A. Denck\n\nThere is nothing more difficult to take in hand, more perilous to conduct, or more uncertain in its success, than to take the lead in the introduction of a new order of things.\n\nMachiavelli\n\nIn matters of conscience, the law of majority has no place.\n\nMahatma Gandhi\n\nThere is no reason to believe that there is one law for families and another for nations.\n\nMahatma Gandhi\n\nAn eye for an eye makes the whole world blind.\n\nMahatma Gandhi\n\nRetaliation is counter-poison and poison breeds more poison.

It is a weapon of the strongest and bravest.\n\nMahatma Gandhi\n\nThe force generated by nonviolence is infinitely greater than the force of all the arms created by man's ingenuity.\n\nMahatma Gandhi\n\nA \"No\" uttered from deepest conviction is better and greater than a \"Yes\" merely uttered to please, or what is worse, to avoid trouble.\n\nMahatma Gandhi\n\nThe only tyrant I accept in this world is the still voice within.\n\nMahatma Gandhi\n\nWhat you do is of little significance, but it is very important that you do it.\n\nMahatma Gandhi\n\nWe must become the change we want to see in the world.\n\nMahatma Gandhi\n\nThe only devils in the world are those running around in our own hearts - that is where the battle should be fought.\n\nMahatma Gandhi\n\nPerformance of one's duties should be independent of public opinion.\n\nMahatma Gandhi\n\nThe spirit of democracy cannot be superimposed from the outside.

Indeed, it is the only thing that ever has.\n\nMargaret Mead\n\nWe adore titles and heredities in our hearts and ridicule them with our mouths. This is our democratic privilege.\n\nMark Twain\n\nDemocracy is the name we give the people whenever we need them.\n\nMarquis de Flers Robert and Arman de Caillavet\n\nIn actual fact those who do not care for politics and sit on the fence do indeed side for a political party: The ruling party.\n\nMax Frisch\n\nThe dignity of man is in free choice.\n\nMax Frisch\n\nAny law which violates the indefeasible rights of man is essentially unjust and tyrannical; it is not a law at all.\n\nMaximilien Robespierre\n\nEverybody's for democracy in principle.

Instead, we must adopt the theory that, by their occasional mobilisations as a majority, people support or oppose the individuals who actually govern.\n\nWalter Lippman\n\nThis is one of the paradoxes of the democratic movement -- that it loves a crowd and fears the individuals who compose it -- that the religion of humanity should have no faith in human beings.\n\nWalter Lippmann\n\nToo many people expect wonders from democracy, when the most wonderful thing of all is just having it.\n\nWalter Winchell\n\nPolitical elections do not choose leaders of society. Rather, they are an exercise in which groups of people choose individuals who will assist them in looting other groups of individuals.\n\nWilliam Anderson\n\nThe best defense against usurpatory government is an assertive citizenry.\n\nWilliam F. Buckley\n\nTruth often suffers more by the heat of its defenders than the arguments of its opposers.\n\nWilliam Penn\n\nNecessity is the plea for every infringement of human freedom: it is the argument of tyrants; it is the creed of slaves.\n\nWilliam Pitt\n\nA politician will do anything to keep his job - even become a patriot.\n\nWilliam Randolph Hearst\n\nThe best argument against democracy is a five minute conversation with the average voter.\n\nWinston Churchill\n\nMany forms of Government have been tried, and will be tried in this world of sin and woe.
