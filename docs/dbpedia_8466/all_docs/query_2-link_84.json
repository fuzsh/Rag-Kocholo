        "text": "“With its signal distinction between ‘intuition’ and ‘analysis’ and its exploration of the different levels of Duration (Bergson’s term for Heraclitean flux), An Introduction to Metaphysics has had a significant impact on subsequent twentieth century thought. The arts, from post-impressionist painting to the stream of consciousness novel, and philosophies as diverse as pragmatism, process philosophy, and existentialism bear its imprint. Consigned for a while to the margins of philosophy, Bergson’s thought is making its way back to the mainstream. The reissue of this important work comes at an opportune time, and will be welcomed by teachers and scholars alike.”\n\n—Peter A. Y. Gunter, University of North Texas\n\nLearn More\n\nRemarkable products of a nation deeply implicated in the Atlantic slave trade, the seventeenth-century Spanish plays Juan Latino, The Brave Black Soldier, and Virtues Overcome Appearances appear together in English for the first time in this volume. The three protagonists not only defy the period’s color-based prejudices but smash through its ultimate social barrier: marriage into the white nobility. Michael Kidd’s fluid translations and extensive critical introduction, bibliography, and glossary are enhanced by Hackett’s title support webpage.

This edition of Maria Edgeworth’s first novel is based on the 1832 edition, the last revised by her, and includes Susan Kubica Howard’s foot-of-the-page notes on the text of the memoir as well as on the notes and glosses the Editor offers \"for the information of the ignorant English reader.\" Howard’s Introduction situates the novel in its political and historical context and suggests a reading of the novel as Edgeworth’s contribution to the discussion of the controversial Act of Union between Ireland and Britain that went into effect immediately after the novel’s publication in London in 1800.\n\nLearn More\n\n\"A handy paperback edition offered primarily to teachers and students who can make no pretense of reading the entirety of the large work, but who want to sample some of its chief delights. . . . [Grant gives us an] exemplary translation . . . marked above all by great accuracy and fidelity to Tocqueville’s text. . . . Kessler’s editor’s Introduction is a model introduction to a classic text for today’s students. It is clearly written, compact (without being too short or dense), and nicely structured. . . .

Barnard and Shapiro explore the relevant historical, cultural, and literary backgrounds in their illuminating Introduction; they skillfully annotate the text; they provide useful and up-to-date bibliographies; and they append a number of revealing primary texts for further cultural contextualization. This edition will help to stimulate new thinking about race, empire, and sexuality in Brown's prescient novel of the American frontier.\" —Robert S. Levine, University of Maryland\n\n\"The striking painting by a French artist on the cover of this American novel signals the editors' refreshing approach to Edgar Huntly through trans-Atlantic discourses of empire, radical-democratic social theory, sensibility, and sexuality. . . .This edition provides students with the tools to contextualize and analyze Edgar Huntly, including an extensive bibliography of relevant scholarship and footnotes that define unfamiliar words, give historical background, or refer the reader back to the introduction. Barnard and Shapiro's selection of related texts from works including William Godwin's Political Justice and Brown's essays gives students insight on Edgar Huntly's sources.\" —Yvette Piggush, Journal of the Early Republic\n\nLearn More\n\n\"Faithful to the original Danish text and eminently readable, Jech's translation of Fear and Trembling admirably communicates the literary qualities of Kierkegaard's text, as well as his occasional fits of inspiration. Jech displays an unusual sensitivity not only to the literary/linguistic qualities of Kierkegaard’s prose, but also to his (often realized) aspirations to philosophical precision. As presented by Jech, Kierkegaard is not simply a gifted writer and speculative theologian dabbling in philosophy, but a philosopher concerned to limn the optimal role of philosophical reflection, and to do so experimentally, especially with respect to matters of morality and faith. The translation is furthermore supplemented by very helpful explanatory notes that convey Kierkegaard’s own erudition and the multiple influences upon his thinking. The Historical Glossary will become a valuable reference tool for students and scholars of Kierkegaard’s writings. It is likely to play a welcome role in encouraging an improved understanding of what Kierkegaard means when he employs his idiosyncratic categories, allusions, and vocabulary.\" —Daniel Conway, Professor of Philosophy and Humanities, Texas A&M University\n\nLearn More\n\nThis volume offers lively and accurate translations of Chekhov's major plays and one-acts (complete contents listed below) along with a superb Introduction focused on the plays' remarkably enduring power to elicit the most widely divergent of responses, the life of the playwright in its historical and aesthetic contexts, suggestions for reading the plays \"under a microscope,\" and notes designed to bring Chekhov's world into immediate focus—everything needed to examine his drama with fresh eyes and on its own artistic terms.

Offering a new account of the complex history of its composition, and drawing upon his deep knowledge of eighteenth- and nineteenth-century scientific debates, Wootton reveals the ways in which the origins of Shelley’s novel are inextricably linked to conceptions of the origins of life itself. We have here a transformative reading of one of the world’s best-known stories.\" —Laura Marcus, Goldsmiths' Professor of English Literature and Fellow of New College, University of Oxford\n\n\"David Wootton, the editor of a splendid new edition of Frankenstein that includes a rich variety of relevant texts, prefers to focus on the contribution made to the novel by Mary’s reading of contemporary articles on travel (the book’s first narrator, Robert Walton, is bound for the North Pole, which he describes as 'the favourite dream of my early years'). Wootton's magisterial introduction grants equal significance to the earnest discussions about generating life that took place in 1816 at Lord Byron's lakeside villa in Switzerland, where Frankenstein was conceived.\"\n\n—Miranda Seymour in The New York Review of Books\n\nClick here to see the full Table of Contents with the list of related texts included.\n\nLearn More\n\n“Raymond Mackenzie’s elegant new translation of Émile Zola’s Germinal captures the diction of the novel’s colorful characters and the restrained voice of a naturalist narrator. David Baguley’s introduction analyzes Zola’s personal background, his literary and scientific influences, and the historical circumstances of French workers in the 1860s as well as a spectrum of political acts and deeds in the 1880s when the novel was written. These features plus Zola’s notes on the town of Anzin that he studied prior to writing the novel, make this the edition of choice for course adoptions in history and literature.\" —Stephen Kern, Ohio State University\n\nLearn More\n\n“If ever a literary work was a sleep of reason, bruised by menacing shapes, it is Kleist’s. He was one of the first of a line of German writers whose inwardness is so intense it seems to dissolve the weak bonds of his society. . . . Even as order and paternalism struggled to assert themselves in the private and public life of the nineteenth century, Kleist was introducing scenes of mob violence, cannibalism, and less than benevolent fathers. . . . David Constantine, a distinguished poet and Germanist, and a translator of Hölderlin, has taken pains to give us a literary Kleist, ‘a writer we cannot do without.’ . . . This book, containing all the stories and three key plays, provides a compelling view of a misfit genius who, in one of his last notes, remarked ‘the world is a strange set-up.’”\n\n—Iain Bamforth, The Times Literary Supplement\n\nLearn More\n\nIn addition to a substantial introduction to the life and works of Federico García Lorca—avant-garde poet, playwright, and soul of Spain's \"Generation of '27\"—this collection features vibrant new English translations of four of his plays. The legacy of a dramatic, religious, and social iconoclast whose death made him a martyr of the left in Civil-War Spain and who today is embraced as a gay icon shines through in Michael Kidd's stage-worthy renderings of Yerma, Blood Wedding, The House of Bernarda Alba, and a more experimental play, The Audience, a kaleidoscopic exploration of sexual identity and theater.\n\n\"Kidd's translations are excellent. The biographical and critical material included as front matter in the volume are aimed at the English-speaking layman reader, and are appropriate for that reader, but interesting to the specialist too, as Kidd's thoughts on the texts include more reflection than is common in the scholarship on (for instance) questions of producibility, taking the plays as scripts intended to be performed, rather than only as texts to be read from a page. Kidd's book would be an ideal introduction to Lorca's theater for an English-speaking audience.\" —David W.

It is at once a bold literary experiment and an incisive social document; its formal adventurousness is matched by its searching political commentary. White's meticulous editing and annotation, and his superb Introduction and interpretive apparatus, make this an edition that will be greatly useful in the classroom as well as magnificently informative and challenging for scholars. Most important, it returns to print in beautiful form a deeply fascinating and wonderfully confounding early American literary masterpiece, one of the truly great American books. Henry Adams aptly called it 'a satire on democracy written by a democrat,' celebrated its 'genuine and original qualities,' and said it was 'more thoroughly American than any book yet published.' Modern Chivalry's capacious humor, epic ambition, and trenchant political satire make it not only intellectually fascinating but also wickedly enjoyable.\"\n\n—Christopher Looby, Department of English, UCLA\n\nLearn More\n\nDostoevsky's disturbing and groundbreaking novella appears in this new annotated edition with an Introduction by Charles Guignon and Kevin Aho. An analogue of Guignon's widely praised Introduction to his 1993 edition of \"The Grand Inquisitor,\" the editors' Introduction places the underground man in the context of European modernity, analyzes his inner dynamics in the light of the history of Russian cultural and intellectual life, and suggests compelling reasons for our own strange affinity for this nameless man who boldly declares, \"I was rude and took pleasure in being so.\"\n\nLearn More\n\n\"Hackett’s On the Genealogy of Morality (we now have even the correct title!) may very well change the entire climate for reading Nietzsche in English—especially if read in conjunction with their equally splendid Twilight of the Idols. . . . Competing translations of Nietzsche’s late, utterly influential masterpieces have often made them a chore, rather than a delight, to read; and their introductions generally obscure, rather than illuminate, the texts’ situations. Clark and Swensen (and Polt and Strong) have made the Genealogy and Twilight accessible and exhilarating—while leaving them, as they are, enigmatic and problematic.

Having edited Paradise Lost myself (Norton, 2005), I was curious and keen to see Professor Kastan's.

Also included are letters of biographical interest which, in Middleton’s words, “mark the stresses and turnings of his life.” Among the addressees are Richard Wagner, Erwin Rohde, Jacob Burkhardt, Lou Salomé, his mother, and his sister Elisabeth. The “annihilating split” in Nietzsche’s personality that has been associated with his collapse on a street in Turin in 1889 is described in a moving letter from Franz Overbeck which forms the Epilogue.

I attribute the success of [t]his volume to the way Chasteen highlights points of personal identification for an English-speaking readership, especially students, and the way he frames these short stories by Machado as relevant sources for a comparative history of racial politics in Brazil and the USA. . . . In my evaluations of Chasteen's translations, I am drawing from student reactions to their first exposure to Machado through this volume in a course about Brazilian culture taught at the University of California, Los Angeles. In short, they loved Machado and quickly made him their own. I credit this immediate embrace with the way Chasteen has selected, ordered, and framed the collection with a young student audience in mind. He introduces Machado with selections that reflect the concerns of an educated class through the eyes of a young university student.\" —Machado de Assis em linha, The Electronic Journal of Machado Studies\n\nLearn More\n\nThis compilation of writings from Erasmus and Luther’s great debate—over free will and grace, and their respective efficacy for salvation—offers a fuller representation of the disputants’ main arguments than has ever been available in a single volume in English. Included are key, corresponding selections from not only Erasmus’ conciliatory A Discussion or Discourse concerning Free Will and Luther’s forceful and fully argued rebuttal, but—with the battle now joined—from Erasmus’ own forceful and fully argued rebuttal of Luther. Students of Reformation theology, Christian humanism, and sixteenth-century rhetoric will find here the key to a wider appreciation of one of early modern Christianity’s most illuminating and disputed controversies.\n\nLearn More\n\n“[Beaumarchais’] fame rests on Le Barbier de Seville (1775) and Le Mariage de Figaro (1784), the only French plays which his stage-struck century bequeathed to the international repertoire. But his achievement has been adulterated, for ‘Beaumarchais’ has long been the brand name of a product variously reprocessed by Mozart, Rossini, and the score or so librettists and musicians who have perpetuated his plots, his characters, and his name. The most intriguing question of all has centered on his role as catalyst of the Revolution. Was his impertinent barber the Sweeney Todd of the Ancien Régime, the true begetter of the guillotine? . . . Beaumarchais’ plays have often seemed to need the same kind of shoring up as his reputation, as though they couldn’t stand on their own without a scaffolding of good tunes. Yet, as John Wells’ lively and splendidly speakable translations of the Barber, the Marriage, and A Mother’s Guilt demonstrate, they need assistance from no one. [Beaumarchais] thought of the three plays as a trilogy. Taken together, they reflect, as John Leigh’s commentaries make clear, the Ancien Régime’s unstoppable slide into revolution.”\n\n—David Coward in The London Review of Books\n\nLearn More\n\n\"This collection gives us a sense of the depth of Dostoevsky's insights into human life and suffering and of his profound understanding of the tensions and dangers of modernity. Guignon's Introduction is a brilliant study that shows how profoundly the 'legend of the Grand Inquisitor' speaks to our day.\" —Charles Taylor, McGill University\n\n\"Guignon's Introduction is by far the best available to these texts, and is, for its clarity and depth, one of the finest Introductions to complex literary or philosophical material that I've ever read.\" —Stephen L. Collins, Babson College\n\nLearn More\n\nIn addition to a fresh translation of Los de Abajo, Azuela's classic novel of the Mexican Revolution, this volume offers both a general Introduction to the work and an extensive appendix setting the novel in its historical, literary, and political context. Related texts include contemporary reviews of Azuela's book, an excerpt from Anita Brenner's Idols Behind Altars (1929), and selections from John Reed's Insurgent Mexico (1914).\n\n\"Pellón's translation marks a clear improvement over the previous English versions of this seminal novel. Pellón captures the crisp, tense, and terse dialogue of Azuela's original, and I believe that his decision to leave some words in Spanish is a good one, given that most of the words involved are already well known to the non-Spanish speaking public. The retention of these Spanish words adds flavor to the translation without turning it into a 'Taco Bell' version of the novel. I am so enthusiastic about Pellón's translation that I believe it should become the standard edition of Los de Abajo read in America. . . In short, this new translation is worthy of the classic on which it is based. I will certainly use it in my courses, but more to the point, I will recommend it to my colleagues teaching courses on English literature, Comparative literature, and American studies.\" —Roberto González Echevarría, Sterling Professor of Hispanic and Comparative Literatures, Yale University\n\nLearn More\n\nThis compact anthology—the second volume in Margaret L. King’s masterful introduction to the Western literary tradition—offers, in whole or in part, eighty key literary works of the eighteenth, nineteenth, and twentieth centuries. The texts provided here represent an unusually broad array of languages and traditions, ranging across a variety of genres such as verse, drama, philosophy, short- and long-form fiction, and non-fiction (including autobiography, speech, journalism, and essay). This second volume shares with the first a focus on works by women; numerous texts by Latin American writers are included here as well. King’s clear, engaging introductions and notes support an informed reading of the texts while extending students’ knowledge of particular authors and problems of interest. The Western Literary Tradition’s modest length and cost allow for the use of full-length works—many of which are available in Hackett Publishing’s own well-regarded and inexpensive translations and editions—alongside the anthology without adding undue cost to a student’s total textbook fees.\n\nSee the complete Table of Contents for volume 2 here (PDF).\n\nLearn More\n\n\"Thirty-Two Stories appears in an attractive and readable format, with the 1848 ‘Ultima Thule’ daguerrotype of Poe featured prominently on the front cover. Gone are the double-column pages, endnote style, and thematic organization of material that made the 1976 edition clumsy. Instructors and students will not have to battle with an arbitrary conceptual framework, since the stories in the new edition are presented in order of their first publication, and they will find the annotations more accessible at the bottom of the page. The typefaces are larger and bolder and many of the illustrations that graced the 1976 edition have been enlarged. . . . For college instructors and general readers interested in a fully annotated selection of Poe’s tales, attractively presented in a one-volume paperback edition, Thirty-Two Stories is the best thing on the market.”\n\n—Bruce I. Weiner, The Edgar Allan Poe Review\n\nLearn More\n\nMaude’s excellent translation of Tolstoy’s treatise on the emotionalist theory of art was the first unexpurgated version of the work to appear in any languages. More than ninety years later this work remains, as Vincent Tomas observed, “one of the most rigorous attacks on formalism and on the doctrine of art for art’s sake ever written.” Tomas’s Introduction makes this the edition of choice for students of aesthetics and anyone with philosophical interests.\n\nLearn More\n\n\"An impressive edition . . . the most thoroughly satisfying historical and literary contextualization for the novel that I've ever encountered. Shapiro and Barnard offer a rich transatlantic artistic and ideological context that helps pull the whole novel into coherent focus. The footnotes to the novel are incredibly thorough, helpful, and interesting. . . . This Hackett edition of Wieland [is] the freshest and most topical of those now available.\"\n\n—Dana D.
