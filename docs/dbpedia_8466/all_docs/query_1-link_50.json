        "text": "Over the past century or so, Tocqueville’s writings have proved to be a rich source of inspiration for political scientists, sociologists, philosophers, legal scholars, and historians. Politicians, too, including U.S. Presidents, have sometimes quoted him in their speeches. In spite of all this, Tocqueville continues to defy our black-and-white categories and generalizations and his writings still pose significant challenges to his interpreters. What were his “true” beliefs, many of us still wonder? Are the two volumes of Democracy in America parts of the same conceptual project, or are they, in fact, different books because of their different focus and content? What was the relation between Tocqueville's theoretical project and his political life? Did he really understand America, or was he only interested in France? And what might he have missed in America, in spite of the attention with which he analyzed the American democracy? The difficulty of answering these questions can be explained in light of Tocqueville’s highly ambitious intellectual and political agenda. This paper explores four key dimensions of Tocqueville's new science of politics and then focuses on his use of three key conceps (democracy, equality, and liberty/determinism).\n\nDemocracy is a revolutionary system because it regularizes the relationship between power and the community’s needs. If rulers establish this equilibrium, the people are provided with a secure and peaceful atmosphere in which to live. People have the freedom to choose in democratic societies. Educated and confident citizens elect representatives in the hopes that they will protect democratic values and encourage stability and peace. It is at this point that democracy’s drift can be observed. It is difficult for rulers to govern healthy individuals. Some prefer anti-democratic ways of governing, keeping their people frightened and hopeless. Controlling pessimistic people and giving them orders is easy for despots. However, despots prefer to be seen as democrats. They use the label of democracy to remain popular and obscure their anti-democratic practices. Today, the leaders of Russia, China, Uzbekistan, Turkey, Pakistan, and many other nations use the word “democracy” to define their governing methods. However, the definition of democracy does not change according to the ruler. If you silence the media, defraud democratic elections, block all kinds of opposition, and undermine the law, your system cannot be labeled a democracy. Perhaps such rulers can control pessimistic and hopeless people for a while, but the unavoidable end awaits, as it did for despots in the past. This is why the philosopher Alexis de Tocqueville continues to be important today. His warnings about and solutions to despotic attempts at ruling democracies shine a light on the dangerous tendencies of certain governing practices. His concept of “democratic despotism” was born from his comparative analysis of the United States (U.S.) and Europe. As a nobleman, he had the direct experience and intellectual capacity necessary to properly evaluate the effects of the revolution occuring in Europe. His journey to the U.S. in the 1830’s allowed him to devleop his theories on and fully understand the applicability of democracy. This study clarifies the concept of democratic despotism through an analysis of Tocqueville’s observations and a discussion of their impact on international security and stability. To achieve this, I first consider Tocqueville’s understanding of liberty, equality, and democracy. Second, I describe Tocqueville’s warnings regarding the path to despotism in new democracies. Then, I discuss his solutions and the various alternatives available for avoiding dangerous democratic tendencies. Finally, I analyze the impact of his thoughts on today’s international security and atmosphere of stability.\n\nOver the years, Alexis de Tocqueville's masterwork, Democracy in America, has been praised by politicians, scientists, and researchers as a brilliant analysis of modern democratic society. Observing American politics, society, and culture, Tocqueville's deep analysis has provided us a message which offers a political program for sustaining prosperous, stable, and free democratic societies. Today, this message becomes especially important and necessary for the democratic societies since today's problems are much more complicated, ambiguous, and unexpected than ever, and therefore it is more difficult to preserve and maintain democracy. In this regard, understanding what democracy means to Tocqueville, how he explains the social and historical origins of democracy, and how, according to him, democracy maintains itself becomes an inevitable task for today's democratic societies. This manuscript is an effort to search for plausible answers to these questions with a critical perspective to Tocqueville's understanding of democracy.\n\nWelcome to the \"Ways In\" section of this Macat analysis.

The first is universal democratisation, understood as a social phenomenon and a grand revolutionary change; the second sees revolution as the logical continuation and radicalisation of the preceding regime. The following question arises: was Tocqueville inconsistent in his principal works? I argue that this was not the case and that the two processes are complementary elements in Tocqueville’s model, which combines the ancient cyclical science of regime change with modern theories of revolutionary progress. What Tocqueville offers is a powerful political theory with considerable predictive power. Tocqueville, I consequently claim, should be viewed as a theorist of revolution rather than as a theorist of democracy per se."
