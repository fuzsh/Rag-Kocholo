Performance

Like the regular Samsung Galaxy S6, the Active variant packs the highly capable Exynos 7420 chipset. It's the first SoC to be built on a 14nm fabrication process (Snapdragon 810 is on 20nm), which should reduce power usage. That in turn reduces the dreaded thermal throttling that was a major issue in the Exynos vs. Snapdragon debate recently.

Exynos 7420 and Snapdragon 810 are not that different in terms of processor, both use a big.LITTLE setup with four Cortex-A57 cores at 2.1GHz and four Cortex-A53 cores at 1.5GHz. The GPU is a Mali-T760 from ARM and it shares 3GB of RAM with the processor.

The Galaxy S6 Active runs a 64-bit version of Android 5.0.2 and all eight of its cores are 64-bit capable. This is good for the future, but for now 32-bit apps run just fine - in fact, AnTuTu 5 offered both options. It returned equal scores in both 32-bit and 64-bit modes, matching the rest of the Galaxy S6 family, and crushing the Snapdragon opposition.

Looking at just the CPU performance at GeekBench 3, we see a massive advantage in multicore performance. The Snapdragon 810 runs its CPU cores a little slower (0.1GHz), but that's far too little to account for the difference. Basemark OS 2.0 confirms both the single-core and multi-core difference.

Samsung Galaxy S6 Active has a QHD screen - 1,440 x 2,560px. That's around 80% more pixels than a 1080p screen. Offscreen tests normalize resolution at 1080p so you can compare raw performance, while on-screen tests predict real-world gaming performance.

Basemark X considers only off-screen results and predictably gives the win to the Galaxy S6 Active.

For web browsing performance we used the Internet app (stock web browser), as Samsung sprinkles proprietary optimization magic that's not available in Chrome or the vanilla Android browser. Once again, Samsung Galaxy S6 Active proved worthy of its flagship pedigree.

There is no other way to cut it - Samsung Galaxy S6 Active is one of the most powerful smartphones you can buy at the moment. Like the regular Galaxy S6, the newcomer laughs at just about every benchmark test out there.
