Samsung has unveiled their latest flagship phone and it’s a big deal, No really! Let’s take a look at the features it has, if different, compared to the Samsung Galaxy S6 Edge:

Samsung Galaxy S6 Edge Samsung Galaxy S6 Edge+ Dimensions 142.1 x 70.1 x 7 mm 154.4 x 75.8 x 6.9 mm Screen size and type 5.1 inches, quad HD AMOLED 5.7 inches, quad HD AMOLED CPU Quad-core 1.5 GHz Cortex-A53 & Quad-core 2.1 GHz Cortex-A57 Quad-core 1.5 GHz Cortex-A53 & Quad-core 2.1 GHz Cortex-A57 Operating System Android OS, v5.0.2 (Lollipop), upgradable to v5.1.1 Android OS, v5.1.1 (Lollipop) Camera Rear: 16 MP with optical image stabilization, autofocus and LED flash.

Apart from the size, Clearly there aren’t too many differences, except the battery size in the S6 Edge+ is bigger by 400mAh, typical for a phablet like it.

The RAM in the S6 Edge+ is also bigger for increased storage and even though having the same CPU under the hood, we expect slightly faster performance on the Edge+.

The Samsung Galaxy S6 Edge+ is for the Android fanatic who wants a well-crafted device, fast functionality, all on a bigger screen.

The release of the device is being seen by most technology experts as a way for Samsung to secure a bite from the market share before rival Apple releases its iPhone 6S devices later this year.

Seeing as competition is now mostly between these two gadget makers, we can only wait for Apple’s reveal to see who does better marketwise.

With the price of the S6 Edge currently going for anywhere between K5-7000, we predict the bigger Samsung Galaxy S6 Edge+ to be in the K8000+ range. We’ll see…
