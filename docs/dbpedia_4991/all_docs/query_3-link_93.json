        "text": "Each benchmark score shown on this page is the median of all the results submitted by users for this device. For popular models, the median scores are calculated from thousands of benchmark results.\n\nSome people test their device under less than ideal conditions. For example, the device may be too hot or have other apps running in the background. These results tend to lower the average score, but we include them in the calculation because it provides a better indication of real-world performance. You may get a higher score when testing your own device under optimal conditions.\n\nThe battery life shown for a device is the median of all benchmark results for that model. Battery life is very sensitive to changes in screen brightness. While we recommending calibrating the screen brightness to 200 cd/m2 (nits) when testing battery life, this setting cannot be enforced by the benchmark app. As a result, the range of battery life scores submitted by the public is much wider than that seen when testing under controlled conditions.\n\nThe popularity rating is based on the total number of benchmark results submitted across all tests in the last 30 days. This page is updated daily."
