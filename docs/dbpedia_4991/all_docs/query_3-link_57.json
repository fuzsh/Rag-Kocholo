        "text": "This week Samsung launched the Galaxy S7 and in doing so the company did something remarkable: it listened to customers. The result is a phone which looks to combine the beauty of the Galaxy S6 with the practicality of the Galaxy S5. But did Samsung succeed and is the Galaxy S7 worth your hard earned cash? Let’s break it down…\n\nDesign - Added Style And Weight\n\nThe Galaxy S7 has largely stuck to the design language of the Galaxy S6 though it is narrower and the edges on the back have been rounded to make it more comfortable in hand. Interestingly Samsung has also made the Galaxy S7 slightly thicker and it is heavier than either of the previous two Galaxy models:\n\nGalaxy S7 - 142.4 x 69.6 x 7.9 mm (5.61 x 2.74 x 0.31 in) and 152 g (5.36 oz)\n\nGalaxy S6 - 143.3 x 70.8 x 6.9 mm (5.64 x 2.79 x 0.27 in) and 132 g (4.65 oz)\n\nGalaxy S5 - 142 x 72.5 x 8.1 mm (5.59 x 2.85 x 0.32 in) and 145 g (5.11 oz)\n\nThis increased weight shouldn’t be a deal breaker as it comes due to significant improvements to practicality (more of which next). Galaxy S6 owners will see little about the ongoing use of aluminium and glass to inspire them to upgrade, but owners of the famously plastic Galaxy S5 could be tempted given the dramatic increase in build quality from their model.\n\nDurability - The Toughest Galaxy Yet\n\nSo are the Galaxy S7’s practical improvements?\n\nFirstly Samsung has brought back the water resistance of the Galaxy S5 and upgraded it from IP67 to IP68 compliance. This means the Galaxy S7 is completely dust proof and can be fully submerged in up to 1.5m of water for up to an hour. This is great for avoiding accidental damage, using the phone in heavy rain or even taking it into the shower/bath if you want to control music to an external speaker or not miss an urgent phone call.\n\nThe Galaxy S7 also now uses Series 7000 aluminium in its chassis. Series 7000 is incredibly strong and means the phone won’t warp or bend without considerable force. Samsung has already used this aluminium in the Galaxy S6 Edge+, Galaxy Note 5 as has Apple with the iPhone 6S and iPhone 6S Plus. Galaxy S6 owners may find this added durability tempting, though the Galaxy S5 is already a one tough phone.\n\nDisplays - Improving on Great\n\nFor the last few years Samsung smartphone screens have been insanely great, dispelling their early problems with garish over saturated colours. And on first glance there doesn’t seem to be much in the Galaxy S7’s screen that should tempt potential S6 and S5 upgraders:\n\nGalaxy S7 - 5.1-inch, 2560 x 1440 pixels (577 ppi), Super AMOLED panel\n\nGalaxy S6 - 5.1-inch, 2560 x 1440 pixels (577 ppi), Super AMOLED panel\n\nGalaxy S5 - 5.1-inch, 1920 x 1080 pixels (432 ppi), Super AMOLED panel\n\nBut look more closely and Samsung has some tricks up its sleeve. Aside from promises that the Galaxy S7 panel is even brighter and more colour accurate than last year, the Galaxy S7 is the first Samsung phone to feature an Always On display.\n\nAs the name suggests this means the display is on at all times (in monochrome) even in standby and what is displayed - time, notifications, etc - is fully customisable. The feature consumes 1% battery life per hour and can be switched off for the battery conscious, but Galaxy S6 and Galaxy S5 owners who check their phones a lot will love it.\n\nNote: Always On won’t be coming to either the Galaxy S6 or S5 via software updates.\n\nWhere the Galaxy S7 doesn’t follow through is early rumours of a pressure sensitive touch display like 3D Touch on the iPhone 6S/6S Plus, but it is doubtful Samsung would leverage much developer support without it being baked into Android first. Note the Galaxy S7 also doesn’t get access to the ‘Edge UX’, which is reserved for the Edge range.\n\nNext page: Performance, Battery Life and a sensation new Camera...\n\nPerformance - Insanely Fast, On Paper\n\nEvery new smartphone generation brings promise of greater performance and the Galaxy S7 is no exception:\n\nGalaxy S7 – Qualcomm Snapdragon 820, Dual-core 2.15 GHz and 1.6 GHz CPUs and Adreno 530 GPU, 4GB RAM\n\nGalaxy S6 – Exynos 7420, Quad-core 21.GHz and 1.5GHz CPUs and Mali-T760 GPU, 3GB RAM\n\nGalaxy S5 – Qualcomm Snapdragon 801, Quad-core 2.5 GHz Krait 400 CPUs and Adreno 330 GPU, 2GB RAM\n\nThe Galaxy S7’s drop from quad core to dual core (two pairs of two processors instead of two pairs of four processors), may sound like a regression but Samsung claims the phone will deliver 30% improved CPU performance and a mighty 64% greater GPU (graphics) performance than the Galaxy S6. The extra RAM should also help with past multitasking problems in Galaxy phones.\n\nThe Galaxy S7’s drop from quad core to dual core (two pairs of two processors instead of two pairs of four processors), may sound like a regression but Samsung claims the phone will deliver 30% improved CPU performance and a mighty 64% greater GPU (graphics) performance than the Galaxy S6. The extra RAM should also help with past multitasking problems in Galaxy phones.\n\nBut how much of this will you really feel? The Galaxy S6 remains an incredibly fast phone and even the S5 is no slouch, so I wouldn’t find this to be the dominant reason to upgrade unless you are a serious gamer. In fact more important are the 820’s claims of greater battery efficiency (more next) and Samsung’s fitting of a heat pipe, which should keep the Galaxy S7 cooler in heavy use than its predecessors.\n\nNote: in its native South Korea Samsung will release the Galaxy S7 with its own Exynos chipset. Exynos has long been used by Samsung in home markets, but was used globally for the Galaxy S6. It is expected to deliver very similar performance to the Snapdragon 820. Samsung hasn’t revealed the reasons behind its strategy switch this year.\n\nBattery Life - A Return To Form\n\nAs mentioned, the Snapdragon 820 is a more efficient processor (particularly compared to the Snapdragon 801) but Samsung has also capitalised on this by addressing arguably the worst aspect of the Galaxy S6: battery life.\n\nGalaxy S7 – 3000 mAh capacity battery\n\nGalaxy S6 – 2550 mAh capacity battery\n\nGalaxy S5 – 2800 mAh capacity battery\n\nSamsung has yet to deliver any detailed battery life metrics for the Galaxy S7, but it does claim you can watch an entire season of Game of Thrones on a single charge (that’s around 10 hours of continuous video). Galaxy S6 owners will likely find the battery improvements to be one of the best reasons to upgrade, but Galaxy S5 owners already experience excellent battery life and retain a key differentiator.\n\nThat differentiator is a removable battery and, while the Galaxy S7 also brings the S6’s fast charging and wireless charging to the table, the Galaxy S5 remains alone in the range for being able to pop out its battery and swap in a new one - the fastest recharge capability of all.\n\nMeanwhile Samsung’s decision to stick with MicroUSB over its eventual successor, USB Type-C, will likely win approval in the short term. With rivals all seemingly switching their flagships to Type-C this year these feelings may change, but only time will tell. Certainly the Galaxy S8 will be a USB Type-C device.\n\nCamera - Another Giant Leap Forward\n\nWhere Samsung has arguably made the greatest strides in recent years is its smartphone camera technology. The Galaxy S5 has an excellent camera, the Galaxy S6 was a game changer that leapt ahead of Apple’s iPhones and now the Galaxy S7 may significantly up the stakes once again.\n\nGalaxy S7 – 12 megapixel Sony IMX260 F1.7 sensor, OIS, LED flash, 4K video. Front facing 5MP F1.7 camera, 1080p video\n\nGalaxy S6 – 16 megapixel Sony IMX240 F1.9 sensor, OIS, LED flash, 4K video. Front facing 5MP F1.9 camera, 1080p video\n\nGalaxy S5 – 16 megapixel Samsung ISOCELL F2.2 sensor, DIS, LED flash, 4k video. Front facing 2 MP F2.2 camera, 1080p video\n\nLooking at the megapixels alone may make the Galaxy S7 look like a downgrade, but far more important is the upgraded Sony IMX260 sensor and super fast F1.7 aperture (the fastest to date in a smartphone) which are far better at taking in light in poor photography conditions.\n\nPerhaps most interesting, however, is a feature Samsung calls ‘Dual Pixels’. All the pixels in the Galaxy S7 camera are used to help with focusing and it results in virtually instantaneous focusing even on moving subjects and in very low light. By contrast the brilliant Galaxy S6 used just 5% of its pixels this way, so we could have a truly stunning camera on our hands and one that Galaxy S5 users in particular may not be able to resist.\n\nAndroid Marshmallow and TouchWiz\n\nMy biggest complaint with Samsung phones is their excessive customisation of Android which impacts performance, wastes space with needless bloatware and delays software upgrades. But it isn’t going anywhere any time soon.\n\nThe good news is Samsung promises the Galaxy S7 will have the lightest implementation of TouchWiz yet with cleaner icons, reduced duplicate software and improved performance. It will also ship with TouchWiz built on Marshmallow, the latest version of Android. The Galaxy S6 is getting Marshmallow now (after a six month wait), but the Galaxy S5’s Marshmallow upgrade remains disappointingly MIA.\n\nYou can find a detailed breakdown of the best Android Marshmallow features here.\n\nNext page: Storage highs and lows, Pricing and Verdict...\n\nStorage And Value\n\nThese may seem strange categories to group together, but they are united because of one very good thing: the return of expandable storage.\n\nThe consequences for the Galaxy S7 here are significant. A user can buy the base 32GB model and add up to 200GB of storage cheapily via microSD (just be sure to use a Class 10 card or above so as not to impact performance). This will no doubt impact Samsung’s margins, but customers were desperately disappointed by its omission from the Galaxy S6. Meanwhile its return my tempt Galaxy S5 owners who have been holding out to make the move.\n\nThe is a downside, Samsung has pulled Android Marshmallow’s ‘Adaptive storage’. Adaptive Storage allows a device with a microSD slot to see its native and expanded storage as a single lump of storage which makes life simple (again stick to Class 10 cards), but if you remove the microSD card with the phone on you risk corrupting your data. As Samsung fitted the microSD expansion slot into the sim tray (as opposed to under the battery with the Galaxy S5) there’s greater risk of doing that.\n\nOn the plus there is good news in the retail prices themselves:\n\nGalaxy S7 32GB - €699/ $699, 64GB - €799/$799 (euro pricing always includes sales tax)\n\nThe Galaxy S7 is €50/$50 less than the launch price of equivalent models of the Galaxy S6\n\nAnd yet here is another potential controversy: Samsung has announced it has no plans to sell a model of the Galaxy S7 in the US with more than 32GB of storage. Yes, photos and video can be offloaded to the microSD card but TouchWiz and Samsung’s (circa 50) pre-installed apps leave just 25GB of storage free.\n\nGiven native storage is ‘the good stuff’ (Samsung’s UFS 2.0 is far faster than any expandable storage) that’s a bizarre move. Especially as flash is cheap and higher capacity 64GB and 128GB versions are more profitable (hence Apple’s upsell attempt with 16GB, 64GB and 128GB iPhone tiers). I hope Samsung will reverse this decision and, while it won’t affect everyone, it could prove in combination with the loss of Adaptive Storage an unnecessary deal breaker for some users.\n\nExternal Speaker - Still Disappointing\n\nWhile not the end of the world, no Galaxy S discussion is complete without touching on the external speaker. While many rivals (Apple aside) have moved to front firing stereo speakers, Samsung still releases its flagship devices will a single mono speaker on the bottom edge.\n\nThe Galaxy S7 slightly improves this by upping the output to 1.2W, but it still remains a disappointment. Strong external speakers are particularly useful for calls, podcasts, audiobooks and showing off content and when they are front mounted you don’t accidentally cover them as you do with a speaker on the bottom edge.\n\nAdd this to the Galaxy S8 wishlist.\n\nEarly Verdict\n\nI’m impressed by the Galaxy S7. The Galaxy S5 sacrificed style for practicality and the Galaxy S6 sacrificed practicality for style. Now, for the first time in years, a Galaxy will go on sale which seems to have a smart blend of both.\n\nIt isn’t perfect. I (though I recognise not everyone) would have liked to see Samsung embrace USB Type-C, limited sales to a 32GB is shortsighted (and will surely be changed). I also still hold out hope for the return of a removable battery, front firing speakers and stock Android, all of which are likely to remain pipe dreams.\n\nThat said I can’t see upgraders from the Galaxy S5 or even the Galaxy S6 being disappointed. Flaws aside, the Galaxy S7 might be the more well rounded smartphone released this year.\n\nCritics will say the Galaxy S7 is the device Samsung should’ve made last year and they are right, but I can’t hide my delight that the device everyone wanted then is here now.\n\n___\n\nFollow Gordon on Twitter, Facebook and Google+\n\nMore On Forbes\n\nSamsung Galaxy S7 Vs Galaxy S7 Edge: What's The Difference?\n\nNexus 6P Review: Google Outshines Galaxy S6 And iPhone 6S\n\nBlackBerry Priv Review: Impressive, Tragic Comeback"
