        "text": "Some people prefer practical tools. Others would gladly buy gadgets dipped in gold. In a nutshell, thatâs the choice between the new Galaxy Note 5 and the Galaxy S6 Edge+. Theyâre two sides of the same coin. Theyâre both cutting-edge phones. The question is whether youâre willing to sacrifice comfort to make peopleâs heads turn.\n\nGalaxy S6 Edge (left) vs Galaxy S6 Edge+ (right).\n\nWhat Is It?\n\nThe fourth version of Samsungâs latest and greatest Android smartphone, the Galaxy S6. The S6 Edge+ is the version with a large 5.7-inch curved glass screen that positively seems to melt around the smartphoneâs edges. You can think of it as a larger version of the Galaxy S6 Edge, which did the same exact thing with a smaller 5.1-inch screen. Or, like me, you can think of it as a Galaxy Note 5 without a stylus and a screen facing the wrong way.\n\nhttps://gizmodo.com/samsung-galaxy-note-5-review-the-best-android-phone-th-1726228849\n\nEither way, weâre talking about a smartphone with top-notch specs. Specs which the S6, S6 Edge, S6 Edge+, and Note 5 all happen to share: a gorgeous 2560 x 1440 Super AMOLED display, a powerful 8-core Exynos processor, two forms of wireless charging and one of the best cameras you can get in a smartphone, all wrapped up in a stylish glass and aluminum body. You should be able to find it on all major US carriers for around $750 or so.\n\nDesign\n\nPremium. Eye-catching. Breathtaking, if youâre the kind of person who easily runs out of breath. This is the most attention-grabbing phone you can buy. The metal and glass surfaces positively gleam. The screen is gorgeous, one of the best ever made, even before you consider its futuristic curve. The glass back even does a decent job of hiding my disgustingly greasy fingerprints at most view angles. Buttons feel precise and accurate. The fingerprint sensor works like a charm. I constantly feel like Iâm going to drop this phone.\n\nAll of which could also describe the smaller Galaxy S6 Edge… but big makes a difference. Not only can you brag about how your phone looks, but also its raw size. Which, Iâve come to understand, is pretty important when youâre buying a phone for the bragging rights.\n\nThe Best Part\n\nYou donât have sacrifice a single one of the Galaxy S6 / S6 Edge / Note 5âs cutting edge specs to get the bragging rights you crave. This isnât like buying a Gucci or Prada phone where you know youâre getting something flashy but technologically inferior. As far as I can tell, every single feature is intact, and a few are even improved: the S6 Edge+ charges even a little bit faster than the S6 and S6 Edge, and the camera app now supports RAW images and manual shutter speed adjustment too.\n\nIâd easily call that camera the #1 reason to buy any one of Samsungâs four new flagship phones. I can launch the camera and take a picture faster than practically any other smartphone on the market by just double-tapping the home buttonâwhether the phoneâs locked or notâand thanks to optical image stabilization, wicked fast autofocus and real-time HDR (high dynamic range) the pictures look great almost every time I hit the shutter button.\n\nLast year, when I reviewed the iPhone 6 Plus, I was blown away by how consistently I could take great shots and clips due to the same tech. I canât say if the Galaxy S6 Edge+ does it better without a lot more testing, but it definitely launches faster and that means fewer missed photo opportunities.\n\nHere are a few unedited sample pics:\n\nThe Tragic Flaw\n\nThis phone is SO DAMN AWKWARD to hold. When we reviewed the original Galaxy S6 Edge, we basically dismissed it right away because the regular flat S6 felt so much better in the hands. Well, making it bigger and heavier sure didnât make it any less awkward! Iâve never nearly dropped a phone so many times, or made so many mistakes while navigating a smartphone interface simply for lack of a good place to grip. Because there really isnât any good way to hold this blasted thing.\n\nI tried using one hand. Nearly every time I reached across the screen, the fleshy part of the base of my thumb would hit the multitasking button and pull me out of what I was doing.\n\nWhat about two hands? Well, just take a look at the bottom edge of the smartphone. You canât touch the glass for fear of accidentally activating something. But you also canât place a finger or thumb on the flat front surfaces there, because thereâs a nice big home button you donât want to accidentally press, and two invisible capacitive touch buttons flanking it. You also canât wrap a finger around the bottom of the phone, as I often found myself doing, without covering the speaker holes. So youâve gotta grip the phone by those tiny metal edges.\n\nMovies, games, and photo sessions arenât particularly comfortable with this handset.\n\nTest Notes\n\nBattery life is pretty solid, but the S6 Edge+ can definitely die prematurely if you run it hard. I make it to bedtime most days with 15 percent left, but I also had it die at 5PM when I used it with an Android Wear smartwatch andâfor a couple hoursâas a mobile hotspot. On another day, a couple quick 10-minute turn-by-turn GPS sessions ate up 30 percent of the battery.\n\nThe power saving mode is dumb. It makes the screen so dim I canât even read it.\n\nSamsungâs autocorrect is pretty dumb too. Way worse than the stock Google keyboard. Also, the swipe keyboard is turned off by default. For faster typing, youâll probably want to turn it on.\n\nIn general, though Samsungâs TouchWiz skin is lighter than ever, thereâs still tons of unnecessary Samsung apps and tweaks I donât care for.\n\nOne TouchWiz thing I enjoy: split-screen and picture-in-picture multitasking. I just wish it worked with all Android apps instead of a handful.\n\nQuick charging is so amazingly quick on this phone. If you forget to plug it in overnight, just charge it while you shower and youâll be good for most of the day. Then you can top it off with any normal microUSB charger or some wireless charging.\n\nThereâs still no good use for the curved screen. Thereâs an alarm clock, stock and news tickers you can view when the screen is off, but why do those things need a curve? You can also quick-dial your favorite numbers and quick-launch your favorite apps by swiping in from the edge, but itâs no quicker than a shortcut on a homescreen.\n\nSome things just look weird when theyâre a little bit curved by the screen. Like when Iâm playing Hearthstone and my digital playing cards are clearly bent when theyâre supposed to be flat.\n\nAnother thing that looks weird: the metal seam at the top and bottom of the device. The original S6 Edge didnât have that.\n\nShould You Buy It?\n\nThat all depends on you, my friend. I couldnât possibly imagine purchasing a gigantic phone thatâs so difficult to holdânot when the Note 5, Galaxy S6 and even the Galaxy S6 Edge are practically identical and so much more comfortable to use. Iâm also not sure Iâm down with the S6 Edge+âs $750-ish price, now that Iâd have to pay that out of pocket at most cellular carriers.\n\nBut occasionally, I stare deep into that gorgeous curved screen and wonder what it might be like to be wealthy, and to care about showing off that wealth. To not worry about dropping phones. Because this phone is clearly destined to be a status symbol. The fact that itâs so obviously the wrong choice compared to an S6 or a Note 5 will make it that much more exclusive. And that much more desirable to the right person."
