Surely I thought it would be more cost effective to just buy and supply one processor like all the other manufacturers do. This is one of the reasons I am not buying the S7. I really would have liked the Snapdragon 820 with the latest Qualcomm quick charge 3.0. Does anyone know why Samsung persists with this?\n\nAlso, I have done some research on 8 core vs 4 core processors. And all the sites say the same thing. 8 core is nonsense and is of no value as the majority of Andorid apps are designed to utilise actually 1 or 2 cores only. Even Qualcomm went from 8 cores in their 810 processor to back to 4 in their latest 820.\n\nI was wondering what is the rationale for the Galaxy series having 2 processors?

One of the few snapdragon processors not to have one. The s800, 801, 805,and 820 all had integrated baseband processors\n\nThat's odd. This is an old thread but I want answers. I have a Galaxy Note 5\n\nSAMSUNG-SM-N920V on Verizon and it is listed as a phone with a snapdragon. I'm more into PC hardware and android software so can you give me a reason to why Verizon purchased models with lesser CPUs? My phone is still fast and in good condition (other than the completely busted camera) but I just want to know why."
