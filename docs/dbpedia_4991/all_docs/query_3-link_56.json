        "text": "Samsung threw us for a loop when it officially announced the Galaxy Tab S6 Lite (2024) refresh, not just because the company decided to re-release a 2020 tablet a second time but also due to a lack of concrete information in some areas.\n\nAs some might know, the Galaxy Tab S6 Lite (2024) showed up in Geekbench a couple of months ago, where it rocked an Exynos 1280 chip with eight CPU cores split into 2+6 core clusters.\n\nAll was clear until Samsung officially announced the tablet and mentioned a Quad-core 2.4GHz + Quad-core 2.0GHz CPU configuration, which suggested that the Galaxy Tab S6 Lite (2024) refresh might be powered by the superior Exynos 1380 chip.\n\nHere's what chip the Galaxy Tab S6 Lite actually has\n\nIn case you're still wondering, the mystery of the unknown Exynos chip has been cleared up by MyNextTablet, who confirmed that the Galaxy Tab S6 Lite (2024) is enabled by the inferior Exynos 1280 chip rather than the Exynos 1380 SoC.\n\nTherefore, the Galaxy Tab S6 Lite (2024) has two Cortex-A78 CPU cores operating at a frequency of up to 2.4GHz and six ARM Cortex-A55 cores @2.0GHz.\n\nDisappointingly, the Galaxy Tab S6 Lite (2024) isn't as powerful as Samsung made us hope it would be, but on the bright side, it is at least more competent than its 2020 and 2022 predecessors.\n\nBenchmark tests show that the Galaxy Tab S6 Lite (2024) outperforms the 2022 and 2020 models in Geekbench 5 across the board, in Compute, Single-Core, and Multi-Core tests.\n\nAppropriately, the 2024 Lite model is also more powerful than the cheaper Galaxy Tab A9+ (Snapdragon 695) but not as beefy as the Galaxy Tab S9 FE, the latter of which does make use of the newer Exynos 1380 SoC.\n\nAll in all, Samsung getting the information wrong on its official spec sheet kind of fits the theme of low effort surrounding this whole Tab S6 Lite (2024) release. Hopefully, nobody bought the Tab S6 Lite based solely on Samsung's spec sheet and erroneous CPU core information."
