        "text": "Designers were at a crossroad as drastic measures had to be taken in order to change the visual identity. Most of you know what happened next, but for those of you that don’t, Samsung released the two best looking phones they ever made; Galaxy S6 and S6 Edge. Shortly afterwards we received the third iteration in the form of S6 Edge+ sporting a slightly larger screen and some additional features.\n\nLike its siblings, S6 Edge+ comes with a gorgeous metal design representing a huge departure from their previous efforts. Old Samsungs weren’t ugly by any means, but they weren’t inspiring either. Designed with simplicity and quality in mind, they failed to provoke an emotional reaction leading to spontaneous purchases. The new models however take an entirely different approach by sporting an unbelievably good-looking chassis mated to a curved screen on both edges.\n\nWords simply fail to describe how monumental the change is, especially on a large device such as S6 Edge+. Hinted by the name, S6 Edge+ is truly a plus sized device sporting dimensions of 154.4 x 75.8 x 6.9 mm and weighing in at 153 grams. Nonetheless, it is a very comfortable smartphone designed primarily for two-handed use.In terms of display, Samsung decided to use only the finest components thereby opting for a 5.7 inch AMOLED display producing a resolution of 1440 x 2560 pixels resulting in a density of 518ppi. Once you spend some time with it, there simply isn’t going back. Colors are so wonderfully rich, they make an everlasting impression.\n\nWhether you’re watching multimedia or playing games, S6 Edge+ over-delivers in every single area. It might take a moment or two getting used to curved edges, but once you do, get ready for an unforgettable experience.\n\nPowering Galaxy S6 Edge Plus is Samsung’s own Exynos 7420 merging together a quad-core 1.5 GHz Cortex-A53 and a quad-core 2.1 GHz Cortex-A57. We’ve seen a lot of ARM big.LITTLE chipsets where the smaller CPU powers simple tasks like web browsing while the more powerful core deals with intensive tasks such as gaming. The clear advantage is better power efficiency combined with lower heat emissions. On the software side, Edge+ uses Android 5.1.1. overlaid with Samsung’s revamped TouchWiz. Unlike before, they dealt away with unnecessary bloatware leaving only a few decent apps such as S Health, Smart Manager and SideSync. SideSync is one of our favorites since it allows mirroring a phone’s screen on any computer including Macs.\n\nThis eliminates the need to constantly check on your phone significantly improving productivity. One thing we don’t like about the new Samsungs is the fact that microSD slots have been removed, leaving you to choose between 32 or 64 gigabyte on-board memory.\n\nWorth mentioning is the fact that it comes with a colossal 4GB of DDR4 RAM future-proofing you for a long long time. Imaging-wise, S6 Edge+ sports the same spectacular camera setup as its siblings with an ultra-fast 16-megapixel main camera and a 5-megapixel front camera. There are plenty of settings to explore or you can just use the auto mode for excellent photos in any environment.\n\nGalaxy S6 Edge+ is a brilliant phone in many ways aimed primarily at users looking for more screen space and unrivaled performance. Seeing that Galaxy Note 5 won’t be coming to European markets, S6 Edge+ is a worthy replacement for those who haven’t developed a fondness for the S Pen. Those who did will have to readjust slightly, but it’s definitely going to be worth it!"
