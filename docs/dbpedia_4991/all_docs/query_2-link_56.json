        "text": "Especificações do Portátil\n\nPrice comparison\n\npreço: 76%, desempenho: 86%, características: 83%, pantalha: 90% mobilidade: 80%, processamento: 90%, ergonomia: 91%, emissões: 94%\n\nAnálises para o Samsung Galaxy S6 Edge+\n\nSamsung Galaxy S7 edge vs Samsung Galaxy S6 edge+\n\nOrigem: Phone Arena EN→PT Archive.org version\n\nThe Galaxy S7 edge and the Galaxy S6 edge+ are impressive showcases of Samsung's technological proficiency, displaying quality design and containing some of the best mobile hardware money can buy in 2016. Without question, both devices have the style and the guts to defend Samsung's enviable smartphone market share for another year.\n\nComparação, Disponível online, Longa, Data: 03/14/2016\n\nSamsung Galaxy S6 Edge+ vs. Apple iPhone 6s plus.\n\nOrigem: On MSFT EN→PT Archive.org version\n\nOur latest infographic provides you with an at-a-glance comparison of their latest models, the Samsung Galaxy S6 Edge+ and the Apple iPhone 6S plus. We hope this Infographic will help you decide which Smartphone is the right one for you!\n\ninfographic review\n\nComparação, Disponível online, Muito curta, Data: 02/02/2016\n\nSamsung Galaxy S6 edge+ review – big, powerful and sleek\n\nOrigem: Laptop Media EN→PT Archive.org version\n\nSamsung Galaxy S6 edge+ met all of our expectations, despite the lack of microSD memory card slot and waterproof certificate, which were both present in last year’s Galaxy flagship. The phone’s capabilities grant a spot among the top models currently on the market. The first thing that makes an impression is the curved on both sides display, which is both attractive and delivers tons of features. The SoC of the device, Exynos 7420, provides more graphic and computing performance than you may need. Apparently it is power-efficient enough, because we’re more than satisfied from the phone’s battery life, since it got good results in our battery tests, despite the 5.7-inch Super AMOLED screen. Speaking of, it has all the properties a top-tier smartphone should have. Furthermore, the outer temperatures of the device remain low even after heavy load, meaning the device will be pleasant to touch regardless of the duration of usage.\n\nAnálise única, Disponível online, Muito curta, Data: 11/14/2015\n\nA close call in this phablet battle\n\nOrigem: Tech Advisor EN→PT Archive.org version\n\nOur comparisons are written to help you decide which to buy rather than declare one an outright winner. In this comparison, it's clear that the Nexus 6P is better value with 128GB on offer for less than the 32GB Edge+ and with no Micro-SD card slot this is a big deal. It also has an 8Mp front camera, USB Type-C and the latest Android. However, Samsung's phone is arguably more stylish, is more manageable, has a better rear camera and has wireless charging.\n\nComparação, Disponível online, Curta, Data: 11/02/2015\n\nApple iPhone 6s Plus vs Samsung Galaxy S6 edge+\n\nOrigem: Phone Arena EN→PT Archive.org version\n\nThe longer we think about it, the clearer it seems that the race between Android and iOS, Samsung and Apple, the Galaxy and the iPhone is now the closest it’s ever been. Samsung deserves praise here: it is the one that has made big leaps in design, camera, battery life and charging, screen quality and even ease of use with the cleaner TouchWiz.\n\nComparação, Disponível online, Longa, Data: 10/20/2015\n\nApple iPhone 6s Plus vs. Samsung Galaxy S6 edge+\n\nOrigem: GSM Arena EN→PT Archive.org version\n\nFunny, the iPhone 6s Plus and the Samsung Galaxy S6 edge+ are probably two of the best phones to get right now. Two amazing pieces of technology but pretty much incapable of changing anyone's mind. Both devices are really trying: Samsung is no longer putting function before aesthetics and has given up traditional advantages such as memory expansion and a removable battery. Apple too has broken a long-standing taboo - large screens.\n\nComparação, Disponível online, Muito longa, Data: 10/15/2015\n\nApple iPhone 6s Plus vs. Samsung Galaxy S6 edge+\n\nOrigem: GSM Arena EN→PT Archive.org version\n\nFinally, on the 4K video test the iPhone 6s Plus is in disadvantage as it has a forced software stabilization all the time and thus it has a narrower field of view. The Galaxy's video has more detail while still capturing more objects in the frame, which made if a favorite among 81% of our readers.\n\nComparação, Disponível online, Média, Data: 10/14/2015\n\nThe Samsung Galaxy Note5 and Galaxy S6 edge+\n\nOrigem: AnandTech EN→PT Archive.org version\n\nThe Galaxy Note5 is a bit of a break in form for Samsung, but in some ways it represents a return to form. To understand what this means, we can look at the various aspects that make up the Galaxy Note5 in contrast to the Galaxy S6. One of the easier places to start is the design, which shares a great deal in common with the Galaxy S6.\n\nComparação, Disponível online, Longa, Data: 10/02/2015\n\nSamsung Galaxy S6 edge+ vs LG G4\n\nOrigem: Phone Arena EN→PT Archive.org version\n\nOur review must have made the following things pretty clear by now. Both the Galaxy S6 edge+ and the LG G4 have very good designs, but whereas the former is purely a showpiece, the latter is more practical with its removable battery and microSD card slot. The display on the Samsung phablet has a more natural look with its color accuracy, but LG's doesn't look bad either. And still, both are bragging material with their excellent minimum and maximum brightness levels. Also, the S6 edge+ and the G4 boast mature, streamlined user interfaces that have been set on path of improvement, with both having plenty of potential to get even better.\n\nComparação, Disponível online, Muito longa, Data: 09/17/2015\n\nThe edge of reason\n\nOrigem: Pocket Lint EN→PT Archive.org version\n\nAs the big brother to the already excellent S6 edge, the edge+ gets off to a flying start, showing off visual design flair like no other. But in this larger form we're a little less convinced by the screen curves, due to vignetting and reflections from its glossy exterior. The lack of microSD will continue to frustrate too, especially when considering the 64GB model's eye-watering £829 price tag. And, yes, those curved edges might be pushing the edge of reason, but by pushing beyond the traditional design bounds the edge+ is a show-off phone on a grand scale.\n\nAnálise única, Disponível online, Curta, Data: 09/09/2015\n\nSamsung Galaxy S6 edge+ review: Beauty and power\n\nOrigem: Gizmag EN→PT Archive.org version\n\nOur best advice is to play around with the Note 5 in a store. If you think you'll use the S Pen at all, then go with the Note. If you have no interest in a stylus, and don't mind throwing down an extra $75, go with the better-looking, lighter and thinner S6 edge+. No matter which way you go, though, you're getting a flipping outstanding smartphone. Big, beautiful, powerful and premium.\n\nAnálise única, Disponível online, Muito curta, Data: 08/29/2015\n\nSamsung Galaxy S6 edge+ review\n\nOrigem: GSM Arena EN→PT Archive.org version\n\nSamsung Galaxy S6 edge+ performed just as we expected. And yes, the Note5 which we reviewed before that was like a huge spoiler for what the expect as the two are so alike. Both are gorgeous to look at, superbly crafted, and incredibly capable in terms of hardware. Unlike the Galaxy Note5 however, which is defined by its S Pen and top notch productivity credentials, the Samsung Galaxy S6 edge+ is all about that curved display and unique eye-grabbing design. Thanks to the bigger size of its screen, the newcomer is an even bigger attention grabber than the original Galaxy S6 edge.\n\nAnálise única, Disponível online, Muito longa, Data: 08/28/2015\n\nSamsung Galaxy S6 edge+ vs Apple iPhone 6 Plus\n\nOrigem: Phone Arena EN→PT Archive.org version\n\nIf you ask us, the Galaxy S6 edge+ has everything — everything save for iOS, that is — to account for a dent in Apple's quarterly report. It also has a superior screen, longer battery life, and a striking, innovative design. In other words, the S6 edge+ is plain cool — just like the iPhone has always been. Depends on taste, we guess. Regardless, we'll be watching the oversized S6 edge's market performance with a genuine interest. We're also curious about your opinion on which device makes for a better all-around phablet. Give it a run!\n\nComparação, Disponível online, Longa, Data: 08/28/2015\n\nSamsung Galaxy S6 edge+ vs Google Nexus 6\n\nOrigem: Phone Arena EN→PT Archive.org version\n\nIt’s hard to get used to the crazy pace of innovation in the mobile space with so many new devices, but comparing the Galaxy S6 edge+ with the nearly year-old Nexus 6, the pace of innovation can be clearly felt. And we’re not talking just about the cool-looking edge screen - we consider this a neat little touch that required some serious display innovation, but its hard to say that it brings a ground-breaking change in usage. No, we’re talking about overall design and performance: the S6 edge+ has a much faster and consistently great camera, a significantly better, brighter and more power efficient AMOLED display, neat wireless charging option, a hugely improved thin and stylish design, a fast and reliable fingerprint scanner with the option for future use with Samsung Pay, and the list just goes on.\n\nComparação, Disponível online, Longa, Data: 08/27/2015\n\nSamsung Galaxy S6 Edge+ Review\n\nOrigem: Droid-Life EN→PT Archive.org version\n\nIn the end, you have an ultra-premium smartphone package that has few downsides. It looks great, has a top tier camera, and may use the best smartphone display ever. For some, those things are enough. For others, maybe a more traditional phone is the better option. I know where I fall.\n\nAnálise única, Disponível online, Média, Data: 08/27/2015\n\nSamsung Galaxy Note5 vs Samsung Galaxy S6 edge+\n\nOrigem: Phone Arena EN→PT Archive.org version\n\nRather than going into detail about their pricing, we’ll just generalize it by saying that the Galaxy S6 edge+ carries a higher premium than the Note5. There might not be a huge disparity when breaking down their pricing on a fixed, monthly financing plan, but it’s undeniably profound when we look at their outright costs. In fact, the Galaxy S6 edge+, depending on which carrier you buy it from, is normally accompanied with an $80 increase over the Note5. Again, it’ll be different for each carrier, but that’s the cost we’re roughly looking at here.\n\nComparação, Disponível online, Longa, Data: 08/26/2015\n\nSamsung Galaxy S6 edge+ Review\n\nOrigem: Slashgear EN→PT Archive.org version\n\nPersonally, I think the biggest competition comes from within Samsung's own house. The Galaxy Note 5 may not have the fancy curves, but it does get the excellent S Pen, more flexible software, and a slightly smaller price. Your decision, then, comes down to the respective values you place on design versus usability: I love how Samsung pushes the envelope in hardware, but I can't help but wish the company had a better idea of what to actually do with it.\n\nAnálise única, Disponível online, Curta, Data: 08/26/2015\n\nSamsung Galaxy S6 edge+ vs Samsung Galaxy S6 edge\n\nOrigem: Phone Arena EN→PT Archive.org version\n\nThe Galaxy S6 edge+ can be considered simply an S6 edge with a bigger screen, right? Well, our thorough comparison showed that this statement is true only to an extent. The larger, 5.7” display makes a world of difference when it comes to browsing, watching videos, and even perusing the extra features of the interactive side edges of the two flexible display phones.\n\nComparação, Disponível online, Longa, Data: 08/26/2015\n\nSamsung Galaxy S6 Edge+: First Impressions\n\nOrigem: NDTV Gadgets EN→PT Archive.org version\n\nThe biggest competitor to the Galaxy S6 Edge+ will be the Galaxy S6 Edge, which can be bought from various stores for as little as Rs. 48,500. It remains to be seen whether Samsung will phase out the Galaxy S6 Edge now that the Galaxy S6 Edge+ has arrived. The Apple iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus are also available at lower prices than the Galaxy S6 Edge+ which could give it a tough time in the Indian market.\n\nAnálise única, Disponível online, Muito curta, Data: 08/20/2015\n\nSamsung Galaxy S6 Edge+ review: Hands-on with the even bigger curved screen phone\n\nOrigem: Tech Advisor EN→PT Archive.org version\n\nAt £700 the Galaxy S6 Edge+ is a seriously expensive phone, and we were happy enough with the size of the regular model. If you do want a larger version then great and the increased memory and bigger battery are nice upgrades. However, the IR blaster is gone and the functionality of the edge screen is still gimmicky. Check back for a final verdict soon.\n\nAnálise única, Disponível online, Curta, Data: 08/14/2015\n\nSamsung Galaxy Note5 and S6 edge+ hands-on\n\nOrigem: GSM Arena EN→PT Archive.org version\n\nWhen we said Samsung rushed the launch of the Galaxy Note5, you may have thought it was somehow unfinished. It certainly doesn't appear to be so at this point, instead it's the carefully thought out upgrade we're used to seeing from Samsung. Sure, it has lost a few of its productivity features, and we'll be hearing a lot about its battery. The comments section was barely beginning to accept that it won't be user-replaceable, as the rumored 4,100mAh capacity was enough to shake battery anxiety away.
