I wanted to try the Active because of the ruggedized build, as I was tired of always feeling like I had to baby the Note 5. I work in aircraft maintenance so I put this phone through the paces pretty much on a daily basis. Don't get me wrong, I still take good care of the phone but now I'm not so paranoid about it taking a tumble or accidentally getting wet. Another great feature is the battery life. I consider myself a fairly heavy user and I'm normally in the ballpark of 35-50% battery life when I call it a day. I kept a charger in my bag for the Note 5, but in the few months I've had the Active I haven't used it other than to loan it to coworkers. The display is great, it is really sharp and colors are vibrant. I haven't had any issues with the display in direct sun or while using it in a dark room. The speaker is plenty loud and clear except for maybe when the phone volume is all the way up. I've had no issues with call volume and calls are clear and loud enough to hear even in noisier environments. I dont keep a case on my Active, though i probably should. I do however keep a Zagg glass screen protector on it. Ive dropped the phone onto concrete from a few feet. It was accidentally knocked off my toolbox at work by a coworker and other than some light scratches on the corners it's no worse for the wear. I have not tested its water resistance and do not plan to test it intentionally anyway. I really haven't found a downside to the Active yet after a few months of owning it. It's a great phone that should be considered by those who are in the market for a durable and highly capable device.\n\n10\n\nBuild quality\n\n10\n\nCamera quality\n\n10\n\nPerformance\n\n10\n\nDisplay\n\n10\n\nBattery life and charging\n\nWhat I like\n\nSturdy and well built.\n\nGreat display\n\nAwesome battery life\n\nIP68 rating\n\nLarge enough to enjoy the screen but small enough to carry and use comfortably\n\nDid you find this review helpful?\n\nHelpful\n\nUnhelpful\n\nSpam\n\nNot English content\n\nBad language\n\nOther\n\nReport\n\nReport\n\nBe the first one to vote.\n\nEdit Review\n\nRead Full Review\n\nBeaustir45\n\nArena Apprentice\n\n10\n\nLove it, why AT&T doesn't advertise this phone more puzzles me!\n\nPhone owned for less than 3 months\n\nI love this phone.\n\nI can say that the only thing that holds this phone back in the slightest is touchwiz. It still feels clunky and not that good looking(i don't like the green).\n\nThe camera is great in almost any light situation.\n\nThe battery is great now that I've had the phone for a while now. I usually get to the end of the day with at least 40% or more left and I feel like I am a moderate to light heavy phone user.\n\nThe earpiece is really loud and the speaker on it can get tinny at the top of the volume, but just hit down once and it sounds great and is very loud.\n\nThe display is amazing and can be really bright and really dark whenever you need it to.\n\nDon't really have many cons besides the fact that it's an AT&T exclusive, but I'm on AT&T anyway. Also, the side buttons are quite touchy, so I do active them a lot putting my phone in my pocket and getting it out.\n\n10\n\nBuild quality\n\n10\n\nCamera quality\n\n8\n\nPerformance\n\n10\n\nDisplay\n\n10\n\nBattery life and charging\n\nWhat I like\n\nPhysical buttons all around, including home and back buttons\n\nBig Screen\n\nWaterproof\n\nWhat I don't like\n\nTouchy Side Buttons\n\nDid you find this review helpful?\n\nHelpful\n\nUnhelpful\n\nSpam\n\nNot English content\n\nBad language\n\nOther\n\nReport\n\nReport\n\n4 out of 4 people found this helpful.\n\nEdit Review\n\nRead Full Review\n\nFCC OKs Cingular\\'s purchase of AT&T Wireless"
