I got used to android. It is OK. What I miss are high quality apps from WP. Apps in microsoft store are much better - Visualy, and they work better with the phone. Even my bank apps, that is not some low end app, is better for WP.\n\nBut all this, has nothing to do with the phone itself.\n\nPhone is nice. It feels decent, and works decent. I don't mind having it, even though it doesn't blow my mind.\n\n9\n\nBuild quality\n\n6\n\nCamera quality\n\n9\n\nPerformance\n\n10\n\nDisplay\n\n8\n\nBattery life and charging\n\nWhat I like\n\nDisplay\n\nMultimedia\n\nEveryday usage\n\nBuild quality\n\nSmart dial\n\nFingerprint scan\n\nWhat I don't like\n\nCamera\n\nBattery\n\nDid you find this review helpful?\n\nHelpful\n\nUnhelpful\n\nSpam\n\nNot English content\n\nBad language\n\nOther\n\nReport\n\nReport\n\nBe the first one to vote.\n\nEdit Review\n\nRead Full Review\n\n6\n\nTerrible. More trouble than it's worth.\n\nPhone owned for more than a year\n\nI had the Galaxy s4 before this and loved it. Never had an issue with it. The s6, on the other hand, has been nothing but trouble. I've had to replace it at least 4 times due to \"manufacturer defect\". The first time was because it kept freezing whenever I would open and use certain apps. The second time was because it would constantly tell me I had no 4G service when I knew I was in an area that I always had service and would constantly disconnect from WiFi for no reason. The third time was because it would freeze up randomly and restart itself. The fourth time was because the battery would go down ridiculously fast even in power saver mode and I couldn't use it while it was charging or the battery would continue to go down. Even though I was always conscious of not overcharging it and would rarely leave it on the charger past 100% or overnight (only did a few times on accident). I'm sure my cell phone carrier keeps giving me refurbished replacements that aren't actually fully fixed. Also all my pictures tend to be way lower quality than I expected of this phone especially when using zoom. This phone has been nothing but frustration for me. I constantly have issues with people not being able to hear me clearly on calls. However, I will say that I have dropped it many times and have never even scratched my screen and I have a very simple case on it.\n\n10\n\nBuild quality\n\n2\n\nCamera quality\n\n4\n\nPerformance\n\n8\n\nDisplay\n\n2\n\nBattery life and charging\n\nWhat I like\n\nStrong screen, hard to break\n\nHigh quality display\n\nMemory\n\nWhat I don't like\n\nBattery great at first but quickly deteriorates\n\nCamera quality\n\nCall quality\n\nRunning multiple apps slows it down extremely\n\nNo removable memory card\n\nNo removable battery\n\nDid you find this review helpful?\n\nHelpful\n\nUnhelpful\n\nSpam\n\nNot English content\n\nBad language\n\nOther\n\nReport\n\nReport\n\nBe the first one to vote.\n\nEdit Review\n\nRead Full Review\n\nFCC OKs Cingular\\'s purchase of AT&T Wireless"
