        "text": "Samsung Mobiles on 2nd March, Sunday at the MWC 2015, revealed their best-designed product yet, the Samsung Galaxy S6 and S6 Edge. For lots of reasons, I’ve never been a fan of Samsung, ever! Not even while writing this article.\n\nBut, as a tech enthusiast I appreciate the efforts of Samsung getting out of their comfort zone and focusing more on design and premium quality along with technology. They’ve put a lot of work in the next Galaxy mobiles. Here’s how they look.\n\nThere’s no much difference between the devices, except the dual-edge display in the S6 Edge, which has some exciting things that make use of the edges. Features like, Colour Notifications (adding 5 contacts as shortcuts with different colour code – notifications blink as per the colour code!), and other action items are pretty cool.\n\nWhat’s inside? Samsung claims that the S6 phones are the most advanced smartphones yet!! The benchmarks have also proved the devices are well ahead of the competition in processing speed and graphics. Samsung ignored the Snapdragon 810 processor because of the overheat issues and chosen their own Exynos 7420 processor for both of the models. The phone does not have a sd card slot or a removable battery like every other Samsung device. Instead, Samsung has done a welcome move by using the Ultra Flash Storage (Like SSD in PC) and DDR4 for the memory and wireless charging, finally, Yaay!\n\nDevice Specifications:\n\nBODY\n\nDimensions 143.4 x 70.5 x 6.8 mm (5.65 x 2.78 x 0.27 in)\n\nWeight 138 g (4.87 oz)\n\nBuild Corning Gorilla Glass 4 back panel\n\nDISPLAY\n\nType Super AMOLED capacitive touchscreen, 16M colors\n\nSize 5.1 inches (~70.7% screen-to-body ratio)\n\nResolution 1440 x 2560 pixels (~577 ppi pixel density)\n\nPLATFORM\n\nAndroid OS, v5.0.2 (Lollipop) with – TouchWiz UI\n\nChipset Exynos 7420\n\nCPU Quad-core 1.5 GHz Cortex-A53 & Quad-core 2.1 GHz Cortex-A57\n\nInternal 32/64/128 GB, 3 GB RAM\n\nCAMERA\n\nPrimary 16 MP (with Optical Image Stabilization)\n\nSecondary 5 MP\n\nFEATURES\n\nFingerprint sensor (PayPal certified)\n\n– Samsung Pay (Visa, MasterCard certified)\n\n– Wireless charging (Qi/PMA) – market dependent\n\nBATTERY\n\nNon-removable Li-Ion 2550 mAh battery\n\nSamsung claims that the 16 Megapixels camera would be the industry’s best. They also say that most of the unwanted bloatware, that usually is a part of every Samsung device, has finally been dumped (Samsung just got their ears back?!). And there are so many other small software tweaks has been included with Samsung TouchWiz 4.0. The phone is protected by Gorilla glass on front and back and fingerprint scanner. But, sadly, there’s no water-resistance like the S5! Samsung also promises the phone charges blazingly fast! (Half the time of iPhone 6, they said!!)\n\nHaving said that, the device do look bewitching, but certainly it’s not so perfect. The 2k display with 2550 Mah battery in the S6 and 2600MAh in the S6 Edge, we have to wait and see how the battery life is. Though Samsung claims their chips are 35% energy efficient, we’ll wait and see about that! Meanwhile, here’s how it stands between the rivals:\n\nRelease Date & Price in India? Both S6 and S6 Edge will be available in 20 countries starting from April 10. Price? Remember the cheap plastic phones that Samsung provides for flagship prizes? Well, if you do, then you’ll have a fair idea how much these premium devices would cost. There’s no official details about price from Samsung. But, from my little knowledge of their strategy, the phones should be priced about 50K or even more (But not more than Note 4 – we guess), competitively with HTC One M9.\n\nShould you buy it? Well, though it’s of one’s interest, we just give our opinion. One of the recent surveys proved that the cost of Samsung mobile phones drop significantly up to 30% within 3 months of release and it goes as much as till 50% within two years. Make the wise choice!"
