        "text": "According to a new leak, the Samsung Galaxy S6 might feature an 8-core processor, 3GB of RAM, 32GB of flash storage, a 20-megapixel rear-facing camera, 5-megapixel front-facing camera and Android 5.0 Lollipop.\n\nThe rumors are coming from a leaked AnTuTu benchmark, displaying the \"SM-G925F\" handset, that should be the Galaxy S6. Samsung is reportedly designing the Galaxy S6 from scratch, after the not-so-great seller that is the Galaxy S5. There should be two versions of the Galaxy S6 on offer, one that features the aforementioned 8-core processor that Samsung will build in-house, while the other Galaxy S6 will feature a Qualcomm processor.\n\nIf Samsung wants to gain back missing customers, or sell a boatload more Galaxy S6 handsets, I think we need more than just pure hardware. Offering stock Android handsets would be a big start, as they'd secure the Nexus crowd, and some radical new technology and features wouldn't go astray, either.\n\nAnthony Garreffa\n\nAnthony joined the TweakTown team in 2010 and has since reviewed 100s of graphics cards.

Working in IT retail for 10 years gave him great experience with custom-built PCs. His addiction to GPU tech is unwavering and has recently taken a keen interest in artificial intelligence (AI) hardware."
