        "text": "Last year, the LG G3 ran neck and neck with the Galaxy S5, the earlier flagship smartphone from Samsung. But this year, Samsung appears to have taken the lead with the release of its Galaxy S6. Here is how the flagship smartphone from Samsung compares against the phablet from LG.\n\nDesign\n\nThe LG G3 was a huge competitor to the Galaxy S5 last year. One element that worked in its favor was the fact that it had a plastic body with a faux metal finish which made it appear to have a premium build. However, against the Galaxy S6, this advantage is completely erased, as the new Samsung flagship phone has a premium metal frame with Gorilla Glass 4 on its back panel. As for colors, the Galaxy S6 has four options: white, gold, blue and black. The LG G3 comes in black, gold, white, burgundy and violet.\n\nDisplay\n\nWith the LG G3 falling into the phablet category, its IPS LCD screen is bigger and measures 5.5 inches, with a resolution of 1440 x 2560 pixels and a density of 538 pixels per inch. As for the Galaxy S6, it has a Super AMOLED screen measuring 5.1 inches with a resolution of 1440 x 2560 pixels and a density of 577 pixels per inch.\n\nSpecs\n\nWhen it was released last year, the LG G3 had the best available specs at that time in the form of a Qualcomm Snapdragon 801 chipset, a Quad-core Krait 400 CPU clocked at 2.5 GHz and an Adreno 330 GPU. Compared to this, the Galaxy S6 is a much faster device as it has the latest specs in its Exynos 7420 chipset, coupled with a CPU with four Cortex-A53 cores clocked at 1.5 GHz, four Cortex-A57 cores clocked at 2.1 GHz and a Mali-T760 GPU.\n\nMemory\n\nThe Samsung Galaxy S6 shows a major deviation from its predecessor, the S5, since it does not have a memory slot, which means external storage cannot be added. As for the LG G3 it has a slot which can be used to add up to 128 GB of external storage. When it comes to RAM, all versions of the Galaxy S6 have 3 GB onboard. The 16 GB version of the LG G3 has 2 GB RAM while its 32 GB version has 3 GB RAM.\n\nPrice\n\nThe Galaxy S6 is priced at $199 with a two-year contract while the LG G3 costs $99 with a similar contract."
