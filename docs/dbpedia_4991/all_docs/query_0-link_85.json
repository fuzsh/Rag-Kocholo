While the benefits probably aren't quite enough to persuade current S6 users to ditch their current phone and upgrade to the S7 right this second, those looking for a fast smartphone at a great price should definitely consider Samsung's latest and greatest.\n\nVergleich, online verfügbar, Mittel, Datum: 17.03.2016\n\nSamsung Galaxy S7 vs Samsung Galaxy S6\n\nQuelle: Phone Arena EN→DE Archive.org version\n\nThere's time to wax poetic, and there's time to tackle the facts head on. And the facts are that the Galaxy S7 is an evolutionary step forward for Samsung, but no more. Sure, we're more than happy to see that the company has improved on ergonomics and that the handset is now dust- and water-resistant, but much everything else is very comparable to the Galaxy S6, or even slightly worse.\n\nVergleich, online verfügbar, Lang, Datum: 11.03.2016\n\nShould you upgrade to the Galaxy S7?\n\nQuelle: Tech Advisor EN→DE Archive.org version\n\nWe really don't believe the Samsung Galaxy S7 is the minor update many are billing it as - Samsung has looked at the features real users want and need, and thus made a good thing a lot better. However, if waterproofing, expandable storage and improved battery life are not your primary concerns, we'd advise looking to the much cheaper Galaxy S6 over the Galaxy S7, or at least waiting a few months for its price to come down. If we are to believe Samsung the S7 should be faster and with a better camera, but don't forget the S6 is also incredibly fast and its camera is excellent - and right now it's a not insignificant £200 cheaper.\n\nVergleich, online verfügbar, Mittel, Datum: 29.02.2016\n\nSamsung Galaxy S7 vs Galaxy S6 hands on - which is BEST?\n\nQuelle: Expert Reviews EN→DE Archive.org version\n\nPrice is going to be important, but it's hard to directly compare the models, as the S7 can be upgraded via its microSD card slot, whereas the S6 can't. As a result, it seems fair to compare the 32GB S7 to the 64GB S6. Currently, SIM-Free direct from Samsung, the S6 64Gb costs £479 and the S6 Edge costs £499; The 32GB S7 Edge costs £639 and the S7 costs £70 less at £569. To me, the S7 is well-priced and worth the premium for new buyers. There're even enough features to tempt some S6 users, but probably not quite enough to make most people upgrade. However, those looking for a fast smartphone at a great price should still think about the S6, which will most likely have some top deals available for it on contract.\n\nVergleich, online verfügbar, Kurz, Datum: 20.02.2016\n\nLooking back at the Samsung Galaxy S6\n\nQuelle: Android Authority EN→DE Archive.org version\n\nThese statements are not usually easily made when considering a device that is a year old, and even more so in the case of previous Samsung devices. If nothing else, the Galaxy S6 is a testament to the fact that Samsung began to right the ship in 2015, and that is something we are hoping to see continue in just a few days from now.\n\nEinzeltest, online verfügbar, Kurz, Datum: 09.02.2016\n\niPhone 6s vs. Galaxy S6 vs. Xperia Z5\n\nQuelle: GSM Arena EN→DE Archive.org version\n\nEach phone managed to draw blood relatively early on, but the final score can't simply be based on which phone took home the most victories. Price is an important consideration as well, on that front the Samsung Galaxy S6 seems to be leading, even if you have big storage requirements and go for the 128GB model. For that price you get the best screen, software focused on multitasking and security and a camera that works great in the dark.\n\nVergleich, online verfügbar, Sehr Lang, Datum: 26.10.2015\n\niPhone 6s vs. Galaxy S6 vs. Xperia Z5\n\nQuelle: GSM Arena EN→DE Archive.org version\n\nYou've had your say, ours is coming in shortly. We're finishing up a full three-way fight between the iPhone 6s, Galaxy S6 and Xperia Z5 that will go beyond the camera - hardware, screen, software, audio and so on. There will be more details on the camera too, so check back soon!\n\nVergleich, online verfügbar, Sehr Lang, Datum: 22.10.2015\n\nAmazing specs & features makes it tough to decide which of these flagship phones is best\n\nQuelle: Macworld.co.uk EN→DE Archive.org version\n\nOverall, the iPhone 6s and Galaxy S6 are both really, really great smartphones, and choosing between them is tough. Ultimately, it'll come down to your software preference – you're likely to already know whether you're an Android or iOS fan. They're both around the same price but they both offer individual features that help them stand out from the crowd and could well convince you to switch operating system.\n\nVergleich, online verfügbar, Mittel, Datum: 16.10.2015\n\nWhat's the best Android phone?\n\nQuelle: Tech Advisor EN→DE Archive.org version\n\nIf you're buying these phones SIM-free then the Samsung Galaxy S6 is the clear winner, more than £200 cheaper and with a higher-resolution screen and what's more than likely to be the faster processor. If you're buying on a contract, though, the Galaxy just got some real competition - the Xperia Z5 has the microSD support and waterproofing protection Samsung fans are crying out for, and with better battery life and more impressive audio quality to boot. We can't accurately judge which phone has the better camera on specs alone, but we don't think you'll be disappointed by the photography prowess of either.\n\nVergleich, online verfügbar, Mittel, Datum: 09.10.2015\n\nApple iPhone 6s vs Samsung Galaxy S6\n\nQuelle: Phone Arena EN→DE Archive.org version\n\nWith both handsets going for similar approaches on a number of levels, we should really be looking at their more pronounced differences. First off, the screen of the iPhone 6s is less pixel-heavy, but that doesn't really detract from the actual user experience, and comes as a bonus in the way of smoother navigation, higher frame rate in games, and — as it turns out — satisfying battery life. With regards to software experience, cameras, browsing and most other aspects, it's almost always a question of trade-off between quality and quantity, with the iPhone 6s gravitating towards the quality side of things, and the Galaxy S6 demonstrating a preference towards the “more is better” approach.\n\nVergleich, online verfügbar, Lang, Datum: 09.10.2015\n\nSamsung Galaxy S6 vs iphone 6S\n\nQuelle: Android Authority EN→DE Archive.org version\n\nThe choice here is simple. Do you prefer the customization of Android over the simplicity of iOS? Do you prefer the third party accessory support the iPhone gets over the fragmented Android device market? Do you prefer to be on the cutting edge of specifications at all times? Being in touch with what you truly like as a user will help you make this decision, and even if you jump from one ship to the other, the overall ability to get things done is about the same.\n\nVergleich, online verfügbar, Mittel, Datum: 07.10.2015\n\niPhone 6s vs Samsung Galaxy S6 comparison: Should I buy the new iPhone or the Samsung Galaxy S6?\n\nQuelle: Tech Advisor EN→DE Archive.org version\n\nWe can't offer our full verdict on the iPhone 6s until we've spent more time with it in the PC Advisor office, but we expect it to impress us. We're pleased to see camera improvements and the innovative new 3D Touch display, but we do wish that screen was higher-resolution to match the Samsung Galaxy S6, which absolutely blows the 6s out of the water in that area.\n\nVergleich, online verfügbar, Kurz, Datum: 22.09.2015\n\nOneplus 2 Vs Samsung Galaxy S6\n\nQuelle: Android Authority EN→DE Archive.org version\n\nPrice can be a real trump card, and one that OnePlus has been able to leverage before. This year, the price of the OnePlus 2 is a little higher at $329, which is still significantly cheaper than many other high-end devices, including the Galaxy S6, which can go as high as $579, with the Galaxy S6 Edge requiring an additional $100 or more. Though there are great mid-range smartphones out there that are priced the same as the OnePlus 2, it certainly destroys most of them in comparison.\n\nVergleich, online verfügbar, Mittel, Datum: 17.09.2015\n\nSamsung Galaxy Note5 vs Samsung Galaxy S6\n\nQuelle: Phone Arena EN→DE Archive.org version\n\nFor those looking to uplift their screen desires, Note5 is a more than worthy replacement of the capable Galaxy S6. Not only does it sport a similar eye-catching design, but also offers an extra input method with the S Pen stylus tucked in the thin and light chassis.\n\nVergleich, online verfügbar, Sehr Lang, Datum: 14.09.2015\n\nOnePlus 2 vs Samsung Galaxy S6 comparison review: 'Flagship killer' against the best phone\n\nQuelle: Tech Advisor EN→DE Archive.org version\n\nAt its original price, we'd likely be recommending the OnePlus 2 in this comparison. However, with the S6 available at under £400 it's not quite so clear cut. While the OnePlus 2 is probably the bargain phone of the year, the S6 has some advantages including slimmer build, a better camera, a higher resolution screen and more storage available – all of which might tempt you to spend the extra money.\n\nVergleich, online verfügbar, Sehr kurz, Datum: 03.09.2015\n\nSamsung Galaxy S6 Active Vs Galaxy S6 / S6 Edge\n\nQuelle: Android Authority EN→DE Archive.org version\n\nSo there you have it for this closer look at the Samsung Galaxy S6 Active vs Galaxy S6 / S6 Edge! The Galaxy S6 Active is really the phone made for anyone that doesn’t feel as safe with Samsung’s more elegant, but also more delicate, offerings. Despite the move back to plastic, or as a result of, the Active can take a beating and keep things ticking along. Its usefulness is more than catered just towards the rock climber, the drink spiller, or the clumsy handler, with its larger size allowing for a battery capacity and longevity that we only wished the Galaxy S6 could muster, and the Active button is useful for everyone who wants an easy access method to their most used applications. If the Galaxy S6 Edge is the luxury sports car, and seems to be priced accordingly, the Galaxy S6 Active is the off-roading vehicle that can still show off on the streets, and in this scenario, also gives far better gas mileage.\n\nVergleich, online verfügbar, Mittel, Datum: 03.07.2015\n\nSamsung Galaxy S6 Active vs Samsung Galaxy S6\n\nQuelle: Phone Arena EN→DE Archive.org version\n\nDecisions, decisions! We all thought it was going to be an easy one this year choosing the best Android phone, but Sammy just wants to make it harder on all of us. That’s not a bad thing per se, especially when there’s variety and choice with its S6 line, but between the two here in this comparison, it comes down to design – that’s the single, greatest differentiator between them.\n\nVergleich, online verfügbar, Lang, Datum: 25.06.2015\n\nLG G4 vs. Samsung Galaxy S6: Next door rivals\n\nQuelle: GSM Arena EN→DE Archive.org version\n\nThe Hatfields and McCoys are legendary rival neighbors from the New Continent, but South Korea has two tech giants instead - Samsung and LG. Their flagship phones, the Samsung Galaxy S6 and LG G4, will compete for every inch of ground gained on the market. These two are quite different in nature and will appeal to different crowds. The thin metal and glass design of the S6 goes after the iPhone, while also catering to Galaxy faithfuls who weren't happy with the faux leather. The LG G4 steers away from the \"smartphone slab\" design with a uniquely curved body and provides a soft answer to Apple's and HTC's metal.\n\nVergleich, online verfügbar, Sehr Lang, Datum: 19.06.2015\n\nLG G4 vs Samsung Galaxy S6 / S6 Edge – Camera Shootout\n\nQuelle: Android Authority EN→DE Archive.org version\n\nSo there you have it for this in-depth look at the LG G4 vs Samsung Galaxy S6 / S6 Edge camera! As you may have noticed throughout the video, the Galaxy S6 does tend feature very punchy colors, but the color reproduction with the LG G4 is far from bland, and the shots still look really nice. Bottom-line, users will likely be happy regardless of which smartphone camera they end up choosing.\n\nVergleich, online verfügbar, Mittel, Datum: 10.06.2015\n\nLG G4 vs Samsung Galaxy S6 / S6 Edge\n\nQuelle: Android Authority EN→DE Archive.org version\n\nAt the end of the day, the main story here is that, while both the G4 and the S6 offer a lot of features, they are as quick and smooth as they need to be. Both companies have received a lot of flak for stutter and lag on previous iterations of TouchWiz and LG UX, but complaints are few and far between this time around, and that is a wonderful development.\n\nVergleich, online verfügbar, Lang, Datum: 08.06.2015\n\nThe best of Android vs the best of Apple\n\nQuelle: Tech Advisor EN→DE Archive.org version\n\nThese two phones are more closely matched than ever before. Although it's more expensive, the Galaxy S6 is the better smartphone here thanks to its extra storage, impressive Quad HD screen, awesome camera and extra gadgets like the IR blaster and heart rate monitor. A big factor here is software, though, so if you don't want Android then the iPhone 6 is the phone for you.\n\nVergleich, online verfügbar, Kurz, Datum: 26.05.2015\n\nCamera-phone shootout: LG G4 versus Samsung Galaxy S6\n\nQuelle: Androidbeat EN→DE Archive.org version\n\nWith three distinct wins, one ‘draw’ and one loss, the LG G4 comes out of my five scene test here as the winner. Yes, the Galaxy S6 (and Edge) 16MP unit is terrific too, definitely the second best imaging powerhouse in the world for all purpose snapping, image quality, and so on. But the G4’s results are astonishing (I’ve put one of them from my tests up here, for you to download and analyse, should you feel inclined) and it has me rocked back on my heels – I never expected anything this good could exist housed within a standard smartphone body.\n\nVergleich, online verfügbar, Kurz, Datum: 22.05.2015\n\nSamsung Galaxy S6 vs Galaxy S6 Edge comparison review: Is the edge screen worth paying extra for?\n\nQuelle: Tech Advisor EN→DE Archive.org version\n\nApart from the gorgeous bezel-free look of the S6 Edge compared to the regular model, we're not convinced it's worth the extra money. There are only a handful of functions and while this may change over time with software updates it's an unknown and no guarantee.\n\nVergleich, online verfügbar, Sehr kurz, Datum: 21.05.2015\n\nIn-depth comparison: Samsung Galaxy S6 vs iPhone 6\n\nQuelle: Laptop Media EN→DE Archive.org version\n\nBoth smartphones have great-looking premium design, good displays and high performance. Which comes on top is up to the users themselves. Samsung Galaxy S6 has a slight advantage over the Apple iPhone 6 in the hardware department, but Apple’s device makes up for it with its software optimizations. Both devices are fluid and you won’t go wrong choosing either one of them. If you want to be able to tweak almost everything, go with the Galaxy S6. If you like things simple, where everything is organized, easily accessible and easier to use, and you want your device to be just as fast and responsive in a couple of years’ time, go with the iPhone 6.\n\nEinzeltest, online verfügbar, Lang, Datum: 20.05.2015\n\nSamsung Galaxy S6 vs HTC One M9 comparison review: Which is the best new phone for 2015?\n\nQuelle: Tech Advisor EN→DE Archive.org version\n\nHTC has launched some of the prettiest Android phones, but Samsung has turned things around with its slender all metal and glass, Quad HD Samsung Galaxy S6. With a better screen and camera plus extras such as a fingerprint scanner, heart-rate monitor and wireless charging it's worth paying the extra for. The standout downside here is the lack of a microSD card slot.\n\nVergleich, online verfügbar, Sehr kurz, Datum: 19.05.2015\n\nLG G4 vs Samsung Galaxy S6\n\nQuelle: Phone Arena EN→DE Archive.org version\n\nIf you kept score, you'd know which way we're leaning right now — the Galaxy S6 snagged more wins on the way, big or small, earning itself a lead on the G4. This doesn't come without a lengthy, maybe even patronizing disclaimer, that makes it sufficiently clear that you should try and identify the things you care about instead of following along blindly. This means deciding whether you want a phablet-sized phone, or one that is easier to handle. It means asking yourself if that extra frame or two when gaming will really make a difference. It means finding out whether metal-and-glass designs are your thing, or whether you prefer the warm touch of leather instead.\n\nVergleich, online verfügbar, Mittel, Datum: 07.05.2015\n\nTested In-Depth: Samsung Galaxy S6 Smartphone\n\nQuelle: Tested EN→DE Archive.org version\n\nSamsung's new Galaxy S6 smartphone is a bit controversial, with its familiar design to the flagship's omission of a removable battery and microSD card slot. But its brilliant screen and camera make it very compelling. We sit down to run through all the important things about this phone and compare it to the iPhone 6.\n\nvideo review\n\nEinzeltest, online verfügbar, Sehr kurz, Datum: 04.05.2015\n\nLG G4 vs Samsung Galaxy S6 comparison\n\nQuelle: Tech Advisor EN→DE Archive.org version\n\nIt's impossible to give a definitive verdict until we've run the LG G4 through our benchmarks, but based on the specifications alone we can judge that the Samsung Galaxy S6 is the higher-specified phone with what we expect will be much faster performance, as well as more bells and whistles including wireless- and quick charging as standard, a heart-rate sensor and a fingerprint scanner, while the £100 cheaper LG G4 offers better value and the added benefits of a microSD card slot and removable battery.\n\nVergleich, online verfügbar, Sehr kurz, Datum: 01.05.2015\n\nMy Testing of the Samsung Galaxy S6 Smartphone\n\nQuelle: Tested EN→DE Archive.org version\n\nThere are few deal breakers with the Galaxy S6. I'm sure some people will refuse to buy a phone that has a sealed in battery or no microSD card, but these options are becoming increasingly rare. If you can get over that, the Galaxy S6 is an amazing phone with great build quality, the best screen so far, and a camera that will be hard to beat.\n\nEinzeltest, online verfügbar, Sehr kurz, Datum: 01.05.2015\n\nSamsung Galaxy S6 vs Galaxy S6 edge!\n\nQuelle: Android Authority EN→DE Archive.org version\n\nSo there you have it – a closer look at the Samsung Galaxy S6 vs Galaxy S6 Edge! Both of these phones show that Samsung has jumped forward in the flagship game. The Galaxy S6 and the S6 Edge will be the phones to beat this year, with their speed and stellar camera experience setting the bar very high for the competition. When it comes to picking one over the other though, it is really a matter of aesthetics and handling, both of which benefits that are actually felt. All things considered, the question that you have to answer is whether you are willing to pay even more for a phone that basically just looks and feels different, without bringing a whole lot else to the table.\n\nVergleich, online verfügbar, Kurz, Datum: 01.05.2015\n\nSamsung Galaxy S6 and S6 Edge\n\nQuelle: Hot Hardware EN→DE Archive.org version\n\nThere's just no other way to say it--The Galaxy S6 and S6 Edge are beasts. We were duly impressed with how Qualcomm's octa-core Snapdragon 810 performed in the HTC One M9, and Samsung's own Exynos octa-core power plant is equally impressive in its own way. The S6 duo chewed through our usual suite of benchmarks, and in real-world use, we found it to be noticably fast.\n\nVergleich, online verfügbar, Kurz, Datum: 29.04.2015\n\nSamsung Galaxy S6 and S6 edge video review\n\nQuelle: GSM Arena EN→DE Archive.org version\n\nIf you've already read our regular Galaxy S6 and S6 edge reviews, you may be wondering what this is doing here.

It is a welcome change – synthetic tests are fun to look at and to compare numbers but they were never very representative of what real-world experiences users see on their own devices. Synthetics still have a place to set expectations for hardware and to allow us to compare processor capabilities, but I am looking forward to adding GameBench to our standard suite of benchmarks for upcoming phone and tablet reviews.\n\nVergleich, online verfügbar, Sehr kurz, Datum: 21.04.2015\n\nSamsung Galaxy S6 and S6 edge\n\nQuelle: AnandTech EN→DE Archive.org version\n\nThe first most critical aspect of the Galaxy S6 and S6 edge, more than any other, is the change in design. Samsung has clearly identified a problem in their previously iterative approach, and they reacted appropriately by completely changing the materials that they use in their phones, even if the overall industrial design clearly retains a link to past Galaxy phone designs.\n\nVergleich, online verfügbar, Lang, Datum: 17.04.2015\n\nSamsung Galaxy S6 review - in-depth analysis including benchmarks, battery life test results and price comparisons\n\nQuelle: PC Pro EN→DE Archive.org version\n\nThe forgotten man in all the furore over the S6, the HTC One M9 and iPhone 6 is Sony's Xperia Z3, which has to be one of the most underrated handsets around at the moment. It's been around for a bit longer, and is likely to be replaced very soon by the Xperia Z4, but that doesn't make it any less attractive.\n\nEinzeltest, online verfügbar, Mittel, Datum: 16.04.2015\n\nGalaxy S6 vs iPhone 6 vs One M9\n\nQuelle: V3.co.uk EN→DE Archive.org version\n\nHaving picked up just one round, the HTC One M9 is the loser of this head to head review. The Galaxy S6 and iPhone 6 won four rounds each, but for us the Samsung handset has a definite edge. Featuring a superior display and better camera, battery and general performance the Galaxy S6 is currently the best smartphone out there.\n\nVergleich, online verfügbar, Mittel, Datum: 15.04.2015\n\nSamsung Galaxy S6 vs LG G3\n\nQuelle: Phone Arena EN→DE Archive.org version\n\nWith a much nicer design, a smaller but superior display, faster hardware, a better camera, and lightning-quick charging, the Samsung Galaxy S6 is a genuine superphone that's a worthy upgrade over the LG G3. It is also quite the challenge for LG, whose upcoming LG G4 will have to face a formidable adversary. However, the LG G3 remains more attractive from a price-oriented perspective. Being a year old and nicely discounted, it is one of the cheapest Quad-HD resolution smartphones you can buy new and unlocked. It's also a very nice smartphone overall, and while its looks and performance, admittedly, can't hold a candle to Samsung's latest and greatest, this doesn't make it anything less than a bargain!\n\nVergleich, online verfügbar, Mittel, Datum: 14.04.2015\n\nSamsung Galaxy S6 vs Google Nexus 6\n\nQuelle: Phone Arena EN→DE Archive.org version\n\nLet’s talk pricing for a moment! With the Nexus 6, it starts off at $699.99 full price, which is undoubtedly on the steep side, but something that’s warranted for something of its caliber and immense size. Conversely, it’s a little confusing regarding the pricing for the Galaxy S6, as various wireless providers and retail partners all have different prices for the 32GB Galaxy S6. Ranging from $599.99 to $684.99, the Galaxy S6 is at the minimum $100 less than the Nexus 6 when it comes to outright pricing.\n\nVergleich, online verfügbar, Mittel, Datum: 14.04.2015\n\nGalaxy S6 vs HTC One M9\n\nQuelle: V3.co.uk EN→DE Archive.org version\n\nDespite having a theoretically lower storage capacity and costing £20 more than the One M9, the Galaxy S6 is the clear winner of this head-to-head review.

I haven't felt this positive about an Android phone since the first HTC One--the phone that got me to convert to Android in the first place. You can be disappointed in Samsung that it's choosing a design direction that's a departure from the past, but I won't take points away for it resembling the iPhone.\n\nEinzeltest, online verfügbar, Sehr kurz, Datum: 13.04.2015\n\nSamsung Galaxy S6 vs Samsung Galaxy S6 edge\n\nQuelle: Phone Arena EN→DE Archive.org version\n\nSo, do you have a better idea now of which smartphone is a better choice? Well, if you don't want to shed a hundred dollars over the GS6's price for the S6 edge, that's more than fine, but you will be missing out on a louder speaker, and an innovative design. Then again, you might end up not liking the way the curved sides feel in the hand, or you might not be able to get used to the subtly different way movies and websites look on the curved screen.\n\nVergleich, online verfügbar, Mittel, Datum: 09.04.2015\n\nSteely wonder?

Only the absence of expandable microSD storage and the seriously iffy reception spoil the story. The market has clearly signalled, at this end of the price range, that many buyers don’t regard the omission of a flash slot as a deal-breaker if the overall package is attractive.

For some, those exclusions are deal breakers. For me personally, I can tell you that during this review period, I never once said out loud, “Man, I really wish this phone had a micro SD slot, removable battery, and was waterproof.” That’s not to say that Samsung’s 180 on all three of these features from one year to the next isn’t something to complain about, it’s that I’ve become used to these features not being included in phones.

When we think about what it takes to be slapped with the flagship status, it does carry almost all the qualities that come with the territory.

On that basis, though the Galaxy S6 edge is a stunning example of technological proficiency - and its painful under-utilization - it’s the Galaxy S6 which provides ample retort to Apple’s iPhone, and which is certainly the best Android phone around today.\n\nVergleich, online verfügbar, Kurz, Datum: 06.04.2015\n\nGalaxy S6 vs S5\n\nQuelle: V3.co.uk EN→DE Archive.org version\n\nFeaturing a reworked, more luxurious design, improved screen, next-generation octa-core processor and significantly cleaner TouchWiz skin, the Galaxy S6 is the best smartphone ever released by Samsung.

Yes, the Samsung Galaxy S6 is better than the Galaxy Note 4 in many ways. It isn't leading by much, but ultimately, it does deliver a bigger bang for your buck considering that the two phones carry a similar on-contract price tag.

Es ist schön an den Kanten und so ungemein leicht an den Bildschirmkanten abgerundet, das sein Profil perfekt ergonomisch ist. Andere Features wie Home-, Menu- und Back-Taste sind wie gehabt. Der Metallrahmen rundum das Gerät ist gut und fühlt sich solide an, obwohl man die Neuheit infrage stellen könnte. Einige Verbesserungen finden sich in Form des mitgelieferten kabellosen Ladegeräts und dem Touch-Fingerabdruckleser anstatt der Swipe-Bewegung des Vorgängermodells. Das Galaxy S6 ist in zwei Farben erhältlich: perlweiß und schwarzer Saphir.\n\nDas Rückpanel ist aus Glas, ist jedoch robust, da das gesamte Gerät mit Corning Gorilla Glass 4 bedeckt ist. Das Samsung Galaxy S6 verfügt über einen erstaunlichen 5,1 Zoll Super-AMOLED-Bildschirm mit beeindruckenden 577 ppi. Im Inneren befinden sich ein Exynos 7420 Quad-Core-Prozessor, 3 GB RAM, eine Mali-T760MP8 GPU und wahlweise 32 oder 128 GB interner Speicher. Da Samsung keinen SD-Kartenleser mehr verbaut, muss der Nutzer von vornherein das geeignete Speichergerät wählen. Die anderen Features sind wie von einem Top-Smartphone zu erwarten. Zudem verfügt das Samsung Galaxy S6 über einen 2550 mAh Akku. Selbst wenn die Akkukapazität kleiner als bei der Konkurrenz ist, erreicht das Samsung trotzdem eine gleich gute oder sogar bessere Akkuleistung.\n\nSerie: The Samsung Galaxy A3 2017 is a handset for those after a compact phone, one on an affordable contract, or a device that can be bought SIM-free. Most of Samsung’s phones of previous years were plastic, even the fairly expensive devices. The Samsung Galaxy A3 demonstrates just how far the company has moved on from that style. This device is composed of glass and metal, with barely any plastic on show at all. The front and back glass are big-brand Gorilla Glass 4, and the rear features curved edges for a softer feel. Beneath the screen is a reliable fingerprint scanner couched between the two soft keys, just as in Samsung’s larger phones. Also included is a headphone jack. In addition, the Galaxy A3 is water resistant. Its IP68 certification means that an accidental drop in water is unlikely to cause damage. As is the case with the majority of new handsets, the Samsung Galaxy A3 has a USB Type-C charging port rather than micro-USB. The phone has just 16 GB of storage, which is a little disappointing since the device offers only 9.8 GB of available internal memory and 481 MB of RAM without installing any apps. However, there is a slot for a single microSD card in the tray. The Samsung Galaxy A3 has an unusual speaker placement. Rather than sitting on the bottom of the device, it can be found on the side, above the power button. Speaker quality is fine, with enough volume to cut through some ambient noise.\n\nFor display, the Samsung Galaxy A3 2017 features a 4.7-inch Super AMOLED panel with punchy colors that can be calibrated to suit the user’s taste. For those who like a super-vivid look, it’s there. If a more relaxed colour is desired, it's possible to just switch to the \"Basic\" mode in Settings to achieve this. The Samsung Galaxy A3 has a 13 MP rear camera with a f/1.9 lens. However, the camera lacks optical image stabilization. Around the front sits an 8 MP selfie camera. It's capable of producing decent images in good light. The phone uses an Exynos 7870, a CPU with eight Cortex-A53 cores clocked at up to 1.6 GHz, and a Mali-T830 GPU. Samsung also includes masses of pre-installed apps, which aren't entirely welcome since the Samsung Galaxy A3’s storage is limited. There's the Microsoft Apps suite, including Word and OneNote. S Health is probably the most interesting of Samsung’s own apps. This is now a full fitness and 'wellness’ platform, allowing the user to simply track steps, but also log user’s food and GPS-track hikes, cycles and walks as well. There's only a small increase in battery capacity from 2,300 to 2,350 mAh. The 2,350 mAh battery is well suited to the Samsung Galaxy A3’s small screen, and when used in a way that exploits this, the Galaxy A3 lasts for some time. The 2017 Galaxy A3 is a low-end smartphone with all the necessary features of a high-end device. Hence, the slightly higher price tag is justified.\n\nHands-on article by Jagadisa Rajarathnam\n\nARM Mali-T760 MP8: Im Exynos 7420 Octa integrierter ARM-Grafikchip für Smartphones und Tablets.\n\nEinige nicht anspruchsvolle aktuelle Spiele können mit geringen Details noch flüssig gespielt werden.
