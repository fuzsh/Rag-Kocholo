        "text": "The Galaxy Tab S6 Lite (2024) refresh popped up on one of Samsung's European portals yesterday without fanfare. Now, Samsung has officially and formally announced the 2024 refresh for the global market.\n\nAlthough the tablet's release date is now as clear as it can be (more on that later), official pricing details are missing, and the spec sheet attached to the global announcement raises an unexpected question about Samsung's choice of chips for the Tab S6 Lite (2024).\n\nEarly online benchmarks have shown that the Galaxy Tab S6 Lite (2024) would be powered by the in-house Exynos 1280 chip, which features two Cortex-A78 CPU cores clocked at 2.4GHz and six Cortex-A55 CPU cores running at a 2.0GHz frequency.\n\nSamsung's global announcement for the Galaxy Tab S6 Lite (2024) doesn't specify exactly which chip the tablet conceals under its hood, but the spec sheet mentions a “Quad core 2.4GHz + Quad core 2.0GHz” CPU configuration, unlike the Exynos 1280.\n\nIf anything, that sounsd more like the newer Exynos 1380 chip rather than the Exynos 1280. Could the Galaxy Tab S6 Lite (2024) be powered by the better in-house solution? Maybe. Or it could be an unfortunate typo in Samsun's announcement. We'll let you know once we find out more, but we wouldn't get our hopes up for a better chip.\n\nOther Galaxy Tab S6 Lite (2024) details\n\nAside from the mystery surrounding the SoC, Samsung confirms that the Galaxy Tab S6 Lite (2024) refresh will be offered with 4GB of RAM and 64GB or 128GB of storage.\n\nThe device is equipped with a 10.4-inch TFT 2000 x 1200 display paired with an S Pen, and the camera configuration consists of an 8MP primary shooter and a 5MP selfie camera. The tablet is powered by a 7,040mAh battery.\n\nOther characteristics include three color options — Oxford Gray, Chiffon Pink, and a new Mint color. The tablet looks pretty much the same as it did in 2020. Check out our old photos for reference.\n\nSamsung's refreshed tablet has dual speakers tuned by AKG (one on each side), Dolby Atmos, LTE, Bluetooth 5.3, and Android 14 out of the box. There's no mention of which One UI version the tablet runs — One UI 6.0 or 6.1 — but the online page that emerged yesterday mentioned the newer One UI 6.1.\n\nAssuming you'd want to buy this refreshed Galaxy Tab S6 Lite in 2024, Samsung says it will be available starting March 28. Availability will vary by region, and official pricing details are missing. We'll keep you posted."
