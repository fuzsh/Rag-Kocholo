        "text": "Introduction\n\nUnixBench is a benchmarking tool that measures the performance of Unix-like operating systems. It provides a set of tests that evaluate various aspects of system performance, including CPU, memory, file I/O, and other system operations.\n\nThe generated results can be used to compare the performance of different hardware configurations, as well as to track changes in system performance over time. It is often used by system administrators, hardware, and software developers to evaluate the impact of system changes, optimizations, and upgrades.\n\nThe name \"UnixBench\" is derived from the fact that it was originally developed to benchmark Unix systems. However, it has since been adapted to work with a wide range of Unix-like operating systems, including Linux, BSD, and others.\n\nThe meaning of result level\n\nA high score typically indicates better performance, while a low score indicates poorer performance. When running UnixBench tests on a system, the tool generates a composite score based on the results of individual tests across various system components.\n\nA high score can suggest that the system performs well across different aspects tested by the benchmark, such as CPU performance, memory access speed, disk I/O performance, and other system operations. This can be an indication of good overall system performance and responsiveness.\n\nA low score may indicate that the system is underperforming in one or more areas tested by the benchmark. This could be due to factors such as outdated hardware, inefficient system configurations, resource limitations, or bottlenecks that are impacting overall system performance.\n\nIt is important to realize that in some cases, it would be possible improve results upon certain optimizations.\n\nInstructions\n\nRunning a benchmark:\n\nInstall the package.\n\nIf unixbench mentions 0 CPUs in system; running 1 parallel copy of tests then it couldn't correctly find the number of cpu's in /proc/cpuinfo. In that case you can override the number of cores with an environment variable:\n\nIf unixbench still uses only 1 CPU, bringing all CPUs on-line before might help.\n\nBenchmark results"
