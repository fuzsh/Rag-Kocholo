        "text": "Hey, I’m not saying with absolute certainty that there is no greed involved on Samsung’s part. I’m just saying it’s a little different to be drawing that comparison with the iphone. You can still laugh about older iphone storage increments being ripoffs because those weren’t dealing with UFS 2.0 upgraded storage technology. It’s like someone laughing at $100 7200 rpm storage increments by 100 GB for being a ripoff but understanding that the same $100 increments for SSDs wouldn’t be as much of a ripoff.\n\nThe TLC NAND versions of the iphone 6 and 6 plus are horrendous (compared to the s6) with random writes averaging at a measly 1.36MB/s. The MLC ones while a bit faster average closer to 5 or 6 MB/s or less. Compare with the Galaxy S6 that averages almost 20 MB/s for random write (almost 20 times faster than the TLC iphone 6/6+ ). Read speeds are 15 MB/s average for the iphone 6/6+ versus 77 MB/s average for the Galaxy S6 (about 5 times faster). Come back to me when iphones upgrade to UFS 2.0 storage or something with equivalent or much faster speed without changing the price then I’ll say they aren’t ripoffs anymore.\n\nAlso, I don’t get your argument about Samsung only offering 128 GB variants. That makes absolutely no sense. It’s like asking why SSD manufacturers even bother with 64 GB and 120 GB units. The truth is for the vast majority of people out there, 32 GB (I would even argue 16 GB) will be more than enough for their phone storage. The users that truly need more than that probably won’t even crack 3% of the install base. And for those users, 64 GB is $100 away or with a few months of waiting discounted at much less or no cost."
