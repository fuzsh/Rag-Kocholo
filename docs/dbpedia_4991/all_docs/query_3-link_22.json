        "text": "Samsung’s Galaxy Tab S6 Lite is a 10.4 inch Android tablet with a FHD+ touchscreen display and support for Samsung’s pressure-sensitive S-Pen. It’s also one of the most affordable S-Pen enabled devices.\n\nWhen Samsung first launched the tablet in 2020, it had a list price of $350, and two years later, when the company released an updated model with a faster processor, it was priced within the same ballpark. Both models often go on sale, with prices sometimes falling as low as $200. Now Samsung is preparing to launch another update to this tablet, bringing a faster processor and newer version of Google’s Android operating system. Update: The Galaxy Tab S6 Lite is official and it should be available beginning March, 28, 2024.\n\nA series of leaks over the past few weeks have indicated that the upcoming Samsung Galaxy S6 Lite (2024) refresh will look identical to earlier models on the outside. It has the same 10.4 inch, 2000 x 1200 pixel IPS LCD display, USB-C port, and headphone jack.\n\nThe battery, cameras, memory, and storage don’t appear to have changed either.\n\nWhat is new is that the tablet will have a Samsung Exynos 1280 processor that combines two ARM Cortex-A78 CPU cores with six Cortex-A55 cores and Mali-G68 MC4 graphics.\n\nWhile this isn’t exactly a state-of-the-art processor, it should bring at least a modest speed bump over the Snapdragon 720G chip used in the 2022 model and an even bigger improvement over the Exynos 9610 processor used in the 2020 version.\n\nThe new version of the Galaxy Tab S6 Lite is also expected to ship with Android 14, and will likely continue to be supported by Samsung for longer than either of the older models.\n\nWhile these modest spec bumps might not be enough to encourage anyone with a previous-gen Galaxy Tab S6 Lite to upgrade, they could make the new model more attractive than the older versions for new customers.\n\nThere’s no word on exactly when the Galaxy Tab S6 Lite (2024) will be available, but it’s expected to come in at least two versions: a WiFi-only tablet with the model number SM-P620 and a 4G LTE version called the SM-P625.\n\nAccording to German site WinFuture, they’re expected to sell for around 400 Euros and 450 Euros, respectively. I suspect that means they’ll go for around $400 to $450 in the US, although if history tells us anything, it’s that those prices will likely fall within the first year after the new tablet goes on sale. 91mobiles has also spotted product pages with detailed specs, painting a picture of a tablet that’s nearly identical to earlier models in most respects… but which has a few key upgrades, which I’ve highlighted in the table below.\n\nGalaxy Tab S6 Lite (2024)Galaxy Tab S6 Lite (2022)Galaxy Tab S6 Lite (2020)Display10.4 inch, 2000 x 1200 LCD\n\nS-PenProcessorSamsung Exynos 1280\n\n2 x Cortex-A78 cores @ 2.4 GHz\n\n6 x Cortex-A55 cores @ 2 GHz\n\nMali-G68 MC4 graphicsQualcomm Snapdragon 720G\n\n2 x Kryo 465 Gold (Cortex-A76) CPU cores @ 2.3 GHz\n\n6 x Kryo 465 Silver (Cortex-A55) CPU cores @ 1.8 GHz\n\nAdreno 618 graphics\n\n8nmSamsung Exynos 9610\n\n4 x Cortex-A73 CPU cores @ 2.3 GHz\n\n4 x Cortex-A53 CPU cores @ 1.7 GHz\n\nMali-G72 MP3 graphics\n\n10nmRAM4GBStorage64GB or 128GB64GB64GB or 128GBInitial SoftwareAndroid 14Android 12Android 10Front camera5MP fixed-focusRear camera(s)8MP auto-focusBattery7,040 mAhUSBUSB Type-CHeadphone?3.5mmmicroSD?YesWiFiWiFi 5Bluetooth5.35.0GPSYesDimensions244.5mm x 154.3mm x 7mmWeight467 grams465 grams467 grams\n\nThis article was first published March 7, 2024 and most recently updated March 25, 2024.\n\nvia Samsung Romania, 91Mobiles (1)(2), WinFuture, MySmartPrice, IT Home\n\nSupport Liliputing\n\nLiliputing's primary sources of revenue are advertising and affiliate links (if you click the \"Shop\" button at the top of the page and buy something on Amazon, for example, we'll get a small commission).\n\nBut there are several ways you can support the site directly even if you're using an ad blocker* and hate online shopping.\n\nContribute to our Patreon campaign\n\nor...\n\nContribute via PayPal\n\n* If you are using an ad blocker like uBlock Origin and seeing a pop-up message at the bottom of the screen, we have a guide that may help you disable it."
