        "text": "Samsung Galaxy S6 system performance tests\n\nWith the Samsung Galaxy S6 the company went its own way, meaning it used the in-house Exynos 7420. It's the first mobile chipset to be built on a 14nm fabrication process (Snapdragon 810 is on 20nm), which should reduce power usage. That in turn reduces the dreaded thermal throttling that was a major issue in the Exynos vs. Snapdragon debate recently.\n\nThe Exynos 7420 and Snapdragon 810 are not that different in terms of processor, both use a big.LITTLE setup with four Cortex-A57 cores at 2.1GHz and four Cortex-A53 cores at 1.5GHz. The GPU is a Mali-T760 from ARM and it shares 3GB of RAM with the processor.\n\nUpdate, April 3: We received a retail unit and reran the benchmarks. Some results improved slightly (noticeably the 3D graphics performance) compared to the pre-release unit we used initially.\n\nThe Galaxy S6 runs a 64-bit version of Android 5.0.2 and all eight of its cores are 64-bit capable. This is good for the future, but for now 32-bit apps run just fine - in fact, AnTuTu 5 offered both options. It returned equal scores in both 32-bit and 64-bit modes, crushing the Snapdragon opposition (805 for the Nexus 6 and Galaxy Note 4, 810 for the LG G Flex2).\n\nAnTuTu 5\n\nHigher is better\n\nSamsung Galaxy S6\n\n69396\n\nMotorola Nexus 6\n\n49803\n\nSamsung Galaxy Note 4 Lollipop\n\n49273\n\nLG G Flex2\n\n47680\n\nMotorola Moto X (2014) Lollipop\n\n45660\n\nSamsung Galaxy S5\n\n45348\n\nBasemark OS 2.0 tips the scales the other way and narrowly gives the win to the LG G Flex2, with the Galaxy S6 trailing by less than 5%.\n\nBasemark OS 2.0\n\nHigher is better\n\nLG G Flex2\n\n1726\n\nSamsung Galaxy S6\n\n1674\n\nMotorola Nexus 6\n\n1267\n\nSamsung Galaxy Note 4 Lollipop\n\n1267\n\nMotorola Moto X (2014) Lollipop\n\n1176\n\nSamsung Galaxy S5\n\n1160\n\nLooking at just the CPU performance at GeekBench 3, we see a massive advantage in multicore performance. The Snapdragon 810 runs its CPU cores a little slower (0.1GHz), but that's far too little to account for the difference. Basemark OS 2.0 confirms both the single-core and multi-core difference.\n\nGeekBench 3\n\nHigher is better\n\nSamsung Galaxy S6\n\n5215\n\nLG G Flex2\n\n3604\n\nSamsung Galaxy Note 4 Lollipop\n\n3394\n\nMotorola Nexus 6\n\n3285\n\nSamsung Galaxy S5\n\n3120\n\nMotorola Moto X (2014) Lollipop\n\n2970\n\nBasemark OS 2.0 (single-core)\n\nHigher is better\n\nSamsung Galaxy S6\n\n6306\n\nSamsung Galaxy Note 4 Lollipop\n\n6165\n\nMotorola Moto X (2014) Lollipop\n\n5977\n\nMotorola Nexus 6\n\n5624\n\nLG G Flex2\n\n5597\n\nSamsung Galaxy S5\n\n5557\n\nBasemark OS 2.0 (multi-core)\n\nHigher is better\n\nSamsung Galaxy S6\n\n26799\n\nMotorola Moto X (2014) Lollipop\n\n21841\n\nMotorola Nexus 6\n\n21026\n\nSamsung Galaxy S5\n\n19237\n\nLG G Flex2\n\n18856\n\nSamsung Galaxy Note 4 Lollipop\n\n18386\n\nThe Samsung Galaxy S6 has a QHD screen - 1,440 x 2,560px - which is around 80% more pixels than a 1080p screen (like the LG G Flex2 and Moto X have). Offscreen tests normalize resolution at 1080p so you can compare raw performance, while on-screen tests predict real-world gaming performance.\n\nThe Mali-T760 proved faster in general than the Adreno 430 found in the curved LG phone and even the beefy PowerVR GX6450 in the Apple iPhone 6. Depending on the graphics level playable framerates are achievable at native resolution, though more complicated graphics (like in GFX 3.0) push it well under the treshold.\n\nBasemark X considers only off-screen results and predictably gives the win to the Galaxy S6.\n\nGFX 2.7 T-Rex (1080p offscreen)\n\nHigher is better\n\nSamsung Galaxy S6\n\n59\n\nLG G Flex2\n\n49\n\nSamsung Galaxy Note 4 Lollipop\n\n40\n\nMotorola Nexus 6\n\n38.9\n\nMotorola Moto X (2014) Lollipop\n\n27\n\nSamsung Galaxy S5\n\n27\n\nGFX 3.0 Manhattan (1080p offscreen)\n\nHigher is better\n\nSamsung Galaxy S6\n\n24\n\nLG G Flex2\n\n22\n\nMotorola Nexus 6\n\n18.6\n\nSamsung Galaxy Note 4 Lollipop\n\n18\n\nMotorola Moto X (2014) Lollipop\n\n12\n\nSamsung Galaxy S5\n\n12\n\nGFX 2.7 T-Rex (onscreen)\n\nHigher is better\n\nLG G Flex2\n\n48\n\nSamsung Galaxy S6\n\n38\n\nMotorola Moto X (2014) Lollipop\n\n29\n\nSamsung Galaxy S5\n\n28\n\nMotorola Nexus 6\n\n27.4\n\nSamsung Galaxy Note 4 Lollipop\n\n26\n\nGFX 3.0 Manhattan (onscreen)\n\nHigher is better\n\nLG G Flex2\n\n22\n\nSamsung Galaxy S6\n\n14\n\nMotorola Moto X (2014) Lollipop\n\n13\n\nSamsung Galaxy S5\n\n12\n\nMotorola Nexus 6\n\n11.9\n\nSamsung Galaxy Note 4 Lollipop\n\n11\n\nBasemark X\n\nHigher is better\n\nSamsung Galaxy S6\n\n27169\n\nMotorola Nexus 6\n\n20901\n\nSamsung Galaxy Note 4 Lollipop\n\n20043\n\nLG G Flex2\n\n19360\n\nMotorola Moto X (2014) Lollipop\n\n12190\n\nSamsung Galaxy S5\n\n11798\n\nFor web browsing performance we used the Internet app (stock web browser) as Samsung sprinkles proprietary optimization magic that's not available in Chrome or the vanilla Android browser. The Galaxy S6 wins the JavaScript race in Kraken 1.1 with a slight margin, less than we expected from the large lead in CPU performance.\n\nFor general web browsing BrowserMark 2.1 puts the Samsung flagship on par with Apple's iPhone 6 (and far ahead of the rest) despite having to render pages at QHD while the iPhone screen is barely over 720p.\n\nKraken 1.1\n\nLower is better\n\nSamsung Galaxy S6\n\n4154\n\nLG G Flex2\n\n4621\n\nSamsung Galaxy Note 4 Lollipop\n\n5181\n\nSamsung Galaxy S5\n\n5968\n\nMotorola Nexus 6\n\n6088\n\nMotorola Moto X (2014) Lollipop\n\n6260\n\nBrowserMark 2.1\n\nHigher is better\n\nSamsung Galaxy S6\n\n2718\n\nSamsung Galaxy Note 4 Lollipop\n\n2232\n\nLG G Flex2\n\n2086\n\nSamsung Galaxy S5\n\n2066\n\nMotorola Moto X (2014) Lollipop\n\n1562\n\nMotorola Nexus 6\n\n1447\n\nThe Samsung Galaxy S6 (and S6 edge for that matter) is the fastest mobile phone you can have at the moment and with 64-bit support in place this should remain the case for some time to come. The flagship offers top notch performance for any use case and may not be surpassed in 2015, looking at just the 5\" size (obviously the Note 5 is coming and should be a bit faster).\n\nSamsung Galaxy S6 storage performance test\n\nSamsung Galaxy S6 is the company's first flagship not to offer microSD expansion. Until the S6 and S6 edge duo all Galaxy Note and Galaxy S smartphones had memory expansion, and, in fact, it was one of the highlights of both series.\n\nSamsung even supported moving App to SD card even when Google disabled the feature - a rarity these days. So, what happened with Samsung's love of external storage?\n\nWell, the company came up with its own UFS 2.0 storage, which uses \"Command Queue\" tech (as seen in Solid State Drives) for accelerating the speed of command execution. The new technology promises 2.7x faster performance than the eMMC 5.0 memory found in the previous crop of flagships and yes, the Galaxy S6 has one.\n\nThere lies to the key to the lack of a microSD slot. If you were to put an SD card on your Galaxy S6, you'd have compromised this blazing-fast performance. This is actually true for all 2014 high-end phones, but it seems Samsung wanted users to truly feel the difference this time around and has decided on not including the storage expansion on the feature list even if it made a lot of users sad.\n\nLet's see how fast it really is.\n\nWe ran AndroBench - a popular storage benchmark, which gauges the read and write performance of sequential and random operations. Samsung promised the new UFC 2.0 storage in Galaxy S6 and S6 edge is 2.7x faster in random read than the one used on the Galaxy S5. We found it to be even better - the Galaxy S6 did 20000+ IOPS (input-output operations per second) at random read compared to 4800 IOPS of the Galaxy S5 on the same test. That's 3.25x times better.\n\nWe also put the microSD slot to test, using the fastest microSD card we had around - a Transcend Premium 300x microSDHC UHS-1 Class 10 16GB. We tested the microSD read/write performance on both the Galaxy S5 and Galaxy Note 4. This should give you the idea of the performance drop you get when apps are accessing the microSD card instead of the fast internal storage.\n\nThe test results clearly put the Galaxy S6 on top of the sequential and random read, with massive lead over the competition. It was also the champ in random read and write operations with small variations between it and the Galaxy S6 edge.\n\nAnd before you ask, all tested devices were on Android Lollipop. Also all tests were ran with h/w encryption turned off - which is the default setting under Android Lollipop.\n\nUpdate, April 3: We retested the storage with the retail unit we received. The pre-release unit had some issues with sequential write speeds, which have been resolved in the retail unit.\n\nSequential Read, MB/s\n\nHigher is better\n\nSamsung Galaxy S6 edge\n\n321.44\n\nSamsung Galaxy S6\n\n311.05\n\nLG G3\n\n239.68\n\nHTC One M9\n\n239.19\n\nSamsung Galaxy Note 4\n\n212.45\n\nSamsung Galaxy S5\n\n206.85\n\nSequential Write, MB/s\n\nHigher is better\n\nSamsung Galaxy S6 edge\n\n145.19\n\nSamsung Galaxy S6\n\n139.20\n\nSamsung Galaxy Note 4\n\n126.69\n\nHTC One M9\n\n123.97\n\nSamsung Galaxy S5\n\n56.31\n\nLG G3\n\n39.53\n\nRandom Read, MB/s\n\nMB/s, Higher is better\n\nSamsung Galaxy S6\n\n77.58\n\nSamsung Galaxy S6 edge\n\n76.79\n\nSamsung Galaxy Note 4\n\n22.10\n\nLG G3\n\n21.81\n\nHTC One M9\n\n20.27\n\nSamsung Galaxy S5\n\n18.79\n\nRandom Write, MB/s\n\nMB/s, Higher is better\n\nSamsung Galaxy S6 edge\n\n20.20\n\nSamsung Galaxy S6\n\n19.76\n\nHTC One M9\n\n13.93\n\nSamsung Galaxy Note 4\n\n10.71\n\nLG G3\n\n9.42\n\nSamsung Galaxy S5\n\n6.91\n\nThe Samsung Galaxy S6 edge (and S6 for that matter) is the fastest mobile phone you can have at the moment and with 64-bit support in place this should remain the case for some time to come. The flagship offers top notch performance for any use case and may not be surpassed in 2015, looking at just the 5\" size (obviously the Note 5 is coming and should be a bit faster).\n\nCloud storage can be just as effective for backups - being equally seamless when running in the background. And you do get 115GB worth of free OneDrive storage with each Galaxy S6, so that's a start, isn't it?"
