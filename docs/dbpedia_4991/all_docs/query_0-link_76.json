        "text": "Let me start by saying both phones really came hard at the world with their specifications, but obviously there has to be a winner here. The Android operated smartphones are the latest offerings from LG and Samsung and here are the features you need to look out for, or the few ones that set them apart;\n\nFeatures Samsung Galaxy S6 LG G4 Display 5.1″ Super AMOLED capacitive touchscreen 5.5″ IPS LCD capacitive touchscreen Weight 138g 155g Dimensions 143.4 x 70.5 x 6.8 mm 148.9 x 76.1 x 9.8 mm Memory and RAM 32/64/128 GB, 3 GB RAM, no microSD slot 32 GB, 3 GB RAM, expandable to 128GB by microSD card CPU Quad-core 1.5 GHz Cortex-A53 & Quad-core 2.1 GHz Cortex-A57 Dual-core 1.8 GHz Cortex-A57 & quad-core 1.44 GHz Cortex-A53 Chipset Exynos 7420 Qualcomm Snapdragon 808 Camera Rear: 16MP, Front: 5MP Rear: 16MP, front: 8MP Battery 2550mAh 300mAh\n\nClearly the LG G4 has a bigger screen than the Samsung Galaxy S6, weighs more and has a bigger battery so we expect slightly more battery life from the former.\n\nThe front camera in the Samsung Galaxy S6 may be better than it’s ever been in the Galaxy range of phones, but the LG G4 selfie snapper is also up there with it. The rear cameras may be of the same specifications, except in the G4 we see laser autofocus and optical image stabilization, with a dual-LED flash. The S6 camera however may boast of a panoramic view option, which the G4 would need 3rd party apps for.\n\nThe chipset in the S6 is Exynos 7420 is quite ahead of the Qualcomm Snapdragon 808 found in the LG G4, as seen from the performance results accumulated by WCCF Tech.\n\nThe Galaxy S6 also has a fingerprint scanner, something not yet explored by LG. It also has premium design with its glas back compared to the leather and plastic build of the G4.\n\nThe prices for both are expected to be in the same range so the price point is not a big comparison.\n\nWhat phone tickles your fancy so far?"
