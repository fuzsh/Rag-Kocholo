        "text": "Rumors surrounding a major design overhaul in the flagship smartphone line from Samsung were confirmed when the Galaxy S6 was launched on March 1. The device moved away from the oft-criticized plastic frame of its predecessor, the Galaxy S5, among other significant changes. Here is a comparison of the two phones:\n\nDesign\n\nSamsung made a huge shift in design by giving the Galaxy S6 a premium aluminum frame with rounded edges and Gorilla Glass 4 on its front and back. This not only gives the phone a premium look but also allows light to reflect beautifully off its back panel. As for the Galaxy S5, it has a plastic frame and soft touch plastic on its back panel that is covered with dimples.\n\nDisplay\n\nThe Galaxy S5 has a good display in the form of its super AMOLED screen measuring 5.1 inches with a resolution of 1080 x 1920 pixels and a density of 432 pixels per inch. But the Galaxy S6 improves on it with its super AMOLED screen, measuring 5.1 inches with a resolution of 1440 x 2560 pixels and a density of 577 pixels per inch.\n\nSpecs\n\nIn terms of specs, the Galaxy S6 has an Exynos 7420 chipset, coupled with four Cortex-A53 cores clocked at 1.5 GHz and four Cortex-A57 cores clocked at 2.1 GHz in its CPU and a Mali-T760 GPU. As for the Galaxy S5, it has a Qualcomm Snapdragon 801chipset, Quad-core 2.5 GHz Krait 400 CPU and Adreno 330 GPU.\n\nMemory\n\nA major difference between the devices is in their memory slots. The Galaxy S5 has one and it can be used to add 128 GB of external storage. The Galaxy S6 does not have one. As for RAM, the Galaxy S6 has 3 GB while the S5 has 2 GB.\n\nCamera\n\nThe Galaxy S6 and the Galaxy S5 both have a 16 megapixel camera on their backs, but the S6 camera has optical image stabilization and an improved lens from Sony which makes it the fastest smartphone camera in the market.\n\nPrice\n\nCurrent estimates peg the price of the Galaxy S6 around $699, while the Galaxy S5 costs $649."
