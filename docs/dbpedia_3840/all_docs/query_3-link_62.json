The sorrow comes from the loss of a loving mother and a community matriarch. The lightness comes from knowing that my mom has been freed from the painful burdens of advanced age. For those in the Keweenaw who knew my dad, Paul Freshwater, he of course penned a glowing obituary for my mom, left in meticulous analog and digital fashion, for me to publish upon her passing. His words sit below mine here in this piece. But first, I will take a few paragraphs to share my own reflections on the remarkable woman I got to call my mom.\n\nCOPPER HARBOR — The Copper Harbor Improvement Association held its 37th Annual Art in the Park at Donny Kilpela Memorial Park over the weekend.

Visiting historical museums or touring historical locations provides a feel of life in the 19th and early 20th century, but the Houghton County Historical Society, at its museum complex, in Lake Linden, is offering people the chance to step beyond visiting former places of work, and physically experience the work itself.\n\nEAGLE HARBOR, Mich. (WLUC) - Tucked away in the remote reaches of Michigan’s Upper Peninsula lies a treasure trove of history with stories waiting to be told.
