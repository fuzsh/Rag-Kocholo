        "text": "Eagle Harbor Township is a civil township of Keweenaw County in the U.S. state of Michigan. As of the 2000 census, the township population was 281. The irregularly-shaped township is located on the Keweenaw Peninsula and also includes the southern half of Isle Royale. The unincorporated community of Eagle Harbor is located in the township along Lake Superior on M-26.\n\nBrockway Mountain Drive is a 9.5 mile scenic route in the Keweenaw Peninsula of Michigan just west of Copper Harbor. Access to the road is gained from M-26 from either Eagle Harbor to the west or Copper Harbor to the east. The drive runs along a cliff on the Keweenaw Fault and climbs to a height of 1,328 feet above sea level, 726 feet above the surface of Lake Superior. Several turnouts along the route allow for views of Copper Harbor, Lake Superior and undeveloped woodland."
