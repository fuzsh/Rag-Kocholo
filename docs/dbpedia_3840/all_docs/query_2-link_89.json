        "text": "Michigan is now home to six designated National Parks, after the North Country National Scenic Trail earned placement on the national list for its 4,800-mile trail stretching from North Dakota to Vermont.\n\nThe North Country Trail is the longest in the National Trails System, with its Michigan leg being its longest stretch, reaching from 550 miles across the Upper Peninsula and across the Mackinac Bridge before crossing 600 miles deep into Ohio.\n\nUnder the new designation, the North Country Trail is available to greater resources and funding opportunities in addition to being included on the list of now 428 National Parks across the U.S.\n\nThe National Park Service operates five other national parks across the state, including lakeshores, a battlefield and a national heritage site — collectively attracting more than 2.5 million visitors every year.\n\nIsle Royale National Park\n\nLocation: Lake Superior, 55 miles off the coast of the Upper Peninsula's most northern town of Copper Harbor\n\nMajor Attraction: This national park is more than the main island, it includes a 400-island archipelago\n\nBest season to visit: Late summer, early fall\n\nHistory: Founded in 1940, Isle Royale National Park is the least-visited national park because of its hyper-remote location. Only accessible by watercraft, the ferry ride from the Keweenaw Peninsula can take up to three hours and the park remains closed during the colder fall and winter months. During peak summer weather visitors can take a kayak ride through the hundreds of tiny islands or take on a family-friendly backpacking and camping trip, falling asleep under the millions of glowing stars.\n\nKeweenaw National Historical Park\n\nLocation: Calumet, Michigan\n\nMajor Attraction: More than 20 historical heritage sites\n\nBest season to visit: Spring\n\nHistory: For nearly 7,000 years, copper mining was one of Michigan’s most important and lucrative industries. The U.P.’s Keweenaw County was dubbed Copper Country as copper could be found running nearly 15,000 feet deep. The island today has 21 historical heritage sites that tell the story of Michigan’s coal mining legacy; experiences include the opportunity to rappel down a mine shaft to experience the underground mines, drilling and blasting workshops firsthand or taking a self, or guided, tour of the 19th century Calumet Theater and Copper Country Firefighters History Museums.\n\nPictured Rocks National Lakeshore\n\nLocation: Munising, Michigan\n\nMajor Attraction: Tremendous natural rock formations over Lake Superior\n\nBest season to visit: Summer-Fall\n\nHistory: Stretching more than 40 miles to the edge of Lake Superior along the Upper Peninsula, the origin of Pictured Rock’s name does not take long to guess. Established in 1966 as the first national lakeshore in the country, the red and burgundy sandstone cliffs line the coast with waves of auburn. This national park location features more than 100 miles of trails, sand dunes, forests and at least seven waterfalls.\n\nRiver Raisin National Battlefield Park\n\nLocation: Monroe, Michigan\n\nMajor Attraction: Macon Indian Reservation\n\nBest season to visit: Spring-Summer\n\nHistory: This 81-acre park in Monroe, Michigan commemorates the battles of January 1813 during the War of 1812 that resulted in the greatest U.S. defeat to Britain. Following these battles, U.S. Indian laws forced the removal, relocation and assimilation of Native Americans in what many know as the Battle of Horseshoe Bend — the precursor to the Trail of Tears of 1830. Visitors can walk the 60-acre Macon Indian Reserve, established in 1807 by the Treaty of Detroit, or take a trip to Kentucky Memorial Place to witness the burial grounds of various people who walked the River Raisin area in the 1800s.\n\nSleeping Bear Dunes National Lakeshore\n\nLocation: Empire, Michigan\n\nMajor Attraction: Sand dunes\n\nBest season to visit: Fall-Spring"
