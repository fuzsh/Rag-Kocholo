        "text": "Getting to Grand Island\n\nWhether you come for the day or overnight camping, you can access the island much of the year by commercial ferry or private motorized or non-motorized watercraft. While much of the island’s 30-mile perimeter is inaccessible by watercraft because of its rugged sandstone cliffs, there are several day-use areas and campsites with water access. Before going to the island, you need to pay the day-use forest and camping fees. You can find fee prices, a map and additional visitor information here.\n\nUse the Grand Island Ferry Service.\n\nThe Grand Island Ferry Service runs regularly throughout each day between the Friday before Memorial Day and October 10. The mainland ferry dock is approximately 2.5 miles west of Munising’s blinking traffic light on M-28. Round-trip tickets include the Hiawatha National Forest access fee. Reservations are recommended but not required.\n\nArrive by private watercraft.\n\nYou can also access Grand Island by kayak or private motorized boat (no jet skis) when Lake Superior conditions are safe. No docks are available on the island, so you will need to beach or anchor your watercraft in a designated area at your own risk. Motorboats typically anchor in the bays. The island’s west side is subject to strong winds, so it is not advisable to moor or pull ashore there.\n\nReach the island in winter, too.\n\nIn the winter, you only can access Grand Island by snowmobile, skis, or snowshoes. You must travel across the ice at your own risk, as there are no guarantees that Lake Superior is solid or safe. Once you cross, you can enjoy Grand Island’s network of scenic roads and trails. If you want to rent a sled, cross-country skis or snowshoes, visit Munising’s snowmobile, cross-county ski and snowshoe shops before you go.\n\nTOP 10 THINGS TO DO ON GRAND ISLAND"
