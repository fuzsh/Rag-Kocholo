        "text": "I have a habit of daydreaming over maps.\n\nWhen I open my Rand McNally to pages 54 and 55, I see not just the enigmatic shape of Minnesota, but all of the places I've been and all of the places I've yet to explore.\n\nMy eyes have been drawn many times to the upper right-hand corner of the page, where a sliver of land in Lake Superior edges into view. A dotted line crosses the blue ink of the lake, connecting the land to the town of Grand Portage: the ferry route to Isle Royale National Park.\n\nWhat I hold in my hands is paper and ink; but in my mind, I see a boat, I see the oceanic expanse of Superior, I feel the boat rocking and spray coming over the bow. I see a low green landmass on the horizon: an island wilderness without cars or roads, without towns or telephone wires -- a place where moose and wolves are the most populous mammals for most of the year. Â¶ I have been on that boat in my mind many times.\n\nLast August, I put down the atlas and went to Isle Royale. A friend told me that the ferry to Isle Royale usually runs a little late. Not on the day I left. I got to the dock at 7:55 a.m., and I was the 48th passenger on the boat, which was loaded to capacity. We left at 7:56.\n\nInstead of picking up the ferry as it heads directly back to Grand Portage, I got on it a day early, so I could circumnavigate the island. It was a six-hour ride to Rock Harbor on calm water in a half-empty ferry. Mile after mile, the rocky shore unreeled past the rail. Rock Harbor, with a ranger station, small hotel, bar and restaurant and dozens of people milling about, seemed hopelessly busy after the solitude of Huginnin Cove. Instead of the murmur of Lake Superior, I fell asleep to the sound of other campers playing cards next door."
