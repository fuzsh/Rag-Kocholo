        "text": "Houghton, Mich — Isle Royale National Park Superintendent Phyllis Green pounced when she learned in 2007 that an invasive virus deadly to dozens of freshwater fish species was creeping toward her island — a reef-rimmed wildlife refuge in the biggest, coldest and wildest of the Great Lakes.\n\nGreen instantly focused on the island's coaster brook trout — a beleaguered species that once numbered in the millions in Lake Superior but is now counted by the hundreds.\n\n\"If you have only 500 fish and you have a disease that can kill fish by the tons, your motivation is pretty strong, especially if your job is to preserve and protect,\" she says.\n\nGreen went to the captain of the Ranger III, which ferries park passengers to the island, 73 miles from its home port of Houghton on Michigan's Upper Peninsula. Worried that the ship might suck the virus up into its ballast tanks while docked at the mainland, she asked if there were any way to disinfect the water sloshing in the bowels of the ship before it was released in park waters.\n\nThe captain said no.\n\n\"What happens,\" she replied, \"if I tell you that you can't move this ship unless you kill everything in your ballast tanks?\"\n\nThat's when the brainstorming started. Green sat down with the captain, the ship's engineer and a professor at Michigan Technological University who had worked on water purification systems for the International Space Station to try to figure out how to make the Ranger III safe to sail.\n\n\"This is not rocket science,\" the professor told the group.\n\nTwo weeks later, Isle Royale's passenger ship had a crude ballast treatment system that used chlorine to fry viruses and other life lurking in the 37,000-gallon ballast tanks, and then vitamin C to neutralize the poison so the ship-steadying water could be harmlessly discharged into the lake.\n\nGreen didn't stop there. She leveraged her authority as protector of Isle Royale to block all ballast discharges within a 4.5 mile radius of the island, which happened to include shipping lanes used by freighters sailing into the Canadian port of Thunder Bay.\n\nThe Park Service has since installed a permanent ballast treatment system on the Ranger III that uses filtration and UV light, a first for the Great Lakes.\n\nWhile the Ranger III is almost toy-sized compared with some of the freighters that ply the Great Lakes, Green contends the relatively simple chlorine treatment can be scaled up to the biggest boats on the lakes as an emergency line of defense for the world's largest freshwater system. This is something she says is definitely needed, because the door to future invasions from Seaway ships remains wide open.\n\nGreen says her success can be traced back to her tough edict to the captain of the Ranger III: Shape up the ship, or don't sail.\n\nThe federal government so far has refused to take that hard line.\n\nThe U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, after being sued more than a decade ago by conservationists to treat ballast water like any other industrial pollutant under the Clean Water Act, issued a new permit in December requiring oceangoing ships sailing into the Great Lakes to decontaminate ballast water with treatment systems using such things as UV light, de-oxygenation, chemicals and filters. Someday.\n\nThe industry has been given years to install the treatment systems; some ships likely won't have to have them on board until after 2020.\n\nStill, officials with the St. Lawrence Seaway are already hinting that the timeline is too tight for the shipping industry to comply.\n\n\"I'd use the term ambitious,\" says Craig Middlebrook, deputy administrator for the St. Lawrence Seaway Development Corporation, which manages the U.S. portion of the navigation network linking the Great Lakes to the Atlantic Ocean.\n\n\"Is it doable? We're going to see.\"\n\nConservationists are flabbergasted that anyone can be fretting that the deadlines might be too tight.\n\nClean Water Act permits are typically issued for five-year periods. The new permit for the shipping industry doesn't require ballast treatment systems to be installed until larger ships are pulled from the water for their first \"dry dock\" maintenance after 2016. A ship can go five years between dry dockings, so a vessel that goes out of the water for maintenance in late 2016 could wait until sometime around 2021 to install the equipment.\n\n\"It's laughable,\" says Marc Smith of the National Wildlife Federation, one of the groups that have sued the EPA over what they call \"feckless\" ballast regulations.\n\nThe best defense for the Great Lakes at the moment is a rule requiring overseas ships sailing up the St. Lawrence Seaway to flush their ballast tanks with a blast of mid-ocean saltwater to expel or destroy biological stowaways.\n\nThe rule, which was enthusiastically supported by the shipping industry, went into effect for all overseas ships visiting the Great Lakes in 2008. No new organisms have been discovered in the Great Lakes since, the longest lull between invasive species discoveries since the Seaway opened in 1959.\n\n\"The program appears to be working,\" the Seaway's Middlebrook says. \"We wish there were more years to establish that, but we take it for the available data we have.\"\n\nEveryone agrees the rule has likely gone a long way toward stemming the onslaught of invasions the lakes suffered in the 1990s and early 2000s, but most ecologists who study the lakes agree with Green that the door to new invasions remains open.\n\nMiddlebrook himself does not dispute this.\n\n\"It's one element of the piece of mitigating the risk\" of future invasions, he said of tank flushing. \"Moving toward treatment systems further mitigates that risk.\"\n\nThe federal government has a list of more than 30 species that are a risk to invade the lakes in ship ballast tanks, despite the ballast flushing requirements, and researchers say that list is likely to grow.\n\nOn the watch list is the notorious Dikerogammarus villosus, otherwise known as the killer shrimp. The murderous crustacean got its name for good reason; it makes a mess of the ecosystems it invades by destroying native species with its vise-like jaws and then leaving them for dead, often without even swallowing a bite.\n\nThe U.S. Army Corps of Engineers characterizes them this way:\n\n\"Behavior is particularly vicious and destructive, killing and maiming unselectively.\"\n\nThe killer shrimp, which can grow bigger than an inch and are native to the Caspian Sea region, have been marching through the shipping channels lacing Europe for decades and in 2010 turned up in large numbers in an English reservoir. Studies show they have a salt tolerance just slightly below what is typically found in the ocean, meaning there is perhaps only a membrane-thin margin of protection against another wave of destruction to hit the Great Lakes.\n\n\"The point I'd make as a biologist, ecologist and a person living in the Great Lakes is that I think we should do everything feasible to put that risk as close to zero as possible,\" says biologist Gary Fahnenstiel, who spent 30 years working for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. \"Because we know there are a whole bunch of species out there, one being the killer shrimp, that could cause all kinds of damage in the Great Lakes.\"\n\nThere are a host of salt-tolerant fish species that could be in the same boat as the killer shrimp, and their numbers are growing.\n\nResearchers at SUNY-Buffalo State just this summer released a study revealing that Great Lakes scientists have overlooked dozens of potential fish invaders from the Caspian and Black Sea region, known as the Ponto-Caspian basin. One of the reasons these species escaped the notice of North American scientists is due to a language barrier to Russian research — research that paints a potentially distressing picture for the future of the Great Lakes.\n\n\"The rich biota of the Ponto-Caspian region, coupled with a high volume of commercial shipping trafﬁc strongly suggests that this region will continue to be a major source of invasive species to the Great Lakes,\" the researchers wrote in the article that appeared in the Journal of Great Lakes Research.\n\nThe researchers identified eight fish species they consider a medium to high risk to survive a ballast tank flush because of their salt tolerance, including the monkey goby, cousin to the invasive round goby, and the snakelike black-striped pipefish.\n\nFor Fahnenstiel, now on the faculty at Michigan Tech, if closing the door to more invasions means stopping overseas ships from entering the Great Lakes until they can solve their ballast problem, so be it.\n\n\"It's a reasonable alternative, absolutely,\" he said. \"The shipping industry may not view it that way, but I guarantee you the people that love the Great Lakes view it as a reasonable alternative.\"\n\nThe Seaway's Middlebrook acknowledges the concept may be appealing to people outside the shipping industry, but says that is because they don't understand the complexity of the problem.\n\n\"I know there is clarity to the idea, to achieve one goal, perhaps\" he said. \"But we're in such a complex interrelated system that the challenges are daunting.\"\n\nYet it may be the overseas shipping industry itself that misunderstands its economic relevance in the equation.\n\nIt is hard to grasp the euphoria that gripped the region the day the world's longest deep draft inland waterway opened the Great Lakes to the world.\n\nThe Seaway — a Canadian and U.S.-owned system of locks, dams and navigation channels that tamed the roaring St. Lawrence River — allowed ships to climb nearly 600 feet from sea level to reach cities like Cleveland, Chicago, Milwaukee and Detroit, all previously inaccessible to deep-draft ocean freighters. At the time, industrialists and shippers predicted the region's economy would be transformed by directly linking the Midwest's manufacturing muscle to ports around the globe.\n\nBut the biggest transformation turned out to be ecological.\n\nToday, most of the world's shipping fleet never sails into the Seaway because its locks and channels are too small for the world's big cargo boats. An Army Corps report pushing for a Seaway expansion in 2002 revealed it was able to accommodate only about 2% of the cargo-carrying capacity of the world's bulk carrier fleet. The size of ocean freighters has been ballooning ever since. A Panama Canal expansion expected to be finished next year will enable that passage to handle vessels almost 500 feet longer, double the width and nearly double the depth of the biggest ships that can squeeze into the Seaway.\n\nThe Seaway today is a cobblestone road in a freeway world, and one that is only open seasonally — it must shut down three months each winter due to ice, a devastating drawback for a navigation corridor trying to thrive in a world where finished goods flow around the clock, and around the calendar.\n\nThe reality of the state of the Seaway is revealed by the relative lack of overseas ship activity on the docks of the Port of Milwaukee. In the past five years, the port has received an average of 34 overseas ships each year, or less than one per week during shipping season. The port occasionally receives or sends out heavy machinery, things like windmill components or mining equipment. But, like the other Great Lakes ports, it typically handles relatively low-value bulk materials.\n\nPort officials reported that in 2012 they handled 142,952 metric tons of what they classify as \"international\" cargo, though their average for that class of cargo for several years prior was about double that. There are modern ocean freighters that can carry that tonnage in a single trip.\n\nAnd how does Milwaukee's overseas shipping business stack up against some of the country's busiest ports? In 2012, the Port of Los Angeles alone handled 174 million tons — well over 1,000 times the overseas tonnage that moved across Milwaukee's piers that year.\n\nNobody disputes that Great Lakes shipping is a big, critically important business. But the vast majority of the cargo moved on the Great Lakes and Seaway — things like salt, iron ore, coal, cement — is carried by U.S. and Canadian domestic freighters, called \"lakers,\" that tote bulk materials from one Canadian or U.S. port to another. Overseas vessels, known as \"salties,\" typically account for maybe 5% of the overall tonnage moved annually on the Great Lakes and St. Lawrence Seaway.\n\nSalties typically haul in steel, iron, sugar and other bulk industrial products and haul out mostly grain, but not much of it. The total grain exports overseas vessels took out of the Seaway in 2011 was 2.25 million tons, well under 2% of the overall U.S. and Canadian grain exports that year.\n\n\"In the grand scheme of things, the Great Lakes are never a big factor in our grain export program for the U.S.,\" said Jay O'Neil, an agriculture economist for the International Grains Program at Kansas State University.\n\nThe primary pathway for grain exports is the Gulf of Mexico, which in a typical year handles up to 70% of the nation's grain exports. Much of the rest heads for Asia from ports in the Pacific Northwest. A sliver leaves from the Atlantic Coast.\n\n\"The lakes are always in that small, single-digit percentage,\" said O'Neil, who has studied the grain industry for the past 40 years.\n\n\"That's just the competitive nature of things ... and I certainly would not anticipate that changing in the future.\"\n\nThe Seaway's overseas traffic is not only minuscule in a continental context, it is also small in a logistical sense; the total tonnage carried annually by ocean vessels sailing into and out of the Great Lakes is roughly equal to what can be hauled annually by a single daily inbound and outbound train from the East Coast.\n\nIf that train delivered so much ecological havoc in the Great Lakes, it is unlikely the public would still allow it to be running down the tracks. Fahnenstiel argues for a similarly tough approach to the overseas ships visiting the Great Lakes.\n\n\"Hey, I feel sorry for them,\" Fahnenstiel says of the overseas ship owners. \"But then again, are they mitigating the cost of the zebra and quagga mussel invasion?\"\n\nThere are, of course, other pathways for invasions to take hold in the Great Lakes, such as bait bucket dumping, aquarium releases and intentional plantings. Regional freighters that sail from the lakes into the St. Lawrence River or out to the East Coast and back into the lakes are also a potential carrier of unwanted organisms. But contaminated ballast water from overseas vessels has been the primary pathway for Great Lakes invasions since the Seaway opened over a half century ago.\n\nContaminated freighter ballast water is also not just a Great Lakes problem. It has been linked to a cholera outbreak two decades ago that killed more than 10,000 people in South America. It's a likely reason Chinese mitten crabs are swarming San Francisco Bay and why a softball-sized snail from Asia called the veined rapa whelk is creeping across the Chesapeake Bay.\n\nBut guarding the Atlantic and Pacific coasts from these invaders is a far more daunting task, both because of the volume of overseas freighter traffic servicing the coasts and their geographical vastness.\n\nThe Great Lakes themselves are wrapped by more than 10,000 miles of shoreline, every mile of which is vulnerable to the biological mischief ferried in by overseas ships.\n\nBut unlike the Atlantic or Pacific Coasts, there is, literally, a door to the Great Lakes that every Seaway ship must pass through before arriving at the dozens of ports rimming the Great Lakes' shores.\n\nIt's called the St. Lambert Lock at Montreal. Every ship — and every one of the Great Lakes invaders it may be carrying — has to squeeze through this 80-foot-wide pinch point before it sails up the Seaway and into the Great Lakes.\n\nThe door is owned by Canada, which has made it clear that it is not about to shut it to overseas traffic anytime soon. The Canadian government protested ferociously when the state of New York tried to implement its own ballast water regulations in 2010 far tougher than those now adopted by the EPA.\n\nBut some Canadian officials have already supported the idea of shutting cargo vessels out of the lakes as a strategy to protect them from invasive species.\n\nThe Province of Ontario backed five Great Lakes states in 2009 that sued to force closure of U.S. locks near Chicago's Lake Michigan shoreline. Closing this man-made \"back door\" to the lakes is recognized as the most effective way to stop Asian carp and other unwanted species from moving between the Great Lakes and the Mississippi River basin, which spans 40% of the continental United States.\n\nUnder pressure from the public and Great Lakes politicians to stop the advance of Asian carp, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers has also broached the idea in a plan it released earlier this year to restore the natural separation between Lake Michigan and the Mississippi. Yet why put a screen on the back door if you are going to leave the front door open?\n\nThere are some remarkable parallels between the fight to close these front and back doors.\n\nIn recent years, the volume of cargo moving through portions of the Chicago canal that would be plugged in the Army Corps plan has been under 8 million tons — less than 1% of the freight that moves annually through the Chicago region. Just a little more than the 6.9 million tons of overseas cargo that has moved, on average, through the Seaway annually over the last five years.\n\n\"If we're going to attempt to cork Chicago ... to stop other species, we have to close all the doors,\" says Smith of the National Wildlife Federation. \"I don't know what's being done to look at the economic impact of what it would take to not allow salties into the Great Lakes and force them to transfer their cargo.\"\n\nThe owners of the salties say their business is too critical to the regional economies to even consider this.\n\n\"It's just not realistic, the expectation that the Seaway is going to be closed to international shipping,\" said Georges Robichon, an attorney for Montreal-based ship owner Fednav, which is heavily invested in international shipping on the Great Lakes. \"There's too much commerce associated with the goods that we take out of the Great Lakes ... and the goods we bring into the Great Lakes.\"\n\nBut is there?\n\nIn 2005, two Michigan transportation experts took the first crack at what it would cost to bring the Seaway's overseas cargo into the region by other means. The figure they came up with was $55 million annually to transfer the salties' tonnage onto trucks, rail or other boats.\n\nThe study passed muster with the experts who peer-reviewed it. In fact, the reviewers said if anything the $55 million was an overestimate.\n\nThat figure was reached at a time when it was assumed more than 12 million tons of overseas cargo floated on the Seaway. Over the past five years the average annual tonnage has dropped to less than 7 million tons.\n\nAnd what about the other side of the ledger, the economic cost of Seaway invasions?\n\nThe overall toll just to municipalities and power companies trying to keep their pipes mussel-free over the last quarter century tops $1.5 billion. This figure is \"conservative\" and does not give a complete picture of the problem, according to Chuck O'Neill, director of National Aquatic Nuisance Species Clearinghouse at Cornell University, who conducted a landmark survey of the mussels' costs.\n\nO'Neill said that $1.5 billion figure, tallied in 2008, is almost certainly lower than the actual costs because it does not include impacts to manufacturers who typically declined to participate in his survey.\n\nBeyond clogging pipes, the dollar toll for the ecological unraveling of the lake due to ballast water invasions, in terms of damage to fisheries and other recreation activities, has been pegged in a separate study from the University of Notre Dame at about $2 billion per decade.\n\nNeither of these studies includes the mussel costs that are spreading across the country, and they are spreading. The EPA, in preparing its economic data for the new ballast treatment requirements, cited a study that blames zebra mussels for destroying the Mississippi River basin's $3 billion native shellfish industry.\n\n\"Literally billions of dollars have been spent and will be in the future responding to the devastation wrought by zebra and quagga mussels. Yet we have failed to consider the option of closing the St. Lawrence Seaway in order to protect an industry that provides just a fraction of the Great Lakes shipping commerce,\" said Todd Ambs, a former administrator for the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources' water division who now works for a coalition of conservation organizations.\n\n\"The solution could be simple,\" he added. \"You could force the salties to offload their cargo at a point of entry into the lakes. Then have the governments compensate the shipping industry for it. I don't know why we can't have that conversation to see if it's feasible.\"\n\nIt's a conversation with national implications, because when the Seaway doors swing open to a virulent invader like the quagga mussel, the whole continent can suffer.\n\n\"My biggest concern all along was the potential of the mussels getting into the California water system,\" said Cornell's O'Neill. \"The state's waterways are so interconnected and water use is so high that impacts on just that single state could be staggering if the critter gets ahead of them.\"\n\nThe length places like California, Utah and Washington have gone to stop that from happening is nothing short of stunning.\n\nWesterners seem to have learned from the Great Lakes' mistakes, because for them infesting a water body isn't merely considered an unfortunate cost of doing business.\n\nIt's considered a felony."
