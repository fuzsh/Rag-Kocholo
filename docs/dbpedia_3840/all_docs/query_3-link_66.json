        "text": "EAGLE HARBOR, Mich. (WLUC) - A bright and sunny morning welcomed roughly 500 residents and visitors to Eagle Harbor as it kicked off its township fourth of July celebration.\n\nThis celebration has been held since 1969, for 55 years. Today’s celebration began with a parade through town, with many riding in golf carts and fire trucks, dressed up in a variety of costumes. Then, there was a costume contest before people could enjoy games in the township Ball Yard.\n\n“We’ve got frisbee tosses, we’ve got dashes, we’ve got tug of war later, we’ve got canoe races, we’ve got pie eating contests,” said Eagle Harbor Fourth of July Public Address Announcer Dave Ellis. “It’s pretty much soup to nuts.”\n\nBeyond today, there will also be the 44th annual ‘Popeye Run’, a free 5k and 10k race into Eagle Harbor, on Saturday.\n\nAccording to Ellis, family is a major part of the celebration. An example comes from Rodney Westlake, whose birthday is also today. His experience with the celebration has come full circle.\n\n“Me and my dad did all of these events, now I get to do all of the events with my children, like parent-son races, parent-daughter races, it’s a blast, it’s the best,” said Westlake. “Our children are much improved versions,” added Ross Freshwater, a fellow homeowner.\n\nThat’s where my coverage of the celebration originally ended. But there was one last surprise for me, from Rodney’s children, Lucy and Jack. According to them, the town has been without organized fireworks for years, which they enjoyed as kids. However, this year, they decided to take matters into their own hands. According to Jack, just four days ago, they wrote on the town’s Facebook group chat, asking for Venmo donations to purchase the fireworks.\n\n“We ended up raising $1,500 towards these fireworks, and that just shows the commitment of the community, and how much everybody loves it,” continued Jack. “We ended up with some really great stuff,” added Lucy. “So, we’ll see how it goes tonight, but we’re really excited.”\n\nDue to discounts and deals, the group walked away with $3,000 worth of fireworks. The group plans to fire them off at 10 P.M. this evening."
