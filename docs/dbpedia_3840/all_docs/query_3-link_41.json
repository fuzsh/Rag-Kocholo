        "text": "Situated in the Western Upper Peninsula of Michigan, Eagle Harbor, nestled on\n\nthe south shore of Lake Superior in Michigan's Keweenaw Peninsula, is one of\n\nmany of it's uniquely beautiful places. The area has a rich copper mining history\n\nwith many preserved historically significant features. So it gets it's name\n\n\"The Copper Country.\" The Keweenaw National Historical Park commemorates\n\nthe copper mining history of the Keweenaw. Geologically, the rocks known as\n\nthe Keweenaw lava-flows are the oldest known at more than one and a half\n\nbillion years old and contribute to the areas unique topography. The topography\n\nranges from sandy and rocky shorelines to rugged hills reaching to mountains\n\nand the beautiful Brockway Mountain drive. Overall, it is truly a magical place.\n\nI hope my photo-interpretation gives you a glimpse of it's beauty.\n\nEnjoy and protect! Enjoy the Keweenaw Peninsula."
