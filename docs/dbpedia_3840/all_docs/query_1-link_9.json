However, its impacts are difficult to assess given the fluidity of traveler behavior. Join researchers from the University of Michigan's Economic Growth Institute (EGI) for a presentation on a year-long economic impact study of the Western Upper Peninsula's visitor economy. Beginning in January 2023, EGI researchers have collected visitor spending and activity data in the six counties of the Western Upper Peninsula. The presentation will share their findings on how the tourism industry impacts the region's economy and digs into seasonal differences in spending, activities, visitor satisfaction, and more. The presentation will be informative for all audiences, but particularly local officials, economic development organizations, area businesses, and organizations who provide services and programs to visitors.\n\nEnhancing Accessible Tourism\n\nDate: March 26th, 2024 @ Noon\n\nLocation: Keweenaw Community Foundation, 236 Quincy St, Hancock, MI 49930\n\nPresentation Slides\n\nProgram Description\n\nThe Keweenaw attracts community members and visitors who love nature, small towns, and the Copper Country's rich history. Access to these amenities is an important way of life for those who live and visit here. Preserving access to special places as our community members age-in-place is critical to preserving the local way of life for many. Join representatives from the Accessible Keweenaw Initiative (AKI) as they update the community on their efforts to enhance the accessibility of the region’s collection of recreation and cultural amenities. A facilitated panel discussion will cover topics such as the need for local accessibility investments, available resources for community planning, and the group’s progress over the past year.\n\nAKI is a coalition of community members, organizations, and subject matter experts. The coalition is responsible for identifying priority sites, assisting with pursuing funding for site improvements, and sharing information with the broader community about places residents and visitors can go that are barrier-free.\n\nSustainability in Stages: A Practice in Continuous Improvement\n\nDate: January 5th, 2024 @ Noon\n\nLocation: Keweenaw Community Foundation, 236 Quincy St, Hancock, MI 49930\n\nProgram Description\n\nThe Rozsa Center for the Performing Arts, nestled in the vibrant Keweenaw region, stands as a unique hub for artistic expression, showcasing talents from across the Midwest and beyond.
