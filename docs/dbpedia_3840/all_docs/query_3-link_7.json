        "text": "EAGLE HARBOR\n\nArea Guide\n\nTHIS QUIET HARBOR TOWN HAS MORE TO OFFER THAN YOU MAY THINK.\n\nEagle Harbor used to be a main stop for maritime traffic across Lake Superior as it was equally distant from Sault Ste. Marie to Duluth. Today, the small cottage community offers visitors a taste of slow travel thanks to Its freshwater access and outdoor amenities.\n\nAccessed by M-26 and lying between Copper Harbor and Eagle River, visitors to Eagle Harbor will want to take it slow. Its rugged coastline outside of town make offers great agate hunting, but its the sandy beach in town that calls for countless hours of relaxation. The Eagle Harbor Lighthouse and the Life Saving Museum both share the community's maritime history with visitors, and numerous nearby hiking trails offer miles of quiet wilderness exploration. Be sure to grab a drink and try the Lobster Pizza at the Eagle Harbor Inn to cap off a rejuvenating visit."
