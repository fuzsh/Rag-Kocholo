        "text": "Keweenaw County has a diverse landscape, ranging from forests, lakes, rivers and over 400 miles of shoreline on Lake Superior! Isle Royale National Park is one of the most notable places within the county, and is actually located further north in Lake Superior, only 15 miles from the Canadian coast. There are no roads, very little reception, and it is a true outdoor-living experience. The only way to get there is by ferry or seaplane, both of which depart from the Keweenaw Peninsula. Another notable place in Keweenaw County is the Keweenaw National Historical Park, which preserves the region's mining heritage. If you’re looking for both history and wildlife, Keweenaw County is a great place to explore!\n\nToday, Keweenaw County's economy is primarily driven by tourism, outdoor recreation, and small-scale local businesses. The decline of the copper mining industry led to a shift towards a service-oriented economy, with many residents involved in hospitality, retail, and recreational services. Living in Keweenaw County offers a tranquil and close-knit community atmosphere, with a slower pace of life compared to urban areas. Residents enjoy a high quality of life with access to pristine natural environments, historical sites and a strong sense of local heritage."
