The updates come from a combination of creel clerks and other DNR staff around the state and reflect past fishing conditions over the last seven days. Due to the nature of the Great Lakes, fishing conditions on them can change daily if not hourly based on wind and rain events. The weekly fishing report is no longer available by voice recording. You can subscribe to receive the report by submitting your email below."
