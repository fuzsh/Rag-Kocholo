        "text": "From around the Midwest and country visitors flock to the Keweenaw Peninsula for incredible recreation opportunities and small towns to relax in. But some visitors are out late at night chasing a different rush with the dancing colors of the aurora borealis.\n\nStarting today in Eagle Harbor is the township’s official international Dark Sky Week, celebrating the area’s unique location that regularly sees the northern lights. Eagle Harbor’s board of trustees encourages curiosity about dark skies, believing excessive light pollution can disrupt the beauty and inspiration of seeing stars, constellations, meteor showers, and northern lights. Across the United States, excess lighting amounts to roughly 3 billion dollars of wasted energy usage. Eagle Harbor’s International Dark Sky Week will last from today until the 8th.\n\nThose interested in learning more about Dark Skies in Michigan, Dark Sky Parks, Northern Light chasing opportunities, and more about the night sky can find more information below.\n\nEagle Harbor Township Proclamation\n\nState of Michigan Dark Sky Parks Information\n\nKeweenaw Dark Sky Park"
