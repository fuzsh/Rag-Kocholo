        "text": "Ready for a camping excursion where you’ll truly feel worlds away? Try camping on an island.\n\nMichigan is home to a number of islands that allow campers to linger after the last ferry leaves for the day, affording a truly secluded escape and opening up possibilities for deeper connection to the land, the stars, the waters surrounding you and the fellow campers lucky enough to be along for the ride.\n\nFrom car-friendly to car-free, the following Michigan islands are ready to welcome you for a camping adventure like none other, whether you’re looking for a new RV spot or are ready to tackle a multi-day backcountry trek. Read on for eight Michigan islands open to camping:\n\nLime Island Recreation Area: This 932-acre island in the St. Marys River is one of Michigan’s newer state recreation areas, with a wildly diverse history that dates back some 4,000 years, according to the DNR. Highlights include secluded beaches, hiking trails, freighter watching, a century-old schooner shipwreck, historic lime kilns, and nesting habitat for the state-threatened common tern. Tent camping is available at designated sites, including on wooden platforms; the island also has historic cabins for rent through the DNR. Note that you’ll need a motorized boat, or to charter one, to make the two-mile crossing to the island. Details here\n\nNorth Manitou Island: A secluded and sparsely visited gem at Sleeping Bear Dunes National Lakeshore, North Manitou Island offers primitive camping amid 15,000 acres of true wilderness. Your journey begins with a roughly 1.5-hour ferry voyage via Manitou Island Transit, after which the island is yours to explore: miles of hiking trails, ghost towns, beautiful bluffs with breathtaking views. The island’s Village Campground offers eight designated campsites; the rest is open to backcountry camping with a permit. Regulations and more details here\n\nSouth Manitou Island: South Manitou Island is North Manitou’s slightly more social twin, with three designated primitive campgrounds ranging in size from seven to 28 sites. While many visitors opt to visit South Manitou as a day-trip destination, camping here really lets you soak up the incredible scenery and gives you more time to explore the island’s many gems, including an old-growth cedar forest and the still-visible Francisco Morazan shipwreck. More details here\n\nBeaver Island: Rich in history and natural beauty, Lake Michigan’s largest island sits about 30 miles northwest of the ferry dock in Charlevoix. Unlike most of the islands on this list, Beaver Island allows vehicles — and if you want to see as much of the scenery as possible, renting or bringing your car (or at the very least, an off-road-worthy bicycle) is a must. On the island you’ll find two township-run rustic campgrounds (Saint James Township Campground takes reservations; Bill Wagner Peaine Township Campground is first come, first served) as well as Beaver Island Retreat, an award-winning glamping destination. For more, visit beaverisland.org/camping.\n\nDrummond Island: This pristine outdoors paradise off the eastern edge of the Upper Peninsula offers an escape from the everyday without giving up conveniences, such as grocery stores. The island has several campgrounds, including resort-style spots with full hookups for RVs. Activities include kayaking, fishing, birding, rock hunting, and exploring the ORV trails (Drummond is home to the largest DNR-sponsored closed-loop ORV system in the state). Getting there is just a short car ferry ride from the village of DeTour on the mainland.

There are 36 designated campgrounds with water sources and outhouses (and, in some cases, shelters and picnic tables), all accessible only by foot or watercraft. The rest of the park is a wilderness paradise, home to moose and wolves, and endless opportunities for hiking, fishing, paddling, stargazing, wildlife watching and more. Experts strongly recommend you do your research to be fully prepared for this kind of trip, as weather can sometimes affect travel to and from the park, unexpectedly extending stays.

Take the ferry and enjoy hiking, swimming, fishing and biking the island’s trails and two-tracks. As part of Hiawatha National Forest, the island’s campsites require reservations, which must be made through the Recreation.gov website. More details on Grand Island here.\n\nPower Island: Power Island and its isthmus-connected sister island, Bassett, comprise 202 acres of undeveloped forest maintained jointly as a quiet nature preserve about 3.5 miles from Bowers Harbor in Traverse City. A popular destination for day trips by boat, the dual island is also home to 15 rustic campsites for overnights, plus five miles of trails and three miles of shoreline with some excellent swimming spots. You’ll need your own motorized boat to get there though; traveling to the island by kayak without guidance is highly discouraged for all but the most experienced paddlers. Campsite reservations must be made through Grand Traverse County’s website.\n\nRELATED:\n\nLeland Blue stone: What is this beach treasure everyone is looking for Up North?\n\nWhy Michigan is seeing the Northern Lights more often"
