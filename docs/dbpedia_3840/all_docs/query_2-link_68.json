Elements of a Local Recreation Plan ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS This project was made possible by a cooperative eff ort of the Keweenaw County Board of Commissioners, the Keweenaw County Planning Commission, and the Division of Land Resource Programs of the Michigan Department of Natural Resources. Funds for this project were made available by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, U.S. Department of Commerce, as administered through the Division of Land Resource Programs, Michigan Department of Natural Resources. Local match to this project was provided by Keweenaw County, the Louisiana-Pacific Corporation, Longyear Realty, the Copper Range Company, the Copmead Corporation, and Upper Peninsula Power. Appreciation is extended to all those who participated in this planning effort, including Ray Clark from the Cooperative Extension Service and Ron Kinnenun from the Michigan. Sea Grant Program. THIS PLAN IS DEDICATED TO THE RESIDENTS OF KEWEENAW COUNTY, ESPECIALLY THOSE WHO TOOK THE TIME TO. PARTICIPATE IN THE VOTER SURVEY, ATTEND THE PUBLIC WORKSHOPS ON THIS PLAN, OR WHO IN OTHER WAYS HAVE EXPRESSED THEIR CONCERN ABOUT THE FUTURE OF OUR UNIQUE AND BEAUTIFUL AREA. Special thanks for assistance on this project go to: Michael Scieszka and Sherman Hollander for doing the aerial photograph interpretation and computer mapping; Janet Griffin for word processing assistance; and to Michael Kessler for the report cover -design. David Warner provided technical assistance to the Keweenaw County Planning Commission and was the author of the report. Additional thanks go to Sue Crispin of the Natural Features Inventory for authoring the chapter on special-natural features of Keweenaw County. FORWARD In fall of 1982, Keweenaw County planning officials approached the staff of the Michigan Coastal Management Program seeking assistance with certain local zoning issues along the Lake Superior shoreline. This initial effort led to a proposal to develop a shoreland management plan for Keweenaw County, to be largely supported through coastal management funds. Such a plan would provide direction to local officials in their decision-making with regards to development along the Lake Superior shoreline. At the beginning of the planning process, it was apparent that very little information was compiled or available on the county's natural resource base. To remedy this situation, base maps and land use/cover maps (based on the interpretation of aerial photographs) were developed on the computer assisted geographic information system operated by the Michigan Resource Inventory Program. With these maps, along with other resource information, as a base, the Lake Superior shoreline of Keweenaw County could now be studied. Six public workshops were held (two each in the months of June, August and October) by the Planning Commission to establish goals for the shoreland management plan and to make specific development recommendations. It is intended that this shoreland management plan be only an element of a larger comprehensive plan for the county. KEWEENAW COUNTY SHORELAND MANAGEMENT PLAN PURPOSE The purpose of the Keweenaw County Shoreland Management Plan is to promote the wise use and management of coastal resources along the county's Lake Superior shoreline. It is intended that this plan be a special element of a larger comprehensive plan for Keweenaw County. STUDY AREA The focus of this plan is on the strip of land bordering the Lake Superior shoreline and leading inland a distance of approximately two miles. Isle Royale, although part of Keweenaw County, was not included in the study area because it is a National Park, owned and administered by the U.S. government, outside of local jurisdiction. KEWEENAW COUNTY Keweenaw County is Michigan's northernmost county, and considered by many residents and visitors to be the state's most scenic and beautiful area. The county is bordered on the west, north and east by Lake Superior, and on the south by Houghton County. Keweenaw is characterized by mountains, rocky shores, sand and agate beaches, extensive forests, and numerous historical sites. HISTORY The Chippewa (Ojibway) Indians roamed and hunted in the western Upper Peninsula region prior to exploration and settlement by the white man. French missionaries reached the area in the later half of the 17th Century. It wasn't until the early 18001s, however, that significant copper finds were made and reported to the outside W\" s + + + + 4-+ + + + + + + + + + + + dlH\"01 INWHO + + + + 4 + + + + + + 4- + + + + + + + + 4 4 4 r+-@_@4 f A + + + + ++ + + t + + 4 -++ + 4-+ + + + 4-4 + + + 4 + 4 + + + + + + 4 + + + 0 + + + +,o+ 41+ + + 4 +4 + + + dIHSHAOi 4 NONOMM + + + + +0 +4 + + + + + + + + + dl\"SWMCLL WGUM 31W3 3 world. Mining companies located in the east 'began to build towns .near the copper deposits. In the mid-1800's, the lumber industry began to blossom, providing timber products for the construction of mines and villages. Immigrants from Finland, England, Italy, Sweden and other countries came to the region to work for the mining and logging companies. By the turn of the century, however, this prosperous era began to decline. The lumbermen moved on and by World War 1, copper mining was also declining. During the depression, many struggling mines and businesses were forced to close. Agriculture in Keweenaw County was severely restricted due to unsuitable soil conditions and a short growing season. Other minor industrial developments occurred but were hampered by their remote location and long shipping distances to markets and population centers. In 1968, copper mining halted all together when the Calumet-Hecla Company, after determining that the remaining copper reserves were insufficient to meet the costs of operation. Calumet-Hecla sold all of its holdings to Universal Oil Products, a company interested in land investment and development. Today, Universal Oil Products is the largest single landholder in Keweenaw County. Although the lumbering and wood products industries are beginning to reassert themselves in northern Michigan, for Keweenaw County, the greatest potential for economic development is probably in the recreation and tourist industries. With its numerous unpolluted lakes and streams, waterfalls, extensive forests, mountains, abundant fish and wildlife, unique plant and animal species, spectacular scenic views, and its pleasantly cool summers and snowy winters, Keweenaw County offers a rich diversity of natural resources to support a year-round tourist economy. With proper planning and management, such development can take place without degradation to the resources from overuse or abuse. KEWEENAW COUNTY POPULATION According to the Advance Counts for the 1980 Census, Keweenaw County has a population of 1963 (see figure below).

It contains a broad stretch of sand dunes and beach at Great Sand Bay, and numerous rocky bays and islands, including Cat Harbor, Eagle Harbor, Grand Marais Harbor, Silver Island and Agate Harbor. The dominant cover type f ound along the Eagle Harbor Township shoreline is upland conifer forests that change to aspen-white birch forests further inland. In the Village of Eagle Harbor, a lighthouse complex is currently undergoing historic restoration by the County Historical Society. Also in Eagle Harbor is a docking and launching facility operated by the Department of Natural Resources Waterways Division. Grant Township Grant Township has the longest stretch of shoreline in the county at approximately 43.73 miles, excluding Manitou Island. It forms the top of the Keweenaw Peninsula and is the northernmost township in the state. The shoreline is characterized by rocky outcrops and stoney beaches which f orm numerous broad bays (such as Horseshoe, High Rock, Keystone, Big, Fish Cove and Bete Grise) and headland points (such as Keweenaw Point and Keystone Point). Grant Township's northern shore is dominated by upland conifer forest types that change to aspen-white birch forests further inland. Along the township's southern shore, wooded wetlands are the dominant cover type, changing to northern hardwoods as one moves inland. Manitou Island is domianted by upland conifer forests. Several river mouths are found along the township's shoreline, including those for Union Creek, the Montreal River, the Medota Canal, the Little and Big Betsy Rivers, and Winters Creek. Copper Harbor is the largest town in the township and contains a lighthouse museum, Fort Wilkins State Park And a state waterways dock and launching facility. Other significant features found along this stretch of shoreline include: Gull Rock Lighthouse west of Manitou Island; the mountainous area along the north shore of Bete Grise Bay; the superb sandy beach on Bete Grise Bay; the Mendota Canal which allows access to Lake Superior from Lac La Belle where there is a waterways boat dock and launch facility; and the extensive wetiand and lowland areas around Point Isabelle, which may limit development opportunities.

The stamp sands were originally deposited at the Village of Gay, but due to southerly currents along the peninsula, these sands have been carried and deposited along the shore as far south as the county line near Traverse Bay. Several small lakes have now been formed on the surface of the stamp sands. Although the dominant cover type along the original shoreline is northern hardwood f orest, little vegetation is found directly on the stamp sands. Another significant feature along the Sherman Township shoreline is the Tobacco River mouth, which is a popular fishing site during certain times of the year. NOTE: Land Use/Cover Maps The land use/cover maps f ound on these pages were developed through the interpre- tation of color infrared aerial photographs (1978) and placed on a computer mapping system. The code used is the Michigan Land Cover/Use Classification System, a standardized code being used statewide. The smallest land use category that was broken out on these maps was at least 2.5 acres in size. Therefore, the information provided on the maps is not appropriate for site specific decision-making. Because of the possibility of human or mechanical error in the development of these map products, the total accuracy of the information cannot be assued. Full scale (11, = 1 20001) copies of the land use/cover maps are available for viewing at the County Court House.

This uniform code is being used statewide for land use/cover type inventories. URBAN AND BUILT UP LANDS Urban or built up land is comprised of areas of intensive use with much of the land covered by structures. Included in this category are cities, villages, strip develop- ments along highways, transportation, power and communications facilities, and areas such as those occupied by mines and quarries, shopping centers, industrial and commercial complexes, and institutions that may, in some instances, be isolated from urban areas. As development progresses, land having less intensive use may be located in the midst of urban or built-up areas and will generally be included in this category. Agri- cultural land, forest, wetland, or water areas on the fringe of urban or built-up areas will not generally be included. The urban or built-up category takes precedence over others when the criteria for more than one category are met. For example, residential areas that have sufficient tree cover to meet forest land criteria will be placed in a residential category. 113 Single family/duplexes This category includes areas having detached single and two-family stuctures generally containing an average gross density of no more than six dwelling units per acre (15 units per hectare). Lawns, drive ways and associated structures such as garages, tool sheds, garden sheds, etc., should be included in the 113 category. 18 121 Primary/central business district The 121 category should be used to identify the main commercial service center in the community. The uses included in this class are retail estasblishments and the businesses, financial, professional and repair services of the area. The 121 category often contains institutional uses such as governmental offices, churches and schools. These should not be separated out unless they exceed approximately one-third of the area. 126 Institutional Education, government, religious, health, correctional and military facilities are found in this category. All buildings grounds and parking lots that compose the facility are included within the institutional class. Small institutional units in developed areas that do not meet the one to two hectare minimum size standard should be placed within the adjacent categories which are usually residential or commercial. EXTRACTIVE Extractive mineral land encompasses both surface and subsurface mining operations. Surface structure and equipment operations utilizing large power shovels and production trucks, installed primary crushers, concentrating or processing plants, stockpiles, maintenance buildings, waste dumps, tailings basins and parking lots are included. 171 Open pit Extractive activities which are primarily carried out upon the surface of the earth through the creation of a large pit. NONFORESTED LANDS Nonforested land (open land, rangeland) is defined as areas supporting early stages of plant succession consisting of plant communiteis characterized by grasses or shrubs. 19 In cases where there is obvious evidence of seeding, fertilizing or other cultural practices, these areas should be mapped as cropland or permanent pasture. 31 Herbaceous openland Herbaceous openlands (prairies, grassland, rangeland) are dominated by grasses and f orbs. Such areas are of ten subjected to continuous disturbance such as mowing, grazing or burning to maintain the herbaceous character. Typical plant species are quackgrass, Kentucky bluegrass, upland and lowland sedges, reed canary grass and clovers. 32 Shrubland Shrublands are domianted by native shrubs and low woody plants. If left undisturbed such areas are soon dominated by young tree growth. Typical shrub species include blackberry and raspberry briars, dogwood, willow, sumac and tag alder. FOREST LAND Forest lands are lands that are at least ten percent stocked by f orest trees or any size, or formelry having such tree cover, and not currently developed for nonforest use. Forest land can generally be identified rather easily from high altitude imagery. On some lands there may be large areas that have little or no visible forest growth. Lands such as these on which there is forest rotation (involving clear cutting and regeneration) should be classified under the forest land category. Lands that meet the criteria for forest land and also are being used for a higher category should be placed in the higher category (urban and built-up, agricultural or nonforested). 411 Northern hardwood Areas throughout Michigan where the following species predominate or are inter- mixed - sugar and red maple, elm, beech, yellow birch, cherry, basswood and white ash. 20 413 Aspen, white birch and associated species The 413 category should be used to map the trembling aspen, bigtooth aspen, white birch and related species. 414 Lowland hardwoods Ash, elm and sof t maple along with cottonwood, balm-of-Gilead and other lowland hardwoods will be mapped through this category. 421 Pine Those forests where white, red, jack and scotch pine predominates 422 Other upland conifers The 422 category should be used to map white or black spruce, balsam or douglas fir along with areas covered by larch and hemlock. 423 Lowland conifers This lowland species category includes areas of predominantly cedar, tamarack, black and white spruce and balsam fir stands. WATER BODIES 51 Streams and waterways This category includes rivers, strams, creeks, canals, drains, and other linear bodies of water. Intermittent streams which flow in wet seasons but are dry during dry seasons should be classified as streams if they are water covered the majority of the time. Ephemeral streams which carry surface runoff during and immediately after periods of precipitation or snow melt should not be classified as streams. These areas generally have no permanent or well-defined channels but follow slight depressions in the natural contour of the ground surface. Where the water course is interrupted by 21 a control structure which creates an impoundment, the impounded area should be classified as a reservoir. The boundary between streams and lakes, or reservoirs, is the straight line across the mouth of the stream. The St. Mary's, St. Clair and Detroit rivers are classified as Great Lakes connecting waterways. WETLANDS 611 Wooded wetland This class applied to wetlands dominated by trees more than 20 feet tall. The soil surface is seasonally flooded with up to 12 inches of water. Several levels of vegetation are usually present, including trees, shrubs and herbaceous plants. Some of the predominate tree species include: ash, elm, red maple, cedar, black spruce, tamarack and balsam fir. 612 Shrub/scrub wetland This class applies to wetlands domianted by woody vegetation less than six meters tall. Vegetation includes shrub and small or stunted trees. This class includes both stable shrub wetlands and areas in a successional stage leading to wooded wetlands. Some of the predominate species include: alder, dogwood, sweetgale, leatherleaf, willow-buttonbush associations and water willow. Any standing dead trees, shrubs and stumps should be placed in the 612 category. BARREN LAND Barren land is land of limited ability to support life and little or no vegetation. Land temporarily barren owing to man's activities and where it may be reasonably inferred that the land will be returned to its former use, it is included in one of the other categories. 72 Beaches and riverbanks The 72 category should be used to map sloping accumulations of exposed sand and gravel along shorelines. 22 73 Sand dunes The 73 category should be placed on the delineations of hills, mounds or ridges of wind blown sand in a primarily unvegetated condition. 23 SPECIAL NATURAL FEATURES OF KEWEENAW COUNTY Keweenaw County has a wealth of natural diversity--perhaps as much as any other county in Michigan. Among its outstanding natural features are dramatic geological formations, virgin forests, and rare plant and animal species. The Michigan Natural Features Inventory maintains records on five major types of natural features which are of special conservation interest in the state; they are special plants, special animals, outstanding plant communities, unusual geological features, and miscel- laneous special features such as champion trees and great blue heron rookeries. Keweenaw County's special features are described below according to these categories. Special Plants Within Keweenaw County grow more plant species of special concern, threatened and endangered status than in any other Michigan county. These rarities fall into two major groups. One group consists of plants which normally grow in Arctic regions, f ar to the north of Michigan; however, because of the cool, moist ef f ect of Lake Superior, these plants are able to survive in the Keweenaw, far south of their ordinary ranges. Some occur only on Isle Royale, but many also grow on the Keweenaw Peninsula, especially along the rocky Lake Superior shore. The second category of rare and unusual plants in the Keweenaw includes the \"western disjuncts\"- -plants which grow primarily in the Rocky Mountains of the Pacific Northwest, but for some yet unknown reason are surprisingly \"disjunct\" (growing far away from their normal ranges) in the Lake Superior region. Keweenaw County's only endangered plant- -Chamaerhodos nuttallii, a plant hardly bigger than its name--is one of these \"western disjuncts\", as are several other plants of the rocks shorelines, treeless ridgetops and rich forests. Special Animals Most of Keweenaw County's special animal species are confined to Isle Royale National park. On the peninsula itself, there are four historic eagle nests, though none have been active in the last two years. However, bald eagles-and possibly ospreys-should return to the Keweenaw as their numbers increase throughout the state thanks to successful conservation efforts. 24 Plant Communities Despite great changes in the natural vegetation of the Keweenaw following settle- ment, the best examples of certain natural communities are found here. It is assumed that the forests of much of the Upper Peninsula were cut and burned--more than once in some areas-and Keweenaw County suffered the same. Still, there exist a few tracts of uncut or at least mature timber, the most significant and famous of which is the Estivant Pines, a virgin forest of the dry-mesic northern type, about 40 percent of which is protected. The same coastal factors responsible for rare arctic plants foster a type of forest similar to that found in the boreal (northern) region of Canada, which enters the United States only in Michigan, northern Minnesota, and New England. Because it is surrounded by Lake Superior, the Keweenaw once had extensive boreal forests, mostly growing in a half-mile wide strip along the coast. Though most have been cut and burned, some stands are in an original, near-original, or recovered condition, and are thus exemplary in the state. Some aquatic habitats in the Keweenaw are in more pristine condition than elsewhere in the state because of their remoteness. Especially noteworthy are the several large exemplary oligotrophic (low. nutrient) lakes in the eastern portion of the peninsula which have scarcely a cottage on them. The most outstanding plant communities in the Keweenaw occur on exposed bedrock, which has been protected from or tolerant of fire. The state's largest and -most diverse examples of bedrock beach are found in the Keweenaw, especially around Horseshoe Harbor and from Agate Harbor to Copper Harbor. Northern balds-- treeless ridgetop communities created by high winds and other unusual environmental factors--have their best representive in Mount Lookout. Only seven other state locations exist for this rare natural community; both Brockway Mountain and those in the Porcupine Mountains have been greatly altered, and two others in the Keweenaw are very small. A third bedrock community type-bedrock glade-resembles the northern bald, but supports more trees and is caused by heat and drought. There are a number of good examples of bedrock glade in the northwestern Upper Peninsula, with Mount Houghton, Bear Bluff, Mount Bohemia and Fish Cove Knob among the best. Last of the Keweenaw's bedrock communities are the cliffs, occurring in various settings throughout the peninsula, the most spectacular of which form the escarpments along the \"spine\" of the peninsula. 25 Geologic Features The Keweenaw's geologic diversity is one of its most outstanding scenic attractions. From the great ridges of ancient Precambrian rock, one can obtain magnificent views of the peninsula. Other, less dramatic features are no less unique and interesting in geological terms, however. Along the rocky shore are excellent examples of sea stacks and other unusual erosion features, ripple marks representing pre-historic lakebeds, tilted bedrock of the great Lake Superior Syncline which forms both the peninsula and Isle Royle, fossils of the earliest living plants, the remnants of ancient lava flows, and some of the oldest rocks in North America. Inland is found a famous esker-glacial riverbed turned rocky ridge--which winds past Delaware. Miscellaneous Special Features One of the most renowned of Keweenaw County's special features is the state champion and near-national champion white pine--the \"Leaning Giant\"--at the Estivant Pines Nature Sanctuary. The county also has the recognized state champion specimens of the roundleaf shadbush and the fleshy haw. The county's only known blue heron rookery is in Isle Royale National Park. Conservation of these special natural features for future generations can take many forms, from a strategy of avoiding human disturbance, to active management which might include mowing, burning or selective cutting. Fragile features maintained by natural environmental conditions-e.g., ridgetop balds or aquatic habitats--would benefit most f rorn the \"hands-of f 11 strategy. Active management can be benef icial to species and communities which thrive at certain stage in ecological succession. For instance, the threatened plants wild-lilac and heart-leaved arnica have benefitted from mechanical clearing of roadsides and powerline rights-of-way, which reduces competition from other species. Several nature preserves have been established in Keweenaw County to help protect some of its special natural fatures. The IMichigan Nature Association currently owns nine preserves, the Nature Conservancy has one, and the U.S. government holds the largest--Isle Royale National Park, most of which is designated federal wilderness. Nonetheless, these preserves in themselves do not ensure the conservation of the county's rich natural diversity. 26 Of the special features inventoried by the Michigan Natural Features Inventory, only endangered and threatened species are protected by law. Permits may be obtained for actions affecting threatened species; although permits are normally not issued for endangered species, only one such species--Chamaerhodos nuttallii- -occurs; in the county. The legal protection afforded endangered and threatened plants via the Endangered Species Act of 1974 is not to be confused with Michigan's wildflower protection law (the Christmas Greens Act of 1962) which forbids the removal of some attractive-though mostly common--plants (e.g., orchids, gentians, clubmosses) from state land and from private land without permission of the landowner. Wildflowers protected by the latter law are not represented by Natural Features Inventory records.

Confusion results from the legal terminology embodied in Michigan's two major laws concerning wild plants: The Michigan Christmas Greens Act and Wildflower Protection Law (1943, 1962) and the Endangered Species Act (1974). Each offers a differing degree of concern for two separate, but sometimes overlapping, groups of plants. As George Thomas, of the Southeastern Chapter of the Michigan Botanical Club, aptly put it: 'IPA 182 (1962), the Christmas Greens and Wildflower Protection Act, declares that it is public policy to protect attractive plants from overzealous collectors and commercial exploi- tation ... and to prevent their becoming rare. This purpose should be distinguished from that of the Endangered Species Act ... which protects plants which have already reached rarity status and require special recovery programs.\" The former act covers \"Christmas trees, evergreen boughs, other trees, shrubs and vines, and 'certain native plants.\"' Many of these \"certain native plants\" are also covered by the latter act; but some, in no way endangered or threatened in the state, are legally protected because their attractiveness has been construed as inviting exploitation. And this must indeed have been the case as early as 1933, when Christmas trees, bittersweet, native holly, etc. were being ripped off public and private lands for decorative purposes. Times have changed; exploitation is now more subtle and sophisticated. Only last year several plants of the precariously rare prairie white fringed orched (Habenaria leucophaea) were \"lifted\", obviously not for Christmas decoration. 30 Approximately 340 native Michigan plant species are now listed as either endangered, threatened or of special concern. Only plants in the first two categories are protected by the Michigan Endangered Species Act. \"Endangered\" status confers the greatest protection to a plant in that a permit must be obtained each time a plant or colony of plants is taken. Only 13 species which are regionally rare and near extinction in Michigan have been assigned this status. The 223 \"threatened'\" plants are also protected through a permitting program, though annually renewable permits are available for taking these species. Plants which are not \"endangered\" or \"threatened\" in Michigan but are extremely uncommon and deserve further study and monitoring are assigned \"special concern\" status (Wagner et al., 1977; Mich. Bot. 16:100). This last category was formerly called \"rare\". But as that term applies in effect to the whole bunch, it was decided by the Technical Advisory. Committee to introduce the term \"special concern\". So when the exclamation is sounded, \"look at those white trilliums ... they're very rare, you know\", calmly explain that plants can be protected without necessarily being rare. Waterfalls Keweenaw County, due to its steeply sloping topography and numerous bedrock outcrops, has a number of scenic waterfalls. It may be important to know the locations of these waterfalls because of their unique beauty and attractiveness to visitors and residents alike, as well as to protect them from degradation. Several waterfalls are noted on the special natural features map. NOTE: Full scale maps are available for viewing at the County Court House.

Brokaw, conducted an attitude survey of registered voters in Keweenaw County to develop information that would be useful to local elected officials. The three part survey asked voters how they felt on a variety of local issues, on how local government funds should be spent, and on general demographic questions. Although the response rate was only 53 percent, the sample appears to be generally representative of the county population. Several findings of the attitude survey relate directly to this shoreland management planning effort. The overriding conclusion of the survey is that the residents of Keweenaw County favor new development that creates jobs while preserving the natural beauty of the county. Also, many specific questions related in some way to the county's Lake Superior shoreline evoked strong responses. 1) \"Public Access to Lake Superior Beaches Should be Preserved.\" 89.9 percent of the respondents either agreed or strongly agreed with this statement. 2) \"The County Should Try to Get More Government Grants.\" 69.2 percent of the respondents either agreed or strongly agreed with this statement. 3) \"The County Needs More Jobs Based on Wood and Forest Products.\" 78.9 percent of the respondents either agreed or strongly agreed with this statement. 4) \"The County Needs to Promote More Winter Tourism in the County-\" 71.9 percent of the respondents either agreed or strongly agreed with this statement. 5) \"The County Needs to Promote More Summer Tourism in the County.\" 73.7 percent of the respondents either agreed or strongly agreed with this statement. 6) \"The County Should Encourage the Building of a Downhill Ski Resort in the County \" 57.5 percent of the respondents either agreed or strongly agreed with this statement. 33 7) \"Extended Winter Navigation of Lake Superior Should be Encouraged.\" 53.5 percent of the respondents either disagreed or strongly disagreed with this statement. 8) \"The County Should Develop a Formal Long-Range Development Plan.\" 61 percent of the respondents either agreed or strongly agreed with this statement. 9) \"The County Should Develop a Zoning Ordinance to Control Land Use.\" 48.3 percent of the respondents either agreed or strongly agreed with this state- ment, while 25.8 percent remain neutral. 10) \"The Environmental Beauty of Keweenaw County Must be Preserved.\" 84.9 percent of the respondents either agreed or strongly agreed with this statement. 11) \"1 Live in Keweenaw County Because of its Beauty and Purity.\" 76.5 percent of the respondents either agreed or strongly agreed with this statement. 12) \"Shoreline Erosion is a Serious Problem in the County.\" 49.4 percent of the respondents either agreed or strongly agreed with this statement, while 31.8 were neutral. 13) \"A County Wide Land Use Plan Should be Developed.\" 46.5 percent of the respndents either agreed or strongly agreed with this statement, while 31.2 percent remained neutral and only 17.1 percent disagreed. 14) \"Development Should not be Allowed in Some Parts of the County.\" 45.1 percent of the respondents either agreed or strongly agreed with this state- ment, while 31.5 percent remained neutral and only 16.6 percent were negative. Along with this last statement, the respondents were asked to list areas in the county where development should not be allowed. The areas mentioned most frequently are listed below: 34 1) Bete Gris 2) Lake Shore Property 3) Keweenaw Point 4) Five Mile Point 5) Seven Mile Point 6) Mt. Bohemia 7) Mouth of the Tobacco River 8) Mouth of the Montreal River 9) Brockway Drive Some respondents generally thought that the entire county should not be developed, while some others felt that development should not be banned anywhere in the County. One other question on the survey that relates to shoreland planning is one that asked if either more or less local money should be spent on buying shoreland to ensure public access. Out of 30 items that respondents had a chance to react to, buying shoreland was the seventh most popular answer for spending local government funds. In conclusion, the survey results tend to support many points: that public access to Lake Superior should be maintained and expanded; that more should be done to promote tourism; that planning and zoning are desirable; and that the environment of the county should be preserved. Although this voter survey should not be the sole source of information upon which to base local public policy, the information does give some general indications on how county residents feel about certain issues. In regards to the Shoreland Management Plan, the responses to shoreland, recreation and land use issues should be taken into consideration by the Planning Commission when developing planning goals and objectives. 35 SHORELAND DEVELOPMENT LIMITATIONS AND OPPORTUNITIES Today, the scenic beauty of the Lake Superior shoreline is probably Keweenaw County's greatest asset in terms of economic development. However, that has not always been true. In the past, the county's economy depended on the copper mining industry and later the lumbering industry. However, today, very little, if any, copper mining is currently being done in the county and a future resurgence in the near future seems unlikely. Timber-related industries appear to be working only on a small scale compared to the lumbering booms of the late 1800s. Currently, the wood products industry has shown some signs of new life, and the industry may become a major employer in the county in the future. Forestry Potential In the late 1970s, the Prime Forestlands Identification Project was organized to promote the continuing use of the Upper Peninsula forest resource by identifying and mapping the areas of greatest potential for forest production. Prime forestlands are those that, because of favorable soil characteristics and other factors, are capable of producing sustained yields of wood products. Keweenaw County was determined to have approximately 128,632 acres of prime forestland, concentrated primarily in the central inland portion of the county. Of the roughly 100 miles of county shoreline, less than eight scattered miles have been identified as prime forestland. This finding is perhaps fortunate because commercial forestry operations could potentially degrade the scenic attributes of the Lake Superior shoreline and advesely impact tourism. Therefore, efforts to improve the local economy through expanding timber related industries, should be focused on the central inland portions of the county where the most productive lands are located. In the same view, the county may want to consider prohibiting visually degrading forest practices, such as clear-cut harvesting, within any shoreline area or within sight distance of any major state or county highway right-of -way which runs along the shoreline. Environmental Considerations In 1973, the Western Upper Peninsula Regional Planning and Development Commission completed the Environmental Land Use Plan for their six-county region. Included in the plan were a number of resource suitability maps which indicated the development potential of various areas based on environmental and natural resource 36 characteristics. These maps indicate that the entire Keweenaw County shoreline, due to bedrock, soil types, slopes, drainage, high water tables and other factors, pose severe limitations for intensive urban development (with or without sewer), as well as for cropland, pasture and commercial forest. Finally, certain areas of the shoreline are subject to erosion by Lake Superior wave action. This situation can present a significant hazard to any type of shoreline development. This issue will be addressed in more detail in a later chapter. These inherent environmental limitations to urban development should serve to assure residents and visitors that the scenic and unique natural resources of the county will not be endangered by encroaching urban development. This means that the area will remain very attractive to tourists for the foreseeable future, opening up vast opportunities for additional recreation and related tourism development. Recreation Potential The 1972 Open Space and Recreation Inventor y-Interi m Plan of the Western Upper Peninsula Planning and Development Commission indicates that several types of recreational activities could be expanded for the region including fishing, boating, canoeing, hiking, camping, visiting historic sites, ice fishing, downhill skiing and others. As an indication of tourism levels in the county, during the past five years at Fort Wilkins State Park, attendance has averaged over 200,000 people per year. (Also note these years have included some very difficult economic times for many people.) With Keweenaw County's unique and beautiful shoreline to attract tourists and visitors, the county should be able to successfully capture its share of the expending vacation industry in the western Upper Peninsula. Accompanying the development of facilities for these recreational activities would be the need for additional stores, restaurants and motels.

To provide adequate public access, and to encourage wise use and development of the county's water resources. 3. To develop and improve recreational facilities to encourage year-around use, and a stable economic return. 4. To develop, protect and make available for public use the historic, scenic and natural areas of the county. 5. To improve wildlife and fish habitat to insure maintenance of species and the development of recreational and economic potential. 6. To guide new development into appropriate areas and avoid development in environmentally sensitive or hazardous areas. In order to pursue these general shoreland management goals, a more specific set of objectives is needed to define the actions necessary to achieve them. The following objectives present specific categories of actions that will guide decision-making to better manage the county's Lake Superior shoreline: a) Pursue state, federal and private grants to purchase additional shoreline public access sites and parks, and to develop and improve such sites for public use. b) Consider other land acquisition techniques that don't involve the purchasing of property, such as easements, leaseholds and dedications, to create additional public access and park sites. 38 c) Provide more opportunities for camping on county-owned lands. d) Encourage additional tourism development (motels, restaurants, private recre- ation facilities, etc.) in appropriate areas by use of promotional brochures, adjustments in zoning districts, tax incentives and other technqiues. e) Adopt zoning provisions to protect property in designated 'high risk erosion areas' (under the Shorelands Protection and Management Act) and to administer the setback requirements at the county, rather than the state, level (see section on shoreland erosion). f) Develop and adopt improved zoning standards and procedures to protect environmentally sensitive areas and to guide new development into more appropriate areas. The above stated goals and objectives constitute the policy of the Keweenaw County Planning Commission with regards to shoreland management and provides basis for more site specific development and management recommendations. 39 SHORELAND DEVELOPMENT RECOMMENDATIONS Over the course of several meetings and workshops, the Keweenaw County Planning Commission with citizen input has prepared public project development recommend- ations for specific sites along the Lake Superior shoreline.

Provide playground equipment for certain parks where it is needed. 45 SHORELAND EROSION Shoreline erosion is the process of wearing away of a beach or bluff due to wave action. Great Lakes shoreland erosion is a natural geologic process which continually shapes Michigan's coast. In the past, the failure to recognize the natural hazards and dangers of shoreland erosion has proven to be very costly. In the early 1950's approximately 20 million dollars in property damage was caused by shoreland erosion just in Michigan. In the late 1960's and into the first half of the 1970's high lake levels and storms again caused millions of dollars worth of damage. In studies conducted by the U.S. Corps of Engineers for the period of 1972 through 1976, 85.7 million dollars (at 1973 price levels) of property damage in Michigan was attributed to Great Lakes flooding and erosion, of this total in excess of 46 million was attributed to erosion damage alone. Since 1969, over 80 residences have been destroyed and another 800 are in immediate danger of destruction or severe damage. The Shorelands Protection and Management Act, P.A. 245 of 1970, as amended In recognition of the powerful and continual process of shoreland erosion, and in light of high costs and difficulty of controlling this natural process, the Michigan Legislature in 1970 passed the Shorelands Protection and Management Act. The act takes a \"nonstructural approach\" to minimizing property loss, that is, instead of requiring that costly and ineffective erosion control structures be constructed, the act authorizes local management or state permit activities to prevent future construction in areas subject to \"high risk\" erosion. The Shorelands Protection and Management Act directs the Department of Natural Resources to study Michigan's Great Lakes shoreline in order to identify areas of \"high risk\" due to shoreland erosion and flooding. Areas where the bluff is rapidly eroding are to be identified and the use of these areas managed to prevent property damage which can result if structures are placed in high risk erosion areas of the Great Lakes shorelands. Identification of High Risk Erosion Areas Identification fo areas of high risk erosion and the calculation of bluffline recession rates involves the analysis of low attitude aerial photographs. The rates of bluffline 46 recession are determined by comparing aerial photographs of the shore at two different time periods and noting the changes in the position of the bluffline. Comparisons have been made of aerial phtographs taken in the 1930's or the 1950's with those taken in the 19701s. The mechanical means of comparison actually allows later photographs to be superimposed over earlier aerial photos. From the overall change in the position of the bluffline, an average annual rate of bluf f line recession can be calculated. Generally, the rate of shoreland erosion is determined by fluctuations in lake levels, wave action, the physical character of the shoreland, and other natural factors. The combination of high lake levels and storm activity can produce an accelerated rate of erosion where the bluff recedes (moves landward) several feet in one day. Because the aerial photographs of the shoreline cover long periods of time including years of high and low lake levels, the average annual erosion rate is felt to be a good indicator of future erosion rates. Storm activity and lake levels cannot be accurately predicted over long periods of time so that the best indicator of what can be expected in the f uture is the experience of the past. Local Zoning as an Op-tion to Manage High Risk Erosion Areas Basically, there are two types of solutions to the problems of construction in areas of high risk due to erosion--\"structural\" and \"nonstructural\". The structural solution to erosion includes the construction of groins, seawalls, revetments, beach walls and other erosion control structures. Such structural solutions to shoreland erosion problems are fraught with problems. The designing, engineering and construction of these structures must incorporate a multitude of considerations, including the effect of the device on adjacent property owners, the environment, and the public's right to the use of the Great Lakes. Too often, expensive erosion control devices are built, only later proving to be inadequate and ineffective in providing anything but short- term control of shoreland erosion. The alternative--the nonstructural solution-relies on the management of the use of land to prevent shoreland erosion damage. This approach is termed \"nonstructuraill because instead of providing any physical control of erosion processes it provides for guiding development in a manner sensitive to physical hazards and limitations in the landscape. For shoreland erosion areas, the nonstructural approach simply requires the establishment of a setback from an eroding bluff. By establishing this minimum 47 setback f or structures in high risk erosion areas, a local unit of government has an effective and efficient means to prevent property losses without large public or private expenditures. The Shorelands Protection and Management Act incorporates the nonstructural approach by requiring a state permit or local zoning permit (when the local zoning for high risk erosion areas has been approved). This approach is designed to insure that new structures are setback from an eroding bluff a distance which will minimize future property loss and damage for a period of at least 30 years. The adoption of local zoning not only is an effective means of preventing property damage due to erosion damage, but is also consistent with Michigan's tradition of local land resource management. Historically, Michigan cities, villages, townships and counties have had the responsibility and authority to establish local planning and land resource management programs. The adoption of local land use plans and a zoning ordinance allows a community to take an important step to guiding its own pattern of growth and development. A community that adopts local zoning for high risk erosion areas has the opportunity to integrate these regulations into a larger plan and management program to help insure appropriate future development. High Risk Erosion Overlay Zone The utilization of the overlay zone technique allows a local community to amend its existing zoning ordinance by adding special land development requirements which apply within the zone. In an area where an overlay zone is established, the land must be used under the conditions and requirements of the overlay zone as well as the underlying zoning district. Some of the most common uses for overlay zones relate to special environmental features such as flood plains and wetlands or may apply for special purposes such as preserving historic structures or establishing additional height restrictions in areas adjacent to airport landing strips. Overlay zones are described in the zoning text, mapped and adopted by the local legislative body in the same manner as other supplements or amendments to the zoning ordinance. Below is an illustration of an overlay zone. This illustration includes the terms used and shows the area affected by the high risk erosion zoning in a manner consistent with the sample zoning language. 48 Overlay Zone GREAT LAKE SHORELJNE M ff u. iine Setback Line.

The use of the overlay zone is particularly well suited to establishing setback requirements in high risk erosion areas. By using the overlay zone technique, the desired land use pattern established in the existing zoning ordinance is not disturbed. The community's zone classification, maximum densities, height, bulk and other requirements remain unchanged. The overlay zone establishes a new setback requirement that is designed to protect structures from shoreline erosion related damage. HIGH RISK EROSION AREAS IN KEWEENAW COUNTY Shoreline erosion does not appear to be a critical problem in Keweenaw County due to stable bedrock formations and protected waters. Of the over 100 miles of county shoreline along Lake Superior, less than five miles has been designated as 'high risk erosion'. However, this does not mean that other shoreline areas are not eroding, only that they are not eroding at over a foot per year over a 30 year period, or that they do not fall under the jurisdiction of the Shorelands Act (such as the Gay area 49 stamp sands which local residents report are rapidly eroding). The few high risk erosion areas that have been designated under the act are located in Allouez, Houghton, Eagle Harbor and 'Grant townships (see maps). For Keweenaw County to obtain the authority to administer the setback requirements for designated high risk erosion areas under the act, a zoning amendment similar to the following would need to be adopted by the county and approved by the Department of Natural Resources: 50 PROPOSED AMENDMENT SECTION 16 - HIGH RISK EROSION OVERLAY ZONE 1. PURPOSE The purpose of this overlay zone is to prevent t'he placement of structures in areas of high risk erosion consistent with the Shorelands Protection and Management Act, P.A. 245 of 1970, as amended. It is f urther.,nore, the purpose of this zone to: 1.1 Establish a minimum setback line for principal structures from an eroding bluff which based on the erosion studies prepared by the Department of Natural Resources pursuant to the Shorelands Protection and Management Act, P.A. 245 of 1970, as amended, will provide a minimum of 30 years protection from shoreland erosion. 1.2 Minimize the economic hardships which individuals and Keweenaw County may face in the case of unanticipated property loss due to severe erosion. The standards and requirements contained in this Article, and on the zoning map, are intended to further the purposes of the Shorelands Protection and Management Act, P.A. 245 of 1970, as amended. 2. AREA AFFECTED The boundaries of those stretches of shoreland affected by the high risk erosion overlay zone shall be consistent with the affected properties described in Section 2.01 of this ordinance. This area is shown on the official Keweenaw County zoning map which is part of this ordinance. A copy of the zoning map and text shall be filed in the office of the county clerk. This area extends landward from the ordinary high water mark to the minimum setback line for principal structures. For the purpose of the high risk erosion overlay zone, the minimum setback requirement shall be measured landward from the bluffline and shall be construed as running parallel to the bluffline. In the event the bluffline recedes (rnoves landward), the setback line of the high risk erosion area shall also be construed as to have moved landward a distance equal to the bluffline recession. 51 2.1 BOUNDARIES OF HIGH RISK EROSION AREAS The end points of the high risk erosion areas provided below coincide with des- criptions provided in the shoreland erosion studies of the Department of Natural Resources, and are as follows: 2'.2 ALLOUEZ TOWNSHIP HIGH RISK EROSION AREA A - The northeastern end of Area A in Section 26, T58N, R32W, ties 1,075 feet northeast of the intersection of the Section 26-27 line, T58N, R32W, and the shoreline.

ACCESSORY STRUCTURES Accessory structures which can be easily and economically removed prior to erosion damage are exempted from the setback requirements for principal structures of the high risk erosion overlay zone, except that no accessory structures which are permanent in either construction or location may be placed in the high risk erosion overlay zone. To the fullest extent practical, permitted accessory structures which are placed in high risk erosion areas shall be removed prior to erosion damage. 5. SPECIAL EXCEPTIONS FOR SUBSTANDARD LOTS (this section is optional) 5.1 A special exception may be granted to install a moveable structure on a substandard lot if all of the following provisions are complied with: (a) If a sanitary sewer is not used, the septic system, tile field, or other waste handling facility shall be located on the landward side of the moveable structure. (b) The moveable structure shall be located as far landward of the bluffline as local zoning restrictions allow. (c) The moveable structure shall be designed and constructed in accordance with proper engineering standards and building moving restrictions applicable to the subject area. Review and approval of the design shall be incorporated into the Department permit process. All construction materials, including foundations, shall be removed or disposed of as part of the moving operation. Access to and from the structure shall be of sufficient width and acceptable grade to allow for moving of the structure. 5.2 If a substandard lot does not have access to and from the structure site of sufficient width and acceptable grade to allow for a moveable structure, a special exception may be granted to utilize an erosion control device in place of a portion of the rninimum setback requirement. The special exception shall be granted only if all of the following provisions are complied with: 64 (a) If a sanitary sewer is not used, the septic system, tile field, or other waste handling facility shall be located on the landward side of the permanent structure. (b) The permanent structure shall be located as far landward of the bluffline as local zoning restrictions allow. (c) The erosion control device shall be designed to meet or exceed proper engineering standards for the Great Lakes, and a professional engineer shall certify that the device has been designed and will be constructed in accordance with these standards. Also, two other minor additions would need to be made to make the high risk erosion area overlay zone amendment eligible for approval under the Shorelands Protection and Management Act. In Section 14.2, four additional defintions are needed: 1) BLUFFLINE - the line which is the edge or crest of the elevated segment of the shoreline above the beach which normally has a precipitous front inclining steeply on the lakeward side. Where there is no precipitous front indicating the bluffline, the line of perennial vegetation may be considered the bluff line. 2) HIGH RISK EROSION AREA - an area designated as a high risk erosion area due to shoreland erosion by the Department of Natural Resources pursuant to the Shorelands Protection and Management Act, Public Act 245 of .1970, as amended. 3) MOVEABLE STRUCTURE - means a structure which the Keweenaw County Building Inspector has determined to be moveable. Such a determination shall be based on a review of the design and size of the structure, a review of the capability of the proposed structure to withstand normal moving stresses and a site review to determine whether the structure will be accessible to moving equipment. 4) ORDINARY HIGH WATER MARK - means the line between upland and bottomland which persists through successive changes in water levels below 65 which the presence and action of the'water is so common or recurrent that the character of the land is marked distinctly from the upland and is apparent in the soil itself, the configuration of the surface of the soil and the vegetation. Consistent with the Great Lakes Submerged Lands Act, P.A. 247 of 1955, as amended, the ordinary high water mark shall be deemed to be the following elevation above sea level, International Great Lakes Datum of 1955 for Lake Superior is 601.5 feet. In Section 11.2(6), a statement requiring notice to the Department of Natural Resources when a variance request is made in a designated high risk erosion area needs to be added. If, or when, all of the above provisions, along with the appropriate maps, are adopted as an amendment to the Keweenaw County Zoning Ordinance, the entire ordinance should be submitted to the Department of Commerce and the Department of Natural Resources for f ormal approval. When these approvals are received, Keweenaw County will then have the authority to administer the setback requirements for designated high risk erosion areas pursuant to the Shorelands Act. 66 IMPLEMENTATION'TECHNIQUES County governments in Michigan have at their disposal a variety of means to implement plans which involve the acquisition, development or management or- land. Land Acquisition Acquiring lands for public use can be accomplished by either of two different methods. The first is \"fee simple\" acquisition which refers to outright ownership of a piece of property obtained by purchase or by donation. The other is \"less than fee simple\" acquisition which involves a public right to use property that is still in private ownership, that is obtained by purchase or donation. Fee simple land acquisition for public access sites and parks can be done with local funds only, state or federal grant funds, or the most practical way of combining local and state or federal funds. Two programs at the state level which can assist in public land acquisitions by local government are the \"Michigan Land Trust Fund\" and the \"Land and Water Conservation Fund\". The Michigan Land Trust Fund operates with funds derived from royalties paid to the state for oil and gas development on state land. A complete description of the program is included in the appendix. To obtain funding assistance from the Land and Water Conservation Fund Program, a local recreation plan is required before a community is eligible to receive funds. The required elements of such a local recreation plan is included in the appendix, along with a contact person. Both of these programs are administered by the Michigan Department of Natural Resources. Fee simple 'land acquisition can also be accomplished by requesting donations of critical properties to the county for protection and management. Private landowners may be willing to donate land because they want to see it protected or because of the tax advantages that are available. A cheaper way to obtain public rights to use land is through \"less than fee simple\" techniques such as easements or leaseholds. These techniques usually involve negotiation between the local government and the private landowner to work out an 67 easement or leasehold agreement. Usually some type of fee is paid to the private landowner for the right of the public to use the property, although sorne private landowners may be willing to grant an easement to the county without requiring any payments. By using these methods, the county can open up new areas for public use without having to expend large sums of money for the outright purchase of land. More information on less than fee simple acquisition technqiues can be found in the appendix. Land Development The development of land according to this plan includes both public and private endeavors. Examples of public developments would focus chiefly on recreation, such as parks, boat launching ramps, trails and other facilities. Private developments would include motels, restaurants, private recreation businesses, stores, gas stations, etc. For public recreational projects, the Land and Water Conservation Fund Program mentioned earlier may be able to assist in funding once a local recreation plan is developed. Also, the Michigan Department of Commerce has several programs related to community development assistance. For further information contact: Bill Lontz Community Economic Development Division Michigan Department of Commerce Box 30225 Lansing, Michigan 48909 517/373-0347 For local recreational projects which involve boat ramps or harbors, contact: Walter Poyet Waterways Division Michigan Department of Natural Resources Box 30028 Lansing, Michigan 48909 517/322-1311 To adequately organize and carry out these community development projects, the county should prepare a \"capital improvements program\" for the entire county which places priorities on each proposed project and schedules them over a one to three 68 year period. Also, for each project, proposed funding sources should be identified. The Board of Commissioners should then use this document to guide their decision- making on funding public projects. For private development projects, the Michigan Department of Commerce has several programs to assist communities in providing incentives to business and industry. Information can be obtained on tax abatement techniques, tax increment financial, public-private ventures and small business assistance. For more infor- mation, contact: David Turner Community Economic Development Division Michigan Department of Commerce Box 30225 Lansing, Michigan 48909 517/373-0637 Land Management The county's most direct authority to manage land comes from the County Rural Zoning Enabling Act (Public Act 183 of 1943, as amended), and is manifested in the current county zoning ordinance. With the completion of this Shoreland Management Plan, the Planning Commission should now scrutinize the zoning ordinance to make sure that it is consistent with the goals, objectives and recommendations of the plan. Professional planning assistance should be enlisted as part of this effort. The following items should be carefully reviewed: 1. Check the boundaries of the zoning districts with the land use/cover maps for each township. Do they make sense? 2. The specific provisions for each zoning district should be reviewed. Are they adequate? Should other types of zoning standards be considered, such as: setbacks from public highways; vegetative buffers in scenic areas; protection of unique geological features (i.e. cliffs, waterfalls, rocky islands) or special or endangered plant species; and prohibiting certain uses in critical areas (such as junk yards along Brockway Mountain Drive)? 69 3. The procedures in the zoning ordinance *should be reviewed for their adequacy. Is the administration of the ordinance going smoothly? Should new procedures be considered for certain critical areas, such as site plan review or planned unit development provisions? In regards to the high risk erosion areas designated under the Shorelands Protection and Management Act, if the county adopts the language in the shoreland erosion section of this plan, the ordinance must be sent to the Michigan Department of Commerce and the Michigan Department of Natural Resources for final approval. With such approvals, the county would be responsible for administering the setback rquirements to protect property in the high risk erosion areas. It should also be noted that under the Great Lakes Submerged Lands Act (Public Act 247 of 1955), any modification of the Lake Superior shoreline, whether for dredge/fill activity or constructing a seawall, a permit from the Michigan Department of Natural Resources is required. County zoning officials should make sure that developers have obtained, or will obtain, the state permit prior to issuing a zoning or building permit. 70 1 I I I I APPENDIX A I NOTES ON LESS THAN FEE SIMPLE I LAND ACQUISITION TECHNIQUES I I I I I I I I I I I I 71 Overview of Less-Than-Fee Techniques Techngiue Characteristics Easement * Limited right or set of rights over land owned by somebody else. * Usually \"runs with the land\" by being written into the deed of title and is, therefore, binding on succeeding property owners. * Can serve a variety of purposes including the protection of scenic views and natural features, the provision of public access, and the control of development. Leasehold * Agreement whereby the landowner (lessor) grants an in- terested party (lessee) the right to use the land in a specified manner for a specified time. * Rights and responsibilities of the lessor and lessee are carefully spelled out as in a contractual agreement. * Interest rights revert back to the lessor after the lease expires. License * Arrangement whereby an individual or organization is granted permission to use the land in a specified manner. * Use rights granted are revocable. Purchase Sellback/ * Means by which land is initially acquired through fee simple Leaseback and is then resold/leased after restrictions have been attached to the deed. * Selling or leasing price of the restricted property is deter- mined by the existing market demand. * Future property owners are bound by the deed restrictions. Dedication, Gift, * Arrangement whereby landowner agrees to relinquish less- Trust than-fee or fee interests to the property to another indivi- dual or administrative organization. * Most often invovles indirect forms of compensation such as tax advantages rather than direct cash payments. Compensible * Involves the placement of controls on development similar Regulation to zoning. * No payment is made for the restrictions until the property is sold. * Compensation reflects the market demand which is oper- ating at the time of sale and represents the difference between the sale price and the earlier assessed value.

Covenant * Binding written agreements made between two or more landowners. 72 * Permits landowners to make agreements without directly involving governmental agencies or nonprofit organizations. * Most commonly used to restrict land use to low density residential and agricultural uses. Suggested Area Selection Process Criteria for Less-Than-Fee Acquisition PROPERTY CHARACTERISTICS 1. The property is under one of a limited number of ownerships. This will make the negotiating process easier from the standpoint of the number of partici- pants and the variations in the terms and conditions for agreement. 2. Multiple use of the property is possible. Mineral lands provide an example of this since they can often be used for public access purposes while being held for future development. Public and private shoreline institutional uses might also be utilized for multiple purposes including public access and passive recreation. 3. The property would complement an existing public area owned in fee simple. Buffers to existing public areas (e.g., parks) as well as connecting links between public areas provide examples of this. GENERAL MANAGEMENT OBJECTIVES I. Future development can be guided and made more effective through: (a) \"buying time\" to make a later decision and leaving key options open and (b) channeling or constraining future land development patterns. 2. It is desirable to keep lands in the private sector in order to maintain the tax base and/or existing uses. 3. Public ownership is not necessary to achieve management objectives. 4. Funding levels or political constraints do not permit fee simple acquisition and less-than-fee acquisition is cost effective. SITE SPECIFIC OBJECTIVES 1. Mangement advantages are possible by maintaining existing ownership. Princi- pally, this involves owner maintenance and overseeing of the property. Reten- tion of the local tax base is an important factor. 2. A more precise management tool is r-equired in terms of spatial boundaries and rights acquired. Only portions of the property may need to be encumbered, and only certain interests in the property may be relevant to management objectives. 73 CHARACTERISTICS OF THE SELLER/DONOR' I A \"sympathetic\" or willing seller/donor is involved. Many public agencies do not have clear eminent domain authority for less-than-fee acquisitions. In addition, because of the undeveloped state of the appraisal art with regard to the value of limited rights in land, costs will tend to be quite high if a seller is reluctant or a court judgement is required. 2. The seller/donor desires more negotiating room or certain tax advantages. Less-than-fee arrangements can be individually tailored in terms of duration, rights conveyed, restrictions on use, and responsibilities of the respective parties. In the case of leases, the lessor may assume tax liability. Donations can provide important income tax benefits, as well as property tax relief Easements One of the most widely used less-than-fee techniques is the easement. Easements vary in nature and purpose, but can be defined generally as a limited right or set of rights over land owned by somebody else. Most easements \"run with the land\" and are, therefore, binding on succeeding owners of the property. Under most easements, compensation is granted to the property owner for the rights which are relinquished. The amount of compensation will vary depending upon the particular rights obtained as well as upon the specific nature of the property involved. In general, however, the amount of compensation can be viewed as the difference between the appraised value of the land before and after it is encumbered with the easement. Typically, easements are categoried as either affirmative or negative. Affirmative easements grant an individual a limited right to make use of someone else's property. Access rights to permit hunting and fishing are examples of this. Negative easements, on the other hand, prevent the landowner from using 'his property in certain specified ways. For example, a negative easement might limit the amount of development permitted on an individual's property, or might prevent the individual from extracting certain surface or sub-surface minerals such as sand. Easements are also commonly categorized as either appurtenant or in gross. An appurtenant easement exists when the holder of the easement owns adjoining land which the easement benefits. The classic example of an appurtenant easement is a right-of-way of an adjoining piece of property for purposes of access to the property. An easement in gross exists when the easement has nothing to do with the ownership of nearby land. Conserv"
