        "text": "Lake Superior holds 10 percent of the world’s fresh water. It is an undeniably huge resource. The lake means different things to different people, whether it’s a source of inspiration or income, or a favorite place to recreate or fish. In WTIP’s ongoing coverage, we’re taking a look at the culture and history of the Lake Superior region and investigating issues like the impacts of climate change, invasive species, development, and industry, as well as exploring how people are coming together to protect and preserve the lake.\n\nThis project is funded in part by funding from the Minnesota Arts and Cultural Heritage Fund. It was also funded in part by the Coastal Zone Management Act, by NOAA’s Office of Ocean and Coastal Resource Management in cooperation with Minnesota’s Lake Superior Coastal Program, and by the Minnesota Arts and Cultural Heritage Fund.\n\nView Archive\n\nSugarloaf Cove\n\nOn the western edge of Cook County, you can follow a trail through the woods onto a unique northeast-facing cove on Lake Superior’s North Shore. The curve of the cobbled beach displays a remarkable diversity of rocks, leading to a rich green forested point, home to over one hundred varieties of lichen and other rare plants otherwise found only near the arctic. At the end of the point is a large rocky prominence, with evidence of lava flows hinting at the long and dramatic history of this special place called Sugarloaf Cove.\n\nIn this three-part series of the Lake Superior Project, we explore the history of Sugarloaf Cove through interviews with naturalists Margie Menzies and Dominique Menard, Ojibwe Language Scholar Erik Redix, and former Sugarloaf resident Alan Ingram.\n\nEpisode One explores the geology of Sugarloaf Cove, from basaltic lava flows created 1.1 billion years ago, resulting in Lake Superior’s rugged shoreline including Sugarloaf Point, up to the age of glaciers which lasted until around 10,000 years ago.\n\nEpisode Two explores the natural history of Sugarloaf, beginning with the melting of miles-thick glaciers and eventual formation of Lake Superior, setting the stage for plant and animal life to re-emerge. Delicate arctic disjuct plants such as Hudson Bay Eyebright have managed to survive in the cool, moist microclimate of Sugarloaf Point.\n\nEpisode Three explores the human history of Sugarloaf, from early Indigenous history to the arrival of the Ojibwe, research showing a likely Ojibwe name for Sugarloaf Point (“Gaa-ozhaawaa-neyaashiing” or “Green Point”), and stories from the childhood of Alan Ingram who grew up on Sugarloaf Cove when it was owned by Consolidated Paper, Inc. Alan’s father was a forester for the paper company and made the decision to donate Sugarloaf Cove to Nature Conservancy when operations were shut down. The efforts of University of MInnesta-Duluth geologist Dr. John C. Green and the late Minnesota Gov. Elmer Andersen, among many others, led to the creation of Sugarloaf Point Scientific and Natural Area in 1992.\n\nLake Superior Project – Reserve Mining and Silver Bay, Parts I & II\n\nBeginning in 1956, the Reserve Mining Company dumped its waste rock, known as tailings, directly into Lake Superior. The newly-created town of Silver Bay was the site of its taconite processing plant, creating taconite pellets from low grade iron ore. But for every ton of pellets produced, two tons of tailings were funneled directly into Lake Superior at the rate of over 60,000 tons per day, or an estimated 45 tons per minute. By the 1960’s there were growing environmental concerns related to Lake Superior water quality.\n\nIn this two-part series, producer Martha Marnocha explores the history of Silver Bay and the events that led to a landmark environmental lawsuit related to Reserve Mining Company and Lake Superior water quality.\n\nRead the full transcript here: LSP_Reserve Mining text\n\nResearch Sources\n\nPublications:\n\nCount the Pickets in the Fence: Carl D’Aquila\n\nIron and Water: Grant Merritt\n\nThe Reserve Mining Controversy: Robert V.

The group attending from Minnesota was there to foster international collaboration and develop organizational strategies in response to the threat of lithium and nickel mining in Minnesota and abroad.\n\nRicky connects the government’s push for “green energy” with the push for lithium and nickel mining in areas like the Jadar Valley in Serbia and in Tamarack, Minnesota. These are both places where the trans-national corporation Rio Tinto is paving the way for large-scale, extractive mining operations.\n\nThe mine at Tamarack would be owned by Talon Metals and Rio Tinto, and located in the St. Croix and Mississippi River watersheds. It would also be within a few miles of Mille Lacs Ojibwe communities at Round Lake and East Lake. The Mille Lacs Community has created the Water Over Nickel initiative, in response.\n\nWith thanks to Allen Richardson and Water Legacy for photos and images. The Lake Superior Project is also funded in part by the Blandin Foundation.\n\nLake Superior Project – Agatha Armstrong and Marie Spry – Sisters and Tribal Councilors\n\nAgatha Armstrong (left) and Marie Spry (right) are sisters who serve together on the Grand Portage Band of Ojibwe Tribal Council (2023).\n\nPart I – The RTC is the governing body for the sovereign nation of Grand Portage. In this first segment Agatha and Marie explain the complexity of working with local, state and federal government agencies to accomplish the tribal nation’s goals and care for the membership, as the band recovers from an 85% loss in business due to the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\nPart II – The sisters talk about growing up with their great-aunt Philomene (Caribou) Evans who lived in Mineral Center and offer their advice for other women leaders in Anishinaabe country.\n\nThe Lake Superior Project is funded with additional help from the Blandin Foundation.\n\nLake Superior Project – Health of the Superior National Forest\n\nWTIP’s “The Lake Superior Project” is a multi-part series focusing on the Lake Superior region. In this two-part story, producer Martha Marnocha investigates the current health and historical importance of the Superior National Forest.\n\nIn part one, we hear from two U.S. Forest Service silviculturists about current threats to the health of the boreal forest in our backyard including Spruce Bud Worm, climate change and the decline of Birch species across the forest.\n\nIn part two, we hear from two foresters–Kyle Stover and Myra Theimer, about their role in managing the forest and why we should value and protect our boreal ecosystem.\n\nThanks to Kyle Stover and Myra Theimer of the Superior National Forest for their contributions to this segment.\n\nPhotos courtesy of the Superior National Forest\n\nLake Superior Project – John Lyght and the Lyght Family\n\nFor nearly 100 years the Lyght family lived and worked in Cook County. Hosey Lyght was a refugee from the deep south, who moved to Pennsylvania and worked in the mines. It was there that he met his wife Stella, before moving to the North Shore. Stella and Hosey raised 14 children in the Lutsen area and owned land on Caribou Lake. John served in the military, was first appointed part-time deputy of Cook County in 1968 and was elected Sheriff in 1972. Producer Martha Marnocha learns more about the significance of this remarkable family in this episode of The Lake Superior Project.\n\nTop: Lutsen School, date unknown; Lower: John Lyght with Hamms Bear, on the Gunflint Trail, 1974 and with County Officials, 1982.\n\nPhotos courtesy of the Cook County Historical Society.\n\nLSProject: Northeast Minnesota – A history of fire, ice and inland seas\n\nNortheast Minnesota has undergone many geologic events to produce the landscape we know today. Most of us know that glaciers left a large imprint on northeast Minnesota, but in Part 1 of a two-part series, Producer Martha Marnocha explores our geologic history before the glaciers – a period of time that lasted over three billion years and known as Minnesota’s bedrock history. Part 2 features more recent geologic history, describing the effect of glaciation. See slideshow for examples of rocks and formations.\n\nThanks to naturalist Margie Menzies for her contribution to Parts 1 and 2.\n\nIn Part 3, amateur geologist and Gunflint Trail resident Doug Turner talks about his developing interest in a “very rocky area” – the upper Gunflint Trail. Turner also shares his experience with a group of geologists who looked for – and found – evidence of an ancient fiery meteorite impact. See slideshow for photos of Doug’s dog, RockC, and examples of the Sudbury meteorite impact.\n\nLSProject: The Missing Hiker\n\nNo one heads out into the woods expecting to get lost – and the remote and heavily forested landscape along the North Shore poses unique challenges for search and rescue teams.\n\nIn the fall of 2001, medical student Jason Rasmussen became lost while hiking the Powwow Trail in Lake County. Shortly after losing the main trail, Jason became separated from his tent and gear, finding himself without shelter and facing deteriorating conditions with deep snow, high winds and very cold temperatures.\n\nProducer Martha Marnocha has created a 3-part feature on one of the longest and most compelling search and rescue stories in northeast Minnesota called “The Missing Hiker.”\n\nThanks to Peter Smerud, executive director at Wolf Ridge Environmental Learning Center, and BJ Kohlstedt, director of Lake County Emergency Management, for their contributions to this feature. Peter and BJ were both part of the Lake County Search and Rescue team participating in the search for Jason Rasmussen.\n\nFor photos of the search and rescue of Jason Rasmussen, please view the slideshow.\n\nMore information on the search for Jason Rasmussen can be found in Cary Griffith’s book, Lost in the Wild, published in 2006.\n\nScroll down to listen to the audio for all three parts.\n\nLSProject: Building canoes for the community\n\nNorth House Folk School in Grand Marais is all about showcasing life near Lake Superior and the Boundary Waters.\n\nIllustrating this, North House instructors Tom Healy, Jeanne Bourquin and Josh Tolkan, one of the new resident artisans at North House, are helping others build three wood canvas canoes.\n\nOf the three canoes coming to life in mid-April at North House, one of them comes with a specific destination. One of the wood canvas canoes will be the prize for a local raffle taking place this summer and into the fall to support the 2020 Great Place Project, which provides small grants to businesses, community groups and individuals to create great small places around Cook County.\n\nA canoe raffle has been used in years past to help fund the Great Place Project, but this is the first year the canoe has been built at North House.\n\nThe collaboration this year between North House and the Great Place Project only showcases the unique opportunities that exist on Lake Superior’s North Shore, Tolkan says.\n\nIn this installment of the Lake Superior Project, WTIP’s Joe Friedrichs visits North House Folk School to learn more about the canoe-building process and this local collaborative effort.\n\nSupport for this series comes from the Minnesota Arts and Cultural Heritage Fund.\n\nLSProject: Climate change likely to impact trout lakes near Lake Superior\n\nA changing climate continues to impact a variety of fish and wildlife management strategies in northern Minnesota. Trout species in particular are impacted by a warming climate and changes to water temperature, something fisheries biologists keep in mind while making long-term plans. Some Cook County lakes that were previously stocked with trout might not be in future, according to local and regional fisheries biologists.\n\nA lake located within the Grand Portage Reservation is one such example of this, as WTIP’s Joe Friedrichs finds out in this interview with Dr. Seth Moore, the director of wildlife and biology for the Grand Portage Band of Lake Superior Chippewa.\n\nSupport for this series comes from the Minnesota Arts and Cultural Heritage Fund.\n\nLSProject: Beavers and their relationship with the Lake Superior region\n\nThough loved by some in the Lake Superior region, beavers have been chewing their way into trouble in recent years near downtown Grand Marais and the town harbor. Indeed, Grand Marais Recreation Park Manager Dave Teersteeg says beavers are becoming problematic for some residents and park operations in Grand Marais.\n\nBeavers are the largest rodent living in North America. The easiest way to describe them is this: a swimming rat with buck teeth and a large tail. However, these rodents, while sometimes labeled as pests, can be extremely valuable for forests, wetlands and nearly everywhere they reside along the North Shore… so long as they have enough food to eat.\n\nIn this installment of the Lake Superior Project, WTIP’s Joe Friedrichs find out the value of, and occasional troubles caused by beavers.\n\nSProject: From Puerto Rico to Lake Superior\n\nLuis Cortes is used to big water. Now in his 40s, the new executive chef at Bluefin Bay Resort spent most of his adult life working at restaurants in Puerto Rico. There, salty waters washed ashore every morning and island life was everything most people only dream of. And then the storm hit.\n\nAfter Hurricane Maria ravaged the island in fall 2017, Cortes was looking for steady work on the mainland. He found it more than 2,000 miles away in Minnesota and on the shores of Lake Superior.\n\nAs WTIP has reported in numerous interviews in 2018, including with the directors of the local chamber of commerce and economic development authority, staffing issues remain a persistent issue for many Cook County employers. To address the issue, an effort was made similar to ones taking place in communities such as Branson, Missouri, which is to essentially recruit workers from Puerto Rico. The process has been mostly slow going, with Bluefin Bay Resorts on the shores of Lake Superior leading the way and finding a good success rate amongst those who travel from the island to Tofte to work and live.\n\nIn this installment of the Lake Superior Project, we find out what it’s like from moving from Puerto Rico to the shores of Lake Superior.\n\nLSProject: Quetico ranger station wraps up another season\n\nQuetico Provincial Park is situated just across the border from Minnesota in the dense forests of Ontario. During the peak paddling months, canoeists may only enter Quetico via six ranger stations which serve 21 specific entry points. Among these locations is the Cache Bay Ranger Station on ​Saganaga Lake, a post that Interior Ranger Janice Matichuk has maintained for the past 34 years.\n\nThe Cache Bay Ranger Station officially closed for the year Sept. 9, though canoeists can still fill out a form on the island and enter the park without the tips and safety reminders Matichuk is well known for providing.\n\nWTIP’s Joe Friedrichs visited the Cache Bay Ranger Station at the end of the 2018 season and shares this report."
