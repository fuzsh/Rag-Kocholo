        "text": "Garnet Lake State Forest Campground & Big Knob Forest, near Garnet and Rexton\n\nThis small campground in Mackinac County is only 18 miles away from Big Knob Forest where you can watch for bald eagles, gulls, deer, black bears and more along lakeshores, dunes and woods. LEARN MORE\n\nHarbor Island National Wildlife Refuge, Potagannissing Bay, Lake Huron, near Drummond Island\n\nThis refuge consists of two islands, Harbor and Standerson. Access is by personal boat only. Over 120 species of birds, 15 species of mammals, three species of snakes and four species of amphibians have been seen on the islands or surrounding waters. Resident species include ruffed grouse, gray jays, magnolia warblers, snowshoe hares, white-throated sparrows and white-tailed deer. LEARN MORE\n\nHorseshoe Bay Wilderness Area, Foley Creek Forest Campground, near St. Ignace\n\nThis scenic wooded area is home to white-tailed deer, raccoons, red squirrels, waterfowl, great blue herons and songbirds. It’s not unusual to spot bald eagles perching in the white pines facing Lake Huron. LEARN MORE\n\nMunuscong State Wildlife Area, Newberry, near Sault Ste. Marie\n\nThis diverse wildlife viewing area is over 14,200 acres in size. It has grasslands, marshes, potholes (very small ponds/lakes created by glaciers), and forested habitats. Birders can expect to see LeConte’s sparrows and sharp-tailed grouse, mallards, herons, wood ducks and mergansers. Rough-legged hawks and snowy owls winter here. Many mammal species also call Munuscong home including white-tailed deer, beaver, muskrat and mink. LEARN MORE\n\nTahquamenon Falls State Park, Paradise/Newberry\n\nThe gushing Upper Falls, Michigan’s largest waterfall, is about 200 feet across with a nearly 50-foot drop into the Tahquamenon River. Each second you spend at the viewing platform, more than 50,000 gallons of water are flowing right before your eyes. Downriver four miles, five smaller, tranquil waterfalls cascade around a small island, creating the Lower Falls.\n\nIn this wilderness, you can spot wolves, otters, coyotes, deer, porcupines, beavers, bears, mink, 125 species of nesting birds and more. Moose are occasionally seen feeding in the wet areas of the park, especially along M-123 between Paradise and the Lower Falls. The abundant birdlife includes spruce grouse, pileated woodpecker, bald eagle and a variety of waterfowl and songbirds. LEARN MORE\n\nWhitefish Point Bird Observatory, Paradise\n\nThis is the premier migration hot spot in Michigan. Every spring and fall, thousands of birds use this flight path to reach points north or south of this Lake Superior stopover. Sightings of over 340 bird species have been recorded in this Globally Important Bird Area. Expect to see bald and golden eagles, saw-whet, long-eared boreal and great gray owls, northern harrier, goshawk, red-tailed and rough-legged hawks, common loons, songbirds, water and shore birds, including the federally-endangered piping plover. LEARN MORE\n\nFumee Lake Natural Area, near Iron Mountain\n\nThis natural area’s 1800 acres offer four seasons of non-motorized outdoor encounters with nature and wildlife. Fumee Lake and Little Fumee Lake provide a total of five miles of undeveloped shoreline. In addition to numerous wetlands, 507 acres of surface water holds a fishery deemed \"very remarkable and unique” — so much so, no fishing equipment is allowed in the area! Since no recreational fishing has occurred for over 100 years, the fish species are larger and you can observe the bass spawning beds near shore.\n\nThe Fumee Lake region is home to rare or endangered species such as bald eagles, common loons and 19 species of orchids. Three plants on Michigan's Threatened Species list are found here: walking fern, purple cliff-brake and marsh grass-of-parnassus. You can also spot a variety of amphibians, reptiles, mammals and birds. White-tailed deer sightings are the most common, but with luck, you will see river otters, black bears, fishers, big brown bats, northern flying squirrels, pygmy shrews, star-nosed moles, coyotes, minks, snowshoe hares, badgers and woodchucks. LEARN MORE\n\nMillie Mine Bat Cave, Iron Mountain\n\nA small, inconspicuous, abandoned vertical iron mine just off of U.S. 2 is home to one of the largest hibernating/breeding bat colonies in North America. Tens of thousands of big brown and little brown bats come and go as they please through the special steel grate that prevents people from plummeting down the 360-foot steep shaft. These bats feed on insects (many of them considered pests) at night. This self-guided interpretive site is only a short walk from the parking lot and you will leave with a better understanding of the benefits of bats and the need to protect them.\n\nThe best time to view the bats is at dusk in September/October and April/May when they enter the mine to hibernate or leave. Some live in the mine year-round, but many of them return to their summer home areas throughout the Great Lakes region. LEARN MORE\n\nGarLyn Zoo Wildlife Park, Naubinway\n\nThis intimate, child-friendly zoo is nestled amid tall pines. See U.P. species such as fox, wolf, bobcat, white-tailed deer, cougar, river otter and porcupine as well as exotic animals from around the United States and the world. LEARN MORE\n\nPeninsula Point, Rapid River\n\nJutting into Lake Michigan, this point on the Stonington Peninsula is renowned as a rest stop in August and September for migrating monarch butterflies. Thousands of these insects follow an ancient 2,000-mile flight path to Mexico, a trip none of them have made yet know exactly where to go. LEARN MORE\n\nPictured Rocks National Lakeshore, Munising\n\nThe nation’s first national lakeshore has so many reasons to visit it, that wildlife viewing often gets tabled for “next time.” But when you can fit it into your itinerary, do so. The national lakeshore contains nearly 300 native vertebrates, with 58 fish, 12 amphibians, 5 reptiles, 182 birds and 42 mammal species currently identified. One Federally listed endangered species, the piping plover, can be seen at the far eastern end of the lakeshore.\n\nThe park is a long, narrow stretch of shoreline so mammals tend to move in and out of the area.\n\nWhen it comes to mammal sightings, you will see lots of chipmunks. The park’s dense foliage and large tracts of roadless land provide many hiding places so other animals are rarely seen.\n\nWant to see a moose? Sightings are extremely rare, but you could see one or more in the park’s Beaver Basin Wilderness. Black bears wander throughout the park but you are more likely to see one cross a road than along trails in the woods.\n\nWhite-tailed deer, beavers, coyotes, red foxes and bats can be seen at many points in the park and porcupines and snowshoe hares are occasionally spotted on backcountry hikes. You may be one of the rare individuals who spot a cougar, bobcat or a pack of gray wolves passing through the area — an experience you can boast about when you return home. LEARN MORE\n\nSeney National Wildlife Refuge, Seney\n\nThis 25,150-acre wildlife refuge area is a classic story of nature over entrepreneurs. Once a heavily logged, burned, ditched, drained and cultivated area, the soils and weather conditions proved to be too harsh for sustaining housing settlements and agriculture development. So, nature reclaimed the land. Now it is a breeding ground for migratory birds such as common loons, trumpeter swans, Canada geese, bald eagles and osprey. Visit in spring to listen to the birds’ mating calls and, if you are lucky, see sandhill cranes dancing.\n\nMammals that call the refuge home include beavers, muskrats, otters, white-tailed deer, fishers, mink, black bears, coyotes and wolves. On a smaller scale, this is a good place to look for turtles, spring peepers, green and mink frogs, toads, snakes, salamanders and the more elusive crab spider. LEARN MORE\n\nBrockway Mountain Audubon Wildlife Sanctuary, Copper Harbor\n\nDuring the spring and fall when bird migration reaches its peak periods, this area is known as the Hawk Highway. 18 American raptors have been sighted on this flight path aided by south and southwest winds. Set up a chair at a good vantage point on the mountain and watch the show — the common ravens soaring like kites along the cliffs will add to your entertainment. LEARN MORE\n\nDeer Marsh Interpretive Trail, Ste. Kathryn Campground, Sidnaw\n\nNovice and intermediate hikers will enjoy an up-close look at this northern wetland ecosystem. Viewing platforms, benches and interpretive signs are along the 3.1-mile fiber-chip walking loop trail. Families with children should plan on a four-hour adventure. Pack in drinking water, there is none available on the trail.\n\nBirdwatchers look for hooded mergansers, wood ducks, Great Blue Herons, American bitterns, bald eagles and ospreys. Rarer sightings of black-backed woodpeckers, boreal chickadees and trumpeter swans have been reported.\n\nCommon animals in the marsh include beavers, river otters and white-tailed deer. You might also see black bears, pine martens and eastern gray wolves. LEARN MORE\n\nIsle Royale National Park, Isle Royale\n\nIsle Royale (Minong “the good place” in Ojibwe) is one of the least visited national parks in the country. Conversely, it is also one of the most revisited and among National Geographic’s “Best of the World '' list for 2021. This rugged archipelago wilderness in Lake Superior has 450 islands, 160+ miles of wilderness trails, four lighthouses, sunken shipwrecks and no cars. It’s one of the few places in Michigan that increases your odds of seeing moose or gray wolves in the wild (you almost certainly will hear them howl).\n\nWildlife that is commonly found on the Upper Peninsula mainland is not always seen on the very remote Isle Royale. There are numerous amphibians and birds, a few reptiles and 18 mammals, including gray wolves, moose and beavers. Each species has either made the journey or been reintroduced to the island. Other mammals to look for while hiking or paddling include red foxes, ermines, mink, five types of bats, Isle Royale red squirrels and possibly Canada lynxes. Isle Royale wildlife checklist. LEARN MORE\n\nPorcupine Mountains Wilderness State Park, Visitor Center, Silver City\n\nAt nearly 60,000 acres straddling Ontonagon and Gogebic Counties, this is Michigan’s largest state park. To view wildlife, over 90 miles of hiking trails will take you to the park’s wide diversity of habitats including mature hardwood and hemlock forests, open cliff tops, the Lake Superior shoreline, wetlands and aspen and birch forests. Birdwatchers enjoy the park’s variety of seasonal birds, including bald eagles, barred owls, pileated woodpeckers, whip-poor-wills, great blue herons and American bitterns to name a few.\n\nMammals are more challenging to see, but keep on the lookout for black bears, fishers, striped skunks, hares, gray wolves, red foxes, coyotes, bobcats, porcupines and an occasional moose. If your wildlife passion is insects, the Porkies have a diversity of species including horn-tails, giant ichneumon wasps, dragonflies and stoneflies.\n\nWhen planning your visit, take in some of the popular U.P. attractions including Lake of the Clouds, Summit Peak, Lake Superior and 15 waterfalls. LEARN MORE\n\nSturgeon River Sloughs Wildlife Area & Devriendt Nature Trail, Chassell\n\nThis is one of the few areas in the Upper Peninsula with a southern-floodplain microclimate. As you hike the 1-3/4 -mile nature trail you will cross through marshes, fields and forests with abundant wildlife. Viewing highlights include black bears, raccoons, white-tailed deer, wood turtles, American bitterns, Canada geese, Northern harriers, American woodcocks and eastern bluebirds. LEARN MORE\n\nSylvania Wilderness, Ottawa National Forest, Watersmeet\n\nThe Sylvania Wilderness encompasses 18,327 acres of primitive lands and is part of the National Wilderness Preservation System. Among the wildlife that calls the national forest home are black bears, coyotes, gray wolves, white-tailed deer, bald eagles, hawks, ruffed grouse and many smaller birds and animals. LEARN MORE"
