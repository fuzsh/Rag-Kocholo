        "text": "Michigan's fall colors come first to the trees of the Keweenaw Peninsula, the state's northernmost point. The crooked finger of land that juts into Lake Superior puts on its annual show from about mid-September to early October in a stunning display of reds, oranges and golds that blankets the hills and ridges and forms colorful tunnels on winding two-lane roads.\n\nBest Enjoyed: Mid-September to Early October\n\nApproximate Length: 100 miles\n\nBegin your tour in Houghton and Hancock, the hometowns of Michigan Tech and Finlandia Universities. For a spectacular view of the two cities and surrounding, color-splashed countryside, take the Cog Rail Tram down the steep hill at the Quincy Mine in Hancock. The mine is open for tours and offers a glimpse of the mining history that gives the area its \"Copper Country\" moniker.\n\nHead north on US-41, a state Historic Scenic Route where the curving roadway competes for a driver's full attention with the tree tunnels' canopy of color. The highway, which stretches from Florida to Michigan's Copper Harbor, winds through small mining communities and past the giant snow gauge, a thermometer that measures snowfall by the foot--a sign of the season to come. At the old mining town of Phoenix, the 1858 Church of the Assumption is open to visitors. This is where you'll turn west on M-26 to Eagle River, a picturesque village that was a booming port during copper's heyday. Just before you reach the town you can stop and take a short walk to see Eagle River Falls. The 1855 Eagle River Lighthouse is now a private residence, but just west of town the Sand Hills Lighthouse Inn welcomes overnight (adult) guests.\n\nContinue on M-26 along the rocky Lake Superior shore; you'll find roadside picnic spots and scenic turnouts to absorb the beauty. The eight-mile stretch between Eagle River and Eagle Harbor, high along a sandy bluff, is known as the Sand Dune Drive. Just about three miles out of Eagle River watch for Jacob's Falls, visible from the road, and The Jampot, a bakery operated by monks, Brothers of the St. John Monastery.\n\nIn Eagle Harbor the brick lighthouse, which dates to 1871, is part of the Light Station Museum Complex and open to visitors. Follow M-26 from Eagle Harbor to Copper Harbor for some of the most dramatic scenery in the state. The section known as Brockway Mountain Drive, the highest above sea-level drive between the Rockies and the Alleghenies, was a WPA project. The 9.5 mile route is a designated Michigan Wildlife Viewing Area, and offers spectacular sunsets.\n\nCopper Harbor, the state's most northern community, is the year 'round home to just a handful of hardy souls. But from May through fall color season you can find plenty of company, comfortable lodging, delicious meals, local art, warm hospitality and the scenic beauty of this remote and rugged spot.\n\nBe sure to allow time for the narrated boat cruise to the 1866 Copper Harbor Lighthouse and Maritime Museum and 1848 lightkeeper's house. Also memorable: a quiet walk through the virgin White Pines preserved at The Estivant Pines Nature Sanctuary and a visit to Fort Wilkins State Park.\n\nCatch US-41 out of Copper Harbor en route back to Houghton/Hancock. The Michigan Scenic Heritage Route, also called the Copper Country Trail, was recently designated a National Scenic Byway. The road will take you to the Keweenaw Mountain Lodge &amp; Golf Course, another WPA project that dates to the Depression era when unemployment in the region was 85 percent. The rustic lodge features a nine-hole course, fine dining, and sleeping in log structures with stone fireplaces.\n\nContinuing south of Copper Harbor is the authentic Delaware Mine, which yielded eight million pounds of the metal between 1847-1887. The scenic route continues through wonderful forests and through the city of Calumet, which was the cultural and commercial center of the Keweenaw Copper Range. Take time to visit the restored Calumet Theater and the red sandstone buildings of the downtown business district. This is the heart of the Keweenaw National Historic Park, which recognizes the importance of the mining history of this rugged and scenic region.\n\nQuincy Mine Properties\n\n49750 US Hwy 41\n\nHancock, MI 49930\n\nPhone: (906) 482-3101\n\nThe Quincy Mine is located in the Keweenaw Peninsula in Michigan's Upper Peninsula. Mining operations have been closed for many years, but the site is preserved as a cooperating site of the Keweenaw National Historical Park. We offer two options for touring the Quincy Mine Site. On both our Surface Tour and our Full Tour, you will tour the Museum(located in the 1894 No. 2 Hoist Building), the inside of the No. 2 Shaft House (which was built in 1908 to streamline processing of material brought up from the deep mine shaft), the Norderg Steam Hoist building (built in 1918, it houses the Nordberg Steam Hoist, the world's largest steam-powered hoist engine which made it possible to extend the No. 2 Mine Shaft 92 levels underground!), and you'll ride the Cog Rail Tram, which takes you down the steep hill that overlooks the Portage Lake Lift Bridge to the East Adit (mine entrance). On our full tour, you'll get off the tram car and ride by tractor-pulled wagon seven levels underground into the mine. You can wrap up your Quincy Mine Tour by stopping by our Gift Shop where you'll find items such as mining-related books, videos, copper gift items & jewelry, clothing, artwork by local artisans, plus many other mine-related souvenirs!
