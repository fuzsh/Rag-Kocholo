        "text": "For Editors\n\nWhen places get renamed or a new one gets made don't rename the page make a new one. A location which needs to be made is Tough Town (It's a retired location)\n\nRounds Map\n\nOverview\n\nThe Rounds map came out on the 22nd of May 2019 and was only possible of playing in it by using the Gamemodes FFA and TDM right now it does not have any names for the locations and is a lot smaller than the Battle Royale Map.\n\nList of Current Locations\n\nTopsy Towers (Top Left)\n\nSlightly modified Tiny Town (Top Right)\n\nTempting Temple or Talking Temple with a big tower (Bottom Left)\n\nOuter Oasis (Bottom Right)\n\nBattle Royale Map\n\nOverview\n\nThe Map is one of the vital objects in the game. You can see 29 locations on the map. The image of the map can be shown in HD on the right side of the page. To view the other maps (which are all the same resolution) scroll down from this page until you get to 'Media'.\n\nList of Current Locations\n\nBus\n\nStarter Settlement\n\nCaptivating Civilization\n\nCrummy City\n\nDeath Dip\n\nDirty Depot\n\nFreaky Fields\n\nGoose Grove\n\nHappy Hillside\n\nHidden Haven\n\nHollowed Hill\n\nHunky Hole\n\nLil'er Lake\n\nLonely Land\n\nMini Mountain\n\nNeedy Neighborhood\n\nOucast Oasis\n\nPirate Plaza\n\nPleasant Place\n\nPyramid Point\n\nSliding Settlement\n\nTalking Temple\n\nTeaser Town\n\nTempting Temple\n\nTender Town\n\nTiny Town\n\nTopsy Towers\n\nValliant Village\n\nVolatile Volcano\n\nWonkey Willows\n\nRemoved/Renamed Locations\n\nThese are all the removed and renamed locations in Island Royale.\n\nThese locations may still exist in the game, titled under a different name, but have lost their ownership/tag for being a location.\n\nThese locations, however, may be introduced back into the game, in a later, major update.\n\nCalm Cove\n\nChristmas Tree\n\nCrescent Cove\n\nCrumbling Cove\n\nCrystal\n\nFunky Forest\n\nHopeful Hillside\n\nHorrified Hillside\n\nInteresting Inlet\n\nLame Lake\n\nLil Lake\n\nLucky Land\n\nMini Mountain\n\nMoving Mountain\n\nNeat Neighborhood\n\nOuter Oasis\n\nPewny Pond\n\nRocky Rubble\n\nSad Settlement\n\nSanta\n\nShallow Shore\n\nSlippy Shores\n\nTough Town\n\nVacant Volcano\n\nViolent Volcano\n\nVolatile Volcano\n\nWashy Waters\n\nFacts and Tips\n\nStarter Settlement is seen on the current versions of the Map. It can be also seen from the Battle Bus and from the west side of the Island. But, in the other Maps it was not shown.\n\nTopsy Towers was usually the most crowded place, until the Christmas Trees were removed. However, the Snowy Update to the map which introduced the Christmas Tree dominated Topsy Towers. This is because the chests are like gifts around the Christmas Tree and the gifts often give out Legendary weapons.\n\nThe Bus acts like a place on the map but without a name and moves across the map.\n\nTopsy Towers towers is one of the only locations which haven't got renamed.\n\nThe volcano erupted in October 6, 2018, causing the map to permanently change.\n\nWhen snow came in the winter update most of the sand around the map just disappeared.\n\nThe snow dominated around one third of the the map, leaving the grassy area in the middle of the two opposite lands. It was updated during the \"Christmas\" update.\n\nSlippy Shore and Slippy Shores are the same place but in different times.\n\nThe map is different depending on the Gamemode.\n\nRounds Map Media\n\nBattle Royale Map Media\n\nMedia"
