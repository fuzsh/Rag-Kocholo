        "meta_description": "The trails in and around Rock Harbor and the eastern end of the park offer the most variety of any on Isle Royale. For an afternoon of craggy coastline and pounding Lake Superior surf, the Albert Stoll Memorial Trail travels east of the lodge to the end of Scoville Point. This easy loop of 4.2 miles begins at Rock Harbor Lodge and travels 2 miles east to rugged Scoville Point. The trail winds back and forth between the forest and the shoreline, where craggy bluffs and sharp cliffs are testimony to Lake Superior's power and persistent erosion.",

For reservations, contact the park concessionaire, Forever Resorts (866-644-2003 or 906-337-4993 in summer; www.isleroyaleresort.com).\n\nIsle Royale National Park opens April 16 and closes on Nov. 1 to all visitors for the winter. The park has a entrance fee of $7 per person per day or an annual pass for $60. You can pay the entrance fee once you arrive at the park or in advance at at pay.gov and avoid congestion and long waits on the island.
