Typically, they are the worst in late June and early July. Please check current conditions in the park for the most up-to-date information.\n\nCamping\n\nWe would like to go to Isle Royale for an overnight camping trip, but there are only 2 of us, and I read that you only take reservations for groups of 7 or more.\n\nParties of 6 or less are defined as \"individual parties\", meaning that reservations cannot be made. Parties of 6 or less, unlike groups, do not have to follow their permit's itinerary. Permits are obtained on the Ranger III en route to Isle Royale, or at the Rock Harbor or Windigo Visitor Centers upon arrival with other transportation providers. Groups of 7 to 10 must obtain advance reservations, must camp in group campsites, and must stick to their itinerary.\n\nWhat are my chances of getting a campsite during the busy season?\n\nIsle Royale's busy season is from mid-July through mid-September. Visitors should expect busy, crowded conditions at campgrounds and docks during this time. If campsites are full, we ask that you share with another camping party.
