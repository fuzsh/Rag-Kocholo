        "text": "Copper Harbor's rich history traces back to the native Ojibwa people and the area's copper mining boom in the mid-1800s. The town was a significant port during this period, giving it its distinctive name. Now it serves as a gateway for travelers looking to connect deeply with nature and with their adventurous sides.\n\nCopper Harbor boasts some of the best mountain biking trails in the Midwest, thanks to the International Mountain Bicycling Association. The town's extensive trail system, with options for all levels, guarantees adrenaline-fueled adventures. Nat Geo Photographer Michael George is no stranger to road cycling, but mountain biking is best learned first with the support of an expert. Michael starts his day by meeting with Keweenaw Adventure Company guide Bonesy Jones to go on a mountain biking adventure to Brockway Mountain. The flow, one of the longer biking routes in the area, is a point-to-point route that includes berms, twists, and turns, and then ends with a wooden cantilever bridge-perfect for the more experienced riders.\n\nAfter testing his mountain biking abilities (and loving it), Michael heads for a hike to the Brockway Mountain Overlook, where views of Copper Harbor and the coast can be seen for miles.\n\nHikers will also find a wealth of trails, including the Hunter's Point Park trail. This 2-mile trail is a favorite for its scenic views of Lake Superior and opportunities for bird-watching. The Estivant Pines Nature Sanctuary, home to ancient white pine forests, also offers serene paths amid towering trees that are hundreds of years old.\n\nPost-hike, Michael and Bonesy throw on wetsuits and head out for a sea kayaking journey through Lake Superior's azure waters. The lake's waters remain cold year-round, so wetsuits and proper gear are required. For visitors looking for kayak tours, the Keweenaw Adventure Company offers an array of options. From the water, Michael can see geologic features like the arch rock, which has the largest span of any arch on the northern end of the barrier islands. On clear days, kayakers can also spot a sunken vessel under the water.\n\nOne of the most magical experiences that Copper Harbor offers is the chance to witness the Aurora Borealis. On clear nights, the town's minimal light pollution makes it an excellent spot for stargazing and catching this ethereal natural phenomenon.\n\nParts of the Keweenaw are designated as an International Dark Sky Park, with the Keweenaw Mountain Lodge as its headquarters. At the end of his day, Michael meets up with local photographer Chris Guibert to head to Brockway Mountain, just a short trip from the Lodge. On this evening, the sky was clear and offered a quick dance of the northern lights."
