        "text": "SwiftKnowledge, LLC, a global provider of web-based business intelligence (BI) software, announced recently the purchase of essentially all of the assets of SwiftKnowledge, Inc., including all of its intellectual property.\n\nThe purchase was made by Robert Olson, who assumes the role of chief executive officer (CEO) of SwiftKnowledge, LLC. Olson was founder, chairman of the board and CEO for Stellent, Inc., an Eden Prairie, Minn.-based enterprise content management software provider acquired by Oracle Corp. for $440M in March 2007. SwiftKnowledge, Inc. was a privately held company founded in 1999 by Daniel Moloney, Ph.D. and Allie Gentry, who recognized the need for easily deployable, web-based business intelligence solutions designed for and used by non-technical business users. More than 10,000 users worldwide utilize SwiftKnowledge products, which are built on an established BI technology that has been awarded several patents for its unique security and scalability functionalities.\n\n\"I'm excited about the opportunity at SwiftKnowledge, LLC for a number of reasons,\" said Olson. \"I'm particularly excited about the instant business benefits SwiftKnowledge's BI technology provides to organizations, given today's challenging financial environment. The leading-edge product can be deployed very quickly and is easily used, putting great power in the hands of business users.\n\n\"I'm also excited by the strong parallels I see between the emerging content management market of the 1990s - of which Stellent was a pioneer - and today's web-based BI market. For each market, rapid deployment, ease of use by non-technical business users, a standards-based architecture and salient business benefits were key requirements for a viable, lasting technology solution. Stellent met these needs – securing market leadership recognition because of it - and I believe SwiftKnowledge is uniquely positioned to do the same for today's BI market.\n\n\"Additionally, the SwiftKnowledge technology is readily deployable in a cloud computing environment - which significantly decreases both upfront and ongoing costs - and lends itself favorably to an on-demand, Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) business model. I believe this approach will be a strong growth area for us because we are uniquely suited to address this area of the BI market, which is growing rapidly. With appropriate funding, an experienced management team and continued execution, I believe SwiftKnowledge represents a great opportunity for growth.\"\n\nOlson retained all SwiftKnowledge, Inc. employees, including Moloney and Gentry. Moloney assumes the roles of president and chief operating officer at SwiftKnowledge, LLC; Gentry is the new company's chief technology officer and chief financial officer.\n\n\"The current economic climate demands organizations have immediate, increased visibility into their business,\" said Moloney. \"SwiftKnowledge's powerful BI software quickly and economically gives companies easy, flexible, unified access to data, so they are alerted when opportunities or issues arise, and can take proactive measures to address them. With Bob's guidance and leadership, we believe our technology and company now are poised to reach their full potential.\"\n\nInitially, SwiftKnowledge will focus on specific vertical markets – such as banking - for which the company offers comprehensive, integrated solutions consisting of pre-packaged applications and configured components.\n\n\"SwiftKnowledge gives banks a strong platform on which to grow profitably by helping them manage, track and report on liquidity, risk, customer metrics, prospect metrics and other key performance indicators in real-time - a critical capability right now,\" concluded Olson. \"And, the patented security model is uniquely suited to a banking environment where security is a primary issue.\"\n\nAbout SwiftKnowledge, LLC\n\nSwiftKnowledge, LLC is a global software provider of powerful, patented business intelligence (BI) technology which drives strategic metrics and enables better decision-making throughout an organization. Via an easy-to-use, integrated analytic solution specifically designed for non-technical business users, this 100 percent web-based technology gives organizations real-time, secure access to multiple data sources for proactive, effective management of key performance indicators."
