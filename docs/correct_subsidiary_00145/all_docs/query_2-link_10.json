        "text": "Contact:\n\nChad Eckes\n\nDirector of Marketing and Product Management\n\nemail: ceckes@sajan.com\n\nphone: 877-426-9505\n\nBased in Ireland, Sajan Software, Ltd. will house and support cloud-based translation technologies\n\nRIVER FALLS, Wis. – October 20, 2009 – Sajan, the leader in on-demand translation technology and services, today announced the launch of Sajan Software, Ltd., a new wholly-owned subsidiary dedicated to advancing cloud-based translation technologies. Based in Dublin, Ireland, Sajan Software, Ltd. will drive and support the continued evolution of Sajan’s leading edge translation management system, and its broader suite of localization solutions. The launch celebrates Sajan’s deep commitment to next generation software and global market leadership. Vern Hanzlik, former CEO of Stellent (acquired by Oracle in 2006) has been named president of the new company. Additionally, a new brand name, Sajan Software™, is being created.\n\nLeadership in Cloud-based Translation Management\n\nAt its core, Sajan Software is a world-class technology company offering advanced translation management technologies, such as its acclaimed GCMS™, which was rated the #1 translation management system (TMS) by industry analysts. The new company underscores Sajan’s reputation for technological innovation in the localization industry, and officially positions its solutions as freestanding applications, to be used independently or in concert with the company’s translation services. Sajan asked Vern Hanzlik, a seasoned technology executive and current Sajan chief marketing officer, to lead the new company. Hanzlik successfully built and led Stellent, a global leader in enterprise content management systems, through its most prolific and innovative years.\n\n“The launch of Sajan Software represents Sajan’s longstanding commitment to the future of cloud-based translation technology,” said Vern Hanzlik, president, Sajan Software. “Beyond the solutions themselves, our product development strategies are backed by long-term investments in R&D and engineering talent.”\n\nRecognizing that cloud-based computing offers an unprecedented cost savings opportunity for large enterprises, Sajan Software provides a pioneering usage model for customers. Specifically, the company offers its TMS through an incremental, volume-based approach, which will allow large enterprises to adopt new technology with lower risk and investment.\n\nCore Technologies\n\nHistorically, Sajan has been the only language service provider offering on-demand technology fused with ISO certified services. As globalization advances and translation markets evolve, Sajan recognizes that large enterprises seek to centralize content while sourcing translation and other services to numerous, localized vendors. Sajan Software offers a system to manage content itself and the way in which it flows to and from vendors, such as language service providers (LSPs).\n\nThrough Sajan Software’s core offerings, including the Sajan Global Communication Management System (GCMS™), Sajan Authoring Coach™, and Sajan X-Content Integration™, the company delivers dynamic multilingual software solutions from an on-demand language platform that spans the entire lifecycle of globalization efforts. The entire suite of software has been built and scaled for the web, with an emphasis on true virtualization.\n\nStrategically, Sajan Software will focus exclusively on translation management technology, which Sajan has already spent more than six years developing. While some translation software providers have broadened their product scope by developing or purchasing related technologies, such as content management systems (CMS) and customer relationship management (CRM) platforms, Sajan Software intends to be more agile and innovative through a number of strategic alliances.\n\nCOMSYS, a leading provider of Global Content Supply Chain Services, recently has partnered with Sajan based on their unmatched TMS functionality. “Our thought leadership in this space has been greatly complimented by Sajan’s continued innovation. The Sajan solution fits nicely into the COMSYS vision of providing a managed translation service where measureable, ongoing cost reduction is a reality,” said Norman Newton, vice president, COMSYS. “We’re excited to be working with such a distinguished global software provider, especially given their announcement today.”\n\nSajan recently released the latest version of its robust TMS solution, GCMS 5.0. The new release provides existing Sajan customers architectural and functional enhancements, all aimed at improving the quality and speed of translation projects.\n\nThe Importance of Geography\n\nAfter reviewing a number of possible locations, Sajan selected Dublin, Ireland as the headquarters for Sajan Software. Ireland’s reputation as a business-friendly country with deep roots in linguistics and translation fits well with Sajan Software’s overall business strategy, and the location also affords more immediate access to European customers. Sajan worked very closely with the Irish government to open the Sajan Software offices, including active support from IDA Ireland (Investment and Development Agency).\n\nSajan’s expansion into Europe builds on its recent move into India. In December 2008, the company opened an office dedicated to software research, development, quality assurance and operations in New Delhi.\n\nAn Integrated Approach to Localization\n\nIn concert with the launch of Sajan Software, Sajan has decided to also distinguish its highly respected translation services unit as Sajan Global Language Services™. Current offerings include document translation, website localization, multilingual DTP, globalization consulting, and software localization. Even though the formation of Sajan Software gives Sajan’s technology a more distinct identity, Sajan Global Language Services customers will benefit from an integrated service approach.\n\n“Our fusion of service and technology allows clients to more rapidly scale their globalization efforts without having to pay exorbitant amounts on software and/or support fees,” said Shannon Zimmerman, CEO of Sajan. “The launch of Sajan Software celebrates this strategy and will only increase the strength or our services group. We’ve been doing this for a long time, and are delighted to have a veteran like Vern Hanzlik lead the business.”\n\nAbout Sajan\n\nSajan is the innovative way to obtain language translation solutions. Sajan’s language translation technology provides not only a Translation Management System, GCMS, to serve as the operating platform, but also provides users with flexible delivery models and a transparency to all aspects of the Localization process while delivering previously unrealized business results."
