What is Data Curation?\n\n4. “Data Curation is maintaining and adding value to, a trusted body of digital information for current and future use; It encompasses the active management of data throughout the research lifecycle. Digital Curation Centre (DCC) http://www.dcc.ac.uk/about-us/dcc-charter/dcc-charter-and-statement-principles What is Data Curation?\n\n5.

How to Organize Data? Metadata Standard: Dublin Core 15 standard elements for describing data resources http://wiki.dublincore.org/index.php/User_Guide http://seopressor.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/dublin-core-elements-2.jpg\n\n19. How to Organize Data? https://library.stanford.edu/research/data-management-services/data-best-practices/best-practices-file-naming Tips for File Renaming ✓ Date format - YYYYMMDD or YYMMDD ✗ Use too long File names ✗ Use Special characters, e.g. ~ ! @ # $ % ^ & * ( ) ` ; < > ? , [ ] { } ' \" | Use leading “0” for clarity and to ensure files sort in sequential order ✓ \"001, 002, ...010, 011 ... 100, 101, etc.\" ✗ \"1, 2, ...10, 11 ... 100, 101, etc.\" File names with spaces must be enclosed in quotes ✓ Underscores, e.g. file_name.xxx ✓ Dashes, e.g. file-name.xxx ✓ No separation, e.g. filename.xxx ✓ Camel case, e.g. FileName.xxx ✗ Use spaces, e.g. file name.xxx Tools OS Free? Bulk Rename Utility Windows Yes Renamer 4 Mac PSRenamer Linux, Mac, or Windows Yes\n\n20. How to Organize Data? Tips for Organizing Spreadsheet Be consistent ✓ Use consistent codes for categorical variables Fill in all of the cells ✓ Use “NA” or “-” to fill the blank cells for missing data Create a data dictionary ✓ Use a separate file to describe the data No calculations in the raw data files ✗ Use calculations and graphs in the raw data file Don’t use font color or highlighting as data ✓ Use an additional column that indicates the outliers Make backups ✓ Make a copy of the file with a new version number, e.g. file_v1.xlsx, file_v2.xlsx ✓ Write-protect the file when finished entering the data For more details: http://kbroman.org/dataorg/\n\n21.
