        "text": "CVS Health needed to modernize an outdated knowledge management system that was based on proprietary legacy technology. The company selected Hyland's Nuxeo Platform, in part, because the open-source and highly scalable platform enables CVS customer care representatives to quickly access the most current coverage details for their customers’ plans. Nuxeo Platform also provided the company with the flexibility to introduce new solutions in the future without worrying about being constrained by proprietary technology.\n\nCVS Health Corporation is an American retail pharmacy and health care company. At the time the company selected Nuxeo Platform, it ranked seventh on the Fortune 500 and 18th on the Fortune Global 500 list. CVS Health subsidiaries — which include CVS Pharmacy, CVS Caremark, CVS Specialty and MinuteClinic — employ more than 200,000 people and are household names in retail and healthcare/pharmacy in North America.\n\nWanted: A new ECM solution\n\nCVS Health is a “pharmacy innovation company,” with innovation playing a critical role in its overall mission: Helping people on their path to better health. This focus extends beyond the retail pharmacy aspect of its operations, for which it is most widely known. CVS is continuously looking at how it can modernize its back-office processes and IT landscape in a manner that enables the company to deliver on its mission.\n\nFor more than a decade, CVS Health had been using a knowledge management solution called CareSource, which is a mission-critical solution that 20,000 to 25,000 customer care agents use to help serve the retail pharmacies, specialty providers and other health care entities CVS Health supports.\n\nExecutive management and IT leadership recognized that CareSource was built on aging legacy technology that needed to be replaced. The underlying architecture was outdated and had not been refreshed in more than 10 years. As a result, agility and flexibility was limited, and the platform couldn’t keep up with the demands of the business.\n\nRelated articles\n\nCase Management\n\nRecords Management\n\nElectronic File Management\n\nNuxeo Platform is a flexible, highly scalable alternative\n\nThe IT team at CVS Health was given guidance from executive leadership to update their knowledge management platform with a modern, open-source approach that would reduce the company’s dependence on IBM, Oracle and other proprietary solutions.\n\n“We ended up looking at both proprietary solutions and open-source offerings,\" a CVS Health representative said. \"We wanted to evaluate everything because we weren’t sure about the maturity of open-source solutions. This is a business-critical operation for us, so we had to look at all options.”\n\nCVS Health evaluated several vendors and ultimately selected Nuxeo Platform because the highly scalable and open-source content platform provided the company with the flexibility to introduce new solutions in the future without worrying about being constrained by proprietary technology.\n\nCVS Health engaged with Hyland to assist their incumbent system integrator on the deployment of a new knowledge management solution called “TheSource.”\n\nSmooth transition to full deployment\n\nBecause of its mission-critical nature, CVS Health took a phased approach in how it transitioned its solution from IBM FileNet to Nuxeo Platform. The company ran the old system (CareSource) in parallel with the new Nuxeo Platform-based system (TheSource) for three months to help ensure a smooth and seamless transition. With Nuxeo Platform as its foundation, TheSource went live.\n\nTheSource is a mission-critical solution that facilitates internal communication between more than 60 internal CVS departments, including mail services, clinical services, patient care, specialty providers and more. Having the most accurate and up-to-date documentation is critical.\n\nSearch improvements improve customer service\n\nEvery employer CVS Health works with has a different plan and different coverage levels for their staff. As one would expect, it’s vital that CVS Health call center representatives are able to quickly access the most current coverage details for each plan.\n\n“If the CDC makes an announcement about a drug recall or another situation like that where it’s absolutely vital that our call center reps must know about something immediately, we’re confident that the Nuxeo Platform will enable us to inform our reps ASAP,\" a CVS Health rep said. \"This is critical not only for our business, but also for the well-being of the millions of people who use CVS services through their employers.”\n\nNuxeo Platform replaces another legacy system\n\nCVS leveraged the success of the initial project with Nuxeo Platform (TheSource) to embark on a second project to replace Oracle Stellent, which was used as a content management solution for managing policies, procedures and content for internal and external portals. Similar guidance from executive leadership was given for this project — find an open, modern and highly-scalable platform to replace their aging legacy system.\n\nIn addition to the open and adaptable nature of its content services platform, CVS chose Nuxeo Platform because of its multi-tenant content services architecture, which allowed CVS to provide separate content workflow software, metamodels and security models isolated and configured to meet the specific needs of each of its tenant stakeholder groups. The platform also provided seamless enablement of push publication of content to downstream portal applications using workflow and event-driven automation.\n\nThe second project to replace Oracle was completed in under six months and is now 100% operational.\n\nTo remember:\n\nTransitioned from Filenet\n\nSelected Nuxeo Platform because it is highly scalable, open-source and has a multi-tenant feature\n\nOracle replacement was completed in under six months"
