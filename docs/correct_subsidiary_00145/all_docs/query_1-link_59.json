        "text": "Oracle is near a deal to acquire Hyperion Solutions, which makes software that allows corporations to analyze and track their performance, for more than $3.1 billion, according to people briefed on the deal.\n\nThe acquisition is expected to be announced as early as today, these people said.\n\nThe deal would be the latest trophy in a lengthy string of acquisitions by Oracle, the database software giant that has been struggling to grow from within.\n\nIn December, Oracle posted strong earnings growth for its second fiscal quarter, but its growth in license sales disappointed investors. The company said at the time that it had failed to close some crucial licensing deals during the quarter. License sales rose 28 percent in the quarter, but that was down from 80 percent growth in the previous quarter.\n\nExact terms of the deal could not be learned last night.\n\nShares of Hyperion slipped 25 cents yesterday in regular trading, to $42.84, giving it a market value of about $2.5 billion. Oracle shares closed at $16.43, up 14 cents. Representatives for Oracle, which is based in Redwood City, Calif., and Hyperion, with headquarters in Santa Clara, Calif., could not be reached for comment.\n\nOracle has long been known as one of the most aggressive acquirers of technology companies.\n\nLed by Lawrence J. Ellison, who sees acquisitions as a tool for growth, the company has at times seemed on the verge of gobbling nearly every rival in the business software market. In the last three years, Oracle spent more than $20 billion on acquisitions, including buying two of its most formidable competitors, PeopleSoft and Siebel.\n\nPeopleSoft, the company Oracle fought over for nearly two years, was its most notable deal.\n\nIn December 2004, after a battle for control that grew nasty, Oracle finally acquired PeopleSoft for about $10.3 billion, becoming the second-largest maker of business-management software.\n\nThe day after completing the deal, Oracle fired four top officers of PeopleSoft.\n\nSince that deal, Oracle’s appetite has been unsatiated. In 2005, the company bought a stake in I-flex Solutions, a maker of financial software based in Mumbai, India, for a reported $909 million.\n\nWithin the last year, Oracle has struck a series of deals, including a $5.9 billion acquisition of Siebel Systems and a $440 million purchase of Stellent last year.\n\nHyperion would be one of the last pieces to complete Oracle’s strategy. Founded in 1981 as IMRS, Hyperion has grown into one of the biggest makers of business analysis software through its Hyperion System 9 suite.\n\nFor the 2006 fiscal year, the company reported $765 million in revenue.\n\nHyperion itself has grown through a series of deals, notably a 1998 merger with Arbor Software that brought the popular Essbase database software program into its fold.\n\nHyperion has long been speculated about as a merger partner with Business Objects, another business analysis software maker, according to analysts.\n\nIndeed, the two companies held talks this year, but those negotiations collapsed over price and other issues, people briefed on them said.\n\nOracle has talked to half a dozen companies recently about acquiring them, according to people familiar with those talks. Hyperion has long been on that list.\n\nLast year, The Mercury News in San Jose ranked Hyperion’s executive chairman, Jeffrey R. Rodek, as No. 49 among the highest-paid executives in Silicon Valley.\n\nMr. Rodek, who became chairman and chief executive in 1999 and executive chairman in 2004, received $11.01 million in compensation in 2005, including salary and stock options."
