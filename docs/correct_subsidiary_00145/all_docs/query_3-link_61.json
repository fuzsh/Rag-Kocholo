Do this.\n\nDo you need to make any code changes after applying the Oracle SOA Suite 11g PS6 (11.1.1.7) patchset?\n\nYes, this upgrade requires a few code modifications. So search for the following terms in your code to see if you are affected:\n\nsetProperty\n\nout.header.wsse_Security\n\nIssue 1: setProperty function requires strings now\n\nIf you are using the setProperty function, you need to force the variable to be a string.\n\nAfter the 11.1.1.7 patchset, this no longer works:\n\nselect='mhdr:setProperty(\"out.property.replyToAddress\",$ReplyToAddress)'\n\nInstead, force the variable into a string, in this example $ReplyToAddress:\n\nselect='mhdr:setProperty(\"out.property.replyToAddress\",string($ReplyToAddress))'/>\n\nIssue 2: Using out.header in an XSL transform may not work\n\nAfter the 11.1.1.7 patchset, you can no longer set the outbound security header in an XSL transformation as follows:\n\nselect=\"mhdr:setProperty('out.header.wsse_Security/wsse:Security/wsse:UsernameToken/wsse:Username', $Username)\"/>\n\nMove the logic into the Mediator .mplan file instead:\n\n<assign>\n\n<copy target=\"$out.property.endpointURI\" value=\"$in.property.endpointURI\"/>\n\n<copy target=\"$out.header.a_ReplyTo/a:ReplyTo/a:Address\" value=\"$in.property.wsa.replyToAddress\"/>\n\n<copy target=\"$out.property.replyToAddress\" value=\"$in.property.wsa.replyToAddress\"/>\n\n</assign>\n\nApplicable Versions:\n\nOracle SOA Suite 11g (11.1.1.7)\n\n↧\n\n↧\n\nConsidering speaking at UKOUG Tech 14? Why I travel overseas to attend UKOUG every year\n\nI have been traveling to attend the UKOUG Tech Conference every year for the past 3 years. Not only is this at my own expense, there is lost income and time away from family to travel internationally from the United States to attend the event.\n\nWhy do I do it? It's simple.\n\nPresentations are top-notch. Less sales-centric and more technology focused. Much preferred over Oracle OpenWorld.\n\nI try to present as much as I can. I love sharing my experiences with others and the registration fee is waived by being a presenter.\n\nIndividual one-on-one time with Oracle Product Managers/Directors who fly in from the United States, whom I never would have been able to spend time with at Oracle OpenWorld because of the craziness there.\n\nBeing in December, just a few short months after Oracle OpenWorld, you get to attend many of those presentations.\n\nI am going again this year and submitted 2 abstracts (and hope they are accepted!). Contrary to popular belief, you don't need to be an expert or a seasoned presenter. Simply talk about a single use case, a performance tuning tip you ran into, high level design your team came up with, anything... and in any Oracle technology area.\n\nIt's fun. You'll learn. And you'll be surprised at the number of people sharing your experiences and wanting to know more. If you attend, hit me up on LinkedIn and let's meet.\n\nSubmit an abstract. Go for free. Learn & network.\n\n↧\n\nI've submitted two abstracts to UKOUG Tech 14? Have you?\n\n↧\n\nAdam Savage at Collaborate 14\n\nAdam Savage, best known as the co-host of \"MythBusters\" on the Discovery Channel, appeared at Collaborate 14 in Las Vegas as one of the Keynote Speakers on Tuesday, April 9th. Adam is also a longtime special-effects artist, fabricator, model maker and general dreamer-upper who has worked on films such as Galaxy Quest and the Matrix sequels as well as Episodes I and II of the Star Wars series.\n\nIn his presentation, he spoke mainly on the fundamental ideas many people have about both art and science, how the two subjects are similar and why the two have been twin propellers pushing us forward as a species. Adam believes that art and science are more alike than people originally perceive, that both subjects are expressed in ways which are unique and thought provoking, and they are both a reflection of our progress as a species. He compares the two, saying there are high and low points with each, and somewhere in the middle is where we usually place ourselves. Adam stressed that nothing is too obscure or beyond our understanding. Art and science are very much a part of who we are as people and a society, and continued knowledge of both is the only way we can actively improve our way of life. Adam explained how art is a direct response to what happens in the science world, and that they work hand in hand for us to explain who we are and what we are doing, and the more self generating ideas you come up with the more you can come up with. He encouraged the audience to pay attention to patterns, participate and question everything.\n\nClosing his hour, he answered questions in length about his time on \"Mythbusters\" and the relationship he has with the co-star Jamie Hyneman. He explains that their differences help their scientific process by pushing their ideas forward until they have covered every angle and every possible outcome. \"Mythbusters\" is the perfect example of how working as a team helps to develop the best practices and outcomes. He warns that science is still unpredictable, and it is difficult to eliminate every variable in every situation. He describes the approach he has to science, looking at it from different perspectives until it makes sense in his own head, a practice he learned from watching his father paint. This process helps him respect the importance of working as a team and collaborating together.\n\n↧\n\nUnable to retrieve composite detail in EM Fusion Middleware Control\n\nProblem:\n\nWhen logging in to the Oracle Enterprise Manager 11g Fusion Middleware Control console to view the details of the SOA composite, you might receive the following error when you click on the composite:\n\nUnable to retrieve composite detail.\n\nThe composite X is not available.

They can be found here, here, and many other places. The one thing I had not yet seen was how exactly to use it when using the new Swift Language that Apple recently released.\n\nBelow is the code that can be used, and there are a two changes to note that have come with the iOS 8 SDK. The first is UIImagePickerControllerSourceType where before you would access it by calling UIImagePickerControllerSourceTypeCamera now you call UIImagePickerControllerSourceType.Camera . The second has more to do with strings different types, CFString vs NSString so to deal with this little issue the following code exists:\n\nlet compResult:CFComparisonResult = CFStringCompare(mediaType as NSString!, kUTTypeImage, CFStringCompareFlags.CompareCaseInsensitive)\n\nif ( compResult == CFComparisonResult.CompareEqualTo ) {\n\nOther than that there are the obvious differences between Objective-C and Swift.

Safra Catz, one of the two newly appointed CEO's of Oracle, who has been with Oracle for 15 years started out the afternoon Keynote by saying that even though he has stepped down as CEO, \"Larry Ellison’s vision is more alive today than ever.\" Then, Catz introduced her friend and fellow industry leader Renee James, and, after the two leading females snagged a quick hug from one another, James took the stage to share her keynote on \"The Future of the Data Center in a Software-Defined World.\"\n\nRenee, President of Intel Corporation, described her excitement of being the \"opening act\" for Larry Ellison and how this year marks a 20-year partnership between Oracle and Intel. She began her keynote by trying to convey the massive quantities in which data is being used today, and how much data will be being used in the future. She says making sense of all the data is the key to providing meaningful insights into the human condition.\n\nIn her keynote, James talked about \"Big Bang\" of data, private cloud vs. public cloud, the Next Generation firewall, the first Silicon photonics chip, and something called the Nile-o-Meter. She explained that 90% of the data today, was produced in the last 2 years. She described the partnership between Intel and Oracle, and how the two companies are working together to provide value in the areas of private cloud, in many cases exceeding that of the public cloud. Also, she spoke about the future of private and public clouds, saying that it is possible for private clouds to have similar costs to public clouds, and how 47% of workloads are expected to be running in a hybrid mode by 2017. Lastly, she gave the crowd a sneak peak at Intel's new silicon photonics chip, which is able to move data faster than traditional copper over longer distances.\n\nRenee introduced Larry Ellison, donning his new title of Chief Technology Officer and Executive Chairman of the Board at Oracle. Ellison stepped down as CEO in the weeks prior to Oracle OpenWorld 2014. Ellison took the stage and welcomed the OOW 14 attendees. He began the opening keynote by describing 2014 as a turning point for Oracle. He explained that this year, Oracle built a lot of technology for the cloud and gained momentum in the cloud business. Several years ago Oracle realized that they will had no choice but to deliver services at all 3 layers of the cloud. The reason is because of a promise he made to Oracle's customers 30 years ago. A promise that compelled him to deliver Saas, Paas, and Iaas together, and better than the competitor. He explains that Oracle has more applications than anybody, and Oracle's upgrade to platform allows you to move any database to the cloud by pushing a button.\n\nBetween swigs from his glass bottle of Coca-Cola, he explained how three decades ago, Oracle customers were wanting to move from minicomputer and mainframe database to the next generation of architecture without re-writing everything. Oracle made a promise to make this easy. Customers expect Oracle to move databases to the next generation without changing a single line of code. Therefore, the big announcement for the day was the \"massively\" upgraded Oracle Database Platform as a Service. Database is Oracle's largest software business, and Larry confidently declares that database will be by far their largest cloud business. Customers have been waiting for the opportunity to take advantage of lower cost and higher reliability, but they want to move to the cloud gracefully and easily. Oracle allows them to move and modernize. However,Ellison maintained that Oracle is just getting started in the Cloud. Ellison closed the keynote by saying that \"there is nothing more important in the modern cloud than securing your data\" and delivered another 30 year promise, that discovering and stopping programs with malicious intent is top priority at Oracle.\n\n↧\n\nJCA FTP Adapter limited to 4MB in OSB\n\nProblem:\n\nIf you are using the FTPAdapter with OSB 11g (specifically 11.1.1.7), you may experience the following Java exception in the osb_server1.out log file:\n\n####<Oct 29, 2014 3:04:41 AM EDT> <Warning> <JCA_FRAMEWORK_AND_ADAPTER> <soahost1> <osb_server1> <[STUCK] ExecuteThread: '1' for queue: 'weblogic.kernel.Default (self-tuning)'> <<WLS Kernel>> <> <0000K^N1fyV8t1RMyYqYMG1JKBeB0000uE> <1413443141803> <BEA-000000> <onReject: The resource adapter 'FTP Adapter' requested handling of a malformed inbound message.

WebCenter like with many products Oracle sells it is really more than one product. The three primary products presented are as follows: WebCenter Portal, WebCenter Content, and WebCenter Sites. Each of these products has it's own set of features and functionality while still being under the WebCenter name.\n\nWebCenter Portal\n\nThis product is intended to provide your employees and customers with a central place to consume information and services distributed throughout your company's infrastructure. This helps relieve stress by only needing to worry about managing their tasks in a single place. Development is primarily is done with ADF and a number of reusable templates.\n\nWebCenter Content\n\nFormerly known as Universal Content Management, Oracle's WebCenter Content is a content management system as the title might imply. The extent of this product lies not simply in the managing digital documents. There are also features which allow for the tracking of related physical documents. It can act as a repository for your company's digital assets, create web friendly format for high resolution files and provide a central place for publishing digital assets. There is a supplementary product called WebCenter Imaging which allow for the capture of documents into WebCenter Content. It provides data capture from scanned documents and images, and markup on those documents.\n\nWebCenter Sites\n\nSites is focused on easy creation of websites for consumers, drag-and-drop functionality and integration of WebCenter Content allow help with publishing content that your company has accumulated; sites can also help with optimizing for mobile devices. With an additional license called WebCenter Sites Satellite Server which can be used to establish a content delivery network (CDN) for you company.\n\nSummary\n\nWith all of these products combined your company can build its web presence, internal web pages for your employees to complete their daily tasks and manage the many documents that are involved with business. While together the products have the potential to be very powerful, it is always good to take a look at them individually and determine the need for each.\n\n↧\n\n↧\n\nAnybody else confused by Oracle WebCenter?\n\nLet me be blunt. Oracle screwed up when it came up with the whole Oracle WebCenter idea. First, it was Oracle WebCenter Suite. Then it was Oracle WebCenter with 4 products interlocked in some senseless jigsaw puzzle, as if they were interconnected or something.\n\nDoes this jigsaw puzzle make sense? Not to me!\n\nIt was touted as a user engagement platform. I'm not sure if it still is. But now WebCenter is comprised of 3 products. It's such a confusing mess and the person who came up with the whole idea of combining these completely independent and unrelated products into a single suite should be fired.\n\nCurrently, the 3 primary products included in Oracle WebCenter are: WebCenter Portal, WebCenter Content, and WebCenter Sites. Each of these products has it's own set of features and functionality while still being under the WebCenter name. They are only related by name, though can be integrated together to provide more comprehensive functionality. (What people don't understand is that it can be integrated with so many other Oracle products as well.)\n\nOracle WebCenter Portal\n\nPortlets, which are pluggable windows that are embedded into portals, are useful for users who require an initial dashboard into their numerous intranet applications.\n\nPortals are mostly valuable in intranets, but also in extranets (think Yahoo! where you have access to all mail, financial, news, scores, weather all in a single page).\n\nWebCenter Portal is intended to provide a central place to consume information and services distributed throughout your company's infrastructure. This helps simplify user productivity by providing them with a means to managing their tasks in a single place. Development is primarily is done with ADF and a number of reusable templates.\n\nOracle WebCenter Portal is not to be confused with Oracle Portal (old and discontinued), BEA WebLogic Portal (acquired from BEA and discontinued), Oracle Sun Portal (acquired from Sun and discontinued), or Oracle WebCenter Suite (the old name).\n\nA screenshot of a portal created with Oracle WebCenter Portal\n\nSome of the key strengths of WebCenter Portal:\n\nQuickly create dynamic portals and websites - you can be up and running in 24 hours!\n\nEasily expose data from WebCenter Content, which is a repository that hosts structured and unstructured data.\n\nBest features from Oracle, BEA, and Sun portals combined.\n\nOracle WebCenter Content\n\nOracle WebCenter Content provides ECM (Enterprise Content Management) functionality, allowing the storage and retrieval of structured and unstructured data and records management, combined with powerful search and accessibility features.\n\nFormerly known as Oracle UCM (Universal Content Management) and originally acquired from Stellent, Oracle's WebCenter Content is a content management system. The extent of this product lies not simply in the managing of digital documents, but there are also features which allow for the tracking of related physical documents. It can act as a repository for your company's digital assets, create web friendly format for high resolution files and provide a central place for publishing digital assets. There is a supplementary product called WebCenter Imaging which allows for the capture of documents into WebCenter Content. It provides data capture from scanned documents and images, and markup on those documents.\n\nUsing Windows Explorer to access Oracle WebCenter Content documents\n\nSome of the key strengths of WebCenter Content:\n\nIncredibly powerful search capabilities.\n\nStores unstructured content of all types; documents, images, video, etc.\n\nMobile apps allow access through smartphones and tablets.\n\nDesktop integration with Microsoft Office, Microsoft Outlook, and Windows Explorer.\n\nOracle WebCenter Sites\n\nBusiness users can easily manage website content without the involvement of a developer, pulling data from any number of data sources.\n\nWebCenter Sites is another acquisition, formerly called FatWire. WebCenter Sites is focused on the easy creation of websites for consumers using drag-and-drop functionality. Integration with WebCenter Content provides the ability to easily publish content that your company has accumulated; and websites can be easily optimized for mobile devices. WebCenter Sites Satellite Server (an additional license) can be used to establish a content delivery network (CDN) for your company.\n\nEasily update website content with Oracle WebCenter Sites\n\nSome of the key strengths of WebCenter Sites:\n\nA web content management system designed for business users to easily add and update website content.\n\nMobile enable your website with no coding changes.\n\nProvides features such as comments, ratings, reviews, polls, blogs, etc.\n\nSegment-based and predictive targeting and analytics is provided.\n\nMy personal issues with the \"WebCenter\" name:\n\nThe 3 products are unrelated.\n\nI reject the argument that the 3 products are related; for example, WebCenter Portal can consume WebCenter Content content. So can E-Business Suite!\n\nThe change from Oracle WebCenter Suite to Oracle WebCenter and the removal of Oracle Social from the mix seems to indicate that Oracle themselves are confused.\n\n\"We are running WebCenter\" is what some customers say. Now tell me if that statement makes sense.\n\nI have no issues with any of the three WebCenter products. In fact, they are extremely powerful with WebCenter Content being the most mature of the group. My issue is purely with the naming.\n\nHopefully this post will help you understand why I disagree with the naming and marketing strategy offered by Oracle as it relates to WebCenter, and to give you an idea what each of the products has to offer.\n\n↧\n\nDownloading Oracle JDeveloper 12c for SOA development\n\nIf you're trying to download Oracle JDeveloper 12c for SOA development...\n\nDo not use this link:\n\nUse this link instead:\n\nReferences:\n\nhttps://fusionmwgang.wordpress.com/2014/07/07/installing-soa-suite-12c-12-1-3-0-0-on-windows-64-bit-machine/comment-page-1/#comment-14\n\n↧\n\nExporting Putty sessions\n\nIf you want to export your Putty sessions and settings in order to import it into another machine, simply type this command from the Command Prompt (single line):\n\nregedit /e \"%userprofile%\\desktop\\putty-registry.reg\" HKEY_CURRENT_USER\\Software\\Simontatham\n\nSimply transfer the exported file to the new machine and double-click on it to update the Windows Registry settings.\n\n↧"
