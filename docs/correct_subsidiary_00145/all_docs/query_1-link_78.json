With each additional participant in the process – many working in incompatible formats – the complexity of the process increases significantly as does the opportunity for costly inefficiencies and errors. TRADOS TeamWorks is designed to strengthen and optimize every link in the chain – tying together the work of content authors, project managers, project specialists, translators, quality assurance specialists and reviewers or editors. As a centralized collaboration platform, TRADOS TeamWorks also unifies the different formats, such as HTML and applications from Microsoft and Adobe.
