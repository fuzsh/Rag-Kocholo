Network Appliance products and solutions allow these providers to quickly and cost-effectively build the network storage infrastructure and content delivery networks required by the global telecommunications industry.\n\n Earnings being lower than anticipated in countries where we are taxed at lower rates as compared to the United States statutory tax rate  Material differences between forecasted and actual tax rates as a result of a shift in the mix of pre-tax profits and losses by tax jurisdiction, our ability to use tax credits, or effective tax rates by tax jurisdiction different than our estimates  Changing tax laws, accounting standards, including SFAS No. 123R, regulations, and interpretations in multiple tax jurisdictions in which we operate as well as the requirements of certain tax rulings  An increase in expenses not deductible for tax purposes, including certain stock compensation, write-offs of acquired in-process research and development and impairment of goodwill  The tax effects of purchase accounting for acquisitions and restructuring charges that may cause fluctuations between reporting periods  Changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities  Changes in tax laws or the interpretation of such tax laws  Tax assessments, or any related tax interest or penalties, could significantly affect our income tax expense for the period in which the settlements take place  A change in our decision to indefinitely reinvest foreign earnings\n\n Our overall gross margins were 60.8%, 61.0% and 60.2% in fiscal 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The slight decline in our overall gross margins for fiscal 2006 compared to fiscal 2005 was primarily due to a shift in revenue mix with an increase in disk sales and IBM OEM business partially offset by improved service gross margins. The improvement in our overall gross margins for fiscal 2005 compared to fiscal 2004 was primarily attributable to a favorable change in product and add-on software mix and improved services margins.  Cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments increased to $1,322.9 million, compared to $1,170.0 million as of April 30, 2005, due primarily to cash generated from operations partially offset by cash repurchases of our common stock of $488.9 million and net cash paid of $53.7 million in connection with the Alacritus and Decru acquisitions. Days Sales Outstanding in receivable were 63 days, and 60 days, respectively, as of April 30, 2006 and 2005, reflecting increased sales and less linear shipments. Inventory turns were 14.7 times and 17.9 times, respectively, as of April 30, 2006 and 2005 due to higher consigned inventory for IBM sales and new products at customer sites. Deferred revenue increased to $681.5 million in fiscal 2006 from $449.2 million reported in fiscal 2005 due to higher software subscription and service arrangements attributable to our continuing shift toward larger enterprise customers. Capital purchases of plant, property, and equipment for fiscal 2006, 2005 and 2004 were $132.9 million, $93.6 million and $48.7 million, respectively, reflecting continued worldwide capital investment to meet our business growth.\n\n Persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists. It is our customary practice to have a purchase order and/or contract prior to recognizing revenue on an arrangement from our end user customers, value-added resellers, or distributors.  Delivery has occurred. Our product is physically delivered to our customers, generally with standard transfer terms such as FOB origin. We typically do not allow for restocking rights with any of our value-added resellers or distributors. Products shipped with acceptance criteria or return rights are not recognized as revenue until all criteria are achieved. If undelivered products or services exist that are essential to the functionality of the delivered product in an arrangement, delivery is not considered to have occurred.  The fee is fixed or determinable. Arrangements with payment terms extending beyond our standard terms, conditions and practices are not considered to be fixed or determinable. Revenue from such arrangements is recognized as the fees become due and payable. We typically do not allow for price-protection rights with any of our value-added resellers or distributors.  Collection is probable. Probability of collection is assessed on a customer-by-customer basis. Customers are subject to a credit review process that evaluates the customers financial position and ultimately their ability to pay. If it is determined at the outset of an arrangement that collection is not probable based upon our review process, revenue is deferred and recognized when collection becomes probable.\n\n(1) We enter into operating leases in the normal course of business. We lease sales offices, research and development facilities, and other property under operating leases throughout the U.S. and internationally, which expire through fiscal 2015. Substantially all lease agreements have fixed payment terms based on the passage of time and contain escalation clauses. Some lease agreements provide us with the option to renew the lease or to terminate the lease. Our future operating lease obligations would change if we were to exercise these options or if we were to enter into additional operating lease agreements. Sublease income of $0.03 million has been included as a reduction of the payment amounts shown in the table. Facilities operating lease payments exclude the leases impacted by the restructurings. The amounts for the leases impacted by the restructurings are included in subparagraph (7) below. (2) On December 16, 2005, we entered into financing, construction and leasing arrangements with BNP for office space to be located on land currently owned by us in Sunnyvale, California. This arrangements requires us to lease our land to BNP for a period of 50 years to construct approximately 190,000 square feet of office space costing up to $38.5 million. After completion of construction, we will pay minimum lease payments which vary based on London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) plus a spread (5.58% at April 30, 2006) on the cost of the facilities. We expect to begin paying lease payments on the completed buildings on September 2007 for a term of five years. We have the option to renew the lease for two consecutive five-year periods upon approval by BNP.\n\nUpon expiration (or upon any earlier termination) of the lease term, we must elect one of the following options: we may (i) purchase the building from BNP for $38.5 million, (ii) if certain conditions are met, arrange for the sale of the building by BNP to a third party for an amount equal to at least $32.7 million, and be liable for any deficiency between the net proceeds received from the third party and $32.7 million, or (iii) pay BNP a supplemental payment of $32.7 million, in which event, we may recoup some or all of such payment by arranging for a sale of the building by BNP during the ensuing 2 year period. Included in the above contractual cash obligations are (a) lease commitments of $1.3 million in fiscal 2008, $2.1 million in each of the fiscal years 2009, 2010, 2011, 2012 and $0.9 million in fiscal 2013, which are based on the LIBOR rate at April 30, 2006 for a term of 5 years, and (b) at the expiration or termination of the lease, a supplemental payment obligation equal to our minimum guarantee of $32.7 million in the event that we elect not to purchase or arrange for a sale of the building. The lease also requires us to maintain specified financial covenants with which we were in compliance as of April 30, 2006. Such specified financial covenants include a maximum ratio of Total Debt to Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization (EBITDA) and a Minimum Unencumbered Cash and Short Term Investments.\n\n(3) Equipment operating leases include servers and IT equipment used in our Engineering labs and data centers. (4) Venture capital funding commitments include a quarterly committed management fee based on a percentage of our committed funding to be payable through June 2011. (5) Capital expenditures include worldwide contractual commitments to purchase equipment and to construct building and leasehold improvements, which will be recorded as Property and Equipment. (6) We are required to pay based on a minimum volume under certain communication contracts with major telecommunication companies as well as maintenance contracts with multiple vendors. Such obligations expire in April 2010. (7) These amounts are included on our Consolidated Balance Sheets under Other accrued liabilities and Long-term Obligations, which is comprised of committed lease payments and operating expenses net of committed sublease income. (8) Included in these amounts are $300.0 million loan on our Consolidated Balance Sheets under Current portion of long-term debt and Long-term Debt. This amount also includes estimated interest payments of $12.4 million and $4.1 million for fiscal 2007 and 2008, respectively. (9) The amounts outstanding under these letters of credit relate to workers compensation, a customs guarantee, a corporate credit card program, and a foreign rent guarantee.\n\n BNP is a leasing company for BNP Paribas in the U.S. BNP is not a special purpose entity organized for the sole purpose of facilitating the lease to us. The obligation to absorb expected losses and receive expected residual returns rests with the parent BNP Paribas. Therefore, we are not the primary beneficiary of BNP as we do not absorb the majority of BNPs expected losses or expected residual returns; and  BNP has represented in the Closing Agreement (filed as Exhibit 10.40) that the fair value of the property leased to us by BNP is less than half of the total of the fair values of all assets of BNP, excluding any assets of BNP held within a silo. Further, the property leased to Network Appliance is not held within a silo. The definition of held within a silo means that BNP has obtained funds equal to or in excess of 95% of the fair value of the leased asset to acquire or maintain its investment in such asset through non-recourse financing or other contractual arrangements, the effect of which is to leave such asset (or proceeds thereof) as the only significant asset of BNP at risk for the repayment of such funds.\n\n Delivery has Occurred. Our product is physically delivered to our customers, generally with standard transfer terms such as FOB origin. We typically do not allow for restocking rights with any of our value-added resellers or distributors. Products shipped with acceptance criteria or return rights are not recognized as revenue until all criteria are achieved. If undelivered products or services exist that are essential to the functionality of the delivered product in an arrangement, delivery is not considered to have occurred.  The Fee is Fixed or Determinable. Arrangements with payment terms extending beyond our standard terms, conditions and practices are not considered to be fixed or determinable. Revenue from such arrangements is recognized as the fees become due and payable. We typically do not allow for price-protection rights with any of our value-added resellers or distributors.  Collection is Probable. Probability of collection is assessed on a customer-by-customer basis. Customers are subjected to a credit review process that evaluates the customers financial position and ultimately their ability to pay. If it is determined at the outset of an arrangement that collection is not probable based upon our review process, revenue is recognized upon cash receipt.\n\n(1) We lease sales offices and research and development facilities throughout the U.S. and internationally. These offices are leased under operating leases which expire through fiscal 2015. We are responsible for certain maintenance costs, taxes, and insurance under these leases. Substantially all lease agreements have fixed payment terms based on the passage of time. Some lease agreements provide us with the option to renew or terminate the lease. Our future operating lease obligations would change if we were to exercise these options or if we were to enter into additional operating lease agreements. Sublease income of $30 has been included as a reduction of the payment amounts shown in the table. Rent operating lease payments in the table exclude lease payments which are accrued as part of our 2002 restructurings (see Note 13) and include only rent lease commitments that are over one year. Total rent expense for all facilities was $18,787, $18,595, and $15,405 for the years ended April 30, 2006, 2005, and 2004, respectively. Rent expense under our facility leases is recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease. The difference between the amounts paid and the amounts expensed is classified as accrued liabilities or long-term obligations in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets. (2) On December 16, 2005, we entered into financing, construction and leasing arrangements with BNP Paribas LLC (BNP) for office space to be located on land currently owned by us in Sunnyvale, California. This arrangements requires us to lease our land to BNP for a period of 50 years to construct approximately 190,000 square feet of office space costing up to $38,500.

We have the option to renew the lease for two consecutive five-year periods upon approval by BNP. Upon expiration (or upon any earlier termination) of the lease term, we must elect one of the following options: we may (i) purchase the building from BNP for $38,500, (ii) if certain conditions are met, arrange for the sale of the building by BNP to a third party for an amount equal to at least $32,725, and be liable for any deficiency\n\nbetween the net proceeds received from the third party and $32,725, or (iii) pay BNP a supplemental payment of $32,725, in which event, we may recoup some or all of such payment by arranging for a sale of the building by BNP during the ensuing 2 year period. Included in the above contractual cash obligations are (a) lease commitments of $1,252 in fiscal 2008, $2,147 in each of the fiscal years 2009, 2010, 2011, 2012 and $894 in fiscal 2013, which are based on the LIBOR rate at April 30, 2006 for a term of 5 years, and (b) at the expiration or termination of the lease, a supplemental payment obligation equal to our minimum guarantee of $32,725 in the event that we elect not to purchase or arrange for a sale of the building.
