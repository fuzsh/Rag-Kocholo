        "text": "about me\n\nIt's very difficult deciding what to say about myself. My CV would say that I am 'a well-respected senior consultant with extensive IT expertise in the fields of technical architecture, information security, service management, systems management and project management. Excellent interpersonal skills at all levels of seniority and computer or business literacy. Broad experience within public and private sectors. Able to operate effectively as a manager, team leader or team member'.\n\nThat's all true but I also have a keen interest in travelling and photography. But that's all in the past now as I have chosen to hangup my work shoes to concentrate on travel. I will be updating the site in coming months to include detail and photos of trips since I stopped woring in 2015.\n\nThe pictures on this site have been taken during my travels over the years and I felt that my old trustworthy boots, which gave up the ghost during a trek in Sikkim, deserved to be remembered hence the photo.\n\nUntil recently I was playing rugby but whilst the spirit was willing the flesh got to the point where it refused to do as requested and so I have hung my boots up (for the moment I could be persuaded if anyone were really desparate!!).\n\nphotography\n\nEveryone has dabbled in photography one way or another and like every kid I had a box Brownie but I became really interested in photography around 20 years ago when I started travelling in earnest. During my travels I have had the chance to photograph people and places from all over the world. Traveling through Africa, India, Nepal, New Zealand, the USA and the South Americas amongst others. I guess these travels have helped make me the image maker I am today.\n\nMy first forage into digital photography came during a trip around South America in 2003 when I bought a Canon Powershot, an A20 I think. After the trip I immersed myself in Digital photography with a vengance (it saved me a fortune!!). I still have a Lumix TZ7 for those times when you just need to 'point and shoot'.\n\ngallery\n\nUntil recently most of my phototographs have been taken using a Nikon D200 primarily with a Sigma 28-300mm f/3.5-6.3, for wide angle shots I used to use a Sigma 15-30 f2.8. I still use the Sigma 28-300mm lens with my F80 when using film but I'm doing this less and less so maybe now is the time to go completely digital and upgrade!.\n\nI got a really good bargain getting Nikon DX 18-55mm f/3.5-5.6 and Nikon DX 55mm-300mm f/4.5-5.6 for the Sigma 15-30 wide angle lens. Both lenses have anti-vibration which is really great although not sure its helped me that much.\n\nThe photographs in the gallery are just a sample and were taken about 10 years ago when I first got into digital photography. I haven't got around to scanning in my older photos so can't share those at this time. It may just be easier to revist everywhere I've been and use a digital next time!\n\nPlaces\n\n20\n\nPeople\n\n20\n\nAnimals\n\n20\n\nFlowers\n\n20\n\nCreepy Crawlies\n\n20\n\nmiscellaneous\n\n20\n\nTo see more pictures from my travels click here\n\nmy cv as was\n\ncareer overview\n\nMy career in ICT commenced with Food, Drug & Cosmetic Colours Limited, designing and implementing a computerised production and accounts system before founding Electron Systems Marketing (ESM) specialising in office automation and bespoke solutions.
