Codd wrote a research paper entitled \"A Relational Model of Data for Large Shared Data Banks.\" This paper introduced the idea of relational database management software (RDBMS) to the world. It would also become the bedrock of the company that would later be called Oracle, providing the framework for this company to rise to power as the second largest software company in the world. Inspired by the possibility of creating an RDBMS system that could be sold commercially, Bob Miner, Ed Oates, and Larry Ellison pooled their collective knowledge to create Software Development Laboratories in 1977, which became Oracle Systems Corporation in 1982. Fueled by successes within the governmental sector and the foresight to write much of the code in the then– revolutionary C programming language, Oracle was able to create database software that could easily connect with almost any available system. This launched their commercial popularity, and has given them the freedom to pursue innovative technologies, such as Siebel CRM, that have consistently kept them among the top five software companies in the world. <h2>What is Seibel?</h2> In 2005, Oracle acquired Seibel Contact Management Software from Siebel Systems, one of its largest competitors in the Customer Relationship Management (CRM) software service areas.

Over the years, Ellison has been given the nickname The Pirate because of the amount of acquisitions he has made. Even though people doubted Ellison could build such a large company by buying other companies, he has made Oracle the largest provider of corporate software in the world (Nelson &amp; Quick, 2013). The CEO of Oracle has a strong ability to exercise his power and influence in the form of hostile takeovers. A good example of this would be his actions towards the forced resignation of Hewlett–Packards CEO Mark Hurd. This happened after an investigation was launched involving allegations of sexual harassment. Larry Ellison quickly blamed the board of trustees at Hewlett–Packard for the forced resignation, then he instantly hired Hurd at Oracle (Nelson &amp; Quick, 2013). The new CEO of Hewlett–Packard became the next target for Ellison, he accused the CEO of overseeing intellectual property theft at his previous job. The CEO of Hewlett–Packard fought back against Ellison and stated that the allegations were complete hogwash and untrue (Nelson &amp; Quick, 2013). Ellison then went back and questioned Hewlett–Packards board of trustees and CEO all together about their competence, intelligence, and integrity.

SAPs clients trust them with extremely valuable information such as company security codes and much more. This makes them a prime target for hackers to try and infiltrate the companies system. The number of security vulnerabilities has risen dramatically over time (Nunez). Recommendation #1: SAP must spend time developing new methods and technology that will ensure the security of them and more importantly their faithful clientele. Recommendation #2: SAP should try to find less expensive data chips with the same or similar processing power.

Sap Han An Effortless Winner Over Oracle SAP HANA: An effortless winner over Oracle Anu Prashanthi Sridharan College of Computing and Informatics University of North Carolina at Charlotte Charlotte, NC asridha3@uncc.edu Abstract–SAP HANA (\"High Performance Analytic Appliance\") is doubtlessly a hands' down winner over Oracle. SAP created Hana for real–time analytics and applications. Oracle released Exadata Database Machine in 2010 to deliver the highest levels of database performance available. Though Oracle claimed that it wants to be the leading applications vendor in the world, it failed to openly accept SAP HANA as its competitor. While HANA is also an in–memory RDBMS like Exadata, it is more of a business platform. It allows customers to see their business in a new ... Show more content on Helpwriting.net ... That 's where our \"High Performance Analytic Appliance\"– SAP HANA comes into the picture. Though Oracle tried to address this problem by releasing Exadata, it did not target the issue with as much productivity and business–like approach as the HANA. Next issue is the query processing. The main goal of query processing is to execute a SQL query in a relatively smaller amount of time. It involves the steps of the query going through the scanning and parsing phase, query optimization, query interpretation and compilation and finally the execution. A thorough experimental comparison shows that SAP HANA illustrates advantages over the Oracle RDBMS, when given real–world data and practical queries. Next into limelight is the version control repository. Version Control generally deals with saving the revised versions of the files in a repository. It has many features like reverting files back to previous states, revisiting the entire project back to a previous state, review changes made over time, last modifications made and many more. In the case of SAP HANA, the version control repository is in the form of \"Take Over\" or \"Switch Ownership\". Once an information view is created, the user/owner needs to activate the view. And if any changes need to be made by another person, they take over the view, switch ownership, make the changes and again re–route it back to the original owner. An ...

Case Study Conducting A Risk Analysis M3A1: Case Study Conducting a Risk Analysis This will be a risk analysis of the hazard of moving to Oracle, or jumping ship to another software vendor, such as companies like Lawson Software Inc., Microsoft Corp., SAP AG or SSA Global Technologies Inc. (Jackson, 2005). The initial phase of the Risk Management life cycle is the analysis phase, where the first proposal is completed and is allowed to move forward with the risk assessment effort. Risk Analysis is an instrument for Risk Management and is used to identify weaknesses and various threats, and then predicts the conceivable losses and where to install defenses. Risk Analysis is applied to safeguard that security is cost–effective, pertinent, well–timed and responsive to security implications (Harris, 2016). As part of this phase, the all related documentation is brought together to define potential threats, risks, and repercussions (Harris, 2016). Also, an initial Return on Investment (ROI) argument should be made to aid management in constructing an informed decision (Excelsior College Website, 2016). Security can be extremely difficult and even for well–trained IT professionals can either apply too much or not enough or in wrong areas.

An important element to note is that Cisco's management had to make vital decisions before adopting and implementing the ERP systems. Various challenges motivated this that the company was facing a few years after the inception. Upon his arrival in 1993, Pete Solvik, the company's CIO at the time was objected to the idea of implementing ERP because he termed it as being \"mega.' Also, the CIO wanted the company to stick to its traditional standardization mechanism that required the use of universal database architecture.

In 2010, the Oracle Corporation finalized an acquisition of Sun Microsystems, Inc. for 7.3 billion dollars by way of a merger through a wholly owned subsidiary adjacent to Sun. At the commencement of this acquisition, Oracle corporation established an integration of certain hardware systems, of which 2 operating systems emerged: system products and system support. The Hardware System Product operating system emphasizes the physical use of storage products and computer server tactics where as the Hardware Systems support acted as a supplement to customers through ambiguous software updates to functionally essential software components. The establishment of these hardware systems, both Hardware Systems Product systems and Hardware Systems Support further placated one of Oracle's intentional goals that prompted the acquisition of Sun; the optimization of database software performance. The second intention was the want for an array of commodities, in Sun's possession, that posed value against other products in the industry.

What factors might have led analysts to question Oracle Systems' method of revenue recognition in mid–1990? Are these legitimate concerns? Analysts might have been led to question Oracle's method of revenue recognition because of revenue recognition timing, quality of receivables, and aggressive sales practice. These were all legitimate concerns. Oracle recognized licensing and sublicensing revenues on the date of contract rather than upon delivery when certain conditions were met. The company justified the practice stating its contractual obligation had been substantially performed at the time of signing the agreement. The concerns over this accounting method is legitimate because the company obviously ... Show more content on Helpwriting.net ... Therefore, the period between contract signing and delivery is equal to 40 days. So, we adjusted revenues to remove this 40 day early recognition. This resulted in a decreased, but more conservative, amount of revenue recognized per fiscal year. (See appendix) Question 3: What accounting or communication changes would you recommend to Oracle's Board of Directors? The following accounting and communication changes are recommended to the Oracle Board of Directors to accurately recognize revenue in accordance to actual business performance and common industry practice: Revenues for license fees should be recognized when the product is delivered. This practice is in accordance with common industry practice and provides a more accurate accounting of when revenue is earned by the company. The current policy for recognizing revenue when the contract is signed as an accurate time period indicator is clearly contradicted by the associated receivables being outstanding in excess of 160 days. As industry norms indicate an average of a 62 day collection period, this indicates that the contract date is not a reasonable basis for estimating the degree of collectability for the receivable and that more accurate estimate measures exist. The non–refundable portion of the license fee specified in the agreements should be recognized either upon delivery of the product or at the time\n\n100. ... Get more on HelpWriting.net ...\n\n104.

This is why people, especially businesses, always need to be prepared and have an efficient process structure within the company. When products are in offsite warehouses, there is no possible way of knowing what's onsite and what's not onsite. With that being said, with other departments using different numbers and product descriptions, the search becomes even more complicated. In addition, with customer service representatives and warehouse employees keying in numbers and information about products and customers, there is a high possibility that letters and numbers get transposed or even dropped off. In this event, the search becomes even longer and harder. The customer service representative's first priority is always the customer. Whatever the customer wants, ideally, the customer gets. However, when the customer service representative conducts the search with respect to locating the desired product and shipping the product at the desired shipping address within the desired delivery time sometimes becomes a burden.

He believes that only 9% of the potential market for his software has been tapped and that his newest technologies will keep his company on top of its competition when demand returns. ``If I were to take this company today and compare it to this company in 2000, there's no doubt in my mind I'd say this is a much better–positioned company,'' he says. Analysts think he's overly optimistic. True, the customer–management software market is expected to start growing again next year, by 10%, to $3.3 billion. But analysts say Siebel Systems will no longer dominate. As the market leader, it gets most of the blame for a groundswell of dissatisfaction with this kind of software, which can cost upwards of $10 million and take a year or more to install. A recent Merrill Lynch & Co. survey found that only 45% of customers are fully satisfied with their purchases of this software. At the same time, Siebel Systems faces tougher competition than ever before, and Tom Siebel is ``underestimating it,'' says analyst Joanie Rufo of AMR Research Inc. in Boston.
