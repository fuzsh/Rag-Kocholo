        "text": "Last updated 4 July 2024 with additional details to provide context to the development of these systems\n\nThis post provides a brief history of electronic document and records management systems, and standards that had an impact on the latter.\n\nIt notes the following:\n\nEarly electronic records management systems (ERMS) were mostly mainframe-based databases.\n\nElectronic document management systems (EDMS) were developed from the 1980s to manage unstructured electronic information.\n\nERM systems began to include unstructured information from the 1990s, especially with the introduction of DOD 5015.2 and MoReq.\n\nThe rise of XML from the late 1990s had an impact on methods to preserve electronic information.\n\nContent management (CM) and knowledge management (KM) systems appeared in the 1990s.\n\nCloud-based EDM systems, and enterprise content management (ECM) appeared from the early 2000s.\n\nCloud based systems challenged installed on-premise EDRM systems.\n\nThere is a history of acquisitions. (See Mergers & Acquisitions – This Week – MandAsoft to find more details of any acquisitions).\n\nSources for this information are listed where this is known.\n\nBackground\n\nEarly influencers\n\nA key factor in the later development and design of document and records management systems was the principle of provenance, commencing with the concept of ‘respect des fonds’ or respect for original order, developed in France from the early 1800s. The concept provided a rational basis for archival arrangement. The concept was further refined over the years through the following works:\n\nS. Muller, J.R. Feith, R. Fruin (Netherlands) – Manual for the arrangement and description of archives (1898)\n\nHilary Jenkinson (UK) – Manual of Archives Admin (1922)\n\nTheodore Schellenberg (US) – Modern Archives (1956)\n\n(Source: https://www.archives.gov/research/alic/reference/archives-resources/principles-of-arrangement.html)\n\nFrom the 1880s – The bureaucratic age and typewriters\n\nPrior to the introduction of typewriters in the workplace from the 1880s, most records were hand-written or copied (primarily by men) and filed.\n\nFor almost 100 years, records often continued to be handwritten by men and typed up by women.\n\nThis period also witnessed the introduction of telex machines.\n\nPost World War 2 – Computers emerge\n\nFollowing World War 2 (and likely based on the use of early computers to break codes), computers began to emerge in organisations.\n\nClaude Shannon, known as the inventor of the ‘bit’, published his Information Theory in 1956. Shannon also participated in the very first conference on Artificial Intelligence held at Dartmouth in the US in 1959.\n\nThe Australian Commonwealth Record Series\n\nPeter Scott, Ian McLean and others at the Australian Commonwealth Archive Office (CAO) published the Commonwealth Record Series (CRS) in 1966. The CRS included a diagram, showing the relationship between organisations, agencies, persons, series and items, that closely resembles an entity relationship or data visualisation model.\n\nAlthough the CRS provided a very useful way to understand the relationship between different entities connected with records, a 2022 review of the model by the National Archives of Australia stated that there had been ‘a tendency to impose an analogue view onto digital records, resulting in a rich source of data being effectively hidden’. (Source: (‘Re-imagining the Commonwealth Record Series’ National Archives of Australia 2022)\n\nThe analogue approach to digital records would have an impact on the development of both document and records management systems.\n\nThe first email\n\nRay Tomlinson (who died in 2016) and his team developed the first email system in 1971 and sent the first email. (Source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ray_Tomlinson)\n\nAs we will see, email would have a profound impact on the management of records from the 1980s.\n\nEarly Document Management systems\n\nDedicated document management systems began to emerge in the early 1970s.\n\n1973 – Plato Notes\n\nLotus Notes began its life in 1973 as Plato Notes, developed by the Computer-based Education Research Laboratory (CERL) at the University of Illinois in 1973. Elements of the Plato Notes system would be developed for PC by Ray Ozzie during the late 1970s. This was picked up by Lotus Development Corporation and in 1984 became Lotus Notes.\n\n1974 – Compulink Management Center/Laserfiche founded\n\nCompulink Management Center was founded in the US in 1974. It created Laserfiche, the first DOS-based document imaging system, in 1987.\n\n1976 – Micro Focus founded\n\nMicro Focus was founded in the UK in 1976. Its first software product was CIS COBOL, a solution for micro computers. It entered the EDRM market in 2017, see below.\n\n1978 – ISO Technical Committee 171\n\nIn 1978, the newly created ISO Technical Committee (TC) 171 was tasked with developing standards for Document Management applications. The work of the committee explicitly excluded anything to do with the management of records.\n\n1981 – Enterprise Informatics founded\n\nEnterprise Informatics, a privately-held software company, was founded in 1981 by early pioneers of the document management industry. (Source: LinkedIn company profile) It would later be acquired by Spescom, a South African company.\n\n1982 – FileNet founded\n\nFileNet was founded in 1982 by Ted Smith, formerly of Basic 4. FileNet’s original focus of attention was the storage and management of scanned images but it also developed a workflow software. (Source: Wikipedia article on FileNet)\n\nRecords Management Systems emerge\n\nIn addition to the existing market for Document Management system, several vendors created products known as records management systems (RMS) that were designed to replace paper registers to manage and track physical records.\n\nMany organisations now had three parallel systems to manage records:\n\nManaging physical files and boxes (but not individual items) using records management systems\n\nManaging digital content (but not records) using document management systems\n\nManaging telexes, the output of which might be placed on a physical file. Many telex machines were replaced by teletypes through this period.\n\nEmail also started to appear from the mid 1980s in some organisations, creating a fourth system.\n\n1983 – GMB/DocFind founded\n\nGMB (named after the original founders, Gillett, Frank McKenna, and Bachmann) was formed in Australia in 1983. In 1984, GMB released DocFind 1.0. DocFind was renamed RecFind in 1986.\n\nFor a very detailed history of this company, see The History of GMB/KnowledgeOne.\n\n1984 – Lotus Notes\n\nAn early version of Lotus Notes was released (under contract to Lotus) in 1984. The original vision included on-line discussion, email, phone books and document databases. Eventually the product fell into the ‘groupware’ category. The capability of the product continued to grow and some organisations only used Notes.\n\nLotus acquired all the rights to Lotus Notes in 1987 and version 1.0 was released on 7 December 1989.\n\n1984 – The first EDRMS standards – Noark (Norway)\n\nThe Norwegian government developed model requirements for EDRM systems in 1984, the first organisation globally to do so. Noark\n\n(Source: ‘The Norwegian Noark Model requirements for EDRMS in the context of open government and access to governmental information‘, by Olav Hagen Sataslaaten, National Archives of Norway, published in the Records Management Journal 11 November 2014.)\n\nNoark has remained active to the present day. (National Archives of Norway – E-Ark Project (eark-project.com)\n\n1985 – Tower Software founded (Australia)\n\nTower Software was founded by Brand Hoff in Canberra in 1985 as a software development company. The company provided and supported enterprise content management software, notably its TRIM (Tower Records and Information Management) product line for electronic records management.\n\nThe ‘Tower’ in the company name derives from the telecommunications tower on top of Black Mountain (technically a hill, 812 m high) overlooking Canberra. A graphic of the tower was used in the TRIM logo until the company was acquired by HP’s Software Division in 2008 (see also below).\n\n1986 – Autonomy founded (UK)\n\nAutonomy was founded by Michael Lynch, David Tabizel and Richard Gaunt in Cambridge, UK in 1986 ‘as a spin-off from Cambridge Neurodynamics, a firm specializing in computer-based finger print recognition’.\n\nBefore 1987 – Saros Corp\n\nSaros Corp was established in Washington by Mike Kennewick (a former Microsoft employee) before 1987. Saros Corp produced Saros Mezzanine, a client-server document management engine. In 1993, released Saros Document Manager.\n\n1989 – Ymijs (later Valid Information Systems) founded – R/KYV (UK)\n\nYmijs was founded in the UK in 1989. It sold the R/KYV software initially as a basic document imaging processing system. The company name was changed to Valid Information Systems and R/KYV was further developed as a compliance and records management system ‘… that is widely used by major corporations as well as central and local government authorities and related governmental agencies’ (in the UK).\n\nValid Information Systems was acquired by Hummingbird in 2003. (Source: ‘Legal Technology Insider‘, 23 July 2003.\n\n1989 – Provenance Systems (later TrueArc) founded (Canada)\n\nBruce Miller, sometimes noted as ‘the inventor of modern electronic recordkeeping software’, founded Provenance Systems in 1989 where he created ForeMost. The company name was changed to TrueArc. Bruce would go on to found Tarian Software as well in 1999.\n\nTrueArc ForeMost RM would be acquired in 2002 by Documentum (which which it had a long-standing technology partnership).\n\nTwo primary systems – RMS and DMS (and other storage locations)\n\nBy the beginning of the 1990s, organisations were starting to replace typewriters with networked (or standalone) computers, linked to printers. End users started to create more and more content via a computer and did not always print it. Content remained stored on local disk drives or on newly emerging network file shares.\n\nPhysical files were still being managed in an RM system and some organisations used dedicated DM systems to provide more control over important digital content. Teletypes were about to give way to fax machines.\n\n1990 – Documentum founded (US)\n\nAccording to this Wikipedia article, Documentum was founded in June 1990 by Howard Shao and John Newton who had previously worked at Ingres (a relational database vendor). They sought to solve the problem of unstructured information.\n\nThe first Documentum EDMS was released in 1993. According to the Wikipedia article, ‘This product managed access to unstructured information stored within a shared repository, running on a central server. End users connected to the repository through PC, Macintosh, and Unix Motif desktop client applications.’\n\n1992 – Altris Software (UK)\n\nAltris, established in 1992 (Source: Rob Liddell\\’s LinkedIn profile. Rob was one of the co-founders of Altris), developed document management systems, including (according to this South African ITWeb post of 26 October 2001), eB, a ‘configuration management’ application.\n\nAltris would be acquired by the South African Spescom in 2000.\n\n1992 – Optika ImageFiler / FilePower\n\nOptika Imaging Systems (Colorado, US) sought a trademark for a product called ImageFiler in September 1992. The request was abandoned according to information on the Bizapedia site.\n\nThis article titled ‘The Case for 11g‘ (referring to Oracle’s product, see below) noted that Optika’s original software development focus was Image and Process Management (IPM).\n\nAn undated (but likely mid to late 1990s) webpage on the Property and Casuality website titled ‘Optika and Xerox Package FilePower with Document Centre‘ noted that ‘Optika Imaging Systems, Inc. and Xerox announced that the two companies will jointly work to integrate Optika’s FilePower with Document Centre digital systems products from Xerox. The combination of the Document Centre and FilePower will provide a complete solution for capturing, managing and distributing large volumes of documents, increasing users’ productivity and significantly reducing labor and capital costs. Optika’s integrated product suite — FilePower — combines imaging, workflow and COLD technology into a unified software package. The Xerox Document Centre 220ST and 230ST combine network scanning, printing, faxing and copying into one hardware device.’\n\nERM before the mid 1990s\n\nBefore the arrival of personal computers in offices in the early 1990s, computer mainframes and databases were the regarded by some observers as the only places where electronic ‘records’ (in the form of data in tables) were stored and managed.\n\nA report by the United States General Account Office in July 1999 (GAO/GGD-99-94) titled ‘Preserving Electronic Records in an Era of Rapidly Changing Technology’) stated that, historically (as far back as 1972), NARA’s Electronic Records Management (ERM) guidance (GRS 20) was geared towards mainframes and databases, not personal computers.\n\nThe GAO report noted that until at least the late 1990s, there was a general expectation that all other electronic records not created or captured in ERM systems would be printed and placed on a paper file or another system. The original (electronic) records could then be destroyed.\n\nSome early ERM (database) systems, such as TRIM from Tower Software in Australia, were originally developed in the mid 1980s to manage paper files and boxes. Similar systems were developed to manage library catalogues and the old card catalogues started to disappear.\n\nBut, although some of it was printed and filed, the volume of electronic records in email systems and stored across network file shares continued to grow. Several vendors released systems that could be used to manage electronic documents (EDM) more effectively than network drives but there was no agreed standard for managing that content as records.\n\nThe need for standards\n\nIn the very early 1990s, the information management team at BHP Australia identified that there were no dedicated standards for records management and set out to draft a new standard.\n\nA new Australian Standards Information Technology was formed (IT 21) to develop the standard, which was eventually published as AS 4390 in 1996.\n\nAs the Australian standard was being developed, two separate research teams were developing what James Lappin in the UK has described as ‘rival models’ for the management of digital records. These models were published in 1996 – see below.\n\n1993 – Workflow Management Coalition formed\n\nThe Workflow Management Coalition (WfMC), ‘a consortium formed to define standards for the interoperability of workflow management systems’, was founded in May 1993. Original members included IBM, Hewlett-Packard, Fujitsu, ICL, Staffware and approximately 300 software and services firms in the business software sector.\n\nThe WfMC’s Workflow Reference Model was published first in 1995 and still forms the basis of most BPM and workflow software systems in use today. (Source: Undated Gutenberg article)\n\n1993 – Kainos Meridio (UK)\n\nMeridio was developed in 1993 by Kainos (a Northern Ireland company and joint venture between Fujitsu and The Queens University in Belfast) as an electronic document and records management (EDRM) system based on Microsoft products. It would be acquired by HP Autonomy in 2007.\n\n1993 – Saros (US) Document Manager\n\nSaros Corp released Saros Document Manager in mid 1993. The product was said ‘to act as a front-end to the Bellevue, Washington-based firm’s client-server document management engine, Saros Mezzanine’. (Source: Computer Business Review article ‘Saros Sets Document Manager‘ )\n\n1994 – The DLM Forum and MoReq\n\nFrom the early 1990s, the European Council sought to promote greater cooperation between European governments on the management of archives. One of the outcomes of a meeting in 1996 was the creation of the DLM Forum. DLM is the acronym of the French term ‘Données Lisibles par Machine’, or ‘machine-readable data’.\n\nOne of the ten action points arising from the June 1994 DLM meeting was the creation of ‘Model Requirements for the Management of Electronic Records’, or MoReq, first published in 2001 (see below).\n\nMid 1990s – Two rival records management models\n\nAs noted earlier, according to James Lappin, in his paper ‘Rival records management models in an era of partial automation‘ published on 22 January 2021, two rival records management models appeared in the mid 1990s.\n\nUniversity of British Columbia, Canada – separate records repository model\n\nAccording to its website, ‘the InterPARES Project was borne out of previous research carried out at the University of British Columbia’s School of Library, Archival and Information Studies. “The Preservation of the Integrity of Electronic Records” (a.k.a. “The UBC Project”) defined the requirements for creating, handling and preserving reliable and authentic electronic records in active recordkeeping systems.’\n\n‘The UBC Project researchers, Dr. Luciana Duranti and Professor Terry Eastwood, worked in close collaboration with the U.S. Department of Defense Records Management Task Force to identify requirements for Records Management Applications (RMA).\n\nThe work of the UBC team influenced the development of DOD 5015.2 published in 1997 (see below) and the subsequent development of a range of electronic document and records management (EDRM) systems.\n\nUniversity of Pittsburgh, United States – intervention in business applications model\n\nIn 1996, the University of Pittsburgh published the ‘Functional Requirements for Evidence in Recordkeeping Project’, led by David Bearman. This work would influence the development of both MoReq2010 and the ICA standards that became ISO 16175-2010, both of which attempted to define a minimum set of functional requirements for a business application to be able to manage its own records. (Lappin)\n\nEmail becomes a dominant player\n\nBy the time these standards were published and were being used to inform the development of new ERM systems, the volume of email being sent and received by organisations was already making it difficult to incorporate them easily with other related records. In most cases, organisations tried (often in vain) to encourage users to save a copy of emails to the recordkeeping systems.\n\n1995 – IBM Acquires Notes\n\nLotus Notes was acquired by IBM in July 1995. By December 1996 it had 20 million users. By the end of 1999, Lotus Notes had extensive capability including ERM and EDM.\n\nLotus Notes continued to retain a strong presence in the market but its dominance began to be reduced by the arrival of Microsoft’s broader capabilities and other EDM solutions.\n\n1995 – Alpharel (US) acquires Trimco (UK)\n\nAccording to this Computer Business Review article of 23 November 1995, Alpharel Inc, San Diego was expected to acquire Trimco Group Plc of Ealing, London, a supplier of enterprise-wide document management systems.\n\n1995 – FileNet acquires Saros\n\nFileNet acquired Saros Corporation in 1995 to acquire its electronic document management capability. It was said to have pioneered ‘integrated document management’ (IDM), through a suite that offered document imaging, electronic document management, COLD and workflow. (Source: Wikipedia article on FileNet)\n\n1996 – Australian Standard AS 4390\n\nIn February 1996 Australia issued the world’s first national records management standard, AS4390 ‘Records Management – General‘. The standard provided guidance for the implementation of records management strategies, procedures and practices.\n\nTower Software, the Canberra-based developers of TRIM, contributed to the development of the standard (according to its Wikipedia entry) although the standard did not prescribe requirements for the management of electronic records.\n\nAS 4390 would become internationalised through ISO 15489 in 2002.\n\n1996 – XML appears\n\nA new markup language, derived from SGML (created in 1969 and defined by the ISO in 1986) and known as eXtensible Markup Language or XML was released in 1996. XML would have a profound impact on the management of records in the future.\n\n1996 – OpenText Corporation (US) – Livelink\n\nOpenText Corporation was founded in 1991 from OpenText Systems. It released Livelink in 1996.\n\n1996 – EDM solutions (UK listing)\n\nThe following is a list of EDM systems taken from the Document Management Resource Guide, 1995/96 Edition, kindly provided by Reynold Lemming in 2021. (^ = Original software author entry, all others are system resellers)\n\n1996 – Various EDM solutions\n\nThe March 1996 edition of Engineering Data Management included a number of updates on electronic document management solutions in the market at that time. Note that Trimco and Alpharel are listed separately; this may because Alpharel’s acquisition of Trimco had not been completed by that time.\n\nAlpharel (San Diego, CA): Document Management solutions – Enabler, FlexFolder, RIPS, Toolkit API. Wisdom, a product that facilitated internet access to participating electronic document vaults.\n\nAuto-trol Technology (Denver, CO): CENTRA 2000, document management, workflow, PDM, change management and messaging.\n\nCimage Enterprise Systems (Bracknell, UK): Document Manager for Windows.\n\nDocumentum, Inc. (Pleasanton, CA): Documentum Accelera for the World Wide Web and Documentum UnaLink for Lotus Notes.\n\nInterleaf (Waltham, MA): Interleaft 6 SGML, a solution for publishing SGML doocuments. Intellecte/BusinessWeb, a document management solution that allowed organisations to access enterprise document repositories from the internet.\n\nTrimco (Ealing, UK): Document management systems.\n\nAlpharel changed its name to Altris Software (US) in October 1996, according to this Telecompaper article published the same month.\n\nFrom 1996 – Germany’s DOMEA project\n\nIn 1996, the Coordinating and Advising Agency of the Federal Government for Information Technology in the Federal Administration (KBSt) introduced a pilot project named Document Management and Electronic Archiving in computer-assisted business processes (DOMEA).\n\nUnder the framework of DOMEA, a project group was set up in 1998 to find solutions for the disposition and archiving of electronic records. The goal was to find a suitable and efficient way for the disposition of electronic records created and maintained in office systems. Its “Concept for the Disposition and Archiving of Electronic Records in Federal Agencies,” containing recommendations for managing electronic records was published in September 1998. (Source: The Free Library article)\n\nLate 1990s – EDMS vs ERMS\n\nElectronic document management systems (EDMS) and electronic records management systems (ERMS) were regarded as separate types of system from the late 1990s until at least 2008.\n\nAccording to Philip Bantin in August 2002:\n\nAn EDMS was said to support day-to-day use of documents for ongoing business. Among other things, this meant that the records stored in the system could continue to be modified and exist in several versions. Records could also be deleted.\n\nAn ERMS was designed to provide a secure repository for authentic and reliable business records. Although it contained the same or similar document management functionality as an EDMS, a key difference was that records stored in an ERMS could not be modified or deleted. (The concept of ‘declaring a record’ may be related to this point).\n\n(Source: Presentation by Philip Bantin, University Archivist at the University of Indiana, dated 18 April 2001)\n\nThe difference between the two types of system endured for at least a decade. By the end of the 1990s, four main EDRMS options had emerged:\n\nExtending an existing EDM product capability to include ERM.\n\nExtending an existing ERM capability to include EDM.\n\nCreating new ERM products (technically also with some EDM capability).\n\nIntegrating separate EDM and ERM products.\n\n1997 – DOD 5015.2\n\nAccording to the 1999 GAO report quoted above, for several years prior to 1997, NARA worked with the US Department of Defense, considered ‘one of the agencies that is most advanced in its ERM efforts’.\n\nThe outcome of this work was the release in November 1997 of the DOD standard titled ‘Design Criteria Standard for Electronic Records Management Software Applications’ usually known by its authority number – DOD Directive 5015.2, Department of Defense Records Management Program, 11 April 1997.\n\nThe GAO report stated that ‘ERM information systems that were in place before the approval of this standard must comply with the standard by November 1999’.\n\nIt added that US agencies ‘were confronted with many ERM challenges’ from the ever-increasing volume of digital records, including the ability to preserve and access those records over time. The ‘Year 2000 problem’ was drawing attention away from the issue.\n\nNevertheless, by 2 June 1999, nine companies were certified as compliant with the DOD standard. Some, it noted, were standalone ERM software, while others were an integrated solution.\n\nAn interesting small note on page 11 of the GAO report noted that ‘it is important that ERMS software requires users to make no more than two or three extra keystrokes, and that users realize there is a benefit to this additional ‘burden’.\n\nFrom 1997 – SER eGovernment (Germany)\n\nSER eGovernment was developed for the German/Austrian market following the release of the German eGovernment standard, DOMEA in 1997.\n\n1998 – Documentum goes online\n\nIn 1998, Documentum released its Web Application Environment, a set of internet extensions for EDMS, offering web access to documents stored within an EDMS repository. Various additional products were acquired and their functionality added to the Documentum system.\n\n1998 – Optika eMedia released\n\nOptika released eMedia, ‘a software and methodology product designed to manage business transactions within an organization, across extranets, and throughout the supply chain’, in late 1998. (Source ‘Optika Delivers App to Manage Business Transactions‘) Optika eMedia was said to be ‘a workflow enabled replacement for an imaging solution named FilePower’.\n\n1998 – FileNet Panagon suite released\n\nIn 1998, FileNet released its Panagon suite of products. This included Panagon Content Services that was previous Saros Mezzanine. (Source: Wikipedia article on FileNet)\n\n1999 – International differences\n\nThe 1999 GAO report noted differences between the US, UK, Australia and Canada on their approach to ‘common ERM challenges’.\n\nAustralia was said to have ‘strong central authority (including for compliance audits) and decentralised custody’ (except when the records are transferred to permanent retention).\n\nCanada had ‘vision statements rather than specific policies’ and also had decentralised custody, but agencies could transfer records at any time to the archives.\n\nThe UK had broad guidelines put into practice by individual agencies.\n\n1999 – the UK PRO standard released\n\nThe UK Public Records Office (PRO, later The National Archives, TNA) released a standard in 1999 designed ‘to provide a tool for benchmarking the ability of government departments to support electronic records management’. This standard would be replaced by TNA 2003. (Source: ‘ERM System Requirements’, published in INFuture, 4-6 November 2009, by, Marko Lukicic, Ericsson)\n\nEnd of the 1900s – XML\n\nBy the end of the 20th century it was becoming clear (to some) that XML (released in 1996) would likely play a strong role in the standardisation of electronic record formats and their management over time.\n\nXML-based record structures meant that electronic records could contain their own ‘metadata payloads’ rather than being independent objects defined in a separate system (like a library catalogue describes books on shelves).\n\nThe establishment of XML-based formats would (after about 20 years) begin to change the way in which records would be managed, although paper records and the paradigm of managing records in pre-defined containers would continue to persist, largely because of the standards developed to manage electronic records – in particular DOD 5015.2.\n\n1999 – EDM/early ERM products\n\nThe following is a collated list of EDM (and related) products collated in November 1999:\n\nAutonomy Portal in a Box\n\nCompuTechnics (1990 to 1999)/Objective (from 1999)\n\nDOCS\n\nEastman Software (Imaging, OCR)\n\nEDM Software (UK) and SER (Germany)\n\nExcalibur RetrievalWare\n\nFileNet, incorporating Panagon Integrated Document Management\n\nFulcrum (acquired by PC DOCS in 1997)\n\nGMB (later KnowledgeOne) RecFind/RecQuery\n\nHummingbird (from 1999 with acquisition of PC DOCS)\n\nInsight Technologies Knowledge Server (IKS) / Document Management System (DMS)\n\nIntraspect Knowledge Server (IKS) (KM)\n\nLotus Notes\n\nOnyx Enterprise Portal, with integration to various EDM applications\n\nOpen Text Livelink\n\nPitney Bowes Digital Document Delivery (D3)\n\nOracle\n\nOsyssey (ISYS)\n\nPC DOCS (acquired by Hummingbird in early 1999)\n\nReadSoft (OCR processing)\n\nRecordManager\n\nTower Software / TRIM Captura\n\nTower Technology\n\nVerity (KM)\n\n1999 – Tarian Software founded\n\nTarian Software was founded in Canada in 1999 by Bruce Miller, the founder of Provenance Systems (later TrueArc) and creator of ForeMost. Tarian developed the Tarian eRecordsEngine, an embedded electronic recordkeeping technology for business application software. Tarian was the first e-Records technology in the world to be certified against the revised 5015.2 June 2002 standard. Tarian was acquired by IBM in 2002.\n\n1999 – The Victorian Electronic Records Strategy (VERS)\n\nThe (Australian) Victorian government’s Public Records Office (PROV) published a standard for the management of electronic records in 1999, Standard 99/007 ‘Standard for the Management of Electronic Records’. The standard, usually known as VERS, defined the (XML-based) format required for the transfer of permanent records to the PROV.\n\nThe Standard noted that:\n\nRecords must be self-documenting. It is possible to interpret and understand the\n\ncontent of the record without needing to refer to documentation about the system in\n\nwhich it was produced\n\nRecords must be self-contained. All the information about the record is contained\n\nwithin the record itself\n\nThe record structure must be extensible. It must be possible to extend the structure of\n\nthe record to add new metadata or new record types without affecting the\n\ninteroperability of the basic structure.\n\nSeveral EDRMS vendors developed the capability to create VERS encapsulated objects (VEOs) as required by the standard.\n\n2000 – Email continues its dominance and Blackberries appear\n\nBy 2000, it was estimated that there were around 400 million email accounts worldwide.\n\nThe phone manufacturer Research in Motion released a new type of phone called a Blackberry that would allow people to send and receive emails from their mobile devices. There was no way that all these emails could or would be managed as records.\n\n2000 – Spescom (South Africa) acquires Altris (UK)\n\nThe South African company Spescom acquired the UK firm Altris Software in 2000, as noted in this (South Africa) ITWeb article of 3 May 2000. Altris was described in the article as ‘a global leader in integrated electronic document management software, with well established channels to international markets’. As a result of this acquisition, Altris UK was renamed Spescom Ltd (UK).\n\nThe same journal announced in 2001 that Spescom KMS was ‘the UK operation of Spescom Limited’s US based subsidiary, Altris Software Inc, which specialises in the provision of asset information management software to markets including transportation, utilities and telcos’.\n\nFrom 2000 – Microsoft adopts XML for Office documents\n\nIn 2000, Microsoft released an initial version of an XML-based format for Microsoft Excel, which was incorporated into Office XP.\n\nIn 2002, a new file format for Microsoft Word followed. The Excel and Word formats, known as the Microsoft Office XML formats (with an ‘x’ on the end of the document extension), were later incorporated into the 2003 release of Microsoft Office.\n\nMicrosoft’s XML formats, known as Open Office XML, later became ECMA 376 in 2006 and later ISO 29500 in 2008 ‘amid some controversy’ over the need for another XML format (see below).\n\nBefore 2001 – Intranet Solutions (later Stellent)\n\nIntranet Solutions had developed software called’IntraDoc!’. The product was briefly renamed Xpedio! before the company and product were renamed Stellent in 2001. (Source: ‘Wikipedia article on Oracle Acquisitions‘)\n\n2001 – EDM systems with RM functionality\n\nThe following is a list of ‘EDM systems with records management’ functionality available by early 2001:\n\nTRIM (Tower Software, Australia) – integrated ERM and EDM.\n\nForeMost Enterprise v2 (TrueArc Inc) – ERMS\n\nTarian eRecords Engine v1.0 (formerly e-Records v1.0)(Tarian) – ERMS\n\niRIMS 2001 (Open Text Corp) – ERMS\n\nObjective 2000 (Objective Corp, Australia) – ERMS\n\nHummingbird RM Family 4.0 (Hummingbird, Canada) – ERMS (later acquired by Open Text)\n\nFileSurf 7.0 (MDY Advanced Technologies) – ERMS\n\nR2M (Relativity Records Manager v2 (Relativity Inc) – EDMS with added records management functionality.\n\neManage 2000 (ByteQuest Technologies) – knowledge management (KM) integrated with records management.\n\nFileNET IDM Content Services 5.1.1/ForeMost Enterprise 2.0 – EDMS with integrated records management.\n\nIBM e-Records Solution (IeRS) v1.0 – IBM’s content management (CM) solution integrated with Tarian eRecords v1.0.\n\nWork Manager/ForeMost (Eastman Software) – combined the DM, imaging and workflow of Work manager with the RM capabilities of ForeMost.\n\n(Source: Presentation by Philip Bantin, University Archivist at the University of Indiana, dated 18 April 2001).\n\nMany of the products above were sold internationally on the basis of their compliance with DOD 5015.2 even though that was a US-specific standard.\n\n2001 – Birth of SharePoint\n\nMicrosoft released SharePoint in 2001. It was born out of a combination of Office Server and Project Tahoe.\n\nOffice Server provided the simplest of network administration actions\n\nTahoe expanded on the email, calendaring, contacts, and to-do list technology contained within Exchange.\n\nIt was not until the release of Office 2003 that SharePoint (rebranded as Windows SharePoint Services) provided collaboration and other functionality.\n\n(Source: History of SharePoint from PortalFront hosting)\n\nVarious developments in the early 2000s\n\nEDM vs ERM systems\n\nInformation Technology Decisions published a paper on DOD 5015.2 certified products in November 2001 (original source/location has been lost). It noted that there were two types of products:\n\nProducts that started life as electronic document management (EDM) systems. Examples included Documentum, Livelink, and DOCS Open.\n\nProducts that started life as electronic recordkeeping (ERK/ERM) systems. Examples given included Tower Software’s TRIM, Foremost, iRIMS, Cuadra Star.\n\nThe presentation noted that DOD 5015.2 certification was based on alternative options:\n\nStandalone. For example, True Arc Foremost, TRIM, iRIMS, Cuadra Associates Star, Relativity Records Manager, Hummingbird RM 4.0, Tarian eRecords, MDY/FileSurf, Cimage and Access Systems, Highland Technologies Highview-RM, Open Text, Livelink\n\nPartnership. For example, Saperion with e-Manage 2000, Impact Systems eRecords Manager, FileNet with Foremost.\n\nThe report included three interesting points:\n\nBoth EDMS and ERKS required an enterprise view of information.\n\nAn EDMS is driven by business process requirements.\n\nAn ERKS (ERMS) is driven by enterprise requirements for the long-term preservation of information.\n\nEnterprise Content Management\n\nIn addition to the EDMS/ERMS differences, organisations were also seeking solutions for knowledge management (KM) and content management (CM).\n\nThe term ‘Enterprise Content Management’ (ECM) began to appear more frequently by 2002. The Wikipedia post on ECM noted that ECM technologies descended from ‘electronic Document Management Systems (DMS) of the late 1980s and early 1990s’.\n\nEarly ECM solutions were usually portal-based options that mostly became some form of intranet.\n\nECM promised:\n\nThe integration of records management (RM) with business practices.\n\nThe capability for integration between RM products, EDM, various other digital products (such as OCR/character recognition technologies), and web publishing products.\n\nIncorporation of Knowledge Management (KM) concepts.\n\nThe key word here was ‘integration’ with EDM and other systems, rather than standalone systems. Web-based access became increasingly essential. IBM’s acquisition of Tarian, Documentum’s acquisition of TrueArc’s Foremost were examples of these integrations. (see below)\n\nSome of the options in the early 2000s included:\n\nHummingbird’s PowerDOCS for DM and CyberDOCS as the web client for the DM solution, along with Hummingbird’s (formerly Fulcrum) Knowledge Server for KM and PD Accord for web-based collaboration, with the Hummingbird Enterprise Information Portal (EIP) as the portal solution. Plumtree Corporate Portal could also be used as an Enterprise Portal.\n\niManage’s DeskSite for DM and WorkTeam for collaboration. For KM, WorkKnowledge Server and Concept Search (based on the Autonomy Server). The portal to link all of these was called WorkPortal.\n\nOpen Text’s Livelink for DM, KM and collaboration.\n\nElite’s Encompass, built on Microsoft’s new SharePoint Portal Server (SPS).\n\nAutonomy Server for KM, with Plumtree Corporate Portal as the portal.\n\nDocumentum’s DM and CM product coupled with Plumtree Corporate Portal.\n\nAccording to the Wikipedia article on ECM: ‘Before 2003, the ECM market was dominated by medium-sized independent vendors which fell into two categories: those who originated as document management companies (Laserfiche, Saros, Documentum, docStar, and OpenText) and began adding the management of other business content, and those who started as web content management providers (Interwoven, Vignette, and Stellent) tried to branch out into managing business documents and rich media’.\n\nThe emergence of ECM quite possibly created the first challenge to centralised ERM through the integration of multiple elements, some of which created, captured or stored records in ever increasing formats.\n\nDigital Asset Management (DAM) systems, used to manage other types of digital content such as photographs, also appeared around this time.\n\nAn early Artificial Intelligence tool\n\nDon Lueders noted in his post An Industry Pioneer on Records Management and Artificial Intelligence (nextgenrm.com) that ‘in the early 2000’s TruArc released a product called AutoRecords. AutoRecords was the very first records management solution brought to market that leveraged artificial intelligence to automatically classify electronic records.’\n\nWeb 2.0 technologies begin to appear\n\nEarly web technologies from the mid 1990s provided static, read-only access to content. By the early 2000s, new technologies allowed for read-write and interactive access. The latter became known as Web 2.0. It not until the mid 2000s with the introduction of new smart phones (and the beginning of the death of Blackberries) that Web 2.0 technologies began to make an impact.\n\n2001 – The first MoReq\n\nThe first version of MoReq was published in 2001. Volume 1 was 500 pages long.\n\nMoReq emphasised the central importance of an electronic records management system, or ERMS. Its stated purpose was:\n\nTo provide guidance to organisations wishing to acquire ERMS.\n\nAs a tool to audit or check an existing ERMS.\n\nAs a reference document for use in training or teaching.\n\nTo guide product development by ERMS suppliers and developers.\n\nTo help define the nature of outsourced records management solutions.\n\nFew companies or products were ever certified against this version of MoReq.\n\n2002 – Optika Acorde\n\nOptika eMedia was rebranded to Optika Acorde in 2002, according to this website ‘The Case for 11g‘.\n\nA June 2002 Gartner report titled ‘Optika Acorde Document Imaging, Workflow and Collaboration Suite‘ noted that Optika Acorde was an ‘integrated software family for managing the content associated with business transactions’ leveraging ‘Optika’s core strengths in document imaging, workflow and enterprise report management.’\n\n2002 – FileNet BrightSpire, later P8 ECM\n\nFileNet released BrightSpire in 2002. This product ‘leveraged the experience gained from integrated document management, web content management and workflow into what became ECM. (Source: Wikipedia article on FileNet)\n\n2002 – OpenDocument XML format\n\nAccording to the Wikipedia article on the OpenDocument standard, the OpenDocument standard was developed by a Technical Committee (TC) under the Organization for the Advancement of Structured Information Standards (OASIS) industry consortium. Sun and IBM apparently had a large voting influence but the standardization process involved the developers of many office suites or related document systems. The first ODF-TC meeting was held in December 2002.\n\n2002 – An updated GAO report into electronic records\n\nThe US General Accounting Office (GAO) released a new report in June 2002 titled ‘Information Management: Challenges in Managing and Preserving Electronic Records’ (GAO-02-586). This report, which was more detailed than the earlier 1999 one, noted among other things that:\n\nThe DOD had by March 2002 certified 31 applications against standard 5015.2.\n\nProgress had been made on the development of the Open Archival Information System (OAIS) model which, while initially developed by NASA for archiving the large volume of data produced by space missions, could be applied to ‘any archive, digital library or repository’. XML-based solutions were considered the most likely to be accepted.\n\n2002 – IBM acquires Tarian Software\n\nIBM acquired Tarian Software in late 2002, ‘bolstering its leadership in ECM’.\n\nFrom that date, IBM released the IBM Records Manager Version 2.0 (IRM), previously known as the Tarian eRecords Engine (TeRe). Tarian’s e-Records management technology was integrated into IBM’s software offerings, including IBM Content Manager, DB2 database and Lotus software. (Source: IBM press release)\n\n2002 – Documentum 5 and TrueArc Foremost acquisition\n\nDocumentum released Documentum 4i, its first Web-native platform, in 2000. In 2002, it launched Documentum 5 as ‘a unified enterprise content management (ECM) platform for storing a virtually unlimited range of content types within a shared repository’.\n\nDocumentum acquired TruArc’s Foremost product in October 2002. The Documentum Wikipage above noted that this acquisition ‘added records management capabilities and augmented Documentum’s offerings for compliance solutions.’ The press release cited in this paragraph noted that ‘Documentum and TrueArc are existing technology partners and have worked together to provide an integration for TrueArc’s enterprise-scalable records management solution with the Documentum ECM platform.’\n\n2003 – TNA 2003\n\nThe National Archives (TNA) released an updated version of its PRO standard in 2003, known as TNA 2003. This standard would be superseded by MoReq2. (Source: @ZenInformation on Twitter, 12 February 2021).\n\n2003 – EMC acquires Documentum\n\nEMC acquired Documentum in 2003. (Source: EMC offers $1.7 billion in stock for Documentum, October 2003))\n\n2003 – FileNet P8 Records Manager\n\nFileNet released P8 Records Manager in 2003.

(Source: Open Text Acquires SER eGovernment)\n\nFrom 2003 – CNIPA (Italy)\n\nThe Italian Centro Nazionale per l’Informatica nella Pubblica Amministrazione (CNIPA) published a protocol for the management of electronic records, Protocollo Informatico in 2003.\n\nCNIPA was renamed DigitPA in 2009 and Agenzia per I’Italia digitale (AGID) in 2012. AGID is responsible for defining standards for the management of electronic records in Italian government agencies. (Source: Protocollo Informatico)\n\nMid 2003 – The challenges for enterprise Records Management\n\nIn Industry Trend Reports of May 2003, Bruce Silver (of Bruce Silver Associates) made the case for Enterprise Records Management in the wake of various ‘scandals’ involving the management of records at the time, including Enron/Anderson.\n\nSilver argued that EDM, email archive, and back-up solutions did not meet the ‘new statutory and regulatory records management requirements’ – DOD 5015.2, SEC Rules 17a-3 and 17a-4, NASD Rules 2210, 3010, and 3110, NYSE Rules 342 and 440, ISO 15489 and MoReq.\n\nSilver also noted that an effective (‘total’) ERM solution would ‘be implemented as an extension of the company’s ECM infrastructure’, providing for a single interface for all records stored in multiple locations ‘including third-party document management repositories in addition to the email system and network file system’.\n\n2003 – Key integrated EDM/RM vendors\n\nThe following is a list of ‘key vendors in the (Integrated Document Management) IDM Market Space’ in October 2003. The list is believed to have come from a Butler Group report:\n\nDocumentum 5. EDMS, web content, ERM, RM (through acquisition), collaboration, DAM.\n\nFileNet P8 Image Services. Content management, web content, image management, RM.\n\nGauss VIP Enterprise 8. Web content, DM, Imaging, ERM. (Acquired by Open Text)\n\nHummingbird Enterprise 5. Full IDM suite (DM, KM, portal, collaboration, workflow, imaging, RM)\n\nHyland Software OnBase. Integrated IDM but lacked strong web content, RM and collaboration.\n\nIBM Content Manager. ERM and worfklow.\n\nIdentitech FYI. Integrated IDM.\n\nInformation Management Research (IMR) Alchemy. IDM.\n\nLaserfiche Document Imaging. Integrated IDM including EDM, ERM.\n\nLegato ApplicationXtender, EmailXtender, DiskXtender. Integrated IDM.\n\nOpen Text Livelink.\n\nOptical Image Technology (OIT) DocFinity. Integrated IDM.\n\nOptika Acorde. Primarily for images and ERM. Not strong CM, RM or collaboration. Acquired Select Technologies for RM.\n\nTower Technology IDM, Seraph. Integrated IDM.\n\nWestbrook Fortis Suite, File Magic. Integrated IDM.\n\n2004 – Stellent acquires Optika\n\nStellent acquired Optika in early 2004. At this stage, Stellent’s primary product was Universal Content Management (UCM). (Source: Wikipedia article on Oracle Acquisitions)\n\nThe report of the sale in The Register stated that Stellent’s CEO said that ‘customers are looking to consolidate their content management needs, including imaging, business process management, web content management and record management with one vendor.’ The new product line was named Stellent Imaging and Business Procss Management (IBPM). The article also noted that Oracle would probably acquire Stellent following this acquisition (see 2006, below).\n\n2004 – ReMANO (Netherlands)\n\nIn 2004, the Netherlands government established a catalogue of software specifications for ERM systems (ReMANO) used by Dutch government bodies. (Source: ‘ERM System Requirements’, published in INFuture, 4-6 November 2009, by, Marko Lukicic, Ericsson)\n\nReMANO was replaced by NEN2082 – Eisen voor Functionaliteit van Informatie- en Archiefmanagement in programmatuur” in 2008. (NEN 2082:2008 nl)\n\n2004/2005 – The Facebook appears\n\nAfter creating an early prototype called Facemash in 2003, The Facebook appeared in February 2004. The ‘The’ was dropped in August 2005.\n\nWeb 2.0 technology was about to go viral.\n\n2005 – C6 (France) builds D2 on top of EMC Documentum\n\nThe French ECM company C6 built a solution named D2, ‘a fully configurable web application for creating, managing, storing and delivering any type of information’, on top of EMC’s Documentum. (Source: C6 website ‘Company’ tab).\n\n2005 – ELAK (Austria)\n\nA project to introduce electronic filing (ELAK) commenced in Austria late 2001 and was completed in 2005. The solution was based on standard software products (e.g. Fabasoft e-Gov-Suite, MS-Office). (Source (ELAK – The e-filing system of the Austrian Federal Ministries)\n\n2006 – The National Archives of Australia ERMS standard\n\nThe National Archives of Australia (NAA) released its ‘Functional Specifications for Electronic Records Management Systems Software in February 2006. (ISBN 1 920807 34 9). The introduction noted that:\n\n(The document) provided Australian Government agencies with a set of generic requirements for ensuring adequate recordkeeping functionality within electronic records management systems (ERMS) software.\n\nAgencies were encouraged to make use of the ERMS specifications when designing or\n\npurchasing new, or upgrading existing, ERMS software. They could also\n\nbe used when auditing, assessing or reviewing an agency’s existing ERMS software.\n\nThe requirements were not intended to be a complete specification, but\n\nrather provide a template of key functional requirements that agencies may\n\nincorporate into their tender documentation when preparing to select and purchase\n\nnew ERMS software. Agencies were expected to assess and amend the\n\nfunctional requirements, and select requirements that best suit their own business\n\nand technical requirements and constraints.\n\nVery few products met the specific requirements of the ERMS specifications which led to some suggestion at the time that it limited choice.\n\n2006 – Rival XML Office document standards\n\nThe OpenDocument (ODF) standard was published as ISO/IEC 26300 in 2006.\n\nMicrosoft submitted initial material to the Ecma International Technical Committee TC45, where it was standardized to become ECMA-376, approved in December 2006. It was released as ISO 29500 in 2008.\n\nAccording to the Wikipedia article on Open Office XML (OOXML), ‘The ISO standardization of Office Open XML was controversial and embittered’, as it seemed unnecessary to have two rival XML standards.\n\n2006 – The world of collaboration\n\nThe Butler Group published a paper titled ‘Document Collaboration – Linking People, Process and Content’ in December 2006. The report noted that EDM systems had helped improve internal efficiency but there was now a need to ‘extend these systems to partners and stakeholders’ and deliver ‘sophisticated collaborative experiences’.\n\nThe paper listed the following EDM products:\n\nAdobe Acrobat family\n\nEMC eRoom\n\nIBM Notes/Domino, Workplace collaboration services, QuickPlace\n\nMicrosoft Office 2007\n\nOpen Text Livelink ECM – eDOCS (incorporating the former Hummingbird product suite acquired by Open Text in 2006)\n\nOracle Collaboration Suite, Content DB and Records DB\n\nStellent Collaboration Management\n\nVignette\n\n2006 – Spescom Software Inc\n\nA US SEC submission in January 2006 noted that Spescom Software Inc, a San Diego-based provider of computer integrated systems was the successor to Alpharel Inc and Altris Software Inc.\n\n2006 – Oracle acquires Stellent\n\nA 2006 Oracle press release titled ‘Oracle Buys Stellent‘ stated that Stellent was a global provider of enterprise content management (ECM) software solutions that included Document and Records Management, Web Content Management, Digital Asset Management, Imaging and Business Process Management, and Risk and Compliance. It also noted that the acquisition would ‘complement and extend Oracle’s existing content management solution portfolio’. Despite the acquisition, the ‘Stellent’ name persisted.\n\n2006 – IBM acquires FileNet\n\nIBM acquired FileNet in 2006. (Source: Wikipedia article on FileNet)\n\n2006 – Google enters the online EDM productivity and collaboration market\n\nIn 2006, Google launched Google Apps for Your Domain, a collection of cloud computing, productivity and collaboration tools, software and products. Various apps and elements were acquired and/or added over the years but a key one from an EDM point of view was Google Docs (Wikipedia article). However, Google Docs had no RM capability.\n\nA ZDNet article in June 2007 noted that Google Apps offered a tool for switching from Exchange Server and Lotus Notes, making Google a real alternative to Microsoft and IBM. Google Apps would later be rebranded G-Suite in 2016.\n\n2007 – Spescom exits the EDM market / Enterprise Informatics\n\nIn 2007, Spescom exiting the enterprise software sector with the sale of its US operation Enterprise Informatics. (Source – Wikipedia article on Spescom, original reference no longer accessible).\n\nEnterprise Informatics, originally founded in 1981, continued in existence as a subsidiary of Bentley Systems, Incorporated. It continued to market a suite of integrated document, configuration, and records management software products, mostly under the name eB.\n\n2007 – Zoho enters the online EDM collaboration market\n\nThe India-based Zoho Corporation, known as AdventNet Inc from 1996 to 2009, released Zoho Docs in 2007.\n\n2007 – HP Autonomy acquires Meridio\n\nMeridio was acquired by HP Autonomy (a company that had had a long business partnership with Kainos) in 2007. The parent company Kainos continued to work with SharePoint-based solutions.\n\n2007 – EDRMS vendors\n\nForrester released a report into electronic records management vendors in early 2007. The products that it evaluated were as follows:\n\nCA MDY FileSurf v7.5 ^\n\nEMC Records Manager 5.3\n\nIBM FileNet P8 Records Manager v3.7 ^\n\nIBM Records Manager v4.1.3 #\n\nInterwoven Records Manager v 5.1 *\n\nMeridio Document and Records Manager v4.4 *\n\nOpen Text Livelink ECM – Records Management v3.8 ^\n\nOpen Text Livelink – eDOCS RM (formerly Hummingbird) v6.0.1\n\nOracle (formerly Stellent) Universal Records Management v7.1 #\n\nOracle Records DB v1.0 ~\n\nTower Software TRIM Context v6.0 *\n\nVignette Records & Documents v 7.0.5\n\n(Forrester assessment: ^ = leaders, # = close behind leaders, * = have hurdles to remain competitive’, ~ = basic functionality only)\n\nFrom 2007 – the history of Microsoft Teams\n\nThe history of Microsoft Teams begins in 2007, according to a post by David Maldow on the same subject, when Microsoft acquired a product called Parlano. Parlano had a team chat app product called MindAlign, and Microsoft wanted to integrate MindAlign into their existing Office Communicator software.\n\nOffice Communicator was replaced by Lync in 2010. Microsoft acquired Skype in 2011. See below for continuation in 2013.\n\n(Source: ‘The History of Microsoft Teams‘ by David Maldow, last updated on 22 May 2023, accessed 13 February 2024)\n\n2008 – NEN 2082\n\nThe Dutch government replaced ReMANO with NEN 2082 ‘Eisen voor functionaliteit van informatie- en archiefmanagement in programmatuur’ (‘Requirements for functionality of information and archive management in software’) in 2008 (NEN 2082:2008 nl). NEN 2082 was derived from MoReq, DOD 5015.2 and Australian standards. (See Eric Burger’s blog post ‘Nee, NEN 2082 is geen wettelijke verplichting‘ about its legal standing)\n\n2008 – MoReq2\n\nMoReq2 was published in 2008. It included new sections to support the testing of ERMS software for compliance with the standard. MoReq2 included the following vendors on its panel (Acknowledgements section):\n\nDocuware, Germany\n\nEDRM Solutions, USA\n\nEMC, Canada\n\nErgoGroup AS, Norway\n\nFabasoft, UK\n\nFileNet, UK\n\nFujitsu, UK\n\nGetronics, UK\n\nHaessler Information, Germany\n\nIBM, UK\n\nICZ, Czech Republic\n\nLockheed Martin, USA\n\nMeridio, UK\n\nObjective Corporation, UK\n\nOpen Text Corporation, UK\n\nSAPERION, Germany\n\nSER Solutions Deutschland, Germany\n\nTower Software, UK\n\nBoth MoReq and MoReq2 were based on the premise of a central ERMS being acquired and implemented by organisations to manage unstructured records, the types of records that are stored across network drives and in email systems. MoReq2 specifically clearly excluded the management of ‘structured data … stored under the management of a data processing application’. (Source: MoReq2, section 1.2 ‘Emphasis and Limitations of this Specification’, page 12.)\n\nThe first software product certified against MoReq2 was Fabasoft Folio. It was the only certified product until June 2014.\n\n2008 – EDMS and ERMS\n\nIn 2008, the International Standards Organisation, under ISO/TC171/SC2 ‘Document management applications’ proposed a framework for the integration of EDM and ERM systems. The definitions contained in that framework document noted that:\n\nAn EDMS was used to manage, control, locate and retrieve information in an electronic system.\n\nAn ERMS was used to manage electronic and non-electronic records according to accepted principles and practices of records management.\n\nAn integrated EDRMS would combine both capabilities.\n\nSection 6 of the report described general (but fairly detailed) functional requirements for an integrated EDMS/ERMS, outlined in the following diagram:\n\nGiven the massive proliferation of email, online systems and smart phones that were starting to create records, one might argue that the new ‘integrated EDRMS’ model was about 10 years too late.\n\n2009 – Autonomy acquires Interwoven\n\nIn 2009, HP Autonomy acquired Interwoven, a niche provider of enterprise content management software mostly to the legal industry. It primarily competed with Documentum in this space. Interwoven became Autonomy Interwoven and Autonomy iManage.\n\n2010 – MoReq2010\n\nMoReq was completely revised and published as MoReq2010 in 2010. There were key differences with its predecessor versions.\n\nIt de-emphasised, but did not remove, the idea of an ERMS being the central or sole recordkeeping system or repository for organisations.\n\nIt emphasised the need for line of business systems to incorporate a minimum, defined level of recordkeeping functionality.\n\nIt brought a degree of practicality about the management of records in other systems.\n\nIt provided for interoperability between all MoReq compliant systems, based on a common XML language.\n\nMoReq2010 established ‘… a definition of a common set of core services that are shared by many different types of records systems’. It provided a set of modules that could be incorporated into any software solution, including line of business applications, so they can be ‘MoReq compliant records systems’ (MCRS).\n\n2010 – Google’s DM capability enhanced\n\nIn March 2010, Google acquired DocVerse, an online document collaboration company. DocVerse allowed multiple user online collaboration on Microsoft Word documents, as well as other Microsoft Office formats, such as Excel and PowerPoint. (Source – Wikipedia article on Google Docs)\n\n2010 – SharePoint gains (some) RM wings\n\nSharePoint 2010 included a range of recordkeeping functionality. According to a web page titled ‘SharePoint 2010: Recordkeeping Considerations‘ by State Records NSW:\n\n‘Microsoft SharePoint 2010 is a software product with a range of uses, including website development, content management and collaboration. SharePoint allows users to collaborate on the creation, review and approval of various types of content, including documents, lists, discussions, wiki pages, web pages and blog posts. SharePoint is not a recordkeeping system (i.e. a system purposely designed to capture, maintain and provide access to records over time). When implemented ‘out of the box’, SharePoint has limited capacities for capturing and keeping records in a way that supports their ability to function as authentic evidence of business.’\n\nIn the article ‘Is SharePoint 2010 a compliant records solution‘ in the 30 June 2010 edition of IDM Magazine, the author states the following (emphasis added):\n\nAdam Harmetz, the Lead Program Manager for the SharePoint Document and Records Management engineering team at Microsoft said in a recent online interview about Records in SharePoint 2010, “We constantly get questions from around the world about how to deal with local government and industry standards for information management. Let me throw just a few at you… MOREQ2, VERS, ISO 15489, DOMEA, TNA, ERKS, the list goes on. Some of these standards are loosely based on one another and some have contradictory elements. Rather than focus our engineering efforts on addressing each of these standards in turn, we made the choice to deliver the usability and innovation required to make records management deployments successful and allow our partner ecosystem to build out the SharePoint platform to deal with specific requirements for those customers that are mandated to adhere to a specific standard.”\n\nDespite these comments, SharePoint 2010 was assessed by at least one consultant (Wise Technology Solutions) to meet 88% of the requirements of the then ICA Standard that became ISO 16175 Part 2.\n\nOn 16 December 2011, State Records NSW published a blog post titled ‘Initial advice on implementing recordkeeping in SharePoint 2010‘. The post noted that the Wise report had concluded that ‘SharePoint is 88% compliant with the ICA requirements’. It added that the areas where full compliance could not be achieved relate to:\n\nease of email capture\n\nnative security classification and access control\n\nphysical and hybrid records management\n\nThe report states that third party providers are able to offer products that plug SharePoint’s gaps in these areas.\n\nThe blog posted also stated that ‘… the report very clearly makes the point that ‘we note that the achievement of these results is reliant on appropriate design and governance of implementation, configuration and set up to ensure consistency with desired records management outcomes’.’\n\nEarly 2010 – Microsoft launches Office 365\n\nMicrosoft launched Office 365 on 28 June 2011. Office 365 was designed to be a successor to Microsoft’s Business Productivity Online Suite (BPOS). (Source: Wikipedia article on Office 365). It would not be until the mid 2010s that Office 365 would become an effective counter-solution to the G Suite.\n\n2011 – HP acquires Autonomy\n\nIn 2011, Hewlett-Packard acquired Autonomy for USD11.1 billion, ‘one of the UK’s biggest tech deals’. HP subsequently wrote down the value of Autonomy by USD8.8 billion within a year. (See below, including a court case in 2022 and further details in February 2024).\n\n2011 – OMG Records Management Services standard\n\nThe Object Management Group (OMG) released its Records Management Standard (RMS) in September 2011.\n\nAs noted in the scope section of the standard, ‘(The) specification provides models for software services to support management activities for electronic records’. Further, ‘… models are provided that describe the platform independent model (PIM) that defines the business domain of Records Management and the RM services to be provided’. Three technology-specific implementations are specified:\n\nPSM-1 – Web Services definition for Records Management Services in Web Service Description Language (WSDL). This is actually supplied as ten WSDL files; one for each Records Management Service.\n\nPSM-2 – A Records Management Service XSD. The XSD is for use in creating XML files for import/export of Managed Records from compliant environments and to use as a basis for forming XQuery/XPath statements for the query service.\n\nPSM-3 – An Attribute Profile XSD. The XSD is for capturing and communicating attribute profiles to permit flexible attribution of certain types of Records Management Objects.\n\n2011 – The death of ERM systems?\n\nIn his May 2011 blog post on MoReq2010, James Lappin suggested that traditional systems used to manage electronic documents and records, while not being entirely dead in the water, had ‘lost momentum’.\n\nJames proposed two specific reasons for this situation:\n\nThe global financial crisis (GFC) from 2008 that limited the ability of organisations to acquire and implement hugely expensive ERMS solutions.\n\nThe rise of Microsoft SharePoint and particularly SharePoint 2010. In some ways, Sharepoint 2010 had the potential to take – and may have already taken – the ERMS wind from the records managers sails.\n\nHe also noted that a series of interrelated user-environment issues may have also played a part in the loss of momentum.\n\nUsability and take up rates of the ERMS. These solutions are sometimes seen as ‘yet another system’ to manage the same records, using a classification structure that doesn’t make sense to most end users and is different from the way end users see and categorise their world.\n\nThe ongoing availability of and access to alternative places to store information, including network drives and email folders, and cloud-based storage and email solutions.\n\nThe rise and general availability of social networking tools and mobile applications used to create and share new forms of information content, and collaborate and communicate, including wikis, blogs, Twitter, Facebook, and similar solutions, often in an almost parallel ‘personal’ world to the official record.\n\nThe inability of ERMS solutions to manage structured data or to maintain and reproduce easily the diverse range of content created and stored in products like SharePoint. Indeed, one reasonably well known product has been described as an archive for SharePoint, even though the latter can quite easily manage its own archives.\n\nThe rise of search as a tool to find relevant information in context, and the related change from unstructured to structured in XML-based documents generated by products such as Microsoft Office 2007 and 2010.\n\n2013 – NARA releases Capstone\n\nPerhaps in recognition of the inability to really manage all email records, the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) or US National Archives released a recommended approach to the management of email records, named Capstone.\n\nCapstone requires US Federal Government agencies to transfer the mailboxes used by high-level accounts to NARA at some point after those mailboxes ceased to be active.\n\nNARA made no attempt to justify Capstone in recordkeeping theory.\n\n2013 – Slack appears and Lync and Skype connect\n\nSlack was released in 2013, the same year that Microsoft allowed Lync and Skype to connect; Lync was renamed Skype for Business in 2015. See below from 2016 for a continuation of this story.\n\n(Source: ‘The History of Microsoft Teams‘ by David Maldow, last updated on 22 May 2023, accessed 13 February 2024)\n\nFrom 2013 – GEVER (Switzerland)\n\nFrom 2013, the Swiss Federal Chancellery was responsible for managing all activities relating to electronic records and process management (Elektronische Geschäftsverwaltung), or GEVER. GEVER consisted of a collection of five standards for the management of electronic records. (Source with current update: Gever Bund)\n\n2014 – OneDrive and Office 365 Groups make their debut\n\nAccording to the Microsoft web page ‘Looking Back at Ten Years of Microsoft 365‘, OneDrive was introduced in January 2014, replacing the previous SkyDrive.\n\nOffice (later Microsoft) 365 Groups were introduced in 2014. Office 365 Groups provided a ‘cross-suite service’ allowing the members of the Group to access the same resources. Initially these resources were Outlook (Exchange Online mailbox), SharePoint Online, OneNote and Skype for Business.\n\n2015 – Co-Authoring in Office 365 and early AI\n\nMicrosoft introduced co-authoring in Office 365 in 2014, a couple of years after Google offered the same service. (Source: Microsoft web page ‘Looking Back at Ten Years of Microsoft 365‘)\n\n2015 – Hewlett Packard separates into HP Inc and HPE\n\nIn October 2015, the software products previously under the Autonomy banner were divided between HP Inc and Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE). HP Inc was assigned Autonomy’s content management software components including TeamSite, Qfiniti, Qfiniti Managed Services, MediaBin, Optimost, and Explore.\n\n2015 – EDRMS vendors\n\nDespite the alleged death of ERMS products in around 2010, many continued to thrive and grow. Some were acquired by others.\n\nThe following is a list of EDRMS vendors in December 2015 taken from a Gartner report diagram titled ‘Product or Service Scores for Trusted System of Record’ (with the scores included). Many of these products also appeared in the October 2016 ‘Magic Quadrant’ for Enterprise Content Management Systems as indicated)\n\nAlfresco (2.47) (also ECM)\n\nOpen Text (4.07) (also ECM)\n\nEMC Documentum (3.94) (as Dell EMC)(Acquired by Open Text)\n\nIBM (3.91) (also ECM)\n\nHPE (3.85)\n\nOracle (3.45) (also ECM)\n\nLaserfiche (2.45) (also ECM)\n\nMicrosoft (SharePoint) (2.38) (also ECM)\n\nHyland OnBase (2.37) (also ECM)\n\nLexmark (2.32) (also ECM)\n\nNewgen (2.18) (also ECM)\n\nObjective (2/10) (also ECM)\n\nBy 2015 – Oracle departing the scene?\n\nIn a July 2015 article titled ‘Looking for an Oracle IPM replacement‘ in the blog softwaredevelopmentforECM, it was noted that Oracle was ‘clearly, and publically, going in a different direction and moving away from traditional enterprise imaging and transactional content management’.\n\n2016 – OpenText, Micro Focus\n\nIn May 2016, OpenText acquired HP TeamSite, HP MediaBin, HP Qfiniti, HP Explore, HP Aurasma, and HP Optimost from HP Inc.\n\n2016 – Microsoft Teams to compete with Slack\n\nMicrosoft decided in 2016 to release a ‘new’ product, Microsoft Teams, to compete with the popular Slack service.\n\n(Source: ‘The History of Microsoft Teams‘ by David Maldow, last updated on 22 May 2023, accessed 13 February 2024)\n\n2017 – Microsoft Teams\n\nMicrosoft released Microsoft Teams globally in March 2017. Teams was positioned in two ways:\n\nAs a 1:1 (or 1:many) chat service with the ability to collaborate on files shared via OneDrive\n\nAs a logical group (the Office 365 Group) -based collaboration area allowing users to post content and collaborate on files stored in the Group’s SharePoint site.\n\nIn both cases, a ‘compliance copy’ of chat messages and Teams posts were stored in a hidden folder in the personal or Group mailboxes respectively. (Multiple sources, including this Microsoft page ‘Welcome to the new era of Microsoft Teams‘ written by Jeff Teper (‘the father of SharePoint’) dated 27 March 2023, accessed 13 February 2024)\n\nOrganisations already using (mostly server-based) Lync or Skype for Business could now offer an online (and mobile app) chat service to its users. Organisations already using the existing services and/or Slack may not have actively moved to Teams until new Enterprise Agreements were signed. And even then, there may have been a reluctance to add yet another app to the existing suite.\n\nNote also that this was at a time when emails were still the predominant way of communicating (aside from informal systems).\n\n2017 – Micro Focus merges with HPE\n\nMicro Focus merged with HPE in September 2017 and in doing so acquired the Content Manager EDRMS (formerly TRIM).\n\n2020 – 2022 – The pandemic years and working from home\n\nThe COVID virus began to spread around the world in 2020 forcing many people to remain and/work from home. According to David Maldow’s post ‘Slack’s user base stayed stable … while Microsoft Teams grew tenfold’. Zoom also grew mostly based on its video conference capabilities.\n\n(Source: ‘The History of Microsoft Teams‘ by David Maldow, last updated on 22 May 2023, accessed 13 February 2024)\n\nMany organisations found that working from home also meant it was harder (or perhaps more effort was required) to access and use digital recordkeeping systems. Content was being created via Teams (stored in SharePoint, possibly synced to File Explorer), and this had to be ‘uploaded’ to the recordkeeping system. Consequently, EDRMS usage dropped in many instances.\n\nSome EDRMS providers developed integration offerings with Microsoft 365 allowing content to be manually or auto-uploaded to their systems.\n\nPre 2021 – EDRM vendors (Australia)\n\nThe following is a list of products identified by the Victorian Public Records Office (PROV) in 2020. These products were all certified against the VERS standard, that required organisations to be able to create XML-based VERS Encapsulated Objects (VEOs) for long-term preservation.\n\nAlfresco\n\nAltus ECM\n\nAvePoint RevIM, Records, Cloud Records\n\nBluepoint Content Manager\n\nCanon Therefore 2012\n\nDocbureau\n\nELOprofessional / ELOenterprise\n\nHP Records Manager\n\nHP TRIM\n\nIBM Enterprise Records\n\nIBM FileNet P8 Records Manager\n\nInfo-Organiser\n\nLaserfiche\n\nMAGIQ Documents\n\nMicroFocus Content Manager\n\nObjective\n\nObjective ECM\n\nOpenText eDOCS RM\n\nOpenText Records Management\n\nOracle WebCentre Content\n\nRecFind 6\n\nRecordPoint\n\nTechnology One ECM\n\nTechnosoft OfficeTech\n\n2021 – EDRMS vendors\n\nThe following is a list of dedicated vendors that offered EDRMS solutions (and more in most cases) by early 2021. Many of these vendors have a long history not necessarily reflected in the above text. Most of these vendors provide Enterprise Content Management (ECM) services, including EDM and ERM capabilities.\n\nAlfresco ECM (alfresco.com)\n\nHyland OnBase (hyland.com)\n\nIBM ECM (ibm.com)\n\nKnowledgeone RecFind EDRM (knowledgeonecorp.com)\n\nLaserfiche RME (laserfiche.com)\n\nLexmark RIM (lexmark.com)\n\nMicro Focus Content Manager (microfocus.com)\n\nMicrosoft 365 (microsoft.com)\n\nNewgen RMS (newgensoft.com)\n\nObjective ECM (objective.com)\n\nOpen Text ECM (opentext.com)\n\nOracle ECM (docs.oracle.com)\n\nTechnologyOne ECM (technologyonecorp.com)\n\n2021 – Dedicated EDMS vendors\n\nEDM vendors never went away, but many – like Google Drive, DropBox and Box – were built in and for the cloud. This Capterra website has a fairly detailed listing of current EDMS vendors.\n\n2021 – NEN 2082 withdrawn\n\nIn January 2021, the Dutch government withdraw NEN 2082. (NEN 2082:2008 nl)\n\n2022 – Outcome of HP/Autonomy case\n\nAccording to a Reuters article dated 29 January 2022, Hewlett-Packard ‘won the majority of its civil case against British tech tycoon Mike Lynch over its acquisition of Autonomy in 2011’, although the damages were much less than the USD5 billion claimed.\n\n2022 – OpenText acquires Micro Focus\n\nAs noted above, Micro Focus merged with HPE in September 2017 and in doing so acquired Content Manager from HP.\n\nAccording to a press release dated 25 August 2022 on the OpenText website, OpenText acquired ‘… the entire issued and to be issued share capital of Micro Focus (LSE:MCRO, NYSE: ADS:MFGP) at a price of 532 pence per share’, or an enterprise value of approximately USD6 billion ‘on a fully diluted basis’. (Source: https://investors.opentext.com/press-releases/press-releases-details/2022/OpenText-to-Acquire-Micro-Focus-International-plc/default.aspx)\n\nIt is understood that this acquisition removed Micro Focus products from the HPE service offerings. As at 13 February 2024, the website hpe.com still has a page titled ‘HPE and Micro Focus Alliance‘ but neither the HPE Products or Solutions makes any obvious or direct reference to Content Manager. The Micro Focus website (which is now branded with the OpenText logo) has a page titled ‘Micro Focus + Hewlett Packard Enterprise‘ indicating it is now a strategic alliance.\n\nThe OpenText site contains content relating to (Micro Focus) ‘Enterprise Content Manager‘ and (Micro Focus) ‘Enterprise Content Manager Cloud‘.\n\n2023 – Email is huge\n\nBy 2023 there were an estimated four billion email users worldwide. There was (and remains) no realistic ability to consign every record that might be an email into a dedicated recordkeeping system.\n\n2023 – Microsoft Teams continues to grow\n\nBy 2023, at the tail end of the COVID pandemic where it was used by so many end users to work from home, Microsoft Teams had an estimated 300 million users, many of which found the ‘chat’ option a great alternative to emails for low-level communication. Teams meetings became commonplace, and the term ‘you’re on mute’ became a common phrase.\n\n2024 – Ongoing attempts by HP to recover money relating to Autonomy acquisition\n\nAccording to a Reuters article dated 13 February 2024, at a court case brought by HP in London seeking to reclaim lost value, HP’s lawyers argued the case for the recovery of around USD4 billion relating to its acquisition of Autonomy in 2011. Lawyers for Autonomy’s co-founder Mike Lunch claimed, in court filings, that the price paid would not have been much different in part because of Autonomy’s unique technology and HP’s strategic rationale for the acquisition.\n\nHP lost the case in June 2024.\n\nThe future of standards-based ERM/EDRM/ECM systems\n\nAlthough the definition of a record has remained largely intact for the past two decades – ‘evidence of business activity’ (ISO 15489) – the form of records has evolved and continues to do so.\n\nThe ever-expanded world of digital content has made it increasingly difficult to accurately and consistently identify, capture and manage records in all forms, a challenge to the notion that all records can be stored in a single system.\n\nThe ‘in place’ approach to managing electronic records – wherever they are stored – has strong appeal. But where will we be in another 20 years? Some thoughts:\n\nElectronic databases, whether on-premise or cloud-based (including subscription based), will be the primary method of capturing and storing a wide range of digital content rather than network file shares.\n\nMetadata will be automatically captured or auto-generated for all digital content based on the content itself.\n\nArtificial Intelligence (AI) will continue to grow in maturity, allowing records to be identified from all other digital content, classified, aggregated, and managed through to disposal/disposition or transfer to archives.\n\nEmail will, slowly, disappear as the current workforce transitions to chat- and video-based communication methods."
