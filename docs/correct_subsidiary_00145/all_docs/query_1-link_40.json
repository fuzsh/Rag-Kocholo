        "text": "Software products\n\nThis article is about middleware technology side of Oracle Fusion which consists of two parts - Oracle Fusion Applications and Oracle Fusion Middleware, both running on an open architecture ecosystem - Oracle Fusion Architecture. For the fusion applications, see Oracle Fusion Applications. For the open architecture ecosystem, see Oracle Fusion Architecture.\n\nOracle Fusion Middleware (FMW, also known as Fusion Middleware) consists of several software products from Oracle Corporation. FMW spans multiple services, including Java EE and developer tools, integration services, business intelligence, collaboration, and content management. FMW depends on open standards such as BPEL, SOAP, XML and JMS.[1]\n\nOracle Fusion Middleware provides software for the development, deployment, and management of service-oriented architecture (SOA). It includes what Oracle calls \"hot-pluggable\" architecture,[2] designed to facilitate integration with existing applications and systems from other software vendors such as IBM, Microsoft, and SAP AG.[citation needed]\n\nEvolution\n\n[edit]\n\nMany of the products included under the FMW banner do not themselves qualify as middleware products: \"Fusion Middleware\" essentially represents a re-branding of many of Oracle products outside of Oracle's core database and applications-software offerings—compare Oracle Fusion.\n\nOracle acquired many of its FMW products via acquisitions.[3] This includes products from BEA Systems and Stellent.\n\nIn order to provide standards-based software to assist with business process automation, HP has incorporated FMW into its \"service-oriented architecture (SOA) portfolio\".[4]\n\nOracle leveraged its Configurable Network Computing (CNC) technology acquired from its PeopleSoft/JD Edwards 2005 purchase.\n\nOracle Fusion Applications, based on Oracle Fusion Middleware,[5][6] were finally released in September 2010.[7]\n\nAccording to Oracle, as of 2013, over 120,000 customers were using Fusion Middleware.[8] This includes over 35 of the world's 50 largest companies and more than 750 of the BusinessWeek Global 1000, with FMW also supported by 7,500 partners.[9]\n\nAssessments\n\n[edit]\n\nIn January 2008, Oracle WebCenter Content (formerly Universal Content Management) won InfoWorld's \"Technology of the Year\" award for \"Best Enterprise Content Manager\", with Oracle SOA Suite winning the award for \"Best Enterprise Service Bus\".[10]\n\nIn 2007, Gartner wrote that \"Oracle Fusion Middleware has reached a degree of completeness that puts it on par with, and in some cases ahead of, competing software stacks\", and reported revenue from the suite of over US$1 billion during FY06, estimating the revenue from the genuinely middleware aspects at US$740 million.[11]\n\nOracle Fusion Middleware components\n\n[edit]\n\nInfrastructure / Application server\n\nOracle WebLogic Server (WLS)\n\nOracle Application Server (IAS)\n\nJRockit – a JVM whose functionality has now been merged to OpenJDK\n\nTuxedo (software)\n\nOracle Coherence\n\nOracle Service Registry – metadata registry\n\napplication-server security\n\nOracle Web Cache\n\nIntegration and process-management\n\nBPEL Process Manager\n\nOracle Business Activity Monitoring (Oracle BAM) – Business activity monitoring (BAM)\n\nbusiness rules\n\nBusiness Process Analysis Suite\n\nOracle BPM[12] – Business process management\n\nOracle Data Integrator (ODI) – an application using the database for set-based data integration[13]\n\nEnterprise connectivity (adapters)\n\nOracle Enterprise Messaging Service\n\nOracle Enterprise Service Bus\n\nOracle Application server B2B\n\nOracle Web Services Manager[14] (OWSM) - a security and monitoring product for web services[15]\n\nApplication development tools\n\nOracle Application Development Framework (ADF)\n\nJDeveloper\n\nOracle SOA Suite\n\nTopLink – a Java object-relational mapping package\n\nOracle Forms services\n\nOracle Developer Suite\n\nBusiness intelligence\n\nOracle Business Intelligence (OBIEE)\n\nOracle Crystal Ball[16] – enables stochastic forecasting and simulation using spreadsheet models\n\nOracle Discoverer\n\nData hubs\n\nOracle BI Publisher\n\nOracle Reports services\n\nSystems management\n\nOracle Enterprise Manager\n\nWeb services manager\n\nUser interaction / content management\n\nOracle Beehive – collaboration platform\n\nUnified messaging\n\nWorkspaces\n\nOracle WebCenter\n\nOracle Imaging and Process Management\n\nWeb content management\n\nRecords management\n\nEnterprise search\n\nDigital asset management\n\nEmail archiving\n\nIdentity management\n\nOracle Identity Management\n\nEnterprise Single sign-on\n\nOracle Entitlements Server\n\nOracle Identity Manager\n\nOracle Access Manager\n\nOracle Adaptive Access Manager\n\nOracle Virtual Directory\n\nSee also\n\n[edit]\n\nBEA Systems\n\nOracle Fusion Applications\n\nOracle Technology Network (OTN)\n\nStellent\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]"
