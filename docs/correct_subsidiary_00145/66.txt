Redwood Shores-based Oracle Corp., the world’s third-largest software company, took control of Stellent Inc. after shareholders with about 92 percent of the company’s stock accepted Oracle’s $440 million bid.

Oracle offered $13.50 a share for Eden Prairie, Minn.-based Stellent last month and said Tuesday in a statement that Stellent investors holding 28.8 million shares accepted the offer as of a deadline Monday.

The acquisition, Oracle’s 12th this year, may help it compete with Microsoft Corp., the world’s largest software maker, and SAP AG for sales of software used to run businesses. Stellent makes Web publishing and content management software used to organize documents, images and video. Oracle has spent about $20 billion since 2004 to buy other software makers.

Oracle acquired Stellent to broaden its offerings for managing “unstructured” content, according to Adam Holt, a JP Morgan Securities analyst.

In a note to investors on the day the deal was announced, Holt said Oracle executives had described the market for software to manage unstructured data as an area of “new growth opportunities.”

Shares of Oracle fell 8 cents to $17.99 in Nasdaq Stock Market composite trading Tuesday. They have advanced 47 percent this year.

Holders of the remaining outstanding Stellent stock will get $13.50 a share, Oracle said.

International Business Machines Corp. in Armonk, N.Y., is the world’s second-largest software maker.

Stellent, which has about 575 workers, will operate as a subsidiary of Oracle.
