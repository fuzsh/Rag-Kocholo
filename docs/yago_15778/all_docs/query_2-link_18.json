        "text": "Oh what a sweet little gem. This is the story of three young Dominican teens, blooming fully into their pubescent years, who live with their stubborn and old-school grandmother in the Lower East Side.\n\nThat’s it – no guns, no deaths, no melodrama.\n\nThese are first time actors who look incredibly natural on screen, and there isn’t a single weak link among them. \"Raising Victor Vargas\" is a sincere, quiet drama with life-affirming touches on romance, friendship and family.\n\nMovies of this kind and caliber are always a pleasure to discover.\n\nOne of the 2000's best films and one of the best \"teen\" films ever. It feels real all the way through. Authentic, funny and very moving. The kids are all great but is Altagracia Guzmán as the Grandma raising Victor and his brothers that steals the film from everyone in one of the warmest,most loving performance Ive ever seen on film. I havent seen it in years and still feels as fresh and genuine as it did back in 02. Can't find any faults in it. A little masterpiece."
