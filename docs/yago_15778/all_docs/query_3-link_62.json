        "text": "Like its teenage cast, this fresh, distinctive movie doesn't have any great concerns beyond its built-up New York Latino neighbourhood.\n\nDirected by Peter Sollett and set in a humid summer landscape of blue skies, brown stone and honey-coloured flesh, it does everything you'd want a low-budget debut to do. Victor (Victor Rasuk) is a would-be Lothario who doesn't quite have the walk to back up his macho talk. As a result, his romance with local honey \"Juicy Judy\" (Judy Marte) is awkward from the start.\n\nTo make matters worse, his best friend is faring well with Judy's best friend, and even Victor's younger sister is getting close to her younger brother. Added to which, his adoptive grandmother sees him as a corrupting influence on his younger siblings and takes increasingly radical steps to bring him into line. It's a small-scale drama, but everything feels totally natural; the performances (the cast are all non-professionals), the dialogue, and the everyday situations. As a result, you care what happens to these people - the effect is similar to that achieved by Lukas Moodysson with his debut, Show Me Love. And even if nothing much does happen, let's face it, we've all been there."
