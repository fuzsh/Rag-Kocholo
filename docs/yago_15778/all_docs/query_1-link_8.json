He also recently directed two episodes of CBS’ ‘Evil’.\n\nSollett is set to direct the upcoming ‘Minecraft’ film for Warner Bros which is still very much in active development.\n\nThe plot for ‘Metal Lords’ follows two kids who want to start a heavy metal band in a high school, where only two people care about heavy metal, they also find a girl who is very good at cello. The three of them decide to settle their differences and work together, so they can win the Battle of the Bands."
