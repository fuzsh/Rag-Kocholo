        "text": "In its more than 30 years of existence, the Sundance Film Festival has obtained a name recognition unlike that of any other industry event besides Cannes. The biggest independent film festival in the United States, held in January in a town whose big business is skiing, it’s a rite of passage for both scrappy, small-budget filmmakers and Hollywood names seeking what was once called indie cred. Its frequently circuslike atmosphere is a well-known component of its notoriety.\n\nI admit there were several times during my stays in Park City in the years I covered the festival that I longed for a different way. On days when a current of warm air would turn the town’s plentiful snow into wet mush I would carry around on my ankles from one screening to another, or when a car full of high-school students would flip me the bird en masse for the sin of walking into the parking lot they were leaving, I would think: Wouldn’t it be great if you could go to Sundance without actually leaving your town, or even your house? I dreamed of a festival perk by which films would be simulcast to screening rooms in Manhattan. After all, we do have the technology. What’s missing, I presume, is the business model, and that thing they used to call corporate synergy."
