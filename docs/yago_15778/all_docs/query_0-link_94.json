        "text": "Peter Sollett has been tapped to direct Warner Bros. film adaptation of Minecraft. According to Variety, Sollett, whose previous projects include Raising Victor Vargas, Freeheld, and Five Feet High and Rising, will serve as both writer and director on the film.\n\nRoy Lee, Jon Berg, and Minecraft's development studio Mojang are set to produce, and Jon Spaihts will serve as executive producer.\n\nLoading\n\nPlay\n\nWarner Bros. acquired the rights to make a Minecraft film back in 2014, and last year the film was delayed after Rob McElhenney, who was set to direct, left the project. Steve Carell was also in talks to star in the film but, according to Variety, scheduling issues arose, and he departed the project as well.\n\nIn other film news, a Final Destination reboot is currently in development with writers from the Saw franchise, and Aaron Sorkin thinks it's about time for a Social Network sequel. Brian Barnett is an IGN freelance writer. You can get your fix of Brian on Twitter @Ribnax or on The Platformers (video game podcast) or Hooray For Anime! (anime watch-along podcast)"
