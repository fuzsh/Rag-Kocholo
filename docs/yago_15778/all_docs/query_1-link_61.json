But Czech customs seized the script, and Forman didn't see it for a decade until Michael Douglas, who had taken over the production from his father, sent it to him in his American exile. He thought it exactly like the communist country from which he had fled in 1968.\n\nJack Nicholson was only offered the role of the anarchic McMurphy after Gene Hackman and Marlon Brando had turned it down, and the rest of the cast, who lived with and studied real patients, were unknowns, though they're now famous.\n\nPossibly the most interesting aspect of the picture is the warm co-operation that the moviemakers got from the enlightened staff and inmates of the psychiatric hospital in Oregon where it was shot. Apparently the hospital, by the time Kiselyak came to make this documentary, had become a far more repressive place than it had been in the mid-1970s.\n\nThe Italian Job is a very loose remake of the slack, xenophobic 1969 British comedy thriller, a few incidents and names from which it retains. The original became a cult movie largely because of a single Michael Caine line ('You're only supposed to blow the bloody doors off'), the three super-charged Mini Coopers carrying the stolen bullion in Turin, Noël Coward's final, very camp screen appearance, and a song now popular among boozy football fans.\n\nGary Gray's version is tauter, better made but insufficiently idiosyncratic to attract a cult following. It begins with a successful $35m bullion robbery in Venice, after which one of the crooks (Edward Norton) makes off with the loot after killing the gang's aged leader (Donald Sutherland). It ends with the vengeful survivors led by Mark Wahlberg staging another raid (involving Mini Coopers on Hollywood Boulevard and in the Los Angeles underground) to punish Norton and repossess the bullion. Now that justice rather than greed is the motive, they become honourable heroes. There's a brief homage to Caine when Norton watches Alfie on TV.\n\nEqually slick and sleek, and also involving a car chase in Los Angeles, is Ridley Scott's comedy thriller Matchstick Men, which has nothing to do with L.S. Lowry, although on an eclectic soundtrack that features numbers by Bobby Darin, Frank Sinatra, Mantovani, Herb Alpert and Marvin Gaye, there's 'Leaning on a Lamp Post' sung by another Lancashire icon, George Formby. A 'matchstick man' in this context is a confidence trickster, though the film's ace grifter (Nicolas Cage) prefers the term 'con artist'.\n\nHe's a twitchy compulsive-obsessive, falling apart probably through guilt induced by his exploitative activities. To ease his pain, a shrink advises him to contact the 14-year-old daughter (Alison Lohman), born to his ex-wife after their marriage broke up. Like the little girl who may or may not be the con man's offspring in Bogdanovich's Paper Moon, Cage's spirited daughter breaks through his defence systems and learns her father's trade. It's an entertaining divertissement which Scott must have had fun making after the heavy duty of Gladiator, Hannibal and Black Hawk Down. I'll say no more about the plot, except that serious students of con movies might well rise to the challenge of guessing the outcome.\n\nAlison Lohman got her role in the mainstream Matchstick Men as a result of an impressive big-screen debut in the independent movie White Oleander, the first feature film by the British documentarist, Peter Kosminsky.\n\nLohman plays Astrid Magnussen, a 14-year-old who goes through a succession of foster parents and orphanages after her mother (Michelle Pfeiffer) is jailed for the murder of her unfaithful lover (Billy Connolly). The mother, a pretentious photographer obsessed with the notion of the artist's superiority to ordinary folk, poisons all her daughter's relationships, driving one of the foster mothers to suicide. Eventually, of course, Astrid establishes her independence as a woman and as a portrait artist.\n\nThe mother is an egotistical monster, all the men (except for a sympathetic fellow orphanage inmate) are desperately weak, and the varied foster mothers (blue-collar religious maniac, neglected affluent Malibu housewife, hippie street-trader) are too much of a cross-section of southern California to ring true. The film ends on an unconvincingly affirmative note, but by sharp editing and the use of a hand-held camera Kosminksy keeps the picture moving at immense speed.\n\nDirected by Len Wiseman, a specialist in commercials and music videos, Underworld is a commonplace horror movie set in present-day Budapest where aristocratic vampires living in a luxurious gothic pile continue their centuries old battle with werewolves, who live in sewers and tunnels beneath the city.\n\nIt's hi-tech warfare with the lycanthropes using liquid daylight in their bullets and the vampires filling their ammunition with silver nitrate. The violence is relentless, the pace unvaried, the dialogue laughable. The music resembles Ravel's 'Bolero' played at double speed on a pneumatic drill. Bill Nighy, however, brings a world-weary gravitas to the vampires' immortal leader, and Kate Beckinsale's vampire warrior looks rather fetching in a figure-hugging black Latex suit and what in Diana Rigg's Avengers period were known as kinky boots. The desaturated colour photography is by the gifted British cameraman Tony Pierce-Roberts who shot A Room With a View, Howards End, The Remains of the Day and The Golden Bowl for Merchant-Ivory.\n\nRaising Victor Vargas, the promising, shoestring debut of a young New Yorker, Peter Sollett, concerns a macho Hispanic teenager meeting his match and becoming a real man when he starts courting a beauty who has been hardened by fighting off the advances of cocky young men. The setting is a hot summer in the Latino housing projects of Manhattan's Lower East Side and the entirely non-professional cast give the film a real authority.\n\nThe first movie of a Chinese Irishman, Lab Ky Mo's low-budget comedy Nine Dead Gay Guys is an appalling comedy set in London's gay underworld. Trading in homosexual stereotypes, it tells the story of two boozy young Irish rentboys who when not talking about blowjobs are giving them. There is unlikely to be anything less amusing or more offensive this year. Some misguidedly generous impulse led Steven Berkoff to be associated with it.\n\nThe Spanish filmmaker Victor Erice, now aged 63 and having a retrospective at the NFT, has directed two fiction films and a documentary. But like Jean Vigo, who died at the age of 29 and also made two features and a documentary, he has done enough to earn a seat in the cinematic pantheon. Erice's first film, The Spirit of the Beehive, is his masterpiece. Made in 1973 when Spain was preparing to emerge from the long dark night of Franco's rule, it's set in 1940 in a remote corner of a country left emotionally numb by the civil war. This beautiful, austere movie has a miraculous performance from Ana Torrent as a child obsessed with the figure of Boris Karloff's monster in the 1931 Frankenstein.\n\nPhilip French's top five films\n\n1. Crimson Gold (12A)\n\nBanned in Iran, this film about a botched heist in Tehran throws vivid light on a deeply unjust society.\n\n2. Belleville Rendez-vous (12A)\n\nWonderfully dotty French animated comedy involving the Tour de France and the Mafia Top 5.\n\n3. Spirited Away (PG)\n\nA wilful 10-year-old girl has a transforming dream in this delightful Japanese animated ghost story.\n\n4. Good Bye Lenin! (15)\n\nThoughtful post-Cold War comedy offering an alternative history of Germany since 1989."
