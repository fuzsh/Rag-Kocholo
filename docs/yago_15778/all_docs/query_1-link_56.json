        "text": "A new teen comedy film from the co-creator of Game of Thrones is coming to Netflix soon. Metal Lords sees two teenage misfits, Hunter and Kevin, team up in a bid to win a Battle of the Bands competition.\n\nThe two kids decide to start a heavy metal band in their high school - where they are the only two kids who care about heavy metal. With schoolmates more interested in Bieber than Black Sabbath, finding a bassist is a struggle - until Kevin overhears Emily playing her cello.\n\nThe synopsis reads: “The motley crew must contend with school, parents, hormones and teen angst while trying to get along long enough to win the Battle of the Bands.”\n\nRead more: When is the Hard Cell release date on Netflix and what is the comedy series about?\n\nMetal Lords was written by D.B. Weiss - the co-creator of Game of Thrones - and is directed by Peter Sollett, known for his previous films Raising Victor Vargas and Nick & Norah’s Infinite Playlist. It stars Adrian Greensmith as diehard metal fan and guitarist Hunter, Jaeden Martell as his best friend and drummer Kevin, and Isis Hainsworth as cellist Emily.\n\nD.B. Weiss on the Metal Lords plot\n\nWriter D.B. Weiss said he first had the idea for Metal Lords years before Game of Thrones began. He added the film was ‘almost pure fiction, but drawn loosely from life’.\n\nHe said: “I look back at my experiences growing up and I was a big music kid. I’m still a music kid.\n\n“I played in a band in high school, and when you do that, there’s a comic discrepancy between how important what you’re doing seems to you and how important what you’re doing looks to anyone outside yourself — which is not important at all.\n\n“Like in the film, I had the experience of being in a band with my friends and then joining another band when they lost their guitar player. So I started playing with these guys - their world was a bit different from mine, and that experience was the kernel at the heart of the story of this movie.”\n\nWeiss added that he wanted viewers to come away feeling a little better than they did before watching it. He added that he hoped people would see something of themselves in the characters.\n\nHe said: “On the surface, the music can be dark and aggressive. It’s often meant to freak people out.\n\n“But the uses to which the music is put are often the opposite of that. It’s music for people who don’t feel like they have a place in the world they see around them.\n\n“Music for people who are looking for a way to express that feeling of being on the outside. To me, at its core, this is a story about three people who don’t fit in, learning how to not fit in together.”\n\nMetal Lords release date\n\nThe film will be released on Netflix on Friday 8 April at 8am in the UK. Its run time is 1hr 38m.\n\nMetal Lords rating\n\nThe film has been rated R for its language throughout, sexual references, nudity, and drug/alcohol use – all involving teens. The R rating stands for Restricted, children under 17 require accompanying parent or adult guardian."
