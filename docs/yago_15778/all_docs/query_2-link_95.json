        "text": "A sweaty teenager licks his lips and removes his wife-beater tank top, only to discover the comic realities of his latest conquest.\n\nNo, this isn't another sequel to \"American Pie\" or even a Spanish spinoff, Ã  la \"American Empanada.\" It's \"Raising Victor Vargas,\" Peter Sollett's tender portrait of adolescence in New York's Lower East Side.\n\nWorking from his NYU student short based on a story by Sollett and Eva Vives, the first-time feature filmmaker Sollett scripted this coming-of-age dramedy for his native Bensonhurst. But when the best auditions came from kids in Manhattan's East Village, the writer-director transplanted the story to his Latino cast's lower-class home turf.\n\nThe relocation sacrifices nothing in authenticity, thanks to an excellent ensemble of non-professional actors, led by Victor Rasuk. As the film opens, Rasuk's titular teen is smarting from a liaison with the infamous \"Fat Donna.\" Victor's younger sister relishes spreading such gossip, in what puts his ladies' man reputation literally on the line.\n\nDesperate for damage control, Victor and buddy Harold head to the local pool, where they set their sights on neighborhood hottie, Judy (Judy Marte), and her gal pal, Melonie. When Victor's initial advances meet with a resounding thud, he enlists Judy's vomit-prone little brother to make a proper introduction.\n\nVictor's basically a good kid, persistent enough to keep up his cocky strut and clueless enough to think it fools anyone. Couch potato sis Vicki rolls her eyes at him like any annoyed sibling, but younger brother Nino idolizes him, to their strict Catholic grandma's dismay. She places the decline of western civilization squarely at Victor's feet.\n\nStill, the biggest evils here are hormones gone wild. Neither drugs nor gang violence enter into the family's cramped two bedroom apartment, and there's little mention of the circumstances surrounding their Dominican grandmother's role as legal guardian. \"Raising Victor Vargas\" isn't exactly sanitized, but it's not a gritty urban snapshot either.\n\nAside from a narrative detour to a social worker's office, not a whole lot happens. Sollett stresses characterization over plot as his young lovers fumble about their emotions. Victor and Judy aren't the only budding couple here, but Rasuk and Marte anchor the romance with painfully honest performances -- natural and awkward in all the right ways.\n\nWhile grandma does her best to pre-empt puberty for her charges, Sollett and his cast deftly handle the shifting dynamics between Victor and his Old World guardian. Each relationship manages compassion without sentiment, humor without cheap laughs, and an intimate eye for detail.\n\nSollett and cinematographer Tim Orr lend a certain nostalgic beauty to Victor's summer in the city, but such idyllic flourishes don't prevent the movie from feeling anything less than true.\n\nIt may not be hard-hitting docu-realism, but \"Raising Victor Vargas\" is a sincere alternative to the mainstream pastries and porno set."
