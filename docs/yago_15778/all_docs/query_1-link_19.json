        "text": "Young and rising star Michael Cera performs yet another nerdy role as Nick in the new romance-comedy “Nick and Norah’s Infinite Playlist.” Michael may be recognized from the recently big-screen films “Juno” and “Superbad.”\n\nHis costar Kat Dennings who plays the character Norah recently appeared in the comedy “House Bunny” and “The 40-Year Old Virgin.” Dennings’ unique beauty and smooth acting is evident in all the parts she has performed but is especially seen in her new character Norah.\n\nDirector Peter Sollett previously directed “Raising Victor Vargas.” His success is rising — he received several awards at the Cannes Residence Programme and his thesis film for New York University’s Tisch School of the Arts was seen at the Sundance Film Festival Cannes Film Festival and several other prestigious events.\n\nHis latest work “Playlist is a mixture of young teen-age romance and light comedy. The PG-13 film delivered a predictable, but still engaging story between Nick and Norah as they experience bizarre and unexpected events that all take place in one night.\n\nThe two meet at a nightclub, while on a scavenger hunt for the band Where’s Fluffy, as they are both running from a mutual frenemy Tris (Nick’s ex-girlfriend.)\n\nTris, played by Alexis Dziena, is a peer of Norah and makes her way through school with her catty and shallow remarks. Tris is a character who’s obnoxiously squeaky voice can turn-off anyone, except for devoted Ex, Nick.\n\nTris shows up (as she is also chasing Where’s Fluffy) at the same nightclub as Nick and Norah. As Norah tries to escape Tris, she plants a kiss on stranger” Nick in order to make Tris think she has a boyfriend.\n\nNick and Norah then properly introduce themselves to each other and the wild night begins. The whole movie set in only a few hour time frame encounters some twisted adventures and unexpected experiences.\n\nThrough the experiences and adventures Nick and Norah get to know each other much better and they start a romance that has challenges in its way.\n\nNorah is the daughter or a famous recording studio owner and has men clinging on her from all different directions but they are only interested in her money.\n\nNick comes across as her soul mate through the similar interest in music. Nick is also unaware of Norah’s famous status and treats her as a close friend instead of a friend with benefits.\n\nThis sweet but usual romance grows as the night goes on. Nick eventually gets past the heart-wrenching break-up of Tris and he moves on with his life.\n\nAlthough frequent moviegoers might prefer to see Cera in a role that is not so similar to the geek and insecure characters he played in both “Juno” and “Superbad you might be disappointed to know that his character, Nick, is very similar.\n\nDon’t have high expectations for this film. Playlist” is rather anti-climatic and at times bland. It is predictable and follows a usual high-school romance story-line.\n\nPreferred audiences are mature teens and young adults. This is not a family film and may be better suited for those who enjoy movies such as: “The House Bunny Juno and Superbad.”"
