        "text": "Sony has unveiled the first trailer for the teen comedy Nick and Norah's Infinite Playlist starring Michael Cera and Kat Dennings. This quirky comedy is about two loners who on a whim suddenly start dating as they head off on an evening adventure through New York City. Well, that's the best I can describe quickly, because it's actually about Norah asking Nick to be her boyfriend for five minutes and the ensuing adventure when they try and leave in Nick's piece of crap car. This actually looks pretty fun so I'm not going to start picking apart the story and the cast, instead, I'll just sit back and enjoy. In actuality, Michael Cera is always great and Kat Dennings looks like she'll hold her own as well, so why not? It may be this year's big high school movie, but that doesn't mean it can't be good - take a look yourself.\n\nWatch the trailer for Nick and Norah's Infinite Playlist:\n\n[flv:http://bitcast-a.bitgravity.com/firstshowing/nickandnora-playlist.flv http://bitcast-a.bitgravity.com/firstshowing/nickandnora-playlist.jpg 596 336]\n\nYou can also watch the Nick and Norah's Infinite Playlist trailer in High Definition on MySpace\n\nNick and Norah's Infinite Playlist is directed by indie filmmaker Peter Sollett, of only Raising Victor Vargas previously, while the screenplay was written by newcomer Lorene Scafaria.
