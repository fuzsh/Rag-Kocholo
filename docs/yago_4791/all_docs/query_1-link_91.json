        "text": "Directed by Ishiro Honda | Japan | 96 mins\n\nJapanese with English subtitles\n\nOne month after the Castle Bravo test made victims out of the crew of the Japanese fishing boat Lucky Dragon No. 5, producer Tomoyuki Tanaka began work on the first Japanese film to directly address the topic of nuclear power and destruction. Inspired by the recent success of American films like The Beast from 20,000 Fathoms, production limitations would result in the creation of the \"suitmation\" technique by special effects director Eiji Tsuburaya to depict the implacable and unstoppable Godzilla, influencing decades of Japanese science fiction to come. Adopting the anti-war beliefs of director Honda, the resulting film is a sobering tone poem about the revenge of nature upon mankind for its trespasses, and the ethical question of weapons of mass destruction. Sure to surprise anyone familiar with the later campier incarnations of the character, the original Godzilla is a dark and unrelenting work of righteous anger and despair.\n\nPart of our NUCLEAR HORROR: AMERICA X JAPAN Series\n\nIn the spirit of respect, reciprocity and truth, we honour and acknowledge that this screening takes place on Moh’kinsstis and the traditional Treaty 7 territory, as well as the oral practices of the Blackfoot confederacy: Siksika, Kainai, Piikani as well as the Îyâxe Nakoda and Tsuut’ina nations. We acknowledge that this territory is home to the Métis Nation of Alberta, Region 3 within the historical Northwest Métis homeland. Finally, we acknowledge all Nations, Indigenous and non, who live, work and play, as well as help steward this land, honour and celebrate this territory."
