        "text": "by Lee Price\n\nIshirôHonda and Akira Kurosawa walk into a bar…\n\nSome people are driven to work in film because they need to tell stories. Others become infatuated with film because of its ability to document reality. Akira Kurosawa, legendary director of Rashômon (1950), Ikiru (1952), and The Seven Samurai (1954), was a born storyteller. By contrast, Ishirô Honda, beloved director of Gojira (1954—for this essay, I’ll be using the American translation Godzilla to refer to the famous monster in Gojira), Rodan (1956), and Mothra (1961), never considered himself a natural storyteller. He was drawn to the cinema because of its ability to capture life.\n\nThese approaches to filmmaking are complementary, just as the vastly different temperaments of Kurosawa and Honda were complementary. Sharing a strong work ethic and an intense love of film, the two men became good friends while working in assistant director positions in the late 1930s and remained close for the next five decades.\n\nAbout a month ago, I wrote an essay for Wonders in the Dark about the friendship of two other directors—the world-famous Jean Renoir and the lesser-known production-designer-turned-director Eugene Lourié. As it’s well documented that Renoir once attended a matinee of Lourié’s first directorial effort The Beast from 20,000 Fathoms, I noted:\n\n“I’d give anything for a photo of Jean Renoir and Eugene Lourié in that movie theater…”\n\nNow I ask: Did Akira Kurosawa attend a matinee of Gojira in 1954? Maybe a private advance screening at Toho Studios where they both worked, or perhaps at Toho Studio’s Nichigeki Theater (spectacularly demolished by Godzilla during his first stomp through Tokyo)? Although I haven’t unearthed any documentation yet, I’d like to think the two friends watched it together—Kurosawa eager to see his friend succeed and Honda nervous to learn his friend’s opinion.\n\nI want a photo that captures that moment, too–Kurosawa and Honda in the theater watching Gojira—matted and framed on my wall right under the Renoir/Lourié one.\n\nMany years later, Kurosawa cited Gojira as one of his 100 favorite films, looking back on the movie with good cheer:\n\n“Mr. Honda is really an earnest, nice fellow. Imagine, e.g., what you would do if a monster like Godzilla emerges! Normally one would forget and abandon his duty and simply flee! You won’t? But the personnel in this movie properly and sincerely lead people, don’t they? That is typical of Mr. Honda. I love it. Well, he was my best friend. As you know, I am a pretty obstinate and demanding person. Thus, that I had never problems with him was due to HIS good personality.”\n\nBut I sometimes wonder whether Kurosawa’s initial reaction to Gojira may have been a bit more complex than this jovial commendation.\n\nGojira as Documentary\n\n“Godzilla was the most masterful of all the dinosaur movies because it made you believe it was really happening.”\n\nSteven Spielberg\n\nThe winner of the 1966 Oscar for Best Documentary was a fictional docu-drama about a nuclear attack on England. Peter Watkins, the film’s director, used familiar documentary techniques such as simulated, handheld newsreel-type footage and voice-over narration to cleverly ride the line between fiction and non-fiction. For the Academy voters, The War Game was declared non-fiction, even though it described a fictional event. Therefore, it was eligible for Best Documentary.\n\nGojira maintains a remarkably similar balance. Only the improbable nature of the central metaphor (substituting a mutated dinosaur for the nuclear weapon rather than simply letting the bomb be a bomb) and an oft-sidelined love story shift Gojira toward pure fiction. On the documentary side, Gojira’s clinical exploration of how a nation responds to crisis is remarkably similar to The War Game. While Watkins’ view is more sour and pessimistic regarding human nature in crisis, Ishirô Honda’s comparatively optimistic viewpoint may be more solidly grounded in actual experience. He had been there.\n\nHonda served in the Japanese Imperial Army for three long stretches between 1935 and 1945. When Japan surrendered, Honda found himself in a prisoner-of-war camp in Central China. Finally released, he set out for home, with his route passing through Hiroshima. “When I returned from the war and passed through Hiroshima,” he recalled, “there was a heavy atmosphere—a fear the earth was already coming to an end. That became the basis for the film (Gojira).” He later said that he was attracted to the story as an opportunity to make radiation visible.\n\nThe definition of film documentary has always been fluid. When he was just starting in the film business, Honda was very influenced by pioneer documentary filmmaker Robert J. Flaherty’s Man of Aran (1934): “Watching the heavy seas crushing against the high cliffs on the screen, I felt I had never seen the ocean so close before.” Flaherty’s type of you-are-there filmmaking remained closest to Honda’s heart. As usual with Flaherty, though, the filmmaker permitted himself a large degree of romantic license while composing his story of rugged life on the Irish coast. To achieve his vision, he staged a dramatic shark hunting scene (among people who no longer hunted sharks) and focused upon a central family unit actually consisting of unrelated people, personally selected by Flaherty. Honda employed about the same degree of license in filming the Odo Island scenes of Gojira. He strove to remain true to island life while wrapping the realism into a compelling fiction.\n\nBy the close of World War II, portable sound film cameras had advanced to the point where it became much easier for film studios to shoot on location, away from the soundstages that dominated professional filmmaking in the 1930s. On-location shooting appeared more documentary in appearance, and the change in visual style prompted the growth of new genres. In Hollywood, police procedurals like The Naked City were referred to as “semi-documentaries,” and some very talented filmmakers in Italy launched the critically acclaimed neo-realist movement.\n\nClosely following international trends, Akira Kurosawa intuitively grasped the appeal of mixing the new realism with hard-boiled fiction. In 1949, he developed a story from Belgian crime writer Georges Simenon to create his own Japanese police procedural, Stray Dog. He hired his old friend Ishirô Honda to serve as Assistant Director, assigning him responsibility for the semi-documentary footage of post-war Tokyo. Honda’s footage was so extraordinary that Kurosawa expanded the movie to accommodate the fascinating details of real life that Honda had captured. This is particularly evident in the eight-minute scene near the beginning where Toshiro Mifune explores the seamier side of the city. It is a tour-de-force of neo-realist semi-documentary cinema. In his memoir Something Like an Autobiography, Kurosawa graciously assigned the credit: “I’m often told that I captured the atmosphere of postwar Japan very well in Stray Dog, and if so, I owe a great deal of the success to Honda.”\n\nHonda’s natural inclinations for documentary-style filmmaking are evident throughout Gojira. It’s in the way he highlights non-actors in the Odo Island scenes, the staging of the tense face-off between concerned relatives and the Maritime Safety Agency, the breadth of human responses to the monster’s rampage through the city, and above all in the brutal, unsparing coverage of Tokyo in ruins. Indeed, it’s hard to imagine Kurosawa initially watching Gojira and not recalling Honda’s brilliant contributions to Stray Dog. The same realist temperament is fully on display.\n\nGodzilla as Scapegoat\n\n“Myths… are more difficult to decode because they contain greater distortions. The transfigurations are stronger in mythology. The victims become monstrous and display fantastic power. After sowing disaster, they reestablish order and become founding fathers or gods.”\n\nRené Girard, The Scapegoat\n\nWhen the United State occupation of Japan officially ended in 1952, the Japanese film industry found itself freed from military censorship, allowing filmmakers to address the realities of Hiroshima, Nagasaki, nuclear testing in the South Seas, and general nuclear anxiety for the first time. But despite the inescapable presence of these subjects in everyday life, studios had little assurance that the public had any desire to see them plastered on the big screen. Several nuclear-inspired movies were released—and received critical praise—but not to any great popular success.\n\nThanks to inspired use of its central metaphor, the story of Gojira offered an opportunity to approach the subject obliquely. Among Honda and his crew, it was widely understood that their mutated dinosaur would serve as a metaphor related to nuclear weapons. He would be presented as unstoppable, radioactive, and a leveler of cities. Audiences could choose to enjoy the monster Godzilla at face value—like they might vicariously enjoy scenes of a dragon, a Rhedosaurus, or a Kong—or they could plumb the deeper implications.\n\nBut things got murkier when a second nuclear metaphor entered the script. Godzilla is killed by a new super weapon called the Oxygen Destroyer, secretly created by the brilliant and tormented scientist Dr. Serizawa. It, too, functions as a nuclear metaphor, adding ethical questions that carried troubling historic resonance. If you follow the Oxygen-Destroyer metaphor to its natural conclusion, Gojira (a movie which surprisingly never mentions the United States once) poses the question: Was the US justified in its use of one, let alone two, nuclear weapons even if the weapons were used for an ultimately justifiable end?\n\n“A-Bombs against A-Bombs. H-Bombs against H-Bombs,” says Dr. Serizawa, suggesting that his Oxygen Destroyer is the most dangerous yet. “As a scientist—no, as a human being—adding another terrifying weapon to mankind’s arsenal is something I cannot allow.” But even though it’s apparently Serizawa’s weapon—rather than Godzilla—that poses the greatest threat to the world, the movie clearly aligns itself with the opposing side of the young lovers and their argument for a one-time-only use of the Oxygen Destroyer.\n\nAllegories require precision, but metaphors and symbols generally don’t. The symbolism of Gojira is evocative rather than one-to-one. The monster is like a nuclear weapon at times, but he can also be viewed as many other things, including a legendary dragon, the fearsome nobility of the Japanese spirit, and the nature of war. There is implied minor accountability for the United States in awakening Godzilla through nuclear testing, but the resulting annihilation of a city is the inevitable consequence of a very Japanese monster. Even though presented on a huge scale, the destruction feels more introspective and inward-looking (we’ve brought this on ourselves) rather than accusatory (the United States is responsible). At times, it’s as if Japan assumes a culpability that now must rightfully boomerang back on itself.\n\nFor a 1954 Japanese audience, the nuclear theme would have been bluntly announced in the very first scene of Gojira. The fishing boat that serves as Godzilla’s first target is explicitly based on the Lucky Dragon 5 boat that received massive Japanese press coverage just months earlier when the ship ventured too close to a nuclear bomb test, exposing the crew to life-threatening levels of radiation. Other overt nuclear references follow, including the radiation found on Odo Island, mention of Nagasaki in a brief train conversation, and the effects of Godzilla’s incinerating radioactive breath. The centerpiece of the movie, Godzilla’s relentless destructive path through Tokyo, is followed by a pan across the broken and smoldering cityscape that reconstructs the effects of the intense American firebombing of the city in 1945. And then come the extraordinarily elegiac scenes of overcrowded hospitals and shell shocked incomprehension which could easily pass for wartime documentary footage.\n\nThe Oxygen Destroyer subplot also evokes nuclear anxieties. Created by the brilliant and tormented Dr. Serizawa, the Oxygen Destroyer is a super weapon that annihilates all life in its vicinity. The scientist fears the effects of the weapon becoming available to politicians more than he fears Godzilla. By the time the ship sails to destroy the monster, the film’s metaphors have undergone a seismic shift. In mythological terms, Godzilla takes on the role of the scapegoat.\n\nGojira comfortably fits into the cultural reading of the scapegoat figure pioneered by French philosopher René Girard. Society has been destabilized, an outsider is present, the outsider is physically marked as different (even monstrous), and the community must destroy him to restore wholeness. If one looks beyond the original movie to its many sequels, the match becomes even more obvious, with Godzilla’s post-scapegoat function shifting toward sacred community protector, mysteriously resurrected from his seemingly-final skeletal demise. The scapegoat becomes savior.\n\nThe emotional tone of Godzilla’s death is orchestrated by the extraordinary score of composer Akira Ifukube. While many critics link Ifukube’s elegiac strains to the suicide of Dr. Serizawa, the score equally builds pathos for Godzilla’s inescapable doom. He receives a Godzilla-sized requiem.\n\nIn later interviews, Ifukube expressed a complex and nuanced view of the implied symbolism in Gojira. He said, “I even thought Godzilla was like the souls of the Japanese soldiers who died in the Pacific Ocean during the war.” Two years after scoring Gojira, Ifukube used a very slight variation on Gojira’s elegiac theme as a meditative accompaniment to scenes of Japanese war dead in Kon Ichikawa’s masterpiece The Burmese Harp (1956). By subtly using the scapegoat metaphor to provide an outlet for intense feelings of loss, Gojira was able to delicately address the most sensitive of subjects.\n\nTurning to René Girard again, “In many myths the wretched person’s presence is enough to contaminate everything around him, infecting men and beasts with the plague, ruining crops, poisoning food, causing game to disappear, and sowing discord around him. Everything shrivels under his feet and the grass does not grow again.” Godzilla is the enormously-magnified wretched person, spreading radioactivity wherever he stomps. By the movie’s close, he is the classic outcast scapegoat, mysteriously transformed into something dignified through collective violence and a mythic sacrifice.\n\nJapanese audiences in 1954 understood that Gojira offered some kind of a statement about nuclear weapons. Akira Kurosawa would have understood this, too. And as an intellectual, ambitious, and proudly Japanese filmmaker, he surely felt an urge to address the ever-present nuclear anxieties that he would have seen in the society around him. But could he ever hope to do it in as creative and powerful way as his friend Ishirô Honda?\n\nGojira’s Most Unlikely Sequels\n\nSo what was Akira Kurosawa thinking as he watched Gojira for the first time? His best friend had beaten him to tackling the world’s most pressing subject, and furthermore had succeeded with the challenging subject matter in the most unlikely manner. Was he happy for his best friend? Or was he jealous? Did it make him feel competitive?\n\nAll we know is that Kurosawa’s very next film, developed and filmed in 1955, was the great director’s first attempt at wrestling with issues of nuclear anxiety. In moments, I Live in Fear (also known as Record of a Living Being) appears to be on the verge of looping into science fiction in its struggle to engage its subject. I Live in Fear opens with music dominated by a theremin, the spooky-sounding early electronic instrument that became associated with science fiction when used to great effect by film composers Ferde Grofé for Rocketship X-M (1950) and Bernard Herrmann for The Day the Earth Stood Still (1951). However, the basic story of I Live in Fear is not science fiction but domestic drama shaped around the nuclear fears of a wealthy family’s patriarch (played by Kurosawa staple Toshiro Mifune) and his family’s efforts to have him declared mentally unfit. Then, as if to bookend the film with science fiction overtones, the movie ends with the patriarch plunging into a madness where he believes that he has left the doomed earth to find safety on another planet. Kurosawa ingeniously films Mifune against a blazing sun, as the old man experiences a vision of earth’s incineration. Naturally, this cues the return of the theremin for the closing credits.\n\nOne of the most powerful scenes in I Live in Fear recalls Gojira in a non-science-fiction way. Driven by his extreme nuclear fears, Mifune destroys the family’s factory in a devastating fire. While the viewer does not see the fire, the family drama climaxes in the burnt-out ruins, a setting that suggests the camera’s pan across destroyed Tokyo in Gojira and its evocations of the bombings of Hiroshima, Nagasaki, and Tokyo.\n\nI Live in Fear was a commercial failure and the critical response was mixed at best. For his next movie, Kurosawa would return to the samurai/historic form, cannily combining a Shakespeare plot with imaginatively staged action scenes. The result was magnificent on all counts, leaving I Live in Fear a nearly forgotten misfire between the major achievements of The Seven Samurai and Throne of Blood.\n\nFurther explorations into nuclear issues would have to wait. Kurosawa was not going to risk his career on another I Live in Fear… not at this point in his career, at least.\n\nBut Kurosawa lived a long productive life, and he finally did return to the themes that he first touched on in I Live in Fear. And, curiously, he did this in his twilight years through a series of collaborations with his old friend Ishirô Honda.\n\nOn a golf course in 1980, Kurosawa asked Honda if he would consider helping him with his current film, a historical epic called Kagemusha. Honda had not been offered a feature film to direct since Terror of MechaGodzilla in 1975 and he deeply desired to remain active in film. He accepted the offer and worked as Chief Assistant Director on both Kagemusha (1980) and Ran (1985). These were large-scale films in the popular Kurosawa mode, deftly combining strong action scenes with rigorous intellectual content.\n\nThen the Kurosawa and Honda team switched gears to embrace a new aesthetic for their final three films. For one of the first times in his life, Kurosawa appears to have allowed himself the freedom to enjoy a genuine collaborative approach between equals. The two men discussed the themes they wanted to explore at length. And from this emerged an autumnal trio of films: Dreams, Rhapsody in August, and Madadyo. The first two explicitly deal with nuclear issues, and the third is informed by a backdrop of the fire bombing of Tokyo. Kurosawa finally returned to the themes he first tentatively engaged in I Live in Fear, and Honda received the opportunity to explore nuclear issues from a different perspective than offered by Gojira and his other kaijū (strange beast) movies.\n\nFor Dreams, Honda’s behind-the-scenes presence is particularly pronounced in two of the eight vignettes. One of them is a deeply personal encounter between the surviving commander and the ghosts of his platoon—following a storyline that Honda had always wanted to develop based on his own wartime experiences. The other is “Mount Fuji in Red,” a special-effects-laden farewell to the volcanic kaijū scenes that dominated most of Honda’s professional career. Here the familiar scenes of mass panic serve as a backdrop to personal despair, creating a jarring juxtaposition.\n\nRhapsody in August allows both artists to go deeper into the subject than ever before. The mood could not be more different than the epic destruction of Gojira or the frenzied madness of I Live in Fear. This time, attention centers upon the calm figure of a matriarch, looking back upon the loss of her husband in Nagasaki 45 years before. Thanks to her presence and guidance, her visiting grandchildren come to better understand their family’s past and country’s history.\n\nThe key image in Rhapsody in August is a children’s jungle gym, preserved in its partially melted condition as a monument at Nagasaki. To borrow the Asian image of the yin yang symbol, I see this as an autumnal yin image to complement the yang of Gojira—two true paths for coming to terms with a reality almost too overwhelming to contemplate directly.\n\nStanding far apart from the standards sequels of Gojira, with their giant monsters engaged in bouts of professional wrestling, the line of I Live in Fear to Dreams to Rhapsody in August and Madadyo represents the most unlikely—and deadly serious—of Gojira’s sequels, as well as a stunning testimony to the integrity and vision of two of Japan’s greatest filmmakers.\n\nReferences\n\nBrothers, Peter H.
