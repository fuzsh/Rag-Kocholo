        "text": "As mentioned in my post Netflix and Learning About Japan (3), I recently rewatched ‘Gojira’ (‘Godzilla’) (directed by Ishiro Honda, 1954) for an episode of the Let’s Jaws For A Minute podcast. This is the fourth time that I have been on an episode of the Let’s Jaws For A Minute podcast, having previously been on an episode discussing a minute (or thereabouts) from ‘Jaws’ (directed by Steven Spielberg, 1975), a special Patreon-only episode discussing some of Spielberg’s movies in relation to Japan and WWII, and an episode discussing the movie “USS Indianapolis: Men of Courage”.\n\nYou can listen to the episode here.\n\nI was happy to speak on the episode not only due to my Japan interests, but also as the film relates to work that I have done on disaster narratives – see, for example, Japanese Disaster Narratives of the Early Twenty-First Century: Continuity and Change and Disaster Narratives by Design: Is Japan Different? (an article in which I identified a number of disaster movie conventions).\n\nIn the episode, I also discussed the concept of ‘pillars of truth’, which I was introduced to by Hideo Yokoyama, author of Kuraimazu Hai (‘Climber’s High’).\n\nOf course, we talked about a range of issues relating to the film’s content and the timing of its release. This included discussing the Daigo Fukuryumaru incident and, of course, the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Oppenheimer also gets mentioned.\n\nAs noted in the episode, I’m not particularly a fan of Godzilla, though (as noted in the post Netflix and Learning About Japan (2) in relation to the series ‘Midnight Diner’), I do like to spot Godzilla when in Shinjuku (see Favourite Photos: Godzilla in Shinjuku). I also enjoyed Godzilla Minus One – though not as much as I had expected to (perhaps after the discussion on this podcast episode, my views will change when/if I rewatch it)\n\nNaturally, on a podcast for ‘Let’s Jaws for a Minute’, we also talked about the movie’s relevance to ‘Jaws’.\n\nSee also Depicting the Atomic Bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki\n\nHere are some of my other Jaws related posts:\n\nVisiting Martha’s Vineyard\n\n“The Shark Is Broken“\n\nLet’s Jaws For A Minute Podcast Appearance\n\nJaws For A Day\n\n“Anyway we delivered the bomb” – Telling the Story of the Sinking of the USS Indianapolis\n\nSpielberg and Japan in WWII\n\nDiscussing Jaws with ChatGPT/OpenAI\n\nDiscussing Jaws with Bing\n\nDiscussing Jaws with Google Bard\n\nSo Jōzu (ジョーズ): A Day at Universal Studios Ja\n\nBook Review: “The Making of the Movie Jaws” by Edith Blake\n\nBook Review: “Jaws” by Peter Benchley\n\nBook Review of “An Adventurous Life” by Valerie Taylor\n\nBook Reviews – “Jaws: Memories from Martha’s Vineyard”, “Joe Alves: Designing Jaws”, and “Adventures in Amity: Tales from the Jaws Ride”\n\nNational Geographic Feb 1968 – The “Jaws” Article\n\nBook Review: “Close To Shore” by Michael Capuzzo\n\nNo Escaping Jaws\n\nFavourite Photos: Where’s Chrissie?\n\nSome other podcast episodes I’ve been on:"
