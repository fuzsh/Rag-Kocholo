        "text": "According to producer Tomoyuki Tanaka in 1985: âThe theme of the film, from the beginning, was the terror of the Bomb. Mankind had created the Bomb, and now nature was going to take revenge on mankind.â His quote can be found in Japan's Favorite Mon-Star: The Unauthorized Biography of \"The Big G\" (ISBN 1550223488).\n\nWhen composer Akira Ifukube was asked about how the film and character have been described as a metaphor for death and warfare, he agreed with this statement. He also explained that he âfelt sympathy for the monsterâ and âviewed him as a kind of symbolâ. Ifukube elaborated that the beast âwas bombarded by the same nuclear bombs that had struck Japan and he was attacked with modern technologyâ, having earlier noted that he felt Japan lost to American due to the advanced technology of America and making parallels to the beast and Japan. Ifukube's comments can be found in 1999's G-FAN #41.\n\nWorking title for the production was âThe Giant Monster from 20,000 Miles Beneath the Seaâ via Tomoyuki Tanaka. Executive producer Iwao Mori changed this to âProject Gâ. Noted in Japan's Favorite Mon-Star (ISBN 1550223488).\n\nShigeru Kayama was brought on board in May 1954 to assist in the creation of a workable story for Godzilla (1954). After working on the basis for a screenplay, he eventually created two novellas that were published as a single book in 1955 â \"Godzilla in Tokyo\" and \"Godzilla in Osaka\". The first novella generally represents the story beats of the 1954 film while the latter reflects the film's sequel, Godzilla Raids Again (1955). A full interview on the subject, featuring Jeffrey Angels, translator of the English Version of the book, can be found here.\n\nFor the American version, the Trans World logo is superimposed on the Toho logo before the movie starts.\n\nGodzilla Eats a Cow\n\nWhen the village alarm bell tolls, everyone is forced to flee to the hills, believing that high ground would protect them from the oncoming terror. Running to the hilltop, the crowds of terrified populace were confronted by the image of a demon that rose over the ridge. Grasping a dead cow in its powerful maw, Godzilla had shown the world that he existed.\n\nBackground:\n\nThis cut scene was filmed with the intention of replacing the, now famous, introduction of Godzilla over the hill top. The scene was cut by special effects guru Eiji Tsuburaya, who felt the effect looked unconvincing. In order to be visible, the cow would have to be over 5 meters in contrast with Godzilla, throwing off a sense of proportion with the title monster. So, the shot was redone with just Godzilla coming over the ridge, and roaring down menacingly at the humans below. As a side note: no footage of this scene is believed to still exist to this day, and only very few pictures prove its existence."
