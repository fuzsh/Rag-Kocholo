        "text": "He’s been dissolved at the bottom of the ocean, frozen solid in an iceberg, blown up in a volcano, disintegrated in an atomic meltdown, and killed by missiles on the Brooklyn Bridge, but thanks to the millions of fans who love him, Godzilla will never die. Japan’s biggest star returns in “Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire,” which pairs the towering titan and his hairy rival for a third time.\n\nLike many long-running franchises, the Godzilla series has gone through a number of distinct phases since its introduction. The first phase, which covers the 15 titles released between 1954 and 1975, is commonly known by fans as the Showa era. These kaiju films (kaiju is the Japanese term for giant monster) are marked by their dramatic shift in tone, from the somber and haunting original to the wonderfully ludicrous “Godzilla vs. Hedorah.”\n\nThe second phase is often referred to as the Heisei era, and it includes the seven titles released between 1984 and 1995. These Godzilla films feature a greater sense of narrative continuity, and they ask complex philosophical questions about science and humanity. The third phase is the Millennium era, which covers the six titles released between 1999 and 2004. The majority of these Godzilla films are self-contained stories, much like an anthology series. There have also been a number of standalone reboots, both Japanese and American, that put their own unique spin on the character, as well as the current MonsterVerse saga, which launched in 2014 with Gareth Edwards’ stylish reboot and continues with Adam Wingard’s “Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire.”\n\nTo help you program the ultimate monster marathon, here’s our Godzilla movie ranking, listed from wretched worst to bestial best. Long live the lizard king!"
