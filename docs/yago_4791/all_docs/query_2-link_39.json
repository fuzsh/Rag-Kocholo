        "text": "Overview\n\nToho’s Gojira (1954) was a surprisingly sentimental watch for a monster film. There is something very poignant about Japanese cinema that doesn’t seem to dissipate even across genres. I cannot quite pin point if its the sense of emptiness, or mono no aware that seems to pervade the sensibilities of many of the Japanese films I’ve watched thus far. In this review, I choose to focus on the historical aspects of Gojira (1954) and its American version Godzilla, King of the Monsters (1956) that was recut and re-filmed with new scenes.\n\nGojira & Godzilla\n\nGojira was the brainchild of Toho’s producer Tomoyuki Tanaka, who was struck with the inspiration make a monster film an allegory of the nuclear age that was ushered with the bombing of Hiroshima whilst flying back to Tokyo from a meeting in Jakarta. It was to become Japan’s first giant monster movie, although the Americans had their answer in King Kong (1933) over two decades ago.\n\nIts had a more serious theme, though. Gojira was conceptualized by Ishiro Honda to be a physical manifestation of the bomb, rather than a metaphor for it. Its main theme was to highlight the dangers of the nuclear arms race, and the destructive route that it was paving for mankind.\n\nBoth films have significant differences except that a Caucasian actor (ironically from Canada and not America) Raymond Burr was chosen to replace the Japanese protagonist in Godzilla, The King of the Monsters! (1956). Most of the “deleted scenes”, such as when a woman calms her terrified daughter (“We’ll see Daddy in heaven”) as Godzilla approaches them, were speculated to have been deleted due to the political motivations of the American producers, who didn’t want to offend its American audience.\n\nTwo years before his death, the idealistic director Ishiro Honda was said to have hoped that Gojira would bring an end to the nuclear arms race, although it never did. Rather, the nuclear arms race became more severe with the birth of Gojira. Not that the film had any direct impact on nuclear proliferation per se, but this reminded me a lot of the last scene where Serizawa cuts the cord of his diving suit to die along with Gojira so that no one else can gain knowledge of the Oxygen Destroyer to harm the world. It made me think of Gojira as a Frankenstein-ian figure, for that singular moment that Serizawa gains eye contact with Gojira underwater seemed to me like a moment of affinity – like the recognition of a master and his creation. In a sense, both the Oxygen Destroyer and Gojira function as a two mutually reinforcing symbols or manifestations of the nuclear bomb.\n\nI mentioned Frankenstein because if Gojira is thought to be the physical manifestation of a nuclear bomb, would man’s immense time, efforts and monies spent pouring into the creation of such weapons of mass destruction be considered an accidental, tragic invention?"
