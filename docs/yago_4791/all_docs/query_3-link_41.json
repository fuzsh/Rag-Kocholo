But the name of its director, Ishiro Honda, was for a long time only mentioned by foreign critics and fans in passing, if at all.\n\nEven today some write of him as \"Inoshiro\" Honda, a decades-old error that stubbornly lives on. If Honda had become a world-famous auteur like his long-time friend and Toho colleague Akira Kurosawa, the world would have sooner learned the correct reading for his first name."
