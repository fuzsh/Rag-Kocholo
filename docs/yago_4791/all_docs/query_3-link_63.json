        "text": "So I think most of us are familiar with Godzilla, the King of the Monsters. You’ve probably seen one of the Monsterverse movies like Godzilla 2014 or Godzilla vs Kong, both of which were incredibly popular. Some might know him purely through pop culture osmosis, after all Godzilla and his monster friends and foes have been referenced in various shows ranging from The Simpsons to Austin Powers and even Pee-Wee’s Big Adventure.\n\nHowever I think a lot of us don’t know or have forgotten most of the original movies that made Godzilla and his fellow kaiju (kaiju translates to English as Strange Beast) famous. Most people have almost no access to these classic movies and I feel that’s such a shame, as I feel they’re movies that, even though some are flawed, are still worth a watch. Therefore I think the best place to start is right at where it all started, Gojira, also known as Godzilla.\n\nReleased in 1954, just nine years after the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, Gojira was directed by Ishiro Honda. Ishiro Honda worked on many movies about naval warfare before Gojira, and he was well versed in special effects. The film was produced by Tomoyuki Tanaka, who dreamed of the idea of a giant monster awakening from nuclear radiation and attacking Japan, taking residence in Tokyo Bay. It went over well with Toho Studios, seeing the success of other 50’s monster movies. Further inspiration was added after the Lucky Dragon №5 incident, in which a Japanese fishing boat caught irradiated fish near Bikini Atoll.\n\nOriginally Godzilla himself was supposed to be animated using stop-motion, similar to movies like King Kong and the more recently released The Beast from 20,000 Fathoms. However, the animation was found to take too long so Toho tried something else. They used what is known as “suitmation”, portraying a monster or hero using a suit made of rubber. Godzilla was played by Haruo Nakajima, who would go on to not only play Godzilla but many other monsters throughout his career. Now it’s time to talk about the story itself.\n\nSPOILERS AHEAD\n\nOur story starts with the Japanese fishing vessel Eiko-Maru being sunken during a violent storm by a strange flash of light. This is the scene often compared to the Lucky Dragon №5 incident, which also involved a fishing vessel and radiation, which had only occurred nearly months after the film’s release. Another boat is quickly sent out, though it’s also quickly destroyed.\n\nWhile on the fictional Odo Island, the locals are noticing a shortage of local fish, to which an elder suggests the mythical beast Gojira is behind the disappearance. The natives of Odo Island used to sacrifice young women to the beast, which would bring fish back to the sea. However that night another storm hits and destroys most of the village, orphaning the young Shinkichi who insists his village was destroyed by a giant monster.\n\nWe transition over to the National Diet Building to discuss the events plaguing the sea and Odo Island as the witnesses give their testimony. They decide to send an investigation party led by the elderly paleontologist named Dr. Kyohei Yamane, who insists that perhaps a strange creature is responsible for these disasters. The team arrives on Odo Island and discovers irradiated footprints, and inside of one is a trilobite.\n\nThen, the village warning bell is struck and Godzilla makes his first appearance on screen, popping his head over a hill. The villagers and investigators run for their lives as Godzilla stomps around the island, just as quickly disappearing back into the ocean. As the team returns to the mainland, Professor Yamane presents a theory that Godzilla is an ancient creature awakened by atomic bombings, being forced away from its natural habitat.\n\nHowever, the Japanese government has many mixed thoughts about going public on Godzilla. After all, it has only been nine years after World War II and the world was still diplomatically sensitive. Also it would strain relations with the United States as well. The Japanese Navy decides to mine the waters in an attempt to kill Godzilla, but he makes his appearance before a party yacht in Tokyo Bay.\n\nNow we move towards the human element of the story. Yamane’s daughter, Emiko, is in love with Hideto Ogata, an employee of Southern Seas Salvage. However, Emiko is expected to marry Dr. Daisuke Serizawa, a scientist. As Emiko goes to tell Serizawa she learns that he has a secret of his own, something he’s created. This creation is the Oxygen Destroyer, a weapon that uses oxygen to create a volatile reaction in living things. It’s said by Serizawa that it has potential to be stronger than a nuclear bomb and urges Emiko to keep it a secret.\n\nBut as night falls Godzilla makes his first attack on Tokyo. As Godzilla begins to level the city, the Japanese Self Defense Forces set up an electric barrier that seems to work on Godzilla. This allows them to begin evacuations, but this peace only lasts until the next night. Godzilla returns to Tokyo, passing through the barrier and shrugging off bombs and artillery. As Godzilla tears Tokyo apart we can see a horrified mother holding her child, telling them that they’ll be with their father soon.\n\nGodzilla, now having annihilated Tokyo, wades back into Tokyo Bay and disappears. Having left thousands dead and injured in his wake, Emiko and Ogata survey the damage and try to help out. Emiko, now under a guilty conscience, tells Ogata of the Oxygen Destroyer and the two head over to see Serizawa. Ogata and Serizawa have a fight over the use of the Oxygen Destroyer as Serizawa would rather destroy the weapon than use it to destroy Godzilla.\n\nHowever, after seeing a haunting and tear jerking performance of Prayer for Peace (sung by the students of Toho High School of Music) and the devastation Godzilla has wrought he decides to use the Oxygen Destroyer. However, he burns all of his previous oxygen research, denying anyone else the use of such a weapon. Both Ogata and Serizawa are sent in heavy diving suits and deploy the Oxygen Destroyer on Godzilla, though Serizawa pulls his own plug and sacrifices himself.\n\nIn the end, Godzilla rises and lets out one last weak roar before sinking to the ocean. As he sinks, Godzilla’s body disintegrates into nothing but a skeleton, a haunting ghost of himself. The soldiers on board give a salute to Serizawa as Emiko and Ogata hold each other close. Yamane grimly states that if these nuclear tests continue, another Godzilla will appear.\n\nNow this is where I would end my talk about the story but I must mention one more thing. I must mention Steve Martin, not the comedic actor but the character played by Raymond Burr. You see, when the TransWorld Releasing Corporation and Embassy Pictures Corporation gained distribution rights, many audiences reacted negatively to the movie. To add a more relatable character Raymond Burr was brought in to add some commentary and interact with the other characters.\n\nNow Steve Martin is a subject of debate amongst Godzilla fans but I’ll throw in my own two cents here. I actually think Steve’s inclusion doesn’t ruin the movie, in fact I think it adds a new but different layer to the movie. Most scenes are kept pretty similar and Steve is added almost seamlessly to the plot. He tags along with other characters and never feels forced in any of the interactions.\n\nBut to sum up, Godzilla is a classic and to me has stood the test of time. The special, while outdated compared to modern movies, still looks stunning and beautiful. The decimated city and destroyed military vehicles just add to the dark tone. Godzilla’s suit still holds up pretty well if not having some scenes that look a bit strange. However, the suit looks its best when rampaging through the city, especially when tearing through the electric barrier.\n\nOne of the many strengths of the movie is surprisingly the actors. A lot of people criticize actors in Godzilla movies (some of which is warranted) but here the acting is superb. Even many of the background actors who play crying civilians are heartbreaking to watch because they genuinely feel like a disaster has struck the city (which many of the people did as quite a few were survivors from Hiroshima and Nagasaki).\n\nBut to me the best actor is Akihiko Hirata as Dr. Daisuke Serizawa. He’s a genius but created something terrible and never wants it to see the light of day. Even without words (and his character lacking one of his eyes) you can see the torture behind what he has made. And when he says the destruction Godzilla has caused you know that he’s forced to realize that his Oxygen Destroyer is the only thing that can stop Godzilla.\n\nThe soundtrack done by Akira Ifukube is legendary in my opinion. The Godzilla theme, which is almost as iconic as themes from Star Wars and Jaws, made its debut here. When Godzilla is destroying the city the music is chilling and can be a bit horrifying at parts. However, the two best tracks to me are Prayer for Peace, performed by Toho High School of Music, and Godzilla Under The Sea, which makes even the most hardened soul feel sorry for Godzilla as he lets out one final roar.\n\nTo me one of the greatest things about Godzilla is its social commentary. Godzilla is how Japan felt about nuclear weapons . Some have even compared the skin of Godzilla to looking similar to Hiroshima survivors. Both Godzilla and the Oxygen Destroyer are comparable to weapons of mass destruction, and how we use them will affect the world. In a way Dr. Serizawa prevented another nuclear disaster by destroying his notes and killing himself with the Oxygen Destroyer.\n\nOverall, Godzilla is such a perfect movie in so many ways, whether it be through the measure of a monster movie, a cautionary tale, or even just as a movie. I think even after sixty-eight years Godzilla still holds up strong against the test of time and has earned its place as King of the Monsters. Next week I’ll be analyzing and reviewing the very controversial sequel to Godzilla, Godzilla Raids Again."
