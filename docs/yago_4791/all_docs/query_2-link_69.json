        "text": "There is a saying by the infamous Roger Ebert that keeps flashing through my mind in every film screening:\n\nArt is the closest we can come to understanding how a stranger really feels\n\nI’ve always carried an absolute belief that art captures history, appreciating art allows humans to depart from their temporal presence. For a person whose childhood resided with binge-watching Doraemon, I thank art for realising the insane time-travel dream without tucking myself in the drawer.\n\nAnd because of that, watching Gojira has been quite an experience for many reasons. Never have I been a hardcore fan of Godzilla nor a fan of monster movies in general. I grew up watching tons of Super Sentai episodes and I pride myself in having a tape collection of it. Then I spent my teenage life going crazy about Western pop culture. Thus on making sense of Gojira, a part of me reminisced about the battle with Kaiju from Japanese movies and the other part attempted to analyse the political charge in this 1954 black and white film.\n\nThe familiarisation with flawless CGI had me step back a bit in an encounter with a Toho old movie sorted as a B-movie, often mocked for a good reason (Kirby 2011). Lest we leave the historical wounds which struck Japan in Hiroshima and Nagasaki out of analysing Gojira. Blogger Ett Btt regarded the film to be less about Godzilla and how people are affected by the existence of the creature (2013), Ishiro Honda understood it best as a country to bear the pain of radiation. Dr Yamane knows the Godzilla death would not put a halt to everything, like director Honda knew the atomic bombs were not the only threat – it was the consequences that count.\n\n“We see the crowded hospital beds and hallways, filled with the hurt, their bloody burnt faces, and the radiation tests on children—all expressed in camera travellings that move horizontally showing their faces—all the harm and sadness in the piercing cries and screams.” – Jaime Grijaba (2018)\n\nVietnam has been through wars, too. And that was just another reason for my empathy, and sometimes a shiver down the spine, watching a cinematic portrait of inhumane acts. Director Ishiro Honda once talked about the movie: “When I returned from the war and passed through Hiroshima, there was a heavy atmosphere – a fear the Earth was already coming to an end. That became the basis for the film.”\n\nAt the moment the United States “sheltered Japan under its nuclear umbrella” (Reynolds 2017), the world has forgotten a Japan whose military power had been feared. The Filipinos have not, ever. I witnessed the rage bursting out from a local Manila tour guide when he explained to us the dungeon Japanese soldiers used to drown imprisoned Filipinos. In Gojira, impotence replaced the once imperialist forces, Tokyo is defenseless against the radioactive daikaiju. Japanese pop culture since Gojira, foresaw a drastic change, a cultivation of similar epic battles are detectable in well-known mangas and animes.\n\nLive-tweeting session spiced up the whole experience just a bit too much. Rarely have I enjoyed an infamous Asian movie, read and tweeted to classmates whose exposure to kaiju and Japanese films has varied from little to a bunch.\n\nThis slideshow requires JavaScript.\n\nReferences:"
