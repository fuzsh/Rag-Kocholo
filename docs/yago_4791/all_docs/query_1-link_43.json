        "text": "Godzilla (original title Gojira) is the original 1954 science fiction film featuring the legendary radiation-spewing \"Kaiju\". Directed by Ishirô Honda and starring Akira Takarada, Momoko Kôchi, Akihiko Hirata, Takashi Shimura, and Fuyuki Murakami, the film was viewed as a thinly veiled critique of the incendiary and atomic bombings of Japan during World War II. For its subsequent release in the United States in 1956 under the title Godzilla, King of the Monsters, the film was heavily edited to remove most of its references to Hiroshima and Nagasaki, and several new scenes were shot that featured Raymond Burr. The Godzilla monster would be featured in numerous sequels throughout the last five decades, including a 1998 big budget \"reimagining\" from director Roland Emmerich. A new feature film adaptation, produced by Warner Bros. and directed by Gareth Edwards, was released in 2014 and formed the beginning of a new shared universe, named the \"MonsterVerse\".\n\nThe following weapons were used in the film Godzilla (1954):\n\n12 Gauge Double Barreled Shotgun\n\nJapanese villagers defend their homes with a 12 Gauge Double Barreled Shotgun.\n\nM1 Garand\n\nJapanese Ground Self-Defense Forces soldier carry the M1 Garand rifle.\n\nSumitomo M2\n\nJGSDF tanks carry a mounted Sumitomo M2 machine gun.\n\nBrowning M1917\n\nThe JGSDF deploy a Browning M1917 machine gun against the expected attack.\n\nBrowning M1919A4\n\nThe JGSDF deploy a Browning M1919A4 against the impending invader. This scene is reused as stock footage in the sequel, Godzilla Raids Again during a presentation on the previous attack.\n\nM114 Howitzer\n\nJGSDF deploy several M114 155mm howitzers against the seaborne enemy.\n\n5-inch Air-to-Ground Rocket\n\nSeveral 5-inch air-to-ground rockets are fired from Japanese Air Self-Defense Forces F-86 Sabre fighter jets against the monster."
