        "text": "Godzilla (Japanese: ゴジラ, Hepburn: ''Gojira'') is a 1954 Japanese kaiju film directed by Ishirō Honda, with special effects by Eiji Tsuburaya. Produced and distributed by Toho Studios, it is the first film in the Godzilla franchise and the Shōwa era. The film stars Akira Takarada, Momoko Kōchi, Akihiko Hirata, and Takashi Shimura, with Haruo Nakajima and Katsumi Tezuka as Godzilla. In the film, Japan's authorities deal with the sudden appearance of a giant monster, whose attacks trigger fears of nuclear holocaust during post-war Japan.\n\nGodzilla entered production after a Japanese-Indonesian co-production collapsed. Tsuburaya originally opted for a giant octopus before the filmmakers decided on a dinosaur-inspired creature. Godzilla pioneered a form of special effects called suitmation, in which a stunt performer wearing a suit interacts with miniature sets. Principal photography lasted 51 days, and special effects photography lasted 71 days.\n\nGodzilla was theatrically released in Japan on November 3, 1954, and grossed ¥183 million ($1.6 million) during its original theatrical run. In 1956, a heavily re-edited \"Americanized\" version, titled Godzilla, King of the Monsters! was released in the United States. The film spawned a multimedia franchise, being recognized by Guinness World Records as the longest running film franchise in history. The character Godzilla has since become an international pop culture icon, and the 1954 film has been largely credited for establishing the template for tokusatsu media. Since its release, the film has been regarded as a cinematic achievement and one of the best monster films ever made.\n\nPlot[]\n\nSeveral Japanese ships go missing at sea. Eyewitnesses from an island village claim a giant creature is responsible. They claim it is their fierce deity Godzilla. Yamane, a prominent paleontologist, travels to the island and confirms the existence of Godzilla. Yamane hypothesizes that Godzilla is a member of a now extinct species of dinosaur that was revived and mutated by exposure to the H-bomb. The military anticipates Godzilla’s arrival to Japan and attempts to destroy the monster. Meanwhile Yamane’s daughter, Emiko, is engaged to his colleague Serizawa, but she is really in love with Ogata, a sailor.\n\nGodzilla breaches the military’s defenses and lays waste to Tokyo. The monster is impervious to all forms of conventional weaponry. Emiko and Ogata believe that Serizawa may have discovered some way of stopping the monster. They confront Serizawa, who admits to having invented the oxygen destroyer, a device that kills all life in water. He is hesitant to reveal it because in the wrong hands it may prove more destructive than the H-bomb. Serizawa is moved by the plight of the Japanese people and relents.\n\nThe military arranges for the oxygen destroyer to be deployed in Tokyo Bay, where Godzilla is resting. Serizawa and Ogata descend together and plant the device. Ogata surfaces, but Serizawa remains behind in order to protect the secrets of the oxygen destroyer. Serizawa gives his blessing to Ogata and Emiko, and both Serizawa and Godzilla are killed by the oxygen destroyer.\n\nCast[]\n\nAkira Takarada as Hideto Ogata\n\nMomoko Kochi as Emiko Yamane\n\nAkihiko Hirata as Dr. Daisuke Serizawa\n\nTakashi Shimura as Dr. Kyohei Yamane\n\nFuyuki Murakami as Dr. Tanabe\n\nSachio Sakai as Hagiwara\n\nToranosuke Ogawa as Fishing Company President\n\nRen Yamamoto as Masaji\n\nKan Hayashi as Diet Chairman\n\nSeijiro Onda as Parliamentarian\n\nTakeo Oikawa as Defense Secretary\n\nKeiji Sakakida as Mayor Inada\n\nToyoaki Suzuki as Shinkichi\n\nKuninori Kodo as Izuma\n\nKin Sugai as Parliamentarian\n\nShizuko Azuma as Cruise Passenger\n\nTsuruko Mano as Shinkichi's and Masaji's Mother\n\nTadashi Okabe as Yamane's Assistant\n\nKiyoshi Kimata as Cruise Passenger\n\nRen Imaizumi as Coast Guard\n\nMasaaki Tachibana as Doomed Reporter\n\nYasuhisa Tsutsumi as Islander\n\nJiro Suzukawa as Islander\n\nSaburo Iketani as Reporter\n\nKatsumi Tezuka as Newspaper Reporter, Godzilla (first scene)\n\nHaruo Nakajima as Newspaper Reporter, Godzilla (second scene)\n\nKen Echigo as Sailor\n\nYu Fujiki as Ship's Radio Operator\n\nKazuo Hinata as Defense Official, Radio Operator\n\nShoichi Hirose as Parliamentarian\n\nTakuzo Kumagai as Defense Official\n\nSokichi Maki as Coast Guard\n\nJunichiro Mukai as Reporter, Defense Official\n\nJunpei Natsuki as Substation Operator\n\nRinsaku Ogata as Radio Operator\n\nYutaka Sada as Defense Official\n\nKenji Sahara as Reporter, Cruise Passenger\n\nAkira Sera as Parliamentarian\n\nHideo Shibuya as Reporter\n\nKamayuki Tsubono as Coast Guard\n\nMitsuo Tsuda as Policeman\n\nKoji Uno as Correspondent\n\nStaffs[]\n\nProducers: Iwao Mori (executive producer), Tomoyuki Tanaka\n\nDirector: Ishirō Honda\n\nScreenwriters: Takeo Murata, Ishirō Honda\n\nStory: Shigeru Kayama\n\nCinematographer: Masao Tamai\n\nFilm Editor: Kazuji Taira\n\nProduction Designer: Satoru Chûko, Takeo Kita\n\nProduction Management: Teruo Maki\n\nSecond Unit Director or Assistant Director: Kôji Kajita (chief assistant director), Susumu Takebayashi (second assistant director)\n\nSound Department: Ichirô Minawa (sound effects editor), Hisashi Shimonaga (sound recordist), Nobuyuki Tanaka (sound assistant), Norio Tone (sound recordist)\n\nMusic Composer: Akira Ifukube\n\nSpecial Effects:Sadamasa Arikawa (director of photography: special effects), Kaimai Eizo (special effects), Kyuichirô Kishida (special effects lighting), Yôichi Manoda (assistant camera), Hiroshi Mukoyama (matte work), Fumio Nakadai (special effects wire work), Yasuaki Sakamoto (production manager), Sokei Tomioka (assistant camera), Teizô Toshimitsu (monster builder), Eiji Tsuburaya (special effects director), Hajime Tsuburaya (assistant camera), Akira Watanabe (art director), Taka Yuki (opticals), Fuminori Ôhashi (special effects technical advisor, uncredited)\n\nVisual Effects: Sadao Iizuka (creator of Godzilla's atomic breath)\n\nStunts: Haruo Nakajima (stunt choreographer)\n\nCamera and Electrical Department: Yuzuru Aizawa (assistant camera),Chôshirô Ishii (lighting technician), Shinji Kojima (lighting assistant), Shoshichi Kojima (lighting assistant)\n\nAdditional Crew: Sei Ikeno (music assistant), Fumio Nakadai (tail supervisor), Shôji Okawa (tail supervisor)\n\nThemes[]\n\nIn the film, Godzilla symbolizes nuclear holocaust from Japan's perspective and has since been culturally identified as a strong metaphor for nuclear weapons. Producer Tomoyuki Tanaka stated that, \"The theme of the film, from the beginning, was the terror of the bomb. Mankind had created the bomb, and now nature was going to take revenge on mankind.\"Director Ishirō Honda filmed Godzilla's Tokyo rampage to mirror the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, stating, \"If Godzilla had been a dinosaur or some other animal, he would have been killed by just one cannonball. But if he were equal to an atomic bomb, we wouldn't know what to do. So, I took the characteristics of an atomic bomb and applied them to Godzilla.\"\n\nAcademics Anne Allison, Thomas Schnellbächer, and Steve Ryfle have stated that Godzilla contains political and cultural undertones that can be attributed to what the Japanese had experienced in World War II and that Japanese audiences were able to connect emotionally to the monster. They theorized that these viewers saw Godzilla as a victim and felt that the creature's backstory reminded them of their experiences in World War II. These academics have also claimed that as the atomic bomb testing that woke Godzilla was carried out by the United States, the film in a way can be seen to blame the United States for the problems and struggles that Japan experienced after World War II had ended. They also felt that the movie could have served as a cultural coping method to help the people of Japan move on from the events of the war.\n\nBrian Merchant from Motherboard called the film \"a bleak, powerful metaphor for nuclear power that still endures today\" and on its themes, he stated: \"It's an unflinchingly bleak, deceptively powerful film about coping with and taking responsibility for incomprehensible, manmade tragedy. Specifically, nuclear tragedies. It's arguably the best window into post-war attitudes towards nuclear power we've got—as seen from the perspective of its greatest victims.\" Terrence Rafferty from The New York Times stated Godzilla was \"an obvious gigantic, unsubtle, grimly purposeful metaphor for the atomic bomb\" and felt the film was \"extraordinarily solemn, full of earnest discussions\".\n\nMark Jacobson from the website of New York magazine stated that Godzilla \"transcends humanist prattle. Very few constructs have so perfectly embodied the overriding fears of a particular era. He is the symbol of a world gone wrong, a work of man that once created cannot be taken back or deleted. He rears up out of the sea as a creature of no particular belief system, apart from even the most elastic version of evolution and taxonomy, a reptilian id that lives inside the deepest recesses of the collective unconscious that cannot be reasoned with, a merciless undertaker who broaches no deals.\" Regarding the film, Jacobson stated, \"Honda's first Godzilla... is in line with these inwardly turned post-war films and perhaps the most brutally unforgiving of them. Shame-ridden self-flagellation was in order, and who better to supply the rubber-suited psychic punishment than the Rorschach-shaped big fella himself?\"\n\nTim Martin from The Daily Telegraph (London) stated that the original 1954 film was \"a far cry from its B-movie successors. It was a sober allegory of a film with ambitions as large as its thrice-normal budget, designed to shock and horrify an adult audience. Its roster of frightening images—cities in flames, overstuffed hospitals, irradiated children—would have been all too familiar to cinemagoers for whom memories of Hiroshima and Nagasaki were still less than a decade old, while its script posed deliberately inflammatory questions about the balance of postwar power and the development of nuclear energy.\" Martin also commented how the film's themes were omitted in the American version, stating, \"Its thematic preoccupation with nuclear energy proved even less acceptable to the American distributors who, after buying the film, began an extensive reshoot and recut for Western markets.\"\n\nInformation[]"
