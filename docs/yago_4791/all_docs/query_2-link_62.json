        "text": "$10/$6 Members and those in costume! | NR | Sci-Fi| 1 hr 36 min\n\nThe 1st Godzilla film.\n\nThe original Japanese version.\n\nNo English dubbing.\n\nNo Raymond Burr.\n\nUncut.\n\nIn 1954, Japan had suffered two atomic bomb explosions less than 10 years before. Godzilla would be a cinematic attempt to help a nation sort out this experience.\n\nIn the film, Godzilla symbolizes nuclear holocaust from Japan’s perspective and has since been culturally identified as a strong metaphor for nuclear weapons. Producer Tomoyuki Tanaka stated that, “The theme of the film, from the beginning, was the terror of the bomb. Mankind had created the bomb, and now nature was going to take revenge on mankind.\n\nDirector Ishirō Honda filmed Godzilla’s Tokyo rampage to mirror the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, stating, “If Godzilla had been a dinosaur or some other animal, he would have been killed by just one cannonball. But if he were equal to an atomic bomb, we wouldn’t know what to do. So, I took the characteristics of an atomic bomb and applied them to Godzilla”.\n\nCome see the original Godzilla.\n\nIn its original theatre format.\n\nWith full theatre sound."
