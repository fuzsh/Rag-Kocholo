        "text": "West Ham fans piled out of Stamford Bridge before the second half even got underway as Chelsea thrashed them.\n\nWest Ham found themselves 3-0 down at half-time to Chelsea before Nicolas Jackson added a fourth quickly after the break.\n\nNot that many Hammers fans were there to see it with the talkSPORT team remarking that the away end at Stamford Bridge was 'half empty'.\n\nCole Palmer, Conor Gallagher and Noni Madueke had struck in the first half to make it a miserable afternoon for West Ham before Jackson killed off the game with an easy tap-in just three minutes after half-time.\n\ntalkSPORT pundit and former Arsenal star Perry Groves was at the match on Sunday and could not believe his eyes.\n\n\"There are five or six West Ham players that aren't trying, they have lost their edge,\" he said on air.\n\n\"The (West Ham) players are playing like their manager isn't going to be there next season.\n\n\"The West Ham players aren't showing Moyes any respect.\n\n\"Chelsea look really hungry, Palmer and Gallagher are thriving because they are not being challenged.\"\n\nMoyes has never won at Stamford Bridge in his career as a manager in the Premier League.\n\nAnd with the Scotsman likely to leave West Ham at the end of the season, it does not appear he will break that duck anytime soon.\n\nPalmer broke the deadlock after just 15 minutes against the Hammers to equal an impressive Chelsea record.\n\nGallagher then doubled the lead with a fine volley before Noni Madueke made it 3-0 before half-time when he headed in from a corner.\n\nMadueke was involved again when he raced clear of West Ham's defence before teeing up Jackson just after the break.\n\nThe Senegal international then doubled his personal tally with 10 minutes left to make it 5-0."
