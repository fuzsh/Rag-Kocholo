        "text": "Premier League clubs have been battling for European places feverishly in recent weeks, and for many of them, it all came down to the final day.\n\nEngland will have four teams in the 2024/25 UEFA Champions League, two in the Europa League, and possibly two in the Conference League.\n\nLast season, Manchester City, Arsenal, Manchester United and Newcastle United made up the top four and qualified for the Champions League, although City would have been there regardless of league finish after winning the tournament.\n\nHowever, things will look a little different for 2024/25, with Man United and Newcastle enduring far less positive seasons and Aston Villa taking their opportunity to gatecrash the top table.\n\nThe Sporting News takes a look at who has qualified for the European places, with one potentially to be decided via the FA Cup final.\n\nMORE: Premier League clubs introduce spending cap\n\nWhich Premier League teams have qualified for Europe next season?\n\nHere is a breakdown of the Premier League teams playing in Europe in 2024/25.\n\nUEFA Champions League\n\nTeams qualified:\n\nArsenal\n\nManchester City\n\nLiverpool\n\nAston Villa\n\nAs the Champions League changes to a 'Swiss model' format in the 2024/25 campaign, the possibility of having five English clubs in the tournament was looking likely at one stage.\n\nWith 36 clubs set to compete in next season's Champions League, an increase from the previous 32, two of the additional four spots will be allocated to the best-performing nations in the 2023/24 season. Over the past six seasons, the Premier League would have earned an extra spot in five instances, typically going to the fifth-placed team. However, this season has seen Premier League teams dumped out of Europe early, resulting in Italy and Germany likely claiming these additional places. With no English side left in the Champions League semifinals, there is also no chance of a Premier League side qualifying for next season as the tournament winners.\n\nTherefore, only the teams who finish in the top four of the Premier League will qualify for next season's Champions League. Arsenal, Manchester City and Liverpool have long been guaranteed of the top three spots and City's win over Tottenham during the final week of the season meant Spurs were not longer able to catch Aston Villa in fourth.\n\nUEFA Europa League\n\nTeams qualified:\n\nTottenham\n\nManchester United\n\nThe team that finishes in fifth place in the Premier League is assured of a place in next season's Europa League group stage. The team that wins the FA Cup can also qualify.\n\nTottenham finished fifth and claimed the league qualification spot for the Europa League by avoiding defeat to Sheffield United on the final day. Manchester United, meanwhile, made it into the tournament by winning the FA Cup final against city-rivals Manchester City on May 25.\n\nIf Man City win, the Europa League spot available to the FA Cup winners will instead go to the sixth-placed team in the league (as City are already in the Champions League). That would mean Chelsea will qualify.\n\nIf Man United win the FA Cup, they will qualify for the Europa League group stages, and Chelsea will not.\n\nIf Man United win the cup, sixth place will become a Conference League spot because United did not finish in the top six.\n\nUEFA Conference League\n\nTeams qualified:\n\nLiverpool*\n\nChelsea\n\n*Will not play in the competition because they are guaranteed a spot in the Champions League\n\nEngland get one qualification spot for the UEFA Europa Conference League (which will be called just the UEFA Conference League from 2024/25). Nominally, that place goes to the winners of the Carabao Cup, which this season was Liverpool.\n\nHowever, the Reds will not be playing in that competition as they are guaranteed a Champions League spot via their league finish. As a result, this Conference League spot will go to the highest-placed finisher not already qualified for Europe.\n\nThat team is Chelsea, who finished sixth in the league in 2023/24. The Blues were on course to clinch second-tier European football (the Europa League) for next season after the final day of the Premier League campaign. However, Manchester United's FA Cup final triumph secured them a spot in the Europa League, while Chelsea will have to contend in the Conference League.\n\nPremier League European places as things stand\n\nAs of May 19, the final day of the Premier League season, these are the English teams occupying the qualifying spots for European competitions in 2024/25.\n\nChampions League: Manchester City, Arsenal, Liverpool, Aston Villa\n\nEuropa League: Tottenham Hotspur, Manchester United\n\nConference League: Chelsea\n\nEnglish Premier League table 2023/24\n\nUpdated on Sunday, May 19, 2024, the final matchday of the 2023/24 season.\n\nPosTeamPointsMatches\n\nPlayedGoals\n\nScoredGoal\n\nDifference1.Manchester City913896+622.Arsenal893891+623.Liverpool823886+454.Aston Villa683876+155.Tottenham Hotspur663874+136.Chelsea633877+147.Newcastle United603885+238.Manchester United603857-19.West Ham523860-1410.Crystal Palace493857-111.Brighton483855-712.Bournemouth483854-1313.Fulham473855-614.Wolves463850-1515.Everton*403840-1116.Brentford393856-917.
