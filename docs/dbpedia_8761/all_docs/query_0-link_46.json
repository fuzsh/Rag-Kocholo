        "text": "On the 6th July 2005 it was announced that London would host the 2012 Summer Olympics after the capital city’s bid narrowly defeated Paris bid’ by a very tight margin of 4 votes with the final ballot revealing scores of 54 to 50.\n\nAlthough the city of London was already well equipped with over a dozen football stadiums, the city required a new purpose built athletics stadium in order to host both track and field events with East London being the preferred location.\n\nIn 2007 the Organising Committee of the games selected Populous to build the stadium after being impressed by the architects design work on Arsenal’s Emirates Stadium.\n\nConstruction began a year later in April 2008 with the area cleared and basic bowl shaped foundations dug out. Perhaps rather surprising to the cynical British public, the stadium was completed in March 2011 slightly ahead of schedule and reportedly under budget in great contrast to the Football Association’s New Wembley.\n\nThe Olympic Stadium hosted the opening and closing ceremony of the Olympics and the 80,000 capacity venue was put to great use throughout the tournament with the majority of events appearing to sell out, including the usually less popular Paralympic Events.\n\nWith the general public feeling that the games had been a success and the Olympic Stadium proving popular with attendees, numerous parties were interested in using the ground after 2012.\n\nWith an emphasis on sustainability, West Ham United F.C’s bid was chosen as the favoured option for the future of the stadium with the club looking to vacate Upton Park and move to the Olympic Stadium in time for the 2017 season.\n\nThe East London based club will pay around £100 million to convert it to a 60,000 capacity with variable seating in place so that the ground can retain the athletics track and still remain a multi-purpose sports venue whilst still becoming an intimate football stadium."
