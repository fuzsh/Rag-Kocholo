        "text": "The sheer exuberance and brio of Borussia Dortmund’s stylish forward line will be pushed to its limit when they try to overcome a daunting three-goal deficit against Tottenham in the Champions League. The club boasts a fine pedigree for assembling exciting and potent attacks. Mario Götze, Jadon Sancho and Marco Reus are for the current Dortmund team what Robert Lewandowski, Reus and Jakub Blaszczykowski were in 2013, and Stéphane Chapuisat, Karl-Heinz Riedle and Andreas Möller were for the 1997 vintage.\n\nBut perhaps the most dazzling front three the club has ever assembled came half a century ago, back in the early years of the Bundesliga. The footballers in question were full West Germany internationals and big names in their day: Lothar Emmerich played on the left, Reinhard “Stan” Libuda on the right and Siggi Held represented the focal point of the attack at centre-forward. This thrilling frontline was crafted more or less from scratch by coach Willi Multhaup when he arrived at the club in the summer of 1965.\n\nEmmerich was the only one of the trio already in situ. This hugely prolific product of Dortmund’s youth scheme was 23 but had already been a regular for half a decade. He had won some trophies too as part of the side that won the 1963 championship and the DfB-Pokal the following year.\n\nThe contentious acquisition of 21-year-old right winger Libuda (nicknamed Stan after Stanley Mathews in tribute to his dribbling skills) from bitter local rivals Schalke represented quite the coup for Dortmund. Schalke had finished the previous season in the relegation places and accepted the pressing financial need to offload their big stars. During that close season a payments scandal involving Hertha Berlin broke and an unexpected Bundesliga expansion granted Schalke a reprieve from the drop, albeit too late to keep their Libuda, who had already signed a contract with Dortmund.\n\nThe other newcomer was Held, also 21 and a player who had caught the eye in the Regionalliga Süd with Kickers Offenbach. Six Bundesliga clubs chased his signature, so Dortmund were thrilled to win that particular contest.\n\nBalance is the key to every great attack and the individual skillsets of these three players complemented each other’s perfectly to create a frontline flooded with pace, power, skill and guile. Held was an intelligent and adaptable player who operated primarily as a centre-forward, but was ever-willing to drop deeper to collect the ball and link the play. The space he freed up made him the perfect foil for Emmerich, a nominal left winger who could hit the byline with the best of them but revelled most in drifting infield towards central goalscoring positions where he was lethal. Libuda was a more conventional touchline-hugging winger who stretched the play with his brilliant dribbling and crossing. He was a player of pace, though one who preferred to draw in defenders and beat them with skill rather than simple momentum.\n\nThe trio gelled rapidly thanks in part to the unconventional tactical system used by Multhaup, one loosely based on Helenio Herrera’s 5-2-3 set-up at Internazionale. A back four had the added security of Wolfgang Paul tucked in behind as sweeper, while a hard-working midfield pair of Aki Schmidt and Willi Sturm shuttled back and forth in front of them. Where the system differed from Inter was the use of the two wingers and it was Emmerich and Libuda who gave the team real attacking width and potency.\n\nA heavy 4-0 defeat at Braunschweig on the opening day proved just a blip as Dortmund started the 1965-66 season strongly with seven wins from their next eight matches. That run extended to 15 unbeaten games until ended by title rivals Munich 1860 just before the winter break. Dortmund stepped up a gear in the new year and hit a seam of imperious form. Another 13-game unbeaten run was put together with an impregnable defence at one end and the devastating front trio dismantling every defence it faced.\n\nEuropean progress in the Cup Winners’ Cup was equally serene. They beat the Maltese club, Floriana, 13-1 in the first round before scoring five more goals in the second. Spanish champions-elect Atlético Madrid were dispatched in the quarter-finals and holders West Ham were defeated comfortably home and away in the semis, prompting impressed Hammers manager Ron Greenwood to declare the West Germans to be the strongest European opponents his side had faced.\n\nDortmund became West Germany’s first European trophy winners with a deserved extra-time victory over Liverpool – Libuda scoring the winner from 40 yards – in the pouring rain at Hampden Park, but that mentally and physically gruelling game exacerbated a problem that had become apparent during the final months of the season. Dortmund’s all-action style demanded a lot of running from their players, especially the midfield pair of Schmidt and Sturm, and the effects of a long season were taking their toll. The Bundesliga title was squandered to the more prosaic 1860 Munich.\n\nThe season finished on a sour note for the club, but it had been an unrivalled success for their deadly front trio. Emmerich ended the season as the Bundesliga top scorer with 31 goals, with Held contributing a further 11. Their impact was further reflected at international level. Both Held and Emmerich were called up by West Germany for the first time in the spring of 1966 and both went on to star in the team that finished as runners-up to England in that summer’s World Cup. Libuda had been the only established international of the three, but he drifted from favour and wasn’t called up for the squad. He shrugged off this setback and bounced back to become an important player four years later in Mexico.\n\nThe trident shone again the following season and Emmerich retained his top scorer crown with another hefty 28-goal haul as Dortmund attained a third-place finish in the Bundesliga. Somewhat typical of the fragile psyche associated with Dortmund in years gone by, the 1967-68 season saw a team that had been regular title contenders collapse into a relegation battle and an eventual lowly 14th-place finish. Emmerich scored a more modest total of 18 goals and various injuries meant the all-star front three was unable to play together regularly.\n\nThis precipitated the break-up of their successful relationship in the summer of 1968. Libuda was the first to depart, returning home to his first love Schalke. Emmerich followed him out of the club a year later, as he went looking for a new challenge and a bigger wage packet at Belgium club Beerschot. Held stayed until 1971, when he returned to Kickers Offenbach, by now also a Bundesliga side.\n\nThe writing was on the wall for a changing Dortmund and now, fully stripped of one of the best Bundesliga forward lines in history, the club plunged to an ignominious relegation at the end of the 1971-72 season."
