        "text": "Catch up on the Premier League action\n\nGary Lineker introduces highlights and analysis from Saturday's six Premier League fixtures, plus the best of the action from Friday's game between Manchester United and Fulham.\n\nIf you missed Match of the Day, you can catch up now on BBC iPlayer.\n\nListen back to full match commentaries on BBC Sounds:\n\nArsenal 2-0 Wolves\n\nWest Ham 1-2 Aston Villa\n\nWest Ham 1-2 Aston Villa: Another opening day defeat\n\nMarissa Thomas\n\nBBC Sport journalist\n\nWest Ham began their Premier League campaign with defeat at the London Stadium in manager Julen Lopetegui's first game in charge.\n\nThe Hammers have now lost their opening Premier League fixture 16 times, more than any other side.\n\nThey got off to the worst possible start against Aston Villa, conceding just four minutes in when Amadou Onana rose highest after being unmarked from a corner.\n\nWest Ham were punished for defensive frailties last season when they conceded 74 league goals, the most ever by a side to end in the top half, and the Hammersâ highest total since 1967.\n\nHaving got back into the game in the first half through Lucas Paqueta's penalty, they were then stung late on by Jhon Duran's finish as Villa sealed a well-earned three points.\n\nConceding preventable goals is a bad habit they will have to break as they go deeper into the campaign under Lopetegui.\n\nWest Ham 1-2 Aston Villa: What Lopetegui said\n\nJulen Lopetegui spoke to BBC Radio 5 Live after West Ham's defeat to Aston Villa: \"We took some good chances and we deserved to win.\n\n\"I think that is football and sometimes these chances go in and sometimes not. We kept creating chances and pushing. We are very happy.\n\n\"The substitutes made a massive difference. I think we had a bit of a dip at that point and the manager made the changes at the right time. The three off them combined for that goal. We have some great players and we are ready to perform.\"\n\nOn season ambitions: \"We will have to wait and see because it is only the first game. We have a lot of ambition and we want to build on that. We want to be the best we can be.\"\n\nSutton's predictions: West Ham v Aston Villa\n\nA new season, and a new challenge for BBC Sport's prediction expert Chris Sutton.\n\nSutton faced off against a guest for each of the 38 game weeks in 2023-24 and triumphed 21-10 (with seven draws) to secure his second predictions title in a row.\n\nHe will have a guest each week this time too, but now you can find out if you can do any better.\n\nSutton's opponent for the opening round of games is The Courteeners frontman Liam Fray.\n\nSutton's prediction: 1-1\n\nI like what West Ham have done in the transfer market this summer and I am really excited about seeing Germany striker Niclas Fullkrug in the Premier League.\n\nFullkrug is an old-fashioned, throwback type of striker but he can finish.\n\nStyle-wise, the Hammers will be back to the 'West Ham way' under new boss Julen Lopetegui, which is what their fans wanted. Expectations are high so let's see how they get on.\n\nFor Aston Villa, the question is whether they can hit the heights of last season again.\n\nIt is going to be difficult for them to combine a top-four challenge with Champions League football once that gets started, and there might be some bumps in the road.\n\nThis is a difficult one to call because there are reasons to back both teams, so I am going to go with a draw.\n\nLiam's prediction: 1-2\n\nI like watching Villa - I think John McGinn is brilliant - but both of these teams are going to have good seasons.\n\nRead all of this weekend's predictions here\n\n'I don't see it as weighing heavy' - Bowen named captain\n\nJarrod Bowen has said being named captain of West Ham gives him \"another opportunity to represent the club with honour and pride\".\n\nThe England international forward, 27, joined the Hammers in January 2020 and scored the winning goal in their Europa Conference League final victory in 2023.\n\nHe will follow in the footsteps of legendary previous captains of the club, including Bobby Moore, Billy Bonds and Mark Noble.\n\n\"I don't see it as weighing heavy - I see it as another opportunity to represent this club with honour and pride,\" he said in a video posted on West Ham's social media channels.\n\n\"Those names will be remembered forever by West Ham fans and I'm not there yet, but I want to keeping working my way to get to there.\n\n\"I've said that I wanted to stay here for the rest of my life and I still haven't come off that page. If I can go down as a legend here in years to come, that would be great.\"\n\nLong-serving full-back Aaron Cresswell has been named as vice-captain.\n\nPhil McNulty's predictions - West Ham\n\nIt's that time of the year again - the annual act of foolishness in which I try to predict the outcome of the 2024-25 season for all 20 Premier League clubs.\n\nWest Ham United - eighth\n\nJulen Lopetegui has replaced David Moyes, whose full worth to West Ham United may yet become clear in the months ahead, and not just because he won the Europa Conference League.\n\nLopetegui has been keen to return to the Premier League since leaving Wolves and he now has the squad to prove his worth, backed by good transfer business in the summer.\n\nWest Ham already had plenty of class with Jarrod Bowen, Lucas Paqueta and Mohammed Kudus, but they have added to that with the signings of Crysencio Summerville from Leeds United and Niclas Fullkrug from Borussia Dortmund. The powerful Germany striker looks a perfect Premier League fit.\n\nLopetegui has also been reunited with former Wolves captain Max Kilman, who will play alongside Jean-Clair Todibo at the heart of defence, a signing regarded as a real coup.\n\nProspects look good for the Hammers, if Lopetegui can piece it all together. They are a good bet for a cup.\n\nRead all of Phil's predictions here\n\nDoes Wan-Bissaka improve West Ham?\n\nNat Hayward\n\nBBC Sport journalist\n\nAaron Wan-Bissaka is the latest addition to Julen Lopetegui's West Ham revolution, signing from Manchester United for Â£15m.\n\nThe 26-year-old right-back is the Hammers' eighth addition this summer with a total surpassing Â£120m - and that does not include the Â£34m they are obliged to pay Nice next summer to make Jean-Clair Todibo's loan permanent.\n\nFrom an objective standpoint, Â£15m for a player who made 236 appearances for United over five seasons - including 16 in the Champions League - and won the FA Cup and Carabao Cup does seem a bargain.\n\nThat's the view of former Derby defender Curtis Davies on Wednesday's Football Daily podcast.\n\nAccording to FBRef, Wan-Bissaka's 2.07 interceptions per 90 in the Premier League last season was higher than every West Ham player to have played a full match and his 73.1% of dribblers tackled places him just behind central defenders Angelo Ogbonna and Konstantinos Mavrapanos.\n\nThe man he will replace in Lopetegui's defence is probably 31-year-old Vladimir Coufal. Comparing the past three seasons for both players, Wan-Bissaka leads Coufal in tackles won (1.81 to 1.02), shots blocked (0.70 to 0.37) and percentage of dribblers tackled (70% to 50%).\n\nIt is this one-on-one defending that endeared Wan-Bissake to United supporters, his 2020 Champions League performance keeping Neymar and Kylian Mbappe quiet against Paris St-Germain a particular highlight.\n\nHis versatility is another strength, with Stretford Paddock's Jay Motty describing him as \"defensively one of the best in the world\" after featuring as a left-back in March's dramatic FA Cup quarter-final win over Liverpool.\n\nHowever, there are questions over his suitability for a progressive, possession-based style of play under Lopetegui. Two goals and 10 assists in 130 league games at Old Trafford does not scream attacking output, with BBC pundit and former Chelsea winger Pat Nevin once commenting: \"He can't cross a ball, external\".\n\nFrom an attacking perspective, Coufal outranks Wan-Bissaka per 90 in crosses (4.37 to 1.76), progressive passes (4.61 to 3.07) and goal-creating actions (0.29 to 0.05). Coufal is primarily known for his solidity and physicality yet his touches in the attacking third per 90 at 22 is higher than Wan-Bissaka at 18.4.\n\nNow it is Lopetegui's job to find a system that allows Wan-Bissaka to exhibit his defensive strength and manages his limitations going forward."
