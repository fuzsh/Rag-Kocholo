        "text": "Billy Clark, 26 October, 2016 - West Ham United v Chelsea\n\nTravel: Driving up from the South Coast was frustrating after joining the M25, 30 minute delay before our junction didn't help, onto the A2 and another hold up at the Blackwall Tunnel. We had done our research and decided to park in Bromley-By-Bow for free on the streets, from here it was a right at the end of the High Street, cross the A12 intersection and then left down by a small industrial area and a walk through the Queen Elizabeth Park.\n\nImpressions: The stadium when walking through the park looks absolutely stunning lit up in the night, I presume during the day it would look quite bland and like a white elephant. The away section is awful, despite this being a modern stadium they didn't plan it well, the gap between fans in the upper and lower tiers is woeful and you could literally fit a London Bus in there! Home fans also have this problem but it ruins the atmosphere a bit, toilets are not football toilets, having only two separate urinals which you queue so much for to enter another queue... not well thought out!\n\nAtmosphere: The game was Chelsea's poorest display of the season, we played terrible and West Ham had their killer instinct when needed..Stewards need some sort of training and adjusting to their own ground, very confusing messages when conducting with away fans. Food is lovely! Best part of the day, atmosphere was excellent until about the 80th minute after that; No comment!\n\nAnything Else: We walked from Bromley-By-Bow to the ground and was greeted by quite a few coppers to say the least! One of them told me to do up and jacket and hide my Chelsea shirt... I knew it was high risk but it ended up being damn right dangerous, stewards were confused and had no clear instructions, probably still getting used to the stadium but they had no control."
