        "text": "West Ham boss David Moyes remains optimistic about his team's chances of qualifying for Europe next season, despite a 2-0 defeat to Bayer Leverkusen in the first leg of their Europa League quarter-final.\n\nThe Hammers' dreams of reaching the Champions League by winning the Europa League seem distant after falling to the Bundesliga outfit who remain unbeaten. However, Moyes is not ready to write off the tie ahead of the second leg at the London Stadium on Thursday.\n\nMeanwhile, West Ham will host Fulham in the Premier League on Sunday, with European qualification still very much within their grasp. Despite defending solidly for 83 minutes, the defeat in Germany was a bitter pill to swallow as they conceded two late goals.\n\n\"There is huge disappointment\" admitted Moyes. \"But we're incredibly proud of the players to be in a quarter-final of European football.\n\n\"The level they're playing against, you'll see this team (Leverkusen) in the Champions League next season. We've got to accept that. It was one of the toughest draws of the teams left, that is the way it goes.\n\n\"We've got a big chance in the second leg still and we have to pick ourselves up for the league. We have to find a way of being strong and solid and hopefully we can get everybody behind the players and give them the support they're going to need on Sunday.\"\n\nJarrod Bowen's hip injury will not be risked against Fulham, with hopes he will be fit for Thursday's match. Goalkeeper Alphonse Areola, defender Konstantinos Mavropanos and midfielder Kalvin Phillips are all doubts due to injuries.\n\nREAD MORE: Xabi Alonso responds to David Moyes' 'disgraceful' claim after West Ham Europa League defeat\n\nREAD MORE: David Moyes shares honest West Ham verdict after Bayer Leverkusen defeat\n\n\"We've got some concerns and a few injuries, but we need to get them back out and ready to go,\" added Moyes. We knew this was going to be a difficult period for us, especially with suspensions and injuries and we couldn't really afford them at this time, but unfortunately that is the way it has come around.\"\n\nEdson Alvarez is back in contention after sitting out in Leverkusen due to suspension, while Lucas Paqueta is set to feature before his upcoming ban in the second leg."
