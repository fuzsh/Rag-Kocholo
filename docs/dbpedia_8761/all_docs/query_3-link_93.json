The Bianconeri have been in talks with Nice for weeks to no avail.\n\nRead More: West Ham Announce Signing of World Cup Winner\n\nInstead, the Hammers have an “agreement now done” for a loan with an obligation to buy for £35 million. There is a sell-on clause in the contract and the suitors are trying to book a medical for Friday. However, they still need to wait for the “flawless” player’s approval, as he is reviewing the contract proposal.\n\nWest Ham’s Incredibly Strong Backline Can Take Them to Europe\n\nJulen Lopetegui’s side continue to bolster their backline. By the end of the transfer window, they could have an entirely new back-four. At right-back, they are trying to secure the signing of Aaron Wan-Bissaka from Manchester United. Meanwhile, they already have a new centre-back in Max Kilman, who has been reunited with his former manager. We could well see a new left-back join in the near future as well.\n\nRead More: West Ham Put ‘Serial Winner’ on Shortlist: ‘World-Class’ Player Would Bolster Defence\n\nFurthermore, there is a plethora of strong defensive-midfielders at the London Stadium, with Guido Rodriguez joining Tomas Soucek and Edson Alvarez. It’s unsurprising that this is the area of the pitch that the hierarchy are focused on strengthening: last season only Sheffield United, Burnley, and Luton Town conceded more times in the Premier League.\n\nThis new strong defence could propel the East London side to a European spot, especially given the strength of their dangerous attack."
