        "text": "Outlining his objectives for the upcoming 2024/25 season as West Ham United intensify preparations for the season’s start in August, the 23-year-old said his goal is to help the Hammers qualify for Europe again and challenge for the top six in the English Premier League.\n\nKudus starred for West Ham last season both in the Europa League and the Premier League, scoring incredible goals and entertaining fans with his quick feet.\n\nLooking ahead to his second season, the former Ajax star said, “Personally, I want to do better than I did last season with numbers and performances, but most importantly help the team get back into Europe and challenge for the top six. That’s what my personal goal is around, helping the team.”\n\nThe Right to Dream Academy graduate proved indispensable for the Hammers last season, featuring in 48 matches across all competitions. His impressive tally of 18 goals and seven assists underscored his pivotal role in the squad.\n\nKudus was crowned Europe’s top dribbler for the 2023/24 season, and he further won West Ham’s Goal of the Season accolade.\n\nHis breathtaking 70-yard solo effort against SC Freiburg in the UEFA Europa League round of 16 captured the imagination of fans worldwide."
