It was all too visible as he came out of the dressing room and then sat down in front of the media.\n\nArteta was thrilled.\n\nThose who speak of the exacting standards of winners might say that’s a bit much for a mere Champions League last-16 penalty shootout victory over a side Arsenal should be beating fairly easily, in the way this side have generally had their celebrations policed.\n\nThere was obviously much more to it than that. It wasn’t even that the club had reached the quarter-finals, either. It was that the team had made another crucial step, with this one admittedly a giant leap.\n\nAnalysis by Miguel Delaney:\n\nArsenal’s Champions League progress shows a crucial step is behind them\n\nThe Gunners beat Porto on penalties to reach the quarter-finals at the first attempt under Mikel Arteta\n\nLawrence Ostlere15 March 2024 17:02\n\n1710519519\n\nNews: Madrid complain to Uefa over ‘racist insults’ directed at Vincius Jr\n\nReal Madrid have filed a complaint with the Spanish legal authorities after “racist and hateful insults” appeared to be directed at their striker Vinicius Junior by Atletico Madrid and Barcelona fans this week.\n\nFootage on social media appeared to show Atletico fans chanting about Vinicius in a discriminatory way prior to their side’s Champions League last 16 match against Inter Milan on Wednesday.\n\nReal have now taken steps to report it to the Spanish authorities and allege there were similar chants from Barca fans before their match against Napoli on Tuesday.\n\n“Real Madrid has filed a complaint with the Attorney General’s Office against hate crimes and discrimination, for the racist and hateful insults directed towards our player Vinicius Junior in the vicinity of the Olympic Stadium of Montjuic and the Metropolitan Stadium of Madrid,” a statement from Los Blancos read.\n\n“Real Madrid is asking the Public Prosecutor’s Office to ask the security forces for the recordings in both locations in order to identify the perpetrators of these racist and hateful insults.\n\n“Real Madrid condemns these violent attacks of racism, discrimination and hatred that have been taking place, unfortunately repeatedly, against our player Vinicius Junior.\n\n“Our club will continue to work in defence of the values of football and sport, and will remain firm in its fight for zero tolerance in the face of such disgusting episodes as those that continue to occur in recent times.”\n\nLawrence Ostlere15 March 2024 16:18\n\n1710516172\n\nLiverpool’s route to the Europa League final\n\nLiverpool will face Atalanta in the Europa League quarter-finals after the draw on Friday.\n\nJurgen Klopp’s side, in his final season at Anfield, thrashed Sparta Prague 11-2 on aggregate in the last-16, following a 6-1 second-leg victory at Anfield on Thursday.\n\nThe Reds were drawn against Serie A side Atalanta on Friday in the last eight and will host the first-leg at Anfield.\n\nBut who will the Reds face in the semi-finals should they beat Atalanta?\n\nLiverpool’s route to Europa League Final after quarter-final draw\n\nJurgen Klopp’s side now know their potential journey to the Europa League final in Dublin on 22 May\n\nLawrence Ostlere15 March 2024 15:22\n\n1710514972\n\nWhy Bayern fans are banned from attending Arsenal quarter-final\n\nBayern Munich will not be allowed away fans at the Emirates when they take on Arsenal in the first leg of their Champions League quarter-final.\n\nArsenal will face the German side in the last-eight of the Champions League next month but Bayern fans have been banned from attending by Uefa.\n\nIt comes after Bayern supporters threw fireworks onto the pitch during their 3-0 win over Lazio in the last-16, which triggered a one-match ban.\n\nBayern had been fined 40,000 euros and hit with a suspended ban on away supporters after fans set off fireworks during their win at Copenhagen in the group stages in December.\n\nBayern accepted the punishment and confirmed they would not appeal against Uefa’s decision, describing the ban on away supporters as a “big blow”.\n\nLawrence Ostlere15 March 2024 15:02\n\n1710513655\n\nMan City’s route to Champions League final after quarter-final draw\n\nManchester City face Real Madrid once again in the Champions League as the holders look to defend their title at Wembley in June.\n\nThe teams have met in the semi-finals in the last two seasons, with City thrashing Real 4-0 at the Etihad last year on their way to winning their first European Cup in Istanbul.\n\nPep Guardiola’s side were knocked out by the Spanish side the year before, however, in an all-time classic tie.\n\nThis season’s quarter-finals will therefore be the third year in a row in which City have faced Real Madrid in the Champions League knockout stages.\n\nMan City’s route to Champions League final after quarter-final draw\n\nThis season’s quarter-finals be the third year in a row in which City have faced Real Madrid in the Champions League knockout stages\n\nKieran Jackson15 March 2024 14:40\n\nSubscribe to Independent Premium to bookmark this article\n\nWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?
