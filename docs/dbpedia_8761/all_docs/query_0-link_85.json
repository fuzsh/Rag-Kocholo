        "text": "Luton Town's relegation fate could be sealed Saturday as the team heads to East London looking to claim a crucial win against West Ham.\n\nWith the Hatters three points from safety after a run of four games without a win, boss Rob Edwards knows a defeat here will effectively send his side back down to the Championship after one season in the top flight.\n\nIt could be tears all round in Stratford, with Saturday's game marking outgoing West Ham boss David Moyes' final game in charge at home in front of the Hammers faithful.\n\nBelow, we'll outline the best live TV streaming services to use to watch the game as it happens wherever you are in the world.\n\nWest Ham United vs. Luton Town: When and where?\n\nWest Ham host Luton Town at London Stadium on Saturday, May 11. Kickoff is set for 3 p.m. BST local time, which is 10 a.m. ET or 7 a.m. PT in the US and Canada, and 2 a.m. AEST on Sunday, May 12, in Australia.\n\nHow to watch the West Ham vs. Luton game online from anywhere using a VPN\n\nIf you find yourself unable to view the game locally, you may need a different way to watch the game -- that's where using a VPN can come in handy. A VPN is also the best way to stop your ISP from throttling your speeds on game day by encrypting your traffic, and it's also a great idea if you're traveling and find yourself connected to a Wi-Fi network, and you want to add an extra layer of privacy for your devices and logins.\n\nWith a VPN, you're able to virtually change your location on your phone, tablet or laptop to get access to the game. So if your internet provider or mobile carrier has stuck you with an IP address that incorrectly shows your location in a blackout zone, a VPN can correct that problem by giving you an IP address in your correct, nonblackout area. Most VPNs, like our Editors' Choice, ExpressVPN, make it really easy to do this.\n\nUsing a VPN to watch or stream sports is legal in any country where VPNs are legal, including the US, UK and Canada, as long as you have a legitimate subscription to the service you're streaming. You should be sure your VPN is set up correctly to prevent leaks: Even where VPNs are legal, the streaming service may terminate the account of anyone it deems to be circumventing correctly applied blackout restrictions.\n\nLooking for other options? Be sure to check out some of the other great VPN deals taking place right now.\n\nLivestream West Ham vs. Luton in the US\n\nSaturday's West Ham vs. Luton match is streaming on USA Network, which you can access as part of your cable package or at the NBC Sports website with a valid login, and it can also be streamed via Sling TV and other more expensive streaming TV services.\n\nCan I livestream the West Ham vs. Luton game in the UK?\n\nNo broadcaster has the rights to show this game live in the UK, due to the traditional Saturday 3 p.m. kickoff blackout, which prohibits matches being shown in the region at that time to protect attendances throughout the English football pyramid.\n\nThat also means that if you're in the UK traveling for pleasure or for work, you're unlikely to be able to watch the game like you normally would at home, thanks to geo-blocking.\n\nThere is one option to get around this, however. By using a VPN, as explained above, you can set your location to a country where the match is being broadcast and go from there.\n\nLivestream the West Ham vs. Luton game in Canada\n\nIf you want to stream West Ham vs. Luton live in Canada, you'll need to subscribe to Fubo. The service has exclusive rights for this Premier League season.\n\nLivestream the West Ham vs. Luton game in Australia\n\nFootball fans down under can watch this EPL fixture on streaming service Optus Sport, which is showing every single Premier League game live in Australia this season.\n\nQuick tips for streaming the Premier League using a VPN"
