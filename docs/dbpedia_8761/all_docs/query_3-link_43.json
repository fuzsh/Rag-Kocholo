        "text": "West Ham are in a 5-horse race for a Premier League European spot and here’s how many points are likely needed to get the job done.\n\nThree seasons of European football on the bounce has been unprecedented territory for West Ham.\n\nAnd the Hammers can make more history by qualifying for a fourth consecutive season.\n\nThe damaging collapse in the 4-3 defeat at Newcastle has put that at risk, though.\n\nEspecially as the Magpies are one of the five clubs in the mix to take what is – at the moment – the last of Premier League’s European spots.\n\nHow many points West Ham need to qualify for Europe\n\nOf course if West Ham go on and win the Europa League they will qualify for the new-look Champions League next season.\n\nBut that will be a tall order with the competition’s second favourites and invincible German champions-in-waiting Bayer Leverkusen to come in the quarter-finals.\n\nMORE WEST HAM STORIES\n\nLiverpool’s Carabao Cup victory ensured European qualification will go down to seventh spot in the Premier League. Whether seventh will be a Europa League or Conference League place remains to be seen.\n\nBecause there is a chance the Euro spots could go down to eighth or even ninth place. Until that is confirmed by whoever wins the FA Cup and other European place permutations, though, we will focus on seventh.\n\nHammers supporters have loved their adventures over land and sea.\n\nBut this is how many points West Ham will likely need from the last 8 games to win the 5-horse race for Europe.\n\nAs things stand David Moyes’ side are up against Newcastle, Brighton, Wolves and Chelsea in the race for seventh.\n\nThe bad news for West Ham is that all of those sides have a game in hand on them. And Chelsea have two.\n\nHammers likely need four wins from last eight games\n\nShould they win those games in hand – they would all leapfrog West Ham, leaving us 11th.\n\nBut we have looked at each side’s remaining fixtures and predicted a realistic final points total for all five.\n\nThe result is that it looks like West Ham will need at least 12 points from their last eight games to seal seventh place.\n\nThat’s four wins. The bad news is four of West Ham’s last eight games are tough – against Spurs, Liverpool, Chelsea and Man City.\n\nHammers pip Newcastle?\n\nThe good news is that the other four are all winnable – against direct competitor Wolves, Fulham, Palace and Luton.\n\nIf West Ham can get 12 points it will leave them on 56 for the season. And we believe that should be just enough to take seventh spot based on what we predict the other four teams will garner between now and the final whistle on May 19th.\n\nShould it come down to goal difference, Newcastle will likely be in the strongest position of the five clubs with a plus 12 GD as things stand, seven more than next best Brighton.\n\nRemaining fixtures and predicted final points tallies and positions:\n\nWest Ham: Spurs (H), Wolves (A), Fulham (H), Palace (A), Liverpool (H), Chelsea (A), Luton (H), Man City (A). Current points and position: 44, 7th. Predicted total and final position: 56, 7th.\n\nNewcastle: Everton (H), Fulham (A), Spurs (H), Man United (A – TBD), Palace (A), Sheffield United (H), Burnley (A), Brighton (H), Brentford (A). Current points and position: 43, 8th. Predicted total and final position: 55, 8th.\n\nChelsea: Man United (H), Sheffield United (A), Everton (H), Brighton (A – TBD), Arsenal (A), Villa (A), West Ham (H), Forest (A), Bournemouth (H). Current points and position: 40, 11th. Predicted total and final position: 54, 9th.\n\nBrighton: Brentford (A), Arsenal (H), Burnley (A), Chelsea (H – TBD), Man City (H), Bournemouth (A), Villa (H), Newcastle (A), Man United (H). Current points and position: 42, 9th. Predicted total and final position: 53, 10th.\n\nWolves: Burnley (A), West Ham (H), Forest (A), Arsenal (H), Bouremouth (H), Luton (H), Man City (A), Palace (H), Liverpool (A). Current points and position: 41, 10th. Predicted total and final position: 53, 11th on GD.\n\nREAD ALSO\n\nMoyes blasts weak players and demands response against Spurs"
