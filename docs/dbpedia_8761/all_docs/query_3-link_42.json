But basically Premier League teams f***ed it this season and the extra places will now go to Italy and Germany.\n\nThe top four teams in the Premier League will thus qualify for the Champions League group stage. They will not play in qualifying. Nothing to see here.\n\nSo what about the other European competitions?\n\nEuropa League\n\nEngland gets two Europa League places. One belongs to the highest-placed finisher not in the Champions League. Of course, a league finish that appeared set to earn a Champions League place but now won’t can only be occupied by Tottenham and that is very correctly the case.\n\nThe other Europa spot goes to the winners of the FA Cup. It was widely expected Champions League-bound Manchester City would lift the trophy again, gifting that spot instead to sixth place in the league. But eighth-placed Manchester United stunned Pep Guardiola’s side at Wembley to book their Europa ticket alongside Spurs, dumping Chelsea into the…\n\nEuropa Conference League\n\nAs well as all the fizzy pop they can drink, the Carabao Cup winners also receive a place in the play-off stages for the Europa Conference League. Liverpool are in the Champions League and thus do not need the spot they secured after beating Chelsea, who take the place anyway – and the quite considerable FFP concerns – as it reverts to the highest Premier League finisher not otherwise in Europe.\n\nNewcastle needed a Manchester City FA Cup win to secure European football again, the poor scamps.\n\nMORE NEXT SEASON’S CHAMPIONS LEAGUE FORMAT\n\n👉 UEFA Champions League reforms: everything you need to know\n\n👉 Champions League reforms signal end of meritocracy"
