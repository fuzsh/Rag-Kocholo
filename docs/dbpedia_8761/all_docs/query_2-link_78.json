        "meta_description": "West Ham has been paying for goal scorers in recent years, only to be disappointed by their lack of productivity. S√©bastien Haller became the most expensive signing in the history of the Hammers exactly five years ago (with 50,000,000 euros paid to Eintracht), but he also turned out to be the biggest disappointment as he scored only ten goals in 48 Premier League matches. Three years later, Gianluca Scamacca was bought for almost 40,000,000, only to be sent back to Italy the following summer after scoring just three goals in 16 league games. This summer, West Ham decided to try again and has agreed on the signing of Niclas F√ºllkrug!üö®‚öíÔ∏è EXCLUSIVE | Total agreement between @BVB and @WestHam about a permanent deal of Niclas #F√ºllkrug ‚úîÔ∏è Last details on bonus payments will be clarified tonight. ‚ñ´Ô∏èTransfer fee: ‚Ç¨26m + ‚Ç¨4m add-ons‚ñ´Ô∏èContract: 2027 + 1 ‚ñ´Ô∏èUp to ‚Ç¨3m net per year in salary. 31 y/o striker‚Ä¶ pic.twitter.com/9prZBkKX1A‚Äî Florian Plettenberg (@Plettigoal) August 2, 2024 Reliable journalist Florian Plettenberg reports that the transfer is nearing completion, with the clubs agreeing on a fixed fee of 26,000,000 and an additional 4,000,000 in bonuses. The fine details of team and individual achievements required for the bonuses to be paid out will be negotiated, and F√ºllkrug is expected in London on a three-year contract (with an option to extend for another year) and a net salary of 3,000,000. However, he faces a significant challenge ‚Äì to erase the disappointing memories of Haller and Scamacca with his goal-scoring performance in his debut Premier League season, overcoming their inefficiency and lack of goals.The Hammers offer 38,000,000, interest and a midfielder for Villa's back-up strikerIt's clear that the German national team player will have a starting striker position in Julen Lopetegui's team. Last season, Jarrod Bowen often had to fill that role out of necessity, and for years before that, the Hammers relied on Michail Antonio and his strength up front. In East London, they hope that this time they haven't made a mistake with their choice of the number nine, as they have once again invested a significant amount of money.Dortmund furious at Moukoko's agent upon Villarreal interestSimply put, after the arrival of Serhou Guirassy from Stuttgart, F√ºllkrug became surplus to requirements at Westfalen. The management recently informed him that it would be best for him to find a team where he would be the main attacking option, as following the arrival of the Guinean striker, the Millionaires no longer viewed him that way. Therefore, a separation after just one year of cooperation was inevitable. There was no shortage of interest in the 31-year-old German from across Europe. Milan and Atletico Madrid were among those interested, but in the final third of his career, the striker from Hanover will have the chance to shine in the best league in Europe. Hopefully, it won't be d√©j√† vu in London.##NAJAVA_MECA_8251694##",
