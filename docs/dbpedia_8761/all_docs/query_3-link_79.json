        "text": "Factfile\n\nManager: David Moyes\n\nCurrent Position: 8th\n\nNickname: The Irons\n\nGround: London Stadium\n\nFounded: 1895 (129 years ago)\n\nWhat’s the story?\n\nWest Ham’s season has been a story of contrasts: Premier League and European progress amidst discontent from certain sections of supporters about the club’s style of play under David Moyes.\n\nMoyes can point to a fantastic track record, having guided West Ham to their first trophy in more than four decades last season in the Europa Conference League, with this their third straight campaign in European football.\n\nOn Thursday night they took on the impossible, aiming to become the first side in any competition to beat Xabi Alonso’s Bayer Leverkusen this season, with the newly-crowned German champions taking a two-goal lead into the match at the London Stadium.\n\nThey came very close, earning an early lead and pushing for a goal to take the tie into extra-time before conceding a late equaliser - but given the form of Alonso's side this season, there was no shame in narrowly exiting to such a side, and the reaction at the London Stadium told a similar story.\n\nThe fight is well and truly on for another season in European competition via the league route, with West Ham just two points behind Manchester United and Newcastle United in the fight for the Europa League places. Can Moyes secure another shot at continental glory next year?\n\nIf so, they will need to put their foot on the accelerator as the run-in commences in earnest – but with games against Liverpool and Manchester City still to come they could play a big role in the title race as well as that for the European places. Can they match Palace’s achievement and take points off them both?\n\nThe boss\n\nMoyes cemented his status as one of West Ham’s greatest managers with the Conference League triumph in Prague, and is battling to finish in the European places for the third time in four seasons. He is one of the longest-serving managers in the Premier League, having spent the last five years at the London Stadium.\n\nA three-time LMA Manager of the Year with Everton, he returned for a second spell with West Ham United in December 2019, the Irons deep in a relegation battle, steadily transforming their fortunes to reach heights many east London supporters might not have deemed possible upon his arrival.\n\nTurning the club's form around following Project Restart in 2019/20, Moyes' team retained Premier League status and, the following season, went on a remarkable run to finish sixth, securing European football with a club-record Premier League points tally.\n\nWhile the undoubted pinnacle since was last season's Conference League heroics, West Ham's first major silverware in 43 years, Moyes is targeting a European finish again this season, with only Arsène Wenger and Sir Alex Ferguson having managed more matches in the competition.\n\nBoot in both camps\n\nJames Tomkins came through the academy at West Ham, making his debut in 2008 and going on to play 243 times for the club before moving to Palace in 2016.\n\nDid you know?\n\nEver wondered where the name ‘West Ham’ comes from? Or, more specifically, the ‘Ham’ part? Who knew there were so many toponymy enthusiasts among us?\n\nInitially spelled ‘Hamme’, the land was granted by the fantastically named King Edgar to the even more fantastically named Ealdorman Athelstan in 958. The Old English word ‘Hamm’ translates as ‘a dry area of land between rivers and marshland’; lying between the Thames, the Lea and the Roding, it was a perfect name.\n\nIn 1186 the area was referred to as ‘Westhamma’, and so the name was born. Ironically, hundreds of years later it became one of the major manufacturing hubs for processed foods, earning it the 19th century nickname ‘London over the border’, and would, according to the Times, “make the once desolate parish of West Ham a manufacturing and commercial centre of the first importance and to bring upon it a teeming and an industrious population”.\n\nMatch details\n\nSunday, 21st April\n\n15:00 BST\n\nSelhurst Park\n\nLive audio commentary on Palace TV+"
