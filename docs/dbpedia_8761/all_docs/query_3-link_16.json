        "text": "James Ward-Prowse says playing in Europe with West Ham “means everything” after previously watching midweek matches “with a cup of tea and slippers on”.\n\nWard-Prowse got a taste of European competition during his 12 years at Southampton as the club made the UEFA Europa League group stage in 2016/17.\n\nBut his last few seasons with Saints were largely spent trying to help the club avoid relegation.\n\nPremier League\n\nCity down West Ham to clinch fourth consecutive Premier League title\n\n20/05/2024 at 10:05\n\nThey did go down last season and Ward-Prowse made the move to West Ham, who are in the Europa League group stage this season after winning the UEFA Conference League last year.\n\n“It means everything,” Ward-Prowse told TNT Sports about playing in Europe.\n\n“The last couple of years I would normally settle down with a cup of tea to watch these sorts of games with my slippers on. I remember thinking ‘I don’t want to be doing this anymore, I want to be there on the biggest stages, performing in the Europa League and beyond’.\n\n“To be here now walking out rather than watching on TV is a good step and one I want to continue.\n\n“You want to look back on your career and not have any regrets, knowing you did everything you did to be on those biggest stages.”\n\nWard-Prowse has settled in quickly at West Ham and has already become a key member of the side.\n\nHis goals and assists have helped the Hammers, who play Freiburg on Thursday evening live on TNT Sports, into seventh place in the Premier League table.\n\n“Improvement on the Premier League season is a must,” says Ward-Prowse about West Ham’s aims this season.\n\n“This is definitely a top-10 club and that is something we should be looking to aim towards.\n\n“The European success is something everyone enjoyed and craves now going forward, so there is no reason why we can’t make that step in the Europa League this year.\n\n“When you have a period of success like last year with the European trophy you feel an expectation almost like there’s another step to go. That can be a building block for another successful season.\n\nWest Ham United team captain Declan Rice (C), with team, lift the trophy after winning the Europa Conference Football League match between West Ham United and Fiorentina, at the Fortuna Arena in Prague, Czech Republic on June 7, 2023.\n\nImage credit: Getty Images\n\n“It’s a fantastic challenge and once you get that taste of success you want to build on that and go for even more.”\n\nKnown for his set-piece prowess, Ward-Prowse was recently compared to free-kick masters Juninho and Andre Pirlo by West Ham team-mates Vladimir Coufal.\n\nAsked about the comparisons, Ward-Prowse said: “I’ve not seen it [the interview] but I’ll take the compliments!\n\n“I think it’s nice to have people say stuff like that, especially team-mates who you play week in and week out with.”\n\n- - -\n\nTNT Sports presents the premium live sports rights previously carried by BT Sport including the Premier League, UEFA Champions League, UEFA Europa League, UEFA Conference League, Gallagher Premiership Rugby, Heineken Champions Cup, EPCR Challenge Cup, MotoGP, Cricket, UFC, Boxing and WWE.
