At the north end of the cemetery, several of the paths were excavated in 1960 to re-inter remains moved from the Old Jewish Cemetery in Hoxton Street.\n\nThree-fifths of the ground of this cemetery, opened in 1856 by the authorities of the New Synagogue, was subsequently conveyed to the Great Synagogue. Registers are held in the East Ham Cemetery office. West Ham is one of the few cemeteries maintaining a separate register of burial, distinct from the registers kept by the respective synagogues, which usually lack the essential information on the identity of the cemetery of burial. Also see Plashet, some old pictures listed there may have come from West Ham Cemetery.\n\nUPDATE: Source: JewishGen Digest: This cemetery is closed and needs special permission/arrangements to visit, so you can't just pop by.The online database is a wonderful facility, but it is limited in that you have to enter an exact name in your search for a person, or nothing will come up, so this is why you got little back.

It belongs to the Corporation. There are 136 Commonwealth military burials from the 1914-1918 war here; 30 are in the \"Soldiers' Circle,\" on which a War Cross is erected, with a Screen Wall bearing the names of those whose graves (in the plot or elsewhere in the cemetery) are not marked by headstones. 78 Commonwealth burials of the 1939-1945 war in various parts of the cemetery, a second Screen Wall bears the names of those whose graves are not marked by headstones.
