Our home at the London Stadium has a capacity of 60,000 making it one of the biggest club Stadia in the country however our tickets are the lowest priced for London based clubs in the Premier League, echoing objectives to create Affordable Family Football. In 2018, our Women's team gained a professional status for the very first time, jumping 2 divisions and competed in the Women's Super League (WSL), the premier division of women's football in England. After finishing a respectable 7th, the team enjoyed particular success in the FA Cup reaching the final of the competition, eventually being beaten by 2017 winners Manchester City. In April 2019, we opened our brand-new Academy facility based at Chadwell Heath which will help to bring through some of the very best talents in the area, the recent emergence of First Team Players Declan Rice and Ben Johnson are a testament to the work already being done at the Academy. On the business side, we are continuing to create a Stadium our supporters can call home, with the renaming of the Billy Bonds Stand and Claret and Blue pitch surrounding amongst the latest developments. Additionally, the Club is on target to achieve the Advanced Level of the Premier League’s Equality Standard, whilst also achieving the Disability Confident Leader status which highlights the club’s commitment to Equality and Diversity. The Club employees a constantly growing workforce of approximately 300 core staff and 500 Foundation and events staff, and is a truly unique place to work and we are always looking for talented individuals who will thrive in our ambitious organisation.\n\nWebsite\n\nhttp://www.whufc.com\n\nExternal link for West Ham United FC\n\nIndustry\n\nSpectator Sports\n\nCompany size\n\n201-500 employees\n\nHeadquarters\n\nLondon, Greater London\n\nType\n\nPublic Company\n\nFounded\n\n1895"
