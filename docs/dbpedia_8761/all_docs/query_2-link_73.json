        "text": "West Ham pride themselves on being “The Academy of Football.”\n\nTheir list of graduates is formidable but they have largely developed centre-backs and central midfielders: Frank Lampard, Rio and Anton Ferdinand, John Terry, Michael Carrick, Joe Cole, Mark Noble, Paul Ince, James Tomkins, Liam Ridgewell, Leon Britton and, most recently, Declan Rice.\n\nTony Cottee and Jermain Defoe make up a smaller pool of strikers produced by the east London club. Bobby Zamora also spent time in the West Ham academy but got released as a youngster before returning almost five years later after proving himself as a professional with Brighton.\n\nThis adds to the uniqueness of Divin Mubama.\n\nFollow live coverage of transfer deadline day\n\nMubama, who turns 19 in October, is set for a breakout season.\n\nWest Ham’s first-team coach Billy McKinlay said he was “really impressive for the first couple of weeks of pre-season” and it “has given us something to think about”.\n\nThe teenager scored in the first two pre-season games in Australia, against Perth Glory and Tottenham Hotspur. Both goals showed his threat at attacking crosses, a feature of West Ham’s attacking play — they had the third-most crosses in the Premier League last season — but his defensive tenacity started the sequence for the one against Perth.\n\nMubama and Jarrod Bowen are leading the press here, and both spot Andriano Lebib attempting to pass between them. The pair jump inside, intercept, and then West Ham attack down their right…\n\n…and manage to get in behind with a one-two:\n\nAt 6ft (183cm), Mubama offers physical presence but lacks an aerial reach against most centre-backs, who are taller than that. He compensates with smart positioning — often on the blindside of the central defender who is furthest from the crosser — and excellent height on his jumps.\n\nHere, he slides between centre-back and right-back to head in Daniel Chesters’ back-post cross:\n\nHis goal against Spurs three days later was another header, but this time at the near-post from a short corner, where he finds space between zonal markers Harry Kane and Pedro Porro and flicks the ball over goalkeeper Guglielmo Vicario, into the far corner:\n\nMubama became West Ham’s youngest first-team scorer (at 18 years, four months and 19 days) since Freddie Sears in 2008 with his first senior goal in March, against AEK Larnaca in the Europa Conference League round of 16.\n\nIt’s another one-touch finish from a set piece, but a particularly cute left-footed flick to divert Vladimir Coufal’s header in from an outswinging corner. Mubama positioned himself right on the goalkeeper as the corner came in:\n\nMubama does not get credited with this one — officially an own goal by centre-back Joyskim Dawa — but his back-post movement between centre-back and full-back to attack crosses was on show in the 3-0 group-stage away win over FCSB (the Romanian club formerly called Steaua Bucharest) in Europe last November. He met Coufal’s cross and headed it back across goal, and the ball deflected in off Dawa:\n\nThe Europa Conference League was not the only trophy Mubama lifted last season.\n\nHe was also the talisman in West Ham’s Youth Cup victory (the under-18s equivalent of the FA Cup), the first time they have won that tournament since 1999.\n\nMubama was the Youth Cup’s top scorer (eight) and, despite not scoring in the final, his hold-up play was pivotal in the first two goals that night against Arsenal at the Emirates Stadium.\n\nHis semi-final hat-trick against Southampton at the London Stadium was scored entirely with his dominant left foot which, coupled with the variety of finishes, makes him similar to Zamora. The first of his three was a one-touch near-post finish from a cross from the right. He accelerated onto a through ball after a high turnover for the second, poking past the goalkeeper, and completed the hat-trick with a rebound finish late on.\n\nHe was head and shoulders above his competition at youth level last season, scoring five goals in as many appearances in the under-18s Premier League before making the permanent jump to under-21s football in Premier League 2, where 13 in 20 appearances saw him finish as second-top scorer behind Manchester City’s Carlos Borges. Mubama’s total included goals in eight consecutive games when that competition resumed after the World Cup break.\n\nGO DEEPER\n\nThe making of West Ham's Divin Mubama: 'He was always streets ahead of everyone'\n\nLocally-born Mubama was voted West Ham’s young player of the season and across all youth competitions played just over 2,700 minutes in 33 appearances. His return of 26 goals and four assists — a rate of 103 minutes per goal — was phenomenal.\n\nHad West Ham not been battling relegation for most of the season, which led to the January acquisition of former England striker Danny Ings, Mubama might have had more frequent and desirable first-team opportunities.\n\nHigher expectations in the league this time around, plus a Europa League group-stage campaign, should prove a more conducive environment for his development.\n\nBut the teenager brings an awful lot more than just goals.\n\n“Divin does deserve a mention because he makes us different,” said West Ham manager David Moyes last season. “He makes us a completely different side with his running, his pressure and the work he does off the ball for the team, and we needed it.”\n\nBowen echoed this in an interview after that Larnaca game, where Mubama scored his first senior goal: ”Even little things, like pressing the goalkeeper and always putting people under pressure — he got booked for chasing after him!”\n\nBelow are two examples from pre-season, against Bayer Leverkusen and then Perth, of Mubama harassing the right centre-back into a loose pass. He presses with intensity but does so smartly, ensuring he has first blocked off central passing lanes and bending his runs to keep them closed.\n\nWhile his build is entirely different to that of Defoe, his tenacity in badgering opponents and, in possession, channel chasing, is similar.\n\nAt senior level, Mubama plays a lot less to feet instead, as a central No 9 dropping in, making plenty of diagonal runs into wide areas and stretching the defence with runs in behind. Often he does receive the ball, but these can be valuable selfless runs, too, pinning the opposition deeper to make space for West Ham’s midfielders and wingers:\n\nOut wide, Mubama uses his body effectively when duelling against opponents to protect the ball, and he is capable of attacking as a lone forward up against two centre-backs — something West Ham regularly ask of Michail Antonio.\n\n“How David Moyes plays is more like, if you’re up front, you’re dealing with scraps and you’ve got to be more of a fighter,” said Antonio in May.\n\nHe was explaining why Gianluca Scamacca, an Italy international signed from Sassuolo for £35million in July 2022 and sold to their fellow Italians Atalanta this month, struggled to fit into the West Ham attack, but it also tallies pretty perfectly with Mubama’s assessment of himself in pre-season.\n\n“I’m being asked to keep hold of the ball and keep getting the team higher up the pitch,” he said after a 3-1 defeat against French club Rennes.\n\n“It’s about working hard and sometimes doing the dirty work, but I think that’s stuff I have in my game already. It’s nothing new, but I can get better at it too.”\n\n(Top photo: Marc Atkins – Getty Images; design: Sam Richardson)"
