        "text": "Guest post by Berlin Hammer\n\nBayer Leverkusen resume their quest for a continental treble in Thursday’s UEFA Europa League quarter-final first leg, facing off against West Ham United. Despite Leverkusen’s impressive unbeaten streak this season, West Ham, who clinched last season’s Europa Conference League title, are not to be underestimated.\n\nLeverkusen currently holds a German record with 42 consecutive games without defeat across all competitions. Florian Wirtz leads the team with seven goal involvements (three goals, four assists) in this season’s Europa League. This marks Bayer’s second consecutive appearance in the Europa League quarter-finals, having reached the semi-finals in the 2022/23 season. The club is participating in the Europa League for the sixth consecutive campaign.\n\nUnder Alonso’s leadership, Leverkusen achieved a flawless group stage record before progressing to the last 16, where they eliminated Qarabağ in a thrilling encounter. Additionally, Leverkusen has maintained an unbeaten streak of seven European games at the Bay Arena, winning five and drawing two.\n\nBut West Ham should not be discounted. There is a confidence bordering on cockiness in Germany about this fixture. The Hammers Conference League triumph is a definite talking point although most believe Bayer will go through.\n\nProbable Line-up:\n\nLeverkusen: Kovář – Tapsoba, Tah (c), Hincapié – Frimpong, Xhaka, Andrich, Grimaldo – Adli, Wirtz – Schick"
