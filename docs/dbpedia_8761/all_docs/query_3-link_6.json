        "text": "The Premier League season is almost over, and the race for a place in Europe is reaching its climax.\n\nWe take a look at who is in contention to qualify for the Champions League, Europa League and Europa Conference League, how the FA Cup could affect it and what impact an English team winning a European trophy could have.\n\n- How VAR has affected every Premier League club\n\nThis page will be updated through the remainder of the season as the permutations develop.\n\nHow many teams qualify for Europe?\n\nThe maximum that can qualify from domestic performance in the Premier League -- so either by league position or by winning the FA Cup or Carabao Cup -- is seven.\n\nHowever, the places reserved for European titleholders are separate if a team does not qualify domestically. Therefore, it is technically possible, though unlikely, for the Premier League to have 10 teams in Europe -- the seven domestic qualifiers plus the winners of the Champions League, Europa League and Europa Conference League if they are outside the European places.\n\nWith West Ham United in final of the Europa Conference League and unable to finish in the European places in the Premier League, it is possible that eight English teams could take part next season.\n\nWhich Premier League places will qualify?\n\nAt the start of the season, the top four in the Premier League qualify for the Champions League, while fifth place and the FA Cup winners enter the Europa League. The winners of the Carabao Cup qualify for the Europa Conference League.\n\nManchester United won the Carabao Cup, so they were guaranteed (at minimum) a place in the Europa Conference League. However, Manchester United will play Manchester City in the FA Cup final, and both clubs are sure to finish in the top six of the Premier League. This means that the places reserved for the domestic cups transfer to the league.\n\nAllocation as it stands:\n\nChampions League: Arsenal, Manchester City, Manchester United, Newcastle United\n\nEuropa League: Liverpool, Brighton & Hove Albion\n\nEuropa Conference League: Aston Villa\n\nHow can the Premier League ever have 10 teams in Europe?\n\nThe three European titleholders would need to finish outside the European places in the Premier League.\n\nThis will definitely be the case with West Ham this season, but with only Manchester City left in the Champions League, and no representative in the Europa League, there is no possibility of 10 teams anymore.\n\nHow does qualification work if a team wins a European trophy?\n\nThere are four overriding principles:\n\n- The winners of a European competition have the automatic right to European football the following season.\n\n- A team has the right to play in the highest-ranked competition they qualify for.\n\n- One Premier League team cannot be adversely affected by another's success in Europe.\n\n- A Premier League team cannot get a place because of another's success in Europe.\n\nIf a team wins the Champions League or the Europa League:\n\n- They are guaranteed to play in the Champions League wherever they finish in the Premier League.\n\nIf a team wins the Europa Conference League:\n\n- They will play in the Europa League unless they finish in the top four -- then they will play in the Champions League.\n\nWhat will happen to Man United's Carabao Cup place?\n\nMan United are now guaranteed to finish in the top four. That means the UECL place for the Carabao Cup goes to seventh, Aston Villa.\n\nIf Man United finish in the top four:\n\nChampions League: Arsenal, Manchester City, Newcastle, Manchester United\n\nEuropa League: Liverpool, Brighton & Hove Albion\n\nEuropa Conference League: Aston Villa\n\nSo how does the FA Cup affect the European places?\n\nManchester City will play Manchester United in the final on June 3. (stream live on ESPN+, U.S. only).\n\nThe effect on the European places works along the same lines as Man United's Carabao Cup place: if the FA Cup winners qualify for Champions League or the Europa League via the league, the Europa League place for winning the FA Cup transfers to the league.\n\nBoth Manchester clubs will finish in the top six, so this is simple.\n\nIf Man City or Man United win the FA Cup:\n\nChampions League: Arsenal, Manchester City, Manchester United, Newcastle\n\nEuropa League: Liverpool, Brighton & Hove Albion\n\nEuropa Conference League: Aston Villa\n\nHow does seventh qualify for Europe by league position?\n\nThis is only the case if Manchester United and the winners of the FA Cup finish in the top six of the Premier League. This is now certain.\n\nChampions League: Arsenal, Manchester City, Manchester United, Newcastle\n\nEuropa League: Liverpool, Brighton & Hove Albion\n\nEuropa Conference League: Aston Villa\n\nThe performance of clubs in Europe cannot increase the number of places allocated to final places in the Premier League table.\n\nCan eighth in the Premier League qualify for Europe?\n\nIt is impossible for eighth to qualify by league position. This team must win a domestic cup competition or a European title to play in Europe the following season.\n\nWhat if Man City win the Champions League?\n\nMan City will play Real Madrid in the final of the Champions League on June 10. If City win it, this will have no effect on the Premier League as Man City will finish in the top four. There is no \"drop down\" of places to give a fifth Champions League spot.\n\nThe position in the group stage for the Champions League titleholders is left vacant. This isn't filled by giving another team a place, the qualifying rounds are rebalanced with clubs effectively receiving byes.\n\nOrdinarily, the champions of the country ranked 11th in the UEFA coefficient table at the end of the 2021-22 season -- Serbia -- would go direct to the Champions League group stage, rather than having to qualify. However, Russia is ranked 10th and its clubs remain excluded from European competition. That means the Serbian champions are already guaranteed a place in the group stage.\n\nSo, if Man City win the Champions League, it will be the champions of the 12th-ranked country who are given a place in the group stage. This just so happens to be Ukraine.\n\nWhat if West Ham win the Europa Conference League?\n\nIf West Ham win the final on May 31 they will earn a place in next season's Europa League.\n\nAs West Ham will not qualify for Europe domestically, England would have eight teams in Europe next season.\n\nChampions League: Arsenal, Manchester City, Manchester United, Newcastle\n\nEuropa League: Liverpool, Brighton & Hove Albion, West Ham\n\nEuropa Conference League: Aston Villa\n\nWhat if more than one English team wins a European trophy?\n\nIn principle, each scenario remains as above, applied in the same way individually to each competition.\n\nSo if Man City win the UCL and also finish in the top four, the allocation to the Premier League is unaltered.\n\nAs West Ham cannot qualify domestically, winning the Europa Conference League will add an eighth place -- for the Hammers as titleholders -- regardless of how any other team may perform.\n\nCan fourth place miss out on the Champions League?\n\nIt would only be possible if the winners of the Champions League and the winners of the Europa League both finished outside the Premier League's top four.\n\nIf that were to happen, fourth place would play in the Europa League as there's a maximum of five teams from one country in the Champions League.\n\nIn that situation, as an example:\n\nChampions League: 1, 2, 3, Champions League winners, Europa League winners\n\nEuropa League: 4, FA Cup winners\n\nEuropa Conference League: 6\n\nAs the Premier League no longer has a team in the Europa League, it cannot happen."
