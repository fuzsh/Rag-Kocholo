West Ham is a district in the eastern part of London.[1] West Ham United Football Club, a Muggle sports team, is named after this area.[1]

History[]

Dean Thomas, a half-blood wizard raised in an all-Muggle household, was a fan of the club, and hung a poster of them in his dormitory at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Ron Weasley, however, couldn't understand what was exciting about a sport with only one ball where nobody flies.
