It's the birthday of cartoonist Gary Larson, born in Tacoma, Washington in 1950. His cartoon The Far Side ran from 1980 to 1995 and ultimately appeared in more than 900 newspapers.

He retired by his own choice in 1995. He has said that one of his future goals in life is to own a restaurant that serves only cereal.
