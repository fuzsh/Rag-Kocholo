        "text": "Gary Arthur Larson, 81, of Moorhead, Minnesota passed away on July 24th, 2024. He passed in the comfort of his home under the care of Hospice while surrounded by his family and loved ones.\n\nGary was born February 18th, 1943, on his family's farm in Binford, ND. He was born the fourth of five children, to Arthur and Verna Larson. After his father suffered a farming accident, Gary and his family moved to Valley City in time for Gary to start 2nd grade. The family remained in Valley City for the rest of Gary's education, and he graduated from Valley City College Elementary and High School in 1961. While in high school, Gary was a student athlete who competed on the wrestling team. He also worked at the Valley City Market where he gained an appreciation and understanding of the meat cutting industry which continued after his graduation from high school.\n\nWhile working near Valley City, Gary developed a deep love and admiration for horses. One of his favorite breeds of horse was the appaloosa. One of his favorite stories to tell family, friends, and grandchildren, involved one of his appaloosa stallions named Dondee, as the horse would ride in the back of his pickup truck because Gary didn't own a horse trailer at the time. During this time in his life, Gary also decided to serve his country which led him to join the Army Reserve in 1964 where he served as a cook and baker at Fort Leonard Wood in Missouri. Gary was honorably discharged from his service in November of 1970.\n\nWhile working at the Super Value grocery store in Valley City, Gary met the love of his life Barbara Byberg. Shortly after seeing her in the store, he mustered up the courage to knock on her family's door and ask her out, which luckily worked out in his favor. The two were married on April 9th, 1966, and celebrated 58 years of marriage this year. While living in Langdon, ND, Gary became a father after Barbara gave birth to their first son Michael. After relocating to Moorhead, Minnesota in 1971 he became the father of two more children, a son Kevin, and a daughter Christine.\n\nIn 1976, Gary decided to pursue a dream of his, to support his family with his artwork. Gary started woodcarving in high school, making ducks and other waterfowl. He eventually grew to carve many different figures, including Santas, cowboys, Native Americans, Vikings, animals, and western figures, among many other carvings. He began teaching woodcarving classes to adults and children and went to many shows to sell his artwork. He would travel throughout the upper midwest teaching his practice to others. In the mid-80's he opened The Wood Gallery in the Holiday Mall in Moorhead, selling carvings and supplies while teaching classes. In 1989 his dedication to his art paid off when he won First Prize at the National Woodcarvers Showcase in Branson, Missouri for his Santa carvings. He continued on making carvings, and teaching others his craft until he retired in 1997.\n\nHis retirement was filled by his family, where he served as a caretaker for his 6 grandchildren at his home in Moorhead. He filled their after school time with playtime, westerns, music, stories of horses, and lefse. Lots and lots of lefse. He passed down his love of cooking, art, and horses to his children and grandchildren during the time he spent with them. He passed his love for horses to his granddaughter Kenzie. He loved seeing her ride at lessons and competitions and was so proud when she bought a horse of her very own.\n\nGary lived his life to the fullest, and spread his love and joy of life to those around him including his friends and family.\n\nGary is survived by his wife Barbara, his children, Michael, Kevin, and Christine (Matthew) Myrvold, as well as his grandchildren, Keith, Kamden, Nathan, Kenzie, Colt, and Chase. Gary is preceded in death by his father Arthur, mother Verna, sister Gladys Hunter, and brothers Robert, Roger and Stanley Larson.\n\nA memorial service will be held on Wednesday, July 31, 2024, at 11:00 AM with a visitation one hour before the service at Wright Funeral Home, Moorhead, MN."
