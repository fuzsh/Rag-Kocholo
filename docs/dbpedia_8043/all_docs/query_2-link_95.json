        "text": "GARY LARSON and his closest friends agree. If you want to understand the man -- the comic genius, the author of the blackly buoyant and sorely missed ''Far Side'' comic strip, and a cartoonist so revered among scientists that they have named a louse and a butterfly after him -- then look at his work.\n\nSo let's skip the ahems, and start with a Far Side sampler, a few quick drill holes into Mr. Larson's sanctum delirium:\n\nA scientist is standing on a podium, holding a duck. All the scientists in the audience also are holding ducks, save for one man, whose eyes are wide open in horror. The caption reads: ''Suddenly, Professor Liebowitz realizes he has come to the seminar without his duck.''\n\nA woman is pushing a vacuum cleaner down a forest road and looking around nervously. The caption: ''The woods were dark and foreboding, and Alice sensed that sinister eyes were watching her every step. Worst of all, she knew that Nature abhorred a vacuum.''\n\nA group of the damned are milling around the lobby to Hell, drinking coffee from an urn as though at a company reception. Devils surround them; flames lick through the door. One grumbles to another: ''Oh man! The coffee's cold! They thought of everything!''\n\nGary Larson, too, has thought of everything, up, behind and athwart nature's mad phylogeny; and he has drawn everything, and he has put himself into the heads of all his creatures, including amoeba, which have no heads. And since he stopped doing his ''Far Side'' strip in 1995, he has left his tens of millions of fans in hell, where the coffee is always cold, and the bagels are always onion, because there is no Gary Larson.\n\nNow, Mr. Larson is among us again, not as a syndicated cartoonist, but as a contemporary fabulist, a sort of green Gary Grimm who sides with the trolls and dryads. He has a new book out called, ''There's a Hair in My Dirt: A Worm's Story (HarperCollins),'' a vividly illustrated narrative about a Father Worm, a Mother Worm, a sullen Son Worm, and Harriet -- a blundering Panglossia with a tiara and blonde bouffant, who thinks nature is a Teletubby playground designed to enchant her. She serenades the cute, bulldozes over the creepy, and pays for her naivete with the worst sort of hair day. And all around her real life goes on: a firefly ''flashes'' with a flick of his trench coat, a bear studies a ''Field Guide to the Humans'' (''Mushroomer: Usually seen in spring and summer. Shy, secretive, always looking down. Good eating.'')\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
