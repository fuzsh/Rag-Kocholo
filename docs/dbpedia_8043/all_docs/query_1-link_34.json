        "text": "December 8, 2015\n\nThe Far Side by Gary Larson was one of the two comic strips I've loved most (the other being Calvin & Hobbes). In my opinion, Larson was a twisted genius. I had cut his one-panel comics out of the newspaper on a regular basis. They were taped and tacked to my bulletin board, walls, refrigerator, etc. Then I could look my favorites for a chuckle – 100 times I could look at the same comic and still laugh.\n\nI was really bummed when Larson announced retiring The Far Side in 1995. But to his credit, he thought the series was getting repetitive and did not want to enter what he called the \"Graveyard of Mediocre Cartoons.\"\n\nThe Far Side Gallery 4 is one of many book collections showcasing his cartoons. It includes 150+ pages of monsters, mad scientists, four-eyed kids, goofy wildlife and a foreword by Robin Williams. I found it at a local thrift shop, and snapped it up. Overall, I give The Far Side 5-stars, but this book does not typify Larson’s incredible humor. It did transport me back in time. And, there were a few favs in there.\n\nOctober 4, 2014\n\nThere are a number of clever yet simple (as in pen and ink) cartoonists out there today who I think can capture on one small box the simplicity of life, its absurdity and pass a humours twist on it, without being vulgar, demeaning or repetitive. The far side (along with in my view Dilburt and Calvin and Hobbs) is one of the masters of this and as such is a joy to read. The book has a lot to get through over 160 pages with on average 4 images a page, this is a book you cannot wade through but to dip in to when time allows.\n\nI know this is not my usual fair however sometimes a change is good and since I have been trying to rearrange my library I stumbled across it and though why not give it a go.\n\nNovember 24, 2009\n\nWho knew cows could be so funny...and sneaky, not to mention, dogs, cats and so on. The Far Side is probably a never to be repeated comic that stands as one of the few unique examples of what cartoons can be. These may not be for everybody, but try them. If you haven't been introduced to these you'll thank me (or whoever introduced you).\n\nAugust 1, 2012\n\nLooking back on these years after Ive last taken a look at them, I find them that much more poignant and hilarious. Many of them were lost on me in my youth and now, knowing more, are even funnier than the first time around. Its always good to go back and take a look at things like this, even if only to remind yourself that life shouldnt be taken too seriously.\n\nDecember 29, 2018\n\nWhat, no Scientists?\n\n29 December 2018 – Adelaide\n\nI probably should open this review with a Far Side cartoon, as is probably appropriate in the circumstances, though as it turns out Gary Larson really doesn’t like his cartoons appearing on the internet, so instead of posting it on Goodreads, I’ll just provide a link.\n\nIt is pretty clear that in the world of the Far Side, God is God, or at least the lovely old man that we all picture him to be, and hell is hell, with cold coffee and demons and devils making fun of us and getting us to do silly things. In fact, Gary Larson’s hell is a particularly unpleasant place, well at least for the humans that end up there, and it certainly isn’t portrayed as the type of place that sounds to be much more fun that heaven, even though Gary Larson’s heaven, once again, is the heaven that we probably all picture heaven to be, you know clouds and all that.\n\nIt was a bit of a shame that there were no scientist jokes in this particular volume, but that probably has something to do with the collections that were included. Still, the scientist jokes were actually particularly amusing, namely because we picture scientists as being very serious people, working on very serious projects, yet Larson pictures them as, well, just normal people like everybody else, who laugh, joke, and play tricks on each other (though of course some of these tricks are probably the type of tricks that might actually find yourself on the wrong side of the unemployment queue, or in the middle of a smoking crater).\n\nYet his animals are particularly impressive, especially since, like the scientists, he pulls aside the curtains to show us a world that we rarely see – in a way animals are simply living their lives just like us, getting jealous over who they are seeing, wandering into the wrong bar, throwing cocktail parties, and even sitting in the lounge reading the newspapers. Yet there are two things that stand out – each of them have their own little eccentricities, or the true reality of their world is being purposely hidden from us, namely because we, humans, really don’t deserve to see this wonderful world. This is why, with the cows, there is always a lookout for a car, so that they can quickly end their cocktail party, and go back to appearing to chomp grass in the way that us humans have witnessed them doing throughout the ages.\n\nWell, as I started with a cartoon, I probably should finish off with one as well (or at least a link to one).\n\nMarch 24, 2016\n\nA bit inappropriate, but extremely funny. kind of like family guy ;)\n\nThis entire review has been hidden because of spoilers.\n\nOctober 4, 2011\n\nMy trek to The Far Side and back is finished for now. I've read through all the galleries... I want to read the 10th anniversary edition. That looked pretty sweet.\n\nI love... LOVE Gary Larson. Seriously, what's that guy doing these days? I bet he's accumulating mountains of Far Side water colors in his basement... one of a white whale yukking it up with Ahab and a giant squid. One of Pluto making some obscene gesture at the other \"planets.\" And there definitely have to be cows and cavemen. Possibly cave-cows.\n\nOne of the benefits in reading every word in a book is that I come across stuff like this: \"No part of this book may be used or reproduced in any manner whatsoever without written permission except in the case of reprints in the context of reviews.\" That was written in Galleries 1, 2, and 4... I'm not sure why it wasn't in 3, but it wasn't there... In my reviews of the previous 3 galleries, I described my favorite Far Sides. Alas, I just don't do them justice. A picture is worth a thousand words, or in Gary Larson's case - far more.\n\nTime travel fascinates me, but I'd also be interested in observing how the views of time travel have changed with time. This is why Cowboys and Aliens could have been so successful. (From what I hear, it wasn't worth it... I still want to see for myself.)\n\nAnyway, thank you Far Side. I'll be back sooner this time, I promise.\n\nMarch 28, 2020\n\nA lot of these comics were a repeat from Wiener Dog Art, which I really didn't like. If I didn't like them the first time around, I liked them even less the second.\n\nMay 27, 2021\n\nThis collection contains Larson's usual mix of brilliant gags, good gags, pedestrian gags, and gags that make me roll my eyes. Fortunately, there are more of the first two than the latter.\n\nNovember 23, 2023\n\nSquares and rectangles of the Far Side comic are spread out to give you a laugh. Far Side is known for its absurdist look at animals, social situations, ironic juxtapositions. This is an old school comic, so some of the references won't be understood to newbies.\n\nSeptember 25, 2016\n\nRuth saw that I was reading a graphic novel, so she insisted on finding this book for me to read.\n\nJuly 1, 2021\n\n5 out of 10\n\nI really enjoy the Far Side comics. It's always nice to see what creativity you can see in a one-panel comic. This collection wasn't as good as some of the other collections, but it still gave me a few laughs. This collection was definitely a little more inappropriate than I'd like it to be, and some of the material was quite boring. I enjoyed some of the other Far Side collections a lot more than this one. There is some decent material in the collection, but you have to comb through some boring material to get to it.\n\nJune 8, 2017\n\nWhen I was 12 years old, I picked this book up at the W&M campus bookstore in Colonial Williamsburgs on a school trip. I remember reading it everyday for months after. I never realized until I was much older how much it actually steered me towards my love for comedy and the arts. I still have the book and enjoy reading it on a nice summer morning on my porch. Just something about the way Gary Larson creates his cartoons that is unlike anything else. Clever, funny and just all-around enjoyable.\n\nJuly 13, 2020\n\nCan’t review. Won’t review. I own every Larson book available. He was the king.\n\nSeptember 20, 2012\n\nThis book is hilarious!!! I've read it at least three times!\n\nMarch 4, 2024\n\nThis is the fourth collection of Far Side comics. This collection covers Wiener Dog Art, Unnatural Selections, and Wildlife Preserves which were released from 1990-1992. The Far Side comics are a masterclass is bizarre and surreal humor. If you're not a fan of its certain type of strange humor then you're obviously not going to like this type of work.\n\nThe Far Side Gallery 4 is just as enjoyable as many of the previous collections. What makes this collection stand out is the inclusion of some colored pages as well. As one who really does enjoy color I really enjoyed the addition of these. It also seemed like some of the art both color and black and white would be done in a different style which looked really good.\n\nI have still really been enjoyed the collection. It maybe didn't include as many Far Side panels that I had seen before, but they were still enjoyable, funny, and strange as previous Far Side collections. Which is all you can really ask for.\n\nApril 5, 2021\n\nMore hilarity, more fun, and many things surprisingly still relevant / more relevant than ever! Plus there are still some that I definitely didn't understand or fully appreciate until being older and learning more. Larson's work just hits on so many levels, and probably even more that only scientists, farmers, or those who just know more random facts will understand. I realized that when there was a joke I didn't laugh at, it was because I either knew it to well, or have seen it done somewhere else. Which is an even better testament to the cartoons, because I could also appreciate that it WAS funny before. Every frame is a classic, and the forward here from Robin Williams is something to treasure.\n\nJune 26, 2021\n\nThe fourth gallery collection of Larson's comic strip. This volume collects his books Wildlife Preserves, Wiener Dog Art, and Unnatural Selections. Robin Williams provides a short foreword for this one, and as he writes, Larson is \"the best of a weird breed.\" Larson certainly proves that in this series. Two of my favorites in this volume are the primitive think tanks and the vaccination man, which I think may be just what we need to get more people vaccinated for COVID-19. Larson may have been a visionary with that. As always, the comics have that nice blend of the bizarre and humorous, and for me, they make for nice comfort reading. Another volume I really liked.\n\nJuly 2, 2024\n\nI've been seeing Far Side comics from time to time on social media, so why not check them out in a book form. Especially since the book had just stumbled into my possession.\n\nSure enough, it's plenty amusing. And not all that dated, considering that it's over three decades old. Larson definitely has a talent for the whimsy, be it foibles of people or peculiarities of animals.\n\nThe full color comics were especially nice.\n\nThese comics and their inimitable style can be recognized immediately as Larson's and enjoyed easily by a wide audience. Fun.\n\nJune 21, 2023\n\nIn terms of percentages, I would say it was 75% simple, fun jokes I enjoyed, 5% jokes I didn’t understand, and 20% jokes that were either racist or made about subjects I don’t think should be joked about. It’s not a bad ratio, but the small group of stinkers did take the wind out of my sails every once in a while. Of the funny ones, only a small number really made me laugh, but most of them earned at least a small smile. Overall, it was a fair collection.\n\nApril 19, 2019\n\nAs a fan of Gary Larson's success in connecting clever images with commentary, I knew I would give this collection of his work five stars. His ability to match diverse and clever images with clever language is extraordinary. His ability to create comedy from history, literature, biology, and other themes is remarkable. It takes only an hour to read the book and it is time well spent.\n\nDecember 12, 2019\n\nMore Far Side goodness. This time with a very interesting (and in retrospect sad) forward by Robin Williams. (Sad because he discusses how he looks forward to a world envisioned by Gary Larson. This collection came out in 1993.)\n\nThere was several classics in this one, and this is the first paperback collection to use some of his colored cartoons.\n\nNovember 20, 2016\n\nI haven't read this book in years. But every time I do it cracks me up. One of the best cartoons ever published."
