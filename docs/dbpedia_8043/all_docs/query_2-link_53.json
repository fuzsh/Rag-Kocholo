        "text": "Who is Gary Larson?\n\nAmerican cartoonist Gary Larson was born on August 14, 1950 in Tacoma, Washington USA. Larson loved to draw when he was young, but never studied art other than in required classes in primary and middle school, nor did he ever consider being a cartoonist. His love was science, which ultimately became a frequent topic in this cartoon panel The Far Side. Larson later had the distinction of having the scientific community name a biting louse and a butterfly after him.\n\nLarson has published 22 The Far Side books including 15 collections, five anthologies and one retrospective, each of which has made it to The New York Times Best Seller List. Thirty-one million books have been sold worldwide, and have been translated into every major language. Current merchandising of The Far Side include everyday and seasonal greeting cards, mugs, calendars, t-shirts and a line of personal organizer products.\n\nIn 1994, Larson completed his first animated film, \"Gary Larson's Tales From The Far Side,\" which aired in the US as a Halloween Special on the CBS network and was also awarded the Grand Prix at the 1995 Annecy International Animated Film Festival in Annecy, France. In 1997, Larson's second animated film \"Gary Larson's Tales From The Far Side II\" premiered in Europe at the 1997 Venice International Film Festival and in the United States at the Telluride Film Festival.\n\nLarson attributes much of his success to the caffeine in the numerous cups of coffee he drinks daily as well as the enlightening (endarkening?) time his older brother compelled him to spend in the basement as a child. He now lives above ground in Seattle, Washington USA.\n\nWhat is the e-mail address of Gary Larson?\n\nUnfortunately, Gary Larson does not have an official e-mail address. See below for Gary Larson's postal address.\n\nWhat is Gary Larson's postal address?\n\nGary Larson\n\nc/o Andrews McMeel Publishing\n\n4520 Main St., Suite 700\n\nKansas City, MO. 64111\n\nAll author mail is forwarded to Gary Larson from Andrews McMeel Publishing. They cannot give out the authors addresses or phone numbers.\n\nWhere can I buy Gary Larson books?\n\nPlease visit my Gary Larson Books-Page.\n\nWhat is \"The Far Side\"?\n\nThe precursor to The Far Side first appeared in the Seattle Times in 1979 under the name, \"Natures Way\". After Larsons success with the San Francisco Chronicle, The Far Side was syndicated in 1980 by Chronicle Features. Its first appearance in the Chronicle under the new name was in 1980. The Far Side ran for fifteen years, ending with the retirement of the strip on January 1, 1995. Larson chose to end the cartoon because he felt it was getting repetitive.\n\nThemes in The Far Side were often surreal, such as \"How cows behave when no human watches\", or \"The unexpected dangers of being an insect\". Often, the behavior of supposedly superior humans is compared with that of animals: surrounded by dense fences and houses, a father explains to his son that a bird song is a territorial marking common to the lower animals. Animals and other creatures were frequently presented anthropomorphically. For example, one strip shows a family of spiders driving in a car with a \"Have a Nice Day\" bumper sticker, featuring a \"smiley face\" with eight eyes.\n\nGary Larsons Far Side cartoons were syndicated worldwide and published in many collections. They were also reproduced extensively on greetings cards which continue to be popular. Two animated versions, \"Tales from the Far Side\" and \"Tales from the Far Side II\", were produced for television.\n\nDid the \"The Far Side\" gain awards?\n\nYes, several. Gary Larson was awarded the Newspaper Panel Cartoon Award by the National Cartoonist Society in 1985 and 1988. Larson also earned the Societys Reuben Award for 1990 and 1994. Gary Larson has also been recognized for various individual strips by the National Cartoonist Society in 1989, 1990, 1991, 1993 and 1995.\n\nGary Larson even received the honor of having a newly-discovered insect species named after him. The Strigiphilus garylarsoni is a biting louse of a genus only found on owls.\n\nWhere do I find Gary Larson Cartoons on the Internet?\n\nI recently had some links on these pages, but I had to take them away (see Gary Larson's letter).\n\nWho owns the copyright of the Far Side Cartoons?\n\nI would like to publish Gary Larson Cartoons.\n\nFarWorks, Inc. owns the copyright of most of the Gary Larson Cartoons.
