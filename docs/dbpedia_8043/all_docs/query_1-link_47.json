        "text": "Gary M. Larson, age 77 of River Falls, passed away unexpectedly on October 18, 2023, at his residence due to natural causes. Gary was born on July 3, 1946, in Red Wing, Minnesota, and was raised in Bay City, where he attended elementary school before graduating from River Falls High School as part of the Class of ’64. As a young man, he enlisted in the armed forces and proudly served in the United States Marine Corps.\n\nGary was a gifted carpenter, and his hard work paid off. He worked for several general contractors before deciding to open his own construction business, GM Larson Construction. Initially, he helped build new construction homes, followed by spec homes, and eventually focused on remodeling, offering more options and flexible time frames. However, Gary considered his most important role or job to be that of a father to his two children, Matthew and Melissa.\n\nHe enjoyed leisurely drives through the countryside, where he would check on local farmers’ progress in their fields or search for an Oliver Tractor, preferably for sale. Many friendships were forged during his hunt for specific parts for his Oliver tractors. As a carpenter, he cherished the time spent creating wooden furniture and keepsakes to share with others. Gary also took great care of his vegetable garden and loved sharing the surplus produce with those close to him.\n\nGary was a simple man who relished the sanctity of his home, always willing to help anyone in need and eager to share his bountiful harvest of tomatoes and cucumbers, as well as his skills in building gun cabinets, dressers, or tables with others.\n\nGary is survived by his children, Matthew (Stephanie) Larson and Melissa Roman; his grandchildren, Lillian, Madison, and Gunner; and his siblings, Karen (Ted) Seifert and Stephen Staats. His parents, Marvin and Audrey (Brohaugh) Larson, preceded him in death."
