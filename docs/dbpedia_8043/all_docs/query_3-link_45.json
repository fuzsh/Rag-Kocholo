        "text": "Almost 25 years after ending his iconic cartoon — and three months after teasing its return — Gary Larson has unveiled a new “Far Side” website.\n\nTheFarSide.com will post daily selections from the single-panel cartoon that ran in newspapers from 1980 to 1995, and it will occasionally have new work, said a letter from the cartoonist that ran on the site.\n\nThe site’s first offering Tuesday was the last “Far Side” cartoon printed, on Jan. 1, 1995: a rare double panel with a “Wizard of Oz” theme, in which “Gary” wakes up in his bed and babbles to his assembled relatives about his fantastic adventure in a land of cows, cavemen and nerdy little kids.\n\nTuesday’s other panels had a theme of technological ineptitude.\n\nFans had been watching the site since a message appeared in September promising “a new online era of The Far Side.”\n\nIn a welcome letter, Larson, 69, said he had long resisted digital reproduction of his cartoons — “those old computer screens suck when it came to visual nuances” — but that advances in technology eventually convinced him the time had come.\n\nHe also said he hoped the site would help him in his battle against copyright infringement by others posting his cartoons.\n\nThe cartoonist closed his letter by saying, “I hope all the reasons I’ve given here help explain why I’m so late to this party. But I’m finally here. And I could use a drink.”"
