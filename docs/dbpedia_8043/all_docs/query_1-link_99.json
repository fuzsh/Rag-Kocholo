        "text": "Recently I was able to purchase a Larson cartoon in a frame that was a gift to someone in 1986. It is a threesome of butterfly hunters with the carcass of a butterfly on the front of the car as their trophy. It appears that it is done in colored pencil and signed Larson. I was wondering if it was a real find or a copy? And if there is anyone who is familiar with his work PLEASE let me know. I always loved Gary Larson's comics and was devastated when he retired. I remember that his last cartoon included the Nancy comic personality and since that is my name it always stuck with me. Thanks , NancyI would like to find an enlarged print of a Far Side, I belive it's \"When potato salad goes Bad\" as funny as it is however, not being able to go to the artists site, or any other and find what I think I remember....... is making me me a little nuts, to the point where it's not so funny anymore...I was just looking for a print online and stumbled into this mess of artists children blah blah blah...bottom line, no print.I'm a long time Larson fan, and a cartoonist, despite various health regulations. (Some silly things about plagues, they said.)\n\nI do understand his obvious concerns, but I think Gary might find that if his own website was clickable for anything but orders, so he had control over content, the net would be a lot easier to live with. The kids generally get better treatment at home, anyway, and you can keep track better with site stats and monitoring. Doesn't have to be much more than a catalog and a few selected pics, promo stuff. Easy to set up, or better still get the merchandisers and publishers to do it. There's no such thing as \"security\" of material on the net, it's more to do with providing a better thing and using your own discretion. What's on the site is what you can expect to be copied. Not all bad, because if someone likes it enough to copy, they're fans, not parasites.\n\nHowever- the alternative is any old thing someone can scan, and that's a bit less than terrific from what I've seen on other sites.\n\nSchulz has his stuff on his publisher's site, in strips, so it can't be that hard to do it the way you want to do it.\n\nI've also found that it's a good place to try out other material."
