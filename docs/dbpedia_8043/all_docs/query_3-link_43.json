        "text": "The “Far Side” cartoonist Gary Larson surprised fans this week with three new cartoons, 25 years after his retirement and months after he teased his return.\n\nThe new single-panel comics, dated Tuesday, show a man hailing a taxidermist instead of a taxi; two aliens discussing plans to “probe and release” a man approaching in a car; and four bears in a forest dining on Cub Scouts covered in honey.\n\n“I don’t want to mislead anyone here,” Mr. Larson wrote on his website, explaining that the new works were not a resurrection of “The Far Side,” the daily cartoon that became a cultural phenomenon and routinely delighted and stumped fans.\n\nMr. Larson said that the day after he retired in 1995, it felt good not to draw on a deadline, and that he had moved on to other interests. His return to creating oddball situations started with a clogged pen, he said.\n\n“Despite my retirement, I still had intermittent connections to cartooning, including my wife’s and my personal Christmas card,” he said. “Once a year, I’d sit myself down to take on Santa, and every year it began with the same ritual: me cursing at, and then cleaning out, my clogged pen.”\n\nA few years ago, finally fed up with his “traitorous pen,” Mr. Larson tried using a digital tablet. Within moments of firing it up, he said, he was having fun drawing again.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
