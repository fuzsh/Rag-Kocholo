The visionary editors were captivated and not only wanted to run his single-panel creations in the Chronicle but syndicate them as well.\n\nThey weren’t thrilled with the title, though. Larson’s previous work in the Seattle Times was called “Nature’s Way.”\n\nThe name was changed to “The Far Side.” It debuted on January 1, 1980 and was appearing in 1,900 newspapers when Larson put down his pens and pencils in January 1, 1995."
