        "text": "Gary Owen Larson, 64, of Rochester, MN crossed the finish line of that great marathon of life on April 30, 2024 of pancreatic cancer. He is now resting peacefully in the lap of Jesus, rejoicing with those who have finished ahead of him, and eagerly anticipating the joyful arrival of those who follow behind.\n\nGary was born on September 20, 1959 in Albert Lea, MN to Kermith Wayne Larson and Beverly Ann (Rygh) Larson. He grew up in many houses in and around Scarville, IA. Gary graduated from Lake Mills (IA) High school in 1978, and from Luther College (Decorah, IA) in 1982, then moving to Rochester, MN to enjoy a full and rewarding life.\n\nGary was united in marriage to Ellen Wlodarski on September 15, 1990. Gary worked for IBM for nearly 28 years, and then worked for the Mayo Clinic where he was employed until the time of his passing.\n\nGary had a passion for many things over the course of his life, with family time to be among the most precious. Gary loved going on family trips and outings and was totally content just doing anything together. Gary was also active in his church family, including singing on the Worship Team and being involved in Community Bible Study for over 25 years. Whether it was simply playing piano, singing, reading, writing, running (Boston Marathon 2000), following sports (especially the Vikings and Twins), or enjoying his \"vast\" baseball card collection, Gary pursued these activities with enthusiasm.\n\nGary is preceded in death by his parents.\n\nGary is survived by his lovely bride of nearly 34 years, Ellen, his amazing children, Grace and Owen, his older brother Mike (Rosanne) Larson of Lake Mills, IA, his younger brother Bob (Julie) Larson of Jefferson, IA, and best friend, Rick (Angie) Stover of Story City, IA. He is also survived by numerous nieces and nephews, other relatives, friends, and brothers and sisters in Jesus Christ, all of whom Gary longs to be reunited.\n\nA memorial service will be held at Calvary Evangelical Free Church (5500 25th Ave NW, Rochester) at 4:00 pm on Tuesday, May 7, 2024. Visitation will be from 2:30pm until time of service at the church.\n\nIn lieu of flowers, the family requests donations be made to Samaritan's Purse, Children's Heart Project or Operation Christmas Shoebox.\n\nRanfranz and Vine Funeral Home is honored to be serving the Larson family.
