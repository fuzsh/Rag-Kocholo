        "text": "During this time, I am reminded of a Gary Larson cartoon. It depicts the back of a dog on which various lice stroll about. One of these lice is morbid looking. He is holding a sign that announces: “The end of the dog is coming”. The end of our small world is not always the end of the whole world, I guess.\n\nMaybe I just mix with the right crowd, but I haven’t seen many doom-and-gloom prophesies about the immanent end of the world recently. While I am also not under the conviction that the Corona virus means judgement day is upon us, I do think we can say that it probably qualifies as what is known as a “Black Swan Event.”\n\nWhat is a Black Swan Event? Wikipedia gives the following definition:\n\n“an event that comes as a surprise, has a major effect, and is often inappropriately rationalized after the fact with the benefit of hindsight.”\n\nCovid 19’s spread sure came as a surprise and is having a major effect, one we have not really come to grips with. It might not end the world, but it is probably going to change it for the foreseeable future. Even after it has (hopefully) passed, it’s going to have long lasting effects. That is not just bad news. Some things will be changed for the better.\n\nRecently I spend a few days with a bunch of great thinkers, people experienced in interpreting not just Scripture but culture and it’s signs and symbols. Covid 19 just reared its ugly head over the North American continent, so it became appoint of discussion. One thinker said something that resonated with me. He said that one of the things Covid 19 is going to change for ever, is globalization.\n\nIt’s not like international travel and trade is going to stop altogether. We are to far down that rabbit hole to ever turn back. But what is going to change is the focus. As the internet and technology opened new possibilities for business and exchange (and sadly exploitation) between remote locations, it drew the focus on the “elsewhere”. We flew in experts from elsewhere or visited elsewhere to gain new insights. It was the global, rather than the local that got our mouths watering.\n\nNow this all is going to be tempered and the focus is going to shift back to the local. Local is safe. Local is important and the overlooked and neglected in our local context might threaten our lives in the next Covid like calamity. Hence, the way of thinking will go, we should reinvest time and energy into local institutions, people and efforts. This prospect excites me. It can revitalize interest in the proverbial “neighbourhood church down the road” and relationships in our immediate context. It will bring about all kinds of interesting perspectives and creativity.\n\nWhat other positive changes can you see coming about? What changes do you hope for?\n\nMaybe the world is ending. But in the way a friend of mine, Rudi Swanepoel, has put it so eloquently this morning on Facebook. I want to make his description of the end of the world my hope and prayer this morning:\n\nYes, it is the end of the world.\n\nIt is the end of many certainties (or their illusion). It is the end of control, of planning days and weeks and months ahead, of deciding (for some) what to eat when or where to go to next.\n\nIt is the end of a world where some take things for granted. It is the end of a world where we think we are the centre of the universe, that our needs are more important than those of others, that some lives matter more.\n\nIt is the end of an ignorant world.\n\nIt is the end of a world where we value things more than people. It is the end of a world where my only dream is to obtain. It is the end of a world where people’s worth is determined by their possessions. It is the end of worshiping things.\n\nIt is the end of excess and of wasting. It is the end of non-essentials, of mind- and heartlessness. It is the end of a world where we only use people when we need them.\n\nIt is the end of a world without deep and authentic community.\n\nIt is the end of the old world, but the birth of a new one.\n\nGabriel J Snyman"
