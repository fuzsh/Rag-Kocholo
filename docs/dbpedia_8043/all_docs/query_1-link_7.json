        "text": "Creator of \"The Far Side\" which debuted in the San Francisco Chronicle on 1 January 1980. He retired from daily panels on 1 January 1995, at which time \"The Far Side\" was being seen in 1,900 daily and Sunday newspapers worldwide.\n\nOne of his most famous \"Far Side\" comics portrayed a video store in Hell that only stocked copies of Ishtar (1987). Larson later admitted he had not actually seen the film when he drew the comic, and later caught it on an airplane and admitted he actually enjoyed it.\n\nI keep thinking someone's gonna show up and say, 'There's been a big mistake. The guy next door is supposed to be drawing the cartoon. Here's your shovel.'\n\nYou know those little snow globes that you shake up? I always thought my brain was sort of like that. You know, where you just give it a shake and watch what comes out and shake it again. It's like that.\n\nI think one thing that's important to maintain is a sense of fear, always doubting yourself... a good dose of insecurity helps your work in some ways."
