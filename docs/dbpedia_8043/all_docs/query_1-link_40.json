A celebration of life service will be held at a later date. In lieu of flowers, memorials to Rice Hospice, Atwater Area Block Nursing Program or Rosendale United Methodist Cemetery Association are preferred. Arrangements are with the Peterson Brothers Atwater Funeral Home. www.petersonbrothers.com\n\nGary Channing Larson was born on May 18, 1933, on the family farm in Lake Elizabeth Township, Kandiyohi County, Minnesota, the son of E.
