        "text": "In the world of daily comic strips, Gary Larson is something of an anomaly. He's both inspiring and frustrating. Larson wrote the classic comic The Far Side for 15 years and then abruptly retired because he didn't want to keep pumping out the same jokes. He didn't even want to be a cartoonist until he realized how much he hated working retail. It makes sense that there are a lot of odd Gary Larson stories - his single-panel comic was known for being esoteric.\n\nBut just who is Gary Larson, the person? Any Gary Larson biography is going to have some basic quotes and history, but this list goes deeper. It explores Gary Larson anecdotes, Gary Larson trivia, and some Gary Larson facts that go beyond your basic wiki entry. So if you want to get to know the creative genius behind The Far Side, read through this list and leave a comment about your favorite Gary Larson comic."
