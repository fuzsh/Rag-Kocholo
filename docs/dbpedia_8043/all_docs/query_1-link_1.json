        "text": "Early life\n\nLarson was raised in Tacoma, Washington, the youngest son of Vern Larson, a car salesman, and Doris Larson, who worked as a secretary. What he called his family’s “morbid sense of humour” was an early inspiration for his later work in comics. Larson and his elder brother, Dan, were drawn to nature and explored the plants and animals of local forests and Puget Sound. He did not formally study art as a child but often sketched dinosaurs, whales, giraffes, and other animals. He also owned a pet snake and developed an interest in herpetology, which later became a recurring theme in his comics.\n\nLarson graduated from Curtis High School in University Place, Washington, and started his college career at Washington State University as a biology major. However, he graduated in 1972 with a degree in communications, albeit tempered with many science course electives. For several years after college, he worked in a retail music store. Finding that unsatisfying, he developed six single-panel comics in 1976, which he sold to a local science magazine called Pacific Search. He also worked as an animal cruelty investigator for the Humane Society to supplement his income while pursuing his interest in drawing and comics.\n\nCareer\n\nHis first comic series, called Nature’s Way, appeared in The Seattle Times newspaper in 1979. In this series Larson developed many of the elements that would shape his work in The Far Side, especially his surrealistic art style and odd cast of characters—which included aliens, mad scientists, and anthropomorphized cows, snakes, and other animals. His humour was often directed pointedly at human beings, which was also a common device in The Far Side. Later in 1979 Larson secured a deal with the San Francisco Chronicle newspaper and Chronicle Features Syndicate, which renamed his comic series The Far Side and syndicated it in 30 newspapers across the United States starting in January 1980.\n\nShortly after securing his syndication deal, he received a letter from The Seattle Times stating that it was dropping Nature’s Way because some readers found its humour offensive. Still, Larson produced The Far Side prolifically from 1980 to 1995, as many as seven panels per week, a pace that he found to be challenging and exhausting. He took a 14-month sabbatical starting in 1988, shortly after his marriage to American anthropologist Toni Carmichael. To the delight of his fans, which included scientists who sometimes wrote to him to correct scientific inaccuracies, he returned to comics in 1990. At its peak, The Far Side ran in some 1,900 newspapers and was translated into 17 languages. His work has been compiled into 23 books, 22 of which have made The New York Times best-seller list.\n\nDespite his success, Larson retired from comics in January 1995. He created two animated short films, Gary Larson’s Tales from the Far Side (1994), which aired as a Halloween special on the American television network CBS, and Gary Larson’s Tales from the Far Side II (1997). He published the illustrated book There’s a Hair in My Dirt!: A Worm’s Story in 1998. In 2003 he illustrated a cover for The New Yorker magazine and published The Complete Far Side, a two-book collection that includes the entire run of The Far Side comic series.\n\nGet a Britannica Premium subscription and gain access to exclusive content.

Two species have been named in Larson’s honour: Strigiphilus garylarsoni (a louse specific to owls) and Serratoterga larsoni (a butterfly native to Ecuador). Additionally, the word for the spikes on the tail of a stegosaurus, thagomizer, derives from The Far Side."
