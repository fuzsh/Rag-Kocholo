        "text": "CAMPUS\n\nThe site of the new Normal School (there were already two in Maine— Castine and Farmington) was a five acre lot of land owned by another McLellan, J.T., which was on Townhouse Hill facing High Street, as College Avenue was then called. Since the Gorham Academy had been only for boys, the Academy Trustees established the Female Seminary in 1836. The building was erected on the strength of pledges amounting to $21,000. Only $7,000 was collected, so for some years the Trustees were in financial difficulties. However, both Academy and Seminary flourished. It is said that Kate Douglas Wiggins attended the Seminary. In the 1870’s, when public high schools became common in Maine, the school failed, as did many other private secondary schools of the time. The Trustees, who wanted the Normal School in Gorham, offered the buildings to the State for the use of the Normal School, and the Seminary building became the first dormitory for women.\n\nMCLELLAN HOUSE\n\nThe first brick house in Cumberland County was built for Hugh and Elizabeth McLellan in 1773. Acquired by Gorham State College in 1966 and used originally as an honors dormitory, it became a regular dormitory housing students 20 years of age or older. It now houses the Center for Education Policy, Applied Research and Evaluation.\n\nACADEMY BUILDING\n\nThe Academy was chartered by the General Court of Massachusetts in 1803. A land grant was made to produce income, providing that the trustees raised $3,000 within a year. The required $3,000 for construction was raised and, on a lot of land given by Thomas McLellan valued at $350, the Academy was built. The building was dedicated on September 8, 1806 and was leased to the State in 1878 for the use of the new normal school for educational purposes. It still is not the property of USM, but belongs to the Gorham Academy Association.\n\nCORTHELL HALL\n\nDesigned by the architect F. H. Fassett, for the site which the Trustees had selected after a Gorham Town Meeting in March of 1878 unanimously voted to raise $15,000 toward its construction. Those of you who may be buying or have bought a house will appreciate the financial figures for the building —— according to the account now in the Archives, a total of $24,290.50 was raised for the building. The actual cost of everything (including 60 cents for the account book in which to keep the record) came to $23,170.39, leaving a balance of $120.11 when the account was audited. The new building was dedicated on December 26, 1878 and on January 29, 1879, the first class of 85 students entered, of which 45 graduated a year later. The addition to Corthell to bring it to its present size was built in 1905 and it was renovated in 1961, again in 1986. The USM School of Music resides in Corthell Hall.\n\nROBIE-ANDREWS HALL\n\nRobie Hall, named for Governor Frederick Robie, who contributed to its construc­tion, was built in 1897. It was originally needed to house women students because the Seminary building had burned down in 1894. At this period, it was customary for male students to board in the town. Andrews Hall was constructed in 1916. It was called East Hall for forty years until in May 1956, it was named for Miriam E. Andrews. Ms. Andrews taught music at Gorham from 1922 to 1960. Robie – Andrews was extensively renovated in 1977 and today provides offices and studios for the Art Department as well as serving as a dormitory.\n\nWOODWARD HALL\n\nThe building of this Hall in 1955 kicked off a flurry of construction on the Gorham Campus, which lasted through 1970. Woodward Hall was the first dormitory for men. It was named for Louis B. Woodward, who taught natural and social sciences at Gorham from 1913 to 1955, and also served as Vice Principal from 1935 to his retirement. The Russell Scholars Program can be found in this residence hall which also has a computer lab on the first floor.\n\nUPTON-HASTINGS HALL\n\nUpton Hall dates from 1960 and was originally a dormitory for women. It named for Ethelyn F. Upton who taught mathematics beginning in 1932 and was the Director of Student Teaching from 1945 to her retirement in 1962. Hastings Hall, the adjacent unit, opened in 1968 and was named for Mary Hastings who preceded Miss Upton as Director of Student Teaching. It has large lounge space and is, therefore, the scene of many activities. This dormitory was built at a cost of $947,000 (quite a contrast to the cost of Corthell, ninety years earlier!) The placing of the time capsule and the laying of the cornerstone by President Kenneth T. H. Brooks and Dean of Women Edna F. Dickey took place at ceremonies held on May 10, 1967. The Upton-Hastings complex houses 300 students. Dr. Brooks’ span as President, from 1960 to 1970, saw two large changes of name and function. In 1965, Gorham became a State College, thereby greatly broadening its academic purpose. In 1968, it became a unit of the newly created University of Maine system. Upton-Hastings now includes Campus Card Services, the Office of Community Standards, Mail Services, USM Police Department, Residence Hall, Residential Life and Resident Education, and University Health and Counseling.\n\nANDERSON HALL\n\nBuilt as a men’s dormitory in 1963, this was named for Hayden L.V. Anderson, an alumnus who taught at Gorham for many years, and went on the serve as Director of Professional Services for the Maine Department of Education. Purchasing and Payables can also be found in this residence hall.\n\nDICKEY-WOOD HALL\n\nKnown as the “towers”, this residence hall was opened in 1970 but not formally dedicated and named until 1973. Edna F. Dickey, who taught History at Gorham from 1945 to 1972, was also Dean of Women from 1945 to 1969, a period of tremendous change both in society and on college campuses — from the days of parietals to co-ed dorms. Her performance in dealing with such changes was excellent. Esther E. Wood, who served from 1930 to 1973, taught the Social Sciences.\n\nPHILIPPI HALL\n\nThis residence hall opened in 2004.\n\nUPPERCLASS HALL\n\nThis new residence hall, which opened in 2007, earned a Gold LEED rating.\n\nPRESIDENT’S HOUSE\n\nAnother example of the generosity of Frederick Robie, who contributed $7,000 of the $10,000 cost, the President’s House was built in 1906. Dr. Walter Russell, who succeeded Dr. William Corthell as Principal in 1905, was its first occupant and lived there until he retired in 1940.\n\nART GALLERY\n\nThis building has a funny history – it was erected in 1821 as a free meeting house because of the rivalries of two singing societies, the Haydns and the Handels, both vying for the singing seats in the old Congregational church. Needless to say, there was no way they could agree and the Haydns finally won out. Therefore, a subscription was started to build the free meeting house in which the Handels held the singing seats, regardless of what denomination was holding the service! In 1840, the Free Meeting House came into the possession of the town and, after removing the spire, installing the columns, and refitting the interior, it was used as the Town Hall until 1960, when it came to Gorham State Teachers College. It has been used as an Art Gallery since 1966. The Civil War Soldiers’ Monument in front was the gift to the town of Gorham of Toppan Robie (Frederick Robie’s father and the first Robie in Gorham), from whom the town had acquired the meeting house. Its cost was $2,000. He was a trustee of Gorham Academy for fifty years and was a large contributor to the town and the Congregational Church as well as to the Academy.\n\nRUSSELL HALL\n\nBuilt in 1931 and named for Dr. Walter E. Russell, principal of Gorham Normal School from 1905 to 1940, this was the only building erected on the campus between 1916 and 1955. The architect was Raymond Mayo of Portland. It provides the stage, auditorium, and offices for the Theatre Department.\n\nBAILEY HALL\n\nThe largest academic building on the campus, Bailey was built in three units. The first was the Science Wing, constructed in 1958, which contains classrooms, laboratories, and offices. It was followed in 1961 by the Library Wing, which contains classrooms, conference rooms, and faculty offices, as well as the separate two-story Library. The third and final unit, a classroom wing, opened in 1969. Dedication of the building to Dr. Francis L. Bailey, who served as the President of Gorham from 1940 to 1960, was conducted on November 17, 1959. Dr. Bailey’s administration saw the name of the institution changed from a Normal School to a State Teacher’s College in 1945.\n\nWARREN HILL GYMNASIUM\n\nThis provided badly needed facilities on the Gorham Campus, since the small gym in Russell Hall was inadequate. It was built in 1963 and named for Warren G. Hill, a 1939 graduate of Gorham and a former Maine Commissioner of Education. The gym can seat 2,500 people. It has been enlarged to include the Ice Arena and the Field House.\n\nJOHN MITCHELL CENTER\n\nThis building, erected in 1965, houses the Industrial Arts program, one of the oldest special programs— established in 1911. The program inhabited several buildings in its lifetime, at one point being housed in the Academy Building. The Center houses, besides offices and classrooms for the industrial arts and vocational—industrial teacher education, all the necessary laboratories and facilities. After renovation in 2004, this was the first university building statewide to receive LEED (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design) Certification. The center has laboratories and classroom facilities for the College of Science, Technology and Health.\n\nKENNETH BROOKS STUDENT CENTER\n\nThe center was named after Kenneth Brooks who served as President of Gorham State Teacher College, 1960 to 1968, then as President of the University of Maine at Gorham until 1970. In the student center you can find a bookstore, Campus Involvement and Activities, Dining Services, Greek Life Organizations and Student Life.\n\nARBORETUM\n\nThis project was begun on the Gorham Campus after around 175 trees were lost in an ice storm in 1998. The goal was not only to begin to replace the trees but also to increase the diversity of species for ecological and educational purposes. The Arboretum was officially recognized on Earth Day, 2001 and continues to expand. For more information, including a walking tour map, and photographs identifying some of the tree species on campus please click here.\n\nACADEMY BUILDING – Art Department Studios\n\nADMISSIONS HOUSE – Undergraduate Admissions, Transfer Affairs\n\nART DRAWING CLASSROOM\n\nCENTRAL HEATING PLANT\n\nFACILITIES MANAGEMENT\n\nPRINTMAKING STUDIO\n\nWATER TOWER\n\n7 COLLEGE AVENUE – TRIOS Program\n\n19 COLLEGE AVENUE – University Environmental Health and Safety\n\n51 COLLEGE AVENUE\n\n28 HUSKY DRIVE – USM Public Safety\n\n62 SCHOOL STREET – Multicultural Education Programs\n\n128 SCHOOL STREET – Human Resources, Payroll System\n\n134 SCHOOL STREET – R.O.T.C.\n\nCAMPUS\n\nPortland Junior College, which was established in 1933, held its classes in rented quarters until it purchased six acres of the old Deering estate in October, 1947. This was very historic land, having been obtained from Sir Ferdinando Gorges in 1637 and been involved in the Indian Wars. It was owned by the Brackett family for a very long time, sold to Noyes and later in 1802 to James Deering. The mansion which Deering built fell into such bad condition that it had to be torn down when the College purchased the land. Both the old carriage house (barn) and the farmhouse were on the land purchased. The College secured some Navy prefab buildings from the federal government which were ferried from Great Diamond Island in pieces and erected on the new campus. The “Barn” became the gym and the auditorium and provided a cafeteria, while the old farmhouse (built 1804) became the administration building. The pre­fab buildings provided classroom and library space. The last prefab building was taken down in September 1988. The “Barn” was also taken down.\n\n23 BRIGHTON AVENUE\n\nThe old farmhouse became the Alumni House. The building now houses the Interfaith Chaplaincy and Office of Community Service Learning.\n\nPAYSON SMITH HALL\n\nThe merger of Portland Junior College with the University of Maine in the summer of 1957 created the new institution of the University of Maine in Portland (UMP). Payson Smith Hall was the first building erected by the University, and was opened in 1960. Portland Junior College had been for men only (except in its early years) and because of a lack of facilities in the old buildings,women did not enter UMP until the completion of this building. It was named for Mr. Smith who was a well known Maine educator and who later became Commissioner of Education in Massachusetts.\n\nLUTHER I. BONNEY HALL\n\nAs UMP grew, more space became a necessity. Bonney Hall provided five stories of classrooms, seminar rooms and office space as well as the 250-seat air-conditioned auditorium/lecture hall which was refurbished in 2006 and named the Gerald E. Talbot Lecture Hall. Dedicated on November 18, 1965, the building was named in honor of the Dean Emeritus, often called the Father of the Portland Campus. Luther Bonney had been instrumental in the founding of Portland Junior College from the very beginning in 1933 and became its Dean in 1938, serving until the merger in 1957. The entire building, classrooms and library, was designed by the Portland archi­tectural firm of Wadsworth, Boston, Dimick, Mercer and Weatherill. Mr. Philip Wads­worth designed the main entrance and patio. The two-story wing of Luther Bonney Hall was built for the Library which moved from Payson Smith Hall in the fall of 1965. It remained the Library for twenty-eight years (very, very crowded in its last years there), until it moved into its new quarters in August of 1993. The space now serves as a computer lab.\n\nTHE UNIVERSITY COMMONS\n\nThis area includes the Abromson Community Education Center, The Wishcamper Center (Osher Lifelong Learning Institute and Muskie School of Public Service), The Glickman Family Library and Osher Map Library. The land between the library and Abromson Center was purchased by the USM Foundation from Portland Plastic Pipe.\n\nABROMSON COMMUNITY EDUCATION CENTER\n\nThe Abromson Center, which opened in 2005 as part of the University Commons, was designed by the architectural firm Einhorn Yaffee Prescott. The center includes classrooms and the Hannaford Lecture Hall as well as the covered Alumni Skywalk for pedestrian traffic across Bedford Street and a 1,200-car parking garage. It was named after former Portland mayor, city councilor and USM faculty member Linda Abromson and her late husband, state senator Joel Abromson. With its ‘green’ design the building was the first in Maine to earn LEED (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design) Certification at the Gold level.\n\nTHE WISHCAMPER CENTER\n\nThe Wishcamper Center, named after Joe and Carol Wishcamper, opened in 2008 as part of the University Commons project. It houses two separate programs, The Osher Lifelong Learning Institute of Southern Maine and its National Resource Center and The Muskie School of Public Service.\n\nALBERT BRENNER GLICKMAN FAMILY LIBRARY\n\nWork began in the Fall of 1991 on what had been origi­nally the National Biscuit Company building (100,000 sq. ft. of space), later owned by the Johnson Supply Company, from whom the University purchased it. Four of the seven stories were renovated (the remainder to be done as funds permit) and the Library opened in its new building on September 1, 1993 with official opening ceremonies October 3, 1993. The Library provides a variety of study areas, over 300,000 books, periodicals and government documents (both Federal and State), reference service, inter-library loans and bibliographic searching of computer databases. The remaining three floors were renovated and opened in 2004 and included a new facility for Special Collections. The first floor was renovated in 2009 to expand the Osher Map Library and create a new front entrance for the library.\n\nVIKING SHIP SCULPTURE\n\nIn October, 1967 the Student Senate voted to look into the possibility of obtaining a piece of sculpture on a Viking theme to serve as the campus symbol. The Art Department was contacted and the Spring of 1968 brought a model of a sculpture by Mr. John Risley of Wesleyan Univer­sity, called “The Viking Ship and the Midnight Sun”. After much discussion pro and con (some students wanted a 10’ tall statue of a Viking in full battle regalia), the Senate agreed to the model, and it was completed and received by December, 1969. A decision for its placement was finally made. The base was constructed and the Ship was ensconced in the outdoor court of Luther Bonney Hall.\n\nPOWERS HOUSE & 92 BEDFORD STREET\n\nThese houses were acquired in 1968 to provide quarters for some of the Student Activities. They house the Student Senate and many student groups, as well as The University Free Press and the radio station, WMPG. Around the same time some other properties on Bedford and Chamberlain Streets and vicinity were purchased for use as office space and parking. 92 Bedford houses The University Free Press and the radio station, WMPG. In place of the Powers House the parking garage and Abromson Community Education Center now stand.\n\nSULLIVAN RECREATION AND FITNESS COMPLEX\n\nTwo new buildings were under construction in 1968 and opened in 1969. The student body and the degree programs offered had increased so rapidly (from 300 day students in 1960 to approximately 1,200 day students in 1968) that the space and facilities were badly needed. The first of these, the Gymnasium, seats 2,800 and is used for many activities as well as spectator sports. It also provides classrooms, offices, the Portland Health Center, squash and handball courts, the Employee Wellness Program, Gym Operations, Outdoor Recreation and Police Department. The well-known Lifeline program was housed there until it closed at USM and moved to the Maine Medical Center in 2009. The architects were the same as for Luther Bonney, Wadsworth, Boston, Dimick, Mercer and Weatherill. In 1993 the building was named for James V. Sullivan, who served Athletics from 1960 to 1992.\n\nTHE SCIENCE BUILDING\n\nThe second building to open in 1969, this was dedicated December 10th. The architects for this building were Alonzo Harriman Associates of Auburn. It provides space and facilities for the Biological Sciences, Chemistry, Mathematics and Statistics, Computer Science, Physics, Psychology, and the Southworth Planetarium, a big drawing card for the community at large and public school systems. The Planetarium puts on excellent programs throughout the academic year. The projector in use has the capability of duplicating the appearance of the sky at any time of any year and from any location on the earth. It was donated by Mrs. Constant Southworth in memory of her husband. Constant Southworth was a prominent Portland publisher of the Southworth-Anthoensen Press. The wing of the Science Building was added in 1975.\n\nBIOSCIENCE RESEARCH WING\n\nThe wing of the Science Building was added in 1975 and houses the Maine Center for Enterprise Development, Wise Environmental and Genetic Toxicology Laboratory, Research Administration and Development and Special Projects in Information and Innovation.\n\nLAW BUILDING\n\nThis is another building designed by the architectural firm of Wadsworth, Boston, Dimick, Mercer and Weatherill. It was opened in 1972. In addition to housing the University of Maine Law School and its excellent law library (the building was expanded in 1993 to provide the library more space), this building holds the Edmund S. Muskie Institute of Public Affairs, and the offices of the President and the Provost. The Moot Courtroom in the Law School is often used for special lectures by legal experts as well as its own purpose (the UM Law School has won many moot court competitions against other nationally recognized law schools).\n\nROBERT L. WOODBURY CAMPUS CENTER\n\nThis building was dedicated September 18, 1985. This had been the Inter­national Harvester Building and it was completely renovated by the architects Moore/Weinrich and Woodward of Brunswick. It houses the Cafeteria, the Office of Student Activities, meeting rooms, and lounges.\n\n21 DURHAM STREET\n\nFrom 1987 to 2009, The Child Day Care Center operated at this location. This site now houses the Communication and Media Studies Production Center.\n\nMASTERTON HALL\n\nIn the Spring of 1987, construction of a new classroom and office building began. It houses primarily the School of Nursing, with its administrative and faculty offices, classrooms, clinical practice rooms and a learning lab. It also houses the Social Work Department of the College of Arts and Sciences. It was dedicated in September, 1988 and named in honor of Robert R. and Nancy Masterton. The exterior sculpture is Patricia Campbell’s “Patterns of Origin I”, and the stained glass windows were designed and executed by Jim Miller. The building was designed by Earl R. Flansburg and Associates, and constructed by the George DiMatteo Company.\n\nPORTLAND HALL\n\nFormerly the Best Western Executive Inn, this was USM’s first Portland Campus dormitory, which opened in the Fall of 1988 at 645 Congress Street. It was sold in 2008, and part of the complex was demolished and rebuilt in 2009. The upper floors are currently rental apartments, with restaurants and retail on the ground floor.\n\n15 BAXTER BOULEVARD – Office of Sponsored Programs, Office of Research Integrity and Outreach\n\n25 BEDFORD STREET – Facilities Management, USM Recycles\n\n94 BEDFORD STREET – Women and Gender Studies Department\n\n98 BEDFORD STREET – History Department\n\n102 BEDFORD STREET – Honors Program\n\n106 BEDFORD STREET – Annual Giving, Development\n\n118 BEDFORD STREET – Maine Center for Business and Economic Research, Center for Entrepreneurship\n\n120 BEDFORD STREET – Sociology Department\n\n126 BEDFORD STREET – Political Science Department\n\n1 CHAMBERLAIN AVENUE – Criminology Department\n\n7 CHAMBERLAIN AVENUE – Cooperative Extension\n\n11 CHAMBERLAIN AVENUE – Economics Department\n\n15 CHAMBERLAIN AVENUE – Cumberland County 4-H\n\n19 CHAMBERLAIN AVENUE – Department of Communication and Media Studies\n\n209 DEERING AVENUE – Human Resources\n\n222 DEERING AVENUE – Office of Equity and Compliance, Stonecoast MFA Department\n\n228 DEERING AVENUE – College of Communication, Culture and the Arts\n\n39 EXETER STREET – Graduate Admissions\n\n45 EXETER STREET – Graduate Studies, Institute for Family-Owned Business\n\n47 EXETER STREET – Philosophy Department\n\n49/51 EXETER STREET – ASL / Signed Language Research Lab\n\n55/57 EXETER STREET – Under renovation.\n\n59/61 EXETER STREET – Cumberland Legal Aid Clinic\n\n65 EXETER STREET – Linguistics Department\n\n11 GRANITE STREET – American and New England Studies Department, Classics Department"
