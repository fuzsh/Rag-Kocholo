The Committee met, pursuant to notice, at 2:32 p.m., in Room SD-226, Dirksen Senate Office Building, Hon. Christopher A. Coons, presiding. Present: Senators Leahy, Schumer, Whitehouse, Franken, Coons, Hirono, Grassley, Hatch, Lee, Cruz, and Flake. Senator Coons. I am pleased to call this nominations hearing of the Senate Committee on the Judiciary to order, and I would like to welcome our nominee as well as his family and friends who are here to offer support. Today the Committee will hear testimony from Sri Srinivasan, who is nominated to be a judge on the DC Circuit Court of Appeals, a court which has not seen a nominee successfully confirmed to it since President George W. Bush's nominee to that court was confirmed in 2006. Today more than 1,500 days into President Obama's term, four of the 11 seats on the DC Circuit are open, putting the remaining judges under, in my view, undue strain. There are now roughly 188 pending cases per active judge on the DC Circuit, 50 percent higher than when the Senate confirmed Thomas Griffith to fill the then-11th seat in 2005. Although the cases handled by the DC Circuit are unusually complex, the caseload per judge on that court is also higher than that of the Tenth Circuit to which the Senate recently confirmed Robert Bacharach. The President has nominated talented nominees to help alleviate this pressure. Caitlin Halligan waited more than 900 days for an up-or-down vote. She came with the American Bar Association's highest rating, glowing recommendations from bipartisan supporters, and a diverse legal career marked by distinctive service as New York's Solicitor General. Her nomination, sadly, was filibustered, and judging from the discussion in Committee and on the floor, this was in large part because of positions she had taken on behalf of the State of New York in litigation against gun manufacturers. As a Senator, I do not believe I have the right to ask that judicial nominees have advocated only positions with which I agree. As Chief Justice Roberts has said, and I quote, ``It is a tradition of the American Bar that goes back before the founding of our Nation that lawyers are not identified with the positions of their clients.'' To do so, in my view, is unfair to advocates, to unpopular clients, and unfair to the American people. Every time the Senate holds up a nominee for partisan or political reasons, we lose not only the contributions of that candidate, but we make it harder to find talented individuals willing to serve. The nominee before us today appears--from his qualifications, from my discussion with him, from my reading of his work, and from the many strong and bipartisan recommendations his nomination has received--to possess an exceptionally talented legal mind. He has served in the Solicitor General's Office for both Republican and Democratic administrations. He has served with such distinction that 12 bipartisan, high-ranking officials in the Office of the Solicitor General have publicly endorsed his nomination. Mr. Srinivasan has also represented an astonishingly diverse range of clients, from criminal aliens to large corporations to the United States itself. As a result, he has advocated legal positions that are sure to run counter to at least a few policy preferences of any elected official. But I will not judge him on a standard of ideological purity, particularly not with regard to any client he might have advocated on behalf of. The DC Circuit is perhaps the most important appellate court in our Nation. It is called upon to decide issues of national importance, such as the legality of agency action and the tools employed in the work and the fight against terrorism. The cases that come before the DC Circuit require sober consideration, legal acumen, not ideological purity. In my view, when a President submits a qualified candidate of high character and sound legal mind, absent exceptional circumstances, that candidate is entitled to a vote. I look forward to the testimony we will hear today, which I am confident will confirm what is apparent for Mr. Srinivasan's qualifications. I hope that my colleagues will join with me to show the American people the Senate is not broken and that regular order is capable of addressing the vacancy crisis on the DC Circuit. Before we turn to introductions and to the witnesses, I will yield to my distinguished Ranking Member, Senator Grassley, and then to our Committee Chair. Senator. Senator Grassley. I asked for the right to speak after the two Senators introduce and after Senator Leahy speaks, because I, like you, have some philosophical points of view I want to make, not about the nominee but just things that need to be put on the record, so I do not want to hold up my colleagues. Senator Coons. Thank you, Senator Grassley. Senator Leahy, Chairman Leahy. OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. PATRICK J. LEAHY, A U.S. SENATOR FROM THE STATE OF VERMONT Chairman Leahy. Well, thank you. First, I want to thank Senator Coons for chairing this extremely important hearing. He has done this time and time again, and it means a great deal to me, especially as I have to be at another matter that requires my presence. We originally planned this hearing for January. It was delayed. It had already been delayed from last year when this nomination was first made by the President. I agreed to an additional delay at the request of the Ranking Member to allow time for our staffs to better understand what, if any, role he had in the current position as Principal Deputy Solicitor General in the events leading up to the city of St. Paul, Minnesota, withdrawing a petition before the Supreme Court. I believe we have fully explored that issue, and certainly I am pleased with the very strong bipartisan support we have received for this nominee. So if anybody has some other questions about his qualification, come here now and raise them, because I would like to get this matter voted on. We have the Republican filibuster that we just went through with the nomination of Caitlin Halligan, certainly one of the most qualified people, man or woman, that we have seen before this Committee in 25, 30 years. But after that filibuster, the DC Circuit has just seven active judges. It has got four continuing vacancies even though they have extraordinarily complex cases. They have a caseload per active judge of 188 pending appeals. We were told that we had to move judges on the First, Third, and Tenth Circuits, as Senator Coons indicated. They have less of a caseload. I would also note, for those who are wondering, that the caseload today per active judge is higher than when Senate Republicans said we had to move forward to confirm President Bush's nominations to the DC Circuit just a few years ago. We were told because of the caseload it was essential that we move President Bush's nominees. It is a greater caseload now. It is time we start moving this one. I thank you, Senator, and I will put the rest of my questions and statement in the record. [The prepared statement of Chairman Leahy appears as a submission for the record.] Senator Coons. Thank you, Chairman Leahy. And at Senator Grassley's suggestion, I will now move to Mr. Srinivasan's home State Senators from the Commonwealth of Virginia to introduce the witness, following which Senator Grassley will make his opening statement. Senator Warner, please proceed. PRESENTATION OF SRIKANTH SRINIVASAN, NOMINEE TO BE CIRCUIT JUDGE FOR THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA CIRCUIT, BY HON. MARK R. WARNER, A U.S. SENATOR FROM THE STATE OF VIRGINIA Senator Warner. Mr. Chairman, although I am not sure I get the etiquette of this, Mr. Chairman, Mr. Ranking Member, and Senator Coons, and Senator Hatch, Senator Schumer, it is an honor for me to introduce my fellow Virginian and President Obama's nominee to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the DC Circuit, Sri Srinivasan. Sri is exceptionally well qualified to carry out the duties and responsibilities of a judge of the U.S. Court of Appeals, as has been mentioned by Senator Coons, one of the most important courts of our land. He has got an exceptional background, exceptional broad bipartisan support. Let me add a few other comments about his background. Sri was born in northern India. His family immigrated to the United States when he was four years old. He did not have-- I can say this since Senator Moran and Senator Roberts are not here right now. He did not have the good sense initially to move to Virginia. He settled initially in Kansas where he became a beloved fan of the KU Jayhawks. Sri, like me, is still an avid basketball player and fan. After earning his bachelor's, J.D., and M.B.A. from Stanford, Sri moved to the Commonwealth to begin his legal career as a law clerk for Judge J. Harvie Wilkinson of the Richmond-based U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit. In addition, Sri clerked for Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, who was quoted as saying she believes he is ``a splendid choice for the appellate court position.'' As has been mentioned already as well, Sri spent time in the Office of the Solicitor General for both President Bush and President Obama and was most recently named Principal Deputy Solicitor General in August 2011. Going through some of his professional recognition, he has been recognized by Chambers USA, Legal 500, Law Dragon, and the Best Lawyers in America as one of the country's leading appellate litigators. He was also named one of the 50 Most Influential Minority Lawyers in America by the National Law Journal and given the Cornerstone Award by the North American South Asian Bar Association. As has also been mentioned, Sri, I think, brings a unique bipartisan support from both Democrats and Republicans. I have already mentioned his support by Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, but recently 12 former top officials in the Solicitor General's Office expressed their support in a letter to this Committee's leadership. And, again, that group included Democrats Walter Dellinger, Republicans Paul Clement, Ted Olson, and Ken Starr. I also want to make one final comment before I turn it over to my good friend, Senator Kaine. I am very proud as well to be co-chair of the India Caucus. If this Committee moves forward on Sri's nomination and we, as I will expect to do, support him on the floor, Sri will be the first South Asian American ever to be nominated to the United States Court of Appeals. And I think he will bring an added both immigrant and unique perspective to the bench and will be a great asset to our legal system and judicial system in America. Thank you. Senator Coons. Thank you, Senator Warner. Senator Kaine. PRESENTATION OF SRIKANTH SRINIVASAN, NOMINEE TO BE CIRCUIT JUDGE FOR THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA CIRCUIT, BY HON. TIM KAINE, A U.S. SENATOR FROM THE STATE OF VIRGINIA Senator Kaine. Thank you, Chairman Leahy, Ranking Member Grassley, Committee Members. It is a treat to be with you today. It is a treat to be here with my colleague, Mark Warner. We were in law school together, Mark and I. I became a lawyer and he became a client. [Laughter.] Senator Kaine. So it is nice to share the same table with him. And it is also wonderful to be here with four Members of the House who have come here to support Sri Srinivasan's nomination: Mike Honda from California, Judy Chu from California, Ami Bera from California, and Grace Meng from New York. And to have you here in support of the nomination is a wonderful thing. I just will begin by saying I care deeply about judges. Deeply about judges. I clerked for an appellate judge on the Eleventh Circuit, Lanier Anderson, who was a wonderful, long- serving member of the appellate court in Georgia. I practiced as a trial and appellate lawyer for 17 years and came before many, many judges. I have been a witness in courtrooms, both as a fact witness and as an expert witness, and observed judges in that capacity. As a city councilman, mayor, Lieutenant Governor, and Governor, I have taken place in the writing of laws and been sued for how the laws have been written. Then I really cared about the quality of the bench in those circumstances. And as Governor of Virginia, I chose judges, trial court judges, and judges on the intermediate court of appeals and two members of the Virginia Supreme Court when the legislature would deadlock in Virginia. Both Governor Warner and I had the chance to choose judges. But the most important thing is I was married to a judge. Now, I am still married to her. She is not a judge anymore, but my wife, Anne, was a juvenile court judge for nine years, and all of those experiences make me care very, very deeply about the caliber, the character, and the skills of those who will occupy any judicial position in this country. And this position on the DC Circuit is incredibly important. As Senator Warner mentioned, Sri Srinivasan is extremely well qualified. Maybe I am biased. As a Kansan who moved to Virginia, he and I have had at least that similarity. But he trained under two very superb appellate judges, and having done an appellate court clerkship with a wonderful judge, Lanier Anderson, you know, that beginning to a professional career for a lawyer is incredibly formative, because you work with somebody and get to learn about judicial temperament and the work ethic that is required. J. Harvie Wilkinson, the former chief judge of the Fourth Circuit, was a judge's judge, somebody deeply admired. I live in Richmond where the Fourth Circuit is headquartered. I practiced in that court. He set a standard for output and work, but also for civility. The Fourth Circuit is an interesting court. If you have ever practiced before it, it is the only appellate court in the country that, after an argument, the judges come down from the bench, and they come down and shake the hands of the attorneys. And that has been a tradition for a very long time that bespeaks a civility and courtesy, and that is a trait that Sri learned and that he has. And then he clerked, obviously, on the Supreme Court with a wonderful jurist, Justice Sandra Day O'Connor. Both Judge Wilkinson and Justice O'Connor, as Senator Warner mentioned, are strongly in support of Sri's nomination. He has had the background of a private practice that has been thriving and diverse, of work for the United States in the Solicitor General's Office, and also as a teacher. And there is nothing that challenges your own thinking more than having to stand up in front of live minds and explain it and get questioned, and Sri has had that experience as well. He has the complete support of all that he has worked with in any of those capacities--Government service, teaching, his work in the clerkship area, work in the Solicitor General's Office--and that speaks highly because lawyers are opinionated people, and usually two lawyers will have three opinions. But if all the lawyers and others he worked with are of a uniform opinion about his credentials, that says something very positive. But the last thing I will say before letting him proceed is that ultimately to be a judge the most important thing is character. There is intellectual training, and there is work ethic. But the challenges that a judge faces, having to make decisions that literally are life and death in many instances, and to remember that it is not about the legal brief and it is not about the presentation of counsel, however skilled they are, but ultimately every case comes down to the lives of individuals to be able to do that with a firmness and with a conviction, but also with a humility and a willingness to learn and a willingness to improve. Those are the kinds of character traits that you want to see in judges, and I believe you may have already had the experience to interact with him, but you will see that he brings that humility--a sense of confidence that is well borne by his experience, but a sense of humility that would equip him well for the awesome task of being a Title III judge with life tenure. You know, life tenure is a wonderful thing, but it can be a challenge as well to maintain a freshness of perspective and a humility in dealing with others. There would be no doubt that Sri Srinivasan would maintain those character traits that have brought him to this point if he is confirmed, and I am glad to be here and support him. Senator Coons. Thank you. Thank you very much, both Senator Warner and Senator Kaine. I know you have a press of other business. We are grateful for your appearance before this Committee today. I would like to turn to Senator Grassley for his opening comments before we swear in the witness. OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. CHUCK GRASSLEY, A U.S. SENATOR FROM THE STATE OF IOWA Senator Grassley. Thank you very much. First of all, I welcome the nominee and his family and friends to the Committee today. This is obviously a very big moment in your career. You and your family should be proud of your nomination. It is quite a significant accomplishment. As I indicated waiting to speak, I have some different views than Senator Coons does on the issue of the circuit, and I would like to express those. But before turning to that, I also want to have an opportunity to do what I do frequently, kind of set the record straight by what I think is a misreading of our actions on the court, and it probably goes back to--on the courts generally--or nominees, I should say. It goes back to something I said to the President after he spoke to our Republican caucus about three weeks ago, and he brought up about judges. And when he shook my hand, I said, ``Do you mean you are not really satisfied that we have approved 178 of your nominees and only disapproved of two?'' And then I brought up that we always get from the other side of the aisle complaints about not moving fast enough. And I said, ``Do you realize out of, I think at that time, maybe about 85 vacancies that there are, that there are 65 that we do not even have the nominations for? Do you realize that we cannot work on your nominees unless you get them up here?'' He says, ``Well, I think I will have to talk to my Democratic colleagues to get the names of their district judges up sooner.'' So that is where I am coming from in the statement I am going to read at this point. There are a number of individuals from the press here today. Based on what I have been reading, there appears to be some confusion about facts, so I want to take a couple of minutes to go over these. Yesterday, the Senate confirmed yet another judicial nominee. That was the tenth judicial nominee was confirmed so far this year, including four circuit court nominees. To put that in perspective, as of today's date in 2005--so this would be a comparable time in the previous Presidency--we had confirmed zero judicial nominees. So, once again, yesterday we confirmed the tenth judicial nominee this year. As of April 10, 2005, the Senate had confirmed zero of President Bush's nominees, and a 10-0 record is one that any President should be proud of. Those ten nominees are on top of the near record-setting 112th Congress. During that Congress, we confirmed 111 of President Obama's judicial nominees. We have to go back 20 years to find a more productive Congress. So today we have confirmed a total of 181 of President Obama's judicial nominees, 171 during the first time and 10 so far this term. During the same time, the Senate has defeated only two nominees. That record now, three weeks passing from the previous figures I gave you, is 181 with two disapprovals. Stated another way, the President has a batting average of .989. I do not know how any President could complain about that kind of an average. Finally, on this subject, I would note that we hear a lot about the vacancy rates. There are currently 86 vacancies for federal courts, but, of course, you never hear the President mention the 62 vacancies that have no nominees that we cannot possibly act upon in the U.S. Senate until they get up here. This is because--and those 62 vacancies represent about 75 percent of the total vacancies. So, to sum up, whether you consider the 10-0 record we have set up so far or the record-setting 112th Congress or the overall record of 181-2, the Senate has been doing its job and doing it quickly. In fact, there is only one record this President should not be proud of, and that is the record he controls, namely, 62 vacancies that have no nominee. Now I would turn to the second point that Senator Coons brought up, discussing the DC Circuit. As most of my colleagues know--and my participation in this goes back to the early 1990s when I was on the only court study committee that the Congress has ever set up to review the activities of the court, so this has been something that has been on my mind for a long time. As most of my colleagues know, the DC Circuit is the least busy circuit in the country. In fact, it ranks last or almost last in nearly every category that measures workload. Based on the 2012 statistics from the Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts, the District Circuit has the fewest number of appeals filed per authorized judgeship with 108. By way of comparison, the Eleventh Circuit ranks with over five times as many appeals filed per authorized judgeship with 583. We have a chart here that shows that. Likewise, the DC Circuit has the fewest appeals terminated per authorized judgeship with 108. By way of comparison, the Eleventh Circuit ranks first with 540 appeals terminated per authorized judgeship. The Second Circuit has the second highest number of appeals terminated per authorized judgeship with 440. And, again, this is four times as many appeals terminated per judgeship than the DC Circuit. The same is true for appeals pending per authorized judgeship in 2012. The DC Circuit has 120 appeals pending per judgeship, which is essentially tied with the Tenth Circuit for the least number of appeals pending per judgeship. By contrast, the Second and Eleventh Circuits have 343 and 323 appeals pending per judgeship. Now, given this imbalance in workload, today I am introducing the Court Efficiency Act. A number of my colleagues are cosponsoring the legislation: Senators Hatch, Sessions, Graham, Cornyn, Lee, Cruz, and Flake. The legislation is very straightforward. It would add a seat to the Second and the Eleventh Circuit. At the same time it would reduce the number of authorized judgeships for the DC Circuit from 11 to 8. If adopted, this legislation would be a significant step forward recognizing disparities between the DC Circuit, the Second, and the Eleventh. Now, I want to make sure that everyone understands what this legislation would do or would not do. First of all, the legislation would not impact the seat of today's nominee. Today's nominee has been nominated to the eighth seat in the DC Circuit, and this legislation would reduce the total number of seats on the DC Circuit from 11 to 8. So, again, this legislation would have no impact on today's nominee. Second, it is important to note that the legislation would take effect upon enactment, meaning legislation introduced in the Senate altering the number of judgeships has often been postponed of enactment until the beginning of the next President's term. Our legislation does not do this. Instead, we have drafted the legislation to take effect immediately. As a result, President Obama would still have the opportunity to make two of these appointments. The only difference is that those appointments would be to the Second and the Eleventh Circuit, where they are needed, rather than to the DC Circuit, where they are clearly not needed. Finally, I would note that this legislation would save taxpayers' dollars. Last Congress, the Congressional Budget Office scored legislation that would have created a number of new district judgeships. The CBO concluded that the costs associated with those new judgeships would be approximately $1 million per year. We do not have the score from the Congressional Budget Office for this bill, but it would certainly be a cost saver. So I urge my colleagues to support this legislation. Thank you very much for your consideration of my time that I---- Chairman Leahy. Well, if I just might note, Mr. Chairman, I appreciate the Senator's concern about getting judges through. There are 13 or 14 pending on the Senate floor right now, almost all of which came out of this Committee unanimously. I would hope that his concern about getting those vacancies filled would mean that we could get them all confirmed this week. We move them very quickly here. I would also note that, of course, it is all in the eye of the beholder. The DC Circuit has a caseload per active judge of 188 pending appeals, not the number shown. And the other thing is when it had less of a caseload but a Republican President, the Republicans fought very much to make sure we confirmed a number of President Bush's nominations. So I do not want to suggest that these numbers show any kind of a partisan difference, but we appear to need the judges with less of a caseload when there is a Republican President. The suggestion is we do not need the judges when there is a Democratic President. And I would also note that if we are concerned about vacancies, we could easily confirm all of these noncontroversial judges that are on the floor. They have been held up for month after month after month after month after month. So, with that, wearing my hat in another Judiciary matter, I will leave, but I know the most important thing is to hear from the nominee. And I look forward to seeing that transcript. Thank you. And I will submit questions for the record. [The questions of Chairman Leahy appear as a submission for the record.] Senator Grassley. Could I please have 15 seconds? Number one, I would like to say when we moved a seat from DC to California, that was in the Bush administration. And I have no hold on any judge that is now on the calendar. Thank you. Chairman Leahy. Well, every single Democrat has agreed to move in the next hour, if they want, on all the judges. The hold, unfortunately, is from the Republican side, but I have found the Senator from Iowa to always be very truthful to me, so I assume he is not the one with a hold, but he may want to talk to the people on his side of the aisle. Senator Coons. I am grateful for the opportunity to proceed to hear from our nominee. I was pleased that the Third Circuit nominee, Patty Shwartz, was recently confirmed, and it is my hope that at the conclusion of today's hearing, we can come to a shared consensus that Mr. Srinivasan would make an excellent member of the DC Circuit. So I would like to invite our nominee, Mr. Srinivasan, to stand. If you would and repeat after me--this is customary for this Committee. Please raise your right hand and repeat after me. Do you solemnly swear that the testimony you are about to give to this Committee will be the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you God? Mr. Srinivasan. I do. Senator Coons. Thank you. Please be seated, and let the record show the nominee has answered in the affirmative. I would like, if I might briefly at the outset, simply to recognize that five Members of the House were also here to lend their support to Mr. Srinivasan's nomination: Members of Congress Judy Chu, Ami Bera, and Mike Honda of California, Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii, and Grace Meng. I would like to invite--Mr. Srinivasan, you are free to deliver either an opening statement or also to welcome and recognize any friends and family who are with you here today. STATEMENT OF SRI SRINIVASAN, NOMINEE TO BE CIRCUIT JUDGE FOR THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA CIRCUIT Mr. Srinivasan. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. I do not have an opening statement, but with the Committee's indulgence, I would like to introduce some people and express some gratitude. Thanks to you and the Committee for convening this hearing. It is a high honor to be here today. I want to thank the Congressmen and Congresswomen who were here earlier. I appreciate their presence as well. I would like to thank Senators Warner and Kaine for their exceptionally gracious opening remarks. I think one can ask for no more than to have remarks like that heard about oneself in the presence of one's mother. [Laughter.] Mr. Srinivasan. And so I got to live that today, which is a wonderful thing. I would like to thank many people who are here today, if I might as well. There are scores of friends from my boyhood days in Kansas to present day and colleagues, both past and present, who are here, and I am really deeply appreciative of their presence, particularly given the busy schedules that they all have. I would like to thank some extended family who are here as well. They, as well as friends and former colleagues, have traveled quite a great distance to be here. And I would like to introduce my immediate family who is here, if I might, to the Committee. My sisters Srija and Srinija are here, and I think anyone who knows them and anyone who sees them today will appreciate that they got a disproportionately favorable allocation of my parents' gene pool. But I have grown accustomed to that over the course of decades, and I am comfortable with it. My brother-in-law, Brad Joondeph, who is Srija's husband, is here, my former law school classmate and former moot court partner; their son, Akhil, is here. Wonderful to have you here. I would like to pay deep respects to my mother, Saroja, who is here with us today. My father, unfortunately, cannot be for health reasons, but we all know that he is here with us in spirit. And last, and most, I would like to introduce the Committee to my twins, Maya and Vikram, and I will say Vikram and Maya as well so they both to get to be mentioned first. [Laughter.] Mr. Srinivasan. They are the lights of my life, and they are going to have to exhibit a great deal of patience today. But I will give them a message that their patience, if it is manifested in the right way, will be rewarded with toys and treats to be negotiated later. [Laughter.] Mr. Srinivasan. With that, thank you very much, and I look forward to answering your questions. [The biographical information of Mr. Srinivasan follows:] [GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT] Senator Coons. Thank you very much. We are going to move to five-minute questioning rounds, and I would also like to ask unanimous consent to enter into the record letters of recommendation that have been received. As I mentioned previously, as former Solicitors General and Principal Deputy Solicitors General, 28 Supreme Court co-clerks from each of the nine Justices, as well as the North American South Asian Bar Association, the Hispanic National Bar Association, and the National Asian Pacific American Bar Association, all of them have submitted for the record letters of recommendation. [The letters of recommendation appear as submissions for the record.] Senator Coons. You have participated in a substantial amount of litigation before the Supreme Court. By my count, your name appears on at least 50 Supreme Court briefs. You have won and lost your share of cases. Many of the cases in which you have participated have dealt with issues, or laws at least, that are likely to be considered or that may come up in your service on the court, should you be confirmed: terrorism, detention, the Alien Tort Statute, the Voting Rights Act, First Amendment. How will you ensure that positions you have developed as an advocate will not unduly influence your judgment if confirmed to this court? Mr. Srinivasan. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I think there is a fundamental point about being a lawyer who takes positions on behalf of the client, and that is that you are duty bound to make arguments that are in service of your client's interests and to zealously advocate on your client's behalf. But one thing that does not factor into that is one's personal views. My personal views have not played a role in the arguments that I have made on behalf of clients across a broad array of cases, as you mentioned, on a broad array of issues. And my personal views certainly would not play a role if I were fortunate enough to be confirmed to the position for which you are considering me today. Senator Coons. Could you just briefly for the Committee describe your judicial philosophy? Mr. Srinivasan. Sure. I guess I would say this, Senator: I do not have an overarching, grand, unified judicial philosophy that I would bring with me to the bench, if I were lucky enough to be confirmed. I guess I approach it, in some sense, from the perspective of a litigator. I have had cases that involve different issues, and what I have tried to do in that capacity is to bring to bear the legal principles, the specific precedents, the other sources of law that are relevant to that particular issue and how you would apply the law to the facts of that specific case. And so it is a case-by-case approach. And I think that is the same kind of approach I would use were I to be confirmed to be a judge. There is no grand, unifying theory. I think the guiding principle to me, though, would be an impartial adherence to the rule of law, and I would try to abide by that principle for every case that would come before me. Senator Coons. The Solicitor General's Office has sometimes been referred to sort of broadly as ``the Tenth Justice'' because the Court relies on that office at times to help it parse really unusually difficult legal issues and to provide the Court as well, of course, with the official legal position of the United States. In many ways, it is a unique role within the legal profession and requires the office to discern the unitary legal position of a decidedly non-unitary political entity. What are some of the challenges you have faced in the Solicitor General's Office in discerning the genuine interest or the needs of your client? Mr. Srinivasan. Thank you, Senator. I guess I will start where you started, which is the notion that the Solicitor General is the Tenth Justice. I think former Solicitor General, Seth Waxman, has poignantly noted that he does not ever recall having a tenth vote, so that is one point to be made. But it is a very high honor to serve in this office. I have served for five Solicitors General in the past. I have been in the office four times. I was a summer intern. I was then a one-year fellow. I came back as an assistant to the Solicitor General under the prior administration, and I am now back in my capacity as a Deputy Solicitor General. And it is an incredible honor and privilege to represent the United States of America before the Supreme Court, and I think some of the sentiments that you have outlined in the question you posed to me are manifested in the role that we have. And we do have a duty of candor and honesty to this Court because we view ourselves to have a long-term relationship with the Court. And our advocacy on behalf of our client is done best when the Court has a strong degree of trust in the arguments that we are presenting, and that is what we strive to do. Senator Coons. What is the role of precedent in making important or difficult legal decisions? And how would you balance the importance of respect for precedent versus personal experience or other sources of information or insight in making difficult judicial decisions? Mr. Srinivasan. I think it is a duty of a judge to abide by precedent. I do not believe that is a negotiable principle. And for the position to which I have been nominated on the Court of Appeals for the DC Circuit, that would, of course, include the precedents of the Supreme Court and also include the precedents of the DC Circuit. And abiding by precedent is an important principle because it promotes predictability and stability in the law, and predictability and stability in the law are things that I think people who are affected by the legal system come to rely on, and certainly parties and advocates before the Court rely on it as well. Senator Coons. Thank you. Senator Grassley. Senator Grassley. I would like to start by asking you a couple questions that you have discussed and knew that I was going to ask, and the purpose is just to get an answer for the record. I will give background for other people that you know about. These questions involve your involvement with the quid pro quo deal where the Justice Department dismissed two False Claims Acts, and these cases were against the city of St. Paul, Minnesota, in exchange for the city dismissing a case where the Department was not a party that was pending before the Supreme Court. If you wonder about my interest in the False Claims Act, I got that legislation passed in 1986, so I follow it pretty closely. My staff has interviewed you related to the issue, so these are the questions: As I understand it, you were the lawyer in the Solicitor General's Office who was primarily responsible for handling the Magner appeal before the Supreme Court. Is that right? Mr. Srinivasan. That is correct. Senator Grassley. Mr. Perez, Assistant Attorney General for the Civil Rights Division, reached out to you in December 2011 and asked--and I am paraphrasing--as a practical matter, how a party would go about withdrawing a case from the Supreme Court. Is that right? Mr. Srinivasan. That is right, Senator. I would like to elaborate on that, if I might, but I do not want to interrupt you. Senator Grassley. Well, I think you should have your right to elaborate. Mr. Srinivasan. I appreciate that. He did put that inquiry to me. If I am recalling the chain of correspondence to which you are referring, I think that inquiry came in the context of a conversation about whether the regulations that were pending and that might be adopted would have an effect on the pendency of the case before the Court. And I believe that is reflected in the correspondence, and it is with that backdrop in mind that we had that exchange. Senator Grassley. Okay. Finally, it is my understanding that you did not know anything about the deal that Mr. Perez struck with the city of St. Paul where he agreed to decline intervention in the False Claims Act in exchange for the city withdrawing Magner from the Supreme Court until after Congress started looking into the matter in August 2012. Is that right? Mr. Srinivasan. I had no knowledge of what you have described. That is correct. Senator Grassley. Okay. You have been deeply involved in the cases regarding the Defense of Marriage Act. You participated in writing briefs as well as oral arguments. Were you also involved in any internal policy or strategy discussions regarding the administration's decision to abandon defense of DOMA? Mr. Srinivasan. Senator, that decision was made and communicated to Congress in February, I believe, of 2011, if I have my year correctly, and I was not in the government at that point. I came on board with the government several months later. Senator Grassley. Okay. Do you agree with the administration's position that no reasonable argument could be made in defense of DOMA's constitutionality? Mr. Srinivasan. Senator, I am hesitant to give any personal views because--for a couple of reasons, if I might. First, my personal views have never been relevant to positions I have taken on behalf of a client, and they would certainly not be relevant to any of my jobs, my fulfillment of my responsibilities were I fortunate enough to be confirmed. But the other thing that is giving me a little bit of pause here is that, of course, these issues are pending before the Supreme Court right now, and I am representing a party before the Court in the capacity as counsel. So I am hesitant to speak to whether I agree or disagree with anything. Senator Grassley. Okay. I am interested in your views on the distinction between enforcing a statute and defending a statute. This was obviously on the minds of the Justices at the recent argument. Can you shed some light on how, if confirmed as a judge, you would at any time in the future approach this issue of enforcing a statute versus defending a statute? Mr. Srinivasan. Senator, it would depend on the particular context in which the issue arose before me. I do not know that I have any blanket rule that I would apply. I guess I would want to listen very, very carefully to the arguments that were presented before me in the context of a particular case. Senator Grassley. Who has the responsibility to ensure that laws are faithfully executed like the Constitution requires? Do the courts have any role to play? Mr. Srinivasan. In assuring that the laws are faithfully executed? Senator Grassley. Yes. Mr. Srinivasan. They have a responsibility to play in adjudicating concrete cases or controversies that are brought before them, and if those concrete cases or controversies involve the execution of the law by the Executive, for example, then they have the responsibility to pronounce on the propriety or impropriety of that under the law. Senator Grassley. When is it appropriate for an administration to enforce a law but not defend it? Mr. Srinivasan. Senator, that issue is before the Supreme Court now, and what I can do is give an account of the position that we have taken on behalf of a client before the Supreme Court. And the arguments that have been made are that the President has the flexibility under the Take Care Clause to make the assessment that the President made in this case, which is that this statute will not be defended, but it will be continued to be enforced out of respect for the Congress that enacted the law, the President that signed it, and out of respect for the role of the judiciary in pronouncing on what the law is. Senator Grassley. If the President fails to enforce a law, what recourse is available to interested parties, the Congress, or the courts? Mr. Srinivasan. If the President fails to enforce the law? Senator Grassley. Yes. Mr. Srinivasan. It would depend, Senator, because in some circumstances in which the President decided not to enforce a law--and, of course, these are going to very rare situations. In some situations, there will be occasions for a case to come before the courts in any event because the law that is not being enforced by the President might become the subject of, for example, a civil suit between two private parties. It is hard to talk about concrete particulars without knowing the precise circumstances, but one could envision that a dispute would, nonetheless, come before the courts in a way that the courts would have an opportunity to pronounce on it. But I think one of the considerations that the President took into account on this occasion is that non-enforcement would have the tendency to make judicial review more difficult, and so he chose to enforce the law out of respect for the judiciary. Senator Grassley. On another point, what is your understanding of the definition of ``quasi-suspect groups'' ? Mr. Srinivasan. Quasi-suspect groups, as I understand it, Senator, is a--it speaks to the level of scrutiny that would be applied under the Equal Protection Clause when assessing a classification, a law that classifies with respect to that group. Senator Grassley. And what scrutiny is afforded those groups? Mr. Srinivasan. A heightened level of scrutiny would be applied to quasi-suspect groups, and if you do not meet quasi- suspect or suspect status, then ordinarily you would trigger rational basis review rather than a heightened level of scrutiny. Senator Grassley. I have just one more question, and I ask this of most every judge dealing with international law. You wrote a brief on behalf of Rio Tinto Limited, arguing that corporations are not liable for violations of international norms relating to human rights. What are your current views on this issue? And how would you approach it if you were confirmed as circuit judge? Mr. Srinivasan. Thank you, Senator. The questions about the scope and applicability of the Alien Tort Statute are currently pending before the Supreme Court in the Kiobel case, and I guess what I can say about that is that decision is likely to come down before the end of this term, and presumably the Court will announce in principles that would be binding on the Court itself and on lower courts. And certainly once we see what the Court held, if I am fortunate enough to be confirmed, I would faithfully apply that precedent. Senator Grassley. Thank you. Mr. Srinivasan. Thank you. Senator Grassley. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Senator Coons. Thank you, Senator Grassley. Senator Whitehouse. Senator Whitehouse. Thank you, Chairman. Welcome. I am delighted that you are here. I intend to support your candidacy. I think you are immensely talented and qualified. My concern at this hearing really has to do with the larger question that we as a Senate face of how we are going to treat judges. Your predecessor was, I think, also--your predecessor in a line-up for the DC Circuit, Caitlin Halligan, I think was also immensely talented and capable, and was filibustered not once but twice. My view of that situation is that we had been operating under an agreement, the Gang of 14 agreement, that held off the nuclear option, so-called, that allowed for a parliamentary maneuver that could bring a candidate before the Senate and produce a simple majority vote. The agreement was that there would be no filibusters of nominees unless there was some extraordinary circumstance. Now, the only thing that was extraordinary about Caitlin Halligan was the amount of her talent. So my view is that the Gang of 14 agreement has now been broken, and that opens the door to, as far as I am concerned, the nuclear option. I regret it because I think that the agreement was a sensible outcome and served the Senate well. But the question is: When one side breaks that agreement, what do you do? Do you ignore it? I do not think we can because they will just continue to break the agreement, and people like you who bring no extraordinary circumstances other than the extraordinariness of your talent to the judiciary end up getting filibustered and defeated. And I do not think that is acceptable. So I am not comfortable. What do you do then with the so- called nuclear option? Does it apply to all matters? Does it apply to all judges, all seats? Does it apply to all courts? My feeling at this point is that I am inclined to view violations of the Gang of 14 agreement and the response to those violations as something that should be cabined court by court. So it would not be my intention to support a nuclear option, parliamentary method to get to a simple majority vote on the Ninth Circuit or on the Eastern District of Virginia district court or anything else. I think that the way I think that we should proceed is that, court by court, as the agreement is violated, it then becomes fair game to pursue whatever parliamentary measures are appropriate with respect to candidates for that court. So I think it is very unfortunate that we had the experience we did with Ms. Halligan. Unless the new normal is orthodox compliance with all right-wing ideology, then there is no case to be made for an extraordinary circumstance in her case. So there we stand. The rule is broken or the agreement is broken. We have to decide what to do about it, and my personal feeling is that what we should do about it is to leave all parliamentary remedies available as to those courts for whom the candidates had that Gang of 14 agreement broken. And I wanted to take my time here, because it is relevant to us, to say that, and I will close by saying that I actually think that this Committee has done a very good job of moving judges along. I think that Ranking Member Grassley, before him Ranking Member Sessions, and previous Ranking Members have moved candidates effectively through the Committee. The problem has always been on the floor. They go into the hostage pool on the floor, and they wait and they wait and they wait and they wait and they wait, and they become pawns in other struggles, and in some cases they never clear at all. So I do not say this with any ill will toward other Members of the Committee, but I do think that you cannot allow agreements to be broken and have there be no consequences. And, on the other hand, you cannot allow the consequences to a broken agreement to be unlimited and unmeasured. And I just want to let my colleagues know where I stand on what I believe is the breaking of the Gang of 14 agreement with respect to the DC Circuit. And I thank you all, and I have no questions for the wonderful candidate. Senator Coons. Thank you, Senator Whitehouse. Senator Hatch. Senator Hatch. Well, thank you, Mr. Chairman. Welcome to the Committee, Sri. We are happy to have you here. You are a very impressive person as far as I am concerned. With regard to the Gang of 14, that did apply to the 109th Congress, not necessarily after that. I do not believe judges should be filibustered, so I am limited when I disagree to vote ``Present,'' which is what I have had to do, and I get criticized for that as well. But the fact of the matter is that I believe that advice and consent means exactly what it says. We can give advice, and our consent is determined by a vote up and down. But, unfortunately, both sides have filibustered. It was started by Democrats, and Republicans have taken it up as well. In one of the cases you argued before the Supreme Court while in private practice was Hosanna-Tabor v. EEOC. You argued that employment discrimination laws applied to religious organizations in exactly the same way that they do to secular ones. At least that is the way I interpreted it. The Supreme Court voted 9-0 to reject your view, calling it ``untenable.'' In fact, the Chief Justice wrote, ``That result is hard to square with the text of the First Amendment itself....We cannot accept the remarkable view that the Religion Clauses have nothing to say about a religious organization's freedom to select its own ministers.'' Now, under your view--the Court unanimously said the First Amendment provides no more protection to a religious organization than to a labor union or a social club. Now, to be candid, your position in this case really troubles me. And if America's founders thought religious liberty so important that they put multiple protections explicitly in the First Amendment, why would that not trump a statute? Mr. Srinivasan. Senator, thank you. Of course, in the Hosanna-Tabor case, that was a position that we advanced on behalf of our client. Senator Hatch. Right. Mr. Srinivasan. And my personal views do not play a role in the positions I advance on behalf of my clients, and I will just start by saying---- Senator Hatch. But can you actually advance something for which you have no real belief? Mr. Srinivasan. Well, I think it is a duty of a lawyer, Senator, to advance the arguments that are best designed to bring about a favorable result for the client. Senator Hatch. Well, is it a duty of a lawyer, knowing that a client murdered somebody, to advance a case that the client is innocent? Mr. Srinivasan. I would not want to engage in a hypothetical about a criminal case that I was not involved in. I guess what I would say---- Senator Hatch. What would be your personal views, then? Mr. Srinivasan. What I would say is this, Senator, with respect to the Hosanna-Tabor case. As the Supreme Court itself explained in its opinion, the question of whether there is a ministerial exception, which was the issue in the case, was an open one before the Supreme Court decided that case. The Court explained that---- Senator Hatch. You believe it was a case of first impression? Mr. Srinivasan. I believe that issue was an issue of first impression before the Supreme Court. The courts of appeals had pronounced on it, but the Supreme Court had not had occasion to pronounce on it. And the Supreme Court explained at the outset of its opinion that its prior precedents did not establish a rule one way or the other. And it reached the conclusion that there was a ministerial exception, and, of course, that was to the detriment of my client. But we presented the arguments before the Court that we thought were best designed to bring about a favorable result on our client's behalf. Senator Hatch. Well, let us say that your personal views were that this is bunk. Would you still advance the interests of that client before the Court? Mr. Srinivasan. I am sorry. I did not quite hear the question. If I---- Senator Hatch. Well, that you disagreed with what the client's position was, but you felt obligated as an attorney to argue the client's position. Would you have argued that? Mr. Srinivasan. I argue positions before courts on behalf of clients without regard to my personal views, and that is the same philosophy I would take to the bench. And with respect to the Hosanna-Tabor decision in particular, of course, now that we know the position of the Supreme Court on that and we have a holding, that precedent, like any precedent of the Supreme Court, is one that I would seek to apply very faithfully if an issue of that variety were to come before me were I to be confirmed. Senator Hatch. Okay. Let me ask one other question. Let me tell you what bothers me about your office refusing to the support the Defense of Marriage Act, which was passed overwhelmingly by both Houses of Congress and bipartisan votes. Now, the reasonable arguments you had a duty to make to defend this statute include the legal standard that would help the Court uphold it. Your office, in fact, made that very argument in other cases defending DOMA, by the way. But then you instead started arguing for a legal standard that would help the Court strike down DOMA, the Defense of Marriage Act. It looked like you had changed clients and were making this move based more on political considerations than on your institutional duty. Am I wrong to look at it that way? Mr. Srinivasan. I believe so, Senator, with respect. I was not in the government at the time that the prior arguments were made. I came on board in the government by a time at which the President had made the determination that heightened scrutiny applied to the Defense of Marriage Act and that the law did not withstand scrutiny under that standard. And that is the argument that we have been presenting. Senator Hatch. Mr. Chairman, may I ask just one more question? Listen, I am really impressed with you. I think you are terrific. Mr. Srinivasan. Thank you. Senator Hatch. And as of right now, some of these things bother me, but I want to support you. Let me just ask one more question. You bring a record of advocacy to this confirmation process. Great lawyers can make great judges. Do not get me wrong. But I also see judges who never stop being advocates. You have had that experience, I bet. I have had it. They continue to find ways of achieving results for their clients. Now, I really am concerned about this. I remember when a Senator on this Committee repeatedly asked a Supreme Court nominee whose side he would be on in different kinds of cases. By the way, I have been asking similar questions. Lawyers take sides. But I never thought that judges should. How would you shift from being an advocate for a particular answer to a judge responsible for finding the right answer? Mr. Srinivasan. Senator, thank you. I am deeply appreciative of the rule of law, fidelity to the rule of law and the importance of having fidelity to the rule of law. And I guess what I would say about the differences between the role of an advocate and the role of a judge is this: that an advocate is duty bound to be partial. In some ways, partiality is the name of the game when you are an advocate. I think things shift radically when you become a judge, if I am fortunate enough to be confirmed. At that point the duty is impartiality. And I am deeply appreciative of that, and I can assure you that, if I were to be confirmed, I would have an impartial adherence to the rule of law. And I do believe that my advocacy on behalf of a broad array of clients on a broad array of issues expressing a broad array of perspectives has left me very, very open-minded, and to me, open-mindedness and objectivity are the key principles of judicial action, and I would seek to abide by that. Senator Hatch. Does that philosophy justify advocating for something in which you do not have any belief? Mr. Srinivasan. I am sorry. As a lawyer? Senator Hatch. As a lawyer. Mr. Srinivasan. I believe lawyers are bound to make arguments that are designed to bring about a favorable result for the client as long as they are professionally responsible arguments. And, of course, every argument that a lawyer makes in court has to be a professionally responsible one, and I hope that I and believe that I have adhered to that standard. Senator Hatch. Do you believe a lawyer can take on a case that literally he does not believe in but give every effort toward advocacy in that case? Mr. Srinivasan. Well, I think what would have to happen in that situation, Senator, is the lawyer would have to ask him- or herself some really hard questions about whether they are ideally positioned to take on that case, because if they have a strength of a belief that calls into question their ability to be an effective advocate on the client's behalf, I think they are probably best serving their client--their would-be client would be best served by having the representation go elsewhere. So I agree with you, Senator, that a lawyer has to have the ability to put aside one's personal beliefs to an extent that enables him or her to be an effective advocate on behalf of his client. Senator Hatch. Can I just ask one more, if I could? I am taking advantage. I apologize. Mr. Srinivasan. Not at all. Senator Coons. The Senator from Utah is---- Senator Franken. I have to go now, so---- Senator Hatch. Well, if you have to go, I will be glad to defer. I just have one last question. Senator Franken. I will try to come back. Senator Hatch. Look, I will defer. Senator Coons. Senator Franken, if you---- Senator Hatch. I am sorry that that occurred, because I would have easily deferred. But let me just ask you one other question. Here is a contrast to consider. Look, I am impressed. I have been impressed. I was impressed before I came here. I wanted to see you and see what you are like. I can see your lovely family. You are clearly a very good advocate, a very good lawyer. I think highly of you, and I am very likely to support you. But these are legitimate questions, and they are good questions that really may make your trip through this process a little bit easier. Now, here is a contrast to consider. On the one hand, we had an appeals court nominee before this Committee a few years ago who had written that the Constitution's meaning can be found in such things as evolving social norms and practices and changing cultural understandings. On the other hand, a federal appeals court recently held this: ``When interpreting a constitutional provision, we must look to the natural meaning of the text as it would have been understood at the time of the ratification of the Constitution.'' Now, one way maximizes a judge's control over the Constitution, while the other way minimizes it, in my opinion. In general, which of these two would better identify your own view? Mr. Srinivasan. Senator, I think the latter rather than the former, and I would be guided by Supreme Court precedent on the method of constitutional interpretation. And as I understand those Supreme Court precedents, they tend toward the latter approach, and I am thinking of decisions like Heller, for example, that I would look to in outlining how one is supposed to go about applying particular provisions of the Constitution. But first and foremost, Senator, I would be guided by precedent. Senator Hatch. I think that is very good. Mr. Chairman, I apologize. I got you in a little difficulty there. But I think somebody who has been on this Committee for 37 years, and when we are the only ones here, I really should be able to ask some pertinent questions that might help your confirmation process. Mr. Srinivasan. Thank you, Senator. I think part of having a judicial temperament is knowing when not to talk, and this may be one of those occasions. [Laughter.] Senator Hatch. Now, are you referring to me or you? [Laughter.] Mr. Srinivasan. No. Me. Me. Just me. Senator Hatch. Congratulations for this nomination. I think you are going to make a great circuit court of appeals judge, and I intend to support you based upon what we are talking about here. There are differences between being an advocate and a judge, and I think you understand them. Mr. Srinivasan. Absolutely. Senator Hatch. Thanks so much. Good to see you. Mr. Srinivasan. Thank you. Senator Hatch. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Senator Coons. Thank you, Senator Hatch. And if I might for a moment, before we turn to Senator Lee, just on this broader point, you have worked for, advocated for a very broad range of clients in a very broad range of cases. There are other religion cases--U.S. v. Trunk--where almost exactly the opposite, if one were to ascribe to some position, you have got clients on whose behalf you have worked that have quite different views. There are some on the left who have also raised concerns about your attempts to establish on behalf of a client that corporations cannot be held liable under the Alien Tort Statute or for the Torture Victims Protection Act. I know of the importance of these. I disagree with the positions advocated in Rumsfeld v. Padilla that the President has an inherent right--an inherent authority, excuse me, to detain a U.S. citizen captured on U.S. soil indefinitely as part of the war on terror. But in my view, I do not think these positions are any reason to oppose your nomination because a lawyer's arguments on behalf of a client should not be arguments which are then confused with the beliefs of the lawyer. And I hope my colleagues will take that into account in reflecting on your nomination. So if I might, Senator Lee. Senator Lee. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. And with your leave, Mr. Chairman, I have got a brief written statement that I would like to submit in regard to the DC Circuit caseload issue that was being discussed at the beginning of the hearing. Senator Coons. Without objection. Senator Lee. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. [The prepared statement of Senator Lee appears as a submission for the record.] Senator Lee. And thank you very much, Mr. Srinivasan, for joining us and for your family joining us as well. Mr. Srinivasan. Thank you. Senator Lee. In a 2008 op-ed, you wrote that an Indiana law requiring voter photo identification exists to prevent a type of fraud that appears to be imaginary. Later in that same op-ed in 2008, you argued that independent courts should not leave to legislators the final word on the rules by which legislators themselves are elected or, alternatively, ousted. At a time when partisan suspicion about the electoral process is potentially corrosive, the court needs to exercise its independent judgment about laws such as Indiana's and guard against unfair burdening of the right to vote. Do you still believe that in-person voter ID fraud is imaginary, as you described it in 2008? Mr. Srinivasan. Senator Lee, if I could just place that article in context, if I might. That article, as the description of the authors indicate, was done on behalf of--in our capacity as lawyers advocating on behalf of a client. I believe that article came out on the day of oral argument, if I am not mistaken, and it was a continuation of the representation that we had undertaken in connection with that case. We had written a brief on behalf of a number of groups challenging the constitutionality of the voter ID law in particular that was at issue. And the submission of that article was part and parcel of that representation. So I would view that article through the lens of a lawyer acting as an advocate on behalf of a client and would not read into it anything more than that. With respect to the arguments we made in the brief and then reiterated in that article, I would just make two points. One is that our brief made clear that there is a compelling interest in stamping out voter fraud. There is that compelling interest. The point we were making on behalf of our client in that case was that there was a particular species of voter fraud that was implicated by the Indiana law, what you accurately described as in-person impersonation fraud. And the point we were making was that that species of voter fraud had not been seen as a matter of historical record in the State of Indiana. And I would just note that the lead opinion for the Supreme Court in the Crawford case, which is the opinion, obviously, that resulted from this, noted that in the history of Indiana there had been no recorded instances of in-person impersonation fraud. And then they noted that there had been--I think they described it as ``scattered instances'' elsewhere, and the Court, of course, went on to uphold the facial constitutionality of the statute against the argument we were making. Senator Lee. Now four and a half or five years later, where you are not representing that client at the moment, we are having a conversation here, do you regard voter fraud as an imaginary problem? Mr. Srinivasan. Voter fraud is not, Senator Lee, and I think even at that point, the point we made in our brief was that voter fraud is something as to which there is a compelling governmental interest in stamping out. And I would say this as an add-on, which is that the Supreme Court, of course, remanded its decision in the Crawford case, sustaining the facial constitutionality of that law. And I would abide by that decision like I would abide by any other precedent of the Supreme Court. Senator Lee. Okay. You also commented in that same article that even a minimal impact on voters is too much to justify a photo ID law. I question whether this prescribes a judicially manageable standard. I mean, who and how would you determine or define what a ``minimal impact'' is? Mr. Srinivasan. It is a very fair question, Senator Lee, and, candidly, if you look at the opinion that came from the Court in the Crawford case, if I am remembering correctly, it prescribed a balancing approach where you balance the burden against the interests that are advanced by the law. And so I think it is just incumbent upon the parties before the Court to explain how those considerations are balanced in the context of a specific case. But I do not think that what emerges from that is a black-and-white rule that is readily applicable to any context. Senator Lee. Okay. So I think I am understanding you. I think what you are saying is you would not disagree with me if I were to say that is not a shining example of a judicially manageable standard. Mr. Srinivasan. I guess given my current role as an advocate on behalf of the United States before the Supreme Court, I am hesitant to---- Senator Lee. Understood. Mr. Srinivasan [continuing]. Characterize the Supreme Court decision. I just meant that the standard they prescribed was a balancing approach. Senator Lee. Understood. Earlier you were asked whether you have a judicial philosophy, and you sort of indicated that you do not necessarily have a judicial philosophy. But does this mean that you would not consider yourself a textualist? Or if you do not consider yourself a textualist, what do you consider yourself? An intentionalist or a purposivist? Any of those ``insider tradings''? [Laughter.] Mr. Srinivasan. I think some people may have ``ist'' descriptions of me. But I guess I do not know that I have one description that I would apply as an overarching approach. Senator Lee. Not even a textualist? Mr. Srinivasan. Well, textualism certainly, Senator Lee, in the following sense: that if you are talking about interpreting a statute, we are engaged in the enterprise of statutory interpretation, absolutely first and foremost one starts with the text of the statute, and one may end with the text of the statute. I think that is set forth in Supreme Court precedent, and I would apply that precedent faithfully, look to the words to try to divine what Congress' intent was, and very often the words are going to be the beginning and the end of the answer. Senator Lee. Okay. I understand my time has expired, but I do want to follow up on this one thought to make sure I grasp your answer there. When you say one starts with the text and one may end with the text, can you tell me in what circumstances you would not start and stop with the text? Mr. Srinivasan. Well, for example, one context might be where an administrative agency is implementing a law, and so you would look to the text of the statute to determine whether what the agency is doing is within the scope of reasonableness. And if the agency is doing that, then under the Chevron decision and under its progeny and the applicable decisions of the DC Court of Appeals, I think you would also look to what the agency has done by way of, for example, the regulation that is at issue. That is one example. Senator Lee. But in circumstances like that, you would start and stop with the text, assuming there is no ambiguity? Mr. Srinivasan. Assuming there is no ambiguity. Senator Lee. Regardless of contrary indications with regard to the intent. Mr. Srinivasan. Yes. Assuming no ambiguity, yes, absolutely. Senator Lee. Thank you. Senator Coons. Senator Cruz. Senator Cruz. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you, Mr. Srinivasan, for being here. I want to thank your family and, in particular, commend the twins for doing a very fine job of sitting through the hearing. I would note that you and I have known each other a long time, that we clerked together in the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals, and we have been friends a long time, so I am hopeful that our friendship will not be seen as a strike against you by some. [Laughter.] Mr. Srinivasan. Thank you. Senator Cruz. So I appreciate your diligence in answering the questions here today. I would like to ask you some questions about how you would approach the job of being a judge and start by asking how you would define ``judicial activism.'' Mr. Srinivasan. I think, Senator, that is a term that has many meanings. To me, what it means is the injection of personal views into judicial decision making, and it is something that judges obviously ought not do, and it is something that certainly I would strive not to do and I believe would not do. Senator Cruz. What role do you think originalism should play in interpreting the Constitution? Mr. Srinivasan. Senator, I would be guided by Supreme Court precedent on the application of originalism, and we have certainly seen originalism of sorts applied in a variety of contexts by the Court, and the Heller opinion is an example of that. I think Crawford may be another example of that. And I would be guided by those precedents and would faithfully adhere to them if issues of that variety were to come before me if I were to be confirmed. Senator Cruz. Do you ascribe to the concept of a living Constitution? Mr. Srinivasan. That term probably has a lot of freight associated with it, and I think in the way that I assume, Senator, with respect to your asking the question, I would say no, that the Constitution has an enduring fixed quality to it. And it is one of the geniuses of the Constitution. And I would certainly view the task of constitutional interpretation in that way. Senator Cruz. In your judgment, what role, if any, should international law play in constitutional adjudication? Mr. Srinivasan. The Constitution is a domestic document with domestic text and domestic structure, and I would look to the text and structure of the Constitution itself in carrying out the task of constitutional interpretation. Senator Cruz. Does that mean that you do not think international law should be deemed relevant, controlling, vis- a-vis constitutional interpretation? Mr. Srinivasan. There are going to be situations, Senator, I think, in which international law would have a role. For example, if there was a question concerning the President's exercise of military authority and you would inform the exercise of that authority by looking to international law of war principles, international law may play a role. But as a general matter, international law would not have certainly dispositive weight, probative weight. I think sometimes we see international law in opinions of the Supreme Court as having kind of a confirming quality for a conclusion that has been reached based on analysis of the text and the structure of the Constitution. And I would look carefully at the Supreme Court decisions that were most applicable and apply them. Senator Cruz. There has been a longstanding debate both on the U.S. Supreme Court and on the court to which you have been nominated about the role of legislative history in assessing the import of a statute. What do you think is the proper role of legislative history in judicial decision making? Mr. Srinivasan. With that as well, Senator, with the role of legislative history, I would be guided by precedent. I would look to Supreme Court precedent and applicable precedent of the DC Circuit to determine in the circumstances in which legislative history plays a role. And I know that there are differing views on the part of the Justices on the Supreme Court, on the relevance of legislative history, and exactly in what circumstances, what type of legislative history may be particularly probative. But I would look to those precedents as a guidepost in going about the task of understanding what Congress' intent was. Senator Cruz. What is your view of stare decisis? And, in particular, in what circumstances would you be prepared to vote to overrule a precedent of the DC Circuit? Mr. Srinivasan. Well, certainly there would be no capacity to overrule a precedent of the DC Circuit if one is sitting as a panel member. That precedent is binding. And so the question I think would only arise if there were a panel decision and then the court were to take that issue en banc. And if the court were to take the issue en banc, then I think I would apply the principles of stare decisis as set forth by the Supreme Court and the DC Circuit, which is that there has to be a very healthy respect for precedent because of the importance of predictability and stability in the administration of law. And there are only narrow circumstances in which precedent might be overruled: if it has become unworkable, if there are intervening decisions that have called the prior precedent into question, if it has become impracticable, if the legal foundation of the decision has been eroded. But those are very narrow situations, and I think the Supreme Court has set forth that stare decisis is highly, highly important and we ought to abide by precedent in the mine run of situations. Senator Cruz. A final question. You had an exchange with Senator Lee about the Crawford case in which you represented an amicus. I am curious. Was that representation paid representation or pro bono representation? Mr. Srinivasan. Oh, there are two Crawford cases. Sorry. The---- Senator Cruz. The voter ID case. Mr. Srinivasan. The voter ID case, not the Confrontation Clause case. Senator Cruz. Yes. Mr. Srinivasan. The Crawford voter ID case was a pro bono representation when I was with my law firm. Senator Cruz. And what factors went into your decision to represent that client on a pro bono basis since that is sort of typically different factors from being hired by a client to represent them? Mr. Srinivasan. Senator, I do not remember the particulars. If I am recalling correctly, though, I believe that representation was already in place. It was right when I rejoined the firm. I believe that representation was already in place when I came to the firm, and I was asked to work on the case. So it is a little bit different from a situation in which it came to me initially. But I think taking on pro bono representations, as with other representations, there is a process within the firm to assure that it is in the interests of the firm to take on the representation and there are no conflicts with existing firm clients and things of that nature. But one thing that did not factor into it, whether it is a pro bono representation or a paying representation from my own perspective, was my personal views. Senator Cruz. I thank you for a very fine job you are doing. Mr. Srinivasan. Thank you, Senator. Senator Coons. Senator Flake. Senator Flake. Thank you, and thank you for being here. I would ask you about some of the Arizona immigration cases, but I know you are arguing on behalf of a client there, and I will get the same answer, so I appreciate that. Mr. Srinivasan. Thank you. [Laughter.] Senator Flake. I will be short here. In Federalist Paper 51, James Madison wrote, ``In framing a Government which is to be administered by men over men, the great difficulty lies in this: you must first enable the Government to control the governed: and in the next place oblige it to control itself.'' In what ways do you believe our Constitution places limits on government? Just a general question. Mr. Srinivasan. The Constitution places limits on government in a number of ways, Senator. Of course, the enumeration of powers that are allocated to the government, for example, with Congress in Article I, itself has a limiting quality about it, because when Congress enacts a law, it needs to be consistent with the scope of the authority that is granted to it by Article I. The Bill of Rights and constitutional amendments impose constraints on the lawmaking power, and, of course, the First Amendment imposes limits on government. The Tenth Amendment has been brought into play as well. And so the Constitution as a whole has a variety of mechanisms through which it imposes constraints on the Federal Government, which is what I assumed to be the direction of your question. Senator Flake. And the role of the judicial branch in that orbit? Mr. Srinivasan. The role of the judicial branch, I think, is with a very, very healthy amount of respect for the democratic process, to police those boundaries. And so when the issue comes before the courts in a concrete case or controversy, which itself is a constitutional limitation imposed by Article III, when an issue presents itself to the court in a concrete case or controversy and that issue concerns whether the government has transgressed its power by, for example, enacting a law, it is the role of the judiciary, with a healthy amount of respect for the Congress and for the democratic process, to make sure that Congress acted within its allocated bounds. Senator Flake. Thank you. That is all I have, Mr. Chairman. Senator Coons. Thank you, Senator. I am looking for some guidance on whether there are other Members of the Committee who are on their way. I have got plenty of questions, so we may--if you might indulge me for a few more minutes. I was struck in looking through your extensive resume of Supreme Court litigation, as I referenced before, that you have represented a very broad range of clients, but you have also, frankly, lost your fair share of cases in---- Mr. Srinivasan. Thank you for the reminder. [Laughter.] Senator Coons. Humility is always a good thing in public service. How important is it to you to be right? And if you were outvoted on a three-judge panel, does that mean to you in any way that your legal analysis or your position was wrong? Mr. Srinivasan. Well, Senator, I guess when you do not prevail in a case, you always ask yourself whether you did the best job you could have on behalf of your client. And you look at the opinion, and you are rendered quite humbled by it. But you look first and foremost to assess whether you did your job in the best way, and you try to learn from it. I think there are situations in which the hand you have been dealt is such that it is a hand with which you cannot win, and I take some solace in that and hope at least some of the adverse results that have befallen me and my clients in the past are attributable to that. But I would acknowledge that there are undoubtedly situations in which arguments could have been made that maybe were not presented in the best possible way, and certainly we regret the extent to which that has happened. But it is very informative for the judicial role because I think the judicial role depends deeply on vigorous, effective advocacy by both competing sides to a controversy. And it is impossible to do one's task in a good way unless you get the benefit of that. And certainly if I were fortunate enough to be confirmed, I would be hopeful that I would see that. Senator Coons. Let me ask one other question, if I might. I see my colleague Senator Hirono is just arriving. In two different cases, the issue of whether a State law implicating immigration policy has been preempted was at issue. In the first, I believe you represented a group of businesses in Chamber of Commerce v. Whiting in which you--unsuccessfully, forgive me--argued against an Arizona State law that rescinded State licensure for businesses employing undocumented workers. And then two years later, in Arizona v. U.S., the Supreme Court invalidated another Arizona State law that, among other things, made it a crime for an undocumented worker to apply for a job. Different cases, different standards. Can you just help me square those two rulings, if possible? Mr. Srinivasan. Sure, Senator. I was not a meaningful contributor, I would say, on the second case, and that is out of due respect to the attorneys in the Solicitor General's Office who largely won that victory. I do not want to take credit for something in which I was not really involved. I was recused from a major portion of those proceedings, so I am not as familiar with that as I might. But---- Senator Coons. In Arizona v. U.S.? Mr. Srinivasan. In Arizona v. U.S., yes, that is correct. But they involve different statutes, as I recall, because the first case, the Chamber of Commerce v. Whiting case, dealt exclusively with the question of employment, and that involved both an express preemption question and an implied preemption question under IRCA, the Immigration Reform and Control Act, I believe, and the Arizona v. United States case that came along did not involve, as I recall, that statute in particular but involved a different set of considerations. And the Court concluded that at least as to three of the four Arizona provisions at issue in that case that they were preempted by federal law. Senator Coons. Thank you. Senator Schumer. Senator Schumer. Well, thank you, Mr. Chairman. It is good to see you as Mr. Chairman. I know you are Chairman in a few places. And so you will be Madam Chair if you are not already, the Senator from Hawaii. Anyway, it is great to be here, and I want to thank our witness for being here. First I want to say a few words. I want to first say to our witness, after watching the shameful treatment of the last DC Circuit nominee we had before the Senate, a New Yorker, Caitlin Halligan, it is fair to say you are brave to put yourself through this process, and we are all grateful for your bravery. Now, I thought what happened to Caitlin Halligan was a tragedy. She was exceptionally well qualified, moderate. Opponents of her nomination cherrypicked her long and distinguished record looking for reasons to oppose her, not because of her personally, in my judgment, but because they wanted to see the DC Circuit empty until they could get nominees more to their liking. This circuit has only seven of 11 people on it. It is a vital circuit. And, in my view--and I will speak frankly--I think the hard right wants to use the DC Circuit to undo all kinds of government decisions. We have seen the DC Circuit strike at environmental laws as they have knocked out EPA laws. We have seen them strike at financial laws as they put great limits untold from before on the SEC. We have seen them strike at the NLRB with their recent ruling on recess appointments. And to have four vacancies on the DC Circuit, to have President Obama, who is in his fifth year in office, not have a single nominee confirmed, not even an up-or-down vote on a single nominee to the second highest court in the land, is wrong. And I would simply say to my colleagues on the other side of the aisle, we came to an agreement about not filibustering, not using the filibuster, except in unusual and extreme circumstances. We came to that agreement explicitly with the Gang of 14 several years back. That actually filled the DC Circuit with two very conservative nominees who are still sitting there today. And then we came de facto wh"
