        "text": "Overview of the judicial appointment controversies of Barack Obama\n\nU.S. President Barack Obama nominated over 400 individuals for federal judgeships during his presidency. Of these nominations, Congress confirmed 329 judgeships, 173 during the 111th & 112th Congresses[1] and 156 during the 113th and 114th Congresses.[2]\n\nRepublicans successfully blocked some confirmations, either by filibuster or voting against cloture, even while the Democratic caucus held a Senate majority (2009–2015). Senator Chuck Grassley, then-ranking Republican on the judiciary, said that more nominees could have been considered if not for the January 2012 National Labor Relations Board recess appointments;[3] the Supreme Court later unanimously ruled these January 2012 appointments illegal in NLRB v. Noel Canning.[4]\n\nIn response, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid invoked the so-called parliamentary nuclear option on November 21, 2013, which changed the Senate's confirmation threshold for all executive nominees except for the Supreme Court.[5] While Senate confirmations of Obama judicial nominees rose in 2014 following the \"nuclear option,\" the greatest number of rejection of Obama nominees occurred following the 2014 United States Senate elections, where the Republicans gained nine seats and majority control of the chamber. Obama ultimately nominated 70 individuals for 104 different federal judgeships during this Congress, with 20 confirmations.[6]\n\nWith the death of Antonin Scalia in February 2016 in the beginning of a presidential election year, the Republican majority in the Senate made it their stated policy to refuse to consider any nominee to the Supreme Court, arguing that the next president should be the one to appoint Scalia's replacement.[7] Obama nominated Merrick Garland for the open Supreme Court seat, but the Senate did not consider the nomination.\n\nList of unsuccessful federal judicial nominations\n\n[edit]\n\nObama made 80 nominations for federal judgeships that were not confirmed by the Senate. Of these, 7 were withdrawn by Obama, while the other 73 expired at an adjournment of the Senate, including 54 that were pending at the close of the 114th Congress. As of December 4, 2023, 23 of his unsuccessful nominees had been nominated to federal judgeships by subsequent presidents, with 22 of them having been confirmed.\n\nNominee Court Nomination\n\ndate Date of\n\nfinal action Final action Subsequent federal judicial nominations Seat filled by Ref.

At the time of his nomination, Garland was the Chief Judge of the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. Scalia's death led to an unusual situation in which a Democratic president had the opportunity to appoint a Supreme Court nominee while the Republicans controlled the United States Senate; before Scalia's death; such a situation last occurred when a Senate Republican majority confirmed Grover Cleveland's nomination of Rufus Wheeler Peckham in 1895.[111] While Garland himself was not personally controversial, Scalia was considered one of the more conservative members of the Supreme Court. Political and legal commentators noted that a more liberal replacement could shift the Court's ideological balance for many years into the future, as the confirmation of Garland would have given Democratic appointees a majority on the Supreme Court for the first time since the Harry Blackmun's confirmation in 1970.[112]\n\nFollowing Scalia's death, Republican Senate leaders announced that they did not plan to consider any Supreme Court nomination during the president's last year in office, citing the upcoming 2016 United States presidential election.[113] Senate Democrats argued that there was sufficient time to vote on a nominee before the election.[114] Garland's nomination ultimately expired on January 3, 2017, with the end of the 114th Congress. The nomination remained before the Senate for 293 days,[115] the longest such nomination in American history Supreme Court nomination.[116]\n\nOn January 31, 2017, President Donald Trump announced his selection of Judge Neil Gorsuch for the open Supreme Court seat. Gorsuch was confirmed on April 7, 2017, by a Republican-majority Senate, 54–45[117] and sworn in on April 10, 2017.[118]\n\nFailed, stalled or filibustered appellate nominations\n\n[edit]\n\nFailed nominations\n\n[edit]\n\nUnited States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit\n\nRobert Chatigny (of Connecticut), to seat vacated by Guido Calabresi: during the 111th Congress, Connecticut Senator Chris Dodd recommended Chatigny for a judgeship on the Second Circuit,[119] and he was nominated by President Obama on February 24, 2010.[120] Critics of Chatigny's nomination highlighted his controversial performance during the trial of serial killer Michael Bruce Ross, for whom Chatigny granted a temporary stay of execution.[121] In addition, opponents cited a 2001 ruling declaring that a sex offender registration system violated a convict's civil rights and right to privacy, a ruling that drew bipartisan condemnation.[122] His nomination was returned by the Senate on August 5, 2010, and Dodd, his main sponsor, did not seek reelection to the U.S. Senate that year. Chatigny removed his name from consideration[123] and was not renominated.[119] Obama ultimately chose U.S. District Judge Christopher F. Droney to fill the seat, and the Senate confirmed Droney without opposition on November 28, 2011.[124]\n\nUnited States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit\n\nGoodwin Liu (of California), to newly created seat: Liu was nominated on February 24, 2010.[120] His nomination was returned by the Senate on August 5, 2010.[125] Liu had faced opposition from Republicans who described him as an \"extreme liberal\" because of his outspoken support of same-sex marriage and affirmative action,[125] and his 2008 article advocating for Constitutional protection of welfare benefits.[126][127] He was also denounced for his personal criticism of the Supreme Court nominations of John Roberts and Samuel Alito,[128] and his consideration as a possible Supreme Court candidate.[128] Liu was renominated at the start of the 112th Congress. On May 17, 2011, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid filed for cloture on Liu's nomination, with 60 votes needed to proceed to a floor vote on Liu's nomination; the cloture motion attracted only 52 of the 60 aye votes required. On May 25, 2011, Liu wrote to Obama requesting that his nomination be withdrawn due to the improbability that he would receive a floor vote.[129] On July 26, 2011, Governor Jerry Brown nominated Liu to a seat on the Supreme Court of California,[130] and he was sworn in on September 1, 2011.[131] Obama nominated U.S. District Judge Jacqueline Nguyen to the Ninth Circuit seat to which Liu had been nominated,[132] and the Senate confirmed her without opposition on May 7, 2012.[133]\n\nUnited States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit\n\nEdward C. DuMont: DuMont was nominated to the Federal Circuit on April 14, 2010.[134] If confirmed, DuMont would have been the first openly gay United States appeals court judge.[135] The Senate Judiciary Committee did not schedule a hearing on the nomination despite holding hearings and votes for two later nominees to the same court. A spokesperson for Senator Chuck Grassley, the ranking Republican on the committee, said in August 2011 only that \"There are questions in Mr. DuMont's background investigation that have to be resolved.\"[136] In November 2011, the National Law Journal reported that DuMont had submitted a letter to President Obama, asking that the president withdraw his nomination because one or more senators of the minority party on the Committee refused to allow the committee to give him a hearing; Obama withdrew DuMont's nomination later that day.[137] In November 2011, Obama nominated Richard G. Taranto to the seat to which DuMont had been nominated, and the Senate confirmed him without opposition on March 11, 2013.\n\nUnited States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit\n\nVictoria F. Nourse (of Wisconsin), to a seat vacated by Terence T. Evans: Nourse, a former counsel for the U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee, was recommended by Senator Russ Feingold[138] After defeating Senator Feingold in the 2010 midterm elections, newly elected Senator Ron Johnson blocked Nourse's nomination.[139] Nourse was not renominated. Obama nominated Donald Karl Schott, who was approved by the Judiciary Committee but did not receive a vote on the floor. The seat was ultimately filled in 2018 by President Trump nominee Michael B. Brennan.\n\nMyra C. Selby (of Indiana), to a seat vacated by John Daniel Tinder: Selby, the first black American and the first woman appointed to the Indiana Supreme Court,[140] was nominated by President Obama on January 12, 2016.[141] Republican Senator Dan Coats blue slipped the nomination, and the nomination stalled out in the Judiciary Committee.[142] The seat was ultimately filled in 2017 by Trump nominee Amy Coney Barrett,[143] who would later join the Supreme Court following the death of Ruth Bader Ginsburg.\n\nUnited States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit\n\nStephen Six (of Kansas), to seat vacated by Deanell Reece Tacha.[144] Former Kansas Attorney General Six was opposed by both home state senators. Republicans claimed that he was a liberal extremist who would substitute his personal opinions for the law and the Constitution. Six's critics strongly condemned his conduct in a 2008 investigation of physician George Tiller, who was charged with performing illegal late-term abortions. Six was accused of improperly quashing a subpoena for Tiller's patient records.[145] Based on this criticism, the Senate Judiciary Committee did not act upon the nomination, and it was returned to the president on December 17, 2011, pursuant to the rules of the Senate.[146] President Obama later chose Kansas Supreme Court Justice Nancy Moritz to fill the seat to which Six had been nominated, and the Senate easily confirmed Moritz on May 5, 2014.[147]\n\nUnited States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit\n\nCaitlin Halligan (of New York), to seat vacated by John Roberts:[148] on September 29, 2010, President Obama nominated New York Solicitor Halligan. Her argument that \"gun manufacturers, wholesalers, and retailers contributed to a 'public nuisance' of illegal handguns in the state [of New York],\"[149] prompted critics to claim that she was a liberal ideologue who would not uphold the Second Amendment and would base rulings on personal opinion rather than the law. Halligan's nomination failed to reach the threshold for cloture.[150] Obama renominated Halligan to the D.C. Circuit in June 2012,[151] The nomination was again returned to the President on August 3, 2012, and Obama renominated Halligan to the seat for a third time on September 19, 2012.[152] On March 22, 2013, the President officially withdrew Halligan's nomination.[153] On June 4, 2013, Obama nominated Patricia Millett to fill the vacancy, and the Senate confirmed her on December 10, 2013.\n\nSuccessful appointments\n\n[edit]\n\nUnited States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit\n\nDavid Hamilton (of Indiana), to seat vacated by Kenneth Francis Ripple: Hamilton was nominated on March 17, 2009.[154] Prior to President Obama's successful appointment of Hamilton, President George W. Bush had unsuccessfully nominated Philip P. Simon to succeed Judge Ripple, who assumed senior status in September 2008. Hamilton's nomination generated opposition from groups who objected to some of his rulings while serving as a judge on the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Indiana, particularly those dealing with abortion and prayer.[155] However, Hamilton received the support of both Senators from Indiana,[156] including Republican Senator Richard Lugar.[157] On November 17, 2009, the United States Senate invoked cloture on his nomination by a 70–29 vote.[158] Hamilton was confirmed on November 19, 2009, by a 59–39 vote. Lugar was the only Republican to vote for the confirmation of Hamilton.[159]\n\nUnited States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit\n\nPatty Shwartz (of New Jersey), to seat vacated by Maryanne Trump Barry: New Jersey Democratic Senator Bob Menendez did not return his blue slip, which effectively blocked the nomination.[160] In January 2012, The New York Times reported that Senator Menendez did not provide a reason for the blue slip, noting that Shwartz long had been in a relationship with the head of the New Jersey federal prosecutor's public corruption unit which investigated Menendez during the 2006 United States Senate election in New Jersey, an investigation that Menendez contended was politically motivated.[160] On January 13, 2012, Menendez dropped his opposition to Shwartz's nomination,[161] and the Judiciary Committee reported her nomination to the floor of the Senate by a 10–6 vote. On January 2, 2013, her nomination was returned to the President due to the sine die adjournment of the Senate.[162] On January 3, 2013, she was renominated. Her nomination was reported to the floor by the Senate Judiciary Committee on February 14, 2013, by a 11–7 vote,[163] and the Senate confirmed her nomination on April 9, 2013, by a 64–34 vote.[164]\n\nUnited States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit\n\nAndrew D. Hurwitz (of Arizona), to seat vacated by Mary M. Schroeder: In a 2002 law review article, Hurwitz wrote that he had helped create, and still admires, the legal framework for Judge Jon O. Newman's opinion striking down Connecticut's abortion law in 1972 prior to Roe v. Wade.[165] While Hurwitz's home-state senators supported his nomination, other Republican senators objected to it.[166] The Senate invoke cloture on his nomination on June 11, 2012, by a 60–31 vote.[167] Hurwitz was confirmed on June 12, 2012, by a voice vote.[168]\n\nUnited States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit\n\nRobert E. Bacharach (of Oklahoma), to seat vacated by Robert Harlan Henry. A United States magistrate judge of the United States District Court for the Western District of Oklahoma since 1999, Bacharach's nomination failed to receive enough votes to invoke cloture.[169] While Republicans had no objection to Bachrach himself, they contended that the consideration of his nomination came too late in a presidential election year, citing the informal Thurmond Rule.[170] After President Obama's re-election, Bacharach was confirmed on February 25, 2013, by a 93–0 vote.[171]\n\nUnited States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit\n\nAdalberto Jordan (of Florida), to seat vacated by Susan H. Black. While Republicans did not have specific objections to the nomination, Republican senators, such as Mike Lee, objected to Obama's nominations during this time period in response to recess appointments made in January 2012, to the National Labor Relations Board.[172] On February 9, 2012, Senator Harry Reid motioned to invoke cloture on Jordan's nomination, which was invoked on February 13, 2012, by an 89–5 vote.[173] The Senate confirmed Jordan on February 15, 2012, by a 94–5 vote.[174]\n\nJill A. Pryor, to the United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit. Originally nominated February 16, 2012, to seat vacated by Stanley F. Birch. Georgia's two Republican senators, Johnny Isakson and Saxby Chambliss, refused to return their blue slips, thus blocking her nomination.[175] In September 2013, it was reported that a deal was in the works between the White House and the senators to ensure a hearing on Pryor’s nomination and to fill the other district court vacancies within Georgia, thus upsetting those in the Georgia's Democratic delegation.[176] On June 19, 2014, her nomination was reported out of committee by voice vote. On July 30, 2014, Senator Harry Reid motioned to invoke cloture on Pryor's nomination. On July 31, 2014, the United States Senate invoked cloture on Pryor's nomination by a 58–33 vote.[177] On September 8, 2014, her nomination was confirmed by a 97–0 vote.[178]\n\nUnited States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit\n\nPatricia Millett, Cornelia Pillard, and Robert L. Wilkins to seats vacated by John G. Roberts Jr., Douglas H. Ginsburg, and David B. Sentelle, respectively: in November 2013, Republicans opposed the confirmation of three nominees to the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals, citing the caseload while accusing President Obama of \"court packing,\"[179] evoking President Franklin D. Roosevelt's Judicial Procedures Reform Bill of 1937.[180] This set of objections resulted in Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid invoking the so-called parliamentary nuclear option on November 21, 2013, which changed the Senate's confirmation threshold for all executive nominees except for the Supreme Court.[5] Millet was confirmed on December 10, 2013, by a 56–38 vote.[181] Pillard was confirmed on December 11, 2013, by a 51–44 vote.[182] Wilkins was confirmed on January 13, 2014, by a 55–43 vote.[183] The confirmations marked the first time the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit had a full complement of judges since Clarence Thomas left the court on October 23, 1991, upon his elevation to the Supreme Court.\n\nFailed, stalled or filibustered district court nominations\n\n[edit]\n\nFailed nominations\n\n[edit]\n\nUnited States District Court for the Western District of Wisconsin\n\nLouis B. Butler: Butler unsuccessfully ran for the Wisconsin Supreme Court in 2000 and lost by a wide margin.[184] He was appointed to the Wisconsin Supreme Court in 2004, but narrowly lost the 2008 election to retain the seat.[185] On September 30, 2009, President Obama nominated Butler to serve on the District Court. Critics argued that Butler should not be appointed to the federal bench after having been twice rejected by the voters of his state,[185] and labeled him as liberal ideologue who was hostile toward tough criminal sentences and the rights of gun owners.[186] He was also criticized for a ruling which effectively overturned the state's limits on non-economic damages in medical malpractice suits and a ruling in which he supported \"collective liability\" in lead paint cases in which companies could be held liable for products that they didn't produce, leading to charges of being overly beholden to trial lawyers.[187] Wisconsin Senator Ron Johnson, elected in 2010, immediately placed a hold on Butler's nomination once he took office in 2011, and the Senate returned Butler's nomination to the White House in December 2011 without consideration. On November 7, 2013, Obama nominated James D. Peterson to fill this vacancy, and he was confirmed overwhelmingly on May 8, 2014.\n\nUnited States District Court for the District of Maryland\n\nCharles Bernard Day: Day, a U.S. magistrate judge in Maryland, was initially nominated in July 2010, but his nomination was withdrawn by President Obama on October 31, 2011. Day did not receive a hearing in the Judiciary Committee. Senator Chuck Grassley stated that Committee members had \"insurmountable concerns\" about matters raised during a background investigation of Day, adding that Day \"is aware of those problems and is free to share that information if he so desires.\"[188] In November 2011, Obama nominated Baltimore Circuit Court Judge George Levi Russell III to fill this vacancy, and he was confirmed on May 14, 2012.\n\nUnited States District Court for the Western District of New York\n\nMichael Charles Green: Green, then the Monroe County District Attorney in western New York, was nominated on January 26, 2011. The nomination was reported out of the Senate Judiciary Committee, but the nomination stalled in the Senate and was returned to the president at the end of 2011. In follow-up questions to his hearing testimony, several Republican senators focused on Green's decision to seek drug treatment rather than jail for some offenders, while others queried Green about his views on the death penalty. On December 18, 2011, a White House spokesman told a local newspaper that President Obama would not renominate Green to the seat.[189] \"Mike Green would have made an outstanding judge, and it is very unfortunate not only for him, but for a strong judiciary, that partisan politics stood in the way,\" Senator Chuck Schumer said in a statement on December 18, 2011. On December 19, 2011, Green said at a press conference that he blamed local opposition on his failed judicial nomination, as a result of his prosecution of public corruption.[190] In May 2012, Obama nominated longtime Rochester judge Frank Paul Geraci, Jr. to fill thisvacancy, and he was confirmed unanimously on December 13, 2012.\n\nUnited States District Court for the Northern District of Oklahoma\n\nArvo Mikkanen: Mikkanen was nominated following a recommendation from Democratic Governor Brad Henry.[191] His nomination was immediately met with opposition from members of Oklahoma's congressional delegation, with Republican Senators James Inhofe and Tom Coburn and Democratic Representative Dan Boren expressing disappointment that they were not consulted on the nomination.[192][193] Opposition to Mikkanen's nomination centered around procedural grounds,[192][193] and President Obama ultimately nominated then-federal magistrate judge John E. Dowdell to fill the vacancy. The Senate confirmed Dowdell unanimously on December 11, 2012.\n\nUnited States District Court for the Northern District of Georgia\n\nNatasha Perdew Silas: Georgia's two Republican senators, Johnny Isakson and Saxby Chambliss, opposed Silas, a staff attorney at the Federal Public Defender program for Northern Georgia, for reasons which they declined to discuss publicly. As a result, Silas did not receive a hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee.[194] Her nomination was returned to Obama on December 17, 2011. On December 19, 2013, Obama nominated Mark Howard Cohen to fill this vacancy. He was confirmed on November 18, 2014.\n\nLinda T. Walker: Originally nominated on January 26, 2011. Her nomination expired when it was returned to the President on December 17, 2011. On December 19, 2013, Obama nominated Leigh Martin May to fill this vacancy. She was confirmed without opposition on November 13, 2014.\n\nMichael P. Boggs: Originally nominated on December 19, 2013, to the seat expected to be vacated by Judge Julie E. Carnes, who was nominated to United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit on the same day. David Scott, U.S. Representative from Georgia's 13th district, criticized the nomination of Boggs because of Boggs' votes in the legislature to retain Confederate insignia in the state flag of Georgia, restrict abortion, and ban same-sex marriage.[195] Boggs was nominated as part of a group of nominees that won approval of Georgia's U.S. senators, to allow votes on their nominations.[195] He received a hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee on May 13, 2014, but his nomination was not reported from committee. On December 30, 2014, Senator Chambliss revealed that he had been advised in late November by White House chief of staff Denis McDonough that Boggs would not be renominated.[196] On July 30, 2015, the President nominated judge Dax Eric López to the vacancy.\n\nDax Eric López: On July 30, 2015, President Obama nominated DeKalb County Circuit Court Judge López to serve as a Federal judge, to the seat vacated by Julie E. Carnes, who was elevated to the United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit.[197] Senator David Perdue announced that he would not return Lopez's blue slip due to the treatment by Democrats of the prior nominee, Michael P. Boggs, effectively killing Lopez's nomination.[198] The seat was later filled by Trump nominee Michael Lawrence Brown.\n\nUnited States District Court for the District of Nevada\n\nElissa F. Cadish: On February 16, 2012, President Obama nominated Cadish, a Clark County District Court Judge, to be a judge for the United States District Court for the District of Nevada.[199] She would have replaced Philip M. Pro who took senior status in 2011. Because Senator Heller had refused to return his blue slip, the Senate Judiciary Committee did not hold a hearing on her nomination. Heller's opposition to her nomination and his invocation of \"senatorial courtesy\" was because of a statement by Cadish indicating that she believed that there was no individual right to keep and bear arms, a statement which was made in 2008, prior to Supreme Court decisions explicitly recognizing an individual right to keep and bear arms.[200] On March 8, 2013, Cadish requested that President Obama withdraw her nomination, and on March 13, 2013, Obama formally withdrew the nomination.[201] On January 16, 2014, Obama nominated Richard F. Boulware to fill this vacancy, and he was confirmed on June 10, 2014.\n\nUnited States District Court for the Southern District of Florida\n\nWilliam L. Thomas: On November 14, 2012, President Obama nominated Dade County Circuit Court Judge Thomas to a seat on the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida[202] to replace Adalberto Jordan.[203] If confirmed, Thomas would have been the first openly gay black male to serve as a federal judge.[204] On January 2, 2013, his nomination was returned to the President, due to the sine die adjournment of the Senate. On January 3, 2013, he was renominated to the same office. On September 19, 2013, Senator Marco Rubio announced that – although originally he recommended Thomas to the President – he would not return his blue slip.[205] His nomination was returned to the President because of the sine die adjournment of Congress on January 3, 2014. Obama decided not to resubmitt the nomination a third time.[206] Palm Beach County Circuit Court Judge Robin L. Rosenberg was nominated to the seat on February 26, 2014, and she was confirmed on July 22, 2014.\n\nUnited States District Court for the District of South Carolina\n\nAlison Renee Lee: A Richland County Circuit Court Judge since 1999, Lee was originally nominated on June 26, 2013, to the seat being vacated by Cameron McGowan Currie, who took senior status on October 3, 2013.[207] South Carolina Senators Lindsey Graham and Tim Scott opposed her nomination because of a controversial decision that she made involving burglary suspect Lorenzo Young. Lee consolidated his bonds and reduced the bond total from $225,000 to $175,000 for Young, who subsequently was released and then later charged in a July 1 murder.[208][209] Because of opposition from her home state senators and no opportunity of receiving a committee hearing, on September 18, 2014, Obama withdrew her nomination.[210] The seat was filled in 2019 by Trump nominee A. Marvin Quattlebaum Jr.\n\nUnited States District Court for the Eastern District of North Carolina\n\nJennifer Prescod May-Parker: Originally nominated June 20, 2013, to the seat vacated by Malcolm Jones Howard, she did not receive a hearing. Senator Richard Burr did not return his blue slip.[211] Her nomination was returned on December 16, 2014, because of the adjournment of the 113th Congress. President Obama chose not to renominate her. The seat was later filled by Trump nominee Richard E. Myers II.\n\nUnited States District Court for the District of Kansas\n\nTerrence J. Campbell: On January 28, 2016, President Obama nominated Campbell to serve as a judge of the United States District Court for the District of Kansas, to the seat vacated by Kathryn H. Vratil, who took senior status on April 22, 2014.[212] Campbell generated no controversy, but his nomination was not acted upon. On December 7, 2016, Campbell, in letters to Obama and Kansas Senators Pat Roberts and Jerry Moran, requested that his name be withdrawn from further consideration.[213] His nomination expired on January 3, 2017, at the end of the 114th Congress. The seat was later filled by Trump nominee Holly Lou Teeter.\n\nUnited States District Court for the District of Utah\n\nRonald G. Russell: On December 16, 2015, President Obama nominated former Centerville Mayor Russell to serve on the United States District Court for the District of Utah, to the seat vacated by Ted Stewart, who took senior status on September 1, 2014.[214] Russell, a Republican, had the support of Utah Senators Orrin Hatch and Mike Lee. Russell received a hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee on April 20, 2016, and was approved without objection on May 19. However, Russell's nomination stalled on the floor, due to the blockade on confirmations imposed by Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, and Democratic objections to expediting Russell's nomination without confirming longer-pending Democrats. Without floor action, Russell's nomination was returned to the White House unconfirmed on January 3, 2017.[215] The seat was later filled by Trump nominee Howard C. Nielson Jr.\n\nSuccessful nominations\n\n[edit]\n\nUnited States District Court for the District of Rhode Island\n\nJohn J. McConnell, Jr.: McConnell was first nominated on March 10, 2010.[216] McConnell had donated hundreds of thousands of dollars to Democratic campaigns, including over eight thousand each to the campaigns of Rhode Island Senators Jack Reed and Sheldon Whitehouse.[216] McConnell's critics contended that his prolific political contributions suggest that McConnell would be a partisan judge.[217] On May 4, 2011, the Senate invoked cloture on McConnell's nomination in a 63–33 vote, and he was confirmed later that same day in a 50–44 vote.[218] At the time, the cloture petition to break the filibuster marked one of the rare instances that such a motion had been required to force a vote on a district court nominee, with only three prior instances recorded.[219]\n\nUnited States District Court for the Northern District of California\n\nEdward M. Chen: Chen faced opposition due to his work as an attorney for the ACLU.[125][220] On May 5, 2011, Senator Harry Reid received unanimous consent from the Senate to proceed to an executive session of the Senate at a future time, eliminating the need to file for cloture on Chen's nomination.[221] On May 10, 2011, Chen was confirmed by a 56–42 vote.\n\nUnited States District Court for the District of Arizona\n\nRosemary Márquez: On June 23, 2011, President Obama nominated Marquez, a Tucson defense attorney, to the federal court in Arizona. However, Arizona's two Republican senators, John McCain and Jon Kyl, refused to return their blue slips.[222] McCain said that he did not believe that Marquez was qualified, telling a newspaper, \"I've been working with Sen. Kyl, but we do not feel at this time that she's qualified.\"[223] On January 28, 2014, the Senate Judiciary Committee held a hearing on her nomination as well as five other individuals nominated to the same court. She was confirmed on May 15, 2014, by a vote of 81–15.\n\nUnited States District Court for the Eastern District of Missouri\n\nRonnie L. White: On November 7, 2013, President Obama nominated Missouri Supreme Court Justice White to serve on the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Missouri.[224] White had previously been nominated for the same position by President Bill Clinton in 1997, but the nomination was defeated.[225] The nomination drew controversy, as Republicans charged White as being a liberal ideologue who was biased in favor of criminal defendants. He received a hearing before the United States Senate Judiciary Committee on May 20, 2014.[226] On June 19, 2014, his nomination was reported out of committee by a vote of 10–8.[227] On July 16, 2014, the Senate voted 54–43 for cloture on White's nomination, ending a Republican-led filibuster. Later that same day, senators voted 53–44 to confirm White.[228]\n\nImpacts of vacancies\n\n[edit]\n\nA 2016 study found that the current rate of federal judicial vacancies (10 percent) had led prosecutors to dismiss more cases and had led defendants to be more likely to plead guilty and less likely to be incarcerated.[229] The authors found that \"the current rate of vacancies has resulted in 1,000 fewer prison inmates annually compared to a fully-staffed court system, a 1.5 percent decrease.\"[229]\n\nNominations that were made at the end of Obama's term and later renominated\n\n[edit]\n\nSuccessful renominations\n\n[edit]\n\nUnited States District Court for the District of Colorado\n\nRegina M.

Bush in 2008, but the nomination was not acted upon by Senate Democrats, with Obama nominee Charlene Honeywell being appointed to that seat instead. Like before, his nomination drew no controversy. For this 2016 nomination, the American Bar Association Standing Committee on the Federal Judiciary rated Jung unanimously \"Well Qualified.\"[237] In spite of this, his nomination expired on January 3, 2017, with the end of the 114th Congress.[238] On December 21, 2017, he was nominated a third time by President Trump.[239] On February 14, 2018, a hearing on his nomination was held.[240] On March 15, 2018, his nomination was reported out of committee by voice vote.[241] On September 6, 2018, his nomination was confirmed by voice vote.[242]\n\nUnited States District Court for the District of Idaho\n\nDavid Nye: On the recommendation of Senators Mike Crapo and Jim Risch, President Obama nominated state Appellate Judge Nye on April 5, 2016, to serve as a judge of the United States District Court for the District of Idaho.[243][244] Nye was nominated to the seat vacated by Edward Lodge, who took senior status on July 3, 2015.
