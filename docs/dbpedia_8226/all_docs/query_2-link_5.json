        "text": "Patricia E. Campbell-Smith was appointed a judge for the U.S. Court of Federal Claims just a month ago. Now President Obama has promoted her to chief judge of the court, making her the first African America to ever hold the position.\n\nCampbell-Smith was described by the president as having “a long and distinguished record of service.” He expressed his confidence that “she will serve with distinction.”\n\nFrom The Root:\n\nAs the special master to the court from 2005 to 2011 and chief special master from 2011 to 2013, Campbell-Smith was responsible for overseeing court orders on the National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program. She was also a law clerk for former U.S. Federal Claims Court Chief Judge Emily C. Hewitt.\n\nRead more at The Root\n\nLike all judges appointed to the U.S. Federal Claims Court, Campbell-Smith will serve a 15-year term.\n\nKudos to President Obama for making history with his selection."
