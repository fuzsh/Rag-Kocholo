        "text": "VINEMONT, Ala. – The Vinemont High School Class of 1994 recently came together to reminisce about the “good old days” at its 30-year reunion.\n\nThe group hatched a plan and gathered at the school to see the changes in their alma mater and classmates. A barbecue lunch was provided by local barbecue joint The Butcher’s Chuckwagon.\n\nA total of 31 classmates attended. The class of 1994’s football stars, cheerleaders, student government officials, band members and friends were hoping to catch up with old friends and reconnect. Also there were three of the group’s teachers.\n\n“It’s hard to believe it was 30 years ago since we had all been on campus together,” Julie Barck, who organized the reunion, said. “While we were touring the campus and talking to our faculty, it seemed like we were back in 1994.”"
