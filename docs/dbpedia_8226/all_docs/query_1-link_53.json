Explaining and evaluating new possibilities in modern organizational law, the book demonstrates that legal organizations are much more generative than widely recognized, with the capacity to enable new configurations that combine several legal transactional techniques. Chapters consider the implications of this flexibility for monitoring, regulation, and reform, examine the effects of modern transactional creativity on the rest of the legal system, suggest how organizational statutes might be harmonized, introduce non-traditional uses of modern organizations like LLCs, and propose novel ways to regulate organizations.\n\nRay Brescia (Albany Law School)\n\nLawyer Nation\n\nNYU Press, 2024\n\nThe author provides concrete ideas for transforming law into a field whose services are accessible, egalitarian, and viable in the long term. Further, he addresses how the profession can improve so that the health of its practitioners is not compromised in the process. If the legal profession does not respond to its crises in an effective way, he argues, the dysfunction and unfairness plaguing the legal world will deepen. This is an unprecedented opportunity for the world of law to reimagine its future in way that honors its highest ideals: preserving the rule of law, protecting individual liberty, and addressing social inequality in all of its forms.\n\nRuben J. Garcia (William S. Boyd School of Law at UNLV)\n\nCritical Wage Theory\n\nUniversity of California Press, July 2024\n\nThis book argues forcefully that we must center the minimum wage as a tool for fighting structural racism. Employing the lessons of critical race theory to show how low minimum wages and underenforcement of workplace laws have always been features of our racially stratified society, Garcia explains why we must follow the leadership of social movements by treating increases in minimum wage levels and enforcement as matters of racial justice. Offering solutions that would benefit all workers, especially the immigrants and people of color most often made victims of wage theft, Critical Wage Theory is essential reading for anyone who seeks a more just future for the working class.\n\nKaren J. Greenberg (Fordham School of Law), Julian E. Zelizer (Princeton University)\n\nOur Nation at Risk: Election Integrity as a National Security Issue\n\nNYU Press, July 2024\n\nIn recent years, the sight of gun-wielding citizens patrolling ballot boxes and voting sites has become increasingly familiar. Major news corporations parroting false claims of election fraud, ballot stuffing, and faulty voting systems as the new normal. In an era of global anti-democratic movements, the sanctity of democratic electoral processes has become a major national security concern, and the need to protect elections from foreign interference, disinformation, voter intimidation, and the danger of election results being overturned, are now front and center. How did we get here? And more importantly, how will this affect the future of democracy?\n\nGeeta N. Kapur (University of North Carolina School of Law)\n\nRace, Law, and the Struggle for Racial Equality in the U.S., First Edition\n\nAspen Publishing, February 2024\n\nThis book examines how the American legal system has legitimized and institutionalized racism, from slavery to Jim Crow segregation to the modern-day era of mass incarceration. This book, the first of its kind, has evolved from the author’s own experiences of both teaching race and the law for many years and practicing Civil Rights Law for over two decades. The text employs a novel interdisciplinary approach through primary source materials; archival records, photographs, and maps; and statutes and cases, to show how the judicial, executive, and legislative branches of the U.S. have deployed the law for racial control and to foster systemic racism in the areas of education, property and housing, criminal system, and voting rights.\n\nRonald J. Krotoszynski Jr. (University of Alabama School of Law), András Koltay (Hungary National University of Public Service), Charlotte Garden (University of Minnesota Law School)\n\nDisinformation, Misinformation and Democracy\n\nCambridge University Press, October 2024\n\nIn today’s digital age, the spread of dis- and misinformation across traditional and social media poses a significant threat to democracy. Yet repressing political speech in the name of truth can also undermine democratic values. This volume brings together prominent legal scholars from democracies worldwide to explore and evaluate different regulatory approaches for addressing this complex problem – all taking into account that the cure must not be worse than the disease. Using a comparative lens, the book offers important and novel insights into methods ranging from national regulation of politicians’ speech to empowering civil-society groups that are well-positioned to blunt the effects of disinformation and misinformation.\n\nRobin Kundis Craig (University of Kansas School of Law), Robert W. Adler (University of Utah College of the Law), Noah D. Hall (Wayne State University Law School)\n\nWater Law 2nd Edition\n\nWest Academic, July 2024\n\nIntended for a general audience, Water Law: Concepts & Insights provides both a general overview of basic water law doctrines and an exploration of how water law—the law and policies governing allocation of water—fit into broader ecological and environmental law issues. The book provides an overview of important hydrological principles before discussing the major state-law systems governing use of water in the United States—riparian law, prior appropriation, and specific groundwater doctrines. It then explores the federal government’s interests in the fresh waters of the United States, ranging from protection of navigability to water infrastructure projects to reserved federal water rights.\n\nDoriane Lambelet Coleman (Duke University School of Law)\n\nOn Sex and Gender\n\nSimon & Schuster, 2024\n\nThis book focuses on three sequential and consequential questions: What is sex as opposed to gender? How does sex matter in our everyday lives? And how should it be reflected in law and policy? All three have been front-and-center in American life and politics since the rise of the trans rights movement: They are included in both major parties’ political platforms. They are the subject of ongoing litigation in the federal courts and of highly contentious legislation on Capitol Hill. And they are a pivotal issue in the culture wars between left and right playing out around dinner tables, on campuses and school boards, on op-ed pages, and in corporate handbooks.\n\nH. Jefferson Powell (Duke Law School)\n\nThe Foundations of American Law: A Companion to the 1L Year\n\nCalifornia Academic Press, 2024\n\nThe main objective of this text is to introduce the reader to many of the background assumptions about American law and legal argument that inform how lawyers and judges read decisions and other legal documents, and how they think about legal problems. Lawyers presuppose and use these ideas and intellectual tools without discussing them, while law professors (and the materials they assign) often leave it to students to figure out the assumptions for themselves. The book discusses the relationship between logic and historical experience in the construction of the law, the ways pre-Revolutionary English common law shaped American law, and the 19th and early 20th century developments that led to contemporary American law.\n\nDavid Rabban (University of Texas School of Law)\n\nAcademic Freedom\n\nHarvard University Press, 2024\n\nIn subsuming academic freedom under the First Amendment, Rabban emphasizes the societal value of the contribution to knowledge made by the expert speech of professors, the classic justification for academic freedom in the influential 1915 Declaration of the American Association of University Professors (AAUP). Any indication that professors might be disciplined because people without academic training disagree with their scholarly views would undermine confidence in the integrity of their work and therefore their ability to perform this vital function on behalf of the public. Rabban argues that academic freedom fosters two central First Amendment values recognized by courts in a wide range of contexts: the production and dissemination of knowledge and the contribution of free expression to democratic citizenship.\n\nPatricia J. Williams (Northeastern University School of Law)\n\nThe Miracle of the Black Leg\n\nThe New Press, 2024\n\nBeginning with a jaw-dropping rumination on a centuries-old painting featuring a white man with a Black man’s leg surgically attached (with the expired Black leg-donor in the foreground), contracts law scholar and celebrated journalist Patricia J. Williams uses the lens of the law to take on core questions of identity, ethics, and race. With her trademark elegant prose and critical legal studies wisdom, Williams brings to bear a keen analytic eye and a lawyer’s training to chapters exploring the ways we have legislated the ownership of everything from body parts to gene sequences—and the particular ways in which our laws in these areas isolate nonnormative looks, minority cultures, and out-of-the-box thinkers.\n\nMarcia A. Zug (University of South Carolina Joseph F. Rice School of Law)\n\nYou’ll Do: A History of Marrying for Reasons Other Than Love\n\nSteerforth Press, January 2024\n\nLaws have been designed to encourage people to marry so that certain societal benefits could be achieved: the population would increase, women would have financial security, children would be cared for, and immigrants would have familial connections. The widely overlooked problem with this tradition is that individuals and society have relied on marriage to address or dismiss a range of injustices and inequities, from gender- and race-based discrimination, sexual violence, and predation to unequal financial treatment. Through revealing storytelling, Zug builds a compelling case that when marriage is touted as “the solution” to such problems, it absolves the government, and society, of the responsibility for directly addressing them.\n\nChristine Abely (New England Law Boston)\n\nThe Russia Sanctions: The Economic Response to Russia’s Invasion of Ukraine\n\nCambridge University Press, December 2023\n\nThis book examines the international trade measures and sanctions deployed against Russia in response to its 2022 invasion of Ukraine. Abely situates contemporary sanctions within their larger historical and economic backgrounds and provides a uniquely accessible analysis of the historic export controls and import restrictions enacted since 2022. She argues that these sanctions have affected, and will continue to affect, global trading patterns, financial integration, and foreign policy in novel ways. In particular, she examines the effects of sanctions on energy, food, fertilizer, the financial system, and the global use of the US dollar, including trends of de-dollarization. Coverage includes sanctions against oligarchs, the freezing and seizure of assets, and steps taken to make sanctions more effective by promoting financial transparency worldwide.\n\nSumudu Atapattu (University of Wisconsin Law School)\n\nUN Human Rights Institutions and the Environment: Synergies, Challenges, Trajectories\n\nRoutledge, May 2023\n\nDespite the increasing involvement of UN human rights bodies in addressing environmental degradation and climate change, a systematic review of the convergence between human rights and the environment in these bodies has not been carried out. Filing this lacuna, this book surveys the resolutions, general comments, concluding observations, decisions on individual communications and press releases. It identifies principles that have emerged, explores the ways in which human rights charter-based and treaty-based institutions are interpreting environmental principles and examines how they contribute to the emerging field of human rights and the environment. Given the disproportionate effect that polluting activities have on marginalized and vulnerable groups, Atapattu also discusses how these human rights mechanisms have addressed the impact on women, children, indigenous peoples, people with disabilities, and racial minorities.\n\nSamantha Barbas (University at Buffalo School of Law)\n\nActual Malice: Civil Rights and Freedom of the Press in New York Times v. Sullivan\n\nUniversity of California Press, February 2023\n\nA deeply researched legal drama that documents this landmark First Amendment ruling—one that is more critical and controversial than ever. Actual Malice tells the full story of New York Times v. Sullivan, the dramatic case that grew out of segregationists’ attempts to quash reporting on the civil rights movement. In its landmark 1964 decision, the Supreme Court held that a public official must prove “actual malice” or reckless disregard of the truth to win a libel lawsuit, providing critical protections for free speech and freedom of the press. Drawing on previously unexplored sources, including the archives of the New York Times Company and civil rights leaders, Samantha Barbas tracks the saga behind one of the most important First Amendment rulings in history. She situates the case within the turbulent 1960s and the history of the press, alongside striking portraits of the lawyers, officials, judges, activists, editors, and journalists who brought and defended the case. As the Sullivan doctrine faces growing controversy, Actual Malice reminds us of the stakes of the case that shaped American reporting and public discourse as we know it.\n\nKatharine T. Bartlett (Duke Law School) Deborah L. Rhodes (Stanford Law School) Deborah L. Blake (University of Pittsburgh) Frank Rudy Cooper (William S. Boyd School of Law at UNLV)\n\nGender and Law: Theory, Doctrine, Commentary\n\nAspen Publishing, February 2023\n\nGender and Law: Theory, Doctrine, Commentary, Ninth Edition is organized around theoretical frameworks, showing different conceptualizations of equality and justice and their impact on concrete legal problems. The text provides complete, up-to-date coverage of conventional “women and the law” issues, including employment law and affirmative action, reproductive rights, LGBTQ issues, domestic violence, rape, pornography, international women’s rights, and global trafficking. Showing the complex ways in which gender permeates the law, the text also explores the gender aspects of subject matters less commonly associated with gender, such as property, ethics, contracts, sports, and civil procedure. Throughout, the materials allow an emphasis on alternative approaches and how these approaches make a difference. Excerpted legal cases, statutes, and law review articles form an ongoing dialogue within the book to stimulate thought and discussion, and almost 250 provocative “putting theory into practice” problems challenge students to think deeply about current gender law issues.\n\nShawn Bayern (Florida State University College of Law)\n\nBayern’s Principles and Possibilities in Common Law: Torts, Contracts, and Property\n\nWest Academic Publishing, July 2023\n\nThis book discusses principles of the common law, with attention to how the subjects of tort law, contract law, and property law have developed in the United States. The focus is on modern law and how it has changed from more formalistic rules that were used in the past. It is an ideal introductory guide for law students and others interested in modern legal reasoning. The book pays special attention to parallels and correspondences between its legal subject areas, showing how they fit together into a larger picture. While teaching the material at a sophisticated level and avoiding “tips” and “tricks,” the book includes notes on what to focus on when learning the common law and includes a significant amount of material that shows the subtleties of modern legal education.\n\nShawn Bayern (Florida State University College of Law)\n\nThe Analytical Failures of Law and Economics\n\nCambridge University Press, September 2023\n\nThe law-and-economics movement remains a dominant force in American private law, even though courts and commentators recognize that many of its assumptions are implausible and that efficiency is not the law’s only goal. This book adds to the debate by showing that many leading law-and-economics arguments fail on their own terms, even for those who accept their most important assumptions and goals. Adopting an analytical approach and using some law-and-economics methods against the leading arguments in that field, Shawn Bayern shows that economic thinking fails to explain or justify most rules in the common law. Bayern masterfully surveys leading law-and-economics arguments in tort, contract, and property law and shows them to be fragile, self-contradictory, or otherwise problematic. Those who accept that efficiency is important should not be persuaded by the kind of law-and-economics arguments that have remained in vogue among legal scholars for decades.\n\nAdam Benforado (Drexel University Thomas R. Kline School of Law)\n\nA Minor Revolution: How Prioritizing Kids Benefits Us All\n\nCrown, February 2023\n\nAt the dawn of the twentieth century, a bright new age for children appeared on the horizon, with progress on ending child labor, providing public education, combating indigence, promoting wellness, and creating a juvenile justice system. But a hundred years on, the promised light has not arrived. Today, more than eleven million American children live in poverty and more than four million lack health insurance. Each year, we prosecute thousands of kids as adults, while our schools crumble. We deny young people any political power, while we fail to act on the issues that matter most to them: racism, inequality, and climate change. Drawing on the latest research on the value of early intervention, investment, and empowerment, A Minor Revolution makes the urgent case for putting children first—in our budgets and policies, in how we develop products and enact laws, and in our families and communities. Childhood is the window of opportunity for all of us.\n\nThomas C. Berg (University of St. Thomas, Minnesota)\n\nReligious Liberty in a Polarized Age\n\nWm. B. Eerdmans Publishing Co., 2023\n\nAs our political and social landscapes polarize along party lines, religious liberty faces threats from both sides. From antidiscrimination commissions targeting conservative Christians to travel bans punishing Muslims, recent litigation has revealed the selective approach both left and right take when it comes to freedom of religion. But what if religious liberty is part of the cure for our political division? Drawing on constitutional law, history, and sociology, Thomas C. Berg shows us how reaffirming religious freedom cultivates the good of individuals and society. After explaining the features of polarization and the societal benefits of diverse religious practices, Berg offers practical counsel on balancing religious freedom against other essential values. Protecting Americans’ ability to live according to their beliefs undergirds a healthy, pluralistic society—and this protection must extend to everyone, not just political allies. Lay readers and legal scholars who are weary of partisan quarreling will find Berg’s case timely and compelling.\n\nRaj Bhala (University of Kansas School of Law)\n\nTrade War: Causes, Conduct, and Consequences of Sino-American Confrontation\n\nCarolina Academic Press, 2023\n\nThis book is the world’s first full-length legal and interdisciplinary analysis of the U.S.-China trade war. It is the result of five years of research, dating back to the start of the trade war in March 2018. All of the big-picture themes and trends, and vital technical details, are explained with clarity and precision. The twenty-two chapters are logically organized into three parts, proceeding chronologically through tariff, non-tariff, and future battles. Trade-related matters, including industrial policy, human rights, Hong Kong, and “Cold War” characterizations, are amply discussed. Special care is taken to understand the perspectives of China, as well as those of major third countries such as India. The book has a user-friendly table of abbreviations, plus copious citations for further reading.\n\nHon. Charles N. Brower (George Washington University Law School)\n\nJudging Iran: A Memoir of The Hague, The White House, and Life on the Front Line of International Justice\n\nDisruption Books, April 2023\n\nFrom a divided Berlin to The Hague, the Reagan White House, the forests of Costa Rica, and more, Judge Charles N. Brower shares a personal history of a life spent at the forefront of international justice — and a case for the role of law in preserving global peace.\n\nJudging Iran is a frank insider account of the highest echelons of international law. As an active judge to this day, Brower offers a nuanced history of modern arbitration between nations, from our earliest concept of international law to today’s efforts for justice. And, as a global citizen, he argues that the law is essential in our work for peace.\n\nLee Cabatingan (University of California, Irvine Law)\n\nA Region among States: Law and Non-sovereignty in the Caribbean\n\nUniversity of Chicago Press, June 2023\n\nHow is it that a great swath of the independent, English-speaking Caribbean continues to accept the judicial oversight of their former colonizer via the British institution of the Privy Council? And what possibilities might the Caribbean Court of Justice—a judicial institution responsive to the region, not to any single nation—offer for untangling sovereignty and regionhood, law and modernity, and postcolonial Caribbean identity? Joining the Court as an intern, Lee Cabatingan studied its work up close: she attended each court hearing and numerous staff meetings, served on committees, assisted with the organization of conferences, and helped prepare speeches and presentations for the judges. She now offers insight into not only how the Court positions itself vis-à-vis the Caribbean region and the world but also whether the Court—and, perhaps, the region itself as an overarching construct—might ever achieve a real measure of popular success. In their quest for an accepting, eager constituency, the Court is undertaking a project of extrajudicial region building that borrows from the toolbox of the nation-state. In each chapter, Cabatingan takes us into an analytical dimension familiar from studies of nation and state building—myth, territory, people, language, and brand—to help us understand not only the Court and its ambitions but also the regionalist project, beset as it is with false starts and disappointments, as a potential alternative to the sovereign state.\n\nI. Glenn Cohen (Harvard Law School), Abbe R. Gluck (Yale University), Katherine Kraschel (Northeastern University School of Law), Carmel Shachar (Harvard Law School)\n\nCOVID-19 and the Law: Disruption, Impact and Legacy\n\nCambridge University Press, 2023\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has had an enduring effect across the entire spectrum of law and policy, in areas ranging from health equity and racial justice, to constitutional law, the law of prisons, federal benefit programs, election law and much more. This collection provides a critical reflection on what changes the pandemic has already introduced, and what its legacy may be. Chapters evaluate how healthcare and government institutions have succeeded and failed during this global ‘stress test,’ and explore how the US and the world will move forward to ensure we are better prepared for future pandemics. This timely volume identifies the right questions to ask as we take stock of pandemic realities and provides guidance for the many stakeholders of COVID-19’s legal legacy.\n\nMichael B. Dorff (Southwestern Law School)\n\nBecoming a Public Benefit Corporation: Express Your Values, Energize Stakeholders, Make the World a Better Place\n\nStanford University Press, November 2023\n\nEntrepreneurs and leaders often have an inspiring vision for how their business can not only make money for shareholders, but also benefit society. In recent years a new legal structure has emerged, the “Benefit Corporation” or “Public Benefit Corporation,” which helps organizations make this ethical vision a legally authorized and protected reality. Companies like Patagonia, Kickstarter, Warby Parker, Danone North America, Allbirds, and King Arthur Baking have become benefit corporations to help advance both their business and their broader mission. Rather than narrowly maximizing profits, they consider their businesses’ impacts on employees, customers, suppliers, the environment and others.\n\nNita A. Farahany (Duke University School of Law)\n\nThe Battle for Your Brain Defending the Right to Think Freely in the Age of Neurotechnology\n\nSt. Martin’s Press, March 2023\n\nA new dawn of brain tracking and hacking is coming. Will you be prepared for what comes next? Imagine a world where your brain can be interrogated to learn your political beliefs, your thoughts can be used as evidence of a crime, and your own feelings can be held against you. A world where people who suffer from epilepsy receive alerts moments before a seizure, and the average person can peer into their own mind to eliminate painful memories or cure addictions. Neuroscience has already made all of this possible today, and neurotechnology will soon become the “universal controller” for all of our interactions with technology. This can benefit humanity immensely, but without safeguards, it can seriously threaten our fundamental human rights to privacy, freedom of thought, and self-determination. From one of the world’s foremost experts on the ethics of neuroscience, The Battle for Your Brain offers a path forward to navigate the complex legal and ethical dilemmas that will fundamentally impact our freedom to understand, shape, and define ourselves.\n\nPaul Goldstein (Stanford Law School) Marketa Trimble (William S. Boyd School of Law)\n\nInternational Intellectual Property Law Cases and Materials\n\nFoundation Press, October 2023\n\nThis casebook organizes contemporary foreign, as well as U.S., case law and literature to equip law students with the knowledge they need to practice intellectual property law in both transactional and litigation settings in the current globalized environment. Carefully selected materials also expose students to the social, economic, and cultural considerations that underpin intellectual property law around the world. The casebook covers aspects of public international law, conflict of laws (private international law), and comparative law of intellectual property. Each area of law―copyright, patent, trademark, unfair competition, trade secrets, and industrial design―is introduced by a comprehensive authors’ note placing the field in its international and comparative law context, and extensive notes on the cases and materials fill in relevant details, including current and historically important topics. Materials on the major fields of intellectual property law are accompanied by materials on other related intellectual property matters, such as the protection of databases, plant varieties, geographical indications of origin, and internet domain names. A comprehensive teacher’s manual offers step-by-step assistance for teaching every case and doctrine, and also sample syllabi, final exams, learning outcomes and means of assessment.\n\nPaul A. Gowder (Northwestern University Pritzker School of Law)\n\nThe Networked Leviathan\n\nCambridge University Press, July 2023\n\nWe all—users, businesses, governments, and the general public—expect internet platform companies, like Meta, Alphabet, and Amazon to govern their users. Without platform governance, we all experience disasters like foreign election interference, vaccine misinformation, counterfeiting, and even genocide. Unfortunately, the platform companies have failed. To this day, despite the lessons from years of missteps and billions of dollars of spending in enterprises like content moderation, the major internet companies have been unable to prevent their platforms from hosting misinformation, scams, incitement, and hate. Nobody (except the perpetrators) wants this result. The failures of platform companies result not from mailce, but from companies’ inability to manage the complexity of their userbases and products and of their own incentives under the eyes of conflicting internal and external constituencies. The research of scholars in political science and other academic disciplines can help companies and governments progress on the problem of platform governance. Political scientists, constitutional theorists, and other scholars of governance have been studying the efforts of states to govern under complexity for centuries under theoretical rubrics like the problem of knowledge and incentive-compatible institutional design. The Networked Leviathan argues that this hard-won knowledge about states also applies to platforms. The insights from the research in political science and allied disciplines leads inexorably to the conclusion that governments and companies should collaborate to build democratic institutions for platform governance. By permitting ordinary people from across the world to participate in the governance enterprise, we allow those with the knowledge critical to making and applying platform rules to deploy that knowledge where it can make an impact. Democratic governance also allows companies to recruit third parties to help manage their own capacity to make and stick to decisions. The Networked Leviathan offers a case and a roadmap for democratizing the platforms.\n\nJohn Infranca (Suffolk University Law School), Sarah Schindler (Sturm College of Law, University of Denver)\n\nA Research Agenda for US Land Use and Planning Law\n\nEdward Elgar Publishing, December 2023\n\nAuthoritative and multidisciplinary in approach, this Research Agenda shapes questions that will underpin future legal and empirical scholarly inquiry on zoning and land use regulation in the US. Building on existing debates and providing a comprehensive overview of the current state of academic research, it identifies the gaps which need addressing in future research. Bringing together a diverse array of prominent voices across multiple disciplines, this book adeptly navigates central themes including the structure of land use regulation, the relationship between zoning and planning, and the role of different levels of government and administrative agencies.\n\nMichael S. Kang (Northwestern University Pritzker School of Law), Joanna M. Shepherd (Emory University School of Law)\n\nFree to Judge: The Power of Campaign Money in Judicial Elections\n\nStanford University Press, August 2023\n\nThe idea that wealthy people use their money to influence things, including politics, law, and media will surprise very few people. However, as Michael S. Kang and Joanna Shepherd argue in this readable and rich study of the state judiciary, the effect of money on judicial outcomes should disturb and anger everyone. In the current system that elects state judges, the rich and powerful can spend money to elect and re-elect judges who decide cases the way they want. Free to Judge is about how and why money increasingly affects the dispensation of justice in our legal system, and what can be done to stop it.\n\nDaniel Kiel (The University of Memphis Cecil C. Humphreys School of Law)\n\nThe Transition: Interpreting Justice from Thurgood Marshall to Clarence Thomas\n\nStanford University Press, April 2023\n\nEvery Supreme Court transition presents an opportunity for a shift in the balance of the third branch of American government, but the replacement of Thurgood Marshall with Clarence Thomas in 1991 proved particularly momentous. Not only did it shift the ideological balance on the Court; it was inextricably entangled with the persistent American dilemma of race. In The Transition, this most significant transition is explored through the lives and writings of the first two African American justices on Court, touching on the lasting consequences for understandings of American citizenship as well as the central currents of Black political thought over the past century. In their lives, Thurgood Marshall and Clarence Thomas experienced the challenge of living and learning in a world that had enslaved their relatives and that continued to subjugate members of their racial group. On the Court, their judicial writings—often in concurrences or dissents—richly illustrate the ways in which these two individuals embodied these crucial American (and African American) debates—on the balance between state and federal authority, on the government’s responsibility to protect its citizens against discrimination, and on the best strategies for pursuing justice. The gap between Justices Marshall and Thomas on these questions cannot be overstated, and it reveals an extraordinary range of thought that has yet to be fully appreciated. The 1991 transition from Justice Marshall to Justice Thomas has had consequences that are still unfolding at the Court and in society. Arguing that the importance of this transition has been obscured by the relegation of these Justices to the sidelines of Supreme Court history, Daniel Kiel shows that it is their unique perspective as Black justices – the lives they have lived as African Americans and the rooting of their judicial philosophies in the relationship of government to African Americans – that makes this succession echo across generations.\n\nHaiyan Lee (Stanford University)\n\nA Certain Justice: Toward an Ecology of the Chinese Legal Imagination\n\nUniversity of Chicago Press, June 2023\n\nTo many outsiders, China has an image as a realm of Oriental despotism where law is at best window dressing and at worst an instrument of coercion and tyranny. In this highly original contribution to the interdisciplinary field of law and humanities, Haiyan Lee contends that this image arises from a skewed understanding of China’s political-legal culture, particularly the failure to distinguish what she calls high justice and low justice. In the Chinese legal imagination, Lee shows, justice is a vertical concept, with low justice between individuals firmly subordinated to the high justice of the state. China’s political-legal culture is marked by a mistrust of law’s powers, and as a result, it privileges substantive over procedural justice. Calling on a wide array of narratives—stories of crime and punishment, subterfuge and exposé, guilt and redemption—A Certain Justice helps us recognize the fight for justice outside the familiar arenas of liberal democracy and the rule of law.\n\nMikey Lee (Suffolk University) Frank Rudy Cooper (Willam S. Boyd School of Law at UNLV) Patricia Reeve (Suffolk University)\n\nDis/ability in Media, Law and History Intersectional, Embodied and Socially Constructed?\n\nRoutledge, June 2023\n\nThis book explores how being “disabled” originates in the physical world, social representations and rules, and historical power relations—the interplay of which render bodies “normal” or not. Do parking signs that represent people in wheelchairs as self-propelling influence how we view dis/ability? How do wheelchair users understand their own bodies and an environment not built for them? By asking questions like these the authors reveal how normalization has informed people’s experiences of their bodies and their fight for substantive equality. Understanding these processes requires acknowledging the tension between social construction and embodiment as well as centering the intersection of dis/abilities with other identities, such as race, class, gender, sex orientation, citizen status, and so on. Scholars and researchers will find that this book provides new avenues for thinking about dis/ability. A wider audience will find it accessible and informative.\n\nMichael J.Z. Mannheimer (Northern Kentucky University Salmon P. Chase College of Law)\n\nThe Fourth Amendment: Original Understandings and Modern Policing\n\nUniversity of Michigan Press, August 2023\n\nWhile it seems obvious that police are required to obey the law, this book argues that courts have lost track of that requirement due to misinterpreting the two constitutional provisions governing police conduct: the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments. The Fourth Amendment forbids “unreasonable searches and seizures” and is the source of most constitutional constraints on policing. Although that provision technically applies only to the federal government, the Fourteenth Amendment, ratified in the wake of the Civil War, has been deemed to apply the Fourth Amendment to the States. This book contends that the courts’ misinterpretation of these provisions has led them to hold federal and state law enforcement mistakenly to the same constitutional standards. By analyzing original understandings of the Fourth and Fourteenth, this book concludes that different constraints on searches and seizures should apply depending on whether the federal or a state government is acting. The book explores what Fourth Amendment doctrine would look like if the Supreme Court paid greater attention to values underlying the Fourteenth Amendment in applying the Fourth Amendment to the states.\n\nRobert J. Miller (ASU Sandra Day O’Connor College of Law), Robbie Ethridge (University of Mississippi)\n\nA Promise Kept: The Muscogee (Creek) Nation and McGirt v. Oklahoma\n\nUniversity of Oklahoma Press, January 2023\n\n“At the end of the Trail of Tears there was a promise,” U.S. Supreme Court Justice Neil Gorsuch wrote in the decision issued on July 9, 2020, in the case of McGirt v. Oklahoma. And that promise, made in treaties between the United States and the Muscogee (Creek) Nation more than 150 years earlier, would finally be kept. With the Court’s ruling, the full extent of the Muscogee (Creek) Reservation was reaffirmed—meaning that 3.25 million acres of land in Oklahoma, including part of the city of Tulsa, were recognized once again as “Indian Country” as defined by federal law. A Promise Kept explores the circumstances and implications of McGirt v. Oklahoma, likely the most significant Indian law case in well over 100 years. Combining legal analysis and historical context, this book gives an in-depth, accessible account of how the case unfolded and what it might mean for Oklahomans, the Muscogee (Creek) Nation, and other tribes throughout the United States.\n\nGregory S. Parks (Wake Forest School of Law) Frank Rudy Cooper (William S. Boyd School of Law at UNLV)\n\nFight the Power: Law & Policy through Hip Hop Songs\n\nCambridge University Press, February 2023\n\nTaking inspiration from Public Enemy’s lead vocalist Chuck D – who once declared that ‘rap is the CNN of young Black America’ – this volume brings together leading legal commentators to make sense of some of the most pressing law and policy issues in the context of hip-hop music and the ongoing struggle for Black equality. Contributors include MSNBC commentator Paul Butler, who grapples with race and policing through the lens of N.W.A.’s song ‘Fuck tha Police’, ACLU President Deborah Archer, who considers the 2014 uprisings in Ferguson, Missouri, and many other prominent scholars who speak of poverty, LGBTQ+ rights, mass incarceration, and other crucial topics of the day. Written to ‘say it plain’, this collection will be valuable not only to students and scholars of law, African-American studies, and hip-hop, but also to everyone who cares about creating a more just society.\n\nWendy E. Parmet (Northeastern University School of Law)\n\nConstitutional Contagion: Covid, the Courts and Public Health\n\nCambridge University Press, 2023\n\nConstitutional law has helped make Americans unhealthy. Drawing from law, history, political theory, and public health research, Constitutional Contagion explores the history of public health laws, the nature of liberty and individual rights, and the forces that make a nation more or less vulnerable to contagion. In this groundbreaking work, Wendy Parmet documents how the Supreme Court departed from past practice to stymie efforts to mitigate the COVID-19 pandemic and demonstrates how pre-pandemic court decisions helped to shatter social contracts, weaken democracy, and perpetuate the inequities that made the United States especially vulnerable when COVID-19 struck. Looking at judicial decisions from an earlier era, Parmet argues that the Constitution does not compel the stark individualism and disregard of public health that is evident in contemporary constitutional law decisions. Parmet shows us why, if we are to be a healthy nation, constitutional law must change.\n\nGerald N. Rosenberg (University of Chicago Law)\n\nThe Hollow Hope: Can Courts Bring About Social Change?\n\nUniversity of Chicago Press, May 2023\n\nSince its first publication in 1991, The Hollow Hope has spurred debate and challenged assumptions on both the left and the right about the ability of courts to bring about durable political and social change. What Gerald N. Rosenberg argued then, and what he confirms today through new evidence in this edition, is that it is nearly impossible to generate significant reforms through litigation: American courts are ineffective and relatively weak, far from the uniquely powerful sources for change they are often portrayed to be. This third edition includes new data and a substantially updated analysis of civil rights, abortion rights and access, women’s rights, and marriage equality. Addressing changes in the political and social environment, Rosenberg draws lessons from the re-segregation of public schools, victories in marriage equality, and new obstacles to abortion access. Through these and other cases, the third edition confirms the power of the book’s original explanatory framework and deepens our understanding of the limits of judicial action in support of social reform, as well as the conditions under which courts do produce change.\n\nPierre Schlag (University of Colorado Law School)\n\nTwilight of the American State\n\nUniversity of Michigan Press, 2023\n\nThe sudden emergence of the Trump nation surprised nearly everyone, including journalists, pundits, political consultants, and academics. When Trump won in 2016, his ascendancy was widely viewed as a fluke. Yet time showed it was instead the rise of a movement—angry, militant, revanchist, and unabashedly authoritarian. How did this happen? Twilight of the American State offers a sweeping exploration of how law and legal institutions helped prepare the grounds for this rebellious movement. The controversial argument is that, viewed as a legal matter, the American state is not just a liberal democracy, as most Americans believe. Rather, the American state is composed of an uneasy and unstable combination of different versions of the state—liberal democratic, administered, neoliberal, and dissociative. Each of these versions arose through its own law and legal institutions. Each emerged at different times historically. Each was prompted by deficits in the prior versions. Each has survived displacement by succeeding versions. All remain active in the contemporary moment—creating the political-legal dysfunction America confronts today. Pierre Schlag maps out a big picture view of the tribulations of the American state. The book abjures conventional academic frameworks, sets aside prescriptions for quick fixes, dispenses with lamentations about polarization, and bypasses historical celebrations of the American Spirit.\n\nJulie C. Suk (Fordham University Law School)\n\nAfter Misogyny: How the Law Fails Women & What to Do About It\n\nUniversity of California Press, April 2023\n\nJust as racism is embedded in the legal system, so is misogyny—even after the law proclaims gender equality and criminally punishes violence against women. In After Misogyny, Julie C. Suk shows that misogyny lies not in animus but in the overempowerment of men and the overentitlement of society to women’s unpaid labor and undervalued contributions. This is a book about misogyny without misogynists. From antidiscrimination law to abortion bans, the law fails women by keeping society’s dependence on women’s sacrifices invisible. Via a tour of constitutional change around the world, After Misogyny shows how to remake constitutional democracy. Women across the globe are going beyond the antidiscrimination paradigm of American legal feminism and fundamentally resetting baseline norms and entitlements. That process, what Suk calls a “constitutionalism of care,” builds the public infrastructure that women’s reproductive work has long made possible for free.\n\nPaul C. Weiler (Harvard University Law School), Stephen F. Ross (Penn State University), Michael C. Harper (Boston University School of Law), Jodi S. Balsam (Brooklyn Law School)\n\nSports and the Law\n\nWest Academic Publishing, 2023\n\nThe seventh edition of this leading casebook explores legal issues in both professional and amateur sports, organized to provide instructors with flexibility to cover selected doctrinal areas or industry sectors. Extended treatment is given to the key subjects of labor, antitrust, intellectual property, and the law of private associations. The casebook also covers the important topic of integrity in sports, the unique office of the league commissioner and its special concerns with the “best interests of sports”; the contract, antitrust, and labor law dimensions of the player-labor market; the role of the player agent in a unionized industry; the economic and legal implications of agreements among league owners and responses to rival leagues; the system of college athletics as governed by the NCAA and subject to Title IX; equity in sports, and the operation of international Olympic sports.\n\nWang Xi (Wuhan University), Richard Ottinger (Elisabeth Haub School of Law at Pace University)\n\nA Tale of Two Cities: A Comparison of Air Pollution Governance in the Los Angeles Area of the USA and the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei Area of China\n\nKluwer Law International, 2023\n\nThis book focuses on two of the world’s most prominent cases and explores how people in the areas of Los Angeles and Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei (BTH) established governance processes to combat air pollution and how the major actors in each area worked to make their region a better place to live. Employing the expertise of teams of knowledgeable environmental law experts from both China and the United States, the authors identify and analyze similarities and differences in the respective legal and policy experiences as actors succeeded in greatly improving the air quality of their areas.\n\nTaisu Zhang (Yale Law School)\n\nThe Ideological Foundations of Qing Taxation: Belief Systems, Politics, and Institutions\n\nCambridge University Press, February 2023\n\nHow states develop the capacity to tax is a question of fundamental importance to political science, legal theory, economics, sociology, and history. Increasingly, scholars believe that China’s relative economic decline in the 18th and 19th centuries was related to its weak fiscal institutions and limited revenue. This book argues that this fiscal weakness was fundamentally ideological in nature. Belief systems created through a confluence of traditional political ethics and the trauma of dynastic change imposed unusually deep and powerful constraints on fiscal policymaking and institutions throughout the final 250 years of China’s imperial history. Through the Qing example, this book combs through several interaction dynamics between state institutions and ideologies. The latter shapes the former, but the former can also significantly reinforce the political durability of the latter. In addition to its historical analysis of ideological politics, this book makes a major contribution to the longstanding debate on Sino-European divergence.\n\nTimothy Zick (William & Mary Law School)\n\nManaged Dissent: The Law of Public Protest\n\nCambridge University Press, May 2023\n\nThe mass street demonstrations that followed the 2020 police murder of George Floyd were perhaps the largest in American history. These events confirmed that even in a digital era, people rely on public dissent to communicate grievances, change public discourse, and stand in collective solidarity with others. However, the demonstrations also showed that the laws surrounding public protest make public contention more dangerous, more costly, and less effective. Police fired tear gas into peaceful crowds, used physical force against compliant demonstrators, imposed broad curfews, limited the places where protesters could assemble, and abused ‘unlawful assembly’ and other public disorder laws. These and other pathologies epitomize a system in which public protest is tightly constrained in the name of public order. Managed Dissent argues that in order to preserve the venerable tradition of public protest in the US, we must reform several aspects of the law of public protest.\n\nWilliam Araiza (Brooklyn Law School)\n\nRebuilding Expertise: Creating Effective and Trustworthy Regulation in an Age of Doubt\n\nNew York University Press, June 2022\n\nIn Rebuilding Expertise, William D. Araiza investigates the sources of the plummet in public trust in the ability of the Federal government to do the right thing and explains how we might rebuild trust in our public institutions. The author examines the history of this deterioration of trust and reveals how politicians from Clinton to Trump have allowed that deterioration to continue, and, in some cases, actively encouraged it. Using an interdisciplinary approach, with insights from history, political science, law, and public administration, Araiza explores our current bureaucratic malaise and presents a roadmap to finding our way out of it, toward a regime marked by effective, expert regulation that remains democratically accountable and politically legitimate.\n\nMichael S. Ariens (St. Mary’s University School of Law)\n\nThe Lawyer’s Conscience: A History of American Lawyer Ethics\n\nKansas Press, November 2022\n\nAmerican lawyers have defended the exercise of this power from the Revolution to the present by arguing their work is channeled by the profession’s standards of ethical behavior. Those standards demand that lawyers serve the public interest and the interests of their paying clients before themselves. The duties owed both to the public and to clients meant lawyers were in the marketplace selling their services, but not of the marketplace. This is the story of power and the limits of ethical constraints to ensure such power is properly wielded. The Lawyer’s Conscience is the first book examining the history of American lawyer ethics, ranging from the mid-eighteenth century to the “professionalism” crisis facing lawyers today.\n\nJack M. Balkin (Yale Law School)\n\nWhat Roe v. Wade Should Have Said\n\nThe Nation’s Top Legal Experts Rewrite America’s Most Controversial Decision, Revised Edition Intellectual Property and the Brain\n\nNYU Press, 2022\n\nOriginally published in 2005, What Roe v. Wade Should Have Said asked eleven distinguished constitutional scholars to rewrite the opinions in this landmark case in light of thirty years’ experience but making use only of sources available at the time of the original decision. Offering the best arguments for and against the constitutional right to abortion, the contributors have produced a series of powerful essays that get to the heart of this fascinating case. In addition, Jack Balkin gives a detailed historical introduction that chronicles the Roe litigation—and the constitutional and political clashes that followed it—and explains the Dobbs decision and its aftermath.\n\nMark Bartholomew (University at Buffalo School of Law)\n\nIntellectual Property and the Brain\n\nCambridge Press, 2022\n\nAlthough legal scholars have begun to explore the implications of neuroscientific research for criminal law, the field has yet to assess the potential of such research for intellectual property law – a legal regime governing over one-third of the US economy. Intellectual Property and the Brain addresses this gap by showing how tools meant to improve our understanding of human behavior inevitably shape the balance of power between artists and copyists, businesses and consumers. This first of its kind book demonstrates how neuroscience can improve our flawed approach to regulating creative conduct and commercial communications when applied with careful attention to the reasons that our system of intellectual property law exists. With a host of real-life examples of art, design, and advertising, the book charts a path forward for legal actors seeking reforms that will unlock artistic innovation, elevate economic productivity, and promote consumer welfare.\n\nMary Beth Beazley (University of Nevada, Las Vegas, Boyd School of Law) and Monte Smith (Ohio State University Moritz College of Law)\n\nBriefs and Beyond: Persuasive Legal Writing\n\nAspen Publishing, February 2022\n\nThe book provides law professors options to supplement a persuasive writing course with complaints, demand letters, and other persuasive documents while not overwhelming their students. Professors and student will benefit from: a behavioral approach to legal writing; a focus on how documents look as well as what they say; sidebars that answer students’ common questions as they go along; effective formulas for legal writing that ease the writing process, and; many examples of both good and bad writing throughout that illustrate concepts covered in the text.\n\nRoy L. Brooks (University of San Diego)\n\nDiversity Judgments Democratizing Judicial Legitimacy\n\nCambridge University Press, March 2022\n\nThe US Supreme Court’s legitimacy-its diminishing integrity and contribution to the good of society-is being questioned today like no other time in recent memory. Criticisms reflect the perspectives of both ‘insiders’ (straight white males) and ‘outsiders’ (mainly people of color, women, and the LGBTQ community). Neither perspective digs deep enough to get at the root of the Court’s legitimacy problem, which is one of process. The Court’s process of decision-making is antiquated and out of sync with a society that looks and thinks nothing like the America of the eighteenth century, when the process was first implemented. The current process marginalizes many Americans who have a right to feel disenfranchised. Leading scholar of jurisprudence Roy L. Brooks demonstrates how the Court can modernize and democratize its deliberative process, to be more inclusive of the values and life experiences of Americans who are not straight white males.\n\nDan Canon (University of Louisville, Louis D. Brandeis School of Law)\n\nPleading Out: How Plea Bargaining Creates a Permanent Criminal Class\n\nBasic Books, March 2022\n\nMost Americans believe that the jury trial is the backbone of our criminal justice system. But in fact, the vast majority of cases never make it to trial: almost all criminal convictions are the result of a plea bargain, a deal made entirely out of the public eye. The author argues that plea bargaining may swiftly dispose of cases, but it also fuels an unjust system. This practice produces a massive underclass of people who are restricted from voting, working, and otherwise participating in society. And while innocent people plead guilty to crimes they did not commit in exchange for lesser sentences, the truly guilty can get away with murder. The book looks at the ugly truth about what’s wrong with America’s criminal justice system today—and offers a prescription for meaningful change.\n\nErwin Chemerinsky (University of California, Berkeley School of Law)\n\nWorse Than Nothing: The Dangerous Fallacy of Originalism\n\nYale University Press, September 2022\n\nOriginalism, the view that the meaning of a constitutional provision is fixed when it is adopted, was once the fringe theory of a few extremely conservative legal scholars but is now a well-accepted mode of constitutional interpretation. Three of the Supreme Court’s nine justices explicitly embrace the originalist approach, as do increasing numbers of judges in the lower courts. The author gives a comprehensive analysis of the problems that make originalism unworkable as a method of constitutional interpretation. He argues that the framers themselves never intended constitutional interpretation to be inflexible and shows how it is often impossible to know what the “original intent” of any particular provision was. Though supporters tout it as a politically neutral and objective method, originalist interpretation tends to disappear when its results fail to conform to modern conservative ideology.\n\nV. Gerard Comizio (American University Washington College of Law)\n\nVirtual Currency Law: The Emerging Legal and Regulatory Framework\n\nAspen Publishing, 2022\n\nThis book explores the emerging legal and regulatory framework governing virtual currency activities. Since the advent of the first virtual currency (Bitcoin) in 2008, a new global financial ecosystem has emerged, composed of an increasing number and variety of digital assets. In this context, the book explores how governments, regulators and legal experts are increasingly looking to existing securities, banking, commodities, money transmission, payment systems, commercial, anti-money laundering, fintech, cyber and data security, tax, Constitutional and international laws to address the unique, novel, and complex issues presented by virtual currency. The book also explores how the ubiquitous nature of virtual currency has led to it being viewed as the legal and regulatory equivalent of a wide range of traditional corporate and financial services products, services, activities, and investments.\n\nBridget J. Crawford (Elisabeth Haub School of Law at Pace University) and Emily Gold-Waldman (Elisabeth Haub School of Law at Pace University)\n\nMenstruation Matters: Challenging the Law’s Silence On Periods\n\nNYU Press, June 2022\n\nThe book explores the role of law in the movement to recognize the fundamental human right to address menstruation in a safe and affordable way, free of stigma, shame, or barriers to access. It asks what the law currently says about menstruation and provides a roadmap for legal reform that can move society closer to a world where no one is held back or disadvantaged by menstruation. The authors examine these issues in a wide range of contexts, from schools to workplaces to prisons to tax policies and more. Ultimately, they seek to transform both law and society so that menstruation is no longer an obstacle to full participation in all aspects of public and private life.\n\nJames E. Fleming (Boston University School of Law)\n\nConstructing Basic Liberties: A Defense of Substantive Due Process\n\nUniversity of Chicago Press, August 2022\n\nFrom reproductive rights to marriage for same-sex couples, many basic liberties owe their protection to landmark Supreme Court decisions that have hinged on the doctrine of substantive due process. This doctrine is controversial—a battleground for opposing views around the relationship between law and morality in circumstances of moral pluralism—and is deeply vulnerable today. The author rebuts popular arguments against substantive due process and shows that the Supreme Court has constructed basic liberties through common law constitutional interpretation: reasoning by analogy from one case to the next and making complex normative judgments about what basic liberties are significant for personal self-government.\n\nRalph H. Folsom (University of San Diego Law), Michael P. Van Alstine (University of Maryland), Michael D. Ramsey (University of San Diego Law)\n\nPrinciples of International Business Transactions\n\nWest Academic Press, 2022\n\nThe Fifth Edition of Principles of International Business Transactions provides a more comprehensive examination of the law relevant to the subject matter and detailed citations to caselaw and other supporting authorities. It can be used by courts and legal practitioners as a resource for research and analysis, as well as by students and professors as a supplement for any international business law course. It tracks the authors’ popular problem-oriented coursebook, International Business Transactions. Coverage moves sequentially from structuring international sales transactions to international sales law and letters of credit to regulation of international trade to transfers of technology to foreign investment to international business dispute settlement.\n\nAmy Gajda (Tulane Law School)\n\nSeek and Hide: THE TANGLED HISTORY OF THE RIGHT TO PRIVACY\n\nViking Publishing, April 2022\n\nShould everyone have privacy in their personal lives? Can privacy exist in a public place? Is there a right to be left alone even in the United States? You may be startled to realize that the original framers were sensitive to the importance of privacy interests relating to sexuality and intimate life, but mostly just for powerful and privileged (and usually white) men.The battle between an individual’s right to privacy and the public’s right to know has been fought for centuries. The founders demanded privacy for all the wrong press-quashing reasons. Supreme Court jus­tice Louis Brandeis famously promoted First Amend­ment freedoms but argued strongly for privacy too; and presidents from Thomas Jefferson through Don­ald Trump confidently hid behind privacy despite intense public interest in their lives. Today privacy seems simultaneously under siege and surging. And that’s doubly dangerous, as legal expert Amy Gajda argues. Too little privacy leaves ordinary people vulnerable to those who deal in and publish soul-crushing secrets. Too much means the famous and infamous can cloak themselves in secrecy and dodge accountability. Seek and Hide carries us from the very start, when privacy concepts first entered American law and society, to now, when the law al­lows a Silicon Valley titan to destroy a media site like Gawker out of spite. Muckraker Upton Sinclair, like Nellie Bly before him, pushed the envelope of privacy and propriety and then became a privacy advocate when journalists used the same techniques against him. By the early 2000s we were on our way to today’s full-blown crisis in the digital age, worrying that smartphones, webcams, basement publishers, and the forever internet had erased the right to privacy completely.\n\nLewis A.

Zettler (The Ohio State University Moritz College of Law)\n\nFood and Drug Law\n\nWest Academic, 2022\n\nFDA regulation touches most products that fill the shelves of our supermarkets and drug stores and virtually every product prescribed or used by the medical profession. Few other agencies regulate products or activities that play so intimate a role in our daily lives. Food and Drug Law is the law governing the actions taken by FDA and its sister agencies to oversee the safety of this vast universe of products, to ensure that the labeling (and in some cases advertising) of products is accurate and reliable, and to shepherd safe and effective new medical products onto the market. The book contains not only the most important court cases in the field, but also materials that show how food and drug law is developed and enforced outside of court.\n\nMelissa A. Hale (Loyola University Chicago School of Law)\n\nA First Generation’s Guide to Law School\n\neLangdell Press, June 2022\n\nThis is written as a guide for first-generation students who are entering or are currently attending law school. It introduces students to law school vocabulary and available resources, gives guidance about how to prepare for the unique challenges of law school, and provides a roadmap for things like participating in class, studying for and taking exams, joining extracurriculars, taking care of your mental health, and networking. The guide includes interactive exercises that test the student’s knowledge of concepts, encourage the student to reflect on their own interests and experiences, and explore resources in their law school and elsewhere.\n\nTamara Rice Lave (University of Miami School of Law)\n\nSexual Assault on Campus: Defending Due Process\n\nCambridge University Press, June 2022\n\nFair adjudication of campus sexual assault is one of the most divisive issues facing the United States. Victims contend that schools aren’t doing enough to protect them, and accused students complain that they are presumed guilty. Sexual Assault on Campus: Defending Due Process begins by critically assessing the extent of the problem, before explaining why the criminal justice system has been unable to respond adequately. The book discusses the Department of Education’s attempts to force schools to take campus assault seriously and uses original data in assessing the fairness of adjudication in the wake of the 2011 ‘Dear Colleague Letter.’ It also includes excerpts from interviews with complainants, accused students, and administrators, which offer readers a first-hand account of these proceedings. Finally, the book provides a critical, in-depth look at the Title IX regulations put in place by the Trump Administration, with detailed recommendations for how they can be improved.\n\nPierre Legrand (Northwestern University Pritzker School of Law)\n\nNegative Comparative Law: A Strong Programme for Weak Thought\n\nCambridge University Press, June 2022\n\nWritten under the sign of Beckett, this book addresses comparative law’s commitment to the deterritorialization of the legal and its attendant claim for the normative relevance of foreign law locally in the fabrication of statutory determinations, judicial opinions, or academic reflections. Wanting to withstand the law’s persistent tendency towards nationalist retrenchment and counter comparative law’s institutional marginalization, the fifteen essays at hand impart radical and discerning intellectual equipment in order to foster the valorization of the legally foreign and the comparative motion. In particular, the critique informing this manifesto examines pre-eminent topics like culture and difference, understanding and translatability, objectivity and truth, invention and tracing. Harnessing insights from a range of disciplinary discourses, this book contends that comparatists must boldly desist from their field’s dominant epistemology and embrace a practice much better attuned to the study of foreignness.\n\nJ. Rich Leonard (Campbell University Norman Adrian Wiggins School of Law)\n\nFrom Welcome to Windhoek: A Judge’s Journey\n\nLawyers Mutual Consulting & Services LLC, July 2022\n\nThe book details the story of how a boy from rural Welcome, North Carolina grew up to become an innovative judge, global citizen, and go-to guy for court-building in emerging African nations. Along the way, he organizes the first-ever judicial conference in Tanzania, jogs with children in Lusaka, dances with a python, and has adventures ranging from the harrowing to the hilarious. In the end, he discovers the distance between Welcome and Windhoek is not as great as he imagined, and that both places now occupy adjoining spaces in his heart.\n\nSarah Lora (Lewis & Clark Law School), Robert G. Nassau, Sam Rock\n\nTax Issues for Immigrants\n\nABA Tax Section, 2022\n\nThe book introduces the reader to the basics of taxation for immigrants, their spouses, and their dependents, plus immigration law as it intersects with tax law. With the increasingly complex obligations of immigrant taxpayers, especially after the PATH Act and the TCJA, Tax Issues for Immigrants seeks to provide assistance to practitioners guiding clients through the intersection of immigration law and tax law. An expansion of a chapter in Effectively Representing Your Client Before the IRS, the book introduces different types of immigrant statuses and how the tax code treats them, and examines how the tax code treats resident and nonresident taxpayers and taxpayers with spouses and/or dependents in foreign countries. The book also looks at how the tax code treats taxpayers, spouses, and dependents with ITIN numbers, including their eligibility for dependent exemptions, head of household filing status, and credits. It provides general information about the immigration consequences for filing or non-filing of returns, as well as nonpayment of taxes, and it discusses taxpayer language access rights when communicating with the IRS.\n\nGerard N. Magliocca (Indiana University Robert H. McKinney School of Law)\n\nWashington’s Heir: The Life of Justice Bushrod Washington\n\nOxford University Press, 2022\n\nIn Washington’s Heir, Gerard N. Magliocca provides the first published biography of Bushrod Washington, one of the least studied Founding Fathers. Born in 1762, Justice Washington fought in the Revolutionary War, served in Virginia’s ratifying convention for the Constitution, and was Chief Justice John Marshall’s partner in establishing the authority of the Supreme Court. An in-depth look at Justice Washington’s story that gives insight into his personal thoughts through his own secret journal, Washington’s Heir sheds new light not only on George Washington, John Marshall, and the Constitution, but also on America’s ongoing struggle to become a more perfect union.\n\nChibli Mallat (University of Utah S.J. Quinney College of Law)\n\nThe Normalization of Saudi Law\n\nOxford University Press, 2022\n\nSaudi Arabia has never commanded more attention and yet it remains one of the world’s least understood countries. The book dives into the heart of Saudi society, politics, and business by exploring the workings of its courts. Legal practitioners and scholars will find a comprehensive analysis of the law’s operation in the kingdom. The practitioner will access full thematic coverage of all important fields: judicial organization, contracts and torts, crime, family, property, administration, commerce, companies, banking, insolvency, the stock market, the constitution, succession, and human rights, with major statutes and a large number of court decisions.\n\nJohn Travis Marshall (Georgia State University College of Law) Ryan Rowberry (Georgia State University College of Law) Susan Kuo (University of South Carolina School of Law)\n\nThe Cambridge Handbook of Disaster Law and Policy\n\nCambridge University Press, October 2022\n\nThis century’s major disasters from Hurricane Katrina and the Fukushima nuclear meltdown to devastating Nepalese earthquakes and the recent crippling volcanic eruptions and tsunamis in Tonga have repeatedly taught that government institutions are ill-prepared for major disaster events, leaving the most vulnerable among us unprotected. These tragedies represent just the beginning of a new era of disaster – an era of floods, heatwaves, droughts, and pandemics fueled by climate change. Laws and government institutions have struggled to adapt to the scope of the challenge; old models of risk no longer apply. This Handbook provides timely guidance, taking stock of the field of disaster law and policy as it has developed since Hurricane Katrina. Experts from a wide range of academic and practical backgrounds address the root causes of disaster vulnerability and offer solutions to build more resilient communities to ensure that no one is left behind.\n\nDaniel Medwed (Northeastern University School of Law)\n\nBarred: Why the Innocent Can’t Get Out of Prison\n\nBasic Books/Hachette Book Group, 2022\n\nThousands of innocent people are behind bars in the United States. But proving their innocence and winning their release is nearly impossible. In the book, the author argues that our justice system’s stringent procedural rules are largely to blame for the ongoing punishment of the innocent. Those rules guarantee criminal defendants just one opportunity to appeal their convictions directly to a higher court. Afterward, the wrongfully convicted can pursue only a few narrow remedies. Even when there is strong evidence of a miscarriage of justice, rigid guidelines, bias, and deference toward lower courts all too often prevent exoneration. Offering clear explanations of legal procedures alongside heart-wrenching stories of their devastating impact, the book exposes how the system is stacked against the innocent and makes a powerful call for change.\n\nNancy Moore (Boston University School of Law)\n\nProfessional Responsibility for Business Lawyers\n\nAspen Publishing, January 2022\n\nThis new casebook covers the fundamental components of a traditional Professional Responsibility course with a focus on how these issues arise in a transactional business law practice. It is designed for use in either a two- or three-credit basic course in Professional Responsibility course or an advanced course or seminar specifically on PR in business and transactional law. The traditional pedagogical approach uses a mixture of narrative and descriptive content, edited cases and ethics opinions, discussion questions, and problems.\n\nLumen N. Mulligan (University of Kansas School of Law), Steven S. Gensler (University of Oklahoma College of Law)\n\nFederal Rules of Civil Procedure, Rules and Commentary, 2022 ed.\n\nThomson Reuters, 2022\n\nThis is the premier practice-oriented guide to using the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, written by two leading experts including a former member of the Civil Rules Advisory Committee. The authors explain in detail what each rule covers, how it works, how it has been interpreted by courts, and how it is used in practice. This title is updated annually with new rule amendments, the latest caselaw, and emerging trends and issues integrated directly into the analysis. Special emphasis and expanded coverage is given to the topics that matter the most in practice, including pleading and amendments, motions to dismiss, discovery, and summary judgment.\n\nÁngel R. Oquendo (University of Connecticut School of Law)\n\nThrough Thin and Thick\n\nCambridge University Press, June 2022\n\nThe book launches with examples, concrete cases, or political confrontations to explain how to conceive the safeguards at stake. For instance, free speech demands permitting seemingly offensive expression plus promoting a diverse and open public debate. The work scrutinizes specific guaranties, such as those pertaining to asylum, citizenship, abortion, due process, self-determination, or the environment. It presents them as engendering problems peculiar to them. Next, the discussion dissects how precepts, like human rights and democracy, may contingently clash despite their overall commensurability. Finally, it underscores the interconnection of negative, substantive, and national entitlements with their positive, procedural, and international counterparts.\n\nCedric Merilin Powell (University of Louisville Brandeis School of Law)\n\nPost-Racial Constitutionalism and the Roberts Court: Rhetorical Neutrality and the Perpetuation of Inequality\n\nCambridge University Press, 2022\n\nPost-Racial Constitutionalism and the Roberts Court: rhetorical neutrality and the perpetuation of inequality analyses how the Roberts Court plays an essential role in advancing neutrality— “the way to stop discrimination on the basis of race is to stop discriminating on the basis on race”—to promote post-racialism. No use of race, even if it is in the promotion of eradicating inequality, is appropriate because we have a fair and neutral process that is legitimate. The Court has created a democratic myth of societal progress by promoting post-racialism: race and racism is never acknowledged, so the Court consistently reaches conclusions that erase the fundamental rights of historically oppressed groups. In comprehensive detail, the book discusses Rhetorical Neutrality, how the Court expresses itself through the language of neutrality.\n\nJedediah Purdy (Duke Law School)\n\nTwo Cheers for Politics: Why Democracy is Flawed, Frightening—and Our Best Hope\n\nBasic Books, 2022\n\nAmericans across the political spectrum agree that our democracy is in crisis. We view our political opponents with disdain, if not terror, and an increasing number of us are willing to consider authoritarian alternatives. The author argues that this heated political culture is a symptom not of too much democracy but too little. Today, the decisions that most affect our lives and our communities are often made outside the political realm entirely, as market ideology, constitutional law, and cultural norms effectively remove broad swaths of collective life from the table of collective decision. The result is a weakened and ineffective political system and an increasingly unequal and polarized society. If we wish to renew that society, we’ll need to claw back the ground that we’ve ceded to anti-politics and entrust one another with the power to shape our common life.\n\nSarah E. Redfield (University of New Hampshire Law), Bernice B. Donald\n\nExtending Justice: Strategies to Increase Inclusion and Reduce Bias\n\nCarolina Academic Press, 2022\n\nExtending Justice: Strategies to Increase Inclusion and Reduce Bias offers expert perspective and actionable tools for interrupting bias. The first book in this series, Enhancing Justice: Reducing Bias, was written to increase awareness of implicit bias and serve as a benchbook for judges. This book goes the next step to be useful to a wider audience with virtually every chapter offering thoughtful context and practical strategies for interrupting unintentional bias. Edited by two proven leaders in the field, with twenty-six chapters written by fifty diverse authors, the voices here combine to provide wide-ranging and user-friendly science and tools.\n\nAlice Ristroph (Brooklyn Law School)\n\nCriminal Law: An Integrated Approach\n\neLangdell Press, August 2022\n\nThis is a new textbook designed for a first-year law school course in criminal law. Its aim is to present an accurate overview of American criminal law as it operates in the twenty-first century, with attention to racial disparities and other inequalities and to the features of criminal law that produce these inequalities. The book covers basic principles of criminal liability and introduces students to standard definitions of property crimes, crimes against the person, and drug and gun offenses. Its approach is integrated in that students learn these areas of “substantive” law in context with the official decision-making that is crucial to the operation of criminal law in practice: criminalization, enforcement, and adjudication decisions.\n\nPaul F. Rothstein (Georgetown University Law Center), David Crump (University of Houston Law Center), and Ronald J. Coleman (Georgetown University Law Center)\n\nEvidence in a Nutshell\n\nWest Academic, 2022\n\nThe latest version of the Federal Rules is the anchor of this book, with some state variations noted where important. The text summarizes significant U.S. Supreme Court decisions, including the latest Confrontation Clause cases; additional leading cases; forefront expert, scientific, and electronic evidence developments; and principal schools of evidentiary thought. Includes practical implementation as well as scholarly approaches. It pays attention to the litigation process as a whole and includes interdisciplinary cross-pollination where helpful. Numerous signpost-type headings and subheadings light the way, concisely summarizing the gist of each evidentiary concept. The detailed table of contents alone could serve as a complete course outline. Distinctively, an analytical, thoughtful approach is emphasized throughout.\n\nZahr K. Said (University of Washington School of Law)\n\nTort Law: A 21st-Century Approach\n\neLangdell Press, August 2022\n\nThis book introduces students to tort law with a set of cases and methods that have been updated for 21st century legal education. Pairing classic cases with a host of recent, lesser-known cases, the casebook deliberately provides opportunities to engage with issues of race, gender, sexual orientation, ability, class as well as fundamental questions of civil justice. The book’s introduction diverges from the standard method of teaching torts, by framing the subject matter in terms of the three primary regimes of tort law—negligence, strict liability and the intentional torts—and by setting the stakes for questions of policy from the outset.\n\nSeana Shiffrin (UCLA Law)\n\nDemocratic Law\n\nOxford University Press, 2022\n\nIn this book, based on her 2017 Berkeley Tanner Lectures, Seana Valentine Shiffrin offers an original, deontological account of democracy, law, and their interrelation. Her central thesis is that democracy and democratic law have intrinsically valuable, interconnected communicative functions. Democracy and democratic law together allow us to fulfill our fundamental duties to convey to each another messages of equal respect by fashioning the sorts of public joint commitments to act that a sincere message of equal respect requires. Law and democracy are essential to each other: the aspirations of democracy cannot be realized except through a legal system, and, conversely, law can fulfill its primary function only in a democratic context.\n\nTed M. Sichelman (University of San Diego), Shyamkrishna Balganesh (Columbia Law School), Henry E. Smith (Harvard Law School)\n\nWesley Hohfeld A Century Later: Edited Work, Select Personal Papers, and Original Commentaries\n\nCambridge University Press, 2022\n\nWesley Hohfeld is known the world over as the legal theorist who famously developed a taxonomy of legal concepts. His contributions to legal thinking have stood the test of time, remaining relevant nearly a century after they were first published. Yet, little systematic attention has been devoted to exploring the full significance of his work. Beginning with a lucid, annotated version of Hohfeld’s most important article, this volume is the first to offer a comprehensive look at the scope, significance, reach, intricacies, and shortcomings of Hohfeld’s work. Featuring insights from leading legal thinkers, the book also contains many of Hohfeld’s previously unseen personal papers, shedding new light on the complex motivations behind Hohfeld’s projects. Together, these selected papers and original essays reveal a portrait of a multifaceted and ambitious intellectual who did not live long enough to see the impact of his ideas on the study of law.\n\nSteven D. Smith (University of San Diego), Larry Alexander (University of San Diego), James Allan (University of Queensland), Maimon Schwarzschild (University of San Diego)\n\nA Principled Constitution?: Four Skeptical Views\n\nRowman & Littlefield, September 2022\n\nIs the United States Constitution the embodiment of certain principles? The four authors of this book for a variety of reasons, and with somewhat different emphases, believe the answer is no. Those who authored the Constitution no doubt all believed in liberty, equality, and, with caveats, republican self-government values, or if you will, principles. But they had different conceptions of those principles and what those principles entailed for constituting a government. Although the Constitution they created reflected, in some sense, their principles, the Constitution itself was a specific list of do’s and don’ts that its creators hoped would gain the allegiance of the newly independent and sovereign states. And, for somewhat different reasons, the authors of this book believe that was a good thing.\n\nGabriel H. Teninbaum (Suffolk University Law School)\n\nProductizing Legal Work\n\nAspen Publishing, 2022\n\nFor millions of Americans, creating an estate plan no longer involves a high-priced attorney. Instead, they can log into LegalZoom and get the job done for a fraction of the cost. The same goes for filing a tax return: no need for a CPA, TurboTax can do it for you! At the heart of these tools (productized services) is a technique for converting work that has traditionally been done by a professional for a limited number of clients to work that can be shared, licensed or sold to a much wider audience (usually through the use of online or specialized software technologies). People create productized services in order to help more people and create new revenue streams. Consumers, in turn, get access to valuable services at lower cost. While creating productized services was once challenging and expensive, a new generation of facilitating tools enable any enterprising person – including law students and lawyers – to productize services with greater ease than ever before. This book unpacks the concept and impact of productizing services and provides a step-by-step introduction to the process of productizing legal work.\n\nLeo R. Tsao (Harvard Law School), Daniel S. Kahn (Harvard Law School) and Eugene Soltes\n\nCorporate Criminal Investigations and Prosecutions\n\nAspen Publishing, September 2022\n\nOver the past two decades, corporate criminal liability has developed into one of the fastest-growing and most dynamic areas of legal practice. The growth of corporate criminal enforcement has correlated with a broad shift in how the government investigates and resolves corporate criminal violations. As a result of these developments, the practice of investigating, prosecuting, and resolving corporate criminal cases has many significant differences from other areas of criminal or civil law. In this book, the authors open a window into all aspects of corporate criminal investigations and prosecutions.\n\nJoan W. Howarth (University of Nevada, Las Vegas Law and Michigan State University Law)\n\nShaping the Bar: The Future of Attorney Licensing\n\nStanford University Press, December 2022\n\nIn Shaping the Bar, Joan Howarth describes how the twin gatekeepers of the legal profession—law schools and licensers—are failing the public. Attorney licensing should be laser-focused on readiness to practice law with the minimum competence of a new attorney. According to Howarth, requirements today are both too difficult and too easy. Amid the crisis in unmet legal services, record numbers of law school graduates—disproportionately people of color—are failing bar exams that are not meaningful tests of competence to practice. At the same time, after seven years of higher education, hundreds of thousands of dollars of law school debt, two months of cramming legal rules, and success on a bar exam, a candidate can be licensed to practice law without ever having been in a law office or even seen a lawyer with a client.\n\nLawrence A. Zelenak (Duke Law School) and Ajay K. Mehrotra (Northwestern Pritzker School of Law)\n\nA Half-Century with the Internal Revenue Code: The Memoirs of Stanley S. Surrey\n\nCarolina Academic Press, 2022\n\nStanley S. Surrey was the most prominent mid-twentieth-century American tax law academic, and the federal government official with the greatest influence on tax policy over that same period (aside from politicians). His professional life with the federal tax system spanned half a century, ending only with his death at the age of 73 in 1984. This edited volume includes an comprehensive introductory essay on Surrey’s professional life and his contributions to tax policy, as well as extensive annotations providing important background on the people and events Surrey discusses in the memoirs.\n\nCorey Rayburn Yung (University of Kansas School of Law), Sarah Deer (University of Kansas School of Law), Bennett Capers (Fordham University School of Law)\n\nFeminist Judgments: Rewritten Criminal Law Opinions\n\nCambridge University Press, December 2022\n\nThe authors explore the question: ‘Is it possible to be both a judge and a feminist?’ by re-writing seminal opinions that implicate critical dimensions of criminal law jurisprudence, from the sexual assault law to provocation to cultural defenses to the death penalty. We have had #MeToo campaigns and #SayHerName campaigns, and yet not enough has changed. The book looks at how all justice might look different through a feminist lens."
