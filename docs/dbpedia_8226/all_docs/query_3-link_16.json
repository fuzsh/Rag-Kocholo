        "text": "U.S. Magistrate Judge Robin Meriweather, who has served on the federal bench in D.C. for the past six years has been nominated to a seat on the U.S. Court of Federal Claims.\n\nBackground\n\nMeriweather received a B.A. from the University of Michigan in 1995, and her J.D. from Yale Law School in 1998. After graduation, Meriweather clerked for Judge Merrick Garland on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit and subsequently joined Jenner & Block as an Associate.\n\nIn 2007, Meriweather joined the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the District of Columbia where she stayed until appointed as a U.S. Magistrate Judge in 2017.\n\nHistory of the Seat\n\nMeriweather has been nominated for a seat on the U.S. Court of Federal Claims (CFC), an Article I court that hears monetary claims against the federal government. Judges to the CFC are appointed for 15-year terms, and can be reappointed. The seat Meriweather was nominated for opened up on September 30, 2023 with the retirement of Judge Patricia Campbell-Smith.\n\nLegal Experience\n\nMeriweather started her legal career at the firm of Jenner and Block, where she worked on a number of communications cases. See, e.g., Consumer Electronics Ass. v. Fed. Communications Comm’n, 347 F.3d 291 (D.C. Cir. 2003); Verizon Pennsylvania v. Pennsylvania Pub. Utility, 380 F. Supp. 2d 627 (E.D. Penn. 2005). Notably, she was appointed as an amicus on behalf of a former D.C. employee on a disability discrimination case. See Smith v. Dist. of Columbia, 430 F.3d (D.C. Cir. 2005). The D.C. Circuit reversed a grant of summary judgment against the plaintiff on the discrimination claim and remanded for trial. See id.\n\nFrom 2007 to 2017, Meriweather worked at the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the District of Columbia. At the office, Meriweather worked in the Civil Division at the U.S. Attorney’s Office, defending claims brought against the federal government. See, e.g., Boardley v. U.S. Dep’t of Interior, 615 F.3d 508 (D.C. Cir. 2010). Notably, Meriweather argued before the D.C. Circuit on a suit arising from the termination of a contract with Voice of America after a contractor appeared in a music video criticizing the U.S. involvement in Iraq. See Navab-Safavi v. Glassman, 637 F.3d 311 (D.C. Cir. 2011).\n\nJudicial Experience\n\nMeriweather has served as a U.S. Magistrate Judge for the District of Columbia since her appointment in 2017. As Magistrate Judge, Meriweather handled reports and recommendations for district court judges as well as discovery matters. See, e.g., In re DiGuilian, 314 F. Supp. 3d 1 (D.D.C. 2018). Notably, Meriweather ruled that the District of Columbia had failed to adequately preserve evidence in a suit regarding four individuals who committed suicide in a D.C. jail, finding the District responsible for spoliation of evidence. See Mannina v. Dist. o Columbia, 437 F. Supp. 3d 1 (D.D.C. 2020).\n\nPolitical Activity\n\nMeriweather has made political contributions only to California Attorney General Rob Bonta, who was a classmate of hers at Yale Law School.\n\nOverall Assessment\n\nMeriweather comes to the Court of Federal Claims with extensive experience with civil litigation, particularly that affecting the federal government. She should be able to hit the ground running once confirmed.\n\nPatent attorney Molly Silfen, who is coming off a stint as a staffer with the Senate Judiciary Committee will have an opportunity to go before the Committee again, this time as a judicial nominee.\n\nBackground\n\nSilfen received a B.A. from Yale University in 2002, and her J.D. from Harvard Law School in 2006. After graduation, Silfen joined Finnegan Henderson Farabow Garrett & Dunner LLP.\n\nIn 2008, Silfen completed a clerkship for Judge Alan Lourie on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit and then returned to Finnegan. In 2013, she joined the U.S. Patent & Trademark Office as a solicitor, where she has worked since. Silfen nonetheless completed details at the Department of Justice’s Civil Division and with the U.S. Senate Committee on the Judiciary.\n\nHistory of the Seat\n\nSilfen has been nominated for a seat on the U.S. Court of Federal Claims (CFC), an Article I court that hears monetary claims against the federal government. Judges to the CFC are appointed for 15-year terms, and can be reappointed. The seat Silfen was nominated for opened up on July 13, 2018, with the move to senior status of Judge Susan Braden. On October 3, 2019, the Trump Administration nominated administrative patent judge Grace Obermann to replace Braden. However, Obermann’s nomination never moved and was left unconfirmed by the end of the Congress. Biden appointed Silfen on February 27, 2023.\n\nLegal Experience\n\nSilfen’s career is split between her time in private practice and her time working as a patent solicitor. In private practice, Silfen worked with Judge Kara Stoll, appointed in 2015 to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, on behalf of Cardiac Pacemakers in a patent infringement action against St. Jude Medical, Inc. See Cardiac Pacemakers, Inc. v. St. Jude Medical, Inc., 576 F.3d 1348 (Fed. Cir. 2009). She also represented defendants in infringement actions. See, e.g., EPlus, Inc. v. Lawson Software, Inc., 700 F.3d 509 (Fed. Cir. 2012).\n\nIn her role with the U.S. Patent & Trademark Office, Silfen has joined the legal team in a number of cases before the U.S. Supreme Court. See, e.g., Matal v. Tam, 137 S. Ct. 1744 (U.S. 2017); Iancu v. Brunetti, 139 S. Ct. 2294 (U.S. 2019). Notably, Silfen was part of the government’s legal team seeking approval of the current system of Administrative Law Judges hearing cases regarding the validity of patents. See United States v. Arthrex, Inc., 141 S. Ct. 1970 (U.S. 2021). In a 5-4 decision, the Supreme Court ruled that the administrative judges in question were appointed in violation of the Appointments Clause of the U.S. Constitution. See id.\n\nPolitical Activity\n\nSilfen has a few political contributions to her name, including one to President Obama in 2008 and three to New Hampshire Executive Council candidate Leah Plunkett.\n\nWritings\n\nSilfen has frequently written both academically and on the law. As a law student, for example, Silfen wrote on the intellectual property implications of the funding of stem cell research and on the impact of the bans on partial birth abortion on privilege. See Molly Silfen, How Will California’s Funding of Stem Cell Research Impact Innovation? Recommendations for an Intellectual Property Policy, 18 Harv. J. L. Pol’y 2 (Spring 2005). See also M Silfen, I Want My Information Back: Evidentiary Privilege Following the Partial-Birth Abortion Cases, Journal of Health Law (Jan. 1, 2005). As a practitioner, Silfen has further elaborated on patent law. See, e.g., Daniel Kazhdan & Molly Silfen, Inventors Beware: The Danger of Getting Too Many Patents, 60 Santa Clara L. Rev. 289 (2020).\n\nOverall Assessment\n\nDespite her youth, Silfen has gained considerable experience in patent and intellectual property litigation. While her writings are sure to be scrutinized closely in the confirmation process, Silfen should still expect to see a comfortable confirmation.\n\nDespite having six appointees confirmed to the court in 2020 alone, the U.S. Court of Federal Claims (CFC) has been battling a long-term vacancy crisis, with four seats on the court vacant. In an effort to fill them, President Biden has renominated a stalled nominee from the Obama Administration: Armando Bonilla.\n\nBackground\n\nBorn in 1967 in New York City, Armando Omar Bonilla received his B.A. from West Virginia University in 1989 and his J.D. from Seton Hall University School of Law in 1992. After graduation, Bonilla clerked for Judge Garrett Brown for the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey.\n\nAfter his clerkship, Bonilla joined the Civil Division of the U.S. Department of Justice as a trial attorney. In 2001, he moved to the Criminal Division, starting in the Asset Forfeiture and Money Laundering Section and moving to the Public Integrity Section. In 2010, Bonilla joined the Deputy Attorney General’s Office.\n\nSince 2018, Bonilla has served as Vice President of Ethics and Investigations at Capital One.\n\nHistory of the Seat\n\nBonilla has been nominated for a seat on the U.S. Court of Federal Claims (CFC), an Article I court that hears monetary claims against the federal government. Judges to the CFC are appointed for 15-year terms, and can be reappointed. The seat Bonilla is nominated for opened up on October 22, 2013, with the retirement of Judge Edward Damich. On May 21, 2014, Bonilla was nominated for this seat by President Obama. Bonilla and four other nominees to the Court were approved by the Senate Judiciary Committee unanimously. However, the nominations were blocked by Sen. Tom Cotton (R-AR), who argued that the CFC did not need any more judges. Despite rebuttals from federal claims attorneys and Chief Judge Patricia Campbell-Smith, Cotton maintained his blockade, and the Obama Administration was unable to fill any vacancies on the Court, leaving six of the sixteen judgeships vacant.\n\nOn June 24, 2019, the Trump Administration nominated Daniel Zachary Epstein, a Special Assistant to the President, to fill this seat. However, Epstein’s nomination stalled in the Senate and he was never confirmed.\n\nBonilla was subsequently renominated to fill this vacancy on July 13, 2021.\n\nLegal Experience\n\nBonilla has spent virtually his entire legal career working in the Department of Justice, where he worked on civil, criminal, and appellate litigation.\n\nNotably, on the civil side, Bonilla represented the United States in defending against a lawsuit by the architects hired to design the Museum of the American Indian, alleging that the contract was wrongfully terminated. See GBQC Architects v. United States, No. 98-399C (Fed. Cl.) (Judge Miller). Bonilla also defended the Department of Veterans Affairs decision not to permit the display of a large Confederate flag at a national cemetery against a First Amendment challenge. See Griffin v. Secretary of Veterans’ Affairs, 288 F.3d 1309 (Fed. Cir.).\n\nAmong the criminal cases he handled, Bonilla prosecuted Katherine Stump, a New Orleans Sewarage and Water board member for conspiracy and wire fraud for accepting cash and gifts in exchange for promoting the interests of a Houston sewage company. See Pam Easton, New Orleans Water Board Chair, Contractor Sentenced to Prison for Wire Fraud, Conspiracy, A.P. State & Local Wire, Sept. 29, 2003.\n\nOverall Assessment\n\nThe fact that Bonilla’s last appointment to the Court of Federal Claims stalled speaks more to the Senate’s intransigence on judicial nominees late in the Obama Administration than it does to Bonilla. With a Senate majority more willing to consider CFC nominees, Bonilla should be confirmed before the end of the year.\n\nCarolyn Lerner, who currently serves as Chief Mediator for the Washington D.C. federal court system, has built up a significant portfolio of government service and litigation experience, including six years as the top whistleblower advocate in the nation. She has now been nominated for a seat on the U.S. Court of Federal Claims.\n\nBackground\n\nBorn on January 13, 1965 in Detroit, Carolyn N. Lerner graduated from the University of Michigan in 1986 with a Bachelor of General Studies, and earned her J.D. from the New York University School of Law in 1989. Upon graduating from law school, she clerked for Judge Julian Cook of the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan before joining Kator, Scott, Heller & Huron as a litigation attorney. In 1996, Lerner helped found the civil rights firm Heller, Huron, Chertkof, Lerner, Simon & Salzman. In 2011, Lerner was confirmed to head the Office of Special Counsel, where served until 2017. Since 2017, Lerner has been the Chief Mediator for the U.S. Courts of the D.C. Circuit.\n\nHistory of the seat\n\nLerner has been nominated for a seat on the U.S. Court of Federal Claims (CFC), an Article I court that hears monetary claims against the federal government. Judges to the CFC are appointed for 15-year terms, and can be reappointed. The seat Lerner was nominated for opened up when Judge Margaret Sweeney’s term expired on October 24, 2020. The Trump Administration nominated Stephen Kubiatowski to fill this vacancy, but his nomination was not confirmed before the end of the Administration.\n\nLegal Career\n\nFor the first twenty years of her legal career, Lerner primarily practiced employment and whistleblower protection law. For example, she represented Larry Bryant, a civilian employee in the Department of the Army who was blocked from publishing letters supportive of allowing homosexuals to serve openly in the military. See Bryant v. Secretary of the Army, 862 F. Supp. 574 (D.D.C. 1994). She also represented Melodi Navab-Safavi, a contractor who was terminated after participating in a music video protesting the Iraq War. Navab-Safavi v. Broad. Bd., 650 F. Supp. 2d 40 (D.D.C. 2009) (affirmed by 637 F.3d 311 (D.C. Cir. 2011)).\n\nFrom 2011 to 2017, Lerner headed the United States Office of Special Counsel after being unanimously confirmed by the Senate for the role. Among other roles, Lerner served as the primary advocate for government whistleblowers, working to ensure that they were safe from retaliation and investigating allegations of misconduct.\n\nLerner’s tenure as Special Counsel was met with widespread support for her aggressive advocacy on behalf of whistleblowers. See, e.g., Press Release, Office of Rep. Rod Blum, Blum Leads Effort to Retain Special Counsel Lerner (Feb. 10, 2017). See also Press Release, Washington Accountability Project Organization, Trump Withdraws Reappointment Nomination of Popular Whistleblower Advocate (Mar. 24, 2017). For example, in 2012, Lerner issued a directive finding that the FDA broke the law in monitoring the personal emails of whistleblowers, and urging agencies to review their electronic surveillance practices. See Johnathan Rickman, Lawyers for FDA Whistleblowers Tie Surveillance Guidance to Email Flap, Washington Drug Letter, June 25, 2012.\n\nOne of Lerner’s most prominent investigations involved alleged abuses of overtime at the Department of Homeland Security. See Jennifer Scholtes, DHS Announces Suspension of Overtime Privileges Ahead of Hearing, Congressional Quarterly Homeland Security, Jan. 28, 2014. Lerner also investigated allegations that the remains of war dead were mishandled at Dover Air Force Base. See Mackenzie Weinger, Probe: War Dead Mishandled at Dover, Politico, Nov. 8, 2011.\n\nAs Special Counsel, Lerner was also charged with enforcing the Hatch Act, which bars political activity by federal employees while on duty. In that role, Lerner ruled, in response to complaints, that the White House Office of Political Strategy and Outreach did not appear to have violated the Hatch Act. See Lauren French, W.H. Cleared of Hatch Act Violations, Politico, July 24, 2014. In contrast, Lerner found that HUD Secretary Julian Castro violated the Hatch Act by promoting Hillary Clinton’s candidacy during a TV interview. Joan Lowy, Gov’t Watchdog: HUD Secretary Violates Hatch Act, A.P. State & Local, July 18, 2016.\n\nSpeeches and Writings\n\nThroughout her career, Lerner has commented on developments in the law. For example, in the 1990s, she encouraged companies to develop usage guidelines for company emails, noting that such emails were frequently relevant to employment litigation. See Loretta Prencipe, E-mail: The Litigation Time Bomb; Your E-Mail Can Become Evidence, So Craft a Usage Policy That You Can Stand Behind, Network World, Apr. 8, 1997.\n\nAs Special Counsel, Lerner also spoke out in favor of reform of the Hatch Act, arguing that the law is difficult to interpret and apply to modern technologies. See Josh Gerstein, Hatch Act Enforcer Seeks Reforms, Politico, Oct. 6, 2011. In a New York Times op-ed, Lerner urged Congress to rewrite the law to allow candidates tied to negligence amounts of federal funds to run for state and local office. See Carolyn Lerner, A Law Misused for Political Ends, N.Y. Times, Oct. 31, 2011. She also urged Congress to allow more flexibilities in penalties offered under the Act, noting that the standard of termination often leads to agencies refusing to report violations in an effort to avoid the harsh penalty. See Gerstein.\n\nOverall Assessment\n\nThe last time Lerner came before the Senate, she received bipartisan support on her way to a smooth confirmation. Given the widespread accolades she has received for her service in the Office of the Special Counsel and extensive experience with the law, it is likely that she will be confirmed the Court of Federal Claims with similar bipartisan support.\n\nThe U.S. Court of Federal Claims (CFC) is currently severely hampered by vacancies. The CFC is intended to have sixteen judgeships but is down six vacancies with two more scheduled to open in the coming months. There are multiple reasons behind the high number of vacancies, primary among which are the obstruction of nominees under President Obama. Furthermore, the Trump Administration has been slow to nominate judges to the CFC, and the Senate has moved comparatively slowly on their nominations. With less than three months left in his current term, the President has caught up, putting forward a nominee for the final vacancy: Stephen Kubiatowski.\n\nBackground\n\nStephen Andrew Kubiatowski received his B.A. from Dartmouth College in 1988 and his J.D. from Columbia University School of Law in 1991.[1] After graduation, Kubiatowski clerked for Judge Michael Kanne for the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit.[2]\n\nAfter his clerkship, Kubiatowski joined Mayer Brown as an Associate. In 1995, he joined the Independent Counsel’s office for the Whitewater Investigation.[3] Two years later, he became a federal prosecutor with the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Central District of Illinois. In 2001, he moved to the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Northern District of Illinois.[4]\n\nIn 2015, Kubiatowski became a Partner with Faegre Baker Daniels LLP. He left a year later to be SVP and Deputy General Counsel with Kindred Healthcare, where he currently works.\n\nHistory of the Seat\n\nKubiatowski has been nominated for a seat on the U.S. Court of Federal Claims (CFC), an Article I court that hears monetary claims against the federal government. Judges to the CFC are appointed for 15-year terms, and can be reappointed. The seat Kubiatowski was nominated for will open up when Judge Margaret Sweeney’s term expires on October 24, 2020.\n\nLegal Experience\n\nWhile Kubiatowski started his career in private practice, he has spent the bulk of his career working for the federal government, primarily as a prosecutor. For example, in that role, Kubiatowski worked as part of a task force targeting health care scams.[5]\n\nIn other prosecutions, Kubiatowski prosecuted Richard Collins for defrauding investors of nearly $11 million, a prosecution in which Judge Suzanne Conlon rejected Kubiatowski’s request for a seven year sentence, instead imposing a ten year prison term.[6] Kubiatowski also prosecuted an Oak Brook couple for making furnishing out of illegally imported animal products,[7] and Tomasz Soltys for assaulting a passenger and flight staff for refusing to let him leave an in-flight aircraft to smoke.[8]\n\nKubiatowski has also been the defendant in a long-running lawsuit filed by Julio Villars, who was detained as a material witness in a drug trial based on Kubiatowski’s affidavit.[9] After numerous defective complaints, Judge Robert Dow permitted two counts against Kubiatowski to proceed for failure to comply with requirements for biweekly reports to the court during detention.[10] The suit ended in 2019 with a grant of summary judgment in Kubiatowski’s favor.[11]\n\nOverall Assessment\n\nGiven Kubiatowski’s long experience with litigation in government, he is likely to be deemed qualified for an appointment to the Court of Federal Claims. If any issues arise, they may be related to his work in the Whitewater investigation or with the suit brought against him, but such issues will be unlikely to derail his confirmation (assuming that the Senate can find the floor time).\n\n[1] Linkedin, Profile of Stephen Kubiatowski, https://www.linkedin.com/in/stephen-kubiatowski-b5b06467/ (last visited Sept. 13, 2020).\n\n[2] Id.\n\n[3] Id.\n\n[4] See id.\n\n[5] Tony Cappasso, Task Force Targets Health Care Scams, Copley News Service, Dec. 28, 1997.\n\n[6] See Shamus Toomey, 10-Year Prison Term for Fraud: Judge Shows No Mercy For Owner of Scheme, Chicago Daily Herald, July 15, 2003.\n\n[7] Rob Olmstead, Decor Made from Wildlife Leads to Arrest, Chicago Daily Herald, Jan. 11, 2006.\n\n[8] Rob Olmstead, Mid-Flight Nicotine Craving Leads to Assault Charge, Chicago Daily Herald, Aug. 29, 2006.\n\n[9] See Villars v.

Mar. 12, 2019).\n\nThe U.S. Court of Federal Claims (CFC) is currently severely hampered by vacancies. The CFC is intended to have sixteen judgeships but is down six vacancies with two more scheduled to open in the coming months. There are multiple reasons behind the high number of vacancies, primary among which are the obstruction of nominees under President Obama. Furthermore, the Trump Administration has been slow to nominate judges to the CFC, and the Senate has moved comparatively slowly on their nominations. The nomination of Zachary Somers, who is a Senate staffer, may move faster, however.\n\nBackground\n\nZachary Noah Somers received a B.A. cum laude from Georgetown University and received a J.D. from Georgetown University Law Center in 2004. After graduating, Somers clerked for Judge Victor Wolski on the U.S. Court of Federal Claims.\n\nAfter his clerkship, Somers joined the Washington D.C. Office of Marzulla Law, LLC, where he worked on takings and breach of contract claims. He then became Counsel at the House Committee on the Judiciary, where he served for a decade.\n\nChairman Lindsey Graham has hired Somers to be his Chief Investigative Counsel for the Senate Judiciary Committee, where Somers currently works.\n\nHistory of the Seat\n\nSomers has been nominated for a seat on the U.S. Court of Federal Claims (CFC), an Article I court that hears monetary claims against the federal government. Judges are appointed for 15-year terms. The seat Somers was nominated will open on October 23, 2020, with Judge Thomas Wheeler’s term coming to an end.\n\nLegal Experience\n\nSomers started his legal career clerking and then worked in litigation at Marzulla Law, LLC., a boutique law firm. For example, while at the firm, Somers helped litigate a lawsuit involving a challenge to the federal government’s grant of federal trust to 6.9 acres of Indian land.[1]\n\nFor the last decade, Somers has been working on Capitol Hill, working as a Counsel for the House Committee for the Judiciary, and then for the Senate Committee on the Judiciary. In the latter role, Somers led the Committee’s investigations of the Roger Stone arrest,[2] and of Secretary of State Hillary Clinton’s use of private email servers.[3]\n\nWritings\n\nIn 2003 and 2004, Somers served as Editor in Chief for the Georgetown Journal of Law and Public Policy. As Editor in Chief, Somers authored a preface to the Winter 2004 edition arguing that the journal should maintain itself as a forum for conservative thought and writings.[4]\n\nIn another article in the same issue, Somers criticized the Supreme Court’s decision in Everson v. Bd. of Educ. that erected a wall of separation between church and state, arguing that such an interpretation violated the original understanding of the First Amendment.[5] Instead, Somers argued for a return to the original understanding of the First Amendment, which limited the Establishment Clause to the federal government, and permitted state governments to involve themselves more closely in religious activities.[6]\n\nOverall Assessment\n\nGenerally, senate staffers who are nominated for the bench are given a certain amount of deference, as they have worked closely with colleagues who need to approve their confirmation. Somers should benefit from such deference. While Somers is sure to attract opposition for his role in Senate investigations and for his writings, he will nonetheless likely be expedited through the process and be confirmed by the end of the year.\n\n[1] Pres. of Los Olivos v.

The CFC is intended to have sixteen judgeships but is down six vacancies with two more scheduled to open in the coming months. There are multiple reasons behind the high number of vacancies, primary among which are the obstruction of nominees under President Obama.

The latest nominee is New Jersey lawyer Thompson Dietz.\n\nBackground\n\nThe 40-year-old Thompson Michael Dietz graduated from Clemson University in 2001 and received a J.D. from Tulane University Law School in 2005.[1]\n\nAfter graduating law school, Dietz worked as a Senior Contracts Representative at the aerospace and defense company General Dynamics.[2] In 2011, Dietz joined CohnReznick LLP as Associate Counsel, where he has worked ever since.\n\nHistory of the Seat\n\nDietz has been nominated for a seat on the U.S. Court of Federal Claims (CFC), an Article I court that hears monetary claims against the federal government. Judges to the CFC are appointed for 15-year terms, and can be reappointed. The seat Dietz was nominated for opened up on July 13, 2018, with the retirement of Judge Victor Wolski.\n\nLegal Experience\n\nDietz’s specialty is government contracts law. He started his career at the defense contracting company General Dynamics, where he worked on negotiating and managing government contracts.[3]\n\nSince 2011, Dietz has worked at CohnReznick LLP, an accounting, tax, and advisory firm, serving as lead counsel in the firm’s government and public sector group.[4] Dietz also worked on data privacy issues with the law.[5] Dietz’s career at the firm seems to have focused on regulatory and compliance issues, rather than litigation.\n\nOverall Assessment\n\nDietz does not have a paper trail of controversial issues, and his government contracts practice is well within the wheelhouse of the Court of Federal Claims. While he may face questions for having a career focusing on regulatory compliance rather than litigation, Dietz should be able to avoid major issues in confirmation.\n\n[1] Charles Toutant, Trump Nominates New Jersey In-House Lawyer at CohnReznick to Federal Claims Court, Law.com, June 15, 2020, https://www.law.com/njlawjournal/2020/06/15/trump-nominates-new-jersey-in-house-lawyer-at-cohnreznick-to-federal-claims-court/.\n\n[2] Id.\n\n[3] See id.\n\n[4] See id.\n\n[5] Id.\n\nThe U.S. Court of Federal Claims (CFC) is seeing rapid turnover currently, largely the result of stalled nominations during the Obama Administration and unforced errors by the Trump Administration. However, Grace Obermann, who is an administrative judge, should sail onto the CFC bench.\n\nBackground\n\nObermann was born Grace Stewart Karaffa in Rahway, NJ in 1961. She received a B.A. from Rutgers University in 1984, and her J.D. from the George Washington University Law School in 1989.[1] After graduation, Obermann joined Fish & Neave’s New York City Office.[2]\n\nIn 1990, Obermann completed a clerkship for Judge Raymond Clevenger on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit and then joined the Department of Justice Commercial Litigation Branch, rising to become Assistant Director of the Intellectual Property Section.[3] In 2012, she moved to the McLean, VA office of Davidson Berquist Jackson & Gowdey LLP, where she was of counsel.[4]\n\nIn 2012, Obermann returned to D.C. to be an administrative patent judge with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office.[5] She currently holds that position.\n\nHistory of the Seat\n\nObermann has been nominated for a seat on the U.S. Court of Federal Claims (CFC), an Article I court that hears monetary claims against the federal government. Judges to the CFC are appointed for 15-year terms, and can be reappointed. The seat Obermann was nominated for opened up on July 13, 2018, with the move to senior status of Judge Susan Braden.\n\nIn June 2019, Obermann’s name was forwarded by a former high school classmate to be considered for appointment to the CFC. Obermann interviewed with the White House in early July, and was nominated on October 3, 2019.[6]\n\nLegal Experience\n\nObermann’s career has largely focused on intellectual property law, approaching this from both the federal government and private practice sides. In her career, Obermann has tried approximately 20 cases. Among her more prominent cases, Obermann defended a patent infringement case filed by Exxon alleging that the United States had infringed its patents for synthesizing alternative fuels.[7] After a grant of summary judgment in their favor and an appeal, Obermann’s client, the United States, ultimately settled the case for $2583, significantly less than the $400,000,000 value in open court.[8]\n\nJudicial Experience\n\nSince 2012, Obermann has served as an Administrative Patent Judge with the U.S. Patent & Trademark Office (PTO). In this role, Obermann conducts administrative patent trials and resolves disputes and challenges. Since 2017, Obermann has also sat on the Patent Trial and Appeal Board, which serves as an appellate review court for trial decisions. In her tenure, Obermann has overseen over 300 trial proceedings.[9]\n\nOverall Assessment\n\nObermann’s extensive experience with administrative law and particularly with issues of intellectual property should serve her well on this highly specialized court. Unlike some other CFC nominees, Obermann likely will have few issues regarding experience and will be confirmed with bipartisan support.\n\n[1] Sen.

One of the factors exacerbating the situation is the Trump Administration’s slow pace in nominations and their predilection for naming young attorneys with little background in the court’s specialized docket. The nomination of Eleni Roumel follows that pattern.\n\nBackground\n\nEleni Maria Roumel was born in Washington D.C. in 1974. She received a B.A. from Wake Forest University in 1996, and a joint J.D. and M.B.A. from Tulane in 2000.[1] After graduation, Roumel joined Skadden Arps’ New York City Office.[2]\n\nAfter two years at Skadden, Roumel completed a two-year clerkship for Judge William Pauley on the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, and then joined the New York office of Wilmer Hale. In 2006, she moved to the Charleston, SC office of Nelson Mullins Riley & Scarborough LLP, where she was a Partner.[3]\n\nIn 2012, Roumel returned to D.C. to be Assistant General Counsel to the U.S. House of Representatives, then under Republican control.[4] In 2018, she left to join Vice President Mike Pence’s Office as Deputy Counsel.[5]\n\nHistory of the Seat\n\nRoumel has been nominated for a seat on the U.S. Court of Federal Claims (CFC), an Article I court that hears monetary claims against the federal government. Judges to the CFC are appointed for 15-year terms, and can be reappointed. The seat Roumel was nominated for opened up on July 14, 2018, with the conclusion of the term of Judge Mary Ellen Coster Williams.\n\nIn November 2018, Roumel interviewed with the White House regarding a vacancy on the CFC. She was preliminarily selected as a nominee in January 2019 and nominated on June 24, 2019.[6]\n\nLegal Experience\n\nFor the past year, Roumel has served as Deputy Counsel to Pence, providing legal advice to his office. However, she has prior experience working for the U.S. House of Representatives and in private practice.\n\nU.S. House of Representatives\n\nFrom 2012 to 2018, Roumel was Assistant General Counsel in the U.S. House of Representatives. In this role, Roumel was notably involved in the House’s lawsuit to prevent the Obama Administration from making payments to insurance companies under the Affordable Care Act.[7] The case eventually ended in a settlement after a ruling in favor of the House’s position.[8] She also represented Rep. Eric Cantor in seeking to block subpoenas in a terrorism financing case involving the Bank of China and the Israeli government.[9]\n\nPrivate Practice\n\nFrom 2004 to 2012, Roumel worked in private practice in New York City and Charleston, primarily working in intellectual property and commercial litigation. For example, Roumel represented a candle manufacturer in a breach of contract action against grocery store chains Supervalu and New Albertson’s Inc.[10] However, she also handled some pro bono cases during this time. For example, she represented a state prisoner who had been seriously injured in a beating by a prison guard.[11]\n\nOverall Assessment\n\nIn reviewing another CFC nominee, Richard Hertling, we said the following:\n\n“Ultimately, the more interesting fact about Roumel is the fact that he was nominated for the CFC rather than the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia. Given his intense legislative experience, the latter would seem like a better perch for such a legislative expert.”\n\nThe same analysis applies to Roumel, whose expertise does not, at immediate glance, suggest appointment to a court primarily known for handling government contract issues and vaccine injury claims. Nonetheless, her experience and lawyerly ability is reflected through the high level positions she has enjoyed, and, while she is unlikely to attract much Democratic support, she will likely be confirmed in due course.\n\n[1] Sen.

The CFC is intended to have sixteen judgeships but is down to just five that are filled. There are multiple reasons behind the high number of vacancies, including the obstruction of five qualified nominees under President Obama. Furthermore, the Trump Administration has been slow to nominate judges to the CFC. Additionally, three of the nominees the Administration has put forward have withdrawn before confirmation. In comparison, Matthew Solomson, the latest nominee, looks to have a brighter future.\n\nBackground\n\nMatthew Hillel Solomson was born in Hartford, Connecticut in 1974. Solomson graduated cum laude from Brandeis University in 1995 and received a joint JD/MBA from the University of Maryland Law School/School of Business in 2002.[1]\n\nAfter graduating law school, Solomson clerked on the CFC for Judge Francis Allegra, and then joined the D.C. office of Arnold & Porter as a Government Contracts Associate, where he stayed until 2007 (barring a year at Skadden Arps doing patent work). In 2007, Solomson joined the Commercial Litigation Branch of the Department of Justice.[2]\n\nIn 2011, Solomson joined Sidley Austin as Counsel and a year later moved to Booz Allen Hamilton as Associate General Counsel. Since 2015, Solomson has served as Chief Legal Officer of Federal Governmental Solutions at Anthem, Inc., a health insurance company.[3]\n\nHistory of the Seat\n\nSolomson has been nominated for a seat on the U.S. Court of Federal Claims (CFC), an Article I court that hears monetary claims against the federal government. Judges to the CFC are appointed for 15-year terms, and can be reappointed. The seat Solomson was nominated for opened up on October 21, 2013, with the retirement of Judge Emily Hewitt. On May 21, 2014, President Obama nominated Patricia McCarthy, a lawyer with the U.S. Department of Justice, to fill the vacancy.[4] While McCarthy and four other nominees to the CFC were approved by the Senate Judiciary Committee unanimously on February 26, 2015, the nominations were blocked by Sen. Tom Cotton (R-AR), who argued that the CFC did not need any more judges.[5] Despite rebuttals from federal claims attorneys and Chief Judge Patricia Campbell-Smith, Cotton maintained his blockade, and the Obama Administration was unable to fill any more vacancies on the Court, leaving six of the sixteen judgeships vacant by the end of the 114th Congress.[6]\n\nIn late 2016, Solomson submitted his resume to the Presidential Transition team, expressing his interest in an appointment to the CFC.[7] Solomson interviewed with the White House in April 2017, and was selected for further vetting in April 2018.[8] Solomson was officially nominated on March 5, 2019.\n\nLegal Experience\n\nSolomson’s specialty is government contracts law. Throughout his career, Solomson has focused on procurements, regulatory compliance, and other areas involved in government contracts at Sidley Austin, Booz Allen, and Anthem. Over his career, Solomson has tried four cases, including two as counsel of record.[9]\n\nAmong his more prominent cases, Solomson successfully argued before the Federal Circuit that a federal employee’s due process rights were violated when he was removed without having an opportunity to challenge ex parte communications against him.[10]\n\nPolitical Activity\n\nSolomson has a limited political history, having donated $1000 to then candidate Mitt Romney in 2012.[11]\n\nOverall Assessment\n\nGiven Solomson’s focus on government contracts law, and his lack of a paper trail on controversial issues, he is unlikely to draw the same degree of controversy as other CFC nominees. However, given the general lack of emphasis on CFC nominations under the Administration and the Senate, I wouldn’t expect a quick confirmation for Solomson.\n\n[1] Sen.
