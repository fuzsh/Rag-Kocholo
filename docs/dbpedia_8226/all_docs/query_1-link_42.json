        "text": "There’s just no other place that does it like Syracuse.\n\n—Former US Secretary of Defense Ashton Carter\n\nSyracuse University Institute for Security Policy and Law (SPL) is a multidisciplinary, university-based center for the study of national and international security. The Institute offers certificates of advanced study, conducts incisive research on security topics, and provides timely policy analysis.\n\nHeadquartered in the Syracuse University College of Law, SPL is a collaboration among the College of Law, the Maxwell School of Citizenship and Public Affairs, and other SU colleges and departments. SPL’s initiatives and projects have shaped security dialogues on law and policy since 2003.\n\nSPL’s extensive national security capabilities were founded—in 2003, as the Institute for National Security and Counterterrorism—on the expertise of Professor Emeritus William C. Banks. Banks helped set the scholarly parameters of the national security field by co-authoring two leading textbooks—National Security Law (Aspen, 6th ed.) and Counterterrorism Law (Aspen, 3rd ed.)—and by initiating the New Battlefields/Old Laws (NBOL) project examining international humanitarian law (IHL) in the 21st century.\n\nSince 2018, SPL has been led by the Hon. James E. Baker, one of the most highly regarded national security lawyers and policy advisors in the nation. Before joining the College of Law, Baker served on the US Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces for 15 years, the last four as Chief Judge. Continuing his public service, Baker was appointed to the Public Interest Declassification Board by President Barack Obama, and he is a Member of the ABA Rule of Law Initiative Board of Directors.\n\nSPL continues to advance its mission to be an internationally recognized center for interdisciplinary teaching, for multi-method research into complex security problems, and for public service to practitioners grappling with seemingly intractable national, international, and human security issues. Agile and responsive, SPL’s educational and research programs continue to track the changing nature of these issues, as battlefields become virtual, wars become asymmetric, homeland security remains critical, human rights crises become commonplace, and the rule of law becomes indispensable.\n\nSPL’s interdisciplinary law and graduate academic programs give law and policy students the best possible theoretical and practical training as they prepare themselves for careers in national and international security and counterterrorism. SPL’s research portfolio engages these cross-domain topics in six key areas: national security and counterterrorism law and policy; cybersecurity and cyberespionage; Middle East security and Islamic rule of law; security governance and postconflict reconstruction; homeland security; and defense strategy and veterans affairs.\n\nIn addition to books, monographs, and white papers, SPL experts organize and contribute to international conferences and workshops (such as New Battlefields/Old Laws; Law and Security: Perspectives from the Field and Beyond; and Controlling Economic Cyber Espionage); host public lectures (such as the Becker Middle East Security and the Everett Postconflict Reconstruction speaker series); and, in collaboration with Georgetown Law, produce the Journal of National Security Law and Policy, the only peer-reviewed journal of its kind.\n\nThe Institute has forged several national and international partnerships in its spheres of research, most notably with the American Bar Association Standing Committee on Law and National Security; Institute for Counter-Terrorism (Herzliya, Israel); International Committee of the Red Cross; International Institute of Higher Studies in Criminal Sciences (Siracusa, Italy); King Faisal Center for Research and Islamic Studies (Saudi Arabia); NATO Cooperative Cyber Defence Centre of Excellence (Tallinn, Estonia); Brookings’ Saban Center for Middle East Policy; United States Institute of Peace; US Army Peacekeeping and Stability Operations Institute; and the Warrior-Scholar Project.\n\nAmong Syracuse University’s colleges and departments, the Institute collaborates with the College of Engineering and Computer Science; Department of Economics; Department of Public Administration and International Affairs; Institute for Veterans and Military Families; Moynihan Institute of Global Affairs; Newhouse School of Public Communications; Program for the Advancement of Research on Conflict and Collaboration; The School of Information Studies (iSchool); and Whitman School of Management.\n\nKey Capabilities\n\nPublic Service & Policy Analysis\n\nSPL projects and initiatives have helped shape the national and global dialog concerning security and terrorism law and policy.\n\nWhat is the next security challenge? National security and counterterrorism experts at SPL continue to engage the issues to identify where policy makers and practitioners can best place their resources.\n\nThanks to strategic growth and interdisciplinary understanding of the field, SPL remains on the leading edge of national security and counterterrorism research and policy analysis.\n\nOur interdisciplinary approach leverages expertise in law, foreign policy, military planning, political science, public affairs, peace studies, public management, diplomacy, anthropology, history, law, communications, economics, engineering, cybersecurity and emerging technologies, and more.\n\nOur scholars and practitioners take into account the changing patterns of global conflict and structural changes in world order to provide the most appropriate legal and policy advice to solve complex challenges.\n\nOur evolving mission follows the contours of the changing threat landscape—from virtual terrorism, fourth-generation warfare, and asymmetric conflict to homeland security, climate security, critical infrastructure, and cybersecurity.\n\nSPL studies the balance between robust and soft power responses to security and terrorism threats and strongly emphasize the role of peacekeeping, conflict resolution, and rule-of-law-based postconflict reconstruction.\n\nInterdisciplinary Research\n\nOur interdisciplinary research projects and areas of interest contribute to a comprehensive national and international security and counterterrorism research portfolio.\n\nResearch includes ground-breaking explorations into “New Battlefields, Old Laws,” Middle East Security, and Cybersecurity.\n\nSPL is a collaboration among these SU colleges and schools: College of Law; Maxwell School of Citizenship and Public Affairs; LC Smith College of Engineering and Computer Science; and the SI Newhouse School of Public Communications.\n\nResearch and program collaborations beyond SU include those with the American Bar Association; Combating Terrorism Center at West Point; Georgetown Law; Interdisciplinary Center in Herzliya, Israel; International Committee of the Red Cross; UN Peacebuilding Support Office; US Army Peacekeeping & Stability Operations Institute; and US Institute for Peace.\n\nSPL Research and Practice Associates provide additional academic and practical subject matter expertise.\n\nA joint project of Georgetown Law and SPL, the Journal of National Security Law and Policy is the only peer-reviewed journal of its kind. Its topics include FISA, cybersecurity, laws of war, humanitarian law, shadow wars, and more.\n\nAmong SPL’s many conferences, seminars, and panel discussions are the Carol Becker Middle East Security Speaker Series and the David F. Everett Lecture Series in Postconflict Reconstruction.\n\nLaw & Graduate Education\n\nSPL offers a challenging combination of national security and counterterrorism law and security studies, and the Institute’s law and graduate programs are a calibrated mix of academic research and real-world practice.\n\nLaw and graduate students can choose from SPL’s certificates of advanced study in National Security and Counterterrorism Law, Security Studies, and/or Postconflict Reconstruction.\n\nSPL’s varied academic offerings also include the Program on Security in the Middle East (which provides cross-cultural engagement with scholars, experts, and practitioners through graduate study abroad fellowships, the Carol Becker Speaker Series, and other opportunities) and a range of workshops, seminars, symposia, and guests that deepens the security and counterterrorism conversation.\n\nStudents are considered for capstone projects, graduate and research assistantships, internships, and research fellowships.\n\nStudents can extend their interest in this topic area through the SPL-sponsored Student Association on Terrorism and Security Analysis (which produces an annual conference and the Journal on Terrorism and Security Analysis).\n\nA rich curriculum across a spectrum of sub-disciplines positions SPL students for public and private sector jobs and careers in national security, homeland security, counterterrorism, cybersecurity, and postconflict reconstruction.\n\nSPL is led by distinguished subject matter experts—the Hon. James E. Baker, an internationally recognized authority in national security, the intelligence community, and emerging technologies and the law, and VADM Robert B. Murrett (Ret.), former Director of the US National Geospatial Intelligence Agency.\n\nOther faculty members are drawn from political science, public and international affairs, public management, sociology, anthropology, history, law, communications, economics, and elsewhere.\n\nAlumni are employed at the American Red Cross; Atlantic Council; Booz Allen Hamilton; Brookings Institution; Deloitte; departments of Defense, Homeland Security, Justice, and State; Foreign Service Institute; Judge Advocate General’s Corps; National Security Agency; US Institute of Peace; World Bank; World Vision; and elsewhere.\n\nFormer students stay in touch via active social media channels and alumni network gatherings.\n\nHistory\n\nClick on the dates below to read about the Institute’s progress year-by-year:"
