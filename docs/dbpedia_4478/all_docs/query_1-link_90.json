        "text": "Even as a history enthusiast and a Navy veteran, I didn’t learn about the Black U.S. Army Buffalo Soldiers until I read General Colin Powell’s autobiography My American Journey sometime in the late 1990’s. A stop to see where many of them served at Fort Davis TX (part of my West Texas bucket list road trip) helped me fill in some knowledge gaps.\n\nDuring a recent trip to Leavenworth, Kansas for a conference, I definitely wanted to learn more by seeing the Buffalo Soldier Memorial Park on the grounds of Fort Leavenworth, so myself and some friends drove onto the still-active Army base to explore. Anyone can go on this base with photo ID and a visitor pass. My thanks to photographer Stephanie Liskey from Sailforth Productions for taking several of the photos shared in this post.\n\nAs a Black man and a soldier, General Powell naturally took an interest in his military forebears who served out West on the U.S. frontier as cavalry soldiers on horseback plus in four infantry regiments, fighting Plains Indians who admired the soldiers’ bravery and their curly hair, which to them resembled buffalo hide.\n\nMore about the Buffalo Soldier legacy from the Smithsonian’s National Museum of African American History and Culture:\n\n“African Americans could only serve west of the Mississippi River, because many whites didn’t want to see armed black soldiers in or near their communities… Much attention is given to the irony of African-American soldiers fighting native people on behalf of a government that accepted neither group as equals… In addition, African-American soldiers had recently found themselves facing Native Americans during the Civil War, when some tribes fought for the Confederacy.\n\nBuffalo Soldiers played significant roles in many other military actions, [including] the Spanish-American and Philippine-American Wars, and played a key role in maintaining border security during the high-intensity military conflict along the U.S.-Mexico border during the Mexican Revolution.\n\nThe Buffalo Soldiers were also recognized for their exceptional horsemanship. Black non-commissioned officers of the 9th Cavalry began training West Point Cadets in riding skills and tactics from 1907 until 1947. The Buffalo Soldiers served as some of the first national park rangers when the U.S. Army served as the official administrator of Yosemite and Sequoia National Parks between 1891 and 1913. They protected the parks from illegal grazing, poachers, timber thieves and wildfires.”\n\nIn the early 1980’s General Powell was stationed in Leavenworth, Kansas as Deputy Commanding General of the Combined Arms Center at Fort Leavenworth. While out for a run, he noticed two gravel alleyways named in honor of the 9th and 10th Cavalry Regiments of Black cavalry.\n\nThinking that this was not much of a way to honor the Buffalo Soldiers, he set the process in motion to come up with a more fitting memorial.\n\nHow exciting it must have been for him to return to Fort Leavenworth seven years later, as the first Black Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, for the groundbreaking ceremony of the Buffalo Soldier Monument, which would be created by Black sculptor Eddie Dixon and unveiled in 1992.\n\nHere’s a video from that 1992 dedication:\n\nEddie Dixon created the bust of Colin Powell that was added to the park later (see below) and he was also the artist who made the statue of Pearl Harbor Navy hero Doris Miller that I admired so much in a downtown park in Waco, Texas.\n\nWhat a talent!\n\nOnce you’ve looked at the Buffalo Soldier Monument, take awhile to walk around the rest of the small park next to Smith Lake, called the “Circle of Firsts” and “Walkway of Units” that highlight all sorts of unsung Black Army heroes.\n\nAt first, as with other Black units, the Buffalo Soldiers could only be led by White officers.\n\nAs time passed and their positive reputations changed some minds, the first Blacks were admitted to the U.S. Military Academy at West Point.\n\nIn 1877, the first Black officer was commissioned as a 2nd Lieutenant through West Point – Henry Ossian Flipper. There is a bust of him on the Circle of Firsts…\n\nCan you imagine the harassment and hazing that this young Mr. Flipper must have endured? While at Fort Davis, he was accused of embezzling, and while found not guilty, was dishonorably discharged. Flipper spent the rest of his life trying to clear his name (he died in 1940) but finally in 1976 the Army granted him an honorable discharge, and in 1999 President Clinton issued him a full pardon.\n\nYou can see more people who broke through the walls of discrimination over the years.\n\nThere is a bust commemorating the first Black paratroopers, called the “Triple Nickles” because their unit symbol was three Buffalo nickels in a triangle. They were established in 1943 at Fort Benning, Georgia. As a Navy midshipman, I was allowed to go through “Jump School” one summer at Fort Benning. It was quite challenging for me, but I graduated and earned my jump wings, so I’m drawn to paratrooper stories.\n\nThe Triple Nickles were sent to the U.S. Pacific Northwest on a secret mission called “Operation Firefly” – they became smoke jumpers to fight forest fires that were being deliberately set by Japanese balloon bombs.\n\nNo, smoke jumping is not something they teach you at Fort Benning.\n\nDespite being sent on a rather peculiar mission for a military unit in wartime, they were professionals and rose to the challenge. What an irony that their firefighting work protected people and property in Oregon, a state with a long history of not even allowing Blacks to live there.\n\nIf I hadn’t seen the sculpture of the Black man with a parachute, and read the inscription on that memorial while wandering the Buffalo Soldiers park, I don’t know when I would have ever learned about the Triple Nickles.\n\nWe stopped at General Powell’s bust, of course…\n\nColin Powell has a checkered reputation in the U.S., where he is criticized for his speech to the United Nations about “weapons of mass destruction” that were part of the justification for the U.S. invading Iraq. He was a much-admired figure before that, so his words carried weight, but the intelligence he cited didn’t exist and his reputation took a huge hit.\n\nHe denies lying, and I believe him. I think Bush Administration people fed him weak intelligence at best and straight-up BS at worst, because they wanted his stellar character as cover for the decision to invade. As Powell said years later and as was quoted in his obituary in the Washington Post,\n\n“‘It’s the blot on my record.’ If he had known then what he found out after it was too late, he said, ‘I don’t think we would have had the basis to go to war.'”\n\nOne more discovery awaited us in the park – the “Six Triple Eight.”\n\nThis was an all-Black battalion of women who were part of the U.S. WAC (Women’s Army Corps) and were sent to Europe late in World War Two in order to… process and clear a backlog of mail.\n\nWhat?\n\nYes, apparently there was a massive backlog of 17 million pieces of U.S. mail to and from the troops – and other deployed personnel like those with the Red Cross – that was piled up in warehouses in England, and the delays were having a big impact on troop morale.\n\nThe 855 military members of the 6888th Central Postal Directory Battalion (“Six Triple Eight”) of the U.S. Women’s Army Corps got the job done in record time, despite working in unheated, rat-infested conditions in Birmingham, England. They also deployed to Rouen and Paris in France.\n\nOf course, they served in a segregated military, both as Blacks and as women – the WAC wasn’t dissolved and incorporated into the regular Army until 1978, only five years before I was commissioned – AND they returned home to Jim Crow.\n\nIn an exciting development this week, the women of the 6888th were awarded the Congressional Gold Medal for their long-overlooked WWII service. From the AP (Associated Press) story linked in the previous sentence:\n\n“Only a half-dozen of the more than 850 members are still alive. ‘It’s overwhelming,’ Maj. Fannie Griffin McClendon, who is 101 and lives in Arizona, said when told of the vote. ‘It’s something I never even thought about. I don’t know if I can stand this.'”\n\nWhat a thrill to see the AP wire story and realize that thanks to the Buffalo Soldier Memorial Park and Fort Leavenworth, I knew what they were talking about, and at least a few of those veterans are still alive to receive the honor.\n\nSomeone has to go first. Black troops were finally allowed to serve in the Union Army, then the Buffalo Soldiers proved their worth, Blacks were admitted to West Point, then came other special units like the Tuskegee Airmen, the Triple Nickles, and the 6888th.\n\nBe the future you want to see.\n\nAll photos by the author, except as noted.\n\nIf you like this post, please consider subscribing to the blog via RSS feed or by email – the email signup box is toward the top of the right sidebar.
