        "text": "Next to the names are either a diamond or a cross. A diamond means the person was confirmed to have been killed; a cross means the person is missing in action. If an MIA soldier were to show up today, a circle would be engraved around the cross. If his remains are found, a diamond is superimposed over the cross. You will also find round dots spaced evenly along the vertical edges of some panels. These simply mark every ten lines, allowing visitors to find a particular name more easily. Catalogs listing all names on the memorial are located near the entrance. A panel number (found at the bottom corner of each panel) and a row number are given in the catalog.\n\nConstruction on the Vietnam Veterans Memorial began in March 1982, and it was officially dedicated on November 13, 1982. The Three Soldiers sculpture was not installed until the fall of 1984. In 2010, a memorial plaque with the names of men who died after the war due to injuries sustained in battle was installed near the Three Soldiers. These men did not qualify to be listed on the Memorial Wall.\n\nIn 1993, a third element was added to the memorial: the Vietnam Women’s Memorial dedicated to the women who served in Vietnam, most being nurses. This is a sculpture of three women and a wounded soldier. The artist is Glenna Goodacre.\n\nDespite the initial public criticism, the Vietnam Veterans Memorial has arguably become the most popular memorial on the Mall. According to visitation statistics—don’t ask me how the National Park Service actually keeps track of visitors to the memorials—only the Lincoln Memorial gets more visitors each year. In fact, in 2015 the Vietnam Veterans Memorial was the 9th most visited unit of the National Park system. This can perhaps be attributed to the names on the wall, for while other memorials honor “those who died,” here you can actually read the names of those who died, so there is a real connection between the memorial and the visitors.\n\nThe Vietnam Veterans Memorial is open year-round, 24 hours a day. Park Rangers are on hand from 9:30 AM to 10 PM to answer questions (except for Christmas day). The National Park Service offers daily programs that rotate throughout the memorials on the Mall. To find out what sort of activities are going on when you visit, see the National Park Service’s Calendar web page for the National Mall and Memorial Parks.\n\nBack to the Top"
