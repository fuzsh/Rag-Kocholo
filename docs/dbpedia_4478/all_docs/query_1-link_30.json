Today, Memorial Park is a 1500-acre urban park that also contains the Houston Arboretum and Nature Center. The park is also home to many recreational amenities, such as a 3-mile long jogging trail, picnic areas, tennis courts, a swimming pool, and soccer, softball, and baseball fields.\n\nAt the eastern edge of the super neighborhood are the Old Sixth Ward and First Ward neighborhoods. These are historic neighborhoods created late in the 19th century, and were the first designated by the City of Houston as a Protected Historic District. Many of the commercial and industrial sites created in the 20th century, are giving way to a vibrant art district today.\n\nSN22 is also home to two historic cemeteries. Olivewood Cemetery ws founded in 1875, and is the first to serve the African-American community in Houston. Glenwoood Cemetery was founded in 1871, and is the resting place for many notable Texans, including the last president of the Republic of Texas.\n\nThere are more than 10 neighborhoods in SN22, founded early in the 20th century as working-class neighborhoods. Today, they are one of the most rapidly changing areas in Houston, and home to many upscale single and multi-family residental properties.\n\nCIVIC CLUBS: (Updated: 1/06/2023)\n\n• Camp Logan Memorial Civic Club email • Cottage Grove Civic Club email web site • Crestwood Civic Club email web site • First Ward Civic Club, Inc. email web site • Magnolia Grove Civic Association email web site • Old Sixth Ward Neighborhood Association email • Rice Military Civic Club email web site • West End Civic Club, Inc email web site • Westwood Grove Civic Club email • Woodcrest Neighborhood Civic Association email web site\n\nPARKS:\n\n• Autry Park 911 Shepherd 77019 • Brock Richard Park 1709 Bingham 77007 • Cottage Grove Park 2100 Arabelle 77007 • Crooker Street Greenspace 1900 Crockett 77007 • Fonde Community Center 110 Sabine 77007 • Jones (Randall P.)
