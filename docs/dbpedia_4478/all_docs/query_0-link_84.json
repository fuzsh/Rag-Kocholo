        "text": "Not to be confused with Rockland, New York.\n\nRockland County is the second-southernmost county on the west side of the Hudson River in the U.S. state of New York, after Richmond County. It is part of the New York metropolitan area. As of the 2020 U.S. census, the county's population is 338,329, making it the state's third-most densely populated county outside New York City after Nassau and neighboring Westchester Counties. The county seat and largest hamlet is New City. Rockland County is accessible via the New York State Thruway, which crosses the Hudson River to Westchester at the Tappan Zee Bridge over the Tappan Zee, ten exits up from the NYC border, as well as the Palisades Parkway five exits up from the George Washington Bridge. The county's name derives from \"rocky land\", as the area has been aptly described, largely due to the Hudson River Palisades. The county is part of the Hudson Valley region of the state.\n\nRockland County is the smallest county by area in New York outside New York City. It comprises five towns, eighteen incorporated villages, eighteen census-designated places, eight hamlets and 11 defunct communities. Rockland County is designated as a Preserve America Community, and nearly a third of the county's area is parkland. The county has the largest Jewish population percentage of any U.S. county, at 31.4%, or 90,000 residents. Rockland also ranked 80th on the list of highest-income counties by median household income in the United States, with a median household income of $82,534 according to the 2010 census.\n\nHistory\n\nOn February 14, 2017 Edwin J. Day, County Executive of Rockland County proclaim February 14, 2017 as Rockland County Local History Day.\n\nThe area that would become Rockland County was originally inhabited by Algonquian-speaking Aboriginals, including Munsees, or Lenni Lenape.\n\nIn 1609, Henry Hudson, thinking he had found the legendary \"Northwest Passage\", sailed on the Half Moon up the river that would one day bear his name and anchored near the area that is now Haverstraw before continuing to disillusionment north of Albany. The Dutch were the first Europeans to settle in the area, around 1675. These settlers, eager to escape \"city life\", moved from Manhattan to Rockland. A number of unique Dutch-style red sandstone houses still stand, and many place names in the county reveal their Dutch origin. When the Duke of York (who became King James II of England) established the first twelve counties of New York in 1683, present-day Rockland County was part of Orange County known then as \"Orange County South of the Mountains\". Orangetown was created at the same time under a royal grant, originally encompassing all of modern Rockland County. Around this time, as the English began to colonize Nyack and Tappan, the Native Americans began to leave Rockland in search of undisturbed land further north.\n\nThe natural barrier of the Ramapo Mountains and the size of the county made it difficult to carry out governmental activities. At one point there were twin governments, one on each side of the Ramapo Mountains. For this reason, Rockland split off from Orange in 1798 to form its own county. That same year the county seat was transferred from Tappan to New City, where a new courthouse was built.\n\nHaverstraw was separated from Orangetown in 1719 and became a town in 1788; it included the present-day Clarkstown, Ramapo and Stony Point. Clarkstown and Ramapo became towns in 1791, followed by Stony Point in 1865.\n\nDuring the American Revolution, when control of the Hudson River was viewed by the British as strategic to dominating the American territories, Rockland saw skirmishes at Haverstraw, Nyack and Piermont, and significant military engagements at the Battle of Stony Point, where General \"Mad\" Anthony Wayne earned his nickname. George Washington had headquarters for a time at John Suffern's tavern, the later site of the village of Suffern. British Major John André met with American traitor Benedict Arnold near Stony Point to buy the plans for the fortifications at West Point. André was captured with the plans in Tarrytown on his way back to the British lines; he was brought to Tappan for trial in the Tappan church, found guilty, hanged and buried nearby. Still another important chapter in the story of the Revolution was written on May 5, 1783, when General Washington received Sir Guy Carleton at the DeWint House, where they discussed the terms of the peace treaty. Two days later Washington visited Sir Guy aboard a British war vessel. On this day the King's Navy fired its first salute to the flag of the United States of America.\n\nIn the decades following the Revolution, Rockland became popular for its stone and bricks. These products, however, required quarrying in land that many later believed should be set aside as a preserve. Many unsuccessful efforts were made to turn much of the Hudson Highlands on the northern tip of the county into a forest preserve. However, Union Pacific Railroad president E. H. Harriman donated land as well as large sums of money for the purchase of properties in the area of Bear Mountain. Bear Mountain/Harriman State Park became a reality in 1910, and by 1914 it was estimated that more than a million people a year were coming to the park.\n\nRockland remained semi-rural until the 1950s when the Palisades Interstate Parkway, Tappan Zee Bridge, and other major arteries were built. The idea of suburbia also helped transform the county. The county's population flourished, from 89,276 in 1950 to 265,475 in 1990.\n\nGeography\n\nAccording to the U.S. Census Bureau, the county has a total area of 199 square miles (520 km2), of which 174 square miles (450 km2) is land and 26 square miles (67 km2) (13%) is water. It is the smallest county in the state outside of New York City.\n\nRockland County lies just north of the New Jersey-New York border, west of Westchester County across the Hudson River, and south of Orange County.\n\nThe county's elevations range from 1,283 feet (391 m) atop Rockhouse Mountain to sea level along the Hudson River. Approximately 30% of Rockland County is devoted to parkland, belonging to either the five towns, incorporated villages, the state, or the county. These parks provide walking and hiking trails, ballfields, dog runs, historic sites, ponds, streams, salt marshes, and equestrian trails. Some popular state parks include Bear Mountain State Park on the northernmost tip of the county, Harriman State Park also along the county's northern boundary, and Nyack Beach State Park along the Hudson River, with trails connecting to Rockland Lake State Park. In addition to parks, Rockland is home to numerous public and private golf courses, with the towns of Orangetown, Ramapo, Stony Point, and Haverstraw all operating public golf courses within their towns, offering discounted rates to their respective residents. The Palisades Interstate Park Commission also operates two golf courses in Rockland Lake State Park with sweeping views of the park. Notable private courses in the county include Dellwood Country Club, Manhattan Woods Golf Course (designed by PGA great Gary Player), Minisceongo Golf Club (Ramapo), and Rockland Country Club (Sparkill).\n\nAdjacent counties\n\nOrange County (northwest)\n\nPutnam County (northeast)\n\nWestchester County (east)\n\nPassaic County, New Jersey (west)\n\nBergen County, New Jersey (south)\n\nRockland's borders with Putnam and Passaic counties are short, totaling less than one mile (1.6 km).\n\nDemographics\n\nHistorical population Census Pop. %± 1800 6,353 — 1810 7,758 22.1% 1820 8,837 13.9% 1830 9,388 6.2% 1840 11,975 27.6% 1850 16,962 41.6% 1860 22,492 32.6% 1870 25,213 12.1% 1880 27,690 9.8% 1890 35,162 27.0% 1900 38,298 8.9% 1910 46,873 22.4% 1920 45,548 −2.8% 1930 59,599 30.8% 1940 74,261 24.6% 1950 89,276 20.2% 1960 136,803 53.2% 1970 229,903 68.1% 1980 259,530 12.9% 1990 265,475 2.3% 2000 286,753 8.0% 2010 311,687 8.7% 2020 338,329 8.5% 2022 (est.) 339,022 8.8% US Decennial Census\n\n1790-1960 1900-1990\n\n1990-2000 2010, 2019\n\n2020 census\n\nAs of the 2020 United States Census., 338,329 people and 100,438 households were residing in the county.

The unit is sized to generate 3 million kilowatt-hours annually – enough power to supply about 200 homes, that provides one-third of the electric needs of the Town of Clarkstown government. The Clarkstown solar field project is at the maximum size that is currently allowed by New York State. The installation was projected to save taxpayers as much as $4 million over 30 years by reducing the amount of the town's annual electric bill – which is about $2 million and produce 10 percent of all the electricity that O&R gets through solar power. The project was installed in summer 2014, coming online in October.\n\nMunicipalities\n\nPaul W.
