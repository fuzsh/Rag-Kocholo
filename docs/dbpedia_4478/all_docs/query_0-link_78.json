        "text": "Complete Guide to the Korean War Memorial in Washington DC. History, what to see and do, how to get to the park, and more.\n\nKorean War Veterans Memorial\n\nThe Korean War Memorial took my breath away when I first saw it. It feels like the soldiers are staring you in the eyes and following your movement.\n\nI have heard that the memorial is absolutely amazing and scary at night. That the figures of the soldiers feel like they are moving when you see them.\n\nAbout Korean War Memorial\n\nThe Korean War Veterans Memorial was dedicated July 27, 1995, to commemorate the sacrifices of the millions of Americans and allied partners who fought during the Korean War.\n\nFrom June 25, 1950, to July 27, 1953, 36,574 Americans died in hostile actions in the Korean War\n\nThe memorial is open 24 hours a day. Located near the Lincoln Memorial and Vietnam Veterans Memorial in Washington DC.\n\nThe Korean War Memorial includes 19 stainless steel statues that were sculpted by Frank Gaylord of Vermont. They were cast in New York before being brought to DC.\n\nThey stand approximately seven feet tall and represent an ethnic mix of America and the soldiers who fought in the Korean War.\n\nThe statues are in a juniper brush field and are separated by granite strips. They represent 14 Army, 3 Marine, 1 Navy, and 1 Air Force member.\n\nThe Juniper Brush field is to represent the rice paddies of Korea that troops would have encountered during the war.\n\nThe Korean War Veterans Memorial also features are Mural Wall designed by Louis Nelson from New York. This wall was created in Minnesota before being moved to DC.\n\nThe memorial wall has 41 panels that extend for 164 feet. The wall includes 2,400 photographs of the Korean War that was in the National Archives.\n\nMake sure and look at the reflections in the Memorial Wall. You will see a total of 38 statues that symbolize the 38th parallel and the 38 months of the Korean War.\n\nHow many statues are at the Korean War Memorial?\n\nThere are 19 statues created by Vermont sculptor Frank Gaylord.\n\nThe statues include 14 soldiers, three Marines, one sailor, and one airman.\n\nWhen was the Korean War Memorial Built?\n\nThe memorial was dedicated on July 27, 1995.\n\nIs Korean War Memorial worth visiting?\n\nYes! This National Memorial offers visitors the chance to reflect on the Korean War and pay tribute to the service men and women who were lost during the war.\n\nHistory of Korean War Memorial\n\nThe Korean War Veterans Memorial remembers and honors the American men and women who died or went missing in action during the Korean War. The memorial also remembers the men and women of the United Nations who fought alongside American and Korean forces.\n\nThe war is often referred to as the \"forgotten war\" despite it claiming over 40,00 American servicemen and women's lives. Beginning in 1950 and ending in 1953, the Korean War was the first proxy war of the Cold War. Formally a Japanese colony, it was left to the Soviet Union and the United States to decide what to do with Korea.\n\nIn 1945 Korea was split along the 38th parallel giving the Soviets control of the north and the US the south.\n\nBy 1950, each side was ruled by a dictatorship. North of the parallel was communist and anti-communists in the south. When the north invaded the south in June 1950, it sparked fears in Washington that the Communists were trying to take over not just Korea but the world.\n\nThe First Year\n\nTensions had been high between the two sides of the Korean peninsula since 1945, with over 10,000 soldiers having lost their lives in border skirmishes before the war broke out.\n\nThe Communist dictator of North Korea, Kim Il-Sung wanted to unify the peninsula and, with Soviet backing, invaded the south in June 1950.\n\nAmidst fears that the Soviets were trying to take over the world, the U.S and UN decided that military intervention was needed. The Soviet-backed North Korean forces initially took the South Korean capital of Seoul. While the U.S and UN forces fought hard to make headway against the organized North Korean forces.\n\nThe U.S and South Korean forces made little progress against the well-equipped and organized North Korean army. North Korea tore through the south, committing heinous acts against civilians. By the end of August 1950, the U.S finally managed to slow the North Korean advance, including pushing them back at Pusan and retaking Seoul.\n\nAllied Push Into North Korea\n\nInitially, the UN and U.S wanted to push the Communists out of South Korea and back over the 38th parallel. This soon changed when the U.S forces, under the leadership of General MacArthur, landed in the North at Inch’on. Their intention became to liberate the North Koreans from their communist oppressors.\n\nThe landing at Inch’on was successful, and the U.S and South Korean forces managed to push the North Koreans back over the border. As the Allies made headway into the northern peninsula, the Chinese entered the conflict. Chairman Mao claimed that he felt the Chinese territory was under threat.\n\nThe Chinese forces entering the war escalated the conflict. The Chinese engaged with the US and South Korea at the Chosin Reservoir and managed to push the U.S back into South Korea.\n\nThe Chinese forces would attack the allies at night and cut off their supply lines. They would then attack and ambushed the retreating U.S forces. This tactic maximized their damage.\n\nThe Stalemate\n\nAmerican President Truman did not want to push the Chinese into a war for fear it would trigger a bigger world war. General MacArthur, however, disagreed with President Truman.\n\nMacArthur thought that listening to Mao Zedong's threat of full-scale war with America was a sign of weakness and continued to push for war with China. Truman removed him as head of the U.S Forces.\n\nPresident Truman, along with the United Nations, concluded that the best way to deescalate the situation in Korea would be to let go of the idea of reunification by force. Peace talks with North Korea and China stalled, and the war reached a stalemate.\n\nThe negotiations for peace did not stop the fighting. The negotiations merely changed how the U.S and UN fought. Rather than trying to claim more territory, they fought to hold onto those South Korean territories that they had.\n\nThe End of Negotiations\n\nPeace negotiations continued for two years while the war continued and casualties on all sides mounted. The main reason the peace talks stalled was the issue of what to do with the prisoners of war.\n\nChina and North Korea believed the POWs should be repatriated by force while the U.S did not.\n\nThe North Koreans treated prisoners of war horribly, and it's feared that many prisoners were either executed or kept as slave laborers. In 1953, after two years of bloody conflict, the peace talks finally concluded. The negotiations ended with the North and South's continued separation at the 38th parallel. This division is still in effect today.\n\nThe Korean War had an exceptionally high civilian death toll, claiming the lives of over 2.5 million civilians. With an estimated 5 million total dead, 40,000 of which were U.S men and women who are remembered forever at the Korean Veterans War Memorial.\n\nThings to know before your visit to Korean War Memorial\n\nEntrance fee\n\n$0.00 - There is no fee to visit the memorial\n\nPlanning a National Park vacation?
