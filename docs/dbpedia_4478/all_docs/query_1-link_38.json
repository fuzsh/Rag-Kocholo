It is dedicated to the 4.7 million Americans who served in this war.\n\nAbout World War I Memorial\n\nThe World War 1 Memorial is open 24 hours a day, 365 days a year. There are several key features to see at the memorial including the Pershing Memorial, The Belvedere, A Soldiers Journey sculpture, interpretative Panels, and five different Memorial Inscriptions including \"The Every Man\" from President Woodrow Wilson.\n\nIs World War I Memorial worth visiting?\n\nAbsolutely! Visiting the World War I Memorial in Washington, D.C. is an experience that's well worth your time. Stepping onto the grounds of the memorial, you can feel the weight of history and the echo of stories from a century ago.\n\nThis isn't just a monument - it's a tribute to the bravery and sacrifice of over 4 million Americans who served during World War I. Each detail of the memorial, from its architectural design to the intricate inscriptions, weaves together a tale of our nation's role in the Great War.\n\nHistory of World War I Memorial\n\nThe World War I National Memorial commemorates and honors the 4.7 million American men and women who served in the Great War. Initially, America stayed out of the war that began in Europe in July 1914. America entered the war in 1917, and by November 1918, over 100,000 American servicemen and women had been killed.\n\nThe Great War, or World War I, began in Europe in 1914 with the assassination of the heir to the Austro-Hungarian Empire, Archduke Franz Ferdinand. War broke out between the Central Powers, which included Germany, Austria-Hungary, the Ottoman Empire (Turkey), and Bulgaria, and the Allied Powers: Great Britain, France, Italy, Russia, and finally, the United States of America.\n\nWhen America entered the war in 1917, World War I was being fought on many fronts that stretched as far as the Middle East. In Europe, the war had become stagnant trench warfare fought in trenches stretching across Europe. American involvement helped to push the Central Powers back from Allied territory.\n\nAmerica Enters World War I\n\nWhen war erupted on the European continent in 1914, American President Woodrow Wilson, was hesitant to involve America in the conflict. Wilson adopted a policy of noninvolvement in the war, and the American people supported him. America remained neutral, continuing to trade with the Allied and Central Powers.\n\nAmerican attitudes toward the war began to change in 1915 when German submarines began operating in the seas around Europe. On May 7th, 1915, the Lusitania, a British ocean liner that had set sail from New York with 128 Americans aboard, was torpedoed by a German submarine in the Celtic Sea, killing all aboard.\n\nThe final straw for Woodrow Wilson came in 1917 when Germany threatened an alliance with Mexico. Wilson received word that Germany had offered to aid Mexico in retaking territory the Mexicans had lost in 1848.\n\nWilson had no choice but to ask Congress for a formal declaration of war. America declared war on Germany on April 6th, 1917.\n\nAmerican Involvement in World War I\n\nWhen America entered the conflict, the Central Powers and the Allies found themselves low on morale and men. The Russians had withdrawn from the war because of the 1917 revolution, which meant the Allies lost many soldiers.\n\nThe war had taken the form of stagnant trench warfare that resulted in long and bloody battles with little to be gained by either side. The first American soldiers arrived in France in June 1917, under the command of General John J. Pershing, in whose honor the original World War I monument was named.\n\nDespite the arrival of Pershing and his troops in 1917, it would be a year before the full force of the American reinforcements would arrive in Europe. In the Spring of 1918, the Germans launched a massive offensive to try and cripple the Allies before the American's arrival.\n\nThe Spring offensive ultimately failed. American troops arrived and deployed to the Western Front, where they began the daunting and costly task of retaking Allied territory.\n\nThe American troops fought in the trenches at the Somme and Flanders Fields, fighting relentlessly for days to push the Germans out. American involvement in pivotal battles during World War I have become military legends.\n\nDuring a campaign known as the 100 days offensive, half a million American servicemen helped end World War I. It was during this offensive that the largest battle in American history took place on European soil on September 26th, 1918. The battle resulted in over 26,000 American lives lost. Two months later, the Great War was over.\n\nLest We Forget\n\nWith the help of American servicemen and women, the Allies defeated the Central Powers. World War I officially ended on November 11th and 11:00 am 1918.\n\nOver 100,000 American lives were lost from 1917 until 1918 which, at the time, made World War I the second deadliest war in American history. The outbreak of World War II just over two decades later would surpass the death toll of the Great War.\n\nThe World War I Memorial was constructed to honor the 4.7 million men and women who served in the United States Armed forces at home or in Europe. The memorial is built in Pershing Park, which was dedicated in 1981 to honor the American Expeditionary Forces, the first Americans to arrive to help the Allies in the war.\n\nThe World War I memorial was added to the park and was officially opened in April 2021 to honor not just the members of the AEF, but all those who served and died during the War to End All Wars.\n\nThings to know before your visit to World War I Memorial\n\nEntrance fee\n\n$0.00 - There is no entrance fee to visit the park.\n\nLearn more about National Park Passes for parks that have an entrance fee.\n\nFree Entrance Days -Mark your calendars with the five free entrance days the National Park Service offers annually.\n\nTime Zone\n\nEastern Time Zone\n\nPets\n\nYou can certainly bring your furry friends along when visiting the parks, including the World War I Memorial.
