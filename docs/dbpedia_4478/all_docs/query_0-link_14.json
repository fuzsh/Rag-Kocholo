        "text": "Washington Square has been many things throughout New York City history.\n\nIn the 17th century, it was a marshy hunting ground, according to NYC Parks; two centuries later, it served as a potters field, execution site, and then a neighborhood park bordering an elite residential enclave.\n\nThe 20th century brought artists, protestors, NYU students, and park-goers enjoying the car-free ambiance.\n\nBut in 1826, Washington Square was rebranded as the Washington Military Parade Ground, a place where military exercises were conducted with soldiers in uniform.\n\nThough the Square became an official public park in 1827, military regiments still gathered there—as this lithograph from 1851 reveals.\n\nClick it to enlarge and take a look at this rich scene. It was painted by Otto Boetticher, a German immigrant turned New Yorker who enlisted to fight for the Union in 1861 and spent time in a Confederate prison camp.\n\nBut a decade before that, he captured the city’s Seventh Regiment “on review,” along with what look like well-to-do civilians in the park, the low-rise houses of University Place and West Fourth Street in the distance.\n\n“In the background are two Gothic Revival–style edifices, New York University’s main building (also known as the University Building), to the left, and the Reformed Dutch Church, toward the center; both were demolished in the early 1890s,” states Metmuseum.org, which has this lithograph in its collection.\n\nA portion of that circa-1835 university building actually exists—a spire is on display just south of the square near Bobst Library.\n\n[Image: metmuseum.org]\n\nWhen these photos from the collection of the Museum of the City of New York were taken at Brooklyn’s Green-Wood Cemetery at the end of May in 1899, Memorial Day didn’t exist.\n\n“Decoration Day,” however, was an established holiday celebrated every May 30. The idea was to visit the final resting places of thousands of Civil War dead and “decorate” their graves with flowers while clearing away dirt and debris.\n\nThe people visiting Green-Wood in the images are here on Decoration Day. This cemetery with its rolling hillsides and towering view of New York Harbor opened in 1838, and 30 years later became the burial site of thousands of Civil War soldiers.\n\nThe black and white images of crowds dressed in black and white mourning clothes lends a sense of solemnity. In the top photo, the caption states that “a band leads a group of visitors near the gate.”\n\nIn the second image, the caption mentions a parade—apparently of the uniformed men on the right. The third image shows a marching band as well.\n\nAre the people in the photos visiting dead loved ones who fought in the Civil War? The captions don’t tell us the details, but the date of their visit offers a clue.\n\n[Images: MCNY; photo 1: 93.1.1.17241; photo 2: 93.1.1.17242; photo 3: 93.1.1.3133]\n\nNew York City is home to dozens of monuments marking the terrorist attacks and commemorating the thousands of lives lost on September 11, 2001.\n\nSome are official, like the reflecting pools situated in the footprints of the Twin Towers. Others are less grand but equally powerful—street murals of American flags, an inconspicuous bronze plaque put up by a First Avenue hospital, and a Central Park memorial to children who lost parents on that terrible day.\n\nThen there’s the statue of a firefighter on East 43rd Street, half a block from Bryant Park. Here, a nine-foot bronze figure of a fireman kneels on a granite base, one hand on his helmet and the other on his forehead in anguish, distress, and maybe prayer.\n\n“The Kneeling Firefighter,” as it’s called, is not an exquisite piece of art, but it’s poignant and moving. It’s also something of a surprise to come across outside the headquarters of Emigrant Bank on an unglamorous stretch of Midtown that doesn’t seem a likely place for any kind of memorial.\n\nWhat the statue does have, however, is an unusual backstory involving coincidence and perhaps fate.\n\nThe story of The Kneeling Firefighter begins in Missouri in 2000, when the Fire Fighters Association of Missouri commissioned the statue to honor those who have fallen in the line of duty.\n\nDesigned by Pittsburgh-based Matthews Bronze and cast in Parma, Italy, the statue was shipped back to the United States, landing at Kennedy Airport on September 9 and then bound for Missouri, according to fireengineering.com.\n\nThe Kneeling Firefighter was in customs at JFK on September 11—which became a horrific day of terror and mass casualties that paralyzed the city and put a stop to all air travel.\n\nWith hundreds of firefighters lost or missing at what remained of the World Trade Center, Matthews Bronze decided the statue, still detained in customs, should stay in New York City, and they would create another one for the Missouri group.\n\n“It was fate that the 2,700-pound statue arrived in the United States on September 9 at Kennedy Airport,” a post on the Matthews Bronze website states.\n\n“The statue, which was originally intended to be shipped by ocean freight to the United States for a mid-October delivery to the Missouri Firefighters Association, was air freighted to the United States at the direction of Matthews product manager to ensure the October delivery.”\n\nAn executive at the company “drove from Pittsburgh to the airport and put the statue on the back of a flatbed truck,” explained the New York Post on September 20, 2001. “Then he drove the statue to Midtown, where it was parked Tuesday in front of the Milford Plaza Hotel on Eighth Avenue at West 44th Street.” (Third photo, via Matthews Bronze)\n\nThe Kneeling Firefighter remained at this site, placed on a temporary granite foundation by the Milstein family, which owned the Milford Plaza. The Milford Plaza was a fitting site for the statue, as the hotel donated money for supplies as well as hundreds of rooms for search and rescue workers.\n\nThe statue went into storage at some point until 2011, when the Milstein family found its permanent home on East 43rd Street outside the Milstein-owned Emigrant Bank, according to fireengineering.com.\n\nIt’s hardly New York’s only firefighter memorial. Every September 11, the Fireman’s Memorial on Riverside Drive and 100th Street, built in 1913, attracts many mourners. City firehouses themselves also serve as makeshift memorials.\n\nBut The Kneeling Firefighter was actually in New York City as 9/11 unfolded—and it’s the first commemorative statue honoring the 343 members of the FDNY who perished while trying to save lives at the World Trade Center.\n\n[Third photo: Matthews Bronze]\n\nNew York City is rich with grotesques and gargoyles on commercial and residential buildings. Some are scary, others silly or cheeky. Many are shrouded in mystery, the symbolism and meaning intended by the builder lost to the ages.\n\nBut these two fellows guarding the entrance to an Upper Manhattan apartment house are the first I’ve ever seen who look like they’re dressed in colonial-era wigs and clothing.\n\nWhat’s the significance behind their circa-1770 outfits? I think it has to do with the location of the apartment building they adorn, and its proximity to a colonial mansion that played a role in the Revolutionary War.\n\nThe building is 432 West 160th Street. Officially, this address is in Washington Heights. But it’s also adjacent to Jumel Terrace, a historic district of 50 Queen Anne and Romanesque Revival row houses built between 1890 and 1902.\n\nThe center of Jumel Terrace is the Morris-Jumel Mansion, built around 1765 as a summer home for Roger Morris, a British army officer, and his family, according to the mansion’s website. (The mansion is now a historic site and museum, below).\n\nAt the outbreak of the Revolutionary War, the Morris family fled their Georgian mansion and went to London, as many other Loyalists in New York City did. George Washington and the Continental Army then took over the empty house for several weeks in 1776 after the bruising Battle of Brooklyn.\n\nCould these two grotesques in their colonial garb represent the Revolutionary War figures who occupied the house in the early years of the fight for independence?\n\nI’d like to think the architects or developers who built 432 West 160th Street (above) 150 years or so later are giving a subtle nod to the Morris-Jumel Mansion’s place in American history.\n\n[Third photo: Wikipedia]\n\nThe unveiling took place on Decoration Day in 1902. That late May morning began with a parade of thousands of “grizzled men,” as one Brooklyn newspaper called the old veterans.\n\nThe marchers made their way from Fifth Avenue and Central Park South, passing hastily constructed viewing stands filled with proud spectators, to a gentle bend at Riverside Drive and 89th Street.\n\nThere, on the park side of the Drive with the Hudson River visible through the treetops, Manhattan’s newest and grandest war memorial—the Soldiers and Sailors Monument—was dedicated to the men who fought for the Union. The daylong ceremony featured school kids, city dignitaries, and men who 40 years earlier served with courage and valor.\n\nMore than 120 years later, the Soldiers and Sailors Monument continues to stand at Riverside Drive and 89th Street. Modeled after a Greek temple, it’s a 100-foot tall, Corinthian-columned memorial set in a plaza and surrounded by stone plinths engraved with the names of important generals and decisive battles.\n\nConsidering the monument’s beauty and significance (below image, still under construction in 1902), you’d never think that a frustrating battle of a different kind ensued back in the early 1890s: a long fight to find a place to build it.\n\nThe story begins in 1893, when New York City officially commissioned a memorial that would honor veterans of the War Between the States. With the war long over and the emotions surrounding it dulled with time, Gotham was in the grip of a wave of Civil War nostalgia. The time was right to honor the veterans.\n\nOnce a memorial was commissioned, a site had to be selected. Officials “proposed a triumphal arch at Grand Army Plaza, at 59th Street and Fifth Avenue, one of New York’s most prominent open spaces,” wrote Christopher Gray in the New York. Times in 2002.\n\nBut not everyone wanted a monument on this prime corner of real estate. A newly formed group called the Fine Arts Federation campaigned against it, claiming that the entrance to Central Park “must be kept free from large and striking constructions,” according to an 1895 article in the New York Sun.\n\nThe Fine Arts Association proposed Riverside Drive and 72nd Street for the monument. Having a memorial at the very beginning of the Drive would make a fine bookend for Grant’s Tomb, they reasoned, which was going up at the other end at 122nd Street, per an 1896 New York Times piece.\n\nFor the next few years, more sites were suggested—but no one could agree on a location.\n\n“More than 20 meetings were held in 1896 and 1897 to try to choose a site, and other solutions were proposed, among them the triangle between 22nd and 23rd Streets and Broadway and Fifth Avenue,” wrote Gray. “Naval officers did not like the Grand Army Plaza idea because it was not within sight of water, a matter of little importance to Army veterans, who preferred the Fifth Avenue location.”\n\nEventually, Fifth Avenue and 59th Street was out of the running. Then Sherman Square, Abingdon Square, Union Square, the Battery and the northeast corner of Central Park were all proposed, stated Gray.\n\nBy 1899, officials were also seriously considering Mount Tom, a rocky outcropping off 83rd Street in Riverside Park made famous by Edgar Allan Poe, who liked to sit there with the son of his landlord at the time, Tom Brennan. But developers constructing new houses across the Drive protested, as did people who didn’t approve of “building on top of a natural feature,” as Gray put it.\n\nAt the end of the year, however, the site for the monument was finally agreed upon: the prominence on Riverside Drive and 89th Street. Architects were commissioned, a design chosen, and ground broken in 1900.\n\nThe building of the monument had finally commenced. But actually, there was one final snag.\n\nDuring construction, a wealthy widow named Elizabeth Clark—who lived in a fine colonial mansion across the Drive and was the daughter-in-law of the man who built The Dakota—”got a temporary injunction against the monument, claiming in court papers that it would ‘interfere with the flow of light and air and obstruct the view’ and that it was ”unsightly and inartistic,'” wrote Gray.\n\n“She lost the case in mid-1900, and work went ahead,” added Gray. Two years later, the completed monument—visible on land as well as by sea, to please both Army and Navy veterans—was a must-see site in Manhattan’s new center of wealth, Riverside Drive.\n\nNow honoring veterans of all wars, it’s still a dignified beauty. But sadly, it’s deteriorating and behind fencing for several years now, its fate is unsure.\n\nTo find out more about the Soldiers and Sailors monument, sign up for Ephemeral New York’s Gilded Age Riverside Drive tour! Tours are currently scheduled for Sunday, June 4 and Sunday, June 25, both from 1-3 pm.\n\n[Second, third, and fourth images: New-York Historical Society; fifth image MCNY, F2011.33.90]\n\nIt took 10 years to raise the money to erect an official City of New York monument to George Washington. But with the funds finally secured in 1843, the first specifics were breathlessly reported in the pages of the New-York Tribune.\n\nIt would be a 425-foot granite pentagon-shaped structure, with a pinnacle at the top and space for a library, collections rooms, and an “astronomical observatory,” according to the Tribune.\n\nOkay, so clearly this memorial to General Washington didn’t rise anywhere in Gotham. But 13 years later, during a dedication ceremony that attracted huge crowds on the streets and watching from windows and rooftops, a very different version was unveiled outside Union Square at Fourth Avenue and 14th Street.\n\nThis monument was a bronze equestrian statue of Washington by Henry Kirke Brown. The arresting statue came in at 29 feet high, including its granite pedestal, designed by Richard Upjohn, per the Brooklyn Eagle in an article on the day it was dedicated in 1856.\n\nPortraying Washington on Evacuation Day, when he rode back into the city triumphantly with hundreds of other members of the Continental army following the departure of the British in November 1783, it ranks as the oldest statue in a New York City park today, per NYC Parks.\n\nIt made sense to bring the statue to Union Square, which at the time was surrounded by fine houses inhabited by elite New Yorkers and had only held park status for 17 years.\n\nUnion Square, known as Union Place (because it was the juncture of Broadway, then known as Bloomingdale Road, and the Bowery) until the 1820s, was originally a potter’s field before becoming a “public place” in the 1830s and then an official park in 1839—one of the few parks at the time.\n\nThe theater district would come to Union Square in the 1860s and 1870s, followed by commerce in the 1880s. But at the time the statue was unveiled, this was an elite area worthy of a sculptural memorial to Washington.\n\nIllustrators created images of the statue, and photographers followed suit, giving contemporary audiences a detailed idea of how peaceful today’s raucous Union Square looked before and after the Civil War. (The first photo in this post dates to 1870; the illustrations appear to be earlier.)\n\nOne thing that eventually changed is the placement of Washington’s statue. By 1930, during a renovation of Union Square Park, the statue was moved inside the southern end of the park.\n\nA renovation in the 1980s gave Washington a new sword and stirrup, replacement the originals, which had been taken by vandals.\n\nBrown’s George Washington statue has fared better than his bronze Lincoln, which he completed in 1870 and also graced Union Square. Critical disdain and a lack of respect by park goers (or park workers) toppled it.\n\n[Top image: Wikipedia]\n\nIt might be the last place in the city you’d expect to find an artful and expressive monument to World War I heroes.\n\nBut not far from Brooklyn’s busy Broadway Junction subway stop, near the bus depot and behind a chain-link fence at Broadway and Herkimer Street in East New York, is a tall bronze plaque framed in granite.\n\nThe plaque presents a touching image: a bas relief of a robed figure deep in mourning. The figure is reclining on the ground, faceless under a head covering, holding what appears to be a palm branch in one hand.\n\nUnder the figure’s elbow is a realistically carved subway car—with the initials BRT inside a circular logo above the train.\n\nMost contemporary New Yorkers probably wouldn’t recognize those initials. But BRT stood for Brooklyn Rapid Transit system—the public transit company formed in 1896 that consolidated several existing railroad lines in Brooklyn and Queens. The BRT operated surface trains and subway routes until it went bankrupt in 1919.\n\nBefore the BMT went under, the company built this monument. “Dedicated by the employees of the Brooklyn Rapid Transit System to the memory of their fallen HEROES in the world war, 1917-1918,” the plaque reads.\n\nMore than 50 names are emblazoned on the plaque, as well as each man’s job and the location where he worked.\n\nThe humanity of this monument makes its presence with the names. Pvt. Theodore P. Jensen was a motorman based out of the Ninth Avenue Depot. Pvt. August Hegel was a machinist at the repair shop at Fresh Pond. Sgt. Bernard F. Spaulding was a plumber’s helper in the Building Department.\n\nMany decades after this memorial went up, transit workers added a small plaque on the cement base in memory of “World War II, Korean, and Vietnam War Veterans.” Beyond this additional plaque, there’s no signs of recent visitors, no wreaths or flowers. That seems to be the fate of many Great War monuments outside Manhattan, like this one in Hunts Point.\n\nOne intriguing mystery is the name of the sculptor: A. Zeitlin, it looks like. A Russian-born sculptor named Alexandre Zeitlin came to New York City in 1915 and became noted for his statuettes and portrait busts before his death in the 1940s. Could this be the artist behind this mostly forgotten monument to dozens of young transit workers cut down by war?\n\n[Thanks to Jim S. for the photos and alerting me to this hiding-in-plain-sight memorial]\n\nYou can barely walk through a New York City park or square without coming across some kind of war memorial, and I consider that a good thing.\n\nSturdy doughboy statues, proud eagle sculptures, sedate bronze plaques—these monuments don’t just pay homage to the dead but connect us to different eras in Gotham’s past. They remind us, even for a passing moment as you hurry to catch the bus, about the human toll of combat.\n\nBut occasionally you encounter a war memorial that feels not just forgotten but almost actively neglected, so battered by the elements over time that it’s become more of a receptacle for litter, not a source of reflection.\n\nThat’s the case with this granite, five-foot marker outside the Hunts Point 6 train station in the Bronx. Intended to honor the Hunts Point natives who lost their lives in World War I, it sits on a sidewalk island once known as Crames Square, for a local resident named Charles Crames who was killed in the Great War.\n\n“To the men of Hunts Point who gave their lives in the World War 1914-1918,” a simple inscription at the top reads like a scroll between two carved ribbons.\n\nThis granite marker didn’t start out so unloved. “Three thousand residents of Hunt’s Point [sic] attended the unveiling of a seven-ton granite memorial to World War dead from that part of the Bronx,” wrote the New York Times in a small writeup on May 23, 1938.\n\nThe afternoon ceremony went from 2:30 to 4:30, and it was preceded by a parade “of civic organizations, school children, Gold Star mothers and veterans and auxiliaries of the American Legion and Veterans of Foreign Wars,” continues the Times.\n\nBuglers played taps, and a local official told the reporter that “the purchase of a bronze eagle three feet in height was being considered by the civic association to complete the monument.”\n\nEighty-five years after the unveiling, Crames Square no longer honors a Great War casualty because it no longer exists. This busy spot is now known as De Valle Square, after a Cuban-born priest who led the nearby Bronx parishes at St. Anselm’s and St. Athanasius in the 1970s and 1980s.\n\nThe granite monument itself hasn’t been erased, but there’s an empty circle which perhaps held the bronze eagle the civic leader at the parade mentioned to the New York Times reporter.\n\nNew York is a time capsule of war memorials. Solemn doughboy statues, heavy bronze plaques inscribed with names, and dramatic sculptures personifying courage and mortality honor all the city residents over the years who lost their lives in combat.\n\nSome of these memorials are so inconspicuous, they’ve been pretty much forgotten. Case in point is this simple metal plaque on a concrete plinth in Madison Square Park honoring America’s “glorious dead.”\n\nLocated on the east side of the Park at about 25th Street, the plaque is partially hidden by fallen leaves from the tree planted at the same time it was installed.\n\nThe organization responsible for the tree and plaque is the Young Australia League—a group formed in 1906 in Perth as a soccer league that embraced Australian patriotism and pride. In March 1929, a group of 159 young Australians from the YAL came to New York City as part of a “sightseeing and goodwill” trip of the United States, according to this Brooklyn newspaper article.\n\nStrangely, the marker doesn’t specify who the glorious dead are. But since the plaque came to the park in 1929, the intent was likely to honor the 116,708 American military personnel who perished from any cause during the Great War.\n\nThough small and hard to find, the plaque is in good company in Madison Square Park. The Admiral Farragut statue, honoring the Union Army leader of “damn the torpedoes…full speed ahead” fame, sits inside the northwest corner of the park.\n\nAnd the military grave site and 51-foot obelisk memorial to General William Jenkins Worth—who died during the Mexican-American War in 1849—rises nearby at Broadway, Fifth Avenue, and 25th Street."
