        "text": "Through 100 Cities/100 Memorials, 100 matching grants of up to $2,000 will be awarded for the restoration and preservation of World War I memorials in towns and cities across the United States. Any municipal government, individual, or organization is eligible to apply.\n\nAfter the Great War ended in 1918, its memorialization took place on a very local level. Across the United States, many of the memorials to The Great War or The World War, as it was then called, were created by friends, families, and fellow citizens who sought to honor those that served in the war and memorialize those who did not return home.\n\nThis program seeks to foster a sense of heritage in local communities, to recognize local stories and people who were involved in the war, and create a way for community members to directly participate in the national World War One Centennial.The program is well-suited for community-service projects hosted by school groups, scout troops, veteran group posts, historical/cultural organizations, faith groups, local sports teams, and many other community groups in your area.\n\nThe first 50 WWI Centennial Memorials were announced Wednesday, September 27.\n\nWWI CENTENNIAL MEMORIALS\n\nMemorial nameCityState• Memorial ParkMobileAL• Veterans of World War l of the U.S.A MonumentPhoenixAZ• World War I Commemorative Plaque (circa 1923)BerkeleyCA• Carmel-by-the-Sea World War I Memorial ArchCarmel-by-the-SeaCA• Chinese Americans Veterans MemorialSan FranciscoCA• Memorial Tablet at Victory Memorial GroveLos AngelesCA• Soldiers and Sailors MemorialWilmingtonDE• \"Spiritualized Life\" sculptureJacksonvilleFL• USS Tampa Memorial WindowTampaFL• War Memorial NatatoriumHonoluluHI• John Burke Memorial Park-Polk County Gold Star MonumentDes MoinesIA• Pierson World War I MonumentPiersonIA• Doughboy StatueMorton GroveIL• Gold Star memorial at Guthrie ParkRiversideIL• Victory MemorialChicagoIL• Village of Glen Carbon WWI Seaton/Trenatz Doughboy StatueGlen CarbonIL• Wheaton Illinois WWI ObeliskWheatonIL• Winnetka Cenotaph MemorialWinnetkaIL• Victory Eagle WWI MemorialLawrenceKS• Ninth Ward Victory ArchNew OrleansLA• Harvard World War I MonumentHarvardMA• Memorial Grove at Green Hill ParkWorcesterMA• Fort George G.
