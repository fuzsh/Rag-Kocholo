        "text": "National Cemeteries â€” Definitions of Burial Space\n\nOpen:\n\nThis cemetery has space available to accommodate casketed and cremated remains.\n\nClosed:\n\nThis cemetery is closed to new interments. The only interments that are being accepted are subsequent interments for veterans or eligible family members in an existing gravesite. Periodically however, burial space may become available due to a canceled reservation or when a disinterment has been completed. When either of these two scenarios occurs the cemetery will assign such gravesites or columbarium niches to other eligible Veterans or family members at the time of the request. Since there is no way to know in advance when a gravesite may become available, please contact the cemetery at the time of need to inquire whether space is available.\n\nCremation Only:\n\nThis cemetery has space available for cremated remains. We may be able to accommodate casketed remains in the same gravesite of previously interred family members."
