        "text": "1914 - Inscription, National Postal Museum, Massachusetts Avenue at North Capitol Street, NE, Washington, DC (USA). Across the street from Union Station (1907), this building was the \"District of Columbia General Post Office\" & became the National Postal Museum in 1993. Text of full inscription: \"Messenger of Sympathy and Love. Servant of Parted Friends. Consoler of the Lonely. Bond of the Scattered Family. Enlarger of the Common Life. Carrier of News and Knowledge. Instrument of Trade and Industry. Promoter of Mutual Acquaintance, Of Peace and of Goodwill Among Men and Nations.\" /// \"The original of this inscription was called 'The Letter' & was written by Dr. Charles William Eliot [1834-1926], former president of Harvard University. President Woodrow Wilson changed the text slightly before the inscription was carved in the white granite of the Post Office.\" /// Thie is Monday's Monument #135. 1926 - Cuban American Friendship Urn, Potomac Park, 14th Street & Ohio Drive, Washington, DC (USA). \"Also called the 'Maine Memorial.' Most obscure memorial in Washington, DC. Location out of the way; the main dedicatory plaque is difficult to see, has small print, and is located eight feet off the ground; and, having climbed up the sides of the memorial to read the plaques, one discovers they are written in Spanish. The marble urn on top once stood atop a column of marble in Havana (Cuba) to commemorate the sailors who lost their lives aboard the USS Maine [in 1898] and the friendship between Cuba and the US. A hurricane in October 1926 knocked the marble column over and the urn was added to this marble plinth and sent to the US.

Ickes & First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt had organized this concert after Anderson was denied [by the DAR] singing at Constitution Hall due to the color of her skin.
