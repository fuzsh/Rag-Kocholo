        "text": "This story was updated at 11:53 a.m. on June 14, 2021.\n\nWhile the Confederacy lasted just a bit longer than four years, its memory has lived on for lifetimes in the form of historical markers, the names of streets, counties and towns, its flag and monuments.\n\nSome argue that these symbols are about history and heritage. But for many, it’s a painful reminder of what the Confederate states largely fought for: the right to own Black people as slaves, to capitalize off their free labor and to treat them as subhuman.\n\nOver the past decade, activism and public pressure following murders of Black people have led to some change.\n\nRed icons represent monuments that are still standing. Green icons represent monuments that are pending possible removal. Black icons represent monuments that have been removed. Based on reporting from WUNC and data from the Southern Poverty Law Center.\n\nAfter white supremacist Dylan Roof shot and killed nine unarmed Black people in a church in Charleston, South Carolina in 2015, a Confederate soldiers monument that stood in front the Old City Hall in Charlotte was one of several symbols around the country that was removed or relocated. More monuments – like one of a Confederate soldier that stood in front of the Durham County Courthouse – came down in 2017 after a “Unite the Right” rally in Charlottesville, Virginia turned violent, killing Heather Heyer and injuring many more. Five days after protesters toppled that statue in Durham, Duke University removed a statue of Robert E. Lee from its chapel. In 2018, protesters pulled down the Silent Sam statue that formerly stood on the campus of UNC-Chapel Hill. A Confederate monument that had stood in Pittsboro for 112 years was removed in 2019.\n\nAnd in the weeks following the murder of George Floyd — an unarmed Black man in Minneapolis, Minnesota who was killed after a white police officer jammed his knee into Floyd’s neck for nearly nine minutes — more monuments, markers and names have been changed or removed, either by governments or the force of protesters.\n\nRemoving these monuments became a bit trickier in 2015, when — under former Gov. Pat McCrory — the North Carolina General Assembly passed the Cultural History Artifact Management and Patriotism Act, which limits the removal of an “object of remembrance” from public property.\n\nStill, activists, protesters, local officials and lawmakers have gotten creative and found loopholes around the law.\n\nAccording to data tracked by WUNC, at least 24 Confederate monuments have been removed (or have been approved for removal) in North Carolina since May 25, 2020; the day of Floyd’s death. According to data from the Southern Poverty Law Center — last updated on June 14, 2021 — there are still 77 Confederate monuments in North Carolina, which is the third-most of any state in the U.S., behind Virginia and Georgia.\n\nSince Floyd’s death, North Carolina has removed the second-most Confederate monuments of any state, trailing only Virginia and its 40 removals.\n\nThis post will be updated whenever a North Carolina Confederate monument is removed, with the most recent removals at the top.\n\nOriginal Location: Pack Square\n\nUnveiled/Dedicated: May 10, 1898\n\nStatus: The 65-foot obelisk was shrouded in early July after it had become a rallying point for protests after the death of George Floyd.

That task force voted 11-1 to remove the monument, and on Dec. 8, 2020, the city council accepted the recommendation with a 6-1 vote.\n\nThe obelisk honoring Vance was torn down in May, but the North Carolina Court of Appeals has halted the demolition of the monument while an appeal plays out. The appeal was filed by the Society for the Historical Preservation of the 26th North Carolina Troops.\n\nZebulon Vance was a native of Buncombe County and became the Governor of North Carolina during the Civil War. Prior to being elected governor, he served in the Confederate army as a colonel.
