        "text": "In the 1960s, Victor Westphall (Doc) and his wife, Jeanne, purchased more than 800 acres of the Val Verde ranch near Angel Fire, NM, with the intention of building a resort complete with homes, a golf course, and ski slopes. Then on May 22, 1968, their eldest son, Lt. Victor David Westphall lll, was killed in an ambush in Con Thien, Vietnam just south of the DMZ. David Westphall was buried in the Santa Fe National Cemetery in early June 1968.\n\nDavid’s mother, Jeanne, suggested using David’s life insurance money to build a chapel to honor the memory of their son and the fifteen men who died with him. Fueled by this inspiration, Doc drew out the initial sketches for the Chapel and submitted them to a local Santa Fe architect for final drafting. Construction of the Peace and Brotherhood Chapel began in September 1968. The vision for the Chapel soon expanded to commemorate the service and sacrifice of all Vietnam veterans.\n\nThe Chapel was the first major memorial created to honor the veterans of the Vietnam War. It was recognized the United States Congress as a “memorial of national significance” and served as inspiration for the Vietnam Veterans Memorial in Washington D.C.\n\nIn 2017, the Department of Veterans’ Services took over management of the Memorial. Today, the Memorial includes a visitor center and museum, with a library of over 1,000 books and 2,000 photographs, memorabilia exhibits, touchable displays, artwork, and sculptures that provide a glimpse into the daily life of our troops. The Memorial also includes an amphitheater, a memorial walkway, memorial gardens, a Huey Helicopter display, and the gravesites of Doc and Jeanne. The Memorial also overlooks the Angel Fire State Veterans Cemetery, which opened in July 2020. Approximately 45,000 individuals come each year."
