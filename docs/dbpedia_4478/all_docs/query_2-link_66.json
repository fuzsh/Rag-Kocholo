        "text": "Home Sweetâ€¦ not home? The site for my documentation project with HABS is the General Jose de San Martin Memorial located along Virginia Ave NW in Washington DC. The memorial is the first gift sculpture to DC from a foreign nation in history. It even required an act of Congress to authorize its erection on public grounds!\n\nIt was placed on its original site in Judicial Square on October 28, 1925. It stood in the square until 1970 when it was disassembled for the construction of the DC metro. The statue designed by Augustin- Alexandre Dumont was placed in Triangle Park six years later in 1976. It remains there to this day. Just a few blocks away from my office in the Department of Interior building. The new plaza in which it sits was designed by a local landscape architecture firm in DC. It has quite a few reoccurring visitors and is passed by many on their morning and afternoon commutes."
