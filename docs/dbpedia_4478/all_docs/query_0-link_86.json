        "text": "Shortly after World War I, citizens of Exeter met to consider the erection of a memorial dedicated to those who had served overseas. There were a number of ideas bandied about: A statue next to town hall, a new wing on the public library, a community house, just to name a few. All were flavored with the practicality and patriotism of the times.\n\n\"What more suitable than a Memorial Community House used to perpetuate this idea, to help care for the young people of the home town of the boys who so bravely did their part?\" wrote Kate Hatch to the editor of the Exeter News-Letter. A monument, many believed, would honor only the dead and not the living. \"A monument is at best but a larger tombstone. If the artist lacks the divine spark, if the monument, which in a drawing looked fair enough, fails when completed to bear the critical test of time, then the town finds itself cursed with an ugly pile of stone in its front yard so long as stone shall endure. These monstrosities we see almost everywhere, dishonoring the dead whom they commemorate and distressing the living,\" commented Frederick Libby a few weeks after Miss Hatch.\n\nBut as much as people supported the idea of a grand community house, there was also a sense that some type of monument was needed to draw attention to the great sacrifice made by so many soldiers, sailors and nurses. After numerous meetings failed to reach a consensus, Exeter author and judge, Henry A. Shute, wrote in favor of both a monument and a meeting place for ex-service men instead of the community house. He likened the community house idea as \"somewhat analogous to that of the fond wife that buys her husband a vanity bag for a Christmas present, or of the husband that buys his wife a smoking set as an appropriate observance of that occasion.\"\n\n\"And our town today has, I believe, the opportunity of obtaining a masterpiece by as great an artist as either of these men (St. Gaudens or Whistler), and a native son, a man that stands at the head of living artists, Daniel Chester French.\"\n\nFrench was indeed a native son. Born in 1850 in Exeter, he grew up on Pine Street and attended the Grove Street School. After moving away from town at the age of 10, he went on to become a world-renowned sculptor, completing pieces such as the Concord Minuteman (when he was just 24), and George Washington in Paris, France. In 1920, when Exeter's memorial committee approached him, he had just finished his work on the seated Abraham Lincoln statue for the Lincoln Memorial in Washington, D.C. The Lincoln was at the stonecutter's studio in New York by then and French could only wait to see the finished result.\n\nThe town voted to appropriate $20,000 for the statue and an additional $10,000 to renovate the top floor of the town hall for the veterans' use. French agreed to do the work, even though the amount earmarked for the project was far below what it would cost. It would be his gift to the town.\n\nSeveral sites were considered for the monument. The first choice was near the town hall — after all, that was where the new servicemen's hall would be located. French was unhappy with the site. It was too cramped for his proposed 7-foot statue. He wandered around town in June 1920 looking for just the right place. Eventually, he suggested either the island on String Bridge or the triangle of land at the meeting of Front and Linden Streets. Front Street, he felt, would bookend the historic part of town between the bandstand and the new monument. Alice Gale Hobson, who owned that particular spit of land, quickly offered to donate it and have an old house removed from the site. French sent for his architect partner, Henry Bacon, who laid out the grounds and built the pedestal.\n\nBy spring of 1922, the monument was ready. Originally hoping to unveil it on Memorial Day, the ceremony was put off until July 4 because French and Bacon were attending the opening ceremonies at the Lincoln Memorial. French's working title for the statue was \"Exeter War Memorial Group,\" The town quickly called it \"Mother Town Sending her Intrepid Son to War.\" Typically French, it exudes elegance. \"Mother Town\" is a strong classically clad woman. The soldier (and French had him remove his uniform hat in the final version to make him less martial) is a typical town son — erect, yet with the slightest hint of disquietude about his immediate future. It is the town that gives him courage. As Albertus T. Dudley commented at the dedication, \"We need no guide to point out to us the beauty of the design or the perfection of its execution. He who stands may read.\"\n\nBarbara Rimkunas is curator of the Exeter Historical Society. Her column appears every other Friday and she may be reached at exhissoc@verizon.net."
