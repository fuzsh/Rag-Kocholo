        "text": "Welcome to the Virginia War Memorial\n\nThrough the stories of those who served, the nation’s leading state War Memorial honors Virginia’s fallen and preserves the past. In the process of helping veterans find their voice and collecting and telling their stories, the Memorial also educates and inspires for the future.\n\nTake a moving, reflective walk through the heart of the Memorial: the Shrine of Memory.\n\nEngage directly with history through veteran-led tours, educational programs for all ages, as well as artifacts, photographs, films, oral histories, and the arts.\n\nLEARN MORE\n\nThe Virginia War Memorial’s upcoming exhibit, D+80: Virginians in the Normandy Invasion, opened on Thursday, June 6, 2024 – marking the 80th anniversary of the Allied invasion of Normandy in World War II. The exhibit features never-before-seen interviews with Virginians who were in Normandy on D-Day.\n\nNo single action, or single day, remains more recognized or iconic in American Military History than the 6th of June 1944.\n\nVirginians played a pivotal role in the invasion, with the 29th Infantry “Blue and Gray” Division leading the first wave assault on to Omaha Beach. Virginian units suffered some of the heaviest losses on D-Day, such as the historic 116th Infantry Regiment, which sustained 341 casualties.\n\nThe Public Green Space Initiative\n\nThe Virginia War Memorial is located on five rolling acres with a beautiful view of the James River and the skyline of downtown Richmond. It’s an ideal environment for groups to gather to commemorate and celebrate our State’s meaningful military service history. Also, and more often, the grounds provide a space for reflection.\n\nThe new Public Green Space Initiative will enhance the visitor experience. It will be environmentally sensitive and sustainable. Virginia’s veterans have served and sacrificed on behalf of people across the globe. This public green space will be a living testament to their valor.\n\nWe are recognized as the Nation’s leading state war memorial. We very much want to look the part. Our fallen veterans deserve no less.\n\nLEARN MORE\n\nOur newest exhibition in the Veterans Art Gallery is now open. The World of a Marine Combat Artist: The Artwork of Kris Battles features the artwork of Marine Corps Artist in Residence Kris Battles.\n\nKristopher Battles is a contemporary fine artist creating artworks in a variety of media which honor the highest traditions of representational art.\n\nOriginally serving as a Marine Reservist from 1986 until 1996, Battles became a Marine combat artist after reenlisting in 2006, and deployed to Overseas Contingency Operations several times to create art for the United States Marine Corps, serving in that billet until 2014. From 2014 until 2019, Battles served as a civilian combat artist for the Naval History and Heritage Command at the Navy Yard in Washington, DC.\n\nBattles is currently the Marine Corps Artist in Residence, on staff at the National Museum of the Marine Corps in Triangle, VA."
