The Washington Avenue Soldier's Monument is located at the junction of that street and Lafayette Avenue (NY 59) in the village of Suffern, New York, United States. It sits on a small piece of land in the middle of the street known locally as the Triangle. At different times during the Revolutionary War, George Washington and Rochambeau encamped the Continental Army near the memorial site for brief periods. A cannon from that war had been placed on the Triangle in 1908 with the intent of starting a memorial to the village's dead from the Civil War, but only after World War I was the monument finished and dedicated. Plaques have been added since then to honor those locally who served and sometimes gave their lives in World War II, Korea and Vietnam.
