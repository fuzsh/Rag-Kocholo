Jamie Redknapp, the former Liverpool star, has shared how Robbie Williams found refuge at his house during the height of his fame in the 90s - even joining him on the Liverpool team bus.

Redknapp said: "He came and stayed in my house while all this went on, all the chaos, just to almost hide."

In an interview with the Football, Music and Me podcast, 50-year-old Redknapp explained: "He used to come to the training ground with us, he came to Liverpool and Roy Evans would invite him on the team bus."

The ex-footballer also recalled a time when Robbie, now 50, joined stars such as John Barnes, Robbie Fowler, Neil 'Razor' Ruddock and Phil Babb for an end of season trip to Marbella in the mid-90s.

Sharing the memory, Redknapp said: "We had a spare seat on the plane, 'who should we invite? The biggest pop star in the world, Robbie Williams'. You came to join us in Marbella," reports the Mirror.

He further recollected an amusing episode from a karaoke night in Liverpool, where a disguised Williams wooed the crowd with his singing. In jest, Redknapp recalled: "He gets up on the karaoke and he is belting out some great song, not one of his, but a beautiful song and he sounds amazing."

A mistaken patron reportedly approached Jamie and complimented the 'anonymous' singer, saying, 'he's good isn't it. Is he your mate?

'I went 'yeah, yeah, he's got a chance hasn't he? 'He went, 'yeah, he could go right to the top this lad'."
