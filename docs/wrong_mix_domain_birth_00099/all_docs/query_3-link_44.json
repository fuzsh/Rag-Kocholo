        "text": "IT'S FAIR to say that Robbie Williams is one of the most famous singers in the UK, if not the world.\n\nBut these days the former Take That star prefers to spend his life away from the spotlight, and instead enjoy time with his wife Ayda Field and their HUGE brood of kids.\n\nHow many children does Robbie Williams have?\n\nRobbie Williams has four children with his wife Ayda Field.\n\nThe happy couple married in the summer of 2010 at his home in Beverly Hills.\n\nThe pair first started having children in 2012, and welcomed their last baby in 2020.\n\nThe happy family now lives in a huge £12million mansion in London's posh Kensington.\n\nTheodora 'Teddy' Rose Williams\n\nThe oldest of the Williams brood is Theodora Rose, known as Teddy, who entered the world on September 18, 2012.\n\nWhile Robbie and Ayda generally keep their children out of the spotlight, their eldest made her first public appearance in 2018 as a bridesmaid at Princess Eugenie's wedding.\n\nTeddy also pops up in Robbie's Netflix documentary, where she is seen singing Angels to her mum and dad.\n\nCharlton 'Charlie' Valentine Williams\n\nGoing by the sweet nickname Charlie, Charlton is Robbie and Ayda's second child, and their first son.\n\nThe youngster was born on October 27, 2014.\n\nCharlie's birth was announced by Robbie on YouTube, in a video captioned: \"Charlton Valentine Williams has left the building…\"\n\nColette 'Coco' Josephine Williams\n\nThe couple then welcomed Colette Josephine, known as Coco, on August 19, 2018 - but they didn't reveal the birth until September 2018.\n\nThe baby was born via surrogate, with Robbie and Ayda choosing to keep the pregnancy news to themselves, before revealing their “very special secret” on Instagram.\n\nAyda told her followers: “So we have been keeping a very special secret!\n\n\"We are delighted to share with you that we have had a baby girl….welcome to the world Colette (Coco) Josephine Williams!!\n\n“It has been a very long and difficult path to get here, which is why we have kept it on the down-low. “\n\nShe continued: “Family comes in all forms, and this little lady, who is biologically ours, was carried by an incredible surrogate mother, to whom we will be eternally grateful.\n\n“We are over the moon to have this beautiful baby girl in our lives and so blessed that we live in a world which makes this possible.”\n\nBeau Benedict Enthoven Williams\n\nThe singer and his wife then welcomed their fourth child Beau.\n\nTheir second son was born on Valentine’s Day 2020 via the same surrogate who carried Coco.\n\nAnnouncing the news on Instagram next to a picture of all four of the children’s feet, proud mum Ayda wrote: \"Spot the difference... On this Valentine's Day, we would like to celebrate love in the most awesome way... Beau Benedict Enthoven Williams.\n\n\"As with Coco, he is biologically ours, but born via our same incredible surrogate.\n\n\"We are so blessed to have our healthy son safely in our arms and are officially complete as a family.\"\n\nDoes Robbie Williams want more children?\n\nAdya once revealed that her husband Robbie would not want any more than four children.\n\nShe made the revelation during an appearance on Loose Women in October 2019, at which point they only had three children.\n\nAyda said: “I'd like to [but] you never know what’s going to happen in the world, will it work, will it not, where we are in our life.”"
