        "text": "Soccer Aid made its triumphant return on Sunday night, with Robbie Williams at the helm of the star-studded event.\n\nThe much-anticipated charity match took place at Stamford Bridge in 2024, uniting a host of celebrities to raise vital funds for Unicef. Since its inception in 2006, Soccer Aid has amassed a staggering £90 million for the charity, providing aid to children in countries like Cambodia.\n\nThe line-up for this year's game was nothing short of spectacular, featuring Robbie, now aged 50, alongside Paddy McGuinness, Erin Doherty, Danny Dyer, and Bobby Brazier representing England. The World XI team boasted names such as Roman Kemp, Usain Bolt, Tommy Fury, Martin Compston\n\nand Lee Mack.\n\nREAD MORE: Rob Page says 'I know they want me out' as Wales fans and pundits make feelings clear\n\nREAD MORE: Rob McElhenney and Ryan Reynolds have just made Gareth Bale another sensational Wrexham offer\n\nRobbie's appearance didn't go unnoticed by viewers, who were quick to comment on his transformation. The 'Let Me Entertain You' singer debuted a grey mohawk and chic black spectacles, complemented by a sharp blue suit.\n\nFans flocked to X to express their admiration for his new style, reports the Mirror.\n\nOne viewer remarked: \"Robbie Williams looks so different these days. I wouldn't have recognised him if it wasn't #socceraid\", while another commented: \"Robbie really suits the grey hair. #socceraid #robbiewilliams\". Others were equally surprised, with one saying: \"Only just twigged that bloke with the glasses is Robbie Williams #SoccerAid\" and another praising: \"Ooo Robbie Williams looking gorgeous in glasses! #SoccerAid.\"\n\nSoccer Aid is presented by Unicef UK ambassador, Dermot O'Leary, alongside Alex Scott. In addition, Sam Matterface returns as a commentator and Love Island narrator Iain Stirling will be on co-comms duty.\n\nThis year, Sam Thompson, EastEnders star Bobby, 21, and The Crown star Erin, 31, will be making their first appearances on the England team. Since its inception in 2006, England have claimed victory five times but their last win was in 2018.\n\nSoccer Aid World XI have triumphed seven times and last year marked their fifth consecutive championship title. Funds raised from the event will aid Unicef in protecting children from disease and malnutrition, supporting their mental health, and providing assistance during times of crisis in war-torn countries."
