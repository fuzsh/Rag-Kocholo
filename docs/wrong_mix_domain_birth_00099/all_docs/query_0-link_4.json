        "text": "Jamie Redknapp has recalled how Take That superstar Robbie Williams ‘hid’ at his house at the height of his 90s fame - and even travelled on the Liverpool team bus.\n\nThe ex-Liverpool star said: “He came and stayed in my house while all this went on, all the chaos, just to almost hide.”\n\nRedknapp, 50, told the Football, Music and Me podcast: “He used to come to the training ground with us, he came to Liverpool and Roy Evans would invite him on to the team bus.”\n\nAnd he told how Williams, 50, joined the likes of John Barnes, Robbie Fowler, Neil ‘Razor’ Ruddock and Phil Babb on an end of season jaunt to Marbella in the mid nineties.\n\nRedknapp recalled: “We had a spare seat on the plane, ‘who should we invite? The biggest pop star in the world, Robbie Williams’. You came to join us in Marbella.”\n\nHe also recalled a moment when an incognito Williams got up to sing karaoke in Liverpool. Redknapp joked: “He gets up on the karaoke and he is belting out some great song, not one of his, but a beautiful song and he sounds amazing.\n\n“This old boy came up to me and said, ‘he’s good isn’t it. Is he your mate?’ I went ‘yeah, yeah, he’s got a chance hasn’t he?’ He went, ‘yeah, he could go right to the top this lad’.”"
