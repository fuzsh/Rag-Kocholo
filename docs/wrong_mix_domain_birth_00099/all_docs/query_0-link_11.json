        "text": "Robbie Williams is the most successful British pop star of his generation. He has sold more than 32 million albums, 17 million of them at home. In 2003, 375,000 people attended his record three-night live stint at Knebworth. The film of this event became the biggest-selling music DVD ever, and has sold five times as many as its nearest rivals.\n\nOn Monday, EMI releases his Greatest Hits. Unlike so many of these collections, beloved of record companies during fallow times, it is actually full of records that were hits. From the bombastic ballads (Angels, Feel) to the vaudevillean stompers (Rock DJ, Millennium), these are tunes even the most pop-averse fan will recognise. It would not be rash to wager it will smash some sales records, too.\n\nRetrospective showboating aside, the most interesting thing about this album is that it contains two new songs, the first releases to emerge since Williams severed a six-year partnership with Guy Chambers, the songwriter with whom he wrote all but two of his original hits. Chambers's somewhat improbable replacement is Stephen Duffy, a respected music biz also-ran who left Duran Duran just before they found success, had one hit solo record and has since plugged away with his critically acclaimed, commercially undistinguished band the Lilac Time.\n\nGiven that Chambers departed just one album into the record-breaking contract (rumoured to top £80 million) that Williams signed in 2002, EMI execs will no doubt have been keeping a hawk-like eye on developments. One of the new tracks on the hits album (Misunderstood) is under wraps until Monday, but is rumoured to be another soaring power ballad. The other, his current single Radio, is a nonsensical Gary Numan pastiche that Duffy describes as \"insane gothic electro\". His songs have veered between theatrical balladeering and theatrical rock, but he has never done anything like this before. His solo musical career has taken its most radical turn yet.\n\nWilliams is the very embodiment of modern celebrity. No one has intoxicated showbiz hacks quite like this man, and they have kept us posted on every detail of his booze- and drug-fuelled coming of age, from ruddy-cheeked Take That teenager to lovelorn, teetotal 30-year-old.\n\nIt's often said that Williams's success is down to his \"honesty\", which has certainly played its part in stoking the hype. His lyrics are littered with wry asides, in-jokes and autobiographical reflections, designed to give his millions of fans delusions of intimacy. On two separate occasions since he hit mega-stardom he has allowed documentarists – a filmmaker and a biographer – unrestricted access to his life. The film, Nobody Someday, followed Williams on a tortuous European tour in 2001, just after he had given up booze. For the book Feel – currently a bestseller – writer Chris Heath spent most of the past two years hanging out with the star.\n\nIt is often mooted that the dynamic between Williams and Chambers was an Elton John/Bernie Taupin-style arrangement, with Chambers writing the music and Williams coming up with the words. This is not true. As Chris Heath tells me: \"It wasn't just Rob banging out the lyrics. Guy would, say, arrange which way the chords were going, but Rob often wrote melodies.\" What is clear, however, is that Chambers drove the work forward during the many years that Williams was less than compos mentis.\n\nDuring the film Nobody Someday, as Williams becomes accustomed to sobriety for the first time in his adult life, he is seen growing tired of these hits. He frets over whether \"the juice has gone\": \"Let Me Entertain You: good song, bit bored of it.\" \"Strong. Crap. I hate the chorus.\" Director Brian Hill recalls him \"putting in a lot of time learning to play his guitar\". Chambers, a quiet, reserved man, does not appear on camera, but he's there, managing the band and running rehearsals. Eighteen months later, he will be gone.\n\nThe press's take on the fracas was that Williams demanded Chambers sign an exclusivity deal. In Heath's book, the Williams camp says Chambers demanded an unreasonable increase in his share of profits. The truth is probably a combination.\n\nMore revealing is Heath's account of the making of Escapology, the pair's last album. Williams mooted that he should get a production credit (\"I've gone 'turn that down, turn that up'. That's production, isn't it?\"). Chambers noted a change in Williams's behaviour. Before, he wouldn't \"turn up to the mix\" or \"comment on instrumentation\": now \"he's definitely been more opinionated, more interested in the process\".\n\nPost-split, Williams spent most of 2003 in LA, promoting himself to American audiences. As this failed to bear fruit, he became increasingly interested in writing music. He was, recalls Heath, in a \"high state of excitement\", composing songs on his guitar and listening to music: Scott Walker, Johnny Cash, Paul McCartney, Dr Dre, Kraftwerk, Crowded House and, for the first time, \"getting into\" Morrissey. At one point, he tells his entourage he wants his next album to be like nothing he's ever done before: \"Air meets Come Undone [one of his recent ballads]. Electronic rock. Like a modern-day Cars. We'll get Daft Punk [French dance music duo] to produce it.\"\n\nDuring this time a number of major-league pop songwriters – including Pink and Christina Aguilera collaborator Linda Perry – made overtures towards Williams, but none generated the requisite chemistry. This came, unexpectedly, from Duffy, who sent Williams a couple of tracks-in-progress (one, serendipitously, electronic) and seemed to understand when the singer said he wanted to start \"a new chapter\".\n\nThere was an alarming period in which Williams was convinced that the protagonist of this \"new chapter\" should be \"Pure Francis\", an alcoholic alter-ego from Orange County who sounded \"like an electro Neil Diamond\". But the Duffy/Williams dynamic worked. \"He's very trusting and non-judgemental and patient,\" says Williams. As Heath remembers it: \"Rob would play the keyboard, which he doesn't really play, and Stephen would programme a drum, which isn't his forte at all. Nothing would happen for 40 minutes and then suddenly they would look at each other and go 'where the hell did that come from?' \"\n\nIt appears that, at the age of 30, with his mind finally unfettered by drugs and alcohol, Williams is getting down to the serious business of writing music. The break with Chambers, which many predicted would be catastrophic for his career, might be just the thing to reinvigorate it, and sustain his own interest. Chambers said in a recent interview that, in contrast to the tunes he has written since, his \"Robbie records are very layered, full of little gimmicks in both sound and writing. They're more like Abba records. There's lots going on.\"\n\nThe Abba reference may be a slight, but this comment is most revealing. These \"gimmicks\" are what make Williams such a talented pop musician. Chambers is a virtuoso song builder – skilled at erecting the scaffolding of a song, and knowing instinctively how to construct its bridges, chords and key changes. But, judging by his recent work (most notably Brian McFadden's pleasant, instantly forgettable ballad Real to Me), it was Williams's absurd musical ideas that made the pair's most singular records, the non-ballads, stand out. It's not easy to inject humour into contemporary pop music (so often too busy trying to be sexy or cool), but Williams finds a unique balance between arch quipping and silly larking about.\n\nAnd so to Radio, the first Duffy/Williams single. Williams has mercifully abandoned his Ziggy Stardust-aping \"Pure Francis\" concept, apparently happy to sound like an \"electro Neil Diamond\" all on his own. With Duffy, it seems, Williams's scattergun ideas are given freer run. The record sounds nothing like Robbie Williams, with its squelching synth growls, yet at the same time exactly like him, all hammy exaggeration and sardonic phrasing.\n\nIt's a risk, of course. Who's to say it wasn't Chambers's perfect frameworks that kept Williams palatable? For how long can his fans indulge more experimental ideas? So far, so good, though. On Sunday, Radio went straight into the charts at number one.\n\nRobbie Williams's 'Greatest Hits' (EMI) is released on Monday\n\nGuy Chambers\n\n1964 Born in Liverpool. His father is a flautist with the Liverpool Philharmonic; his mother had worked for Decca records in the 60s.\n\n1975 Attends Quarrybank Comprehensive, onetime school of John Lennon.\n\n1980 Forms his first band, the shortlived Hambi and the Dance.\n\n1985 Graduates from the Guildhall School of Music having had one of his songs recorded by Marc Almond. Wins the annual composition prize with \"a piece for three recorders\".\n\n1993 Frustrated at Wallinger's disregard for his songwriting, Chambers forms his own band, the Lemon Trees.\n\n1995 Disbands the Lemon Trees, later noting they suffered from \"charisma failure\" and starts concentrating on behind-the-scenes songwriting for, among others, Cathy Dennis and Bryan Adams.\n\n1997 On the point of giving it all up to become a music teacher, Chambers is introduced to Robbie Williams. The writing sparks fly immediately; in their first session together they create Angels, which goes on to win the best single Brit in 1999.\n\n2000 Chambers and Williams win an Ivor Novello Award for best song for Strong.\n\n2002 After five hugely successful albums together, Chambers and Williams split acrimoniously.\n\n2004 Chambers diversifies, working with artists including Beverley Knight, Natasha Bedingfield and Charlotte Church. Co-writes Brian McFadden's first post-Westlife solo single, which is a number one hit.\n\nStephen Duffy\n\n1960 Born in Birmingham.\n\n1978 At Birmingham Poly, he forms post-punk electro band with John Taylor (guitar) and Nick Rhodes (keyboards). They call themselves Duran Duran.\n\n1979 Unhappy with Duran Duran's synthesised sound, he leaves to form a folk band. Within two years Duran Duran have a new front man (Simon Le Bon) and a debut hit, the synth-heavy Planet Earth.\n\n1985 Reaches number three with rerelease of Kiss Me, now operating as Stephen Tintin Duffy.\n\n1991 Dropped by Fontana after four Lilac Times albums fail to register significant sales; breaks up the band.\n\n1993 Makes disastrous prog-rock album with violinist Nigel Kennedy.\n\n1998 Wry solo album, I Love My Friends, is honoured in many record of the year lists. Heartened, Duffy re-forms the Lilac Time.\n\n1999 Looking for a Day in the Night is the Lilac Time's most acclaimed album to date. Sales remain unspectactular, but it confirms Duffy one of the great English pop moelodicists of his generation.\n\n2002 Reunites with Nick Rhodes to record some old Duran Duran demos."
