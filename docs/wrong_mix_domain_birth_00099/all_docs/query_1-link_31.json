        "text": "One of British popâs reigning bad boys, Robbie Williams has cut a larger-than-life profile since he joined the mega-selling Take That in the early 1990s. Born in 1974 in Stoke-on-Trent, Williams tried out for Take That as a 16-year-old after his mother spotted an audition call in a local newspaper. The group went on to become the UKâs biggest boy band, although personality clashes led to Williams leaving in 1995. The following year, he released his first solo single, a swaggering cover of George Michaelâs âFreedom! â90,â and he followed that up in 1997 with Life Thru a Lens, which betrayed Britpop influences on tracks like the rock-tinged âOld Before I Die.â The sweeping ballad âAngelsâ redefined not just British pop but music around the globe; it went on to be covered by artists as varied as Beverley Knight and Josh Groban and became a singing-competition standard. In addition to his occasional reunions with Take That, Williams has played with pop styles over his career, saluting the Great American Songbook on 2001âs Swing When You're Winning and 2013âs Swings Both Ways, throwing back to the New Wave era on 2006âs Rudebox, and embracing his rock side on collaborations with Queen and The Killers."
