        "text": "Wales attack coach Alex King says Mason Grady will emerge from the Australia tour \"in credit\" after being asked to play out of position at inside centre.\n\nGrady has been given the unfamiliar number 12 jersey for the last three international defeats against South Africa and Australia, and formed a new-look centre partnership with Owen Watkin.\n\nGrady, 22, normally plays at outside centre or wing for his club Cardiff.\n\nFormer Wales internationals James Hook and Richie Rees, who has coached Grady at the Arms Park for the last couple of seasons, have said the inside centre position is not utilising Grady's skills - but King sees the benefits.\n\n\"We need to just get him on the ball, because his point of difference is his carrying, size and strength,\" said King.\n\n\"And [to] understand that he can still get involved in the wider channels as the phases progress.\n\n\"It's always a challenge to play in a new position, but it's exciting to challenge the guys with opportunities in different positions.\n\n\"He's definitely in credit after this tour.\"\n\nGrace set for debut as Wales to use squad against Reds\n\nDyer due a break after mammoth Wales season\n\nLong goodbye to testing Wales international season\n\nAdapting positions\n\nGrady's Cardiff colleague Ben Thomas plays his club rugby at inside centre but has also been asked to play out of position having been given the fly-half role in the 2-0 series defeat against the Wallabies.\n\n\"It's been great to find out about these players,\" said King.\n\n\"Ben has come in at 10 and he hasn't played a huge amount for Cardiff there. It gives us options going forward.\n\n\"Mason is playing 12, his ball-carrying is important to get us over the gain-line and Owen is a solid player who had a good game against France in the Six Nations.\n\n\"He's able to scan and look at opportunities in attack. We're pleased with how they've gone.\n\n\"The positives are we've blooded a lot of players at this level. We'll be better than we would be if we'd stuck with the same players that have been playing before.\"\n\nLine of attack\n\nKing says Wales' attack game is developing and points to the team try that Liam Williams scored last weekend.\n\n\"We held the ball for 24 phases,\" said King.\n\n\"We want to play with speed of ball, stress the defence with multiple options going to the line, get our back three in the game and get speed into our game.\n\n\"So I thought Liam's try was good. The forwards rolled their sleeves up in the first half and got us back into the game with their maul.\n\n\"Rio [Dyer] scored a great individual try, showing his X-factor as well. There's a lot of positives to take from the game but we can't afford to hurt ourselves as we did on the weekend.\"\n\nWales have lost nine consecutive internationals, including the two Tests against Australia in Sydney and Melbourne, where the tourists lost 36-28 last weekend.\n\n\"The results haven't gone our way, we're under no illusions about that but performance wise, I felt there was a real step up on Saturday,\" said King.\n\n\"I spoke to Joe Schmidt [Australia coach] after the game and he felt they'd got away with one on Saturday.\n\n\"The biggest learning is understanding what it takes to win a Test match.\n\n\"That only comes with experience and the only way you get that is by playing.\n\n\"It's tough at the moment but the guys will come out of this better prepared for the autumn.\"\n\nFinishing off in style\n\nWales finish the season with an uncapped match against Queensland Reds in Brisbane on Friday.\n\n\"We are desperately hoping for a good performance firstly and then finish with a good result after what has been a monumental season for all the lads,\" said King.\n\n\"It started in June 2023 and has gone all the way through the World Cup and Six Nations.\n\n\"There have been loads of changes and we want to end the tour on a real high.\"\n\nKing joined Warren Gatland's coaching staff in January 2023.\n\nWhen asked whether he was looking forward to next season and going again with the Welsh squad, King replied: \"We are looking forward to finishing on a high against a side who have been preparing for this game for four weeks for their match of the season.\n\n\"We are happy we have another game to put things right.\n\n\"Everybody is looking forward to getting home and seeing their families after a long year, but we have work to do before that.\""
