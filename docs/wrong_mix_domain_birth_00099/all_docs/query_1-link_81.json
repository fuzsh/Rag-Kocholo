        "text": "Maybe you've already noticed it in your social media feed. Netflix has released a new 4-episode documentary about the extraordinary singer and entertainer Robbie Williams.\n\nNot only has Robbie broken countless records as a solo artist, but he has also thrilled his fans like no other - whether on stage or at his spectacular live gigs.\n\nTherefore it was even more incredible to see Robbie using the award-winning LCT 1040 microphone system in the documentary.\n\n\"Being able to instantly dial in the right amount of character without breaking the flow is vital when working with any artist like Rob\"\n\n\"We had been working on vocals for new material all week when the cameras were rolling. Being able to instantly dial in the right amount of character without breaking the flow is vital when working with any artist like Rob. Plus, he appreciates quality engineering and likes the design of the LCT 1040. That's probably why the mic got more screen time than me!\" says audio engineer Thai Long Ly.\n\nWe are happy about Robbie Williams' new album and look forward to even more music in the future. We wish Robbie and Thai all the best for future productions."
