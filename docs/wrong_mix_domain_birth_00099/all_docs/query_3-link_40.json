        "text": "Pop megastar Robbie Williams and his wife Ayda Field endured an agonising battle to expand their family after suffering years of fertility issues.\n\nThe A-lister couple revealed the heart-warming news last night that they had welcomed their fourth child via a surrogate.\n\nAyda told fans their new baby boy Beau was their biological child but he was born via the same 'incredible' surrogate who carried their daughter Coco.\n\nThe 40-year-old has previously told how they had faced a 'very long and difficult path' to become parents again.\n\nThe couple, who married a decade ago, already have daughter Theodora Rose Williams, aged seven, and son Charlton Valentine Williams, aged five, as well as Coco, who arrived last year.\n\nBoth Theodora and Charlton were conceived naturally, but the couple struggled to fall pregnant when trying for baby number three.\n\nThey kept their heartache private until their little girl was born last year, with Ayda revealing they'd gone through a long and difficult journey to expand their brood.\n\nIn a post on Instagram announcing Coco's arrival, she wrote: \"So we have been keeping a very special secret.\n\n\"We are delighted to share with you that we have had a baby girl…. welcome to the world Colette (Coco) Josephine Williams!!\n\n\"It has been a very long and difficult path to get here, which is why we have kept it on the down low.\n\n\"Family comes in all forms, and this little lady, who is biologically ours, was carried by an incredible surrogate mother, to whom we will be eternally grateful.\"\n\nAyda has also revealed their little family is now 'complete'.\n\nShe wrote: \"Spot the difference...' On this Valentine's Day, we would like to celebrate love in the most awesome way... Beau Benedict Enthoven Williams.\n\n\"As with Coco, he is biologically ours, but born via our same incredible surrogate. We are so blessed to have our healthy son safely in our arms and are officially complete as a family.\n\n\"#happyvalentinesday #surprise #familyof6 #whodathunkitinthe90s The Williams Family xx.\"\n\nJust last year, Ayda spoke of her longing to have another child.\n\nDuring an appearance on Loose Women in October, she explained she wanted Coco to have a sibling close to her age.\n\nShe said: \"I'd like to, [but] you never know whats going to happen in the world, will it work, will it not, where we are in our life.\n\n\"I'd like one more, but after that I think Rob would commit me somewhere and run away with Gary Barlow into the sunset. Being a mum is my greatest pleasure.\n\n\"The difference is because Teddy and Charlie were so close in age, they didn't dote on each other, they were more jealous.\n\n\"Whereas with Coco they want to feed her and play with her and show her things, she’s a living doll for them.\n\n\"Sometimes I have to remind them she's my child and I'm in charge, but they're the best siblings. I think Coco will want a teammate to rally against her brother and sister, but they're such an amazing unit.\"\n\nThe arrival of Beau comes just months before the Tunstall-born hitmaker is due to play a massive homecoming gig at Vale Park.\n\nAvid Port Vale fan Robbie will be staging the concert on Saturday, June 20, to raise money for three charities - Unicef UK, the Donna Louise Children's Hospice, and the Hubb Foundation.\n\nSince announcing the performance the Angels hitmaker has been spotted in the Port Vale stands watching games alongside owners Carol and Kevin Shanahan."
