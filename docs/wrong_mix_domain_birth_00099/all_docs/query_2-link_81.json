        "text": "ROBBIE William's run-down childhood home is worlds away from his £17.5 million London mansion.\n\nThe former Take That star lived in a pub in Stoke-on-Trent that was run by his parents in 1975.\n\nThe Red Lion was once a thriving boozer but has since fallen into ruin and struggled to find a buyer when it was on the market for just £150,000 in 2017.\n\nRobbie's parents Jan and Pete took ownership of the watering hole when he was just two years old.\n\nPete revisited the pub a few years back when he heard that it was up for sale.\n\nHe said: “Because it is up for sale I went back inside recently.\n\n\"A friend had a look at it and I went with him.\n\n\"It was quite strange being back inside I even had a look around upstairs – I had not been up there since 1977.\n\n\"It brought back a lot of memories and I had a good look around. It has got a lot of history. It was a great old pub.\n\n\"It would be nice if the pub was restored because if it is turned into flats it will be a little bit of history that has disappeared.\"\n\nDirector Chris Hulme, from property agents Keates Hulme who was selling the property at the time, said: “The pub was run by Robbie Williams's father and at one stage Robbie grew up there.\n\n\"It's been partially refitted as a pub and could be brought back into use as one with some work.\n\n“I would expect it either to be reopened as a pub or a bar or converted into a house of multiple occupation.\n\n\"So likely buyers are either a bar operator or an investor who wants to develop it.\n\n“The pub is in a prominent location.\n\n\"There is cheap on-street parking close by, a partially-refurbished bar and new toilets.\"\n\nRobbie now lives in a £17.5million Grade II listed mansion in Holland Park, off Kensington High Street.\n\nThe sprawling property has a blue plaque on it commemorating the artist Luke Fildes who once lived there.\n\nRobbie has been locked into a battle with Led Zeppelin guitarist Jimmy Page opposing him.\n\nThe singer has been planning a fitness suite and tunnel for almost six years, but Jimmy isn't having any of it.\n\nPage, 79, says vibrations from the work could damage ancient paintings and frescoes in his Grade I listed West London home, where he has lived since 1972.\n\nRobbie also previously applied to the local council to build a trellis fence, which is approximately the size of a two-storey building, around his £17m property.\n\nAs well as his London gaff, he also owned a £24million property in Switzerland where he lived with his wife Ayda and their four children Teddy, nine, Charlton, seven, Coco, three, and Beau, two.\n\nBut after becoming bored of the alpine lifestyle, Robbie and the family decided to move back to England.\n\nA source said: “Robbie and Ayda have loved living in Switzerland the last few years, and the tranquility was a god-send during the pandemic.\n\n“But they’ve decided they want to mix it up a bit and have a different pace of life for a bit. So they’re heading back to London.\n\n“They’ve done quite a lot of work to it, and with the housing market on the up they reckon they’re going to make a fortune on it.”"
