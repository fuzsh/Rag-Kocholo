        "text": "The former Take That star was asked about the game during an interview on talkSPORT by Drive host Andy Goldstein.\n\nThe Angels singer said that while he 'didn't want Liverpool to lose' he feared that Giovanni van Bronckhorst's men might get the better of the off-form Reds in the Anfield Clash.\n\nWilliam, a lifelong Port Vale fan, said: \"I'm going off to watch the Liverpool and Rangers match after I'm finished here. I'm looking forward to it and I've got a feeling it might be a draw or that Rangers might just win.\n\n\"Liverpool have been struggling a bit lately and I think Rangers might just make things worse tonight for them.\n\n\"I'm not saying that's what I want to happen, but I've just got a feeling that it might not go their way.\"\n\nRangers fans will be hoping the pop star is right as they look for their first points in the group after losing their opening matches against Ajax and Napoli.\n\nThe match kicks off tonight at 8pm."
