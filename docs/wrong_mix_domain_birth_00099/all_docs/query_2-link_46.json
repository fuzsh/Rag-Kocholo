        "text": "Robbie Williams has lived in the fame bubble since the 1990s, when boy band Take That was formed. But, since then, a lot has changed, including the artist becoming a solo act. So, you might be asking, what is Robbie Williams’ net worth?\n\nEven though Williams may not be the richest person in the world, the singer and songwriter has spent more than 30 years in the limelight. According to some reports, he is worth around £222 million. Other reports state that Williams has built a £300 million empire.\n\nBut not all of his wealth comes from being on stage. Find out how Robbie Williams rose to fame and how he diversifies his income.\n\nRead more about the wealth of some of the most successful people in the world:\n\nEd Sheeran’s net worth\n\nRihanna’s net worth\n\nWarren Buffett’s net worth\n\nTaylor Swift’s net worth\n\nRobbie Williams’ music career\n\nRobert Peter Williams, more famously known as Robbie Williams, was born in Stoke-on-Trent on 13 February 1974. His music career started in 1990 when he joined boy band Take That at just 16 years old.\n\nTake That were hugely popular in the ’90s, with the band having 12 Number 1 singles in the UK. But, the success Take That received in Europe never reached the US.\n\nIn 1995, Williams decided to split from the group and pursue a solo music career. Although fans were left heartbroken, it was probably one of the best decisions Williams made.\n\nIn 2002, the singer signed a deal with the record label EMI, which is owned by Universal Music Group and also signed the likes of Elton John and Queen.\n\nEMI offered Williams a whopping £80 million for his next six albums, which made it the biggest music deal in British history.\n\nAnd the record titles kept on coming, with Williams setting the record for the most tickets sold in one day for the European leg of his Close Encounters tour back in 2005. It sold 1.6 million tickets in a single day.\n\nAdding that to the 75-million-plus records he sold on a global scale, Robbie Williams overtook his ex-band members when it came to accumulated wealth, becoming richer than even Gary Barlow.\n\nRobbie Williams off the stage\n\nRobbie was smart enough to not just focus on his music career, but take up other avenues to grow his wealth.\n\nThe artist did a voiceover for a character in the animated movie The Magic Roundabout in 2005, but there are no figures on how much this deal was worth.\n\nIn 2018, Williams became a judge on the UK’s X Factor beside his wife Ayda Field, an American actress. Reports state the deal was worth around £10 million. However, after one season, Williams decided to quit the judging panel.\n\nAnd we can’t forget Williams’ immense property portfolio. He sold his Beverly Hills mansion in 2021 to artist Drake, which was reportedly worth £38.2 million at the time. Williams and his wife now own another home in Beverly Hills, worth a reported £38.9 million.\n\nThe singer also sold two other properties in 2021 – his £6.75 million home in Wiltshire and his £24 million property in Switzerland. In 2014, Williams bought a house in West London, which is reportedly worth £17.5million."
