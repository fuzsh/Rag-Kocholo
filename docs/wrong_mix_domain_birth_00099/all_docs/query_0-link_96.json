        "text": "Congratulations are in order for X-Factor judge couple Robbie Williams and Ayda Field, who have announced the birth of their third child.\n\nThe surprise announcement came by way of Field’s Instagram on Friday morning, where she introduced their daughter Colette (Coco) Josephine Williams, who is their biological child born via surrogate.\n\nThe married couple of eight years are already parents to daughter Teddy, five, and three-year-old son, Charlie.\n\nWilliams and Field will be in the spotlight every Saturday night for the next few months, thanks to their new roles as judges on The X Factor alongside Simon Cowell and Louis Tomlinson. We take a look back at their love story over the years.\n\nThey met at the ‘right time’ but things were not smooth sailing at the start\n\nAyda, who gained fame by starring in US soap Days of Our Lives, and Williams (of course, of Take That and solo fame) began dating in 2006 after being set up on a blind date through mutual friends.\n\nThe actress, 39, later said on Loose Women she was grateful she didn’t meet her 44-year-old husband when they were both in their twenties because “he would have been off his face, he would have been cheating… he would have ruined it and we wouldn’t be married with kids and really happy. We would have liked each other but he would have done something daft and messed it up”.\n\nHowever, the origins of their relationship were rocky with Robbie admitting he was not looking for marriage or children at the time. The couple jointly appeared on Loose Women in 2016 where Ayda revealed Robbie “dumped” her three times before finally settling down. According to Robbie’s memoir Reveal, he was also struggling with drug addiction in the early days of their relationship but credits his wife for sticking around and nursing him back to health and sobriety.\n\nRobbie’s first proposal was a ‘joke’\n\nIn 2009, the couple appeared on Australian radio where, after a radio host told him Sydney had a reputation for celebrity proposals, Robbie asked Ayda if she minded “being betrothed ‘til the end of time”, Ayda responded by saying she would love to. The ‘Angles’ singer’s spokesperson said it was a joke but then his mother, Jan, told Radio 5 Live the couple were indeed planning to get hitched. Robbie again then denied the engagement speculation, writing on his website: “Hey all. We are not engaged. Rob” the BBC reported at the time.\n\nThe couple got engaged for real a month or so later. In August, Robbie revealed the sweet way he proposed to his wife on Instagram: “Every time I used to think of Ayda and pull a card from a deck it would always be a queen, so I took her to the place that I first laid my eyes on her and gave her four queens. Each card said one word each. Will… You… Marry… Me?”\n\nThe couple were married in August 2010 at a private ceremony at Williams’ mansion in Beverly Hills, Los Angeles where Williams’s long-time friend Jonathan Wilkes served as best man.\n\nThe couple have worked together before\n\nThe X-Factor won’t be the first time the couple have mixed business with pleasure. As an actress, Ayda has starred in Robbie’s music videos including ‘Bodies’ in 2010 where she joins Robbie for a car ride through dessert and, more recently, his 2017 single ‘Mixed Signals’.\n\nSpeaking about working together this year on The X Factor – where, of course, they will also be rivals given the nature of the competition – Ayda said: “The fact I get to work with Rob and against him is fantastic.” Robbie said: “Ayda is my rock, she’s looked after me through thick and thin.”\n\nThey can be quite candid at times…\n\nThough their LA nuptials may have been hidden away from the cameras, the couple now appear to give more insight into their relationship to their fans. Ayda regularly shares tales about Robbie on Loose Women including him having gone through his 40-odd year life having not visited a supermarket or knowing what a whole cucumber looked like until recently.\n\nOn the other hand, Robbie famously filmed and live blogged Ayda in labour during the birth of their second child, Charlie, sharing videos to Twitter of him dancing and trying to entertain his - most probably - pained and tired wife as she prepared for childbirth.\n\nThey’ve opened up about family life\n\nRobbie has publicly praised both Ayda and his (now, three) children for keeping him on the straight and narrow. In 2016, he told BBC Radio 2 he is no longer likely to “fall off the rails” now he is a family man.\n\n“I was trying to fill in all the blanks that were in my soul [before Ayda and the children] and that didn’t make sense. I got to the top of the mountain and it was like, ‘Ow, I’m still in pain,’” he told Chris Evans. “Then the wife came, then the kids came, and now it all makes sense… because souls are depending on me. My wife depends on me, my kids depend on me. I haven’t got the excuses to fall off the rails, to maybe not turn up to this interview, to watch what I’m saying. It’s a blessing.”"
