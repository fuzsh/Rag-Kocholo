        "text": "With an estimated 47 rooms, Robbie bought the house for £17.5 million in 2013 but soon came into conflict with his neighbour Jimmy Page when he tried to get planning permission for an underground swimming pool.\n\nThe Led Zeppelin musician was worried that Robbie’s plans for the building works would damage the structural integrity of his own house – a castle-like mansion next door.\n\nHowever, after a five year battle, Robbie was finally granted permission to build his dream pool extension in 2018.\n\nThe average house price in Kensington currently sits at £2.76million, according to Rightmove.\n\nThe majority of sales in Kensington during the last year were flats, selling for an average price of £1.97million.\n\nREAD MORE: Ceiling mistakes that make rooms look ‘very dated and unappealing’\n\nTerraced properties sold for an average of £4.88million with semi-detached properties fetching £11.97million.\n\nRobbie also owns a second lavish property in Switzerland worth a whopping £24million.\n\nRobbie purchased his home in Zurich with wife Ayda in 2021 to have a place to relocate during the Covid pandemic.\n\nThe former Take That singer previously owned a home in Los Angeles.\n\nHowever, he sold his Beverly Hills home to rapper DJ Khaled."
