        "text": "Robbie drove Diamond Reo semi-trucks to haul lumber to Canada for his father’s business “Wiliams Lumber” and then later worked for Penn-Dot as a snow plow driver. Appreciating all genres of music, but favoring Rock ‘n’ Roll, he started out as a drummer, but ended up becoming quite the singer. Robbie delighted regional audiences singing classic oldies but goodies in two Warren County bands, “Taylor Made” and “Jack the Dog.” He was even hired by the “Three Dog Night” lead singer’s wife to sing for the famous lead’s birthday.\n\nRobbie was a natural-born storyteller, and his witty sense of humor charmed and entertained many friends and his large family. Spending time golfing in Spring Creek and lounging with his rottweilers were favorite pastimes, as was following his favorite NFL team, the Tennessee Titans. Living on River Road Thompson Island for over twenty years, Robbie was fond of feeding the orioles with grape jelly-filled oranges, and he savored the herons and eagles flying over the Allegheny River in his backyard.\n\nRobbie was deeply loved and will be profoundly missed by his large family. Left to cherish his memory are his son, Carey (Amy) Williams of Greensburg, daughter, Cassandra (Mario) Behm of Sarasota, FL and grandchildren, Virgil and Emma Bozza, Leah, Dash, Amelia, and Jack Williams. Also surviving are his twin sister and womb-mate, Roxanne Mace of Youngsville, sisters Callie Williams of Marienville, Toni (David) Gruber of Macedon, NY, Terry (Bill) Gordon of Warren, Jamie Wilson of Bradenton, FL, and brother Scott Wilson of Youngsville, in addition to aunts, uncles, nieces, nephews, and cousins.\n\nRobbie was preceded in death by his parents, brother Dewey Williams and Tobias “Toby” Wilson.\n\nA Celebration of Life will be held at the American Legion Post 658 in Youngsville on Saturday June 8th, 2024 from 1 to 4 PM. Robbie’s family will be glad to host family and friends who would like to share stories about Robbie at that time."
