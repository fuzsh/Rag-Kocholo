        "text": "Robbie Williams says he has been newly diagnosed with ‘Highly Sensitive Person’ disorder.\n\nThe former Take That singer, 49, who spent years addicted to food and drugs before he got sober, said he can add ‘HSP’ to the litany of mental health issues he battles every day.\n\nHe told The Times about the list of conditions he suffers: “Oh, I’ve got them all. Dyspraxia, dyslexia, ADHD, neurodiversity, body dysmorphia, hypervigilance.”\n\nRobbie, who has four children with his wife Ayda Field, 44, added: “There’s a new one that I acquired recently: HSP. Highly sensitive person.”\n\nThe singer said he also suffered post-traumatic stress disorder, and went on: “Obviously I have an addictive personality. I haven’t got narcissistic personality disorder or split personality disorder, though.\n\n“I looked at them last week and, obviously, I chose all the worst options. So, if I did have it, I would proudly tell you. But I am collecting them all, like Scout badges.”\n\nExperts have defined a ‘highly sensitive person’ as a “neurodivergent individual” who is “thought to have an increased or deeper central nervous system sensitivity to physical, emotional, or social stimuli”.\n\nSome refer to it as having SPS – Sensory Processing Sensitivity.\n\nFrom 2006 to 2009, Robbie battled agoraphobia that left him housebound for three years.\n\nHe has previously revealed he went into rehab in 2007 after taking speed, acid, heroin, cocaine and “heart-stopping” amounts of prescription drugs.\n\nRobbie added to The Times about how he was overwhelmed with fame in the early days of Take That: “When I joined (the band) I was 16 – it was insane. I was the centre of the pop culture world.\n\n“I felt like I was giving more and more of myself away to the point where you don't recognise yourself any more.\n\n“Being in the spotlight you can’t trust anybody. I was having a nervous, mental breakdown in front of thousands of people.\n\n“The thing that would destroy me has also made me successful. Touch the fire, push when it says pull and see if I can live. I don’t know how easy it is for people to get to know me.”"
