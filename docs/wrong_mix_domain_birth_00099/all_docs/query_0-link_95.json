So it pains me to say this, its not about him as an ex-player.\n\n\"I just don’t think the A-League should be a breeding ground for foreign coaches.\n\n\"If we’re going to develop coaches in the A-league, I think they should be local coaches.\n\n“They should come here with an established CV of success to make a difference to our league. And I just think we’ve got so many coaches in this country and so few opportunities that I don’t think it should be a development stop for young coaches who haven’t proven themselves yet.”\n\nSubscribe to Independent Premium to bookmark this article\n\nWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?
