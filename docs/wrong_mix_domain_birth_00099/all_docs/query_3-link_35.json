        "text": "CHARLOTTE, N.C. â€“ A record total of 339 Wake Forest student-athletes have earned spots on the 2023-24 Atlantic Coast Conference Honor Roll, announced Friday by the conference office.\n\nThis is the highest mark in Wake Forest history and marks the fifth consecutive year that the Demon Deacons have landed more than 280 student-athletes on the ACC Academic Honor Roll. Overall, 339 student-athletes represent 70 percent of the all Demon Deacon student-athletes.\n\nThis is the fifth consecutive year that over 50 percent of the student-athletes have landed on the list.\n\n\"I am very proud of our student-athletes and their ability to balance academics and athletics,\" Jane Caldwell, Sr. Associate AD, Student-Athlete Services and Assistant to the Dean said. \"I would also like to extend my gratitude for my colleagues and our professors for their hard work in assisting our entire student body. Our student-athletes have represented our University and the Athletic Department with integrity and their hard work is an inspiration to us all.\"\n\nThe honor roll consists of student-athletes who participated in a varsity-level sport and registered a grade point average of 3.0 or better for the full academic year.\n\nThe Demon Deacon football team led the way with 98 honorees, a program record. They were followed by track & field with 59 combined.\n\nOf the 339 honorees, a record 213 Wake Forest student-athletes earned ACC All-Academic honors multiple times during their time on campus. This includes 85 student-athletes that have earned this distinction for the second time, 61 who were on the list for the third time and a record 48 who were four-year honorees.\n\nAlso included amongst the 213 multi-time honorees were Katrina Andreassen of Track & Field, Nat Friedman of Field Hockey, Caroline Garrett of Track & Field, Devonte Gordon of Football, Robbie Grace of Track & Field, Mitch Griffis of Football, Kaia Harrison of Women's Basketball, Jaylen Hudson of Football, Chase Jones of Football, Michael Kern of Football, Rachel Kuehn of Women's Golf, Taylor Morin of Football, Madeline Rehm of Track & Field, Alexandria Scruggs of Women's Basketball, Daniel Sheedy of Men's Golf and Matthew Thomson of Men's Tennis.\n\nAndreassen, Friedman, Garrett, Gordon, Grace, Griffis, Harrison, Hudson, Jones, Kern, Kuehn, Morin, Rehm, Scruggs, Sheedy and Thomson all earned their fifth distinction on the list. This marks the most fifth-year honorees in Wake Forest history and the fourth time there have been multiple in the same year.\n\nAnna Bush of Track and Field became the first female student-athlete to earn the honor for a sixth time while Michael Jurgens of Football earned a record-breaking seventh honor.\n\nWake Forest ACC Academic Honor Roll Recipients\n\nKylie Adams 4 Volleyball\n\nCollin Adams
