        "text": "ROBBIE Williams is best known for his performing but he also has a passion for football.\n\nDespite living in the US, he travels back to the UK each year to take part in Soccer Aid for charity.\n\nWhich football team does Robbie Williams support?\n\nRobbie Williams is a lifelong fan of his hometown team, Port Vale.\n\nThe singer grew up in Stoke-on-Trent and has remained loyal to the local area.\n\nHowever on August 28, 2023, Williams posted a video of himself confessing to be a \"Spurs fan now\".\n\nTaking to Instagram, he shared a clip of himself belting out his hit song Angels, but with the Tottenham fans’ Ange Postecoglou lyrics.\n\nHe sang: “And through it all, we’re playing the way we want to.\n\n“Big Ange Postecoglou, whether I’m right or wrong.\n\n“You can keep your Pochettino, Conte and Mourinho, and even Christian Gross.\n\n“‘Cause everywhere we go, I’m loving Big Ange instead.”\n\nHe then added: “Guess I’m a Spurs fan now then.”\n\nWhat has Robbie Williams said about football?\n\nSince his rise to fame Robbie has always been very vocal about his love of Port Vale, because it is where he grew up.\n\nHe famously told fans in 2003: \"The papers can talk about my personal life or whatever — but don’t mess with me and the Vale.”\n\nIn an interview with Copa90 Football in December 2019, Robbie said: \"I'm trying to think when football became part of my life... it's never not been part of my life.\"\n\nHe added: \"It's been the one consistent thing, apart from my nearest and dearest, that has stayed with me as a passion for the whole of my life.\"\n\nHe added: \"I only got into music because I was not good enough at football.\n\n\"The original dream was to be a footballer, but that was never going to happen, because I didn't have the talent\"\n\nWhen I was younger I was in the Railway Paddock and I used to dream about sitting in the chairman’s box.\n\nRobbie Williams\n\nRobbie said he fell in love with Manchester United when he was a child but nobody was going to take him there.\n\nSpeaking when he was 29-years-old, Robbie told The Sentinel: \"The truth is I’ve been a Port Vale fan all my life.\n\n\"When I was younger I was in the Railway Paddock and I used to dream about sitting in the chairman’s box.\"\n\nIn 2006 the singer stumped up some cash to bail Port Vale out of trouble.\n\nWilliams became the majority shareholder of the club which cost him £250,000.\n\nSpeaking to BBC Radio Stoke in June 2023, just before he performed a concert at Vale Park, he again talked about how much the club and the local town meant to him.\n\nThe singer said: \"I am just wondering what it's going to feel like for the person that used to be Robert, and now is Robbie, coming back to do this in a stadium I once sat in.\n\n\"I really don't know how that's going to feel.\n\n\"I wonder if I am going to cry, I wonder if I'm going to be non-emotional, I really wonder what's going to go on, I really won't know until I get there.\"\n\nWhen is Soccer Aid 2024?\n\nRobbie will once again be taking part in Soccer Aid 2024.\n\nHe will be a co-manager alongside Frank Lampard and Harry Redknapp.\n\nThe annual match will take place on Sunday, June 9, 2024.\n\nKick-off has not been confirmed but in previous years it has been at 7.30pm.\n\nSoccer Aid will once again be shown live for free on ITV1 and STV.\n\nThe match was held at the London Stadium last year but this year will be at Stamford Bridge."
