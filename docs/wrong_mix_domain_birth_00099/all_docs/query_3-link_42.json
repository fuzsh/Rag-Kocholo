        "text": "I'm a long time Robbie fan. It was honestly a **** documentary, IMO. Fluff piece.\n\nThey didn't even MENTION the entire phase with the big band albums and tours...they took four hours and they were in 2009 Trevor Horn produced record at like 3:45...he's since reunited with Guy Chambers to make several new albums (in full and part)...that SEEMS like that was kind of a story that should be in there. I'm not the HUGEST fan, but I feel like he's made at least 4 or 5 whole albums since that one...there seemed to be a LOT of years missing in the early 00s that they basically just showed him and Geri palling around on vacation. My understanding is he's had ongoing drug/alcohol struggles--they really put it off like he was a mess in the late 90s and went to rehab...that seemed curated. We didn't even get the story of Elton John telling him how he had to go to rehab...they covered the Take That reunion a bit, but left off that he also dueted with Gary...and not talking TO Gary or Guy in the present? Ehh...\n\nAgain--much of this would maybe you would write off as \"less prime Robbie\" for a 1.5hr doc or a 40min MTV piece...but, this was 4 hrs long...\n\nWell, it wasn't that sort of documentary. No attempt at a balanced history and a whole load of confabulation required to tell the story as Robbie himself sees it. They cut the part about Swing While You're Winning because it doesn't \"fit\" the narrative in his head, though to be honest he really initiated that fashion (in the UK at least) so you'd have thought he was proud of it. As I understood it at the time, he and Guy broke off the creative partnership because Guy wanted to work with other artists: no sign of that in the documentary, though it's very consistent with the story of Robbie the jealous narcissist.\n\nTo answer o/p it's impossible to overstate Robbie's success in the UK: at one point he was the biggest thing in pop music, and he largely rehabilitated pop, paving the way for the 1980s revival. I'm not in the least ashamed to say that I think the first few albums are pretty excellent, and he has songs that stand up to this day.\n\nOn the other hand, he's massively unlikeable and always has been. I'm only half way through the documentary and it's not an easy watch because he never seems to stop whining.\n\nThe doc is largely focused on his mental illnesses and how they intersected with his fame. In particular how press bullying exacerbated his fragile mental state, and how his mental breakdown affected his ability to perform.\n\nSome people consider famous and successful people who talk about their mental illness to be ‘whining’; others understand that mental illness can affect anyone, exactly the same way cancer can, and are interested in seeing how it impacts people in the public eye.\n\nI've got people in my life who live semi-permanently on anti-depressants; one woman in particular who has, as far as I know, never done anything to bring depression upon herself. That's mental illness.\n\nRobbie Williams didn't get an education, became a star at 16 and a superstar by twenty. That's the Faustian pact. Now we can say he was a narcissist and \"diagnose\" his personality disorder (poor Robbie) but no one pities a star when they're living the life. So he did everything he could to unbalance his brain chemistry with drink, drugs and eventually prescription steroids. So now we can \"diagnose\" his addictive personality (poor Robbie). So his career hit a downturn, and now it isn't \"look at me, I'm living the life\" any more. Now it's \"forgive me for being so mean to Guy Chambers and Gary Barlow ... that wasn't me it was a mental illness. I'm willing to talk about it if Netflix pays me enough money.\"\n\nOrdinary people get mental illnesses and, sure, a star could suffer from Bipolar disorder, except that the people with Bipolar disorder generally can't hold things together long enough to become stars unless they're on medication and if they're on medication they generally don't have the type of personality that makes someone a star. I've got every sympathy for people with genuine mental illness.\n\nRobbie wasn't born into depression: it wasn't chronic depression. It was reactive depression: a personality collapse brought on by success, drugs and an ego that fed on itself until there was nothing left to feed on. To me it's an insult to people who actually suffer from mental illness to use the same terminology about their predicament as you would about people voluntarily reliving the Icarus morality tale.\n\nYou’re wrong - as in, factually incorrect. Robbie Williams was diagnosed with clinical depression in the early 2000s. He has been on anti-depressants since then. We know this because he has literally talked about the brand and the dosage in the past - in the early 2000s it was Effexor, in 2016 he was switched to Brintellix. He also uses anti-anxiety medication, and of course he has ADHD. That one would be obvious from his behaviour over the years, but in case it needs saying, it is very common for people with ADHD to also have anxiety and depression - they are often related conditions.\n\nRobbie has mentioned a few times that there’s a family history of mental illness and he is absolutely sure that he would have been affected by it even if he had been a bin man. Obviously he is not going to go into a huge amount of detail about that but he has alluded to his mother having been unwell at times, and his sister.\n\nAlso: you are dead wrong about people with mental illness not having the sort of personality that makes someone a star. The music industry is littered with stars who have mental health problems. In fact research shows mental health problems are 3 times more likely among musicians than the general population:\n\nhttps://www.westminster.ac.uk/news/...anxiety-or-depression-than-the-general-public\n\nIt is extremely common for people who suffer from mental illness to use alcohol and drugs, whether or not they are famous or in the music industry. The mental illness is not caused by the drink and drugs - substance abuse is a reaction to it.\n\nOh, and Robbie’s not a narcissist. He very obviously does not meet the criteria for that - a narcissist cannot bear to be seen in anything other than a good light. They definitely do not allow themselves to be seen in moments of crisis and disarray, or admit to having had panic attacks and struggling to cope. Narcissists can’t bear to face up to their mistakes and bad behaviour, which Robbie does throughout the doc. Nor can they bear to hand control over to someone else.\n\nAlso, I’ve got to say - as someone who is a fan and knows far too much about the stuff that went down with Gary Barlow and Guy Chambers - the doc is extremely kind to them.\n\nIt does not go into any of their flaws and ego-driven behaviour.\n\nGary B in has admitted to being ‘unbearable’ to the rest of the band in the 90s and having to do a lot of apologising to people when they reunited. There are reasons why people were not sympathetic towards him in the late-90s when he was dropped - he burnt a lot of bridges. He says now that he *needed* to fail and that if hadn’t he would not have ever got married and had kids and be enjoying the great life he has now.\n\nGuy also says that he and Robbie have ended up in a far healthier place post-split. That it was inevitably going to burn out because of the intensity and the pace of the work, that he was drinking too much and smoking too much weed, that he was immature and didn’t know how to communicate properly. He did lots of silly things as they were trying to salvage the relationship - and they really did try and salvage it. He turned up to meetings that were meant to be for him and Robbie to talk things through personally with his manager and his lawyer, he demanded a huge amount of money, he refused to promote Come Undone and said he found it shocking, and then when told it was over he phoned the head of EMI just before the big deal was signed to tell him, in what looks like at attempt to scupper it.\n\nBut the doc is not about them, so it doesn’t go into that stuff.\n\nWell, you obviously know a lot more about Robbie and especially his clinical history than I do!\n\nI think I have to take a lot of this on trust, although I will correct you on one point: I never said that people with mental illness did not have the sort of personality that makes someone a star. Indeed, it's obvious that personality extremes of all sorts can be a root or unwanted consequence of star quality. What I said was specifically about bipolar disorder and the medication of that disorder.\n\nAs for the rest, we come at this from a different world-view and are unlikely to agree.\n\nThere are even more massive US Stars who have zero traction in the UK. The majority of country stars could walk on any street without being recognised and struggle to sell a record in any quantity.\n\nI know about it because he has discussed it a lot in various interviews, as far back as the early 2000s. As the doc shows quite clearly in that interview before Slane, people at the time just weren’t interested. They’d ignore what he was telling them because it didn’t suit their preconceptions, or just ask for a different answer so they could ignore the first one. Much like you have done.\n\nBut it’s all there for the finding, you just have to look.\n\nRobbie has never claimed to have bipolar disorder. Kanye West is the only star who has, I think?\n\nYes, our world-views are different. I know about the subject; you are jumping to conclusions about someone you evidently do not like."
