        "text": "This paper examines Hegel's claim that philosophy \" has no other object than God \" as a claim about the essentiality of the idea of God to philosophy. on this idealist interpretation, even atheistic philosophies would presuppose rationally evaluable ideas of God, despite denials of the existence of anything corresponding to those ideas. This interpretation is then applied to Hegel's version of idealism in relation to those of two predecessors, leibniz and Kant. Hegel criticizes the idea of the Christian God present within his predecessors in terms of his own heterodox reading of the Trinity in order to resolve a paradox affecting them – the \" paradox of perspectivism \" .\n\nI argue that Hegel’s Science of Logic is not, as the tradition believes, a metaphysical treatise. Quite to the contrary, it is a highly original theory of semantics. It describes how logic, the categories of which are deposited in language, displays a deep bond with the latter. This entails that logic, rather than being simply concerned with the principles of proof, must also explain the conditions of the possibility of the universe of meaning that we, as linguistic beings, create. More than this, however, it also explains how we, in the very act of giving meaning to the world, place demands for intelligibility that the latter cannot meet. As such, it explains how spirit is driven to break from nature and produce a world of its own, thereby offering us as yet unexcavated resources for comprehending the relationship between first and second nature.\n\nWhat is the place of Hegel's Science of Logic within his System? Whenever we think about Hegel's philosophy three words come immediately to our minds: Logic, Nature, and Spirit, in this order. The Logic is, in this view, the first sphere of the System. This is true however, at least until the moment we read, at the end of the Encyclopedia, that this order constitutes only the first of the three syllogisms of what Hegel calls \" the absolute syllogism. \" Therefore, it seems to be necessary to re-read Hegel's philosophy at the light of his theory of the syllogism, which is the first aim of my paper. My second aim is related to one of the most discussed issues among contemporary Hegelian scholars, namely, the question about how much of a metaphysician Hegel is. Just as it is the case with my first aim, I will approach this question from the point of view of his theory of the syllogism, for, as I will try show, each of the readings regarding this issue could be seen as an exegetical form of one of those aforementioned three syllogisms.\n\nSecond Lecture.
