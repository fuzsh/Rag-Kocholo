        "text": "Peter Geach, who has died aged 97, was a formidable logician and happened to be married to one of the 20th century's leading English-language philosophers, Elizabeth Anscombe.\n\n1916-2014\n\nIn a way this meant he was overshadowed. However, he did have a strong philosophical life of his own, and without the thousands of hours of discussion that Anscombe had with him, her philosophy would not have attained the eminence it did.\n\nGeach always had sharp teeth in an argument and, the harder the opposition, the harder he bit. His father was a philosopher who never took up a paid position and, under his influence, Geach admired in his youth JME McTaggart, the Edwardian Hegelian who espoused most positions that Geach came to reject: atheism, reincarnation, determinism, the unreality of time.\n\nGeach admired the \"irresistible force of reasoning\" that he found in McTaggart.\n\n\"Under God, I owe my very self to McTaggart,\" he once wrote, \"for it was knowledge of his philosophy that kept alight in me a longing for the infinite and eternal that was not to be quenched by the noisy winds of the world.\"\n\nEven after decades, Geach still thought it important to publish an introduction to McTaggart's philosophy, Truth, Love, and Immortality (1979). Geach found his own feet while arguing against his master. Thus, in response to McTaggart's argument that it was impossible to believe in a solitary God, Geach showed how McTaggart's demands for a deity were fulfilled only by the Holy Trinity of orthodox Christianity. In the philosophy of religion, Geach contributed to a better understanding of existence, or the act of being. An important distinction he made was between the ideas \"there is a God\" and \"God is, or lives\". In the latter sense, God is identical with his being. Geach's thinking on this question is touched on in God and the Soul (1969) and Providence and Evil (1977).\n\nIn ethics, Anscombe made a celebrated rejection of a kind of utilitarianism that she named consequentialism.\n\nSince many modern ethicists rejected a divine system of laws, she proposed a system of morals based on virtues. Some of Geach's own ideas on virtue ethics were given in The Virtues (1977), based on his Stanton Lectures of 1973.\n\nGeach's style was described by the philosopher Jenny Teichman as \"deliberately outrageous\". Having sharpened his wits on philosophers as formidable as Hume or Russell, he could seem fiercer than an Old Testament prophet and did not fear to give hard knocks to living philosophers.\n\nGeach was born in London on March 29 1916, the son of George Hender Geach, the principal of a training college in India, and Eleonora Sgonina, the daughter of Polish emigrants.\n\nHe went to live with his Polish grandparents in Cardiff, his mother having separated from his father when he was four.\n\nHe was sent to Llandaff Cathedral School and then Clifton College, before going to Balliol College, Oxford, gaining a first in greats in 1938.\n\nHe spent 1945 to 1951 in philosophical research in Cambridge and the next 15 years at Birmingham University, before being appointed professor of logic at Leeds in 1966, retiring in 1981. From 1971 to 1974, he gave the Stanton Lectures in the philosophy of religion at Cambridge.\n\nThe year 1938 had seen him received into the Catholic Church. It was also the year he met Anscombe, who had independently become a Catholic. Once she had taken her finals, they married, on Boxing Day 1941, and decided she should keep her maiden name. With her, Geach had seven children, three boys and four girls.\n\nAlthough sometimes holding a post elsewhere, the two shuttled between Oxford and Cambridge, where Geach got to know Wittgenstein, who lodged with them (in Oxford) towards the end of his life.\n\nGeach listed his recreations as \"reading stories of detection, mystery and horror; collecting and annotating old bad logic texts\"."
