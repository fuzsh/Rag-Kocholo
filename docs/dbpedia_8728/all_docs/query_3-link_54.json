        "text": "A conference on the topic of “Virginia Woolf among the Philosophers” might well begin, if not end, with a consideration of the philosophers she actually was among. All the philosophers that she knew were from Cambridge, and all but one were associated with a remarkable, secret society. The society was known formally as The Cambridge Conversazione Society, and informally as the Apostles, the brethren, or simply the Society. In her late memoir “A Sketch of the Past” Virginia Woolf includes it among the “invisible presences” impinging on her life. They impinged on her writing as well and need to be recognized in the philosophical interpretation of her work. First, however, it is necessary to say something about these philosophers and their brethren Virginia Woolf was among.\n\nThe one Cambridge philosopher not an Apostle was her father. Not many writers whose fiction and essays attract philosophical interest have had philosophers for fathers. Leslie Stephen, well-known as an agnostic, attempted in his family-centered The Science of Ethics (1882) to reconcile the nineteenth-century ethical philosophies of intuitionism and utilitarianism. The reconciliation was based on a Darwinian notion of evolving duty within that primitive relation that Stephen thought held people together: namely the family. The prominent Cambridge philosopher Henry Sidgwick found, however, that The Science of Ethics had not really reconciled intuitionism with the modified liberal utilitarianism Stephen really favoured. Sidgwick, whom Stephen admired, was known to Virginia Woolf. She probably did not read his famous The Methods of Ethics, but she must have been aware of his efforts on behalf of women’s education at Cambridge (he helped found and continued to support Newnham). I will come back to Sidgwick.\n\n“Read Mill” was Leslie Stephen’s cry at Cambridge, and his daughter had certainly read John Stuart’s autobiography along with his writings on liberty and on the subjection of women. She may have read the conservative critique of On Liberty by her uncle James Fitzjames Stephen (who was an Apostle). But the cry of Virginia Stephen’s Cambridge contemporaries was “Read Moore”. G. E. Moore’s Principia Ethica dismissed evolution as moral concept in Herbert Spencer’s philosophy, and thus in Stephen’s which he does not mention. Even without knowing Moore’s criticism, Virginia would not have found a family-based ethics very satisfactory in theory or practice, though she remained an agnostic and committed to the freethinking and plain speaking that Leslie Stephen proclaimed in the title of a collection of essays.\n\nAmong the philosophers Virginia Woolf actually knew aside from her father, G. E. Moore, the man as well as the thinker, was the most impressive and influential. She read his celebrated Principia Ethica carefully and later came to know him well when he stayed with her and Leonard on various occasions. Principia Ethica is quoted in Virginia’s first novel and a philosopher like Moore is alluded to (under the charming name of Bennett — no first name given) in both The Voyage Out and her next novel, Night and Day. The analytic, common-sense tone of Moore’s philosophy was described by Leonard Woolf as astringent; he thought, as he wrote in his autobiography, that its purifying effect could be found “in the clarity, light, and absence of humbug in Virginia’s literary style” — qualities also to be found among her father’s stylistic aims, it should be noted.\n\nThe influence of G. E. Moore’s epistemology of philosophical realism on Virginia Woolf’s assumptions in her fiction about the nature of consciousness was the subject of a long paper that I wrote some forty years ago — and included in a collection of essays on English literature and British philosophy by various critics. I tried to show there how Moore’s dualistic emphasis on subjective immaterial consciousness and its objective, independent material contents underlie Virginia Woolf’s fictive accounts of perception and what is perceived. Most familiarly this is expressed in To the Lighthouse when Mr. Ramsey’s philosophy is described to the painter Lily Briscoe by his son as “Subject and object and the nature of reality”; and when she says she did not understand, he adds, “Think of the kitchen table […] when you’re not there.” Virginia Woolf’s epistemological dualism is assumed in her novels in different ways — in The Waves, for instance, with its pageant of soliloquising consciousnesses set against the sea of time.\n\nTo the relevance of Moore’s philosophy of sense perception needs to be added the significance of his principles for ethical presuppositions of Virginia Woolf’s work. The character of Moore’s influence has been much discussed by his disciples and others. John Maynard Keynes thought he and his friends adopted Moore’s religion, as he called it, but ignored his morals: “nothing mattered except […] timeless passionate states of contemplation and communions […].” But Leonard Woolf disagreed, insisting their contemporaries were fascinated by questions of right and wrong and argued endlessly about the moral consequences of actions. Others have maintained Moore’s impact was chiefly a matter of personality, but Moore's tough-minded Cambridge followers such as Keynes, Lytton Strachey, and Leonard Woolf cared very much about ideas as well as personalities.\n\nThe ethical principles of Principia Ethica were fundamental to Moore’s influence. These have sometimes been reductively described, under Keynes’s influence, as ideals of personal relationships and aesthetic pleasures. These ideals are fundamental to his moral philosophy, but their significance needs to be understood in the context of a basic ethical distinction that underlies the values not only in Virginia Woolf’s work, but in Leonard’s, as well as in the writings by their friends Keynes, Strachey, E. M. Forster, Desmond MacCarthy, Roger Fry — all Apostles — as well as Clive Bell, who was a devoted follower of Moore.\n\nMoore’s fundamental distinction is expressed in the preface to Principia Ethica. He explains there that he has attempted to distinguish two kinds of questions which moral philosophers claimed to answer but are mostly confused. In Moore’s words, “These two questions may be expressed, the first in the form: What kind of things ought to exist for their own sakes? the second in the form: What kind of actions ought we to perform?” These are questions about ends and about means, about intrinsic and instrumental values, and they reverberate throughout the work of Virginia Woolf’s Bloomsbury friends as well as her own. They are implicit in her fiction and explicit in non-fiction works such as A Room of One’s Own, with its means of £500 and its ends of rooms where women writers can think of things in themselves, or in the introduction to working women’s memoirs where Virginia Woolf wrote of ladies desiring “things that are ends, not things that are means.” Once she said to Vita Sackville-West, for whom Moore was the name of a novelist not a philosopher, that she, Virginia, had been “educated in the old Cambridge School”, and concluded, “My dear Vita, we start at different ends,” meaning “ends” in more than one sense.\n\nDistinguishing ends and means is a common enough practice in ethics, but what made the distinction revelatory for Moore’s followers was his conception of intrinsic value. At the centre of Moore’s ethic, for all its rigorous analytic rationalism, is a notion (derived from Henry Sidgwick) of good that is ultimate, intuitive, and indefinable. With it Moore undermined hedonistic, vitalistic, and evolutionary ethics. Also basic was Moore’s conception (not in Sidgwick) of organic or complex wholes that were not merely the sum of their parts: as wholes their value might be more or less than their value as totalities. Aspects of these concepts of indefinable good and organic wholes are reflected in Virginia Woolf’s fictive moments of vision, as are Moore’s ideal states of mind involving personal relations, aesthetic objects, and the pursuit of truth for its own sake.\n\nThough Moore was the most important philosopher Virginia Woolf was among, his was certainly not the only philosophy she knew. She read Plato in Greek, and perhaps Plotinus, but Platonic influences are not easily disentangled, for they were also central to Moore’s philosophy, as was Kant. Virginia Woolf did not, as far as is known, read Kant but she could hardly have escaped his significance. Moore’s ethical emphasis on things in themselves is Kantian, and Kant’s exposition of disinterestedness in aesthetics was central to Roger Fry’s and Clive Bell’s aesthetics, as Desmond MacCarthy pointed out after the first post-impressionist exhibition. Virginia Woolf also read Montaigne (on whom she wrote) and Rousseau, but not Bergson, as used to be supposed. The closest she may have come to Bergson’s thought would have been through the writings by her sister-in-law before Karen Costelloe Stephen became a psychoanalyst. Later, if not earlier, Virginia read Freud whom the Hogarth Press was publishing. And in the English tradition besides Mill, she may have read Hobbes and Locke, probably Berkeley, and certainly Hume, his empiricism perhaps, his history, and also maybe his remarks on suicide.\n\nAfter G. E. Moore, and closely associated with him initially was the most well-known philosopher Virginia Woolf found herself among was Bertrand Russell, whose significance for Woolf’s work has been well argued by several commentators. It was not Russell the mathematical philosopher — though she knew his collaborator Alfred North Whitehead and his wife — but the author of The Problems of Philosophy and popularizing works of social and moral philosophy that Virginia Woolf was familiar with, including some wartime lectures she attended. As with Moore, but in very different ways, Russell’s personality interested her, as she indicated in her diary in 1924:\n\nThe words were quoted in 1941 by another Apostle writing of Cambridge: “How splendidly these words express our faith!” exclaimed E. M. Forster, who added laughingly, “How unlucky that they should have been written by a woman!” The same year Forster paid his Cambridge memorial tribute to Virginia Woolf in the lecture where, referring again to the light of Cambridge, he cherishes a fantasy that she had taken a degree disguised as Orlando. (Despite the efforts of reformers such as Henry Sidgwick, who died in 1900, women were not granted full Cambridge degrees until 1948.)\n\nAmbivalence then characterizes the Apostles’ visible and invisible presence in Virginia Woolf’s work. On the meanings of reality that they were much concerned with, for example, she was forthright in A Room of One’s Own. She concluded there that young women should “to live in the presence of reality” yet could not justify her belief in this, “for philosophic words, if one has not been educated at a university, are apt to play one false.” So she turns away from philosophical abstractions like those of the Apostles to writers who may live more than others in the presence of a reality that is “very erratic, very undependable” as it fixes and makes permanent random physical events, groups in rooms, casual sayings, stars, omnibuses, shapes — whatever remains “when the skin of the day has been cast into the hedge” . Then comes the peroration which returns to Apostolic values: “Do not dream of influencing other people, I would say if I knew how to make it sound exalted. Think of things in themselves.”\n\nAt the end of the Twenties Virginia Woolf’s interest in the Apostles was renewed when Julian Bell became caught in their web — the image is his aunt’s. By then the topics of conversation in the Society had to do more with political issues, though Julian did have a brief affair with the Apostle Antony Blunt, later renowned as an art critic and — along with Guy Burgess, another contemporary Apostle of Julian’s — as a spy.\n\nBecoming an Apostle, Julian felt, was the most tremendous thing that had happened to him. For Virginia he mixed their “bleak integrity” with his own goodwill, but she felt, as she wrote to him later in China, societies like the Apostles did more harm than good with their jealousies, vanities, and exclusions; it was wrong to draw chalk circles and keep people like Clive outside. Then writing The Years around this time, she set its college scenes not in Cambridge but in the Oxford where her cousin Herbert Fisher was master of a college.\n\nVirginia Woolf’s last published remarks on the Apostles are in her biography of Roger Fry. From a outsider’s view of them at the time as careworn youths discussing the ethics of determinism, she shifts to Fry’s writing his mother of “the priding thing” of being elected to the “very select, very famous and very secret society” (Virginia’s words) for “the discussion of things in general” (Roger’s words). It became the centre of his Cambridge life, as it had for Sidgwick and others. No other election meant as much to him, says his knowledgeable biographer, for the Apostles turned out not to be quite as careworn after all. They talked chiefly of politics and philosophy; art for them was literature with its prophetic messages of Shelley and Whitman, which is why they may have appeared to outsiders as “eyeless, abstract, and austere in their doctrines.” Roger Fry’s aesthetic development from his Cambridge brethren is prefigured in these descriptions.\n\nCambridge and the Apostles remained a standard of value for Virginia Woolf, however. Lives like those of Rebecca West and her husband, she remarked in her diary, were filled with appearances “as the Apostles would say”. And those of Harold Nicolson or Hugh Walpole, while more colourful than those of Cambridge intellectuals, did not command her respect the way Moore did, as she noted in “Sketch of the Past”. And it was in “Sketch of the Past”, where she had referred to the Apostles as invisible presences that she also formulated a “philosophy”, as she called it, but without troublesome philosophic words. Her idea was that behind the cotton wool of daily non-being appearance, there is in reality a pattern connecting human beings which is revealed in moments of being which can be shocks of ecstasy or desolation. Turning these into words, she deprives them of their power to hurt her by making them real, as she wrote. It is a writer’s philosophy which delights in the creation of Moorean organic or complex wholes out of the fragments of experience.\n\nFragments and wholes, unity and dispersity, are concerns in Virginia Woolf’s final novel — the “un… dis” of Between the Acts."
