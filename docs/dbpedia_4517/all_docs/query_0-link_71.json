        "text": "We rejoice at yesterday's release of four U.S. nationals from imprisonment in Russia, three of whom landed on U.S. soil last night. We applaud the steadfast efforts of the returnees' families who have spent months and years seeking their return from all corners. It's been an honor to play a part in advocating for their release alongside so many individuals, fellow NGOs, employers, pro bono attorneys and media specialists, and of course, the many federal civil servants who ultimately brought them home. While their re-integration may be challenging, we are overjoyed for them and their families. Every homecoming is a miracle. #BringThemHome https://lnkd.in/e2seZAx5\n\nIn our role as advocates for Americans unjustly held captive abroad, returned captives, and their families, our research captures their needs setting them into the context of the evolving international hostage-taking landscape. Please see Diane M Foley's latest op-ed that summarizes victims' perspectives and the Foundation's broader policy recommendations. #BringThemHome https://lnkd.in/eepSW9yC\n\nYesterday, on Capitol Hill, we hosted an event with our partners McCain Institute and New America to highlight the findings of our sixth annual research report, \"Bringing Americans Home\" and its policy recommendations to accelerate progress made in recent years while also working towards deterring and preventing future hostage-taking of Americans abroad. The full report can be found here: https://lnkd.in/ej8jaPnr. We thank Peter Bergen for moderating the event and panelists Pavel Butorin and Jonathan Dekel-Chen - whose loved ones are being held captive, Dustin Stewart - Deputy Special Presidential Envoy for Hostage Affairs, and Cynthia Tselepis L. - the author of our report.\n\nFor the second time in less than a week, Russia has used a phony, secretive \"trial\" to sentence an American journalist, this time, Alsu Kurmasheva to 6.5 years in prison. We condemn Russia’s use of people as bargaining chips. Her detention violates human rights. #FreeAlsu #JournalismIsNotACrime On Wednesday, we will release our annual research (https://lnkd.in/ej8jaPnr) on hostage-taking and wrongful detention. Alsu's spouse, Pavel Butorin will join us on a panel to discuss the report's findings and recommendations including Alsu's case. Register for this Capitol Hill event here: bringingamericanshome.org. American held captive unjustly abroad - we are tracking 46 as of today - must be brought home. #BringThemHome\n\nWe condemn Russia's sham trial of The Wall Street Journal reporter Evan Gershkovich based on false charges that has resulted in this absurd sentence. He is being used for hostage diplomacy and his detention is a violation of human rights. The world should be appalled. #IStandWithEvan #BringThemHome https://lnkd.in/eSAug8bj\n\nWe are proud to continue our innovative partnership with Head Set Immersive. As threats to journalists evolve, it's important that the resources to help protect journalists continue to be cutting edge. We sponsor these sessions to enable freelancers who don't have the resources of a newsroom behind them to get the preparation and simulated in-the-moment decision-making needed to protect themselves while on assignment. #JournalistSafety #Innovation #MoralCourage #PressFreedom\n\nLooking for inspiration? Listen to the latest Simon Sinek “A Bit of Optimism” podcast featuring Diane M Foley. Diane shows us each day what it means to inspire moral courage. She humbly, relentlessly - and ultimately successfully - changed U.S. government policy to prioritize the freedom of Americans held unjustly captive abroad. She met face-to-face with one of the ISIS terrorists who killed her son. Seeking human connection, Diane found compassion, and secured justice. Imagine if we could each approach adversity this way - turning personal tragedies big and small into acts of service for one another. #MoralCourage #BringThemHome #NationalSecurity #ForeignPolicy\n\nSuch an honor to appear with brilliant composer and singer Sting and author Colum McCann to discuss “American Mother” at the Philadelphia Free Library.
