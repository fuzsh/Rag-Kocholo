        "text": "According to Collider, Fifty Shades of Grey director James Foley will direct the prison film Alcatraz. Basil Iwanyk and Gianni Nunnari (John Wick & 300) are producing from a script by Ian Mackenzie Jeffers. The story follows a bank robber as he makes a daring escape from Alcatraz. It’s based on the true story of Frank Morris, one of three men who attempted to escape from Alcatraz in June 1962; to this day, those three men remain on the U.S. Marshals Service’s “most wanted” list."
