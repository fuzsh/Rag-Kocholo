        "text": "A motorbike riding loner rebel on the high school football team wins a date with a cute, rich cheerleader. At the high school dance, her boyfriend's behavior leads to a breakup - opening doors.\n\nFoley's feature debut treads the familiar turf of defiant teenagers, basically a compilation of contrivances and cliches lifted out The Wild One, Rebel Without Cause, and most recently, All the Right Moves.\n\nReunited with his career criminal father, tough teen Brad thinks he's found his ticket to an exciting life of crime, only to find out he's wrong.\n\nPenn and Walken [are] at the top of their forms in roles that give them a lot to work with.\n\nThe life of an uptight tax lawyer turns chaotic when he is asked to escort a young woman newly released from prison, who persuades him to help prove her innocence.\n\nThis patently painful flick marks the first and last time that director James Foley would tackle comedy. And the reasons why are right up there on the screen.\n\nAfter he escapes from a mental hospital, a former boxer works for a widow. When she asks him to get involved in a kidnapping, he has second thoughts.\n\nThis adaptation of David Mamet's play is every bit as compelling and witty as its source material, thanks in large part to a clever script and a bevy of powerhouse actors.\n\nGennaro lives with his ailing grandpa, who sits outside holding tight to his last quarter. But grandpa's not ready to die, he has some unfinished business with a woman from his past and he enlists Gennaro to act as his emissary.\n\nIf King of the Hill couldn't draw patrons despite appearing on tons of 10-best lists, what's a comparably themed small-change remembrance gonna do?\n\nWhen Nicole met handsome, charming, affectionate David, he was everything. It seemed perfect, but soon she sees that David has a darker side. And his adoration turns to obsession, their dream into a nightmare, and her love into fear.\n\nFear has an appealing young cast, but their efforts aren't enough to consistently distract from an increasingly overblown - and illogical - teen stalker story.\n\nA young man fresh out of law school tries to win a reprieve for his racist grandfather who is on death row.\n\n“The Chamber” is not a serious movie about anything, and so when characters are allowed to rant at length about their hatred of African Americans and Jews, repeating the most vile hate clichés, what I get from the screen is not simply dialogue but the broadcasting of dangerous language.\n\nWith the aid from a New York City policeman, a top immigrant cop tries to stop drug-trafficking and corruption by immigrant Chinese Triads, but things get complicated when the Triads try to bribe the policeman.\n\nJake Vig is a consummate grifter about to pull his biggest con yet, one set to avenge his friend's murder. But his last scam backfired, leaving him indebted to a mob boss and his enforcer.\n\nWhile it may not be the best con in town, the movie still manages to entertain with its colorful cast.\n\nA journalist goes undercover to ferret out businessman Harrison Hill as her childhood friend's killer. Posing as one of his temps, she enters into a game of online cat-and-mouse.\n\nDespite the presence of Halle Berry and Bruce Willis, Perfect Stranger is too convoluted to work, and features a twist ending that's irritating and superfluous. It's a techno-thriller without thrills.\n\nWhile Christian wrestles with his inner demons, Anastasia must confront the anger and envy of the women who came before her.\n\nLacking enough chemistry, heat, or narrative friction to satisfy, the limp Fifty Shades Darker wants to be kinky but only serves as its own form of punishment."
