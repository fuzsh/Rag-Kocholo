        "text": "Nearly a decade after journalist James Foley was murdered by Islamic State group militants, his mother, Diane Foley, tells their story in a new book.\n\nJames, who grew up in Wolfeboro, was covering the Syrian Civil War when he was captured and eventually killed.\n\nIn the memoir “American Mother,” Diane works with Irish author Colum McCann to chronicle the aftermath of James’ kidnapping, including her ongoing advocacy for the return of Americans held hostage abroad. She also recounts meeting with one of the men convicted in her son’s murder.\n\nDiane Foley joined NHPR’s Julia Furukawa on All Things Considered to talk about what she’s learned from working on the book, and what she wants readers to take away.\n\nTranscript\n\nCan you tell me about the process of putting this book together? What did you learn as you were working on it?\n\nWhat did I learn? Oh so much. I've learned so much over the ten years because my background was as a family nurse practitioner. I never knew anything about politics, or our hostage policy or the risks journalists take when they're freelancers in conflict zones. I've learned so, so much, and I learned a lot about our judicial system and how hard it was to actually arrest and then extradite the two former British jihadis to the United States for trial. And then I had the opportunity to meet one of them, Alexanda Kotey, and learned a lot about his reasons for all that he did that is putting him in prison for life. But in spite of all the horrific human rights, atrocities, he's a human being who also has lost in the process of hate, of ISIS. So I've learned so much, Julia.\n\nAnd, Diane, for context for our listeners, Alexanda Kotey pled guilty for his role in the death of Jim and three other Americans in 2021. Some may have made a different decision than you and may not have wanted to speak with him. How did you come to that decision to talk to him? What was your thought process like?\n\nTo be honest, Julia, it was not a hard decision because Alexanda was quite different than his colleague who went to full trial that required nearly a month in April of 2022. Alexanda Kotey pleaded guilty to all eight counts within a few months of his move to Virginia, and in addition, he offered to meet with victims. So I could feel an openness in him. Jim wanted us to be able to understand those who are vulnerable to propaganda, like ISIS among young people like Alexanda Kotey. So I knew Jim would have gone to see him, that Jim would have wanted me to hear him out. And also as a mom, I wanted to share with him who Jim was, you know, so I just wanted to try to bridge that gap.\n\nWhat do you hope readers gain from reading this book and learning about your story?"
