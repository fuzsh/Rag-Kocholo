        "text": "Yesterday I got to hang out with Nova Perth’s breakfast team and talk about my favourite part of the year, Children’s Book Week! I also got to chat a bit about the making of Secret Agent Mole, and read Stellarphant aloud on air (with running commentary from the team – you won’t find that in an audiobook).\n\nThanks heaps for having me in the studio, Nathan, Nat and Shaun! And huge thanks to Chasze the tradie for helping me out when I’d left my phone at home. Champion.\n\nClick the link below to listen to the chat.\n\nINTERVIEW\n\nBook Week 2023 (mp3 file)\n\nNova 93.7 Perth Breakfast show\n\nwith Nathan, Nat and Shaun\n\nBack in May I had the great privilege of yarning with my bud Brenton McKenna for ALIA Graphic Novels and Comics. ⁠\n\n⁠\n\nBrenton and I interviewed each other about our newest graphic novels (including Secret Agent Mole: Goldfish-Finger), our processes and our inspirations. Brenton is the creator of the Ubby’s Underdogs trilogy and has a new series out called Hairy Holes, all about some hairy creatures that live in the Australian outback. It’s hilarious! ⁠\n\nYou can catch our chat here on YouTube.\n\nP.S. ALIA has a massive treasure trove of videos, all about graphic novels and comics. Make sure you check it out!\n\nStuck for a CBCA Book Week costume idea? Here’s how to dress up as Max Mole, Helena Hippo or Bug from my series, Secret Agent Mole.\n\nAnd scroll down for free printable masks of Max, Helena and Bug!\n\nPrintable masks\n\nYou can download all three of these masks in one handy pdf.\n\nTips:\n\nEach is designed to print out at A4 paper size; they’ll work best of printed or glued onto thick card.\n\nCut out the black eyeholes, and cut around the thin outline on the outside edge of the mask.\n\nAdd colour if you wish.\n\nDon’t forget to add string or a paper loop so that you can attach the mask to your face.\n\nAnd don’t forget some antennae for Bug – you could use thin strips of paper or card, or pipe cleaners.\n\nThe Awesome Arts Festival is almost here again!\n\nIt’s a fantastic kids’ art festival right here in my hometown of Perth, featuring theatre, dance, visual arts and more. It’s a brilliant way to keep the kids occupied in the September/October school holidays.\n\nAs always, I’m presenting some cartooning and comics workshops for young’uns.\n\nDetails below!\n\nSEPT 23, 26 – Super Secret Short Story Comic Strips (for kids)\n\nJoin me for hands-on writing and drawing workshops making comic strip stories. Your subject – secret agents!\n\nI’ll show you how to draw Max Mole and other characters from my new graphic novel series Secret Agent Mole, and guide you in creating your own short story comics. Invent villains, devise gadgets, and draw dramatic battles. Who will win in your comic? You decide.\n\nThere will be three workshops in two different locations – details below.\n\nKELMSCOTT WORKSHOPS (ARMADALE HUB)\n\nDATE: Saturday 23 September\n\nWHEN: 10am-10:45am OR 2pm-2:45pm\n\nWHERE: Kelmscott Hall, Bilya (River Room), 60 River Road Kelmscott\n\nAGES: 6yo +\n\nTICKETS: On sale now!\n\nSTATE LIBRARY WORKSHOP (PERTH)\n\nDATE: Tuesday 26 September\n\nWHEN: 11:30am-12:30pm\n\nWHERE: The Education Room, State Library of Western Australia\n\nAGES: 8-12yo\n\nTICKETS: On sale now!\n\nIt’s a writing program and a writers festival all-in-one, and it’s back for another year!\n\nThe 2023 Littlescribe Mini-Writing Festival features Australian Children’s Laureate Gabrielle Wang, past laureate Jackie French, CBCA picture book of the year winner Claire Saxby, best-sellers Jacqueline Harvey and Louise Park, and festival favourites Deb Abela and Oliver Phommavanh. Oh, and me too.\n\nIt’s on from Monday 31st July to Friday 4th August and is fully online, so no matter where your school is (or whether you’re homeschooling), you can join in. There’s sessions for students aged 5-14, covering everything from poetry to picture books, and sports writing to slam poetry.\n\nI’ll be chatting with Tim Harris (we made Toffle Towers together!) about creating and illustrating unique characters, plus joining all the other sessions as an illustrator-in-residence.\n\nProgram below. Full details on the LittleScribe website.\n\nContinue reading “Littlescribe Mini Writing Festival”\n\nI can finally reveal the next instalment in my graphic novel series, Secret Agent Mole! Book 2: The Boar Identity, is scheduled for release September 1st, 2023.\n\nWhen Star Division discovers a magical meteorite with anti-gravity powers, Dr Nude will stop at nothing to get his naked little hands on it – including brainwashing a Star employee! This important mission features a secret mountain base, an exploding rocket and a flying pig with no clothes on. Can Max Mole, Helena Hippo and June Bug stop Dr Nude’s evil plans? I hope so, otherwise we’re all doomed! It’s time to Rock and Mole!\n\nPre-order your copy today!\n\nWritten & illustrated by James Foley\n\n🇦🇺🇳🇿 Australia/NZ edition:\n\nPublished by Scholastic Australia, 1st Sept 2023\n\nISBN: 9781761200168 (paperback)\n\nPsst… There are Book Launches coming up too!\n\nAug 19: Sydney\n\nAug 26: online\n\nSept 2: Freo\n\nFor more details on these events, head to the blog.\n\nIt’s (nearly) time to rock and mole! Make sure you dive into Secret Agent Mole, Book 1: Goldfish-Finger before the release!\n\nI’ve just finished up an awesome weekend at Perth Supanova Comic Con!\n\nI got to see some incredible cosplay, chat with Kevin Eastman (co-creator of the Ninja Turtles!!), catch up with my bud Brenton McKenna, get a hand-delivered fan letter from Super Mario and hang out with the wonderful authors Meg Caddy and Renae Hayward (my gorgeous wife)!\n\nContinue reading “Supanova Comic Con Perth”\n\nI recently spent a packed couple of days at the Sydney Writers Festival Family Day! Here’s a couple of highlights.\n\nA spy infiltrates the Festival…\n\nAs part of a panel on Junior Fiction, Adrian Beck and I had a spy-off. The objective? Blend in and make your way to the stage without being seen, using any means necessary.\n\nThis here hombre was served humble pie as his last meal, with bullets for dessert, as I went up against Serena Geddes, Heath McKenzie and Charmaine Ledden-Lewis in an Illustrator Battle. Congrats to Charmaine (AKA Lead-Pencil Lewis) for being the quickest draw in the inner-west. Special thanks to our excellent MC (and chief cat wrangler) Adrian Beck.\n\nContinue reading “Sydney Writers (and Secret Agents) Festival”"
