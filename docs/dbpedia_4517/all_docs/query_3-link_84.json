        "text": "Clara Mamet’s table at Barbuto wasn’t ready. It was 8 p.m. Wednesday, and Ms. Mamet, the 19-year-old daughter of the playwright David Mamet and the half-sister of the actress Zosia Mamet, was in New York for the Tribeca Film Festival, where her debut film, “Two-Bit Waltz,” would be shown later in the week.\n\n“Let’s go get cigarettes,” she said to her group, which included her 23-year-old boyfriend, Jeff Cohn (who was the film’s camera operator), and Eric Fleischman (the producer).\n\nMs. Mamet headed up 12th Street in the West Village, where she walked past townhouses and apartment buildings. “For one summer, my dad and I lived in one of these apartments. He was working on ‘Phil Spector’ and I was hanging out, being a terrible production assistant. I was so awful at my job.”\n\nShe went inside a D’Agostino on Greenwich Street (“It smells like gravy,” she said), but they didn’t sell smokes there.\n\n“Where are the gas stations in New York?” asked Ms. Mamet, who eventually had better luck at a deli on Eighth Avenue.\n\nTen minutes later, puffing on Natural American Spirits, she and her group ambled back to the restaurant, where a table was soon ready. She ordered her usual (“The chicken? Come on, man! Delicious,” she said) and considered ordering a cocktail, but decided against it.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
