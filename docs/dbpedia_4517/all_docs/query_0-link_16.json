        "text": "(NOTE: this is not the main co-star Jerry Barone, Bevilacqua had an uncredited part. I don't know what he played.)\n\nWAYNE, Pa. (March 29, 2002) - A 13-year-old boy who appeared in movies with Al Pacino and Bruce Willis collapsed and died Wednesday while playing goalie in an indoor soccer game.\n\nDonato Joseph Angelo \"Dan\" Bevilacqua collapsed about 20 minutes into the game in suburban Philadelphia and was taken to a hospital after attempts to resuscitate him failed, police said.\n\nAn investigation was begun to determine the cause of death, but a preliminary autopsy showed Bevilacqua died from a medical condition, not an injury.\n\nBevilacqua had appeared in feature films, including Two Bits, in 1996, with Pacino, and Twelve Monkeys, in 1995, with Willis, Brad Pitt and Madeline Stowe. He also appeared in TV commercials.\n\nBevilacqua was a licensed soccer referee and played on the soccer team at Upper Merion Middle School, where he was a seventh-grader. Recently, he won an essay contest sponsored by a local chapter of the Sons of Italy, of which he was a member.\n\nA funeral Mass is scheduled for Monday in King of Prussia.\n\nWhen the script was presented to director James Foley, he found himself in tears by the final pages. \"After exploring the most vicious, dark side of how men deal with each other, I was really drawn to this story of how two men, a boy and his grandfather, make a really meaningful impact on each other's lives. Eventually, I came to see Two Bits as a companion piece to Glengarry Glen Ross, not in any dramatic sense but in the sense that they each look at opposite sides of human nature, opposite kinds of motivation--the two sides of the coin, really. Both are about being a man--but in Two Bits, what the kid learns from his grandfather prevents him from becoming the kind of men you find in Glengarry Glen Ross.\" The Ritz Online Filmbill.\n\nPacino says the script appealed to him because his own grandfather was one of the most influential people in his life. \"My grandfather, who raised me, and was the most, and um my Grandad died before anything happened to me, any kind of success or whatever happened to me in my career, so I felt a kind of a warmth toward that character.\" (hear a wav - 315k of this comment)\n\nTwo Bits emerged from the intimate memories of acclaimed \"Golden Era\" screenwriter Joseph Stefano, who is himself a native of South Philly. Stefano is best known for his classic screenplays for Hitchcock's Psycho and The Black Orchid and was also the co-producer and author of the popular 1963-64 cult TV series \"The Outer Limits.\" (CNN article)\n\n\"I don't know what it takes to get out of the family mode,\" she says. \"First I am his sister, then I'm his daughter. I don't know what it takes to actually be the romantic figure in his life ... Perhaps I have to be blonde. It could happen.\" (CNN article, the wav of this comment is available there - linked below)"
