        "text": "Itâ€™s Friday! And that means itâ€™s time for Pass the Book Baton. Alphabet Soup features a book creator every Friday who will answer one question before throwing a new question to the next Friday visitor. (Itâ€™s kind of like a book relay in slow motion.)\n\nToday author-illustrator James Foley takes the baton. James Foley is a writer, illustrator and cartoonist. He likes working with pen and ink, pencil, charcoal, watercolour, and digital tools. He has illustrated books by other people, and written and illustrated his own books.\n\nHe has quite a stack of books behind him now.\n\nCheck them out:\n\nHis most recent book is the graphic novel Brobot.\n\nLast week AL Tait posed two questions for James. AL asks:\n\nQ. You started out as an illustrator â€” what made you decide to write In The Lion and Brobot yourself?\n\nA. Iâ€™ve always written and illustrated my own stories; it just worked out that my first book was only as the illustrator. Itâ€™s easier to break into the industry by working with someone more established, as Norman Jorgensen was. Then I got the opportunity to make In The Lion on my own, which was great. Itâ€™s a different experience writing AND illustrating a book yourself, as opposed to illustrating a text written by someone else (as I did with Sigi Cohen for My Dead Bunny) or collaborating with a writer quite closely through the initial process (as I did with Norman Jorgensen for The Last Viking and The Last Viking Returns). Also, when you do the book yourself you get the full royalty â€¦ ðŸ˜‰\n\nQ. As an author-illustrator, do you start with the words for a story or start with the pictures?\n\nI usually start with a bit of both â€” some loose images and a few phrases. I may have a few key scenes playing in my head, but theyâ€™re fragments of what the overall story will eventually become. Then I nut out the character designs and the overall storyline at the same time; these two processes feed off each other. A character design may give you a plot idea, and vice versa. Then when the characters and the storyline seem to have settled, I can get started on thumbnails and storyboards, and then final artwork.\n\nAnd now James Foley passes the baton to the next Friday visitor â€” Deborah Abela. Deborah is the author of many books. Her most recent title is The Stupendously Spectacular Spelling Bee.\n\nJames asks:\n\nDo you find that your characters reflect different aspects of your personality? So the heroic characters might reflect your good side, the villains might reflect your naughty side, the protagonists might share your strengths and weaknesses, etc?\n\nCheck in every Friday for questions and answers from childrenâ€™s authors and illustrators. See you next week!\n\nVisit James Foleyâ€™s website for more information about him and his books. You can also read earlier Alphabet Soup interviews with James here and here.\n\nSave\n\nSave\n\nSave"
