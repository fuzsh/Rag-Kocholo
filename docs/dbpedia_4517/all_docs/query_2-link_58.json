        "text": "NUMBER OF FILMS DIRECTED:10 (feature films).BIOGRAPHY:According to the official site for The Corruptor, New York-born filmmaker James Foley's student films won him notice from Hollywood early on. He made his feature filmmaking debut with 1983's Reckless, starring Aidan Quinn and Daryl Hannah. Foley evaded the proverbial sophomore slump by helming the gritty, fact-based crime drama At Close Range, starring Sean Penn and Christopher Walken. The 1986 film marked Foley's first collaboration with Penn's then-wife, pop star Madonna.He directed Madonna's music video for \"Live to Tell\", the theme song to At Close Range, and also helmed The Material Girl's 1987 turkey, Who's That Girl?, and her music video for \"Papa Don't Preach.\" Foley bounced back with an acclaimed adaptation of Jim Thompson's After Dark, My Sweet, starring Jason Patric, Rachel Ward, and Bruce Dern. He also directed an episode of Twin Peaks before tackling his most ambitious film yet.Glengarry Glen Ross (1992) was based on the Pulitzer Prize-winning play by David Mamet and featured a stellar cast of veteran actors: Al Pacino, Jack Lemmon, Ed Harris, Alan Arkin, Kevin Spacey, and Alec Baldwin. Glengarry remains the high-point of Foley's career. The rest of his films to date – Two Bits, The Chamber, Fear, The Corruptor, and Confidence – have all proven failures, either commercially, critically, or both.MUST-SEE FILM: Glengarry Glen Ross, 1992. This big-screen adaptation of David Mamet's pungent Pulitizer-winning play features top-notch performances by the entire cast (Al Pacino, Jack Lemmon, Alec Baldwin, Ed Harris, Alan Arkin, Kevin Spacey and Jonathan Pryce). An office of desperate real estate salesmen ruthlessly vie for success after being threatened with termination if they don't meet their sales quota. Anxiety and rivalry leads one of them to rob the manager's office of a precious stash of \"leads.\"CAREER HIGHLIGHTS:At Close Range, 1986. This true crime tale follows father-son crooks in rural Pennsylvania. Sean Penn plays Brad Whitewood, Jr., a teenage ne'er-do-well who reconnects with his estranged, infamous father \"Big Brad\" (Christopher Walken) and soon gets caught up in his dad's criminal shenanigans. Penn's real brother Chris plays his simple, (illegitimate?) half-brother Tommy who isn't spared from Big Brad's wrath when the time comes. After his father violently turns on those closest to him, \"Little Brad\" is forced to confront him and ultimately testifies against him in court.The supporting cast includes Mary Stuart Masterson, Crispin Glover, Kiefer Sutherland, and David Strathairn. At Close Range features strong performances from the leads, taut direction from Foley, a sharp script by Nicholas Kazan, and a hit song by Madonna (she was married to Sean Penn back then, remember?).After Dark, My Sweet, 1990. Based on a novel by Jim Thompson, this Neo-Noir follows a brain-damaged ex-boxer (Jason Patric) who escapes from a mental institution only to get pulled into a kidnapping scheme hatched by a femme fatale (Rachel Ward) and an ex-cop (Bruce Dern). MISFIRE:The Chamber, 1996. Based on the novel by John Grisham, The Chamber follows young attorney Adam Hall's (Chris O'Donnell) quest to save his racist, estranged grandfather Sam (Gene Hackman) who is on Death Row for a thirty-old bombing. But is Sam really guilty or is he just protecting the Klan? While it has a powerful premise, The Chamber is a frustrating, muddled work.POP CULTURE:Madonna has worked with James Foley more often than she has with her director-husband Guy Ritchie.QUOTES:On becoming a filmmaker: \"It was like discovering a sixth sense, a sensation I never knew existed. I dropped everything and never looked back.\" (Source: the official site for The Corruptor.)On At Close Range: \"I'd met Sean Penn when I was casting Reckless, and he showed me this script he had never been able to get made. ... Right before Reckless came out I was a hot property and Sean was at the height of his celebrity, so we were able to push through what was obviously a wildly uncommercial project.\" (Source: official site for The Corruptor.) On directing: \"Seriously, if you cast the right friggin' people and they're good actors, it's amazing how little you have to do but stay out of the way.\" (Source: interview with IGN FilmForce.)\"The whole experience of making (Confidence) has been extremely profound for me personally. ... For some reason I just reacted to the script in a visceral sort of way as if it pleasured me and gave me some kind of inner smile that I had not experienced before in any script that I was into directing. The best way I can describe it is that it's as if it cleansed my palette.\"\"I'm always trying to learn from each movie. ... And the most learning I get is right now, talking about it when I'm kind of forced to reflect on something. I realize that I've more and more come to respect the idea of directing actors and making the whole movie, to have it be more and more driven by my unconscious and my viscera rather than my brain. There's something about a very cool experience you can have with actors and directing them where it is, in a way it's non-verbal, it's non-intellectual.\"\"Once you start filming it's such a race. ... You're racing against the sun. You're racing against over-time. It's kind of like kamikaze madness. The cliché is - and it's true, that's why it's a cliché, I guess - is that 90% of the good performance of an actor is that he's been correctly cast. So, once you've done that, no matter what you do during the shooting, it's not gonna change that very much. The character is gonna be who it's gonna be. If it sucks then it's because you got the wrong person.\"FOR FURTHER INFORMATION:Check out the official site for Confidence."
