        "text": "10 years after James Foleyâs death, art exhibition honors his commitment to conflict journalism\n\nAn exhibition of original art dedicated to the memory of American journalist James Foley opens April 3at Northwestern University. In Inescapable Truths: James Foley’s Indelible Legacy, conceptual artist Bradley McCallum draws from Foley’svideo, photos, and writings he filed while reporting on the Libyan and Syrian civil wars of 2011.\n\nThe exhibitionis presented in two parts: at University Library and Dittmar Gallery in Norris University Center. It runs in conjunction with an upcoming symposium about conflict journalismhosted by the MedillSchool of Journalism, Media, Integrated Marketing Communications,marking the tenth year sinceFoley’s videotaped execution in Syria shocked the world.\n\nFor 21 of the artworks on view, visitors can use their own digital devices to activate augmented reality video of Foley’sraw footage, experiencing these conflicts through his eyes.Glimpses of armed rebellion viewed through the paintings are interspersed with two video portraits of Foley’s mother, Diane, in dialogue with Northwestern students, about her cause for hope, her faith, and her advocacy for freelance journalists and the safe return of American hostages held abroad.\n\nInescapable Truths is the culmination of McCallum’s eight-year collaboration with the James W. Foley Legacy Foundation, founded by Diane Foley. This work was followed by McCallum’s 2023 fellowship with the Northwestern Universty Knight Lab, a Medill studio that encourages the use ofemerging technology to push the capabilities of journalism. In fall quarter, McCallum and graduate student Craig Stevens led a Knight Lab course for six Medill undergraduate and graduate students thatprototyped the AR concepts and envisioned the exhibition installation.\n\n“This exhibition is especially timely, as the wars in Ukraine and Gaza continue to unfold and we are reminded of the essential role that journalists serve in reporting on conflicts,” McCallum said. “The title Inescapable Truths is a reference to the undeniability of human suffering and the essential role of journalism to reliably communicate these stories.”\n\nInescapable Truths is presented by the Medill School of Journalism, Media, Integrated Marketing Communications, the Northwestern University Knight Lab, and Northwestern University Libraries, in partnership with the James W. Foley Legacy Foundation and Conjunction Arts. Augmented reality design and production provided by Tactic Studios, powered by 8th Wall. Special funding provided by Lisa and Steve Knight.\n\nViewing hours, symposium, and related programming\n\nFor more information about events, locations, and other visitor resources, click here.\n\nUniversity Library, fourth floor\n\nOn view through June 14\n\n9 a.m. – 6 p.m., Monday – Saturday\n\nDittmar Gallery, Norris University Center\n\nOn view through May 7\n\n10 a.m. – 10 p.m., every day\n\nApril 3 – Opening reception\n\nOpening reception at 4:30 p.m. University Library, fourth floor, followed by a viewing in Dittmar.
