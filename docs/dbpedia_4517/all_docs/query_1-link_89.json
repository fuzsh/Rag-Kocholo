        "text": "In an email to supporters this week, 826 Boston Executive Director Daniel Johnson wrote about James Foley, not just as the journalist who was killed by militants in Syria last month, but as a man who was like a brother to him.\n\n\"Broad-shouldered and smiling, he was wearing a Milwaukee Bucks jersey and high tops, like he'd just come from a three-on-three tournament,\" Johnson wrote about the first time he met Foley — they both ended up in South Phoenix in 1996 after signing up with Teach for America. \"I noticed, to my surprise, that novels lined Jim's dormitory shelves. Jim, I'd learn over time, was a man of delightful contradictions.\"\n\nJohnson was writing to share his decision to publish \"In the Absence of Sparrows,\" a poem he penned during Foley's nearly two years in captivity in Syria.\n\nHe wrote that, in doing so, he intended to \"stamp out the numbing vision of Jim in an orange jumpsuit, kneeling in a desert expanse, his captor clad in black, standing above him.\"\n\nThe serial poem swings in time, from when Foley was in captivity...\n\nWhen did you last see\n\nbirds? The winter sky in Boston\n\nis gray with flu. Newspapers,\n\nsenators, friends, even your mom\n\non Good Morning America—\n\nno one knows where you are.\n\n...to Johnson's apparent memories of earlier times: protesting the 2004 Republican National Convention in New York City, a reckless night on Lake Winnipesaukee in 1991:\n\nWinter solstice, 1991. You turned donuts,\n\ndrinking beers, in a snowy public lot next to the lake.\n\nGirls yelped. You cranked the Pixies louder, cut the lights,\n\nand steered Billy’s grandma’s Chrysler onto the Winnipesaukee ice.\n\nThe moon flamed bright as a county coroner’s light.\n\nYou revved the station wagon’s engine. Billy tied\n\na yellow ski rope off the hitch, flashed a thumbs up,\n\nand you punched the gas—5, 15, 20, 25 miles per hour—\n\ntowing Billy, skating in high-top sneakers,\n\nacross the frozen lake. Chill air filled his lungs.\n\nBilly pumped his fist. You torqued the wheel left.\n\nTriumphant, you honked and flashed the lights.\n\nYou took a swig of Heineken and wheeled\n\nthe wood-paneled station wagon in a wide-arcing turn\n\nto pick up Billy, bloodied but standing. People do reckless things\n\nbut your friends dubbed you the High King of Foolish Shit.\n\nThe nose of Billy’s grandma’s Chrysler broke the ice.\n\nYou jammed it into reverse. Bald tires spinning,\n\nyou flung yourself from the car. In seconds, it was gone.\n\nYou gave Billy’s grandma a potted mum\n\nand a silver balloon. Standing on her screened-in porch,\n\nyou mumbled an apology. What am I supposed to do now?\n\nshe asked. What the hell do I do now?\n\nJohnson wrote in the letter that he didn't think Foley, who is the godfather of Johnson's 1-year-old son, was drawn to war reporting because of the danger or violence. \"Rather, it was peoples' stories, the stories of mechanics, oil workers, mothers, and fathers, people living in extremis, that drew him to Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya, and, ultimately, Syria.\"\n\nThe same thing, Johnson said, he believes drew Foley to that South Phoenix classroom years ago.\n\nRead \"In the Absence of Sparrows\" in its entirety at poems.org.\n\nRelated Coverage:"
