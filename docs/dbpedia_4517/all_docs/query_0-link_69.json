        "text": "The opening title card of the new documentary Jim: The James Foley Story reads: “This film shows images of war recorded by conflict journalists. It does not show the execution of Jim.”\n\nFor many of us, the name James Foley is indelibly attached to one of the most gruesome pieces of propaganda to spread across the Internet in recent memory. Even if you haven’t watched the video of Foley’s beheading released by ISIS in August 2014, you’ve probably seen still images of the abducted journalist wearing an orange jumpsuit and kneeling in front of a masked jihadist. You probably have read accounts of the anti-American diatribe he was compelled to read from a script.\n\nBut the documentary, which won the audience award at Sundance and which will air on HBO on Saturday, hopes to “recontextualize that image,” says first-time director Brian Oakes, Foley’s friend since the first grade, by phone. “I think by telling his story, what he was doing as a journalist, that image becomes a completely different thing. You see there’s a person behind it. For me it was a way to take the image away from its intended purpose and reclaim it for Jim.”\n\nOakes and Foley grew up together in Wolfeboro, New Hampshire, where Foley was one of five kids in a close-knit Catholic clan. Interviews with family and friends paint a portrait of a restless, devout, good-hearted man who couldn’t find meaning in the world of 9-to-5s. After attending Marquette University, Foley tried Teach for America, then taught in the Chicago prison system, but soon enough, he found himself drawn to journalism, conflict journalism in particular, where he felt he could find the stories most in need of telling.\n\nHis first stop was Iraq, where he was embedded with the Indiana National Guard, and then Afghanistan. In Libya, as a freelancer, he was kidnapped and held captive for 44 days by Qaddafi loyalists. To his family’s bewilderment, once freed, Foley decided to return to the front lines. He was working as a freelancer, filing to the Boston-based outlet GlobalPost, when he was abducted by members of a group not yet known as ISIS on Thanksgiving Day of 2012, in a taxi near the Syrian-Turkish border.\n\nHe spent almost two years in captivity, at times in the company of 20 or so other European, British, and American journalists and aid workers. The film is most fascinating in its interviews with Foley’s now-freed fellow captives—Europeans whose governments, unlike the U.S., paid ransoms for their release—who describe day-to-day life in their fetid prison. The prisoners cobbled together a bootleg approximation of the game Risk, from scraps of paper and date pits. For Christmas, they gifted each other compliments. Foley and another man traded massages. “Can you teach me how to give a real nice massage so when I get out and meet a woman I can really impress her?” Foley, who turned 40 in captivity, allegedly asked.\n\nThe film dances a bit around a known but somewhat controversial fact: In captivity, Foley converted to Islam. “What James used to say to me was, for him, God is the same,” remembered one prisoner. Another recalled Foley explaining: “Religion is like a language. If I tell you ‘I love you’ in French or in Japanese, what’s the difference? The importance is the feeling. The importance is the love.”\n\nA Danish prisoner released shortly before Foley’s execution emerged with a letter he’d memorized, that Foley had written to his own family. Oakes calls the letter his friend’s “true last words,” and uses them as the film’s last words as well. “I feel you all especially when I pray,” Foley wrote. “I really feel I can touch you, even in this darkness, when I pray.”\n\nTell me about your relationship with Jim.\n\nWe grew up in a small New Hampshire town called Wolfeboro. It was a very rural upbringing. We’d known each other since we were about 7 years old.\n\nJimmy was definitely much more of a transient than I was. I settled down and became a designer, got into film, settled into New York City. Jim didn’t necessarily want to be pinned down. He was out in Arizona for Teach for America, and then out in Chicago, teaching in the prison system for a while, then he was at UMass for writing, and Medill School of Journalism at Northwestern. He had friends all over the place. He’d come through New York and we’d spend the day together. Whenever you had the opportunity to catch him, it was always great because you knew he’d be off to the next thing.\n\nWhat did you make of him becoming a conflict journalist?\n\nI was so happy for him, because I think in journalism he finally found a career that he was happy with. He was making a difference. He loved people, he loved writing. He was actually doing a lot of fiction writing early on, based on his experiences with people, underdog stories. I think he finally realized, Why am I writing fiction when I could be writing about the real thing? There are people out there that need their stories told. That’s when he found conflict journalism. When he first went off to Afghanistan with the Indiana National Guard, he was writing. He had a blog called the World of Troubles. We would keep track of where he was. And it was great. It was really a good fit for him.\n\nDid you worry about him?\n\nI think we were worried more after he had been captured in Libya. When he got out, I was a little more skeptical. Maybe I was naive at first about what was going on over there. But he wasn’t reckless. He took precautions, prepared himself with training courses. He was with other journalists. I was worried about him, of course, but I was never against what he was doing. It felt really important.\n\nIn the film his family talked about not really knowing him as an adult, learning about him through his friends. Did you feel that way, making this film?\n\nJim was always the guy that wanted to find out what you were doing. He never really wanted to talk about himself. That’s what made him a really good journalist. He was always hard to get information out of.\n\nBut as far as what I learned: The movie is two halves. The first half is what I already knew about Jim. The second half is in captivity, what I discovered. None of us knew what had happened in those two years in captivity. Talking with the former hostages, four in the movie, four others as well, it was cathartic. Finding out what was going on in that cell, the interactions that Jim had with these guys, none of it surprised me. He was always looking out for other people. He was really strong. He was just a physically strong guy.\n\nDid you feel there were misperceptions about Jim that you wanted to redress?\n\nThat image of him that the world got to know, him in the orange jumpsuit, what I wanted to do with the film was recontextualize that image. James Foley has become a symbol of many things. People have used that image for political agenda, to sensationalize terrorism. He was mentioned in an episode of Homeland. I felt a responsibility because I knew him. I was very protective of my friend.\n\nYou don’t play the video of Jim’s death in the film. Have you watched it?\n\nThere are two videos, actually, an unedited version and an edited version. I have not watched the unedited version. I didn’t watch the edited version for a long time, until I had to start dealing with it for the film. It’s still very surreal to me. It’s not that it’s not important. I don’t focus on that video very much because I don’t consider that Jim’s personality. It’s a propaganda tool, a recruitment video that was scripted. He was forced to say those things. I don’t really take mind of it at this point. The letter to me is more important because those are his true last words.\n\nHow did you feel when you heard that Jim had converted to Islam?\n\nThat didn’t really bother me at all. He was a devout Catholic. He had a lot of faith. Jim kind of transcended religion. He was much more about faith. He had a very open view about what God is. There were reports or headlines that said, “James Foley converted to Islam while in captivity,” and they just kind of left it at that. You can’t just say that and not dive in to explore what that means. I wanted to get into those many layers of gray. I think it’s a really beautiful sentiment: what Jim was able to do, how he was able to keep his faith, and how he was able to attach to it in captivity, by conversion.\n\nJim remained in captivity as European captives were released because, presumably, their governments were willing to negotiate. Do you feel like the U.S. failed Jim?\n\nIt’s tough to use the word fail. I’m not going to sit here and bash the government, because it’s a very complicated system. I can see both sides of the equation for American hostage policy. It’s an apolitical film. But I can say: The Foleys were threatened with prosecution if they tried to raise ransom, which is hard to take in. But there’s now a declassified mission, a rescue attempt that happened during the captivity, that failed. They got there too late. The government failed, but they also tried. It’s just a very complicated topic. I don’t sway either way. I wish our government and the British government had negotiated, but I understand this is a very niche issue. Not a lot of families experience it.\n\nI will say that the administration is moving forward in a very positive direction. [Jim’s mom] Diane Foley has established the James Foley Legacy Foundation. They’ve been working with the government to establish hostage fusion cells. They understand that the policy needs to be worked on and looked at.\n\nWhat, ultimately, do you hope the film does?\n\nI think Jim’s story is a triumphant story. It’s really a story about humanity, where are we with our humanity in the world right now. I hope that it makes people look in the mirror, as far as what’s happening in Syria, the Syrian refugee crisis, letting Muslims into the country—all these topics are so relevant, and there’s good and evil on both sides of the coin.\n\nThis interview has been condensed and edited."
