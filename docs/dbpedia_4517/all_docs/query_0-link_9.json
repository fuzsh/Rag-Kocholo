But grandpa's not ready to pass on the quarter or pass on to his final reward: he has some unfinished business with a woman from his past, and he enlists Gennaro to act as his emissary.",

It is somewhat frustrating though.\n\nA young boy, Gennaro, spends a full day in 1933 Philadelphia trying to collect 25 cents to get admission to the new movie theater in town. Gennaro toggles between trying to collect the money, and coming back home to tell his dying grandfather (Pacino).\n\nA few flaws: the kid's desire to get to the theater seems to be to pass time rather than to have some kind of noble cinematic experience or anything of that sort. Why the film is lacking is because it is too in love with its own sense of nostalgia,â€¦"
