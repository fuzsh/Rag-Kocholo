It was written by Joseph Stefano, who considered the film a personal project, with a semi-biographical story. The title refers to the American slang term \"two bits\", for a quarter dollar.\n\nIt is a hot summer day in 1933 in South Philadelphia, where 12-year-old Gennaro lives with his widowed mom and his ailing grandfather. His grandfather sits outside holding tight to his last quarter. He has promised the quarter to Gennaro so the boy can buy a ticket to a plush new movie theater. But grandpa is not ready to pass on the quarter or pass on to his final reward. He has some unfinished business with a woman from his past, and he enlists Gennaro to act as his emissary.\n\nJerry Barone as Gennaro\n\nAlec Baldwin as Narrator/Older Gennaro (voice)\n\nMary Elizabeth Mastrantonio as Luisa Spirito\n\nAl Pacino as Grandpa\n\nPatrick Borriello as Tullio\n\nAndy Romano as Dr. Bruna\n\nDonna Mitchell as Mrs. Bruna\n\nMary Lou Rosato as Aunt Carmela\n\nJoe Grifasi as Uncle Joe\n\nRosemary De Angelis as Mrs. Conte\n\nRon McLarty as Irish\n\nCharley Scalies as Ballyhoo Driver\n\nJoanna Merlin as Guendolina\n\nGeoff Pierson as Dr. Wilson\n\nKaren Shallo as Woman in Red\n\nNick Discenza as Father of Deceased\n\nThe film was nominated for two Young Artist Awards, Best Family Feature and Best Young Leading Actor (Jerry Barone)."
