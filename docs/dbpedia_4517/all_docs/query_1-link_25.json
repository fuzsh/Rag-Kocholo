        "text": "1973\n\nJames Wright Foley was born on October 18 in Evanston, Illinois. He was the first-born son of Diane and John Foley of Rochester, New Hampshire. Jim grew up in the beautiful town of Wolfeboro, New Hampshire. He was the oldest of five children.\n\n1992\n\nAfter graduating from Kingswood High School in 1992, Jim chose to further his education at Marquette University in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. Jim graduated from Marquette in 1996.\n\n1996-2000\n\nAfter graduating from Marquette University with an undergraduate degree in history and Spanish, Jim was accepted to both the Peace Corps and Teach for America and chose the latter to use his fluent Spanish. He taught at Lowell Elementary School and coached basketball in the inner city of Phoenix.\n\n2001-2007\n\nJim was drawn to writing and completed a Master of Fine Arts program in writing at the University of Massachusetts in Amherst in 2003. While in Massachusetts, he volunteered at the Care Center in Hoyoke with unwed mothers to assist them in obtaining their GED and sharing their stories.\n\n2007-2008\n\nBy becoming a conflict journalist, Jim was able to merge his interest in writing with his compassion for the poor, disadvantaged, and suffering amid conflict. The Medill School of Journalism at Northwestern University in Illinois granted him this opportunity. While studying at Medill, Jim taught writing to young felons at the Cook County jail. Jim graduated with a Master of Science degree in 2008.\n\nStarting in 2008, Jim worked for USAID-funded projects in Iraq; he helped organize conferences and training seminars for a program designed to rebuild Iraq’s civil service, crippled by decades of isolation and autocratic administration. In 2008, he became an embedded journalist, in Iraq, with the U.S. 101st Airborne Division\n\n2009\n\nJim became an embedded journalist, in Nuristan, Nangahar and Kunar, Afghanistan, with the United States 4th Infantry Division and 10th Mountain Division.\n\n2010\n\nJim left Iraq and applied for military embed-journalist accommodation status in Afghanistan to become a freelance journalist. He was an embedded journalist with U.S troops in Iraq, where his brother was serving as an officer in the United States Air Force.\n\n2011\n\nWhile working for the Boston-based GlobalPost, Jim went to Libya to cover the uprising against Muammar Gaddafi, embedding himself with rebel fighters. Jim was detained by the Libyan regime for 44 days and ultimately released.\n\n2012\n\nJim began what would be many trips in and out of northern Syria as a freelance video journalist. He began cautiously, but gained confidence as he met kind and hospitable Syrians who offered him their generous hospitality. In October 2012, Jim was back in New Hampshire to visit family and friends who gathered to celebrate his birthday. Unfortunately, this was Jim’s last trip home.\n\nJames was kidnapped on Thanksgiving Day 2012 while working as a freelance conflict journalist in Syria. He had been reporting for Global Post of Boston and Agence France Press.\n\n2014\n\nOn August 19, the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria posted a video on Twitter (now X) depicting Jim’s brutal beheading because he was an American journalist. “We have never been prouder of our son, Jim. He gave his life trying to expose the world to the suffering of the Syrian people,” said his mother, Diane Foley.\n\n2014\n\nThe Foundation was created on September 12, established soon after Jim’s death. Jim’s family and friends felt challenged to continue his legacy of commitment to the truth and compassion for those without a voice. That work continues to this day.\n\nJim’s legacy endures through the Foley Foundation and its work to secure freedom for Americans held unjustly captive abroad and prevent future hostage taking.\n\nWe inspire moral courage one person at a time to value the return of our U.S. nationals taken captive abroad and journalists worldwide. We have driven critical policy and legislative changes, helped create the U.S. government’s “hostage enterprise,” advocated successfully for the return of over 100 Americans held captive abroad, and educated journalists and their employers to know how to protect themselves while carrying out their important work, work that underpins a healthy democracy.\n\nIn 2014, the Foley family established the James W. Foley Legacy Fund — later renamed the James W. Foley Legacy Foundation and widely known simply as the “Foley Foundation.”"
