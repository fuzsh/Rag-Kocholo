        "text": "Our CEO, Dr. Leah Hanes, brings a unique set of professional and personal experiences to her role at Two Bit Circus Foundation. Beginning her career in Toronto, Leah produced and hosted an award-winning television series profiling women in non-traditional roles. This led her to Los Angeles, where she appeared on-camera conducting interviews and hosting a variety of programs covering environmental issues, business and politics.\n\nShe eventually segued into other areas of the entertainment industry, notably as the President of a boutique talent agency representing Academy Award-winning cinematographers, editors and production designers. She also spent several years owning and running an acting school for children and teens, during a period she describes as her “empty nest” adjustment.\n\nHer early life on a farm in Canada nurtured a strong sense of environmental stewardship while her first college experience was in Early Childhood Education, illuminating a solid direction to follow in her recent academic endeavors. Dr. Hanes holds a Masters degree in Organizational Management as well as a PhD from the Graduate School of Leadership and Change at Antioch University\n\nAll of these variables lead to a confluence of skills and knowledge that fit perfectly into the Two Bit Circus Foundation ecosystem.\n\nErin Kistler grew up in the Midwest before moving to Seattle to work in software development at Microsoft, where she spearheaded the project to move word count into the status bar for Microsoft Word. After making significant contributions at Microsoft, Erin's interests took a creative turn. After 6 years in the tech industry, she relocated to Los Angeles to pursue a career designing games and challenges for competition reality shows and game shows.\n\nThis pivot marked the beginning of a new chapter in Erin's career which grew into a successful 15-year career as a television producer which included 4 years traveling the world with Survivor and working on RuPaul's Drag Race. Drawing on her extensive experience in both tech and people management, Erin decided to shift her focus towards a project with a meaningful social impact. Prior to joining the foundation, she spent a year as a Lead Product Manager at Food Oasis (a Code For America project), where she focused on operational efficiency gains and quadrupled the output of university volunteers in 6 months.\n\nOn the side, Erin is an AI enthusiast with a passion for ambitious large-scale art projects. Ask her about her Audrey Hepburn mural made of lipstick prints or the thigh-high alligator crocs she made. She is thrilled to join Two Bit Circus Foundation and combine her love of games & making with her project managing and producing skills.\n\nAs 2BCF Director of Grants & Development, Kellye brings over seven years of progressive experience in grants, fundraising, and nonprofit development. Prior to 2BCF, Kellye earned a Master’s in Political Science as a Merit Fellow from the University of Southern California (Magna Cum Laude), Bachelor’s in Political Science & American Studies from USC (Phi Beta Kappa), Grant Writing & Research certificate from CSU San Diego, Federal Grants Management Certificate from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, and the prestigious Professional Grant Proposal Writing Certification from the National Funding Foundation. Kellye has worked for both nonprofits and government agencies, bringing experience in marketing and government, corporate, and private foundation grants. As a mother to two minority women in STEM, Kellye is passionate about STEAM education in underrepresented communities and the positive impact 2BCF has each day on the lives of youth in Los Angeles. 2BCF’s impact on students and teachers, and its unique brand of using play to inspire innovation and entrepreneurship makes Kellye’s job a passion, not just a profession. In her spare time, Kellye can be found hiking LA’s nature trails with her husband, putting together large jigsaw puzzles, and training her overly affectionate Belgian Malinois named Hunter.\n\nMichael first began working with Two Bit Circus Foundation through the LAUSD SIG partnership while teaching for LAUSD. It did not take long for Michael to delve into the material frenzy. After seven years of teaching high school Science, Engineering and Robotics courses using 2BCF materials, supporting and mentoring new teachers through CSUDH TTT & STAR Programs Michael now brings his unique skill set and passion for the classroom to the 2BCF Team.

Next, she edited an arts and culture magazine. Then, she began working in nonprofits, as well as founding an art gallery that focused on relational art.

She likes learning about neuroscience and art the most, because they are such powerful ways to “hack the human brain” and open up more possibilities, freedom, and fun!
