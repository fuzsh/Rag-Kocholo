        "text": "To most of the world, the place where James Foley spent his childhood must look about as good as it gets: a clapboard house with a large garden in a small town next to a beautiful lake. Visualise the American dream and this is it, pretty much. Wolfeboro, New Hampshire, where Foley grew up in a close-knit family of five siblings, is an affluent corner of a well-off state in the world’s most advanced industrial economy. The worst thing you can say about the place is that it’s where Mitt Romney goes on holiday.\n\nThis was where James Foley started his life. And on 19 August 2014, the world found out where and how it ended via a video posted on YouTube entitled “A Message to America”. Foley, a 40-year-old freelance photojournalist who had been kidnapped in Syria two years earlier, was dressed in an orange jumpsuit and kneeling on the ground. With his hands tied behind his back, he recited what was obviously a prepared script that listed America’s crimes. And then, we all know what happened next: a masked man with a distinctive British accent put a knife to his throat and decapitated him.\n\nAt home in New Hampshire, Diane Foley, his mother, found out when she got a call from a journalist she didn’t know who asked her for her “reaction”.\n\nIf you wanted to eviscerate the American dream, to disembowel it, and string it up from a lamp-post for all the world to see how vulnerable it really is, how easily vanquished, then murdering James Wright Foley on the internet in front of a global audience is not a bad place to start.\n\nFoley could have been the poster boy for the all-American way of life: a handsome, square-jawed idealist from a well-off family – his father, John, a doctor, his mother a pillar of the local Catholic church – who’d had all the advantages that western life can confer: a loving environment, a good education, a childhood unmarked by war or famine or disaster. That he had elected to leave all that and go and cover the ongoing insurgency in Syria for a few hundred dollars a pop from whichever outlet he could get to take his footage was neither here nor there to his captors.\n\nHis murder was the first of a series of videos of western hostages being executed and it presaged an new form of terror. It was the video that introduced the world to “Jihadi John”, or Mohammed Emwazi as we now know he was called. We know quite a lot about him now – how he grew up in upmarket parts of London – Maida Vale and St John’s Wood, how Foley’s fellow prisoners named him and two fellow British jihadis “the Beatles”, and how, in November 2015, he was killed by a US drone strike. But his victims have remained pale and shadowy in comparison. They’ve been stranded, for ever, in orange jumpsuits, destined to end their days reading someone else’s words.\n\nAnd this is what Jim: The James Foley Story, a new documentary about the life and last days of James Foley, seeks to rectify. It’s an intimate, moving portrait – nominated this month for an Emmy – made through interviews with his family, friends and fellow hostages, though it’s not until the very end of the film, when his brother, Michael, addresses the nameless person behind the camera, that you realise just how intimate it is.\n\n“You know him as well as I do,” Michael Foley says to the camera, talking about the video of his brother’s death. “He would never have done those things if there wasn’t someone else who would be harmed. He never cared for himself.” Because the film-maker, Brian Oakes, did know him well, had known him, in fact, since he was seven years old, and grew up with him in the same small town of Wolfeboro. And the impetus for the film, he tells me from his home in New York, came from the desire to rescue his friend Jim, the boy he’d grown up with, from the media creation and propaganda tool that he’d become.\n\n“That was the original catalyst for me wanting to make this film – that image of Jim, of his death, his execution, which was seen throughout the world. I saw this image being used for a lot of different purposes. It was used as propaganda. It was used in politics, for political agendas and for me… as a friend and someone who knew him, that was really… made me uncomfortable. I just wanted to take on the responsibility to tell Jim’s story.”\n\nAnd he does. People have a habit of saying nice things about the dead but it’s clear that Foley was a particularly special case. When I speak to Diane Foley on the phone at her home in New Hampshire, she calls the film “a gift”. She’s known Oakes pretty much all his life, but hadn’t wanted the family to take part initially. “It was very soon after Jim’s death that he came and asked us and I was truly not ready for it. I loved Brian. He was a childhood best friend but I was reluctant, initially. It was his siblings who wanted to do it. They knew Brian best and they wanted people to know who Jim really was and why he put his life on the line.”\n\nIt’s all there, his life from childhood on, warts and all. His idealism and easy manner comes across but also a certain waywardness, a lack of desire to be pinned down by convention or loan repayment plans. But it’s the interviews with his fellow hostages that are at the heart of the film. For two years, when his family didn’t know whether he was alive or dead, he was sharing a tiny cell with a changing roster of other western hostages, not all of whom were murdered by Isis.\n\n“Those interviews were the most intense of the entire film-making process,” says Oakes. “Here were men who were with Jim over the course of months, sometimes years, when we didn’t know where he was. We didn’t know if Jim was alive or dead or where he was, who had him. This was a huge black hole and for me to be able to sit down and talk to those who were with him and to unravel that mystery was very cathartic.\n\n“Michael and Katie, James’s siblings came too and it was very emotional and difficult but also quite amazing.”\n\nOne of the former hostages he talked to was Nicolas Hénin, a French freelance journalist who had spent a long time in the Middle East and who recounts how much he disliked, initially, James’s habit of calling everyone “bro”.\n\n“I just do not use this kind of working-class colloquial language,” Hénin tells me over the phone from France. “It’s just not my style. I’m like, ‘I am not your brother!’” But Foley did become like a brother to him. “We invented a life during these months in captivity,” he says in the film. “And when you invent a life, you have to invent also a family.”\n\nEveryone, at some stage, fell out with everyone else, he tells me. “There were sometimes a few dozen people in a tiny room. In such circumstances, it’s normal that every single one of us struggled with every single other. Apart from Jim. He had these incredible social skills. It really stands out. He was the only one who didn’t have any big dispute with anyone else.”\n\nHénin and Foley became close, not least because for one 10-day period, they were handcuffed to each another. And it was shattering to Hénin when he, like everyone else, learned via the internet of his friend’s death. “My first reaction when I watched this film [the Islamic State video] was horror, but my second reaction was pride. I was just proud of my friend. I was truly impressed by his behaviour where so many others would just scream like babies. Even though I had been through a lot of things in common with him, I’m not at all sure I would have found the courage to behave like that. His comportment, his language… he speaks strongly, he looks straight, he stands straight. He just acts like a man. His condition was like an animal but Jim was a man. And somehow, he just behaved as a free man.\n\n“I shared his fate for months. We were comrades, for 10 months we shared everything except our passports. And that’s what saved my life. And took his.”\n\nBecause the fact that Nicolas Hénin is around to tell the tale is due to his nationality. The French and other Europeans negotiated to get their hostages free. The British and Americans did not. John Cantlie, a British journalist who was captured with Foley, is still being held. And Foley and his fellow Americans and Brits are all dead. It’s still a bitter pill for the Foleys to swallow.\n\n“It’s just terrible,” says Diane Foley. “I was appalled at the way we were treated. I just couldn’t believe it. We just felt so alone. For nearly two years, we didn’t know if Jim was alive, and we had very few people who were with us on it.” As a family, they were told by the government that the best chance of securing their son’s release was to maintain a news blackout, a stipulation they eventually broke, and that they now feel didn’t help.\n\n“We had no idea how to find James and how to get him home once he was found. We just went to everyone we could, begging for help. But at that time, there was nothing in place. I was appalled to find that there was nobody in our own government whose mission it was to help us. It’s not like in Britain or France, which have a structure in place. People were sympathetic. They listened. I think individually they cared but it was just at the bottom of their list.\n\n“It was just appalling to us. It was really up to private individuals who were the most helpful to me – like David Bradley, the publisher of the Atlantic and Phil Balboni, [for whom Foley was working] of the GlobalPost in Boston.”\n\nIt was also, Nicolas Hénin, believes, a terrible miscalculation. He has gone on to write a book about the causes of the insurgency in Syria and Iraq – Jihad Academy: the rise of the Islamic State – and believes that the Americans underestimated the crisis from the beginning. “They thought we had been taken by dangerous amateurs. They didn’t realise what was at stake. I don’t actually know what was exchanged for myself, if it was money or something else. But even if a ransom had been paid for Jim, it would have been worth it, beyond any moral consideration. It would have been worth it from a security perspective because the propaganda impact was so very high.”\n\nIt was. The film does not contain footage from the video and states that fact, explicitly, at the start. “I didn’t include it for a number of reasons but one was because I believe that people have a choice whether to watch it or not,” Brian Oakes tells me. He himself hadn’t watched it until he came to make the film. “And in fact, I still haven’t to this day, not the unedited version. It was not something I choose to do. I don’t want to see that kind of war pornography. To me, that video is just a piece of propaganda, a recruitment tool.”\n\nThat image – of Foley in an orange jumpsuit on his knees in the Syrian desert – marked a new chapter in the use of terror; it became a symbol of the strength and ingenuity of Isis and evidence of the weakness of the west in confronting a whole new type of enemy. Clare Morgana Gillis, fellow freelance journalist and friend of Foley’s, states in the film that 94% of Americans are aware of Foley’s death, making it the news event with the second highest recognition after 9/11. Nobody would have hated that more than him, she says. He went to Syria to try and tell the world about the atrocities that were going on there. “And that was the takeaway?” she asks. The death of a single American reaped more publicity than any other report on the country, ever.\n\nIt was another freelance, Nicole Tung, who rang Diane Foley at home in New Hampshire when, in November 2012, Foley and John Cantlie failed to show up at an arranged meeting place at the Turkish border. Later, the family discovered that the two men had been spotted when they broke their journey to file their copy from an internet cafe; shortly afterwards, armed gunmen forced their car to stop just a few miles from the border.\n\n“I was just incredulous that it had happened, to be honest,” says Diane Foley. “I just couldn’t believe it. That’s how much denial I was in. I was so ill prepared.”\n\nDenial because this wasn’t the first time that James Foley had been kidnapped. He’d hopped around in his 20s and early 30s, studying creative writing, becoming a teacher in an inner-city school in Arizona, and then he seemed to find the thing he’d been looking for: journalism. “Something seemed to click,” says Diane. It gave him a purpose, a mission. And when the revolution kicked off in Libya, he went.\n\nLibya was where Morgana Gillis met Foley for the first time, and the main attraction for them both was that it was exciting and it was cheap. “It was a Mad Max type war,” said Foley when he returned in 2011. Photojournalist Nicole Tung, another friend of Foley’s interviewed in the film, says, “Many of us aren’t old enough to remember journalism in its heyday. What we do is journalism on a shoestring budget.” And with it came a blurring of boundaries. The easiest and cheapest way of getting to the frontline was to hitch a lift with the insurgents.\n\nFoley was with Morgana Gillis and a South African freelance, Anton Hammerl, when they got caught up in crossfire. Hammerl was shot and killed. Morgana Gillis and Foley were captured. For Diane Foley, it was the darkest time of her life: her son missing, the family not knowing if he was alive or dead. “It was absolutely horrific at the time,” she says. And it’s a measure of everything that the family has been through subsequently that she now adds: “In retrospect, it was nothing.”\n\nAfter six terrible weeks, they had the Hollywood denouement. He was released, unharmed, and when he returned to his old school of journalism to tell them about his experience, he revealed how much he had learned. “We did a lot of mistakes that day. Conflict zones can be covered safely. But you have to be very experienced. You have to be very, very careful. We didn’t follow a lot of those practices so it’s a tragedy.”\n\nThe Q&A session was videoed and Oakes includes a lot of it in his film and, in the light of what happened next, there’s a terrible poignancy to the words that Foley spoke, and yet didn’t seem to hear.\n\n“That’s pure luck that you didn’t get killed there,” he tells the audience. “Pure luck. And you need to either change your behaviour right there or you shouldn’t be doing this. Because it’s not worth your life. It’s not worth seeing your mother, father, brother, and sister bawling. You’re worrying about your grandmother dying because you’re in prison. It’s not worth these things. It’s not worth your life, no matter what romantic ideal you have, no matter what ethic you think you have. It’s never worth that. I’m 37 years old, I should have known that a long time ago.”\n\nOakes delves into the very human reactions that Foley’s family had when he was kidnapped a second time. His younger brother, John Jr, who has served in the military, is at times bewildered and angry and ultimately, grudgingly respectful of James’s decision to return to a conflict zone. But mostly, angry. “You just wanted to punch him in the face in a loving, brotherly way,” he tells Oakes in the film. His father, John, still shakes his head in disbelief at the memory of it. And Diane tells me that she thinks she “made it too easy for him”.\n\nWhat do you mean? “I wanted to be supportive. I didn’t say, ‘Well, Jim, you put us through hell.’ I was saying, ‘I respect your decision to do this. And people need to know what is going on in Syria.’ But, to be honest, I put it behind me much too easily. I felt, what are the chances of it happening again? I was really very clueless. Journalists who do this dangerous work need to have those difficult conversations with their families. They need to be prepared and we were not. I was in denial about it. We didn’t have Jim’s will or passwords or bank accounts or emails or things we really needed as a family.”\n\nIt’s what she’s trying to do now since James’s death. The family set up the James Foley Foundation and one of their missions has been to try to better prepare freelance journalists for the potential dangers out there. Shortly after James’s death, President Obama called her to offer his condolences. “He thought you were coming to get him,” she told him. A rescue attempt had been made, she found out, but it was too late. The hostages had already been moved to another location. Since then, though, she has worked with the government to get them to create a cross-department “fusion cell”, equipped to deal with another family during another hostage crisis.\n\nThe foundation is also lobbying news organisations to take responsibility for the freelances they employ. “We have a responsibility for the people willing to do this work,” she says. “We must protect them. Otherwise, it becomes, as it was at the time Jim was there, very abusive. News organisations are just using these young independent journalists for whatever and giving them nothing back. They did not have their back.”\n\nOne of Oakes’s explicit intentions for the film, he says, was to explore the issues around the use of freelance journalists in conflict zones. And what draws them back. Foley, according to Oakes, was “always a kid who loved adventure. He would always take that extra step. When we were teenagers, he was always the one to do something just a little bit more crazy.”\n\nOakes speculates that Foley was suffering from some sort of post-traumatic stress disorder after his experience in Libya. He took a job in Boston but couldn’t settle. He was lured back by what he calls in the film “the siren song” of the frontline. Though it’s not as straightforward as hero-journalists-tell-world-what-it-needs-to-hear, not least because most of the time the world wasn’t listening. And they were taking huge personal risks to file news stories into a void.\n\nBut what Foley wanted – for the world to pay attention to what was happening in Syria – did happen because of his death, I point out to Diane. “Yes. Thanks be to God. But whether Jim knew that, I don’t know.”\n\nIt isn’t over. That’s what Nicolas Hénin impresses on me when I speak to him. He doesn’t talk about the torture he endured, that Foley endured. They were, variously, beaten, starved, suspended upside down from the ceiling, waterboarded. But that wasn’t what they talked about.\n\n“We were all optimists. It was a decision we all made. Some of us were more realistic but it was harder. You had no control whatsoever over your fate. You are not the one who decides anything. The only thing you can have control of is your morale.” He tells me how during the time he was chained to Foley, he talked late into the night with one of their captors, who was later identified as one of the Brussels bombers.\n\n“He was obsessed with the movie The Matrix. He was telling us: ‘You have left the matrix now. You are living in another matrix. You have left that world. We are creating another world.” It was, he says, a “postmodern experience”.\n\nWhat do you mean?\n\n“I learned that Syria was just a background. It had nothing to do with Syria. We were western hostages held by western captors.” And it’s not over. John Cantlie is still a prisoner. “I am still careful what I say because they are still holding a friend of mine. The story is not yet over. And normally, when you are a hostage in Nigeria, Afghanistan, you leave the country and you leave it behind. But my captors came back to my home town and they committed crimes here. In November at the Bataclan, they were less than a kilometre from my home.”\n\nHis captors, he believes, follow him on Twitter. And the media reporting of every terrorist atrocity further inflames the situation. “You British taught us resilience during the second world war and that is what we need now. That motto – Keep Calm and Carry On – is the one we should adopt here now. The media panic, and the politicians panic and overreact. We should think about what our attackers would love us to do. And then do the opposite.”\n\nDiane Foley and the Foley family have decided to find meaning and purpose in James Foley’s death. For them, it wasn’t a senseless bloodthirsty revenge killing. It has become a mission for them to help others. It proves, Diane tells me, that people aren’t fundamentally bad. They’re the opposite. “People have been so good to us. So many people from all around the world have sent us buckets of mail, donations, prayers. To have good overcome, we need to stand together. That’s why we set up the foundation.”\n\nAnd Brian Oakes makes the same point. “I went into those interviews with the former hostages thinking this is going to be horrible, it’s going to be so bad. Every day was probably torture and beatings. And then to find out that this group of men had created this family and all worked together to survive and had made these games and given each other lectures, it was fascinating.\n\n“And Jim was always like that. He was always this beacon of positivity. And to hear that he was like that even in those super-dark times was amazing. It helps to give him meaning, I hope.”\n\nThe film is certainly much less bleak than you’d ever think possible. Oakes says that he deliberately set up the juxtaposition of the idyllic nature of the small town American childhood they shared with the horror that was to follow. “I think those of us who live in a world where everything is peaceful end up taking that for granted. And, that’s why Jim went to Syria, after all.”\n\nWolfeboro, New Hampshire is not Raqqa, Syria. It is the opposite of Raqqa. But still, even there, it seemed there was some small corner of the Islamic State that was forever Wolfeboro. Daniel Rye Ottosen, a Danish hostage who had also grown close to Foley, tells in the film how for Christmas, sitting in the dark, they gave each other compliments in place of gifts. And his present to Jim? “I told him, ‘You are the most honest person. You are pure good.’ That was our Christmas night. And I really felt that I’d had the best Christmas night in my life.”"
