        "text": "James Foley has not directed a feature since Perfect Stranger, in 2007 so eyebrows may have been raised when he was entrusted with Universal Pictures’ sequels Fifty Shades Darker and Fifty Shades Freed.\n\nIn taking the reins of the franchise Foley beat the other likely candidates who reportedly included Mark Pellington Electrick Children's Rebecca Thomas and Hysteria's Tanya Wexler. Foley was seen as the front runner after directing a dozen episodes of Netflix ’s House of Cards, whose producer Dana Brunetti is producing Fifty Shades with Michael De Luca and author E.L. James.\n\nPerfect Stranger, an erotic thriller starring Halle Berry, Bruce Willis and Giovanni Ribisi, grossed just $24 million in the U.S., distributed by Columbia. The film has a fresh rating of just 11% among the critics polled by Rotten Tomatoes, variously derided as pedestrian, bland, foolish and rarely suspenseful, with a ridiculous twist ending.\n\nHis earlier feature credits include Who’s That Girl (1987), Glengarry Glen Ross (1992), Fear (1996) and Confidence (2003).\n\nStill, he was an obvious choice to direct Jamie Dornan and Dakota Johnson as lovers Christian Grey and Anastasia Steele in the sequels, according to Brunetti.\n\n“James’ thoughts on the first movie and where he saw the continuation going really blew us away,” Brunetti , the president of Kevin Spacey’ s Trigger Street Productions, said in Sydney before he addressed Screen Producers Australia’s annual conference.\n\n“His work on House of Cards and his previous feature films speak for themselves. He is a talented filmmaker and a great addition to the team.”\n\nAnother factor in Foley’s favor is the back-to-back filming schedule, which is how House of Cards is shot. Filming is due to start early next year, probably in Vancouver. Fifty Shades Darker is scheduled for release on February 10, 2017, and Fifty Shades Freed is dated for February 9, 2018.\n\nAmong other feature projects on Brunetti’s slate are Evil Knievel, a biopic about the famous stuntman/daredevil that has Channing Tatum attached to star, and Gran Turismo, based on the PlayStation video game which Joseph Kosinski (Oblivion, Tron Legacy) is to direct. Both are set up at Sony Pictures.\n\nHe’s also developing The Resident, a political drama adapted by Dustin Lance Black from the Kate Andersen Browers novel, which explores the relationship between White House staff and various first families spanning several administrations, for Fox 21 and 20th Century Fox TV Studios.\n\nSpeaking generally about the challenges in financing original concepts in Hollywood, he said, “The studio model has completely changed. It’s become very corporate and more about the bottom line. It would be near impossible for me to get a movie like The Social Network or Captain Phillips made now, even though they are in the $50 million (budget) range and went on to make a lot of money. The studios aren’t really interested in making those these days.\n\n“But it’s a very fickle business and it does change continually. Projects take years to develop and get made so I just continue on the same path and the industry will come around or it will change in a way where (a project) will fit into the right slot.\n\n“I think we will see a shift towards day-and-date releasing. As Kevin and I always say, ‘give people what they want and how they want it, and they are less likely to steal it.'’’\n\n."
