        "text": "Has The Fifty Shades Franchise Founds Its New Director?\n\nThe S&M romp that is* Fifty Shades of Grey* might have found itself a new director in James Foley. Following Sam Taylor's Wood's exit - due to reported disagreements over creative control with writer E.L James - Deadline reports that James is the front-runner for the role.\n\nThe director has worked on hits including Close Range and most recently directed episodes of *House Of Cards. *\n\nIf James does score the director role, team Fifty Shades would finally be complete. EL James' husband Niall Leonard is on board to script write, while Dakota Johnson and Jamie Dornan are reprising their lead roles as Anastasia and Christian.\n\nDeadline suggests that as well as directing the Fifty Shades Darker spin-off, which is set for release in two years, James would also work on the third and final book's big screen version, Fifty Shades Freed.\n\nJust so you know, whilst we may receive a commission or other compensation from the links on this website, we never allow this to influence product selections - read why you should trust us"
