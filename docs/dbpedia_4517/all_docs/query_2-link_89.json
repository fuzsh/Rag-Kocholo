        "meta_description": "In August, 2014, a video of the public execution of American photojournalist James Foley rippled across the globe. Foley wore an orange jumpsuit as he knelt beside an ISIS militant dressed in black. That image challenged the world to deal with a new face of terror. And it tested one American family. Seen through the lens of filmmaker Brian Oakes, Foley’s close childhood friend, Jim takes us from small-town New England to the adrenaline-fueled front lines of Libya and Syria, where Foley pushed the limits of danger to report on the plight of civilians impacted by war.",

        "text": "Throughout Jim: The James Foley Story, character being interviewed will mention that director Brian Oakes knew Foley better than anyone. That personal touch is what makes Jim: The James Foley Story just a frustrating documentary. This is less \"The James Foley Story\" and more of a eulogy made specifically for family and friends.\n\nOccasionally, this film will discuss what Foley did, as a journalist or as a helper in times of need. But 100% of the time, Jim: The James Foley Story is simply piling praise on this man, whose every mistake is played as charming, every action is filled with peace and understanding. It's as if in his death, Foley has become almost saintlike in the way he is…\n\nJim: The James Foley Story begins with a disclaimer that it won't show the video of the execution of James Foley, as if to assure us it won't resort to the lowest sentiment to appeal to its audience. About five minutes later however, it shows us, without warning, the dead bodies of men who have just died in combat, which apparently is okay and definitely not too low. Some time later, the film even deems it necessary to show us dead children.\n\nWhich is all the more aggravating because, for the bulk of its runtime, the film has rather little to say about the profession of being a war reporter, or about ISIS, or the war on terror, and consists…\n\nThanksgiving Day, 2012. American photojournalist James \"Jim\" Foley was kidnapped in Syria. A grueling two years before the infamous video of his public execution that introduced the world to ISIS.\n\nDirected by close friend Brian Oakes, much of Jim has a candid intimacy that posits the courageousness of his life. I'm not entirely sure if it achieves more than that—even restricted it to the talking head formula of family, friends and fellow journalists, but it's still a moving life story of posthumous grief.\n\nInterestingly, what I became more engaged by, was hearing former hostages who reveal never-before-heard details of their captivity with Jim. They recollect the cold, starving and violent horrors of being caged up for 18 months. Even the…"
