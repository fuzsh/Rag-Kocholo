Max Mirnyi (Belarusian: Максім Мірны, Maksim Mirny; born July 6, 1977) is a tennis player from Belarus.

Like Natasha Zvereva (a Belarusian tennis star from 1980s and early 1990s), Max Mirnyi focuses on doubles. His biggest achievements so far are the two victories in doubles at the US Open in 2000 and 2002 and his 2005 French Open title. In 2003 he reached the doubles final at Wimbledon.

He became a national hero in Belarus after a very successful performance at the Davis Cup 2004, when he and Vladimir Voltchkov defeated Russia 3-2 and went on to crush the mighty Argentine team 5-0, reaching the semifinals where they lost to USA.

Mirnyi was supposed to be the flag bearer of the Belarus national team for the official opening of the 2004 Summer Olympic Games, but Belarusian sport officials changed their minds after they found out that Mirnyi let one Belarusian glamour magazine publish erotic images of himself and his wife.
