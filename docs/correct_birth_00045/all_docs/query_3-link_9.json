        "text": "The tennis player nicknamed “The Beast” stood tall on the green clay court, a huge smile spreading across his face.\n\nMax Mirnyi may have been on the wrong end of an exhibition tennis match result at the Sarasota Bath & Racquet Club against the best doubles team on the planet, but the big man from Minsk nearly melted when his young daughter ran out to greet him.\n\n“I love it now that my kids are old enough to know what I do,” Mirnyi said this week, just days before Christmas arrived at their Bradenton home. \"(Melanie) just turned 8 and she now gets upset when I lose, and so happy when I win. She realizes why we are where we are and what I do for a living.”\n\nMax Mirnyi, who plays professional tennis for a living, will never forget where he is today . . . primarily because he remembers where he came from. He is keenly aware of the sacrifices others made, and the help he has received.\n\nIt is that knowledge that motivated Mirnyi to take the microphone at the conclusion of the exhibition match and publicly thank his father, Nikolai, for his years of sacrifice and support.\n\n“I could never pay my father back for what he has done for me,” Mirnyi said. “If I had not had my father behind me, committed to making sacrifices to his personal life, I would not be sitting here today as a professional tennis player. I would not have the life I live.”\n\nToday, Maxim Nickolaevich Mirnyi, now 35, has a beautiful wife, Ksenia, and three lovely children, daughters — Melanie (8) and Petra (5) and son Demid (3).\n\nIn a 16-year career playing professional tennis he has nine Grand Slam titles, an Olympic gold medal, has been ranked No. 1 in doubles, has won more than 600 doubles matches . . . and has earned more than $10 million in prize money.\n\nIt has been a career that has afforded Mirnyi an opportunity to live in Bradenton, yet still maintain his roots in Belarus, while traveling the world and rubbing shoulders with the rich and powerful.\n\nAnd it's a career where he was able to finance his education, completing his International Law degree at Belarus University in 2008.\n\nThrough it all, the 6-foot-5, 205-pound player has never forgotten where he came from, and has always remembered to take the time to give back.\n\n“I was raised in a respectful way and I have tried to carry myself throughout my career and my life that way,” he says.\n\nMission accomplished. He may be called ‘The Beast' for his size, and his fearless game, but Mirnyi is a gentle soul who carries himself with dignity and compassion. He serves as a UNICEF Goodwill Ambassador for Belarus, is an advocate for international children protection services and has created, along with his father, a foundation in Belarus that gives children an opportunity to play in a circuit of junior tournaments.\n\nHe also takes the time to participate in several kids events throughout the year while playing ATP tournaments.\n\n“I want to make sure that the game that I was able to work through is accessible to as many kids as possible throughout the world,” Mirnyi explained. “Anytime I have a chance to pick up a tennis racket and hit tennis balls with a kid, I am going to do that.”\n\nAggressive and competitive on the court, ‘The Beast' is regarded by friends and opponents alike as one of the nicest players on tour.\n\n“There is not a kinder, nicer human being than Max Mirnyi,” said legendary tennis coach Nick Bollettieri, who welcomed Mirnyi into his tennis academy at the age of 14 in 1992. “He is nice to children, he is nice adults. He is nice to everybody. My wife has said it a million times and I agree, ‘If the word was made up of Max Mirnyis, there would never be any conflict in the world.”\n\nIt was conflict that played a part in Mirnyi leaving his homeland at an early age to seek success in the game of tennis in the United States. It meant uprooting of family and home.\n\n“You must remember that I was raised and brought up at a time where there were difficult political moments in the country I was born,” Mirnyi said.” With the breakup of the Soviet Union and the whole change of regime, sport was a distant priority for people back when I managed to come here.”\n\nCarving out a tennis career for an aspiring young player meant moving to America. Mirnyi landed in New York initially without his family to serve as a hitting partner for a Tatiana Ignatieva, a teenage phenom who had been signed by an agency and brought to America with her coach.\n\nIt wasn't long before Max was soon joined by his father, who was uneasy with the arrangement and felt his son needed his guidance.\n\n“He sold anything we had back home to move to New York,” Max Mirnyi recalls about his father arriving in the U.S. with less than $20 in his pockets.\n\nWith little money and no promises, the two found an apartment through an acquaintance in exchange for Nikolai helping renovate the place. A few late night dumpster dives provided furniture.\n\nQuickly, Max Miryni began gaining attention around the northeast coast for his tennis success and he was eventually invited to a two-week camp at the Nick Bollettieri Tennis Academy in Bradenton.\n\nFather and son arrived knowing that what happened during their trip to Bradenton could change their lives. And when they were told that Bollettieri would “take a look” at Max at 3 p.m. the next day, neither father nor son got much sleep that night.\n\n“My father sent me out at 2 o'clock to start running, warming up and hitting on the wall,” Max Mirnyi said. “By the time Nick came over I was sweating bullets and as ready as I could be.”\n\n“I can still see it,” Bollettieri says. “They were standing by my stadium court and it was a quarter to three. “I said, ‘C'mon son.' He looked at his daddy and said, ‘Daddy, it is not time yet.' ”\n\nBollettieri wasted little time on the court, watching Mirnyi hit a few shots and walking away.\n\n“He must have looked at me for about two minutes,” Mirnyi said. “I thought, ‘I am done' because I must have done something wrong.”\n\nBut Bollettieri quickly got back to them. And though Max Mirnyi spoke very little English, he understood enough to know that Bollettieri wanted him to be part of the program.\n\n“Max Mirnyi has been with me ever since,” Bollettieri said this week.\n\nA scholarship gave Mirnyi an opportunity, but it hardly meant that the good times were rolling.\n\nCompeting in a group of players that included Anna Kournikova, Tommy Haas and Iva Majoli, Max Mirnyi quickly found that nothing would be handed to him during daily battles on the court. It would be survival of the fittest.\n\n“It is one thing to be No. 1 in your country,” Mirnyi explained. “When I came here, there were 10 No. 1s in every age division. I was sometimes winning and most of the time losing to those guys. I was lost for a while.”\n\nHe was saved by the vision of Bollettieri, the dedication of his father and his work ethic.\n\n“A lot of credit goes out to Nick, who believed in me and supported me throughout my time at the academy,” Max Mirnyi said. “With the combination of my father being totally committed and Bollettieri's support, my life changed.”\n\nNeeding to finance his son's travels to tournaments, Nikolai Mirnyi took a job washing dishes at a Chinese restaurant on U.S. 41 in Sarasota and doing whatever other jobs he could find. He saved up to buy a broken-down car for $500, fixing the car when he wasn't working his other jobs.\n\nOnce on the road, Max Mirnyi began winning some small events to help pay his way. Then his big break came when he teamed with a young Serena Williams to win the mixed doubles title at Wimbledon in 1998. Later that summer the two teamed up again to win the mixed doubles crown at the U.S. Open, a tournament he used to sneak in to watch shortly after arriving in New York at the age of 13.\n\nNow Mirnyi has those nine Grand Slam titles and that Olympic gold he won this summer while teaming with Victoria Azarenka in mixed doubles. Mirnyi was also handed the honor of carrying the Belarus Olympic flag at the London games.\n\n“It was a little arkward,” Mirnyi said about getting the call to carry the flag. “I had represented by country many times (including receiving the highest government title from the Belarus President for leading the country's Davis Cup team to an epic win over Russia in 2004) but all of a sudden you are carrying the flag with all these elite athletes behind you. We have a large delegation, approximately 300 athletes. That was a very unique and special moment.”\n\nMirnyi knows that time is running out on those types of moments in a sport where 35-year-old players are an anomaly.\n\n“To be playing at 35, he works harder than anybody at the academy,” Bollettieri said. “To get where he is today, he's had to work twice as hard.”\n\nBalancing family life and tennis, Mirnyi will greet the new year with a new partner — Horia Tecau. He will soon leave for Australia to begin the new season and says he is looking no further than the year-end championships in London.\n\nNothing would be better than to be there and have his children run happily onto the court.\n\nBollettieri says few players deserve moments like that more than Mirnyi.\n\n“He is as competitive as hell on the tennis court,” Bollettieri said.” But off the court he is a father. He is a friend. He is a man.”\n\nBorn: 6 July 1977 (age 35) in Minsk, Byelorussian SSR, Soviet Union Residence: Bradenton Ht/Wt: 6-5, 210 Turned Pro: 1996 Career Prize Money: $10,317,408 Grand Slam titles: 9 Highest Doubles Ranking: No. 1 (2003) Note: Won gold medal in mixed doubles with Victoria Azarenka in 2012 Olympics.
