        "text": "Jamie Murray is looking for a new men's doubles partner after splitting with Belarussian veteran Max Mirnyi. Murray said the two had tried hard to make the partnership work but they 'just didn't quite click'. Both are now looking for new partners.\n\nMirnyi, 31, has won four previous men's doubles grand slam titles but with Murray he never came close to a fifth. The two doubles specialists only teamed up at the start of this year and were expected to prove a formidable team, but failed to get past the first round in three grand slams and crashed out of the second round at Wimbledon.\n\nMurray told BBC Radio 5 Live: \"We're looking for other partners. It's a shame because we worked hard to try to make it work. It just didn't quite click.\"\n\nThe Scot had performed well with previous partner Eric Butorac and did win one title and reach two further finals with Mirnyi. However, his greater achievements have come in mixed doubles, winning Wimbledon with Jelena Jankovic last year and reaching the US Open final earlier this month with Liezel Huber."
