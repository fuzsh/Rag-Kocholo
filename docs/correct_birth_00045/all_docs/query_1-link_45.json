        "text": "The seventh-seeded European duo needed only 86 minutes to capture the crown over the unseeded North Americans for the top prize of $165,000 at Arthur Ashe Stadium.\n\nMirnyi won his first US Open mixed doubles crown alongside current women's singles world number one Serena Williams in 1998 and took his second in 2007 alongside compatriot Victoria Azarenka, now the world No.2.\n\nWilliams beat Azarenka in last year's US Open women's singles final.\n\n\"New York is the best city to play tennis, this is the best stadium to play tennis and I always get the best partners,\" said Mirnyi, who was also a mixed doubles runner-up in 2000 alongside Russian Anna Kournikova.\n\nHlavackova, who remains in the women's doubles event with compatirot Lucie Hradecka, gave Mirnyi the lion's share of credit for the victory.\n\n\"He was unbelievable,\" she said.\n\n\"He covered 80 per cent of the court. It was easy for me to make some magical returns.\""
