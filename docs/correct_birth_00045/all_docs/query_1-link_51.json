        "text": "Born: 7/6/77\n\nNationality: Belarussian\n\nSeeded: 23\n\nWorld ranking: 28\n\nWimbledon best:\n\n4th round (2003)\n\nRecent record:\n\n2003: 4th round\n\n2002: 1st round\n\n2001: 2nd round\n\nOne of the few top players to combine doubles and singles, Mirnyi is the world number six in the two-man game.\n\nHe is also a dangerous floater in Grand Slam singles draws, and no one will relish meeting him in Wimbledon.\n\nThe Belarussian, nicknamed 'The Beast', won his first career title in February last year and enjoyed a successful hard-court season in the US.\n\nThere he reached two Masters Series quarter-finals but he has yet to find his best form this season.\n\nA semi-final in Rotterdam where he was defending his title is the highlight so far.\n\nAt 6ft 5in, it is little wonder he possesses a huge serve, but the 26-year-old from Minsk can back it up with good volleys and impressive athleticism.\n\nHowever, though he can usually be counted on to provide a few upsets, consistency is a problem for Mirnyi.\n\nAfter impressing ahead of last year's US Open, he crashed out in the first round of the final Grand Slam of the year to clay-court specialist Nikolay Davydenko.\n\nAnd his record at Wimbledon is mixed, although he experienced his best outing last year by booking a place in the last 16."
