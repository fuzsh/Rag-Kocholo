        "text": "Embodying the best that tennis has to offer, Wilson players won eight Olympic medals in London, more than any other racket brand. Hallmark victories included: a gold for Serena Williams with her Wilson Blade Team; a silver from Roger Federer, 17-time Grand Slam champion in the men‚Äôs final, using his Pro Staff 90; and a gold for Serena and Venus Williams in the women‚Äôs doubles. In addition, world no. 1 Victoria Azarenka earned a historic bronze for Belarus, and Juan Martin Del Potro secured a bronze for Argentina.\n\n‚ÄúWe are proud of all of our players who competed in London,‚Äù said Jon Muir, general manager, Wilson Racquet Sports. ‚ÄúTo see such outstanding performances and medal-winning achievements is something that we all celebrate for our players.‚Äù\n\nWilliams won her first individual Olympic gold in top form after winning her fifth Wimbledon title on the same court four weeks earlier. Losing only 17 games in her six matches, the 14-time Grand Slam singles champion shares the tennis record of four Olympic golds with her sister, Venus. In windy conditions, Williams dominated Maria Sharapova with big serves from the baseline to defeat her 6-0, 6-1 and become the second woman ever to win a Golden Slam.\n\n‚ÄúThis win means so much to me because it‚Äôs my first individual gold medal and I‚Äôve worked incredibly hard for it,‚Äù said Williams. ‚ÄúGrand Slam wins feel amazing but winning in the Olympics is another feat completely.‚Äù\n\nWilliams joined her sister Venus to secure gold again for the U.S. in women‚Äôs doubles. They defeated Wilson player Lucie Hradecka and Andrea Hlavackova of the Czech Republic who took the silver medal. Serena is the first player in history to achieve a Golden Slam in both singles and doubles.\n\nVictoria Azarenka, playing with the Juice 100, became the first medal winner for Belarus in Olympic tennis history. In mixed doubles, Wilson players Azarenka and Max Mirnyi clinched the gold medal. Next generation Wilson player Laura Robson teamed with Andy Murray to win silver.\n\nHey there,\n\nWell, it‚Äôs Saturday and we have two brought home two Grand Slam titles from Roland Garros!! üôÇ\n\nCongrats to Mixed Dubs Champs Mahesh Bhupahti & Sania Mirza and Men‚Äôs Doubles Champions Max Mirnyi & Daniel Nestor!!!!\n\nIt‚Äôs really cool to have both teams playing all Wilson sticks!! The boys using the Six.One, which is probably the most popular racket on the ATP World Doubles Tour and Sania with the Juice‚Ä¶.Did you know that MORE TITLES have been won with a Wilson racket than any other brand?! Sooooo Juice‚Äôy!! üòâ\n\nWhat some of you probably also do not know is that Max and I have known each other since we were about 11 yrs old‚Ä¶ we went to Nick Bollettieri Tennis Academy together‚Ä¶. we were in Nick‚Äôs group and I am pretty sure I am the one who had the worst pro results out of all (Kournikova, Haas, etc) in the group‚Ä¶. that is, except for one other guy who shall remain nameless!! haha\n\nMax is not only a great champ, but a great guy‚Ä¶. he represents Wilson so well at all times and we are lucky to have him‚Ä¶ It‚Äôs really nice to see someone who has had great success in a sport be so humble and gracious and did not let success change him one bit. It‚Äôs often fun to see how people grow up and turn out‚Ä¶ kinda funny we get to work together through Wilson! üôÇ\n\nAnd of course, we had to get Max and Daniel in the ‚Äòbeer commercial‚Äô action so what better way to celebrate a Slam win then with this?! Enjoy!! üôÇ\n\nI‚Äôm in NY trying to enjoy some time with my Mom, so‚Ä¶..\n\nUntil later,\n\nTracy üôÇ\n\nThe Six.One is one of the most widely used lines of racquets on the professional tour and long time favorite of players all over the world.\n\nThe Six.One 95 is used by 4 of the 8 players in the Australian Open Men‚Äôs Doubles semifinal and we will be rooting for these teams as they vie for the a spot in the final.\n\nVolleying with their Wilson Six.One 95‚Äôs, Horia Tecau and Robert Lindstedt will take on the Bryan Brothers as they try to reach their 1st Australian Open final when they step onto Laver arena later today.\n\nHoria‚Äôs gear:\n\nSix.One 95 tennis racket\n\nTour 15 pack tennis bag red\n\nLaser Speed Crew\n\nMen‚Äôs Woven Short\n\nTour Vision Shoes\n\nWilson Natural Gut 17\n\nLuxilon Alu Power 125\n\nRobert‚Äôs gear:\n\nSix.One 95 tennis racket\n\nTour 15 pack tennis bag red\n\nWilson Natural Gut 17\n\nLuxilon Alu Power 125\n\nCheck out this interview with Wilson Exclusive athlete Horia Tecau: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y316Q3ik08Q\n\nWilson doubles team, Daniel Nestor and Max Mirnyi will play with their Wilson Six.One 95 rackets as they take on Paes/Stepanek in Australian Open semifinal action.\n\nMax and Daniel‚Äôs Gear:\n\nSix.One 95\n\nTour 15 Pack red\n\nWilson Natural Gut 16\n\nAlu Power 125\n\nWe go around the grounds of the Australian Open to see if people will trade their spot in a 2+hr. cue for the Beer Garden for a Wilson Pro Staff Six.One Jumbo tennis racket."
