They also reached the finals in Madrid, Shanghai, and Paris, though they faced defeats in each.\n\nBopanna has competed in 12 ATP Masters Finals, winning five. He won the BNP Paribas Masters in Paris twice, first in 2011 with Aisam-Ul-Haq Qureshi and again in 2012 with Mahesh Bhupathi. His other ATP 1000 victories include Madrid (2015) and Monte-Carlo (2017)."
