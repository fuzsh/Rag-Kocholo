        "text": "NEW YORK, Sept 5: He was mauled and savaged by a man called ‘The Beast’ but still Andre Agassi stood his own in a cacophonous New York arena.\n\nWith an arsenal consisting of razor-sharp reflexes and a quicksilver brain, the American slew mighty Belarussian Max Mirnyi 6-7 6-3 7-5 6-3 Wednesday night to reach his eighth U.S. Open semifinal.\n\nIt was journey into the last four that required all the 32-year-old’s wit, guile and brute force against a 6 ft 5 ins serving machine who eventually ran out of rockets.\n\nWhile Agassi was raising it to thrill a home crowd with a lion-hearted display, New York-born Jennifer Capriati’s nerves got the better of her and the third seed choked her way to defeat against Amelie Mauresmo.\n\nBig stage nerves and a potent French curse felled the Australian Open champion as she let victory slip from between her fingers to hand Mauresmo her first U.S. Open semifinal spot 4-6 7-6 6-3.\n\nCapriati admitted she ‘choked’ — players’ shorthand for succumbing to nerves — as she allowed Mauresmo record a hard-fought victory in two hours 17 minutes.\n\nThe result gave Mauresmo, a powerful baseliner from the small French town of Bornel, a fourth win in seven matches against Capriati.\n\nMauresmo has now won their last three meetings, including the Wimbledon quaterfinals in July and the Montreal final last month.\n\nThe 23-year-old Frenchwoman will next face defending champion Venus Williams in the semifinals after she crushed sixth seed Monica Seles 6-2 6-3.\n\nThe other semifinals sees Wimbledon and French Open champion Serena Williams — Venus’s sister — face Lindsay Davenport, the last non-Williams to win at Flushing Meadows when she lifted the title in 1998.\n\nIn the men’s draw, top seed and defending champion Lleyton Hewitt put an end to Younes El Aynaoui’s plans of an upset, beating the Moroccan 6-1 7-6 4-6 6-2 to reach the last four.\n\nEl Aynaoui finished his fourth round match at 0214 EDT (0614 GMT) on Tuesday morning and simply could not last the pace against one of the most tenacious battlers in the game.\n\nBut surely not as good as Agassi, Hewitt’s next opponent, after a night of high drama on Arthur Ashe stadium court.\n\nThe shaven-headed fighter stands a full 16 centimetres shorter than his Belarussian opponent, but Agassi looks up to nobody on a tennis court.\n\nThe pair traded fearsome blows — Mirnyi’s serve and Agassi’s return — for the first two bone-rattling sets which they split.\n\nToe-to-toe, the pair slugged it out until a moment of sportsmanship in the third set marked a watershed in the contest.\n\nAt 4-4 and deuce, as Mirnyi stretched up to power a first serve, a voice in the crowd screamed out.\n\nMirnyi missed, returned to the baseline to deliver a more tame version of the serve when Agassi stopped him and told him to take the first one again.\n\nMirnyi, smiled, thumbed his nose to the voice in the crowd and promptly held service for a 5-4 lead.\n\nThree games later, though, Agassi had snatched it with some fierce groundstrokes and was leading two sets to one.\n\nStill Mirnyi charged at his tormentor, but Agassi threw everything straight back at him.\n\nHe broke in the fifth game for a 3-2 lead and held to stretch 4-2 ahead as Mirnyi’s hopes receded.\n\nMirnyi held once more but was broken for the match when Agassi latched onto yet another Mirnyi serve, taking it early and forcing the volley error.\n\nResults: (x denotes seed):\n\nMEN\n\nQuarterfinals: Lleyton Hewitt (Aus x1) bt Younes El Aynaoui (Mor x20) 6-1, 7-6 (7/5), 4-6, 6-2; Andre Agassi (USA x6) bt Max Mirnyi (Blr x32) 6-7 (5/7), 6-3, 7-5, 6-3\n\nWOMEN\n\nQuarterfinals: Venus Williams (USA x2) bt Monica Seles (USA x6) 6-2, 6-3; Amelie Mauresmo (Fra x10) bt Jennifer Capriati (USA x3) 4-6, 7-6 (7/5), 6-3.—Reuters/AFP"
