        "text": "He has big feet and wears size 14 shoes, and Max Mirnyi has been climbing up the ladder of world tennis at a tremendous pace.\n\nMirnyi of Belarus, who shocked eighth-seed Cedric Pioline on Monday, has been scoring exciting victories against top players.\n\nMirnyi is among the three players, who have yet to win their first ATP title, but finished in the top 50 last year.\n\nMirnyi began playing tennis at the age of six. He displayed tremendous talent from the start, and his father sent Mirnyi to Brooklyn, to strengthen his game.\n\n\"I owe my success to Nick Bollettieri,\" remarked Max Mirnyi.\n\n\"While at the Bollettieri academy I got a scholarship. I thank Bollettieri for the gesture or else I could not have afforded the cost of training there,\" he said.\n\nMirnyi could have easily become a volleyball player emulating his father or a basketball player, like his brother. Six feet five inch tall and well-built Mirnyi had all the attributes for these games. His father Nikolai had even played for Russian national junior volleyball team in the mid sixties.\n\n\"I started tennis from the beginning and by the age of 12, I was playing very well in my age group. So, my family encouraged me to keep playing tennis,\" added Mirnyi.\n\nTurning professional in 1996, he has climbed up the ladder at a brisk pace. Last year, he became the first Belarussian to finish among the top 50.\n\n\"I'm physically and mentally prepared. I have been able to stretch and stay strong throughout the year,\" he said.\n\nMirnyi's strongest point is his stamina. In the U.S. Open last year, he clashed against Norman in a third round match for nearly four hours. Though Mirnyi lost the match, he learned a lot from the epic clash.\n\n\"It was a tough match against Norman but I learned a lot about his game,\" he said when asked about the recent victory over Norman in Marseille.\n\nMirnyi has the ability to find the nicks in his opponent's game. \"Matches like that give you a huge boost of confidence,\" he remarked.\n\nMirnyi has a good serve too. Last year, he was ranked among the top 10 in service games won and break points served.\n\nIn fact, Pioline himself admitted after his defeat on Monday that Mirnyi has improved a lot.\n\n\"It was good to play against Pioline. I know I'm capable of playing against players of that calibre. It is a good feeling to know that you can be even with them and come up on top.\"\n\nA member of the Belarus Davis Cup team, Mirnyi has 21-8 career record. \"A lot of youngsters are taking up tennis in Belarus. The game is getting popular there,\" he said.\n\nMirnyi is currently learning Spanish. He is fluent in Russian, English and French."
