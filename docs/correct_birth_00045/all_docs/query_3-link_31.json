His biggest achievements so far are the two victories in doubles at the US Open in 2000 and 2002 and his 2005 French Open title. In 2003 he reached the doubles final at Wimbledon.\n\nHe became a national hero in Belarus after a very successful performance at the Davis Cup 2004, when he and Vladimir Voltchkov defeated Russia 3-2 and went on to crush the mighty Argentine team 5-0, reaching the semifinals where they lost to USA.\n\nMirnyi was supposed to be the flag bearer of the Belarus national team for the official opening of the 2004 Summer Olympic Games, but Belarusian sport officials changed their minds after they found out that Mirnyi let one Belarusian glamour magazine publish erotic images of himself and his wife.\n\nContents\n\n1.1 Titles (3)\n\n1.2 Finals (1)\n\nGrand Slam Doubles\n\nTitles (3)\n\n2000 US Open (w/Lleyton Hewitt)\n\n2002 US Open (w/Mahesh Bhupathi)\n\n2005 French Open (w/Jonas Björkman)\n\nFinals (1)\n\n2003 Wimbledon (w/Mahesh Bhupathi, lost to Björkman/Woodbridge)\n\nFacts\n\nHeight: 6-5\n\nWeight: 200\n\nPlays: Right\n\nBirthplace: Minsk, Belarus\n\nResides: Bradenton, Florida, USA\n\nTurned pro: 1996\n\nExternal links\n\nOfficial site (http://www.maxmirnyi.com)\n\nMax Mirnyi's profile at daviscup.com (http://www.daviscup.com/teams/player.asp?player=10009359)\n\nMax Mirnyi's profile at usopen.org (http://www.usopen.org/en_US/bios/ms/atpm595.html)"
