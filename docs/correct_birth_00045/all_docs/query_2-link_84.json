        "text": "PARIS — Top-seeded Max Mirnyi of Belarus and Daniel Nestor of Canada won a second consecutive French Open doubles title by beating American twins Bob and Mike Bryan 6-4, 6-4 on Saturday.\n\n“Beating the best team, probably, of all time in the finals is a good feeling,” Nestor said.\n\nThe second-seeded Bryans were bidding to win their 12th Grand Slam doubles championship. That would have set a record for most in the Open era, which began in 1968.\n\n“We wanted it probably a little too bad,” Mike Bryan said. “When it’s not going your way early, it’s tough to stay really positive.”\n\nThe Bryans won the French Open in 2003. They were the runners-up in 2005 and 2006, both times against Mirnyi and Jonas Bjorkman.\n\n“For us, it’s probably been the toughest one to win,” Mike Bryan said. “You’ve got to be really tough mentally to win this one. You’re not going to get the easy holds that we’re accustomed to. It’s been elusive for the last nine years now.”\n\nNestor and Mirnyi combined to hit eight aces, seven more than the Bryans. The winners also saved all four break points they faced.\n\n“They hit some great serves when they needed it,” Bob Bryan said.\n\nIt’s the sixth Grand Slam men’s doubles title overall for Mirnyi, who in addition to his four at the French Open also won the U.S. Open in 2000 with Lleyton Hewitt and in 2002 with Mahesh Bhupathi.\n\nFor Nestor, the total is eight major championships in men’s doubles: four at the French Open, including with Mark Knowles in 2007 and Nenad Zimonjic in 2010; two at Wimbledon, with Zimonjic in 2008 and 2009; one at the Australian Open, with Knowles in 2002; and one at the U.S. Open, with Knowles in 2004."
