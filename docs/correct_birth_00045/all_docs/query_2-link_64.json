        "text": "By Scoop Malinowski\n\nStatus: Winner of six Grand Slam doubles titles and four mixed doubles titles. Also won Olympic gold in mixed doubles in 2012 (with Azarenka). As an ATP singles player, reached a career-high rank of #18 in 2003. Has singles wins over Federer, Hewitt at 2000 Olympics, Safin, Sampras, Rafter, Kafelnikov, Kuerten and Blake. Retired from pro tennis last year.\n\nHt: 6-5 Wt: 205\n\nDOB: July 6, 1977 In: Minsk, Belarus\n\nFirst Tennis Memory: “Cash beating Lendl, finals at Wimbledon. (Watched it on TV?) Yes. Those were little glimpses we got in Belarus when I was growing up. So that stuck with me.”\n\nTennis Inspiration: “Roger Federer.”\n\nHobbies/Leisure Activities: “Well, I like music and fishing. And time I have I like to get outside and so some fishing, listen to some music.”\n\nFavorite Movies: “Classic Russian movies.”\n\nFavorite TV Show: “Don’t watch.”\n\nMusical Tastes: “Classic rock, Eric Clapton, Bob Dylan.”\n\nLast Book Read: “I’m actually studying now. I’m not reading any literature. Most of my reading was school books.”\n\nPre-Match Feeling: “It varies from match to match. But overall it’s a little bit of nervousness. But at the same time you feel that the heart rate rises and that’s a common thing. It’s hard to live without it.”\n\nFavorite Meal: “Japanese food.”\n\nFavorite Ice Cream Flavor: “Rum raisin.”\n\nFirst Car: “Mercury Marquis (white).”\n\nGreatest Sports Moment: “I suppose playing Davis Cup and winning tough matches. Semifinal Davis Cup most stands out. And any time you win a match at the Grand Slams, for me, it’s a very special feeling.”\n\nMost Painful Moment: “Losing in those occasions.”\n\nFavorite Tournaments: “I love playing in the United States. (Why?) Well, I grew up here. I first came here and my whole tennis experience has to do with this country. I feel very homey playing in the U.S., whether it’s Cincinnati, Indian Wells or a small Challenger in Binghamton. I always felt it was the same.”\n\nClosest Tennis Friends: “I must say the Russian guys, even though we’re competitive. We share a lot of things, friendly with families.”\n\nFunniest Player Encountered: “My former doubles partner is the funniest guy – Jonas Bjorkman.”\n\nToughest Competitors: “Andre Agassi. Because of the style our games match up. He was a very good returner and I win a lot of my points at the net and it was always tough for me to apply my front game to his returns. So he was the toughest one to play against. The greatest ones discussed nowadays with Sampras and Roger Federer – they’re certainly tough players to play but I had wins against them. I never beat Andre.”\n\nFunny Tennis Memory: “It’s not a laughing experience. I always take it pretty seriously. And I want to win every match.”\n\nEmbarrassing Tennis Memory: “Probably the fifth set against Zib I played at the U.S. Open about ten years ago. When I totally ran out of my dry shirts and dry shorts. And I had to undress on court and have the new sets of clothes sent up to me at the court. (Who won?) I did.”\n\nWhich Match Did You Feel You Played Your Absolute Best: “There are many matches like that. I would say anytime you play a tough, competitive match, three or five sets, and you win a tight one. That’s normally when you play the best.”\n\nFavorite Players To Watch: “Roger Federer. Djokovic is attractive. I love the way he moves. And anybody that’s a natural mover, athletic player, I love to watch.”\n\nPeople Qualities Most Admired: “I would say professionals. No matter what you do, I like it when it’s done properly and correctly. And when people are faithful to one another. I think that’s the most important thing.”\n\nCareer Accomplishments: Max reached the ATP no. 1 ranking in June 2003 and won six Grand Slam titles: Men’s doubles in the 2000 and 2002 US Open and the 2005, 2006, 2011 and 2012 Roland Garros. He won 1 singles title and 52 doubles titles and $11,763,620 in career prize money.\n\nMax Mirnyi\n\nComments are closed.\n\n<< Which players do the pros cheer for?"
