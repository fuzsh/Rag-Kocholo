        "text": "Ashley Fisher mentioned Max Mirnyi’s new pizza place during the Delray Beach doubles final on the Tennis Channel. (Max and Horia Tecau lost to Jack Sock and James Blake.)\n\nSo with curiosity I went over to sample the pizza this week after two hours of singles action with a friend. Break Point Wood Oven Pizza is located about 200 yards from Bollettieri’s IMG Academy on a busy corner of a strip mall. There are big banners and signs outside which show the six-time major title winner attired in apron, chef cap, hitting a forehand volley with a pasta strainer.\n\nInside, the restaurant and bar are immaculate. There are pieces of memorabilia, posters, programs, tennis books, photos with David Beckham, George Bush, Roger Federer, Serena Williams, Maria Sharapova and also some tennis art on the walls.\n\nThere was a good crowd of people, about a dozen, inside the place in the later afternoon when we went.\n\nOur waiter was Pete, who looks almost exactly like Max, but with darker hair. Of course, Pete is Max’s younger brother.\n\nWe ordered just a basic large pizza and after about just an eight minute wait, it came out after the caesar salad (superb dressing). Both were delicious. It’s without a doubt, the best pizza I’ve had in a longtime, thin crust, light on the sauce and some tasty cheese. As good as any in New York City, believe it or not.\n\nPete, who was wearing a red Nike Belarus Davis Cup Dri-Fit shirt, said Nick Bollettieri dines at Break Point “all the time.”\n\nI was hoping to see Max, maybe in the back handmaking the pizzas, but he’s on assignment playing Davis Cup doubles this weekend for Belarus.\n\nWith or without Chef Max in the kitchen calling the shots, the bottom line is that Mirnyi’s pizza, according to my inner food critic, is as supreme as his doubles skills, which earned the 35 year old Belarussian the ATP #1 ranking in 2003. It’s simply the best. My all-time favorite pizzas are the long defunct B’s Pizza in the old Kinnelon (NJ) mall, Ray’s Pizza in NYC, Brooklym Pizza in Hackensack (NJ)…and now Break Point Pizza in Bradenton, FL.\n\nMax's pizza is absolutely Delicious!\n\n<< Davis Cup Weekend Live Discussion"
