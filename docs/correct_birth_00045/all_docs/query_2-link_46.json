        "text": "A devastating update about Serena Williams’ former doubles partner, Max Mirnyi, and a massive loss in the personal life of Mikhail Youzhny has filled the tennis world with an air of melancholy. Former Belarusian doubles legend Max Mirnyi has undergone surgery for a malignant tumor and former Russian tennis player Mikhail Youzhny has lost his wife, Yulia, to an illness.\n\nVeteran tennis reporter Cindy Shmerler shared the updates on X in a tweet. She wrote, “Sad news from the tennis world. Former world No. 1 doubles player Max Mirnyi from Belarus had surgery for a malignant brain tumor and is recuperating in Florida. And two-time U.S. Open semifinalist Mikhail Youzhny’s wife Yulia died last week in Dubai following a long illness.”\n\nBack in December 2023, Belarusian outlet Smart Press reported that 46-year-old Mirnyi started experiencing headaches over a month ago. After a visit to the doctor, an MRI showed a brain tumor. Per the report, Mirnyi underwent an eight-hour-long surgery to remove the tumor.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nArticle continues below this ad\n\nMax Mirnyi had a stellar career on the court, winning 10 Grand Slam titles, and was a former doubles world No. 1. He also won gold at the 2012 London Olympics mixed doubles event with Victoria Azarenka. Mirnyi notably won the mixed doubles titles at Wimbledon and the US Open with Serena Williams in 1998. The 46-year-old announced his retirement in 2018 with 52 doubles titles to his name.\n\nMeanwhile, Mirnyi’s occasional doubles partner Mikhail Youzhny lost his wife, Yulia Youzhny to a long-term illness.\n\nREAD MORE – How Serena Williams Saved Her Own Life\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nArticle continues below this ad\n\nMikhail Youzhny suffers an enormous loss\n\nCindy Shmerler also reported that Yulia Youzhny, wife of the two-time Davis Cup winner Mikhail Youzhny passed away in Dubai after battling a long-term illness. Yulia and Mikhail got married in 2008 and have three children, sons Maxim and Igor and a daughter. Yulia was pictured at Youzhny’s matches, including in Melbourne for the Australian Open. His wife had not appeared on his Instagram feed for more than three years before the report surfaced on X.\n\nYouzhny, 41, is a former nine-time ATP champion and retired from pro tennis in 2018. He won the Davis Cup with Russia in 2002 and 2006 before turning his attention to coaching, working with Canadian star Denis Shapovalov in 2019 and 2020. He became a sensation for smashing a racquet on his forehead during an ATP match in 2008 at the Miami Open against Nicolas Almagro. Afterward, he started bleeding and required medical attention before remarkably going on to win the match in three sets.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nArticle continues below this ad\n\nThe tennis world is grappling with two tragic pieces of news involving Max Mirn and Mikhail Youzhny. We extend our support to the two tennis stalwarts in this hour of grief."
