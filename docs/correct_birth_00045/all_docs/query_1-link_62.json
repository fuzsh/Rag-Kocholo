        "text": "The most famous and most titled Belarusian tennis player Maxim Mirnyi has completed his sports career. This was announced by the tennis player himself in an open letter published on the website of the Belarusian Tennis Federation.\n\n“I want to inform you today that I decided that 2018 would be the last season in my professional career. It was a difficult decision for me, considering that tennis has been my life since my early childhood. I am happy that I managed to enjoy this game so long! When representing myself or playing for the country, I always treated my profession with a high degree of pride and respect, always worked with full dedication and, therefore, I quit the game without any regret and only with positive feeling! I managed to achieve much more than the kid from Minsk could dream, when he first took a racket in his hand,” notes Maxim Mirnyi.\n\nMaxim Mirnyi is 41 years old. He is the 2012 Olympic champion in mixed doubles (paired with Victoria Azarenka), he won the Grand Slam 10 times (a cycle of four annual most prestigious tennis tournaments) in doubles and mixed doubles, he won twice the Final ATP tournament in doubles and he won 53 times ordinary ATP tournaments (one of them was in singles). For some time he was the first racket of the world in doubles. He played for the national team of Belarus in the Davis Cup.\n\nIn addition to sports, Maxim Mirnyi is engaged in business. He has the investment and construction company “Peaceful Way”, a sports and fitness center and a number of cafes.\n\nIn 2003-2004 he was the national UN Goodwill Ambassador for HIV / AIDS in Belarus.\n\nbelsat.eu"
