        "text": "WIMBLEDON, England (AP) — Max Mirnyi and Jonas Bjorkman are top contenders for the Wimbledon men's doubles title. The next time they play, though, they'll be on opposite sides of the net.\n\nMirnyi and Bjorkman, who have teamed together to win consecutive French Open championships, will meet for a place in the quarterfinals of the singles at the All England Club.\n\n\"Very tricky matchup,\" Mirnyi said. \"It's always tough to play somebody you know so well and share so many good and bad moments on the court with. We've been playing doubles together now for close to two years. We certainly know anything there is to know about each other's game.\"\n\nMirnyi, a 28-year-old Belarusian, and Bjorkman, a 34-year-old Swede, reached the fourth round Friday in contrasting fashion.\n\nBjorkman advanced in straight sets, beating Italy's Daniele Bracciali 7-5, 6-2, 6-1. Mirnyi went the distance to upset eighth-seeded James Blake of the United States, 6-4, 3-6, 4-6, 6-1, 6-0.\n\nAfter those wins, they went back out together to play a first-round doubles match, beating the Czech pair of Tomas Cibulec and Jiri Novak 6-3, 6-2, 6-2.\n\nBjorkman will be the favorite when they face each other Monday: He's 9-1 against Mirnyi, including wins in their last six meetings.\n\nMirnyi and Bjorkman are seeded No. 2 in doubles, behind the pair of American twins Bob and Mike Bryan. Bjorkman has won eight Grand Slam doubles titles with four different partners. Mirnyi has three major doubles titles.\n\nMirnyi used his doubles volleying techniques to great effect Friday, stretching wide and bending low to reach shots against Blake in his first singles appearance on Centre Court.\n\n\"I just felt comfortable out there,\" Mirnyi said. \"Great feeling. Everything's very silent. You hit a ball, you hear an echo. I was pretty much within myself there.\"\n\nBlake attested to the challenge of facing the 6-foot-5 Mirnyi, whose nickname is the \"Beast.\"\n\n\"He's one of the best doubles players in the world for a reason,\" said Blake, whose record in five-setters fell to 0-9. \"He's also one of the best singles players in the world for a reason, and one of the best grass courters, because he makes those volleys. He's got incredible hands. I mean he's huge. Up at net, it's tough to get (shots) past him.\"\n\nSaturday's program features a third-round showdown between Andre Agassi and Rafael Nadal. Agassi, the 1992 champion, is playing in his 14th and final Wimbledon at age 36. Nadal, the 20-year-old two-time French Open champ, is looking for his first breakthrough on grass.\n\nAlso scheduled on Centre Court is No. 3 Andy Roddick against Britain's Andy Murray. Among the women, top-seeded Amelie Mauresmo and 2004 champion Maria Sharapova were also due to play.\n\nGetting the day off is three-time defending champion Roger Federer, who beat Nicolas Mahut 6-3, 7-6 (2), 6-4 to extend his record grass-court winning streak to 44 matches.\n\nFederer's opponent Monday will be familiar to him: No. 13-seeded Tomas Berdych, who advanced by outlasting No. 19 Tommy Haas 2-6, 7-5, 7-6 (7), 4-6, 8-6. Berdych lost to Federer last week on grass in Halle, Germany, and also four weeks ago on clay at the French Open.\n\nBut Berdych upset Federer on a hard court at the Athens Olympics in 2004.\n\n\"That is for me a very tricky match,\" Federer said. \"It's quite a tough draw I have this year.\"\n\nOne upset after another shook up the draws Friday, with 1997 Wimbledon champion Martina Hingis, 2002 runner-up David Nalbandian, 2004 U.S. Open champion Svetlana Kuznetsova and Blake all going out.\n\n\"Somehow, at Wimbledon, you're never safe,\" Hingis said after wasting a 3-0 lead in the final set and losing to Ai Sugiyama of Japan 7-5, 3-6, 6-4. \"When you're out on the grass, it seems like you never know how the next point's going to go.\""
