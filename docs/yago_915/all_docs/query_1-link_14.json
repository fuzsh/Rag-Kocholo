It wasn't that long before Pacino discovered his acting ability. Pacino was rather poor, and he lived in a poor neigborhood with his Grandmother. Growing up Pacino acted in lots of stage performences. Before his first movie was ever made he won a \"Tony\" for a stage play he'd done.Pacino recieved his great acting ability from the HERBERT BERGHOF STUDIO and the ACTORS STUDIO, both in New York. Pacino starred in a couple of award winning plays. Then he won the lead in the film \"The Panic in Needle Park,\" in which Pacino played a drug addicted crook. \"The Panic in Needle Park\" pasted his way to Francis Ford Coppola and the role of Michael Corleone in \"The Godfather, ( 1972).\" The Godfather gave him his first OSCAR nomination. The film is about the fictional mafia crime family known as the Corleone crime family. Than came an almost unforgettable role in Serpico, a film were Pacino plays a cop who fights against coruption. After Serpico Pacino took on the role of Micheal Corleone once again in Francis Ford Coppola's \"The Godfather Part II\", Pacino is the don of the family, and we watch his rise as \"don.\" \"The Godfather Part II\" earned Pacino another OSCAR nomination. Next Pacino stars as the homosexual bank robber Sunny in \"Dog Day Afternoon\" a film which co-starred John Cazel. Pacino did a few not to hot flicks, then came back with \"Scarface.\" \"Scarface\" got some mixed reviews, but it brought Pacino back in a way. His next good movie was \"Sea of Love.\" \"Sea of Love\" which got some good reviews, mostly about Pacino's great performence. Pacino was again nominated this time for his role in \"Dick Tracy.\" Mostly because he did such a good job acting with all that make-up on. Once again Pacino returned to his role as Micheal Corleone in \"The Godfather Part III.\" Pacino has now had a bit of a film streak. In 1992 and 1993, he gave his two great performances in \"Scent of a Woman\" and \"Carlito's Way\". He won his first OSCAR for his leading role in \"Scent of a Woman\". He's been starring in much more movies now. Like the obsessed cop in \"Heat\" trying to track down Robert De Niro. Playing the mayor in \"City Hall.\" And writing and directing his own love letter to William Shakspere called \"Looking for Richard\". Pacino came out with some more movies in 1997. One starring Johnny Depp called \"Donnie Brasco.\" his second in 1997 was \"Devil's Advocate\" with Keanu Reeves.\n\nWe couldn't see Pacino in action in the year 1998. In the end of 1999, two pacino movies were released. Those were \"The Insider\" directed by Micheal Mann with whom Pacino gave one of my favorites...\"Heat\"(1995) and 2nd is \"Any Given Sunday\" with great director/producer Oliver Stone.
