        "text": "Actor and co-founder of the Tribeca Film Festival Robert De Niro at the 2010 Doha Tribeca Film Festival, October 30, 2010 in Doha, Qatar.\n\nBorn in New York City in 1943 to two accomplished painters, Robert De Niro grew up in Little Italy and was attracted to acting from a very young age. He studied with Stella Adler and Lee Strasberg, and at age 20 made his first movie with director Brian De Palma, \"The Wedding Party,\" which was not released until 1969.\n\nHe has since appeared in more than 100 films, winning two Academy Awards, while earning the accolade of the finest actor of his generation.\n\nBy CBSNews.com senior producer David Morgan\n\n\"Hi, Mom\"\n\nOne of Robert De Niro’s earliest starring roles was in the comedy “Hi, Mom” (1970), directed by Brian De Palma and co-starring Jennifer Salt.\n\n\"Bang the Drum Slowly\"\n\nOne of Robert De Niro’s most acclaimed performances was as a dying baseball player in “Bang the Drum Slowly” (1973). Michael Moriarty co-starred as the pitcher who tries to conceal his teammate’s struggle against Hodgkin’s Disease.\n\n\"Mean Streets\"\n\nHarvey Keitel, Amy Robinson and Robert De Niro in \"Mean Streets\" (1973), Martin Scorsese's electrifying story of New York criminals that put the filmmaker and his stars onto the world cinema map.\n\nKeitel plays Charlie, an ambitious young mobster whose rise is hampered both by his devout Catholicism and his friendship with the flailing young punk Johnny Boy, played by De Niro.\n\n\"Mean Streets\"\n\nRobert De Niro as Johnny Boy in Scorsese’s “Mean Streets.”\n\nThe actor told CBS News’ Lee Cowan that his attraction to the profession may have come in part from his reserve. “Yeah, part of me is shy, I guess,” he said. “You know the old story that actors are shy, then they get behind the character they play, you know? There’s truth to that.”\n\n\"The Godfather Part II\"\n\nFor the 1974 sequel \"The Godfather Part II,\" De Niro stepped into the character created by Marlon Brando in the original \"Godfather,\" a young Vito Corleone, who in the film's flashback sequences is seen slowly building what will become a criminal empire.\n\nA curious piece of trivia: De Niro had auditioned for the role of Sonny Corleone in the original film, and was hired to play \"button man\" Paulie Gatto, but he asked to be let out of his contract when Al Pacino's role in \"The Gang That Couldn't Shoot Straight\" became available (because Pacino had been hired to play Michael Corleone). By not playing a character in \"The Godfather,\" De Niro was then free to take over Brando's character in the sequel.\n\n\"The Godfather Part II\"\n\nRobert De Niro as Vito Corleone, murdering the “Black Hand” mobster Fanucci, in “The Godfather Part II.”\n\nAccepting the Best Supporting Actor Academy Award for De Niro, director Francis Ford Coppola said, “I think this is a very richly-deserved award. I think Robert De Niro is an extraordinary actor, and he is going to enrich films that are made for years to come.”\n\n\"Taxi Driver\"\n\nDe Niro reteamed with Martin Scorsese for one of his most indelible characters, cabbie Travis Bickle in “Taxi Driver” (1976). Written by Paul Schrader, the film was a violent character study of a troubled loner who strives to find a purpose to his life.\n\nThe film’s shocking violence and nihilism witnessed or perpetrated by Bickle turned off many, but the film was immediately hailed as a cinematic masterpiece of urban isolation, winning top prize at the Cannes Film Festival.\n\n\"Taxi Driver\"\n\nHarvey Keitel as the pimp Sport, and Robert De Niro in “Taxi Driver.”\n\n\"Taxi Driver\"\n\nDirector Martin Scorsese portrayed one particularly disturbing passenger in the cab of Robert De Niro’s Travis Bickle in “Taxi Driver.”\n\n\"1900\"\n\nDominique Sanda and Robert De Niro in Bernard Bertolucci’s historical epic “1900,” about the political turmoil in Italy in the first decades of the 20th century. The film also starred Donald Sutherland, Gerard Depardieu and Burt Lancaster.\n\n\"The Last Tycoon\"\n\nDirector Elia Kazan (left) directs Ingrid Boulting and Robert De Niro in “The Last Tycoon,” a Hollywood drama based on F. Scott Fitzgerald’s last, uncompleted novel.\n\n\"New York, New York\"\n\nLiza Minnelli and Robert De Niro in “New York, New York” (1977), a post-war musical drama that Martin Scorsese saw as an escape from the gritty realism of his previous movies. The downer ending didn’t help the picture find an audience, and the film was cut down and re-released.\n\nIn 1981 the film was reissued with deleted scenes restored, including for the first time the complete musical number “Happy Endings.”\n\n\"The Deer Hunter\"\n\nRobert De Niro as a Pennsylvania steel worker who goes off to war in Vietnam, encountering captivity and the deaths of friends, in Michael Cimino’s Oscar-winning drama “The Deer Hunter” (1978). The film co-starred Best Supporting Actor Oscar-winner Christopher Walken, John Cazale, John Savage and Meryl Streep.\n\n\"The Deer Hunter\"\n\nDe Niro in “The Deer Hunter.” The film’s harrowing depiction of a prisoner of war camp and the soldier’s re-assimilation back home were among Hollywood’s first serious instances tackling the experiences of Vietnam War veterans. De Niro received his third Academy Award nomination, for Best Actor.\n\n\"Raging Bull\"\n\nMartin Scorsese’s “Raging Bull” (1980), about boxer Jake LaMotta, was a meticulously crafted character study of a violent man who could not keep the violence within the boxing ring.\n\nDe Niro showed tremendous ability as a fighter in his boxing scenes, and just as realistically gained an enormous amount of weight for scenes depicting LaMotta as an aged, overweight has-been. The performance won him an Oscar for Best Actor.\n\n\"Raging Bull\"\n\nDe Niro told CBS News’ Lee Cowan that the production set aside time in shooting of about three to four months, during which he transformed himself into the older LaMotta, which was not easy.\n\n“It wasn’t. The first 15-20 pounds, you know, you eat and overindulge, to say the least. And then after that, it’s just pure drudgery,” De Niro said.\n\nAcademy Awards\n\nFrom left: Best Actor Oscar-winner Robert De Niro (“Raging Bull”); Best Actress Sissy Spacek (“Coal Miner’s Daughter”); and Ronald L.

The federal witness protection program.\n\n\"Awakenings\"\n\nBased on a memoir by Dr. Oliver Sachs, “Awakenings” (1990) is the true story of a neurologist’s successful treatment of patients who are “awakened” after years spent in a catatonic state.

De Niro’s portrayal of Max Cady drew comparisons to their earlier collaborations, particularly Travis Bickle from “Taxi Driver.” But Cady does not stand apart from others, pretending to be unaffected by the horror and degradation that surrounds him, something on which Bickle prided himself.\n\n“There’s no doubt De Niro and I are attracted to similar characters that we’ve dealt with before,” Scorsese told David Morgan. “They’re similar -- they’re not the same. There’re different angles in each one. It’s almost like trying to find out how many more sides you can find to a character like Travis or Max, or Jake LaMotta, or Jimmy Doyle.”\n\n\"Night and the City\"\n\nIn the 1992 remake of Jules Dassin’s “Night and the City,” Robert De Niro played Harry Fabian, a lawyer of little repute who seeks to recreate himself as a boxing promoter. His “Rocky”-like quest for success supplants the original’s film noir theme involving a test of one’s moral strength.\n\nScreenwriter Richard Price described Fabian as someone convinced he deserves heretofore elusive success -- that he believes in a sort of Destiny (or at least a payback), but it is a selfish Destiny, one that merely suits himself.\n\n“The character De Niro plays is very different than the character he plays in ‘Mad Dog and Glory,” said Price, who also wrote that 1993 film. “In ‘Mad Dog’ he plays a guy who’s a loner and introverted, kind of plodding and methodical; Here he’s basically playing a mouse who thinks he’s a cat. It’s like a very different metabolism.”\n\n\"Mad Dog and Glory\"\n\nRobert De Niro, Uma Thurman and Bill Murray starred in the comedy-drama “Mad Dog and Glory” (1993), about a Chicago police officer and a mob boss, and the young lady caught between them.\n\n\"This Boy's Life\"\n\nLeonardo diCaprio and Robert De Niro starred in “This Boy’s Life” (1993), based on the memoir by Tobias Wolff, about a young boy and his abusive prospective stepfather.\n\n\"A Bronx Tale\"\n\nRobert De Niro’s directorial debut was the 1993 “A Bronx Tale,” adapted from Chazz Palminteri’s one-man stage play about growing up under the sway of a local underworld figure in New York City. De Niro played a bus driver and father of young Calogero Anello, who is earning tips from Sonny LoSpecchio (Palminteri), setting up a confrontation between the criminal figure and a concerned dad.\n\nIn 1993 De Niro told David Morgan that getting backing for the project might have been easier had he played the mob part, but opted instead for the father. “It’s a good part for me to play, because I’d never done that type of thing; you always expect me to do the part that Chazz is playing.”\n\nHe said he has conferred with other actors, like Jack Nicholson and Danny DeVito, who had taken on directing chores, “so I could get a better idea from them about what their problems were, what they were surprised by, or not surprised by. . . . When you’re acting in something, you have to be a little more concentrated in another way. So that adds another kind of pressure.”\n\n\"Mary Shelley's Frankenstein\"\n\nFollowing the success of Francis Ford Coppola’s “Bram Stoker’s Dracula,” remakes of horror classics were the rage. Kenneth Branagh directed the 1994 version of “Mary Shelley’s Frankenstein,” in which he starred as the scientist who creates a monster (Robert De Niro). It did not fare well with critics.\n\n\"Casino\"\n\nRobert De Niro as Sam “Ace” Rothstein, sent by the mob to run its Las Vegas operations, in Martin Scorsese’s 1995 drama “Casino.” The film was based on Nicholas Pileggi’s non-fiction book about Vegas underworld figure Frank Rosenthal, who ran several casinos in the 1970s and 1980s.\n\n\"Heat\"\n\nAlthough Michael Mann's crime thriller \"Heat\" (1995) had many qualities, it was most heralded for its first-ever pairing on-screen of Al Pacino and Robert De Niro. Pacino played a Los Angeles detective on a personal mission to take down the master thief played by De Niro.\n\nHANNA (Pacino): \"We're sitting here like a coupla regular fellas. You do what you do. I do what I gotta do. What happens if I am there and I got to put you away? (pause) I won't like it. But, if it's between you and some poor bastard whose wife you're going to make into a widow, brother, you are gonna go down. 'Cause you don't have to be there. You coulda gone and been a... a mailman.\"\n\nMcCAULEY (De Niro): \"There's a flip side to that coin. What if you got me boxed in and I gotta put you down? 'Cause no matter what, you will not get in my way. But now that we been face to face, I would not feel good about that. But I won't hesitate. Not for one second.\"\n\n\"Marvin's Room\"\n\nMeryl Streep and Robert De Niro starred in the family drama “Marvin’s Room” (1997), which also featured Diane Keaton and Leonardo DiCaprio. It was the third film in which Streep and De Niro appeared together.\n\n\"Wag the Dog\"\n\nBarry Levinson’s 1997 comedy “Wag the Dog” starred Anne Heche and Robert De Niro as political consultants who hire a Hollywood producer (Dustin Hoffman) to orchestrate a fake war (with Albania!) in order to divert media attention from a looming White House scandal.

At left: De Niro, a retired CIA officer, questions his daughter’s boyfriend in “Meet the Parents.”\n\nDe Niro scoffed at critics who lamented such roles were beneath an actor of his stature. “They can criticize whatever and they could be right -- why this, why that. You can’t please everybody all the time, or even part of the time.”\n\n\"The Score\"\n\nNearly three decades after they played the same character in different films, Robert De Niro and Marlon Brando appeared together on screen, in “The Score” (2001), about a safecracker hired for a $4 million job.\n\n\"City By the Sea\"\n\nDirected by Michael Caton-Jones, \"City By the Sea\" (2002) starred De Niro as a veteran cop who struggles to save his drug-addicted son who is caught in a web of violence.
