        "text": "To the Editor:\n\nAl Pacino's film ''Looking for Richard'' $(''Al Pacino, Slouching (Again) Toward Shakespeare,'' Oct. 6$) misses one important element of the analysis of ''Richard III.''\n\nThe play contains Shakespeare's most improbable scene: despite having murdered both her husband and her father, Richard disarmingly woos and wins the newly widowed Lady Anne.\n\nThroughout his career, Shakespeare struggled with an added theatrical problem: since women were not allowed to appear on the stage, the role of all of the women in his plays were portrayed by boys and men. Anne's initial revulsion at Richard's importuning is thus designed to mirror the presumed sentiments of an audience that was perfectly aware of the ruse.\n\nA few years later, Shakespeare's craft, in this regard, was to demonstrate far greater refinement, as he kept the boy Romeo apart from the boy Juliet by family animosity, exile and a certain balcony in Verona."
