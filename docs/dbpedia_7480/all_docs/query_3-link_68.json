        "text": "Workplace Harassment in the Media and Entertainment Industry\n\nWhy is harassment so prevalent in the media/Hollywood/entertainment/music industry?\n\nIt is no secret that the entertainment industry is full of stories and incidents of harassment and violence. While the #MeToo movement has made it apparent that the pervasiveness of this colossal problem extends to different sectors, the entertainment and media industry has undeniably been confronted with a series of revelations from many victims.\n\nWhether on social media or in news outlets, we have seen anecdotes and reports of serious cases involving some of the industry’s most influential personalities, like the infamous Harvey Weinstein. Even more alarming is that this is only the tip of the iceberg. A large portion of what we are witnessing are sexual harassment cases. But like in any other sector, other systemic problems exist in the entertainment industry, such as racial and gender discrimination, bullying, violence, and microaggression. What factors could influence the existence of the many forms of harassment in this particular industry?\n\nAccording to a study published by the International Labour Organization (ILO), several of these factors include “the way the industry is organized, its organizational culture, and the diverse employment relationships” that are present in the system. Related to this research information, the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) identifies workplaces with significant power disparities and “high-value” employees as risk factors for harassment.\n\nLike any other industry such as in politics and government, as well as in giant tech companies — power, influence, and fame are the main determinants of success in the entertainment industry. Sadly, when used to tolerate inappropriate behavior, these can also be the downfall of anyone. Anecdotes from people who have had to endure hostile work environments prove that high-profile figures are very capable of abusing their power.\n\nProject WHEN’s research on the factors that lead to harassment in the workplace also reveals that culture, organizational structure, and image/reputation can impact behavior in workplaces within the entertainment and media sector. Power dynamics in this industry allow for a work culture where misconduct is usually overlooked or not reported for fear of career repercussions.\n\nIn the entertainment industry, allegations of sexual abuse are frequently kept a secret by coercion and intimidation from powerful people and organizations. Publicly exposing misconduct by influential and well-known entities can be incredibly challenging.\n\nImage or reputation, an important element of people’s careers in entertainment, can also affect how harassment is handled in certain situations. For instance, news about a famous celebrity involved in a harassment incident can easily get covered up, especially if it would save their reputation and the sustainability of a show they are starring in. Many variables can come into play which is why harassment in the entertainment industry has become a systemic problem that requires a sectoral approach.\n\nHowever, much like all sexual misconduct, sexual assault in the entertainment industry is illegal and should be addressed through criminal and civil sanctions. Celebrities who are famous and wealthy shouldn’t be shielded from the consequences of their criminal activity.\n\nIn this page, we will explore what can be done by management, celebrities, and bystanders to address workplace harassment. You’ll also find a list of real harassment examples in the entertainment and media industry.\n\nFilm & music production sets, talent agencies, and broadcast television networks are all affected by harassment, so what can management/leadership do about it?\n\nAs emphasized by the U.S. EEOC Select Task Force on the Study of Harassment in the Workplace, “Preventing harassment from occurring in the first place is far preferable to remedying its consequences.” We at Project WHEN also believe that one of the most effective and greatest steps the public can take to eliminate harassment is to act on it before it even happens. How is this possible?\n\nLaw compliance should be a top priority, but abiding by the law is just doing the bare minimum. More must be done to uproot the destructive practices in a work environment. These practices can be identified by taking a holistic approach to examining the company’s work culture.\n\nWhen it comes to work culture, it is vital to cultivate a trusting relationship between all members of a functional team or organization. When there is trust, there is also an authentic sense of security. Employees will feel safe stepping into the workplace every day, knowing that no matter what happens, the company has their back. This is connected to establishing a sense of accountability in the workplace.\n\nTo hold the entire organization accountable, it is important to articulate to all employees, customers, and the community that the company, agency, or team is genuinely committed to creating a safe space for everyone. By enrolling in the WHEN Organizational Certification, organizations will be making a powerful declaration of their commitment to foster a harassment-free and respectful workplace. Importantly, through this certification, enrollees will be guided through a step-by-step process of exploring the best practices for preventing all types of harassment.\n\nWe also believe that building a respectful work culture is the key to preventing workplace harassment. Advocating for this type of culture is most effective when it starts from leadership teams, cascading down to everyone in the community. Sitting down in an intimate setting to discuss the challenges experienced in the industry today could be a great eye-opener, making stakeholders realize the significance of their role in the fight against harassment.\n\nIf this sounds like something that would greatly benefit your organization, consider partnering with us to host a Project WHEN Roundtable within your company or local business community. We will work with you to create a forum where everyone feels safe to share their observations, ideas, and concerns about workplace harassment challenges and what can be done to overcome those.\n\nWhat can celebrities, staff members, and bystanders do about it?\n\nIn as much as managers and industry leaders are expected to be responsible for preventing harassment in the workplace, celebrities, staff members, and the public do have their own share of responsibility. Recognizing one’s role in the fight against this pervasive problem goes a long way. If disrespectful behavior is being overlooked or even tolerated in the workplace, acknowledging the situation is a crucial first step.\n\nMany people, however, find it difficult to speak up about what they experienced or what they saw in fear of retaliation or losing their careers. Whether one is a victim or a bystander, harassment is unforgiving. It has a detrimental effect on everyone within its reach.\n\nThis is why awareness about one’s rights under the law is important. It is necessary for victims and bystanders to realize that speaking up about harassment or discrimination is protected under federal and state laws. If you are looking to learn how the law offers protection to employees from the different types of discrimination, refer to our resources to fight harassment in the workplace. This page contains our curated set of resources that can help the public begin their journey towards awareness.\n\nDriving change in our places of employment may seem like a long and impossible feat, but everyone has the power to make a difference. If you are interested in leading your team towards a more respectful work culture or sparking change within your community, pursuing WHEN™ Professional Certification can equip you with the necessary tools and knowledge that you need to be an anti-harassment practitioner.\n\nHow does Project WHEN help?\n\nProject WHEN is working hard to spread the important message and encourage organizations to create a more respectful work culture. While we believe that awareness is important, having a means to directly help victims of harassment would have a huge impact. It is why in addition to expanding our resources for companies and employees, we are working on establishing a victim support hotline.\n\nWe aim to offer support to victims by connecting them with someone who can guide them through what they can do to address the problem while being a pillar of emotional support. Our hope is to widen our reach and let everyone know that workplace harassment needs to end now and if this is something one is battling with, help is available.\n\nIf you find value in this cause, consider supporting us by making a financial donation to help us further our work. As a 501(c)(3) nonprofit, we rely on financial support from corporations and individuals to enable us to continue on our important mission of making workplaces everywhere more respectful. Donations made to us are tax-deductible.\n\nWant to know about other ways that you can support us?

Phaedra’s involvement includes allegations of encouraging inebriation and inappropriate behavior.

Franco responded with a mix of denial and support for victims’ rights, stating on The Late Show With Stephen Colbert, “The things that I heard that were on Twitter are not accurate.” The allegations had a profound impact on Franco’s career, prompting him to skip awards events, illustrating the complexities of fame amid serious accusations in Hollywood.\n\nSexual Harassment at H+ The Hip Hop Dance Conservatory – 12/21/2023\n\nH+ The Hip Hop Dance Conservatory, a Manhattan-based dance company, has settled with the New York Attorney General for $10,000 over labor law violations and failure to address sexual harassment claims.

The actor disclosed that he has been secretly recording these encounters for years using devices like digital voice recorder pens and keychains.
