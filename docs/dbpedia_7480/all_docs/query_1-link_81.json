It is based on Robert Stone's novel \"A Hall of Mirrors\". Robert Stone states in his book \"Prime Green: Remembering the Sixties\" that this movie was an embarrassment and that he still cringes when he sees it on television.Fact|date=August 2007 As of March of 2008, the film has never been released on home video.\n\nThe story involves a radio station in New Orleans with the eponymous call sign which is apparently involved in a so-called \"right-wing conspiracy\". It is unrelated to the television station which currently has this call sign.\n\nExternal links"
