        "text": "Forbes has released its list of highest-paid actors, ranking A-list stars based on how much money they made from films and TV in 2023. Here's who took home the biggest paychecks in Hollywood last year.\n\n10. Denzel Washington - $24 million\n\nThe Oscar winner, 69, appeared in \"The Equalizer 3\" in 2023. The film grossed more than $191 million globally, according to Box Office Mojo.\n\n9. Ben Affleck - $38 million\n\nAffleck not only starred as Nike exec Phil Knight in \"Air,\" but he also directed and produced the movie, which raked in more than $90 million globally. The 51-year-old also starred in the film \"Hypnotic.\"\n\nAlthough many stars have endorsement deals – like Affleck's endorsement of Dunkin' – the list only includes their income from their entertainment gigs.\n\n7. Jason Statham (tie) - $41 million\n\nStatham, 56, led the Adam Cay directed \"The Beekeeper\" this year. The star is no stranger to action-packed films. In 2023 he starred in \"Expendables,\" \"Meg 2: The Trench\" and \"Fast X.\"\n\n7. Leonardo DiCaprio (tie) - $41 million\n\nThe 49-year-old Oscar winner starred in 2023's \"Killers of the Flower Moon.\" The Martin Scorsese-directed film received 10 Oscar nominations.\n\n6. Jennifer Aniston - $42 million\n\nAnniston stars in \"The Morning Show,\" which was in its third season this year. She also starred alongside Adam Sandler in the Netflix movie \"Murder Mystery 2.\"\n\nThe 55-year-old also appears in commercials for several ads – from Smart Water to Aveno – and has her own haircare company, LolaVie. But her income from those ventures is not included in the acting salary used to compile this list.\n\n4. Matt Damon (tie) - $43 million\n\nThe 53-year-old starred as Leslie Groves in \"Oppenheimer,\" which was one of the top movies of the summer and earned a whopping 13 Oscar nominations. The Christopher Nolan film also raked in more than $957 million worldwide.\n\nDamon was also a producer on \"Air,\" starring his pal Ben Affleck.\n\n4. Ryan Gosling (tie) -$43 million\n\nPlaying Ken in \"Barbie,\" not only earned Gosling, 43, an Oscar nomination for best supporting actor, but likely a big payday. The blockbuster hit raked in more than $1.4 billion worldwide, making it the highest-grossing film of the year.\n\n3. Tom Cruise - $45 million\n\nComing off the heels of 2022's hit \"Top Gun,\" Cruise, 61, returned to the long-running \"Mission: Impossible\" series for \"Dead Reckoning Part One.\" It grossed more than $567 million worldwide.\n\n2. Margot Robbie - $59 million\n\nRobbie, 33, played the iconic role of \"stereotypical Barbie\" in Greta Grewig's \"Barbie\" movie. The highest-grossing movie of the year, \"Barbie\" raked in more than $636 in its first weekend in the U.S. It went on to surpass more than $1 billion worldwide.\n\nRobbie was also the movie's producer. But she and director Gerwig were seen as snubbed by the Oscars when neither received a nomination.\n\n1. Adam Sandler - $73 million\n\nSandler owns his own production company, Happy Madison Productions, which produces many of his films, including \"Murder Mystery 2,\" for Netflix. The 57-year-old extended his deal with Netflix in 2020 to produce four more films for the streaming service."
