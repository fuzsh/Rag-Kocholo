I call the same command in a Command Prompt and it works perfectly. How do I fix this?\n\nHere is the function I use to call wusa:\n\nsystem(\"wusa /uninstall /kb:2511455\");\n\nI have figured out how to solve this issue and I will post my solution for anyone in the future that has the same issue. The system() command was running the 32-bit executable inside %windir%\\SysWoW64\\ instead of the native 64-bit version. To solve this issue I had to use the following:\n\nPVOID OldValue = NULL; if( Wow64DisableWow64FsRedirection(&OldValue) ) { // Anything in this block uses the system native files and not the WoW64 ones // put native WoW64 code here system(\"wusa /uninstall /kb:2511455\"); //system(\"wusa /?\"); // use this for testing // Immediately re-enable redirection. Note that any resources // associated with OldValue are cleaned up by this call. if ( FALSE == Wow64RevertWow64FsRedirection(OldValue) ) { // Failure to re-enable redirection should be considered // a criticial failure and execution aborted. return 0; } }\n\nanswered Jun 8, 2015 at 1:18\n\nrn10950rn10950\n\n9333 silver badges1111 bronze badges"
