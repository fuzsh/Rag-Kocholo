        "text": "1960 film by Mark Robson\n\nFrom the TerraceDirected byMark RobsonScreenplay byErnest LehmanBased onFrom the Terrace\n\nby John O'HaraProduced byMark RobsonStarringCinematographyLeo ToverEdited byDorothy SpencerMusic byElmer BernsteinDistributed by20th Century Fox\n\nRelease date\n\nRunning time\n\n144 minutesCountryUnited StatesLanguageEnglishBudget$3 million[1]Box office$5.2 million (US and Canada rentals)[2]\n\nFrom the Terrace is a 1960 American DeLuxe Color romantic drama film in CinemaScope directed by Mark Robson from a screenplay by Ernest Lehman, based on the 1958 novel of the same name by John O'Hara. The film stars Paul Newman, Joanne Woodward, Myrna Loy, Ina Balin, George Grizzard, and Leon Ames, with a young Barbara Eden appearing in one scene. The plot tells the story of the estranged son of a Pennsylvania factory owner who marries into a prestigious family and moves to New York to seek his fortune.\n\nThis was the third theatrically released film that real-life spouses Newman and Woodward made together.[3]\n\nIn 1946, navy veteran David Alfred Eaton returns home from the war to Philadelphia. He finds his mother Martha driven to alcoholism by years of neglect and abuse from her husband Samuel Eaton, owner of a prestigious iron and steel company. Having withdrawn from his family after the death of his firstborn son thirteen years earlier, Samuel has resentment towards Alfred. As a result, Alfred turns his back on the family business and strike out on his own with his closest friend Lex Porter.\n\nWhile attending a party at the estate of Lex's wealthy uncle, Alfred is dazzled by Mary St. John, the daughter of a wealthy family. Mary is drawn into a relationship with Alfred and defies her parents by breaking her secret engagement to Dr. Jim Roper. After Alfred's father Samuel falls ill, Alfred shuns the family business once again to start an aviation company with Lex.\n\nOn his wedding day, Alfred receives word that his father has died. With his uncle's money, Lex funds the Nassau Aircraft Corporation with Alfred, but Alfred becomes impatient when Lex shows more interest in perfecting aircraft designs than in selling aircraft.\n\nOne wintry day, Alfred and Mary are driving home from a party when they see a little boy fall through the thin ice of a frozen pond. Alfred plunges into the icy waters to save him. The boy's grandfather, James Duncan MacHardie, the most famous financier in America, invites Alfred and Mary to dinner. MacHardie offers Alfred a job in his investment firm.\n\nObsessed by the need to outdo his father, Alfred travels the country for MacHardie, leaving Mary alone for months at a time. Lonely and self-pitying, Mary begins to resent Alfred's constant absences. MacHardie's son-in-law, Creighton Duffy, suggests that Alfred spend two months in rural Pennsylvania checking out the business aptitude and prospects of Ralph Benziger, a prosperous coal mine owner.\n\nAfter an ugly argument with his wife, Alfred goes to Pennsylvania. Invited to dinner at Benziger's home, he meets Natalie, the man's beautiful and compassionate daughter. Feeling lonely, Alfred impetuously invites Natalie on a date, but she refuses because he is married. However, she later reconsiders and meets him at a drive-in movie the following evening.\n\nAlfred confides to Natalie that her warmth and generosity has made him realize what a sham his marriage is. They share a kiss, but Natalie still believes they must end this relationship before it goes any further.\n\nUpon returning to New York, Alfred is immediately summoned to MacHardie's office. He is informed that Mary has been having an affair with Dr. Roper. But the archly conservative MacHardie warns Alfred that he will not tolerate divorce within his firm. MacHardie also assigns him to analyze the Nassau Aircraft Corp., his former firm, as a possible investment.\n\nOne night while leaving a party with his wife, Alfred unexpectedly encounters Natalie in front of the hotel. Sensing that Alfred and Natalie were intimate, Mary vindictively calls Roper and makes a date with him. Alfred goes to meet Natalie and tells her that, although he is estranged from Mary, his career prevents him from requesting a divorce.\n\nAlfred begins to investigate Nassau Aircraft's business practices. Duffy, who has become unethically involved with Nassau and will reap a financial windfall if MacHardie invests in the company, threatens to blackmail Alfred unless he suppresses his report.\n\nAlfred and Natalie meet for a tryst in a hotel room. Photographers hired by Duffy burst in and capture their indiscretion. Natalie, uncertain if Alfred's main concern is to save her reputation or his career, decides to leave. Mary suggests to her husband that they share an open marriage, seeing whomever they please. The scandalous photos are delivered to Alfred at his home.\n\nAt work the next day, MacHardie ushers in Mary to celebrate Alfred's surprise promotion to partner. Alfred rises and denounce MacHardie's hypocrisy of placing success and social position above personal responsibility and happiness. Alfred then issues the uncensored report exposing Duffy's duplicity and walks out. Mary runs after him, but it is too late. He leaves her for good and returns to Natalie's home for a new life -- with his wedding ring now missing from his finger.\n\nThe film had its world premiere engagements at the Paramount Theatre and Murray Hill Theatre in New York City on July 15, 1960.[4]\n\nHoward Thompson of The New York Times wrote: \"This is a handsome picture, well-performed and emotionally intriguing ... However, for a drama so sharply and ironically concerned with human foibles, in business, love and marriage, it lacks real culminative power.\"[5] Variety stated that \"the more discriminating film-goer will find 'From the Terrace' seriously deficient. Whether the fault lies with O'Hara's basic material or Ernest Lehman's screenplay is difficult to assay by a reviewer who skipped the novel ... On the assumption that Lehman followed the O'Hara story closely, the blame must be placed squarely on the novelist, for 'From the Terrace' builds up to one big cliche.\"[6] Philip K. Scheuer of the Los Angeles Times wrote that the film \"has been bolstered a degree above soap opera by its creators and does make a point of sorts against modern materialism\", though \"one is left with the feeling that its makers were not able to compress the portions that they have used into a drama of much consequence or climax\".[7] Richard L. Coe of The Washington Post called the film \"an interminable essay on the horrors of money, love, and sex\", with a story that \"has more gaps than a dial phone\".[8] Harrison's Reports was positive, declaring it \"Outstanding entertainment ... It is loaded with brilliant dialogue, expert acting, human interest, suspense, and some comic touches.\"[9] The Monthly Film Bulletin called it \"a seriously deficient film. After a long prologue devoted to providing a motivation for Alfred's obsessive pursuit of wealth (in the course of which Myrna Loy's thorough portrayal of alcoholic misery becomes a stiff price to pay for what amounts to very meagre enlightenment), the film builds up to a shapeless monument of banality.\"[10] John McCarten wrote in The New Yorker that \"Mr. Robson's direction is, except for the first few scenes, unimaginative. But then, the screenplay Mr. Lehman has come up with would hardly inspire anybody.\"[11]\n\nJoanne Woodward later admitted to having \"affection\" for the film \"because of the way I looked like Lana Turner.\"[12] Her glamorous costumes were designed by Travilla.\n\nThe film holds a score of 31% on Rotten Tomatoes based on 13 reviews.[13]\n\nAdditional films that Paul Newman and Joanne Woodward made together:\n\nThe Long, Hot Summer (1958)\n\nRally 'Round the Flag, Boys!
