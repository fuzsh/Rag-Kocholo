        "text": "What is woosah? Or What is woosa?\n\nWhat is the woosah meaning in english? Whether you spell it woo sah, woosahh, or woosah, the expressive word means the same thing.\n\nYou can find the definition of woosah in the urban dictionary:\n\nWoosah is a feeling of calm or peace. The term woosah was made popular by Martin Lawrence and Will Smith in the movie Bad Boys II when Martin Lawrence's character, Marcus Burnett, demonstrates how to regain your calm in an anger-filled situation. The phase continued to be used as a joke later in the Bad Boys franchise.\n\nWoosah Meaning\n\nSome may ask, Is Woosah a real word? And if so, what does woosah mean? The slang term woosah is often used to describe the feeling of relief or calmness in the midst of chaos. In other words, it's the opposite of feeling stressed out. People are encouraged to find their woo-sahh or wusa meaning calm down. Finding one's wooo saah means eliminating anger.\n\nWorking On My Woosah is a reminder to slow down and take a deep breath when things get stressful.\n\nWorking On My Woosah Mental Health T-Shirt\n\nIf I lost my woosah, how do I get it back?\n\nWhether you're a parent juggling energy filled kids, a boss managing an office full of employees, the friend who everyone always calls on for help, or all of the above, losing one's woosah can be easy to do. There are a few things that you can try that might help you get your wooh sah back!\n\nOne of the fastest ways to find relaxation in the midst of chaos is to just take a few deep breaths. It sounds so simple, but it really works. Just taking a few seconds to focus on your breath and slow down can help you feel calmer and more centered. Follow the steps below to give it a try!\n\nTake a moment, close your eyes and inhale slowly through your nose to the count of four letting your lungs fill with as much air as possible,\n\nHold that breath for a moment, then exhale to the count of six\n\nAs you continue to breathe in this pattern, let your shoulders drop and relax the muscles in your face & neck.\n\nAfter just a few cycles, you should feel yourself starting to relax.\n\nThis is a simple exercise that can help you calm down in a moment of stress or anger, but remember if you're dealing with a recurring stressful situation you might find a stress or anger management class helpful.\n\nIt's impossible to completely eliminate anger from our lives, in fact that would be an unhealthy extreme. Anger, like all of our emotions serves a purpose, but working on your woosah is about maintaining balance and understanding how not to let your emotions take over your life in unhealthy ways.\n\nWorking On My Woosah Sweatshirt\n\nLisa, shared a personal story about how she lost and then reclaimed her Woosah!\n\n\"I'm not sure about you, but I often find myself in the midst of chaos. Whether it's at work, at home, or in my personal life, there always seems to be some sort of drama going on. And in the midst of all that drama, it can be hard to find any sort of relaxation. But I've found that there are a few things that can help me find my woosah in the midst of all the chaos.\n\nOne thing that always helps me relax is yoga. I know, I know, yoga isn't for everyone. But there's something about getting into those poses and just focusing on my breath that really helps center me. And even if I can't make it to a yoga class, there are plenty of yoga apps that I can use at home.\n\nAnother thing that helps me relax is spending time with my animals. I have two dogs and a cat, and they always seem to know when I'm feeling stressed out. Just petting them and playing with them for a few minutes can really help me feel more relaxed.\"\n\nNo matter what your woosah definition is, when life gets too hectic, it's important to take a step back and find moments of relaxation. For some, this means zoning out in front of the TV or taking a long bath. For others, it might mean taking a walk outside, reading a good book or watching a funny movie like Bad Boys and remembering the woosah meaning origin. No matter what you do to relax, the most important thing is that you make time for yourself.\n\nAnd if it's hard for you to remember to reclaim your Woosah, try grabbing something from our Woosah Collection.
