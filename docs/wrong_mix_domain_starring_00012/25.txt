British actor Nicholas Hoult, who plays Colin Firth's love interest in A Single Man, has joined the cast of the new Mad Max movie.

Zoe Kravitz, Teresa Palmer and Adelaide Clemens also are in various states of negotiations to join Fury Road, which comes from series writer-director George Miller.

The movie is set a short while after the story detailed in 1985's Mad Max: Beyond Thunderdome, which keeps Mad Max - the character originated by Mel Gibson - relatively young.

Details are being kept quiet, but it is known that Hoult's character is named Nux.

Kravitz, whose character's name is Five Wives, Palmer and Clemens are in a convoy being chased by bad guys.

Charlize Theron and Tom Hardy are starring in the picture, which will shoot in Australia this year.

Warner Bros will distribute.
