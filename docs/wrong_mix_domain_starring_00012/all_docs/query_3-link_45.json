        "text": "ARTICLE\n\nMachine Gun Preacher: Sam Childers Talks About His Biopic, His Life and His Work in Sudan\n\nIn 1998, a former gang biker named Sam Childers joined a church mission trip to the Sudan to help repair huts damaged in the Second Sudanese Civil War. Most of the people on that trip finished their charitable labors and left Africa behind, but Sam didn’t — not completely.\n\nREVIEW\n\nMad Max: Fury Road (2015)\n\nIn the first act of Mad Max: Fury Road, Tom Hardy’s Max spends more time than you might expect strapped helplessly to the front of a turbo-charged Chevy coupe, maniacally driven by a fanatic through a hellish landscape, an unwilling witness to the chaos ensuing around him. Sitting in the theater, I felt about the same way, I think.\n\nREVIEW\n\nMaid in Manhattan (2002)\n\nHe’s a wealthy, unattached scion of a political dynasty; she’s a hard-working maid whose mother and workplace \"sisters\" discourage her from yearning for more. An updated \"Cinderella\" story in the Pretty Woman mold, Wayne Wang’s Maid in Manhattan (Columbia) makes agreeably diverting viewing for most of its 105-minute running time, though after the magic runs out at midnight the movie meanders through an autopilot resolution that lacks a glass slipper.\n\nREVIEW\n\nMake Way for Tomorrow (1937)\n\nAny time I run across a list of movies people probably haven’t seen but should, one title I look for is the Catholic director Leo McCarey’s forgotten humanist masterpiece Make Way for Tomorrow.\n\nREVIEW\n\nMaleficent (2014)\n\nIt’s fair to say that Disney’s Maleficent plays to an extent as warmed-over Frozen. This is not a good thing, even, I think, if you are a fan of Frozen.\n\nARTICLE\n\nMaleficent, Rape and Sympathy for the Devil\n\nA story like this demands to be seen through the lens of what biblical scholars call “redaction criticism,” which basically means “What was changed, added or deleted in this retelling of the story, and what do those changes tell us about the storyteller’s intentions and outlook?”\n\nREVIEW\n\nA Man Escaped (1956)\n\nAs he did in his prior Diary of a Country Priest, Bresson faithfully adapts his source material, but he also appends a subtitle to A Man Escaped — The Wind Blows Where it Wills, an allusion to Jesus’ discourse in John 3 about being born of water and the Spirit — and rechristens the protagonist (whose real name was André Devigny, and is played by François Leterrier) “Fontaine,” fountain. Clearly, like Diary, A Man Escaped is intended as a reflection on spiritual bondage, rebirth, and the mysteries of grace and providence, as much as about stone walls and iron bars.\n\nREVIEW\n\nA Man for All Seasons (1966)\n\nThe screenplay, well adapted by Robert Bolt from his own stage play, is fiercely intelligent, deeply affecting, resonant with verbal beauty and grace. Scofield, who for years starred in the stage play before making the film, gives an effortlessly rich and layered performance as Sir Thomas More, saint and martyr, the man whose determined silence spoke more forcefully than words, and who then spoke even more forcefully by breaking it.\n\nREVIEW\n\nMan on Fire (2004)\n\n\"In the Church they say to forgive,\" one character observes dubiously. But in Creasy’s book, to forgive is divine, to mutilate and butcher human. \"Forgiveness is between them and God,\" he says, conveniently overlooking the relevant biblical injunctions even though we know he can quote chapter and verse when he wants to. \"My job is to arrange the meeting.\" We know we should agree with Creasy, because his murderous rampage is scored by a cool rock soundtrack and sanctified by a mother’s kiss. That’s got to be righteous.\n\nREVIEW\n\nMan on the Train (2002)\n\nThanks to the skills of director Patrice Leconte, L’Homme du train (Man on the Train) would have made an excellent silent film, except that we would have missed the enchanting tones of Jean Rochefort’s retired poetry teacher, Monsieur Manesquier. Manesquier talks like a schoolboy who has yet to leave behind his school days — his rich words and phrases touch on his dreams and wishes, and are charmingly tinged with sexual innuendo and self-deprecation. Rochefort’s characterization is perfectly complemented by Johnny Hallyday’s stoic career criminal, Milan, who responds to questions with either silence or sapient, terse words."
