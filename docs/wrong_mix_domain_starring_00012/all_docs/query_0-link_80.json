Maybe they're hoping that movie-goers disappointed by sell-outs at the latest Star ...\n\nCurrent War, The\n\nYou may have seen a trailer for The Current War a couple of years ago – that’s because, in its original incarnation, it was expected to reach theaters during the 2017 Oscar Season. One of the planned year-end releases of the now-defunct Th...\n\nDark Phoenix\n\nFor longtime fans of the X-Men comic books, “The Dark Phoenix Saga” has been the Holy Grail. As crafted by Chris Claremont and John Byrne (with an assist from Dave Cockrum), the epic narrative, which was a major element of The Uncanny X-Me...\n\nFavourite, The\n\nWith a sly wit and a dark edge, director Yorgos Lanthimos plunges into the murky waters of early 1700s British politics, where few positions were more enviable and less stable than being the queen’s favorite (or, in Brit-speak, “favourite�...\n\nJack the Giant Slayer\n\nJack the Giant Slayer is an enjoyable fantasy/adventure whose magic is partially undermined by marginal 3-D.
