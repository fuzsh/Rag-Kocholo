        "text": "When most people look back at Stanley Kubrick's best films, they think of A Clockwork Orange, The Shining, 2001: A Space Odyssey, andâ€¦Babe?\n\nMad Max: Fury Road director George Miller has revealed that Kubrick helped him on the film during a long series of phone conversations back in the mid-'90s, according to The Hollywood Reporter.\n\nSpeaking about the director, Miller said he had \"never met him\", but had \"lots and lots of conversations on the phone\" during the making of the movie.\n\n\"Back when we were doing Babe, pre-digital, we didn't know how to make the pig speak,\" he explained. \"I knew that the story had to be done live-action, because it didn't lend itself to a kind of classic kinetic animation, cel animation.\n\n\"I explained [to Kubrick] we're trying to make a pig talk. He was particularly caught up with the technology of not cutting on videotape. But he was one of those people who just kind of sucked in the world by conversations.\n\n\"Every night, we'd sit and talk for a long, long time and talk about the process and I knew he was very, very intrigued about what could be happening.\"\n\nMiller also compared Babe to Tom Hardy's Mad Max in Fury Road, saying they are both \"heroic\" characters.\n\n\"Babe in both stories fitted the pretty classic hero myth. And that's another connection to the Mad Max films, particularly The Road Warrior.\n\n\"Max is a reluctant hero but he is the agent of change. But Babe is the classic hero,\" he added."
