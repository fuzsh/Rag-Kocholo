        "text": "Staff Picks: Best Films of the Year\n\nThe Academy has spoken, nominating 8 films for Best Picture at the 88th Academy Awards: The Big Short, Bridge of Spies, Brooklyn, Mad Max: Fury Road, The Martian, The Revenant, Room and Spotlight. As the staff at the Frank Banko Alehouse Cinemas, we have our predictions on who will win the awards — although the nominees aren’t necessarily our favorite films or performances of the year. You can check out our picks for best films of the year below.\n\nFrom now through the awards ceremony (and beyond) we’re showing the best of the nominees. CLICK HERE FOR CURRENT FILM TIMES\n\nThen on February 28, join us for THE RED CARPET PARTY! A night of stars, prizes and fun as we simulcast the 88th Academy Awards – and the Red Carpet arrivals leading up to them – in our cinemas!\n\nRYAN HILL – Programming Director\n\n1) Inside Out\n\nI feel that 2015 was a year of B+ movies, with few As, and only one A+. Inside Out was that A+, a brilliantly-conceived and executed film on all levels.\n\n2) Tangerine\n\nMaybe Tangerine doesn’t have the best script, but it far and away had the most electricity of any film I’d seen in quite some time. I’d want to show Tangerine to anyone even mildly interested in making movies.\n\n3) Spotlight\n\nMuch like Inside Out, the people behind Spotlight knew when to ease off on the melodrama pedal, and wisely but effectively told an incredibly important story. Add to it excellent acting and deft direction, and you get a piece of narrative cinema that is arguably much more impactful than any documentary on the subject could ever be.\n\n4) Clouds of Sils Maria\n\nThe 2015 movie I spent the most time thinking about, hands down. Incredible acting from Juliette Binoche and Kristen Stewart.\n\n5) What We Do in the Shadows\n\nWith the possible exception of Trainwreck (which would have been #11 or #12 on a longer list), I didn’t laugh harder at a movie in 2015. An excellent sendup of our fascination with vampires.\n\n6) Ex Machina\n\nThe dance scene = the best scene of 2015. Nope, that one isn’t better.\n\n7) Mad Max: Fury Road\n\nThe movie that gave me hope for big budget movie-making, or at least that I might actually enjoy some future big budget movies. Also, a mainstream action movie I’m excited to show my nieces someday soon… haven’t been able to say that in maybe ever.\n\n8) Mistress America\n\nI rank Frances Ha as my favorite film of the past 5 years, so Mistress America had a lot to live up to. It didn’t quite make it thanks to what I felt was a strangely-paced 20 minutes in the middle of the film (when all are at the really nice house outside of the city), but the Baumbach/Gerwig team still wins overall.\n\n9) Brooklyn\n\nI still can’t believe a simple love story captivated me like this one did.\n\n10) 45 Years\n\nA lot of people are talking about Phoenix’s final scene in their top 10 lists, and though I agree with them, the rest of that film doesn’t hold up as well to me. 45 Years, on the other hand, has a gut-punch of a final shot that’s been preceded by a beautifully-paced acting master class from Charlotte Rampling and Tom Courtenay. It’s slow, but so rewarding.\n\nJust missed: Carol, Room, Trainwreck, Amy\n\nLauren McAloon – Performing Arts Coordinator\n\n1) Brooklyn\n\nThis is a solid film, plain and simple. It is a very well told story that is extremely well acted by Saoirse Ronan.\n\n2) Inside Out\n\nI was most excited to see this film in 2015. Pixar put such a complicated story on the screen in such a simple, imaginative way. Very emotional and funny, everyone will take something away from it.\n\n3) Carol\n\nWatch this solely for the set design and costume design if nothing else! The two leads prove that they would win any staring contest. Incontestable pair that deserves to be watched and understood by everyone.\n\n4) Clouds of Sils Maria\n\nInteresting dynamics between Kristen Stewart and Juliette Binoche. I was present from beginning to end.\n\n5) Phoenix\n\nThe best part of Phoenix is the last two minutes. What an awesome ending. Nina Hoss plays her character with a perfect juxtaposition of sadness and hope.\n\n6) Mad Max: Fury Road\n\nAmazing landscapes, incredible imagination and awesome use of color. I spent the first half of the movie thinking what am I watching, but in a good way! This will definitely be popular for years to come. Tom Hardy, you keep going!\n\n7) The Revenant\n\nBeautiful cinematography that accentuates the hardships that the characters face in this redemption film. You can tell it’s the first time Leo has eaten a raw bison liver and it sticks with you.\n\n8) Ex Machina\n\nSurprising, interesting, smart science fiction tale that only has three main characters and a lot of plot twists. One of the only roles this year that Domhnall Gleeson should have taken. Also, Oscar Isaac dances.\n\n9) Tangerine and Girlhood\n\nBoth films are shot extremely well with limited resources. Tangerine shot on an iPhone and with non-actors pushes you into an underground world of L.A. that most people overlook. The principle actors bring a lot of attitude and personality to the roles. If you are in the mood to watch something off the beaten track this is it. Girlhood is a simple yet powerful coming of age story that touches on a gentle turned rebellious teen trying to make her way in life. Great acting from the lead actor, Karidja Touré.\n\n10) What We Do in the Shadows\n\nThis is one of the best underrated comedies of 2015. Jemaine Clement and Taika Waititi poke fun at vampire pop culture using a single camera setup to show aging vampires and how they go about their day to day lives. Hilarious and sweet: a must see as usual.\n\nWhat I’m still looking forward to: Mustang and Room\n\nAnthony DeSanctis – Cinema & Comedy Assistant\n\n1) Inside Out\n\nA funny yet insightful take on psychological tics both common and complex, and what’s more impressive is that it’s easily the most emotionally mature and heartbreaking film I’ve seen this year. Delightful from beginning to end, and also Kyle MacLachlan.\n\n2) The Martian\n\nAn incredibly pleasing, touchingly human, genuinely thrilling masterwork. A winning script, great performances, excellent direction, sincere moments of levity with not a moment wasted.\n\n3) Room\n\nThe greatest emotional gut punch of the year. Brie Larson deserves Best Actress for this heartbreaking and haunting films that stays with you for days after it ends.\n\n4) Mad Max: Fury Road\n\nWarner Bros. gave 70 year-old George Miller $180,000,000 to go in to the desert for sixth months and make a movie and he comes back with this two hour adrenaline rush. This is easily one of the greatest action films ever made.\n\n5) Spotlight\n\nA tight and well-crafted look at one of the greatest scandals of the 21st century and the journalists who uncovered it. Director Thomas McCarthy’s subtle yet thrilling procedural grabs you emotionally and refuses to let go.\n\n6) Brooklyn\n\nThis is a simple story, well told. Easily one of the most beautifully shot films of the year and perhaps one of, if not THE, biggest crowd-pleasers of the year.\n\n7) Star Wars: The Force Awakens\n\nJJ Abrams did it! Aside from a few moments of “fan service at the expense of the plot”, it’s unquestionably the best Star Wars movie since Return of the Jedi.\n\n8) Ex Machina\n\nA smart, sly and sophisticated piece of science fiction, destined to be a cult classic. This is also the year of Alicia Vikander; where have you have been all my life?!\n\n9) Creed\n\nRyan Coogler returns the Rocky franchise to its glory with this spin-off, which he blends his style the best qualities of the original Rocky film. Sylvester Stallone hands over the Rocky reigns to a man with strong respect for the source material, as well as directing Michael B. Jordan and Stallone to potential Academy Award nominations.\n\n10) Kingsman: The Secret Service\n\nWho would have ever thought Colin Firth could be such a badass? Nonstop fun from start to finish, this over the top love letter to the great spy movies of the past displays Matthew Vaughn’s effortless ability to blend over the top style with rich substance.\n\nLawrence Milano – Cinema & Comedy Assistant\n\nEven though there aren’t 10 films from the past year that I feel are worth mentioning, here are 7 that I truly enjoyed and stuck with me.\n\n1) Mad Max: Fury Road\n\nBoth visually stunning and poetic, Mad Max is a relentless adventure that is able to tell a story just by its breathtaking imagery. It’s truly daring filmmaking on all levels.\n\n2) Ex Machina\n\nThe soundtrack, the imagery, everything. It’s a near perfect film.\n\n3) The Hateful Eight\n\nThe quickest three hours of my life. Seeing the Roadshow version of the film wasn’t just an ordinary movie going experience, it was an adventure. It captured the emotions you’re supposed to have when watching a movie. Also, the writing, the acting, and the incredible soundtrack makes this one hell of a piece of work.\n\n4) Amy\n\nThe exploitation and collapse of one of the music industry’s most talented participants is all exposed here. The film is heartbreaking and alarming.\n\n5) Love\n\nI think I’m just a sucker for Gapser Noe films in general, so I’m a bit biased. This film is another experimental and ambitious project from the French director and holds no punches in subject matter or explicit imagery.\n\n6) The Wolfpack\n\nA beautiful and haunting observation of a unique American family.\n\n7) Montage of Heck\n\nThis film removes, in my opinion, the God-like complex of Cobain and instead, paints him as just another individual who lead a life of poor decision making, but at the same time, managed to leave an incredible impact on the entire music industry and remains to be one of my favorite musicians of all time."
