        "text": "Engulfed in a thick fog of tension, A Quiet Place is an early contender for the best horror film of 2018.\n\n⭐ ⭐ ⭐ ⭐\n\nRhys Graeme-Drury\n\nThe best horror movies are those that prey on very basic, primal fears; things like don’t breathe, don’t blink or don’t move. In A Quiet Place, writer/actor/director John Krasinski implores his audience and his characters to not make a sound. The film, set in the not-too-distant future, centres around a family who must navigate their lives in total silence after the world is overrun by vicious creatures who hunt via noise, where even the slightest tremor or tinkle could alert them to your presence.\n\nKrasinski really sells us on this bleak and unforgiving future. The fear and dread conveyed with every creaking floorboard or crunchy leaf underfoot is immediately arresting, and effective direction from Krasinski, in only his third feature film, envelops the theatre, getting under your skin and putting you on edge right from the get-go. Few films are as adept as crafting tension as A Quiet Place; prepare to peer though your fingers, dig your nails into the armrest and squirm like you’ve got an eel in your undies.\n\nA distinct lack of a dialogue – the characters communicate via subtitled American Sign Language –means the viewer is scanning the auditory soundscape for every scuffle and snarl as much as they are probing the frame for shadows. The absence of dialogue shifts the focus onto the facial expressions of the actors, as well as the subtle and unnerving sound design. Rising to the occasion, Krasinski and real-life as well as onscreen wife Emily Blunt are great in conveying this paralysing terror through their performances.\n\nThere are more than a few hair-raising jump scares that punctuate the tension, and the film doesn’t waste time in getting to the point; an in medias res prologue sets the scene before leaping ahead several months to establish the family in their new normal; fishing in the river and washing laundry all in total silence.\n\nAnd while the film is light on specifics – this isn’t a sci-fi/thriller that goes to great lengths to explore the how and why of its gruesome antagonists – it also isn’t a horror film where you never get a good look at the predator lurking in the bushes. The most immediate and obvious comparison is Ridley Scott’s Alien – the fear of the unknown and the undefeatable pervades every scene – but JJ Abrams’ Super 8 and M. Night Shyamalan’s Signs also spring to mind.\n\nAn overreliance on Marco Beltrami’s strings signposts some of the biggest scares and the rather simplistic concept feels a little strung out across the 95-minute runtime, with the finale arriving in a hurry, but this is a compelling and gruesome creature feature from Krasinski, and one that will enthral genre fans and general audiences alike.\n\nA Quiet Place is available in Australian cinemas from April 5\n\nImage courtesy of Paramount Pictures\n\nElle Cahill\n\nBack in October, tinsel town’s illusion of glitz and glamour was shattered when multiple women accused heavyweight Hollywood producer and Weinstein Company co-founder Harvey Weinstein of sexual assaults that dated back to the 1990’s. Ever since, a growing number of women have added to the accusations against Weinstein, which has led many to making claims against other Hollywood veterans for similar behaviour.\n\nHollywood has long been plagued by filmmakers who have toed the line when it comes to inappropriate sexual behaviour, but the response to today’s accusations varies greatly to transgressions that have happened in the past.\n\nWeinstein was fired from the Weinstein Company almost immediately, although he continues to deny any wrongdoing. After Kevin Spacey was accused of making sexual advances towards actor Anthony Rapp when he was just 14 years old (Rapp is now 47), Spacey was dropped like a hotcake from Netflix original series House of Cards, and was also replaced by Christopher Plummer in Ridley Scott’s current release All the Money in the World, just mere weeks before it’s premiere.\n\nWoody Allen, on the other hand, was accused of paedophilia by his adopted daughter Dylan Farrow roughly a quarter of a century ago. Since then, he has gone on to release more than 25 films (almost 1 per year), and has been nominated for numerous film awards, including his Oscar win in 2012 for Midnight in Paris.\n\nRoman Polanski is another filmmaker who has continued to work in the film industry despite pleading guilty in 1979 to raping a 13-year-old girl, and fleeing the United States to avoid sentencing. An additional five women have since made accusations against him for raping them as children.\n\nThe reactions to these perpetrators are largely misaligned, and while this may have something to do with the timing of the accusations against them, the fact is no one should be quietly slipping under the radar. If some filmmakers and actors are being pulled from projects, like director Brett Ratner, who has been dropped by Warner Bros. Studios, then shouldn’t all those accused of sexual misconduct be removed from projects? What’s more, who determines if or when these offenders should be given the opportunity for forgiveness and be permitted to work in the industry again? These are two important questions that need to be answered, and fast.\n\nAnd what about the women who have been sexually assaulted? The media has mostly focused on the perpetrators, while all but ignoring the victims. Ashley Judd and Mira Sorvino’s careers were ultimately derailed by Weinstein, which has been supported by director Peter Jackson who was personally encouraged by Weinstein not to work with either actress. What compensation will they receive for his actions and the destruction of their livelihood? What about the female comedians who CK Louis decided it was appropriate to masturbate in front of? What possible compensation could they receive to make his actions forgivable? And what about long time offenders who have long been forgotten about, like Allen and Polanski? Is now the time we call them out for their past behaviour, or is it too little too late?\n\nThe questions surrounding the issue are endless, but there are three major problems that need to be dealt with in the imminent future. First, the notion of the “casting couch” – where an employer demands sexual favours from an employee in return for career advancement – needs to cease. It’s old, out-dated and disgusting. Second, there needs to be an understanding throughout the industry that no other person has the right to another person’s body without that person’s express permission, and this then needs to be reflected in mainstream entertainment. Finally, there needs to be available support, not only for the victims, but also for those who are in danger of committing sexual assault and it needs to be provided without judgement or persecution.\n\nHollywood has a great responsibility here. How it chooses to proceed and deal with these issues will surely impact how other industries deal with similar situations. It’s a lot of pressure, so let’s hope they get it right.\n\nImage courtesy of Netflix & House of Cards\n\nRidley Scott’s first feature since Alien: Covenant is a confident reminder that the filmmaker can do a lot more than science-fiction.\n\n⭐ ⭐ ⭐ ⭐\n\nZachary Cruz-Tan\n\nAll the Money in the World speaks a universal truth; that all the money in the world cannot, and will not, buy you love. It could buy you happiness, sure. Build several mansions and fill them with whatever your heart desires. Even Ebenezer Scrooge would invert his scowl. But love, that requires work, and according to All the Money in the World, Jean Paul Getty just didn’t have the time.\n\nGetty is played by Christopher Plummer, who had to replace Kevin Spacey less than a month before the movie’s release, but it looks like the role was always meant to be his. Plummer, who was 87 when he was dragged onto set, can surely endorse the fountain of youth. His scenes were reshot in nine days, and he is so comfortable playing a miserly billionaire you’d expect him to have been one his whole life.\n\nThe film follows Getty as he tries (or doesn’t try) to negotiate the $17 million ransom for his grandson’s life. Abducted by members of ‘Ndrangheta in 1973, John Getty III (Charlie Plummer) was a boy lost among monsters. The experience traumatised him so badly he became addicted to drugs and alcohol and eventually died in 2011 from complications of both. Getty could’ve easily paid up and saved his grandson’s life if he hadn’t valued things more than family.\n\nAll the Money is about that divide between what is valuable to someone and inconsequential to someone else. John Getty III’s mother, Gail (Michelle Williams), is expectedly frantic, and some of the film’s best scenes are about Gail’s futile battles with Getty and his mob of attorneys. It’s hard to imagine someone being so nonchalant about their family’s wellbeing, and yet some of the arguments Getty makes seem to be sensible. “I have fourteen grandchildren”, he explains, “If I paid the ransom I’d soon have to pay thirteen others”.\n\nAll the Money in the World is directed by Ridley Scott, whose films tend to be hit-or-miss when they’re not science-fiction. This is much better than some of his grounded dramas (2013’s The Counsellor was particularly horrendous) perhaps because it’s about real people, real emergencies and real selfishness. It demonstrates precisely what money can and cannot do. I thought the writers had taken liberties with Getty’s meticulous accounting, but then I did some reading after the film, and to my surprise, they’re not far off at all. My goodness.\n\nAll The Money In The World is available in Australian cinemas from January 4\n\nImage courtesy of Roadshow Films\n\nVisually breathtaking, even 35 years later, Blade Runner rightly remains a science fiction classic.\n\nMichael Philp\n\nThe year is 2019, and smokestacks spout fire above Los Angeles. Below, the streets are bursting with life. Neon stalls and crowded markets suffer through rain and smog, flying cars purge themselves in filthy alleyways, and the all-seeing eye of an advertising blimp glides between the buildings. Towering above it all is the Tyrell Corporation’s ziggurat – a monument to the god of this new world, Dr Eldon Tyrell, the creator of more-human-than-human replicants.\n\nThese are the first images of Ridley Scott’s 1982 masterpiece, Blade Runner, and they are stunning. Better yet, over the next two hours, you get to witness imagery even more sumptuous and intriguing, while connecting with some of the richest characters in science fiction. We will follow grizzled Blade Runner Rick Deckard (Harrison Ford), as he tracks down and “retires” four escaped replicants – banned bioengineered androids. We will sympathise with those replicants and their search for life beyond their creator’s intentions. And ultimately, we will sympathise with Deckard as he struggles with a brutal system that cares little for the lives within it.\n\nVisually speaking, Scott never stops pushing his film. From those first flaming stacks to Roy Batty’s (Rutger Hauer) final monologue, near every frame of the movie is a feast for the eyes. The contrasted lighting helps immensely in this, setting a noirish mood that reflects the film’s oppressively dark and dirty world. An early bathroom scene particularly stands out, with a fluorescent tube gorgeously backlighting Deckard. Compare that shot to any number in Drive, and it’s clear that film-makers are still openly copying Blade Runner 35 years later – it’s just that cool.\n\nAside from the lighting, Scott is constantly filling the frame with detail and symbolism. Look out for numerous instances of eye imagery – a visual metaphor that suggests surveillance, humanity, and knowledge. Or perhaps you’d prefer something more subtle, like the fact that they modelled Eldon Tyrell’s bedroom on the Pope’s – something that immediately highlights the film’s religious themes. These little details all build upon one another, creating a rich tapestry of meaning. All of a sudden, Tyrell’s pet owl – also a bioengineered creation – becomes not only a symbol of his wealth, but also his knowledge and divine aspirations. These are the details that make Blade Runner such a beloved film. Repeat viewings are virtually mandatory for a film with this much depth.\n\nThe visuals would be empty though without talented actors backing them up, which is why it’s such a blessing that Blade Runner has one of the best performances of the 80’s in Hauer’s Batty. Larger than life, Batty is a magnificently complex creature. Deeply aware of his looming mortality and disposableness, Batty initially attempts to bargain with his creator, before finally rising above a system that considers him worthless. His bemused resignation at the end – a slight smile as he reminisces about the wonders he has seen – is one of the film’s crowning achievements, humanising him to an incredible degree. The life behind Hauer’s performance is awe-inspiring, particularly when taking into account the fact that Batty has had to fight for its recognition. The world sees him as nothing more than an off-world slave, making it even more powerful to watch Batty shed himself of those chains.\n\nBlade Runner is a behemoth of science fiction, and rightly so. It’s an incredibly rich film that takes science fiction concepts dating back to the original Frankenstein and depicts them with nuance and humanity. What right does anyone have to dictate who is and is not human? What right do we have to create life and then dictate its purpose? These questions are at the core of Blade Runner and are served well by some of the best visuals of Ridley Scott’s career. As we approach the release date of Blade Runner 2049, it’s amazing that the original film can still hold its weight. Here’s to hoping that its moments won’t all be lost in time.\n\nImage courtesy of Warner Bros\n\nRidley Scott reforges his covenant with the Alien franchise, but abandons the spark that once lit it up.\n\n⭐ ⭐ ½\n\nZachary Cruz-Tan\n\nAlien: Covenant follows on from Ridley Scott’s Prometheus and will no doubt lead into his classic Alien (1979), but it feels like a movie that has exhausted itself and run out of ideas. After thirty-eight years and seven films, how many new ways can there be to hide the dreaded monster in the dark and make it go “Boo!”?\n\nThe Alien movies ran their course by the time Aliens (1986) was done. Then Prometheus came about in 2012 carrying the Alien DNA and a bag full of new and exciting possibilities. Now Covenant arrives as the inevitable sequel and leaves all the promise of Prometheus behind. For those who found Prometheus to be a step too detached from the franchise, I suspect Covenant will be a comfort. But for those, like me, who enjoyed the new ground Prometheus was exploring, this movie will seem like a toothless clone of a once great empire.\n\nAlien was a fantastic film because it was patient and understood the mechanics of horror, which used space, lighting and pacing to draw us in to a perpetual state of anticipation. It employed the Jaws formula – by keeping the monster that could potentially eat the entire cast hidden for most of the film, its eventual revelation was shocking. Covenant dashes headfirst into the action, regularly foregoing any kind of build-up. We see the aliens up close and very often, many times in wide shots that reveal their entire humanoid physique. Yes, by now we are no longer strangers to what the aliens look like, but when you throw them at us from every direction and pay little attention to where they come from or how they emerge, the film simply becomes an action machine.\n\nYou could argue that Covenant, therefore, is more about its characters and continuing the story that was introduced in the previous film. This it does naturally. Michael Fassbender returns as an android, and we get a new ship with a new crew made up of familiar faces like Danny McBride, Billy Crudup, Demián Bichir and Katherine Waterston, though who they are is not as important as what they do. Most of what they do is a re-enactment of what all the past Alien crews have done: scream their heads off and run for their lives.\n\nI think by now we have all been Aliened-out, just like we’ve been Transformered-out and Pirates of the Caribbeaned-out. These pictures have crossed over into tired repetitiveness. Covenant is as well-made as any other big budget movie out there, with lots of tantalising visuals and ideas that are never developed or pushed to fruition. What it lacks is purpose and direction. It feels strangely eventless, as if two hours go by and we’re suddenly at the climax. If this had been the first of its kind, maybe it might’ve been something to remember. Unfortunately, its kind has been done and dusted, and then dusted some more.\n\nAlien: Covenant is available in Australian cinemas from May 11\n\nImage courtesy of Twentieth Century Fox\n\nFrom A Trip to the Moon to The Martian, science-fiction has powered the minds and hearts of this technological world for over a century.\n\nZachary Cruz-Tan\n\nMovies set in space have been around almost as long as the movies themselves, yet seem to be making a renaissance in this new decade. They began as litmus tests in the early 1900s, probing the boundaries of the imagination. Now, with new cinematic techniques and technological advancements, space films have become more serious, more astute, and dare I say it, more grounded.\n\nYes, Hollywood is still churning out your Star Wars and Star Treks, overflowing with monsters and creatures from beyond, but ever since the unprecedented success of Alfonso Cuarón’s Gravity in 2013 (still in my top 3 films of the decade so far), there has been at least one sombre, melodramatic sci-fi movie every year featuring hardworking human beings on a quest to better themselves. And they always seem to be aiming straight for one of those naked gold statuettes.\n\nWe’ve had hard-hitting space movies before. 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968) is a fine example. Most of it took place in the far reaches of the cosmos. Looking back at it now, if you can wrap your head around it, it certainly feels like Oscar-bait material. Then of course we were zapped by Star Wars in 1977 – certainly Oscar-bait material – snatching one of the few Best Picture nominations for what many at the time considered science-fiction mumbo jumbo. It literally blasted open the doorway to the modern Hollywood blockbuster and informed studio execs all over the States that it was cool and lucrative to send clueless people into space to do battle with hideous monsters.\n\nSo effective was this business model that within five years, Ridley Scott threw Sigourney Weaver at a drooling Xenomorph; Gene Roddenberry sanctioned the first ever Star Trek feature film; Spielberg’s alien phoned home; and both MGM and Paramount released space-themed sequels, one to James Bond, the other to Flying High! (1980), neither successful. The studios cashed in on George Lucas’ triumph without fully understanding what their money was buying; by the turn of the century they had burnt themselves out and the sci-fi engine was powered almost exclusively by the loyalty of placated Trekkies.\n\nWhat Gravity did in 2013 was re-humanise the science-fiction collective by slapping all the Warp Drives and lightsabres out of its system and replacing them with human beings and… other human beings. No evil red-eyed computers. No swishing and swooshing of laser swords. No distant solar systems inhabited by Romulans. It stripped the genre down and retrofitted it with state-of-the-art CGI, minimalist storytelling, and an empathetic human story about survival. And it worked, at least for the first couple of waves. After that everyone who loved the film overhyped it for their friends and stifled its popularity.\n\nThat, however, didn’t stop it from being nominated for ten Academy Awards (including Best Picture) and winning seven. Finally, a full-blooded sci-fi film racking up the trophies on awards night. And what did this success do? Inspire others, of course. That same year, Tom Cruise starred in Oblivion, about mankind’s last hope on a beleaguered Earth. That was followed swiftly by Christopher Nolan’s Interstellar, also about survival, set in deep space. It borrowed audio decisions almost directly from Gravity and enjoyed several Oscar nominations. Then The Martian swooped by in 2015, a film about Matt Damon once again requiring rescue services from the US government. It was nominated for Best Picture and, like Interstellar, shared some of Gravity’s dramatic flair. And now, this year, Denis Villeneuve directs Arrival, not exactly a space movie, but science-fiction nonetheless. Who knows – Arrival might usher in yet another phase of sci-fi progression, leading this well-worn but perpetually creative genre on for a brand new generation of stargazing dreamers. And if they ever get bored of astronauts spiralling untethered in space, they can always switch one channel up and enjoy Star Wars Episode XIV: The Never-Ending Disney Story.\n\nImage courtesy of Roadshow Films\n\nTo kick off the new year with a bang – and force ourselves to forget the terrible films we discussed in our last post – we’ve decided to now celebrate the greatest films of 2015. It was a long and arduous process to be able to bring you this list. We underwent a battle of wits; challenging one another with our varying opinions. We debated. We squabbled. Blood and tears were spilled (well, sort of… not really…) but we came through in the end to bring you the top 10 films of 2015 as voted by the Hooked On Film team. Enjoy!\n\n10. Ex Machina\n\nMaybe Oscar Isaac is the key to a successful Sci-Fi these days?\n\n“Ex Machina’s underlying intensity builds throughout the crackling keep-you-guessing narrative. Divided up via “Ava: Session…” titles, Garland’s taste for hyper-violence and psychosexuality hurls the audience into a twisted vision of the not-too distant future”. Read more\n\n9. Youth\n\nPaolo Sorrentino + Michael Caine + Harvey Keitel… do I really need to say anymore?\n\n“Others who can put up with darkly blunt revelations and sudden jumps between dream-like imagery and reality are in for an enormously rewarding experience, one that will perhaps cause them to look again at themselves and their own family – from the young to the old”. Read more\n\n8. 99 Homes\n\nAndrew Garfield may have 99 problems in 99 Homes, but his performance ain’t one!\n\n“99 Homes is so unrelentingly intense and scary that it could almost be labelled a horror movie. But this is a film grounded in reality, and perhaps the first to give us an honest look at the heartbreaking emotional turmoil that encompasses eviction.” Read more\n\n7. Selma\n\nIt don’t matter if you’re black or white.\n\n“David Oyelowo, a devout Christian, stated in an interview that he believes God called upon him to play Martin Luther King, Jr. Even non-believers will have a difficult time debating this after witnessing the actor ignite the screen”. Read more\n\n6. Sicario\n\nPrepare yourself for chills and thrills!\n\n“Sicario soon rumbles along with the tenacity and mercilessness of its core subjects. With the US Presidential election and US-Mexico relations key to world news, the film provides a fresh, blistering take on such a harrowing topic.” Read more\n\n5. Inside Out\n\nIt’s OK to be sad sometimes, but you’ll be feeling anything BUT sad after watching this!\n\n“Disney and Pixar have outdone themselves with this beautiful new idea that expresses how the mind works, and how personalities develop through memories and emotions. As Amy Poehler said; it’s so great to have a story tell children that it’s OK to feel sad sometimes, particularly in a world where all are so busy in the pursuit of happiness.” Read more\n\n4. Birdman\n\n“People, they love blood. They love action. Not this talky, depressing, philosophical bullshit” says the Birdman… well, this film begs to differ!\n\n“Birdman is a rare delight of a film that works on every level. Multilayered and incredibly complex beneath its darkly humorous surface, it represents a departure from the gloomy tone of Iñárritu’s previous films (21 Grams, Biutiful).Read more\n\n3. Mad Max: Fury Road\n\nIt’s a mad, mad, mad, mad, mad world… and it’s awesome!\n\n“As our heroes are pursued further into the barren deserts, Miller unleashes the full extent of his imagination in a series of astounding action scenes that transcend our expectations for modern filmmaking. Fury Road is a symphony of mayhem that effortlessly dances across the screen”.\n\nRead more\n\n2. The Martian\n\nSuck on this Interstellar. Ridley Scott > Christopher Nolan.\n\n“Every line in this film’s script radiates with wit, and Damon’s character in particular is given some hilarious quips to overcome his unbearable loneliness. There are more “laugh out loud” moments in The Martian than in most blockbuster comedies you will see this year.” Read more\n\n1. Star Wars: The Force Awakens\n\nThe Force is strong in JJ Abrams\n\n“This is precisely what tips The Force Awakens over the edge into greatness. Its mammoth plot is secondary; its likeable characters come to the fore. They are immensely interesting individuals who share on-screen chemistry, and have set up personal stories that are more than capable of going the distance of a trilogy.” Read more\n\nImages courtesy of Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures, Lucasfilm, Roadshow Films, Pixar Animations, Twentieth Century Fox, Madman Entertainment, Universal Pictures and StudioCanal\n\nOut of all the mainstream blockbusters I have seen this year, very few have resonated with me on a level that even comes close to Ridley Scott’s latest triumph.\n\n⭐ ⭐ ⭐ ⭐ ½\n\nKit Morris\n\nThis much is clear: everything Ridley Scott touches tends to turn to gold. Science fiction is in his very DNA with Alien (1979) and Blade Runner (1982) often found among titles named in the top movies of all time. Based on the 2011 novel by Andy Weir, Scott’s latest endeavour looks set to become a modern classic; one that I have every confidence will rank alongside some of his most notable works in future.\n\nIn The Martian, NASA’s human mission to the red planet turns catastrophic when botanist turned astronaut Mark Watney (Matt Damon) goes missing during an emergency evacuation, and is presumed dead. His crew flee the planet without him, but unbeknown to all, Watney survives. Our hero must endure his desolate new home with only journal entries and depleting food supplies to keep him sane.\n\nThis film is fundamentally Cast Away in space with the story of one human being defying the odds. Like Tom Hanks’ bedraggled Fed-Ex man, Watney is trapped and isolated in an inhospitable landscape, and encounters challenges to both the body and soul. He fights the elements, forages for food, and builds a suitable dwelling around himself as shelter from the harsh outside world, consequently becoming something of a cosmic Neanderthal, albeit a physically deteriorating one without any mental security.\n\nEvery line in this film’s script radiates with wit, and Damon’s character in particular is given some hilarious quips to overcome his unbearable loneliness. There are more “laugh out loud” moments in The Martian than in most blockbuster comedies you will see this year.\n\nPredictably, there are always going to be comparisons to recent big-hitters Interstellar and Gravity, which also paint the rich tapestry of space in glorious CGI. Unlike its forebears, however, The Martian is not bogged down with the familiar sub-plot of, “Oh, I miss my family!” This, of course, totally makes sense in the circumstances. If I was lost in deep space my thoughts would immediately lie with my family light years away, but unfortunately, it has become a well-worn device, and The Martian is all the better for its exclusion during its gripping 141 minute runtime.\n\nThe ensemble cast hail from very diverse backgrounds with science fiction stalwarts such as Damon, Jessica Chastain and Sean Bean holding their own alongside actors primarily known for comic roles, such as Jeff Daniels and Kristen Wiig, who are given a chance to stretch their versatile acting legs in memorable, and perhaps career-defining roles.\n\nOverall, this film is pure Oscar-bait; a blend of Scott’s electrifying storytelling with strong characters and stunning visual effects. 4 ½ stars.\n\nThe Martian is available in Australian cinemas from October 1st\n\nImages courtesy of Twentieth Century Fox\n\n“From the director that brought you Gladiator” is the tagline circling all marketing material for Exodus: Gods and Kings, but it seems Ridley Scott may have lost his touch lately. Exodus joins The Counselor, Prometheus and Robin Hood as recent Ridley Scott films that have failed to live up to expectations.\n\nReview by Cherie Wheeler\n\nRidley Scott’s epic adventure Exodus: Gods and Kings follows the traditional biblical story of Moses (Christian Bale), and his exile from Egypt by King Rhamses (Joel Edgerton). In a similar vein to Darren Aronofsky’s Noah from earlier this year, Scott has reimagined this religious tale with a multimillion dollar budget, and flashy visual effects.\n\nI have a genuine fondness for grand scale movies set in ancient times, and count titles such as Braveheart (1995) and Gladiator (2000) as some of my all time favourites, but these are rare examples of films that have managed to succeed in this genre. In 2014 alone, Hercules, 300: Rise Of An Empire and Pompeii have demonstrated how character development and narrative can so easily get lost to action sequences and spectacle, and whilst Exodus is certainly a much higher caliber of film than these, it sadly does not reach anywhere near the heights of the Academy Award winning films mentioned above.\n\nSimilar to Baz Luhrmann’s The Great Gatsby (2013), Exodus puts the majority of its efforts into production design, cinematography and special effects, and the result is a spectacular feast for the eyes. The sheer scale of this film is mind blowing with countless extras, multiple extreme wide shots of digitally recreated ancient Egypt, and fascinating attention to detail on costumes and set interiors. Joel Edgerton’s glamorous, jewel-encrusted, Egyptian outfits are particularly impressive.\n\nThere are hints of Scott’s innate brilliance as a director here and there, most notably in the way the plague scenes are shot and edited. One image that really stuck in my mind occurred during the parting of the sea, in which we see soldiers and horses floating lifelessly in the water from the viewpoint of the seafloor. For the most part, however, Exodus feels more like a typical Michael Bay blockbuster than a Ridley Scott film.\n\nWith the exception of Aaron Paul and Ben Kingsley, who each play supporting roles in Exodus, almost every actor is completely unrecognisable due to the efforts of the hair, makeup and wardrobe departments. I love going into a film with next to no knowledge of its storyline, the creatives behind it, or other people’s opinions, as it allows me to view the film objectively without any preconceived ideas. Prior to viewing Exodus, I did not know which actors would be filling the main roles, so for the first act I kept staring at Joel Edgerton, and couldn’t stop thinking; why are you so familiar? Eventually I realised that I was looking at the face of the Aussie actor from Felony (2014) and The Great Gatsby, but honestly, it was not until his name came up on the screen in the final credits that I truly believed it was him.\n\nEdgerton brought a ruggedness to the character, despite the fact that physically he looked quite feminine in eyeliner and sparkling jewellery, and at times he was really engaging, but then in other scenes his performance lacked credibility. I feel as though this inconsistency was apparent in all the performances, including that of Christian Bale, John Turturro, who plays Edgerton’s father, and Sigourney Weaver, who plays his mother, was the worst of all.\n\nThe most glaring weakness of the film is the convoluted script, which is far too long, and attempts to cover far too much content. The success of Gladiator stems from its well structured story, and its complex characters that are performed with excellence by Russell Crowe and Joaquin Phoenix. Many of the events throughout Gladiator are emotionally moving, and then there are other scenes that are thrilling, and some that are utterly terrifying. Exodus, on the other hand, fails to engage its audience on an emotional level, and simply sits flat on the screen as an entertaining spectacle, which is why I am giving this film 3 stars.\n\nAfter the disaster that was Grace of Monaco, it would have been nice to see Nicole Kidman redeem herself in this latest film of hers, but sadly, Before I Go To Sleep is filled with inconsistencies.\n\nReview by Chantal Victor\n\nBased on the best-selling novel by S J Watson, Before I Go To Sleep follows Christine Lucas (Nicole Kidman), who suffers from anterograde amnesia as a result of significant head trauma. Every night when Christine goes to bed, her mind is wiped clean of any memory created that day, leaving her with no memory of anything in her past. She has two men in her life; Ben Lucas (Colin Firth) who claims to be her husband, and psychologist Dr. Nash (Mark Strong), who tries to help her remember her past, including the person responsible for bringing about her accident. Produced by Ridley Scott (Prometheus), and directed by Rowan Joffe (28 Days Later, The American), the film revolves around Christine’s daily struggle with her memories, and her journey towards learning who she can really trust.\n\nBefore I Go To Sleep is marketed as a psychological thriller, and even though the concept of waking up every morning with no memory of your identity is suited to this genre, I don’t think this idea was conveyed to the audience as well as it could have been. A psychological thriller works well when you let the audience think about what is happening, and leave something to their imagination. Unfortunately, this film presented almost all of the information upfront; it puts all of the pieces of the puzzle together for you, and takes away all the mystery. In the end, only 10 minutes of this 92 minute film could actually be considered “thrilling”.\n\nAs always, Nicole Kidman plays the emotional damsel in distress, and does not bring anything to her performance that we have not seen before in her previous films, such as Moulin Rouge. Every day Christine records her new memories on camera, and then watches the videos back the following morning. She relives painful memories over and over again, and Nicole manages to portray this with emotional depth, however, her performance does leave the audience questioning certain actions performed by her character. At times Christine comes across as a frail married woman who is looking to men for any answers she can get, but then at other times she is a strong independent woman who is fighting for herself. I understand that characters can go through changes as a film progresses, but it should never happen at the flick of a switch, and leave audiences wondering how/why it has happened so quickly.\n\nThe performances from both Colin Firth and Mark Strong were more convincing than that of Nicole, but both showed signs of weakness at times. This may partially be because they don’t feature much in the film, and don’t really get time to develop their characters in front of the viewer. I believe if both actors had more screen time that the film may have slightly improved.\n\nTechnology plays a big role in this film purely because the only information Christine feels she can trust about her past are the videos that she records of herself. Some of the repetitive scenes of her using the camera are shot in an interesting way; one which stands out is where Christine is recording her memories of the day, and the entire frame is taken up by the LCD screen of the camera, leaving the shot as an extreme close-up. It allows the audience into her personal space, which can be very confronting.\n\nWhilst watching Before I Go To Sleep I was not left thinking about the nightmare of memory loss, or the frightening thought of losing the essence of oneself, and instead found myself focussing on the many flaws throughout the film. Even though the performances had some good moments, and the plot had a lot of potential, the execution of the narrative as a psychological thriller failed, which is why I give this film only 2 stars."
