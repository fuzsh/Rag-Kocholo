        "text": "The geeks shall inherit the cinema in 2015.\n\nAs if they need more power: The Comic-Con crowd that adores sci-fi, fantasy, action and comic-book movies already has made its presence felt in Hollywood recently, with 2012's The Avengers ($624 million) and 2014's Guardians of the Galaxy ($333 million) topping the box office in their respective years.\n\nThis year, though, promises to be over the top, with A-list features that include new chapters in the Avengers, Terminator, Jurassic Park and Star Wars franchises, plus a reboot of The Fantastic Four and Adam Sandler as a gamer in Pixels.\n\nAdd the potential drawing power of a seventh Fast & Furious flick, a 24th James Bond movie, a fourth Hunger Games and the first Fifty Shades of Grey, and it looks to be a record-breaking 12 months powered by what used to be considered a niche audience.\n\n\"Fanboys and fangirls are a force to be reckoned with, and in 2015 they're going to manifest and create the biggest box-office year ever,\" says Rentrak analyst Paul Dergarabedian, predicting that this summer will crack the $5 billion mark for the first time and the year overall could push past $11 billion domestically.\n\nHere are some highlights of 2015, where fans can indulge their passions for superheroes, secret agents, nightmarish machines, deadly dinosaurs and more (release dates are subject to studio changes).\n\nKingsman: The Secret Service (Feb. 13)\n\n• Director: Matthew Vaughn\n\n• Stars: Colin Firth, Taron Egerton, Samuel L. Jackson\n\n• Plot: Seasoned British agent Harry Hart (Firth) indoctrinates a youngster (Egerton) into the world of international espionage.\n\n• Fan fare: Based on the Mark Millar comic, Kingsman gives Firth a chance to show a side not seen in The King's Speech and Pride & Prejudice. Being a man of action — dangerous even with an umbrella — was \"intimidating\" says Firth, but he loved it, even after the six months of pain director Vaughn put him through to get into spy shape. \"He wanted me to do the (stunt) stuff, partly because it seemed so improbable to the world that I would ever be capable of it.\"\n\nAvengers: Age of Ultron (May 1)\n\n• Director: Joss Whedon\n\n• Stars: Robert Downey Jr., Chris Evans, Chris Hemsworth\n\n• Plot: Iron Man (Downey), Captain America (Evans) and the Avengers reassemble when one of their creations, a killer robot (voiced by James Spader) named Ultron, threatens mankind.\n\n• Fan fare: Struggling with flaws is an aspect of Marvel's cinematic heroes that makes them so interesting, says producer Kevin Feige. And Downey's Tony Stark is a futurist with a grand plan for the world, though his hubris often gets in the way in situations — such as creating Ultron to fight against such global threats as the alien attack on New York City in the first Avengers film. Stark \"wants to be prepared next time,\" Feige says. \"And how does Tony prepare for things? He invents things, and it doesn't always go well.\"\n\nMad Max: Fury Road (May 15)\n\n• Director: George Miller\n\n• Stars: Tom Hardy, Charlize Theron, Nicholas Hoult\n\n• Plot: In a land depleted of oil, water and other resources, Max (Hardy) is embroiled in a chase involving the mysterious warrior Furiosa (Theron), a group of young women and a deadly desert gang led by Immortan Joe (Hugh Keays-Byrne).\n\n• Fan fare: Whether it be his first Mad Max in 1981 or the new one, Miller says he finds \"a kind of psychotic pleasure\" in doing an over-the-top action film with tons of hot rods and explosions. \"It's like you're in the middle of a football match or something and you don't have time to say, 'Oooh, I just did a good move!' You've just got to go and do the next thing, otherwise you're in trouble.\" The director sees the same animal magnetism in Hardy that Mel Gibson had in the original Mad Max — \"You just can't keep your eyes off them because there's a dangerous charisma there.\" And Theron, who shaved her head for her role, was just as uncompromising as her Fury Road co-star. \"I don't think anyone has quite seen a female character like her.\"\n\nTomorrowland (May 22)\n\n• Director: Brad Bird\n\n• Stars: George Clooney, Britt Robertson, Hugh Laurie\n\n• Plot: A troubled girl and a genius inventor-turned-hermit discover a shared destiny that's connected to a magical far-away place.\n\n• Fan fare: Bird has been secretive about the film, partly, he says, because he likes it when other filmmakers tease rather than reveal. \"I love it when they're confident enough to drop a bra strap and let that be it.\" But, because Tomorrowland is a new and original film, the director wants to keep most of it away from audiences until they see it in May — though some folks would rather spoil aspects early. \"You want people to be surprised, and it's hard to do surprise now because everyone has mass communication at their fingertips.\"\n\nJurassic World (June 12)\n\n• Director: Colin Trevorrow\n\n• Stars: Chris Pratt, Bryce Dallas Howard, Judy Greer\n\n• Plot: With its visitor base declining, the island theme park laden with dinosaurs gets a refresh and a hybrid monster is created for an economic boost — with unforeseen and very unfortunate consequences.\n\n• Fan fare: The original Jurassic Park in 1993 featured themes of humans playing God, and the fourth movie in the franchise deals with the downside of that as well as excess. \"With miracles of science such as dinos, you don't have to up the 'wow' factor,'' says Trevorrow. \"This movie kind of exists to at least slap the characters around a bit and say, 'No, look around you, this is incredible.' \"\n\nTerminator Genisys (July 1)\n\n• Director: Alan Taylor\n\n• Stars: Emilia Clarke, Jai Courtney, Arnold Schwarzenegger\n\n• Plot: Kyle Reese (Courtney) is sent back in time to save Sarah Connor (Clarke) and prevent the machines of Skynet from taking over. He finds her and an aging \"Guardian\" Terminator (Schwarzenegger) already waiting for battle.\n\n• Fan fare: The \"reset\" of the Terminator franchise introduces an alternate timeline to James Cameron's original movie and starts a new trilogy. Yet while the villainous Skynet preyed on fear of a nuclear armageddon in the 1980s, Genisys finds it trying to win in a more modern way by taking advantage of our dependence on technology. \"If you look down at every single person who's on a smartphone, those technologies could actually be used to hand over the keys to Skynet to be able to drive your life,\" says producer David Ellison. Adds Taylor: \"For this one, we tried to couch the threat of the machine in things that we're more a part of and afraid of.\"\n\nAnt-Man (July 17)\n\n• Director: Peyton Reed\n\n• Stars: Paul Rudd, Michael Douglas, Evangeline Lilly\n\n• Plot: For the biggest heist of their lives, Hank Pym (Douglas) teams with thief Scott Lang (Rudd) and gives him a superhero suit that gives the wearer the ability to shrink in scale but increase in strength.\n\n• Fan fare: Like it did with the misfit crew of last year's Guardians of the Galaxy, Marvel introduces another unlikely hero to the mainstream — when film audiences first meet Scott Lang, he's walking out of prison. Yet Ant-Man is \"one of the most surprisingly emotional\" movies in the Marvel canon, says producer Kevin Feige. Lang has committed crimes that estrange him from his wife and 4-year-old girl, and Pym seeks a similar redemption with his own daughter (Lilly). \"Hank Pym invented the Ant-Man technology, went on many adventures and is now much older and trying to recruit a new person,'' says Feige. \"It's the first film we've made in which the story is about a torch being passed, essentially.\"\n\nThe Man From U.N.C.L.E. (Aug. 14)\n\n• Director: Guy Ritchie\n\n• Stars: Henry Cavill, Armie Hammer, Alicia Vikander\n\n• Plot: CIA agent Napoleon Solo (Cavill) and the KGB's Illya Kuryakin (Hammer) are bitter rivals who have to work together to bring down a villainous global organization.\n\n• Fan fare: The spy flick shares the Cold War geopolitical climate, cool gadgets and 1960s aesthetic with the old TV series, but Ritchie brings a \"fun, tongue-in-cheek humor,\" says Hammer, who brandishes an accent and speaks Russian in U.N.C.L.E. \"It was good to have something to think about and practice, especially when you're doing an action movie. A lot of it involves you running and stunts and jumping over things.\" His Illya is \"a tried-and-true Soviet spy — that is his life, that is his world, that is what he does and he's the best at it. But there is inherent humor in a man who finds no humor in anything.\"\n\nCrimson Peak (Oct. 16)\n\n• Director: Guillermo del Toro\n\n• Stars: Mia Wasikowska, Tom Hiddleston, Jessica Chastain\n\n• Plot: In 19th century England, a young woman (Wasikowska) is caught between a childhood pal (Charlie Hunnam), her jealous sister (Chastain) and a mysterious new man (Hiddleston) who takes her to his spooky ancestral place.\n\n• Fan fare: After playing with giant monsters (Pacific Rim) and a comic-book hero (two Hellboy movies), del Toro returns to his favorite genre — horror — with a Gothic romance and \"once-upon-a-time\" story that balances fairy-tale beauty and some scares. \"If you tell people these are the circumstances — there's a creaking, beautiful, haunted landscape and a monstrous house in the middle of that landscape — they'll say, 'Well, we can Google it or we will call them from a cell phone,' \" the director says. \"But if you're in the 19th century, the circumstances immediately trap you in a different set of tools.\"\n\nStar Wars: The Force Awakens (Dec. 18)\n\n• Director: J.J. Abrams\n\n• Stars: John Boyega, Daisy Ridley, Oscar Isaac\n\n• Plot: Lightsabers, droids and starships such as the Millennium Falcon return for a seventh Star Wars movie, set 30 years after Return of the Jedi."
