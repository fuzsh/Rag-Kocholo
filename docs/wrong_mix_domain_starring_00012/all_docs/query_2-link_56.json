        "text": "Firstly, this is a bit of a rant. The decade is only done at the end of 2020, but given that there are so many “mouth-breathers” out there we have a public consensus that the decade ends at the end of 2019. The AD calendar starts with 1 AD, not 0 AD. I will leave you to your own devices to figure out the rest.\n\nI also see all these Top 10 lists, but that is a appropriate for a year-end list and I will give the decade the reverence it deserves. My list will have the TOP 15 of the decade. As per normal, these are movies I actually watched and my list is never wrong (deal with it).\n\nThese are not full reviews, just a brief recap of my feelings.\n\n15. Sicario (2015)\n\nAn different take on the Mexican cartel from the perspective of law enforcement, intertwined with a story of the ultimate revenge. Beautiful cinematography from Roger Deakins, and as usual brilliant direction from Denis Villenueve.\n\n14. Looper (2012)\n\nThis was Rian Johnson’s introduction to the mainstream, and he kicked the door down with this take on time travel, love, pain and our general effect on the next person. Extremely rewatchable.\n\n13. Bridemaids (2011)\n\nStop giving me that look, probably one of the best comedies of the decade. This shot Melissa McCarthy into the world spotlight. Literally rolling on the floor laughing that this one.\n\n12. Warrior (2011)\n\nThe tale of estranged brothers and their alcoholic father and their collision at a high stakes MMA tournament, where they are fighting for redemption and the survival of their family. Tom Hardy & Nick Nolte really bring their A-game in this one.\n\n11. Wolf of Wall Street (2013)\n\nEasily the best movie of 2013, Martin Scorecese & Leonardo Di Caprio team up for life story of Jordan Belfort. Filled with depravity and excess, this rise and fall of people who sells hopes & dreams is at times humourous and ultimately sad.\n\n10. Inception (2010)\n\nHow do you get lost in a dream? Forget you are dreaming in the first place. Christopher Nolan plays with time and our minds, you will have a headache at the end of this one.\n\n9. Captain America: Winter Soldier (2014)\n\nMy first and only choice from the Marvel Cinematic Universe, yes you read that correctly now stop your crying. Winter Soldier isn’t only a great comic book movie, it is also an equally good spy movie. Robert Redford shows his talents to an audience who may never have heard of him.\n\n8. Whiplash (2014)\n\nThe first and best of Damian Chazelle, Myles Teller’s pursuit of perfection and JK Simmons’ Oscar winning performance will always resonate with me. It’s so dysfunctional and cringe-worthy you won’t be able to turn your head away from the screen.\n\n7. Spider-Man: Into the Spiderverse (2018)\n\nFor years to come this movie will discussed as one of the greatest animated features ever. The combination of animation styles and fan-friendly manipulation of the source material hits all the right notes.\n\n6. A Star is Born (2018)\n\nBradley Cooper brings everything to this movie, he directs, he acts, he writes his own music and blady hell he sings his own damn songs. This was a labour of love for him and I really felt it. The music tells as much of a story as the actors in it.\n\n5. Scott Pilgrim vs The World (2010)\n\nEdgar Wright’s video game come to life is possibly the best thing he will ever do? It holds up really well, with so many cameo performances from Brie Larson, Brandon Routh & Chris Evans it covers so many genres and hair colours.\n\n4. The Social Network (2010)\n\nIn hindsight Jesse Eisenberg should probably have one the Oscar here, his performance is way more memorable than Colin Firth (The King’s Speech). He carries this movie about the creation of the biggest social media platform that the world will ever see. David Fincher & Aaron Sorkin at their best.\n\n3. Mad Max: Fury Road (2015)\n\nA FLAME THROWING GUITAR, that should be enough. But one continuous car chase, Furiousa & Immorton Joe are the things that make this one an instant classic. George Miller is pure genius, and his love of Max is clear is for everyone to see.\n\n2. Joker (2019)\n\nDelving into the dark recesses of the mind of Arthur Fleck was delivered which brilliance by Joaquin Phoenix & director Todd Phillips (yes, The Hangover guy). A hateful society will produce hateful people.\n\nBefore I get to number one, there are a few notable mentions who missed out on my list. Lego Movie, Logan, Moonlight, Blade Runner 2049, Django Unchained, Get Out, Life of Pi, Baby Driver, Man of Steel, Manchester by the Sea & Argo.\n\n1. Arrival (2016)\n\nThis movie just amazing, I will just have you read our review here:\n\nhttps://bigscreenhooligans.com/2016/11/10/arrival-read-between-the-lines/\n\nWhat do think of my list?
