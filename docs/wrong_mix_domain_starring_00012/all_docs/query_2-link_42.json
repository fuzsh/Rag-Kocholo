        "text": "Just have a look at this list for 2015 guys. I think we should consider ourselves spoiled little kids for the upcoming year 2015. Our apetites will be wetted on many occasions with movies that have \"espionage\" written all over them. From a few spoofs, action plots in which a villain needs to be fought, a comic book adaptation, to realistic espionage thrillers.\n\nMoreover, it's especially funny to see how big name actors and directors suddenly love to be associated with spy movies. From Director Steven Spielberg to British actors Colin Firth, Hugh Grant, Liam Neeson and Henry Cavill.\n\nThe \"Spy/Action\" movies of 2015 (\"SPECTRE\" included):\n\n09.01.2015: \"Taken 3\" (action, thriller) --> with Liam Neeson, already very good reviews\n\n16.01.2015: \"Blackhat\" (espionage, thriller) --> with Chris Hemsworth\n\n13.02.2015: \"Kingsman: The Secret Service\" (action, spy spoof) --> director Matthew Vaughn\n\n20.03.2015: \"The Gunman\" (espionage, thriller) --> with Javier Bardem\n\n03.04.2015: \"Furious 7\" (action, thriller) --> with the late Paul Walker\n\n08.05.2015: \"Spooks: The Greater Good\" (espionage, thriller) --> with Game Of Thrones' Kit Harington\n\n22.05.2015: \"Spy\" (spy spoof) --> with Melissa McCarthy as Susan Cooper\n\n26.06.2015: \"Big Game\" (adventure, action) --> with Samuel L.
