        "text": "British actor Nicholas Hoult is one of those super cute up-and-coming movie star who seems hellbent on changing it up with every role. In fact, you might not have even recognized him as the disillusioned “war boy” Nux in Mad Max: Fury Road this weekend. Yes, that white-skinned, bald kid with the burning desire to entire Valhalla was Nicholas Hoult. No, really. It was.\n\nIf you’re itching for more Nicholas Hoult, then we’ve compiled five titles on streaming just for you. It’s kind of like a “meet cute” in a romantic comedy, but because it’s all streaming, we’re calling it your “meet queue.”\n\nAbout A Boy (2002)\n\nNicholas Hoult became an international darling at the age of twelve when he starred in About A Boy. Hoult played an exceedingly awkward boy named Marcus who weasels his way into Hugh Grant’s man-child’s life — and heart. Hoult gave one of those rare performance that was adorable, but not overly cloying or annoying. [Where to Stream About A Boy]\n\nSkins (2007 – 2008)\n\nLet’s just say that puberty was good to Nicholas Hoult; he went from being a dorky tween to devilishly handsome teen. Hoult’s next big move, then, was to reinvent himself as an actor who could play smarmy as easily as cute or “adorkable.” He played Tony Stonem in the first two seasons of the landmark British soap, Skins. Tony is as dastardly as he is charming and tends to get what he wants in life — no matter the cost. Hoult’s co-stars on the show included future stars like Dev Patel and Game of Thrones‘ Joe Dempsie (Gendry) and Hannah Murray (Gilly).\n\n[Watch Skins]\n\nA Single Man (2009)\n\nHoult solidified his status as both an actor and a heartthrob to watch when he appeared in a juicy supporting role in A Single Man. Holt played Kenny Potter, a dreamy-eyed college student who takes an interest in his older male teacher played by Colin Firth. He also wears the shit out of a fuzzy sweater. [Watch A Single Man]\n\nWarm Bodies (2013)\n\nIn 2013, Nicholas Hoult took two stabs at being a fantasy hero. One was playing the lead in the truly absurd Jack the Giant Slayer. The second was playing the lead in the equally absurd Warm Bodies. For me, Warm Bodies was a stronger showing for Hoult if only because the film blended romance, spoof, and horror with delightful zest. Hoult plays “R” a zombie who starts to come back to live after meeting a beautiful zombie hunter named Julie. [Where to Stream Warm Bodies]\n\nX-Men: Days Of Future Past (2014)\n\nYou might best know Nicholas Hoult as the blue-furred mutant genius, Beast, aka Hank McCoy, in the recent string of X-Men films. Hoult originated the role back in X-Men: First Class, and resurrected it in last summer’s delirious time travel mutant adventure epic, X-Men: Days of Future Past. Hoult is due to reprise the role in next summer’s X-Men: Apocalypse (and gossip colonists will be watching to see if he and ex-girlfriend Jennifer Lawrence manage to get back together once again.)
