        "text": "Shot over two years ago, John Doyle’s drama Main Street is finally coming to theaters. Although it stars last year’s Oscar winner Colin Firth, it hasn’t garnered good reviews since its Austin Film Festival premiere in 2010. Looking at the trailer one can predict that this is an Oscar attempt gone wrong, with its overwrought melodrama and predictable turns. It is also the last screenplay from the late Horton Foote, who wrote the scripts for To Kill a Mockingbird and Of Mice and Men. Check out the trailer below via Apple for the film also starring Ellen Burstyn, Patricia Clarkson, Amber Tamblyn, and Orlando Bloom.\n\nSynopsis:\n\nFrom Horton Foote, Oscar winning screenwriter of To Kill a Mockingbird and Tender Mercies, comes MAIN STREET, a moving ensemble drama starring Oscar winner Colin Firth, Orlando Bloom, Oscar nominee Patricia Clarkson, Oscar winner Ellen Burstyn, and Andrew McCarthy. The lives of the residents of a small Southern city are changed forever by the arrival of a stranger with a controversial plan to save their decaying hometown.\n\nMain Street hits theaters on September 9th and on demand August 5th."
