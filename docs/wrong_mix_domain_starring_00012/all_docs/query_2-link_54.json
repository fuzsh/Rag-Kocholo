        "text": "FADE IN:\n\nINT. MIDDLE EASTERN SAND FORTRESS\n\nA bunch of HEAVILY-ARMED MEN burst into a BUILDING and start SHOOTING EVERYBODY. Masked gunmen COLIN FIRTH, MARK STRONG, JACK DAVENPORT and NOLINES McDEADGUY tie some GUY to a CHAIR and INTERROGATE HIM.\n\nCOLIN FIRTH\n\nGive us the information we need or weâll blow your brains out!\n\nTERRORIST (PRESUMABLY)\n\nWait, could we take half a second to establish just what us guys do thatâs evil? I mean your actions right now are pretty much indiscernible from Hans Gruberâs, so a little context might be useful.\n\nCOLIN FIRTH\n\nThe context is that youâre middle eastern and have guns. Just because this is a British movie doesnât mean we canât borrow Hollywood stereotypes.\n\nTERRORIST\n\nFine, I might as well just own it then. SUICIDE BOMB TIME!\n\nMcDEADGUY throws himself on the TERRORISTâS BOMB and DIES, SAVING EVERYONE.\n\nCOLIN FIRTH\n\nNOOO, McDEADGUY!! On the bright side, congratulations, Jack, you just won the position as our new agent. By default. Due to the other candidate being MORE competent and heroic than you.\n\nJACK DAVENPORT\n\nWell thatâs dissatisfying. Hang on, by what definition am I a fresh-faced recruit? Iâm clearly in my early forties here.\n\nCOLIN FIRTH\n\nYeah well, weâre about to skip ahead seventeen years so weâve got the rest of the movie to look age-appropriate.\n\n(pause)\n\nWell, me and Mark do. Youâll be abruptly hacked up in the next scene.\n\nJACK DAVENPORT\n\nDamnit, itâs At Worldâs End all over again.\n\nINT. LONDON POLICE STATION, SEVENTEEN YEARS LATER\n\nTroubled youth TARON EGERTON, whose nickname, âEGGSYâ, sounds like an apt shortening of TARON EGERTON but doesnât relate to his character name GARY UNWIN even slightly, has been arrested for stealing a car.\n\nTARON EGERTON\n\nFortunately Iâm McDeadguyâs son, and when he died his agency gave me a special phone number I can use for a one-time favor of my choice, so now I can avoid prison!\n\n(pause)\n\nWait a minute, my mum lives in poverty in an abusive relationship with a violent gangster. Why the hell have I never thought to use this Get Out of Anything Free card until now?\n\nTARON is LET GO. As he leaves, he is approached by COLIN.\n\nCOLIN FIRTH\n\nSo Jackâs dead now, and weâre bringing in candidates for his replacement. Since your dad saved my life Iâm picking you.\n\nTARON EGERTON\n\nWhich means you would have sprung me for your own reasons anyway, and I just completely wasted my magic phone call?\n\nCOLIN FIRTH\n\nThatâs right, sucker! Now, you should be ideal Kingsman material as you were a straight-A student, a master gymnast and a model marine before your life went tits-up. Kind of kills the âdiamond in the roughâ premise behind your character, doesnât it?\n\nSuddenly they are confronted by the THUG whose car TARON stole, and several of his cronies.\n\nTHUG\n\nWe want a word with Taron, yâold geezer, so piss off. Doan mess wiv us, becoz the angrier we get the ficka ow axents get, so leave bafaw yoo cuzzaz wiv a fedgin wobbla!\n\nBut then COLIN kicks all of their ASSES using MARTIAL ARTS and BOND GADGETS. Finally he knocks out a potential WITNESS with an AMNESIA DART.\n\nCOLIN FIRTH\n\nWait, I have instant knock-out amnesia darts? Shit, I should have used those on everybody. Letting a bunch of random goons witness my bulletproof umbrella-gun and electro-bracelets and whatnot kind of takes the âsecretâ out of âsecret serviceâ, after all.\n\nINT. KINGSMEN HEADQUARTERS\n\nCOLIN takes TARON to a HUGE AUSTENTATIOUS MANOR with the KINGSMEN LOGO emblazoned on the lawn, meaning that this super-secret organization could be found in FIVE MINUTES by anyone who knows how to use GOOGLE EARTH.\n\nCOLIN FIRTH\n\nThe Kingsmen are a group founded just after World War I by a bunch of wealthy aristocrats. They independently identify and neutralize threats to world peace, answering to no goverment and operating outside the law.\n\nTARON EGERTON\n\nIn other words, a bunch of millionaires have a private army of assassins and use them against whatever organizations they personally take a stand against. Are you sure youâre the good guys?\n\nTARON goes to the CANDIDATESâ BARRACKS, where he meets the LEAGUE OF UNDESERVING RICH ASSHATS.\n\nEDWARD HOLCROFT\n\nWell well, would you look at the kind of riffraff theyâre letting in these days? Jeeves, laugh at this peasant for me.\n\nJEEVES\n\nHa ha ha!\n\nTARON EGERTON\n\nOh yeah? Weâll see whoâs laughing once you realize this movie is playing the âsmug toffee-nosed assholes beaten by noble working class underdogâ cliche to the hilt!\n\nEDWARD HOLCROFT\n\nNoble working class? You are aware that this is a movie where every single lower-class male character is a criminal, yourself included.\n\nSOPHIE COOKSON\n\nMeanwhile, Iâm the token non-jerk aristocrat.\n\nTARON EGERTON\n\nAnd my love interest?\n\nSOPHIE COOKSON\n\nNot even a little bit, surprisingly. It seems that this parody of all spy movie tropes managed to forget about the sex almost entirely. The closest thing you get to a love interest is a Swedish princess who lets you do her in the ass.\n\nSuddenly, the TESTING BEGINS! The room starts to FILL WITH WATER!\n\nSOPHIE COOKSON\n\nSHOWER HEADS!\n\nEDWARD HOLCROFT\n\nAh yes, good idea! Every single one of us except Taron knows exactly what youâre talking about, as that standalone, context-free noun could only refer to that one obscure survivalist technique which is apparently taught to all military cadets except for the marines.\n\nSOPHIE and the JERKS all jam SHOWER HEAD TUBES into TOILETS and BREATHE COMFORTABLY. Instead of NOTICING THIS and FOLLOWING THEIR LEAD, or possibly just because he thinks that that is SUPER GROSS, TARON punches out the bathroom MIRROR and they all escape to an adjoining OBSERVATION ROOM where MARK STRONG is watching.\n\nMARK STRONG\n\nYou all fail because, as none of you noticed, one of the candidates drowned!\n\nTARON EGERTON\n\nOkay, I can understand how I missed that while I was flailing around looking for a way out, but the rest of you were staring out into the main room, calmly breathing your sewer gas while you apparently watched the other candidate thrash and die. What are you, a bunch of sociopaths?\n\nEDWARD HOLCROFT\n\nI guess. Except for Sophie, is that really at all surprising?\n\nINT. KINGSMEN BRIEFING ROOM\n\nCOLIN and MARK are called into a BRIEFING with MICHAEL CAINE.\n\nMICHAEL CAINE\n\nIâm the head of the Kingsmen, code name âArthurâ, as we are all named after the Knights of the Round-\n\n(looks at long, straight table)\n\nBloody hell, would it have been too much to make this table round? Seriously, that seems like a pretty basic reference to incorporate here.\n\nMARK STRONG\n\nSo Jack died while investigating some kind of biological weapon which induces animalistic rage in humans, kind of like a version of the 28 Days Later virus where the zombies actually attack each other. Or in other words, a much more logical version of the 28 Days Later virus.\n\nMICHAEL CAINE\n\nJackâs last lead was kidnapped environmental scientist Mark Hamill, who has turned up seemingly not kidnapped at all. Colin, go ask him whatâs going on.\n\nINT. UNIVERSITY\n\nCOLIN goes and confronts MARK HAMILL.\n\nMARK HAMILL\n\n(cartoon voice)\n\nWell hello there! Sorry about the silly accent, but Iâve been exclusively doing voiceovers for so long Iâve honestly forgotten how to sound like a human.\n\nCOLIN FIRTH\n\nTell me why youâre not kidnapped anymore.\n\nMARK HAMILL\n\nWhy certainly, what happened was AHHH, MY HEAD IS OVERHEATING! OH WELL, AT LEAST I JUST BARELY MANAGED A SINGLE HIT FILM BETWEEN RETURN OF THE JEDI AND THE FORCE AWAKENSAAAAAAHHHHHH\n\nHis HEAD EXPLODES, showering COLIN with some kind of WEIRD GUNK!\n\nCOLIN FIRTH\n\nARGH! Some kind of chemical... putting me into a coma... almost as though the rest of the plot has to be stalled... until Taron has finished... his... traiiiiuhh...\n\n(slips into coma)\n\nEXT. THE SKY\n\nThe six remaining CANDIDATES go SKYDIVING.\n\nMARK STRONG\n\n(over radio)\n\nAnybody who fails to come in under the radar and land within the ten-foot target will immediately fail out of the entire program, because I guess the Kingsmen consider sub-par skydiving skills more inexcusible than allowing your fellow candidates to drown. And while youâre falling, hereâs a fun fact: one of your parachutes is a fake. Enjoy!\n\nTARON EGERTON\n\nAh shit. Okay, this is fine, logically we just wait until weâre below the radar and then everyone except Sophie and me open their chutes immediately. The one whose chute doesnât open can pair up with me; or if all of you are fine, it must be one of us two, and weâll have plenty of time to safely make it down together.\n\nEDWARD HOLCROFT\n\nOR we could waste precious time having all six of us take turns opening our chutes, one at a time, with stupidly long pauses in between each one.\n\nTARON EGERTON\n\nMoronic yet hair-raising, I like it!\n\nThey ALL SURVIVE, but only TARON, SOPHIE and EDWARD make it through to the NEXT CHALLENGE.\n\nTARON EGERTON\n\nSince everybody elseâs chutes opened, mine must have been the dud! What the hell, Mark? Whyâd you pick me? And donât say the chutes were randomly assigned, because thatâs the obvious answer and Iâd look like an idiot!\n\nIn response to this, MARK pulls TARONâS CHUTE and demonstrates it WORKED THE WHOLE TIME.\n\nMARK STRONG\n\nSee, it was all a bluff! You were never in danger at all.\n\n(pause)\n\nWait, earlier we faked that drowning to make you all believe these tests were a hundred per cent real and dangerous. Going out of my way to reveal a later test as a fakeout was kind of a dumb move then, huh?\n\nSOPHIE COOKSON\n\nOh well, we made it through. Even me, with my fear of heights. Letâs just hope the next challenge isnât as unfairly stacked against me.\n\nMARK STRONG\n\nYour next challenge is to seduce a beautiful woman.\n\nSOPHIE COOKSON\n\nOh for FUCKâS SAKE.\n\nThey all go to a NIGHTCLUB to try and sleep with some HOT CHICK, but their DRINKS are DRUGGED and they all BLACK OUT. TARON wakes up tied to some TRAIN TRACKS, about to be RUN OVER.\n\nEVIL-LOOKING DUDE\n\nIâll cut you free if you tell me about the Kingsmen.\n\nTARON EGERTON\n\nSo this is a loyalty test, huh? Seeing if I'll turn on the Kingsmen under pressure?\n\nEVIL-LOOKING DUDE\n\nActually it's probably more an intelligence test. I mean come on, how was I meant to guarantee you'd come round before the train arrives? How much useful intel could you even give me in the next six seconds? Have I never heard of good old-fashioned torture? Basically, if you found this whole scenario plausible, you're way too dumb to be any use to us.\n\nTARON and SOPHIE pass the TEST, but EDWARD is eliminated.\n\nINT. KINGSMEN BRIEFING ROOM\n\nHaving come round from his COMA, COLIN is in another BRIEFING.\n\nMARK STRONG\n\nWe tracked the radio signal that set off Hamillâs head explosion to tech billionaire Samuel L. Jackson. Hereâs him on the news earlier today:\n\nTHAMUEL L. MOTHERFUCKING JACKTHON\n\n(on TV)\n\nIâm happy to announthe that Iâll be giving away billionth of free THIM cardth which will allow everyone to uthe my communicationth network for free from now until the end of time! Thith ith far too good to be true and thereâth no way for me to profit off it, everybody in the world jutht figured out that Iâm up to thomething.\n\nCOLIN adopts a fake identity and goes and has a meeting with SAMUEL.\n\nCOLIN FIRTH\n\nSo youâre a dorky computer geek who canât stomach the sight of blood. So why the hell are you being played by one of the coolest, most devastatingly masculine actors who ever lived?\n\nTHAMUEL L. MOTHERFUCKING JACKTHON\n\nEh, they thought they could cover all that up with a thilly hat and a thpeech impediment.\n\nCOLIN FIRTH\n\nI see. By the by, I happen to know a cracking good s-s-speech th-therapist.\n\nTHAMUEL L. MOTHERFUCKING JACKTHON\n\nHey, how about we thuddenly change the topic to thpy movieth, apropos of nothing?\n\nCOLIN FIRTH\n\nSo I take it thatâs your way of straight-up telling me that youâve sussed me out. Thus putting me on my guard, so you wonât be able to just track me back to base and learn all about the people I work for.\n\nTHAMUEL L. MOTHERFUCKING JACKTHON\n\nUh, yeah. Tell you what, if youâll jutht be an idiot for me and not figure out Iâve bugged you, later on Iâll be equally dumb and put on an equally bugged hat when you tell me to.\n\nCOLIN FIRTH\n\nSounds like a deal!\n\nINT. MICHAEL CAINEâS OFFICE\n\nTARON is sent in to see MICHAEL.\n\nMICHAEL CAINE\n\nNow comes the last test. At the beginning of your training we gave you a small dog to look after. Now to prove yourself, you have to kill it.\n\nTARON EGERTON\n\nHoly shit, youâre using the same training techniques as fucking Astapor slavers? Once again, are you SURE youâre the good guys?\n\nTARON doesnât shoot the DOG, and fails out of the KINGSMEN.\n\nCOLIN FIRTH\n\nYou idiot, Taron, that was just a test! The gun was really full of blanks!\n\nTARON EGERTON\n\nSo it was all a bluff? Like how the parachute thing was a bluff? And the bit with the train was a bluff? Wow, I need to work on my pattern recognition skills.\n\nCOLIN FIRTH\n\nIâm so disappointed that you could be so stupid! Now if youâll excuse me, the bad guy in our biological weapons case has just mentioned that heâs planning some kind of test at an American church tomorrow, so I have to go walk straight into the church when the test is scheduled and sit down.\n\nTARON EGERTON\n\nRemember, this bad guy has seen your face, so when you head in there be sure to wear no kind of disguise whatsoever.\n\nINT. THE CHURCH OF BIGOTOLOGY\n\nCOLIN heads into a CHURCH full of ANGRY FUNDAMENTALIST ASSHOLES.\n\nPREACHER\n\nSAME-SEX MARRIAGE CAUSES HURRICANES!! TAXES ARE A SIDE EFFECT OF EVOLUTIONARY SCIENCE!!! JEWS AND ATHEISTS AND ETC. ETC.!!!!\n\nCOLIN FIRTH\n\nAlrighty then, clearly this movie is gearing up to gruesomely kill all these people, Iâm getting the fuck out of here.\n\nBut as he goes to LEAVE all the PHONES in the room start emitting a weird NOISE that causes EVERYBODY including HIM to start VIOLENTLY MURDERING EACH OTHER.\n\nCOLIN FIRTH\n\n(shoots heads)\n\nHang on, earlier when Jack got chopped in half, he-\n\n(beats dude to death with empty gun)\n\n-fell neatly into two pieces, with no blood or guts, like-\n\n(snaps womanâs neck)\n\n-a fucking cartoon, and when-\n\n(grenade)\n\n-Hamillâs head exploded I was showered with-\n\n(stained-glass shiv)\n\n-that coma juice but no blood or brains, so-\n\n(punches straight through guyâs rib cage)\n\n-why the hell were we being so obnoxiously PG-13 before, if later-\n\n(clubs man with his own torn-off leg)\n\n-we were going to go full Hobo With a Shotgun?\n\n(rips out preacherâs lungs)\n\nFinally COLIN is the ONLY ONE LEFT ALIVE. He then strolls STRAIGHT OUT THE FRONT DOOR where SAMUEL is waiting for him, because itâs a little late now to stop making dumb decisions.\n\nTHAMUEL L. MOTHERFUCKING JACKTHON\n\nAth you can thee, I can make any phone with one of my free THIM cardth in it give off an audio thignal which triggerth homithidal rage in any human being who hearth it.\n\nCOLIN FIRTH\n\nCall me crazy, but if youâre testing a device to see if it can make people homicidally angry, I wouldnât think the ideal location would an angry church of bile-spewing rageoholics in the middle of their Two Minutes Hate.\n\nTHAMUEL L. MOTHERFUCKING JACKTHON\n\nI thuppothe youâre ekthpecting me to thtand here telling you my evil planth?\n\nCOLIN FIRTH\n\nEr, isnât that exactly what you were just-\n\n(shot in head)\n\nBlimey, in a coma for part of the second act, dead for the third. Not exactly working overtime for that top billing, am I?\n\n(dies)\n\nINT. KINGSMEN BRIEFING ROOM\n\nA grief-stricken TARON heads in to see MICHAEL.\n\nMICHAEL CAINE\n\nHang on, you failed out of the program, how come you still have access to the nerve centre of our operation? Don't we have passcodes or keycards or anything?\n\nTARON EGERTON\n\nOh please, your innocent-seeming tailorâs shop in London has a hidden weapons room that you access by pulling down on a fucking coat hook. For a secret service you suck at security.\n\nMICHAEL pours them both a DRINK, but then TARON notices MICHAEL has a SCAR BEHIND ONE EAR, meaning he has one of SAMUELâS EXPLODING HEAD IMPLANTS and is a BAD GUY.\n\nTARON EGERTON\n\nUh oh! Um - say Michael, LOOK OVER THERE!\n\n(switches drinks)\n\nMICHAEL CAINE\n\nHoly shit, do I actually fall for that? I really have no business being a spy, do I?\n\nTARON EGERTON\n\nOh well, since youâre secure in the knowledge that I and not you will die of poisoning, you might as well explain Samuelâs evil plan, right?\n\nMICHAEL CAINE\n\nWhy not. These head implants make us immune to Samuelâs rage phones, so weâll survive when he makes everybody kill each other. Heâs convinced lots of world leaders, celebrities and other rich people to get them. Instead of killing the ones who didnât go along, he simply kidnapped them, because in the aftermath heâll need a lot of beloved and respected faces... as well as, apparently, the obnoxious racist idiot Iggy Azalea.\n\nTARON EGERTON\n\nThese important people are all going along with Samuelâs insane genocide plot? How the fuck did he manage that?\n\nMICHAEL CAINE\n\nHe just pointed out that global warming is when the world gets hot, and a virus is when a person gets hot, so people are like a virus, and we need fewer of them.\n\n(pause)\n\nNo seriously, thatâs basically it. Thatâs all he needed to say to convince people like the American president and the queen of England to help murder billions of people.\n\nTARON EGERTON\n\nWow, this fictional world is populated entirely by gullible idiots! Just drop dead already you useless moron.\n\nMICHAEL CAINE\n\n(dies)\n\nTARON gets together SOPHIE and MARK and tells them about SAMUELâS PLAN.\n\nTARON EGERTON\n\nFortunately Michaelâs phone has a big convenient readout on it stating the exact time of the attack and Samuelâs exact location when it happens. We need to send all the Kingsmen there to stop him!\n\nMARK STRONG\n\nNo, itâll have to just be us. We have no way of knowing who else Samuel has won over to his cause!\n\nTARON EGERTON\n\nUm, yes we do. Theyâd have that same noticeable scar that tipped me off about-\n\nMARK STRONG\n\n(amnesia-darts Taron)\n\nLetâs go!\n\nThey get on a PLANE and fly off towards SAMUELâS BASE. On the way they discuss their PLAN.\n\nMARK STRONG\n\nTaron, you head in and get me connected to Samuelâs computer so I can take control of it. Incidentally, thatâs the same computer he uses to blow up the heads of anyone who tries to squeal about his evil plot.\n\nTARON EGERTON\n\nAh, so once youâve hacked his computer youâll be able to-\n\nMARK STRONG\n\nShhh! The audience may have seen the obvious connection, but weâre not allowed to until the last possible moment. Sophie, youâll buy us some time by flying a ridiculous balloon-mounted missile launcher into the upper atmosphere and destroying one of Samuelâs satellites.\n\nSOPHIE COOKSON\n\nSay, hereâs a thought: since I have a fear of heights and Samuel knows what Taron looks like, maybe HE could take the flying job, and I could infiltrate the evil lair? You know, give that more important job to the ACTUAL KINGSMAN?\n\nTARON EGERTON\n\nI'm sorry, who here is wearing the Protagonist Pants?\n\nSOPHIE COOKSON\n\n(sighs)\n\nYou are.\n\nINT. MOUNTAINTOP LAIR\n\nTARON gets off the PLANE and heads into SAMUELâS LAIR, disguised as a RICH ASSHOLE. He manages to CONNECT MARK to SAMUELâS COMPUTER, but then heâs spotted by EDWARD.\n\nEDWARD HOLCROFT\n\nThatâs right, Iâm officially evil now! Note that I too could still access Kingsmen headquarters if I wanted, itâs really a stupid situation.\n\nTARON beats up EDWARD and RUNS FOR IT! Eventually heâs cornered by a million ARMED GUARDS.\n\nTARON EGERTON\n\n(over radio)\n\nAll right, Mark, are we allowed to realize the obvious connection NOW?\n\nMARK STRONG\n\n(over radio)\n\nYes yes, beginning head-explosion protocol. Just be careful none of that coma gunk gets on you, okay?\n\nTARON EGERTON\n\n(over radio)\n\nPretty sure the movie has forgotten that that was ever a thing.\n\nMARK does some HACKING and everyone who was IN ON SAMUELâS PLAN has their HEAD EXPLODE in COLORFUL, GORE-FREE CLOUDS OF NEON SMOKE AND SPARKLES, because the movie apparently is under the impression it can re-PG-13 itself. One of the EXPLODING HEADS belong to the UNNAMED AMERICAN PRESIDENT who is nonetheless quite clearly BARACK OBAMA.\n\nTARON EGERTON\n\nWow, so this is a movie where the heroes are rich people who work free of government regulation, the villains are rabid environmentalists, and Obamaâs head explodes onscreen? This is turning into something Rush Limbaugh would write to use as whacking material.\n\nBut SAMUEL'S HEAD remains UNEXPLODED, so he initiates the INTERNATIONAL FESTIVAL OF MURDER. People all over the world run each other over, throw each other out of windows, shove salad forks into ane another's eyes and so on.\n\nTARON EGERTON\n\nSeriously, Samuel, if you absolutely had to cull the human race, was it necessary to pick such a horrific, inefficient method? What's wrong with neurotoxin, hm? Or killer drones? Almost anything would be better. Oh, and what the hell were you going to do about the billions of corpses rotting in the streets?\n\nTHAMUEL L. MOTHERFUCKING JACKTHON\n\nI dunno. You might ath well be wondering how ekthactly I plan on thtaying alive after I let all the kidnapped thelebritieth go and they, no doubt, tell a hundred million angry thurvivorth everything I did.\n\nTARON EGERTON\n\nOr ask what good you and your friends expect your wealth and status to be worth once you've knocked the world back to a subsistence-level society. Look, if we point out everything that's wrong with your plan we'll be here all day.\n\nTARON goes to KILL SAMUEL, but he is intercepted by SAMUELâS NUMBER TWO, SOFIA BOUTELLA.\n\nSOFIA BOUTELLA\n\nBehold, my weapons of choice are my own prosthetic legs! Theyâre razor sharp, and while they might seem awkward to use, thatâs only if you compare them to basically any handheld weapon ever invented.\n\nSOFIA attacks TARON! He fends her off using VIRTUOSIC MARTIAL ARTS SKILLS that were NEVER SEEN IN HIS TRAINING, then he manages to POISON HER using a âFROM RUSSIA WITH LOVEâ-STYLE SHOE KNIFE.\n\nSOFIA BOUTELLA\n\nWait, did you just beat me in a stabbing-people-with-your-feet fight? Come on, thatâs literally my entire thing!\n\n(dies)\n\nFinally TARON is able to easily KILL SAMUEL.\n\nTARON EGERTON\n\nOkay then! We stopped the in-progress genocide and saved the day, we can all relax now.\n\nMARK STRONG\n\n(over radio)\n\nEr, what about the fact that millions of people were just murdered and most world leaders just had their heads exploded and presumably the entire world has just descended into chaos?\n\nTARON EGERTON\n\nBah, let the closing credits sequence ignore that for us, I have bigger fish to fry. I believe Sophie said something about buttsex with Swedish royalty?\n\nEND."
