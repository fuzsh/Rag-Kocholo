        "text": "The end of a great year of film has arrived. As you all get ready to celebrate New Year in whatever way you see fit and reflect on what’s occurred over the past twelve months, one must also look ahead to the events of the twelve months to come. As such, it’s time to take a look at the twenty films coming out next year I’m most looking forward to.\n\nBefore we begin, a few notes:\n\nThis list is based on what is scheduled to come out in 2015 as of this moment. Some of these may get delayed to 2016 for a variety of reasons, but as of now they are due for release next year.\n\nI’m only counting films that have a confirmed release for next year. I know Quentin Tarantino’s The Hateful Eight is expected to release next year among others, but because there’s no set date as of this moment, I cannot count it.\n\nFilms that will be released here in the UK in 2015 but were released in the US in 2014 don’t count, so don’t expect to see films like Whiplash, Foxcatcher or Big Hero 6 on this list.\n\nThis is not a prediction of what I think will be the best films of 2015; some of them I even have serious doubts about. These are merely the movies I am most excited and/or interested to see, and their quality will be judged when I have actually seen them.\n\nAnd now, we may begin…\n\nThe Jungle Book\n\nAs much as Disney has been doing well lately with its animated films and partnerships with Pixar and Marvel, their live action films haven’t received exactly the same success on a critical level; for every Oz The Great and Powerful, there’s an Alice in Wonderland. The company has two live action reimaginings coming out next year: the first, Kenneth Branagh’s Cinderella, certainly looks like its going to fall into the bad camp, but despite little information at his moment about Jon Favreau’s version of The Jungle Book, I certainly have a lot of hope. Favreau has proven himself as a director of both blockbusters and indie fare, and he’s assembled a great cast as well for this live action/motion capture hybrid. Heck, it’s got Bill Murray as Baloo and Christopher Walken as King Louie. Need I say more?\n\nChappie\n\nNeill Blomkamp, director of the spectacular District 9 and the good-but-not-as-good-as-District 9-was Elysium, returns for another sci-fi tale. Tackling the familiar but still interesting theme of artificial intelligence, Chappie looks to be Blomkamp’s attempt at a softer film after his first two explosive outings. We’re still getting plenty of grime, robots and South African accents that we expect from Blomkamp, but with perhaps a bit more heart. It could end up just being a supped-up version of Short Circuit, but count me intrigued.\n\nIn the Heart of the Sea\n\nRon Howard is often a hit-or-miss director and, considering his last film Rush was a real high point, that doesn’t bode well for In the Heart of the Sea. However, this could be the film to buck that trend. Telling the true story that inspired Herman Melville to write Moby Dick, the film features an all-star cast and some tremendous looking special effects and set-pieces.\n\nTed 2\n\nSeth MacFarlane’s sophomore effort A Million Ways to Die in the West was a bit of a disappointment, so let’s hope this sequel to his first hit film doesn’t prove he was a one-hit wonder in the movie world. I’m not exactly sure what a sequel to Ted would entail, but I’m sure MacFarlane has enough imagination to come up with a decent scenario to send Ted and John on an interesting adventure. Hopefully this can be the next 22 Jump Street rather than the next The Hangover Part II.\n\nTerminator: Genisys\n\nI really, really want another good Terminator film, and at the moment I’m getting some mixed signals here. Going all Back to the Future Part II on the first film and bringing in a great cast with likes of Emilia Clarke, Matt Smith and the return of Schwarzenegger look cool, but pulling an in-canon reboot isn’t anything new, the CGI looks more dated than the effects from Terminator 2, and it still feels like they’re too reliant on the iconic imagery from the original two films. This could easily go either way, and I’m hoping it goes the right way, but if it doesn’t I think we need to tell Arnold, “No. Don’t come back.”\n\nMidnight Special\n\nNot much is currently known about this latest effort from Jeff Nichols, director of Take Shelter and Mud, other than it is an ode to the classic films of John Carpenter. Honestly, that’s all I need to know. I love John Carpenter, I love Mud, and I love Michael Shannon, so I might as well just buy my ticket now and expect the best.\n\nThe Hunger Games: Mockingjay – Part 2\n\nMockingjay – Part 1 was a bit dragged out, but I was somewhat expecting that and what was there was pretty good. It’s now at least got me pumped up to see the climax play out on the big screen. Having read the book, I can promise this second part will be much heavier on the action, similar to Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2, and bring an intriguing and satisfying close to this great series.\n\nMad Max: Fury Road\n\nI’m not a huge fan of the Mad Max franchise, but the trailers they’ve released for this looks astounding. The crazy amount of real car carnage and gorgeous visuals on display here is enough to get me pumped, as is the casting of Tom Hardy in the shoes once occupied by Mel Gibson. I know this film has been in the works forever, and whether anything else in it will be of note is yet to be seen, but I’m sure this will at least be a visual treat.\n\nMission: Impossible V\n\nMission: Impossible – Ghost Protocol was a welcome kick in the pants for this long-running franchise, and with Christopher McQuarrie taking the helm for this fifth installment I couldn’t be happier. Looking forward to more crazy stunts, exotic locales, and lots and lots of Tom Cruise running.\n\nVictor Frankenstein\n\nWe really need another good Frankenstein movie, especially in the wake of I, Frankenstein, and perhaps this could be exactly what this old monster story needs. Directed by Paul McGuigan of Sherlock and Lucky Number Slevin fame, written by Chronicle scribe Max Landis, starring James McAvoy and Daniel Radcliffe and giving the tale a spin that supposedly mixes together pretty much all pop culture interpretations of the story, Victor Frankenstein already has me sold.\n\nThe Fantastic Four\n\nThis reboot of the first superhero family has been kept relatively under wraps which has worried fans, as has its unconventional casting choices, but this sense of mystery has me intrigued. From what we know, the film is inspired by multiple runs of the comic but specifically Ultimate Fantastic Four, which explains the younger cast and more grounded tone they’ve talked about. In my opinion, the cast sounds fascinating and with Chronicle’s Josh Trank at the helm, I’m hoping this could be next summer’s big surprise. Fox certainly has a lot of faith in the project considering they’ve already scheduled a sequel, and I hope their non-existent marketing so far is being done to make the eventual reveal that much better. But if it does fail, just hope that the rights will revert to Marvel.\n\nCrimson Peak\n\nI love me some Guillermo Del Toro, and this return to the horror genre for him sounds like it could be the horror film to beat next year. Taking the classic haunted mansion genre and imbuing it with Del Toro’s unique sensibilities sounds like a winning formula, and throwing heavyweights like Tom Hiddleston and Jessica Chastain into the mix makes it sound even sweeter.\n\nJurassic World\n\nI predicted Colin Treverrow would be going places after his spectacular feature debut Safety Not Guaranteed, but I never expected he’d reach this high so quickly. Jurassic Park remains one of the greatest and most nostalgic movies of my generation for a reason, and hopefully this long overdue sequel will be the follow-up fans truly deserve. A fully operational park, hybrid dinosaurs, and Chris Pratt riding a motorbike with his raptor buddies? Count me in.\n\nKingsman: The Secret Service\n\nThis spy action flick has been pushed around the release calendar quite a lot, but from having read the comic and hearing the buzz from early screenings, I couldn’t be more excited. Mixing the style and lunacy of classic James Bond with the mad stylings of Matthew Vaughn and Mark Millar is a genius idea, and hiring such classy folk as Colin Firth, Samuel L. Jackson and Michael Caine to help sell it is even more awesome. Just think a mix between Moonraker, X-Men: First Class and Kick-Ass, and I think you’ve got a good idea of what to expect from Kingsman.\n\nAnt-Man\n\nMy anticipation for this one has certainly been quelled since Edgar Wright abruptly left the project earlier this year, but Marvel have yet to let me down and so I’m hoping Peyton Reed has what it takes to hold this ship together into another hit. An impressive cast, a bizarre superhero and talks that it most resembles a heist movie is enough to keep me hooked despite the lack of Wright’s involvement.\n\nSpectre\n\nSkyfall was one of the most impressive James Bond movies in recent memory, and with the same creative team back at the helm for the follow-up I couldn’t be more excited. With the previous film’s conclusion suggesting a return to the classic Bond formula, bringing back MI6’s old nemesis SPECTRE is the perfect move for the franchise right now, and I wouldn’t be surprised if Christoph Waltz doesn’t turn out to be a certain bald, cat-stroking villain (no, not Dr. Evil!). That and it’s going to have Dave Bautista in it. Can we just call this race now?\n\nInside Out\n\nPixar have been in a bit of a lull recently, their last three films not reaching their previously ultra-high standards and behind-the-scenes problems with The Good Dinosaur causing them to skip out on 2014 entirely. The world desperately needs another great Pixar film, and this concoction from Up director Pete Docter could potentially be that one. The idea of exploring the mind as if its run by people isn’t an entirely new concept, but Pixar have such a good reputation of putting a unique spin on traditional ideas that I’m sure they’ll make it all their own. With Disney and DreamWorks really upping their game in recent years, Pixar cannot afford to slouch anymore.\n\nTomorrowland\n\nSpeaking of Pixar, Brad Bird’s newest venture is looking to be something special. Its teaser trailer is near perfect, tantalizing us with the potential for an amazing ride but still without letting us in on what exactly is going on; all we know is that it’s got George Clooney, a magic pin and jetpacks. Sure, the presence of Damon “I-don’t-know-how-to-write-a-third-act” Lindelof as a writer is a worrying aspect, but the imagination of Bird is hard to deny. I’m ready to adventure to Tomorrowland.\n\nAvengers: Age of Ultron\n\nEarth’s Mightiest Heroes reassemble for what looks to be the movie to beat this summer. After facing an alien invasion in the first film, the threat of Robot James Spader might initially seem like a step down, but I promise you this is probably going to get insane. With more action, more banter, and more characters with some high stakes and a creepy interpretation of a Disney song, Age of Ultron would have to do something spectacularly stupid to upend Marvel’s winning streak right now.\n\nStar Wars Episode VII: The Force Awakens\n\nIt’s the obvious choice, I know, but this is my list and I stand by it wholeheartedly. Nothing has had an impact on my life the way Star Wars has, and I want to see it done right. I’ve said for years that new Star Wars films are not only possible, but also have the chance to be great again, if only George Lucas would step down and let a new generation take the reigns. I never thought it would actually happen, at least not so soon, but it did and my excitement cannot be contained. Even with a year to go until its release, The Force Awakens has already made some great moves. Bringing back the old cast whilst hiring some great new talent as well, putting a great focus on using old filmmaking techniques rather than just a lot of CGI and, the best thing of all, keeping the whole thing shrouded in secrecy. How rare is that in this day and age? One of the most talked about movies on the landscape right now, with news and rumours flooding in every week and even a trailer released well in advance, and yet we still know next to nothing. That is how it is done. I’m not going to say you’d be wrong to still be cautious, as Star Wars is a property that has let us down several times before and even I’m trying to remain as reserved as I can, but if you’ve written The Force Awakens off already and have absolutely no hope of it being good, you really have turned to the dark side.\n\nStarring: Martin Freeman (Sherlock), Ian McKellen (X-Men), Richard Armitage (Captain America: The First Avenger), Evangeline Lilly (Lost), Lee Pace (Guardians of the Galaxy), Luke Evans (Dracula Untold), Orlando Bloom (Pirates of the Carribean: The Curse of the Black Pearl), Benedict Cumberbatch (Star Trek Into Darkness)\n\nDirector: Peter Jackson (The Lord of the Rings)\n\nWriters: Peter Jackson & Fran Walsh & Philippa Boyens (The Lord of the Rings) & Guillermo Del Toro (Pacific Rim)\n\nRuntime: 2 hours 24 minutes\n\nRelease Date: 12 December (UK), 17 December (US)\n\nWell, the circle is now complete. Peter Jackson’s days telling the tales of Middle Earth are over, and will never see the likes of Bilbo Baggins, Gandalf and the rest ever again. It truly is a closing of the book on many levels, and to think it took thirteen years to bring these six films to the screen makes me feel really old. But in the midst of all of these milestones, I still don’t quite feel the impact, and I think that’s mainly because The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies, for all of its scale and impact, is the least of the entire series.\n\nThe final chapter in The Hobbit saga picks up right where The Desolation of Smaug left off and, as entertaining as it is, it resolves itself rather quickly and really does feel like it’s something that should have happened in the last film. The story begins proper about ten minutes later as the build-up to the titular battle begins, and it’s here where once again the series’ severe pacing problems kick in. I get that tension needs to build, but it takes an hour to finally get to the action and all of that build-up is essentially characters repeatedly stating their goals and motivations. It feels dragged out and could have been summarised a little quicker. But then the battle finally begins and, for a good chunk of it, it feels great. The tension pays off, the pacing picks up considerably, and the action on display comes ever so close to Helm’s Deep levels of awesome. But then the battles just keep going and going and going and going and it just becomes exhausting. A good 60% of the film is essentially one giant battle sequence that rarely ever lets up, jumping from one set piece to another at rapid pace, but after so long even that level of ferocity becomes monotonous. Once the battle is finally over (with once again the assistance of the series’ favourite bunch of living deus ex machinas), the film proceeds to wrap itself up quickly and nicely leads into The Fellowship of the Ring, but the ending made me think something I thought I’d never say about a Hobbit film: I think it needed more. Partly because certain plot elements are swiftly wrapped up or forgotten about (what exactly did happen to the Arkenstone?), but mainly because it lacks a sense of closure. After so much time spent with these characters, especially considering this is the last film (even if it isn’t chronologically), I felt the ending really needed a bigger punch. I don’t know if it exactly needed the same extensive epilogue The Return of the King had, but a bigger emotional kick beyond being nostalgic would have helped to make this final adventure feel like a closing of the book.\n\nAs much as the films often forget about him, these movies really do belong to Martin Freeman’s performance as Bilbo Baggins. As always, he manages to capture the naivety, honesty and bravery of the character to a T but without losing that complexity brought on by his growing fixation on a certain magic ring. Ian McKellen’s Gandalf never ceases to provide joy, even if his subplot from the last film is quickly resolved and his importance to the plot here is relatively minor; it wouldn’t be a Middle Earth movie without him. I’ve never been too keen on Richard Armitage’s Thorin, mainly because he just seems like an amalgamation of Frodo and Aragorn to me, and I found his corruption shtick here to be a bit tired for the most part. But whenever he and Freeman get a moment together, it really pays off and gives Thorin that sense of humanity (or would that be dwarfity?) he often lacks. Evangeline Lilly puts her all into Tauriel, but her subplot with Kili (Aiden Turner) feels just as tacked-on as it did in the last film and her resolution feels a bit lacking; similar sentiments can be made to Orlando Bloom’s return as Legolas. There’s a lot to cover, so I’ll speed through the rest: Lee Pace as Thranduil is cool but his motivations are weak and unresolved, the importance Lee Evans’ Bard dissipates as the film goes on, Benedict Cumberbatch’s Smaug gets very limited screen time, characters like Galadriel (Cate Blanchett), Elrond (Hugo Weaving), Radagast (Sylvester McCoy) and Saruman (Christopher Lee) are mere cameos, Ryan Gage’s Alfrid is now the film’s major source of comic relief and is otherwise completely disposable, and like always the other 11 dwarves are just kind of there (seriously, most of them don’t even do anything in this one).\n\nEven if I found the action sequences to be overlong, they are still impressive on many levels. The scope of the choreography never ceases to amaze and every blow feels satisfying, amplified by plenty of those OTT feats of action that just make you want to cheer; there’s nothing quite like single-handedly taking out an oliphant, but it’s still pretty cool. I didn’t bother to see the film in 48 frames this time around, but I still found the digital cinematography to be a bit distracting, as it lacks the grit and age of celluloid that a film like this needs. Regardless, the camera work is still fantastic and the production design and costumes look as good as ever. Once again, I’m disappointed by the overreliance on CGI considering how well Lord of the Rings balanced between practical and digital effects, but the quality of it is still up there with some of the best.\n\nThe Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies gets by mainly thanks to its impressive action sequences, good performances and strong technical feats, but the same pacing issues that dogged the first two instalments are still here. Now that I’ve seen the entire trilogy, I can safely say that stretching out the book to three movies was an unnecessary move that has only harmed the story; I think the originally-planned two film spread would have worked far better and I’d like to see if fans could find a way to edit them into something that more closely resembles that vision. It’s the easily the weakest of the Hobbit films and the entire franchise, but it’s certainly still worth a watch. Topping the original trilogy was something that was never going to happen, and whilst I certainly think these prequels could have been handled better in several aspects, I do think they manage to hold up on their own fairly well. Unless they get a hold of the rights to make The Silmarillion or some idiot decides to reboot the series down the line, this is the last we are ever going to see of Middle Earth. Much like Frodo sailing off into the Grey Havens, it is a sad but necessary end to one of the most notable sagas in film history.\n\nFINAL VERDICT: 7.5/10\n\nStarring: Michael Keaton (Batman), Edward Norton (Fight Club), Emma Stone (Zombieland), Zach Galifianakis (The Hangover), Andrea Riseborough (Oblivion), Naomi Watts (King Kong), Amy Ryan (Gone Baby Gone)\n\nDirector: Alejandero Gonzalez Inarritu (Babel)\n\nWriters: Alejandero Gonzalez Inarritu, Nicolas Giacobone (Biutiful), Alexander Dinelaris & Armando Bo\n\nRuntime: 1 hour 59 minutes\n\nRelease Date: 17 October (US), 1 January (UK)\n\nFilms about celebrity status can be a real pain when handled poorly. Too often, they are made by people who are so caught up in their own bullsh*t that they don’t realise that their issues are pathetic when compared to the rest of the world’s; the purest definition of ‘first world problems’. Birdman does tackle the issue of celebrity, but does so from a dissolusioned perspective, and then proceeds to also tackle subjects like the Hollywood system, criticism, the art of acting, social media and society at large in general. Birdman leaves no stone unturned, no topic undiscussed. It is a brave and beautifully crafted piece of cinema that balances that perfect line of appealing to the cinephile and the general moviegoer.\n\nBirdman is an incredibly cynical film from the word go, but that’s the entire point and it doesn’t even shy away from criticizing that element of itself. The tale of Riggan Thompson (Keaton) and his struggle to find relevance is not for those wanting a simple laugh, though it does have more than enough great humorous scenes. This is about as black as a movie can get without moving into morbid territory, but the film is at its best when it’s bitter. Scenes like Riggan’s argument with his daughter Sam (Stone) or a snobby theatre critic (Lindsay Duncan) are highlights that really dig deep into the rich subject matter before ripping every detail to shreds. All in all, it’s less a story about a man trying to reclaim his glory days and more about a man trying to figure out if that glory was any good to begin with. It’s this spiteful but honest and tongue-in-cheek tone that really defines Birdman as a movie unlike any you’ve seen before. It certainly does delve into clichéd and predictable moments, but it almost seems self-aware of that fact and it plays with it. It could also have been trimmed a little, as Riggan’s relationship with his girlfriend (Riseborough) or Sam’s with Mike (Norton) don’t end up going anywhere, but for the most part Birdman is a brutal but sincere and ingenious satire of a number of media and societal problems that really do deserve a good kicking up the arse like this.\n\nThe casting of Michael Keaton in the role of an aging film star whose most famous for playing a superhero in the early 90’s is no coincidence, and whether drawn from real life or pure invention it is the performance of a lifetime for the venerable actor. Keaton has always been good at playing charming but off-kilter and somewhat disturbing characters, and Riggan Thompson effectively works as a summation of his entire career; every great element from all his performances meshed into one character to create a figure made of pure ego and insanity. He’s a character you completely understand yet can’t always comprehend as he switches from calm and intellectual to self-centred egomaniac to fits of deluded, self aggrandising anger, all of which coalesce to create one hell of an act. Always keeping up, though, is the equally brilliant Edward Norton as a pretentious but empty-headed and difficult actor who is so lost in his performance that the real world seems fake to him. Again, how much of this is drawn from Norton’s own notoriety for being hard to work with is up for debate, but he holds his own with Keaton in every scene and both are certainly worthy of the awards buzz they’ve been getting. Emma Stone is also fantastic as Riggan’s recovering drug addict daughter; her scene where she bursts out at her father and calls him our for his selfish ambitions in an impressive monologue ranks up with some of her best work. The rest of the cast is also impressive but not quite as noteworthy mainly due to a lack of focus, but it’s great to see Zach Galifianakis stretch into some more dramatic territory and to see more of Andrea Riseborough in general (seriously, she needs more work).\n\nPlenty of films have done the gimmick of making themselves look like they’ve been done in one take, but Birdman is by far the most ambitious example I’ve ever seen accomplished. The cinematography rarely stops moving as it floats around our characters, getting every single angle and detail on screen without breaking the flow, and the transitions between scenes are some of the best I’ve seen this side of an Edgar Wright movie. It’s not completely seamless, as it’s obvious at certain points where they’ve cut or you can tell when footage has been stabilised in post, but it never becomes too distracting and the effect is otherwise seamless and beyond creative; kudos to Inarritu and cinematographer Emmanuel Lubezki for having the balls to even try it. The special effects are impressive for a film of this size (even though the flight effects are a little iffy at times) and the jazz-infused soundtrack is impressive but a little loud and distracting at times, but it’s mainly the astounding camerawork on display that makes Birdman such an impressive technical feat.\n\nBirdman is a film that needed to be made in this current cultural climate and it accomplishes its goals with high honours. The screenplay is sharp and quotable, the cast is impeccable in every way, the direction is imaginative and the cinematography is among the best of its kind. It’s a movie that goes beyond asking “what does it mean to be famous?” and delves into the far more interesting question of “what does it mean to be human?” without becoming the same pompous, over bloated piece of arthouse that it itself criticizes. If you’re a fan of cinema in any facet, this one certainly deserves your viewing pleasure.\n\nFINAL VERDICT: 9.5/10\n\nStarring: Ben Whishaw (Skyfall), Hugh Bonneville (The Monuments Men), Sally Hawkins (Godzilla), Nicole Kidman (Eyes Wide Shut), Peter Capaldi (Doctor Who), Julie Walters (Harry Potter), Jim Broadbent (Hot Fuzz)\n\nWriter/Director: Paul King (Bunny and the Bull)\n\nRuntime: 1 hour 35 minutes\n\nRelease Date: 28 November (UK), 16 January (US)\n\nFilms made for children can be a wonderful thing that fill their burgeoning imaginations with fantastic ideas that appeal to their sense of wonder and irreverent lack of logic. However, they can also be pandering nonsense made by blind corporate types who take kids for granted, treating them like idiots and feeding them obnoxious movies disguised by bright colours and tired humour. This is especially depressing when they take a beloved property and dumb it down for a “modern audience”; see most adaptations of Dr. Seuss books for a good example of that. Paddington Bear has been a fixture in British culture since the 1950s, and it would have been easy to treat the beloved character in a similar fashion. However, I’m happy to report that Paddington, whilst certainly not without its fault, is a charming and delightful film that respects the source material and appeals to all ages.\n\nMuch like any book aimed at children, Paddington tells an incredibly simplistic and well-worn story but does so with a lot of imagination and heart. The plot is extremely predictable and so full of clichés that it ticks almost every single box on the definitive list of clichés, but it manages to get away with it because everything else is handled with so much care and integrity. The film respects everything about the original Michael Bond stories, no matter how bizarre. They could have easily trimmed out the more out-there concepts or treated them with sardonic disdain, but the filmmakers embrace the absurdity and the film is far better for it. Though its old-fashioned and very British sense of humour may be lost on an American audience, that Britishness is an important part of the books and it’s been kept relatively intact. Instead of trying to appeal to a “modern audience” by pointlessly updating it with pop culture references or throwing pop songs on the soundtrack, it honours what it is supposed to be: a Paddington Bear film. That kind of honesty is what really makes Paddington so enjoyable, and it’s something that should really be taken note of. Could a more inventive plot with less reliance on tropes have helped? Possibly. Does its reliance on slapstick and farcical humour wear thin at points? Sometimes. Are the film’s messages and themes of acceptance and family a little too saccharine? At points, yes. But just as Paddington Bear is defined by his own unbridled sense of optimism and kindness, that simplicity and sweetness is what defines these stories and Paddington captures that near perfectly.\n\nBut any film with a basic narrative can be made wonderful by adorning it with a colourful cast of characters, and those found in Paddington are very archetypical but filled with so much enthusiasm and humour that you grow to love them by the end. Paddington himself is voiced wonderfully by Ben Whishaw, inhabiting the naïve and clumsy but well-meaning bear of the books to a T; from his first few minutes of screen time, it’s hard not to like and even feel sorry for him. Hugh Bonneville is well cast as the crotchety but caring Mr Brown, taking could be (and is at points) a very cookie-cutter and predictable character and delivers a very sincere and amusing performance; similar compliments can be made to Sally Hawkins’ Mrs Brown and Julie Walters’ Mrs Bird. Nicole Kidman looks like she’s having a ball playing the cartoonishly sinister villain Millicent Crane, who often seems a little OTT even for this film but is still given enough humanity and even a somewhat understandable back story; it’s little touches like that that make the film that much better. Peter Capaldi and Jim Broadbent’s roles are small but crucial, supplying some great humour during their brief appearances, and the rest of the film is full of recognisable faces from the British film and television industry. The only characters I feel get short shrift are the younger Browns, Jonathan (Samuel Joslin) and Judy (Madeleine Harris), who are amusing but could have been given a bit more focus. Otherwise, much like the story, the cast of Paddington may be given familiar characters to play, but each one is just earnest enough to feel human.\n\nWhat’s probably been keeping Paddington Bear away from the silver screen for a while is technology, but the wait has been worth it. Paddington himself has been wonderfully animated; his expressions and movements give him a distinctive character without making him look like anything other than a bear. Too many times has this effect produced a cartoony and unbelievable effect (see Scooby-Doo or Alvin and the Chipmunks), but here it’s seamless and even award worthy. But it’s not just the effects that impress, because the rest of the visuals are very distinct too. The film captures London in a very candid but exaggerated way, not too dissimilar to its depiction in Mary Poppins, and that approach is very much appreciated. Sometimes the visuals can be a bit much, especially when it ventures into overly stylistic, Wes Anderson-esque territory, but your mileage may vary.\n\nPaddington may well be the biggest surprise of 2014, and a prime example of how to adapt material aimed at young children right. It’s a funny, sweet and heartfelt little adventure, completely unashamed of its childish roots and embraces what makes the original stories so timeless. It’s certainly not anything game changing and the story could have used perhaps more unique elements and less farce, but you could equally argue that it wouldn’t be the same movie without those elements. If you’ve got a kid or are a big kid yourself, I can heartily recommend Paddington. Much like the bear’s coveted marmalade, it may be sickeningly sweet but that doesn’t stop it from being a treat.\n\nFINAL VERDICT: 8.5/10\n\nStarring: Jason Bateman (Arrested Development), Charlie Day (Pacific Rim), Jason Sudeikis (Hall Pass), Chris Pine (Star Trek), Jennifer Aniston (Office Space), Jamie Foxx (The Amazing Spider-Man 2), Kevin Spacey (House of Cards), Christoph Waltz (Django Unchained)\n\nDirector: Sean Anders (That’s My Boy)\n\nWriters: Sean Anders & John Morris (Hot Tub Time Machine)\n\nRuntime: 1 hour 48 minutes\n\nRelease Date: 26 November (US), 28 November (UK)\n\nIf you remember back to my 22 Jump Street review, I mentioned how sequels to comedies are the hardest to pull off and the most likely to fail. A joke is never as funny the second time you tell it, and the best way to get people laughing again is to change it up in a way that makes it feel like an extension of the joke rather than just the same joke. Horrible Bosses 2 doesn’t do that, at least not enough.\n\nIn terms of formula, Horrible Bosses 2 doesn’t stray too far from the ideas established in the first film, which isn’t necessarily a bad thing. If they kept the same structure but then mixed up key plot points in unexpected ways, the sense of familiarity would be kept whilst still providing opportunity for new material. Whilst the film does have one key plot development when Chris Pine’s character becomes a bigger part of the story that does shake things up nicely, the story is otherwise mostly the same but bigger and crazier; the classic mistake of the comedy sequel. The samey plot could be excused if there were laughs to be had, but Horrible Bosses 2 is surprisingly short on those too. I laughed hard maybe once as well as a few chuckles sprinkled throughout, but that’s nowhere near enough for a film that runs nearly two hours long. Without enough good gags, the pacing slows to a crawl far too often and makes the whole experience feel even longer. I remember checking my watch at one point, thinking the film was nearly over, but it was only halfway through; that is never a good sign. Combine all that with the same amount of “lame excuses to cover up plot holes” like in all dumb comedies, a checklist of jokes that come off as both sexist, homophobic or both, and an abrupt ending that leaves our heroes in a state arguably worse than the one they started out with, and you’ve got yourself Horrible Bosses 2.\n\nAny great comedy relies far more on its characters than its plot, and that’s Horrible Bosses 2’s main problem: its characters just don’t work anymore. In the first film, the trio of Bateman, Day and Sudeikis were naïve and inept but more believably so. They would do stupid things, but it came off as more natural. In the sequel, however, everything has been over-exaggerated to the point of annoyance, and our main characters feel more like they belong in a bad sitcom than a feature film. 75% of their humour involves Day and/or Sudeikis saying something stupid and getting caught up in themselves, Bateman pointing out how stupid they are, and then either the pair calm down or they go too far and cause trouble. It’s a routine that gets tired super quick, and the fact that our heroes have become so cartoonish that they’re now unrelatable puts a major damper on the fun. Meanwhile, the rest of the supporting cast is given barely anything to do and most of it is just padding. Jennifer Aniston’s character has gone from hilarious to genuinely creepy and her role could have easily been cut, Kevin Spacey is only in two equally pointless scenes just to pick up a pay check, Jamie Foxx basically does the exact same shtick he did in the last one with no change, and the great Christoph Waltz is completely wasted in a role that could have been played by anyone. Only Chris Pine seems to be trying in an archetypical but humorous role, but he doesn’t become important enough until about halfway through and then he ends up doing exactly what you expect him to do. There’s just a general lack of passion throughout, and if our main characters don’t seem that into what’s happening on screen, why should we be invested?\n\nI will give Horrible Bosses 2 this: some of the visual gags are well executed. A scene where Day’s character has to keep changing his hiding spot in a cupboard is funny, a certain character reveal near the end is cleverly done through good camera work, the film’s twist on the “planning a heist” cliché is unique and full of flair like overly flashy cinematography and transitions, and a car chase near the end is interrupted by a snicker-worthy moment of awkward silence. It is elements like these that make me wonder where all this ingenuity was for the other 85% of the film. Otherwise, it looks and feels like generic comedy filmmaking, with the same bland colour scheme, forgettable score and an heavy reliance on overplayed Top 40 pop and rap songs for the soundtrack (a running gag in the film involves Katy Perry’s “Roar”. I don’t know what’s worse: how obvious that it’ll play into the plot later, or how annoying it is to have to hear that bloody song over and over again).\n\nHorrible Bosses 2 changes things up enough to avoid being in a The Hangover Part II-type situation, but it still makes plenty of the same mistakes that all bad comedy sequels do. It sticks far to close to the formula of the first, the only major change is that everything is bigger and more exaggerated, and by doing so it makes its characters so dumb and annoying that completely negates the humour. I did laugh a few times, but I equally found myself smacking my forehead in annoyance of how stupid these characters were sometimes. If you’re a fan of the first film, it might be worth a look when it comes out on Blu-Ray, but other than that you should stay far away.\n\nFINAL VERDICT: 4.5/10"
