        "text": "2023 was an interesting year for Hollywood. As the industry went through a game-changing strike, several of fall's most highly-anticipated releases were pushed to the next year, while superhero blockbusters arrived in theaters to mid reviews and disappointing box offices. (The two biggest movies of the year—all hail Barbenheimer—weren't superhero films for the first time in a while.) Suffice to say, the action genre could really use a reset.\n\nLuckily, 2024's action movie slate is already filled with exciting new releases, from the Mad Max spinoff Furiosa to collaborations between A-list stars. Below, we're tallying up the action flicks to look out for throughout the coming year.\n\n'The Beekeeper'\n\nRelease date: January 12, 2024\n\nStarring: Jason Statham, Emmy Raver-Lampman, Josh Hutcherson, Bobby Naderi, Minnie Driver, Phylicia Rashad, and Jeremy Irons\n\nWhy It's Worth Watching: Statham plays the titular beekeeper Adam Clay—also a retired assassin for a secret organization (because of course).
