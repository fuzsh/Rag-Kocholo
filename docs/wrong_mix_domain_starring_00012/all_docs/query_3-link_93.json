        "text": "GUY RITCHIE’s recent movies haven’t exactly set the box office alight.\n\nBut he’s now hoping TOM HARDY might stop the rot. I can reveal the director has approached the Brit actor to appear in the live-action remake of Aladdin.\n\nHe wants Tom to play the evil Jafar – I’ve had it mocked up for you and, given Tom’s box-office appeal, it’s a sure-fire way to entice parents to take their kids to the cinema.\n\nA source said: “Guy is a huge fan of Tom’s work and securing him would be a major coup.\n\n“There have been conversations and, although nothing is set in stone and things are subject to change, he’s certainly one of Guy’s favoured choices.\n\n“It just depends on schedules whether he’ll be able to sign up.”\n\nAladdin is the latest Disney animation to be given a live remake, following The Jungle Book, Cinderella – starring LILY JAMES – and Beauty And The Beast.\n\nBeauty grossed £940million, compared to the £100m made by Guy’s recent movie King Arthur: Legend Of The Sword.\n\nTom revealed the sad news yesterday that beloved pet dog Woody has passed away.\n\nThe six-year-old labrador had his time in the sun, accompanying Tom to the 2015 premiere of Kray twins film Legend.\n\nIn a message on his Tumblr page, Tom wrote: “He was an Angel. And he was my best friend. We went through so much together.” A touching tribute.\n\nLily's big fear\n\nLILY JAMES had the role of a lifetime in Cinderella but didn’t always think she’d get her fairytale ending.\n\nThe actress, pictured here on her way to London members’ club LouLou’s on Thursday, admitted she is still terrified of auditions after suffering early rejections.\n\nShe said: “I always have to wear high-neck tops when I audition because I get this bright red rash. I just get so nervous.\n\n“And I do it and I feel slightly dirty after, like, ‘Oh I just had to give that,’ and then they’re, like, ‘OK, bye’. You walk out and you feel cheated.”\n\nLily doesn’t face quite the same challenges now – and will star in Winston Churchill biopic Darkest Hour later this year.\n\nThat should stop her rash for a while.\n\n'My Firth love is singing'\n\nWITH Oscar-winner COLIN FIRTH as his dad and film producer Livia Giuggioli as his mum, schoolboy Luca Firth could have been a cert for movie stardom.\n\nBut he is instead snubbing his screen genes in favour of launching a different career in entertainment.\n\nSinger Luca will tomorrow perform his biggest gig yet, at the Isle of Wight Festival.\n\nHe will be on the Hard Rock stage, which features upcoming stars, and his famous dad will be sat watching at the side.\n\nA source said: “Luca’s only 16 but he thinks the Isle of Wight festival will be the perfect platform to launch his career and showcase his own music.\n\n“Colin is every inch the supportive dad and arrived on the island yesterday to support Luca with other family and friends.”\n\nIf Luca’s singing is as good as his dad’s acting, he’ll be a huge hit.\n\nThe Love Actually star should stick around for a couple more days to see the festival’s headliners.\n\nARCADE FIRE are the big attraction tonight but ROD STEWART is sure to end the weekend in style when he takes the stage tomorrow.\n\nSure Rod is right up Colin’s street.\n\nJames goes Roman\n\nROMAN KEMP only got his Capital FM breakfast show gig a month ago but he’s already been winning praise in high places.\n\nIn an exclusive interview, he revealed: “The first week I had a message from (TV producer) Ben Winston and the second week I had one from JAMES CORDEN.\n\n“And it was like ‘Let’s work together’.\n\n“I’m working on a couple of projects with those guys.”\n\nWembley beckons today for the DJ, who will host Capital’s flagship Summertime Ball in front of 90,000 music fans.\n\nHe said: “If I fall on the stage it could be hilarious.”\n\nCapital’s blooper reel always needs content.\n\nVorderman is unlikely groupie\n\nCAROL VORDERMAN makes an unlikely groupie for gritty hardcore group RUM COMMITTEE."
