        "text": "By Marc S. Sanders\n\nGeorge Miller has never gone deep with his Mad Max movies. The director treasures the inventions of his auto chases and the tricked out diesel junk contraptions that participate in high speed pursuits through his apocalyptic desert wasteland. The more outrageous the vehicles and the crazier the stunts are, the more fulfilled Miller appears to be with his filmmaking. However, the fifth film within this gonzo world of barbaric S & M dressed drivers invites us to explore the past of a surprisingly treasured character, introduced in the prior film. Her name is Furiosa and this time we see what she experienced as a young child (Alyla Browne), followed by what she learns as a young adult (Anya Taylor- Joy). This fifth film in the franchise serves as a prequel to the last film, Mad Max: Fury Road.\n\nAs a pre-teen, Furiosa is abducted by the bandits who serve under the pompous and proud Dr. Dementis (Chris Hemsworth, playing his Thor role as if the Marvel character was a celebratory villain). A thrilling prologue covers this sequence of events with rescue efforts from the would-be heroine’s mother to save Furiosa and bring her back to their secret home of green vegetation located beyond the desert plains. There are heart stopping motorcycle chases with the warrior mother bearing a sniper rifle and fighting with her last breath through the whole sequence. Charlee Fraser portrays the title character’s mother. Thanks to her performance, she had me convinced me that the rescue will deem successful, accompanied by Miller’s reliable direction. An absolutely thrilling opening.\n\nDementis rides his esteemed tri-motorcycle chariot steed, inspired by the sword and sandal adventures of Ben Hur and Gladiator. A hilarious over the top vehicle to see Chris Hemsworth piloting. His biker gang is in tow along with young Furiosa as they journey to the Citadel, first seen in Fury Road. Dementis puts his conceit against that of Immortan Joe (Lachy Hume) the skeleton masked ruler of The Citadel for a chance at…what else? Conquest and power.\n\nFuriosa grows up a few years and gets mentored by a trucker named Praetorian Jack (Tom Burke). I still love these character names by the way. The truck chase is the highlight of the picture, with paragliding motorcycle riders swooping in like large attack birds trying to sabotage the weaponized rig full of delightful surprises that’ll make you shout “OH!!!” in the middle of the theater. It is sequences like this that audiences adore in the Mad Max pictures.\n\nUnlike the other films though, Furiosa gets a little lethargic during the story set ups which are angles that never anchored the other better installments, The Road Warrior and Fury Road. Reintroducing the Immortan Joe character is not as interesting this time and this desert picture gets a little too waterlogged when he enters the story. He just doesn’t feel very necessary. The two younger Furiosas and the self absorbed Dementis are plenty with just enough story opportunities to make a solid movie. Retreading on other characters slow this fifth installment down a bit.\n\nThe whole cast looks great. Anya Taylor-Joy is the best bad ass version of a younger Charlize Theron, who originated the role. She hardly has any lines but her expressions on camera beneath the war paint, grease, dirt and long hair extensions look awesome. Though the lead actress is hilariously dwarfed by Hemsworth’s Dementis, they make for a great dichotomy of hero vs villain. She’s the quiet reserved David. He’s the proud Goliath. This is a dream casting pair.\n\nPractical stunts are done once again and George Miller does impressive work with his camera. His tactics for filming action scenes demonstrate why a Michael Bay normally fails. Nothing is a quick take edit. You watch these motorcycle riders and Furiosa hold onto to the bottom of the speeding truck and Miller will circle the camera, with no cuts in the take, so we see what is happening next to both sides of her profile. The camera will then swoop up to see who’s running and holding on to the top of rig or who is parasailing from a great height while tethered to some kind of buggy vehicle below. Amazing work.\n\nHowever, seeing Furiosa on a large Dolby screen, it’s not hard to see a computer enhanced finish applied to the photography. It’s very glossy and nowhere is it grainy like the very early Mad Max films from over forty years ago. Yet, as dirty as these vehicles and characters are, the cleanliness of the cinematography sometimes does not clash well with what’s on the screen. It’s a little distracting honestly and that was a surprise to me considering how perfect Fury Road looks on my 65-inch flat screen at home. This one looks a little too perfect. This might be that film where less may have been more.\n\nThe background story work on Furiosa is not a terrible grievance. The final print of the picture is acceptable. All of it is definitely worth watching and I hope box office picks up following a sluggish opening weekend because I encourage anyone to see Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga on a big screen first. I just think George Miller and company may have leaped much further than necessary this time around."
