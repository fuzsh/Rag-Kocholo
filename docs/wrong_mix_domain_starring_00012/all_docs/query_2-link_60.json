        "text": "The year ahead does look very exciting for gamers. Some very big hitters are just on the horizon, either coming our way in the next few weeks, or making an appearance sometime during 2011.\n\nOf the ones I’m looking forward to the most, I’d have to place Crysis 2 as my most eagerly anticipated game this year. A sequel to a game I never got to play but heard a great deal about. A first-person shooter set in New York City during an alien invasion where you play as a super soldier with a specialist suit that gives you superhuman strength and other special abilities. Developer’s Crytek have promised an open-ended game world where you can approach any situation from a variety of paths and tactically use your suit’s abilities to infiltrate, creep up on and generally overthrown the alien scum. As Crytek are renowned for their expertise with graphics and artificial intelligence, from the brief snippets of gameplay and leaked footage I’ve seen, this could very much become a classic in the industry.\n\nAnother game that has got me excited is the Rockstar Games developed L.A. Noir. Sort of Grand Theft Auto meets LA Confidential where you play through a rookie Cop’s ever evolving career as he rises up the ladder solving crimes and taking down bad guys. The game is revolutionary for its use of motion capture facial animation and promises to change the way you play games with gameplay mechanics such as looking at a witness’s face to figure out if he’s telling the truth or lying. This looks kinda like this year’s Heavy Rain with its deep movie-like storyline and fleshed out characters, and will certainly be one of the more unique games this year.\n\nEpic Games returns with the latest entry in its gung-ho shooter series, namely Gears Of War 3. Although I had a few issues with some of the gameplay and level design choices of Gears 2, I will still be picking this up just for it’s unrivalled shooting action, it’s never-bettered cover system and it’s stunning visual design, something which is a given when the game uses Epic’s much celebrated Unreal Engine 3 technology.\n\nI.D. games makes a comeback too with open-world shooter / adventure Rage, a Mad-Max inspired post-apocolyptic actioner with ground breaking graphics and industry applauded design. I.D. have rarely disappointed in the past, considering they were behind such classics as Doom and Quake, and with a helluva lot to prove considering their long hiatus, this will hopefully be well worth the wait.\n\nPortal 2 will also be a sure bet when it arrives, coming from the genius game designer’s at Valve, the guys responsible for my favourite game of all time, Half-Life 2, and following on from the highly regarded, brilliantly designed Portal, this promises to be an evolution in the puzzle game genre, with as expected Valve’s unique sense of humour, gifted story telling and superb game mechanics.\n\nSo to conclude. 2011 look like being a classic year for video games. Some of the titles mentioned could well go onto to be award winners and looked back on as milestones in their field. I will hopefully be getting my hands on all of them in the months to come, so expect my usual impressions when that happens.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nCrytek CEO: Crysis 2 “wouldn’t have been possible with any other engine” other than CryEngine 3 (news.bigdownload.com)\n\nGamesblog Live: Crytek’s Nathan Camarillo on Nanosuits and 3D (guardian.co.uk)\n\nViewed – 21 February 2011 Online rental\n\nI’ve made no secret of my almost obsessive love of the horror genre. For me there is little that compares to the atmosphere, the thrills and the pure adrenaline of a good horror movie, and some of the best movies ever made in my opinion, have come from that genre. So naturally this throwback to late seventies / early eighties chillers came as an easy proposition for me.\n\nNewcomer Jocelin Donahue plays struggling student Samantha, who applies for a job as a babysitter to an ageing couple at a house in the middle of the countryside (!). Now despite the concerns of her best friend after the couple turn out to be more than a little strange, Samantha accepts the job, spending an eventful evening at the creepy house.\n\nDirected by relative newcomer Ti West, this shockingly authentic retread of early eighties horror borrows heavily from the likes of The Exorcist, Suspiria, Rosemary’s Baby and The Omen. Tension is gradually built up, helped by an eerie score and superbly shot camera work that makes every shadow and corridor unnerving, and when the shocks come, this viewer was left really shaken. Ti West’s movie may offer little new to the genre, but he certainly knows how to make an effective and gripping experience, that thankfully delivers when it needs to and holds back long enough to make you a nervous wreck. It may feel rushed at the end, with some confusing moments and a little too much build up, but these are small gripes for what is otherwise an impressive ‘celebration’ of a genre back when it really had some balls.\n\nVerdict: 4 /5\n\nRelated articles\n\nReview: The Innkeepers, 2012, dir.
