My Life So Far (1999)

An adventurous boy and his family learn about life and love when his uncle’s fiancee comes to visit. A delightfully charming comedy about the fun and awkwardness of growing up. Set in the late 1920s on an estate in Scotland, the period drama is based on the memoirs of Denis Forman. Colin Firth stars as Edward, the father of the family.

”My Life So Far,” a winsome childhood reverie of family life in Argyll, Scotland, in the late 1920’s, offers such a muted, smoothly textured swatch of British nostalgia that you feel no qualms about languishing in its ”Masterpiece Theater” vision of a safer, saner, more shining past. With its soft-focus portrait of a mildly troubled family viewed through the adoring eyes of a frisky little boy, it suggests Ingmar Bergman’s ”Fanny and Alexander” with all its demons comfortably subdued. – New York Times

The Turn of the Screw (1999)

Based on the story by Henry James with the screenplay written by Nick Dear (Persuasion) and starring Colin Firth, Pam Ferris and Jodhi May. An adaptation of Henry James’s classic ghost story of psychological suspense, shown on PBS Masterpiece.

“Jodhi May, with her warm and open demeanor, is perfectly cast as “Miss,” the generically named governess at a grand British estate. Her charges are two seemingly angelic little orphans. Miss can’t believe her good fortune at landing such a delightful job. “Am I dreaming?” she asks kindly, corpulent housekeeper Mrs. Grose (Pam Ferris). But dream turns to nightmare as the house’s spectral inhabitants reveal themselves to her. Miss becomes obsessed with protecting her precious “little creatures” from the vile phantasms. The movie is satisfyingly spooky and makes us jump in all the right places. This provocative adaptation of The Turn of the Screw breathes new life into James’s morbid Victorian obsession with sexuality and morality.” – Laura Mirsky

Set in Los Angeles in 1962, at the height of the Cuban missile crisis, it is the story of a British college professor (Colin Firth) who is struggling to find meaning to his life after the death of his long time partner.

“Colin Firth gives the performance of a lifetime in A Single Man, a drama directed and adapted for the screen by fashion designer Tom Ford, who clearly has a deft vision and ability in the world of film as well.
