The Skins actor - who's up for the Orange Rising Star gong at the Baftas - is rumoured to have landed the role of Nux in the highly anticipated action thriller, alongside Charlize Theron and Tom Hardy, with Zoe Kravitz, the daughter of singer Lenny, in negotiations to appear.

According to The Hollywood Reporter, the film, the fourth in the franchise, is set some time after 1985's Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome, keeping Mad Max (the character which made Mel Gibson famous) young.

Mad Max 4: Fury Road, which has been the subject of talks for the past two decades, is expected to start filming in Australia this summer.

Nicholas - who made his big screen debut in About A Boy - will next be seen alongside Colin Firth in A Single Man. He is also starring with Sam Worthington, Liam Neeson and Ralph Fiennes in the remake of Clash Of The Titans.
