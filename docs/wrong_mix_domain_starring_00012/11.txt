Colin Firth will reportedly star in upcoming thriller Eye in the Sky.

Ender's Game director Gavin Hood will helm the project, which follows a military intelligence officer charged with remotely commanding a top-secret drone operation to capture a group of terrorists from their safe-house in Nairobi.

The script has been penned by Guy Hibbert, the writer of Channel 4 series Complicit. According to Screen Daily, producers will seek funding at the upcoming Cannes film festival.

Firth's own production company Raindog Films is also involved in the project, which hopes to start shooting in South Africa this August.

Firth said that he was pleased to be involved in a movie that explores such a "crucial issue".

"The use of unmanned aircraft in modern warfare and in the so-called 'war on terror' poses critical questions for us all," he added.
