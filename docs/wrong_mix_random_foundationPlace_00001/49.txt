Ford today opens the Research and Innovation Center Palo Alto, growing its global research team and accelerating the companyâs innovation in connectivity, mobility, autonomous vehicles, customer experience and big data.

âAt Ford, we view ourselves as both a mobility and an auto company, as we drive innovation in every part of our business,â said Mark Fields, Ford Motor Company president and CEO. âThis new research center shows Fordâs commitment to be part of the Silicon Valley innovation ecosystem â anticipating customersâ wants and needs, especially on connectivity, mobility and autonomous vehicles. We are working to make these new technologies accessible to everyone, not just luxury customers.â

The all-new Research and Innovation Center Palo Alto joins Fordâs global network of research and innovation centers, including its location in Dearborn, Michigan, which focuses on advanced electronics, human-machine interface, materials science, big data and analytics; and Aachen, Germany, which focuses on next-generation powertrain research, driver-assist technologies and active safety systems.

With the new facility, Ford expects to have one of the largest automotive manufacturer research centers in Silicon Valley by the end of the year, with 125 researchers, engineers and scientists. Located in Stanford Research Park, the facility also expands Fordâs physical footprint â with further expansion planned in the near future. Ford opened its first Silicon Valley office in 2012.

Leading the new research center is Dragos Maciuca, an engineer who joins Ford from Apple with a background in consumer electronics, semiconductor manufacturing, aerospace and automotive. As senior technical leader for innovation, Maciuca brings extensive Silicon Valley experience advising startups, developing and commercializing products, collaborating with universities and leading cross-functional teams. Maciuca holds a Ph.D. in Mechanical Engineering from University of California, Berkeley and an MBA from its Haas School of Business.

Earlier this month, the company introduced Ford Smart Mobility at the 2015 International CES. It outlines Fordâs plans to accelerate innovation in connectivity, mobility, autonomous vehicles, customer experience and big data. The Palo Alto team plays a critical role in research and development in these areas.

âFuture mobility solutions will require fresh ideas and vigorous collaboration between researchers inside Ford and with other technology leaders outside the automotive industry,â said Raj Nair, Ford group vice president, Global Product Development and chief technical officer. âOur Palo Alto research team will build on existing relationships with universities and technology companies, and forge new ones to help us create and apply the appropriate technology working together.â

At todayâs opening event, Ford offered a sneak peek at some of its projects in key areas, including:
