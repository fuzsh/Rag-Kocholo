The subcommittee met, pursuant to notice, at 1:30 p.m., in room 2154, Rayburn House Office Building, Hon. Stephen Horn (chairman of the subcommittee) presiding. Present: Representatives Horn, Turner, and Kanjorski. Staff present: Russell George, staff director/chief counsel; Matthew Ebert, policy advisor; Bonnie Heald, director of communications; Faith Weiss, minority counsel; Ellen Rayner, minority chief clerk; and Earley Green, minority staff assistant. Mr. Horn. A quorum being present, this hearing of the Subcommittee on Government Management, Information, and Technology will come to order. Thirty years ago, the salary of the President of the United States was set at its current level of $200,000 a year. I'm sure that to most Americans a salary of that amount seems like a lot of money. It is. However, it is pay for one of the most difficult, demanding and important jobs on the face of the Earth. The President's salary, unchanged in 3 decades, serves as a ceiling for almost every other salary in the Federal Government. I said ``almost'' every other salary because, as will be discussed during this hearing, it could soon be surpassed by a limited number of government officials. This hearing is not about whether President Clinton should get a pay raise. The Constitution prohibits Presidential pay changes until the end of the current President's term in office. Article II, Section 1 of the Constitution states: The President shall, at stated Times, receive for his Services, a Compensation, which shall neither be increased nor diminished during the Period for which he shall have been elected, and he shall not receive within that Period any other Emolument from the United States, or any of them. In other words, the President's salary cannot be changed during his term in office. The effect of that prohibition is that if no action is taken before the next President is sworn into office, he or she could be paid less than the Vice President. Vice President Gore as well as the Chief Justice of the United States and the Speaker of the House currently earn $175,400 a year. These officials also receive cost-of-living adjustments to their salaries. As we will hear today, the Vice President, the Chief Justice and the Speaker of the House could earn each more than the President before the next Presidential term ends in 2005. When President George Washington took office in the year 1789, the salary of the President was established at $25,000 a year. At that time, Vice President John Adams earned $5,000 a year, Chief Justice John Jay earned $4,000 a year, and members of the President's Cabinet made $3,500 a year. According to computations made by the Congressional Research Service, by one measure President Washington's $25,000 salary equates to more than $4.5 million today. Now a number of the witnesses have made that calculation, and I was reminded of President Truman's great comment that I want a one-armed economist here because they're always saying on the one hand or the other hand, and he was tired of listening to it. And we have several figures in the record today. But, in any case, we know that it was substantial; and $4.5 million is certainly a significant figure. On May 14th, the House Appropriations Subcommittee on Treasury, Postal Service and General Government included a provision in the Treasury appropriations bill that would increase the President's salary to $400,000, effective January 20, 2001. The full Committee on Appropriations is expected to act on this recommendation shortly. And at today's hearing we will hear from the most distinguished assortment of witnesses who will testify about whether the President's salary should be changed. Before I introduce the first panel, I'll yield to the ranking member, Mr. Turner of Texas, for an opening statement. Mr. Turner. [The prepared statement of Hon. Stephen Horn follows:] [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T2932.001 [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T2932.002 Mr. Turner. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. It's interesting to note that when Babe Ruth was asked in the early 1930's how in the world he could ask for a higher salary than President Hoover's, he replied, ``I had a better year than he did.'' And of course that was true because Babe Ruth had 46 home runs in 1929 and Hoover presided over the crash of the stock market. I guess that's a humorous example of problems inherent in trying to compare private sector pay with the President's salary. Clearly, the factors considered while negotiating salary with baseball players differ significantly from those considered setting the President's. But, nonetheless, it is true that the salaries of typical chief executive officers in this country are increasing rapidly, while the salary of our President remains static. People enter public service, of course, for reasons other than financial compensation, as all of us understand. Clearly individuals with qualifications and contacts to be elected as President could garner extremely high salaries in the competitive business market, yet they choose not to do so. Presidents run for office because they believe in making a difference and improving the lives of American citizens. In fact, President George Washington announced that he would forego his constitutional compensation, declaring that his sense of duty required him to serve the country without pay. Congress didn't allow him to do so, however, and passed a statute setting his pay at $25,000 per year. John Page of Virginia stated at the time that the Constitution requires that the President shall receive compensation, and it's our duty to provide it. The constitutional intent is to assure the financial independence of the President so that he would not be impoverished and not be susceptible to corruption which might jeopardize the public interest. Alexander Hamilton noted in the Federalist Papers, ``Power over a man's support is power over his will.'' The restriction against increasing the President's salary during an administration ensures that the Congress cannot influence the President by appealing to his avarice. Certainly the past concerns of our Founding Fathers remain true today, and the question of whether the current level of salary would likely make the President susceptible to corrupt influences should be explored. The prospect of the Vice President's salary overtaking that of the President will also be discussed, and there is reason to learn the lessons of history on this point as well. While the Constitution said nothing about the Vice President's salary, it did create the office; and the first Congress made it clear that some compensation was necessary. Fisher Ames, one of the first Members of Congress, suggested that if competent support is not allowed for the Vice President, the choice will be confined to opulent characters. This is an aristocratic idea and contravenes, I think, the spirit of the Constitution. When a House committee proposed paying the Vice President $5,000 a year, John White of Virginia objected to the princely sum; and Representative Page responded that he would never have created the Office of the Vice President, but since we've got him, he said, we must maintain him. From these comments we can draw two additional important conclusions. First, the salary provided to the President and the Vice President, indeed to all high-level Federal officials, should be adequate to maintain qualified individuals; and, second, the salary should allow for those who are not independently wealthy to serve in these positions. I think these two simple principles should guide us in our consideration of the President's compensation: the assurance that a President's financial condition will not make him or her susceptible to corruption, and the allowance for those who are qualified and not independently wealthy to hold office if so elected or appointed. Having said that, I look forward, Mr. Chairman, to the distinguished panel that you have gathered here before us today. Mr. Horn. I thank the gentleman. And let me just note the way the procedure will follow. The witnesses have been arranged so that the earliest, shall we say, of the group in the Johnson administration would be the first witness, and the last in the group will be the current administration. I will do an introduction on each one of you before you speak. This is an investigating subcommittee of the full Committee on Government Reform, and our tradition is to swear in all witnesses. So you've taken the oath many times. And if you all will stand we'll swear you in and then begin. [Witnesses affirmed.] Mr. Horn. The clerk will note that all the witnesses have affirmed the oath. We will begin with the first witness, from the Johnson administration, Ambassador James R. Jones. Now, when I introduce you, your full statement is automatically part of the record and any attachments you want to add to it. And then we'd like to have mostly a dialog when you're all done. And if you would like to summarize, we would not be offended by that. Ambassador Jones a number of us have known for 30 years. He was a Member of Congress. And I remember when I was in Education he did a wonderful job to help get the budget moving for higher education in this country. And he began his career at the White House, which was very unusual. Usually, it's a more senior person that begins the career there, after they're 30 or 40 or 50. He graduated from law school and then became staff assistant to President Lyndon Johnson. At the age of 28, he was appointed Special Assistant and Appointment Secretary to the President. He was the youngest person to ever hold that post. After leaving the White House, he represented his Oklahoma congressional district for 7 terms in the House of Representatives. While a Member of the House, he served as chairman of the Budget Committee and a member of the Ways and Means Committee, the most prestigious committee in the House, and the one that goes back the furthest in our constitutional history. He was then appointed Ambassador to Mexico in 1993 and during his 4-year Ambassadorship Mexico faced serious economic crisis with the devaluation of the peso and other economic challenges involving implementation of the North Atlantic Fair Trade Agreement, otherwise known as NAFTA. The Ambassador has been honored by both the United States and the Mexican Governments for his leadership. We welcome you, Mr. Ambassador, to what was once your home here; and we look forward to your testimony. STATEMENTS OF AMBASSADOR JAMES R. JONES, COUNSEL, MANATT, PHELPS & PHILIPS, FORMER SPECIAL ASSISTANT TO PRESIDENT JOHNSON; GENERAL ALEXANDER HAIG, CHAIRMAN, WORLDWIDE ASSOCIATES, FORMER CHIEF OF STAFF TO PRESIDENT NIXON; ROBERT T. HARTMANN, FORMER COUNSEL TO PRESIDENT FORD; KENNETH DUBERSTEIN, CHAIRMAN, THE DUBERSTEIN GROUP, FORMER CHIEF OF STAFF TO PRESIDENT REAGAN; GOVERNOR JOHN H. SUNUNU, PRESIDENT, JHS ASSOCIATES, FORMER CHIEF OF STAFF TO PRESIDENT BUSH; SAMUEL SKINNER, CO-CHAIR, HOPKINS & SUTTER, FORMER CHIEF OF STAFF TO PRESIDENT BUSH; AND THOMAS F. ``MACK'' MCLARTY III, CHAIRMAN, MCLARTY INTERNATIONAL, FORMER CHIEF OF STAFF TO PRESIDENT CLINTON Mr. Jones. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman, members of the committee, for giving me an opportunity to testify. In brief, let me just state that the proposal to double the President's salary to $400,000 is something I totally support. I will tell you that in my 14 years in Congress, this is the first time I've had to take the oath to testify in that pay raise proposal. But I do believe it's a great favor to do so. Basically, there are two or three reasons why I think the committee and the Congress should move rapidly and approve this proposal. The last budget of the Johnson administration, 31 years ago, was the last time the President received a pay raise. This took effect the first year of President Nixon's administration. And it is high time after 30 years that it be revisited for a number of reasons. No. 1 is the symbolism of the respect we have for that office. Having been in the private sector now for several years since leaving the Congress, I can tell you that the President's salary would rank at about mid-level management of an average company in the United States; and if you raised it to $400,000, it would be about equivalent to the CEO's salary of a mid-level company in the United States. Now, as was said by Mr. Turner, people don't go into public service for the salary, for the wages, the benefits; you go in to serve. But the fact of the matter is, in this country, particularly with business having such a dominant part in our lives, people do respect or not respect an office based upon what we consider that office's worth to the person who holds it. Second, there are expenses incurred when you're President; and those expenses are both the living in the White House, in addition to what is provided to the President, but also in maintaining your outside commitments, whether that be a personal home or payments for education, all the things that go with the normal family. Presidents have those expenses, and even if most Presidents can fully afford to pay them themselves, there ought to be some recognition that those who cannot should be able to be President and meet their expenses. The final reason that I think is very important is the effect that the President's salary has on other incomes. I have served as a Member of Congress, as you say. As an ambassador and as a Member of Congress virtually every year, every month. We breathed a sigh of relief when my wife and I made it over the line, were able to educate our kids, et cetera, without having to borrow a lot of money, et cetera. Before being an ambassador, I had had time in the private sector and was able to afford the costs that most Ambassadors pay from their personal resources to meet the regular expenses of running an embassy and representing the United States. I think that's clearly true of most people in public office. And if the President's salary is not raised, as was pointed out in your opening remarks, other incomes of high-level officials in our Federal Government will start bumping up or exceeding the President's salary, and there will be no opportunity for another 4 years to raise that and to raise the other salaries. I personally think that if you took the salaries of all Federal officials from the President throughout, and including Members of Congress, at the time the salaries were established and brought them forward with nothing more than cost-of-living adjustments, also adjusting for times of depression when you have a depreciation, everyone in the Federal Government would be substantially underpaid on that particular scale. So, I think the effect on the salaries of other Federal officials of holding the line of the President's salary is terribly important, because we do want to attract the most competent, the best people we can to public service. And when these public servants have to support sometimes two homes, et cetera, and all the expenses of living, you need to pay those competent people what they're worth. Mr. Horn. I thank you very much, Ambassador. We will now introduce General Alexander M. Haig, Jr., a very long and distinguished career that most Americans know about. He served more than 3 decades in the U.S. Army and rose to be a four star General. That included tours in Japan, Korea, Europe, and Vietnam, highly decorated for all of the posts he held in the military. And in 1969 he was assigned to the staff of Dr. Henry Kissinger, then the assistant to the President for national security affairs in the Nixon administration. During that tenure in the White House, General Haig made about 14 trips to Southeast Asia on behalf of the President to negotiate the Vietnam cease-fire and the return of United States prisoners of war. He resigned from the military service when President Nixon appointed him White House Chief of Staff. General Haig remained in that position until 1974 when President Ford recalled him to active duty as Commander in Chief of the United States European Command and later as Supreme Allied Commander in Europe. Two years after he retired from the Army, General Haig became the Nation's 59th Secretary of State in the Cabinet of President Ronald Reagan. Mr. Horn. We welcome you, General. We look forward to your testimony. General Haig. Thank you very much, Chairman Horn. I want to compliment the subcommittee for holding these very timely sessions which I think are overdue. I hope they will result in action. The only complaint I have is you should put me in the first chair because I sat alongside General Douglas MacArthur during his telecon discussions with President Harry Truman at the time of the North Korean invasion of South Korea. So I go back through eight Presidents, seven of whom I served fairly closely, four at intimate range. The most learning experience I got with President Nixon, during 18 months of Watergate. I also served with Bob Hartmann here during the transition of President Ford. I served President Kennedy as a member of his Cuban Coordinating Committee, where a lot of nefarious actions took place that they are only recently being written about. I also served as Pentagon liaison to the Johnson administration and knew President Johnson well and admired him greatly. Beyond that, as NATO Commander, President Ford and, of course, President Carter, and I met almost monthly. So I think I knew some of the Presidential travails. And finally, I served as Secretary of State for President Reagan. All of these gentlemen testifying today bear scar tissue, but I think I have the largest load of it. And, having said that, I heartily endorse everything Ambassador Jones has said. I'm not going to repeat any of the points he made. I will say that I think today the Presidency is more unique, more challenging and more complex than it has ever been historically; and, in that context, what I mean to say is that Presidents are learning these complexities. They don't have the luxury of choosing between foreign affairs and domestic affairs in the conduct of their office. As the last two Presidents have learned you have got to deal with both foreign affairs and domestic affairs simultaneously, and you can't succeed in one if you fail in the other. So that's a reality which has added to the complication in a new world in which globalization is the native of this world. Second is the impact of the explosion of information sciences on the institution of the Presidency. Today, the President lives in a world of real time. Whether it be video or voice, people demand answers almost instantaneously to every national crisis that develops or any international crisis that develops. Needless to say this has not had what I call a complimentary impact on the institution of the Presidency. It means that todays President has got to proceed almost immediately to make decisions on things that should be thought about for weeks, if not months; and it leads to what I call miscalculations and misjudgments by our chief executive. Also, I think it has developed a new character to the Office of the Presidency. It has produced the modern populist, the fellow that has to run his office with his finger to the wind, rather than bequided by the principles and values which he brought with him into the job. Now, having said all that, I can tell you, as a former chief executive or chief operating officer of one of our Fortune 500 multinational companies, that government pay is very, very poor. Also today the thought of a Vice President or Chief Justice or someone else in the government exceeding in pay the President of the United States is just simply unacceptable. To give you an idea of poor pay in government service--when I was with United Technologies Corp., left command of--5 million active and reserve troops in Europe, I received a 20- fold pay increase in moving from four star General to Chief Operating Officer of United Technologies Corp. Had I stayed with that job and been successful, today I would be being paid over $3.5 million in annual salary with hundreds of millions of dollars in stock options, to say nothing of a retirement pay built on about $20 million of interest-producing revenue which is guaranteed and insured. However, we know we can't pay Presidents in accordance with their unique job requirements. There is no tougher job in the world than the Presidency of the United States. He is not just head of state, he is also head of government. So both operations and also presentation of values and heritage are all mingled into one job. If you fail, you fail. You are the one that's held responsible. When Truman said the buck stops here, he wasn't off the mark. I don't think we can match what private sector presidents earn. We know Presidents don't seek the job because of the emoluments that it brings. But I do think we have to guarantee the dignity of the individual. And that means his clothing, his family monetary requirements, the education of his children if he has them; and, above all, we shouldn't put in jeopardy what assets the Presidents bring to the office. I served one President who left $400,000 in debt having to pay the legal fees that sometimes develop during the modern Presidency. So I think we have got to move and move promptly. In that sense I would strongly recommend that we go even above the Appropriations Committee recommended salary to a level of $500,000, which is very low compared to comparable commercial salaries. If this committee believes that it would be quicker and a bipartisan consensus could be developed and it would be more efficiently done, than $400,000 is better than nothing. I also believe that the legislature, the Congress has got to look at the President's retirement pay, which is also less by a large measure than what it should be. And, finally, I would suggest that these benefits or allowances be reviewed in the third term of every Presidency to be sure that pay is keeping pace with the dynamics of our economy. That's my feeling, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Horn. Thank you very much, General. [The prepared statement of General Haig follows:] [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T2932.003 [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T2932.004 [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T2932.005 [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T2932.006 [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T2932.007 [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T2932.008 [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T2932.009 [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T2932.010 [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T2932.011 Mr. Horn. We now move to Mr. Robert T. Hartmann, highly acclaimed reporter and writer before his 1974 appointment by President Gerald Ford as counselor to the President. During his tenure in the Cabinet-level position, Mr. Hartmann participated in White House policymaking sessions, accompanied the President on numerous campaign trips and visits to Europe, the Far East and Soviet Union. In addition, Mr. Hartmann oversaw the research and correspondence writing staffs at the White House, personally drafted and edited most of President Ford's statements and speeches. Before joining the President's staff, Mr. Hartmann spent more than 2 decades as a journalist for the Los Angeles Times; and he was the Washington Bureau head here in the late 1950's and 1960's. Before he became the Times Washington Bureau Chief, he covered Congress and the White House, later established the newspaper's Mediterranean and Middle East Bureau in Rome, Italy; and throughout his career in journalism Mr. Hartmann has received numerous honors for his reporting and writing. We're glad to welcome you today, Mr. Hartmann. Mr. Hartmann. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, members of the committee. Although President Ford's term as President was one of the shortest in our history, I hope to approach the subject from a somewhat broader perspective than that of the White House I spent a great deal of time covering the Hill and working on the Hill when he was the minority leader of the Congress of the House. When I arrived in Washington the year was 1954. It was sort of a general understanding that I was going to be paid about the same as a Member of Congress. At that time, this sum was $2,500. President Eisenhower got $100,000. The Chief Justice, former California Governor Earl Warren got $35,500; and Vice President Nixon, also a Californian, was cut $500 and got $35,000 even. I expect that annoyed him quite a bit. I detail all this to make the point that's already been made, that Federal salaries, in Washington particularly, depend on the President's pay. The President's pay helps set the benchmarks for almost everybody else in town. A dozen years after I got here to serve as chief of the Los Angeles Times Washington Bureau, I went to work for Gerry Ford, who had just been elected House minority leader; he and a group of relatively young, Republican Congressmen hoped to create a new, more vigorous and more progressive image for their party than had been represented by Charlie Halleck and Ev Dirksen, who appeared on television every week to conduct ``The Ev and Charlie Show,'' as it was called. Now, Ford had just succeeded Halleck, and was waging an uphill battle trying to get equal time with Dirksen, which wasn't easy. I didn't volunteer to offer to help win that one. But we did shift the battlefield by challenging President Johnson himself at every opportunity. We even demanded equal time from the networks to put on our reply or rebuttal to the President's annual State of the Union message. I must add that I was in no way responsible for the public's prompt abbreviation of our constructive Republican alternative proposals. Now, a few thoughts about how we should pay our Presidents. Some of them have already been uttered, but I can't revise my script now. First, you can never match the President's salary, to the depth and degree of responsibility that he carries in that job. It is a totally consuming responsibility without any equal of which I'm aware and of a magnitude which can be appreciated only by another President. Second, the compensations of the office are considerable, but money is really only a minor one of them. Power, perks, pensions, protection and a place in history loom much larger in most Presidents' minds. As the minority leader in the House, Congressman Ford was debating Vice President Hubert Humphrey before the Gridiron Club's annual dinner, and he assured Humphrey that he had absolutely no designs on the Vice Presidency. Nevertheless, Ford admitted, every evening as he drove by the White House on his way home, he heard a small voice saying, ``If you lived here, you'd be home now.'' I expect he's still using that joke. In 1969, after the President had remained at $100,000 for 2 decades, Congress doubled that sum to $200,000 and fixed its own pay at $42,500. This gave me a welcome $6,500 raise as an assistant here on the Hill, and it also raised almost everybody else's. Now, after 30 years, you are considering doubling this to $400,000 because the salaries of other Federal officials not limited by the Constitution are pushing upward on the chief executive's. I won't say that public servants--as we love to style ourselves--are poorly paid or that their pensions are miserly. As Richard Nixon was wont to say, that would not be right. But the question before you today is not primarily about the next President's pay; it is about everybody's pay who works for the government. If I may paraphrase a wise old paraphrase, we have seen the government, and it is us. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and members of the committee. Mr. Horn. Thank you very much. We appreciate your comments. [The prepared statement of Mr. Hartmann follows:] [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T2932.012 [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T2932.013 Mr. Horn. Our next representative is well known in Washington. Mr. Kenneth M. Duberstein is chairman and chief executive of the Duberstein Group, and he served as chief of staff to President Ronald Reagan. Since then, I might say, he's regarded as one of the most effective advocates on Capitol Hill. So he learned a lot, and he brings a great deal of experience to this particular panel. Prior to assuming the post in 1987, Mr. Duberstein had served as an advisor to the President on legislative affairs. Although he came from the private sector, he was no stranger to public service; and from 1972 to 1976 he held the position of Director of Congressional Intergovernmental Affairs for the General Services Administration, later served as Deputy Under Secretary of Labor during the Ford administration. He was awarded the President's Citizen Medal by President Reagan in 1989. And as well as presiding over his Washington-based consulting firm, he's a member of the Council on Foreign Affairs and Foreign Relations and serves on the Board of Governors of the American Stock Exchange and vice chairman of the Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts, one of the great centers of performing arts in our Nation. Mr. Horn. We're glad to welcome you back and look forward to your testimony, Mr. Duberstein. Mr. Duberstein. Thank you, Chairman Horn, Congressman Turner. It's a pleasure to be here; and it's a privilege to be on this panel with so many distinguished colleagues, all of whom were taller, much taller before each served as a White House Chief of Staff. I am pleased to testify today strongly in favor of a long- overdue substantial salary increase to $400,000 for the next President of the United States. This is not even a close call, Mr. Chairman. This needs to be addressed now. It is a case of simple equity. This is not about a President, this is about the Presidency. This is about the compensation of the leader of the free world, not about the salary of the chief of a not-very- well-run small startup company or the head of a Third World country. This is about our chief executive officer, not the retired chairman of the board who has been put out to pasture. This is about the stature and prestige of the leader of the government of the United States and the person charged with truly awesome responsibilities, here at home and throughout the world. To put this in some perspective, the salary of the President of the United States has not been increased since those long-ago days when the Dow Jones average was below $1,000, Neil Armstrong had not yet walked on the moon, the ``Amazin'' Mets hadn't won their first World Series, Strom Thurmond was a mere child of 66, Charles DeGaulle was President of France, and Golda Meir was the Prime Minister of Israel. It was the age of Aquarius, before Woodstock, before the Concorde's maiden flight, and construction of Walt Disney World in Orlando, FL. It was a much easier time before C-SPAN, cable TV, the Internet, and 24 continuous news cycles. No one should run for the Presidency for the money. But it deserves remuneration well beyond public housing, public transportation, and maid service. Keeping up with the inflation alone since 1969 should result in a sizable pay increase. I support strongly, Mr. Chairman, the proposal for a $400,000 salary for the President. I am concerned, as other members of the panel have stated as well, with the pay compression for senior executive service personnel as well as for the Vice President, the Chief Justice, and others. I hope this committee and the Congress will move expeditiously to increase the salary of the Presidency beginning in January 2001. Thank you very much. Mr. Horn. Thank you. Appreciate your testimony. [The prepared statement of Mr. Duberstein follows:] [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T2932.014 [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T2932.015 Mr. Horn. Our next speaker is probably fairly widely known across the country. That's Governor John H. Sununu, former Governor of New Hampshire. He served as Chief of Staff to President George Bush from 1989 to 1991. In his high-level advisory position, he oversaw the daily operations of the White House and its staff. He also served as Counselor to the President, remains a member of the Board of Trustees for the George Bush Presidential Library Foundation. Before joining the President's staff, Governor Sununu served three consecutive terms as New Hampshire's 93rd Governor. He gained regional and national recognition as chairman of the Coalition of Northeastern Governors, chairman of the Republican Governors Association, and chairman of the National Governors Association. From 1968 until 1973, the Governor, who holds a doctorate degree in mechanical engineering from probably our leading institution of science and engineering, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, served as Associate Dean of the College of Engineering at Tufts and Associate Professor of Mechanical Engineering. So he's had experience in the academic world which some would say is tougher than the political world because they never forget. But he took the easy route. He elected himself three times as Governor of New Hampshire; and he follows in a great tradition of one Sherman Adams, who was also a great Governor of New Hampshire and Chief of Staff to President Eisenhower. Welcome, Governor Sununu. Mr. Sununu. Thank you very much Chairman Horn, Mr. Turner. I, too, appreciate this opportunity to talk about an issue that I do believe is a very significant one. I have no disagreement with any of the comments made by my colleagues on the panel. I just want to emphasize a couple of points and then make one what I hope is an additional point for your consideration. Mr. Chairman, the $4.5 million that the $25,000 salary that George Washington received in 1789 represents merely a 2.5 percent inflation rate on an annual basis, and as we look around at historic inflation rates we realize that we are patting ourselves on the back when we keep it that low. So it is an underestimate of what that might have been scaled up to if it had continued to be scaled in a fair way. I think it's important to recognize, though, that the issue before you, if we look at it in economic terms, we would come with these huge salaries. But you are sensitive, as I think all of us here on the panel have to be sensitive, to the fact that we are talking about a political issue; and, therefore, I believe that you will be forced and, in fact, will have to examine the level of this salary in the context of what is politically acceptable to the public of the United States at this time. And, therefore, in the paper I presented as my prepared remarks, I had a number of--which was selected before you focused on the $400,000. I suggested a number of $500,000. But I can wholeheartedly endorse the $400,000 that you are examining as a specific increase. But the second point I would like to make is that I do suggest that one of the problems--we have reached this position of a lack of equity is that the review in the change of the salary of the President of the United States has incurred, in fact, too infrequently; and, therefore, I would recommend to the committee that they seek a way to establish in law a statutory review period which would require the Congress not to raise the salary on a periodic basis but to review the salary for the possibility of raising it on a periodic basis. And I would suggest that a statutory obligation of an 8- or 12-year period be established for that review. I would suggest that with the obligation of review on that periodic basis and what we would hope would be a series of enlightened Congresses that would follow that over a period of time a salary that is politically acceptable would begin to approach one that is economically appropriate for this, which is arguably the position of responsibility which deserves probably the highest salary of anyone in the world. It is, I think, that mechanism which I present for your consideration which could begin to alleviate the historic disparity that seems to exist in the salary of the President and comparable levels of responsibility around the world. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Horn. Thank you. [The prepared statement of Mr. Sununu follows:] [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T2932.016 [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T2932.017 Mr. Horn. Our next panelist is Mr. Samuel K. Skinner, who served President George Bush both as the President's Chief of Staff and the Secretary of Transportation. As a Senior Aide to the President, Mr. Skinner coordinated the President's activities and managed the White House staff. During his service in the President's Cabinet, Mr. Skinner was responsible for overseeing the Department of Transportation's $30 billion budget and 105,000 employees. He's been credited with numerous successes in transportation policy, including the development of the President's national transportation policy and passage of the landmark aviation and surface transportation legislation. Mr. Skinner also developed the administration's open skies policy, which liberalized the Nation's international aviation policy and significantly increased the number of international flights to and from the United States. We welcome you, Mr. Skinner; and we look forward to your testimony. Mr. Skinner. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, Congressman Turner. I'm delighted to be here as one of the latest to serve as Chief of Staff to the President. I also think I can bring a little different perspective to this discussion because, while I agree with what everybody has said, I have had the opportunity to be in and out of government on several occasions. In 1968, as a salesman at IBM making $50,000 a year I left to join public service for $7,500 a year with a wife and three children. Some would say that was foolish, but it was clearly one of the best things I ever did in my life. I think any comparison of corporate salaries or private sector income to the salary of the President of the United States is basically irrelevant. You don't do it for the money. The benefits and the rewards that you get go well beyond that. While there is great disparities, I think there will continue to be disparities. I do, however, think that the standard that we have to set deals with basically two factors. No. 1, we should not have a salary that is so low that people who are serving in government who have not had the opportunity to go in and out of government will not be able to serve as President or offer themselves as a candidate for President because they have no money and it is impossible to meet the requirements absent compromising one's integrity or going without. I have a 3 year old and a 5 year old. I can afford to educate those children because my wife and I both work. Most people in government today, many of them in this room and others come from a family where both couples work. It's very hard for the spouse of a President to work. So if you take those two incomes together, we may actually require a family to take a cut from current salaries and compensation to serve as President if they don't have independent income. A President needs to educate his children or her children. To put money away for education today is no small challenge unless you have independent wealth. In Illinois as I left today, the schools in Illinois--and President Horn would be familiar with this--they all announced they were raising their tuition in the State by about 5 percent, and one raised the tuition 15 percent. Tuition is increasing at a rate greater than the rate of inflation, and our President should have the right and the ability to at least send his children to college with some assistance as well. And, finally, we should avoid the appearance of impropriety. And the idea that a President should have to accept gratuities or put himself or herself in a situation where they have to take dresses or gifts or suits or ties or free tuition or anything like that to make ends meet is not what we want the President to find themselves in that situation. He must meet--he or she must meet basic individual needs, personal living expenses, and they're greater than normal Americans. And, No. 2, he should be able or she should be able to conduct themselves in their office without worrying every moment about how they're going to meet basic financial needs. And, finally, obviously when you raise the President's salary every 30 years, unless we're going to change the mechanism as Governor Sununu suggested, which I think is worthy of serious consideration, you have got to bump it up at a level sufficient enough so what we don't find ourselves in the same situation without any kind of remedy 5 years from now. What that amount is, is somewhat controversial. I have been conducting my own independent poll the last several days. And while I don't live my life by polls, I asked--I read my remarks to my wife, and I suggested $500,000 to my wife, and she reminded me that that was a substantial amount of money, that a lot of other people weren't making that money and that, you know, that it might not be acceptable, politically, or practical. I then had the opportunity to fly last week--this weekend with a distinguished public servant who will remain anonymous because he may run for elected office or reelection again, but he suggested the number of $500,000. And then, of course, I flew out this morning and conducted the final leg of the poll, which was a management consultant who serves both in government and private sector; and, ironically, he came up with the number of $500,000 which Governor Sununu had mentioned in his earlier remarks. The point is, it is a very politically sensitive number. But if you're going to do it, let's do it in a way that accomplishes what we want to accomplish; and that is allow the President to serve and others to run for the Presidency and meet their basic minimal expenses of a personal nature as well as their family educational expenses. Lift it high enough so that we can really avoid the wage compression that exists for other government officials who are similarly situated. And, No. 3, put it at a level that will be acceptable to the American people. I believe they understand the need for a significant change. And I applaud this committee for the political strength it takes to even have this hearing, let alone take a position on what can be a very controversial issue; and I welcome your questions. Mr. Horn. Thank you very much for those thoughtful comments. [The prepared statement of Mr. Skinner follows:] [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T2932.018 [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T2932.019 [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T2932.020 [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T2932.021 Mr. Horn. Our last panelist is Thomas F. McLarty III. He is well known on Capitol Hill and highly respected by members in both parties in his initial job in the Clinton administration as Chief of Staff and then Counselor to the President and then Special Envoy for the Americas. After joining the White House as President Clinton's Chief of Staff, Mr. McLarty helped enact the 1993 deficit reduction package, the North Atlantic Fair Trade Agreement [NAFTA], Free Trade Agreement, and the family and medical leave law, which didn't quite get eliminated, I mean, or passed. In 1994, Mr. McLarty organized the Summit of the Americas in Miami. He played a critical role in structuring the 1995 Mexican peso stabilization program; and in his role as Special Envoy for the Americas Mr. McLarty made more than 50 trips to the region, planned U.S. participation in the 1998 Summit of the Americas in Santiago. In addition, he's participated in several G-7 summits and traveled to the Persian Gulf on the President's behalf to build financial support for the Bosnian peace process. Before his White House tenure, Mr. McLarty served in the Arkansas State Legislature at the age of 23, which is probably the all-time record, and as chairman of the Arkansas State Democratic party and also the chairman of one of the major utilities in Arkansas. Mr. Horn. We welcome you, Mr. McLarty, and look forward to your testimony. Mr. McLarty. Mr. Chairman, thank you very much, Congressman Turner. It is certainly a privilege for me to appear before you today for this very timely, very important hearing; and I certainly appreciate the opportunity to do so, particularly with my distinguished colleagues from previous administrations. It is an honor to serve one's country; and we do not and should not expect, any of us, to profit or become rich from government service. But sometimes I wonder if we're having the opposite effect. Secretary Bob Rubin used to joke that the only way to leave Washington with a small fortune is to arrive with a large one. And while I'm not worried about Mr. Rubin's personal finances, his humor I think has a ring of truth to it. Mr. Chairman, as you noted, I am a product of the private sector, both from a third generation family business endeavor which we are still active in and having the privilege to serve as chairman and chief executive of a publicly traded Fortune 500 natural gas company before I came to Washington. I am truly grateful for the opportunity to serve the people of our country. But I think it's fair to say the opportunity costs are high and they are increasing, and I am worried that we are attracting fewer citizens who have proven successful careers in private life to serve our country. This committee has documented a number of concerns about the effect of a fixed Presidential salary. Lloyd Cutler, who served with distinction both in the Clinton administration and the Carter administration, led a commission 10 years ago that recommended the President's salary be raised to $350,000. Congressman Jim Kolbe's committee I believe has suggested an increase by the year 2001 to $400,000, a figure that we have discussed today. While I was privileged to serve President Bush on two Presidential commissions and, of course, served President Clinton in the White House, my primary concern is not about the personal income of them or any future President, although I think that's important. My colleagues have pointed out the reasons very eloquently and thoughtfully. But I am particularly concerned with the fixed Presidential salary compressing the wages for others who serve in the public sector; and that goes from the civil service to the military, General Haig, and certainly to political appointees. I think all of us would agree very strongly that the best government is one that attracts talented people from all walks of life. You certainly should not have to be independently wealthy to serve in government. But we have raised the cost of serving in government rather dramatically. Detailed filings that we all have to make for appointed positions can literally cost thousands upon thousands of dollars. You have to sever existing business relations, which others have spoken of; and I think that's proper. But I think these are very real costs, including the cost of relocation that should be included when we evaluate government service. In short, whether it be career civil servants, our men and women in uniform or the people who serve in appointed offices, all of these people are real American families with mortgages and tuitions and all of the other challenges of modern life; and the bottom line is that private sector salaries are increasing and government salaries are not; and we should really not put people in the position of making a difficult choice between their family and their country. Now, Congressman Turner has already suggested that it was big news when Babe Ruth earned more than the President, and I'm not suggesting that we should pay Presidents as much as major league athletes or even CEOs. That is not the real reason one seeks public service. But I do think that, as has been pointed out, that the President's salary should reflect the importance the American people place on this job. As you have noted, Mr. Chairman, the President's salary has been fixed since the Johnson administration. There are a number of calculations we can make, including the George Washington calculation. But if we adjust it for the gross domestic product from 1969, we would have a salary of about $1.7 million. If we did that on a per capita basis, it would be about $1.3 million. A more modest suggestion is the President's salary should increase along with average hourly wages. Other measures might reflect inflation of the size of the economy, but no measure perhaps reflects the importance of the connection of the President to American families. Since 1969, the last time the President's salary was changed, average hourly wages have increased 425 percent; and that would equate to about $850,000. Now, again, I'm not wedded to any one number. I fully support the $400,000 figure that has been talked about in the appropriation bill, and perhaps a larger number is justified, and I think it is an appropriate one for the challenge and responsibility and the demands that we make on public people that serve in public life today. Mr. Chairman, common sense I think tells us that Presidential salaries should not be fixed for 30 years. Fairness suggests that we end the pay compression for other public servants, and the economic reality is that government competes with the private sector for talent and experience, and we should recognize that. I commend you and this committee for holding this hearing on a very important matter, and I hope Congress will move forward to address this issue in a timely fashion. Thank you. Mr. Horn. Well, thank you for your very helpful remarks. [The prepared statement of Mr. McLarty follows:] [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T2932.022 [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T2932.023 Mr. Horn. Let me just go down and have you all hear each colleague. I will like to start with Ambassador Jones and say did anybody convince you here that you ought to move from $400,000 to $500,000? That's one part of the question. The other is Governor Sununu's point of we should have a system that reviews this on an automatic basis of either every two terms or 10 years or 15 years, whatever. In the case of the Comptroller General of the United States, for example, he gets one salary, and that salary follows him into retirement--he has a 15-year term, et cetera, and we haven't gotten into the retirement yet, but we will. Let's start with you, Ambassador. Mr. Jones. Well, on both of those points, I will opt for a higher level of salary increase to at least $500,000; but recognizing as the others have, the political difficulty, $400,000 would be the minimum. As far as an annual review, I think Governor Sununu makes a very good recommendation and at least as we review the census every 10 years, we ought to review Presidential salaries, and the impact of that salary on the rest of government, at least every 10 years, if not earlier. Mr. Horn. General, what's your feeling? General Haig. I recommend the third year of every term of every President you should take a look at this subject. I would hope that the committee would look at the $500,000 level. But, again, there has to be an assessment of the possible and what can be most efficiently done in a bipartisan way. Mr. Horn. Mr. Hartmann. Mr. Hartmann. I can't think of anything more. Mr. Horn. OK. Do you agree with the $500,000? Mr. Hartmann. I agree with it. Mr. Horn. And the review that Governor Sununu is talking about? Mr. Hartmann. Yes. Mr. Horn. OK. Mr. Duberstein. Mr. Duberstein. I would support $500,000, but my vote isn't the one that is important; I think you have to look both to the American people and your colleagues in the Congress of whether doubling to $400,000 is more politically feasible than $500,000. On the second issue on John's suggested review, the quadrennial commission is not charged with responsibility for a President's salary; but certainly looking forward every 4 years, I think, makes the ultimate sense as Al Haig said in the third year of a President, looking forward to the next Presidential term. So I would strongly support a regular review of Presidential salary. Mr. Horn. Governor. Mr. Sununu. I came in to propose $500,000. I yielded to the $400,000 that you have, but if you twist my arm, I will go back to the $500,000. I don't have any argument with utilizing an existing mechanism like the quadrennial commission or whatever--I picked 8 years or 12 years as a period--because thinking in terms of either two or three Presidential terms. But whatever the period is, I think we can go a long way to regularizing the process and that's the key to it. Mr. Horn. OK. Mr. Skinner, you started all of this with that vast universe of polling that you told us about. Mr. Skinner. No, you know where I stand. I would say that if you're going to set a mechanism in place, which I agree should be set, we ought to do it right. The idea of putting this on some bill that, you know, is a trailer of some sort, rather than, you know, really giving some thought to the mechanism so that it will go through a regular review, I think is most appropriate so we don't find ourselves in the situation that where every 30 years and it's subject to all of these others. We've done that with Federal pay a number of years ago. It works. There has been a pay compression problem because of some other issues. But clearly--and I think that mechanism ought to be in place and it ought to be adhered to. I would also add I have a number of friends that sit on the Federal judiciary, served with me in the U.S. Attorney's Office and other places, and this compression problem has also created a very major problem there where we're just not--we're attracting candidates, but we're not attracting really qualified candidates because of that. And the compression would help there, too, but what has happened is sometimes we don't go through it. We set the mechanism in place and for one reason or another, because it's tied to congressional salaries, we don't go through it, and I don't think anything we set should be tied to congressional salaries. That's an issue that Congress has got to work through themselves. But all of these other people should not be tied to those salaries, because I think that creates the same compression problem you have otherwise. Mr. Horn. Any change in your position, Mr. McLarty? Mr. McLarty. No, there's not. I think I can certainly support $500,000. It's got to be tempered, obviously, with political judgment. I think you can make a case for greater than that. I strongly support some type of review that is thoughtful and appropriate. I think that would be a great deal of help in this situation. Mr. Horn. I now yield to the ranking member on the committee, Mr. Turner of Texas, for questioning. Mr. Turner. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. McLarty, I think you were the last to mention the problem of compression of Federal salaries. It's interesting to know that the Congress legislated a freeze on congressional salaries which also applied to the top Federal office, the top Federal positions as well, not only in 1994, 1995, 1996, 1997. There was a pay increase in 1998 and in 1999. And, in fact, if Congress had not legislated that freeze and had allowed the automatic adjustment, the cost-of-living adjustment to take place, if my math is correct, the Vice President would be making the same as the President is today. So it is a problem that we should address. Obviously, the Congress has been part of the problem in trying to deal with it, and I certainly think it reflects the political charge of nature of the issue to note that for all of those years that I mentioned the Congress denied itself and the other top level Federal officials a pay raise. And I guess the question I would want to ask each of you is what's the best way to explain this problem to the American people? We're going to hear on one of our next panels testimony that shares some results from a Pew Research Center poll which basically says that the people of this country understand the President's entitled to a pay raise, but the majority of them think it's somewhere in the range of $10,000 to $20,000. And in fact, there appear to be virtually no support for a doubling of the President's salary. So to help us through this issue, which obviously is fraught with political minefields, would any of you like to offer up a suggestion as to how to best make the case for this kind of change? Ambassador, would you like to start helping me on that one? Mr. Jones. It was very difficult. There's never a good time for a congressional pay raise. There's never a good time for a government pay raise in general, politically speaking. And it's very difficult to convince the American people that one is deserved. Part of that, I think, Congress brings on itself by raving and ranting against a pay raise and not giving the kind of respect that this institution of Congress deserves. I think that carries over to the American people and the respect they have for the institution. It was attempted a few years ago back to make an independent method of assessing what congressional salaries and other salaries should be, so that they could occur automatically. The problem is the appropriations process denies that. It seems to me some sort of independent mechanism that would give an independent review and an assessment of Federal salaries is a better approach, something that would equate to the independence of our Federal judiciary. But it's going to have to be something that's proactive. It's going to have to be something that you can constitutionally mandate the appropriations process to fulfill. Whether it's in some form of a trust fund, I'm not sure, but I think that you're never going to get around the political obstacles as long as Congress goes through the regular annual debate on a pay raise. So some sort of independent mechanism is the way that I think you can go about doing it. Mr. Turner. Mr. Haig, do you have a suggestion for us? General Haig. I just suggest to you that we've had every member of this panel recommend $500,000 or $400,000. I don't think it's the job of the Congress any more than it is the job of the President to be dictated to by polls. I think the American people are ready to take this, if it's given to them, with the factual data that was presented here at this hearing. And if it's done and the Congress moves courageously. I think it will get through. Mr. Turner. Thank you. Mr. Hartmann, do you have a suggestion? Mr. Hartmann. I have nothing to add. Mr. Turner. Mr. Duberstein. Mr. Duberstein. I want to echo what General Haig said. I think this is not a business of polling; this is a question of equity. I think the American people will, in fact, support a significant pay raise for the President of the United States. I don't think the selling job has been done, as far as there being no pay raise since 1969. That's why I used the examples that I used. I think people will understand $10,000 or $20,000, but only in the sense of a year or two. If you talk about 30 years, I think people will understand the fundamental change in the Office of the Presidency with C-SPAN, with cable television, with the 24-hour news site, et cetera. And I think it is not a losing issue. Mr. Turner. Governor. Mr. Sununu. Mr. Turner, I think it is an issue that the public can be educated on. But going back to your poll, I suggest, like all polls, there is a problem in the question not in the answer. And the question was probably the President of the United States makes $200,000. What do you think a good pay raise for the President would be? $20,000 is an absolutely appropriate answer to that question. But if the question was not even how much should we pay this President of the United States, but how much should we pay the next President of the United States, what is a fair salary for the next President of the United States? I suggest to you the poll would probably come in with numbers around $1 million. And so with all due respect, there are polls and there are polls and there are polls. $500,000 I think is a good compromise. I think that's an educable number, and I commend the committee for having the hearings. And I think you will have no trouble selling that point. Mr. Turner. Thank you. Mr. Skinner. Mr. Skinner. Well, every once in a while in government you've got to follow the slogan I think Nike has, ``Just Do It.'' And I think this is one of those issues that, if we sit around waiting for all of the input and everybody else and full education, you will miss this opportunity. I mean, this is really the first realistic time in 30 years that Congress has addressed this. And I think you've got the ball moving. You've got, certainly, a record; and I think if Governor Sununu's point--if you also said the President of the United States, the Office of President of the United States salary has not been raised for 30 years, how much do you think the next President should make if we're not going to raise it for another 30 years? I think you might get a far different answer than $20,000. Mr. Turner. Thank you. Mr. McLarty. Mr. McLarty. I would agree with the comments that have been made. I think it should be approached in a very direct, straightforward manner. I don't think most people realize the President's pay has not been raised for over 30 years, and I think that's the first point. And I think common sense and equity will be a strong point to make. It certainly should be done in a bipartisan manner. I think that will go a long way in terms of how people react to the proposal. Mr. Turner. Mr. McLarty, I know that most Americans and to all of us $200,000 is a lot of money. Most people don't make that kind of money. But one of the issues I raised in my opening remarks was my belief that the President's salary should be sufficient so that he would not be susceptible to corruption. And you've been there most recently of this panel. It seems our current President has had a lot of expenses come his way for various reasons. He's had to raise money privately to cover legal costs. Could you describe for us just from your own personal experience the kind of pressure that exists in the White House today with regard to finances for a President and the First Lady or First Spouse? Mr. McLarty. I don't think some of the pressures are singular, Mr. Turner, for this administration. I think it's probably been building over the last several terms of the Presidency. I think, clearly, disclosure is one of the areas that I noted, and I think certainly from an overview or a legal side that the expenses have grown over the years. But I think we have seen that growing over the years. It's a very real number, but I think it's a very large number. But I think it also, of course, reflects not just the President but those that serve in government as well. And that was part of the point I was trying to make. I don't think this particular measure should have as its focus the legal bills or anything of that aspect. I think that the cost of public service, of serving in public service, should be the focus of that. There's no question that the point you raise is a valid one. It is expensive, not only in terms of real costs, in many cases moving to Washington. It is certainly expensive in terms of opportunity costs. And I think the last thing we want, whether it be at the Presidential level or anywhere in the government, is to have any kind of setting for less than fully appropriate conduct. And I think in the President's case--you have also seen with President Carter--there is great ability to do great public works after tenure as President. So I think that should go into play as well. And there is other Presidents as well, not just singling out President Carter. But there is no question there are stresses. I think Mr. Duberstein and others have pointed out many of the reasons for that, and they in all likelihood will continue to grow, whether we have a Democrat or a Republican in the White House. Mr. Turner. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Horn. I now yield time to the gentleman from Pennsylvania, Mr. Kanjorski, for the questioning of witnesses. Mr. Kanjorski. Thank you very much. Does anyone on the panel know what the President's salary would be today if we took all the inflation over the last 30 years into consideration? Have they done the math on any of that? Mr. Horn. We will have in the next panel. Mr. Skinner. In the last 30 years, sir? Mr. Kanjorski. I am just wondering when we think of the 1970's when we had double-digit inflation, where we would be today if every year we increased the President. Mr. Sununu. A little under a million. Mr. Kanjorski. A little under a million. Do any of the presidents of our major universities, would it be reasonable to say that they are certainly in the $400,000 or $500,000 range? Mr. Sununu. And some higher, I believe. Mr. Kanjorski. I know one of our universities in Pennsylvania is so high the legislature is not allowed to know it. Mr. Skinner. Good pay for a coach is a million a year. It all packages a year. Some coaches in major institutions have a total compensation package of $1 million or $1.2 million. Mr. Kanjorski. It seems that those who criticize this the most appear on the media on a regular basis. It seems to me that we in Congress should think about making sure that if they appear on a licensed television or radio station, the commentators' salaries should be disclosed. When you have a newscaster being paid $7, $10, $12 million a year, it seems hypocritical for him to start the ball rolling against these unusual high political salaries. Most people are completely unaware of the fact that these media celebrities are paid these extraordinary amounts of money. I do not know who made the observation--I think my good friend Mr. Jones how we tend to beat ourselves to death up here. It will be a pleasure to know sometimes we get down there and it is only one or two Members of Congress. Invariably, someone is running for Senate or somebody is running for Governor and they see a political opportunity and get out there and criticize public salaries, whether they be judges or Congress or the President. WHile it will happen again, I tend to agree with the panel, Mr. Chairman. We just have to bite this bullet, and we should not play around with the fact. Quite frankly, I think we ought to pay the President of the United States $1 million a year. If anyone is not worth $1 million a year to lead this country, he or she probably should not be President of the United States. As we all know, it is a 25-year commitment to rise to the level to aspire to that office. It is not just a convention meeting. As we all know--those conventions do not meet that way. It is a long protracted loss of income in private life that people would have. On the judiciary level, I have been a little annoyed with the idea of my friends in the legal profession who entertain seven-figure salaries on a regular basis, and they are very difficult to persuade to sit on the bench, whether it be a district court or an appeals court or a supreme court for that matter. It seems now almost the only people that will decide to sit on a supreme court already have amassed sufficient money, that they are relevantly independent, several millions of dollars in net assets. That's unfortunate because some people will not have that opportunity and therefore have to make terrible choices. Talking of this President and being familiar with tuitions, I am sure Stanford University is not cheap. To my knowledge, elected officials do not get the opportunity to have any scholarships, et cetera, so they pay the full tuition. That amounts to probably $160,000 after-tax income, just to educate one child. If a President has three or four children, as I think the next President may have, not to state who that may be, that could be a very difficult expenditure. I am also interested in the President's staff. Assume we pay $1 million a year to the President or half a million dollars to the President. How are we going to attract people of your caliber to leave private life in seven-figure incomes and come into administrations and serve for 4, 8 years and then sometimes have to spend $1 million to defend yourselves with the litigation now that is almost endemic to the system? There is one other thing I would like the panel to answer. Have you given any thought about giving an exemption or a moratorium to a civil lawsuit to the President of the United States while he serves in office so these extraordinary expenses are not required to be incurred when, quite frankly, I would say anybody that stands in a rope line to get to shake the hand of the President could sue the President for assault and battery if they were willing to go through that process. It would necessitate hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of dollars in legal expenses to go through the legal process at this point. Address just what type of insulation we should give to the Office of the President and these inordinate expenses that are a new political phenomena in our society? Let's start with Al and move down the panel. Mr. Jones. With regard to your last recommendation, yes, I think Congress should give some consideration to an appropriate constitutionally proper exemption, I mean, deferment of civil suits against a President. Obviously, Congress will have to do it if it's going to be done, because the Supreme Court has ruled on this question. And so I think that's something that Congress should consider. With regard to attracting people to other levels at the White House, et cetera, I think the salary is important, and it should go up somewhat. But I think you're going to have to change the attitudes about public service and the people who come to public service and their motivations. My experience is that people are truly properly motivated to serve the public when they leave private sector and come into government service. But when you fill out the forms and when you answer all of the questions, the assumption is that somehow you're going to try to cheat, lie, and steal; and in order to prevent you from doing that, you answer a number of questions that leaves you open to tremendous legal liability if politically motivated suits are desired. And then second, you are required in many instances to divest of whatever you have accumulated for yourself and your family, as opposed to a total blind trust or something else. So I think the presumption that many people who would come into public service and would be asked by a President is that somehow they think I'm a crook and just going to try to cheat. I think that presumption needs to be changed, because my experience is just the opposite is true. Mr. Kanjorski. General. General Haig. I would like to add also the observation I think I'm the only one at this table who actually ran for President, or at least tried to run. It probably cost me $2 million of my own personal funds to do that, despite the money that was raised in the campaign. I got into the legal disputes with the Federal Election Commission. If you really wish to look at something which makes lawyers rich for little, that Commission is a very, very good thing to look at. But having said that, I know there are candidates running this year who are willing to give $20, $25 million of their own personal money for the opportunity, the honor, and the challenge of leading this land. I don't think the money side of it is nearly as important as ensuring that the incumbent can live in dignity, educate his children, et cetera. As you quite rightly pointed out, we most recognize that these are very dynamic amounts that must be assessed regularly so that we assure that the incumbent is paid in a way that he can enter that office and not draw down on the assets he brought with him. That gets right back to what you said, Mr. Turner, that, by God, it's not a rich man's club. It's got to be an office open to every individual in this land. So I just don't want to get too astronomical because I'm afraid if $1 million went up there you would get the regurgitation that we're talking about, although it is justified. Mr. Hartmann. Well, I would make the observation that government---- Mr. Horn. Do you want to get the microphone a little closer? Thank you. Mr. Hartmann. I would make the observation that it seems to me that right now we're in a period of our history in which government service is at a rather low ebb in public opinion. I won't say that government service is necessarily to blame for that, but I do think that when you start waving around half a million dollars or $1 million in the face of ordinary people, they aren't going to like it. I mean we've made very persuasive arguments here for why it is necessary in the case of government people and particularly at the top level of government people. But I don't think the public is going to buy it, not in its present mood. If you want to get an Eisenhower in here to propose it, you might succeed. I don't think you're going to succeed right now. Mr. Horn. Mr. Duberstein. Mr. Duberstein. Congressman Kanjorski, I don't think salary is the issue. Government service shouldn't be a punishment; government service should be the highest calling. The idea of attracting people who have to run the maze of a confirmation process in the other body deters so many now. I'm not talking about the elected officials; I'm talking about those of us who have been appointed to either confirmable jobs or nonconfirmable ones. The price you pay, your family pays, is astronomical; but it's worth it if you can make a difference. If the salary had been $10,000 higher when President Reagan asked me to be his chief of staff, it wouldn't have made any difference. It's the opportunity to make a difference to serve. That's what it has to be all about. Mr. Sununu. I think Ken makes a very important point. When I had to go out and solicit potential Members of the Cabinet for President Bush, the issue was never salary. The issue was abuse in the public domain; and, therefore, that is the biggest deterrent to participation in government by good people. I don't mean to suggest that salary is not any factor at all. I remember my news conference in May 1988 when I announced I wasn't going to run for a fourth term and the press asked me how come, and my answer was when you send $20,000 a year to MIT and $20,000 a year to Stanford and $20,000 a year to the IRS, it doesn't leave much from a $60,000-a-year salary. So there are times in which the salary issue is an important one, but in terms of what we're addressing at the Cabinet level for the President, I don't think it is the issue. Mr. Kanjorski. Mr. Skinner. Mr. Skinner. Well, I have done it twice. The first time I took a 60, 80 percent pay cut, and the last time about the same. But every time I did it, I knew I wasn't going to do it for life. I knew I wasn't going to be excluded from having an opportunity to go back to the private sector to make up for the costs, as well as maybe to even, frankly, enhance one's position. And so I think in recruiting people at the very top for a relatively short period of time, it's not a problem. I do, however, agree with your comments with the judiciary; and as the only, I guess, practicing lawyer, at least at the table here today now, I know; and having been a U.S. attorney and been recruited for that job, it wasn't. But I, again, knew I was going to go back to the private sector. When we recruit judges, we recruit for life or good behavior; and only three, I think, have been removed in the last 30 years. We are recruiting good judges who are good lawyers. I think it is very difficult, except for the Supreme Court, to recruit great lawyers with great experience for the judiciary. And I think it is very difficult to keep great judges on the judiciary for an extended period of time because of the opportunity that exists or the impossibility to educate, because we're recruiting them at a time when they have all of these expenses building up. And as we recruit younger candidates to run for the Presidency, they have educational expenses that some of the others don't. So I think as all of this plays a role, we've got to give them the ability at least to minimally meet the expenses that Governor Sununu and others talked about. Mr. McLarty. I believe we have two or three issues related here: one is the Presidential pay, which I think really just goes to the appropriateness and dignity of the office which we've all spoken to. I think, second, it is clearly more difficult to recruit people of standing, of accomplishment, from the private sector, whether they be from industry or academia or wherever to serve than it was 5, 10 years ago. I think that probably regrettably will continue. Perhaps there's some way we could at least evaluate some of the findings required, but I think all of us are for transparency and openness and none of us would--we would want to be very careful of how we did that. I do think the salary level makes a difference, however, in some of the civil servants and some of the younger people in government, not so much recruited at a Cabinet level, but in a working level. I think that does make a difference, and I've seen that time and time again where very capable, bright young people come into government and just really determine they cannot stay because of the financial requirements or burdens of the responsibility. And I think in that case the Presidential salary does drive that equation to some extent. Mr. Horn. I thank the gentleman. Let me followup on some of this. The compression problem without question does have a real effect on the ability and capacity of an administration to staff the executive branch, particularly, with the political appointees. And I certainly remember that under President Eisenhower when the Secretary of Labor asked me, as his Assistant, to go out and check them out for solicitor. There was a year and a half to go into the administration, and you face a real problem trying to recruit in the last year and a half of any administration, and you also face the salary problem. I think the way your heads nod, you all agree that this is a problem we have to deal with here, if we're going to get people for the last half of the administration. I think the figures used to be that Cabinet officers sort of stick it out for 4 years; Under Secretaries maybe you've got 3 years; Assistant Secretaries are maybe 2, 2\\1/2\\ years. I think all of you have faced that problem, if you have been in your role as chief of staff. Do you have any further advice to us? I've got one more question then. OK, one more question, retirement, and how we deal with it. President Truman once said, and I think he's right on the mark, when he's out of the Presidency, a lot of boards wanted him to serve, and so forth. He said they don't want me, they want the Presidency. I think he's absolutely right. Now the question is, if we pay the President adequately, if we tie his retirement or her retirement to it, should we say, OK, you've got that retirement, you've been President of the United States, the highest honor any citizen of the United States can give. Can we say you aren't going to serve on private boards? What do you think? I know you've been on that, General. We're not picking on generals; we're just saying Presidents. General Haig. Well, I think you ought to be very careful about that, because every President is of a different mold. Some are older and have been through their careers and hopefully we will not forget that wisdom sometimes pays off. Some are younger and more visionary and have a whole life ahead of them when they leave the Presidency. I would be very careful. I think we should look at the retirement pay of the President on the same cycle that we look at his salary on active duty: there should be a relationship. But most Presidents are pretty well taken care of. If I'm looking at the figures that the committee gave us in preparation for this, in retirement. And I think maybe a very modest increase is all that's in order. I think it's about $150,000-some and then it gets aumented with allowances and benefits, up to a rather substantial number with recent Presidents. But it requires more. You know, even an ex-public servant is--every day I have five or six letters a day that I have to answer and send out and I have to have a staff to handle for me. If I were an ex-President, I would be getting thousands of letters a week. This is a huge burden. And we've got to handle it, but I don't think I would want to put any ground rules other than to link active and retirement pay in a responsible way. Mr. Horn. Any other comments on this? Mr. Sununu. Mr. Horn, I would not attempt to limit what a President does, either in public service or private service afterwards. I just think the act of doing that suggests to the public a conventionality that is not there. And I just would recommend that that probably carries more of a public service burden than benefit in the long run. Mr. Horn. Mr. Skinner. Mr. Skinner. Well, I think that the retirement should take into consideration his service and length of service to our government in many cases, and it should be an appropriate level. I don't think we should penalize him by giving his retirement less than what that person would have gotten had they saved the full time. Most Presidents don't serve on any significant public boards. I think they've got plenty of opportunities, as we know in today's world, to take care of some of the financial responsibilities they have late in life and still have a comfortable life; and many, like President Carter and others, have decided to devote their time in a very, very meaningful way in the public sector. And they should have that opportunity. And I think a fair retirement program consistent with government retirement programs is appropriate. Mr. Horn. Well, in the 19th century we had the problem with many Presidential spouses had hardly any means to exist and continue once their husband died. I mean should we look at that also? Mr. Skinner. I think we still have that problem with the Federal judiciary. We allow someone to retire from the Federal judiciary, and they keep their compensation for life and can serve as a senior status in a less active role and continue to maintain their salary and all that goes with it. But as I recall, the pension for widows is basically nonexistent. And that is just an additional price of public service that's unwarranted, in my opinion. We should treat people, you know, consistently as they serve in government, and I think in doing that, we ought to have a consistent, fair retirement program for all public servants. Obviously, it won't be at the level that some of these huge, you know, programs that exist from the private sector-- I'm the beneficiary of one of those, so I appreciate that--but it ought to be at a level that recognizes their contribution and allows them to serve out the rest of their life and their family and the rest of their life with some dignity. Mr. Horn. Mr. Duberstein. Mr. Duberstein. Mr. Chairman, I think that on retirement, on retirement benefits, it should be looked at periodically as the President's salary is reviewed as well. As far as postemployment limitations, I would strongly advise you not to do that and place anything, any curtailment, on a former President of the United States. Mr. Horn. Any other thoughts? Mr. Kanjorski. Mr. Chairman, while we have this distinguished panel, may I ask something totally unrelated to the hearing? Mr. Horn. OK. You will have one last question. Mr. Kanjorski. All of you have dealt with the Office of the President and the Congress and the various committees and their jurisdictions. Do you think this would be an appropriate time for the Congress to form a commission to reorganize the executive and legislative branches of government and take the advantage of three living Presidents, and have that commission return sometime in the next term so that functionally we can line up the Congress with the executive branch of government? Have you found that frustrating in your experiences as chief of staff that your officials have to be testifying before seven or eight different committees and the games we play up here to draft legislation to get the specific committees and avoid others, the pit stops? Do you think this would be an appropriate time for us to put a Hoover Commission together, both for the executive branch and for the legislative branch, do it together, get the advantage of your experiences now and the living Presidents while they are here? Mr. Jones. I chaired a committee for the National Academy of Public Administration several years back on this very subject and made some recommendations in that respect. And I think those recommendations are still sound. I'm not sure that a full Presidential--or a commission needs to be organized to study this. I think this is something your relevant committees and the Congress should deal with on a regular basis, seek the administration's opinion. But you put your finger on two of the most frustrating or the most frustrating problem, is the proliferation of jurisdiction that overlaps and forces one Cabinet officer to spend most of his or her time on the Hill testifying basically the same testimony. But I think that's something that Congress ought to look at itself. General Haig. I would comment just briefly, we hear a lot about the power of the Presidency; and having served as many as I have, I left that experience with my main concern focused on the limitations on the power of the Presidency, which today have gotten out of hand, whether it stems from the courts or, more importantly, the legislature. So I would love to see the legislature examine itself and let the executive branch examine itself rather than to get into a partisan branch brouhaha that is also bureaucratic in character; but your question is very well taken and long overdue. Mr. Horn. Mr. Duberstein, any comment? Then, Governor. Mr. Duberstein. No, I agree with Al. I think doing it separately, the legislative branch and executive branch is the way to do it rather than forming one Presidential commission. I agree. I think it is long overdue. I think it should be looked at, and what better committee of the Congress to do it than this committee. Mr. Horn. I'm tempted to say that you're suggesting we rewrite the Constitution as in 1787. But go ahead, Governor. Mr. Sununu. I support the idea of separate branch review. I think with all due respect to the question asked by Mr. Kanjorski that I suspect any Congress will be clever enough that no matter what structure you come up with that in about two congressional cycles they will figure out how to reparcel it out to the committees and create the same problem all over again. But in terms of improving efficiency and bringing government into a modern structure, I think there is a great need for it. Mr. Horn. Mr. Skinner. Mr. Skinner. Well, having served as a statutory Cabinet officer of a pretty big department with a lot of different jurisdictions, I did not find that an insurmountable program. I was able to work with most of the committees. I did take probably a little more time than necessary. You do become concerned, although I think General Haig said, is are we really in balance and have we by the creation of multiple commissions--I mean, multicommittees with multiple jurisdictions, have we kind of thrown the balance of powers, which I thought was three equal branches of government, a little off kilter. And if a joint effort would solve that problem, rather than an independent effort, I would be all for it, because I think it is a good idea to visit on occasion whether or not we've got that constitutionally provided balance of power really and balance--and sometimes it gets out of kilter. Mr. Horn. Any comments, Mr. McLarty? Mr. McLarty. Well, I think we were asked to address a very serious and heavy list of a subject in the one we've discussed. This is an equally, I think, serious one. I believe there's a more efficient, effective way to do it, the vehicle, whether it's legislative or joint. I think I would leave this an open question. But I do think that there's got to be a bit more effective way than we're currently doing it, stopping short of rewriting the Constitution, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Horn. Well, thank you gentlemen. We really appreciate you coming here. We might have some followup questions if you wouldn't mind, but thank you. Your perspective and experience is a real help to us. And that's why we have the committee system in the Congress of the United States, be it weird sometimes. OK, thank you very much. Panel two will come forward. You might know the routine, and first we will give you the oath. So please stand and raise your right hands. [Witnesses affirmed.] Mr. Horn. The clerk will note all four affirmed. And we will begin with Sharon Gressle, the specialist in American National Government of the Congressional Research Service, which is part of our great Library of Congress, and they are part of the legislative branch of the government. And we're glad to have you here. STATEMENTS SHARON GRESSLE, SPECIALIST, AMERICAN NATIONAL GOVERNMENT, CONGRESSIONAL RESEARCH SERVICES; GARY RUSKIN, EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR, CONGRESSIONAL ACCOUNTABILITY PROJECT; PAUL LIGHT, DIRECTOR, CENTER FOR PUBLIC SERVICE, THE BROOKINGS INSTITUTION; AND DONALD SIMON, ACTING PRESIDENT, COMMON CAUSE Ms. Gressle. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, Members of the committee. I would like to just place a short historical context for our discussions today. I will not make a lengthy statement. In the previous changes of salary for the Presidency, we had--of course, the first for President Washington, that was in legislation for the President and the Vice President, that was the only time in which the salary was not set immediately prior to the change of administration. The 1873 and 1909 changes were both part of general government appropriations, as is this proposal now for treasury appropriations to change it to $400,000. In 1949, it was legislation that focused pretty much on top officials' salaries, but it was taken in the context of a larger discussion following the Hoover Commission on the whole scheme of Federal salaries. In fact, our general schedule which we have today was created pursuant to those discussions in a separate piece of legislature. And, of course, in 1969--that was a stand-alone piece of legislation--it only changed the compensation of the Presidency. And as you know, we are now at a situation where the next possible change in that compensation is January 2001. No one has mentioned the expense allowance that is available to the President on an annual basis yet today, that is, a sum of $50,000. It was set in 1949 at that sum. And at this point in time, it is changed as to whether or not it was funds directly to the President and whether or not it was taxable. At the current time, it is to be used for official purposes only. Any sums not used for that purpose would revert to the Treasury; and it is not taxable, because it's not considered to be personal sums to the Presidency. I won't go into, unless you want me to, detail on what might be considered some of the specific perks of the Presidency. We have touched upon the issue of the pension, however, that has been in place on a systemic basis only since 1958. At the present time, that pension is key to the salary of the Cabinet secretary. When that salary is increased, so too is the pension of the President. And at current, it is $151,800. Along with that comes the staff allowance and office space as well as security. There's currently a proposal in the 106th Congress to make some changes in that system. When we are talking about the relationship of the President's salary to other Federal salaries, I think that it's sort of interesting to look at how it started out. The Vice President's salary, for example, was 20 percent of the President's; the chief justices was 16 percent. And in 1856, when Members first came into an annual pay salary, that salary was set at 12 percent. In 1949, the Vice President's salary was 30 percent, and the chief justice's was 25\\1/2\\ percent of the Presidency. The 1969 salary changes resulted in 31 percent differentials for the Vice President and the Chief Justice. And while there's been some changes, for the most part those two positions, as well as the Speaker now, are on a par pretty much with one another and have traveled forward to the point where they are almost at 90 percent of the President's salary. And, of course, the question is, whether there is an appropriate differential between those salaries? If we were to look at OPM figures, using an inflator of 3\\1/2\\ percent would put those three salaries above the salary of the President by the year 2003, which means, of course, if there's no change in 2001, we will have a problem. The question is, then, do we keep those two down and not change the Presidency, or do we change the President's salary, allow those salaries to progress, or is there a decision made that the salary of the President shouldn't bear relationship to salaries of other officials in the government? At the current time, if you want to open the discussion of compression, the senior executive service, which is our standard core of executives both in management and in their technical expertise, most of whom, 90 percent, are career employees and not politi"
