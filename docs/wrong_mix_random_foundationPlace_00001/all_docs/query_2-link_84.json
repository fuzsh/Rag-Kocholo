        "text": "In November 1963, the assassination of Ngô Đình Diệm, South Vietnam’s first president, placed the United States’ decade-long efforts to create an independent South Vietnam in jeopardy. Dwight Eisenhower and John Kennedy both viewed Southeast Asia as an area of importance to US security during their presidencies. In picking up for the fallen Kennedy, President Johnson felt compelled to carry on America’s commitment to the region, and between 1963 and 1965, several foreign policy decisions escalated the conflict. However, Johnson also envisioned himself a champion of major social reform. He worried that conducting a large-scale war in Vietnam would jeopardize “The Great Society,” the comprehensive domestic agenda he sought to achieve. As the 1964 presidential campaign got underway, the president quickly realized that balancing American interests at home and abroad would fully test his political skills.\n\nOn August 2, 1964, North Vietnamese PT boats reportedly engaged the American destroyer USS Maddox in the Gulf of Tonkin off the coast of Vietnam. Two days later, the situation escalated; on August 4, both the Maddox and USS Turner Joy reported attacks by North Vietnamese military units in the Gulf. President Johnson characterized the attacks as “unprovoked,” ordering retaliatory air strikes. He turned to Congress with these reports, whose members responded swiftly. The Tonkin Gulf Resolution authorized military force in Vietnam and granted the President the right to take “all necessary measures to repel any armed attacks against the forces of the United States and to prevent further aggression.” The resolution went immediately to Congress, where the House unanimously approved it following only a 45-minute discussion. In the Senate, many felt the call to ”rally round the flag,” but a number held concerns about the resolution’s legality and the wisdom of “giving the President of the United States war making powers in the absence of a formal declaration of war.” Senator Wayne Morse (D-OR) argued that “history will record that [Congress has] made a great mistake in subverting and circumventing the Constitution of the United States.” 1 Senators Ernest Gruening (D-AK), Frank Church (D-ID), and Albert Gore, Sr. (D-TN) all shared misgivings about Vietnam. The turning point in the Senate debate was Senator William Fulbright’s argument characterizing the resolution as a continuation of current policy that related specifically to the actions in the Gulf of Tonkin. Ultimately, the measure passed 88-2 with only Senators Gruening and Morse dissenting.\n\nMilitary actions intensified after Johnson’s reelection. Within months, several thousand American troops and billions of dollars were committed to the Vietnam conflict, bound by the Tonkin Gulf Resolution that now forced Congress to support military operations via appropriations.\n\nIn July 1965, Johnson deployed 50,000 troops to Vietnam and privately committed to sending more troops by year’s end. The administration largely concealed its policy from Congress, fearing debate about the war would damage the Great Society, yet it still attracted criticism. House Republicans largely supported a firm policy in Southeast Asia and fighting a war against Communism at any cost. They criticized Johnson for extensive spending on domestic programs that could be reappropriated to defense and his “lack of candor” for confusing the American public about the scope and direction of the military effort.\n\nConstituents from across the country wrote to Congress with messages of support for a stronger war effort and the men fighting; pleas to leave Vietnam and an unwinnable situation; and calls for the small but growing contingent of war protestors to be tried for treason.\n\nSoon, rifts began to appear between those calling for a full-scale war, those who supported President Johnson’s limited engagement plans, and those who feared the open-ended action escalating into a third World War.\n\nIn the conflict’s ensuing years, many voices weighed in on the rising costs of military operations in Vietnam. The number of casualties increased as the peace process stalled. Anti-war sentiment took root among American universities and civil rights groups. Politicians debated the foreign and domestic ramifications of continued action or withdrawal. Eventually, the anti-war movement, growing military and government dissent, and the work of Senate doves were able to disentangle the United States from Vietnam. Following peace talks with Vietnam in France, President Richard Nixon ordered a ceasefire on January 15, 1973. Senator Barry Goldwater, who previously supported the American role in Vietnam, said: \"I can't say peace is at hand, but I feel that we're making progress.\" 2 In April 1975, as North Vietnamese forces surrounded Saigon, President Gerald Ford called the war, “finished as far as America is concerned.” Materials presented here from 1965 to 1966 document the growing sense of awareness and nervous concern over the unfolding military crisis in Vietnam."
