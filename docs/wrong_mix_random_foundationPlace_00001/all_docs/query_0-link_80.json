Ford Introduction Gerald Rudolph Ford Jr. was the 38th President of the United States. Born in Omaha, Nebraska, Ford went from being a son of divorcees to the leader of a nation. Childhood Gerald Ford was born on July 14th, 1913 in Omaha, Nebraska. His birth name was Leslie Lynch King Jr., after his father. Ford s mother, Dorothy Ayer Gardner King, left King roughly two weeks after his birth. Oddly enough, Ford did not know about his biological father until he was 17. Dorothy then moved with her son to Grand Rapids, Michigan. In 1916, she married a paint salesman named Gerald Rudolph Ford, who adopted her son. Leslie Lynch King Jr. was then known as Gerald Rudolph ... Show more content on Helpwriting.net ... Ford did not die an unaccomplished man. Even in his early years, the man achieved many things. In high school, Ford was a member of the honor society and both the All City and All State football teams. Even before his presidency, the man was involved in politics. This started in 1940, when he participated in Wendell Willkie s presidential campaign. Later, Ford and fraternity brother from the University of Michigan, Philip A. Buchen, set up a law partnership in the place he grew up: Grand Rapids, Michigan. During World War II, Ford joined the Navy, serving in the South Pacific and holding the rank of lieutenant commander. In 1948, Ford became a member of Congress, which he was a part of for 25 years. Later on, in 1965, he served the role of House minority leader. Even after his presidency, Ford was active in politics. He went to hundreds of colleges and universities to speak about issues such as foreign policy, Congressional relations, and federal budget policies. In 1979, Ford released a memoir called A Time to Heal: The Autobiography of Gerald R. Ford. In 1981, the Gerald R. Ford Library and the Gerald R. Ford Museum were dedicated. Ford went to conferences at both of these places and would discuss various political subjects such as German reunification, relations with the Soviet Union, and national security.

Throughout time and history, it has progressed from the most primitive mechanisms to the most computerized mechanics. It has been stomping on an ever progressing march, from which an end to it would require special instruments to see even the tiniest glimpse of. However, as the species behind such advancing technology, we must be careful with it or dire consequences lie in store. It is not exactly certain what kind of consequences would actually occur should we grow reckless with its power, but many scenarios have been imagined. However, if something were to go wrong and technology would be free from our reign, what would it do next? Without technology, where would man go? And without mankind, what would technology do? Mankind and technology are dependent on each other, in a relationship where one would be lost without the other. This necessary relationship is explored in Brian Aldiss Who Could Replace Man? c. 1958. In the story, A field minder robot is turning the topsoil of a field as morning dawns. It then went down to its sector s seed distributor to request an order of seed potatoes. However, the store for such seed potatoes to be accessed is locked. Due to the hierarchy of brain classes they have, from which the field minder is a Class Three brain while the distributor is a Class Five, the field minder states its supremacy to the distributor, and thus goes to see why the unlocker has not unlocked the store.

Changes of Weaponry and Warfare during the Middle Ages During the Middle Ages, or also known as the Medieval Ages, change was a major part of that period. Europe was watching war become much different. In the older times, a few thousands of troops were considered a large army. Nowadays, nobody has ever seen such size of an army with such variety in weapons including guns, munitions, and artillery that were all developed during that period. Besides, it was obvious that the face of warfare was changing by the end of the fifteenth century. Two of the most significant developments were the maintaining of a fair amount of troops on a permanent basis at the ready, and the rising need of gunpowder weapons and munitions. In essence The Middle ... Show more content on Helpwriting.net ... When there are weapons, there is also armor. Knights wore a chainmail called the hauberk and according to Hilliam, the hauberk was extended to include iron sleeves, mittens, and a hood (19). In addition, knights also needed better methods to protect a vulnerable area, the head. The great helm had been introduced by the thirteenth century and it covered the head and the face with extra protection (Hilliam 19). It wasn t too long until the great helm was replaced by the bascinet. It was similar to the great helm although it was a more closely fitted 5 Tran helmet with rounded surfaces to deflect blows. A removable or hinged visor was fitted to make breathing easier, and padding was riveted for additional comfort (Hilliam 20). By the middle of the fourteenth century, the chainmail was basically abandoned and plate armor was much more desired. It had glancing surfaces and it protected knights from arrows far better than the mail (Hilliam 32). But over time, knights seek more extensive armor and simultaneously, bigger horses were needed in order to carry the weight and bigger lances made from tree trunks (Hilliam 17). However, blacksmiths kept placing their focus into creating more developed plate armor and as plate armor did develop, Hilliam says that, it was less effective to slash an opponent and so knights tried to thrust through chinks ...

Swales very first step says a discourse community has a broadly agreed set of common public goals (Swales 220) which are achieved in a variety of ways including the mechanisms of intercommunications among its members (Swales 221). A discourse community utilizes and hence possesses one or more genres in the communicative furtherance of its aims (Swales 221).

It declared that any and all persons could be detained and taken off of the West Coast due to military necessity. Executive Order 9066 was established because on December 7, 1941, Japan struck a United States Naval Base in Honolulu, Hawaii killing 2,043 Americans and injuring 1,000 more American citizens.

The United States was worried that Japanese American citizens would be loyal to their descendant country and they did not want anyone to be able to further sabotage the United States in World War II. Leland Ward, a governmental representative for California, argued that the internment was justified in January of 1942, To prevent any fifth column activity...all Japanese, whether citizens or not, be placed in inland concentration camps (Document A). The government wanted to prevent spying, or fifth column activity, from occurring while the United States was in a fragile state.

Restaurant Business Report Business report Executive summary As the world gets intricate and complex courtesy of new trends and social waves, no sector of life seems to be left behind. The hospitality industry is faced with one of the greatest challenges ever and all attention and focus is certainly geared toward addressing customer satisfaction. However, without efficient information systems and proper technological applications, the whole efforts are always insufficient or wasted. The need to upgrade systems and improve operations is the main strategic objective of most restaurant executives. This report is therefore an analysis of the need to apply the modern information systems in the industry and embrace the growing usage of the point of sale system (POS) that has become the industry norm across the world. In a way, most hoteliers and restaurant owners are confronted with unrelenting demand to radically transform operations or to exit the market. To avoid the latter, implementation is inevitable.

The Bill Of Rights A controversial topic that many protested for was, freedom of speech. After many years of wanting to be heard, Americans finally achieved the assurance of having a voice. The Bill of Rights was passed on December 15, 1791; commencing with the First Amendment. The First Amendments defends freedom of speech, press, religion, assembly and petition. Stated in the U.S. Constitution, the First Amendment declares Congress shall make no law... abridging the freedom of speech. Thus, meaning that citizens cannot be imposed of civil liability from what they say or write with exceptions. Even though freedom of speech recognizes many arguments, discussions, and expression, it will only be valid through the qualifications the First Amendments states with the exceptions included. Highly entrenched in the constitution, freedom of speech is one of the most treasured freedoms that has been protected once achieved. Many back in the day, fought for this privilege that we now have. Back then, they were not allowed to speak against the government with topics such as, unfair laws, taxation, etc. With such privilege though, there had to be some clarifications. Freedom of speech does not imply that there is a right to speak anywhere and at any time. There is a time and place for everything.

The object of this essay is to establish whether there is an ethical theory that can be successfully applied to business organizations.

After that, the ethical needs, problems and limitations of work organizations will have to be examined so that the different theories can be evaluated in this context. It will also be important to draw a distinction between the terms accurate and useful as these actually result in two different questions the answer to which need not necessarily be the same.

However, as a pragmatic and functional system of moral analysis, Utilitarianism has a number of difficulties. One of the major problems is the fact that it is extremely difficult to quantify happiness, and if it is not possible to decide which of several available actions produces the most happiness, it follows that it is not possible to decide which action is the right one. Also a particular action generating a high degree of happiness may have unforeseen consequences that have the opposite effect. Can it be morally right to have a completely innocent and well person killed if two seriously ill people could be saved by an organ transplantation? Is an action always and incontrovertibly right because it gives greatest happiness to the greatest number of people? Brady(1999) refutes this: the majority vote is not an ethic; it is a social choice technique. Deontology as promoted by Kant on the other hand denies that the right action is the one that produces the best consequences. It is based on a set of moral rules, and the right action is supposed to be the one that conforms with these rules, whereas certain other types of action are morally forbidden.

Why Did Edward I Achieve The Hardship Of Scotland There are many things that all occurred that had allowed for Edward I of England to achieve the overlordship of Scotland. From the controlling of Wales and Ireland, he eventually gained control of Man. The fact that the Church of Scotland was not completely recognised by the papacy meant that the kings of Scotland were not real kings in the eyes of Edward I. The surprise death of Alexander III, quickly followed by the death of the Maid of Norway led to a succession crisis and the potential for a civil war for the right to rule in Scotland. The guardians appointed after the death of Alexander III apparently all worked together for the future of Scotland and this possibly had an impact on Edward I agreeing to the terms in the treaty of Birgham ... Show more content on Helpwriting.net ... Yet Morris claims that the idea of a subservient Scotland dates back to before the times of the Romans . Whatever one is more accurate, the essence of both draw attention to the English frame of mind that Scotland should be under the control of England and that the ruler of Scotland should pay fealty to his English counterpart. Throughout the middle ages English rulers had been attempting to assert their authority over their Scottish counterparts. The inauguration of Alexander III reveals another cause of conflict on the issue of overlordship. Whilst there were items such as a sword, a sceptre and a crown used in the inauguration, this was not quite a coronation. For he was not anointed nor was his crown blessed by any of the churchmen present. The Scots had been in contact with the papacy in an attempt to make this ceremony sacred, but they had been rejected thanks to intervention by the English. For that reason Edward would have seen the Scottish kings as inferior and not as kingly as the English king. Since the English rulers viewed Scotland as inferior and that their rulers should pay homage to their English counterparts, England should already hold dominion over ...

We might envision a family alternating between algebra and Bible study, keeping a safe distance from the rampant worldliness in schools. Or perhaps we see children sitting around the kitchen table practicing spelling while mother supervises. Despite these traditional images, home schooling is growing and gaining respect. This is due in part to high profile success stories like home schoolers finishing first, second and third in the 2000 Scripps Howard National Spelling Bee or the Colfax family in California who sent three sons to Harvard. However, home schooling raises many questions ... Show more content on Helpwriting.net ... Both the left and right wings of home schooling are active today with an estimated 1.5 million home schooled children, as many families have both philosophical and religious for their choice (Kantrowitz Wingert 1). Joining them are many home schoolers who simply seek the highest quality education for their child, which they believe public and even private schools can no longer provide. Forty years ago home schooling did not satisfy compulsory education requirements in most states. Due to a gradual change in legislature, all states accept home schooling as a valid alternative but regulations vary by state. Lines asserts that at a minimum, families must file basic information with either the state or local education agency (3/8). One of the most important criteria to consider when looking at home schooling is academics. In an era when the focus on accountability has become magnified, achievement of scholars is key to evaluating education. One of the first things to consider when looking at the academic quality of education is the ability of the teacher.

Comparing Berger And Luckmann Traditional economics bases human decisions off of price and income; however, Berger and Luckmann differentiate their theory by utilizing social construction to explain behavior. At the most basic level, Berger and Luckmann view man as homo socius, individuals influenced and molded by their social surroundings into the person that they are. Humans come to understand their personal reality through socialization as it provides them with their own meanings of themselves and the world that they are in. Two main types of socialization function to form humans in this model: primary socialization, which begins at birth and develops as the core of one s self and secondary socialization, which occurs after primary socialization from the accrual of information ... Show more content on Helpwriting.net ... Habitualization allows an everyday act to become engrained into reality and require less effort as it becomes increasingly fortified in daily life. Narrowed choices simplify decision making and generate a stable foundation that allows people to make larger decisions without worrying about the less important ones. Since all human activity can be habitualized, each individual will develop different habits based off of their own daily routines. For instance, if Starbucks is directly on my way to class and I have been socialized to enjoy drinking coffee, I begin to stop in at Starbucks increasingly more before class. With repetition, this activity becomes solidified as a part of my daily routine and takes less effort to decide whether I want to stop at Starbucks or suffer through my class under caffeinated. Eventually, when both actors reciprocally typify habitualizations, these actions become institutionalized. Typification is the process we undergo to create standard social constructions based on the standard assumptions we share. Actors typify interactions between individuals, externalizing their own subjective ideas and making them more concrete as they now become objective to the other actors. Typically, these institutions are considered to be obvious social structures such as family or government, however, they can even be extended to my Starbucks example. My role as the customer is buying coffee, while the employee s role is providing service. This action becomes typified by us and replicated by others, forming an institution of social construction; as the subjective memory of the actions fades, they become the natural order of things.

Just like when Osama Bin laden was assassinated the U.S luckily didn t discriminate everyone who was Arabian. IN other words, think of better solutions before going to extremes. Reliance of authority also played a role. In this scenario everyone followed ex president Roosevelt s decisions. Reliance of Authority is when you believe everything someone is saying is accurate and beneficial. In this case Roosevelt s order was followed by everybody. U.S citizens wanted the Japanese away.

Futura Is A Sans Serif Typeface Futura is a sans serif typeface. It is classified as geometric, meaning that the looks of the letterforms are based on geometric shapes. The bowls of the letters are almost perfect circles and the peaks of some letters such as W s and uppercase A s create triangles. This gives the letterforms a very simple look that can be broken down into just a few key elements. For example, letters such as the lowercase d and b are made up of a circle and str¬aight, vertical line on one side, and letters such as the uppercase T are simply made up of two perfectly straight lines one horizontal and one vertical, with the vertical line extending directly below the center of the horizontal line. The lowercase t changes things up a bit with the fact that the two lines are off centered. Instead of being directly in the center like the uppercase, the vertical line is positioned slightly to the left. The lowercase f mimics this as well. There are 22 different typefaces that make up the Futura family. These include regular, light, light, book, medium, semibold, bold, extrabold, black, italic, condensed, oblique, display, and inline. The weight of the strokes is near even which results in little to no contrast. It has a tall x height making it easier to read even at small sizes.

Involuntary Psychiatric Commitment Chapter 15 Summary Chapter 15 Summary: Involuntary Psychiatric Commitment Many ethical issues surround the involuntary psychiatric commitment of mentally ill patients. In the 1980s, the city of Manhattan was overwhelmed by the surplus of mentally unstable and homeless individuals residing on the streets. In an effort to help relieve the burden on the city, Project Help was created to provide assistance to the needy. Joyce Brown, a 40 year old homeless woman, slept outside of an ice cream parlor for 18 months. Her appearance suggested that she was mentally unstable and in a state of constant self neglect. Project Help forcibly admitted her to the emergency department of a local hospital and injected with antipsychotic drugs and tranquilizers. After being evaluated ...

Thomas Szasz, a famous psychiatrist, argues that psychiatry should only help those who voluntarily seek help and criticized the notion of involuntary commitment. He believes that this is simply a way to rid society of strange people. Szasz held that any mental illness without physical symptoms is a myth and not a disease and should be treated as such. In 1972, Federal Judge Frank Johnson ruled that all committed mental patients should either receive individual treatment or be released. This ruling helped to establish the two necessary conditions for involuntary commitment, that one must be insane and a danger to oneself or others. The release of new psychotropic medications in the 1970s allowed for more outpatient treatment and shifted the field of psychiatry towards deinstitutionalization. The idea was to remove the reliance on mental institutions and replace it with the embrace of community. The prevalence of violence crimes among the mentally ill and homeless caused a public push for the incarceration of potentially dangerous mentally ill citizens.

Only wearing his distressed shorts and carrying a sharp stick in his right hand, Jack crouches to within inches of the ground as the narrator notes, He closed his eyes, raised his head, and breathed in gently with flared nostrils, assessing the current of warm air for information. The forest and he were very still (Golding 48). Jack continues walking forward. The forest is quiet, more overwhelming than the heat. As the sound from a bird echoes through the trees, Jack crouches for cover and the narrator notes, And for a minute became less a hunter than a furtive thing, ape like among the tangle of trees (Golding 49). On his knees, Jack angrily scrutinizes the ground, looking for a clue. Moving like a shadow under the trees, he stoops down again and examined the ground. With his spear raised Jack walks deeper into the forest. Finally, he comes across a pig run. After hearing movement Jack steadily rises to his feet. Moving his right arm back, he threw the spear with all his might. The sound of hoofs stammering comes from the pig run, which meant for Jack, meat.

Thomas Hardy s Tess Of The D Urbervilles The Victorian Era allowed England to become one of the most balanced and established countries through the reign of Queen Victoria.

Despite an increase of meaningful reforms and additional welfare for the England s citizens, the interpretation of religion in the country began to alter as well. The actions of parliament and the Victorian Society had enormous effects on the people and the way they viewed English society.

The Critical Race Theory basically states that the individuals are pushed around to change socially and individually due to pressures from the society. (Solorzano and Barnal p 311) This theory is based on the fact that race is merely a social construction and it goes on to affect other components throughout the society. A Hanegy Lopen (2000) state that race of a country is typically determined by the dominant group in that society. The dominant group will thus construct the social order and mould the entire structure in a way that promotes in interest. (Henry 2010) This is the basis that further promotes this paper. The Anglo Saxon or the white race is the predominant one in Canada. People who are not white are usually inquired about where they are from because they definitely aren t Canadian.

The Louvre was not founded as a museum, and the road to attaining today s program expanded across six centuries of monarchies, wars, treaties, and revolution.

As the decades turned, the old Louvre acclimated to the needs of the monarchies, undergoing usage as both a stronghold and a retreat, but entirely defense based nonetheless (Deitz). Two centuries passed when Charles V altered the program from a bulwark of protection, changing it into a residency. Here the program shifted towards a notion of more public structure. Several French kings after, Francis I decorated the bulky fortress with a French renaissance style, further changing the Louvre s appearance and adapting the architecture to the art style of the time.

Different with Google, Yahoo has moderately earned more income from the words of city such as Florence, Paris and Rome. This may be resulted from the difference search methods that Yahoo mainly focuses on web contents keywords. Overture more likely to gain revenue in words that relate with cities in eastern part of Europe like Athens, Tunis, Amman. Overture loses money on broad unspecific words. Thus, Overture should focus on the exact keywords which have connection with flight and travel to eastern part of Europe. MSN US and MSN Global costs mainly derived from phrase keywords except Air France Brand keywords. For example, phrase keyword of travel to France generates moderate number of 346 clicks, but none of the clicks succeed in sales conversion.

Trauma and Adult Learning Essay Trauma and Adult Learning Effects of Trauma on Learning Adults experiencing the effects of past or current trauma may display such symptoms as difficulty beginning new tasks, blame, guilt, concern for safety, depression, inability to trust (especially those in power), fear of risk taking, disturbed sleep, eroded self esteem/confidence, inability to concentrate, or panic attacks (Mojab and McDonald 2001). Some people may manifest no symptoms; at the other end of the spectrum is Posttraumatic Stress Disorder, characterized by flashbacks, avoidance, numbing of responsiveness (including substance abuse), persistent expectation of danger, constriction (dissociation, zoning out), and memory impairment (Isserlis 2001).

A number of authors urge reframing of these discourses: Instead of diagnosing and treating victims, find ways to make the learning environment safer for everyone (Horsman 1997). Recognize the role of power in limiting individual agency and choice and the ways in which institutions make personal and structural violence possible and legitimize it (Pearce 1999). Acknowledge the hidden learning that occurs through traumatic experiences (Horsman 2000b; Williamson 2000). What is learned from trauma and how might educators respond? Studies of people enduring extreme situations suggest that learning is a key to survival in adversity (Williamson 2000). Successful learning is supposed to occur when conditions are right: accessible opportunities, time, appropriate support, safety, motivation, risks with manageable consequences (ibid.). Yet in extreme situations, learning must take place quickly and without the right conditions. What is learned in response to trauma is influenced by prior knowledge, background, familial and social relationships, and personal qualities and abilities (Pearce 1999; Williamson 2000). This is not to blame the victim for inappropriate learning or responses, but to underscore the importance of resources and support and the recognition that learning has to be geared to meet a range of individual needs. Some of the hidden learning from trauma includes the following: All or nothing reactions such as shifting between ... Get more on HelpWriting.net ...\n\n41. Art Is A Catalyst Of Change Art is a catalyst of change. It can confront both social and political issues as well as providing people with a creative outlet in which they can express their innermost thoughts and feelings but what effect can art have on our society as a whole? Artists today have the unique ability to connect with people in a creative, innovative way that they can understand and interpret themselves. With this ability, artists are able to express their own views as well as influencing the views of others. Art is an immense part of our world so much so that we barely even consider its impact upon us but just how significant is the work of artists in our modern day society? It is believed that, in society, we can be controlled by art and it can be used as a weapon to dictate the way we think and view things. Jazz composer and artistic director Tim Hagans states that people are afraid of artists; they possess the power to encourage open mindedness, individuality, and celebrate the importance of freedom of thought. That is why in any repressive movement, it is the artists, regardless of their race, ethnicity or religious affiliation that are neutralised first he told the World Artist Network. This, in terms of historical evidence, is true. When Italy was under fascist rule (1922 1943), Prime Minister Benito Mussolini ordered nationwide censorship and supervision of all art: radio stations, newspapers, cinema etc were all monitored to ensure that they did not criticise the state and ...

Prince Hal in Shakespeare s Henriad Essay Prince Hal in Shakespeare s Henriad The question that Shakespeare raises throughout the series of Henry IV, Part I, Henry IV, Part II, and Henry V is that of whether Prince Hal (eventually King Henry V), is a true manifestation of an ideal ruler, and whether he is a rightful heir to his father s ill begotten throne. England is without a true king, being run by a ruler without the right of divine providence on his side altogether, a very difficult situation for a young, inexperienced, and slightly delinquent Prince to take on. The task of proving himself a reliable Prince and a concerned ruler is of utmost importance to Hal, as he does not enjoy the mantle of divine right perhaps by being an excellent ruler, Hal can make up for the ... Show more content on Helpwriting.net ... Furthermore, Shakespeare gives the audience the reason that Hal acts this way: after Hal is left alone, he speaks his true mind, explaining that when this loose behaviour I throw off/ And pay the debt I never promised,/ By so much shall I falsify men s hopes;/ And, like bright metal on a sullen ground,/ My reformation, glittering o er my fault,/ Shall show more goodly and attract more eyes/ Than that which hath no foil to set it off./ I ll so offend to make offence a skill,/ Redeeming time when men think least I will. (1H4, 1.2.199 207) Prince Hal shows a great deal of insight in this revelation; his words show that he realizes he has a twofold boundary to overcome: first, he is seen as overly juvenile and flighty by most of his father s men; second, and more importantly, Hal knows that he has no claim to the divine right to rule, as he is not of Richard II s bloodline. It seems, then, that Hal knows full well the way that men respond to the image of royalty, and [is] no less instinctive a politician than his father, and is in fact the creator as well as the creature of political mythology, the author as well as the hero of his legend (Ornstein, 137). By rising phoenix like out of the ashes, Hal knows that he will make a more compelling impression on England than if he had been conventionally princely all his life, and plays this dramatic advantage to ...

Negative Effects Of Social Media On College Students Social Media Use and Depressive Symptoms in College Students In an ever changing world, technology has pervaded almost every aspect of the average person s life. Along with advances in technology has emerged the rise of social media sites, where individuals can take pictures of events, update statuses, mark the places they have been, and the foods they have eaten. Young adults have been at the forefront of using these social networking sites to display their actions and aspects of their lives to the public world. While one may think these sites are intended to bring joy to others, and put people in connection with one another, the display of other s lives may have a negative effect on the viewer. Among groups who may be negatively affected by these social networking sites are college students, who face a new environment, and commonly experience a fear of missing out from viewing the lives of others. While these social media sites may be fine in small amounts, the increased consumption of multiple social media sites may have a negative effect on the happiness of college students, which may produce a link to depressive symptoms.

The choice of the occupational and recreational roles of an individual was also unquestionable due to traditional definitions of maleness and femaleness and the determination of what actions and activities are appropriate for each. Those who choose to deviate from the norm faced a major dilemma associated with these sex roles that fell into two characteristics: severe social retribution and accepting or rejecting the socially prescribed role. When disturbing the balance of a society by deviating from the traditional standards one is subject to ostracism and alienation. Thomas and Znaniecki (1918 1920) introduced the idea that a person s thinking processes and attitudes are constructed by the interaction between that person s situation and his or her behavior. Those individuals who willing rejected the traditional values, beliefs, and ideas were ultimately subject to death. The allocation of the roles is based solely on the most obvious differences between men and women. Men were larger, stronger and possessed a greater amount of endurance where as women were viewed as smaller, weaker and were considered flawed because of menstruation. Men were favored because of their physical strength, the absentness of periodic bleeding, and did not participate in any role of bearing and nurturing of children.

Jane Addams and the Progressive Movement Essay Jane Addams and the Progressive Movement Works Cited Not Included Jane Addams is recognized as a social and political pioneer for women in America. In her biography, which later revealed her experiences in Hull House, she demonstrates her altruistic personality, which nurtured the poor and pushed for social reforms. Although many of Addams ideas were considered radical for her time, she provided women with a socially acceptable way to participate in both political and social change. She defied the prototypical middle class women by integrating the line that separated private and political life. Within these walls of the settlement house, Addams redefined the idea of ?separate spheres,? and with relentless determination, she ... Show more content on Helpwriting.net ... More and more women were becoming teachers during this period, and it was continuously being associated as a female entity. Women were allowed to engage in certain social affairs. Although this did not include fighting for the reduction of labor hours or the elimination of child labor, it did encompass helping the poor, which was the immediate motive behind establishing Hull House. Reaching out to women who needed a place to stay, or workers who could not afford to live in the crowded and unsanitary apartments that usually stuffed several families in one room, could find shelter in Addam?s creation. However, Addams worked extended beyond the ?private sphere? in too many areas to ignore. Her struggle led to many social and political reforms; she took a very radical political stance for her time, breaking her association from the standard middle class women. Hull House was unique in the sense that it held a position in both the public and private spheres of society. Within the private sphere, women in the Addam?s settlement house ran the household, raised children, taught about the necessity of morals, and preached about religion. In addition, Hull House members offered assistance to their community, which later encompassed the realm of the private sphere. Such actions included teaching, daycare, art galleries, and libraries. ??Hull House in the ... Get more on HelpWriting.net ...\n\n48.
