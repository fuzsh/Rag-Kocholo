        "text": "One of my favourite projects at Energicity was building our partnership with The Rockefeller Foundation, The Global Energy Alliance for People and Planet (GEAPP), and CARE International to support 6,000 women entrepreneurs in Sierra Leone, powered by our solar mini-grids. Our incredible female customers have been through war, Ebola, and now, climate change. By providing them with brand-new, energy-efficient freezers, they're setting up local convenience stores, selling medicines, cold drinks, and fish, bringing 25%+ more income back to their families! Very proud of the team Nicole Poindexter, Patrick Ayemeli, Medenu Elorm Ernest üëè\n\nI absolutely LOVED sitting in one of the world's foremost classrooms for 4 days, soaking in conversations and exchanging our ideas with top thought leaders on trade issues impacting the world today. As a policy newbie, I thoroughly enjoyed digging into the world of diplomacy, wrapping my head around the complexities of trade law, and putting together the pieces of how the world makes decisions. One key takeaway for the climate nerds like me: good news - climate action is now indisputably at the top of the agenda for policymakers. Bad news - we're still a little confused about what to do about it. The legacy multilateral system is equipped to meet neither the speed (10 years) nor magnitude (very very complex) demands of climate action, and it'll truly require all hands on deck to tackle it. Stay tuned for our team's post-conference report with our reflections... and a huge thank you to Young Diplomats of Canada - Jeunes diplomates du Canada for making this opportunity possible!\n\ntl;dr: Come replace me! I've done some of the coolest work in my life in this role, hands down. If you are interested in working at the intersection of development and climate action, please reach out. Energicity is #hiring a Product Manager to scale the fastest-growing part of our business: Productive Use of Energy. We give our rural customers, who are using electricity for first time from our solar mini-grids, access to machinery so they can earn more household income and improve their livelihoods. From the creation of this role to now growing a full team, this position is the perfect blend of strategic thinking and on-the-ground operations. Some of the most exciting/nerdiest things I've done include: shipping a container of cold storage facilities from China, hearing from a customer first-hand how excited they are about our streetlights in Sierra Leone, and testing out electric mobility in rural Benin. I seriously can't say enough good things about this role and the team - don't hesitate to reach out if you're interested! https://lnkd.in/e9kpqd5k\n\nI'm incredibly honoured to serve as the Head Delegate, representing Canadian youths at the World Trade Organization's Public Forum in Switzerland next month. As someone with a very private-sector background, I am super excited to look under the hood of public policy, and learn how trade can advance Canada and young people's interests, particularly surrounding #climate action. Stoked to work with and learn from this incredible team! ‚ú®\n\nSix months ago, I joined a couple of online climate communities, searching for my next job at the intersection of climate action and developing markets. After a few cold messages, I was blown away the number of responses I received back. With the help of wonderfully generous and passionate strangers, I found my current role working for Energicity, a solar mini-grid operator in Sierra Leone. Climate change is the most pressing and complex challenge facing humankind today, and it has already grown to intersect with every industry. Climate will be the future of careers, and the good news is - it has (and needs) a spot for everyone, no matter your background. If you are interested in taking the first step into climate action, I can't rave enough about the Work on Climate and MCJ Collective communities!\n\ntl;dr - if you are a young woman in high school or post-secondary, and want to: - learn how to make your money work for you - have a 1:1 personal coaching session with a financial advisor - discuss the disproportionate impacts of COVID-19 on women and what we can do about it then, sign up for the conference here: http://bit.ly/WAFLC2 FuturFund is hosting our annual flagship event, Women & Financial Literacy Conference next week, sponsored by CPP Investments on March 11-12.
