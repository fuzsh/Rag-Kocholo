        "text": "Nettie Maria Stevens 1899 was, according to Jordan, one of the ablest scientific investigators developed at Stanford. She went to Bryn Mawr as Associate in Experimental Morphology, where she remained until her death in 1912. She went to the Woman's Table at the Zoological station in Naples, Italy for study, and in 1905 won the $1000 research prize offered by the Naples Table Association. In 1908, she was awarded the first Alice Freeman Palmer Fellowship by the Association of Collegiate Alumnae, spending her year of study partly at the Woman's Table of the Zoological Station in Naples.\n\nAnother prominent early woman graduate was Lou Henry, class of 1898, the first female student to graduate with a degree in geology. She married another Stanford graduate, Herbert Hoover, who was elected the 31st president of the United States in 1928.\n\nLou Henry Hoover played a large role in the design of the Hoovers’ campus home, collaborating with art professor Arthur B. Clark and his son, architect Birge Clark. Following her death in 1944, the house was named in her honor and donated to the Stanford for use as the official residence of the university president.\n\nOther early notable graduates included:\n\nJessie Thompson ('92) who with her husband founded the Washburn School in San Jose.\n\nSeveral from the first graduating class in 1895:\n\nBertha L. Chapman (Mrs. V. M. Cady), a leading apostle of nature study and Lecturer on Hygiene at Chico, California.\n\nAnnie Lyle, who became an M.D., a specialist in the care of women and children, practicing in San Francisco.\n\nSusan B. Bristol (1897) who for years was the appointment secretary at Stanford; later in journalism in New York City.\n\nAnne Martin (1896) who became professor of history at the University of Nevada. She was an active worker in the campaign for women's suffrage her reputation was spread across the nation to younger women interested in the cause. She had hoped to become a U,S. Senator from Nevada but that state was not ready to accept her.\n\nLaura Steffens (Mrs. Allen H. Suggett) (1896) who was for many years assistant in the State Library in Sacramento, later being in charge of the Sutro Library in San Francisco.\n\nAgnes Howe (1897) who became Superintendent of Schools in Santa Clara County.\n\nMargaret Schallenberger (Mrs. John McNaught) (1898) who first became instructor in Education at Stanford, later teacher in the State Normal School at San Jose.\n\nDuring the first decade, only six women were appointed to the faculty, three of them never going beyond the level of assistant professor. The first, Mary Sheldon Barnes, appointed in 1891, was Assistant Professor of History until 1896. Barnes took up the relatively new area of study concerning Western American history. She sent students out to interview early settlers and document the neighborhood’s native American and Hispanic heritage. Her course is a campus favorite despite its heavy workload.\n\nLouise Dodge was an Assistant Professor of Latin from 1896 to 1900.\n\nDuring the next decade (1900-1910). three women of the faculty should be mentioned, all of them graduates of Stanford. Perhaps first should be mentioned Clelia Duel Mosher, an early graduate of Stanford (1893), who was an Instructor in Personal Hygiene in 1893-94. She went to Johns Hopkins for a Medical degree, returning to Stanford in 1900 to be Professor of personal Hygiene and Medical Adviser of women until she retired in 1928. Mosher collected data on women’s sexual views and practices. Her 28-year research of 45 women remained unpublished until 1974. Her landmark survey predates Kinsey by 50 years; her findings debunk the popular view of Victorian and early 20th-century women as passionless and sexually ignorant.\n\nMary Yost followed and was Dean and Associate Professor of English from 1921 to 1946 when she retired. It was Miss Yost who carried the Victorian tradition to Stanford with rigid standards for dress and conduct for young women students. In 1935, she calls attention to evidence of “a growing tendency of some students to regard the university as a country club rather than as an educational institution.” Supported by two academic studies that rank Stanford lower than expected and significantly lower than the University of California, this country club reputation, which lingers until the start of the war, hampers the university’s ability to solicit much-need alumni support.\n\nOf the 11 women appointed to the faculty by Jordan five of them were graduates of Stanford.\n\nHazel Hansen, distinguished Greek scholar and classical archaeologist; Helen Farnsworth, a commodity economist of the Food Research Institute, perhaps the first woman to serve on the Advisory Board; Pauline Sears, psychologist, a graduate of Stanford; Irmgard Flugge-Lotz in Aeronautic Engineering and Engineering Mechanics, pioneer fields for a woman; Myra Keen, contributor to conchology, an area of science close to Jordan's interests; Ann Purdy, specialist in cardiology, who at the Stanford Medical School first recommended surgery for a \"blue baby\" (one of the forms of congenital heart disease); Fannie Shaftel, probably the most outstanding person in elementary education in the United States; and Maude Merrill James, who cooperated Lewis Terman in the 1937 revision of the Stanford Binet Intelligence Test. and coauthor of its publication. Later she was responsible for the 1960 revision.\n\nIn 1974, CROW (Center for Research on Women) is established within the Center for Interdisciplinary Research at Stanford. The center was designed to promote and support research on women and to improve the education of women at Stanford. In 1976, it changes its name to the Institute for Research on Women and Gender to more accurately reflect the work of many scholars associated with it. Today, it is known as the Michelle R. Clayman Institute for Gender Research. In addition to supporting research, the institute organizes educational programs and conferences.\n\nIn 1984, Sandy Lerner (Economics MS'81) and Leonard Bosack (CS MS'81) founded Cisco Systems. Bosack was Director of Computer Facilities for Stanford's Department of Computer Science, and Lerner was Director of Computer Facilities for Stanford's Graduate School of Business.\n\nCisco was formed to commercialize the technology developed at Stanford in the late 1970's to support the campus-wide network called SUNet (Stanford University Network), and to integrate a multiplicity of local networks into a single integrated whole.\n\nCisco shipped its first products in March 1986. Today, Cisco is the leading supplier of high-performance, multiprotocol internet-working systems that enable its customers to build large-scale integrated networks of computers. Cisco also manufactures local-area network (LAN) interconnect devices, and multi-protocol computer peripheral equipment.\n\nEngineer, former astronaut, and current Director of the Johnson Space Center, Ellen Ochoa MS 1981, Ph.D. 1985) became the first Hispanic woman in the world to go to space when she served on a nine-day mission aboard the shuttle Discovery in 1993.\n\nAs a pioneer of spacecraft technology, she patented an optical system to detect defects in a repeating pattern. At the NASA Ames Research Center, she led a research group working primarily on optical systems for automated space exploration. As a doctoral student at Stanford, and later as a researcher at Sandia National Laboratories and NASA Ames Research Center, Ochoa investigated optical systems for performing information processing.\n\nOn January 1, 2013, Ochoa made history again by becoming the first Hispanic and second female director of NASA's Johnson Space Center.\n\nOn September 1, 2012, Elizabeth Magill is named Dean of the Shool of Law. Before coming to Stanford she was on the faculty at the University of Virginia School of Law for 15 years, serving most recently as vice dean, the Joseph Weintraub–Bank of America Distinguished Professor of Law, and the Elizabeth D. and Richard A. Merrill Professor.\n\nAn expert in administrative law and constitutional structure, Dean Magill teaches administrative law, constitutional law, and food and drug law. Her scholarly articles have been published in leading law reviews, and she has won several awards for her scholarly contributions. She is a member of the American Law Institute, and served as a fellow in the Program in Law and Public Affairs at Princeton University, a visiting professor at Harvard Law School, and the Thomas Jefferson Visiting Fellow at Downing College, Cambridge University.\n\nOn March 13, 2017, Jennifer Widom, a professor of computer science and of electrical engineering at Stanford University for 24 years, becomes dean of the School of Engineering. A distinguished researcher in data and information management, Widom, is also an innovator in engineering education. Widom taught one of Stanford’s first massive open online courses (MOOCs) and over the past year has been traveling the world teaching computer science in developing countries. Most recently she served as senior associate dean, where she co-led a long-range planning effort with colleague Arun Majumdar to map the future trajectory of one of the world’s leading engineering schools."
