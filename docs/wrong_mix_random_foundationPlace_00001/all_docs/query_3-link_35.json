        "text": "Every child deserves to realize their full health potential, but the reality is that many children and families face barriers to care that keep them from reaching that potential. The impact of health inequities is multiplied for children and youth with special health care needs, who have greater requirements for health and social services and often face discrimination.\n\nWe believe children’s characteristics—including race, ethnicity, language, religion, gender identity, sexual orientation, socioeconomic status, and physical, intellectual, social, behavioral, and developmental abilities—should not affect their access to essential resources and services that ultimately can improve health outcomes.\n\nAnd we know that it will take innovation, collaboration, compassion, and drive to ensure that all children and families can lead their healthiest lives. Our Foundation’s unique approach to health equity—extraordinary care and support for individual kids and families, combined with work to transform health policy and systems of care—sets us apart. All of our efforts are designed with those who have the most acute needs in mind, and are bolstered by rigorous research to understand and address the roots of inequity and develop evidence-based solutions.\n\nLearn more about our focus on health equity in our Program for Children and Youth with Special Health Care Needs.\n\nLearn more about our fundraising efforts to support health equity.\n\nThe Lucile Packard Foundation for Children’s Health adheres to the Statement of Values and Code of Ethics for Nonprofit and Philanthropic Organizations developed by the Independent Sector.\n\nFor our Foundation, chartered as a public charity, these include:\n\nCommitment to the public good;\n\nAccountability to the public;\n\nCommitment beyond the law;\n\nRespect for the worth and dignity of individuals;\n\nRespect for pluralism, diversity, inclusiveness, and social justice;\n\nTransparency, integrity, and honesty;\n\nResponsible stewardship of donors’ and the Foundation’s resources; and\n\nCommitment to excellence and to maintaining the public trust.\n\nAlso see our Conflict of Interest Policy, Whistleblower Policy, and State Nonprofit Disclosures.\n\nCode of Ethics\n\nI.
