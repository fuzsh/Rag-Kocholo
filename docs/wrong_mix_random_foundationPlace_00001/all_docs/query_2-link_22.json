        "text": "Leland Stanford (born March 9, 1824, Watervliet, New York, U.S.—died June 21, 1893, Palo Alto, California) was an American senator from California and one of the builders of the first U.S. transcontinental railroad. Stanford is often grouped with the 19th-century entrepreneurial tycoons who were labeled “robber barons” by their critics and “captains of industry” by their champions.\n\nStanford practiced law in Port Washington, Wisconsin, from 1848 to 1852, before moving to Sacramento, California, where he achieved much success in retailing mining supplies and general merchandise. He also became active in local politics. A Republican, he served as governor of California from 1862 to 1863.\n\nMore From Britannica\n\nrobber baron: Leland Stanford"
