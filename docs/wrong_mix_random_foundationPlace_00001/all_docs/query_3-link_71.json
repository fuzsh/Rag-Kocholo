        "text": "The Ford Stadium in Dallas is an all-sports facility seating more than 32,000 people. It is a landmark in the community, complementing the Southern Methodist University campus and park cities area. The stadium was designed in the collegiate Georgian style consistent with the rest of the campus. Because it is located in central Dallas in a suburban atmosphere, the facility will be subject t emissions from major freeways and airports.\n\nCorrosion needed to be addressed for this reason, and done in a way that would require little or no maintenance making hot-dip galvanized steel perfect for the job. Often specified for stadiums to protect their open-air structures, galvanizing was also chosen because delivery time was critical. The galvanizing process is a climate controlled process conducted regardless of weather-related issues, so the pieces were in and out of the plant in no time. 1300 tons of structural steel, stringers, columns, handrails, and more were galvanized to create the stadium. Hot-dip galvanized steel will provide a low maintenance, aesthetically pleasing structure that will last for generations of fans to enjoy."
