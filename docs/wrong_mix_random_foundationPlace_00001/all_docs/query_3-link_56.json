        "text": "The materials of Anne Armstrong, Counsellor to the President, reflect her responsibilities as the first head of the Office of Women's programs, and other domestic affairs activities, including minority affairs, youth, the Federal Property Council and the Bicentennial. The first woman Cabinet member since Oveta Culp Hobby, Secretary of the Department of Health, Education and Welfare in the Eisenhower Administration (1953-1955), Anne Armstrong was appointed on January 19, 1973, and stayed until December 1974 in the Ford Administration.\n\nThe first three files series, the Alphabetical File, Administrative File, and Subject File, reflect the activities of Anne Armstrong. The Alphabetical File contains correspondence of Anne Armstrong with Administration officials, Republican party members, and Texas and Louisiana political and personal acquaintances including Constance Armitage, Virginia Allan, Roger Ailes, Helen Deitrich Bentley, Arthur Burns, George Bush, Earl Butz, Julie Eisenhower, Barbara Franklin, the first women's recruiter in the White House and her successor, Nola Smith, Gerald and Betty Ford, Representative Martha Griffiths, Virginia Knauer, Gov.

These include: the Staff Correspondence and Memoranda File; the Staff Miscellany File; the Jill Ruckelshaus, Patricia Lindh and Jean Spencer File; the Vera Hirschberg File and the Office of Women's Programs File. Jill Ruckelshaus, wife of former Environmental Protection Agency Director and Deputy Attorney General William Ruckelshaus, joined Anne Armstrong's office as a part-time Special Assistant from early 1973 to March 1974. A member of the National Women's Political Caucus, Jill Ruckelshaus was assisted by Vera Hirschberg, Director of the Office of Women's Programs, and served as an Administration liaison for women's issues. Her work was continued by Staff Assistants Dr. Jean Spencer, formerly of Vice President Agnew's office and Ruckelshaus' successor, Patricia Lindh, former Republican National Committeewoman from Louisiana.
