        "text": "Rutherford B. Hayes served for one term from 1877 to 1881 as the nineteenth U.S. president. He was born in Delaware, Ohio, on October 4, 1822, and graduated from Harvard Law School. At the outbreak of the Civil War, Hayes enlisted in the Union Army, was wounded five times, and rose to the rank of major general. He served in the House of Representatives and served as the governor of Ohio for three terms. The nation was still suffering from the pangs of the Civil War when he became president. One of his first actions was to withdraw Federal troops from the southern states. Hayes enjoyed being president, but disliked politics and chose not to run for a second presidential term. President Hayes was very proud of his ancestry, and especially of his Revolutionary War ancestors. He became an early member of the SAR. President Hayes died in Fremont, Ohio, on January 17, 1893.\n\nBenjamin Harrison served for one term from 1889 to 1893 as the twenty-third U.S. president. He was born on August 20, 1833, at his grandfather’s farm near North Bend, Ohio. Harrison was the grandson of William Henry Harrison, the ninth president of the United States, and the great-grandson of Benjamin Harrison, a signer of the Declaration of Independence. Benjamin Harrison’s term as president fell between the two terms of Grover Cleveland.\n\nThe New Jersey SAR was organized on March 7, 1889, in Newark, New Jersey, and many patriotic men answered the recruiting bugle. The first public activity of the new state-level society was on April 29, 1889, at Elizabeth, New Jersey, when President Harrison visited Elizabeth on his journey to New York for the centennial ceremonies of George Washington’s inauguration as the first American president. At a reception by New Jersey Governor Green at his home, the individual members of the New Jersey SAR were presented to President Harrison. Later, the SAR members served as an honor escort for the president from the governor’s residence to the wharf, where he boarded a barge bound for New York.\n\nPresident Harrison’s wife, Caroline Scott Harrison, was elected as the first president general of the Daughters of the American Revolution. Caroline Harrison and Rutherford B. Hayes’s wife, Lucy Webb Hayes, were cousins. President Harrison died in Indianapolis, Indiana, on March 13, 1901, at the age of sixty-seven.

He was born in Niles, Ohio, on January 29, 1843; attended Allegheny College in Pennsylvania; and volunteered for the Union Army during the Civil War. He distinguished himself in action, rising to the rank of major. William McKinley was the last veteran of the Civil War to be elected as president.

Vice President Theodore Roosevelt succeeded President McKinley.

At the age of forty-two, he was the youngest man to become an American president. Roosevelt was born in New York City on October 27, 1858. He graduated from Harvard University and attended law school. During the Spanish- American War, he led a daring charge up San Juan Hill and later received the Medal of Honor. In 1906, President Roosevelt was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for negotiating the peace treaty between Russia and Japan.\n\nRoosevelt joined the SAR on April 10, 1898, while he was the governor of New York.

Taft was elected president.\n\nAfter his term in office, Taft became a law professor at Yale. In 1921, President Harding appointed Taft as Chief Justice of the Supreme Court.

In 1910, he ran for governor but lost. In 1914, Harding was elected to the United States Senate, becoming Ohio’s first senator elected by popular vote. He served in the Senate from 1915 until his inauguration as president on March 4, 1921, becoming the first sitting senator to be elected as president of the United States.\n\nWarren G. Harding joined the Ohio SAR on July 2, 1920. He was a descendant of Abraham Harding, Jr., who resided in Walhill, New York, at the outbreak of the Revolutionary War. Abraham Harding, Jr., served as a lieutenant in the New York Militia. President Harding was invited to attend the thirty-fourth SAR National Congress held in Nashville, Tennessee.\n\nPresident Harding was the sixth American president to die while in office. While traveling on a “voyage of understanding” through San Francisco, Harding died on August 2, 1923, at the age of fifty-seven.

He was the sixth vice president to become the chief executive on the death of a president. Coolidge was born on July 4, 1872, in Plymouth, Vermont. He was later elected to a full term as U.S. president. Although named John Calvin Coolidge, Coolidge dropped his first name, preferring to use his middle name.\n\nCoolidge graduated with honors from Amherst College in 1895. During his senior year, he wrote an essay on “The Principles Fought for in the American Revolution” and was awarded a gold medal by the SAR.\n\nCoolidge joined the SAR in 1921 while serving as vice president. His Revolutionary ancestor was John Coolidge, who, at the age of nineteen, answered the call in April 1775 and joined the Massachusetts Militia as a private. He fought at the Battle of Bunker Hill and was discharged in 1778.\n\nThe thirty-ninth annual SAR Congress was held in Washington, D.C. Many of the delegates and their spouses marched from the Mayflower Hotel to the White House to be received by Compatriot and President Coolidge. The president briefly spoke to the group and greeted many of the attendees personally.\n\nAfter his presidency, Coolidge served as chairman of the Railroad Commission, an honorary president of the Foundation of the Blind, a director of New York Life Insurance Company, and a trustee of Amherst College. President Coolidge died suddenly of a heart attack at his home in Northampton, Massachusetts, on January 5, 1933, at the age of sixty. He is buried in Notch Cemetery in Plymouth Notch, Vermont.\n\nHerbert C. Hoover served one term as the thirty-first U.S. president from 1929 to 1933. Hoover was born in West Branch, Iowa, on August 10, 1874. He was orphaned at an early age and lived with an uncle in Oregon. In 1891, Hoover graduated from Stanford University. He pursued mining engineering in many parts of the world, including work in Australia, Africa, and China. While in China, he directed food relief operations for victims of the Boxer Rebellion.\n\nWhen World War I began, Hoover was a wealthy mining engineer. He was appointed as chairman of the American Relief Commission, served as the chairman of the Commission for Belgium Relief, and finally became the U.S. Food Administrator. Hoover was recognized as a great humanitarian and an excellent administrator.\n\nHerbert Clark Hoover’s Revolutionary War ancestor was Jacobus Wynne, a private in the first Regiment, Ulster County Militia, New York Troops. Another SAR ancestor was Isaac Sherman, a lieutenant in the Second Regiment of the New York Line. On November 1, 1928, President Hoover accepted an invitation to join the Pennsylvania SAR. He visited the national SAR Headquarters on 16th Street for his SAR membership ceremony.\n\nHoover served separately as part of both Presidents Harding and Coolidge’s administrative cabinets. When President Coolidge chose not to run for reelection, Herbert Hoover ran for and was elected as president. Hoover worked conscientiously at being a good president and has been harshly judged because of the enusing Great Depression. In 1929, the American stock market crashed and the economy collapsed. There was widespread unemployment. Hoover was defeated by Franklin D. Roosevelt for the next presidential term.\n\nAt the conclusion of World War II, President Truman appointed Hoover as the coordinator of the European Food Program.

Many SAR members, along with the Color Guard of the New York Chapter of the Empire State SAR, attended. Theodore Roosevelt and Franklin D. Roosevelt’s ancestor was an original pew holder and vestryman of this church. The church’s bell, prayer book, Bible, and chalice had been secretly buried during the Revolutionary War. The bell hangs in the belfry today, and the books and chalice are displayed on special occasions.\n\nOn April 20, 1933, SAR President General Frederick W. Millspaugh and General Fries called at the White House to inform President Roosevelt that his SAR membership had been approved. Two of President Roosevelt’s sons joined the SAR as well: Colonel James Roosevelt and Congressman Franklin D. Roosevelt, Jr.\n\nOne month prior to the surrender of Germany, and less than three months after being elected to his fourth presidential term, President Roosevelt died of a cerebral hemorrhage at Warm Springs, Georgia, on April 12, 1945, at the age of sixty-three.
