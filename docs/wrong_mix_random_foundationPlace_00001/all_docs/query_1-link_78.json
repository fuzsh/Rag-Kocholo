She serves as co-chair of Columbia University Seminar “Beyond France.” She is a fellow at the New York Institute for the Humanities.

Using diplomatic correspondence and the supplication letters of the detainees, this book will show political subjectivity unfolding, not only in the world of ideas or revolutionary events or among a special class of subject, but also in the confrontation of states around often marginal subjects who transgress and, in doing so, invent political boundaries.\n\nValentina Grasso\n\nAssistant Professor of History\n\nOffice: Albee 215\n\nEmail: [email protected]\n\nAcademic Program Affiliation(s): Historical Studies, Medieval Studies\n\nBiography: Valentina Grasso comes to Bard from Catholic University of America, where she taught in the Department of Semitic and Egyptian Languages and Literatures.
