        "text": "Most presidents of the United States received a college education, even most of the earliest. Of the first seven presidents, five were college graduates. College degrees have set the presidents apart from the general population, and presidents have held degrees even though it was quite rare and unnecessary for practicing most occupations, including law. Of the 45 individuals to have been the president, 25 of them graduated from a private undergraduate college, nine graduated from a public undergraduate college, and 12 held no degree. Every president since 1953 has had a bachelor's degree, reflecting the increasing importance of higher education in the United States.\n\nGeorge Washington (Although the death of Washington's father ended his formal schooling, he received a surveyor's certificate from the College of William & Mary. Washington believed strongly in formal education, and his will left money and/or stocks to support three educational institutions, including George Washington University and Washington and Lee University)[1]\n\nJames Monroe (attended the College of William and Mary, but dropped out to fight in the Revolutionary War)\n\nAndrew Jackson\n\nMartin Van Buren\n\nWilliam Henry Harrison (attended Hampden Sydney College for three years but did not graduate and then attended University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine but never received a degree)[2][3][4]\n\nZachary Taylor\n\nMillard Fillmore (founded the University at Buffalo)\n\nAbraham Lincoln (had only about a year of formal schooling of any kind)\n\nAndrew Johnson (no formal schooling of any kind)\n\nGrover Cleveland\n\nWilliam McKinley (attended Allegheny College, but did not graduate; also attended Albany Law School, but also did not graduate)\n\nHarry S.

Bush\n\nA.^ Kennedy enrolled, but did not attend\n\nSome presidents attended more than one institution. George Washington never attended college, though The College of William & Mary did issue him a surveyor's certificate.[5] One president attended a foreign college at the undergraduate level: John Quincy Adams at Leiden University (John F. Kennedy intended to study at the London School of Economics, but failed to attend as he fell ill before classes began.) Bill Clinton won a Rhodes Scholarship, enrolling at the University of Oxford in Fall 1968, where he read for a B.Phil in politics. He left Oxford without earning a degree in order to enroll at Yale Law School.\n\nThree presidents have attended the United States Service academies: Ulysses S. Grant and Dwight D. Eisenhower graduated from the United States Military Academy at West Point, while Jimmy Carter graduated from the United States Naval Academy at Annapolis, Maryland. No presidents have graduated from the United States Coast Guard Academy or the much newer U.S. Air Force Academy. Eisenhower also graduated from the Army Command and General Staff College, Army Industrial College and Army War College. These were not degree granting institutions when Eisenhower attended, but were part of his professional education as a career soldier.\n\nA total of 20 presidents attended some form of graduate school (including professional schools). Among them, eleven presidents received a graduate degree during their lifetimes; two more received graduate degrees posthumously.\n\nSchool Location President(s) Harvard Business School Boston, Massachusetts\n\nGeorge W.

Presidents who were lawyers but did not attend law school include: John Adams; Thomas Jefferson; James Madison; James Monroe; John Quincy Adams; Andrew Jackson; Martin Van Buren; John Tyler; James K. Polk; Millard Fillmore; James Buchanan; Abraham Lincoln; James A. Garfield; Grover Cleveland; Benjamin Harrison; and Calvin Coolidge.\n\nPresidents who were admitted to the bar after a combination of law school and independent study include; Franklin Pierce; Chester A. Arthur; William McKinley; and Woodrow Wilson.\n\nSchool Location President(s) Johns Hopkins University Baltimore, Maryland\n\nWoodrow Wilson\n\nSchool Location President(s) Harvard Business School Boston, Massachusetts\n\nGeorge W.

Roosevelt\n\nNote: Hayes, Taft, Nixon and Ford were awarded LL.B. degrees.[8][9][10][11] When most U.S. law schools began to award the J.D. as the professional law degree in the 1960s, previous graduates had the choice of converting their LL.B. degrees to a J.D.[12][13] Duke University Law School made the change in 1968,[14] and Yale Law School in 1971.[15]\n\nPresidents High school or equivalent Undergraduate school Graduate school George Washington Lower Church School none none John Adams Braintree Latin School Harvard University Harvard University (A.M.)[16] Thomas Jefferson James Maury's School The College of William and Mary none James Madison Donald Robertson's School Princeton University none James Monroe Campbelltown Academy The College of William and Mary (did not graduate) none John Quincy Adams Passy Academy Leiden University (transferred)\n\nHarvard University Harvard University (A.M.)[17] Andrew Jackson William Humphries' Academy\n\nJames White Stephenson's Academy none none Martin Van Buren Kinderhook Academy\n\nWashington Seminary none none William Henry Harrison Millfield Academy Hampden–Sydney College (withdrew) University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine (withdrew) John Tyler College of William and Mary Preparatory School The College of William and Mary none James K.
