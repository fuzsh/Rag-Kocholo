        "text": "On September 8, 1974, the new president, Gerald Ford, chose to grant Nixon a full and unconditional pardon for any crimes he may have committed while president. Ford had become vice president in December 1973, after Nixon’s previous vice president, Spiro T. Agnew, resigned amid accusations of financial improprieties and pled no contest to a single, negotiated criminal charge. By the time of the pardon, enough Americans had become convinced that Nixon (named by the Watergate grand jury as an “un-indicted co-conspirator”) was guilty of crimes and that Ford had pardoned him as quid pro quo for becoming president that the approval rating of the otherwise popular new president collapsed overnight.\n\nThis loss of faith in the new chief executive spoke to the extraordinary cynicism that marked the national mood 27 months into a scandal in which a clutch of Nixon’s closest aides eventually went to jail. For the rest of the decade both popular and political culture were suffused with paranoia and disillusionment. Ronald Reagan’s ascent to the presidency in 1980 had very much to do with his rhetorical ability to break the cloud of gloom that Watergate, along with the U.S. failure in the Vietnam War, had cast upon the country. Even in the early 21st century the legacy of Watergate continued to haunt American politics. Watergate was so synonymous with scandal that it became common practice for the press to tack on a -gate to the scandal du jour, from “Tailhook-Gate” to “Troopergate.” The former president and then, after his death, his family spent a great deal of money on a legal campaign to prevent the entirety of his tapes from being released. That effort failed, and the entire taped record of the Nixon White House eventually became available to the public. Scholars continue to mine the tapes for insights, including the discovery that Nixon ordered the firebombing of the Washington, D.C., think tank the Brookings Institution (never carried out) in an attempt to remove records suggesting that he had conspired to sabotage the 1968 Paris peace talks so that his Democratic opponent in that year’s presidential election, Vice Pres. Hubert Humphrey, could not run on a record of having helped end the Vietnam War."
