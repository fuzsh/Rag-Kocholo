        "text": "SUMMARY DESCRIPTION\n\nReading copies, usually on cards and often annotated by President Ford, of over one thousand speeches, veto messages press conference statements and other prepared remarks. Supporting material (background and drafts) appear in only a few folders.\n\nQUANTITY\n\n16.8 linear feet (ca. 33,600 pages)\n\nDONOR\n\nGerald R. Ford (accession number 77-103)\n\nACCESS\n\nOpen. Some items are temporarily restricted under terms of the donor's deed of gift, a copy of which is available on request, or under National Archives and Records Administration general restrictions (36 CFR 1256).\n\nCOPYRIGHT\n\nGerald Ford donated to the United States of America his copyrights in all of his unpublished writings in National Archives collections. The copyrights to materials written by other individuals or organizations are presumed to remain with them. Works prepared by U.S. Government employees as part of their official duties are in the public domain.\n\nPrepared by Leesa Tobin, January 1982\n\n[s:\\bin\\findaid\\president's speeches and statements - reading copies.doc]\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nThis file consists almost entirely of the reading copies of President Ford's 1,051 public messages. They are arranged chronologically. Related and supporting materials appear occasionally and include preliminary drafts and, less frequently, background material.\n\nIn addition to speeches there are veto messages, legislative messages to Congress, statements accompanying bill signing, presidential proclamations, miscellaneous messages and greetings to private organizations, press conference statements and numerous, less formal \"drop-in\" remarks and talking points prepared for convenience in delivery, most public messages were prepared in large type face on large index cards. They are very often heavily annotated in his hand, especially underlining for speaking emphasis.\n\nFor the most part, however, drafts and background material on presidential speeches before November 1, 1975 are in the White House Central Files Subject File for presidential speeches (SP). Material produced after November 1, 1975 is more likely in the files of Robert Orben, Special Assistant to the President. Related material in a particular speech or remark may be found in many locations, such as the files of White House staffers with a scheduling or policy interest."
