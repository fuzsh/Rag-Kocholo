Ford and his staff between October 13, 1973 and August 9, 1974. During the first two months Ford was still House Minority Leader, but his staff decided to begin the Vice Presidential file upon nomination rather than waiting until he was sworn in. Therefore the collection documents the last few weeks of Ford's Congressional career and his eight months as Vice President.\n\nThis description of the Vice Presidential Papers consists of sections on the Ford Vice Presidency, the organization and duties of his staff, the arrangement and content of the papers, and related materials held by the Library.\n\nThe Ford Vice Presidency\n\nUpon the resignation of Vice President Spiro T. Agnew on October 10, 1973, President Richard Nixon began soliciting suggestions for a new Vice President. After only two days, he announced the nomination of Congressman Gerald R. Ford. Under the 25th Amendment to the Constitution this nomination required confirmation by both houses of Congress.\n\nEight days later President Nixon fired Watergate Special Prosecutor Archibald Cox in the \"Saturday Night Massacre.\" Attorney General Elliot Richardson and his deputy William Ruckelshaus resigned over the Cox firing. Because of the outrage over the dismissal of Archibald Cox, many members of Congress became convinced that the new Vice President would soon succeed to the Presidency. The Federal Bureau of Investigation conducted a detailed investigation of Ford's background and turned the results over to Congress. Members of Congress questioned Ford carefully and examined his record more closely than they might normally have done for one of their colleagues. The final votes in support of the Ford nomination were 92‑3 in the Senate and 387‑35 in the House. On December 6, 1973, before a joint session of Congress, Gerald Ford took the oath of office as the 40th Vice President of the United States.\n\nThe only Vice Presidential duty provided in the Constitution is serving as President of the Senate, but President Nixon soon assigned additional duties to Mr. Ford. He attended meetings of the Cabinet and National Security Council and served as Vice Chairman of the Domestic Council, Chairman of the Committee on the Right of Privacy, and Chairman of the Energy Action Group. Ford's participation in most of these organizations consisted merely of attending meetings, but under his leadership the Domestic Council Committee on the Right of Privacy began operations, hired a staff, prepared several studies, and presented proposals. The Vice President chose his former law partner from Grand Rapids, Philip Buchen, to head the Privacy Committee staff.\n\nDuring the 1974 congressional and gubernatorial campaigns, Vice President Ford served as principal party spokesman making numerous trips to assist Republican candidates for office. While Vice President, Gerald Ford represented the administration by making over 200 formal speeches and traveling approximately 110,000 miles.\n\nThe Vice President also added to his knowledge of foreign policy and intelligence matters through daily briefings from the C.I.A., regular meetings with Secretary of Defense James Schlesinger, and weekly briefings from National Security advisor Henry Kissinger or his deputy.\n\nWhile Ford was learning his new job, President Nixon's situation continued to deteriorate. In a special election on February 18, 1974, Richard Vander Veen won Ford's old House seat -- the first Democratic victory in Michigan's Fifth Congressional District in 64 years. The results of this and other special Congressional elections in the spring of 1974 weakened the President's political position.\n\nOn May 9, 1974 the House Judiciary Committee began impeachment hearings against President Nixon. Philip Buchen, unknown to Ford, soon began the planning for a Presidential transition. In late July the Judiciary Committee voted three articles of impeachment against the President. Faced with a rapidly deteriorating situation, the President resigned on August 9, 1974 and Vice President Gerald R. Ford became the 38th President of the United States.\n\nThe Ford Vice Presidential Staff\n\nUntil Gerald Ford's confirmation as Vice President on December 6, 1973, his staff consisted of the dozen or so individuals who had served him for many years as a Congressman. During the confirmation hearings several old friends and associates volunteered their assistance and President Nixon also made available the White House speechwriters and advance staff to assist Ford on trips.\n\nAfter December 6, Vice President Ford's staff grew rapidly. Three key people from his Congressional staff, Robert Hartmann, Mildred Leonard, and Paul Miltich, became Chief of Staff, Personal Assistant and Press Secretary, respectively. Later that month Ford hired William Casselman as Legal Counsel, Warren Rustand to handle scheduling and advance work, Kenneth BeLieu for legislative affairs, and Bill Roberts as Deputy Press Secretary. The military aides, several clerical and administrative people, and Walter Mote as Assistant to the President of the Senate were holdovers from the Agnew staff.\n\nVice President Ford continued to make use of the White House speechwriters and advance staff during the first two months of his Vice Presidency, but that arrangement ended after he delivered a controversial speech supporting the President to the American Farm Bureau Federation on January 15, 1974. Ford received much criticism for that speech from the media and from some of his old friends and supporters. He then created his own speechwriting staff, hiring Milton Friedman to handle the initial drafting of speeches.\n\nBy February 1974, Ford had a staff of over sixty persons and was no longer dependent on White House assistance. Richard Burress had replaced Kenneth BeLieu in handling legislative affairs and he had hired John Marsh and Gwen Anderson to handle defense matters and political liaison respectively.\n\nThe sudden growth of Ford's staff led to administrative tangles owing partly to Chief of Staff Robert Hartmann's lack of administrative experience. The Vice President decided to hire L. William Seidman of Grand Rapids to study the organization of the Vice Presidential staff and recommend improvement. Seidman's study led to the implementation of a new staff organization in the spring of 1974.\n\nUnder the new organization, the Chief of Staff handled liaison with the senior White House staff, Cabinet officers, agency heads, state governors, Congressional leadership, and the Chairman of the Republican National Committee. Hartmann also supervised personnel matters and the Vice President's personal staff, and had editorial oversight of all speeches, remarks and formal statements.\n\nThe reorganization plan divided the operational staff into three areas, each headed by an Assistant to the Vice President. Richard Burress was in charge of legislative and domestic affairs and had responsibility for liaison with the executive branch, members of Congress, and state and local government. John Marsh handled defense and international affairs, including liaison with the State Department, the Defense Department, and National Security Council, the Central Intelligence Agency, the Veterans Administration, and foreign embassies. He also supervised the work of the military assistants and had responsibility for Vice Presidential travel and logistic support. Bill Seidman assumed responsibility for administration and services. He supervised five Deputy Assistants who handled scheduling and appointments, liaison with the Republican party and other non‑governmental organizations, administration, media affairs, and research.\n\nThe Ford Vice Presidential Papers\n\nBecause Ford remained a Congressman until December 6, the organization of the Ford papers did not immediately change. His secretaries continued to file most correspondence and other documents in the General and Case File and the Issues File. As had always been the case, Robert Hartmann and Paul Miltich maintained separate files relating to their areas of responsibility.\n\nAfter January 1, 1974, the staff divided the General and Case File into the General File and the Case/Individual File and seven other staff members established separate files. The General File, the Issues File and the Case/Individual File served as a \"central files\" for much of the routine correspondence. The staff files contain working papers and correspondence relating to the specific responsibilities of each staff member. In addition, the Vice Presidential papers originally included approximately 53 linear feet of public opinion mail including correspondence answered by form and letters never answered. The Ford Library has retained a small sample of this public opinion mail and disposed of the rest.\n\nThe Vice Presidential papers document in detail the work of Gerald Ford and his staff in answering mail, handling constituent casework, scheduling and advancing trips, speechwriting, handling administrative and personnel matters, relating with Republican party organizations, campaigning for Republican candidates, meeting with foreign and diplomatic officials, and liaison with the Congress. There is little here to document the less public aspects of the Vice Presidency such as the many briefings received by Ford, his meetings with President Nixon, or the meetings of the Domestic Council, the Cabinet, the National Security Council or other bodies on which Ford served. Little material on the Watergate investigations and impeachment appears, with the exception of public opinion in correspondence, references in speeches, and occasional items in the staff files.\n\nThe Michigan Historical Collections of the University of Michigan received five cubic feet of Vice Presidential Papers from Gerald Ford in 1974, as part of a large shipment of Congressional Papers. The University transferred these materials to the Ford Library under terms of the Ford letter of gift to the U.S. Government in 1977. The Library received the rest of the Vice Presidential Papers directly from President Ford.\n\nRelated Materials (February 1995)\n\nThe Ford Scrapbook Collection includes three volumes of newspaper clippings, programs and occasional documents concerning his activities during the Vice Presidency. John Marsh's White House files contain a small file of Ford's schedules and telephone logs from late July and early August 1974. The Robert Hartmann Papers contain 4.4 linear feet of additional materials from the Vice Presidency. Barry Roth's unprocessed White House files contain his chronological file for the Vice Presidency and Executive Protective Service appointment records for the Vice President's office.\n\nThe Betty Ford Papers include her correspondence and other papers relating to her activities in 1973 and 1974 while her husband served as Vice President. Only selected portions of that collection are open to research yet, however.\n\nSignificant quantities of audiovisual materials and gifts and memorabilia from the Vice Presidency can be found in the appropriate units of the Ford Library and Museum. The Ford Library book collection has The New York Times, Newsweek, Time, U.S. News and World Report, Fortune, and the National Journal on microfilm for all or part of the Ford Vice Presidency. A vertical file of clippings, pamphlets, magazine articles and other material on Ford's career is also available.\n\nSERIES DESCRIPTIONS\n\nCorrespondence Control (Index) File, 1973-74. (Boxes 1-9, 3.6 linear feet)\n\nThe Control File consists of carbon copies of all outgoing letters arranged alphabetically by name of the correspondent. The file location of the complete correspondence is written in the upper right-hand corner.\n\nThis file indexes all mail individually answered by Vice President Ford or his staff, but does not index mail answered with a form letter or unanswered mail. In addition, it does not index letters of congratulations received by Ford upon his nomination and confirmation (some are in the General File and others in the Public Opinion Mail).\n\nBefore January 1974, the staff filed constituent casework in the General File. They did not change any of the control sheets when they removed the case files and made them into a separate series. When the Ford Library received the Vice Presidential Papers, there were separate control files for 1973 and 1974. Archivists combined these two sequences during processing.\n\nThe Ford Library staff has not reviewed this file. For that reason researchers should consult with an archivist to arrange for the review of those sections they wish to use.\n\nCompiled by William McNitt, December 1979\n\nIssues File, 1973‑74. (Boxes 10-22, 5.2 linear feet)\n\nThe Issues File contains correspondence between Ford and his staff, the general public, and government officials on a variety of topics concerning the Federal government. Among the larger files are defense, the economy, health, labor, social security, and taxes. The Multiple Issues segment contains correspondence on more than one subject. The Presidential file consists entirely of correspondence in support of or against President Nixon. The Vice Presidential Endorsement file contains letters to Congressman Peter Rodino and Senator Howard Cannon from other Congressmen and labor and religious leaders endorsing Ford for Vice President.\n\nStaff members drafted acknowledgments to the correspondence for the Vice President's signature. On occasions when Ford was out of town, various staff members signed the responses. The staff referred many letters to other Federal departments and agencies to draft a response for the Vice President's signature. The series is arranged alphabetically by subject.\n\nCompiled by Kenneth G. Hafeli, December 1979\n\nCase/Individual File, 1973‑74. (Boxes 23-36, 5.6 linear feet)\n\nThe bulk of this file consists of routine requests by constituents for assistance in dealing with government agencies, along with the responses from the Ford office and the agencies. The requestors asked the Vice President to intervene in cases involving missing or incorrect pension or social security checks, attempts to qualify for medical and education benefits, personnel matters (especially in the armed services), and other problems.\n\nAlso included in this file are occasional unanswered letters concerning matters other than casework. Apparently the staff filed such letters in this series when no appropriate category could be found in the General File or the Issues File.\n\nThis file is arranged alphabetically by the name of the person needing assistance or, in the case of the unanswered letters, by the name of the correspondent. The Ford Library has not reviewed this file. For that reason researchers should consult with an archivist to arrange for the review of those segments they wish to use.\n\nCompiled by William McNitt, November 1979\n\nGeneral File, 1973‑74. (Boxes 37-58, 8.8 linear feet)\n\nThe General File served as a central file for correspondence between Ford (or his staff), the public, and government officials on topics of a routine nature. While the staff handled much of the material, the Vice President or his personal assistant Mildred Leonard dealt with correspondence from personal acquaintances. This series also contains correspondence and reports concerning organizations to which the Vice President belonged by statute, among them the Domestic Council Committee on the Right of Privacy, the Board of Regents of the Smithsonian Institution, and the U.S. Capitol Historical Society.\n\nAmong the larger files in the series are those concerning Vice Presidential appearances, congratulatory messages to and from the Vice President, greetings, staff positions, recommendations, Republican campaigns, requests for autographs and photographs, and thank you letters. The General File is an amalgam of a smaller subject file, the Ford Personal File, and the Vice Presidential Official File. It is arranged alphabetically by subject.\n\nCompiled by Kenneth G. Hafeli, December 1979\n\nOffice of the Assistant for Defense and International Affairs: John O. Marsh Files, 1973‑74. (Boxes 59-71 & 206, 5.2 linear feet)\n\nThe Assistant for Defense and International Affairs was John O. Marsh, a former Congressman from Virginia and Assistant Secretary of Defense. He joined the Ford staff on January 29, 1974, and remained until moving to the White House staff in August.\n\nMarsh's duties included collecting and evaluating information concerning national security, maintaining classified materials, supervising travel and logistics, and monitoring defense and foreign affairs legislation in Congress. In addition, his office served as liaison to the Departments of Defense and State, the National Security Council, the intelligence community, the Veterans Administration, international organizations, foreign missions resident in Washington, and foreign visitors. The Vice President's military aides also worked out of this office, handling much of the routine work such as drafting replies to correspondence.\n\nThe materials consist of correspondence, speeches, personnel files, briefing materials concerning foreign affairs and diplomatic visits, schedules, programs, flight manifests and itineraries, and billing records. They are organized in six subseries: Subject File, Chronological File, Meetings with Foreign and Diplomatic Officials, Vice Presidential Events, Thank You Letters for Vice Presidential Trips, and Trip File.\n\nCompiled by Kenneth G. Hafeli, September 1979\n\nJohn Marsh Subject File, 1973‑74. (Boxes 59‑64, 2.2 linear feet)\n\nCorrespondence, memoranda, speeches and resumes, relating to defense issues and military and foreign affairs, including the Central Intelligence Agency, National Guard and Reserve Affairs, Korea, MIA‑POW, Vice Presidential Correspondence and Vice Presidential Remarks.\n\nArranged alphabetically by subject.\n\nJohn Marsh Chronological File, 1973‑74. (Box 64, 0.2 linear feet)\n\nCarbon copies of outgoing correspondence and memoranda, written by Marsh or his military aides, with an occasional incoming letter or background item attached.\n\nArranged chronologically.\n\nJohn Marsh File of Vice Presidential Meetings with Foreign and Diplomatic Officials, 1973‑74. (Box 65, 0.4 linear feet)\n\nMemorandums of conversations, memos, and briefing materials related to meetings between Ford and foreign heads of state, diplomats, and ambassadors. Most of the material deals with foreign affairs, with only a small amount concerning domestic affairs appearing.\n\nArranged chronologically.\n\nView container list for this series\n\nJohn Marsh File of Vice Presidential Events, 1973‑74. (Boxes 66‑67, 0.6 linear feet)\n\nBriefing memos, schedules, and occasional correspondence relating to requests for and preparations involving appearances made by the Vice President.\n\nArranged chronologically.\n\nJohn Marsh File of Thank You Letters for Vice Presidential Trips, 1973‑74. (Boxes 67‑68, 0.6 linear feet)\n\nLists of persons to be thanked for their assistance on Vice Presidential trips, carbon copies of letters sent, and an occasional program from a particular event.\n\nArranged chronologically by date of trip.\n\nJohn Marsh Trip File, 1973‑74. (Boxes 69‑71, 1.2 linear feet)\n\nSchedules, passenger lists, flight manifests, flight itineraries, briefing notes, news media billings, in flight expense forms, seating chart from trips made by the Vice President, and correspondence to media organizations requesting reimbursement for passage aboard Air Force II.\n\nArranged chronologically by date of trip.\n\nOffice of the Assistant for Legislative and Domestic Affairs: Richard T. Burress Files, 1974. (Boxes 72-73, 0.8 Feet)\n\nRichard T. Burress joined the Vice President's staff to handle legislative and domestic affairs in February 1974, replacing Kenneth E. BeLieu. After Ford became President, Burress served as an assistant to Vice President designate Rockefeller until November 1, 1974, when he returned to the Hoover Institution as associate director and senior Fellow.\n\nBurress' primary duties were collecting and independently evaluating information on domestic issues from Congress, the Executive Branch, state and local governments, and boards, committees, and commissions with which the Vice President was associated. He appears to have assembled much of the material to help Ford respond to questions or expressions of opinion from members of the public.\n\nMaterials include correspondence, copies of letters sent by the Vice President, internal memoranda, proposals, pamphlets, statements of purpose, briefing papers, and printed materials on such topics as health care, the role of minorities, energy, the economy, and administrative matters. The papers are arranged alphabetically by subject.\n\nThe files of assistant to the President of the Senate, Walter Mote, and the legal counsel for the Vice President, William Casselman, contain related materials.\n\nCompiled by Christine Ferretti, May 1979\n\nOffice of the Legal Counsel: William E. Casselman Files, 1973‑74. (Boxes 74-99, 10 linear feet)\n\nWilliam E. Casselman joined the Vice Presidential staff in December 1973 after serving as general counsel for the General Services Administration since 1971. Casselman served as legal adviser throughout Ford's tenure as Vice President. He then became Counsel to the President in the Ford White House. His staff during the Vice Presidency consisted of legal assistant Barry Roth and staff assistant Brenda Wilson. This office advised Ford on questions of administrative and fiscal law, including personnel regulations, security, archival procedures, appropriations authority, standards of conduct, litigation, and recommendations on appointments to the federal judiciary.\n\nCasselman also shared responsibility with Richard Burress, Assistant for Legislative and Domestic Affairs, for domestic policy analysis and provided support to Ford in his role as vice chairman of the Domestic Council. Casselman coordinated issue development within the Domestic Council, helped resolve policy differences between federal agencies and the Council and assisted the Vice President in developing and addressing issues of interest. The office acted as liaison between departments and agencies and the Vice President on domestic policy, providing a source of information and analysis independent of the Domestic Council.\n\nThese files reflect Casselman's responsibilities for providing the Vice President with legal services and advice on domestic policy issues. A subject file documents his work on privacy legislation, employee standards of conduct, energy problems, American Indian rights and similar issues that the Vice President addressed. The official correspondence file contains copies of outgoing correspondence and information on the daily operations of the office, personnel changes and other matters of secondary importance. There is considerable overlap and duplication in the two series. A third series contains photocopies from General Services Administration office files concerning purchases of office furniture in certain GSA regions.\n\nOther papers on domestic policy issues during the Vice Presidential period may be found in the files of the Assistant to the Vice President for Legislative and Domestic Affairs and in the various Domestic Council collections of the Presidential period. The files of Chief of Staff Robert Hartmann contain extensive information on Ford's confirmation hearings.\n\nCompiled by Paul Conway, September 1979\n\nWilliam Casselman Subject File, 1973‑74. (Boxes 74‑88, 5.8 linear feet)\n\nCorrespondence and memoranda to and from Vice Presidential staff, federal officials and the public; draft speeches and reports, studies, court cases and other papers reflecting Casselman's responsibilities for providing legal advice on administrative policy matters. Also included are materials on Casselman's activities concerning domestic policy, including drafting legislation on health, energy and personal privacy. Carbon copies of some outgoing memoranda and correspondence also appear in the official correspondence series.\n\nArranged alphabetically by subject.\n\nWilliam Casselman Official Correspondence, 1973‑74. (Boxes 88‑93, 2.0 linear feet)\n\nCopies of outgoing correspondence and memoranda with attached reports and draft replies; printed materials, notes and other papers exchanged between Casselman and Ford, federal officials, assistants and the public concerning routine administrative matters, scheduling and domestic policy issues such as energy, American Indians and sports. Also included is information on personnel changes, Vice Presidential archives, standards of conduct, privacy and other legal matters. Much of the material is unique to this series, but duplicate correspondence, memoranda and reports are also in the subject file. Cross-reference headings typed in the upper right corner of covering letters are supposed to indicate subject file locations for the full correspondence, but the system is generally unreliable.\n\nArranged chronologically.\n\nWilliam Casselman GSA Furniture Purchases File, 1970-73. (Boxes 93‑98, 2.2 linear feet)\n\nCopies of correspondence, supply, requisition and bidding forms, contracts and other papers retained in Casselman's files after Ford's confirmation hearings. The material primarily relates to purchases of Steelcase, Inc. furniture and office supplies for placement in various General Services Administration regional facilities and in Ford's congressional l district offices. Also included is some general correspondence with GSA on furniture purchases and supply requisition.\n\nArranged alphabetically by subject.\n\nOffice of the Assistant to the President of the Senate: Walter L. Mote Files, 1973‑74. (Boxes 100-107, 3.2 linear feet)\n\nWalter L. Mote, Assistant to the President of the Senate, was a carry‑over from the staff of Vice President Spiro T. Agnew. He remained on the Vice Presidential staff until January 1975, when he retired from government service. His staff consisted of H. Spofford Canfield, Josephine Wilson, and several secretaries.\n\nThis office handled legislative mail, compiled twice daily briefing sheets on Congressional activity, maintained records for Vice Presidential scheduling, fulfilled autograph and photograph requests, and arranged White House tours. They also kept the Speaker of the House, Architect of the Capitol, and other Congressional officials informed of Ford's activities in his role as President of the Senate and notified Senators and Congressmen of Vice Presidential visits to their home districts.\n\nMote's subject file contains correspondence from Senators and Congressmen, morning and evening reports on the activities of the Senate, and referrals on correspondence sent to the Vice President concerning other departments and agencies. His case file contains constituent correspondence dealing with a variety of subjects.\n\nVice Presidential schedules are also located in the files of L. William Seidman and Warren S. Rustand. The files of the Assistant for Legislative and Domestic Affairs concern contacts with Congress on specific issues. Later material on activities related to the Congress can be found in the White House files of Max Friedersdorf.\n\nCompiled by Kenneth G. Hafeli, September 1979\n\nWalter Mote Subject File, 1973‑74. (Boxes 100‑103, 1.6 linear feet)\n\nCorrespondence, invitations, requests for endorsements, appointments, autographs, and photographs; referrals from various departments and agencies, drafts of correspondence, daily reports on House proceedings, morning and evening reports, and the Vice President's daily schedule. The material covers a variety of subjects, including condolences, congratulations, education, energy, housing, social security, and veterans affairs.\n\nArranged alphabetically.\n\nWalter Mote Case File, 1973‑74. (Boxes 104‑107, 1.6 linear feet)\n\nCorrespondence relating to requests for assistance in dealing with government agencies or requests for information. Mote's staff did much of the case work rather than referring it to government agencies for a response.\n\nArranged alphabetically.\n\nOffice of the Assistant for Administration and Services: L. William Seidman Files, 1973‑74. (Boxes 108-116, 3.6 linear feet)\n\nL. William Seidman joined the Vice President's staff in February 1974 as a management and budget consultant. In this capacity he studied the organization of the Vice President's staff and proposed changes to improve operating procedures. He later became the Assistant for Administration and Services. Seidman served for the remainder of the Vice Presidency and then became Assistant for Economic Affairs to President Ford.\n\nUnder Seidman's supervision, five deputy assistants and their staffs organized both the daily operations of the Vice President's office and contacts between the Vice President and the public. The office provided all administrative services for Ford, from drafting responses to maintaining the active \"follow‑up\" file of correspondence and projects to be completed. Frank Pagnotta organized these activities and oversaw staff personnel actions. James Brown and Frank Townsend maintained the gift files. Warren Rustand handled scheduling, appointments and advance work for Ford's travels. Gwen Anderson organized the Vice President's contacts with political and other non‑government organizations. Seidman also supervised Paul Miltich's media relations work and Milton Friedman's research activities.\n\nThese files contain correspondence, memoranda, speech drafts, gift lists, charts and other papers exchanged between Seidman and the Vice President, other federal officials and the public relating both to his supervision of administrative services, scheduling policy, personnel, and gift accessioning and to his personal interests in the nation's economy and speechwriting. Included are the chronological file of staff assistant Ruth Kilmer and materials compiled by Pagnotta, Brown and Townsend, some of which pre‑date Seidman's government service. The series is arranged alphabetically by subject.\n\nThe separate files of the various deputy assistants contain related materials, as do Seidman's White House files.\n\nCompiled by Paul Conway, September 1979\n\nOffice of the Deputy Assistant for Non‑Governmental Organizations: Gwen Anderson Files, 1974. (Boxes 117-126, 4.0 linear feet)\n\nGwen O. Anderson, a former Republican National Committeewoman from the state of Washington, joined the Vice President's staff as consultant for public affairs in January 1974. In July she became deputy assistant for non‑governmental organizations, but there was no change in her duties.\n\nAnderson's major function was to coordinate the Vice President's appearances at political events and fundraisers. All requests for political appearances were forwarded to Anderson by the scheduling office for her recommendation. She took part in the weekly scheduling meetings and coordinated with Warren Rustand's office the arrangements for events of a political nature. Anderson also served as liaison with Republican group, city, state and county officials, and other political organizations and handled requests for messages, autographs, photographs, and fundraising auction items. When Ford became President, she continued to perform these duties, first as an assistant to Dean Burch and later to Robert Hartmann.\n\nThe papers contain correspondence with Republican groups and candidates concerning invitations, schedules, thank yous, evaluations of events, requests for messages, endorsements, or items to auction. Documents on fundraising affairs include information on contributions to the party, the success of events, and arrangements for ensuring the Republican National Committee a share of the proceeds.\n\nOther materials include copies of speeches, messages and political tributes, background information on organizations, minutes of scheduling meetings, intra‑office administrative memoranda, and an analysis of the special election held in the Fifth District of Michigan to fill Ford's congressional seat. The papers are divided into four series: subject file, chronological file, speech file, and state events file.\n\nThe Vice Presidential files of Warren Rustand, Paul Miltich, and William Seidman contain related materials.\n\nCompiled by Christine Ferretti, May 1979\n\nGwen Anderson Subject File, 1974. (Boxes 117‑121, 1.9 linear feet)\n\nCorrespondence, memoranda, telegrams, meeting minutes, newsletters, reports, press releases, schedules, briefing papers, and printed materials concerning political groups, Republican fundraising activities, events such as the Bicentennial or Honor America Day, and the mechanics of scheduling Vice Presidential appearances. The file reflects her liaison work with political organizations through background information on organizations, reports on the progress of fundraising, or responses to requests for messages, photographs, or items to auction. The scheduling files largely concern invitations regretted and the process of creating the schedule. Information on events that the Vice President attended is found in the State Events File.\n\nArranged alphabetically by subject.\n\nGwen Anderson Chronological File, 1974. (Boxes 121‑122, 0.2 linear feet)\n\nCopies of outgoing correspondence signed by Anderson or the Vice President including messages to organizations, thank you letters, acknowledgment of comments on issues, and regrets of invitations. The file is interspersed with occasional internal memoranda.\n\nArranged chronologically.\n\nGwen Anderson File of Ford Speeches, 1974. (Box 122, 0.3 linear feet)\n\nCopies of Ford speeches. Most are in press release form, but a few are copies of reading copies. Occasional ones bear annotations showing changes made during delivery. This is not a complete file of all speeches and most were given to non‑political rather than political organizations.\n\nArranged chronologically.\n\nGwen Anderson State Events File, 1974. (Boxes 123‑126, 1.5 linear feet)\n\nCorrespondence, memoranda, notes, schedules, newspaper clippings and other material related to political events attended by the Vice President. Topics include arrangements for Ford appearances, the Republican National Committee share of fundraising proceeds, evaluations and comments on Ford speeches and activities, the political situation in the state visited, pending or actual political appointments, and other similar topics. The series contains some files on trips canceled or rearranged after Ford became President.\n\nArranged alphabetically by state and thereunder chronologically.\n\nOffice of the Deputy Assistant for Media Affairs: Paul A. Miltich Files, 1973‑74. (Boxes 127-173, 18.8 linear feet)\n\nFormerly a Washington correspondent for Booth Newspapers, a Michigan newspaper chain, Miltich joined the Ford Congressional staff as press secretary in 1966, succeeding James M. Mudge. Miltich continued to serve as Ford's press secretary throughout the Vice Presidency and then became an Assistant Press Secretary in the Ford White House.\n\nMiltich and his assistant, John W. \"Bill\" Roberts, were responsible for compiling background material, preparing speech drafts, releasing information to the press, answering inquiries and requests from the public, and mailing copies of Vice Presidential speeches to those who requested them.\n\nThe office coordinated efforts with Chief of Staff Robert Hartmann's speechwriters and Warren Rustand's scheduling office. The latter provided long and short range schedules of the Vice President's upcoming activities and assured that Miltich's office provided suitable remarks and statements when necessary. Miltich also participated in weekly scheduling meetings.\n\nThe materials consist of speeches and remarks made by the Vice President, correspondence, background material, articles written for or about Ford or his staff, press releases, drafts, printed materials, and requests for invitations to the Vice President to attend various functions. They are divided into four series: speech file, subject file, speech materials file, and publication file.\n\nRelated materials may be found in the files of the Deputy Assistant for Scheduling and Advance (Rustand) and the Chief of Staff (Hartmann) in the Vice Presidential files. Miltich's files in the Congressional papers and the files of Ron Nessen and his staff in the Presidential papers also contain related material.\n\nCompiled by Kenneth G. Hafeli, December 1979\n\nPaul Miltich File of Ford Speeches, 1973‑74. (Boxes 127‑135, 3.6 linear feet)\n\nSpeech drafts, reading copies, and printed copies of speeches made by Ford, including his remarks upon becoming Vice President and later President, plus miscellaneous brochures and press releases. The collection of speeches is quite extensive although comparison with the Rustand speech file shows that it is not complete.\n\nArranged chronologically.\n\nView container list for this series\n\nPaul Miltich Subject File, 1973‑74. (Boxes 136‑169, 13.6 linear feet)\n\nCorrespondence, articles written for or about the Vice President or his staff, drafts of letters and form letters used both by Ford and Spiro Agnew, Nixon press releases, White House News Summaries, invitations and responses, some public opinion mail, and requests for Vice Presidential items, such as autographs and photographs. Major topics include appearances, budget, congratulations, defense, form letter drafts, economy, elections, energy, labor, regrets, requests, White House news summaries and press releases.\n\nArranged alphabetically by subject.\n\nPaul Miltich Speech Materials File, 1973‑74. (Boxes 170‑172, 1.2 linear feet)\n\nCopies of speeches by various speakers, newspaper clippings, magazine articles, programs and books, dating from the mid‑60's, that Ford's speechwriters used as source material for speeches. Topics include business, commerce, humor, Abraham Lincoln and Republican Party.\n\nArranged alphabetically by subject.\n\nPaul Miltich Publications File, 1971-74. (Box 173, 0.4 linear feet)\n\nNewsletters, newspapers, periodicals, brochures, clippings, and press releases sent either to Ford or to Paul Miltich by the public or acquaintances.\n\nArranged chronologically.\n\nOffice of the Deputy Assistant for Scheduling and Appointments: Warren S. Rustand Files, 1973‑74. (Boxes 174-205, 12.8 linear feet)\n\nBefore Mr. Ford's confirmation as Vice President, Mildred Leonard handled his schedule. Dewey Clower served briefly in this role after the confirmation, but Lt. Col. Americo Sardo replaced him. Warren Rustand joined the Ford staff on December 18, 1973, as an assistant to Sardo, and became Deputy Assistant for Scheduling and Appointments on February 1, 1974. In August 1974, Rustand moved to the White House as Appointments Secretary to the President.\n\nThe scheduling office formulated both long-range and short-range schedules for all events and appointments. They handled, on the average, 75 written requests and 150 phone calls per day. By April 8, 1974, the Vice President had met over 1,000 office appointments, delivered 60 speeches, convened 35 press conferences and traveled over 35,000 miles.\n\nRustand coordinated some requests with other Vice Presidential staff, including political requests with Gwen Anderson, personal friend and family requests with Mildred Leonard, VIP Congressional and Cabinet requests with Dorothy Downton, and media requests with Paul Miltich. Those taking part in weekly scheduling meetings were Robert Hartmann, Bill Seidman, Walter Motes, and Jack Marsh, along with Leonard, Miltich, Anderson, and Rustand.\n\nAfter an event gained a spot on the schedule, the advance team took over. This team consisted of the scheduling director, advancemen, White House Communications Agency, Secret Service, military aide, transportation, and local contacts. Their job was to move an event from conception to execution, including the preparation of a detailed final schedule. In the early months, before this office was fully organized, the White House Advance Office handled preparations for trips.\n\nThe files generally cover the period of Rustand's Vice Presidential service, with occasional earlier items. They reflect the work of the scheduling and advance operation and contain memoranda, correspondence, schedules, forms, invitations, regret letters, and other materials.\n\nRelated materials include the Vice Presidential files of L. William Seidman, Gwen Anderson, Robert Hartmann, and the White House Advance Office.\n\nCompiled by Dennis M. Lakomy, October 1979\n\nWarren Rustand Subject Series, 1973‑74. (Boxes 174‑179, 2.5 linear feet)\n\nMemoranda, correspondence, schedules, forms, agendas, handwritten notes, lists and miscellany. These materials illustrate the day to day operations of the scheduling and advance office, including the formulation of schedules, logistical planning for events, and administrative operations. The Scheduling Operation and Personnel folder contains documents describing the operation in detail.\n\nArranged alphabetically.\n\nWarren Rustand Regrets ‑ Chronological File, 1973-75. (Boxes 180‑190, 4.6 linear feet)\n\nInvitations, many having a carbon copy of a regret letter signed by Rustand, or occasionally signed by Ford, Mildred Leonard, Gwen Anderson, or other staff. Occasional memoranda, birth announcements, and other related materials.\n\nArranged chronologically by date of the event.\n\nWarren Rustand Regrets ‑ Group/Occasion File, 1973‑74. (Boxes 191‑192, 0.8 linear feet)\n\nCarbon copies of Vice Presidential regret letters, and very occasionally acceptance and pending letters. The actual letter of invitation appears in Regrets ‑ Chronological.\n\nArranged alphabetically by name of group or occasion.\n\nWarren Rustand Events File, 1973-75. (Boxes 193‑205, 5.4 linear feet)\n\nInvitations, endorsements, letters of acceptance and thanks, other correspondence, memoranda, schedules, handwritten notes, programs, background material, and related items concerning scheduling and advance work for Ford's appearances at events. Included are materials for acceptances made for events canceled or reevaluated when Ford became President.\n\nArranged chronologically by date of the event; some events are in individual folders.\n\nPublic Opinion Mail Files, 1973‑74. (Boxes 207-212, 2.4 linear feet)\n\nThe Ford Library originally received approximately 53 linear feet of public opinion mail. This form response mail and unanswered mail included letters, telegrams, post cards, clippings, annual reports, brochures and other types of printed material. Because of the large amount of material involved and its lack of research value, the Ford Library staff surveyed these files for disposal, retaining only a sample of 2.4 linear feet for research. Detailed records of the Library's survey of the public opinion mail are available.\n\nThe sample files retained are from the form response mail category. The staff acknowledged the earliest mail, congratulating Ford on his nomination and commenting on other issues, on minority leader stationery. Transition mail, which followed Ford's confirmation as Vice President, contained more congratulatory messages and correspondence related to other issues. In January 1974, the Vice President's staff instituted a third system, the \"F‑Number Handling System\". Ranging from F‑0 to F‑31, the forms responded to correspondence on such topics as service academy nominations, energy, President Nixon, and eagle scout awards.\n\nThe unanswered mail consisted of material similar in nature to the form response mail. However, it remained unacknowledged due to insufficient or illegible address, or the writer's anonymity. Because of its similarity with form response mail, the Ford Library disposed of the unacknowledged mail in its entirety.\n\nCompiled by Kenneth G. Hafeli, May 1980\n\nNewspaper Clippings, 1973. (Boxes 213-217, 2.0 linear feet)\n\nThis file of newspaper clippings mainly concerns Gerald Ford's nomination as Vice President on October 12, 1973 and the confirmation hearings conducted by the Congress. A clipping service supplied most of the clippings, but Ford's staff apparently added others. When the Ford Library received this series, the containers bore the words \"Duplicate Newspaper Clippings,\" so presumably most or all appear in the Ford scrapbooks.\n\nCompiled by William McNitt, May 1980\n\nOffice of the Chief of Staff: Robert T. Hartmann Files, 1973‑74. (Boxes 218-258, 16.4 linear feet)\n\nLong‑time congressional aide Robert Hartmann coordinated Gerald R. Ford's preparations for the vice presidential confirmation hearings in the fall of 1973 and subsequently became Chief of Staff to Vice President Ford. As Chief of Staff, Hartmann's duties consisted mainly of the following:\n\nLiaison with the White House Senior Staff, Cabinet Officers, agency heads, State Governors, the Leadership of Congress, and the Chairmen of the Republican National Committee and the Republican Senatorial and Congressional Campaign Committees.\n\nOverall supervision of the staff with respect to duty and space requirements; review and approval of all cases of employment, separation or change in pay; security and conflict of interest clearances; grievances and complaints against staff members or voiced by them; approval of arrangements for persons detailed to the staff or volunteering assistance; and direct supervision of the Vice President's personal staff.\n\nEditorial oversight of the preparation of drafts of speeches, remarks, and formal statements by the Vice President.\n\nThe files document his Hartmann's work as Vice Presidential Chief of Staff and his work on the Vice Presidential confirmation hearings. The file of staff memoranda details many of his interactions with members of the staff. Included in the subject file are letters he drafted for Ford, briefing materials for meetings, and materials on specific issues, politics, Ford speeches, and the organization and operation of the Vice President's staff. There is little documentation on Watergate or on Ford's transition to the presidency.\n\nFord Confirmation Hearings Files\n\nOn October 10, 1973, Vice President Spiro T. Agnew resigned from office. Under investigation for multiple charges of alleged conspiracy, extortion and bribery, Agnew agreed to resign, pleading nolo contendere to a single charge of federal income tax evasion. Two days later, President Richard M. Nixon nominated Gerald Ford to become the 40th vice president of the United States.\n\nFord was the first vice president selected under the provisions of the Twenty‑fifth Amendment to the Constitution, ratified in 1967. The Amendment governs presidential and vice presidential succession and stipulates that whenever the office of vice president becomes vacant through death, succession to the presidency or resignation, the president shall nominate a vice president to be confirmed by a majority vote of both houses of Congress.\n\nProcedural questions arose concerning which committee would handle the nomination in each chamber. The House decided that the Committee on the Judiciary, chaired by Peter Rodino (D‑N.J.), would have jurisdiction; the Senate chose the Committee on Rules and Administration, chaired by Howard Cannon (D‑Nevada). They held separate hearings. Senate proceedings began on November 1, continued for two weeks and ended with a vote to confirm on November 27. The hearings in the House opened on November 15, and that chamber voted to approve the nomination on December 6, 1973.\n\nHartmann helped Ford to prepare for the committee hearings. The Ford staff pulled together facts, figures and explanatory documents relating to anticipated questions in the hearings. In addition, they responded to queries from committee investigators and provided them with information from office files. As indicated in his book Palace Politics, however, Hartmann felt his most important duty was drafting Ford's opening statements to the committees.\n\nOn what Ford and Hartmann informally called the \"confirmation team,\" only two individuals, Hartmann and Paul Miltich, Ford's press secretary, were paid staff members. The volunteer members of the team were old friends and people who had worked with Ford previously -- Benton Becker, Philip Buchen, Kenneth BeLieu, Richard Burress, William Cramer, Richard Haber, and Robert Hynes.\n\nThe \"confirmation team\" thoroughly searched Ford's congressional office files and removed items that might be needed for reference in the hearings. They arranged the material into a general reference subject file and a campaign finance file and used those files to compile a briefing book for Ford's use at the witness table. This briefing book evolved into a loose‑leaf binder indexed by questions that committee members might ask with suggestions for appropriate replies. Ford's personal copy of the book, with his annotations, and the general subject and campaign finance files became a part of Hartmann's files. The confirmation series also include materials created during the confirmation hearings. These include correspondence with the House and Senate committee chairmen and members, working drafts of anticipated questions and recommended answers, and reference material and working drafts used in writing Ford's opening statements.\n\nThe House Judiciary Committee requested a compilation of all communications, written and oral, received by executive departments and independent agencies form 1970 to 1973, from Congressman Ford, his staff, or his representatives. A duplicate set of this correspondence appears in the Hartmann files.\n\nHartmann personally created only a small amount of material within this file in the course of the confirmation hearings. Most of it consists of material removed from Ford's congressional office files and drawn together for reference use by the confirmation team.\n\nHartmann kept these files in his office until the end of the Ford presidency. He then relinquished this material, along with his congressional and White House files, to the Ford Library under the Ford deed of gift. Hartmann also donated a collection of personal papers to the Hoover Institution at Stanford University, his alma mater. In 1992, the Hoover Institution transferred that collection to the Ford Library. It contains 4.4 linear feet of material concerning the Ford Vice Presidency. Some additional information on the Ford confirmation hearings as Vice President is available in the papers of Congressman Edward Hutchinson, ranking Republican on the House Judiciary Committee at the time of the hearings.\n\nCompiled by Leesa Tobin, April 1982\n\nRobert Hartmann Personnel File, 1973‑74. (Boxes 218‑221, 1.5 linear feet)\n\nPrimarily routine memoranda from the Nixon White House Personnel Office to Ford for his information or comment on proposed Presidential appointments to various executive branch positions.

(Boxes 222‑223, 0.8 linear feet)\n\nMemoranda from vice presidential staff to the Vice President, Hartmann, and others; with supporting correspondence and other items. Accumulated by Hartmann as the Vice President's chief of staff, they concern such diverse matters as: office housekeeping, scheduling, trips, legal questions, the press, and political affairs.\n\nArranged by name of staff member originating the memoranda and subdivided thereunder into memoranda to Hartmann and memoranda to others.\n\nRobert Hartmann Subject File, 1973‑74. (Boxes 224‑234, 5.0 linear feet)\n\nHartmann's copies of staff memoranda to the Vice President and others; correspondence with congressmen, government and party officials, constituents, and others; form letters and odd newsletters received; background material for meetings, trips and social functions; White House press releases; speech texts; weekly Domestic Council issue summaries from Cole; and miscellaneous printed and other matter. Much of it was sent to Hartmann for his information and not for action. Subjects reflect, in greater breadth than depth, concerns on political, housekeeping, scheduling, policy, courtesy, and personnel matters. Many files contain only a single item.\n\nArranged alphabetically by subject.\n\nRobert Hartmann File of Summaries of Congressional Proceedings, 1973‑74. (Boxes 235‑236, 0.8 linear feet)\n\nMemoranda from Legislative Assistant Josephine Wilson summarizing daily proceedings in the House of Representatives. Selected speeches, new legislation, conference reports, status of bills pending, and House Speaker Carl Albert's press conferences are all briefly summarized. Also included is one folder of similar information on floor action in the Senate, compiled by Spofford Canfield.\n\nArranged chronologically.\n\nFord Confirmation Hearings Briefing Book File, 1973. (Box 237, 0.4 linear feet)\n\nMaterials compiled by Philip Buchen and Benton Becker, arranged in a loose‑leaf notebook format and indexed to help Ford in answering committee members' questions. For preservation reasons, archivists removed the documents from their plastic covers. The arrangement has been maintained, however, with the table of contents located in the first folder of the series. The format for each of the subsequent subject designations is the same: the anticipated question or allegation is presented, a factual analysis provided and the position Ford was to take outlined.\n\nIncluded are supportive exhibits that Ford could provide to the committee. Mr. Ford annotated much of this material. Also included in this briefing book is a quantity of loose material Ford used during the hearings. The last two folders of the series contain these loose items.\n\nFord Confirmation Hearings Proceedings Transcripts File, 1973. (Boxes 238‑240, 1.2 linear feet)\n\nAn unedited and complete set of committee hearing transcripts. These include the transcripts of proceedings from the hearings conducted by the Committee on Rules and Administration and the House Committee on the Judiciary. There is some underlining and annotation by William Cramer, a volunteer assisting Ford during the confirmation hearings. Also included are the final prints of the respective committee reports.\n\nArranged chronologically.\n\nFord Confirmation Hearings File, 1973. (Boxes 241‑243, 1.2 linear feet)\n\nPrimarily material created during the confirmation hearings. Included is a correspondence control file, correspondence with the House and Senate committee chairmen, and letters of thanks to congressmen who supported Ford; material concerning Ford's opening statements, including experts' views on the role of the vice president; questions submitted in advance by committee members and the draft and final responses prepared by Ford and his staff; copies of the \"Congressional Record\"; the Library of Congress report on Ford's voting record; and hearings memoranda and rules of procedure.

(Boxes 244‑248, 2.0 linear feet)\n\nPrimarily materials from Ford's congressional office files brought together to form a reference file for use during the hearings. The confirmation team compiled reference materials for each topic on which they anticipated questions.\n\nSubjects include but are not limited to: constituents in Ford's congressional district and corporations represented in the area; Nixon's 1972 Committee for the Re‑Election of the President; Supreme Court Justice William O. Douglas; government agencies such as the General Services Administration, Civil Aeronautics Board, and the Interstate Commerce Commission; private bills sponsored by Ford; Robert Winter‑Berger and his book, The Washington Payoff; and various special interest groups who contributed to Ford's congressional campaigns. Also included here are files concerning Ford's voting record in the House, his various business involvements, background information concerning the Twenty‑fifth Amendment, and statements by the Republican Policy Committee.\n\nArranged alphabetically by subject.\n\nFord Confirmation Hearings Campaign Finance File, 1948-73. (Boxes 249‑253, 2.4 linear feet)\n\nDetailed financial information related to each of Ford's congressional campaigns and his campaign committees. Included are letters of thanks for contributions; receipts for expenditures; federal, state and local filing forms, and beginning in 1968, material concerning Ford's involvement in the distribution of funds to Republican candidates through the National Republican Congressional Committee Booster Fund. The \"confirmation team\" removed this material from Ford's office files (what is now Series G of the Ford Congressional Papers) for easier reference during the confirmation hearings.\n\nArranged chronologically by election year.\n\nFord Confirmation Hearings Agency Correspondence File, 1970-73. (Boxes 254‑258, 2.0 linear feet)\n\nPhotostatic copies of all communications, written and oral, received by many departments and agencies of the Federal government from Congressman Ford, his staff, or his representatives between January 1970 and October 1973. This includes letters, internal working memoranda, memoranda for the file and any other memoranda or letters written to Ford (or to others, if they resulted from contacts with the Ford office. Peter Rodino, chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, requested this compilation. The Ford \"confirmation team\" received a duplicate set.\n\nArranged alphabetically by department or agency and thereunder chronologically.\n\nWhite House Advance Office Files, 1973‑74. (Boxes 259-262, 1.8 linear feet)\n\nByron M. (\"Red\") Cavaney joined the White House staff as a staff assistant to President Nixon in early 1973. He served with the White House Advance Office and became its director in December 1974. This office made preparations for all presidential travel, both within the country and abroad, and presidential appearances in Washington, D.C. Several weeks before an event, advance teams would visit the site of a presidential speech or appearance to arrange for hotel accommodations, equipment rental, security, publicity, and the like. They also sent letters of appreciation to local contacts after completing the event.\n\nFrom the time of Gerald Ford's nomination as Vice President until March 1974, the Nixon White House Advance Office handled advance operations for him. By the end of January 1974, however, Warren Rustand of the vice president's own staff handled advance work in preparation for Washington appearances and Michigan trips. Beginning in March, the Ford staff handled all vice presidential advance work. Cavaney's files include correspondence, memoranda, notes, schedules, guest lists, programs, and other related material for some of Ford's appearances October 18, 1973 to March 8, 1974. These files include material addressed to both Cavaney and William Henkel, Jr., then director of the Advance Office.\n\nAdditional materials on scheduling and advance work done for Ford's appearances after December 1973 is found in the files of vice presidential aide Warren Rustand. Other series in the vice presidential papers include related information on scheduling arrangements and Ford speeches, including the Robert Hartmann files.\n\nCompiled by Sandra Raub, December 1981\n\nWhite House Editorial Staff Files, 1973‑74.
