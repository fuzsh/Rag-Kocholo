From 2000-01, he was also a visiting professor at the University of California Los Angeles Anderson School of Management.\n\nThe central theme of Professor Cochrane’s research is that macroeconomics and finance should be linked. A theory needs to explain how, given the observed prices and financial returns, households and firms decide on consumption, investment, and financing; and how, in equilibrium, prices and financial returns are determined by households and firms decisions.\n\nProfessor Cochrane’s recent financial publications include the book, Asset Pricing, and articles on dynamics in stock and bond markets, the volatility of exchange rates, the term structure of interest rates, the returns to venture capital, liquidity premiums in stock prices, the relation between stock prices and business cycles, and option pricing when investors can’t perfectly hedge. His publications in the field of economics include articles on the relations between deficits and inflation, the effects of monetary policy, and on the fiscal theory of the price level. Additional research topics of interest have included macroeconomics, health insurance and time-series econometrics.\n\nDr. Cochrane has served as a research associate for the National Bureau of Economic, a fellow of the Econometric Society, and an adjunct scholar of the CATO institute.

His most recent research focuses on asset pricing, credit risk, fixed-income securities, and over-the-counter markets.\n\nDr. Duffie is interested in how capital moves from one segment of asset markets to another, and the implications of imperfect trading opportunities for asset price behavior. He and several of his colleagues have obtained recent results on portfolio credit risk, based on the assumption that there are unobservable common default-risk factors. Duffie’s recent books include How Big Banks Fail (Princeton University Press, 2010), Measuring Corporate Default Risk (Oxford University Press, 2011), and Dark Markets (Princeton University Press, 2012).\n\nDr. Duffie is currently a fellow and member of the Council of the Econometric Society, a research associate of the National Bureau of Economic Research, a fellow of The American Academy of Arts and Sciences, as well as the 2003 IAFE/Sunguard Financial Engineer of the Year.

Prior to joining Dartmouth in 2001, Professor French was on the faculty of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology’s Sloan School of Management, the Yale School of Management, and the University of Chicago’s Booth School of Business.\n\nProfessor French is an authority on the behavior of security prices and investment strategies. He and co-author Eugene F. Fama researched the value effect and the three-factor model, and were included in articles such as “The Cross-Section of Expected Stock Returns” and “Common Risk Factors in the Returns on Stocks and Bonds.” His current research focuses on tests of asset pricing, the tradeoff between risk and return in domestic and international financial markets, and the relation between capital structure and firm value.\n\nDrs. French and Fama wrote a series of papers that questioned the validity of the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM). These papers describe two factors above and beyond a stock’s market beta, which can explain differences in stock returns: market capitalization and value. They also offer supportive evidence that a variety of patterns in average returns, often labeled as “anomalies” in past work, can be explained with their Fama-French three-factor model. Dr. French has written articles for prominent academic journals, including the Journal of Finance, the Journal of Financial Economics, Review of Financial Studies, American Economic Review, the Journal of Political Economy, and the Journal of Business. Among other accomplishments, Professor French was the vice president of the American Finance Association in 2005 as well as a Rochester Distinguished Scholar. In 2007, he became a fellow to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences.\n\nCurrently, Dr. French is a research associate at the National Bureau of Economic Research, as well as an advisory editor of the Journal of Financial Economics.

He then obtained his Ph.D. in applied mathematics in 1964, also from Harvard University. In 1971, Dr. Black was hired as a professor of finance at the University of Chicago’s Booth School of Business. Two years prior to joining the Booth school, he had formed his own consulting firm as well. In 1975, he left the University of Chicago to become a professor at Massachusetts Institute of Technology’s Sloan School of Management.\n\nDr. Black was among the first financial experts, a.k.a. “Rocket Scientists,” on Wall Street who helped to instigate a period of complex and sometimes controversial financial instruments. He was the author, with two other economists, of a seminal theory that first provided Wall Street with a complex, but workable solution on how to value an option. Prior to the evolution of their theory, there was considerable difficulty in sorting through all the variables that would affect the value of an option during its lifetime. Accounting for the variables severely limits the growth of the options model. The options pricing theory devised by Dr. Black and his collaborators and fellow economists, Myron Scholes and Robert C. Merton, solved the puzzle of options pricing. They devised a complicated mathematical equation, known as the Black-Scholes model, which accounted for the many critical variables.\n\nDr. Black maintains that his most noteworthy position of his career was as a partner of Goldman Sachs, which he joined in 1984 and continued throughout his career. At Goldman Sachs, Dr. Black helped to create hedging, trading and portfolio management strategies for the firm’s clients. In 1994, Dr. Black was diagnosed with cancer. However, he continued to correspond via computer with colleagues and friends until he saw the publication of his second book, “Exploring General Equilibrium.”\n\nSources of information for Fischer S.

VanHorne (1984)\n\nJames VanHorne received his B.A. from DePauw University in 1957, and his MBA and Ph.D. degrees from Northwestern University in 1961 and 1964, respectively. He also received a DSci (Hon.) in 1986. He is currently the A.P. Giannini Professor of Finance, Emeritus at Stanford University, having started his academic career at Stanford in 1965. Many of Dr. VanHorne’s colleagues, friends, and former students have taken it upon themselves to establish an endowed chair in his honor, the James C. Van Horne Professorship in the Stanford Graduate School of Business.\n\nProfessor VanHorne’s areas of research include theory and behavior of interest rates, capital budgeting decisions, corporate finance, valuation, the term structure of interest rates, effect of inflation, and finance innovation. He has authored roughly 60 articles in finance, economic, and management journals. He is the author of five books. Three of these books – Financial Management and Policy, 12th edition; Financial Market Rates and Flows, 6th edition; and Fundamentals of Financial Management, 12th edition, (coauthor); have been widely used as textbooks in the United States and abroad. In addition, he has written 24 cases that have been used in MBA courses in the school.\n\nIn the mid-1970s, Dr. VanHorne served as Deputy Assistant Secretary of the United States Treasury, and worked with several Federal and State of California commissions and advisory groups. Dr. VanHorne served on many corporate and nonprofit boards as well. He was the first recipient of the distinguished teaching award by MBA students, and was awarded the honor again in 1997. At Stanford, he has served as director of the MBA program and as an associate dean for academic affairs. In 1989, he received the Robert T. Davis Award by the dean for extraordinary faculty contributions over his lifetime.\n\nDr. VanHorne is a former president of the Western Finance Association.

Myers (1983)\n\nStewart Myers received his A.B. from Williams College on 1962, his MBA from Stanford University in 1964, and his Ph.D. from Stanford University in 1967. He also received the following honors throughout his career: Doctor Honoris Causa, Free University of Brussels, 1997; D. Sc., Honorary, London Business School and University of London, 2000; and D. Sc., Honoris Causa, University of Lancaster, 2012.\n\nProfessor Myers is currently the Robert C. Merton Professor of Financial Economics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology’s Sloan School of Management. His primary teaching responsibility at MIT is in the area of finance theory and corporate financial management. Professor Myers was also faculty head of MIT’s Financial Engineering Track from 1999-2003.\n\nDr. Myer’s research focus is on the valuation of real and financial assets, corporate financial policy, and the financial aspects of government regulation of business. He has authored dozens of research papers. He is the author of influential research papers on many topics, including adjusted present value, rate of return regulation, pricing and capital allocation in insurance, real options, and moral hazard and information issues in capital structure decisions. Recent research projects have include the valuation of investments in research and development, risk management, the allocation of capital in diversified firms, and the theory of corporate governance. Dr. Myer is also known for coining the term “real option.”\n\nDr. Myers is the co-author of the classic textbook, Principles of Corporate Finance, which is now in its 11th edition.

Markowitz (1982)\n\nHarry Markowitz was drawn to physics and philosophy during his high school years, and his interests continued to peak during his undergraduate years at the University of Chicago. After receiving his B.A., he continued his graduate studies at the U of C, choosing to specialize in economics. He later had the opportunity to study under well known economists such as Milton Friedman, Tjalling Koopmans, Jacob Marschak and Leonard Savage. While still a graduate student, he became a member of the Cowles Commission. In 1955, he received a Ph.D. from the University of Chicago in applying mathematics.\n\nIn 1952, his seminal theory of portfolio allocation under uncertainty was published by the Journal of Finance. That same year, Professor Markowitz was hired by the RAND Corporation. With George Dantzig’s help, Dr. Markowitz started to research optimization techniques, developing the critical line algorithm for the identifications of the optimal mean-variance portfolios, relying on what was later named the Markowitz frontier. In 1955, Dr. Markowitz spent a year at the Cowles Foundation at Yale University and published the critical line algorithm in a 1956 paper. He later wrote a book on portfolio allocation which was published in 1959.\n\nIn 1989, Dr. Markowitz was awarded the Von Neumann Prize in Operations Research Theory by the Operations Research Society of America and The Institute of Management Sciences. They cited his works in the areas of portfolio theory, sparse matrix techniques, and the SIMSCRIPT programming language. Dr. Markowitz co-founded, with Herb Karr, CACI International, to provide support and training for SIMSCRIPT.\n\nDr. Markowitz won the Nobel Prize in Economics in 1990, while he was a professor of finance at Baruch College of the City University of New York. He had put forth theories for assessing the risk involved in the stock markets and the returns on corporate bonds and stocks, known as the Modern Portfolio Theory. This Nobel winning economist is presently employed at the Rady School of Management at the University of California, San Diego.\n\nSources of information for Harry M.

Yost on March 18, 2002\n\nPhotograph from the University of California Nobel Laureates website\n\nFranco Modigliani (1981)\n\nFranco Modigliani (1918-2003) left his country of origin, Italy, in 1939 and obtained his Ph.D. from the New School of Social Research in 1944. After receiving his doctorate, Professor Modigliani taught at the New School until 1949, and then worked as a research consultant to the Cowles Commission at the University of Chicago from 1949 to 1952. Other universities where he held professorships included Carnegie Institute of Technology (1952 to 1960), Northwestern University (1960 to 1962), and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (1962 until his death).\n\nIn 1985, Dr. Modigliani received the Nobel Prize for two contributions. The first contribution was for “his analysis of the behavior of household savers.” In the early 1950s, Dr. Modigliani, trying to improve on Keynes’s consumption function, introduced his “life cycle” model of consumption. Most people, he posited, want to have a stable level of consumption. Therefore, he maintained that individuals save in high-income years and spend more than their income in low-income years. The typical trajectory is that income is low for young adults who are just starting out, then there are increases in the middle years, and then declines in retirement. Therefore, younger people borrow to spend more than their income, middle-aged people save a lot, and older people run down their savings.\n\nThe second contribution that helped Dr. Modigliani to win the Nobel Prize is the widely known Modigliani-Miller theorem in corporate finance. Professor Modigliani, together with Merton Miller, showed that under certain assumptions, the value of a firm is independent of its ratio of debt-to-equity.\n\nDr. Modigliani co-wrote two articles with Dr. Miller, and their insight was a cornerstone in the field of corporate finance. Dr. Modigliani also wrote one of the articles that started the rational expectations school of economics. In a 1954 article, he and co-author Emile Grumburg stipulated that individuals may anticipate certain government policies and act accordingly. Dr. Modigliani "
