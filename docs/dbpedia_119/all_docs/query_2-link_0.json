        "text": "Positive vs. Normative Economics: An Overview\n\nPositive economics describes and explains economic phenomena in objective and measurable terms, while normative economics focuses on subjective statements about economic fairness or how the economy should be organized. They are two branches of modern economics.\n\nPut another way, positive economics is often called the \"what is\" branch of economics, while normative economics asks what \"ought to be.\"\n\nPositive Economics\n\nPositive economics is a stream of economics that focuses on the description, quantification, and explanation of economic developments, expectations, and associated phenomena. It relies on objective data analysis, relevant facts, and associated figures. It attempts to establish any cause-and-effect relationships or behavioral associations that can help ascertain and test the development of economic theories.\n\nPositive economics is objective and fact-based, and its statements are precise, descriptive, and clearly measurable. These statements can be measured against tangible evidence or historical instances. There are no instances of subjective approval or disapproval in positive economics.\n\nHere's an example of a positive economic statement: \"Government-provided healthcare increases public expenditures.\" This statement is fact-based and has no value judgment attached to it. Its validity can be proven (or disproven) by studying healthcare spending where governments provide healthcare.\n\nNormative Economics\n\nNormative economics focuses on value-based judgments aimed at improving economic development, investment projects, and the distribution of wealth. Its goal is to summarize the desirability (or lack thereof) of various economic developments, situations, and programs by asking what should happen or what ought to be.\n\nNormative economics is subjective and value-based, originating from personal perspectives or opinions involved in the decision-making process. The statements of this type of economics are rigid and prescriptive in nature. They often sound political, which is why this economic branch is also called \"what should be\" or \"what ought to be\" economics.\n\nAn example of a normative economic statement is: \"The government should provide basic healthcare to all citizens.\" As you can deduce from this statement, it is value-based, rooted in personal perspective, and satisfies the requirement of what \"should\" be.\n\nSpecial Considerations\n\nCommon observations indicate that discussions around public policies typically involve normative economic statements. A higher degree of disagreement persists in such discussions because neither party can clearly prove their correctness.\n\nThough normative statements are generalized and subjective in nature, they act as the necessary channels for out-of-the-box thinking. Such opinions can form the foundation for any necessary changes that may have the potential to completely transform a particular project.\n\nBut normative economics cannot be the sole basis for decision-making on key economic fronts. Positive economics fills in for the objective angle that focuses on facts and cause-and-effect. Coupled with positive economics, normative economics may be useful in establishing, generating, and fulfilling new ideas and theories for different economic goals and perspectives.\n\nA clear understanding of the difference between positive and normative economics may lead to better policy-making if policies are made based on a balanced mix of facts (positive economics) and opinions (normative economics). Nonetheless, numerous policies on issues ranging from international trade to welfare are at least partially based on normative economics.\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nPositive and normative economics refer to two different branches and ways of thinking in the field. Positive economics describes economic phenomena in objective and empirically measurable terms. Normative economics describes phenomena in subjective terms, often including value-based judgments. The two branches complement each other, and both are integral to setting public policy."
