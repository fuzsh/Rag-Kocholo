Examples include systems that exhibit self-organized criticality1 and turbulence2,3. Such systems tend to exhibit spatial and temporal scaling behaviourpowerlaw behaviour of a particular observable. Scaling is found in a wide range of systems, from geophysical4 to biological5. Here we explore the possibility that scaling phenomena occur in economic systemsá-especially when the economic system is one subject to precise rules, as is the case in financial markets68. Specifically, we show that the scaling of the probability distribution of a particular economic indexthe Standard & Poor's 500can be described by a non-gaussian process with dynamics that, for the central part of the distribution, correspond to that predicted for a Lévy stable process911. Scaling behaviour is observed for time intervals spanning three orders of magnitude, from 1,000 min to 1 min, the latter being close to the minimum time necessary to perform a trading transaction in a financial market. In the tails of the distribution the fall-off deviates from that for a Lévy stable process and is approximately exponential, ensuring that (as one would expect for a price difference distribution) the variance of the distribution is finite. The scaling exponent is remarkably constant over the six-year period (1984-89) of our data. This dynamical behaviour of the economic index should provide a framework within which to develop economic models.\" Mantegna and Stanley (1995) show that the scaling of the probability distribution of the Standard & Poor's 500can be described by a non-gaussian process.\n\nDACOROGNA, Michel M., 2001.

[Cited by 222] (45.11/year)\n\n\"Scaling properties and scaling laws have been new objects of study since the early work of Mandelbrot (1963) on cotton prices. In 1990, the research group of O&A published empirical studies of scaling properties extending from a few minutes to a few years (Müller et al., 1990). These properties have shown remarkable stability over time (Guillaume et al., 1997) and were found in other financial instruments lie interest rates (Piccinato et al., 1997). Mantegna and Stanley (1995) also found scaling behavior in the stock indices examined at high frequency. In a set of recent papers, Mandelbrot et al. (1997), Fisher et al. (1997) and Calvert et al. (1997) have derived a multifractal model based on the empirical scaling laws different moments of the return distributions. Works on the scaling law of return volatility have been flourishing in the past few years often coming from physicists who started venturing in the field of finance calling themselves “econophysicists.” It is a sign that the field is moving toward a better understanding of aggregation properties. Unfortunately, the mathematical theory behind these empirical studies is not yet completely mature and there is still controversy regarding the significance of the scaling properties (LeBaron, 1999a; Bouchaud et al., 2000). Thanks to high-frequency data, this kind of debate can now take place. The challenge is to develop models that simultaneously characterize the short-term and the long-term behaviors of a time series.\"\n\nDacorogna, et al. (2001) page 8-9\n\n[foreign exchange (FX) rates, interbank money market rates, and Eurofutures contracts]\n\n\"Scaling laws describe mean absolute returns and mean squared returns as functions of their time intervals (varying from a few minutes to one or more years). We find that these quantities are proportional to a power of the interval size.\"\n\nDacorogna, et al. (2001) page 122\n\n\"In this section, we examine the behavior of the absolute size of returns as a function of the frequency at which they are measured. As already mentioned, there is no privileged time interval at which the data and the generating process should be investigated. Thus it is important to study how the different measures relate to each other. One way of doing this is to analyze the dependence of mean volatility on the time interval on which the returns are measured. For usual stochastic processes such as the random walk, this dependence gives rise to very simple scaling laws (Section 5.5.2). Since Müller et al. (1990) have empirically documented the existence of scaling laws in FX rates, there has been a large volume of work confirming these empirical findings, including Schnidrig and Würtz (1995); Fisher et al. (1997); Andersen et al. (2000) and Mantegna and Stanley (2000). This evidence is confirmed for other financial instruments, as reported by Mantegna and Stanley (1995) and Ballocchi et al. (1999b). The examination of the theoretical foundations of scaling laws are studied in Groenendijk et al. (1996); LeBaron (1999b), and Barndorff-Nielsen and Prause (1999).\"\n\nDacorogna, et al. (2001) page 147\n\n\"The scaling law is empirically found for a wide range of financial data and time intervals in good approximation. It gives a direct relation between time intervals Δt and the average volatility measured as a certain power p of the absolute returns observed over these intervals,\n\n{E[|r|p]}1/p = c(p) ΔtD(p) (5.10)\n\nwhere E is the expectation operator, and c(p) and D(p) are deterministic functions of p. We call D the drift exponent, which is similar to the characterization of Mandelbrot (1983, 1997). We choose this form for the left part of the equation in order to obtain, for a Gaussian random walk, a constant drift exponent of 0.5 whatever the choice of p. A typical choice is p = 1, which corresponds to absolute returns.\n\nTaking the logarithm of Equation 5.10, the estimation of c and D can be carried out by an ordinary least squares regression. Linear regression is, in this case, an approximation. Strictly speaking, it should not be used because the E[|r|] values for different intervals Δt are not totally independent. The longer intervals are aggregates of shorter intervals. Consequently, the regression is applied here to slightly dependent observations. This approximation is acceptable because the factor between two neighboring Δt is at least 2 (sometimes more to get even values in minutes, hours, days, weeks, and mean months), and the total span of analyzed intervals is large: from 10 min to 2 months. In addition, we shall see in Chapters 7 and 8 that volatility measured at different frequencies carries asymmetric information. This we choose the standard regression technique, 18 as Friedman and Vandersteel (1982) and others do. The error terms used for E[|r|] take into account the approximate basic errors of our prices19 and the number of independent observations for each Δt.\"\n\nDacorogna, et al. (2001) page 147-148\n\n\"We have already mentioned that the empirical results indicate a scaling behavior from time intervals of a few hours to a few months. Outside this range, the behavior departs from Equation 5.10 on both sides of the spectrum. Many authors noticed this effect, in particular, Moody and Wu (1995) and Fisher et al. (1997) for the short time intervals. It is important to understand the limitations of the scaling laws because realized volatility is playing more of an essential role in measuring volatility and thus market risk. It also serves as the quantity to be predicted in volatility forecasting and quality measurements of such forecasts, as we shall see in Chapter 8.\"\n\nDacorogna, et al. (2001) page 158\n\n\"Gençay et al. (2001d) also provide evidence that the scaling behavior breaks for returns measured at higher intervals than 1 day.\"\n\nDacorogna, et al.

[Cited by 304] (44.97/year)\n\n\"Financial prices have been found to exhibit some universal characteristics that resemble the scaling laws characterizing physical systems in which large numbers of units interact. This raises the question of whether scaling in finance emerges in a similar way--from the interactions of a large ensemble of market participants. However, such an explanation is in contradiction to the prevalent 'efficient market hypothesis' in economics, which assumes that the movements of financial prices are an immediate and unbiased reflection of incoming news about future earning prospects. Within this hypothesis, scaling in price changes would simply reflect similar scaling in the 'input' signals that influence them. Here we describe a multi-agent model of financial markets which supports the idea that scaling arises from mutual interactions of participants. Although the 'news arrival process' in our model lacks both power-law scaling and any temporal dependence in volatility, we find that it generates such behaviour as a result of interactions between agents.\" ***\n\nANDERSEN, T.G., et al., 2001.

Our estimates, termed realized volatilities and correlations, are not only model-free, but also approximately free of measurement error under general conditions, which we discuss in detail. Hence, for practical purposes, we may treat the exchange rate volatilities and correlations as observed rather than latent. We do so, and we characterize their joint distribution, both unconditionally and conditionally. Noteworthy results include a simple normality-inducing volatility transformation, high contemporaneous correlation across volatilities, high correlation between correlation and volatilities, pronounced and persistent dynamics in volatilities and correlations, evidence of long-memory dynamics in volatilities and correlations, and remarkably precise scaling laws under temporal aggregation.\"\n\nAndersen, et al.

A theory of power-law distributions in financial market fluctuations. Nature. [Cited by 98] (35.51/year)\n\n\"Insights into the dynamics of a complex system are often gained by focusing on large fluctuations. For the financial system, huge databases now exist that facilitate the analysis of large fluctuations and the characterization of their statistical behaviour1,2. Power laws appear to describe histograms of relevant financial fluctuations, such as fluctuations in stock price, trading volume and the number of trades310. Surprisingly, the exponents that characterize these power laws are similar for different types and sizes of markets, for different market trends and even for different countriessuggesting that a generic theoretical basis may underlie these phenomena. Here we propose a model, based on a plausible set of assumptions, which provides an explanation for these empirical power laws. Our model is based on the hypothesis that large movements in stock market activity arise from the trades of large participants. Starting from an empirical characterization of the size distribution of those large market participants (mutual funds), we show that the power laws observed in financial data arise when the trading behaviour is performed in an optimal way. Our model additionally explains certain striking empirical regularities that describe the relationship between large fluctuations in prices, trading volume and the number of trades.\"\n\nBARENBLATT, G.I., 1996.

We analyze a simple model that incorporates fundamental features of such systems. If the space of strategies available to the agents is small, the system is in a phase in which all information available to the agents' strategies is traded away, and agents' choices are maladaptive, resulting in a poor collective utilization of resources. For larger strategy spaces, the system is in a phase in which the agents are able to coordinate their actions to achieve a better utilization of resources. The best utilization of resources occurs at a critical point, when the dimension of the strategy space is on the order of the number of agents.\"\n\nMANDELBROT, B., 1963.

[Cited by 176] (26.03/year)\n\n\"We study the distribution of fluctuations of the S&P 500 index over a time scale ?t by analyzing three distinct databases. Database (i) contains approximately 1 200 000 records, sampled at 1-min intervals, for the 13-year period 1984–1996, database (ii) contains 8686 daily records for the 35-year period 1962–1996, and database (iii) contains 852 monthly records for the 71-year period 1926–1996. We compute the probability distributions of returns over a time scale Δt, where Δt varies approximately over a factor of 104—from 1 min up to more than one month. We find that the distributions for Δt≤ 4 d (1560 min) are consistent with a power-law asymptotic behavior, characterized by an exponent α≈3, well outside the stable Lévy regime 0<α<2. To test the robustness of the S&P result, we perform a parallel analysis on two other financial market indices. Database (iv) contains 3560 daily records of the NIKKEI index for the 14-year period 1984–1997, and database (v) contains 4649 daily records of the Hang-Seng index for the 18-year period 1980–1997. We find estimates of a consistent with those describing the distribution of S&P 500 daily returns. One possible reason for the scaling of these distributions is the long persistence of the autocorrelation function of the volatility. For time scales longer than (Δt)×≈4 d, our results are consistent with a slow convergence to Gaussian behavior.\"\n\nGopikrishnan, et al.

Turbulent cascades in foreign exchange markets. Nature 381, 767-770. [Cited by 252] (25.38/year)\n\nAbstract: \"THE availability of high-frequency data for financial markets has made it possible to study market dynamics on timescales of less than a day1. For foreign exchange (FX) rates Müller et al.2 have shown that there is a net flow of information from long to short timescales: the behaviour of long-term traders (who watch the markets only from time to time) influences the behaviour of short-term traders (who watch the markets continuously). Motivated by this hierarchical feature, we have studied FX market dynamics in more detail, and report here an analogy between these dynamics and hydrodynamic turbulence3−8. Specifically, the relationship between the probability density of FX price changes ( x) and the time delay ( t) (Fig. la) is much the same as the relationship between the probability density of the velocity differences ( v) of two points in a turbulent flow and their spatial separation r (Fig. 1b). Guided by this similarity we claim that there is an information cascade in FX market dynamics that corresponds to the energy cascade in hydrodynamic turbulence. On the basis of this analogy we can now rationalize the statistics of FX price differences at different time delays, which is important for, for example, option pricing. The analogy also provides a conceptual framework for understanding the short-term dynamics of speculative markets.\"\n\nPLEROU, V., et al., 1999. Scaling of the distribution of price fluctuations of individual companies, Physical Review E. [Cited by 142] (21.00/year)\n\n\"We present a phenomenological study of stock price fluctuations of individual companies. We systematically analyze two different databases covering securities from the three major US stock markets: (a) the New York Stock Exchange, (b) the American Stock Exchange, and (c) the National Association of Securities Dealers Automated Quotation stock market. Specifically, we consider (i) the trades and quotes database, for which we analyze 40 million records for 1000 US companies for the 2-year period 1994--95, and (ii) the Center for Research and Security Prices database, for which we analyze 35 million daily records for approximately 16,000 companies in the 35-year period 1962--96. We study the probability distribution of returns over varying time scales ? t, where ? t varies by a factor of  105---from 5 min up to  4 years. For time scales from 5~min up to approximately 16~days, we find that the tails of the distributions can be well described by a power-law decay, characterized by an exponent α  3 ---well outside the stable Lévy regime 0 < α < 2.

VULPIANI, 1987. Anomalous scaling laws in multifractal objects. [Cited by 317] (16.90/year)\n\n\"Anomalous scaling laws appear in a wide class of phenomena where global dilation invariance fails. In this case, the description of scaling properties requires the introduction of an infinite set of exponents. Numerical and experimental evidence indicates that this description is relevant in the theory of dynamical systems, of fully developed turbulence, in the statistical mechanics of disordered systems, and in some condensed matter problems.\n\nWe describe anomalous scaling in terms of multifractal objects. They are defined by a measure whose scaling properties are characterized by a family of singularities, which are identified by a scaling exponent. Singularities corresponding to the same exponent are distributed on fractal set. The multifractal object arises as the superposition of these sets, whose fractal dimensions are related to the anomalous scaling exponents via a Legendre transformation. It is thus possible to reconstruct the probability distribution of the singularity exponents.\n\nWe review the application of this formalism to the description of chaotic attractors in dissipative systems, of the energy dissipating set in fully developed turbulence, of some probability distributions in condensed matter problems. Moreover, a simple extension of the method allows us to treat from the same point of view temporal intermittency in chaotic systems and sample to sample fluctuations in disordered systems. We stress the phenomenological nature of the approach and discuss the few cases in which it was possible to reach a more fundamental understanding of anomalous scaling. We point out the need of a theory which should explain its origin and pave the way to a microscopic calculation of the probability distribution of the singularities.\"\n\nPETERS, E.E., 1991.

Agents have different strategies among which they can choose, according to their relative profitability, with the possibility of not participating to the market. The price is updated according to the excess demand, and the wealth of the agents is properly accounted for. Only two parameters play a significant role: one describes the impact of trading on the price, and the other describes the propensity of agents to be trend following or contrarian. We observe three different regimes, depending on the value of these two parameters: an oscillating phase with bubbles and crashes, an intermittent phase and a stable `rational' market phase. The statistics of price changes in the intermittent phase resembles that of real price changes, with small linear correlations, fat tails and long range volatility clustering. We discuss how the time dependence of these two parameters spontaneously drives the system in the intermittent region. We analyze quantitatively the temporal correlation of activity in the intermittent phase, and show that the `random time strategy shift' mechanism that we proposed earlier allows one to understand the observed long ranged correlations. Other mechanisms leading to long ranged correlations are also reviewed. We discuss several other issues, such as the formation of bubbles and crashes, the influence of transaction costs and the distribution of agents wealth.\"\n\nMANTEGNA, R.N. and H.E. STANLEY, 1996.

By using the concept of a central vertex, chosen as the most strongly connected node of the tree, an important characteristic is defined by the mean occupation layer. During crashes, due to the strong global correlation in the market, the tree shrinks topologically, and this is shown by a low value of the mean occupation layer. The tree seems to have a scale-free structure where the scaling exponent of the degree distribution is different for \"business as usual\" and \"crash\" periods. The basic structure of the tree topology is very robust with respect to time.

We find (i) the distribution of the logarithm of the growth rates, for a fixed growth period of one year, and for companies with approximately the same size S, display an exponential form, and (ii) the fluctuations in the growth rates - measured by the width of this distribution - scale as a power with .

[Cited by 77] (8.79/year)\n\n\"Modelling accurately financial price variations is an essential step underlying portfolio allocation optimization, derivative pricing and hedging, fund management and trading. The observed complex price fluctuations guide and constraint our theoretical understanding of agent interactions and of the organization of the market. The gaussian paradigm of independent normally distributed price increments has long been known to be incorrect with many attempts to improve it. Econometric nonlinear autoregressive models with conditional heteroskedasticity (ARCH) and their generalizations capture only imperfectly the volatility correlations and the fat tails of the probability distribution function (pdf) of price variations. Moreover, as far as changes in time scales are concerned, the so-called ``aggregation'' properties of these models are not easy to control. More recently, the leptokurticity of the full pdf was described by a truncated ``additive'' L\\'evy flight model (TLF). Alternatively, Ghashghaie et al. proposed an analogy between price dynamics and hydrodynamic turbulence. In this letter, we use wavelets to decompose the volatility of intraday (S&P500) return data across scales. We show that when investigating two-points correlation functions of the volatility logarithms across different time scales, one reveals the existence of a causal information cascade from large scales (i.e. small frequencies, hence to vocable ``infrared'') to fine scales (``ultraviolet''). We quantify and visualize the information flux across scales. We provide a possible interpretation of our findings in terms of market dynamics.\"\n\nJOHNSON, N.F., et al., 1998.

The problem is the following: an ‘option’ is an insurance contract protecting its owner against the rise (or fall) of financial assets, such as stocks, currencies, etc. The problem of knowing the value of such contracts became extrememly acute when organized option markets opened twenty five years ago, allowing one to buy or sell options much like stocks. Almost simultaneously, Black and Scholes (BS) proposed theit famous option pricing theory, based on a simplified model for stock fluctuations, namely the (geometrical) Brownian motion model. The most important parameter of the model is the ‘volatility’ σ, which is the standard deviation of the market price’s relative fluctuations. Guided by the Black-Scholes theory, but constrained by the fact that ‘bad’ prices lead to arbitrage opportunities, option markets agree on prices which are close, but significantly and systematically different from the BS formula.

[Cited by 49] (5.49/year)\n\nAbstract: \"This paper presents the first empirical investigation of the Multifractal Model of Asset Returns (“MMAR”). The MMAR, developed in Mandelbrot, Fisher, and Calvet (1997), is an alternative to ARCH-type representations for modelling temporal heterogeneity in financial returns. Typically, researchers introduce temporal heterogeneity through time-varying conditional second moments in a discrete time framework, or time-varying volatility in a continuous time framework. Multifractality introduces a new source of heterogeneity through time-varying local regularity in the price path. The concept of local Hölder exponent describes local regularity. Multifractal processes bridge the gap between locally Gaussian (Itô) diffusions and jump-diffusions by allowing a multiplicity of Hölder exponents. This paper investigates multifractality in Deutschemark / US Dollar currency exchange rates. After finding evidence of multifractal scaling, we show how to estimate the multifractal spectrum via the Legendre transform. The scaling laws found in the data are replicated in simulations. Further simulation experiments test whether alternative representations, such as FIGARCH, are likely to replicate the multifractal signature of the Deutschemark / US Dollar data. On the basis of this evidence, the MMAR hypothesis appears more likely. Overall, the MMAR is quite successful in uncovering a previously unseen empirical regularity. Additionally, the model generates realistic sample paths, and opens the door to new theoretical and applied approaches to asset pricing and risk valuation. We conclude by advocating further empirical study of multifractality in financial data, along with more intensive study of estimation techniques and inference procedures.\"\n\nFisher, Calvert and Mandelbrot (1997) find evidence of a multifractal scaling law in Deutschemark / US Dollar returns.\n\nGENÇAY, Ramazan, Faruk SELÇUK and Brandon WHITCHER, 2001.

Our methodology is based on a wavelet multi-scaling approach which decomposes the variance of a time series and the covariance between two time series on a scale by scale basis through the application of a discrete wavelet transformation. It is shown that foreign exchange rate volatilities follow different scaling laws at different horizons. Particularly, there is a smaller degree of persistence in intra-day volatility as compared to volatility at one day and higher scales. Therefore, a common practice in the risk management industry to convert risk measures calculated at shorter horizons into longer horizons through a global scaling parameter may not be appropriate. This paper also demonstrates that correlation between the foreign exchange volatilities is the lowest at the intra-day scales but exhibits a gradual increase up to a daily scale. The correlation coefficient stabilizes at scales one day and higher. Therefore, the benefit of currency diversification is the greatest at the intra-day scales and diminishes gradually at higher scales (lower frequencies). The wavelet cross-correlation analysis also indicates that the association between two volatilities is stronger at lower frequencies.\"\n\nGençay, Selçuk and Whitcher (2001) show that foreign exchange rate volatilities follow different scaling laws at different horizons.\n\nWERON, R., I.

For this purpose the concepts of chaos theory and fractals are applied. Two independent models are used to examine price variations in the Norwegian and US stock markets. The first model used is the range over standard deviation or R/S statistic which tests for persistence or antipersistence in the time series. Both the Norwegian and US stock markets show significant persistence caused by long-run \"memory\" components in the series. In addition, an average non-periodic cycle of four years is found for the US stock market. These results are not consistent with the random walk assumption. The second model investigates the distributional scaling behaviour of the high-frequency price variations in the Norwegian stock market. The results show a remarkable constant scaling behaviour between different time intervals. This means that there is no intrinsic time scale for the dynamics of stock price variations. The relationship can be expressed through a scaling exponent, describing the development of the distributions as the time scale changes. This description may be important when constructing or improving pricing models such that they coincide more closely with the observed market behaviour. The empirical distributions of high-frequency price variations for the Norwegian stock market is then compared to the Lévy stable distribution with the relevant scaling exponent found by using the R/S- and distributional scaling analysis. Good agreement is found between the Lévy profile and the empirical distribution for price variations less than ±6 standard deviations, covering almost three orders of magnitude in the data. For probabilities larger than ±6 standard deviations, there seem to be an exponential fall-off from the Lévy profile in the tails which indicates that the second-moment may be finite.\"\n\nSkjeltorp (2000) found scaling in the Norwegian stock market.\n\nSCHELLNHUBER, H.J., J.

In contrast with the standard models of continuous time finance, multifractal processes contain a multiplicity of local H¨older exponents within any nite time interval. We characterize the distribution of H¨older exponents by the multifractal spectrum of the process. For a broad class of multifractal processes, this distribution can be obtained by an application of Cramer's Large Deviation Theory. In an alternative interpretation, the multifractal spectrum describes the fractal dimension of the set of points having a given local H¨older exponent. Finally, we show how to obtain processes with varied spectra. This allows the applied researcher to relate an empirical estimate of the multifractal spectrum back to a particular construction of the stochastic process.\"\n\nCalvet, Fisherand Mandelbrot (1997)\n\nMASOLIVER, J., M.

[Cited by 15] (2.60/year)\n\nAbstract: \"High-frequency data in finance have led to a deeper understanding on probability distributions of market prices. Several facts seem to be well established by empirical evidence. Specifically, probability distributions have the following properties: (i) They are not Gaussian and their center is well adjusted by Lévy distributions. (ii) They are long-tailed but have finite moments of any order. (iii) They are self-similar on many time scales. Finally, (iv) at small time scales, price volatility follows a non-diffusive behavior. We extend Merton's ideas on speculative price formation and present a dynamical model resulting in a characteristic function that explains in a natural way all of the above features. The knowledge of such a distribution opens a new and useful way of quantifying financial risk. The results of the model agree – with high degree of accuracy – with empirical data taken from historical records of the Standard & Poor's 500 cash index.\"\n\nHEATH, D. and E. PLATEN, 2003.

[Cited by 7] (2.54/year)\n\nAbstract: \"This paper describes a two-factor model for a diversified market index using the growth optimal portfolio with a stochastic and possibly correlated intrinsic timescale. The index is modelled using a time transformed squared Bessel process with a log-normal scaling factor for the time transformation. A consistent pricing and hedging framework is established by using the benchmark approach. Here the numeraire is taken to be the growth optimal portfolio. Benchmarked traded prices appear as conditional expectations of future benchmarked prices under the real world probability measure. The proposed minimal market model with log-normal scaling produces the type of implied volatility term structures for European call and put options typically observed in real markets. In addition, the prices of binary options and their deviations from corresponding BlackScholes prices are examined.\"\n\nMÜLLER, U.A., et al., 1993.

[Cited by 32] (2.48/year)\n\n\"A fractal approach is used to analyze financial time series, applying different degrees of time resolution, and the results are interrelated. Some fractal properties of foreign exchange (FX) data are found. In particular, the mean size of the absolute values of price changes follows a “fractal” scaling law (a power law) as a function of the analysis time interval ranging from a few minutes up to a year. In an autocorrelation study of intra-day data, the absolute values of price changes are seen to behave like the fractional noise ofMandelbrot and Van Ness rather than those of a GARCH process.\n\nIntra-day FX data exhibit strong seasonal and autoregressive heteroskedasticity. This can be modeled with the help of new time scales, one of which is termed intrinsic time. These time scales are successfully applied to a forecasting model with a “fractal” structure for FX as well as interbank interest rates, the latter presenting market structures similar to the Foreign Exchange.\n\nThe goal of this paper is to demonstrate how the analysis of high-frequency data and the finding of fractal properties lead to the hypothesis of a heterogeneous market where different market participants analyze past events and news with different time horizons. This hypothesis is further supported by the success of trading models with different dealing frequencies and risk profiles. Intrinsic time is proposed for modeling the frame of reference of each component of a heterogeneous market.\"\n\nSTANLEY, H.E., et al., 2000. Scale invariance and universality of economic fluctuations. Physica A Volume 283, Issues 1-2 , 1 August 2000, Pages 31-41. [Cited by 14] (2.43/year)\n\nAbstract: \"In recent years, physicists have begun to apply concepts and methods of statistical physics to study economic problems, and the neologism \"econophysics\" is increasingly used to refer to this work. Much recent work is focused on understanding the statistical properties of time series. One reason for this interest is that economic systems are examples of complex interacting systems for which a huge amount of data exist, and it is possible that economic time series viewed from a different perspective might yield new results. This manuscript is a brief summary of a talk that was designed to address the question of whether two of the pillars of the field of phase transitions and critical phenomena – scale invariance and universality – can be useful in guiding research on economics. We shall see that while scale invariance has been tested for many years, universality is relatively less frequently discussed. This article reviews the results of two recent studies – (i) The probability distribution of stock price fluctuations: Stock price fluctuations occur in all magnitudes, in analogy to earthquakes – from tiny fluctuations to drastic events, such as market crashes. The distribution of price fluctuations decays with a power-law tail well outside the Lévy stable regime and describes fluctuations that differ in size by as much as eight orders of magnitude. (ii) Quantifying business firm fluctuations: We analyze the Computstat database comprising all publicly traded United States manufacturing companies within the years 1974–1993. We find that the distributions of growth rates is different for different bins of firm size, with a width that varies inversely with a power of firm size. Similar variation is found for other complex organizations, including country size, university research budget size, and size of species of bird populations.\"\n\nRABERTO, M., et al., 1999.

Our aim is to empirically characterize the volatility random walk in the framework of continuous-time finance. To this end, we compute the index volatility by means of the log-return standard deviation. We choose an hourly time window in order to investigate intraday properties of volatility. A periodic component is found for the hourly time window, in agreement with previous observations. Fluctuations are studied by means of detrended fluctuation analysis, and we detect long-range correlations. Volatility values are log-stable distributed. We discuss the implications of these results for stochastic volatility modelling.\"\n\nEVERTSZ, Carl J.G., 1995. Fractal Geometry of Financial Time Series, Fractals Vol. 3, No. 3, pp. 609-616.

A stronger form of self-similarity entails not only that this mean absolute value, but also the full distributions of lag-k jumps have a scaling behavior characterized by the above Hurst exponent. In 1963 Benoit Mandelbrot showed that cotton prices have such a strong form of (distributional) self-similarity, and for the rst time introduced Lévy’s stable random variables in the modeling of price records. This paper discusses the analysis of the self-similarity of high-frequency DEM-USD exchange rate records and the 30 main German stock price records. Distributional self-similarity is found in both cases and some of its consequences are discussed.\"\n\nEvertsz (1995) found distributional self-similarity in DEM-USD exchange rate records and the 30 main German stock price records.\n\nBARENBLATT, G.I., S.

The data include minute by minute records of the Hang Seng index from January 3, 1994 to May 28, 1997. The probability distribution functions of index returns for the time scales from 1 minute to 128 minutes are given. The results show that the nature of the stochastic process underlying the time series of the returns of Hang Seng index cannot be described by the normal distribution. It is more reasonable to model it by a truncated Lévy distribution with an exponential fall-off in its tails. The scaling of the maximium value of the probability distribution is studied. Results show that the data are consistent with scaling of a Lévy distribution. It is observed that in the tail of the distribution, the fall-off deviates from that of a Lévy stable process and is approximately exponential, especially after removing daily trading pattern from the data. The daily pattern thus affects strongly the analysis of the asymptotic behavior and scaling of fluctuation distributions.\"\n\nWang and Hui (2001) identify scaling in the Hang Seng index.\n\nSCALAS, E., 1998.
