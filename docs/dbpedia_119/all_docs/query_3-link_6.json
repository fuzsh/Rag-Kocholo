This paper first presents a wide range of stylized facts studied in literature which include some univariate distributional properties, multivariate properties and time series related properties of the financial time series data. In the next part of the paper, price data from several stocks listed on 10 stock exchanges spread across different continents has been analysed and data analysis has been presented.",
