        "text": "I'm a philosopher at New York University and the Australian National University. I'm interested in consciousness: e.g. the hard problem (see also this TED talk, the science of consciousness, zombies, and panpsychism. Lately I've been thinking a lot about the philosophy of technology: e.g. the extended mind (another TED talk), the singularity, and especially the universe as a simulation and virtual reality. I have a sideline in metaphilosophy: e.g. philosophical progress, verbal disputes, and philosophers' beliefs. I help run PhilPapers and other online resources. Here's my website (it was cutting edge in 1995; new version coming soon).\n\nRecent Links:\n\n\"What It's Like to be a Philosopher\" - (my life story)\n\nConsciousness and the Universe - (a wide-ranging interview)\n\nReverse Debate on Consciousness - (channeling the other side)\n\nThe Mind Bleeds into the World: A Conversation with David Chalmers - (issues about VR, AI, and philosophy that I've been thinking about recently)\n\nOUP Books\n\nOxford University has made some books available at a 30% discount by using promocode AAFLYG6** on the oup.com site.
