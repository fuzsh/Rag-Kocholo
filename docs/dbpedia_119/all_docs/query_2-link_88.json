        "text": "Gen­er­a­tion Z has emerged as a pop­u­la­tion increas­ing­ly wor­thy of atten­tion, espe­cial­ly now as its old­er mem­bers are in their 20s and have become a polit­i­cal­ly engaged force in recent elec­tions. Born after 1996, Gen­er­a­tion Zers made up one-tenth of the 2020 elec­torate and have added 8.3 mil­lion new­ly eli­gi­ble vot­ers since Novem­ber 2022 — reach­ing an esti­mat­ed 41 mil­lion total eli­gi­ble vot­ers in 2024. While they share a num­ber of char­ac­ter­is­tics with mil­len­ni­als, their for­ma­tive years have been shaped by a dras­ti­cal­ly dif­fer­ent world, result­ing in key dif­fer­ences in atti­tudes, ten­den­cies and out­look. Sta­tis­tics com­piled by the Pew Research Cen­ter and the KIDS COUNT® Data Cen­ter paint a clear pic­ture. Here’s what we know.\n\nDiver­si­ty Is Their Norm\n\nOne of the core char­ac­ter­is­tics of Gen­er­a­tion Z is racial diver­si­ty. As America’s demo­graph­ics con­tin­ue to shift, Gen Z will be the last gen­er­a­tion that is a major­i­ty white — just bare­ly, with 51%.\n\nThe younger Gen­er­a­tion Alpha, born 2013 to 2025, is 48% white and on track to be the most diverse gen­er­a­tion yet. On the oth­er hand, much larg­er shares of the old­er mil­len­ni­als, Gen Xers and baby boomers are white: 55%, 60% and 72%, respectively.\n\nGen Z is more racial­ly and eth­ni­cal­ly diverse than old­er gen­er­a­tions, with:\n\n25% Lati­no or His­pan­ic;\n\n15% Black;\n\n6% Asian Amer­i­can or Pacif­ic Islander;\n\n5% two or more races; and\n\n2% Amer­i­can Indi­an or Alas­ka Native young people.\n\nAs Gen Zers grew up over the past two decades, chil­dren in immi­grant fam­i­lies grew more com­mon, too, ris­ing from 19% of the country’s child pop­u­la­tion in the ear­ly 2000s to 25% in 2021.\n\nFor many Gen Zers, the back­drop of their ear­ly years includ­ed the country’s first Black pres­i­dent and the legal­iza­tion of gay mar­riage. They are more like­ly to have grown up amid diverse fam­i­ly struc­tures — whether in a sin­gle-par­ent house­hold, a mul­tira­cial house­hold, or a house­hold in which gen­der roles were blurred. As a result, they are less fazed than pre­vi­ous gen­er­a­tions by dif­fer­ences in race, sex­u­al ori­en­ta­tion or religion.\n\nThey Are Our First ​“Dig­i­tal Natives”\n\nAnoth­er char­ac­ter­is­tic of Gen­er­a­tion Z is their native use of tech­nol­o­gy. Where­as mil­len­ni­als were con­sid­ered ​“dig­i­tal pio­neers,” who bore wit­ness to the explo­sion of tech­nol­o­gy and social media, Gen Z was born into a world of peak tech­no­log­i­cal inno­va­tion — where infor­ma­tion was imme­di­ate­ly acces­si­ble and social media increas­ing­ly ubiquitous.\n\nThese tech­no­log­i­cal advance­ments have had both pos­i­tive and neg­a­tive effects on Gen Z. On the plus side: an abun­dance of infor­ma­tion is at their fin­ger­tips, allow­ing Gen Zers to broad­en their knowl­edge, access resources and be proac­tive in their learn­ing. Social media can also offer social sup­port from peers or oth­ers, which may be espe­cial­ly ben­e­fi­cial for mar­gin­al­ized young peo­ple, such as sex­u­al and gen­der minori­ties. On the oth­er hand, too much screen time is linked to depres­sion and anx­i­ety, low self-esteem and poor body image, eat­ing dis­or­der behav­iors, inad­e­quate sleep and oth­er health prob­lems. Addi­tion­al­ly, tech­nol­o­gy is chang­ing the econ­o­my and the nature of work, increas­ing­ly requir­ing post­sec­ondary edu­ca­tion to pre­pare young peo­ple for new jobs, leav­ing many low-income Gen Zers vul­ner­a­ble as they enter the workforce.\n\nThey Are Prag­mat­ic and Finan­cial­ly Minded\n\nFinan­cial mind­ed­ness is anoth­er core char­ac­ter­is­tic of Gen­er­a­tion Z. Many Gen Zers grew up watch­ing their par­ents take huge finan­cial hits dur­ing the Great Reces­sion. Hav­ing wit­nessed their par­ents’ strug­gles, this gen­er­a­tion is dri­ven by prag­ma­tism and security.\n\nWhile mil­len­ni­als came of age dur­ing an eco­nom­ic boom, Gen Zers were shaped by the eco­nom­ic pres­sures their fam­i­lies and com­mu­ni­ties faced, like the finan­cial stress of the rental mar­ket. Thus, they val­ue the sta­bil­i­ty that comes with con­ser­v­a­tive spend­ing, sta­ble jobs and smart investments.\n\nMany Fac­tors Con­tribute to Their Men­tal Health Challenges\n\nMen­tal health chal­lenges are a sad char­ac­ter­is­tic of Gen­er­a­tion Z, which has been referred to by some as the ​“loneli­est gen­er­a­tion,” as their near-con­stant hours spent online can fos­ter feel­ings of iso­la­tion and depres­sion, among oth­er men­tal health issues, as not­ed. Sur­pris­ing­ly, a recent Stan­ford study found that most Gen Zers pre­fer in-per­son communication.\n\nMore screen time obvi­ous­ly means less time spent cul­ti­vat­ing mean­ing­ful rela­tion­ships. Addi­tion­al­ly, many young peo­ple fall prey to the ​“com­pare and despair” trap that social media presents.\n\nRead more about Social Medi­a’s Con­cern­ing Effects on Teen Men­tal Health\n\nGen Z youth val­ue self-care and are con­cerned about their men­tal health. They also find their men­tal health affect­ed by the tur­bu­lent state of the world. As polit­i­cal activism among Gen Z has increased, many Gen Zers have inter­nal­ized the unrest sur­round­ing issues like gun con­trol, police bru­tal­i­ty and cli­mate change — lead­ing to increased lev­els of stress. Addi­tion­al soci­etal crises and stres­sors have had an impact, too, includ­ing the COVID-19 pan­dem­ic and the increas­ing cost of living.\n\nThey Are Shrewd Consumers\n\nAs con­sumers, Gen Z’s behav­ior reflects their val­ues — and the influ­ence of an increas­ing­ly dig­i­tal world. Gen Z kids can rely on their tech savvy and exten­sive social media plat­forms to make informed pur­chas­ing deci­sions. Their prag­ma­tism leads them to explore and eval­u­ate a range of options before set­tling on a prod­uct. In addi­tion, they are more like­ly to be swayed by the rec­om­men­da­tions of real-life users than by celebri­ty endorsements.\n\nIn much the same way that Gen Zers use social media as a means to curate their own per­son­al brand, they also look at their pur­chas­ing deci­sions as an expres­sion of their val­ues and iden­ti­ty. As an exam­ple, they are drawn to sus­tain­able prod­ucts and brands — and are often will­ing to pay more for them. They val­ue per­son­al­ized prod­ucts, and they are drawn to brands that share their point of view on polit­i­cal issues.\n\nThey Are Polit­i­cal­ly Pro­gres­sive — Even Those on the Right\n\nMost gen­er­a­tions tend to be more left-lean­ing than the pre­vi­ous gen­er­a­tion, and Gen Z is no excep­tion. While Gen Zers look a lot like mil­len­ni­als on many key issues, they are the most polit­i­cal­ly pro­gres­sive gen­er­a­tion yet. They are the gen­er­a­tion most like­ly to see the advance­ment of LGBTQ rights as a pos­i­tive devel­op­ment. Even among Repub­li­cans, Gen Zers take a more pro­gres­sive stance on social issues: they agree that Black Amer­i­cans are treat­ed more unfair­ly in this coun­try, they believe the gov­ern­ment should play a greater role in solv­ing prob­lems and they are more like­ly to attribute cli­mate change to human activ­i­ty, as opposed to nat­ur­al patterns.\n\nCon­tin­ue Learn­ing About Gen­er­a­tion Z\n\nGen Z is still grow­ing up, but as they con­tin­ue to come of age, ear­ly signs indi­cate that they will grow into engaged, con­sci­en­tious stew­ards of our world — by being social­ly-mind­ed, inde­pen­dent thinkers, who rec­og­nize their respon­si­bil­i­ty in shap­ing a more equi­table future for all.\n\nMore Resources on Gen­er­a­tion Z\n\nGo to the KIDS COUNT Data Cen­ter for the lat­est sta­tis­tics on chil­dren of all ages, includ­ing a new dataset on youth and young adults ages 14 to 24, cap­tur­ing the major­i­ty of Gen Zers.\n\n2023 KIDS COUNT Data Book\n\nWhat the Sta­tis­tics Say About Gen­er­a­tion Z\n\nSocial Issues That Mat­ter to Gen­er­a­tion Z\n\nGen­er­a­tion Z and Men­tal Health\n\nSta­tis­tics Snap­shot: Gen­er­a­tion Z and Education\n\nWhat is Gen­er­a­tion Alpha?\n\nSocial Medi­a’s Con­cern­ing Effect on Teen Men­tal Health\n\nNew KIDS COUNT Data Cen­ter indi­ca­tors on Gen Z and oth­er generations:\n\nPop­u­la­tion size by Gen Alpha, Gen Z, mil­len­ni­als, Gen X and baby boomers, by race and ethnicity\n\nPeo­ple liv­ing in pover­ty by generation\n\nPeo­ple liv­ing in pover­ty by gen­er­a­tion and race and ethnicity\n\nPeo­ple liv­ing in low-income house­holds by generation\n\nPeo­ple liv­ing in low-income house­holds by gen­er­a­tion and race and ethnicity\n\nSign Up for Our Email Newsletters"
