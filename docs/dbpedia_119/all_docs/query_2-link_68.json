        "text": "Some authors are careful to avoid the word class when focusing solely on income. Gornick and Jäntti, for instance, write the middle class “might more accurately be described as those households that fall in the ‘middle’—that is, in the middle of the income distribution.” Similarly, Williams and Boushey call their group, which is primarily defined as everyone between the bottom third and the top fifth of the income distribution, the “missing middle.” Among most economists, however, the term middle class has largely become synonymous with middle income.\n\nThe question then is which incomes count as those in the “middle.” Even among scholars working solely with income definitions, there is no consensus. As Atkinson and Brandolini gently put it: “There is…a certain penumbra surrounding the definition of middle class.”1 The edited volume in which their essay appears contains no fewer than ten income-based definitions.\n\nIncome-based definitions themselves tend to rely on one of four main approaches:\n\nDistance from the median (e.g. from 75 to 125 percent of median income)\n\nRange of the distribution (e.g. income quintiles 2 to 4)\n\nDistance from poverty (e.g. above 150 percent of the federal poverty lin3)\n\nAbsolute purchasing power (e.g. $10 to $100 per person per day in purchasing power parity terms)\n\nNote, too that there are many different ways of defining and measuring income. Should we look at market income, or disposable income after transfers and taxes? Should we adjust incomes for household size, and if so how? Which measure of inflation should we use to generate “real” income figures? How should we treat households who report zero income? What data source is the least likely to suffer from underreporting? And so on.\n\nFor the purposes of illustrating different income-based definitions of the middle class in this paper, we use data from the Current Population Survey Annual Social and Economic Supplement on pre-tax household money income, adjusted for household size using square root equivalents, and expressed in 2016 dollars using the PCE deflator (see more details in the Technical Note below).\n\nMedian Income\n\nTrends in median income are often used as a litmus test for middle-class progress. “The clearest indicator of the continuing struggles of the middle class,” write researchers from the Center for American Progress, “has been the failure of the national median income to rebound to pre-recession levels and its overall decline over the past 14 years.” Likewise, when the Census Bureau revealed that its estimate of median household income rose to $59,039 in 2016, the Washington Post reported: “The incomes of middle-class Americans rose last year to the highest level ever recorded by the Census Bureau.”\n\nWhile the economic circumstances of the median household can be a useful indicator of overall economic health, changes in median income must be understood in the context of changes in the composition of U.S. households, such as shrinking family sizes and the aging of the population. The condition of the “typical” U.S. household also tells us little about the size or diversity of the middle class.\n\nIn terms of looking at the middle class as whole, it is generally more useful to examine households within a certain income band around the median. In one of the most widely cited definitions of the last five years, Pew Research Center defines the middle class as all households with incomes between two-thirds and twice the national median. Alan Krueger has popularized an income band of 50 to 150 percent around the median. Several researchers have used Lester C. Thurow’s narrower range of 75 to 125 percent; Birdsall, Graham, and Pettinato, for example, apply the 75/125 band to 30 countries’ median incomes to identify “the middle strata in income terms in each country.” (Others have extended the upper bound to 200 percent or even 300 percent of median income.)2 The Pew, Kreuger, and Thurow definitions might seem fairly similar, but they capture quite different slices of population. The middle class may include households making as little as $35,000 or as much as $139,000 in household-of-three equivalents, and include between 23 and 48 percent of households:\n\nNote that the income ranges we show here are not necessarily the same as the ones produced by these authors themselves. They may each use a different source of data for the income distribution, and/or take a different approach to defining households, adjusting for household size, and so on. Our goal here is simply to show the results of applying various definitions to the same income distribution.\n\nUnder a median income approach, the size of the middle class can change over time. For instance, Pew finds that the share of adults in the middle class fell from 61 percent in 1970 to 50 percent in 2014. Other income bands tend to reveal a similar shrinkage, but with different baselines: under Krueger’s definition, the share of households in the middle class declined from 50 to 42 percent over roughly the same period (1970 to 2010).\n\nIt is tempting to interpret these findings as a “weakening” or “hollowing out” of the middle class. But this might depend on where the formerly middle class households end up. Of the 11 percent of adults who exited the Pew middle class between 1971 and 2015, 4 percentage points fell into the lower class and 7 percentage points moved into the upper or upper-middle class. This may be evidence of greater income polarization, as described by Foster and Wolfson, but not necessarily of a “weakening” of the middle class.3 A more positive spin on the data is that the share of adults who are at least middle class is rising.\n\nAnother common indicator of middle-class welfare is the share of income going to middle-class households. Again, some care is needed here. If the size of the middle class shrinks, then the income share will almost certainly shrink as well, without anybody necessarily being any worse off. The per-capita share of income could be declining, rising, or staying the same. Income share is a more telling indicator when the share of households in the middle class is held constant, as in definitions based on percentiles of the income distribution.\n\nRange of the Income Distribution\n\nRather than tying the definition of the middle class to median income, some scholars prefer to look at a fixed slice of the distribution. A common approach is to divide the population up into fifths by income to produce quintiles. The middle class can then be defined as some combination of these quintiles. The narrowest definition consists only of the middle quintile: in 2016, this group ranged from an annual pre-tax household income of $55,000 to $85,000 in household-of-three equivalents. (Note that this is nearly identical to the income range for households between 75 and 125 percent of median income.)\n\nA broader and commonly used definition of the middle class includes the middle three quintiles, encompassing 60 percent of all households. In this case, middle-class incomes range from $30,000 to $130,000. Others prefer to use two quintiles: Reeves and Busette identify a “lower-income” middle class as the second and third income quintiles, or those with incomes between $30,000 and $85,000. Perotti goes in the opposite direction, choosing the third and fourth quintiles.\n\nDefining the middle class based on income quintiles is particularly appealing because the income statistics released by the Congressional Budget Office, arguably the premier source of estimates on income inequality and tax burdens in the U.S., are reported by quintile. Still, some economists depart from the quintile approach to define their own percentile ranges. Estache and Leipziger place the middle class within the 30th to 90th percentiles of a given country’s income distribution.4\n\nUnder a percentile-based definition, the share of households in the middle class is fixed over time. This means that for every household that moves into the middle class, another must move out—either rising into a higher class or falling into a lower one. The “strength” of a percentile-based middle class is often measured as the share of income going to middle-class households. The benefits of this approach include its simplicity and its consistency over time, but these are also its major drawbacks: because the share of the population in the middle class is fixed, shifts in the shape of the income distribution itself tend be lost.\n\nDistance from Poverty\n\nThe third income-based approach defines middle-class status in terms of distance from poverty. Stephen Rose calculates the lower income bound for the lower-middle class as 150 percent of the federal poverty level (FPL) or about $30,000 for a family of three. Sawhill and Haskins set the bar at 300 percent of the FPL for entry into the middle class.5 These kinds of definition have the advantage of coinciding with a conceptual definition of the middle class: if we consider middle-class households to be “those ‘comfortably’ clear of being at-risk-of-poverty,” as Atkinson and Brandolini write, then defining the middle class as households above and below certain multiples of the federal poverty level makes intuitive sense. However, the selection of a multiple is far from an exact science. Atkinson and Brandolini document that some authors have used an upper threshold of nine or ten times the poverty line, which maps to approximately 300 percent of median income. Rose sets the boundary between the middle and upper-middle classes at five times the poverty level, or just under $100,000. Applied to our distribution of household income, this covers nearly the same half of households included in Krueger’s median income definition.\n\nIt is worth noting that “federal poverty level” is often applied to two different measures: federal poverty thresholds published by the Census Bureau, and federal poverty guidelines published by the Department of Health and Human Services. The guidelines are simplifications of the thresholds and are primarily used for administrative purposes, such as determining eligibility for financial assistance programs. We use the Census Bureau thresholds based on the Official Poverty Measure, which sets the poverty threshold as three times the cost of a minimum food diet in 1963, adjusted for inflation using the Consumer Price Index. Alternatively, the Supplemental Poverty Measure preferred by many scholars takes into account current spending on food, housing, and other necessities, as well as geographic differences in the cost of living and the effects of taxes and in-kind benefits on household resources. The intuition of all of these approaches is to define the minimum income necessary to achieve a certain standard of living; and for the middle class standard of living to be seen in terms of a certain distance from poverty.\n\nAbsolute purchasing power\n\nThe fourth income-based approach to defining the middle class is to set boundaries based on absolute purchasing power. In the U.S., for example, Perry defines the middle class as those with household incomes between $35,000 and $100,000 in 2016 dollars. Harry Holzer suggests a minimum threshold of $50,000 a year for those aged 25-54, which he argues is “appropriate since it is roughly two-thirds of median income for family households in the U.S., and also over twice the official poverty line for a family of four.”\n\nThis purchasing power approach is very common among studies seeking to identify a global rather than national middle class, and/or to make comparisons of middle class conditions across countries, especially less affluent ones. Many economists have defined the global middle class as households with incomes between $10 and $100 per person per day in at 2005 PPP. Kharas updates this to $11 to $110 in 2011 PPP terms.6 Lopez-Calva and Juarez use an upper bound of $50 per person per day in 2005 PPP terms. (Their lower bound is based on vulnerability to poverty, mentioned below.) Banerjee and Duflo identify the middle class in developing countries as those with per-capita daily expenditures between $2 and $10 per day in 2005 PPP. Ravallion raises the upper limit from $10 to $13—which is, to provide some context, just a little under the U.S. poverty threshold.\n\nWealth and Consumption\n\nWealth, or net worth, provides a different measure of resources available to a household to a pure income measure. Greater wealth may provide greater economic security, as a buffer against economic shocks, especially in later life. For example, some retirees may report very little annual income but place toward the top of the wealth distribution given the value of their homes, pension assets, and bank accounts. Since households can generally cash in on their wealth when needed, Edward Wolff describes net worth as “potential consumption.”\n\nWealth-based definitions appear to resonate with the general public. A survey by Charles Schwab suggests that people in America’s largest cities think that it takes a net worth of anywhere from $500,000 to $1 million just to be “financially comfortable” in their areas, and somewhere between $2 and $4 million to be “wealthy.” Wealth may alleviate anxiety.\n\nWolff defines the middle class as the middle three quintiles of the wealth distribution. His analysis also reveals differences in the ways that the middle and upper classes store wealth. The wealth of the top quintile is highly concentrated in investment assets, including real estate, business equity, stocks, and bonds. By contrast, housing makes up more than three-fifths of the assets of the middle three quintiles, though mortgage debt amounts to almost half of middle-class home values. Homeownership might indeed be a defining feature of the middle class—but according to Wolff, so is mortgage debt.\n\nWhile income is the most common cash-based measure of class, followed by wealth, some scholars point to other approaches, including consumption-based definitions, or those which capture financial vulnerability or risk. Meyer and Sullivan argue that expenditure serves better than income or wealth to delineate class boundaries: “Conceptual arguments as to whether income or consumption is a better measure of the material well-being of the middle class or the poor almost always favor consumption.” They find that the U.S. middle class is materially better off now than in the 1980s: median consumption has grown by over 50 percent, and households in the middle income quintile have larger houses and better-quality cars. Sullivan is cited in support of using the middle quintile by spending—around $38,200 to $49,900 for a four-person household—as a definition of the middle class. On this basis, what matters most is not what we bring home, but what we can buy. Other studies focus on some measure of vulnerability to poverty, or on income volatility, or on economic progress for specific individuals or families over time. (We will return to these specific issues of volatility, risk, and vulnerability in a later paper.)\n\nWhat unites all of these approaches is that they share the same basic currency for class determination, money—whether in earnings, income, wealth, spending, or over time. The middle class, here, is an economic category. Of course, for most people, their economic position is strongly related to their credentials, of either the educational or the occupational kind. Or they may be the way in which class is more usefully defined; and we turn to those next.\n\nClass = Credentials\n\nDefining class in economic terms makes for more straightforward empirical analysis (even though, as we’ve seen, definitions matter a great deal for the results). But most people see class as being about more than money. Status is defined not just by cash, but by particular credentials, especially in terms of occupation and education. We may intuitively rank a museum curator with a PhD differently from an HVAC engineer with a certificate from a community college, even if their incomes are identical; and perhaps even if we knew their lifetime incomes would be the same.\n\nOccupation\n\nMany scholars, especially sociologists, see occupation as “the most powerful single indicator of levels of material reward, social standing and life chances.” Income may be the most direct way of measuring material reward alone, but if social standing is primarily about how we are viewed in society, occupations are much more visible than income. After all, it is commonplace to open a conversation with, “What do you do?” but taboo to ask, “What is your salary?” Many résumés can be viewed online; few paychecks can be.\n\nThere is an international divide here: occupational classifications are more popular among European scholars than U.S. ones. Most contemporary occupational class schemes are based on the work of British sociologist John H. Goldthorpe and colleagues.7 Goldthorpe distinguishes between workers in a service relationship (“salariats” who have a reasonable expectation of continued employment and promotion) and those under a labor contract—commonly known as the working class. The UK’s official socioeconomic classification scheme, the National Statistics Socioeconomic Classification (NS-SEC), is based on the Goldthorpe approach, as is the European Socioeconomic Classification (ESeC).\n\nCharles Murray uses an eight-class scheme similar to the Goldthorpe model to group people into class-based “neighborhoods”: one working-class and the other more affluent.8 People not included in either neighborhood—those who presumably comprise the middle class (Murray calls them “everybody else”)—work in mid-level white-collar positions or high-skill technical occupations. These include, for instance, human resources specialists, K-12 teachers, and physical therapists.\n\nMurray also divides the population into the top 20, middle 50, and bottom 30 percent of socioeconomic status, based on the cognitive requirements of their occupations. Here he is drawing on a literature on occupational status, in which particular occupations are placed on a distribution of status scores, somewhat like an income distribution. Scores are assigned based on the earnings, education levels, skills, or “prestige rating” associated with an occupation. As always, however, the selection of specific dimensions, or the weight placed on those selected, can generate very different rankings. Hauser and Warren (1997) show that some occupations, like elementary school teachers, have low wages relative to occupations with similar education levels, but high prestige ratings relative to their education and earnings. Other occupations, like truck drivers, have high earnings relative to their education, but low prestige relative their education and earnings. So: are truck drives and elementary teachers in the same class?\n\nOne problem with occupation-based definitions is that while occupations are held by individuals, class is typically applied to families or households. But what if, say, a husband and wife have occupations with quite different statuses? Perhaps one is a professor and the other is a firefighter. In this case, sociologists often assign the entire household the class status denoted by the “economically dominant” occupation. This is very often the man, which means that women’s class status is tied to that of their male partners. Class categories may then be skewed towards male occupations. Equally, the use of simple occupational categories may obscure important differences between the position of men and women within occupations. Additionally, occupational class categories are obviously of very little use when no one in the household is employed, though sociologists sometimes use a person’s last known occupation as a class indicator. Finally, occupation-based class schemes have to be regularly updated as certain occupations become more or less important to the economy and society.\n\nEducation\n\nEntry into occupations of a certain class status depends on acquiring certain skills or qualifications. Occupational and educational credentials tend to go hand in hand. Education is also seen by many as a strong marker of class status in and of itself. Most often, possession of a four-year college degree serves as the threshold for determining class position. This is both because education (or degree attainment) is a relatively easy and consistent variable to measure and because it is closely correlated with other indicators of economic status, like income.\n\nEducation is, at its core, an investment in human capital, which often yields large returns in the form of higher incomes and wealth accumulation. Workers with at least a four-year college degree can expect to earn more over their lifetimes than those with a high school degree or less, and this “college wage premium” has grown over time. In 1979, the average worker ages 25-64 with a college degree or more earned about 35 percent more than the average worker with a high school degree. By 2013, this premium had increased to nearly 80 percent. College-educated workers tend to experience greater job stability and autonomy than those with lower levels of education. Having a bachelor’s degree might also serve as a powerful symbol of social status that delineates social classes.\n\nIn the wake of the 2016 U.S. presidential election, multiple observers identified the working class as adults with less than a college degree or, less frequently, those with a high school degree or less. The implication here is that those with a college degree are middle class. But this is not a general view in the population. Fewer than one in three (30 percent) of Americans believe that a college education is needed to be considered part of the middle class, according to a recent Pew survey. Popular definitions of middle class status may then overlap with expert definitions of the working class. Yet few would claim that the middle class is the same as the working class—that is, limited to only those without a college degree.\n\nOne problem associated with defining the middle class by education is that the relative values of educational credentials change over time. A bachelor’s degree might once have placed an individual and their family solidly in the elite; now it is increasingly necessary to achieve a decent standard of living.\n\nAnother problem is that the value of a college degree can vary wildly across fields. Not including those with graduate degrees, the median English major earns $1 million over a lifetime, which is closer to the median high school graduate ($0.58 million) than to the median finance major ($1.56 million).9\n\nEducation levels can be used to supplement rather than substitute for other measures of class status. Joan Williams and Heather Boushey, for example, define the “missing middle” as households that are between the bottom third and top fifth of household income, plus households in the top income quintile in which no adult has a bachelor’s degree. This means that the middle class contains roughly 55 percent of all households: 50 who are in the middle of the income distribution, and 5 who have reached a high income bracket, despite never completing a four-year degree. The definition used by Williams and Boushey has the advantage of inclusiveness—it intentionally includes a portion of the population who, defined by income alone, would be omitted from the middle class. These higher-income but less-educated Americans might feel as though they belong to the middle class because they do not relate to the “elite” norms or values often marked by one’s educational credentials. However, the measure ends up being more complex, and more influenced by normative assumptions.\n\nIt is striking that when Williams summarized her work on this group in an influential book, its title was White Working Class: Overcoming Class Cluelessness in America. She is upfront about the reason for the shift in nomenclature:\n\n“I had a lively discussion with my editor about what to call the various groups in this book. I wanted to call the group in the middle the middle class, because, well, they are. My editor wisely pointed out that readers would be confused by that, if ‘middle class’ is a term that we all use to describe ourselves regardless of whether or not it reflects reality. So I agreed to call those Americans in the middle—the ones who are neither rich nor poor—the ‘working class.’”10\n\n(I can empathize: I had a similar argument with my editor over whether to describe the top fifth as the “upper class” or “upper middle class” in my book, Dream Hoarders.) But if “middle class” and “working class” become virtual synonyms, it becomes even more important to be clear how the group in question is defined.\n\nClass = Culture\n\nDefinitions of class based on cash or credentials rest largely on “hard” tangible measures. (The main exception is the use of prestige rankings for occupations.) These allow for more robust analyses of trends, prospects, and challenges. But for many, class is a state of mind. Rather than bank balances or résumés, class is revealed through a combination of aspirations and attitudes; self-perception; or behavioral norms, preferences, and tastes. In the U.S., race also plays an important role, with whites more likely to be seen, and to see themselves, as members of the middle class.\n\nAspirations\n\n“Middle class families are defined by their aspirations more than their income,” according to a 2010 Commerce Department report prepared for Vice President Biden’s Middle Class Taskforce. The full definition is worth quoting at length:\n\n“Middle class families and those who wish to be middle class have certain common aspirations for themselves and their children. They strive for economic stability and therefore desire to own a home and to save for retirement. They want economic opportunities for their children and therefore want to provide them with a college education. Middle class families want to protect their own and their children’s health. And they want enough income for each adult to have a car and for a family vacation each year. Middle class families are forward-looking, and they know that to achieve these goals, they must work hard, plan ahead and save for the future. Indeed, being middle class may be as much about setting goals and working to achieve them as it is about their attainment.”\n\nHere, class is very much about a mindset rather than a bank balance or job category. The key ingredients of a middle-class lifestyle, according to the report, are to: own a home, be able to save for retirement, provide a college education for their children, have health security (insurance), a car for each adult, and a family vacation at least once a year. This is essentially a form of consumption definition, with middle class aspirations defined in terms of middle-class expenditures. This lifestyle is hard to achieve for some families. For example, a family with one adult and two children with an annual income of $25,200 (the 50th percentile for this family type) might achieve something akin to that ideal middle-class lifestyle with a house worth a little over $100,000, children covered by the Children’s Health Insurance Program (and an uninsured parent), and a vacation worth $500 every other year, according to the report.\n\nBut note that in this case, the definition of the middle class includes not only people who have achieved a middle-class lifestyle, but also those people who are aspiring and working hard to achieve this lifestyle. This kind of definition is very inclusive, since in principle everyone can count as middle class as long as they are aspiring and working toward a certain lifestyle. But this very inclusiveness gives the definition less bite. After all, few people do not aspire to these goods. How many people, for example, do not “want to protect their own and their children’s health”? Many people might aspire to a middle-class lifestyle, and work toward it, but not make it because of the very economic and social challenges the report describes. It might be better to show that the pathways into the middle class are narrower and more challenging to travel than they should be, and that many people are thwarted in their efforts to join the middle class.\n\nSelf-perception\n\nRather than deciding on a person’s behalf, using certain metrics, whether someone is middle class or not, it would be better to let them decide for themselves. A number of surveys capture self-definitions of class in the U.S. The biggest three are conducted by Pew, GSS/NORC, and Gallup. Each use slightly different class categories, however, and these seem to influence results quite significantly:"
