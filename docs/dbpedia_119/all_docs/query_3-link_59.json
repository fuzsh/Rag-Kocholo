        "meta_description": "Downloadable! This paper aims to explore the most important stylized facts of asset returns and their impact on the development of Value-at-Risk models. The analysis was performed on the daily returns of the BET index and of four stocks, traded at Bucharest Stock Exchange, and covered a period of five years between 2006 and 2011. The results proved that, despite being researched for a long time, stylized facts continue to be relevant even in the context of the Romanian capital market. Furthermore, financial institutions should take them into account very seriously when estimating Value-at-Risk.",
