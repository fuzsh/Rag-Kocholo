        "text": "So I heard about this \"up and coming\" area of physics and it sounds interesting, but I'm weary of fads with flashy names. Is this subject sustainable? Interesting? Producing useful results? If someone got a PhD doing it, would someone consider it a physics PhD and allow you relative lateral mobility in the field of physics? Or is it not \"real physics?\"\n\nedit: to the unfamiliar, here is a paragraph from a paper I am stealing from (nobody tell on me), from \"Econophysics and economics: Sister disciplines?\" by Christophe Schinckus: Econophysics is a hybrid discipline whose name results from the contraction of “economics” and “physics.” Econophysics is not just a new fashion in the set of existing economic theories. It is a new way of thinking about economic and financial systems based on the universality of statistical properties and complexity. Econophysicists use the tools and concepts of statistical physics and complexity science to describe socioeconomic systems markets, companies, and national economies as complex systems."
