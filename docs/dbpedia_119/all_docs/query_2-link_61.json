This is an outstanding training opportunity in molecular and genetic techniques, bioinformatics, animal care, and field research for post-bac students to get more experience for graduate schools or biotech positions. The starting date will ideally be mid- to late-summer 2024. It takes ~4 weeks for employment to be finalized once the candidate is identified.\n\nOur lab is in the Department of Integrative Biology, University of Wisconsin-Madison (UW-Madison), and we are interested in learning which genes and cellular pathways evolve during antagonistic interactions between hosts and parasites (for more details, see our website: weberlab.integrativebiology.wisc.edu). We use genetic crosses to map genomic loci that underlie infection related traits. We then follow up on these scans by perturbing candidate genes to confirm their influence on infection. Many of our focal genes regulate immune function. We use threespine stickleback fish (Gasterosteus aculeatus) as a model host and exploit its wealth of data on adaptive evolution, ecology, and genetics. Our model parasite is the threespine stickleback tapeworm (Schistocephalus solidus). We can propagate the parasite through each stage of its lifecycle in the lab, allowing us to perform controlled exposures and infections. We maintain ~12 strains of fish from across Canada and Alaska, ~10 strains of tapeworms from across the globe, and each summer we perform field research at many locations to establish new strains and measure natural infection variation. We take an integrative research approach that uses high-throughput genomics and transcriptomics, in vitro and in vivo assays, and microscopy.\n\nBasic Qualifications\n\nThe candidate should have:\n\n• Minimal BS or BA in biology, biochemistry, chemistry, genetics or equivalent.\n\n• Strong organizational skills (attention to details).\n\n• Good basic computer skills. Experience with command line coding and basic bioinformatics software is preferred but not required.\n\n• Previous lab experience with animal husbandry (ideally fish) and molecular biology protocols is preferred but not required.\n\n• We would prefer for the candidate to remain in the position for at least 1 year, with a maximum of 2.5. The minimum time range is negotiable. Primary Job Duties\n\n• Perform stickleback and tapeworm genetics (husbandry, crosses).

This includes aspects of noninductive current drive such as helicon wave propagation. This post-doctoral research project addresses the support of the commissioning of a thermal helium beam diagnostic at the helicon antenna, to conduct characterization of the scrape-off layer in the DIII-D device with unprecedented detail and accuracy. In particular, the diagnostic will provide, for the first time, continuous electron density and temperature measurements in the interface between the high-performance plasma core and edge.
