It challenges the conventional wisdom that developing countries should take the financial structure of developed countries as the benchmark and financial structure does not matter in spurring long-run economic development. As a sub-discipline of New Structural Economics, New Structural Financial Economics has three tenets. First, examining the appropriate financial structure should take an economy's factor endowment structure as the starting point of analysis, which identifies its latent comparative advantage. Second, the appropriate financial structure is determined by the financing needs of the prevailing production structure. Third, a government should provide development financing to address market failures, and make tailored financial regulations in line with the characteristics of specific financial arrangements.

The initial focus was primarily on financial stability for preventing a repeat of the financial crisis. Recently, there has been an emerging debate on the broader role of finance in serving the real economy. Acute concerns have been raised on the accelerating process of “financialization” – by which the financial sector has become the dominant master of the broader economy, undercutting its role in serving the real economy (Reference EpsteinEpstein, 2005). Just as Professor Luigi Zingales, former president of the American Finance Association, argued in his presidential address to the American Finance Association, finance can easily degenerate into a rent-seeking activity without proper rules (Reference ZingalesZingales, 2015). He criticized that the financial sector is excessively indulging in speculative activities, undermining its function of serving the financing needs of the real economy.\n\nIf the primary role of finance is to serve the real economy, it is important to explore the core question of how finance can better meet the financing needs of the real economy. One prevailing perspective is that developing countries should use the financial structure of developed countries as the benchmark to reform their financial system in an effort to boost long-run economic growth. For instance, Reference Demirgüç-Kunt, Feyen and LevineDemirgüç-Kunt et al. (2011) construct a variable called “financial structure gap” to measure the deviation of actual financial structure from the estimated optimum, and use countries in the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) as the benchmark to compute the estimated optimal financial structure. The rationale behind using the financial structure of developed countries as the reference point is that these benchmark countries have “few impediments” to their financial systems (Reference Demirgüç-Kunt, Feyen and LevineDemirgüç-Kunt et al., 2011: 15). This approach is aligned with that of Reference Rajan and ZingalesRajan and Zingales (1998), which uses the United States as a benchmark for a perfectly functioning financial system. Yet this approach neglects the fact that production structures of developing countries often substantially differ from those of developed countries, and that different industrial sectors have distinct financing needs, which would defy a one-size-fits-all approach. Another prevailing perspective is that it is financial development, rather than financial structure, that matters in determining long-run economic growth. For instance, the World Bank’s flagship reports argue that what matters for economic growth is the overall development of the financial system, rather than the relative shares of banks and financial markets. Hence, the World Bank recommends that governments should devote efforts to enhance financial depth and develop enabling legal and regulatory environments instead of optimizing the financial structure (World Bank, 2002, 2013, 2014). Yet this approach fails to realize that different financial arrangements may have distinct comparative advantages in meeting specific financing needs of the real economy. For example, development banks are better positioned to provide long-term finance than are commercial banks (Reference Gong, Xu and YanGong et al., 2023; Reference Hu, Schclarek, Xu and YanHu et al., 2022; Reference Schclarek, Xu and YanSchclarek et al., 2023). Development banks usually do not take household deposits and rely on sovereign creditworthiness to issue long-term bonds on capital markets, which enables development banks to better solve the problem of maturity mismatch.\n\nCentering around how finance better serves the real economy, the present Element proposes the foundation and analytical framework of new structural financial economics (NSFE), which directly engages in the debates on whether developing countries should take the financial structure of developed countries as the benchmark and whether financial structure matters in spurring long-run economic development. NSFE is a subdiscipline of new structural economics (NSE), which reflects the spirit of Marxism’s historical materialism and uses the neoclassical approach as its tool for studying the determinants of economic structure and its evolution. From the NSE perspective, an economy consists of a set of interrelated structures, including factor endowment structure (such as labor, capital, and land), production structure (industries and technologies used by each industry), infrastructure (such as irrigation, road, power, and telecommunication), and superstructure (such as financial institution, custom, law, and value), or alternatively, in new institutional economics’ terminology, formal and informal institutions. In line with the spirit of historical materialism, NSE maintains that the production structure in an economy is endogenous to the economy’s endowments structure, which is given at any specific time and changeable over time. The rationale behind this proposition is that the factor endowment structure determines the economy’s latent comparative advantages in industries and technologies used by the industries, that is, the production structure with the lowest possible factor costs of production. To turn comparative advantages in an economy from latent to actual requires adequate infrastructure and superstructure to reduce transaction costs so that the total cost, including production cost and transaction cost, will be sufficiently low to make the industries competitive in domestic and international markets. This is because different technologies and industries in a production structure have different technical features, such as requirements for specific capital, skill and infrastructure, and economies of scale and risk, and thus require different appropriate infrastructure and superstructure. Otherwise, the lack of appropriate infrastructure and superstructure would result in high transaction costs for the industry’s production and its output’s trade. Governments can play a facilitating role in removing binding constraints in infrastructure and superstructure to reduce the transaction costs, which would help turn the comparative advantages of technologies and industries in a production structure from latent to actual. Therefore, the appropriate infrastructure and superstructure are endogenous to the production structure and ultimately to the factor endowment structure of the economy (Reference LinLin, 2012).\n\nNSFE aims to answer the following three related questions: (1) from the normative perspective, what determines the appropriate financial structure in an economy? (2) from the empirical perspective, what are the determinants of financial structure and its evolution in an economy? and (3) from the policy perspective, what is the adequate role of the state in the determination of the financial system and its evolution and how can it be enhanced? NSFE hopes to make three contributions: First, in line with the main idea of NSE, it emphasizes that the appropriate production structure in an economy at any given time is endogenously determined by the economy’s factor endowment structure at that time. Second, it emphasizes that the appropriate financial structure should be endogenously determined according to the financing needs of firms in the prevailing production structure at any given time. Hence, we need to consider the structural differences in factor endowments and production structures between developed countries and developing countries at different development stages to explore the appropriate financial structure that meets divergent financing needs of the real economy in pursuit of high-quality and sustainable development at different stages of development. Third, it emphasizes the synergies between the effective market – which is essential for providing relative factor prices that reflect the relative abundances of factor endowments to guide the entrepreneurs’ choices of industries and technologies so that the production structure is in line with the economy’s latent comparative advantages determined by the factor endowments – and the facilitating state – which is needed for overcoming market failures in the improvement of infrastructure and institutions so as to reduce transaction costs and turn comparative advantages from latent to actual in the economy. Hence, it proposes that a government should tailor its financial policies to improve the financial structure, tailor financial regulation, and adopt pragmatic financial reforms in line with the financing needs of its real economy at different development stages.\n\nThe rest of the Element proceeds as follows. In Section 2, we provide working definitions of financial structure and explore whether financial structure matters. From the NSFE perspective, financial structure refers to the relative weights of financial institutions with different features in a financial system. It can be measured from different analytical angles, which depend on the research question at hand. While acknowledging that realizing the functions of financial arrangements requires a supporting environment, as argued by the financial service view (Reference MertonMerton, 1995), NSFE rethinks this mainstream approach by emphasizing that different financial arrangements intrinsically have distinct comparative advantages in meeting divergent financing needs of the real economy. In Section 3, we examine the determinants of financial structures by reflecting on the limitations of the existing explanations and proposing an alternative hypothesis of how the production structure and its change drive the evolution of the financial structure from the NSFE perspective. In Section 4, we propose the analytical framework of NSFE by investigating the distinctive financing demands of the real economy, comparative advantages of different financial arrangements, and the match between divergent financing demands and appropriate financial arrangements, as well as exploring the methods of testing appropriate financial structures. In Section 5, we explore the role of the state in addressing market failures with a special focus on public development financial institutions (PDFIs) in case that commercial financial institutions and private capital markets do not meet the financing needs of the real economy, discuss how governments can make tailored financial regulations in line with the characteristics of specific financial arrangements, and finally examine why governments need to take the pragmatic approach to financial reforms rather than adopting shock therapy. In Section 6, we engage in dialogue with the financialization literature to emphasize that finance should serve the real economy. NSFE echoes the critiques that finance can easily degenerate into a rent-seeking activity and maintains that the principal role of finance is to serve the real economy by financing economic operation and productive investments instead of speculating on short-term returns. We diagnose why finance may be diverted from its principal role and propose how to ensure that finance can serve the real economy. Finally, we conclude with key findings.\n\n2 What Is Financial Structure? Does It Matter?\n\nIn this section, we examine what financial structure is, review the existing literature on whether it matters, and justify why it matters from the NSE perspective. The mainstream perspective holds that it is financial development rather than financial structure that matters in deciding long-run economic growth (Reference LevineLevine, 2002). This argument that financial structure does not matter echoes the Modigliani and Miller (MM) theorem, which argues that capital structure is of little relevance in deciding the market value of firms in a perfect and frictionless market. NSFE reflects on the limitations of this conventional wisdom and maintains that financial structure matters because different financial institutions have different comparative advantages in meeting the distinctive demands of the real economy, which has endogenous differences in its production structure at different stages of development.\n\n2.1 A Working Definition of Financial Structure\n\nA structure is defined as the ratio of different components that share common functions while having distinctive features. From the NSFE perspective, the financial structure refers to the relative weights of financial institutions with different features in the financial system. Though different financial institutions may have similar functions such as mobilizing savings, allocating resources, and managing risks, they have distinctive comparative advantages in meeting different demands of the real economy.\n\nThe existing literature has been primarily focused on two important aspects of financial structure: the relative importance of financial markets and banks in the financial system, and the distribution of banks of different sizes in the banking industry. Reference Beck and LevineBeck and Levine (1999) introduced a new database of indicators of financial development and structure across countries and over time. This database is unique in that it unites a wide variety of indicators that measure the size, activity, and efficiency of financial intermediaries vis-à-vis markets. The existing literature usually uses the proportion of the assets of the top N banks to measure the structure of big banks vis-à-vis small banks (Reference Beck, Demirgüç-Kunt and MaksimovicBeck et al., 2004). However, the aforementioned two prevailing measurements of financial structure are not exhaustive.\n\nFrom the NSFE perspective, financial structure can be measured in alternative ways, which depend on the research question. If we examine the relative merit of capital market versus banks in serving the financing demands of the high-tech industries, we can focus on whether financial activities need to pass through financial intermediaries and measure the financial structure by the ratio of financial markets to financial intermediaries. If we examine whether financial activities are regulated by the government, we can divide financial institutions into formal finance and informal finance. If we examine whether financial institutions are development-oriented or profit-driven, we can measure the financial structure as the relative weight of development banks to commercial banks.\n\n2.2 Does Financial Structure Matter?\n\nThe early literature maintains that financial structure matters, and debates which is better – bank-based or market-based financial systems (Reference Allen and GaleAllen & Gale, 2000; Reference DiamondDiamond, 1984; Reference Holmstrom and TiroleHolmstrom & Tirole, 1997). The principal-agent theory has often been used to underpin the models in the debates. The bank-based view highlights the positive role of banks in acquiring information about firms and managers and thereby improving capital allocation and corporate governance, managing liquidity risk, and thereby enhancing investment efficiency, mobilizing capital to exploit economies of scale (Reference Allen and GaleAllen & Gale, 1999; Reference DiamondDiamond, 1984; Reference Siri and TufanoSiri & Tufano, 1985). The market-based view highlights the growth-enhancing role of well-functioning markets in fostering greater incentives to conduct research, enhancing corporate governance by easing takeovers, and facilitating risk management (Reference Holmstrom and TiroleHolmstrom & Tirole, 1993; Reference Jensen and MurphyJensen & Murphy, 1990; Reference LevineLevine, 1991). Since Reference GoldsmithGoldsmith (1969) tried to explore the impact of financial structure upon economic growth, a large number of economists have continued to discuss which is better, bank-based or market-based financial systems, but there is still no consistent conclusion.\n\nLater on, the view that financial structure matters was challenged, as authors of empirical studies failed to find a statistically significant relationship between financial structure and economic performance using a more comprehensive dataset. Reference Allen and GaleAllen and Gale (2000) discussed financial systems in five industrial economies and found that the United States and the United Kingdom are market-based financial systems, while Germany, Japan, and France are bank-based financial systems. They noted that all five countries have similar long-run growth rates. The experiences of the five countries considered suggest that there is no optimal financial structure and a variety of financial structures can lead to high rates of growth in real per capita GDP. Reference LevineLevine (2002) constructed a broad cross-country dataset to examine market-based and bank-based financial systems. The results indicate that although overall financial development is robustly linked with economic growth, there is no support for either the bank-based or market-based view. Reference LevineBeck and Levine (2002) used cross-country and cross-industry regression analyses and found that having a bank-based or market-based system per se does not seem to greatly affect financing the expansion of industries that depend heavily on external finance, facilitating the formation of new establishments, and improving the efficiency of capital allocation across industries. The view that financial structure does not matter at the macro level echoes the classic theory of the MM theorem that capital structure is of little relevance in deciding the market value of firms at the microlevel. Reference Modigliani and MillerModigliani and Miller (1958) argued that in a perfect and frictionless financial system, the choice between debt and equity financing has no consequence for the market value of the firm or the cost of capital. The theory assumes that there is no income tax, information asymmetry, or agency cost in the financial market.\n\nThe prevailing view that financial structure does not matter is reinforced by the financial service view, which stresses that financial arrangements – contracts, markets, and intermediaries – arise to ameliorate market imperfections and provide financial services (Reference LevineLevine, 1997; Reference Merton and BodieMerton & Bodie, 2006). The financial services view argues that what matters is how the financial arrangements assess potential investment opportunities, exert corporate control, facilitate risk management, enhance liquidity, and ease savings mobilization. In short, the main issue is not banks versus markets. Instead, it is important to have different financial systems to provide efficient financial services to facilitate economic growth. Accordingly, the financial services view highlights how to create better-functioning banks or markets and relegates the bank-based versus market-based debate to the background.\n\nAn influential strand of the financial-services view is the law and finance view (Reference La Porta, Lopez-de-Silanes, Shleifer and VishnyLa Porta et al., 1997, Reference La Porta, Lopez-de-Silanes, Shleifer and Vishny1998). The law and finance view argues that finance is a set of contracts defined by legal rights and enforcement mechanisms. A good legal system can increase the confidence of investors and make them believe that investment can obtain reliable returns. As for whether investors invest through banks or stock markets, the channel itself is not important. This view has been supported by the empirical regression analysis that legal system efficiency boosts industry growth, new establishment formation, and efficient capital allocation (Reference LevineBeck & Levine, 2002).\n\n2.3 Why Financial Structure Matters from the NSFE Perspective\n\nWhile acknowledging that realizing the functions of financial arrangements requires a supporting environment, NSFE rethinks this mainstream approach by emphasizing that different financial arrangements intrinsically have distinct comparative advantages in meeting divergent financing needs of different industrial structures with different capital requirements and risk profiles for their operations and investments in the real economy. It also states that the structure of the real economy differs at different stages of development, causing the appropriate financial structure to be different accordingly.\n\nOne possible reason why the recent cross-country regression analysis has not identified a statistically significant association between financial structure and economic performance is that there is no optimal financial structure suitable for all countries. For instance, Reference Boyd and SmithBoyd and Smith (1998) argue that banks are particularly important at low levels of economic development. Reference Demirgüç-Kunt, Feyen and LevineDemirgüç-Kunt et al. (2013) empirically find that securities markets become more important as economies develop. Reference TadesseTadesse (2002) examined the relation between the financial structure and economic performance in the real sector. This author found that whereas market-based systems outperform bank-based systems among countries with developed financial sectors, bank-based systems fare better among countries with underdeveloped financial sectors. The preceding findings suggest that there is no one-size-fits-all optimal financial structure that can be applied across countries at different stages of economic development. From the NSFE perspective, while it is acknowledged that realizing the function of financial arrangements needs an enabling institutional environment, it maintains that the appropriate financial structure of economies at different stages of development hinges on distinctive and evolving financing needs of underlying production structures.\n\nOne strategic underlying assumption behind the MM theorem is that firms can be divided into “equivalent return” classes such that the return on the shares issued by any firm in any given class is proportional to (and hence perfectly correlated with) the return on the shares issued by any other firm in the same class (Reference Modigliani and MillerModigliani & Miller, 1958: 266). This assumption neglects the substantial variation in the industrial structure to which firms belong and thus the capital requirement, size, and sources of risk of firms. The empirical evidence shows that firms from different industries have distinctive capital structures. For instance, large, integrated oil companies from technologically mature industries have relied mostly on debt for external financing, whereas the major pharmaceutical companies with huge technological risks typically operate at negative debt ratios (Reference MyersMyers, 2001). Although authors of the existing studies have explored how firm characteristics may affect capital structures, it is worth investigating the extent to which firm characteristics may be influenced by production structures where firms are embedded. Hence, it is promising to explore how industrial characteristics may affect the appropriate capital structure for firms.\n\nIn summary, NSFE argues that financial structure matters when examining how finance can best service the real economy, which has different production structures at different stages of development. NSFE maintains that different financial arrangements have their own advantages and disadvantages in mobilizing savings, dispersing risks, and allocating funds. NSFE is not defying the role of institutions in realizing the functions of financial arrangements, but it emphasizes that certain functions are not perfectly substitutable across different financial arrangements.\n\n3 Determinants of Financial Structures\n\nIn this section, we first document the variation in financial structures across countries and over time, evaluate the merits and limitations of the existing explanations of what accounts for such variations, and arrive at alternative explanations from the NSFE perspective.\n\n3.1 Variation in Financial Structures\n\nThere are substantial variations in the financial structure across countries and over time. Taking the financial structure measured by the relative weight of financial markets to banks as an example, Reference Lin, Sun and JiangLin et al. (2013) showed the evolution of financial structure across income groups and over time and identified the following stylized facts: first, the cross-country data shows that the more developed the economy, the higher the share of the stock market in the financial structure; second, the time-series data reveals that the share of the stock market in the financial structure tends to gain more weight as economies move to a more advanced stage of development. The history of the financial structure of the United Kingdom and the United States confirms that large banks and stock markets are playing an increasingly important role in the financial system as economies grow. During the English Industrial Revolution, industrial enterprises were typically extremely small. Interestingly, the English banks were also typically small and locally based with a limited number of offices until at least the mid-nineteenth century. The bank merger movement in England did not arise until the 1860s; it was not until 1918 that the “Big Five” banks came to dominate the English banking system. The London capital market, despite its current prominent role in the national and international financial system, did not make any significant direct contribution to capital formation in the English Industrial Revolution. It was not until the end of the nineteenth century that the capital market started to play an important role in financing industrial sectors. In the United States, before 1890, industrial firms were numerous, small, and closely owned by a limited number of shareholders. As late as the end of the ninete enth century, it was still rare for manufacturing or other non-infrastructural firms to be listed on exchanges. In fact, there was no large-scale market in common stocks prior to 1920. A variety of local financial institutions emerged to meet the needs of small and medium-sized firms in the economy (Reference Lin, Sun and JiangLin et al., 2013).\n\nFurthermore, there are variations in financial structure among countries even within the same income group. Figure 1 shows substantial differences in the financial structure among the United Kingdom, the United States, Germany, and Japan. The financial structure of the United Kingdom and the United States was more dominated by the stock market, whereas the financial structure of Germany and Japan was more dominated by banks before 2000. Nevertheless, the financial structures in these four advanced countries converge to a similar profile after 2000.\n\nData source: World Bank, Global Financial Development Database.\n\n3.2 The Existing Explanations of Variation in Financial Structures\n\nTo explain why the financial structure of Germany and Japan was bank-based whereas that of the United Kingdom and the United States was market-based, one existing explanation argues that legal origin matters – civil law countries have much weaker investor protection than common law countries, resulting in less developed capital markets (Reference La Porta, Lopez-de-Silanes, Shleifer and VishnyLa Porta et al., 1997). Using a sample of forty-nine countries, Reference La Porta, Lopez-de-Silanes, Shleifer and VishnyLa Porta et al. (1997) found that weak investor protection in civil law countries, as measured by both the possibility of legal rules in protecting investors and a survey-based estimate of the quality of law enforcement, is associated with the underdevelopment of capital markets.\n\nHowever, the “legal origin” theory cannot explain the puzzle of why the ratio of France’s stock market capitalization to GDP was twice as high as that of the United States in 1913 (Reference Rajan and ZingalesRajan & Zingales, 2003) and why the financial strucure in the mjaor developed countries have been converging after 2000 as shown in Figure 1. If this theory holds water, we would expect that the stock market in France was much less developed than the US stock market. Furthermore, the “legal origin” theory is of little use in explaining changes in financial structure over time, given that the legal origin is a time-invariant variable. For instance, despite their current prominent role in the national financial system, capital markets did not start to play an important role in financing industrial sectors in the United Kingdom until the end of the nineteenth century (Reference CollinsCollins, 1988). In fact, the financial structure of the United Kingdom was bank-based during the Industrial Revolution: because industrial enterprises were typically extremely small, the English banks had been small and locally based until at least the mid-nineteenth century (Reference CameronCameron, 1992; Reference Cameron, Crisp, Patrick and TillyCameron et al., 1967). This bank-based pattern has also been applied to the early history of the US financial system (Reference Cull, Davis, Lamoreaux and RosenthalCull et al., 2006).\n\nAnother strand of theory holds that culture matters in explaining variations in the financial structure. Reference Stulz and WilliamsonStulz and Williamson (2003) argued that differences in cultures, proxied by differences in religion and language, cannot be ignored when examining why investor protection differs across countries. After controlling for the legal origin, they found that civil law Protestant countries have stronger creditor rights than civil law Catholic countries. Hence, they concluded that although legal origin matters in explaining variations in shareholder rights, culture plays a key role in explaining the variation in creditor right protection. Hence, they infer that Catholic countries may have less developed debt markets. Similar to the legal origin theory, the culture theory maintains that the protection of investor rights, including both shareholder rights and creditor rights, is crucial for fostering certain types of financial arrangements.\n\nYet, the culture theory may be of little help in explaining changes in financial structure over time because culture, such as the principal region or language, is relatively stable. Another major limitation is that both the legal origin theory and the culture theory assume that a particular form of legal or cultural tradition is necessary for enforcing financial agreements. Consequently, they may neglect viable alternative institutional arrangements that can perform the same function (Reference LinLin 1989). For instance, Reference Miao, Niu and NoeMiao et al. (2021) documented that a large bank loan market – the trusted assistant loan market in nineteenth-century China – emerged even in the absence of contracting institutions. They argued that the repayment of trusted assistants was enforced through expertise leverage, which was sufficiently strong to implement enforceable financial agreements and support a large lending market.\n\nA third strand of literature argues that history matters. Reference Monnet and QuintinMonnet and Quintin (2007) presented a dynamic, general equilibrium model in which past fundamentals of an economy (including the cost of bank intermediation, the cost of entry on the financial market, and the distribution of project characteristics) justify a unique, efficient path for its financial system. For instance, they argued that the reason why the United States is a market-based financial system whereas Germany is a bank-based one is that federal laws discouraged bank intermediation in the United States while Germany used to impose significant legal barriers to entry into financial markets. Therefore, despite the convergence in the legal framework, the financial structure in the United States and Germany continues to vary markedly. Although path dependency may play a role in the development of financial institutions, it still begs the question of why governments foster certain types of financial arrangement while depressing others at the initial phase and why they all converged to a similar financial structure once they reached the same advanced development stage.\n\n3.3 The NSFE Perspective\n\nFrom the NSE perspective, production structure, namely the combination of different industries and different technologies used in each industry, determines the financing demand and firm’s risk profile of the real economy. Production structure in an economy is endogenous to the economy’s factor endowments structure because the factor endowments structure determines the economy’s comparative advantages and thus the appropriate technologies and industries; the endowments structure is given at any specific time and changeable over time, and correspondingly, the production structure of the economy varies (Reference LinLin, 2012). From the NSFE perspective, a key determinant of financial structure is production structure because the role of finance is to serve the real economy’s operation and investment. If we define the financial structure as the relative weight of banks versus capital markets, NSFE would predict that high-income countries are likely to develop full-fledged capital markets to meet the financing needs of the industrial structure that is at the global technological frontier and relies on costly and risky R&D for technological innovation and industrial upgrading. The rationale is that banks are more appropriate for the financing of traditional asset-intensive industries, whereas capital markets favor innovative and risky projects. Reference Allen, Bartiloro, Gu and KowalewskiAllen et al. (2018) deployed a panel dataset of 108 countries over the sample period 1972–2015 to test whether countries with predominant tangible-asset-intensive industries are more likely to exhibit a bank-based financial system. Furthermore, they used a difference-in-difference strategy to conduct event studies by exploring how the financial structure responds to shocks to the industrial structure. They found that the stock markets experienced significantly faster growth than the banking system after the service sector gained more importance. From this perspective, the variation in the financial structure between the United States and Germany lies in the divergence in their industrial structure. Financial systems in countries such as Germany would remain bank-based as long as their economies are dominated by manufacturing industries. By contrast, the financial system in the United States will continue to be market-oriented as long as service and highly innovative companies constitute a large share of the economy. From the NSFE perspective, although we acknowledge that the industrial structure matters in determining the appropriate financial structure, we further highlight that technological structures are of equal importance. For instance, within the manufacturing sector, some industries are at the global technological frontier, which relies more on capital markets to mobilize large-scale and high-risk capital for innovations, whereas others use mature technologies that may depend on banks for financing.\n\nIn summary, although the legal origin, culture, and history play a role in explaining the variation in financial structure, they have limitations in explaining the changes in the financial structure over time. The NSFE draws our attention to the analytical angle of how changes in financing needs of the real economy drive the adjustment in financial systems. This perspective helps to explain the variation in the financial structure across countries and the evolution of the financial structure within a country that are unresolved by the existing theories.\n\n4 Determinants of the Appropriate Financial Structure and Empirical Testing\n\nThis section lays out the analytical framework of the NSFE. As emphasized in the Introduction, NSFE maintains that the principal role of finance is to serve the real economy. Hence, to examine the appropriate financial structure, it is important to first analyze distinctive financing needs of the real economy at different stages of development. Then, given the divergent financing needs at different stages of development, we can take a step further to explore comparative advantages of different financial arrangements in meeting the financing demand of the real economy. In contrast with the prevailing view that argues that it is the scale of financial system rather than its structure that matters in promoting economic growth (Reference LevineLevine, 2002), NSFE contends that this strand of literature pays little attention to the distinctive financing demands of the real economy at different stages of development and their implications for the appropriate financial arrangements. In comparison with the mainstream financial service view that emphasizes that functions provided by different financial arrangements are fungible, NSFE argues that one type of financial arrangement may be better positioned to perform a certain function than others as far as specific financing needs of the real economy is concerned. From the perspective of NSFE, only when the supply of the financial structure fits the demand of the production structure can the financial structure be appropriately positioned to serve the real economy (see Figure 2 on the analytical framework of the appropriate financial structure). Given the fact that production structure differs at different development stages, the appropriate financial structure should evolve to meet changing financing needs of the real economy. Hence, NSFE questions the mainstream perspective which contends that there is a one-size-fits-all optimal financial structure for all countries regardless of their stages of development.\n\nIn this section, we proceeds as follows: first, we explore how financing demands of the real economy differ at different stages of development; second, we analyze the comparative advantages of different financial arrangements in serving the real economy as far as the distinctive financing needs are concerned; third, we propose how to match the financing demand of the real economy with the supply of financial structure; finally, we make a preliminary discussion on methods about how to empirically test the appropriate financial structure.\n\n4.1 Distinctive Demand of the Real Economy\n\nFrom the NSFE perspective, grasping the financing needs of the real economy is of paramount importance in answering what the appropriate financial structure is and why there are substantial differences in the financial structure across different countries. This section delves deeper into the distinctive financing needs of the real economy which lays the foundation for examining comparative advantages of different financial arrangements in meeting specific financing needs.\n\nWhen an economy develops from the early stage to the advanced stage in modern times, the proportion of agriculture in the industrial structure gradually falls, while that of manufacturing and services tends to rise (Reference KuznetsKuznets, 1946). During the process, the production structure evolves from labor-intensive to capital-intensive and technology-intensive. Different technologies and industries have different technical features, such as requirements for specific capital, skill and infrastructure, and economies of scale and risk, and thus they have distinctive demands for financing to meet the required size of investment and operation and to cope with the innate risks. For example, Reference OzawaOzawa (2007) noted that the industrial structure of Japan has undergone four stages of development dominated by labor-intensive industries, capital-intensive heavy industry and chemical industry, capital-intensive automobile industry, and R&D-intensive electronic industry, respectively, after World War II. Reference Ju, Lin and WangJu et al. (2015) showed that the capital intensity increased over time within each industry in the United States during the period 1958–2005.\n\n4.1.1 Financing Demand of Developing Economies\n\nAt the early stage of economic development, labor-intensive industries are usually prevailing in the production structure. Firms in these industries are often smaller compared with those in capital-intensive industries. For instance, based on the distribution of firm size across industries in fifteen European countries, Reference Kumar, Rajan and ZingalesKumar et al. (1999) pointed out that the average firm size in capital-intensive industries is larger. Hence, in developing countries, small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) are predominant in production structures (Reference GollinGollin, 2008; Reference TyboutTybout, 2000).\n\nFirm size matters because it is closely related to the financing scale and information transparency of the firm. Small firms in the labor-intensive industries often require a small amount of external financing owing to the limited scale of investment, production, and sale. Small firms are also more opaque owing to the lack of standard financial information and sufficient credit records compared with large firms with more extended financial history and audited financial statements. Thus, small firms tend to suffer from more severe information asymmetry when seeking external financing.\n\nWith respect to the type of risks, firms from labor-intensive industries suffer more from the entrepreneur risk than from technology risk or market risk. Because labor-intensive industries have already existed in developed countries, their technology is relatively mature and the market demand for their products has been tested. Firms in such industries in developing countries can imitate or attract foreign direct investment to learn from the existing technology and managerial experience in developed countries. For instance, the four East Asian Tigers (South Korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong, and Singapore) have utilized their latecomer advantages to achieve rapid economic growth. Compared with original innovation in advanced capital-intensive industries at the global technological frontier, firms in labor-intensive industries can adopt existing technology to produce mature product and face lower technology innovation risk and product innovation risk. By contrast, the entrepreneur risk – that is, uncertainties about managers’ ability and integrity – is rife among firms in labor-intensive industries. Exacerbated by information asymmetry, moral hazard problems of managers may be more severe for opaque SMEs. In addition, start-ups are often small businesses wherein managers may lack relevant experience and knowledge in corporate governance, which may result in a higher risk of failure and bankruptcy. Moreover, small labor-intensive firms often have few assets that can be used for collateral.\n\nIn short, financing firms in labor-intensive industries from developing economies are characterized by small scale, opaqueness, entrepreneur risks, and often lack of suitable collateral.\n\n4.1.2 Financing Demand of Developed Economies\n\nAt the advanced stage of economic development, capital-intensive and technology-intensive industries often account for a lion’s share of the production structure. Such industries have distinctive financing demands compared with mature labor-intensive industries. Firms in capital-intensive and technology-intensive industries often require and favor a large amount of external financing for at least two reasons. First, their capital expenditure is large because capital- and technology-intensive firms need to purchase machinery equipment and develop new technology and products. Second, economies of scale can help to save costs and enhance competitiveness. Obtaining external financing entails transaction costs such as expenses on financial audit, information disclosure, and contract negotiation and implementation. Because such expenditures are often fixed, the unit cost of capital will decrease when the amount of financing increases. Thus, large-scale financing is more typical in capital-intensive industries owing to their distinctive financing needs. In addition, a capital-intensive firm’s equipment and factory facility are good collaterals.\n\nFurthermore, firms in the high-tech industries usually face significant technological innovation risk and product innovation risk because they engage in research and development as well as innovative activities. The innovation process tends to be idiosyncratic, long term, unpredictable, and with a high probability of failure (Reference HolmstromHolmstrom, 1989). Such features are more likely to impede effective communication between external finance providers and those firms owing to severe information asymmetry (Reference Bhattacharya and RitterBhattacharya & Ritter, 1980). Meanwhile, for firms operating in some new industries, there are still many uncertainties in the product market even if they achieve successful R&D. In fact, it takes time for consumers to be familiar with and develop a taste for brand-new products. Finally, those products might not be accepted by the market, especially when the competition for homogeneous products is fierce.\n\nIn summary, the financing demand of firms in developed economies is often characterized by larger scales and higher innovation risks.\n\n4.2 Comparative Advantages of Different Financial Arrangements\n\nFinancial institutions serve the real economy by performing functions such as mobilizing savings, allocating capital, and diversifying risks. Different financial institutions have different comparative advantages in performing these functions because they have distinctive organizational forms, modalities, and ways to cope with information asymmetry and moral hazard. As a result, when one financial institution defies its comparative advantages in serving firms or industries, it would undermine the efficiency of this financial institution. For example, if a small bank provides loans to a firm engaging in R&D for a new technology, it will have difficulties to diversify risks. Hence, to enhance the efficiency of the financial system in serving the real economy, it is essential to identify the comparative advantages of different financial arrangements. In the following, we will examine selected financial arrangements to illustrate why different financial arrangements have distinctive comparative advantages.\n\nThe remaining section proceeds as follows: we first focus on the widely examined financial arrangements – banks versus the stock market. Then we examine the differences in comparative advantages between big and small banks, and shed light on how digital technology shapes the comparative advantage of digital finance. Finally, we analyze the comparative advantages of informal finance vis-à-vis formal finance in financing the real economy.\n\n4.2.1 Banks Versus the Stock Market\n\nStock markets are well positioned to diversify risks and finance high-risk projects of technology-intensive industries. In the stock market, investors have full autonomy to allocate their funds. Once investors become the shareholders by purchasing firms’ stocks, they will share both profits and risks of firms. Owing to this sharing mechanism, higher expected returns can induce investors to endure higher risks and tolerate short-term failure. Meanwhile, the stock market provides flexible instruments and approaches for investors to diversify and manage idiosyncratic risks, which encourages investors to shift their portfolios toward innovative activities (Reference LevineLevine, 2005). Such features give the stock market advantages in serving innovative firms, which is supported by numerous empirical studies (Reference Brown, Martinsson and PetersenBrown et al., 2013; Reference Bertrand, Mehta and MullainathanCarpenter & Peterson, 2002; Reference Moshirian, Tian, Zhang and ZhangMoshirian et al., 2021). Based on cross-country data, Reference Hsu, Tian and XuHsu et al. (2014) found that the positive effect of the stock market on economic development is more significant when the industries are more high-tech-intensive in these economies.\n\nMoreover, the stock market is appropriate for large-scale financing of capital-intensive industries. The stock market relies on firms’ information disclosure mechanism to mitigate information asymmetry between financers and investors. Information disclosure, however, requires certain fixed costs, such as the expense on the preparation of standard financial annual reports and audits by a third party. The unit cost of capital is high if the amount of financing is small. Hence, it is more suitable for large firms from capital-intensive industries to raise large-scale capital on the stock market owing to the benefits of the economies of scale.\n\nCompared with stock markets, banks have little advantage in serving R&D and innovation activities. Banks raise savings from depositors and grant loans to firms. Firms are obliged to repay the principal and interest on time; otherwise, they would face liquidation if they are on default. Innovative firms tend to lack stable and sufficient internal cash flow to service the debts according to a fixed schedule and hence might face a high probability of liquidation (Reference Brown, Martinsson and PetersenBrown et al., 2013). Banks often take a conservative attitude toward such innovation projects because they need to ensure repayments on time. Meanwhile, banks do not share the high profits if innovation projects turn out to be successful because firms simply repay principal and interest rates. As a result, banks lack incentives to provide financial support for firms in high-tech industries.\n\nBanks are more suitable for financing small firms in labor-intensive industries. Based on a cross-countries dataset, Reference Kim, Lin and ChenKim et al. (2016) found that the relatively small firms grow faster in those countries where banks dominate the financial system. First, banks have the superior ability to harness local information and engage in longer-term relationships with firms, which can alleviate the information asymmetry when funding these small and opaque firms (Reference SharpeSharpe, 1990). In addition, banks can also utilize the collateral to overcome the reverse selection and moral hazard of borrowers (Reference Berger and UdellBerger & Udell, 1990). Second, as the specialized financial intermediaries, banks are good at screening and monitoring firms, which is critical to managing entrepreneur risk in these small firms (Reference Chakraborty and RayChakraborty & Ray, 2006; Reference DiamondDiamond, 1984).\n\n4.2.2 Big Banks versus Small Banks\n\nThe existing literature suggests that specialization on scale exists in banking, where big banks tend to shun away from small firms but instead focus on big firms, while small banks mainly target small firms (Reference Berger and UdellBerger & Udell 1995; Reference Berger, Klapper and UdellBerger et al., 2001, Reference Berger, Miller, Petersen, Rajan and Stein2005; Reference HuberHuber, 2021). Underlying such a match are significant differences between the two types of banks, especially in diversifying risks, transaction costs, and the way of addressing information asymmetry.\n\nBig banks can often afford large-scale loans for the following reasons. First, big banks have a superior ability to take deposits owing to their widely distributed branches, while small banks tend to focus on the local market with relatively small coverage of businesses. Hence, big banks have more funds to provide to the borrowers than small banks. Second, banks tend to diversify risks by simultaneously serving multiple firms. After the diversification, small banks often struggle to afford large loans, whereas big banks can still provide large-scale loans to big firms.\n\nMeanwhile, big banks favor large firms owing to the transaction cost and information type. First, making a loan, regardless of its scale, usually involves the same routine procedures such as information collection, ex-ante screening, and filling in a similar number of forms. When big banks grant loans to large firms, the unit costs of loans for banks decrease owing to economies of scale. Second, the organizational structure of big banks enables them to better process the hard information. Big banks tend to own multiple layers of management. The lending decisions are often made by senior bank officers in an upper branch rather than by the head of a local branch. Such characteristics of the hierarchy determine that big banks rely more on hard information that can be easily observed, conveyed, and verified (Reference PetersenPetersen, 2004; Reference SteinStein, 2002). By contrast, it is often difficult for small firms to provide standard information. Meanwhile, big firms in general have more assets that can be used for collaterals than small firms. Hence, for big banks, it is more efficient to serve the large firms with sufficient hard information and collateral.\n\nConversely, small banks have comparative advantages in serving small firms owing to their capability to collect and process soft information. First, small banks are usually involved in frequent and long-term contact with local small firms, which allows them to more easily collect soft information such as entrepreneurs’ management abilities and personal characteristics. Second, the organizational structure of small banks is often simple. Hence, they are more capable of harnessing nonstandard soft information. Hence, small banks can assess the credit risks for small firms in a more efficient manner.\n\n4.2.3 Digital Finance and Traditional Finance\n\nDigital finance is the deep integration of finance and digital technology such as big data, artificial intelligence, blockchain, and cloud computing. Research efforts have been made to identify and examine the changes that digital finance brings about in the credit market (Reference MorseMorse, 2015; Reference ThakorThakor, 2020). Reference TangTang (2019) found that peer-to-peer (P2P) platform lending, which has surged after the 2008 financial crisis, complements bank lending in terms of small loans. Reference Fuster, Plosser, Schnabl and VickeryFuster et al. (2019) documented that the market share of fintech lenders in the mortgage lending market increased from 2 percent to 8 percent during the period 2010–16.\n\nDespite the rapid rise of fintech or P2P lending, the credit extended by traditional financial intermediaries remains predominant (Reference Claessens, Coleman and DonnellyClaessens et al., 2018). From the perspective of NSFE, digital finance and traditional finance are not diametrical, and their relative growth is subject to their comparative advantages and the characteristics of typical firms in the real economy.\n\nTaking the fintech lending and traditional bank credits as an example, one main difference lies in the amount and nature of the information used in the lending decision. Traditional banks tend to rely on standard data such as financial reports and credit history to assess the credit risks and confirm the creditworthiness of borrowers, which usually excludes small opaque firms lacking standard financial information and a track record of credit history. By contrast, fintech companies, which provide loans via big data tools combined with artificial intelligence, are good at gathering and processing borrowers’ nonstandard information (e.g., the digital footprints of the individuals or firms while navigating the Internet). With such capabilities, fintech lenders have the comparative advantage in serving small firms, especially those with digital footprints. Thus, when conducting local economic activities with fewer digital records or less access to the Internet, traditional banks are more efficient in providing lending services than fintech companies.\n\nDigital technology can also shape the comparative advantages of traditional banking. As mentioned in Section 4.2.2, big banks tend to be at a disadvantage when funding small firms because they encounter the difficulty of processing soft information. Big banks are also unwilling to finance small firms, because the loan size of small firms is much smaller than that of large firms although both require the same loan approval procedure. Thus, when big banks lend to small firms, they would face higher transaction cost of per unit amount of loan. However, this deficiency can be overcome when big banks invest in and adopt digital technology, which reduces the opaqueness of information and transaction cost. Therefore, big banks can enhance their capability to fund small firms and may be able to provide loans to small firms, which used to be served by small banks. Consequently, the determinant of the appropriate financial structure might change from “firm size” to the “digital endowments” (i.e., the abundance of firms’ digital data).\n\n4.2.4 Formal Finance versus Informal Finance\n\nInformal financing generally refers to financing that occurs without a formal financial intermediary between savers and borrowers where there is little reliance on a court of law and little faith in the ability to seize collaterals, including but not restricted to microfinance, trade credit, interpersonal borrowing (money from friends or families), private money houses, pawnshops, and so on, while formal financing mainly refers to banks, stock markets, and bond markets (Reference Allen, Qian and XieAllen et al., 2019; Reference Ghosh and RayGhosh & Ray, 2016).\n\nWhy is informal financing still broadly used despite the injection of formal credit as documented by Reference Siamwalla, Pinthong and PoapongsakornSiamwalla et al. (1990) and Reference Bell, Srintvasan and UdryBell et al. (1997)? One strand of the literature stresses the superior information advantage as well as risk assessment of informal financing through business relations or social networks (Reference Banerjee, Besley and GuinnaneBanerjee et al., 1994; Reference JainJain, 1999; Reference StiglitzStiglitz, 1990; Reference GineGine, 2011). For example, Reference StiglitzStiglitz (1990) argues that the local moneylenders have more detailed knowledge of borrowers compared with formal financial institutions, which can be used to separate out high-risk and low-risk borrowers and monitor the borrowers more effectively. Another strand of the literature argues that informal financing is the result of financial repression for which formal financing such as commercial banks cannot sufficiently fund some credit-rationed firms, especially small businesses (Reference Bell, Srintvasan and UdryBell et al., 1997; Reference McKinnonMcKinnon, 1973; Reference Montiel, Agenor and HaqueMontiel et al., 1993; Reference TresselTressel, 2003). As Reference Bell, Srintvasan and UdryBell et al. (1997) demonstrate, there will be a spillover of unsatisfied demand into the informal segment of the financing market in response to the extensive credit rationing in the formal segment when governments impose a ceiling on the rate of interest that institutions may charge.\n\nYet, the existing literature fails to fully explain why informal finance emerged. Financial repression may not be the root cause, since informal financing still widely exists even after the financial liberalization reform in many developing countries. It also fails to explain the limitations of informal finance in serving certain kinds of financing demands. For instance, if informal financing has a superior information advantage compared with banks and equity markets as assumed in the existing theoretical work, why does formal financing such as banks emerge?\n\nFrom the NSFE perspective, to explain the emergence of informal finance as well as the relative importance informal finance vis-à-vis formal finance one has to consider the characteristics of financing demands in the real economy. Informal finance primarily serves small-scale and relatively low-risk individuals or firms. Informal financing such as trade credit and interpersonal borrowing has advantages in information production and contract enforcement based on closed business relationships or social networks. Take microfinance as an example, which is prevalent worldwide. Microfinance mainly consists of group lending, developed from rotating savings and credit associations (ROSCAs) and credit cooperatives, providing financial services to micro enterprises and poor households that may otherwise lack access to financing with the goal of alleviating poverty and promoting development. Microfinance has comparative advantages in servicing micro enterprises and rural households owing to the jointly liability mechanism – that is, a group of individuals who are familiar with each other within a local region (such as a village) hold joint liability. Micro enterprises and rural households are characterized by extremely small scale and soft information that are hard to verify or transmit. Compared with banks, microfinance is more efficient in preventing the moral hazard of clients (such as micro enterprises and rural households), adverse selection, and enforcement problems (Reference Armendáriz and MorduchArmendáriz & Morduch, 2000; Reference Armendáriz and Morduch2010). Hence, for microfinance, it is efficient to serve micro enterprises and rural households.\n\nHowever, the size of informal financing and the geographical distance between borrowers and lenders are constrained by the strong reliance on this local information. Meanwhile, informal financing cannot function effectively in a cross-regional manner, that is, to absorb funds in a region and lend to firms or individuals in another region. That’s why formal finance such as banks and equity markets emerge. The development of formal finance is endogenous to the increasing demand for large-scale money and high-risk money in order to make up the gaps in informal financing. As for scale, the amount that can be financed from informal sources, especially that from friends and families, is small since these money providers cannot absorb money from the outside in the manner of issuing deposits or securities as the banks and equity markets do. As for risk management, when the risk is relatively low, informal financing can easily handle it by closely monitoring the borrowers. Yet it may not be the case as the risk becomes higher since the money providers of informal financing in a deal are usually composed of only a few individuals and the risk is concentrated. Formal finance such as banks and equity markets can effectively deal with these problems arising from the larger-scale and higher-risk money demand. As can be seen, large banks can provide large-scale loans to large firms that have such demands using the deposits absorbed in different regions, and stock markets can effectively share the risk among a large number of investors.\n\n4.3 Match between the Financing Demand and Supply\n\nThe NSFE maintains that an appropriate financial structure matches the financing demand of firms within a certain production structure with comparative advantages of different financial arrangements. Because the production structure varies across different development stages, the appropriate financial structure should differ as well. The appropriate financial structure at the early stage of a developing country should enable financial sectors to meet the demands of labor-intensive industries such as garments and footwear. Firms in these labor-intensive industries are often small, opaque, and with a low-level innovation risk. Owing to the comparative advantages of harnessing soft information, small local banks are more appropriate to provide external financing for such firms. Hence the financial system of a developing country at the early stage should be characterized by the dominance of small banks.\n\nAs economies grow, firms in the labor-intensive industries often increase their capital inputs and upgrade their technology level, which induces the emergence of some large-sized enterprises. In this case, big banks and capital markets may emerge. However, such external financing demand is limited because small firms still dominate in the production structure. Hence, small banks will still play a critical role. Meanwhile, technological development might enable those small firms to produce and accumulate certain digital footprints. Under such a situation, small firms can rely on digital finance, such as fintech firms, to seek external finance.\n\nAs economies move to the advanced stage, capital-intensive industries and technology-intensive industries dominate. Firms in such industries tend to require large amounts of external financing and face high risks, including technology innovation and product innovation. The stock market and big banks are more suitable to serve those firms, whereas small banks are no longer able to diversify risks and provide large-scale financing. In addition, with the increasing digital level of enterprises, digital finance will play an increasingly significant role. Overall, the financial structure should be dominated by the stock market and big banks in advanced economies.\n\n4.4 A Preliminary Discussion on Methods of Empirical Testing of Appropriate Financial Structure\n\nAs already explained, NSFE argues that only when the comparative advantages of financial structure match well with financing needs of the production structure determined by the economy’s endowment structure can the financial system effectively perform its functions of mobilizing funds, allocating funds, and diversifying risks so as to contribute to sustainable economic development. Therefore, as the financing needs of the underlying production structure differ, the appropriate financial structure would differ at different stages of development. This section explores how to build on the existing empirical literature to better test the theories on appropriate financial structure.\n\nOne strand of the existing literature regresses economic performance on financial structure by using the country-, industry-, and firm-level data. Reference LevineLevine (2002) constructs an assortment of measures for forty-eight countries over the 1980–95 period. The data analysis does not provide any evidence supporting the theories that favor either the bank-based or market-based perspectives. Categorizing countries based on their financial structure does not contribute to explaining the differences in long-term economic performance across nations. Instead, when countries are categorized based on their overall level of financial development, it finds a positive correlation between financial development and economic growth. Reference LevineBeck and Levine (2002) use the data of thirty-six industries in forty-two countries from 1980 to 1990 to empirically test the impact of financial development and financial structure on industry growth and capital allocation. The results show that the overall level of financial development and the legal environment play a crucial role in explaining the differences in the number of establishments within industries that rely on external financing across countries, and the impact of financial structure upon economic growth is not statistically significant. Reference Demirgüç-Kunt and MaksimovicDemirgüç-Kunt and Maksimovic (2002) investigate whether firms’ access to external financing to fund growth differs in market-based and bank-based financial systems. Using firm-level data for forty countries, the paper computes the proportion of firms in each country relying on external finance and examines how that proportion differs across financial systems, and finds that the development of a country’s legal system predicts access to external finance. Yet there is no evidence that the development of a market-based or bank-based financial system per se affects access to financing. The above literature mentioned in this paragraph assumes that there is an optimal financial structure for all countries. Yet from the NSFE perspective, the potential reason why the coefficient of financial structure is statistically insignificant is that there is no single optimal financial structure for all countries. Hence, statistical insignificance does not necessarily mean that financial structure lacks economic significance.\n\nAnother strand of literature holds that the relative importance of banks and financial markets depends on different stages of development. Reference TadesseTadesse (2002) uses a sample of thirty-six countries from 1980 to 1995, and finds that in countries with an underdeveloped financial system, bank-based systems outperform market-based systems. This paper constructs an interaction term between financial architecture and firm size, and then examines the relation between financial architecture and economic performance across countries of differing distribution of firm size, which finds that this correlation is significantly negative in the lowest quartile of countries on the average firm-size scale and significantly positive in the highest quartile of countries. Reference Demirgüç-Kunt, Feyen and LevineDemirgüç-Kunt et al. (2013) examine the evolving importance of banks and securities markets during the process of economic development. The paper finds that with the growth of economic activities, the association between an increase in real output and that in bank development decreases, while the association between an increase in real output and that in securities market development becomes larger. The results suggest that as economies develop, the services provided by securities markets become more important for economic activity, while those provided by banks become less important.\n\nThese efforts have primarily focused on association or correlation between financial structure and economic development, and have not adequately addressed the underlying causal mechanisms. In order to mitigate the potential endogeneity concerns, Reference Allen, Bartiloro, Gu and KowalewskiAllen et al. (2018) conduct event studies using a difference-in-difference strategy, and explore the shocks to the structure of the real economy and investigate how the financial structure responds to such shocks. They use different shocks that alter the economic structures in India, Finland, Sweden, and South Korea. In all these countries the shocks resulted in the significant development of the service sector relative to the industry sector. Consequently, these countries move toward more market-based financial systems. Yet this approach is not free from limitations. First, country selection may not be random. Second, for those policies that cause such shocks, they may not only affect the economic structure but also the financial structure.\n\nTo further mitigate the endogeneity problem, structural estimation may be deployed to make the counterfactual analysis to test the causal relationship. Structural estimation is an attempt to estimate an economic model’s parameters and assess the model fit, which allows it to answer counterfactual questions such as what would happen if we shocked this variable and how would the world look if we changed this parameter’s value. Although strategies such as difference-in-difference, regression discontinuity, and randomized controlled trials have been popular in empirical research in search for robust identification of causal effects, structural estimation can still be a potent complementary tool to help disentangle alternative mechanisms. Especially when there is a lack of data on the treatment or policy we are interested in (e.g., when this policy has never been previously implemented), structural estimation methods may be a viable alternative method of empirical testing.\n\nIn addition to enhancing econometric methodology, more efforts can be made to improve the measurement of financial structure. The existing literature mainly follows the approach of Reference LevineBeck and Levine (2002) and Reference LevineLevine (2002) to measuring the size, activity, and efficiency of the financial structure as defined by the relative importance of bank-based versus market-based financial system. This approach provides cross-country data, laying the foundation for empirical analysis. The size of financial structure is a measure of the size of stock markets relative to that of banks, which equals the logarithm of the market capitalization ratio divided by the bank credit ratio. The market capitalization ratio equals the value of domestic equities listed on domestic exchanges divided by GDP, and the bank credit ratio equals the value of deposit money that bank credits to the private sector as a share of GDP. The activity of financial structure is a measure of the activity of stock markets relative to that of banks, which equals the logarithm of the total value traded ratio divided by the bank credit ratio. The total value traded ratio equals the value of domestic equities traded on domestic exchanges divided by GDP. The efficiency of financial structure is a measure of the efficiency of stock markets relative to that of banks, which equals the logarithm of the total value traded ratio times overhead costs. Overhead costs are measured by the overhead costs of the banking system relative to banking system assets. While acknowledging these meaningful efforts, there is room for improvement to address the following limitations of indicators.\n\nFirst, stock market prices may fluctuate substantially in some years, but this does not indicate that the functioning of the stock market has also changed substantially, nor does it indicate that the financial structure of the country has changed dramatically. This may just be a short-term deviation from the trend. For example, the ratio of US stock market trading value to private sector credit was 1.8 in 2000, and dropped to 0.9 in 2018. Obviously, we cannot think that the importance of the US financial market relative to banks has declined significantly in the past two decades, because the US stock market rose sharply due to the Internet bubble around 2000, and then fell sharply. Hence, we need to explore complementary measures that can mitigate the effect of short-run fluctuations and better reflect the long-term trend of financial structure.\n\nSecond, there may be excessive speculation in the stock markets of some countries, resulting in abnormally high values of their financial structures. Take Turkey as an example, from 1999 to 2007; the average value of Turkey’s stock market trading value to private sector credit ratio was 2.1, while that of the United States during the same period was only 1.1. It would be misleading to use this measurement to conclude that Turkey’s financial structure is more inclined toward market dominance compared to that of the United States. In fact, in most years, the value of Turkey’s financial structure is significantly lower than that of the United States.\n\nLastly, in the case of small economies serving as international financial centers, their stock market trading value to private sector credit ratio can be extremely high. However, the listed companies in these economies may be foreign companies, that is, the highly developed stock market may not mainly serve the financing needs of enterprises within the economy. In other words, existing theories usually assume that the more the financial structure is dominated by the financial market, the more favorable it is for the development of innovative industries in the economy, but obviously this is not fully true for small economies in international financial centers. Taking Hong Kong, China, as an example, from 2007 to 2017, the average ratio of stock market trading value to private sector credit was 3.4, indicating a typical financial structure dominated by the financial market. However, this has not led to rapid development in innovative industries in Hong Kong.\n\nMoving forward, we can at least make two efforts to enhance the empirical testing of appropriate financial structure. First, we can build on the existing static comparative analysis and explore how the change of production structure drives the evolution of financial structure over time. In the future empirical research, we can consider starting from the factor endowment structure and the corresponding production structure to explore the appropriate financial structure. Second, it is useful to explore the conditions under which appropriate financial structure can fulfill its potential for fostering the real economy. The efficiency of financial services for the real economy is affected by transaction costs, market environment, and government governance. Even though a country’s actual financial structure is theoretically appropriate, its impact upon economic development may be constrained by institutional environment. For example, the formal or informal systems for determining transaction costs such as corporate information disclosure, qualification review, investor protection, and bankruptcy law will directly affect the efficiency of different financial system arrangements to serve the real economy.\n\n5 The Role of the State in the Financial System\n\nIn this section, we examine the role of the state in the financial system. We start with the discussion of the role of governments in addressing market failures with a special focus on PDFIs in case that commercial financial institutions and private capital markets do not meet the financing needs of the real economy, then examine how governments can make tailored financial regulations in line with the characteristics of specific financial arrangements, and finally examine why governments need to take the pragmatic approach to financial reforms rather than adopting shock therapy.\n\n5.1 Establishing PDFIs to Address Market Failures of Financial Markets and Institutions\n\nIf the role of finance is to serve the real economy, market failures may exist in decentralized commercial banking systems and private capital markets for serving certain types of investments due to information asymmetry, positive externalities, and excessive risk aversion of commercial financial institutions. Governments may intervene to fix market failures and provide financial support for credit-rationed enterprises or disadvantaged clients such as SMEs and rural smallholders. Government interventions into financial systems can take many forms, including establishing specialized PDFIs, providing state guarantees to incentivize commercial banks to provide financial support for underserved clients, and setting up state-owned venture capital funds to incubate frontier markets. Yet the mainstream perspective holds that governments should not directly intervene in financial systems but rather focus on indirect efforts to enhance the legal and institutional environments (World Bank, 2015). The rationale is that governments may suffer from corruption and rent-seeking so that the cost of government failures may exceed that of market failures. This echoes the debate on industrial policy: even though there is a basic consensus on the necessity of state intervention to address market failures, researchers disagree with each other on how to intervene (Reference Lin and XuLin & Xu, 2018). Although the popular perception that direct state intervention in financial systems fails miserably has tempted us into saying “no” to all kinds of state intervention, a more constructive approach is to delve deeper into comparative studies of both successes and failures to make prudent recommendations on how to make state intervention in financial systems work better in practice. Otherwise, we may risk turning our back on what could be genuinely helpful.\n\nIn this section, we will take PDFIs as an example to illustrate why it is important to go beyond unproductive confrontation on whether direct state intervention in financial systems is needed and to investigate how to make it work better. PDFIs are public financial institutions initiated and steered by governments with an explicit official mission to fulfill public policy objectives. In addition to equity- and guarantee-focused public funds, public development banks are a major category of PDFIs. They are potentially useful policy instruments for fixing market failures, incubating markets, and promoting structural transformation in an equitable and sustainable manner. Yet not all PDFIs are successful. It is important to explore how to make PDFIs work better.\n\nThe rest of this section proceeds as follows: we will first examine how the prevailing development thinking has shaped the evolution of PDFIs after World War II, ponder what insights the NSFE can offer to study the role of PDFIs, and then introduce the first global database on PDFIs to identify puzzles that the mainstream free-market development thinking fails to explain; we conclude with promising research questions on PDFIs.\n\n5.1.1 A Brief History of PDFIs after World War II\n\nThe number of newly established PDFIs exhibits a rise, decline, and renaissance pattern after World War II. In the 1950s, 1960s, and 1970s, structuralism emerged as the first wave of the post–World War II international development thinking. It stressed that the market encompassed insurmountable defects and that a strong government was required to expedite economic development. The slump of international trade in the Great Depression led to export pessimism. Latin American academic elites prescribed the import substitution industrialization strategy (i.e., supporting the development of domestic capital-intensive manufacturing industries to replace foreign imports) as the way for developing countries to rescue themselves from deteriorating terms of trade and avoid being exploited by developed countries. Influenced by the prevailing structuralism that emphasized the dominant role of the government, PDFIs sprang up in the wake of World War II. Developed countries established national development banks (NDBs) for postwar reconstruction, such as Kreditanstalt für Wiederaufbau and Japan Development Bank. Developing countries’ governments in Asia, Africa, and Latin America also set up NDBs because they were eager to achieve faster industrialization after gaining their political independence, such as Development Bank of the Philippines (1947), Industrial Development Bank of Turkey (1950), Brazilian Development Bank (1952), and Industrial Development Bank of Kenya (1954), and Nepal Industrial Development Corporation (1959).\n\nHowever, free-market neoliberalism became the prevailing development thinking after the 1980s and criticized the heavy-handed intervention prescribed by structuralism. It stressed privatization, liberalization, and deregulation to compensate for deficiencies in government failure. In the mid-1980s, debt crises erupted in Latin America and other developing regions. To weather the debt crises, these governments were forced to accept free-market-oriented structural adjustment programs in line with the tenets of the Washington Consensus. Influenced by free-market-oriented neoliberalism, the role of PDFIs was questioned. In this period, academic researchers found rampant government failures. NDBs in developing countries were vulnerable to excessive government intervention, leading to misallocation of resources, towering debts, and corruption (Reference GordonGordon, 1983; Reference OdedokunOdedokun, 1996). Owing to the excessive government intervention, development banks were compelled to bail out companies on the verge of bankruptcy falling into the predicament of “soft budget constraint.” Worse still, to seek rents, government officials put cheap money from development banks into nepotism-plagued firms with access to funds from capital markets or commercial banks (Reference Ades and TellaAdes & Tella, 1997; Reference Claessens, Feijen and LaevenClaessens et al., 2008; Reference FaccioFaccio, 2006). The existence of government failure has been confirmed by the studies on state-owned banks even though their authors did not distinguish NDBs from state-owned commercial banks (Reference DinçDinç, 2005; Reference La Porta, Lopez-de-Silanes and ShleiferLa Porta et al., 2002; Reference Levy-Yeyati, Micco and PanizzaLevy-Yeyati et al., 2004; Reference SapienzaSapienza, 2004). The purpose and role of development banks came into question after the mid-1980s debt crisis. The prevailing economic liberalization forced developing countries to privatize development banks: some were closed or liquidated, and some were merged into commercial banks or investment banks (Reference BruckBruck, 1998).\n\nHowever, practices of infrastructure financing have shown that privatization is not a panacea for the effective provision of long-term finance. Commercial banks and capital markets shied away from risky and long-cycle financing projects because they often considered short-term performance or benefits (Reference KayKay, 2012). The stringent rules of international development finance constrained the ability of PDFIs to provide long-term finance (Reference Xu and CareyXu & Carey, 2015). Official development assistance also shifted to social sectors such as health and basic education away from infrastructure, placing many developing countries into a growing gap of infrastructure financing (Reference Foster and Briceño-GarmendiaFoster & Briceño-Garmendia, 2010).\n\nRecently, the world is witnessing a renaissance of PDFIs at both the international level and the national level. At the strategy and policy level, international policymakers have placed more and more importance upon PDFIs. The European Union (EU) launched the Investment Plan for Europe in 2014, emphasizing that “effective involvement of National Promotional Banks (NPBs) is necessary to enhance their impact on investment, growth and employment due to their particular expertise and their knowledge of the local context, business and investor communities as well as national policies and strategies” (EU, 2015: 2). The United Nations Industrial Development Organization (UNIDO) formulated a partnership strategy with PDFIs to support larger flows of resources and trigger a stronger impact on the ground (UNIDO, 2014). The United Nations Conference on Trade and Development claimed that “the time is ripe to promote development banks” (2016: 6). The Intergovernmental Group of Twenty-Four on International Monetary Affairs and Development (G-24) and the Global Green Growth Institute have jointly launched the Infrastructure Finance in the Developing World Working Paper Series in an effort to “play a catalytic role in the creation and success of new DFIs.” At the practice level, to fill the vast infrastructure financing gaps in developing countries and shape the international development finance system (Reference XuXu, 2017), China has taken a leadership role in creating the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank and the New Development Bank. Both developed countries and developing countries have recently established or plan to establish NDBs. For instance, the UK government established a fully state-owned British Business Bank in 2014, Nepal Infrastructure Bank was set up in 2019, and Development Bank of Ghana was established in 2021.\n\nIn summary, PDFIs have undergone three stages of rise, decline, and renaissance under the influence of mainstream development thoughts in the post–World War II era. It seems that neither excessive government intervention nor holistic market-oriented operation yielded the desired development results. On the contrary, they created counterproductive consequences (e.g., corruption, inefficiency, bad debts, and lack of long-term financing). The renaissance of PDFIs calls for new development theories to account for variation in their development performance to avoid historical pitfalls and unleash their full potential.\n\n5.1.2 The First Global Database on PDFIs Worldwide\n\nDespite the renaissance of PDFIs, little systematic effort has been made to identify PDFIs worldwide, let alone gather data on their operation and performance. To fill the gap, the Institute of New Structural Economics at Peking University has initiated to build the first global database on PDFIs worldwide and then collaborated with French Development Agency to construct the database. For the purpose of distinguishing PDFIs from similar institutional arrangements, we propose a set of five qualification criteria that should be met simultaneously to qualify an entity as a PDFI: (1) being a stand-alone entity; (2) using the fund-reflow-seeking financial instruments as the main products and services; (3) having funding sources going beyond the periodic budgetary transfers; (4) having proactive public policy orientation; and (5) having government steering of their corporate strategy. Criterion 1 of being a stand-alone entity is a prerequisite, which helps to distinguish PDBs and PDFIs from government credit programs, trust funds, and special purpose vehicles. Criteria 2 and 3 go a step further to highlight the core features of PDFIs as financial institutions on both asset and liability parts. This helps to distinguish PDFIs from central banks, grant-executing agencies, and aid agencies. Criteria 4 and 5 further highlight that PDFIs are initiated and steered by governments to pursue public policy objectives. This helps to differentiate PDFIs from profit-driven financial institutions and development-oriented financial institutions created by grassroots ventures such as microfinance institutions (Reference Xu, Wang and RuXu et al., 2021).\n\nBased on the firsthand data collection, we have discovered three puzzles that the mainstream free-market development thinking fails to solve. First, PDFIs are not dying out; instead, they are prevalent worldwide. Over 520 PDFIs come from more than 150 countries with aggregate total assets of about 23 trillion USD. Second, not all PDFIs have failed in the past. PDFIs such as Korean Development Bank have played a pivotal role in promoting industrial upgrading and enhancing economic structural transformation. Third, not all PDFIs suffer from poor governance, even if their country-level governance may be poor. These puzzles encourage us to conduct original research to achieve theoretical innovations.\n\n5.1.3 The Insights of NSFE on PDFIs\n\nNSFE is well positioned to develop original theories to unleash the potential of PDFIs for achieving economic structural transformation in an equitable and sustainable manner. From the NSFE perspective, while acknowledging the potential pitfall of government failures, it argues that the role of PDFIs should not be dismissed without in-depth investigation on why they are needed. To achieve economic transformation, it is crucial to examine the factor endowment structure of the economy to identify industries with latent comparative advantage. It is latent because these industries have the lowest factor costs of production but lack the adequate infrastructure and institution, which results in relatively high transaction cost, making the industries uncompetitive in domestic and international markets. To turn the comparative advantage from latent to real, it is important for governments to play a facilitating role to provide corresponding infrastructure and institutions to overcome the high transaction costs due to market failures in making needed improvements in infrastructure and institution. From the NSFE perspective, PDFIs are potent policy instruments for governments to fill the financing gap where private capital markets and commercial banks are unable or unwilling to provide financial support. Compared with direct government interventions into financial systems, PDFIs, if well governed, may enjoy sufficient professional autonomy to address both government failures and market failures. Although some PDFIs failed in the past, one primary reason is that governments pursued the import substitution industrialization strategy and urged PDFIs to provide cheap credits to capital-intensive industries that defied comparative advantages. However, despite these failures, we should not deny the potential role that PDFIs can play in addressing market failures and improving infrastructure and institutions so as to foster economic transformation and unleash the potential of latent comparative advantages in line with factor endowment structures to upgrade production structure in the economy.\n\nLooking forward, it is promising to examine the following research questions on PDFIs: first, why do governments establish PDFIs? To what extent does the role of PDFIs adapt to the changing financing demands of the real economy at different development stages? Second, what accounts for the variation, if any, in the weight of PDFIs in the financial structure? Third, why do some PDFIs succeed, whereas others fail in fulfilling their development-oriented mandates?\n\n5.2 Making Tailored Financial Regulations\n\nFrom the NSFE perspective, there is no universal optimal financial regulatory scheme for all countries; instead, tailored financial regulation should be made based on the specific characteristics of financial markets, institutions, instruments, contracts, and so on. In this section, we tentatively explore why financial regulation needs to be tailored by examining distinctive characteristics of stock markets vis-à-vis banking systems, large banks vis-à-vis small banks, commercial banks vis-à-vis NDBs, and formal finance vis-à-vis informal finance.\n\nRegulations of stock markets and banking systems should differ because stock markets and banks function differently. Stock markets create risky liquidity based on money providers’ price discovery actions, while banks create safe liquidity by transferring short-term debts such as demand deposits into longer-term assets such as mortgage loans (Reference Dang, Gorton, Holmström and OrdonezDang et al., 2017). Therefore, it is essential to enhance information disclosure in the stock markets through financial regulation. By contrast, banks need to keep the information they produce about backing assets, such as firm loans, secret to maintain outsiders’ expectation about the value of banks’ debts so that banks’ debts (deposits) can be easily traded at par like money because they are “riskless” to some extent. Hence, banking regulation places less importance upon information disclosure and puts more focus on mitigating moral hazards owing to information asymmetry among banks and depositors, such as banks’ capital requirements that increase “skin in the game.”\n\nBanking regulation should consider how different types of banks can be better regulated. Even though in practice the Basel Accord pays special attention to global systemically important banks, banking regulation has not fully considered the heterogeneity within the banking system. Banking regulation is harmonized across countries even though countries vary in their banking structure, such as a mix of big banks and small banks. For example, although the capital requirements in Basel III were calibrated primarily for big banks in advanced economies, some key emerging-market economies have committed to implementing Basel III, and many other countries are in the process of adopting it to regulate big banks as well as small banks. They do so because they see it as being in their long-term interest even though the standards may pose new risks and challenges (Reference Beck and Rojas-SuarezBeck & Rojas-Suarez, 2019), and the Basel Accord has been perceived as the international best practice so that regulators in developing countries face peer pressure to adopt it (Reference Jones and ZeitzJones & Zeitz, 2017).\n\nIt remains unclear whether the regulatory framework designed for big banks is suitable for small banks. Taking capital requirements as an example, the existing literature proposes that when setting capital requirements, regulators should take into account the bank’s executive incentive schemes (Reference Eufinger and GillEufinger & Gill, 2017), the regulator’s screening reputation (Reference Morrison and WhiteMorrison & White, 2005), the bank’s ownership structure (Reference Laeven and LevineLaeven & Levine, 2009), and the country’s fiscal capacity (Reference StavrakevaStavrakeva, 2020). Yet it ignores the substantial difference between big banks and small banks and its impact on the effectiveness of regulatory frameworks. The latest research has begun to pay attention to the importance of bank size. For example, Reference Dávila and WaltherDávila and Walther (2020) showed that bank size is a key determinant of banks’ leverage choices when system-wide bailouts are possible. They argued that the optimal bank regulation should be size-dependent policies where capital requirements are identical for big banks and small banks, but big banks should be charged a supplement tax on borrowing. However, according to Reference Dávila and WaltherDávila and Walther (2020), the only difference between a big bank and a small bank is that the former is prone to the “too big to fail” moral hazard problem.\n\nFrom the NSFE perspective, the capital requirements in Basel III may not help small banks to achieve financial stability, given the fact that small banks are generally more opaque than big banks because the former usually lend more to small firms whose information is mainly “soft” (Reference Berger, Miller, Petersen, Rajan and Stei"
