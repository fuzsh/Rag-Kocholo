C.; Ochiai, T.\n\n2012-09-01\n\nThe search for stylized facts (i.e., simplified empirical facts) is of capital importance in econophysics because the stylized facts constitute the experimental empirical body on which theories and models should be tested. At the moment they are too few and this is an important limitation to the progress in the field. In this work, we unveil a new stylized fact, which consists of resistance effect and breaking-acceleration effect that implicitly requires a long memory feature in price movement. By analyzing a vast amount of historical data, we demonstrate that the financial market tends to exceed a past (historical) extreme price less often than expected by a classic short-memory model (e.g., Black-Scholes model). We call it resistance effect. However, when the market does it, we predict that the average volatility at that time point will be much higher (accelerates more). It means, in average, volatility accelerates more when the price breaks the highest (lowest) value. We refer to this as breaking-acceleration effect. These observed empirical facts are actually an effect which may arise from technical trading and psychological effects. Taken together, these results indicate that, beyond the predictive capability of this unveiled stylized fact, traditional short-memory models do not faithfully capture the market dynamics.\n\nStylized facts in social networks: Community-based static modeling\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nJo, Hang-Hyun; Murase, Yohsuke; TÃ¶rÃ¶k, JÃ¡nos; KertÃ©sz, JÃ¡nos; Kaski, Kimmo\n\n2018-06-01\n\nThe past analyses of datasets of social networks have enabled us to make empirical findings of a number of aspects of human society, which are commonly featured as stylized facts of social networks, such as broad distributions of network quantities, existence of communities, assortative mixing, and intensity-topology correlations. Since the understanding of the structure of these complex social networks is far from complete, for deeper insight into human society more comprehensive datasets and modeling of the stylized facts are needed. Although the existing dynamical and static models can generate some stylized facts, here we take an alternative approach by devising a community-based static model with heterogeneous community sizes and larger communities having smaller link density and weight. With these few assumptions we are able to generate realistic social networks that show most stylized facts for a wide range of parameters, as demonstrated numerically and analytically. Since our community-based static model is simple to implement and easily scalable, it can be used as a reference system, benchmark, or testbed for further applications.\n\nMinority games and stylized facts\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nChallet, Damien; Marsili, Matteo; Zhang, Yi-Cheng\n\n2001-10-01\n\nThe minority game is a generic model of competing adaptive agents, which is often believed to be a model of financial markets. We discuss to which extent this is a reasonable statement, and present minimal modifications that make this model reproduce stylized facts. The resulting model shows that without speculators, prices follow random walks, and that stylized facts disappear if enough speculators take into account their market impact.\n\nAn agent-based approach to financial stylized facts\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nShimokawa, Tetsuya; Suzuki, Kyoko; Misawa, Tadanobu\n\n2007-06-01\n\nAn important challenge of the financial theory in recent years is to construct more sophisticated models which have consistencies with as many financial stylized facts that cannot be explained by traditional models. Recently, psychological studies on decision making under uncertainty which originate in Kahneman and Tversky's research attract a lot of interest as key factors which figure out the financial stylized facts. These psychological results have been applied to the theory of investor's decision making and financial equilibrium modeling. This paper, following these behavioral financial studies, would like to propose an agent-based equilibrium model with prospect theoretical features of investors. Our goal is to point out a possibility that loss-averse feature of investors explains vast number of financial stylized facts and plays a crucial role in price formations of financial markets. Price process which is endogenously generated through our model has consistencies with, not only the equity premium puzzle and the volatility puzzle, but great kurtosis, asymmetry of return distribution, auto-correlation of return volatility, cross-correlation between return volatility and trading volume. Moreover, by using agent-based simulations, the paper also provides a rigorous explanation from the viewpoint of a lack of market liquidity to the size effect, which means that small-sized stocks enjoy excess returns compared to large-sized stocks.\n\nImpact of global financial crisis on stylized facts between energy markets and stock markets\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nLeng, Tan Kim; Cheong, Chin Wen; Hooi, Tan Siow\n\n2014-06-01\n\nUnderstanding the stylized facts is extremely important and has becomes a hot issue nowadays. However, recent global financial crisis that started from United States had spread all over the world and adversely affected the commodities and financial sectors of both developed and developing countries. This paper tends to examine the impact of crisis on stylized facts between energy and stock markets using ARCH-family models based on the experience over 2008 global financial crisis. Empirical results denote that there is long lasting, persists and positively significant the autocorrelation function of absolute returns and their squares in both markets for before and during crisis. Besides that, leverage effects are found in stock markets whereby bad news has a greater impact on volatility than good news for both before and during crisis. However, crisis does not indicate any impact on risk-return tradeoff for both energy and stock markets. For forecasting evaluations, GARCH model and FIAPARCH model indicate superior out of sample forecasts for before and during crisis respectively.\n\nFinancial price dynamics and pedestrian counterflows: A comparison of statistical stylized facts\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nParisi, Daniel R.; Sornette, Didier; Helbing, Dirk\n\n2013-01-01\n\nWe propose and document the evidence for an analogy between the dynamics of granular counterflows in the presence of bottlenecks or restrictions and financial price formation processes. Using extensive simulations, we find that the counterflows of simulated pedestrians through a door display eight stylized facts observed in financial markets when the density around the door is compared with the logarithm of the price. Finding so many stylized facts is very rare indeed among all agent-based models of financial markets. The stylized properties are present when the agents in the pedestrian model are assumed to display a zero-intelligent behavior. If agents are given decision-making capacity and adapt to partially follow the majority, periods of herding behavior may additionally occur. This generates the very slow decay of the autocorrelation of absolute return due to an intermittent dynamics. Our findings suggest that the stylized facts in the fluctuations of the financial prices result from a competition of two groups with opposite interests in the presence of a constraint funneling the flow of transactions to a narrow band of prices with limited liquidity.\n\nFinancial price dynamics and pedestrian counterflows: a comparison of statistical stylized facts.\n\nPubMed\n\nParisi, Daniel R; Sornette, Didier; Helbing, Dirk\n\n2013-01-01\n\nWe propose and document the evidence for an analogy between the dynamics of granular counterflows in the presence of bottlenecks or restrictions and financial price formation processes.

Especially, the short-term predictability of asset return was focused on and an explanation in the view of information transmission was provided to the question why the predictability was much clearly observed in the small-sized stocks. This paper, to extend the previous study, demonstrates that the word of mouth model also has a consistency with other important financial stylized facts. This strengthens the possibility that the information transmission among investors plays a crucial role in price formation. Concretely, this paper addresses two famous statistical features of returns; the leptokurtic distribution of return and the autocorrelation of return volatility. The reasons why these statistical facts receive especial attentions of researchers among financial stylized facts are their statistical robustness and practical importance, such as the applications to the derivative pricing problems.\n\nBridging stylized facts in finance and data non-stationarities\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nCamargo, Sabrina; Duarte QueirÃ³s, SÃ­lvio M.; Anteneodo, Celia\n\n2013-04-01\n\nEmploying a recent technique which allows the representation of nonstationary data by means of a juxtaposition of locally stationary paths of different length, we introduce a comprehensive analysis of the key observables in a financial market: the trading volume and the price fluctuations. From the segmentation procedure we are able to introduce a quantitative description of statistical features of these two quantities, which are often named stylized facts, namely the tails of the distribution of trading volume and price fluctuations and a dynamics compatible with the U-shaped profile of the volume in a trading section and the slow decay of the autocorrelation function. The segmentation of the trading volume series provides evidence of slow evolution of the fluctuating parameters of each patch, pointing to the mixing scenario. Assuming that long-term features are the outcome of a statistical mixture of simple local forms, we test and compare different probability density functions to provide the long-term distribution of the trading volume, concluding that the log-normal gives the best agreement with the empirical distribution. Moreover, the segmentation of the magnitude price fluctuations are quite different from the results for the trading volume, indicating that changes in the statistics of price fluctuations occur at a faster scale than in the case of trading volume.\n\nStylized facts of intraday precious metals\n\nPubMed Central\n\nBatten, Jonathan; McGroarty, Frank; Peat, Maurice; Urquhart, Andrew\n\n2017-01-01\n\nThis paper examines the stylized facts, correlation and interaction between volatility and returns at the 5-minute frequency for gold, silver, platinum and palladium from May 2000 to April 2015. We study the full sample period, as well as three subsamples to determine how high-frequency data of precious metals have developed over time. We find that over the full sample, the number of trades has increased substantially over time for each precious metal, while the bid-ask spread has narrowed over time, indicating an increase in liquidity and price efficiency. We also find strong evidence of periodicity in returns, volatility, volume and bid-ask spread. Returns and volume both experience strong intraday periodicity linked to the opening and closing of major markets around the world while the bid-ask spread is at its lowest when European markets are open. We also show a bilateral Granger causality between returns and volatility of each precious metal, which holds for the vast majority subsamples.

Here we examine how \"stylized facts\", namely fat tails and volatility clustering, are affected by different tax regimes in laboratory experiments. We find that leptokurtosis of price returns is highest and clustered volatility is weakest in unilaterally taxed markets (where tax havens exist). Instead, tails are slimmest and volatility clustering is strongest in tax havens. When an encompassing financial transaction tax is levied, stylized facts hardly change compared to a scenario with no tax on all markets.\n\nModeling the stylized facts in finance through simple nonlinear adaptive systems\n\nPubMed Central\n\nHommes, Cars H.\n\n2002-01-01\n\nRecent work on adaptive systems for modeling financial markets is discussed. Financial markets are viewed as evolutionary systems between different, competing trading strategies. Agents are boundedly rational in the sense that they tend to follow strategies that have performed well, according to realized profits or accumulated wealth, in the recent past. Simple technical trading rules may survive evolutionary competition in a heterogeneous world where prices and beliefs co-evolve over time. Evolutionary models can explain important stylized facts, such as fat tails, clustered volatility, and long memory, of real financial series.

Unlike the stylized facts in normalized log returns, the probability distributions for such single asset encounters incorporate the time factor by means of the internal rate of return, defined as the continuous compound interest. Resulting stylized facts are shown in the probability distributions derived from the daily series of TOPIX, S & P 500 and FTSE 100 index close values. The application of the above analysis to minute-tick data of NIKKEI 225 and its futures market, respectively, reveals an interesting difference in the behavior of the two probability distributions, in case a threshold on the minimal duration of the long position is imposed. It is therefore suggested that the probability distributions of the internal rates of return could be used for causality mining between the underlying and derivative stock markets. The highly specific discrete spectrum, which results from noise trader strategies as opposed to the smooth distributions observed for fundamentalist strategies in single encounter transactions may be useful in deducing the type of investment strategy from trading revenues of small portfolio investors.\n\nThe impact of a financial transaction tax on stylized facts of price returnsâEvidence from the lab\n\nPubMed Central\n\nHuber, JÃ¼rgen; Kleinlercher, Daniel; Kirchler, Michael\n\n2012-01-01\n\nAs the introduction of financial transaction taxes is increasingly discussed by political leaders we explore possible consequences such taxes could have on markets.

Origin and self-organization of stylized facts\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nAlfi, V.; Cristelli, M.; Pietronero, L.; Zaccaria, A.\n\n2009-02-01\n\nWe introduce a minimal agent based model for financial markets to understand the nature and self-organization of the stylized facts. The model is minimal in the sense that we try to identify the essential ingredients to reproduce the most important deviations of price time series from a random walk behavior. We focus on four essential ingredients: fundamentalist agents which tend to stabilize the market; chartist agents which induce destabilization; analysis of price behavior for the two strategies; herding behavior which governs the possibility of changing strategy. Bubbles and crashes correspond to situations dominated by chartists, while fundamentalists provide a long time stability (on average). The stylized facts are shown to correspond to an intermittent behavior which occurs only for a finite value of the number of agents N. Therefore they correspond to finite size effects which, however, can occur at different time scales. We propose a new mechanism for the self-organization of this state which is linked to the existence of a threshold for the agents to be active or not active. The feedback between price fluctuations and number of active agents represents a crucial element for this state of self-organized intermittency. The model can be easily generalized to consider more realistic variants.\n\nStylizing Stylization: The Case of \"Aigia Fuxia\"\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nTsiplakou, Stavroula; Ioannidou, Elena\n\n2012-01-01\n\nThis paper examines language stylization in \"Aigia Fuxia\" (\"The Fuchsia Goat\"), a highly popular Greek Cypriot sitcom, where the (imagined) linguistic and socio-cultural \"self\" of a dialect-speaking community is subjected to extreme and aberrant stylization.

The key idea is to study the combined structure of both investment strategies and prices in order to open a qualitatively new level of understanding of financial and economic markets. We study the detailed order flow on the Shenzhen Stock Exchange of China for the whole year of 2003. This enormous dataset allows us to compare (i) a closed national market (A-shares) with an international market (B-shares), (ii) individuals and institutions, and (iii) real traders to random strategies with respect to timing that share otherwise all other characteristics. We find in general that more trading results in smaller net return due to trading frictions, with the exception that the net return is independent of the trading frequency for A-share individual traders. We unveiled quantitative power laws with non-trivial exponents, that quantify the deterioration of performance with frequency and with holding period of the strategies used by traders. Random strategies are found to perform much better than real ones, both for winners and losers. Surprising large arbitrage opportunities exist, especially when using zero-intelligence strategies. This is a diagnostic of possible inefficiencies of these financial markets.\n\nInvestment Strategies Used as Spectroscopy of Financial Markets Reveal New Stylized Facts\n\nPubMed Central\n\nZhou, Wei-Xing; Mu, Guo-Hua; Chen, Wei; Sornette, Didier\n\n2011-01-01\n\nWe propose a new set of stylized facts quantifying the structure of financial markets.

Employing analytical and numerical tools, we investigate stability conditions as well as bifurcations and possible periodic, quasi-periodic, and chaotic dynamics, enlightening how the degree of market interaction, together with the accelerator parameter and the intervention of the fiscal authority, may affect the business cycle and the course of the financial market. In particular, we show that even if the steady state is locally stable, multistability phenomena can occur, with several and complex dynamic structures coexisting with the steady state. Finally, simulations reveal that the proposed model is able to explain several statistical properties and stylized facts observed in real financial markets, including persistent high volatility, fat-tailed return distributions, volatility clustering, and positive autocorrelation of absolute returns.\n\nReal and financial market interactions in a multiplier-accelerator model: Nonlinear dynamics, multistability and stylized facts.\n\nPubMed\n\nCavalli, F; Naimzada, A; Pecora, N\n\n2017-10-01\n\nIn the present paper, we investigate the dynamics of a model in which the real part of the economy, described within a multiplier-accelerator framework, interacts with a financial market with heterogeneous speculators, in order to study the channels through which the two sectors influence each other.

An intonation mimicking paradigm is used. The task of the ten subjects is to copy the intonation pattern of sentences with the help of a stylus on a graphic tablet, using a system for real-time manual intonation modification. Gestural imitation is compared to vocal imitation of the same sentences (seven for a male speaker, seven for a female speaker). Distance measures between gestural copies, vocal imitations, and original sentences are computed for performance assessment. Perceptual testing is also used for assessing the quality of gestural copies. The perceptual difference between natural and stylized contours is measured using a mean opinion score paradigm for 15 subjects. The results indicate that intonation contours can be stylized with accuracy by chironomic imitation. The results of vocal imitation and chironomic imitation are comparable, but subjects show better imitation results in vocal imitation. The best stylized contours using chironomy seems perceptually indistinguishable or almost indistinguishable from natural contours, particularly for female speech. This indicates that chironomic stylization is effective, and that hand movements can be analogous to intonation movements.

P.; Bouchard, C.\n\n2017-01-01\n\nThe urgency of the research of form making problem in design is associated with the necessity of new understanding of visual culture and new approaches to design engineering representing the integration of artistic and designed problems. The aim of this research is to study the levels of stylization of design objects and dependance (relation) on the specific project objectives and existing technologies. On the ground of quantitative evaluation, the stylization measures are emphasized: figurative image, stylized image and abstract image. Theoretic conclusions are complemented by practical problem solution over creating openwork metal lantern. Variants of both the traditional mains supply of the lantern and the autonomic supply system based on solar energy were offered. The role of semantic factor, affecting the depth of perception of design objects semantic space, is represented in this paper.\n\nExemplar-Based Image and Video Stylization Using Fully Convolutional Semantic Features.\n\nPubMed\n\nZhu, Feida; Yan, Zhicheng; Bu, Jiajun; Yu, Yizhou\n\n2017-05-10\n\nColor and tone stylization in images and videos strives to enhance unique themes with artistic color and tone adjustments. It has a broad range of applications from professional image postprocessing to photo sharing over social networks. Mainstream photo enhancement softwares, such as Adobe Lightroom and Instagram, provide users with predefined styles, which are often hand-crafted through a trial-and-error process. Such photo adjustment tools lack a semantic understanding of image contents and the resulting global color transform limits the range of artistic styles it can represent. On the other hand, stylistic enhancement needs to apply distinct adjustments to various semantic regions. Such an ability enables a broader range of visual styles. In this paper, we first propose a novel deep learning architecture for exemplar-based image stylization, which learns local enhancement styles from image pairs. Our deep learning architecture consists of fully convolutional networks (FCNs) for automatic semantics-aware feature extraction and fully connected neural layers for adjustment prediction. Image stylization can be efficiently accomplished with a single forward pass through our deep network. To extend our deep network from image stylization to video stylization, we exploit temporal superpixels (TSPs) to facilitate the transfer of artistic styles from image exemplars to videos. Experiments on a number of datasets for image stylization as well as a diverse set of video clips demonstrate the effectiveness of our deep learning architecture.\n\nStylizing Voices, Stances, and Identities Related to Medium of Education in India\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nSandhu, Priti\n\n2015-01-01\n\nThis study analyzes the narrative-based interview data of three Indian women to examine the manner in which they utilize stylization to construct identity-rich, ideological stances related to discriminatory discourses of Hindi and English medium education in the linguistically rich, albeit complex, present-day context of India.

This allows one to interpret the system's behavior in terms of phase transitions and critical phenomena.\n\nDetail view of stylized railing and bronze light fixture on ...\n\nLibrary of Congress Historic Buildings Survey, Historic Engineering Record, Historic Landscapes Survey\n\nDetail view of stylized railing and bronze light fixture on southwest facade - Blue Ridge Sanatorium, Building No. 1901, East side of State Route 20, .25 mile south of I-64, Charlottesville, Independent City, VA\n\nA comparison of newborn stylized and tomographic models for dose assessment in paediatric radiology\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nStaton, R. J.; Pazik, F. D.; Nipper, J. C.; Williams, J. L.; Bolch, W. E.\n\n2003-04-01\n\nEstablishment of organ doses from diagnostic and interventional examinations is a key component to quantifying the radiation risks from medical exposures and for formulating corresponding dose-reduction strategies. Radiation transport models of human anatomy provide a convenient method for simulating radiological examinations. At present, two classes of models exist: stylized mathematical models and tomographic voxel models. In the present study, organ dose comparisons are made for projection radiographs of both a stylized and a tomographic model of the newborn patient. Sixteen separate radiographs were simulated for each model at x-ray technique factors typical of newborn examinations: chest, abdomen, thorax and head views in the AP, PA, left LAT and right LAT projection orientation. For AP and PA radiographs of the torso (chest, abdomen and thorax views), the effective dose assessed for the tomographic model exceeds that for the stylized model with per cent differences ranging from 19% (AP abdominal view) to 43% AP chest view. In contrast, the effective dose for the stylized model exceeds that for the tomographic model for all eight lateral views including those of the head, with per cent differences ranging from 9% (LLAT chest view) to 51% (RLAT thorax view). While organ positioning differences do exist between the models, a major factor contributing to differences in effective dose is the models' exterior trunk shape. In the tomographic model, a more elliptical shape is seen thus providing for less tissue shielding for internal organs in the AP and PA directions, with corresponding increased tissue shielding in the lateral directions. This observation is opposite of that seen in comparisons of stylized and tomographic models of the adult.\n\nDetail view to show the stylized \"dragon\" bracket feature that ...\n\nLibrary of Congress Historic Buildings Survey, Historic Engineering Record, Historic Landscapes Survey\n\nDetail view to show the stylized \"dragon\" bracket feature that stands guard by the outside door to the kitchen (north elevation of the main house) - Death Valley Ranch, Main House, Death Valley Junction, Inyo County, CA\n\nA study of a diffusive model of asset returns and an empirical analysis of financial markets\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nAlejandro Quinones, Angel Luis\n\nA diffusive model for market dynamics is studied and the predictions of the model are compared to real financial markets. The model has a non-constant diffusion coefficient which depends both on the asset value and the time. A general solution for the distribution of returns is obtained and shown to match the results of computer simulations for two simple cases, piecewise linear and quadratic diffusion. The effects of discreteness in the market dynamics on the model are also studied. For the quadratic diffusion case, a type of phase transition leading to fat tails is observed as the discrete distribution approaches the continuum limit. It is also found that the model captures some of the empirical stylized facts observed in real markets, including fat-tails and scaling behavior in the distribution of returns. An analysis of empirical data for the EUR/USD currency exchange rate and the S&P 500 index is performed. Both markets show time scaling behavior consistent with a value of 1/2 for the Hurst exponent. Finally, the results show that the distribution of returns for the two markets is well fitted by the model, and the corresponding empirical diffusion coefficients are determined.\n\nNOTE: On the need to revise the arm structure in stylized anthropomorphic phantoms in lateral photon irradiation geometry\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nLee, Choonsik; Lee, Choonik; Lee, Jai-Ki\n\n2006-11-01\n\nDistributions of radiation absorbed dose within human anatomy have been estimated through Monte Carlo radiation transport techniques implemented for two different classes of computational anthropomorphic phantoms: (1) mathematical equation-based stylized phantoms and (2) tomographic image-based voxel phantoms. Voxel phantoms constructed from tomographic images of real human anatomy have been actively developed since the late 1980s to overcome the anatomical approximations necessary with stylized phantoms, which themselves have been utilized since the mid 1960s. However, revisions of stylized phantoms have also been pursued in parallel to the development of voxel phantoms since voxel phantoms (1) are initially restricted to the individual-specific anatomy of the person originally imaged, (2) must be restructured on an organ-by-organ basis to conform to reference individual anatomy and (3) cannot easily represent very fine anatomical structures and tissue layers that are thinner than the voxel dimensions of the overall phantom. Although efforts have been made to improve the anatomic realism of stylized phantoms, most of these efforts have been limited to attempts to alter internal organ structures. Aside from the internal organs, the exterior shapes, and especially the arm structures, of stylized phantoms are also far from realistic descriptions of human anatomy, and may cause dosimetry errors in the calculation of organ-absorbed doses for external irradiation scenarios. The present study was intended to highlight the need to revise the existing arm structure within stylized phantoms by comparing organ doses of stylized adult phantoms with those from three adult voxel phantoms in the lateral photon irradiation geometry. The representative stylized phantom, the adult phantom of the Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) series and two adult male voxel phantoms, KTMAN-2 and VOXTISS8, were employed for Monte Carlo dose calculation, and data from another voxel phantom, VIP\n\n\"Cool\" English: Stylized Native-Speaker English in Japanese Television Shows\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nFurukawa, Gavin\n\n2015-01-01\n\nThis article analyzes stylized pronunciations of English by Japanese speakers on televised variety shows in Japan.

Recent empirical evidence suggests that the multiscale data characteristics in the price movement are another important stylized fact. The incorporation of mixture of data characteristics in the time scale domain during the modelling process can lead to significant performance improvement. This paper proposes a novel morphological component analysis based hybrid methodology for modeling the multiscale heterogeneous characteristics of the price movement in the crude oil markets. Empirical studies in two representative benchmark crude oil markets reveal the existence of multiscale heterogeneous microdata structure. The significant performance improvement of the proposed algorithm incorporating the heterogeneous data characteristics, against benchmark random walk, ARMA, and SVR models, is also attributed to the innovative methodology proposed to incorporate this important stylized fact during the modelling process. Meanwhile, work in this paper offers additional insights into the heterogeneous market microstructure with economic viable interpretations.\n\nComparison of Monoenergetic Photon Organ Dose Rate Coefficients for the Female Stylized and Voxel Phantoms Submerged in Air\n\nDOE PAGES\n\nHiller, Mauritius; Dewji, Shaheen Azim\n\n2017-02-16\n\nDose rate coefficients computed using the International Commission on Radiological Protection (ICRP) reference adult female voxel phantom were compared with values computed using the Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) adult female stylized phantom in an air submersion exposure geometry.

This gain-loss asymmetry is revealed by inverse statistics, a method closely related to empirically finding first passage times. Many papers have presented evidence about the asymmetry, where it appears and where it does not. Also, various interpretations and explanations for the results have been suggested. In this chapter, we review the published results and explanations. We also examine the results and show that some are at best fragile. Similarly, we discuss the suggested explanations and propose a new model based on Gaussian mixtures. Apart from explaining the gain-loss asymmetry, this model also has the potential to explain other stylized facts such as volatility clustering, fat tails, and power law behavior of returns.\n\nDelayed Majority Game with Heterogeneous Learning Speeds for Financial Markets\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nYoshimura, Yushi; Yamada, Kenta\n\nThere are two famous statistical laws, so-called stylized facts, in financial markets. One is fat tail where the tail of price returns obeys a power law. The other is volatility clustering in which the autocorrelation function of absolute price returns decays with a power law. In order to understand relationships between the stylized facts and dealers' behaviors, we constructed a new agent-based model based on the grand canonical minority game (GCMG) and the Giardina-Bouchaud (GB) model. The recovery of stylized facts by GCMG and GB lacks of robustness. Therefore, based on the GCMG and GB model, we develop a new model that can reproduce stylized facts robustly. Furthermore, we find that heterogeneity of learning speeds of agents is important to reproduce the stylized facts.\n\nDay-Ahead Crude Oil Price Forecasting Using a Novel Morphological Component Analysis Based Model\n\nPubMed Central\n\nZhu, Qing; Zou, Yingchao; Lai, Kin Keung\n\n2014-01-01\n\nAs a typical nonlinear and dynamic system, the crude oil price movement is difficult to predict and its accurate forecasting remains the subject of intense research activity.

In our stylized system, banks can be in two states: normally operating or distressed and the state of a bank changes from normally operating to distressed whenever its liabilities are larger than the banks' assets. The banks are connected through an interbank lending network and, whenever a bank is distressed, its creditor cannot expect the loan from the distressed bank to be repaid, potentially becoming distressed themselves. We solve the problem analytically for a homogeneous system and test the robustness and generality of the results with simulations of more complex systems. We investigate the parameter space and the corresponding distribution of operating banks mapping the conditions under which the whole system is stable or unstable. This allows us to determine how financial stability of a banking system is influenced by regulatory decisions, such as leverage; we discuss the effect of central bank actions, such as quantitative easing and we determine the cost of rescuing a distressed banking system using re-capitalisation. Finally, we estimate the stability of the UK and US banking systems comparing the years 2007 and 2012 by using real data.\n\n3D Geovisualization & Stylization to Manage Comprehensive and Participative Local Urban Plans\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nBrasebin, M.; Christophe, S.; Jacquinod, F.; Vinesse, A.; Mahon, H.\n\n2016-10-01\n\n3D geo-visualization is more and more used and appreciated to support public participation, and is generally used to present predesigned planned projects. Nevertheless, other participatory processes may benefit from such technology such as the elaboration of urban planning documents. In this article, we present one of the objectives of the PLU++ project: the design of a 3D geo-visualization system that eases the participation concerning local urban plans. Through a pluridisciplinary approach, it aims at covering the different aspects of such a system: the simulation of built configurations to represent regulation information, the efficient stylization of these objects to make people understand their meanings and the interaction between 3D simulation and stylization. The system aims at being adaptive according to the participation context and to the dynamic of the participation. It will offer the possibility to modify simulation results and the rendering styles of the 3D representations to support participation. The proposed 3D rendering styles will be used in a set of practical experiments in order to test and validate some hypothesis from past researches of the project members about 3D simulation, 3D semiotics and knowledge about uses.\n\nSpeculative behavior and asset price dynamics.\n\nPubMed\n\nWesterhoff, Frank\n\n2003-07-01\n\nThis paper deals with speculative trading. Guided by empirical observations, a nonlinear deterministic asset pricing model is developed in which traders repeatedly choose between technical and fundamental analysis to determine their orders. The interaction between the trading rules produces complex dynamics. The model endogenously replicates the stylized facts of excess volatility, high trading volumes, shifts in the level of asset prices, and volatility clustering.\n\nState of the \"art\": a taxonomy of artistic stylization techniques for images and video.\n\nPubMed\n\nKyprianidis, Jan Eric; Collomosse, John; Wang, Tinghuai; Isenberg, Tobias\n\n2013-05-01\n\nThis paper surveys the field of nonphotorealistic rendering (NPR), focusing on techniques for transforming 2D input (images and video) into artistically stylized renderings. We first present a taxonomy of the 2D NPR algorithms developed over the past two decades, structured according to the design characteristics and behavior of each technique. We then describe a chronology of development from the semiautomatic paint systems of the early nineties, through to the automated painterly rendering systems of the late nineties driven by image gradient analysis. Two complementary trends in the NPR literature are then addressed, with reference to our taxonomy. First, the fusion of higher level computer vision and NPR, illustrating the trends toward scene analysis to drive artistic abstraction and diversity of style. Second, the evolution of local processing approaches toward edge-aware filtering for real-time stylization of images and video. The survey then concludes with a discussion of open challenges for 2D NPR identified in recent NPR symposia, including topics such as user and aesthetic evaluation.\n\nComparison of monoenergetic photon organ dose rate coefficients for stylized and voxel phantoms submerged in air\n\nDOE PAGES\n\nBellamy, Michael B.; Hiller, Mauritius M.; Dewji, Shaheen A.; ...\n\n2016-02-01\n\nAs part of a broader effort to calculate effective dose rate coefficients for external exposure to photons and electrons emitted by radionuclides distributed in air, soil or water, age-specific stylized phantoms have been employed to determine dose coefficients relating dose rate to organs and tissues in the body.

Here, the authors return to the basic insight of structural diversity in economic sociology. Using the Indian interorganizational ownership network as their case, they discover a compositeâor âhybridââmodel of economic networks that combines elements of prior stylized models. The network contains a disconnected periphery conforming closely to a âtransactionalâ model; a semiperiphery characterized by small, dense clusters with sporadic links, as predicted in âsmall-worldâ models; and finally a nested core composed of clusters connected via multiple independent paths. The authors then show how a firmâs position within the mesolevel structure is associated with demographic features such as age and industry and differences in the extent to which firms engage in multiplex and high-value exchanges.

Among them, the most widespread is Bitcoin. Given its novelty, this paper investigates some statistical properties of the Bitcoin market. This study compares Bitcoin and standard currencies dynamics and focuses on the analysis of returns at different time scales. We test the presence of long memory in return time series from 2011 to 2017, using transaction data from one Bitcoin platform. We compute the Hurst exponent by means of the Detrended Fluctuation Analysis method, using a sliding window in order to measure long range dependence. We detect that Hurst exponents changes significantly during the first years of existence of Bitcoin, tending to stabilize in recent times. Additionally, multiscale analysis shows a similar behavior of the Hurst exponent, implying a self-similar process.\n\nPermanence of agricultural afforestation for carbon sequestration under stylized carbon markets in the U.S.\n\nTreesearch\n\nDavid Haim; Eric White; Ralph J.

This study strikes a compromise between abstract and highly specified ABMs by designing a spatially explicit, stylized ABM and using it to explore policy scenarios in a setting that is facing substantial conservation and development challenges. Specifically, we present an ABM that reflects key Land Use / Land Cover (LULC) dynamics and livelihood decisions on Isabela Island in the GalÃ¡pagos Archipelago of Ecuador. We implement the model using the NetLogo software platform, a free program that requires relatively little programming experience. The landscape is composed of a satellite-derived distribution of a problematic invasive species (common guava) and a stylized representation of the GalÃ¡pagos National Park, the community of Puerto Villamil, the agricultural zone, and the marine area. The agent module is based on publicly available data and household interviews, and represents the primary livelihoods of the population in the GalÃ¡pagos Islands â tourism, fisheries, and agriculture. We use the model to enact hypothetical agricultural subsidy scenarios aimed at controlling invasive guava and assess the resulting population and land cover dynamics. Findings suggest that spatially explicit, stylized ABMs have considerable utility, particularly during preliminary stages of research, as platforms for (1) sharpening conceptualizations of population-environment systems, (2) testing alternative scenarios, and (3) uncovering critical data gaps.

E.\n\n2003-10-01\n\nTwo classes of anatomic models currently exist for use in both radiation protection and radiation dose reconstruction: stylized mathematical models and tomographic voxel models. The former utilize 3D surface equations to represent internal organ structure and external body shape, while the latter are based on segmented CT or MR images of a single individual. While tomographic models are clearly more anthropomorphic than stylized models, a given model's characterization as being anthropometric is dependent upon the reference human to which the model is compared. In the present study, data on total body mass, standing/sitting heights and body mass index are collected and reviewed for the US population covering the time interval from 1971 to 2000. These same anthropometric parameters are then assembled for the ORNL series of stylized models, the GSF series of tomographic models (Golem, Helga, Donna, etc), the adult male Zubal tomographic model and the UF newborn tomographic model. The stylized ORNL models of the adult male and female are found to be fairly representative of present-day average US males and females, respectively, in terms of both standing and sitting heights for ages between 20 and 60-80 years. While the ORNL adult male model provides a reasonably close match to the total body mass of the average US 21-year-old male (within ~5%), present-day 40-year-old males have an average total body mass that is ~16% higher. For radiation protection purposes, the use of the larger 73.7 kg adult ORNL stylized hermaphrodite model provides a much closer representation of average present-day US females at ages ranging from 20 to 70 years. In terms of the adult tomographic models from the GSF series, only Donna (40-year-old F) closely matches her age-matched US counterpart in terms of average body mass. Regarding standing heights, the better matches to US age-correlated averages belong to Irene (32-year-old F) for the females and Golem (38-year-old M) for the males.

The first is for a richer account of morality than that afforded by bioethical principlism, which is cast as excessively abstract and thin on the facts. The second is for the facts in question to be those of human experience and not some other, unworldly realm. Empirical ethics therefore promises a richer naturalistic ethics, but in fulfilling the second call it often fails to heed the metaethical requirements related to the first. Empirical ethics risks losing the normative edge which necessarily characterizes the ethical, by failing to account for the nature and the logic of moral norms. I sketch a naturalistic theory, teleological expressivism (TE), which negotiates the naturalistic fallacy by providing a more satisfactory means of taking into account facts and research data with ethical implications. The examples of informed consent and the euthanasia debate are used to illustrate the superiority of this approach, and the problems consequent on including the facts in the wrong kind of way.\n\nHow Accurate Are German Work-Time Data?

The model turns out, even if we assume the input fundamental value follows an simple Gaussian distribution lacking both fat tails and volatility dependence, these features can show up in the time series of asset returns. In this model, the profit comparison and switching between heterogeneous play key roles, which build a connection between endogenous market and the emergence of stylized facts.\n\nProduction costs and animal welfare for four stylized hog production systems.\n\nPubMed\n\nSeibert, Lacey; Norwood, F Bailey\n\n2011-01-01\n\nNonhuman animal welfare is arguably the most contentious issue facing the hog industry. Animal advocacy groups influence the regulation of hog farms and induce some consumers to demand more humane pork products. Hog producers are understandably reluctant to improve animal well being unless the premium they extract exceeds the corresponding increase in cost. To better understand the relationship between animal welfare and production costs under different farm systems, this study investigates 4 stylized hog production systems. The results show that increasing animal welfare for all hogs in the United States will increase retail pork prices by a maximum of 2% for a small welfare increase and 5% for a large welfare increase. The cost of banning gestation crates measured by this study is lower than the consumer willingness-to-pay from other studies.\n\nA Conditional Curie-Weiss Model for Stylized Multi-group Binary Choice with Social Interaction\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nOpoku, Alex Akwasi; Edusei, Kwame Owusu; Ansah, Richard Kwame\n\n2018-04-01\n\nThis paper proposes a conditional Curie-Weiss model as a model for decision making in a stylized society made up of binary decision makers that face a particular dichotomous choice between two options. Following Brock and Durlauf (Discrete choice with social interaction I: theory, 1955), we set-up both socio-economic and statistical mechanical models for the choice problem. We point out when both the socio-economic and statistical mechanical models give rise to the same self-consistent equilibrium mean choice level(s).

After explaining the problem of discerning such markers within a Kantian framework I briefly explain Kant's empirical psychology. I then argue that Kant's empirical markers for moral responsibility--linked to higher faculties of cognition--are not sufficient conditions for moral responsibility, primarily because they are empirical characteristics subject to natural laws. Next. I argue that these markers are not necessary conditions of moral responsibility. Given Kant's transcendental idealism, even an entity that lacks these markers could be free and morally responsible, although as a matter of fact Kant thinks that none are. Given that they are neither necessary nor sufficient conditions, I discuss the status of Kant's claim that higher faculties are empirical markers of moral responsibility. Drawing on connections between Kant's ethical theory and 'common rational cognition' (4:393), I suggest that Kant's theory of empirical markers can be traced to ordinary common sense beliefs about responsibility. This suggestion helps explain both why empirical markers are important and what the limits of empirical psychology are within Kant's account of moral responsibility.\n\nEmpirical ethics and its alleged meta-ethical fallacies.\n\nPubMed\n\nde Vries, Rob; Gordijn, Bert\n\n2009-05-01\n\nThis paper analyses the concept of empirical ethics as well as three meta-ethical fallacies that empirical ethics is said to face: the is-ought problem, the naturalistic fallacy and violation of the fact-value distinction. Moreover, it answers the question of whether empirical ethics (necessarily) commits these three basic meta-ethical fallacies.\n\nStylized facts from a threshold-based heterogeneous agent model\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nCross, R.; Grinfeld, M.; Lamba, H.; Seaman, T.\n\n2007-05-01\n\nA class of heterogeneous agent models is investigated where investors switch trading position whenever their motivation to do so exceeds some critical threshold. These motivations can be psychological in nature or reflect behaviour suggested by the efficient market hypothesis (EMH). By introducing different propensities into a baseline model that displays EMH behaviour, one can attempt to isolate their effects upon the market dynamics. The simulation results indicate that the introduction of a herding propensity results in excess kurtosis and power-law decay consistent with those observed in actual return distributions, but not in significant long-term volatility correlations. Possible alternatives for introducing such long-term volatility correlations are then identified and discussed.\n\nEmpirical data and moral theory. A plea for integrated empirical ethics.\n\nPubMed\n\nMolewijk, Bert; Stiggelbout, Anne M; Otten, Wilma; Dupuis, Heleen M; Kievit, Job\n\n2004-01-01\n\nEthicists differ considerably in their reasons for using empirical data. This paper presents a brief overview of four traditional approaches to the use of empirical data: \"the prescriptive applied ethicists,\" \"the theorists,\" \"the critical applied ethicists,\" and \"the particularists.\" The main aim of this paper is to introduce a fifth approach of more recent date (i.e. \"integrated empirical ethics\") and to offer some methodological directives for research in integrated empirical ethics. All five approaches are presented in a table for heuristic purposes. The table consists of eight columns: \"view on distinction descriptive-prescriptive sciences,\" \"location of moral authority,\" \"central goal(s),\" \"types of normativity,\" \"use of empirical data,\" \"method,\" \"interaction empirical data and moral theory,\" and \"cooperation with descriptive sciences.\" Ethicists can use the table in order to identify their own approach. Reflection on these issues prior to starting research in empirical ethics should lead to harmonization of the different scientific disciplines and effective planning of the final research design. Integrated empirical ethics (IEE) refers to studies in which ethicists and descriptive scientists cooperate together continuously and intensively. Both disciplines try to integrate moral theory and empirical data in order to reach a normative conclusion with respect to a specific social practice. IEE is not wholly prescriptive or wholly descriptive since IEE assumes an interdepence between facts and values and between the empirical and the normative. The paper ends with three suggestions for consideration on some of the future challenges of integrated empirical ethics.\n\nLong memory and volatility clustering: Is the empirical evidence consistent across stock markets?\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nBentes, SÃ³nia R.; Menezes, Rui; Mendes, Diana A.\n\n2008-06-01\n\nLong memory and volatility clustering are two stylized facts frequently related to financial markets. Traditionally, these phenomena have been studied based on conditionally heteroscedastic models like ARCH, GARCH, IGARCH and FIGARCH, inter alia. One advantage of these models is their ability to capture nonlinear dynamics. Another interesting manner to study the volatility phenomenon is by using measures based on the concept of entropy. In this paper we investigate the long memory and volatility clustering for the SP 500, NASDAQ 100 and Stoxx 50 indexes in order to compare the US and European Markets. Additionally, we compare the results from conditionally heteroscedastic models with those from the entropy measures. In the latter, we examine Shannon entropy, Renyi entropy and Tsallis entropy. The results corroborate the previous evidence of nonlinear dynamics in the time series considered.\n\nMetaphysical accounts of the zygote as a person and the veto power of facts.\n\nPubMed\n\nBole, T J\n\n1989-12-01\n\nThat the soul of a human person is infused at conception is a metaphysical claim. But given its traditional articulation, it has the empirical consequence that the zygote must have a substantial continuity with the adult person, a continuity which is already determined at conception. This empirical consequence is contradicted by the fact that the zygote may become a hydatidiform mole, or several persons. The metaphysical claim is falsified by the facts.\n\nEmpirical behavior of a world stock index from intra-day to monthly time scales\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nBreymann, W.; LÃ¼thi, D. R.; Platen, E.\n\n2009-10-01\n\nMost of the papers that study the distributional and fractal properties of financial instruments focus on stock prices or foreign exchange rates. This typically leads to mixed results concerning the distributions of log-returns and some multi-fractal properties of exchange rates, stock prices, and regional indices. This paper uses a well diversified world stock index as the central object of analysis. Such index approximates the growth optimal portfolio, which is demonstrated under the benchmark approach, it is the ideal reference unit for studying basic securities. When denominating this world index in units of a given currency, one measures the movements of the currency against the entire market. This provides a least disturbed observation of the currency dynamics. In this manner, one can expect to disentangle, e.g., the superposition of the two currencies involved in an exchange rate. This benchmark approach to the empirical analysis of financial data allows us to establish remarkable stylized facts. Most important is the observation that the repeatedly documented multi-fractal appearance of financial time series is very weak and much less pronounced than the deviation of the mono-scaling properties from Brownian-motion type scaling. The generalized Hurst exponent H(2) assumes typical values between 0.55 and 0.6. Accordingly, autocorrelations of log-returns decay according to a power law, and the quadratic variation vanishes when going to vanishing observation time step size. Furthermore, one can identify the Student t distribution as the log-return distribution of a well-diversified world stock index for long time horizons when a long enough data series is used for estimation. The study of dependence properties, finally, reveals that jumps at daily horizon originate primarily in the stock market while at 5min horizon they originate in the foreign exchange market. The principal message of the empirical analysis is that there is evidence that a diffusion model\n\nJuries and Medical Malpractice Claims: Empirical Facts versus Myths\n\nPubMed Central\n\n2008-01-01\n\nJuries in medical malpractice trials are viewed as incompetent, antidoctor, irresponsible in awarding damages to patients, and casting a threatening shadow over the settlement process. Several decades of systematic empirical research yields little support for these claims. This article summarizes those findings. Doctors win about three cases of four that go to trial. Juries are skeptical about inflated claims. Jury verdicts on negligence are roughly similar to assessments made by medical experts and judges. Damage awards tend to correlate positively with the severity of injury. There are defensible reasons for large damage awards. Moreover, the largest awards are typically settled for much less than the verdicts.

This model relies on a nonstationary Gaussian process that exhibits aging behavior. It turns out that its properties, over any finite time interval, are very close to continuous cascade models. These latter models are indeed well known to reproduce faithfully the main stylized facts of financial time series. However, it involves a large-scale parameter (the so-called âintegral scaleâ where the cascade is initiated) that is hard to interpret in finance. Moreover, the empirical value of the integral scale is in general deeply correlated to the overall length of the sample. This feature is precisely predicted by our model, which, as illustrated by various examples from daily stock index data, quantitatively reproduces the empirical observations.\n\nUnderstanding the determinants of volatility clustering in terms of stationary Markovian processes\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nMiccichÃ¨, S.\n\n2016-11-01\n\nVolatility is a key variable in the modeling of financial markets. The most striking feature of volatility is that it is a long-range correlated stochastic variable, i.e. its autocorrelation function decays like a power-law Ï-Î² for large time lags. In the present work we investigate the determinants of such feature, starting from the empirical observation that the exponent Î² of a certain stock's volatility is a linear function of the average correlation of such stock's volatility with all other volatilities. We propose a simple approach consisting in diagonalizing the cross-correlation matrix of volatilities and investigating whether or not the diagonalized volatilities still keep some of the original volatility stylized facts. As a result, the diagonalized volatilities result to share with the original volatilities either the power-law decay of the probability density function and the power-law decay of the autocorrelation function. This would indicate that volatility clustering is already present in the diagonalized un-correlated volatilities. We therefore present a parsimonious univariate model based on a non-linear Langevin equation that well reproduces these two stylized facts of volatility. The model helps us in understanding that the main source of volatility clustering, once volatilities have been diagonalized, is that the economic forces driving volatility can be modeled in terms of a Smoluchowski potential with logarithmic tails.\n\nBeyond the power law: Uncovering stylized facts in interbank networks\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nVandermarliere, Benjamin; Karas, Alexei; Ryckebusch, Jan; Schoors, Koen\n\n2015-06-01\n\nWe use daily data on bilateral interbank exposures and monthly bank balance sheets to study network characteristics of the Russian interbank market over August 1998-October 2004. Specifically, we examine the distributions of (un)directed (un)weighted degree, nodal attributes (bank assets, capital and capital-to-assets ratio) and edge weights (loan size and counterparty exposure). We search for the theoretical distribution that fits the data best and report the \"best\" fit parameters. We observe that all studied distributions are heavy tailed. The fat tail typically contains 20% of the data and can be mostly described well by a truncated power law. Also the power law, stretched exponential and log-normal provide reasonably good fits to the tails of the data. In most cases, however, separating the bulk and tail parts of the data is hard, so we proceed to study the full range of the events. We find that the stretched exponential and the log-normal distributions fit the full range of the data best. These conclusions are robust to (1) whether we aggregate the data over a week, month, quarter or year; (2) whether we look at the \"growth\" versus \"maturity\" phases of interbank market development; and (3) with minor exceptions, whether we look at the \"normal\" versus \"crisis\" operation periods. In line with prior research, we find that the network topology changes greatly as the interbank market moves from a \"normal\" to a \"crisis\" operation period.\n\nAnomalous Price Impact and the Critical Nature of Liquidity in Financial Markets\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nTÃ³th, B.; LempÃ©riÃ¨re, Y.; Deremble, C.; de Lataillade, J.; Kockelkoren, J.; Bouchaud, J.-P.\n\n2011-10-01\n\nWe propose a dynamical theory of market liquidity that predicts that the average supply/demand profile is V shaped and vanishes around the current price. This result is generic, and only relies on mild assumptions about the order flow and on the fact that prices are, to a first approximation, diffusive. This naturally accounts for two striking stylized facts: First, large metaorders have to be fragmented in order to be digested by the liquidity funnel, which leads to a long memory in the sign of the order flow. Second, the anomalously small local liquidity induces a breakdown of the linear response and a diverging impact of small orders, explaining the âsquare-rootâ impact law, for which we provide additional empirical support. Finally, we test our arguments quantitatively using a numerical model of order flow based on the same minimal ingredients.\n\n\"Learning Science Is About Facts and Language Learning Is About Being Discursive\"-An Empirical Investigation of Students' Disciplinary Beliefs in the Context of Argumentation.\n\nPubMed\n\nHeitmann, Patricia; Hecht, Martin; Scherer, Ronny; Schwanewedel, Julia\n\n2017-01-01\n\nArgumentation is considered crucial in numerous disciplines in schools and universities because it constitutes an important proficiency in peoples' daily and professional lives. However, it is unclear whether argumentation is understood and practiced in comparable ways across disciplines. This study consequently examined empirically how students perceive argumentation in science and (first) language lessons. Specifically, we investigated students' beliefs about the relevance of discourse and the role of facts . Data from 3,258 high school students from 85 German secondary schools were analyzed with multigroup multilevel structural equation modeling in order to disentangle whether or not differences in argumentation across disciplines exist and the extent to which variation in students' beliefs can be explained by gender and school track. Results showed that students perceived the role of facts as highly relevant for science lessons, whereas discursive characteristics were considered significantly less important. In turn, discourse played a central role in language lessons, which was believed to require less knowledge of facts . These differences were independent of students' gender. In contrast, school track predicted the differences in beliefs significantly. Our findings lend evidence on the existence of disciplinary school cultures in argumentation that may be the result of differences in teachers' school-track-specific classroom practice and education. Implications in terms of a teacher's role in establishing norms for scientific argumentation as well as the impact of students' beliefs on their learning outcomes are discussed.\n\nCritical Realism and Empirical Bioethics: A Methodological Exposition.\n\nPubMed\n\nMcKeown, Alex\n\n2017-09-01\n\nThis paper shows how critical realism can be used to integrate empirical data and philosophical analysis within 'empirical bioethics'. The term empirical bioethics, whilst appearing oxymoronic, simply refers to an interdisciplinary approach to the resolution of practical ethical issues within the biological and life sciences, integrating social scientific, empirical data with philosophical analysis. It seeks to achieve a balanced form of ethical deliberation that is both logically rigorous and sensitive to context, to generate normative conclusions that are practically applicable to the problem, challenge, or dilemma. Since it incorporates both philosophical and social scientific components, empirical bioethics is a field that is consistent with the use of critical realism as a research methodology. The integration of philosophical and social scientific approaches to ethics has been beset with difficulties, not least because of the irreducibly normative, rather than descriptive, nature of ethical analysis and the contested relation between fact and value. However, given that facts about states of affairs inform potential courses of action and their consequences, there is a need to overcome these difficulties and successfully integrate data with theory. Previous approaches have been formulated to overcome obstacles in combining philosophical and social scientific perspectives in bioethical analysis; however each has shortcomings. As a mature interdisciplinary approach critical realism is well suited to empirical bioethics, although it has hitherto not been widely used. Here I show how it can be applied to this kind of research and explain how it represents an improvement on previous approaches.\n\nInformal Taxation*\n\nPubMed Central\n\nOlken, Benjamin A.; Singhal, Monica\n\n2011-01-01\n\nInformal payments are a frequently overlooked source of local public finance in developing countries. We use microdata from ten countries to establish stylized facts on the magnitude, form, and distributional implications of this âinformal taxation.â Informal taxation is widespread, particularly in rural areas, with substantial in-kind labor payments. The wealthy pay more, but pay less in percentage terms, and informal taxes are more regressive than formal taxes. Failing to include informal taxation underestimates household tax burdens and revenue decentralization in developing countries. We discuss various explanations for and implications of these observed stylized facts.

However, the relationship between facts and values is still not clear in HTA. This is problematic in an era of \"fake facts\" and \"truth production.\" Accordingly, the objective of this study is to clarify the relationship between facts and values in HTA. We start with the perspectives of the traditional positivist account of \"evaluating facts\" and the social-constructivist account of \"facting values.\" Our analysis reveals diverse relationships between facts and a spectrum of values, ranging from basic human values, to the values of health professionals, and values of and in HTA, as well as for decision making. We argue for sensitivity to the relationship between facts and values on all levels of HTA, for being open and transparent about the values guiding the production of facts, and for a primacy for the values close to the principal goals of health care, ie, relieving suffering. We maintain that philosophy (in particular ethics) may have an important role in addressing the relationship between facts and values in HTA. Philosophy may help us to avoid fallacies of inferring values from facts; to disentangle the normative assumptions in the production or presentation of facts and to tease out implicit value judgements in HTA; to analyse evaluative argumentation relating to facts about technologies; to address conceptual issues of normative importance; and to promote reflection on HTA's own value system. In this we argue for a(n Aristotelian) middle way between the traditional positivist account of \"evaluating facts\" and the social-constructivist account of \"facting values,\" which we call \"factuation.\" We conclude that HTA is unique in bringing together facts and values and that being conscious and explicit about this \"factuation\" is key to making HTA valuable to both individual decision makers and society as a whole.

N.; Kostal, H.\n\n1983-01-01\n\nMulti-channel LANDSAT data are collected in several passes over agricultural areas during the growing season. How empirical Bayes modeling can be used to develop crop identification and discrimination techniques that account for spatial correlation in such data is considered. The approach models the unobservable parameters and the data separately, hoping to take advantage of the fact that the bulk of spatial correlation lies in the parameter process. The problem is then framed in terms of estimating posterior probabilities of crop types for each spatial area. Some empirical Bayes spatial estimation methods are used to estimate the logits of these probabilities.\n\nUnderstanding Aging and Disability Perspectives on Home Care: Uncovering Facts and Values in Public-Policy Narratives and Discourse\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nClark, Phillip G.\n\n2007-01-01\n\nEvery public-policy problem can be defined in terms of its empirical (\"facts\") and normative (\"values\") dimensions and the interrelationship between them.

Specifically, two crucial questions pertain, respectively, to the possibility of inferring normative statements from descriptive statements, and to the danger of a loss of normativity if normative statements should be based on empirical research. Here we take part in the debate and defend integrated empirical ethical research: research in which normative guidelines are established on the basis of empirical research and in which the guidelines are empirically evaluated by focusing on observable consequences. We argue that in our concrete example normative statements are not derived from descriptive statements, but are developed within a process of reflection and dialogue that goes on within a specific praxis. Moreover, we show that the distinction in experience between the desirable and the undesirable precludes relativism. The normative guidelines so developed are both critical and normative: they help in choosing the right action and in evaluating that action. Finally, following Aristotle, we plead for a return to the view that morality and ethics are inherently related to one another, and for an acknowledgment of the fact that moral judgments have their origin in experience which is always related to historical and cultural circumstances.\n\nA detailed heterogeneous agent model for a single asset financial market with trading via an order book.\n\nPubMed\n\nMota Navarro, Roberto; Larralde, HernÃ¡n\n\n2017-01-01\n\nWe present an agent based model of a single asset financial market that is capable of replicating most of the non-trivial statistical properties observed in real financial markets, generically referred to as stylized facts. In our model agents employ strategies inspired on those used in real markets, and a realistic trade mechanism based on a double auction order book. We study the role of the distinct types of trader on the return statistics: specifically, correlation properties (or lack thereof), volatility clustering, heavy tails, and the degree to which the distribution can be described by a log-normal. Further, by introducing the practice of \"profit taking\", our model is also capable of replicating the stylized fact related to an asymmetry in the distribution of losses and gains.\n\nMinimal agent based model for financial markets II.
