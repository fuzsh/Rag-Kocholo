        "text": "Foreword\n\nThe growth of responsible investment brings with it increased expectations. Part of that expectation centres on communication. Investors need language that enables them to communicate their responsible investment practices accurately, succinctly, and consistently.\n\nThe PRI sees great value in partnering with CFA Institute, Global Sustainable Investment Alliance, and others in the responsible investment industry to standardise terminology. By unifying around common definitions, we support our signatories and members to communicate with confidence.\n\nDavid Atkin, CEO, PRI\n\nDuring the past decade, many investors have shown an increased interest in environmental, social, and corporate governance issues. Although this interest has spurred new ideas and practices, it has also introduced new terminology into our lexicon that may not be initially clear or widely understood.\n\nAs practice has evolved and matured, CFA Institute recognised the opportunity to work alongside fellow global standard setters, PRI and Global Sustainable Investment Alliance, to bring greater clarity and harmony to our definitions of these investment approaches. This effort is critical to ensure that professionals can communicate efficiently and effectively with each other, as well as investors and industry professionals across the market.\n\nWe believe this work will serve as a valuable resource for CFA charterholders, members, and candidates, as well as participants and regulators of capital markets on a global scale.\n\nMargaret Franklin, CFA, President and CEO, CFA Institute\n\nWe release these definitions as a public good for the global financial services industry, to create a consistent foundation for the continued professionalisation of responsible investment.\n\nThis effort draws on a long history of work to standardise core industry terminology. It follows an extensive process to refine these, undertaken collaboratively by the largest collective industry bodies globally.\n\nWe now encourage the global industry and regulators to adopt these definitions, particularly for developing labeling and disclosure standards that reduce confusion and provide our beneficiaries with greater clarity, consistency, and certainty.\n\nSimon Oâ€™Connor, Chair, Global Sustainable Investment Alliance; CEO, Responsible Investment Association Australasia\n\nIntroduction\n\nDefinitions\n\nAbout the CFA Institute Research and Policy Center\n\nCFA Institute Research and Policy Center brings together CFA Institute expertise along with a diverse, cross-disciplinary community of subject matter experts working collaboratively to address complex problems. It is informed by the perspective of practitioners and the convening power, impartiality, and credibility of CFA Institute, whose mission is to lead the investment profession globally by promoting the highest stan dards of ethics, education, and professional excellence for the ultimate benefit of society. For more information, visit rpc.cfainstitute.org.\n\nAbout the Global Sustainable Investment Alliance (GSIA)\n\nGSIA is a global collaboration of membership organisations, aiming to unlock the power of the worldwide financial services industry to drive leadership, achieve a substantial impact on key global challenges, and accelerate the transition to a sustainable future. GSIA simultaneously works to enhance the synergies between members, participate in global initiatives, and provide advice and support to local and regional sustainable investment organisations as they setup and grow."
