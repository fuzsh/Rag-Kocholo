The purpose of this article is to examine some fundamental statistical behavior of financial time series as well as nonlinearity associated with them. The knowledge of such facts could be helpful to establish better empirical models, which is nonlinear most of the times, in order to produce reliable forecasts. Also, it illustrates the importance of stationarity in financial time series analysis and the concepts behind the most used statistical tests for checking the stationarity of a series such as Augmented Dickey – Fuller Test and Phillips-Perron Test, using ten fast growing stock market indices across the globe. After observing the principal stylized facts of returns of a given asset for the empirical financial data, could be in a more comfortable situation to choose a proper model for better forecast. Keywords— financial time series; stylized facts of financial time series; stationarity; Augmented Dickey – Fuller Test; Phillips-Perron Test.",
