        "text": "The financing of elections and political parties (political finance) is a thorny governance domain because the actors whose interests are most affected by political finance rules, namely political parties, also normally create those rules (Koß Reference Koß2010, 6). To explain change from one kind of funding arrangement (that is, a particular combination of state subventions, private donations, party membership dues, and illicit funding) to another, the comparative empirical scholarship highlights the role of parties' organizational motivations; the attributes of a country's party system, such as its levels of fragmentation and polarization; and contingent factors including the effects of highly publicized scandals and influential anti-corruption drives (see, for example, Clift and Fisher Reference Clift and Fisher2004; Koß Reference Koß2010; Nwokora Reference Nwokora2014). Meanwhile, a normative research agenda identifies first-order principles – especially political equality, liberty, freedom of expression, representation, participation, transparency, and anticorruption – that should inform the design, reform, and implementation of financing rules (Cagé Reference Cagé2020; Dawood Reference Dawood2015; de Sousa Reference de Sousa2001; Grant and Rudolph Reference Grant and Rudolph2004; Pevnick Reference Pevnick2016; Tham Reference Tham2010). This paper sketches a framework that bridges these two lines of research by offering a context-sensitive and empirically grounded approach to the normative evaluation of political finance rules.\n\nThe framework proposes that political finance rules should be normatively assessed in tandem with the party system – defined as the collection of and interactions between political parties (Sartori Reference Sartori2005; see also Bardi and Mair Reference Bardi and Mair2008) – which they operate alongside. Though a party-system lens has been applied in comparative and country-specific studies of political finance (Koß Reference Koß2010; La Raja Reference La Raja2008; La Raja and Schaffner Reference La Raja and Schaffner2015; Nwokora Reference Nwokora2014), it has yet to be integrated into normative theorizing on this topic. Furthermore, our framework is rooted in insights from the normative literature on political parties that has emerged in political theory over the past two decades (Bonotti Reference Bonotti2017; Muirhead Reference Muirhead2014; Rosenblum Reference Rosenblum2008; White and Ypi Reference White and Ypi2016; Wolkenstein Reference Wolkenstein2019). This scholarship develops what we describe as ‘the normative theory of partisanship’, which elaborates two dimensions (collegiality and linkage) along which parties and partisans, at their best, contribute to democratic governance, and in terms of which their performance can be assessed. The considerations captured by these dimensions overlap with some of the first-order principles that receive attention in the normative political finance scholarship and in research on corruption and democracy (Ceva and Ferretti Reference Ceva and Ferretti2018; Della Porta and Vannucci Reference della Porta, Vannucci, Amenta, Nash and Scott2012; Warren Reference Warren2004), yet the normative theory of partisanship operationalizes these ideals for the purpose of evaluating parties and their institutional environments. Our analysis applies this theory to political finance and party systems for the first time."
