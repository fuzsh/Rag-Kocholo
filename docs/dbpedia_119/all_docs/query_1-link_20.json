        "meta_description": "Physicists have long contributed to the fields of economics and finance, addressing phenomena that conventional financial theories fail to explain. This includes the analysis of systemic risks in financial networks, where statistical physics has significantly contributed by providing new metrics and models to assess financial stability. Agent-based modelling is another example, helping to explain the formation of financial bubbles and crises. Physicists have also introduced information theory to quantify the uncertainty, complexity, and disorder in financial systems. The recent rise of quantum finance exemplifies this, as it applies theories and methods from quantum physics to economics and finance. The contributions of econophysics extend far beyond these examples, and by incorporating insights from physics, researchers can develop models that explain complex economic behaviours.Econophysicists often face challenges finding suitable journals to publish their articles, as econophysics is not yet a mainstream topic. It faces criticism from economists, and many economic journals are reluctant to publish on this theme. With Frontiers in Physics, we aim to help reach a broader audience with more diverse backgrounds. Thus, this research topic intends to bridge the gap between mainstream economists and physicists and is open to researchers in both fields. The goal is to attract a wider research community to study financial and economic behaviours.Examples of research targets inc...",
