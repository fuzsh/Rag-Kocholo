        "text": "Exact sciences have achieved many results, validated in practice. Although their application in economics is difficult due to the human factor involved, the lack of conservation laws, and experimental difficulties, it must be highlighted that the consistent bibliography gathered in recent years in this field encourages the econophysics approach. The objective of this article is to validate and/or define a few stock strategies, based on known results from mathematics, physics, and chemistry. The scope of this research demonstrates that statistics (in portfolio theory), geometry (in technical analysis), or financial mathematics can be used in the capital market. Many of the exact science results corresponded to strategies applicable to investors. Unlike the material world, financial markets have additional components that must be considered: human psychology, sociology at the firm level, and behavioral unpredictability. The findings obtained in this research enable the enormous vastne...\n\nThe relationship between physics and economics has a long and interesting history. Outstanding economists of the past explicitly inspired their work to the principles of Newtonian physics and statistical mechanics, attracted by the success of these theories. However, despite the existence of many problems of common interest, the interaction between statistical physicists and economists has never been strong."
