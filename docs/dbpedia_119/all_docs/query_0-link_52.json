The Subcommittee met, pursuant to call, at 10:04 a.m., in Room 2318 of the Rayburn House Office Building, Hon. Brad Miller [Chairman of the Subcommittee] presiding. hearing charter SUBCOMMITTEE ON INVESTIGATIONS AND OVERSIGHT COMMITTEE ON SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY U.S. HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES The Risks of Financial Modeling: VaR and the Economic Meltdown thursday, september 10, 2009 10:00 a.m.-1:00 p.m. 2318 rayburn house office building Purpose The Subcommittee on Investigations and Oversight on Sept. 10, 2009 convenes the first Congressional hearing to examine the role of risk modeling in the global financial meltdown. Risk models, and specifically a method of risk measurement known as Value-at-Risk, or VaR, are widely viewed as an important factor in the extreme risk- taking that financial institutions engaged in leading to last year's economic upheaval. That risk-taking has led to hundreds of billions of dollars in losses to financial firms, and to a global recession with trillions of dollars in direct and indirect costs imposed on U.S. taxpayers and working families. Given the central role of credit in the economy, the ability of major financial institutions to operate without assuming undue risks that gamble with the stability of the financial system, thereby endangering the broader economy, is of the utmost importance to both business and the public at large. The recent behavior by financial firms that are deemed ``too big to fail'' suggests that the financial system as currently structured and regulated creates a ``moral hazard'' because firms can expect that they will be bailed out if their risk- taking fails to pay off. This is exactly what happened in the United States in October of 2008 with great consequences to the taxpayers, who have been called upon to shoulder much of the huge burden arising from financial firms' underestimation of risk, poor judgment, and profligate behavior. Relied on to guide the decisions of both financial firms and federal regulators responsible for monitoring their soundness by ensuring that they have sufficient capital, the VaR, whether it was misused or not, was involved in inducing or allowing this situation to arise. Given this dual function, it is critical that the Subcommittee examine: the role of the VaR and related risk-measurement methods in the current world financial crisis; the strengths and weaknesses of, and the limits to, the usefulness of the VaR; the degree to which the VaR is understood, and may be manipulated, within the institutions where it is in use; and the capabilities and needs of federal supervisors who may be called upon to work with the VaR in carrying out their regulatory duties. From a policy perspective, the most important question is how regulators will use VaR numbers produced by firms and whether it is an appropriate guide to setting capital reserve requirements. This is the second in a series of hearings on how economic thinking and methods have been used by policy-makers both inside and outside of government. The VaR's Origins and Use Risk assessment models in the financial industry are the product of advances in economic and statistical methods developed in the social sciences over the last fifty years. J.P. Morgan adopted these techniques in developing the VaR in the 1980s as a tool to measure the risk of loss to its traders' portfolios. The VaR could produce a single number rating a trader's (or, in aggregate, the firm's cumulative) risk of loss of portfolio value over a specific period of time at a given level of confidence. The VaR provided managers a tool that appeared to allow them to keep a handle on the risks they were taking as financial instruments became more varied and complex and as assets became more difficult to value. Morgan decided to give the methodology of the VaR away, forming the now-independent RiskMetrics Group; this resulted in the VaR rapidly becoming ``so popular that it was considered the risk- model gold standard.'' \\1\\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\1\\ ``Risk Management,'' by Joe Nocera, New York Times, Jan. 4, 2009. J.P. Morgan was not the only firm to look for statistical tools to measure the risks of their portfolios, however Morgan's model became the most widely used. The model can be tweaked in many, many ways to meet the specific needs of a particular firm. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- To put it very simply, the VaR captures the probability of outcomes distributed along a curve-most commonly a ``bell'' or normal distribution. It provides an answer to the question of, ``what is likely to happen tomorrow to the value of an asset?'' by drawing from historical performance data. The highest probability of tomorrow's value is that it will be the same as today's value; the next highest probability is for a very small movement in value up or down, and so on. The more radical the movement in value, the lower the probability of that occurring. A manager may ask for a projection of the potential loss of an asset or portfolio at the 95 percent or even the 99 percent confidence level. At those levels, a complete loss of value is unlikely. The complete collapse of an asset or portfolio's value is not a 1-in-100 event; such a collapse is more likely a 1-in-500 or 1-in- 10,000 or event. The VaR is unlikely to warn, then, of great shifts in value. The danger to the financial firm or the community comes at the extreme margins of the distribution curves produced by the VaR. As a map to day-to-day behavior, the VaR is probably pretty accurate for normal times, but for asset bubbles or other ``non-normal'' market conditions, the VaR is likely to misrepresent risks and dangers. While the VaR was originally designed for financial institutions' use in-house, it has subsequently been given a key role in determining capital requirements for large banks under a major multilateral agreement, the Basel II Accord, published in 2004. That same year, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission adopted a capital regime applying Basel II standards to the Nation's largest investment banks,\\2\\ a move that has been viewed as playing a role in those institutions' subsequent over-leveraging and liquidity problems. Those financial institutions assured regulators that the VaR was a way to see the level of risk they were taking on and a low VaR justified lower reserve requirements. (The terms of Basel II are currently being re- evaluated in light of the global economic crisis.) --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\2\\ ``Alternative Net Capital Requirements for Broker-Dealers That are Part of Consolidated Supervised Entities; Supervised Investment Bank Holding Companies; Final Rules,'' Securities and Exchange Commission, June 21, 2004, 69 FR 34428-72. (According to Aswath Damodaran, Professor of Finance at the NYU Stern School of Business, ``The first regulatory measures that evoke Value-at-Risk, though, were initiated in 1980, when the SEC tied the capital requirements of financial service firms to the losses that would be incurred, with 95 percent confidence over a thirty-day interval, in different security classes; historical returns were used to compute these potential losses. Although the measures were described as haircuts and not as Value or Capital at Risk, it was clear the SEC was requiring financial service firms to embark on the process of estimating one month 95 percent VaRs and hold enough capital to cover the potential losses.'' Damodaran, ``Value-at-Risk (VAR),'' found at http:// pages.stern.nyu.edu/?adamodar/pdfiles/papers/VAR.pdf) --------------------------------------------------------------------------- Along with extensive use, the VaR has come in for extensive criticism. Although its merits were debated at least as far back as 1997,\\3\\ criticism of the VaR has mounted in the wake of last year's collapse of such major financial institutions as Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers. Among the allegations: that the VaR is inadequate in capturing risks of extreme magnitude but low probability, to which an institution may be left vulnerable; that this shortcoming may open it to manipulation by traders taking positions that seem profitable but whose risks they know the VaR is unlikely to pick up, and that such ``gaming'' can increase extreme risk; and that use of the VaR, derided for ``quantify[ing] the immeasurable with great precision,'' \\4\\ promotes an unfounded sense of security within financial institutions creating an environment where firms take on more risk than they would without the security-blanket of a VaR number. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\3\\ ``The Jorion-Taleb Debate,'' DerivativesStrategy.com, April 1997, http://www.derivativesstrategy.com/magazine/archive/1997/ 0497fea2.asp \\4\\ ``Against VAR,'' by Nassim Taleb, in ``The Jorion-Taleb Debate,'' ibid. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- Those who advocate for the VaR argue that any misuse of the model is not the model's fault and that it remains a useful management tool. VaR defenders' argue that its purpose is ``not to describe the worst possible outcomes;'' \\5\\ that it is essential to the ability of a financial institution to arrive at an estimate of its overall risk; and that in ``computing their VAR[, institutions] are forced to confront their exposure to financial risks and to set up a proper risk management function,'' so that ``the process of getting to VAR may be as important as the number itself.'' \\6\\ Some also argue that the VaR remains a useful tool for regulators to use as a baseline for establishing reserve requirements for ``normal'' times. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\5\\ ``In Defense of VAR,'' by Philippe Jorion, in ``The Jorion- Taleb Debate,'' ibid. \\6\\ Jorion, idem. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- Witnesses Panel I Dr. Nassim Nicholas Taleb, Distinguished Professor of Risk Engineering, Polytechnic Institute of New York University.

Good morning, and welcome to today's hearing: ``The Risks of Financial Modeling: VaR and the Economic Meltdown.'' Economics has not been known in the past for mathematical precision. Harry Truman said he wanted a one-handed economist because he was frustrated with economists who equivocated by saying on the one hand, on the other hand. George Bernard Shaw said that if all the world's economists were laid end to end, they still wouldn't reach a conclusion. And apparently no one is sure who first observed that economics was the only field in which it was possible for two people to share a Nobel Prize for reaching exactly the opposite conclusion about the same question. In the last 15 or 20 years, math and physics Ph.D.s from academia and the laboratory have entered the financial sector. Quantitative analysts, or `quants,' directed their mathematical and statistical skills to financial forecasts at a time when global financial markets were becoming more interdependent than ever before. The quants conceived such financial instruments as collaterized debt obligations, or CDOs, and credit default swaps, or CDSs, that would never have existed without them and their computers. They developed strategies for trading those instruments even in the absence of any underlying security or any real market; for that matter, in the absence of anything at all. They constructed risk models that convinced their less scientifically and technologically adept bosses that their instruments and strategies were infallibly safe. And their bosses spread the faith in the quants' models to regulators, who agreed to apply them to establish capital reserve requirements that were supposed to guarantee the soundness of financial institutions against adverse events. It almost seemed like the economic models had brought the precision of the laws of physics, the same kind of certainty about the movement of the planets, to financial risk management. Engineering schools even offered courses in ``financial engineering.'' The supposedly immutable laws underlying the quants' models, however, didn't work out, and the complex models turned out to have hidden risks rather than protecting against them, all at a terrible cost. Those risks, concealed and maybe even encouraged by the models, have led to hundreds of billions of dollars in losses to investors and taxpayers, to a global recession imposing trillions of dollars in losses to the world economy and immeasurable monetary and human costs. People around the world are losing their homes, their jobs, their dignity and their hope. Taxpayers here and around the world are shouldering the burden arising from financial firms' miscalculation of risk, poor judgment, excessive bonuses and general profligate behavior. It is for this reason that the Subcommittee is directing our attention today to the intersection of quantitative analysis, economics and regulation. The Value-at- Risk model, or VaR, stands squarely at the intersection of quantitative analysis, economics and regulation. It is the most prominent risk model used by major financial institutions. The VaR is designed to provide an answer to the question, ``What is the potential loss that could be faced within a limited, specified time to the value of an asset?'' The highest probability is that tomorrow's value will be the same as today's. The next highest probability is that there will be a small movement in value up or down, and so on. The more radical the movement in value, the lower the probability that it will happen. In other words, the danger to a financial firm or the community comes at the extreme margins of the VaR distribution curve, in the tails of the distribution. As a map to day-to-day behavior, the VaR is probably pretty accurate for normal times, just as teams favored by odds makers usually win. But just as long shots sometimes come home, just as underdogs do sometimes win, asset bubbles or other non-normal market conditions also occur, and the VaR is unlikely to capture the risks and dangers. The VaR also cannot tell you when you have moved into non-normal market conditions. While the VaR was originally designed for financial institutions' in-house use to evaluate short-term risk in their trading books, it has been given a key role in determining capital requirements for large banks under a major multilateral agreement, the Basel II Accord, published in 2004. That same year, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, the SEC, at the instigation of the five largest investment banks, adopted a capital reserve regime, applying Basel II standards to the Nation's largest investment banks--a decision that opened the door to their over-leveraging and liquidity problems. Three of the institutions that asked the SEC for this change in rules-- Bear Stearns, Merrill Lynch, Lehman Brothers--no longer exist. At the time, those financial institutions assured regulators that the VaR would reflect the level of risk they were taking on, and that a low VaR justified lower capital requirements. The result was exactly what the investment banks asked for: lower capital requirements that allowed them to invest in even more risky financial instruments all justified with risk models that assured regulators that there was nothing to worry about. What could possibly go wrong? In light of the VaR's prominent role in the financial crisis, this subcommittee is examining that role and the role of related risk-measurement methods. From a policy perspective, the most important immediate question is how regulators use VaR numbers and other such models designed by regulated institutions, and whether they are an appropriate guide to setting capital reserve requirements. But, beyond that, we must also ask whether the scientific and technical capabilities that led us into the current crisis should be applied to prevent future catastrophic events. Can mathematics, statistics and economics produce longer-range models, more reliable models, that could give us early warning when our financial system is headed for trouble? Or are such models inevitably going to be abused to hide risk-taking and encourage gambling by firms whose failures can throw the whole world into a recession, as they have in the last couple of years? If models cannot be a useful guide for regulation, should we just abandon the approach, or simply increase reserves, which will reduce profits and perhaps reduce some useful economic conduct in the short run, but protect taxpayers and the world economy in the long run? Those are big questions, but the stakes for taxpayers and investors and the world economy justify some effort to get at some answers. I now recognize Dr. Broun for his opening statement. [The prepared statement of Chairman Miller follows:] Prepared Statement of Chairman Brad Miller Economics has not been known in the past for mathematical precision.

Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Let me welcome the witnesses here today and thank them for appearing. Today's hearing on financial modeling continues this committee's work on the role of science in finance and economics. As I pointed out in our previous hearing in May, for the last several years Wall Street has increasingly leveraged mathematics, physics and science to better inform their decisions. Even before Value-at-Risk was developed to characterize risk, bankers and economists were looking for a silver bullet to help them to beat the market. Despite the pursuit of a scientific panacea for financial decisions, models are simply tools employed by decision-makers and risk managers. They add another layer of insight but are not crystal balls. Leveraging a position too heavily or assuming future solvency based on modeling data alone is hazardous, to say the least. Conversely, it stands to reason that if we could accurately predict markets, then both losses and profits would be limited since there would be very little risk involved. Modeling is a subject this committee has addressed several times in the past, whether it is in regard to climate change, chemical exposures, pandemics, determining spacecraft survivability or attempting to value complex financial instruments. Models are only as good as the data and assumptions that go into them. Ultimately decisions have to be made based on a number of variables which should include scientific models but certainly not exclusively. As witnesses in our previous hearing stated, ``Science describes, it does not prescribe.'' No model will ever relieve a banker, trader or risk manager of the responsibility to make difficult decisions and hedge inevitable uncertainly. This committee struggles enough with the complexities of modeling, risk assessment and risk management regarding physical sciences. Attempting to adapt those concepts to economics and finance is even more complex. Appreciating this complexity and understanding the limitations and intended purpose of financial models is just as important as what the models tell you. We have two esteemed panels of witnesses here today who will discuss appropriate roles and limitations of models such as VaR. They will explain how these models are used and shed some light on what role they may have played in the recent economic crisis. I look forward to you all's testimony and I yield back my time. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. [The prepared statement of Mr. Broun follows:] Prepared Statement of Representative Paul C. Broun Thank you Mr. Chairman.

Chairman Miller. Thank you, Dr. Broun. I now ask unanimous consent that all additional opening statements submitted by Members be included in the record. Without objection, that is so ordered. Panel I: We do have an outstanding group of witnesses today. I know that Chairmen at hearings always say that but it is certainly true. This time I mean it. On our first panel, we have two very well known and respected authors whose books and other writings warned against many of the practices of the financial industry that resulted in the current economic meltdown. Both of them have years of experience on Wall Street. Dr. Nassim Taleb is the author of ``Fooled by Randomness'' and ``The Black Swan.'' After a career as a trader and fund manager, Dr. Taleb is now the Distinguished Professor of Risk Engineering at the Polytechnic Institute of New York University. And if you are one of that slice of the American population for whom Bloomberg and CNBC are your favorite TV channels, Dr. Taleb is a rock star. Dr. Taleb is joined by another rock star, Dr. Richard Bookstaber, who is the author of ``A Demon of Our Own Design: Markets, Hedge Funds and the Risk of Financial Innovation.'' Dr. Bookstaber has worked as a risk manager for Salomon Brothers, Morgan Stanley and Moore Capital Management. He also runs equity funds and he began on Wall Street designing derivative instruments. Does your mother know about that? As our witnesses should know, you will each have five minutes for your spoken testimony. Your written testimony will be included in the record for the hearing. When you all have completed your spoken testimony, we will begin with questions and each Member will have five minutes to question the panel. It is the practice of this subcommittee--it is an investigative and oversight subcommittee--to receive testimony under oath. As I pointed out to the panelists at our last hearing on economic issues, to prosecute a case for perjury, the prosecutor, the U.S. attorney would have to prove what the truth was, that you knew the truth and that you consciously departed from it. I think you can sleep easily without worrying about a prosecution for perjury, but we will ask you to take an oath. Do either of you have any objection to taking an oath? Okay. You also have the right to be represented by counsel. Do either of you have counsel here? If you would, please stand and raise your right hand. Do you swear to tell the truth and nothing but the truth? The record will reflect that both witnesses did take the oath. We will begin with Dr. Taleb. Dr. Taleb. STATEMENT OF DR. NASSIM N. TALEB, DISTINGUISHED PROFESSOR OF RISK ENGINEERING, POLYTECHNIC INSTITUTE OF NEW YORK UNIVERSITY; PRINCIPAL, UNIVERSA INVESTMENTS L.P. Dr. Taleb. Mr. Chairman, Ranking Member, Members of the Committee, thank you for giving me this opportunity to testify on the risk measurement methods used by banks, particularly those concerned with the risks of VaR events. You know, Value- at-Risk is just a method. It is a very general method, not very precise method, that measures the risks of VaR events. For example, a standard daily Value-at-Risk tells you that if your VaR is a million, daily VaR is a million, you have--it is at one percent probability, that you have less than one percent chance of losing a million or more on a given day. There are of course a lot of variations around VaR. For me, they are equally defective. Thirteen years ago, I wrote that the VaR encourages misdirected people to take risks with shareholders' and ultimately taxpayers' money--that is, regular people's money. I have been since begging for suspension of these measurements of tail risks. We just don't understand tail events. And lot of people say, oh, let's measure risks. My idea is very different. Let's find what risks we can measure and any other risks we should be taking instead of doing it the opposite way. We take a lot of risks and then we try to find some scientists who can confirm these methods, you know, that these risks we can measure and that these methods are sound. I have been begging, and actually I wrote that I would be on the witness stand 13 years ago, and today I am here. The banking system lost so far more than $4.3 trillion, according to the International Monetary Fund--that is more than they ever made in the history of banking--on tail risks, measurements of rare events. Most of the losses of course were in the United States, and I am not counting the economic consequences. But this shouldn't have happened. Data shows that banks routinely lose everything they made over a long period of time in one single blow-up. It happened in 1982 because of multi-center banks losing everything made in the history of multi-center banking, one single event, loans to Latin America. The same thing in variation happened in 1991, and of course now. And every time society bails them out. Bank risk takers retain their bonuses and say oh, one fluke, all right, and we start again. This is an aberrant case of capitalism for the profit, and socialism for the losses. So I have five points associated with VaR that I will go over very quickly, and I will give my conclusion. Number one: these problems were obvious all along. This should not have happened. We knew about the defects of the VaR when it was introduced. A lot of traders, a lot of my friends, everyone--I am not the only person ranting against VaR. A lot of people were ranting against it before. Nobody heard us. Regulators did not listen to anyone who knew what was going on, is my point number one. Point number two: VaR is ineffective. I guess I don't need more evidence than the recent events to convince you. Point number three, and that to me is crucial. You have a graph that shows you the performance profile of someone making steady earnings for a long time and then losing back everything. You can see from that graph, figure one on page four, that this is a strategy that is pretty much pursued by the majority of people on Wall Street, by banks. They make steady income for a long time, and when they blow up, they say, well, you know, it was unexpected, it was a black swan. I wrote a book called ``The Black Swan.'' Unfortunately, they used my book backwards. Oh, and it was unexpected, highly unexpected. They keep their bonuses. They go on vacation and here you have a regular person working very hard, a taxpayer, a taxi driver, a post office worker paying taxes to subsidize retrospectively, all right, bonuses made. For example, a former government official made $121 million in bonuses at Citibank. Okay. He keeps his bonuses. We retrospectively are paying for that. That I said 13 years ago, and it keeps happening, and now we are still in the same situation. So number four, and that is another crucial point. VaR has side effects. It is not neutral. You give someone a number--it has been shown and shown repeatedly, if you give someone a number, he will act on that number even if you tell him that that number is random. We humans cannot be trusted with numbers. You don't give someone the map of the Alps if he is on the Mount Ararat, all right, because he is going to act on that map. Even nothing is alot better, if it doesn't work. This is my central point, the side effects of numerical precision given to people who do not need it. Number five: VaR-style quantitative risk management was behind leverage. We increased our leverage in society as we thought we thought we could measure risk. If you think you can measure your blow-up risk, you are going to borrow, you know. You have more overconfidence, also, as a side effect of measurement, and you are going to borrow. Instead of, you know, taking equity from people, you borrow, so when you blow up, you owe that money. And of course, as was discussed in my paper, debt bubbles are very vicious. Equity bubbles are not very vicious. Conclusion: What should we be doing? Well, regulators should understand that finance is a complex system and complex systems have very clear characteristics, you know, and one of them is low levels of predictability, particularly of tail events. We have to worry--regulators should not encourage model error. My idea is to build a society that is resistant to expert mistakes. Regulators increased the dependence of society on expert mistakes and other things also in the Value-at-Risk, these AAA things. Okay. So we want to reduce that. We want to build a society that can sustain shocks because we are moving more and more into a world that delivers very large-scale variables, and we know exactly how they affect us or we know with some precision how they affect us, and we know how to build shocks. So the job of regulators should be to lower the impact of model error, and this is reminiscent of medicine. You know, the FDA, they don't let you bring any medicine without showing the side effects. Well, we should be doing the same thing in economic life. Thank you very much for this opportunity. [The prepared statement of Dr. Taleb follows:] Prepared Statement of Nassim N. Taleb Report on the Risks of Financial Modeling, VaR and the Economic Breakdown INTRODUCTION Mr. Chairman, Ranking Member, Members of the Committee, thank you for giving me the opportunity to testify on the risk measurement methods used by banks, particularly those concerned with blowup risk, estimates of probabilities of losses from extreme events (``tail risks''), generally bundled under VaR.\\1\\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\1\\ The author thanks Daniel Kahneman, Pablo Triana, and Eric Weinstein for helpful discussions. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- What is the VaR? It is simply a model that is supposed to project the expected extreme loss in an institution's portfolio that can occur over a specific time frame at a specified level of confidence. Take an example. A standard daily VaR of $1 million at a one percent probability tells you that you have less than a one percent chance of losing $1 million or more on a given day.\\2\\ There are many modifications around VaR, ``conditional VaR,'' \\3\\ so my discussion concerns all quantitative (and probabilistic) methods concerned with losses associated with rare events. Simply, there are limitations to our ability to measure the risks of extreme events. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\2\\ Although such definition of VaR is often presented as a ``maximum'' loss, it is technically not so in an open-ended exposure: since, conditional on losing more than $1 million, you may lose a lot more, say $5 million. \\3\\ Data shows that methods meant to improve the standard VaR, like ``expected shortfall'' or ``conditional VaR'' are equally defective with economic variables--past losses do not predict future losses. Stress testing is also suspicious because of the subjective nature of ``reasonable stress'' number--we tend to underestimate the magnitude of outliers. ``Jumps'' are not predictable from past jumps. See Taleb, N.N. (in press) ``Errors, robustness, and the fourth quadrant,'' International Journal of Forecasting (2009). --------------------------------------------------------------------------- Thirteen years ago, I warned that ``VaR encourages misdirected people to take risks with shareholders', and ultimately taxpayers' money.'' I have since been begging for the suspension of these measurements of tail risks. But this came a bit late. For the banking system has lost so far, according to the International Monetary Fund, in excess of four trillion dollars directly as a result of faulty risk management. Most of the losses were in the U.S. and will be directly borne by taxpayers. These losses do not include the other costs of the economic crisis. Data shows that banks routinely lose everything earned in their past history in single blowups--this happened in 1982, 1991, and, of course now. Every time society bails them out--while bank risk-takers retain their past bonuses and start the game afresh. This is an aberrant case of capitalism for the profits and socialism for the losses. MAIN PROBLEMS ASSOCIATED WITH VAR-STYLE RISK MEASUREMENT 1. These problems have been obvious all along My first encounter with the VaR was as a derivatives trader in the early 1990s when it was first introduced. I saw its underestimation of the risks of a portfolio by a factor of 100--you set up your book to lose no more than $100,000 and you take a $10,000,000 hit. Worse, there was no way to get a handle on how much its underestimation could be. Using VaR after the crash of 1987 proved strangely gullible. But the fact that its use was not suspended after the many subsequent major events, such as the Long-Term Capital Management blowup in 1998, requires some explanation. Furthermore, regulators started promoting VaR (Basel 2) just as evidence was mounting against it.\\4\\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\4\\ My recollection is that the VaR was not initially taken seriously by traders and managers. It took a long time for the practice to spread--and it was only after regulators got involved that it became widespread. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- 2. VaR is ineffective and lacks in robustness Alas, we cannot ``measure'' the risk of future rare events like we measure the temperature. By robustness, I mean that the measure does not change much if you change the model, technique, or theory. Indeed risk estimation has nothing to do with the notion of measure. And the rarer the event, the harder it is to compute its probability--yet the rarer the event, the larger the consequences.\\5\\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\5\\ See Taleb, N.N. and Pilpel, A. (2007) Epistemology and Risk Management, Risk and Regulation, 13. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- Furthermore, the type of randomness we have with economic variables does not have a well-tractable, well-known structure, and can deliver vastly large events--and we are unable to get a handle on ``how large.'' Conventional statistics, derived on a different class of variables, fail us here.\\6\\,\\7\\G5,\\8\\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\6\\ We are in the worst type of complex system characterized by high interdependence, low predictability, and vulnerability to extreme events. See N.N. Taleb, The Black Swan, Random House, 2007. \\7\\ There are other problems. 1) VaR does not replicate out of sample--the past almost never predicts subsequent blowups. (see data in the Fourth Quadrant). 2) A decrease in VaR does not mean decrease in risks; often quite the opposite holds, which allows the measure to be gamed. \\8\\ The roots of VaR come from modern financial theory (Markowitz, Sharpe, Miller, Merton, Scholes) which, in spite of its patent lack of scientific validity, continues to be taught in business schools. See Taleb, N.N., (2000), The Black Swan: The Impact of the Highly Improbable, Random House. 3. VaR encourages ``low volatility, high blowup'' risk taking which can --------------------------------------------------------------------------- be gamed by the Wall Street bonus structure Figure 1-A typical ``blow-up'' strategy with hidden risks: appearance of low volatility, with a high risk of blowup. The trader makes 11 bonuses, with no subsequent ``clawback'' as losses are borne by shareholders, then taxpayers. This is the profile for banks (losses in 1982,1991, and 2008) and many hedge funds. VaR encourages such types of risk taking. I have shown that operators like to engage in a ``blow-up'' strategy, (switching risks from visible to hidden), which consists in producing steady profits for a long time, collecting bonuses, then losing everything in a single blowup.\\9\\ Such trades pay extremely well for the trader--but not for society. For instance, a member of Citicorp's executive committee (and former government official) collected $120 million of bonuses over the years of hidden risks before the blowup; regular taxpayers are financing him retrospectively. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\9\\ Taleb, N.N. (2004) ``Bleed or Blowup: What Does Empirical Psychology Tell Us About the Preference For Negative Skewness?,'' Journal of Behavioral Finance, 5. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- Blowup risks kept increasing over the past few years, while the appearance of stability has increased.\\10\\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\10\\ Even Chairman Bernanke was fooled by the apparent stability as he pronounced it the ``great moderation.'' --------------------------------------------------------------------------- 4. Var has severe side effects (anchoring) Many people favor the adjunct application of VaR on grounds that it is ``not harmful,'' using arguments like ``we are aware of its defects.'' VaR has side effects of increasing risk-taking, even by those who know that it is not reliable. We have ample evidence of so called ``anchoring'' \\11\\ in the calibration of decisions. Information, even when it is known to be sterile, increases overconfidence. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\11\\ Numerous experiments provide evidence that professionals are significantly influenced by numbers that they know to be irrelevant to their decision, like writing down the last four digits of one's social security number before making a numerical estimate of potential market moves. German judges rolling dice before sentencing showed an increase of 50 percent in the length of the sentence when the dice show a high number, without being conscious of it. See Birte Englich and Thomas Mussweiler, ``Sentencing under Uncertainty: Anchoring Effects in the Courtroom,'' Journal of Applied Social Psychology, Vol. 31, No. 7 (2001), pp. 1535-1551; Birte Englich, Thomas Mussweiler, and Fritz Strack, ``Playing Dice with Criminal Sentences: the Influence of Irrelevant Anchors on Experts' Judicial Decision Making,'' Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin, Vol. 32, No. 2 (Feb. 2006), pp. 188- 200. 5. VaR-style quantitative risk measurement is the engine behind --------------------------------------------------------------------------- leverage, the main cause of the current crisis Leverage\\12\\ is a direct result of underestimation of the risks of extreme events--and the illusion that these risks are measurable. Someone more careful (or realistic) would issue equity. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\12\\ There is a large difference between equity and credit bubbles. Equity bubbles are benign. We went through an equity bubble in 2000, without major problems. Some credit can be benign. Credit that facilitates trade and economic transactions and finances conservative house-ownership does not have the same risk properties as credit for speculative reasons resulting from overconfidence. April 28, 2004 was a very sad day, when the SEC, at the instigation of the investment banks, initiated the abandonment of hard (i.e., robust) risk measures like leverage, in favor of more model-based probabilistic, and fragile, ones. CONCLUSION: WHAT REGULATORY STRUCTURE DO WE NEED? Regulators should understand that financial markets are a complex system and work on increasing the robustness in it, by preventing ``too big to fail'' situations, favoring diversity in risk taking, allowing entities to absorb large shocks, and reducing the effect of model error (see ``Ten Points for a Black Swan Robust Society,'' in Appendix II). This implies reliance on ``hard,'' non-probabilistic measures rather than more error-prone ones. For instance ``leverage'' is a robust measures (like the temperature, it does not change with your model), while VaR is not. Furthermore, we need to examine the toxicity of models; financial regulators should have the same test as the Food and Drug Administration does. The promoter of the probability model must be able to show that no one will be harmed even if the event is rare. Alas, the history of medicine shows translational gaps, the lag between the discovery of harm and suspension of harmful practice, lasting up to 200 years in pre-modern medicine.\\13\\ Unfortunately, economics resemble pre-modern medicine.\\14\\ But we cannot afford to wait 200 years to find out that the medicine is far worse than the disease. We cannot afford to wait even months. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\13\\ ``When William Harvey demonstrated the mechanism of blood circulation in the 1620s, humoral theory and its related practices should have disappeared, because the anatomy and physiology on which it relied was incompatible with this picture of the organism. In fact, people continued to refer to spirits and humors, and doctors continued to prescribe phlebotomies, enemas, and cataplasms, for centuries more-- even when it was established in the mid-1800, most notably by Louis Pasteur, that germs were the cause of disease.'' Noga Arikha ``Just Life in a Nutshell: Humours as common sense,'' in The Philosophical Forum Quarterly, XXXIX, 3. \\14\\ Most of the use of probabilistic methods lacking both mathematical and empirical justification can be attributed to the prestige given to modern finance by the various Nobel memorial prizes in economics. See P. Triana, 2009, Lecturing Birds on Flying: Can Mathematical Theories Destroy the Markets?, J. Wiley. APPENDIX I: AUTHOR'S WARNINGS, 1996-2007 1996-1997 VaR is charlatanism because it tries to estimate something that is scientifically impossible to estimate, namely the risk of rare events. It gives people a misleading sense of precision. (Derivatives Strategy, citing from Dynamic Hedging) VaR encourages misdirected people to take risks with shareholders', and ultimately taxpayers' money. (Derivatives Strategy) 2003 Fannie Mae's models (for calibrating to the risks of rare events) are pseudoscience. (New York Times--Alex Berenson's article on FNMA) ``What happened to LTCM will look like a picnic compared to what should happen to you.'' (Lecture, Women in Hedge Funds Association, cited in Hedge World) 2007 Fannie Mae, when I look at its risks, seems to be sitting on a barrel of dynamite, vulnerable to the slightest hiccup. But not to worry: their large staff of scientists deems these events ``unlikely.'' (The Black Swan) Banks are now more vulnerable to the Black Swan than ever before with ``scientists'' among their staff taking care of exposures. The giant firm, J.P. Morgan, put the entire world at risk by introducing in the nineties RiskMetrics, a phony method aiming at managing people's risks. A related method called ``Value-at-Risk,'' which relies on the quantitative measurement of risk, has been spreading. (The Black Swan) APPENDIX II: TEN PRINCIPLES FOR A BLACK SWAN ROBUST WORLD (FINANCIAL TIMES, APRIL 8, 2009) 1. What is fragile should break early while it is still small. Nothing should ever become too big to fail. Evolution in economic life helps those with the maximum amount of hidden risks--and hence the most fragile--become the biggest. 2. No socialization of losses and privatization of gains. Whatever may need to be bailed out should be nationalized; whatever does not need a bail-out should be free, small and risk-bearing. We have managed to combine the worst of capitalism and socialism. In France in the 1980s, the socialists took over the banks. In the U.S. in the 2000s, the banks took over the government. This is surreal. 3. People who were driving a school bus blindfolded (and crashed it) should never be given a new bus. The economics establishment (universities, regulators, central bankers, government officials, various organizations staffed with economists) lost its legitimacy with the failure of the system. It is irresponsible and foolish to put our trust in the ability of such experts to get us out of this mess. Instead, find the smart people whose hands are clean. 4. Do not let someone making an ``incentive'' bonus manage a nuclear plant--or your financial risks. Odds are he would cut every corner on safety to show ``profits'' while claiming to be ``conservative.'' Bonuses do not accommodate the hidden risks of blow-ups. It is the asymmetry of the bonus system that got us here. No incentives without disincentives: capitalism is about rewards and punishments, not just rewards. 5. Counter-balance complexity with simplicity. Complexity from globalization and highly networked economic life needs to be countered by simplicity in financial products. The complex economy is already a form of leverage: the leverage of efficiency. Such systems survive thanks to slack and redundancy; adding debt produces wild and dangerous gyrations and leaves no room for error. Capitalism cannot avoid fads and bubbles: equity bubbles (as in 2000) have proved to be mild; debt bubbles are vicious. 6. Do not give children sticks of dynamite, even if they come with a warning. Complex derivatives need to be banned because nobody understands them and few are rational enough to know it. Citizens must be protected from themselves, from bankers selling them ``hedging'' products, and from gullible regulators who listen to economic theorists. 7. Only Ponzi schemes should depend on confidence. Governments should never need to ``restore confidence.'' Cascading rumors are a product of complex systems. Governments cannot stop the rumors. Simply, we need to be in a position to shrug off rumors, be robust in the face of them. 8. Do not give an addict more drugs if he has withdrawal pains. Using leverage to cure the problems of too much leverage is not homeopathy, it is denial. The debt crisis is not a temporary problem, it is a structural one. We need rehab. 9. Citizens should not depend on financial assets or fallible ``expert'' advice for their retirement. Economic life should be definancialized. We should learn not to use markets as storehouses of value: they do not harbor the certainties that normal citizens require. Citizens should experience anxiety about their own businesses (which they control), not their investments (which they do not control). 10. Make an omelet with the broken eggs. Finally, this crisis cannot be fixed with makeshift repairs, no more than a boat with a rotten hull can be fixed with ad hoc patches. We need to rebuild the hull with new (stronger) materials; we will have to remake the system before it does so itself. Let us move voluntarily into Capitalism 2.0 by helping what needs to be broken break on its own, converting debt into equity, marginalizing the economics and business school establishments, shutting down the ``Nobel'' in economics, banning leveraged buy-outs, putting bankers where they belong, clawing back the bonuses of those who got us here, and teaching people to navigate a world with fewer certainties. Then we will see an economic life closer to our biological environment: smaller companies, richer ecology, no leverage. A world in which entrepreneurs, not bankers, take the risks, and companies are born and die every day without making the news. In other words, a place more resistant to black swans.

Chairman Miller. Thank you, Dr. Taleb. Dr. Bookstaber for five minutes. STATEMENT OF DR. RICHARD BOOKSTABER, FINANCIAL AUTHOR Dr. Bookstaber. Mr. Chairman and Members of the Committee, I thank you for the opportunity to testify today. My oral testimony will begin with a discussion of the limitations of VaR. I will then discuss the role of VaR in the recent market meltdown and conclude with suggestions for filling the gap left by the limitations of VaR. The limitations of VaR are readily apparent by looking at the critical assumptions behind it. For the standard construction of VaR, these assumptions are, first, that all portfolio positions are included; secondly, that the sample history used in VaR is a reasonable representation of things that are likely to occur going forward; and third, that the normal distribution function that it uses is a reasonable representation of the statistical distribution underlying the returns. These assumptions are often violated, leading VaR estimates to be misleading. So let me discuss each of these in turn. First of all, in terms of incomplete positions, obviously, for risk to be measured, all the risky positions must be included in the analysis, but for larger institutions, it is commonplace for some positions to be excluded. This can happen because the positions are held off a balance sheet beyond the purview of those doing the risk analysis, because they are in complex instruments that have not been sufficiently modeled, or because they are in new so-called innovative products that have yet to be added into the risk process. This provides a compelling reason to have what I call `flight to simplicity' in financial products, to move away from complex and customized innovative products and towards standardization. In terms of unrepresentative sample periods, VaR gives a measure of risk that assumes tomorrow is drawn from the same distribution as the sample data used to compute the VaR. If the future does not look like the past--in particular, if a crisis emerges, VaR will no longer be a good measure of risk, which is to say that VaR is a good measure of risk except when it really matters. Third, in terms of fat tails and normal distribution, largely because of crisis events, security returns tend to have fatter tails than what is represented by a normal distribution. That is, there tend to be more outliers and extreme events than a normal distribution would imply. Now, one way to address this well-known inaccuracy is to modify the distribution allowing for fatter tails, but this adds complication to VaR analysis while contributing little insight in terms of risk. A better approach is to accept the limitations of VaR, and then try to understand the market crises where VaR fails. If we understand the dynamics of market crises, we may be able to improve risk management to make it work when it is of the greatest importance. A starting point for understanding financial market crises is leverage and the crowding of trades. These lead to the common crisis dynamic--what I call a liquidity crisis cycle. Such a cycle begins when there is some exogenous shock that causes a drop in a market that is crowded with leveraged investors. The highly leveraged investors are forced to sell to meet their margin requirements. Their selling drops prices further, which in turn forces yet more selling, resulting in a cascading cycle downward in prices. Now, the investors that are under pressure discover there is no longer any liquidity in the stressed market, so they start to liquidate their positions in other markets to generate the required margin. And if many investors that are in the first market also have high exposure in a second one, the downward spiral propagates to this second market. This phenomenon explains why a crisis can spread in surprising and unpredictable ways. The contagion is primarily driven by what other securities are owned by the funds that need to sell. For example, a simple example of this is what happened with the silver bubble back in 1980. The silver market became closely linked with the market for cattle. Why? Because the Hunt family had margin calls on their silver position, and so they sold whatever else they could, and what else they had to sell happened to be cattle. So thus there was a contagion based not on any economic linkage but based on who was under pressure and what else they owned. Now, this cycle evolves unrelated to historical relationships, out of the reach of VaR-type models. But that doesn't mean it is beyond analysis. But if we want to analyze it, we need to know the leverage and the positions of the major market participants. Gathering these critical data is the first step in measuring and managing crisis risk, and should be the role of a market regulator. Now, let me talk specifically about the role of VaR in the current crisis. Whatever the limitations of VaR models, they were not the key culprits in the case of the multi-billion dollar write-downs central to the current crisis. The large bank inventories were there to be seen. You didn't need to have any models or sophisticated detective or forensic work to see them. Furthermore, it was clear that these inventories were illiquid and that their market values were uncertain. It is hard to understand how this elephant in the room was missed, how a risk manager could see inventory grow from a few billion dollars to 10 billion dollars and then to 30 or 40 billion dollars, and not take action to bring that inventory down. One has to look beyond VaR to sheer stupidity or collective management failure. The risk managers missed the growing inventory, or did not have the courage of their conviction to insist on its being reduced, or the senior management was not willing to heed their demands. Whatever the reason, VaR was not central to the crisis. Focus would be better placed on failures in risk governance than failures of risk models, whatever the flaws of VaR are. Now, in summary, let me first emphasize, I believe that VaR does have value. If one were forced to pick a single number for the risk of a portfolio in the near future, VaR would be a good choice for the job. VaR illuminates most of the risk landscape, but, unfortunately, the places its light fails to reach are the canyons, crevices and cliffs. So we can do two things to try to improve on and address the limitations of VaR. One is to employ coarser measures of risk, measures that have fewer assumptions and that are less dependent on the future looking like the past. The use of the leverage ratio mandated by U.S. regulators is an example of such a measure. The leverage ratio does not overlay assumptions about the correlation or the volatility of the assets, and does not assume any mitigating effects from diversification. It does, however, have its own limitations as a basis for capital adequacy. The second is to add other risk methods that are better at illuminating the areas VaR does not reach. So in addition to measuring risk using a standard VaR approach, develop scenarios for crises and test capital adequacy under those scenarios. Critical, of course, to the success of this approach is the ability to ferret out potential crises and describe them adequately for risk purposes. We can go a long way toward this goal by having regulators amass and aggregate data on the positions and leverage of large financial institutions. These data are critical because we cannot manage what we cannot measure, and we cannot measure what we cannot see. With these data, we will be better able to measure the crowding and leverage that leads to crisis, and shed light on risks that fail to be illuminated by VaR. Let me close my oral comments by responding to comments by both the Chairman and the Ranking Member. The analogy of VaR and the models related to risk to models used in other engineering and physical systems--I think there is a critical distinction between financial systems and other engineering systems, because financial systems are open to gaming. If I discover a valve that is poorly designed in a nuclear power plant and design a new valve to replace it, and install that valve, the valve doesn't sit there and try to figure out if it can fool me into thinking it is on when it is really off. But in the financial markets, that is what happens. So any engineering solution or any analogy to physical processes is going to be flawed when they are applied to the financial markets, because those in the financial markets can game against the system to try to find ways around any regulation, and to find other ways to do what they want to do. And I believe that one of the key tools for this type of gaming are sophisticated, innovative, complex products that can often obfuscate what people are doing. So, I think, parenthetical to the issues of VaR and other models is, number one, the recognition that no model can work completely in the financial markets the way they can in other physical systems, and number two, that if we want to curb or diminish the issues of gaming, we have to have more simplicity and transparency in the financial instruments. Thank you. I look forward to your questions. [The prepared statement of Dr. Bookstaber follows:] Prepared Statement of Richard Bookstaber Mr. Chairman and Members of the Committee, I thank you for the opportunity to testify today. My name is Richard Bookstaber. Over the past decade I have worked as the risk manager in two of the world's largest hedge funds, Moore Capital Management and, most recently, Bridgewater Associates. In the 1990s I oversaw firm-wide risk at Salomon Brothers, which at the time was the largest risk-taking firm in the world, and before that was in charge of market risk at Morgan Stanley. I am the author of A Demon of Our Own Design--Markets, Hedge Funds, and the Perils of Financial Innovation. Published in April, 2007, this book warned of the potential for financial crisis resulting from the growth of leverage and the proliferation of derivatives and other innovative products. Although I have extensive experience on both the buy-side and sell- side, I left my position at Bridgewater Associates at the end of 2008, and come before the Committee in an unaffiliated capacity, representing no industry interests. My testimony will discuss what VaR is, how it can be used and more importantly, how it can be misused. I will focus on the limitations of VaR in measuring crisis risk. I will then discuss the role of VaR in the recent market meltdown, concluding with suggestions for ways to fill the gaps left by the limitations of VaR. What is VaR? VaR, or Value-at-Risk, measures the risk of a portfolio of assets by estimating the probability that a given loss might occur. For example, the dollar VaR for a particular portfolio might be expressed as ``there is a ten percent probability that this portfolio will lose more than $VaR over the next day.'' Here is a simplified version of the steps in constructing a VaR estimate for the potential loss at the ten percent level: 1. Identify all of the positions held by the portfolio. 2. Get the daily returns for each of these positions for the past 250 trading days (about a one-year period). 3. Use those returns to construct the return to the overall portfolio for each day over the last 250 trading days. 4. Order the returns for those days from the highest to the lowest, and pick the return for the day that is the 25th worst day's return. That will be a raw estimate of the daily VaR at the ten percent level. 5. Smooth the results by fitting this set of returns to the Normal distribution function.\\1\\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\1\\ The risk for a Normal distribution is fully defined by the standard deviation, and the results from Step 3 can be used to estimate the standard deviation of the sample. If the estimated standard deviation is, say, five percent, then the VaR at the ten percent level will be a loss of eight percent. For a Normal distribution the ten percent level is approximately 1.6 standard deviations. Limitations of VaR The critical assumptions behind the construction of VaR are made clear by the process described above: 1. All of the portfolio positions are included. 2. The sample history is a reasonable representation of what things will look like going forward. 3. The Normal distribution function is a reasonable representation of the statistical distribution underlying the returns. The limitations to VaR boil down to issues with these three assumptions, assumptions that are often violated, leading VaR estimates to be misleading. Incomplete positions Obviously, risk cannot be fully represented if not all of the risky positions are included in the analysis. But for larger institutions, it is commonplace for this to occur. Positions might be excluded because they are held off-balance sheet, beyond the purview of those doing the risk analysis; they might be in complex instruments that have not been sufficiently modeled or that are difficult to include in the position database; or they might be in new products that have not yet been included in the risk process. In the recent crisis, some banks failed to include positions in collateralized debt obligations (CDOs) for all three of these reasons.\\2\\ And that exclusion was not considered an immediate concern because they were believed to be low risk, having attained a AAA rating. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\2\\ Regulatory capital on the trading assets that a bank does not include in VaR--or for which the bank's VaR model does not pass regulatory scrutiny--is computed using a risk-rating based approach. However, the rating process itself suffers from many of the difficulties associated with calculating VaR, as illustrated by the AAA ratings assigned to many mortgage-backed CDOs and the consequent severe underestimation of the capital required to support those assets. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- The inability to include all of the positions in the VaR risk analysis, the most rudimentary step for VaR to be useful, is pervasive among the larger institutions in the industry. This provides a compelling reason to have a `flight to simplicity' in financial products, to move away from complex and customized innovative products and toward standardization.\\3\\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\3\\ I discuss the complexity and related risk issues surrounding derivatives and related innovative products in Testimony of Richard Bookstaber, Submitted to the Senate of the United States, Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry for the Hearing: ``Regulatory Reform and the Derivatives Markets,'' June 4, 2009. Unrepresentative sample period VaR gives a measure of risk that assumes tomorrow is drawn from the same distribution as the sample data used to compute the VaR. If the future does not look like the past, in particular if a crisis emerges, then VaR will no longer be a good measure of risk.\\4\\ Which is to say that VaR is a good measure of risk except when it really matters.\\5\\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\4\\ One way to try to overcome the problem of relying on the past is to use a very long time period in the VaR calculation, with the idea that a longer period will include many different regimes, crises and relationships. Such a view misses the way different regimes, essentially different distributions, mix to lead to a final result. A long time period gives muddied results. To see this, imagine the case where in half of the past two assets were strongly positively correlated and the other half they were strongly negatively correlated. The mixing of the two would suggest the average of little correlation, thus giving a risk posture that did not exist in either period, but that also incorrectly suggests diversification opportunities. \\5\\ As a corollary to this, one could also say that diversification works except when it really matters. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- It is well known that VaR cannot measure crisis risk. During periods of crisis the relationship between securities changes in strange and seemingly unpredictable ways. VaR, which depends critically on a set structure for volatility and correlation, cannot provide useful information in this situation. It contains no mechanism for predicting the type of crisis that might occur, and does not consider the dynamics of market crises. This is not to say that VaR has no value or is hopelessly flawed. Most of the time it will provide a reasonable measure of risk--indeed the vast majority of the time this will be the case. If one were forced to pick a single number for the risk of a portfolio in the near future, VaR would be a good choice for the job. VaR illuminates most of the risk landscape. But unfortunately, the places its light fails to reach are the canyons, crevices and cliffs. Fat Tails and the Normal Distribution Largely because of crisis events, security returns tend to have fatter tails than what is represented by a Normal distribution. That is, there tend to be more outliers and extreme events than what a Normal distribution would predict. This leads to justifiable criticism of VaR for its use of the Normal distribution. However, sometimes this criticism is overzealous, suggesting that the professionals who assume a Normal distribution in their analysis are poorly trained or worse. Such criticism is unwarranted; the limitations of the Normal distribution are well-known. I do not know of anyone working in financial risk management, or indeed in quantitative finance generally, who does not recognize that security returns may have fat tails. It is even discussed in many investment textbooks, so it is a point that is hard to miss.\\6\\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\6\\ For example, Investments, by Bodie, Kane, and Marcus, 8th edition (McGraw-Hill/Irwin), has a section (page 148) entitled ``Measurement of Risk with Non-normal Distributions.'' --------------------------------------------------------------------------- The issue is how this well-known inaccuracy of the Normal distribution is addressed. One way is knowingly to misuse VaR, to ignore the problem and act as if VaR can do what it cannot. Another is to modify the distribution to allow for fatter tails.\\7\\ This adds complication and obfuscation to the VaR analysis, because any approach employing a fat-tailed distribution increases the number of parameters to estimate, and this increases the chance that the distribution will be mis-specified. And in any case, simply fattening up the tails of the distribution provides little insight for risk management. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\7\\ Extreme value theory is the bastion for techniques that employ distributions with a higher probability of extreme events. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- I remember a cartoon that showed a man sitting behind a desk with a name plate that read `Risk Manager.' The man sitting in front of the desk said, ``Be careful? That's all you can tell me, is to be careful?'' Stopping with the observation that extreme events can occur in the markets and redrawing the distribution accordingly is about as useful as saying ``be careful.'' A better approach is to accept the limitations of VaR, and then try to understand the nature of the extreme events, the market crises where VaR fails. If we understand the dynamics of market crisis, we may be able to improve risk management to make it work when it is of the greatest importance. Understanding the Dynamics of Market Crises A starting point for understanding financial market crises is leverage and the crowding of trades, both of which have effects that lead to a common crisis dynamic, the liquidity crisis cycle. Such a cycle begins when an exogenous shock causes a drop in a market that is crowded with leveraged investors. The highly leveraged investors are forced to sell to meet their margin requirements. Their selling drops prices further, which in turn forces yet more selling, resulting in a cascading cycle downward in prices. Those investors that are under pressure discover there is no longer liquidity in the stressed market, so they start to liquidate their positions in other markets to generate the required margin. If many of the investors that are in the first market also have high exposure in a second one, the downward spiral propagates to this second market.\\8\\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\8\\ The use of VaR-based capital can actually contribute to this sort of cycle. VaR will increase because of the higher volatility--and also possibly because of the higher correlations--leading potential liquidity providers and lenders to pull back. This was a likely exacerbating effect during the 1997 Asian crisis. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- This phenomenon explains why a crisis can spread in surprising and unpredictable ways. The contagion is driven primarily by what other securities are owned by the funds that need to sell.\\9\\ For example, when the silver bubble burst in 1980, the silver market became closely linked to the market for cattle. Why? Because when the Hunt family had to meet margin calls on their silver positions, they sold whatever else they could. And they happened also to be invested in cattle. Thus there is contagion based not on economic linkages, but based on who is under pressure and what else they are holding. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\9\\ As an illustration, the proximate cause of Long Term Capital Management's (LTCM's) demise was the Russian default in August, 1998. But LTCM was not highly exposed to Russia. A reasonable risk manager, aware of the Russian risks, might not have viewed it as critical to LTCM. But the Russian default hurt LTCM because many of those who did have high leverage in Russia also had positions in other markets where LTCM was leveraged. When the Russian debt markets failed and these investors had to come up with capital, they sold their more liquid positions in, among other things, Danish mortgage bonds. So the Danish mortgage bond market and these other markets went into a tail spin, and because LTCM was heavily exposed in these markets, the contagion took LTCM with it. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- This cycle evolves unrelated to historical relationships, out of the reach of VaR-type models. But that does not mean it is beyond analysis. Granted it is not easy to trace the risk of these potential liquidity crisis cycles. To do so with accuracy, we need to know the leverage and positions of the major market participants. No one firm, knowing only its own positions, can have an accurate assessment of the crisis risk. Indeed, each firm might be managing its risk prudently given the information it has at its disposal, and not only miss the risk that comes from crowding and leverage, but also unwittingly contribute to this risk. Gathering these critical data is the first step in measuring and managing crisis risk. This should be the role of a market regulator.\\10\\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\10\\ I discuss the need for firm-level position and leverage data in crisis risk management in previous testimony before both the House and the Senate. For example, Testimony of Richard Bookstaber, Submitted to the Congress of the United States, House Financial Services Committee, for the Hearing: ``Systemic Risk: Examining Regulators Ability to Respond to Threats to the Financial System,'' October 2, 2007, and Testimony of Richard Bookstaber, Submitted to the Senate of the United States, Senate Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs Subcommittee on Securities, Insurance and Investment, for the Hearing: ``Risk Management and Its Implications for Systematic Risk,'' June 19, 2008. The Role of VaR in the Current Crisis The above discussion provides part of the answer to the question of the role of VaR in the current market crisis: If VaR was used as the source of risk measurement, and thus as the determinant of risk capital, then it missed the potential for the current crisis for the simple reason that VaR is not constructed to deal with crisis risk. And if VaR was applied as if it actually reflected the potential for crisis, that is, if it was forgotten that VaR is only useful insofar as the future is drawn from the same distribution as the past, then this led to the mis-measurement of risk. So if VaR was the sole means of determining risk levels and risk capital coming into this crisis, it was misused. But this does not present the full story. Whatever the limitations of VaR models, they were not the key culprits in the case of the multi-billion dollar write-downs during the crisis. The large bank inventories were there to be seen; no models or detective work were needed. Furthermore, it was clear the inventories were illiquid and their market values uncertain.\\11\\ It is hard to understand how this elephant in the room was missed, how a risk manager could see inventory grow from a few billion dollars to ten billion dollars and then to thirty or forty billion dollars and not react by forcing that inventory to be brought down. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\11\\ This is especially true when one considers the business of the banks, which is to package the securities and sell them. The growth of inventory was outside the normal business of the banks. That the securities were not moving out the door should have been an immediate indication they were not correctly priced. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- Of course, if these inventories were not properly included in the VaR analysis, the risk embodied by these positions would have been missed, but one has to look beyond VaR, to culprits such as sheer stupidity or collective management failure: The risk managers missed the growing inventory, or did not have the courage of their conviction to insist on its reduction, or the senior management was not willing to heed their demands. Whichever the reason, VaR was not central to this crisis.\\12\\ Focus would be better placed on failures in risk governance than failures of risk models. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\12\\ Indeed, in some important cases, VaR was not even employed in the risk process. A case in point is the `super senior' mortgage CDO positions which caused huge trading losses at a number of banks. There is a common misconception that regulatory capital for trading assets is automatically computed using VaR. In fact, trading assets are eligible for VaR-based capital only if the bank can demonstrate to its supervisor that its model is robust. Absent this, a coarser method is applied. Many of the highly complex securities at the heart of the recent crisis were not regarded as being suitable for VaR treatment, and received a simpler ratings-based treatment, which proved to severely underestimate the capital required to support the assets. Summary: VaR and Crisis Risk There are two approaches for moving away from over-reliance on VaR. The first approach is to employ coarser measures of risk, measures that have fewer assumptions and that are less dependent on the future looking like the past.\\13\\ The use of the Leverage Ratio mandated by U.S. regulators and championed by the FDIC is an example of such a measure.\\14\\ The leverage ratio does not overlay assumptions about the correlation or the volatility of the assets, and does not assume any mitigating effect from diversification, although it has its own limitations as a basis for capital adequacy.\\15\\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\13\\ I believe coarse measures--measures that are not fine tuned to be ideal in any one environment, but are robust across many environments--are a key to good risk management. \\14\\ The Leverage Ratio is the ratio of Tier 1 capital, principally equity and retained earnings, to total assets. \\15\\ The Leverage Ratio is inconsistent with Basel II because it is not sensitive to the riskiness of balance sheet assets and it does not capture off-balance sheet risks. By not taking the relative risk of assets into account, it could lead to incentives for banks to hold riskier assets, while on a relative basis penalizing those banks that elect to hold a low-risk balance sheet. In terms of risk to a financial institution, the time horizon of leverage is also important, which the Leverage Ratio also misses. The problems with Bear Stearns and Lehman was not only one of leverage per se, but of funding a sizable portion of leverage in the short-term repo market. They thus were vulnerable to funding drying up in the face of a crisis. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- The second approach is to recognize that while VaR provides a guide to risk in some situations, it must be enhanced with other measures that are better at illuminating the areas it does not reach. For example, Pillar II of Basel II has moved to include stress cases for crises and defaults into its risk capital process. So in addition to measuring risk using a standard VaR approach, firms must develop scenarios for crises and test their capital adequacy under those scenarios. Critical to the success of this approach is the ability to ferret out potential crises and describe them adequately for risk purposes. This means that for crisis-related stress testing to be feasible, we first must believe that it is indeed possible to model financial crisis scenarios, i.e., that crises are not `black swans.' This is not to say that surprises do not occur. Though recently popularized, the recognition that we are beset by unanticipatable risk, by events that seemingly come out of nowhere and catch us unawares, has a long history in economics and finance, dating back to Frank Knight in the 1920s.\\16\\ The best defense against such risks is to maintain a coarse, simple and robust financial structure. Rather than fine-tuning for the current environments, we need risk measures and financial instruments which, while perhaps not optimal for the world of today, will be able to operate reasonably if the world changes in unexpected ways. VaR as currently structured is not such a risk measure. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\16\\ Knight makes the distinction between risks we can identify and measure and those that are unanticipatable and therefore not measurable in Risk, Uncertainty, and Profit. (1921), Boston, MA: Houghton Mifflin Company. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- However, although surprises do occur, crisis scenarios are not wholly unanticipatable; they are not in the realm of Knightian uncertainty. We have had ample experience with financial crises. We know a thing or two about them.\\17\\ And we can further anticipate crisis risk by amassing data on the positions and leverage of the large investment firms. The regulator is best suited to take on this task, because these are data that no one firm can or should fully see.\\18\\ With these critical data we will be better able to measure the crowding and leverage that lead to liquidity crisis cycles and begin to shed light on the areas of financial risk that fail to be illuminated by VaR.\\19\\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\17\\ For example, even beyond the insights to be gained from a detailed knowledge of firm-by-firm leverage and market crowding, there are some characteristics of market crisis that can be placed into a general scenario. When a crisis occurs, equity prices drop, credit spreads rise, and the volatility of asset returns increases. The yield curve flattens and gold prices rise. Furthermore, the correlation between individual equities rises, as does the correlation between equities and corporate bonds. The riskier and less liquid assets fare more poorly, so, for example, emerging markets take a differentially bigger hit than their G-7 cousins. More broadly, anything that is risky or less liquid becomes more common and negative in its return; the subtleties of pricing between assets becomes overshadowed by the assets' riskiness. However, short-term interest rates and commodity prices are less predictable; in some cases, such as in the case of the inflation-laden crisis of 1973-1974, they rise, while in other cases, such as in the current crisis, they drop. Each of these effects can occur with a ferocity far beyond what is seen in normal times, so if these crisis events are overlaid on the distribution coming out of the VaR model based on those normal times one will come away saying the crisis is a 100-year flood event, a twenty standard deviation event, a black swan. But it is none of these things. It is a financial crisis, and such crises occur frequently enough that to be understood without such shock and awe. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\18\\ Financial firms will be justifiably reticent to have their position and leverage information made public, so the collection and analysis of the data will have to reside securely in the regulator. \\19\\ With these data, the regulator is also in a position to run risk analysis independent of the firms. Under Basel II, the regulator still depends on the internal processes of the banks for the measurement of risk and the resulting capital requirements. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- Appendix Related Blog Posts on VaR and Risk Management The Fat-Tailed Straw Man See http://rick.bookstaber.com/2009/03/fat-tailed-straw-man.html My Time article about the quant meltdown of August, 2007 started with ``Looks like Wall Street's mad scientists have blown up the lab again.'' Articles on Wall Street's mad scientist blowing up the lab seem to come out every month in one major publication or another. The New York Times has a story along these lines today and had a similar story in January. There is a constant theme in these articles, invariably including a quote from Nassim Taleb, that quants generally, and quantitative risk managers specifically, missed the boat by thinking, despite all evidence to the contrary, that security returns can be modeled by a Normal distribution. This is a straw man argument. It is an attack on something that no one believes. Is there anyone well trained in quantitative methods working on Wall Street who does not know that security returns have fat tails? It is discussed in most every investment text book. Fat tails are apparent--even if we ignore periods of crisis--in daily return series. And historically, every year there is some market or other that has suffered a ten standard deviation move of the ``where did that come from'' variety. I am firmly in the camp of those who understand there are unanticipatable risks; as far back as an article I co-authored in 1985, I have argued for the need to recognize that we face uncertainty from the unforeseeable. To get an idea of how far back the appreciation of this sort of risk goes in economic thought, consider the fact that it is sometimes referred to a"
