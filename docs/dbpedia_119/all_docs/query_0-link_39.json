        "meta_description": "This paper outlines a synthesis of ecological economics with econophysics and other complexity approaches to economics. Arguably, the resulting “ecological econophysics” will be scientifically sounder than mainstream economics and much better suited to addressing a major challenge of our times: the development of democratically-based policies to reduce economic throughput to an environmentally sustainable level without triggering economic crises and without excluding part of the world’s population, i.e., to implement degrowth. Degrowth will need major structural changes, which leads us to question whether there are limits to the malleability of the economic system’s architecture. A fundamental limit will be encountered if, as suggested by the physics of complexity, long-lasting complex systems always occur midway between an ordered and a disordered state. There is much evidence that this hypothesis holds and that the current economic system satisfies this condition. However, this does not mean that the problems posed by this system should be unavoidable. Ecological econophysics gives clues to identifying alternative economic systems that would also function between order and chaos, but which would have radically different implications for environmental sustainability and social justice.",

        "text": "4.2. BOC Systems beyond the Limits to Growth\n\nKnowing whether the throughput of an economy has reached an unsustainable level is not enough to know how the system will react. For example, the peak oil literature offers, intertwined, several different images of the future oil history The typical illustration of peak oil portrays a stylized curve of oil extraction that gradually climbs, reaches a maximum and then declines smoothly, the increase and the decrease being symmetric [138]. A similar image would be obtained from a general equilibrium model with limits to growth, as will be shown in a forthcoming paper. However, this image is often accompanied by discussions on the possibility of collapse at some point of the curve, in the tradition of Meadows et al.'s Limits to Growth [139]. Some authors also think that the current economic recession could be a symptom of peak oil [140], and other recessions with the same cause could come in the future. This leaves us at least with three possible scenarios: smooth decline, collapse and succession of crises.\n\nLet us use the wildland fire model in Section 2.5 to explore the plausibility of these patterns of response in a BOC context. In this model, the flammability of each pixel is a function of the amount of fuel. However, in the real world, weather and climate also affect flammability. Reference [72] introduced these factors in a simple way. The flammability pi of pixel i was considered to be the sum of an internal component (fuel, resulting from the system's dynamics, as described in Section 2.5) and an environmental component. The environmental component was assumed equal for all pixels. It could fluctuate either more quickly than fuel accrues, simulating weather, or more slowly, simulating long-term climate.\n\nIn Section 2.5, we considered two cases: either the flammability of individual pixels never reaches the critical threshold and the whole system remains subcritical, or they do and the system develops self-organized criticality (SOC), which is a state BOC. When adding weather, the response is different in each case [72]. In the first, there is almost no response unless the system approaches the critical threshold. If the threshold is crossed, the system becomes supercritical, and there is the risk of a giant fire spanning the whole system, which corresponds to a collapse scenario. In the state BOC, the response is more gradual. In this case, as mentioned in Section 2.5, the system displays fire events of all sizes, following a power law distribution (Equation (1)). If the weather becomes more fire-prone, the mean fire size increases, but it still follows a power law: the exponent β decreases, thus increasing the proportion of larger fires, and the maximum fire size, xmax, increases. A large and quick change carrying our model system beyond criticality would still produce collapse, but if the environmental change is gradual, the increased fire activity removes and rearranges fuel, thus keeping the system below the critical threshold [72]. This is a way in which the system processes information and prevents collapse.\n\nThe predicted pattern of response of the power law parameters to weather has been clearly observed in the empirical data of boreal forest fires [72]. It has been observed that tropical cyclones also display a power law distribution and that increases in sea surface temperature cause the upper bound, xmax, to increase, while a possible response of β was not clear in this case [48]. These results are interesting for future economies in two ways. First, when referring to their own contexts in which they were obtained, they give us a more precise portray of what is meant by increasing the frequency of extreme events caused by climate change. More important in our context, they give clues of the own response of the economic system to environmental pressures.\n\nAccording to Section 3.2.2., it is far from evident that the economic system is an instance of SOC. However, in the wildland fire model, the power law fire size distribution and its response to environmental pressures is a reflection of the scale-invariant spatial arrangement of fuel, whether or not this has originated because of SOC. Whatever the reason, the economic system does display scale invariance (Section 3). Its scale-invariant granularity has a strong incidence on macroeconomic fluctuations, as shown in [123]. Its modularity (i.e., the tendency for interacting “grains” to be grouped in clusters) also seems to play a major role [112]. Therefore, it is plausible that economies respond to environmental pressures by increasing the intensity of recessions in a way similar to the model. If this is the case, there will be recessions of many different sizes with or without environmental pressure, but an increasing pressure will translate to an increasing proportion of large recessions and an increasing size of the largest possible recession. This scenario of economic decline reminds a mathematical figure known as the “Devil's staircase”: a staircase with steps of all sizes, displaying scale invariance [43] (in the economy, however, we do not only expect clear-cut “steps” down, but a mixture of these with descending “ramps” and partial recoveries).\n\nThere is indirect evidence of this type of response in precapitalist societies. When studying several centuries of European history, a statistical association was found between climate adverse to agriculture and increasing fatalities due to wars, in addition to famine and epidemics [141]. A power law distribution of the number of casualties has been observed in contemporary wars [117]. The simplest hypothesis combining both observations is that war size follows a power law whose parameters change as a function of environmental pressure, similarly to forest fires (it should be clear that this does not deny the added impact of purely social factors on these parameters or even the possible existence of societies whose repertoire of responses does not include warfare; such societies simply do not contribute to the data on war casualties analyzed in [117,141]).\n\nLooking into the future, the transmission of the impact of oil scarcity from one economic sector to another has been recently modeled by Kerschner et al. [142], and there is some econometric information available on the consequences of past oil shortages for different sectors [143]. A more detailed impact map, e.g., considering individual firms, is not feasible, but its statistical properties can be investigated and, probably, will be as described above.\n\nIt is noteworthy that the 2008 financial and economic crisis broke out when the oil price was hitting a historical maximum. There has been some discussion about a possible causal link [12,140,144], but this possibility is not considered by most economists, who focus their attention on other factors. There can be little doubt of the key role of factors such as the real estate bubble, subprime mortgages, the fragile network of asset-backed securities, the huge leverage of the shadow banking system and the inability of countries to perform monetary policies within the Euro area [145]. However, what happens in models BOC, such as the wildland fire model, is that, under environmental pressure, the first parts of the system to fall are those that were already fragile. Because of environmental pressure, these parts become more likely to fall and carry with them a larger fraction of the system. Whether or not oil supply limitations actually played this role in 2008 can only be found out from more research. Meanwhile, we cannot tell for sure whether the current crisis is already one step down in the Devil's staircase beyond the limits to growth.\n\nThere is another phenomenon, unrelated to the processes operating in the SOC fire model, that also contributes to enhanced economic fluctuations under resource scarcity. Peak oil theory assumes that, as scarcity increases, oil supply relies increasingly on resources whose extraction is costly for geological reasons [138,146,147]. It can be added that it also relies increasingly on areas that are unreliable geopolitically (from the point of view of consumer countries and transnational corporations). The oil crises of the 1970s and the 1980s took place after the U.S. had passed through peak oil and the west had become dependent on OPEC countries. In 2011, the IEA [148] estimated that, just to replace depleting fields and keep current oil consumption levels up to 2035, an additional capacity equivalent to twice the current OPEC Middle East rate of extraction would be needed (and more capacity if consumption is to grow). This agency hoped that this oil would be extracted from a set of sources that are uncertain for several reasons, with the largest share attributed to a country that has been suffering as much instability as Iraq. (Here, the IEA uses the term “oil” aggregating crude oil, unconventional oil, condensates and natural gas liquids, such as butane [148]. Regarding conventional crude oil, this institution recognized in 2010 that its rate of extraction probably peaked in 2006 [149]. The projections in the 2013 report differ from previous reports in that it gives much weight to the U.S.'s shale oil, but other sources disagree strongly about the prospects for this resource [150], which means that the uncertainty in energy supply remains).\n\nThe approach outlined in this paper differs in several ways from other approaches to the behavior of the economic system beyond the limits to growth. Like Meadows et al. [139] and other models inspired in this pioneering work [151], we overcome the instantaneous relaxation times and the absolute predictability of general equilibrium models, hence allowing for nonlinear behaviors, such as recessions and collapse. However, Meadows et al.'s shared with general equilibrium models their focus on macroeconomic variables (both are “mean field” approaches, in physical terms). Therefore, they did not include granularity and modularity, which set the basis for the notion of a sequence of recessions. Without these features, they had one single large “grain” that had to fall at once, in the form of collapse.\n\nHowever, the developments in this work do not allow us to discard the possibility of general collapse, for two reasons. First, that “mean field” variables can have importance in themselves (not just as a result of the aggregate of microscopic transmission events). Second, even agent-to-agent transmission can lead to collapse if, for some reason, the system crosses the barrier of criticality, thus becoming supercritical. There are at least two ways in which the last scenario could take place. One is an abrupt environmental change, causing the system to cross at once the distance that separates its current state from the critical point, with no time for any negative feedback to act and carry the system away from this point before crossing it. Since this negative feedback is exercised by the economic crises themselves or whatever catastrophic event, there is also a second possibility: that nothing has triggered some given type of catastrophic event during the time in which the system was becoming increasingly vulnerable. The author warned in 2003 that, due to the quick process of globalization, “there is a fast generation of long-range connections of all kinds, and we cannot rule out that these make the system become ‘supercritical’ ” and added that this and other concerns “made it irresponsible a fast process of globalization not preceded by a serious analysis of the consequences” ([31], p. 351). Now, there is evidence that the stability of the world economy was compromised by the quick increase in international connections among banks up to 2008 [112]. The financial crisis might have caused a collapse of the global economy if governments had not intervened. Had the crisis taken place later, it could have resulted in collapse even with governments intervening. Similarly to fires removing fuel, the amount of connections dropped sharply with the crisis [112,119]. Subsequently, however, governments have gone ahead with new agreements to force a quick globalization.\n\nThere is the possibility that we are in a supercritical state precisely because of the uncertainty, lack of awareness and incapacity of reaction to the environmental limits to growth. During a real estate bubble, many people are in fact aware that the capacity for the market to absorb houses is not infinite; but the limits are uncertain, and most agents do not consider them in their everyday activity. However, once the chain of defaults and bankruptcies begins to propagate, the change of mood propagates even more quickly and contributes to the drastic downturn. The point in time when an event like this happens is named the Minsky moment [145]. Something similar could happen when environmental constraints begin to impinge visibly and definitively on economic growth. While the direct protagonists of the real estate Minsky moment were restricted to a few economic sectors and a few countries, the “ecological economic Minsky moment” could embrace virtually all sectors of the formal economy and all countries.\n\nIn Section 3.3, I hypothesized that the Soviet Union had to collapse sooner or later, because it would have been supercritical. The time series analyses in [152] suggest that this event was triggered by peak oil, which took place in this country a little before the economic collapse. This possibility merits more scrutiny.\n\nIn fact, we are supercritical in one aspect that is not strictly economic, but is closely related, and supercriticality could well be underway in others. We are supercritical in that the nuclear arsenal can amplify a local fluctuation and send a wave of destruction to the whole planet. Our hope is that this local fluctuation will not happen. Another process that might lead us to supercriticality is the steeply declining agricultural biodiversity, which introduces the possibility of one single pest or disease decimating a major fraction of the world's agricultural production at once [153]. Similarly, the advanced ways to fight against infectious diseases have eased the development of dense urban conglomerates, industrial farms and quick transport all over the world, which represents an excellent culture medium for any infectious agent able to overcome the current protections [154].\n\nA topical issue of relevance in this context is the convenience or not of geoengineering as a replacement for the phasing out of greenhouse gas emissions. One of the most often discussed geoengineering techniques is the injection of aerosol precursors to the stratosphere, to interfere with incoming radiation and compensate for the warming effect of greenhouse gases. In addition to other problems (due to the fact that the compensation is imperfect, so that some of the impacts of greenhouse gases remain and aerosols add their own impacts), a major issue is that CO2 can stay in the atmosphere for hundreds or thousands of years (there is not one single time scale, because the fraction of CO2 that is removed by terrestrial ecosystems and oceans per unit time is decreasing progressively), while stratospheric aerosols have a mean life of a few years. Therefore, once the intervention has begun, we are forced to continue. If carbon accumulates in the atmosphere without global warming thanks to the aerosols, but at some point, the injection of aerosols stops for any reason, the world will warm abruptly [155]. This is an instance in which a small or medium socioeconomic fluctuation would be amplified and affect the whole system.\n\nTaking all of this into account, if humanity ever has access to some abundant, virtually inexhaustible source of energy (this is the promise of nuclear fusion, but its fulfillment will have to wait, at least, until late in the 21st century, and it might turn out to be unfeasible; in the quickest scenario, the first commercial plants will begin to operate by about 2050 [156]), sustainability will not be guaranteed, yet. Not only will we need to find ways to avoid that it be used for destructive purposes, but also for constructive purposes in such a quick and ordered way that they result in supercriticality.\n\n6.3. Economic System and Equity\n\nIf we accept that it is possible to build the kind of institution envisaged in Section 6.2, the next question is how it is to “tame” the economic system and in which direction. I have already mentioned the conflict between ethical goals such as equality and BOC features like the nearly scale-invariant income distribution. However, the BOC paradigm does not imply that features like this one should be unavoidable. Assuming that all long-lasting complex systems are BOC does not mean that they should be BOC in all of their dimensions. For example, many terrestrial ecosystems are instances of either self-organized criticality or some other mechanism, leading them to display patterns BOC in their fire regimes, while tropical rainforests are not [75], but are probably BOC in other aspects, such as biodiversity.\n\nLasting regulation of the economic system on social and ecological grounds can be conceived of by combining two ingredients: (1) a regulating system that is itself BOC, along the lines suggested in Section 6.2; and (2) that the regulation exerted by this institution is not much more than that strictly needed to attain its ultimate goals, leaving ample margin for variability and self-organization whenever there are different paths that lead to these same goals. Once the first item is attained, a strict planning of the economy is imaginable without as much danger of perversion or collapse as the Soviet Union might have suffered (Section 3.3), but removing unneeded rigidities should further reduce such risks by increasing resilience, enhancing distributed computation and exploration, and increasing the overall viability of the project because of an entropy-like effect: the more possibilities you contemplate, the larger the probability of succeeding at least in one of them. This should not be interpreted as a defense of reformism: by limiting regulation to “the strictly needed to attain its ultimate goals”, it is meant to really attain the ultimate goal. Furthermore, the free market is just one expression of flexibility. For example, the regulations emitted by the democratic system on a global scale could leave much margin to organize in various ways the local organs of the democratic institution, which could even take varying degrees of control on local economies. Depending on cultural differences, some regions might be more favorable to communal property and others more favorable to private but well-distributed property. More communal economies could be administered from the bottom-up by means of the local organs of the global democratic institution and also by means of other parallel institutions.\n\nFollowing the BOC philosophy of not putting all eggs in the same basket, all proposals of alternative systems in the literature deserve attention. A most useful research program will consist of scanning such proposals and use a complex systems approach to assess their feasibility and the risk of undesired emergent properties. Complex systems theory teaches us that we should always be ready for unsuspected emergent properties, but also that some emergent properties can be predicted, and gives us tools for doing so (proposed models can be studied in a variety of ways, including qualitative assessment, mathematical modeling and analysis, simplified simulations and complex agent-based models). Here, I advance some tentative conclusions, but this is largely a research project for the future.\n\nMidway between theoretical analyses and the application of policies at a large or medium scale, there is an important role for groups of people who, already now, try to practice alternative ways of living at a small scale. These experiences are the experimental arm of the search for alternatives, providing a context in which many innovative solutions emerge, and have a key role in the dissemination of ideas. Complexity scientists can analyze these experiences, provide inputs to try to fix their problems (as already done in [40]) or to explore new possibilities and, crucially, try to anticipate the consequences of attempts at scaling them up.\n\nJust one global alternative model having passed all tests (the different types of analysis and small-scale experiments when applicable) will suffice for us to say that we have a reliable alternative, which is what is missed desperately by many people. The more reliable recipes the better, because this will increase the possibilities that at least one of them is eventually implemented and also of having a convincing “Plan B” if something goes wrong. Furthermore, as the number of recipes increases, there is a combinatorics increase in the number of sets of recipes that could be deployed in parallel in different regions according to differing cultural preferences.\n\nThere is a huge literature on mechanisms to increase the environmental sustainability of a market system. Even schools with disparate theoretical foundations, such as ecological economics and environmental economics, agree in the usefulness of some instruments, such as environmental taxes. However, in a context of high inequality, limiting the access to environmental sources and sinks can be an obstacle for a large fraction of the population to fulfill their basic needs (see also Section 4.1). This is a strong reason not to separate environmental sustainability from equity. Furthermore, the treatment of equity is generally perceived as the key point that allows defining different economic systems. Even though there are a number of proposals for alternative systems with enhanced equity, there is a wide perception of a lack of credible alternatives. Two reasons can contribute to this situation: (1) vested interest in sidelining this topic (originating in those favored by the status quo and internalized by others); and (2) its inherent complexity. The theoretical approach presented here will hardly be useful if it does not give answers for this issue. The following paragraphs review and discuss how equity is addressed in several alternative proposals that are not mainly based on command and control and outlines a tentative assessment of the implications of some of these from a complex systems point of view. However, this is mostly research yet to be done.\n\nThe “steady-state” model developed by ecological economist Hermann Daly [168,169] provides a convenient starting point, because it seeks the simplest possible changes in the rules of a capitalistic economy that would give rise to a sustainable and equitable system. Daly imagined a market system with privately owned production means, which would be unregulated except for a few clear-cut constraints, to be enforced by public institutions (this is reminiscent of physical systems in thermodynamic equilibrium, which are free to move from one “microstate” to another, but only within a well-defined set of available states, which have to be compatible with some given, often simple, constraints, such as the total available energy). In regard to equity, the constraints would consist of a minimum and a maximum limit to individual income and a maximum limit to individual wealth. People approaching the upper ceiling of income or wealth would be heavily taxed, and this would contribute part of the money to warrant the minimum income (another source being payments for access to the limited amount of natural resources that would be made available). Several variations exist on this proposal. Mostly independently of Daly's contributions, there has been much discussion on various forms of minimum income [170,171], ranging from “minimum guaranteed income” to “basic universal income”, and complemented to different degrees by the services provided by classical welfare-state institutions. Both the minimum and the maximum income have been embraced by degrowth proponents [172], also contemplating variations, such as a minimum “income” in kind rather than money [173]. Daly's distributive recipe would modify the scale-invariant income and wealth distributions in the conceptually simplest manner: by cutting their extremes away.\n\nIn Daly's model, the range of income (and the limit to wealth) could be narrow enough to ensure that nobody has their basic needs unfulfilled and that nobody obtains extra benefits for the sole fact of being already affluent and acquires disproportionate power within the economy. On the other hand, it could be broad enough to ensure that people can benefit from their own work and from their abstinence from consuming and act according to market signals. In this type of market, market signals would truly reflect social preferences within sustainability constraints. In a capitalist market, part of the information processing has to do with a few affluent people having much impact on the market, these people being selected in part by how well their decisions fit market signals, which have however little relation to social preferences and even less to sustainability. The associated nearly power law income distribution is a symptom of the system processing information BOC. By setting ceilings, this process is eliminated, but there can still be self-organization and information processing BOC in other different ways. Patterns of behavior that allow some people getting closer to the upper ceiling to income, or obtaining some given income with less effort, or increasing their life satisfaction for other reasons, would be probably copied by other people. This would suffice to keep in motion the essentials of a natural selection-type mechanism. The resulting distribution of the number of people adhering to each pattern of economic behavior could well be a power law, as it is for species abundances in an ecological community [67], where it can be interpreted as a symptom of information processing BOC (Section 2.3). Medium-scale coherent plans could still emerge from large firms (which could exist in spite of being made up of people with little economic differences among them, for example, but not only, in the form of cooperatives), in addition to the public democratic institutions.\n\nA major problem with Daly's model is the need of severe control and the risk of too strong political pressure from people close to the ceiling to income or wealth, in order to remove or lever it. This is one of the kinds of problems of current alternative proposals in which an econophysical approach can make a difference. Ideally, it would be possible to design economic mechanisms that would lead to some given income distribution as an indirect, emergent result. Besides setting a legal ceiling, we could set rules that make it extremely difficult for a person to reach the ceiling without the need of receiving much direct pressure from the institutions, thus reducing, to some extent, the likelihood of the emergence of a well-defined sector opposing these policies because of their self-interest. Appendix 7 shows how this would be possible based on a simple model of income distribution (following Section 3.2.1.). Probably, this model is not realistic enough, because the mechanisms determining income distribution are not well known. However, the exercise in Appendix 7 gives a prototype for a kind of economic policy modeling that merits intensive research (Trigaux [174] also studied, in an econophysical model, how intentional changes in parameters could produce drastic increases in equality). The model in Appendix 7 also contemplates one kind of direct pressure, which is taxing. Besides, it contemplates policies that might indirectly reduce rates of profit, such as the alternative banking formulas mentioned below. An even more promising indirect policy tool is the active assistance to people at the lower end of the income distribution to help them develop their own economic activities. In addition to granting a minimum income, this assistance could be materialized in the form of microcredits, technical and psychosocial support, preference in the supply to public institutions or some kind of certification to attract ethical consumption. If the size of the economy is constrained (by the amount of remaining natural resources or those whose use is allowed or by a saturated demand not stimulated by advertising), increasing income for people at the lower end of the distribution will translate to decreasing income elsewhere. The onus of econophysical models is to predict how this decrease in income will be distributed among the different income classes, considering also the other relevant factors. A nontrivial feature of the simple model in Appendix 7 is that an upper ceiling to income emerges for some parameter values, and the position of this upper ceiling changes as a function of the intensity of active assistance at the lower end of the distribution. The model suggests that changes in banking mechanisms along the lines mentioned below would also bring the ceiling down. It is well known that many complex systems display phase transitions (Section 2.2), i.e., qualitative changes resulting from incremental, quantitative changes in control parameters: in the model in Appendix 7, the consequences of crossing the threshold (where the ceiling emerges) might not be clearly apparent until reaching some given distance away from this critical point, but in other cases, the change can be much more visible (the reason is that Appendix 7's model displays a second-order phase transition, while first-order transitions are more readily apparent; see Section 2.2). This possibility motivates a revision of the dichotomy between “reformism” and “revolutionary change”. These are generally distinguished by the methods used to change society. However, this criterion is questionable inasmuch as an incremental change in a tool used for reformist policy can result in an abrupt shift that compares to a revolution. Given the highly technical nature of recipes like these, once better understood they should be recast in a plain language for them to become a subject of popular discussion and not being coopted by powerful minorities wishing to increase inequality rather than decrease it.\n\nWhile Daly's is a top-down recipe that attempts to force some given global results, most “alternative” economic recipes are based on rules of interaction among agents, whose global consequences, if generalized, are not trivial to predict. Most of these have been grouped under labels such as “solidarity economy”, “social economy” and “social and solidarity economy” [175,176] (henceforth, just social economy). There is a long history of implementation of such recipes on a limited scale, coexisting with the hegemonic capitalistic patterns of economic relations [175,176]. Therefore, they have been emerging from the bottom up, even though they might also need top-down support if they are to become the norm. These include cooperatives of production, consumption and credit, mutual aid associations, ethical banking (with credits conditional upon environmental and social criteria), and small experiences of alternative markets such as local exchange trading systems (LETS) [177], which are based on collective interest-free credit. There is a potential for synergy among these types of experiences, which have been seen as pieces for a completely different system by several writers, already in the 19th century (e.g., Proudhon [178]) and also nowadays [176,179]. For example, credits granted by a public or collectively owned banking system could be interest-free, while avoiding an imbalance between offer and demand by setting social and environmental benefits as a “price”. Such credit conditions would give a chance for low-income people (e.g., grouped in cooperatives) to overcome their dependence upon the owners of capital. A “social economic” market would self-organize subject to some basic rules of interaction, and like other markets, it would possibly function BOC. The long experience with social economy all over the world, especially with cooperatives, gives empirical support to its feasibility [176,180,181] and allows identifying barriers to its propagation [182]. An important topic of research is the design of policies that would allow overcoming these barriers (e.g., the credit system described above). One hypothesis is that this is easy enough to be able to reach an overwhelming dominance of cooperatives without a great cost in terms of economic performance and control effort. A different hypothesis is that cooperatives are too difficult to generalize because they imply quite specific patterns of relations, perhaps reducing the available states of the system more than really needed. The later case would lead us to favor proposals such as Felber's [179], who would enforce the cooperative structure legally, but only for firms above some given size (while promoting cooperativism also among smaller firms and setting constraints on the differences of salary in all cases). Another important research topic, needing an econophysical approach, is the global consequences for sustainability and equity if social economic structures become hegemonic. Even though a social economy developing in a democratic context is not entirely comparable to cooperativism under an authoritarian regime, the Yugoslavian experience is a major source of empirical information. This suggests that cooperativism is effective in reducing inequality within firms [183] (which is coherent with their image elsewhere), but not so much in reducing other dimensions of inequality [183], thus needing to be complemented by other policies (several possibilities are mentioned throughout this section).\n\nFelber [179] has recently popularized a specific proposal to put together different social economic initiatives in a coherent system, under the label of economy for the “common good” (this label had also been applied to Daly's steady-state economy [184]). This proposal aims to gradually transform conventional firms into social firms (or gradually replace the first with the last). The main tool that it contemplates is the “common good balance sheet”, which would label each firm's social and environmental performance according to a standardized set of democratically-chosen criteria. This balance sheet is expected to have an increasing influence on the decisions of public and private consumption and investment. Therefore, this transformation would not rely on command and control methods (legal constraints are contemplated, as mentioned above, but only after the transformation is largely done), but, rather, on altering the natural selection-like pressures to which firms are exposed. The proposal depicts a gradual, self-organized transition taking advantage of “distributed computation” and allowing for a diversity of paths to emerge, which is coherent with the BOC paradigm. However, the potential for this recipe to deliver the expected transformation is still unknown. Furthermore, the proposal would benefit from a detailed econophysical analysis to refine it and prevent unintended consequences. For example, among the behaviors that Felber suggests to favor, there is cooperation and mutual help among firms: it is important to make sure that this is not implemented in a way that generates clusters of interdependent firms that might be too brittle (see Sections 2.4 and 3.2.2.).\n\nAs is well known, the private property of the means of production is left behind in some of the most radical alternatives. In industrial societies, most real-world instances have taken place under authoritarian regimes, whose problems have already been discussed. However, in Catalonia, there was an experience of generalized, bottom-up, democratically-ruled collectivization [185,186]. This was an attempt to move directly to the kind of society that could be imagined as the asymptotic result of recipes like Felber's. The experiment was soon stopped by its opponents. Recently, Ackerman [187] discussed how the increasing separation between ownership and management in contemporary capitalism suggests ways to move to a scenario of public property of the means of production, while conserving some of the dynamic and informational advantages of capitalist markets.\n\nWhile a guaranteed minimum income or a universal basic income would ensure that some basic needs are covered and cooperativism or analogous patterns of organization would ensure fair relations of production, neither ensures employment. Employment is not only a means to obtain income, but also a potential way for a person to contribute to society (inasmuch as the type of economic activity is socially beneficial, which, however, is often not the case in the current context). This is positive both for society and for the individual's self-esteem and social integration [188]. Even though it is certainly not the only way to contribute to society, solutions are needed to avoid involuntary unemployment. This need is repeatedly put forward as an argument to foster economic growth at any price. However, indefinite economic growth is unlikely to be feasible (Section 4), and maintaining growth in the short term makes long-term sustainability more difficult to achieve in a form that is socially acceptable. An alternative with a long history in the context of the worker movement is the regulation of working time to foster work sharing. This proposal was embraced by the German Greens as a part of their antiproductivist platforms in the 1980s [8] and more recently by degrowth proponents [189]. These proposals should be clearly distinguished from part-time working schemes associated with precarious working conditions. However, to some extent, they are already feasible in a capitalist context and, in different forms, can be applied in any system in which there is a relatively well-defined working time (there are instances of this [185]). Since markets are not generally in equilibrium, the full benefits of reducing working time will take some time to materialize, but this lag can be shortened by active labor policies. However, there are some controversies about work sharing in the literature [189]. Some mainstream economists question the effectiveness of reducing working time as a tool to create net employment, based, however, on inconclusive empirical evidence. Another issue is that, while in a degrowth process many economic activities would be removed, others might demand more work, because of a possible decrease in productivity in a world with less natural resources (discussed in [190,191]). Therefore, it is difficult to know if, in an environmentally sustainable society, there will be more or less work to do. This will largely depend on future developments in fields such as renewable energy, other environmentally-friendly technologies and agroecology. In any case, the need for hard work to secure sustainability does not justify hard work in activities that accelerate resource depletion and environmental degradation, as is the case for most current economic activities. Since we cannot take for granted that the need of labor will change following a unidirectional trend (because of the uncertainty in long-term needs and also because of shorter-term economic cycles), it would be most convenient to have institutional arrangements to share the demanded work, both when it decreases and when it increases [192]. The most trivial mechanism would be a succession of adaptive changes in the standard working week. Another mechanism would be taxing long working weeks in order to penalize them and to raise funds to incentivize shorter (but not precarious) working schemes. This would automatize the adaptation of the average working time to evolving needs at a societal level, while easing the adaptation of firms to the changes in average working time. However, any specific recipe focusing on the part of working time that is formalized and quantified should also consider its indirect effects on less visible forms of work. For example, the German Greens in their 1983 social platform ([193], reviewed in [8]) prioritized the reduction of the working week over formulas such as earlier retirement or longer vacations (we can add sabbatical years, which are proposed in [179]), because only the first eases the sharing of unpaid work between genders.\n\nA discussion of economic alternatives would be clearly incomplete if it only contemplated the part of economic activity that is currently monetized, formalized, visible and hegemonic. Feminist economics [194] highlights that the functioning of the current economic system largely relies on other types of work, which is disproportionately carried out by women. In another strand of discourse, some authors have emphasized the virtues of non-monetized activities as an alternative, at least partial, to the currently hegemonic economic relations [84]. Arguably, such activities have an affective added value and also a positive cultural effect in that they can help in preventing simplistic unidimensional thinking focusing on money, which is at odds with the mentality needed to reach sustainability in all of its irreducible [195] dimensions. Some non-monetized activities, and activities that are partially monetized and labeled as informal, have been praised for other purported benefits, including equity [84]. While there are good arguments for the promotion of some non-monetized economic activities, it would be unrealistic to aggregate all of them in a single category and evaluate them accordingly. This is the realm of traditional communal settings and of promising alternatives, but also of injustices ranging from inequality within modern households to feudal relations and soft slavery. Probably the best that can be done with non-monetized economy is to make it visible in order to fight its worst expressions, identify its potentialities and develop the later. Since there is no discontinuity between non-monetized economy and affective relations, some of the most promising alternatives in this area (e.g., [196]) have little relation to economics as usually understood.\n\nIn the current context, “non-monetized economy” is closely related (but not equivalent) to “informal economy”, which consists of activities that are relatively decoupled from the main control circuitry of the society. From a BOC point of view, the “informal” has an important role: by lying apart from the dominant order, it contributes to the chaos that society needs, being a source of innovation and experimentation. The informal sphere is an obvious niche for small-scale alternative projects. However, when some of these innovations propagate, they can become a new order. As such, they should be filtered according to collective interest. The task of filtering would belong to a truly democratic institution as portrayed in Section 6.2, complemented and in interaction with social movements. One of the aims of this task is to confront emerging patterns of economic relations based, for example, on exploitation, discrimination or environmental degradation. Complex systems theory teaches us that also some initiatives that are well intentioned, and that function well while they are young and anecdotal, could have undesirable consequences as they age and propagate, in the form of unsought emergent properties. For example, one could agree with parents that prefer to educate their children at home to give them some values that they might not encounter at mainstream schools. However, if educating children at home becomes the norm and this includes older children, the frontier between education and work can easily get blurred, giving rise to competitive pressure in favor of families taking advantage of children' labor, as has been common throughout history and is currently common in a large part of the planet. In its turn, this creates an incentive for reproduction, which either is compensated for by larger mortality or leads, transiently, to demographic growth. Being demography a key component of sustainability, it cannot be overlooked that volunteer reductions of natality have been associated with the partial transfer of some economic functions from the domestic to the “formal” sphere, including education, social security, retirement and women's work (which, precisely, give keys for a left-wing response to the demographic issue [197]). All of these are factors to be considered when seeking the most desirable partition between the “formal” economy (also, and especially, when it is no longer capitalist) and other realities that can coexist with it.\n\nIt is absolutely essential that a change toward sustainability and equality considers the international dimension. While early in the 19th century (when most contemporary ideologies were born), within-country inequality accounted for about 70% of global inequality, in 2002, it represented only about 20%, the rest being accounted for by differences among countries [198]. Furthermore, some of the main environmental problems have a global nature, and the international economy has a major impact on domestic economic policies. There is a large literature about measures for justice in the global economy, e.g., the abolition of unfair financial debts and the recognition of ecological debts, the elimination of structural adjustment plans as multilateral institutions are democratized, global agreements to control and tax international financial fluxes, the removal of the barriers to the dissemination of technology posed by some intellectual property rules, removal of barriers to migration, and fair and ambitious agreements to manage the global environmental commons (e.g., mitigating climate change). This is a huge area that will not be treated in detail. It is indeed related to the discussion about a global democratic system in Section 6.2. An interesting issue is the kind of international economic treaties that could replace the current ones. In the context of the World Trade Organization (WTO) (and, previously, the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, GATT), countries can integrate into the global market at varying speeds; however, at each step, they assume rules to be applied systematically in their relations to every other country, rather than negotiating bilateral agreements. This setting has elements of order and of disorder that could be reproduced in other schemes more useful for our purposes. However, there would be major changes in other aspects. The bias toward integration would be removed, allowing also for progressive separation from the international market whenever this is the choice of a country. Openness to trade with other countries would be systematically conditional upon compatibility in social and environmental standards (which could otherwise be threatened by market dynamics). Simultaneously, there would be a systematic advantage for low income countries. However, rather than preferential access to the markets of high income countries (which can only favor low income countries by means of a trickle-down effect that will vanish as soon as there is no more growth [21] and that is extremely inefficient even with growth [20]), these would be granted a higher capacity to protect their domestic production from international competition. The development of a pattern of economic relations among countries favoring equality would benefit from the same type of modeling approach that is outlined in Appendix 7 for relations among individuals (or households)."
