        "text": "Abstract This paper provides an exhaustive review of the literature on the characterization of financial time series. A stylized fact is a term in economics used to refer to empirical findings that are so consistent across markets that they are accepted as truth. Financial time series may be characterized by the following stylized facts. The autocorrelation of returns is largely insignificant.\n\nHigh-frequency financial time series data have an ability to define market microstructure and are helpful in making rational real-time decisions. These data sets carry unique characteristics and properties which are not available in low-frequency data; with that high-frequency data also create more challenges and opportunities for econometric modelling and financial data analysis. So it is essential to know the features and the facts related to the high-frequency time series data. In this article, we provide the characteristics and stylized facts exhibited by the high-frequency financial time series data of the S&P CNX Nifty futures index. Stylized facts are mostly related to the empirical observed behaviours, distributional properties, autocorrelation function and seasonality of the high-frequency data. Also, it illustrates the importance of stationarity in financial time series analysis. The knowledge of such facts and concepts is helpful to establish better empirical models and t...\n\nWe present some stylized facts exhibited by the time series of returns of the Mexican Stock Exchange Index (IPC) and compare them to a sample of both developed (USA, UK and Japan) and emerging markets (Brazil and India). The period of study is 1997-2011. The stylized facts are related mostly to the probability distribution function and the autocorrelation function (e.g. fat tails, non-normality, volatility cluster- ing, among others). We find that positive skewness for returns in Mexico and Brazil, but not in the rest, suggest investment opportunities. Evidence of nonlinearity is also documented.\n\nFinancial time-series has been of interest of many statisticians and financial experts. Understanding the characteristic features of a financial-time series has posed some difficulties because of its quasi-periodic nature. Linear statistics can be applied to a periodic time series, but since financial time series is non-linear and non-stationary, analysis of its quasi periodic characteristics is not entirely possible with linear statistics. Thus, the study of financial series of stock market still remains a complex task having its specific requirements. In this paper keeping in mind the recent trends and developments in financial time series studies, we want to establish if there is any significant relationship existing between trading behavior of developing and developed markets. The study is conducted to draw conclusions on similarity or differences between developing economies, developed economies, developing-developed economy pairs. We take the leading stock market indices datas...\n\nThe aim of this paper is to apply a nonparametric methodology developed by Donoho et al (2003 IEEE Trans. Signal Processing 53 614-27) for estimating an autocovariance sequence to the statistical analysis of the return of securities and discuss the advantages offered by this approach over other existing methods such as fixed-window-length segmentation procedures.
