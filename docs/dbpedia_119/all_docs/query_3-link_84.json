        "text": "Using price action to uncover the market's secrets! ðŸ“ˆðŸ’¡ Nial Fuller reminds us that every price movement is the result of a complex interaction between fundamental indicators, technical analysis, and trader psychology. It's a reflection of economic data, market sentiment, and human behavior rather than just numbers on a chart. The secret to navigating the ever-changing financial currents is to understand price action. ðŸ’¬âœ¨ Let's explore the art and science of trading in more detail! . . #trading #tradingtips #tradingforex #priceaction #priceactiontrader #priceactiontrading #priceactionanalysis #fundamentalindicators #technicalanalysis #nialfuller #stockmarket #sharemarketindia #sharemarketinvesting\n\nI'm happy to announce that the paper I jointly wrote with Daniele Girolimetto and Tommaso Di Fonzo has been accepted in the Journal of Financial Econometrics. In our paper \"Exploiting Intraday Decompositions in Realized Volatility Forecasting: A Forecast Reconciliation Approach,\" we address the construction of realized variance (RV) forecasts by exploiting the hierarchical structure implicit in available decompositions of RV. We propose a post-forecasting approach that utilizes bottom-up and regression-based reconciliation methods. Using data on the Dow Jones Industrial Average index and its constituents, we show that exploiting the information content of hierarchies improves forecasting accuracy.

Our paper can be download from Researchgate. Comments are welcome! We propose a simple continuous-time stochastic model for capturing the dynamics of a limit order book in the presence of liquidity fluctuations. Inspired by Farmer et al. (2004), we define a model for the dynamics of spread that incorporates liquidity fluctuations and undertake a comprehensive study of the modelâ€™s properties, providing rigorous proofs of several key asymptotic theorems. Furthermore, we show how large deviations manifest in the spread under this regime. https://lnkd.in/eN6XzTQQ\n\n2024.06.14 week 24, real money portfolio correlation matrix with future projection. https://lnkd.in/ekyPen-G The Analytical Model of Financial Market is based on Multidimensional Geometric Brownian Motion â€“ the most common class of stochastic processes used in mathematical finance to model the dynamics of prices. While the math behind the continuous-time portfolio theory is far more complicated, its logic substantially stays the same. Fortunately, it appears that the essential properties of efficient portfolios under single- period and multi-period settings are quite similar, which makes it possible to use results obtained in the single-period model in its multi-period counterpart. In particular, in the simplest case structure of respective optimal portfolio strategies is shifted from constant number of units in each asset to constant portfolio weights.\n\nThis is what happens when you try to understand stochastic calculus for the very 1st time. Stochastic calculus, particularly Ito's Lemma and stochastic differential equations, is fundamental in quant finance for modeling random processes like asset prices and interest rates. Its applications include derivative pricing, where it helps in the valuation of options through models like the Black-Scholes equation, risk management by quantifying the variability in portfolios, and asset modeling for predicting price movements. These mathematical tools enable quants to create models that reflect the randomness of markets, manage risks more effectively, and devise strategies for investment and trading.

Such models are used in finance to simulate the price of the underlying asset and then to value options. They are able to explain with a few additional parameters why the Black-Scholes implied volatility of options with different strike prices or time to maturity are different.
