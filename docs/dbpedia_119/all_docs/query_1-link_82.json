        "text": "Entropy and econophysics\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nRosser, J. Barkley\n\n2016-12-01\n\nEntropy is a central concept of statistical mechanics, which is the main branch of physics that underlies econophysics, the application of physics concepts to understand economic phenomena. It enters into econophysics both in an ontological way through the Second Law of Thermodynamics as this drives the world economy from its ecological foundations as solar energy passes through food chains in dissipative process of entropy rising and production fundamentally involving the replacement of lower entropy energy states with higher entropy ones. In contrast the mathematics of entropy as appearing in information theory becomes the basis for modeling financial market dynamics as well as income and wealth distribution dynamics. It also provides the basis for an alternative view of stochastic price equilibria in economics, as well providing a crucial link between econophysics and sociophysics, keeping in mind the essential unity of the various concepts of entropy.\n\nBOOK REVIEW: New Directions in Statistical Physics: Econophysics, Bioinformatics, and Pattern Recognition\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nGrassberger, P.\n\n2004-10-01\n\nThis book contains 18 contributions from different authors. Its subtitle `Econophysics, Bioinformatics, and Pattern Recognition' says more precisely what it is about: not so much about central problems of conventional statistical physics like equilibrium phase transitions and critical phenomena, but about its interdisciplinary applications. After a long period of specialization, physicists have, over the last few decades, found more and more satisfaction in breaking out of the limitations set by the traditional classification of sciences. Indeed, this classification had never been strict, and physicists in particular had always ventured into other fields. Helmholtz, in the middle of the 19th century, had considered himself a physicist when working on physiology, stressing that the physics of animate nature is as much a legitimate field of activity as the physics of inanimate nature. Later, Max DelbrÃ¼ck and Francis Crick did for experimental biology what SchrÃ¶dinger did for its theoretical foundation. And many of the experimental techniques used in chemistry, biology, and medicine were developed by a steady stream of talented physicists who left their proper discipline to venture out into the wider world of science. The development we have witnessed over the last thirty years or so is different. It started with neural networks where methods could be applied which had been developed for spin glasses, but todays list includes vehicular traffic (driven lattice gases), geology (self-organized criticality), economy (fractal stochastic processes and large scale simulations), engineering (dynamical chaos), and many others. By staying in the physics departments, these activities have transformed the physics curriculum and the view physicists have of themselves. In many departments there are now courses on econophysics or on biological physics, and some universities offer degrees in the physics of traffic or in econophysics. In order to document this change of attitude\n\nInterdisciplinary applications of statistical physics to complex systems: Seismic physics, econophysics, and sociophysics\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nTenenbaum, Joel\n\nThis thesis applies statistical physics concepts and methods to quantitatively analyze complex systems. This thesis is separated into four parts: (i) characteristics of earthquake systems (ii) memory and volatility in data time series (iii) the application of part (ii) to world financial markets, and (iv) statistical observations on the evolution of word usage. In Part I, we observe statistical patterns in the occurrence of earthquakes. We select a 14-year earthquake catalog covering the archipelago of Japan. We find that regions traditionally thought of as being too distant from one another for causal contact display remarkably high correlations, and the networks that result have a tendency to link highly connected areas with other highly connected areas. In Part II, we introduce and apply the concept of \"volatility asymmetry\", the primary use of which is in financial data. We explain the relation between memory and \"volatility asymmetry\" in terms of an asymmetry parameter lambda. We define a litmus test for determining whether lambda is statistically significant and propose a stochastic model based on this parameter and use the model to further explain empirical data. In Part III, we expand on volatility asymmetry. Importing the concepts of time dependence and universality from physics, we explore the aspects of emerging (or \"transition\") economies in Eastern Europe as they relate to asymmetry. We find that these emerging markets in some instances behave like developed markets and in other instances do not, and that the distinction is a matter both of country and a matter of time period, crisis periods showing different asymmetry characteristics than \"healthy\" periods. In Part IV, we take note of a series of findings in econophysics, showing statistical growth similarities between a variety of different areas that all have in common the fact of taking place in areas that are both (i) competing and (ii) dynamic. We show that this same growth distribution can be\n\nSome past and present challenges of econophysics\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nMantegna, R. N.\n\n2016-12-01\n\nWe discuss the cultural background that was shared by some of the first econophysicists when they started to work on economic and financial problems with methods and tools of statistical physics. In particular we discuss about the role of stylized facts and statistical physical laws in economics and statistical physics respectively. As an example of the problems and potentials associated with the interaction of different communities of scholars dealing with problems observed in economic and financial systems we briefly discuss the development and the perspectives of the use of tools and concepts of networks in econophysics, economics and finance.\n\nWorrying trends in econophysics\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nGallegati, Mauro; Keen, Steve; Lux, Thomas; Ormerod, Paul\n\n2006-10-01\n\nEconophysics has already made a number of important empirical contributions to our understanding of the social and economic world. These fall mainly into the areas of finance and industrial economics, where in each case there is a large amount of reasonably well-defined data. More recently, Econophysics has also begun to tackle other areas of economics where data is much more sparse and much less reliable. In addition, econophysicists have attempted to apply the theoretical approach of statistical physics to try to understand empirical findings. Our concerns are fourfold. First, a lack of awareness of work that has been done within economics itself. Second, resistance to more rigorous and robust statistical methodology. Third, the belief that universal empirical regularities can be found in many areas of economic activity. Fourth, the theoretical models which are being used to explain empirical phenomena. The latter point is of particular concern. Essentially, the models are based upon models of statistical physics in which energy is conserved in exchange processes. There are examples in economics where the principle of conservation may be a reasonable approximation to reality, such as primitive hunter-gatherer societies. But in the industrialised capitalist economies, income is most definitely not conserved. The process of production and not exchange is responsible for this. Models which focus purely on exchange and not on production cannot by definition offer a realistic description of the generation of income in the capitalist, industrialised economies.\n\n1996-2016: Two decades of econophysics: Between methodological diversification and conceptual coherence\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nSchinckus, C.\n\n2016-12-01\n\nThis article aimed at presenting the scattered econophysics literature as a unified and coherent field through a specific lens imported from philosophy science. More precisely, I used the methodology developed by Imre Lakatos to cover the methodological evolution of econophysics over these last two decades. In this perspective, three co-existing approaches have been identified: statistical econophysics, bottom-up agent based econophysics and top-down agent based econophysics. Although the last is presented here as the last step of the methodological evolution of econophysics, it is worth mentioning that this tradition is still very new. A quick look on the econophysics literature shows that the vast majority of works in this field deal with a strictly statistical approach or a classical bottom-up agent-based modelling. In this context of diversification, the objective (and contribution) of this article is to emphasize the conceptual coherence of econophysics as a unique field of research. With this purpose, I used a theoretical framework coming from philosophy of science to characterize how econophysics evolved by combining a methodological enrichment with the preservation of its core conceptual statements.\n\nReconstructing Macroeconomics Based on Statistical Physics\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nAoki, Masanao; Yoshikawa, Hiroshi\n\nWe believe that time has come to integrate the new approach based on statistical physics or econophysics into macroeconomics. Toward this goal, there must be more dialogues between physicists and economists. In this paper, we argue that there is no reason why the methods of statistical physics so successful in many fields of natural sciences cannot be usefully applied to macroeconomics that is meant to analyze the macroeconomy comprising a large number of economic agents. It is, in fact, weird to regard the macroeconomy as a homothetic enlargement of the representative micro agent. We trust the bright future of the new approach to macroeconomies based on statistical physics.\n\nMonetary economics from econophysics perspective\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nYakovenko, Victor M.\n\n2016-12-01\n\nThis is an invited article for the Discussion and Debate special issue of The European Physical Journal Special Topics on the subject \"Can Economics be a Physical Science?\" The first part of the paper traces the personal path of the author from theoretical physics to economics. It briefly summarizes applications of statistical physics to monetary transactions in an ensemble of economic agents. It shows how a highly unequal probability distribution of money emerges due to irreversible increase of entropy in the system. The second part examines deep conceptual and controversial issues and fallacies in monetary economics from econophysics perspective. These issues include the nature of money, conservation (or not) of money, distinctions between money vs. wealth and money vs. debt, creation of money by the state and debt by the banks, the origins of monetary crises and capitalist profit. Presentation uses plain language understandable to laypeople and may be of interest to both specialists and general public.\n\nApplications of statistical physics methods in economics: Current state and perspectives\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nLux, Thomas\n\n2016-12-01\n\nThis note discusses the development of applications of statistical physics to economics since the beginning of the `econophysics' movement about twenty years ago. I attempt to assess which of these applications appear particularly valuable and successful, and where important overlaps exist between research conducted by economist and `econophysicists'.\n\nGPU-computing in econophysics and statistical physics\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nPreis, T.\n\n2011-03-01\n\nA recent trend in computer science and related fields is general purpose computing on graphics processing units (GPUs), which can yield impressive performance. With multiple cores connected by high memory bandwidth, today's GPUs offer resources for non-graphics parallel processing. This article provides a brief introduction into the field of GPU computing and includes examples. In particular computationally expensive analyses employed in financial market context are coded on a graphics card architecture which leads to a significant reduction of computing time. In order to demonstrate the wide range of possible applications, a standard model in statistical physics - the Ising model - is ported to a graphics card architecture as well, resulting in large speedup values.\n\nEconophysics: Past and present\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nde Area LeÃ£o Pereira, Eder Johnson; da Silva, Marcus Fernandes; Pereira, H. B. B.\n\n2017-05-01\n\nThis paper provides a brief historical review of the relationship between economics and physics, beginning with Adam Smith being influenced by Isaac Newton's ideas up to the present day including the new econophysics discipline and some of the tools applied to the economy. Thus, this work is expected to motivate new researchers who are interested in this new discipline.\n\nUps and downs of economics and econophysics â Facebook forecast\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nGajic, Nenad; Budinski-Petkovic, Ljuba\n\n2013-01-01\n\nWhat is econophysics and its relationship with economics? What is the state of economics after the global economic crisis, and is there a future for the paradigm of market equilibrium, with imaginary perfect competition and rational agents? Can the next paradigm of economics adopt important assumptions derived from econophysics models: that markets are chaotic systems, striving to extremes as bubbles and crashes show, with psychologically motivated, statistically predictable individual behaviors? Is the future of econophysics, as predicted here, to disappear and become a part of economics? A good test of the current state of econophysics and its methods is the valuation of Facebook immediately after the initial public offering - this forecast indicates that Facebook is highly overvalued, and its IPO valuation of 104 billion dollars is mostly the new financial bubble based on the expectations of unlimited growth, although itâs easy to prove that Facebook is close to the upper limit of its users.\n\nEconophysics and evolutionary economics (Scientific session of the Physical Sciences Division of the Russian Academy of Sciences, 2 November 2010)\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\n2011-07-01\n\nThe scientific session \"Econophysics and evolutionary economics\" of the Division of Physical Sciences of the Russian Academy of Sciences (RAS) took place on 2 November 2010 in the conference hall of the Lebedev Physical Institute, Russian Academy of Sciences.

P.\n\n2015-03-01\n\nExperimental econophysics is concerned with statistical physics of humans in the laboratory, and it is based on controlled human experiments developed by physicists to study some problems related to economics or finance. It relies on controlled human experiments in the laboratory together with agent-based modeling (for computer simulations and/or analytical theory), with an attempt to reveal the general cause-effect relationship between specific conditions and emergent properties of real economic/financial markets (a kind of complex adaptive systems). Here I review the latest progress in the field, namely, stylized facts, herd behavior, contrarian behavior, spontaneous cooperation, partial information, and risk management. Also, I highlight the connections between such progress and other topics of traditional statistical physics. The main theme of the review is to show diverse emergent properties of the laboratory markets, originating from self-organization due to the nonlinear interactions among heterogeneous humans or agents (complexity).\n\nFocus on Statistical Physics Modeling in Economics and Finance\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nMantegna, Rosario N.; KertÃ©sz, JÃ¡nos\n\n2011-02-01\n\nThis focus issue presents a collection of papers on recent results in statistical physics modeling in economics and finance, commonly known as econophysics. We touch briefly on the history of this relatively new multi-disciplinary field, summarize the motivations behind its emergence and try to characterize its specific features. We point out some research aspects that must be improved and briefly discuss the topics the research field is moving toward. Finally, we give a short account of the papers collected in this issue.\n\nTen years after \"Worrying trends in econophysics\": developments and current challenges\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nOrmerod, Paul\n\n2016-12-01\n\nEconophysics has made a number of important additions to scientific knowledge. Yet it continues to lack influence with both economists and policy makers. Ten years ago, I and three other economists sympathetic to econophysics wrote a paper on worrying trends within the discipline. For example, its lack of awareness of the economics literature, and shortfalls in the use of statistical analysis. These continue to be obstacles to wider acceptance by economists. Like all agents, policy makers respond to incentives, and economists understand this very well. Much of the econophysics community appears to think that simply doing good science is sufficient to have the work recognised, rather than relating to the motivations and incentives of policy makers. Nevertheless, econophysics now has three major opportunities to advance knowledge in areas where policy makers perceive weaknesses in what they are presented with by economists. All can benefit from the analysis of Big Data. The first is a core model of agent behaviour which is more relevant to cyber society than the rational agent model of economics. Second, extending our understanding of the business cycle, primarily by incorporating the importance of networks into models. Third, devising proper measures of output in cyber society.\n\nCan there be a physics of financial markets? Methodological reflections on econophysics\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nHuber, Tobias A.; Sornette, Didier\n\n2016-12-01\n\nWe address the question whether there can be a physical science of financial markets. In particular, we examine the argument that, given the reflexivity of financial markets (i.e., the feedback mechanism between expectations and prices), there is a fundamental difference between social and physical systems, which demands a new scientific method. By providing a selective history of the mutual cross-fertilization between physics and economics, we reflect on the methodological differences of how models and theories get constructed in these fields. We argue that the novel conception of financial markets as complex adaptive systems is one of the most important contributions of econophysics and show that this field of research provides the methods, concepts, and tools to scientifically account for reflexivity. We conclude by arguing that a new science of economic and financial systems should not only be physics-based, but needs to integrate findings from other scientific fields, so that a truly multi-disciplinary complex systems science of financial markets can be built.\n\nEconophysics: from Game Theory and Information Theory to Quantum Mechanics\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nJimenez, Edward; Moya, Douglas\n\n2005-03-01\n\nRationality is the universal invariant among human behavior, universe physical laws and ordered and complex biological systems. Econophysics isboth the use of physical concepts in Finance and Economics, and the use of Information Economics in Physics. In special, we will show that it is possible to obtain the Quantum Mechanics principles using Information and Game Theory.\n\nComplex Physical, Biophysical and Econophysical Systems\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nDewar, Robert L.; Detering, Frank\n\n1.

Strong claims have been made by some advocates regarding its reputed superiority to economics, with arguments that in fact the teaching of microeconomics and macroeconomics as they are currently constituted should cease and be replaced by appropriate courses in mathematics, physics, and some other harder sciences. The lack of invariance principles in economics and the failure of economists to deal properly with certain empirical regularities are held against it in this line of argument. Responding arguments address four points: (a) that many econophysicists lack awareness of what has been done in economics and thus sometimes claim a greater degree of originality and innovativeness in their work than is deserved, (b) that econophysicists do not use as sufficiently rigorous or sophisticated statistical methodology as econometricians, (c) that econophysicists search for universal empirical regularities in economics that probably do not exist, and (d) that the theoretical models they adduce to explain empirical phenomena have many difficulties and limits. This article examines the arguments and concludes that nonlinear dynamics and entropy concepts may provide a productive way forward.\n\nInternational finance, LÃ©vy distributions, and the econophysics of exchange rates\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nDa Silva, Sergio; Matsushita, Raul; Gleria, Iram; Figueiredo, Annibal; Rathie, Pushpa\n\n2005-06-01\n\nThis paper surveys the developments in the field of international finance, in particular the research of economists on foreign exchange rates. That might be of interest to physicists working on the econophysics of exchange rates. We show how the econophysics agenda might follow naturally from the economists' research. We also present our own work on the econophysics of exchange rates.\n\nEconophysics and individual choice\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nBordley, Robert F.\n\n2005-08-01\n\nThe subjectivist theory of probability specifies certain axioms of rationality which together lead to both a theory of probability and a theory of preference. The theory of probability is used throughout the sciences while the theory of preferences is used in economics. Results in quantum physics challenge the adequacy of the subjectivist theory of probability. As we show, answering this challenge requires modifying an Archimedean axiom in the subjectivist theory. But changing this axiom modifies the subjectivist theory of preference and therefore has implications for economics. As this paper notes, these implications are consistent with current empirical findings in psychology and economics. As we show, these results also have implications for pricing in securities markets. This suggests further directions for research in econophysics.\n\nEconophysics: A challenge to econometricians\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nZapart, Christopher A.\n\n2015-02-01\n\nThe study contrasts mainstream economics-operating on time scales of hours and days-with behavioural finance, econophysics and high-frequency trading, more applicable to short-term time scales of the order of minutes and seconds. We show how the central theoretical assumption underpinning prevailing economic theories is violated on small time scales. We also demonstrate how an alternative behavioural econophysics can model reactions of market participants to short-term movements in foreign exchange markets and, in a direct contradiction of the orthodox economics, design a rudimentary IsingFX automated trading system. By replacing costly human forex dealers with banks of Field-Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) devices that implement in hardware high-frequency behavioural trading models of the type described here, brokerages and forex liquidity providers can expect to gain significant reductions in operating costs.\n\nA mini-review on econophysics: Comparative study of Chinese and western financial markets\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nZheng, Bo; Jiang, Xiong-Fei; Ni, Peng-Yun\n\n2014-07-01\n\nWe present a review of our recent research in econophysics, and focus on the comparative study of Chinese and western financial markets. By virtue of concepts and methods in statistical physics, we investigate the time correlations and spatial structure of financial markets based on empirical high-frequency data. We discover that the Chinese stock market shares common basic properties with the western stock markets, such as the fat-tail probability distribution of price returns, the long-range auto-correlation of volatilities, and the persistence probability of volatilities, while it exhibits very different higher-order time correlations of price returns and volatilities, spatial correlations of individual stock prices, and large-fluctuation dynamic behaviors. Furthermore, multi-agent-based models are developed to simulate the microscopic interaction and dynamic evolution of the stock markets.\n\nEconophysical visualization of Adam Smithâs invisible hand\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nCohen, Morrel H.; Eliazar, Iddo I.\n\n2013-02-01\n\nConsider a complex system whose macrostate is statistically observable, but yet whose operating mechanism is an unknown black-box. In this paper we address the problem of inferring, from the systemâs macrostate statistics, the systemâs intrinsic force yielding the observed statistics. The inference is established via two diametrically opposite approaches which result in the very same intrinsic force: a top-down approach based on the notion of entropy, and a bottom-up approach based on the notion of Langevin dynamics. The general results established are applied to the problem of visualizing the intrinsic socioeconomic force-Adam Smithâs invisible hand-shaping the distribution of wealth in human societies. Our analysis yields quantitative econophysical representations of figurative socioeconomic forces, quantitative definitions of âpoorâ and ârichâ, and a quantitative characterization of the âpoor-get-poorerâ and the ârich-get-richerâ phenomena.\n\nRandom Matrix Theory and Econophysics\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nRosenow, Bernd\n\n2000-03-01\n\nRandom Matrix Theory (RMT) [1] is used in many branches of physics as a ``zero information hypothesis''. It describes generic behavior of different classes of systems, while deviations from its universal predictions allow to identify system specific properties. We use methods of RMT to analyze the cross-correlation matrix C of stock price changes [2] of the largest 1000 US companies. In addition to its scientific interest, the study of correlations between the returns of different stocks is also of practical relevance in quantifying the risk of a given stock portfolio. We find [3,4] that the statistics of most of the eigenvalues of the spectrum of C agree with the predictions of RMT, while there are deviations for some of the largest eigenvalues. We interpret these deviations as a system specific property, e.g. containing genuine information about correlations in the stock market. We demonstrate that C shares universal properties with the Gaussian orthogonal ensemble of random matrices. Furthermore, we analyze the eigenvectors of C through their inverse participation ratio and find eigenvectors with large ratios at both edges of the eigenvalue spectrum - a situation reminiscent of localization theory results.

Now, new meetings are revealing new research opportunities outside the established pathways traditionally explored within economics and finance. In December 2001, around 100 researchers from across the world attended the EPS meeting âApplications of Physics to Financial Analysisâ (APFA3). This was held in the Museum of London Conference Centre which was chosen for its proximity to the City of London and its trading centres. The meeting was especially useful in bringing together roughly equal numbers of physicists, mathematicians and financial practitioners. Taking part in the conference we had the impression that, whilst the relation between physics and applied finance may still be at an early stage, it is evolving very quickly. As in nature, a sign of evolution is the emergence of different and specialised branches, each w ith their own specific character. Papers covered a range of topics, including: market modelling, risk management, agent-based modelling, hedging in incomplete markets, benchmarking, performance measurement, foreign exchange markets, time series analysis and prediction, efficient market hypothesis, equilibrium and non-equilibrium markets, economic a nd financial networks, the valuation of derivatives, growth and bankruptcy. The meeting was sponsored by the European Physical Society and the UK Institute of Physics. The invited speakers were J.Ph. Bouchaud, J.F. Muzy, K. Sneppen, G. Iori and S. Solomon. Articles outlining some of the more interesting advances in this fie ld have been selected by the Guest Editors, from amongst the submitted articles, and after having been refereed, they are presented here in this edition of EPJ B.

The CRD database's weakness is anonymity. Going forward, therefore, it appears the CRD Association is faced with questions concerning how it will enhance the attractiveness of its database whether new knowledge should be gained by using econophysics or other research approaches. We have already seen several examples of knowledge gained through econophysical analyses using the CRD database, and I would like to express my hope that we will eventually see greater application of the SME credit information database and econophysical analysis for the development of Japans SME policies which are scientific economic policies for avoiding moral hazard, and will expect elucidating risk scenarios for the global financial, natural disaster, and other shocks expected to happen with greater frequency. Therefore, the role played by econophysics will become increasingly important, and we have high expectations for the role to be played by the field of econophysics.\n\nA social discounting model based on Tsallisâ statistics\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nTakahashi, Taiki\n\n2010-09-01\n\nSocial decision making (e.g. social discounting and social preferences) has been attracting attention in economics, econophysics, social physics, behavioral psychology, and neuroeconomics. This paper proposes a novel social discounting model based on the deformed algebra developed in the Tsallisâ non-extensive thermostatistics. Furthermore, it is suggested that this model can be utilized to quantify the degree of consistency in social discounting in humans and analyze the relationships between behavioral tendencies in social discounting and other-regarding economic decision making under game-theoretic conditions. Future directions in the application of the model to studies in econophysics, neuroeconomics, and social physics, as well as real-world problems such as the supply of live organ donations, are discussed.\n\nQuantifying fluctuations in economic systems by adapting methods of statistical physics\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nStanley, H. E.; Gopikrishnan, P.; Plerou, V.; Amaral, L. A. N.\n\n2000-12-01\n\nThe emerging subfield of econophysics explores the degree to which certain concepts and methods from statistical physics can be appropriately modified and adapted to provide new insights into questions that have been the focus of interest in the economics community. Here we give a brief overview of two examples of research topics that are receiving recent attention. A first topic is the characterization of the dynamics of stock price fluctuations. For example, we investigate the relation between trading activity - measured by the number of transactions NÎ t - and the price change GÎ t for a given stock, over a time interval [t, t+ Ît] . We relate the time-dependent standard deviation of price fluctuations - volatility - to two microscopic quantities: the number of transactions NÎ t in Î t and the variance WÎ t2 of the price changes for all transactions in Î t. Our work indicates that while the pronounced tails in the distribution of price fluctuations arise from WÎ t, the long-range correlations found in â£ GÎ tâ£ are largely due to NÎ t. We also investigate the relation between price fluctuations and the number of shares QÎ t traded in Î t. We find that the distribution of QÎ t is consistent with a stable LÃ©vy distribution, suggesting a LÃ©vy scaling relationship between QÎ t and NÎ t, which would provide one explanation for volume-volatility co-movement. A second topic concerns cross-correlations between the price fluctuations of different stocks. We adapt a conceptual framework, random matrix theory (RMT), first used in physics to interpret statistical properties of nuclear energy spectra. RMT makes predictions for the statistical properties of matrices that are universal, that is, do not depend on the interactions between the elements comprising the system. In physics systems, deviations from the predictions of RMT provide clues regarding the mechanisms controlling the dynamics of a given system, so this framework can be of potential value if\n\nA natural value unitâEconophysics as arbiter between finance and economics\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nDefilla, Steivan\n\n2007-08-01\n\nForeign exchange markets show that currency units ( = accounting or nominal price units) are variables. Technical and economic progress evidences that the consumer baskets ( = purchasing power units or real price units) are also variables. In contrast, all physical measurement units are constants and either defined in the SI (=metric) convention or based upon natural constants ( = ânaturalâ or Planck units). Econophysics can identify a constant natural value scale or value unit (natural numeraire) based upon Planck energy. In honor of the economist L. Walras, this âPlanck valueâ could be called Walras (Wal), thereby using the SI naming convention. One Wal can be shown to have a physiological and an economic interpretation in that it is equal to the annual minimal real cost of physiological life of a reference person at minimal activity. The price of one Wal in terms of any currency can be estimated by hedonic regression techniques used in inflation measurement (axiometry). This pilot research uses official disaggregated Swiss Producer and Consumer Price Index (PPI and CPI) data and estimates the hedonic Walras price (HWP), quoted in Swiss francs in 2003, and its inverse, the physical purchasing power (PhPP) of the Swiss franc in 2003.\n\nEcono-Physics Models & Metaphors\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nJackson, Peter M.\n\n\"There is really nothing more pathetic than to have an economist or a retired engineer try to force analogies between the concepts of physics and the concepts of engineers. How many dreary papers have I had to referee in which the author is looking for something that corresponds to entropy or to one or another form of energy?\" (Samuelson, 1972, p.254).\n\nLapse of time effects on tax evasion in an agent-based econophysics model\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nSeibold, GÃ¶tz; Pickhardt, Michael\n\n2013-05-01\n\nWe investigate an inhomogeneous Ising model in the context of tax evasion dynamics where different types of agents are parameterized via local temperatures and magnetic fields. In particular, we analyze the impact of lapse of time effects (i.e. backauditing) and endogenously determined penalty rates on tax compliance. Both features contribute to a microfoundation of agent-based econophysics models of tax evasion.\n\nStatistical Physics of Adaptation\n\nDTIC Science & Technology\n\n2016-08-23\n\nStatistical Physics of Adaptation Nikolay Perunov, Robert A.

Barkley, Jr.\n\n2009-10-01\n\nThis Colloquium reviews statistical models for money, wealth, and income distributions developed in the econophysics literature since the late 1990s. By analogy with the Boltzmann-Gibbs distribution of energy in physics, it is shown that the probability distribution of money is exponential for certain classes of models with interacting economic agents. Alternative scenarios are also reviewed. Data analysis of the empirical distributions of wealth and income reveals a two-class distribution. The majority of the population belongs to the lower class, characterized by the exponential (âthermalâ) distribution, whereas a small fraction of the population in the upper class is characterized by the power-law (âsuperthermalâ) distribution. The lower part is very stable, stationary in time, whereas the upper part is highly dynamical and out of equilibrium.\n\nDisorder generated by interacting neural networks: application to econophysics and cryptography\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nKinzel, Wolfgang; Kanter, Ido\n\n2003-10-01\n\nWhen neural networks are trained on their own output signals they generate disordered time series. In particular, when two neural networks are trained on their mutual output they can synchronize; they relax to a time-dependent state with identical synaptic weights. Two applications of this phenomenon are discussed for (a) econophysics and (b) cryptography. (a) When agents competing in a closed market (minority game) are using neural networks to make their decisions, the total system relaxes to a state of good performance. (b) Two partners communicating over a public channel can find a common secret key.\n\nRecent progress in econophysics: Chaos, leverage, and business cycles as revealed by agent-based modeling and human experiments\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nXin, Chen; Huang, Ji-Ping\n\n2017-12-01\n\nAgent-based modeling and controlled human experiments serve as two fundamental research methods in the field of econophysics. Agent-based modeling has been in development for over 20 years, but how to design virtual agents with high levels of human-like \"intelligence\" remains a challenge. On the other hand, experimental econophysics is an emerging field; however, there is a lack of experience and paradigms related to the field. Here, we review some of the most recent research results obtained through the use of these two methods concerning financial problems such as chaos, leverage, and business cycles. We also review the principles behind assessments of agents' intelligence levels, and some relevant designs for human experiments. The main theme of this review is to show that by combining theory, agent-based modeling, and controlled human experiments, one can garner more reliable and credible results on account of a better verification of theory; accordingly, this way, a wider range of economic and financial problems and phenomena can be studied.\n\nRace, gender and the econophysics of income distribution in the USA\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nShaikh, Anwar; Papanikolaou, Nikolaos; Wiener, Noe\n\n2014-12-01\n\nThe econophysics âtwo-classâ theory of Yakovenko and his co-authors shows that the distribution of labor incomes is roughly exponential. This paper extends this result to US subgroups categorized by gender and race. It is well known that Males have higher average incomes than Females, and Whites have higher average incomes than African-Americans. It is also evident that social policies can affect these income gaps. Our surprising finding is that nonetheless intra-group distributions of pre-tax labor incomes are remarkably similar and remain close to exponential. This suggests that income inequality can be usefully addressed by taxation policies, and overall income inequality can be modified by also shifting the balance between labor and property incomes.\n\nAgent-Based Models in Social Physics\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nQuang, Le Anh; Jung, Nam; Cho, Eun Sung; Choi, Jae Han; Lee, Jae Woo\n\n2018-06-01\n\nWe review the agent-based models (ABM) on social physics including econophysics. The ABM consists of agent, system space, and external environment. The agent is autonomous and decides his/her behavior by interacting with the neighbors or the external environment with the rules of behavior. Agents are irrational because they have only limited information when they make decisions. They adapt using learning from past memories. Agents have various attributes and are heterogeneous. ABM is a non-equilibrium complex system that exhibits various emergence phenomena. The social complexity ABM describes human behavioral characteristics. In ABMs of econophysics, we introduce the Sugarscape model and the artificial market models. We review minority games and majority games in ABMs of game theory. Social flow ABM introduces crowding, evacuation, traffic congestion, and pedestrian dynamics. We also review ABM for opinion dynamics and voter model. We discuss features and advantages and disadvantages of Netlogo, Repast, Swarm, and Mason, which are representative platforms for implementing ABM.\n\nEconomic Fluctuations and Statistical Physics: Quantifying Extremely Rare and Much Less Rare Events\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nStanley, H. Eugene\n\n2008-03-01\n\nRecent analysis of truly huge quantities of empirical data suggests that classic economic theories not only fail for a few outliers, but that there occur similar outliers of every possible size. In fact, if one analyzes only a small data set (say 10^4 data points), then outliers appear to occur as ``rare events.'' However, when we analyze orders of magnitude more data (10^8 data points!), we find orders of magnitude more outliers---so ignoring them is not a responsible option, and studying their properties becomes a realistic goal. We find that the statistical properties of these ``outliers'' are identical to the statistical properties of everyday fluctuations. For example, a histogram giving the number of fluctuations of a given magnitude x for fluctuations ranging in magnitude from everyday fluctuations to extremely rare fluctuations that occur with a probability of only 10-8 is a perfect straight line in a double-log plot. Quantitative analogies between financial fluctuations and earthquakes will be discussed. Two unifying principles that underlie much of the finance analysis we will present are scale invariance and universality [R. N. Mantegna and H. E. Stanley, Introduction to Econophysics: Correlations & Complexity in Finance/ (Cambridge U. Press, 2000)]. Scale invariance is a property not about algebraic equations but rather about functional equations, which have as their solutions not numbers but rather functional forms. The key idea of universality is that the identical set of laws hold across diverse markets, and over diverse time periods. This work was carried out in collaboration with a number of students and colleagues, chief among whom are X. Gabaix (MIT and Princeton) and V. Plerou (Boston University).\n\nStatistical physics of the symmetric group.\n\nPubMed\n\nWilliams, Mobolaji\n\n2017-04-01\n\nOrdered chains (such as chains of amino acids) are ubiquitous in biological cells, and these chains perform specific functions contingent on the sequence of their components. Using the existence and general properties of such sequences as a theoretical motivation, we study the statistical physics of systems whose state space is defined by the possible permutations of an ordered list, i.e., the symmetric group, and whose energy is a function of how certain permutations deviate from some chosen correct ordering. Such a nonfactorizable state space is quite different from the state spaces typically considered in statistical physics systems and consequently has novel behavior in systems with interacting and even noninteracting Hamiltonians. Various parameter choices of a mean-field model reveal the system to contain five different physical regimes defined by two transition temperatures, a triple point, and a quadruple point. Finally, we conclude by discussing how the general analysis can be extended to state spaces with more complex combinatorial properties and to other standard questions of statistical mechanics models.\n\nStatistical physics of the symmetric group\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nWilliams, Mobolaji\n\n2017-04-01\n\nOrdered chains (such as chains of amino acids) are ubiquitous in biological cells, and these chains perform specific functions contingent on the sequence of their components.

The analyses of irreversibility are important not only in the design and development of the industrial devices, but also in fundamental thermodynamics and in the socio-economic analysis of municipality. Consequently, the link between entropy and exergy is discussed in order to link econophysics to the bio-chemical engineering thermodynamics. Last, this link holds to the fundamental role of fluxes and to the exergy exchanged in the interaction between the system and its environment. The result consists in a thermodynamic approach to the analysis of the unavailability of the economic, productive or social systems. The unavailability is what the system cannot use in relation to its internal processes. This quantity result is interesting also as a support to public manager for economic decisions. Here, the Alessandria Municipality is analyzed in order to highlight the application of the theoretical results.\n\nEquilibrium econophysics: A unified formalism for neoclassical economics and equilibrium thermodynamics\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nSousa, TÃ¢nia; Domingos, Tiago\n\n2006-11-01\n\nWe develop a unified conceptual and mathematical structure for equilibrium econophysics, i.e., the use of concepts and tools of equilibrium thermodynamics in neoclassical microeconomics and vice versa. Within this conceptual structure the results obtained in microeconomic theory are: (1) the definition of irreversibility in economic behavior; (2) the clarification that the Engel curve and the offer curve are not descriptions of real processes dictated by the maximization of utility at constant endowment; (3) the derivation of a relation between elasticities proving that economic elasticities are not all independent; (4) the proof that Giffen goods do not exist in a stable equilibrium; (5) the derivation that âeconomic integrabilityâ is equivalent to the generalized Le Chatelier principle and (6) the definition of a first order phase transition, i.e., a transition between separate points in the utility function. In thermodynamics the results obtained are: (1) a relation between the non-dimensional isothermal and adiabatic compressibilities and the increase or decrease in the thermodynamic potentials; (2) the distinction between mathematical integrability and optimization behavior and (3) the generalization of the Clapeyron equation.\n\nThe contribution of statistical physics to evolutionary biology.\n\nPubMed\n\nde Vladar, Harold P; Barton, Nicholas H\n\n2011-08-01\n\nEvolutionary biology shares many concepts with statistical physics: both deal with populations, whether of molecules or organisms, and both seek to simplify evolution in very many dimensions. Often, methodologies have undergone parallel and independent development, as with stochastic methods in population genetics. Here, we discuss aspects of population genetics that have embraced methods from physics: non-equilibrium statistical mechanics, travelling waves and Monte-Carlo methods, among others, have been used to study polygenic evolution, rates of adaptation and range expansions. These applications indicate that evolutionary biology can further benefit from interactions with other areas of statistical physics; for example, by following the distribution of paths taken by a population through time.

One reason for the lack of experiments is the impracticality of tracking of individual atoms and molecules within a substance. Thus, there is a need for a different kind of experimental system, one where individual particles not only move stochastically as they collide with one another, but also are large enough to allow tracking. A dusty plasma can meet this need. A dusty plasma is a partially ionized gas containing small particles of solid matter. These micron-size particles gain thousands of electronic charges by collecting more electrons than ions. Their motions are dominated by Coulomb collisions with neighboring particles. In this so-called strongly coupled plasma, the dust particles self-organize in much the same way as atoms in a liquid or solid. Unlike atoms, however, these particles are large and slow, so that they can be tracked easily by video microscopy. Advantages of dusty plasma for experimental statistical physics research include particle tracking, lack of frictional contact with solid surfaces, and avoidance of overdamped motion. Moreover, the motion of a collection of dust particles can mimic an equilibrium system with a Maxwellian velocity distribution, even though the dust particles themselves are not truly in thermal equilibrium. Nonequilibrium statistical physics can be studied by applying gradients, for example by imposing a shear flow. In this talk I will review some of our recent experiments with shear flow. First, we performed the first experimental test to verify the Fluctuation Theorem for a shear flow, showing that brief violations of the Second Law of Thermodynamics occur with the predicted probabilities, for a small system. Second, we discovered a skewness of a shear-stress distribution in a shear flow. This skewness is a phenomenon that likely has wide applicability in nonequilibrium steady states\n\nWhat physicists should know about finance\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nSchmidt, Anatoly B.\n\n2005-05-01\n\nThere has been growing interest in Econophysics, i.e. analysis and modeling of financial time series using the theoretical Physics concepts (scaling, fractals, chaos). Besides the scientific stimuli, this interest is backed by perception that the financial industry is a viable alternative for those physicists who are not able or are not willing to pursue an academic career. However, the times when any Ph.D. in Physics had a chance to find a job on the Wall Street are gone (if they ever existed). Indeed, not every physicist wields the stochastic calculus, non-normal statistical distributions, and the methods of time series analysis. Moreover, now that many universities offer courses in mathematical finance, the applicants for quantitative positions in finance are expected to know such concepts as option pricing, portfolio management, and risk measurement. Here I describe a synthetic course based on my book [1] that outlines both worlds: Econophysics and Mathematical Finance. The course may be offered as elective for senior undergraduate or graduate Physics majors.\n\nStatistical physics of vaccination\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nWang, Zhen; Bauch, Chris T.; Bhattacharyya, Samit; d'Onofrio, Alberto; Manfredi, Piero; Perc, MatjaÅ¾; Perra, Nicola; SalathÃ©, Marcel; Zhao, Dawei\n\n2016-12-01\n\nHistorically, infectious diseases caused considerable damage to human societies, and they continue to do so today. To help reduce their impact, mathematical models of disease transmission have been studied to help understand disease dynamics and inform prevention strategies. Vaccination-one of the most important preventive measures of modern times-is of great interest both theoretically and empirically. And in contrast to traditional approaches, recent research increasingly explores the pivotal implications of individual behavior and heterogeneous contact patterns in populations. Our report reviews the developmental arc of theoretical epidemiology with emphasis on vaccination, as it led from classical models assuming homogeneously mixing (mean-field) populations and ignoring human behavior, to recent models that account for behavioral feedback and/or population spatial/social structure. Many of the methods used originated in statistical physics, such as lattice and network models, and their associated analytical frameworks. Similarly, the feedback loop between vaccinating behavior and disease propagation forms a coupled nonlinear system with analogs in physics. We also review the new paradigm of digital epidemiology, wherein sources of digital data such as online social media are mined for high-resolution information on epidemiologically relevant individual behavior. Armed with the tools and concepts of statistical physics, and further assisted by new sources of digital data, models that capture nonlinear interactions between behavior and disease dynamics offer a novel way of modeling real-world phenomena, and can help improve health outcomes. We conclude the review by discussing open problems in the field and promising directions for future research.\n\nStatistical physics of human cooperation\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nPerc, MatjaÅ¾; Jordan, Jillian J.; Rand, David G.; Wang, Zhen; Boccaletti, Stefano; Szolnoki, Attila\n\n2017-05-01\n\nExtensive cooperation among unrelated individuals is unique to humans, who often sacrifice personal benefits for the common good and work together to achieve what they are unable to execute alone. The evolutionary success of our species is indeed due, to a large degree, to our unparalleled other-regarding abilities. Yet, a comprehensive understanding of human cooperation remains a formidable challenge. Recent research in the social sciences indicates that it is important to focus on the collective behavior that emerges as the result of the interactions among individuals, groups, and even societies. Non-equilibrium statistical physics, in particular Monte Carlo methods and the theory of collective behavior of interacting particles near phase transition points, has proven to be very valuable for understanding counterintuitive evolutionary outcomes. By treating models of human cooperation as classical spin models, a physicist can draw on familiar settings from statistical physics. However, unlike pairwise interactions among particles that typically govern solid-state physics systems, interactions among humans often involve group interactions, and they also involve a larger number of possible states even for the most simplified description of reality. The complexity of solutions therefore often surpasses that observed in physical systems. Here we review experimental and theoretical research that advances our understanding of human cooperation, focusing on spatial pattern formation, on the spatiotemporal dynamics of observed solutions, and on self-organization that may either promote or hinder socially favorable states.\n\nNetworkingâa statistical physics perspective\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nYeung, Chi Ho; Saad, David\n\n2013-03-01\n\nNetworking encompasses a variety of tasks related to the communication of information on networks; it has a substantial economic and societal impact on a broad range of areas including transportation systems, wired and wireless communications and a range of Internet applications. As transportation and communication networks become increasingly more complex, the ever increasing demand for congestion control, higher traffic capacity, quality of service, robustness and reduced energy consumption requires new tools and methods to meet these conflicting requirements. The new methodology should serve for gaining better understanding of the properties of networking systems at the macroscopic level, as well as for the development of new principled optimization and management algorithms at the microscopic level. Methods of statistical physics seem best placed to provide new approaches as they have been developed specifically to deal with nonlinear large-scale systems. This review aims at presenting an overview of tools and methods that have been developed within the statistical physics community and that can be readily applied to address the emerging problems in networking. These include diffusion processes, methods from disordered systems and polymer physics, probabilistic inference, which have direct relevance to network routing, file and frequency distribution, the exploration of network structures and vulnerability, and various other practical networking applications.\n\nWhat can we learn from noise? - Mesoscopic nonequilibrium statistical physics.\n\nPubMed\n\nKobayashi, Kensuke\n\n2016-01-01\n\nMesoscopic systems - small electric circuits working in quantum regime - offer us a unique experimental stage to explorer quantum transport in a tunable and precise way. The purpose of this Review is to show how they can contribute to statistical physics. We introduce the significance of fluctuation, or equivalently noise, as noise measurement enables us to address the fundamental aspects of a physical system. The significance of the fluctuation theorem (FT) in statistical physics is noted. We explain what information can be deduced from the current noise measurement in mesoscopic systems. As an important application of the noise measurement to statistical physics, we describe our experimental work on the current and current noise in an electron interferometer, which is the first experimental test of FT in quantum regime. Our attempt will shed new light in the research field of mesoscopic quantum statistical physics.\n\nEconomics and econophysics in the era of Big Data\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nCheong, Siew Ann\n\n2016-12-01\n\nThere is an undeniable disconnect between theory-heavy economics and the real world, and some cross polination of ideas with econophysics, which is more balanced between data and models, might help economics along the way to become a truly scientific enterprise. With the coming of the era of Big Data, this transformation of economics into a data-driven science is becoming more urgent. In this article, I use the story of Kepler's discovery of his three laws of planetary motion to enlarge the framework of the scientific approach, from one that focuses on experimental sciences, to one that accommodates observational sciences, and further to one that embraces data mining and machine learning. I distinguish between the ontological values of Kepler's Laws vis-a-vis Newton's Laws, and argue that the latter is more fundamental because it is able to explain the former. I then argue that the fundamental laws of economics lie not in mathematical equations, but in models of adaptive economic agents. With this shift in mind set, it becomes possible to think about how interactions between agents can lead to the emergence of multiple stable states and critical transitions, and complex adaptive policies and regulations that might actually work in the real world. Finally, I discuss how Big Data, exploratory agent-based modeling, and predictive agent-based modeling can come together in a unified framework to make economics a true science.\n\nPREFACE: Statistical Physics of Complex Fluids\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nGolestanian, R.; Khajehpour, M. R. H.; Kolahchi, M. R.; Rouhani, S.\n\n2005-04-01\n\nThe field of complex fluids is a rapidly developing, highly interdisciplinary field that brings together people from a plethora of backgrounds such as mechanical engineering, chemical engineering, materials science, applied mathematics, physics, chemistry and biology. In this melting pot of science, the traditional boundaries of various scientific disciplines have been set aside. It is this very property of the field that has guaranteed its richness and prosperity since the final decade of the 20th century and into the 21st. The C3 Commission of the International Union of Pure and Applied Physics (IUPAP), which is the commission for statistical physics that organizes the international STATPHYS conferences, encourages various, more focused, satellite meetings to complement the main event. For the STATPHYS22 conference in Bangalore (July 2004), Iran was recognized by the STATPHYS22 organizers as suitable to host such a satellite meeting and the Institute for Advanced Studies in Basic Sciences (IASBS) was chosen to be the site of this meeting. It was decided to organize a meeting in the field of complex fluids, which is a fairly developed field in Iran. This international meeting, and an accompanying summer school, were intended to boost international connections for both the research groups working in Iran, and several other groups working in the Middle East, South Asia and North Africa. The meeting, entitled `Statistical Physics of Complex Fluids' was held at the Institute for Advanced Studies in Basic Sciences (IASBS) in Zanjan, Iran, from 27 June to 1 July 2004. The main topics discussed at the meeting included: biological statistical physics, wetting and microfluidics, transport in complex media, soft and granular matter, and rheology of complex fluids. At this meeting, 22 invited lectures by eminent scientists were attended by 107 participants from different countries. The poster session consisted of 45 presentations which, in addition to the main topics of the\n\nA description of Seismicity based on Non-extensive Statistical Physics: An introduction to Non-extensive Statistical Seismology.\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nVallianatos, Filippos\n\n2015-04-01\n\nDespite the extreme complexity that characterizes earthquake generation process, simple phenomenology seems to apply in the collective properties of seismicity. The best known is the Gutenberg-Richter relation. Short and long-term clustering, power-law scaling and scale-invariance have been exhibited in the spatio-temporal evolution of seismicity providing evidence for earthquakes as a nonlinear dynamic process. Regarding the physics of \"many\" earthquakes and how this can be derived from first principles, one may wonder, how can the collective properties of a set formed by all earthquakes in a given region, be derived and how does the structure of seismicity depend on its elementary constituents - the earthquakes? What are these properties? The physics of many earthquakes has to be studied with a different approach than the physics of one earthquake making the use of statistical physics necessary to understand the collective properties of earthquakes. Then a natural question arises. What type of statistical physics is appropriate to commonly describe effects from the microscale and crack opening level to the level of large earthquakes? An answer to the previous question could be non-extensive statistical physics, introduced by Tsallis (1988), as the appropriate methodological tool to describe entities with (multi) fractal distributions of their elements and where long-range interactions or intermittency are important, as in fracturing phenomena and earthquakes. In the present work, we review some fundamental properties of earthquake physics and how these are derived by means of non-extensive statistical physics. The aim is to understand aspects of the underlying physics that lead to the evolution of the earthquake phenomenon introducing the new topic of non-extensive statistical seismology. This research has been funded by the European Union (European Social Fund) and Greek national resources under the framework of the \"THALES Program: SEISMO FEAR HELLARC\" project\n\nStatistical physics of human beings in games: Controlled experiments\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nLiang, Yuan; Huang, Ji-Ping\n\n2014-07-01\n\nIt is important to know whether the laws or phenomena in statistical physics for natural systems with non-adaptive agents still hold for social human systems with adaptive agents, because this implies whether it is possible to study or understand social human systems by using statistical physics originating from natural systems. For this purpose, we review the role of human adaptability in four kinds of specific human behaviors, namely, normal behavior, herd behavior, contrarian behavior, and hedge behavior. The approach is based on controlled experiments in the framework of market-directed resource-allocation games. The role of the controlled experiments could be at least two-fold: adopting the real human decision-making process so that the system under consideration could reflect the performance of genuine human beings; making it possible to obtain macroscopic physical properties of a human system by tuning a particular factor of the system, thus directly revealing cause and effect. As a result, both computer simulations and theoretical analyses help to show a few counterparts of some laws or phenomena in statistical physics for social human systems: two-phase phenomena or phase transitions, entropy-related phenomena, and a non-equilibrium steady state. This review highlights the role of human adaptability in these counterparts, and makes it possible to study or understand some particular social human systems by means of statistical physics coming from natural systems.\n\nStatistical Physics for Adaptive Distributed Control\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nWolpert, David H.\n\n2005-01-01\n\nA viewgraph presentation on statistical physics for distributed adaptive control is shown.

The present study investigated how concurrent physical exercise affects performance of incidental and intentional learning of overlapping auditory streams, and whether physical fitness modulates the performances of learning. Participants were grouped with 11 participants with lower and higher fitness each, based on their Vo 2 max value. They were presented simultaneous auditory sequences with a distinct statistical regularity each other (i.e. statistical learning), while they were pedaling on the bike and seating on a bike at rest. In experiment 1, they were instructed to attend to one of the two sequences and ignore to the other sequence. In experiment 2, they were instructed to attend to both of the two sequences. After exposure to the sequences, learning effects were evaluated by familiarity test. In the experiment 1, performance of statistical learning of ignored sequences during concurrent pedaling could be higher in the participants with high than low physical fitness, whereas in attended sequence, there was no significant difference in performance of statistical learning between high than low physical fitness. Furthermore, there was no significant effect of physical fitness on learning while resting. In the experiment 2, the both participants with high and low physical fitness could perform intentional statistical learning of two simultaneous sequences in the both exercise and rest sessions. The improvement in physical fitness might facilitate incidental but not intentional statistical learning of simultaneous auditory sequences during concurrent physical exercise.\n\nCombining Statistics and Physics to Improve Climate Downscaling\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nGutmann, E. D.; Eidhammer, T.; Arnold, J.; Nowak, K.; Clark, M. P.\n\n2017-12-01\n\nGetting useful information from climate models is an ongoing problem that has plagued climate science and hydrologic prediction for decades. While it is possible to develop statistical corrections for climate models that mimic current climate almost perfectly, this does not necessarily guarantee that future changes are portrayed correctly. In contrast, convection permitting regional climate models (RCMs) have begun to provide an excellent representation of the regional climate system purely from first principles, providing greater confidence in their change signal. However, the computational cost of such RCMs prohibits the generation of ensembles of simulations or long time periods, thus limiting their applicability for hydrologic applications. Here we discuss a new approach combining statistical corrections with physical relationships for a modest computational cost. We have developed the Intermediate Complexity Atmospheric Research model (ICAR) to provide a climate and weather downscaling option that is based primarily on physics for a fraction of the computational requirements of a traditional regional climate model. ICAR also enables the incorporation of statistical adjustments directly within the model. We demonstrate that applying even simple corrections to precipitation while the model is running can improve the simulation of land atmosphere feedbacks in ICAR. For example, by incorporating statistical corrections earlier in the modeling chain, we permit the model physics to better represent the effect of mountain snowpack on air temperature changes.\n\nFinancial physics\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nFeigenbaum, James\n\n2003-10-01\n\nIn this introduction to the burgeoning field of econophysics, we review the application of self-organized criticality to economics, the Cont-Bouchaud percolation model, multiple-strategy agent-based models of financial markets, the minority game, and log-periodic precursors to financial crashes.\n\nStatistical physics of hard combinatorial optimization: Vertex cover problem\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nZhao, Jin-Hua; Zhou, Hai-Jun\n\n2014-07-01\n\nTypical-case computation complexity is a research topic at the boundary of computer science, applied mathematics, and statistical physics. In the last twenty years, the replica-symmetry-breaking mean field theory of spin glasses and the associated message-passing algorithms have greatly deepened our understanding of typical-case computation complexity. In this paper, we use the vertex cover problem, a basic nondeterministic-polynomial (NP)-complete combinatorial optimization problem of wide application, as an example to introduce the statistical physical methods and algorithms. We do not go into the technical details but emphasize mainly the intuitive physical meanings of the message-passing equations. A nonfamiliar reader shall be able to understand to a large extent the physics behind the mean field approaches and to adjust the mean field methods in solving other optimization problems.\n\nEmperical Laws in Economics Uncovered Using Methods in Statistical Mechanics\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nStanley, H. Eugene\n\n2001-06-01\n\nIn recent years, statistical physicists and computational physicists have determined that physical systems which consist of a large number of interacting particles obey universal \"scaling laws\" that serve to demonstrate an intrinsic self-similarity operating in such systems. Further, the parameters appearing in these scaling laws appear to be largely independent of the microscopic details. Since economic systems also consist of a large number of interacting units, it is plausible that scaling theory can be usefully applied to economics. To test this possibility using realistic data sets, a number of scientists have begun analyzing economic data using methods of statistical physics [1]. We have found evidence for scaling (and data collapse), as well as universality, in various quantities, and these recent results will be reviewed in this talk--starting with the most recent study [2]. We also propose models that may lead to some insight into these phenomena. These results will be discussed, as well as the overall rationale for why one might expect scaling principles to hold for complex economic systems. This work on which this talk is based is supported by BP, and was carried out in collaboration with L. A. N. Amaral S. V. Buldyrev, D. Canning, P. Cizeau, X. Gabaix, P. Gopikrishnan, S. Havlin, Y.

Therefore, vehicular traffic, modeled as a system of interacting âparticlesâ driven far from equilibrium, offers the possibility to study various fundamental aspects of truly nonequilibrium systems which are of current interest in statistical physics. Analytical as well as numerical techniques of statistical physics are being used to study these models to understand rich variety of physical phenomena exhibited by vehicular traffic. Some of these phenomena, observed in vehicular traffic under different circumstances, include transitions from one dynamical phase to another, criticality and self-organized criticality, metastability and hysteresis, phase-segregation, etc. In this critical review, written from the perspective of statistical physics, we explain the guiding principles behind all the main theoretical approaches. But we present detailed discussions on the results obtained mainly from the so-called âparticle-hoppingâ models, particularly emphasizing those which have been formulated in recent years using the language of cellular automata.\n\nPEOPLE IN PHYSICS: Nobel prize winners in physics from 1901 to 1990: simple statistics for physics teachers\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nZhang, Weijia; Fuller, Robert G.\n\n1998-05-01\n\nA demographic database for the 139 Nobel prize winners in physics from 1901 to 1990 has been created from a variety of sources.

The purpose of this Review is to show how they can contribute to statistical physics. We introduce the significance of fluctuation, or equivalently noise, as noise measurement enables us to address the fundamental aspects of a physical system. The significance of the fluctuation theorem (FT) in statistical physics is noted. We explain what information can be deduced from the current noise measurement in mesoscopic systems. As an important application of the noise measurement to statistical physics, we describe our experimental work on the current and current noise in an electron interferometer, which is the first experimental test of FT in quantum regime. Our attempt will shed new light in the research field of mesoscopic quantum statistical physics.

Such specific properties suggest that markets operate at a very special point. Financial markets are believed to be critical by analogy to physical systems, but little statistically founded evidence has been given. Through a data-based methodology and comparison to simulations inspired by the statistical physics of complex systems, we show that the Dow Jones and index sets are not rigorously critical. However, financial systems are closer to criticality in the crash neighborhood.\n\nInformation theory applied to econophysics: stock market behaviors\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nVogel, Eugenio E.; Saravia, Gonzalo\n\n2014-08-01\n\nThe use of data compressor techniques has allowed to recognize magnetic transitions and their associated critical temperatures [E.E. Vogel, G. Saravia, V. Cortez, Physica A 391, 1591 (2012)]. In the present paper we introduce some new concepts associated to data recognition and extend the use of these techniques to econophysics to explore the variations of stock market indicators showing that information theory can help to recognize different regimes. Modifications and further developments to previously introduced data compressor wlzip are introduced yielding two measurements. Additionally, we introduce an algorithm that allows to tune the number of significant digits over which the data compression is due to act complementing, this with an appropriate method to round off the truncation. The application is done to IPSA, the main indicator of the Chilean Stock Market during the year 2010 due to availability of quality data and also to consider a rare effect: the earthquake of the 27th of February on that year which is as of now the sixth strongest earthquake ever recorded by instruments (8.8 Richter scale) according to United States Geological Survey. Along the year 2010 different regimes are recognized. Calm days show larger compression than agitated days allowing for classification and recognition. Then the focus turns onto selected days showing that it is possible to recognize different regimes with the data of the last hour (60 entries) allowing to determine actions in a safer way. The \"day of the week\" effect is weakly present but \"the hour of the day\" effect is clearly present; its causes and implications are discussed. This effect also establishes the influence of Asian, European and American stock markets over the smaller Chilean Stock Market. Then dynamical studies are conducted intended to search a system that can help to realize in real time about sudden variations of the market; it is found that information theory can be really helpful in this respect.\n\nThe Practicality of Statistical Physics Handout Based on KKNI and the Constructivist Approach\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nSari, S. Y.; Afrizon, R.\n\n2018-04-01\n\nStatistical physics lecture shows that: 1) the performance of lecturers, social climate, studentsâ competence and soft skills needed at work are in enough category, 2) students feel difficulties in following the lectures of statistical physics because it is abstract, 3) 40.72% of students needs more understanding in the form of repetition, practice questions and structured tasks, and 4) the depth of statistical physics material needs to be improved gradually and structured. This indicates that learning materials in accordance of The Indonesian National Qualification Framework or Kerangka Kualifikasi Nasional Indonesia (KKNI) with the appropriate learning approach are needed to help lecturers and students in lectures. The author has designed statistical physics handouts which have very valid criteria (90.89%) according to expert judgment. In addition, the practical level of handouts designed also needs to be considered in order to be easy to use, interesting and efficient in lectures. The purpose of this research is to know the practical level of statistical physics handout based on KKNI and a constructivist approach. This research is a part of research and development with 4-D model developed by Thiagarajan. This research activity has reached part of development test at Development stage. Data collection took place by using a questionnaire distributed to lecturers and students. Data analysis using descriptive data analysis techniques in the form of percentage. The analysis of the questionnaire shows that the handout of statistical physics has very practical criteria. The conclusion of this study is statistical physics handouts based on the KKNI and constructivist approach have been practically used in lectures.\n\nPhysics Teachers and Students: A Statistical and Historical Analysis of Women\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nGregory, Amanda\n\n2009-10-01\n\nHistorically, women have been denied an education comparable to that available to men.

Physical therapists demonstrate limited skills and report low self-efficacy for interpreting results of statistical procedures. While standards for physical therapist education include statistics, little empirical evidence is available to inform what should constitute such curricula. The purpose of this study was to conduct a census of the statistical terms and study designs used in physical therapy literature and to use the results to make recommendations for curricular development in physical therapist education. We conducted a bibliometric analysis of 14 peer-reviewed journals associated with the American Physical Therapy Association over 12 months (Oct 2011-Sept 2012). Trained raters recorded every statistical term appearing in identified systematic reviews, primary research reports, and case series and case reports. Investigator-reported study design was also recorded. Terms representing the same statistical test or concept were combined into a single, representative term. Cumulative percentage was used to identify the most common representative statistical terms. Common representative terms were organized into eight categories to inform curricular design. Of 485 articles reviewed, 391 met the inclusion criteria. These 391 articles used 532 different terms which were combined into 321 representative terms; 13.1 (sdâ=â8.0) terms per article. Eighty-one representative terms constituted 90% of all representative term occurrences. Of the remaining 240 representative terms, 105 (44%) were used in only one article. The most common study design was prospective cohort (32.5%). Physical therapy literature contains a large number of statistical terms and concepts for readers to navigate. However, in the year sampled, 81 representative terms accounted for 90% of all occurrences.

We demonstrate that statistical physics inspired energy-efficient (EE) signal constellation designs, in combination with large-girth low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes, significantly outperform conventional LDPC-coded polarization-division multiplexed quadrature amplitude modulation schemes. We also describe an EE signal constellation design algorithm. Finally, we propose the discrete-time implementation of D-dimensional transceiver and corresponding EE polarization-division multiplexed system.

When time progresses, the first process results in a decreasing failure rate, while the second process associated with the material aging and degradation leads to an increased failure rate. An attempt has been made in this analysis to assess the level of the reliability physics-related aging process from the available bathtub curve (diagram). It is assumed that the products of interest underwent the burn-in testing and therefore the obtained bathtub curve does not contain the infant mortality portion. It has been also assumed that the two random processes in question are statistically independent, and that the failure rate of the physical process can be obtained by deducting the theoretically assessed statistical failure rate from the bathtub curve ordinates. In the carried out numerical example, the Raleigh distribution for the statistical failure rate was used, for the sake of a relatively simple illustration. The developed methodology can be used in reliability physics evaluations, when there is a need to better understand the roles of the statistics-related and reliability-physics-related irreversible random processes in reliability evaluations. The future work should include investigations on how powerful and flexible methods and approaches of the statistical mechanics can be effectively employed, in addition to reliability physics techniques, to model the operational reliability of electronic and photonic products.\n\nEquilibrium statistical-thermal models in high-energy physics\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nTawfik, Abdel Nasser\n\n2014-05-01\n\nWe review some recent highlights from the applications of statistical-thermal models to different experimental measurements and lattice QCD thermodynamics that have been made during the last decade. We start with a short review of the historical milestones on the path of constructing statistical-thermal models for heavy-ion physics. We discovered that Heinz Koppe formulated in 1948, an almost complete recipe for the statistical-thermal models. In 1950, Enrico Fermi generalized this statistical approach, in which he started with a general cross-section formula and inserted into it, the simplifying assumptions about the matrix element of the interaction process that likely reflects many features of the high-energy reactions dominated by density in the phase space of final states. In 1964, Hagedorn systematically analyzed the high-energy phenomena using all tools of statistical physics and introduced the concept of limiting temperature based on the statistical bootstrap model. It turns to be quite often that many-particle systems can be studied with the help of statistical-thermal methods. The analysis of yield multiplicities in high-energy collisions gives an overwhelming evidence for the chemical equilibrium in the final state. The strange particles might be an exception, as they are suppressed at lower beam energies. However, their relative yields fulfill statistical equilibrium, as well. We review the equilibrium statistical-thermal models for particle production, fluctuations and collective flow in heavy-ion experiments. We also review their reproduction of the lattice QCD thermodynamics at vanishing and finite chemical potential. During the last decade, five conditions have been suggested to describe the universal behavior of the chemical freeze-out parameters. The higher order moments of multiplicity have been discussed. They offer deep insights about particle production and to critical fluctuations. Therefore, we use them to describe the freeze-out parameters\n\nStatistical physics of crime: a review.\n\nPubMed\n\nD'Orsogna, Maria R; Perc, MatjaÅ¾\n\n2015-03-01\n\nContaining the spread of crime in urban societies remains a major challenge. Empirical evidence suggests that, if left unchecked, crimes may be recurrent and proliferate. On the other hand, eradicating a culture of crime may be difficult, especially under extreme social circumstances that impair the creation of a shared sense of social responsibility. Although our understanding of the mechanisms that drive the emergence and diffusion of crime is still incomplete, recent research highlights applied mathematics and methods of statistical physics as valuable theoretical resources that may help us better understand criminal activity. We review different approaches aimed at modeling and improving our understanding of crime, focusing on the nucleation of crime hotspots using partial differential equations, self-exciting point process and agent-based modeling, adversarial evolutionary games, and the network science behind the formation of gangs and large-scale organized crime. We emphasize that statistical physics of crime can relevantly inform the design of successful crime prevention strategies, as well as improve the accuracy of expectations about how different policing interventions should impact malicious human activity that deviates from social norms. We also outline possible directions for future research, related to the effects of social and coevolving networks and to the hierarchical growth of criminal structures due to self-organization.
