We propose a minimal microscopic model of the financial market economy based on the real economy's symmetry constraint and minimality requirement. We solve the proposed model analytically in the mean-field regime, which shows that various kinds of universal power-law-like behaviors in the financial market may depend on one another, just like the critical exponents in physics. We then discuss the parameters in the proposed model and we show that each parameter in our model can be related to measurable quantities in the real market, which enables us to discuss the cause of a few kinds of social and economic phenomena.",
