This document provides an overview of econophysics, which applies methods from statistical physics to study economic problems. It discusses how physicists have developed simple kinetic exchange models to study income and wealth distributions based on principles from statistical mechanics. While these approaches have drawbacks and criticisms, the authors believe they have yielded promising results and insights. The goal is to highlight positive contributions from econophysics and encourage further interdisciplinary work to strengthen the field.",
