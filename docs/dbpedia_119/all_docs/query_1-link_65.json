        "text": "I'm studying physics engineering, and I would like to make a degree in Applied physics, but next to that step I would like to study Econophysics or something related to that area. I really like the area of computacional computing and economics so, I think it is going to be so good to try to propose some models using some of the math and physical intuition that one learns while we are in University.\n\nDo you know if this is a serious part of the physics? Or is it to new area to know so much about it?\n\nThanks for your advise!\n\nI don't really understand what that would entail. Economics is the study of financial exchanges between humans. I suppose you could try modeling economic systems using known physical systems and see what results you get -- that may be of some interest. I'm not sure I would necessarily classify that as a branch of physics per-se, because you're using the physics as an analogy. There is no underlying physical system to economics.\n\nDewgale said:\n\nI don't really understand what that would entail. Economics is the study of financial exchanges between humans.

It's applying tools derived from physical systems on economic systems, which seems to me to be far less physics, and far more economics. Just because a physicist is approaching a problem using tools they got from physics, doesn't make the subject area necessarily physics. If I successfully applied statistical mechanical tools to election predictions, I wouldn't consider that some new branch of physics called \"Politiphysics\"."
