C.; Ochiai, T.\n\n2012-09-01\n\nThe search for stylized facts (i.e., simplified empirical facts) is of capital importance in econophysics because the stylized facts constitute the experimental empirical body on which theories and models should be tested. At the moment they are too few and this is an important limitation to the progress in the field. In this work, we unveil a new stylized fact, which consists of resistance effect and breaking-acceleration effect that implicitly requires a long memory feature in price movement. By analyzing a vast amount of historical data, we demonstrate that the financial market tends to exceed a past (historical) extreme price less often than expected by a classic short-memory model (e.g., Black-Scholes model). We call it resistance effect. However, when the market does it, we predict that the average volatility at that time point will be much higher (accelerates more). It means, in average, volatility accelerates more when the price breaks the highest (lowest) value. We refer to this as breaking-acceleration effect. These observed empirical facts are actually an effect which may arise from technical trading and psychological effects. Taken together, these results indicate that, beyond the predictive capability of this unveiled stylized fact, traditional short-memory models do not faithfully capture the market dynamics.\n\nStylized facts in social networks: Community-based static modeling\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nJo, Hang-Hyun; Murase, Yohsuke; TÃ¶rÃ¶k, JÃ¡nos; KertÃ©sz, JÃ¡nos; Kaski, Kimmo\n\n2018-06-01\n\nThe past analyses of datasets of social networks have enabled us to make empirical findings of a number of aspects of human society, which are commonly featured as stylized facts of social networks, such as broad distributions of network quantities, existence of communities, assortative mixing, and intensity-topology correlations. Since the understanding of the structure of these complex social networks is far from complete, for deeper insight into human society more comprehensive datasets and modeling of the stylized facts are needed. Although the existing dynamical and static models can generate some stylized facts, here we take an alternative approach by devising a community-based static model with heterogeneous community sizes and larger communities having smaller link density and weight. With these few assumptions we are able to generate realistic social networks that show most stylized facts for a wide range of parameters, as demonstrated numerically and analytically. Since our community-based static model is simple to implement and easily scalable, it can be used as a reference system, benchmark, or testbed for further applications.\n\nEU AND GLOBALIZATION: SOME STYLIZED FACTS\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nScamuffa Domenico\n\n2009-05-01\n\nFull Text Available Most of the people all over the world claim that globalization is a result of dynamic interactions between economic, technological, social and political factors. The aim of this paper is to document some stylized facts on this phenomenon in order to take\n\nAn agent-based approach to financial stylized facts\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nShimokawa, Tetsuya; Suzuki, Kyoko; Misawa, Tadanobu\n\n2007-06-01\n\nAn important challenge of the financial theory in recent years is to construct more sophisticated models which have consistencies with as many financial stylized facts that cannot be explained by traditional models. Recently, psychological studies on decision making under uncertainty which originate in Kahneman and Tversky's research attract a lot of interest as key factors which figure out the financial stylized facts. These psychological results have been applied to the theory of investor's decision making and financial equilibrium modeling. This paper, following these behavioral financial studies, would like to propose an agent-based equilibrium model with prospect theoretical features of investors. Our goal is to point out a possibility that loss-averse feature of investors explains vast number of financial stylized facts and plays a crucial role in price formations of financial markets. Price process which is endogenously generated through our model has consistencies with, not only the equity premium puzzle and the volatility puzzle, but great kurtosis, asymmetry of return distribution, auto-correlation of return volatility, cross-correlation between return volatility and trading volume. Moreover, by using agent-based simulations, the paper also provides a rigorous explanation from the viewpoint of a lack of market liquidity to the size effect, which means that small-sized stocks enjoy excess returns compared to large-sized stocks.\n\nImpact of global financial crisis on stylized facts between energy markets and stock markets\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nLeng, Tan Kim; Cheong, Chin Wen; Hooi, Tan Siow\n\n2014-06-01\n\nUnderstanding the stylized facts is extremely important and has becomes a hot issue nowadays. However, recent global financial crisis that started from United States had spread all over the world and adversely affected the commodities and financial sectors of both developed and developing countries. This paper tends to examine the impact of crisis on stylized facts between energy and stock markets using ARCH-family models based on the experience over 2008 global financial crisis. Empirical results denote that there is long lasting, persists and positively significant the autocorrelation function of absolute returns and their squares in both markets for before and during crisis. Besides that, leverage effects are found in stock markets whereby bad news has a greater impact on volatility than good news for both before and during crisis. However, crisis does not indicate any impact on risk-return tradeoff for both energy and stock markets. For forecasting evaluations, GARCH model and FIAPARCH model indicate superior out of sample forecasts for before and during crisis respectively.\n\nFinancial Stylized Facts in the Word of Mouth Model\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nMisawa, Tadanobu; Watanabe, Kyoko; Shimokawa, Tetsuya\n\nRecently, we proposed an agent-based model called the word of mouth model to analyze the influence of an information transmission process to price formation in financial markets. Especially, the short-term predictability of asset return was focused on and an explanation in the view of information transmission was provided to the question why the predictability was much clearly observed in the small-sized stocks. This paper, to extend the previous study, demonstrates that the word of mouth model also has a consistency with other important financial stylized facts. This strengthens the possibility that the information transmission among investors plays a crucial role in price formation. Concretely, this paper addresses two famous statistical features of returns; the leptokurtic distribution of return and the autocorrelation of return volatility. The reasons why these statistical facts receive especial attentions of researchers among financial stylized facts are their statistical robustness and practical importance, such as the applications to the derivative pricing problems.\n\nMartingales, the Efficient Market Hypothesis, and Spurious Stylized Facts\n\nOpenAIRE\n\nMcCauley, Joseph L.; Bassler, Kevin E.; Gunaratne, Gemunu H.\n\n2007-01-01\n\nThe condition for stationary increments, not scaling, detemines long time pair autocorrelations. An incorrect assumption of stationary increments generates spurious stylized facts, fat tails and a Hurst exponent H_s=1/2, when the increments are nonstationary, as they are in FX markets. The nonstationarity arises from systematic uneveness in noise traders' behavior. Spurious results arise mathematically from using a log increment with a 'sliding window'. We explain why a hard to beat market de...\n\nBridging stylized facts in finance and data non-stationarities\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nCamargo, Sabrina; Duarte QueirÃ³s, SÃ­lvio M.; Anteneodo, Celia\n\n2013-04-01\n\nEmploying a recent technique which allows the representation of nonstationary data by means of a juxtaposition of locally stationary paths of different length, we introduce a comprehensive analysis of the key observables in a financial market: the trading volume and the price fluctuations. From the segmentation procedure we are able to introduce a quantitative description of statistical features of these two quantities, which are often named stylized facts, namely the tails of the distribution of trading volume and price fluctuations and a dynamics compatible with the U-shaped profile of the volume in a trading section and the slow decay of the autocorrelation function. The segmentation of the trading volume series provides evidence of slow evolution of the fluctuating parameters of each patch, pointing to the mixing scenario. Assuming that long-term features are the outcome of a statistical mixture of simple local forms, we test and compare different probability density functions to provide the long-term distribution of the trading volume, concluding that the log-normal gives the best agreement with the empirical distribution. Moreover, the segmentation of the magnitude price fluctuations are quite different from the results for the trading volume, indicating that changes in the statistics of price fluctuations occur at a faster scale than in the case of trading volume.\n\nThe impact of a financial transaction tax on stylized facts of price returns-Evidence from the lab.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nHuber, JÃ¼rgen; Kleinlercher, Daniel; Kirchler, Michael\n\n2012-08-01\n\nAs the introduction of financial transaction taxes is increasingly discussed by political leaders we explore possible consequences such taxes could have on markets. Here we examine how \"stylized facts\", namely fat tails and volatility clustering, are affected by different tax regimes in laboratory experiments. We find that leptokurtosis of price returns is highest and clustered volatility is weakest in unilaterally taxed markets (where tax havens exist). Instead, tails are slimmest and volatility clustering is strongest in tax havens. When an encompassing financial transaction tax is levied, stylized facts hardly change compared to a scenario with no tax on all markets.\n\nModeling the stylized facts in finance through simple nonlinear adaptive systems\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nHommes, Cars H.\n\n2002-01-01\n\nRecent work on adaptive systems for modeling financial markets is discussed. Financial markets are viewed as evolutionary systems between different, competing trading strategies. Agents are boundedly rational in the sense that they tend to follow strategies that have performed well, according to realized profits or accumulated wealth, in the recent past. Simple technical trading rules may survive evolutionary competition in a heterogeneous world where prices and beliefs co-evolve over time. Evolutionary models can explain important stylized facts, such as fat tails, clustered volatility, and long memory, of real financial series.

We find relevant differences across countries in the effects of non-systematic fiscal policy, and substantial uncertainty about the size of these effects, which casts dou...\n\nStylized facts in internal rates of return on stock index and its derivative transactions\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nPichl, LukÃ¡Å¡; Kaizoji, Taisei; Yamano, Takuya\n\n2007-08-01\n\nUniversal features in stock markets and their derivative markets are studied by means of probability distributions in internal rates of return on buy and sell transaction pairs. Unlike the stylized facts in normalized log returns, the probability distributions for such single asset encounters incorporate the time factor by means of the internal rate of return, defined as the continuous compound interest. Resulting stylized facts are shown in the probability distributions derived from the daily series of TOPIX, S & P 500 and FTSE 100 index close values. The application of the above analysis to minute-tick data of NIKKEI 225 and its futures market, respectively, reveals an interesting difference in the behavior of the two probability distributions, in case a threshold on the minimal duration of the long position is imposed. It is therefore suggested that the probability distributions of the internal rates of return could be used for causality mining between the underlying and derivative stock markets. The highly specific discrete spectrum, which results from noise trader strategies as opposed to the smooth distributions observed for fundamentalist strategies in single encounter transactions may be useful in deducing the type of investment strategy from trading revenues of small portfolio investors.\n\nThe impact of a financial transaction tax on stylized facts of price returnsâEvidence from the lab\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nHuber, JÃ¼rgen; Kleinlercher, Daniel; Kirchler, Michael\n\n2012-01-01\n\nAs the introduction of financial transaction taxes is increasingly discussed by political leaders we explore possible consequences such taxes could have on markets.

However, the properties of price gaps have not been thoroughly studied due to the less availability of ultrahigh frequency data. In the paper, we rebuild the LOB dynamics based on the order flow data of 26 A-share stocks traded on the Shenzhen Stock Exchange in 2003. Three key empirical statistical properties of price gaps are investigated. We find that the distribution of price gaps has a power-law tail for all stocks with an average tail exponent close to 3.2. Applying modern statistical methods, we confirm that the gap time series are long-range correlated and possess multifractal nature. These three features appear to be different in the measures across stocks, but they are similar for the buy and sell LOBs within each stock. Furthermore, we also unveil buyâsell asymmetry phenomena in the properties of price gaps on the buy and sell sides of the LOBs for individual stocks. These findings deepen our understanding of the dynamics of liquidity of common stocks and can be used to calibrate agent-based computational financial models.\n\nDevelopment and foreign debt: The stylized facts 1970-2006\n\nDEFF Research Database (Denmark)\n\nPaldam, Martin\n\nthey are in crisis, and the debt grows and generates low growth in the next couple of decades. The analysis concentrates on two relations: (R1) the relation between borrowing and growth, and (R2) the relation between initial debt and growth. Both relations are negative, so essentially the stylized story of debt...\n\nInvestment Strategies Used as Spectroscopy of Financial Markets Reveal New Stylized Facts\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nZhou, Wei-Xing; Mu, Guo-Hua; Chen, Wei; Sornette, Didier\n\n2011-01-01\n\nWe propose a new set of stylized facts quantifying the structure of financial markets. The key idea is to study the combined structure of both investment strategies and prices in order to open a qualitatively new level of understanding of financial and economic markets. We study the detailed order flow on the Shenzhen Stock Exchange of China for the whole year of 2003. This enormous dataset allows us to compare (i) a closed national market (A-shares) with an international market (B-shares), (ii) individuals and institutions, and (iii) real traders to random strategies with respect to timing that share otherwise all other characteristics. We find in general that more trading results in smaller net return due to trading frictions, with the exception that the net return is independent of the trading frequency for A-share individual traders. We unveiled quantitative power laws with non-trivial exponents, that quantify the deterioration of performance with frequency and with holding period of the strategies used by traders. Random strategies are found to perform much better than real ones, both for winners and losers. Surprising large arbitrage opportunities exist, especially when using zero-intelligence strategies. This is a diagnostic of possible inefficiencies of these financial markets.

Employing analytical and numerical tools, we investigate stability conditions as well as bifurcations and possible periodic, quasi-periodic, and chaotic dynamics, enlightening how the degree of market interaction, together with the accelerator parameter and the intervention of the fiscal authority, may affect the business cycle and the course of the financial market. In particular, we show that even if the steady state is locally stable, multistability phenomena can occur, with several and complex dynamic structures coexisting with the steady state. Finally, simulations reveal that the proposed model is able to explain several statistical properties and stylized facts observed in real financial markets, including persistent high volatility, fat-tailed return distributions, volatility clustering, and positive autocorrelation of absolute returns.\n\nThe Globalization of Food Systems: A Conceptual Framework and Empirical Patterns\n\nOpenAIRE\n\nSenauer, Benjamin; Venturini, Luciano\n\n2005-01-01\n\nThis paper discusses a number of stylized facts and empirical patterns regarding agri-food trade flows as well as foreign direct investments in food processing and retailing. This evidence supports the hypothesis of an increasingly global food system. We identify the main factors at work such as push/supply side, pull/demand-side, and enabling/external factors. We show how the shift from national to global retailing is a recent phenomenon whose relevance for the globalization of upstream sect...\n\nEssays on Empirical Asset Pricing\n\nDEFF Research Database (Denmark)\n\nGormsen, Niels Joachim\n\nthat the expected return to the distant-future cash flows increases by more in bad times than the expected return to near-future cash flows does. This new stylized fact is important for understanding why the expected return on the market portfolio as a whole varies over time. In addition, it has strong implications...... for which economic model that drives the return to stocks. Indeed, I find that none of the canonical asset pricing models can explain this new stylized fact while also explaining the previously documented facts about stock returns. The second chapter, called Conditional Risk, studies how the expected return...... on individual stocks is influenced by the fact that their riskiness varies over time. We introduce a new âconditional-risk factorâ, which is a simple method for determining how much of the expected return to individual stocks that can be explained by time variation in their market risk, i.e. market betas.

The key technical contribution lies on the object flow, which is robust to inaccurate optical flow, unknown object transformation and partial occlusion as well. Since object flows relate regions of the same object across frames, shower-door effect can be effectively reduced where painterly strokes and textures are rendered on video objects. The construction of object flows is performed in real time and automatically after applying metric learning. To reduce temporal flickering, we extend the bilateral filtering into motion bilateral filtering. We propose quantitative metrics to measure the temporal coherence on structures and textures of our stylized videos, and perform extensive experiments to compare our stylized results with baseline systems and prior works specializing in watercolor and abstraction.\n\nSTYLIZED FACTS OF ROMANIAN BUSINESS CYCLE. AN EMPIRICAL INVESTIGATION (II\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nMester Ioana\n\n2012-12-01\n\nFull Text Available If the more or less regulate moves of the macroeconomic variables are accepted by the economists as a reality, the problem of measuring the aggregate level of the economy in direct correlation with these fluctuations is much more difficult due to the numerous variables involved. The way these variables move in time is very different from a period to another as well as from a country to another. While some variables have already reached their maximum level, others are on their descendent slope. This is the reason why the measurement problem of the aggregate level of the macroeconomic activity deserves our attention. Finding the patterns macroeconomic variables move together and influence each other is important both as a theoretical challenge, but for its practical utility as well. Depending on the result of the measurement process, the authorities are able to conduct their economic policies. More precisely, the monetary or fiscal authority will act differently if the economy is in recession or in expansion. These are the reasons for which a very important phase in the study of the cycle is its descriptive analysis, which is realized by focusing on certain aspects, such as: the length and magnitude, the correlation of the economic variables with the reference series, the study of the cyclical indicators, the analysis of the relative variability of economic series, the diagnose and prevision based on the cyclical indicators.\n\nVideo Texture Synthesis Based on Flow-Like Stylization Painting\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nQian Wenhua\n\n2014-01-01\n\nFull Text Available The paper presents an NP-video rendering system based on natural phenomena. It provides a simple nonphotorealistic video synthesis system in which user can obtain a flow-like stylization painting and infinite video scene. Firstly, based on anisotropic Kuwahara filtering in conjunction with line integral convolution, the phenomena video scene can be rendered to flow-like stylization painting. Secondly, the methods of frame division, patches synthesis, will be used to synthesize infinite playing video. According to selection examples from different natural video texture, our system can generate stylized of flow-like and infinite video scenes. The visual discontinuities between neighbor frames are decreased, and we also preserve feature and details of frames. This rendering system is easy and simple to implement.\n\nAnalysis of a multigroup stylized CANDU half-core benchmark\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nPounders, Justin M.; Rahnema, Farzad; Serghiuta, Dumitru\n\n2011-01-01\n\nHighlights: â This paper provides a benchmark that is a stylized model problem in more than two energy groups that is realistic with respect to the underlying physics. â An 8-group cross section library is provided to augment a previously published 2-group 3D stylized half-core CANDU benchmark problem. â Reference eigenvalues and selected pin and bundle fission rates are included. â 2-, 4- and 47-group Monte Carlo solutions are compared to analyze homogenization-free transport approximations that result from energy condensation. - Abstract: An 8-group cross section library is provided to augment a previously published 2-group 3D stylized half-core Canadian deuterium uranium (CANDU) reactor benchmark problem. Reference eigenvalues and selected pin and bundle fission rates are also included. This benchmark is intended to provide computational reactor physicists and methods developers with a stylized model problem in more than two energy groups that is realistic with respect to the underlying physics. In addition to transport theory code verification, the 8-group energy structure provides reactor physicist with an ideal problem for examining cross section homogenization and collapsing effects in a full-core environment. To this end, additional 2-, 4- and 47-group full-core Monte Carlo benchmark solutions are compared to analyze homogenization-free transport approximations incurred as a result of energy group condensation.\n\nHigh-frequency volatility combine forecast evaluations: An empirical study for DAX\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nWen Cheong Chin\n\n2017-01-01\n\nFull Text Available This study aims to examine the benefits of combining realized volatility, higher power variation volatility and nearest neighbour truncation volatility in the forecasts of financial stock market of DAX. A structural break heavy-tailed heterogeneous autoregressive model under the heterogeneous market hypothesis specification is employed to capture the stylized facts of high-frequency empirical data. Using selected averaging forecast methods, the forecast weights are assigned based on the simple average, simple median, least squares and mean square error. The empirical results indicated that the combination of forecasts in general shown superiority under four evaluation criteria regardless which proxy is set as the actual volatility. As a conclusion, we summarized that the forecast performance is influenced by three factors namely the types of volatility proxy, forecast methods (individual or averaging forecast and lastly the type of actual forecast value used in the evaluation criteria.\n\nConsumer Decision Process in Restaurant Selection: An Application of the Stylized EKB Model\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nEugenia Wickens\n\n2016-12-01\n\nFull Text Available Purpose â The aim of this paper is to propose a framework based on empirical work for understanding the consumer decision processes involved in the selection of a restaurant for leisure meals. Design/Methodology/Approach â An interpretive approach is taken in order to understand the intricacies of the process and the various stages in the process. Six focus group interviews with consumers of various ages and occupations in the South East of the United Kingdom were conducted. Findings and implications â The stylized EKB model of the consumer decision process (Tuan-Pham & Higgins, 2005 was used as a framework for developing different stages of the process. Two distinct parts of the process were identified. Occasion was found to be critical to the stage of problem recognition. In terms of evaluation of alternatives and, in particular, sensitivity to evaluative content, the research indicates that the regulatory focus theory of Tuan-Pham and Higgins (2005 applies to the decision of selecting a restaurant. Limitations â It is acknowledged that this exploratory study is based on a small sample in a single geographical area. Originality â The paper is the first application of the stylized EKB model, which takes into account the motivational dimensions of consumer decision making, missing in other models. It concludes that it may have broader applications to other research contexts.\n\nThe humorous stylization of \"new\" women and men and conservative others\n\nOpenAIRE\n\nKotthoff, Helga\n\n2007-01-01\n\nIn this article I will discuss how a circle of middle-aged academics recreates its moral order of new gender standards by a consonant staging of the \"others\" and the \"self\" â \"them\" vs. \"us\".

We examined cancer patients' self-monitoring preferences and practices, focusing on the meaning of self-monitoring within the cancer experience. Semi-structured interviews were conducted among adult cancer patients who had been seen at least once at a rural United States cancer center. Questions sought out the meaning of self-monitoring and its practical aspects. Qualitative data were analyzed by adapting the four-stepped method by Giorgi for empirical phenomenological analysis. Twenty participants were interviewed (11 women and 9 men). Transcribed interviews revealed that cancer patient self-monitoring is self-stylized work that ranges from simple to complex, while being both idiosyncratic and routine. Participants reported using tools with systems for use that fit their distinctive lives for the purpose of understanding and using information they deemed to be important in their cancer care. Three conceptual categories were discerned from the data that help to elucidate this self-stylized work as fitting their individual priorities and preferences, reflecting their identities, and being born of their work lives. Findings highlight patients' unique self-monitoring preferences and practices, calling into question the assumption that the sole use of standardized tools are the most effective approach to engaging patients in this practice. Self-monitoring efforts can be validated when providers welcome or adapt to patients' self-stylized tools and systems. Doing so may present opportunity for improved communications and patient-centered care.\n\nThe Impact of Educational Interventions on Real & Stylized Cities\n\nNational Research Council Canada - National Science Library\n\nHirshman, Brian R; Birukou, Alaiksandr; Martin, Michael K; Bigrigg, Michael W; Carley, Kathleen M\n\n2008-01-01\n\n..., and a variety of other factors.

Radiation transport models of human anatomy provide a convenient method for simulating radiological examinations. At present, two classes of models exist: stylized mathematical models and tomographic voxel models. In the present study, organ dose comparisons are made for projection radiographs of both a stylized and a tomographic model of the newborn patient. Sixteen separate radiographs were simulated for each model at x-ray technique factors typical of newborn examinations: chest, abdomen, thorax and head views in the AP, PA, left LAT and right LAT projection orientation. For AP and PA radiographs of the torso (chest, abdomen and thorax views), the effective dose assessed for the tomographic model exceeds that for the stylized model with per cent differences ranging from 19% (AP abdominal view) to 43% AP chest view. In contrast, the effective dose for the stylized model exceeds that for the tomographic model for all eight lateral views including those of the head, with per cent differences ranging from 9% (LLAT chest view) to 51% (RLAT thorax view). While organ positioning differences do exist between the models, a major factor contributing to differences in effective dose is the models' exterior trunk shape. In the tomographic model, a more elliptical shape is seen thus providing for less tissue shielding for internal organs in the AP and PA directions, with corresponding increased tissue shielding in the lateral directions. This observation is opposite of that seen in comparisons of stylized and tomographic models of the adult\n\nOn the need to revise the arm structure in stylized anthropomorphic phantoms in lateral photon irradiation geometry\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nLee, Choonsik; Lee, Choonik; Lee, Jai-Ki\n\n2006-01-01\n\nDistributions of radiation absorbed dose within human anatomy have been estimated through Monte Carlo radiation transport techniques implemented for two different classes of computational anthropomorphic phantoms: (1) mathematical equation-based stylized phantoms and (2) tomographic image-based voxel phantoms. Voxel phantoms constructed from tomographic images of real human anatomy have been actively developed since the late 1980s to overcome the anatomical approximations necessary with stylized phantoms, which themselves have been utilized since the mid 1960s. However, revisions of stylized phantoms have also been pursued in parallel to the development of voxel phantoms since voxel phantoms (1) are initially restricted to the individual-specific anatomy of the person originally imaged, (2) must be restructured on an organ-by-organ basis to conform to reference individual anatomy and (3) cannot easily represent very fine anatomical structures and tissue layers that are thinner than the voxel dimensions of the overall phantom. Although efforts have been made to improve the anatomic realism of stylized phantoms, most of these efforts have been limited to attempts to alter internal organ structures. Aside from the internal organs, the exterior shapes, and especially the arm structures, of stylized phantoms are also far from realistic descriptions of human anatomy, and may cause dosimetry errors in the calculation of organ-absorbed doses for external irradiation scenarios. The present study was intended to highlight the need to revise the existing arm structure within stylized phantoms by comparing organ doses of stylized adult phantoms with those from three adult voxel phantoms in the lateral photon irradiation geometry. The representative stylized phantom, the adult phantom of the Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) series and two adult male voxel phantoms, KTMAN-2 and VOXTISS8, were employed for Monte Carlo dose calculation, and data from another voxel phantom, VIP\n\nAn Exploration of the Gendered Stylization of the Body in Caryl Churchillâs Cloud Nine\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nAbdol Hossein Joodaki\n\n2013-11-01\n\nFull Text Available What has been undertaken in the present study is the exploration of Caryl Churchillâs selected drama Cloud Nine(1978 with an eye to Judith Butlerâs theorizations in regard to âgender performativityâ.Â According to Judith Butler, gender identity is a socio-political construction that achieves legitimacy and naturality via perpetual observation, repetition and âa stylized repetition of actsâ. This stylized repetition of acts along with continuous surveillance, observation and correction leads to the construction of gender identity. In Cloud Nine (1978,we witness how Caryl Churchill(1938- , who occupies a lofty position in the world of theater due to her theatrical expertise, realizes Butlerâs conviction and vividly portrays the stylization of gender identity under the sovereignty and hegemony ofÂ phallocentrism and heterosexuality.\n\nNOTE: On the need to revise the arm structure in stylized anthropomorphic phantoms in lateral photon irradiation geometry\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nLee, Choonsik; Lee, Choonik; Lee, Jai-Ki\n\n2006-11-01\n\nDistributions of radiation absorbed dose within human anatomy have been estimated through Monte Carlo radiation transport techniques implemented for two different classes of computational anthropomorphic phantoms: (1) mathematical equation-based stylized phantoms and (2) tomographic image-based voxel phantoms.

This journey typically started with sharp falls in economic activity in all transition countries, accompanied by deterioration of various social indicators. Hence, their main objective was the recovery of economic activity, i.e. increasing the economic growth rate, which in addition was supposed to enable catching up with the European developed economies. This growth movement is usually described by famous U-curve of transition. However, in spite of the efforts and reforms, all transition economies recorded various paces of recovery. This study discusses that difference, through various GDP indicators, - real GDP path, GDP growth rates path, the height of the GDP index achieved and the volatility of growth rates. Analysed in concert, these indicators suggest several other variations of the transition Ucurve, such as: the rapid-J group, the wide-U group and the L-curve group. Namely, almost three decades after the start of the transition, the differences persist, suggesting that some transition economies has not moved significantly towards catching up with the successful transition countries, or with the developed economies.\n\nFirm-Size Wage Gaps along the Formal-Informal Divide: Theory and Evidence\n\nOpenAIRE\n\nBalkan, Binnur; Tumen, Semih\n\n2015-01-01\n\nObservationally equivalent workers are paid higher wages in larger firms. This fact is often named as the âfirm-size wage gapâ and is regarded as a key empirical puzzle. Using micro-level data from Turkey, we document a new stylized fact : the firm-size wage gap is more pronounced for informal (unregistered) jobs than for formal (registered) jobs. To explain this fact, we develop a two-stage wage-posting game with market imperfections and segmented markets, the solution to which produces wage...\n\nRough electricity: a new fractal multi-factor model of electricity spot prices\n\nDEFF Research Database (Denmark)\n\nBennedsen, Mikkel\n\nWe introduce a new mathematical model of electricity spot prices which accounts for the most important stylized facts of these time series: seasonality, spikes, stochastic volatility and mean reversion.

Recent empirical evidence suggests that the multiscale data characteristics in the price movement are another important stylized fact. The incorporation of mixture of data characteristics in the time scale domain during the modelling process can lead to significant performance improvement. This paper proposes a novel morphological component analysis based hybrid methodology for modeling the multiscale heterogeneous characteristics of the price movement in the crude oil markets. Empirical studies in two representative benchmark crude oil markets reveal the existence of multiscale heterogeneous microdata structure. The significant performance improvement of the proposed algorithm incorporating the heterogeneous data characteristics, against benchmark random walk, ARMA, and SVR models, is also attributed to the innovative methodology proposed to incorporate this important stylized fact during the modelling process. Meanwhile, work in this paper offers additional insights into the heterogeneous market microstructure with economic viable interpretations.\n\nA 3D stylized half-core CANDU benchmark problem\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nPounders, Justin M.; Rahnema, Farzad; Serghiuta, Dumitru; Tholammakkil, John\n\n2011-01-01\n\nA 3D stylized half-core Canadian deuterium uranium (CANDU) reactor benchmark problem is presented. The benchmark problem is comprised of a heterogeneous lattice of 37-element natural uranium fuel bundles, heavy water moderated, heavy water cooled, with adjuster rods included as reactivity control devices. Furthermore, a 2-group macroscopic cross section library has been developed for the problem to increase the utility of this benchmark for full-core deterministic transport methods development. Monte Carlo results are presented for the benchmark problem in cooled, checkerboard void, and full coolant void configurations.\n\nHeterogeneous car buyers: a stylized fact\n\nOpenAIRE\n\nAna M. Aizcorbe; Benjamin Bridgman; Jeremy J. Nalewaik\n\n2009-01-01\n\nUsing a new dataset, we document a systematic pattern in the demographic characteristics of car buyers over the model year: as vehicle prices fall over the model year, so do buyer incomes. This pattern is consistent with price-insensitive buyers purchasing early in the year, while others wait until prices decline, and suggests price skimming (i.e. intertemporal price discrimination). Such consumer heterogeneity over the model year raises questions for measuring quality improvements in new goods.\n\n3D Geovisualization & Stylization to Manage Comprehensive and Participative Local Urban Plans\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nBrasebin, M.; Christophe, S.; Jacquinod, F.; Vinesse, A.; Mahon, H.\n\n2016-10-01\n\n3D geo-visualization is more and more used and appreciated to support public participation, and is generally used to present predesigned planned projects. Nevertheless, other participatory processes may benefit from such technology such as the elaboration of urban planning documents. In this article, we present one of the objectives of the PLU++ project: the design of a 3D geo-visualization system that eases the participation concerning local urban plans. Through a pluridisciplinary approach, it aims at covering the different aspects of such a system: the simulation of built configurations to represent regulation information, the efficient stylization of these objects to make people understand their meanings and the interaction between 3D simulation and stylization. The system aims at being adaptive according to the participation context and to the dynamic of the participation. It will offer the possibility to modify simulation results and the rendering styles of the 3D representations to support participation. The proposed 3D rendering styles will be used in a set of practical experiments in order to test and validate some hypothesis from past researches of the project members about 3D simulation, 3D semiotics and knowledge about uses.\n\nSome stylized facts of the Bitcoin market\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nBariviera, Aurelio F.; Basgall, MarÃ­a JosÃ©; HasperuÃ©, Waldo; Naiouf, Marcelo\n\n2017-10-01\n\nIn recent years a new type of tradable assets appeared, generically known as cryptocurrencies. Among them, the most widespread is Bitcoin. Given its novelty, this paper investigates some statistical properties of the Bitcoin market. This study compares Bitcoin and standard currencies dynamics and focuses on the analysis of returns at different time scales. We test the presence of long memory in return time series from 2011 to 2017, using transaction data from one Bitcoin platform. We compute the Hurst exponent by means of the Detrended Fluctuation Analysis method, using a sliding window in order to measure long range dependence. We detect that Hurst exponents changes significantly during the first years of existence of Bitcoin, tending to stabilize in recent times. Additionally, multiscale analysis shows a similar behavior of the Hurst exponent, implying a self-similar process.\n\nPermanence of agricultural afforestation for carbon sequestration under stylized carbon markets in the U.S.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nDavid Haim; Eric White; Ralph J.

This study strikes a compromise between abstract and highly specified ABMs by designing a spatially explicit, stylized ABM and using it to explore policy scenarios in a setting that is facing substantial conservation and development challenges. Specifically, we present an ABM that reflects key Land Use / Land Cover (LULC) dynamics and livelihood decisions on Isabela Island in the GalÃ¡pagos Archipelago of Ecuador. We implement the model using the NetLogo software platform, a free program that requires relatively little programming experience. The landscape is composed of a satellite-derived distribution of a problematic invasive species (common guava) and a stylized representation of the GalÃ¡pagos National Park, the community of Puerto Villamil, the agricultural zone, and the marine area. The agent module is based on publicly available data and household interviews, and represents the primary livelihoods of the population in the GalÃ¡pagos Islands - tourism, fisheries, and agriculture. We use the model to enact hypothetical agricultural subsidy scenarios aimed at controlling invasive guava and assess the resulting population and land cover dynamics. Findings suggest that spatially explicit, stylized ABMs have considerable utility, particularly during preliminary stages of research, as platforms for (1) sharpening conceptualizations of population-environment systems, (2) testing alternative scenarios, and (3) uncovering critical data gaps.\n\nThe long or short of it: Determinants of foreign currency exposure in external balance sheets\n\nOpenAIRE\n\nLANE, PHILIP RICHARD\n\n2009-01-01\n\nRecently, there have been numerous advances in modelling optimal international portfolio allocations in macroeconomic models.

The former utilize 3D surface equations to represent internal organ structure and external body shape, while the latter are based on segmented CT or MR images of a single individual. While tomographic models are clearly more anthropomorphic than stylized models, a given model's characterization as being anthropometric is dependent upon the reference human to which the model is compared. In the present study, data on total body mass, standing/sitting heights and body mass index are collected and reviewed for the US population covering the time interval from 1971 to 2000. These same anthropometric parameters are then assembled for the ORNL series of stylized models, the GSF series of tomographic models (Golem, Helga, Donna, etc), the adult male Zubal tomographic model and the UF newborn tomographic model. The stylized ORNL models of the adult male and female are found to be fairly representative of present-day average US males and females, respectively, in terms of both standing and sitting heights for ages between 20 and 60-80 years. While the ORNL adult male model provides a reasonably close match to the total body mass of the average US 21-year-old male (within â¼5%), present-day 40-year-old males have an average total body mass that is â¼16% higher. For radiation protection purposes, the use of the larger 73.7 kg adult ORNL stylized hermaphrodite model provides a much closer representation of average present-day US females at ages ranging from 20 to 70 years. In terms of the adult tomographic models from the GSF series, only Donna (40-year-old F) closely matches her age-matched US counterpart in terms of average body mass. Regarding standing heights, the better matches to US age-correlated averages belong to Irene (32-year-old F) for the females and Golem (38-year-old M) for the males\n\nSeparating Fact from Fiction: An Empirical Examination of Six Myths About Dissociative Identity Disorder.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nBrand, Bethany L; Sar, Vedat; Stavropoulos, Pam; KrÃ¼ger, Christa; Korzekwa, Marilyn; MartÃ­nez-Taboas, Alfonso; Middleton, Warwick\n\n2016-01-01\n\nDissociative identity disorder (DID) is a complex, posttraumatic, developmental disorder for which we now, after four decades of research, have an authoritative research base, but a number of misconceptualizations and myths about the disorder remain, compromising both patient care and research. This article examines the empirical literature pertaining to recurrently expressed beliefs regarding DID: (1) belief that DID is a fad, (2) belief that DID is primarily diagnosed in North America by DID experts who overdiagnose the disorder, (3) belief that DID is rare, (4) belief that DID is an iatrogenic, rather than trauma-based, disorder, (5) belief that DID is the same entity as borderline personality disorder, and (6) belief that DID treatment is harmful to patients. The absence of research to substantiate these beliefs, as well as the existence of a body of research that refutes them, confirms their mythical status. Clinicians who accept these myths as facts are unlikely to carefully assess for dissociation. Accurate diagnoses are critical for appropriate treatment planning. If DID is not targeted in treatment, it does not appear to resolve. The myths we have highlighted may also impede research about DID. The cost of ignorance about DID is high not only for individual patients but for the whole support system in which they reside. Empirically derived knowledge about DID has replaced outdated myths. Vigorous dissemination of the knowledge base about this complex disorder is warranted.\n\nTwo concepts of empirical ethics.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nParker, Malcolm\n\n2009-05-01\n\nThe turn to empirical ethics answers two calls. The first is for a richer account of morality than that afforded by bioethical principlism, which is cast as excessively abstract and thin on the facts. The second is for the facts in question to be those of human experience and not some other, unworldly realm. Empirical ethics therefore promises a richer naturalistic ethics, but in fulfilling the second call it often fails to heed the metaethical requirements related to the first. Empirical ethics risks losing the normative edge which necessarily characterizes the ethical, by failing to account for the nature and the logic of moral norms. I sketch a naturalistic theory, teleological expressivism (TE), which negotiates the naturalistic fallacy by providing a more satisfactory means of taking into account facts and research data with ethical implications. The examples of informed consent and the euthanasia debate are used to illustrate the superiority of this approach, and the problems consequent on including the facts in the wrong kind of way.\n\nThe Volatility of Long-term Bond Returns: Persistent Interest Shocks and Time-varying Risk Premiums\n\nDEFF Research Database (Denmark)\n\nOsterrieder, Daniela; Schotman, Peter C.\n\nWe develop a model that can match two stylized facts of the term-structure. The first stylized fact is the predictability of excess returns on long-term bonds. Modeling this requires sufficient volatility and persistence in the price of risk. The second stylized fact is that long-term yields...... are dominated by a level factor, which requires persistence in the spot interest rate. We find that a fractionally integrated process for the short rate plus a fractionally integrated specification for the price of risk leads to an analytically tractable almost affine term structure model that can explain...... the stylized facts. In a decomposition of long-term bond returns we find that the expectations component from the level factor is more volatile than the returns themselves. It therefore takes a volatile risk premium that is negatively correlated with innovations in the level factor to explain the volatility...\n\nInflation in Africa, 1960-2015\n\nNARCIS (Netherlands)\n\nPh.H.B.F.

This article examines three different ways in which we could understand 'empirical turn'. Using real facts in normative reasoning is trivial and would not represent a 'turn'. Becoming an empirical discipline through a shift to the social and neurosciences would be a turn away from normative thinking, which we should not take. Conducting empirical research to inform normative reasoning is the usual meaning given to the term 'empirical turn'. In this sense, however, the turn is incomplete. Bioethics has imported methodological tools from empirical disciplines, but too often it has not imported the standards to which researchers in these disciplines are held. Integrating empirical and normative approaches also represents true added difficulties. Addressing these issues from the standpoint of debates on the fact-value distinction can cloud very real methodological concerns by displacing the debate to a level of abstraction where they need not be apparent. Ideally, empirical research in bioethics should meet standards for empirical and normative validity similar to those used in the source disciplines for these methods, and articulate these aspects clearly and appropriately. More modestly, criteria to ensure that none of these standards are completely left aside would improve the quality of empirical bioethics research and partly clear the air of critiques addressing its theoretical justification, when its rigour in the particularly difficult context of interdisciplinarity is what should be at stake.\n\nA Conditional Curie-Weiss Model for Stylized Multi-group Binary Choice with Social Interaction\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nOpoku, Alex Akwasi; Edusei, Kwame Owusu; Ansah, Richard Kwame\n\n2018-04-01\n\nThis paper proposes a conditional Curie-Weiss model as a model for decision making in a stylized society made up of binary decision makers that face a particular dichotomous choice between two options. Following Brock and Durlauf (Discrete choice with social interaction I: theory, 1955), we set-up both socio-economic and statistical mechanical models for the choice problem. We point out when both the socio-economic and statistical mechanical models give rise to the same self-consistent equilibrium mean choice level(s). Phase diagram of the associated statistical mechanical model and its socio-economic implications are discussed.\n\nA rough multi-factor model of electricity spot prices\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nBennedsen, Mikkel\n\n2017-01-01\n\nWe introduce a new continuous-time mathematical model of electricity spot prices which accounts for the most important stylized facts of these time series: seasonality, spikes, stochastic volatility, and mean reversion. Empirical studies have found a possible fifth stylized fact, roughness, and our approach explicitly incorporates this into the model of the prices. Our setup generalizes the popular OrnsteinâUhlenbeck-based multi-factor framework of and allows us to perform statistical tests to distinguish between an OrnsteinâUhlenbeck-based model and a rough model. Further, through the multi-factor approach we account for seasonality and spikes before estimating â and making inference on â the degree of roughness. This is novel in the literature and we present simulation evidence showing that these precautions are crucial for accurate estimation. Lastly, we estimate our model on recent data from six European energy exchanges and find statistical evidence of roughness in five out of six markets. As an application of our model, we show how, in these five markets, a rough component improves short term forecasting of the prices. - Highlights: â¢ Statistical modeling of electricity spot prices â¢ Multi-factor decomposition â¢ Roughness â¢ Electricity price forecasting\n\nAn Investigation into the Effect of Using Geometric and Non-Geometric Shapes on the Desirability of Human Character Stylization in Childrenâs Narrative Fiction Illustration\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nHajar Salimi Namin\n\n2017-12-01\n\nFull Text Available This study aims to investigate the effect of teaching the using of geometric and non-geometric shapes on human character stylization created by undergraduate graphic design students with poor performance in illustration of children's narrative fiction. The research methodology includes an experimental research by pre- and post-testing with test group in the next stage. Statistical population of the study consists of female undergraduate sophomores of graphic design at Faculty of Arts, Al-Zahra University in 2017. The students were first subjected to pretesting, and then the training package was provided to them and they were again subjected to testing. 35 students are selected to conduct the research. The tools used in this study include files, materials in the books, articles and related sites, experiments and appraisal forms. The results show that there is a significant difference between the pre-test and post-test. The independent variable thus creates a significant difference in the test group and is able to improve the human character stylization implemented by undergraduate students of graphic design at the post-test stage. Therefore, it is suggested to employ using of geometric and non-geometric shapes in order to teach human character stylization to the students.\n\nStylized whole-core benchmark of the Integral Inherently Safe Light Water Reactor (I2S-LWR) concept\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nHon, Ryan; Kooreman, Gabriel; Rahnema, Farzad; Petrovic, Bojan\n\n2017-01-01\n\nHighlights: â¢ A stylized benchmark specification of the I2S-LWR core. â¢ A library of cross sections were generated in both 8 and 47 groups. â¢ Monte Carlo solutions generated for the 8 group library using MCNP5. â¢ Cross sections and pin fission densities provided in journalâs repository. - Abstract: The Integral, Inherently Safe Light Water Reactor (I 2 S-LWR) is a pressurized water reactor (PWR) concept under development by a multi-institutional team led by Georgia Tech. The core is similar in size to small 2-loop PWRs while having the power level of current large reactors (â¼1000 MWe) but using uranium silicide fuel and advanced stainless steel cladding. A stylized benchmark specification of the I 2 S-LWR core has been developed in order to test whole-core neutronics codes and methods. For simplification the core was split into 57 distinct material regions for cross section generation. Cross sections were generated using the lattice physics code HELIOS version 1.10 in both 8 and 47 groups. Monte Carlo solutions, including eigenvalue and pin fission densities, were generated for the 8 group library using MCNP5. Due to space limitations in this paper, the full cross section library and normalized pin fission density results are provided in the journalâs electronic repository.\n\nEmpirical psychology, common sense, and Kant's empirical markers for moral responsibility.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nFrierson, Patrick\n\n2008-12-01\n\nThis paper explains the empirical markers by which Kant thinks that one can identify moral responsibility. After explaining the problem of discerning such markers within a Kantian framework I briefly explain Kant's empirical psychology. I then argue that Kant's empirical markers for moral responsibility--linked to higher faculties of cognition--are not sufficient conditions for moral responsibility, primarily because they are empirical characteristics subject to natural laws. Next. I argue that these markers are not necessary conditions of moral responsibility. Given Kant's transcendental idealism, even an entity that lacks these markers could be free and morally responsible, although as a matter of fact Kant thinks that none are. Given that they are neither necessary nor sufficient conditions, I discuss the status of Kant's claim that higher faculties are empirical markers of moral responsibility. Drawing on connections between Kant's ethical theory and 'common rational cognition' (4:393), I suggest that Kant's theory of empirical markers can be traced to ordinary common sense beliefs about responsibility. This suggestion helps explain both why empirical markers are important and what the limits of empirical psychology are within Kant's account of moral responsibility.\n\nSTYLIZED FACTS OF ROMANIAN BUSINESS CYCLE.

These motivations can be psychological in nature or reflect behaviour suggested by the efficient market hypothesis (EMH). By introducing different propensities into a baseline model that displays EMH behaviour, one can attempt to isolate their effects upon the market dynamics. The simulation results indicate that the introduction of a herding propensity results in excess kurtosis and power-law decay consistent with those observed in actual return distributions, but not in significant long-term volatility correlations. Possible alternatives for introducing such long-term volatility correlations are then identified and discussed.\n\nEmpirical data and moral theory. A plea for integrated empirical ethics.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nMolewijk, Bert; Stiggelbout, Anne M; Otten, Wilma; Dupuis, Heleen M; Kievit, Job\n\n2004-01-01\n\nEthicists differ considerably in their reasons for using empirical data. This paper presents a brief overview of four traditional approaches to the use of empirical data: \"the prescriptive applied ethicists,\" \"the theorists,\" \"the critical applied ethicists,\" and \"the particularists.\" The main aim of this paper is to introduce a fifth approach of more recent date (i.e. \"integrated empirical ethics\") and to offer some methodological directives for research in integrated empirical ethics. All five approaches are presented in a table for heuristic purposes. The table consists of eight columns: \"view on distinction descriptive-prescriptive sciences,\" \"location of moral authority,\" \"central goal(s),\" \"types of normativity,\" \"use of empirical data,\" \"method,\" \"interaction empirical data and moral theory,\" and \"cooperation with descriptive sciences.\" Ethicists can use the table in order to identify their own approach. Reflection on these issues prior to starting research in empirical ethics should lead to harmonization of the different scientific disciplines and effective planning of the final research design. Integrated empirical ethics (IEE) refers to studies in which ethicists and descriptive scientists cooperate together continuously and intensively. Both disciplines try to integrate moral theory and empirical data in order to reach a normative conclusion with respect to a specific social practice. IEE is not wholly prescriptive or wholly descriptive since IEE assumes an interdepence between facts and values and between the empirical and the normative. The paper ends with three suggestions for consideration on some of the future challenges of integrated empirical ethics.\n\nThe Hotelling Principle, backwardation of futures prices and the values of developed petroleum reserves. The production constraint hypothesis\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nThompson, A.C.\n\n2001-01-01\n\nWe explore the practitioner-stylized facts that petroleum wells require large initial investments, have daily production capacities, and have small marginal costs for production rates meaningfully below these capacities. Long-run backwardation of futures prices is required to induce drilling new wells. In contrast to Miller and Upton (1985a,b) and Litzenberger and Rabinowitz (1995), production from developed reserves is essentially a corner solution at capacity regardless of backwardation or price volatility. Economically interesting supply decisions take the form of investment in exploration and drilling. Empirical evidence strongly rejects the Miller and Upton hypothesis in favor of our more general model\n\nMetaphysical accounts of the zygote as a person and the veto power of facts.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nBole, T J\n\n1989-12-01\n\nThat the soul of a human person is infused at conception is a metaphysical claim. But given its traditional articulation, it has the empirical consequence that the zygote must have a substantial continuity with the adult person, a continuity which is already determined at conception. This empirical consequence is contradicted by the fact that the zygote may become a hydatidiform mole, or several persons. The metaphysical claim is falsified by the facts.\n\nAdvertising and the Evolution of Market Structure in the US Car Industry\n\nOpenAIRE\n\nGeroski, Paul A; Mazzucato, Mariana\n\n2001-01-01\n\nThis paper focuses on a single simple stylized fact which stands out from the post-war history of the US car industry, namely that industry concentration fell just at the same time as industry advertising expenditures rose sharply. Since both events were almost certainly caused by the entry and market penetration of (largely) foreign owned car producers, this stylized fact raises interesting questions about whether â and if so, how â advertising affects entry. We use a model of consumer switc...\n\nEmpirical behavior of a world stock index from intra-day to monthly time scales\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nBreymann, W.; LÃ¼thi, D. R.; Platen, E.\n\n2009-10-01\n\nMost of the papers that study the distributional and fractal properties of financial instruments focus on stock prices or foreign exchange rates. This typically leads to mixed results concerning the distributions of log-returns and some multi-fractal properties of exchange rates, stock prices, and regional indices. This paper uses a well diversified world stock index as the central object of analysis. Such index approximates the growth optimal portfolio, which is demonstrated under the benchmark approach, it is the ideal reference unit for studying basic securities. When denominating this world index in units of a given currency, one measures the movements of the currency against the entire market. This provides a least disturbed observation of the currency dynamics. In this manner, one can expect to disentangle, e.g., the superposition of the two currencies involved in an exchange rate. This benchmark approach to the empirical analysis of financial data allows us to establish remarkable stylized facts. Most important is the observation that the repeatedly documented multi-fractal appearance of financial time series is very weak and much less pronounced than the deviation of the mono-scaling properties from Brownian-motion type scaling. The generalized Hurst exponent H(2) assumes typical values between 0.55 and 0.6. Accordingly, autocorrelations of log-returns decay according to a power law, and the quadratic variation vanishes when going to vanishing observation time step size. Furthermore, one can identify the Student t distribution as the log-return distribution of a well-diversified world stock index for long time horizons when a long enough data series is used for estimation. The study of dependence properties, finally, reveals that jumps at daily horizon originate primarily in the stock market while at 5min horizon they originate in the foreign exchange market. The principal message of the empirical analysis is that there is evidence that a diffusion model\n\nEmpirical evaluation and justification of methodologies in psychological science.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nProctor, R W; Capaldi, E J\n\n2001-11-01\n\nThe purpose of this article is to describe a relatively new movement in the history and philosophy of science, naturalism, a form of pragmatism emphasizing that methodological principles are empirical statements. Thus, methodological principles must be evaluated and justified on the same basis as other empirical statements. On this view, methodological statements may be less secure than the specific scientific theories to which they give rise. The authors examined the feasibility of a naturalistic approach to methodology using logical and historical analysis and by contrasting theories that predict new facts versus theories that explain already known facts. They provide examples of how differences over methodological issues in psychology and in science generally may be resolved using a naturalistic, or empirical, approach.\n\nThe frontiers of empirical science: A Thomist-inspired critique of ...\n\nAfrican Journals Online (AJOL)\n\n2016-07-08\n\nJul 8, 2016 ... of scientism, is, however, self-destructive of scientism because contrary to its ...

We use microdata from ten countries to establish stylized facts on the magnitude, form, and distributional implications of this \"informal taxation.\" Informal taxation is widespread, particularly in rural areas, with substantial in-kind labor payments. The wealthy pay more, but pay less in percentage terms, and informal taxes are more regressive than formal taxes. Failing to include informal taxation underestimates household tax burdens and revenue decentralization in developing countries.

Experimental econophysics together with empirical econophysics are two branches of the field of econophysics. The latter one has been extensively discussed in the existing books, while the former one has been seldom touched. In this book, the author will focus on the branch of experimental econophysics. Empirical econophysics is based on the analysis of data in real markets by using some statistical tools borrowed from traditional statistical physics. Differently, inspired by the role of controlled experiments and system modelling (for computer simulations and/or analytical theory) in developing modern physics, experimental econophysics specially relies on controlle...\n\nAnomalous Price Impact and the Critical Nature of Liquidity in Financial Markets\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nTÃ³th, B.; LempÃ©riÃ¨re, Y.; Deremble, C.; de Lataillade, J.; Kockelkoren, J.; Bouchaud, J.-P.\n\n2011-10-01\n\nWe propose a dynamical theory of market liquidity that predicts that the average supply/demand profile is V shaped and vanishes around the current price. This result is generic, and only relies on mild assumptions about the order flow and on the fact that prices are, to a first approximation, diffusive. This naturally accounts for two striking stylized facts: First, large metaorders have to be fragmented in order to be digested by the liquidity funnel, which leads to a long memory in the sign of the order flow. Second, the anomalously small local liquidity induces a breakdown of the linear response and a diverging impact of small orders, explaining the âsquare-rootâ impact law, for which we provide additional empirical support. Finally, we test our arguments quantitatively using a numerical model of order flow based on the same minimal ingredients.\n\nCritical Realism and Empirical Bioethics: A Methodological Exposition.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nMcKeown, Alex\n\n2017-09-01\n\nThis paper shows how critical realism can be used to integrate empirical data and philosophical analysis within 'empirical bioethics'. The term empirical bioethics, whilst appearing oxymoronic, simply refers to an interdisciplinary approach to the resolution of practical ethical issues within the biological and life sciences, integrating social scientific, empirical data with philosophical analysis. It seeks to achieve a balanced form of ethical deliberation that is both logically rigorous and sensitive to context, to generate normative conclusions that are practically applicable to the problem, challenge, or dilemma. Since it incorporates both philosophical and social scientific components, empirical bioethics is a field that is consistent with the use of critical realism as a research methodology. The integration of philosophical and social scientific approaches to ethics has been beset with difficulties, not least because of the irreducibly normative, rather than descriptive, nature of ethical analysis and the contested relation between fact and value. However, given that facts about states of affairs inform potential courses of action and their consequences, there is a need to overcome these difficulties and successfully integrate data with theory. Previous approaches have been formulated to overcome obstacles in combining philosophical and social scientific perspectives in bioethical analysis; however each has shortcomings. As a mature interdisciplinary approach critical realism is well suited to empirical bioethics, although it has hitherto not been widely used. Here I show how it can be applied to this kind of research and explain how it represents an improvement on previous approaches.\n\nInformal Taxation*\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nOlken, Benjamin A.; Singhal, Monica\n\n2011-01-01\n\nInformal payments are a frequently overlooked source of local public finance in developing countries.

Buch\n\n2000-06-01\n\nFull Text Available The German financial system is characterized by low degrees of penetration by foreign commercial banks and of (bank disintermediation compared to, for instance, the United States. This could be attributed to the fact that universal banking in Germany creates implicit barriers to entry. Yet, regulatory and informational differences which are unrelated to universal banking could be responsible for the observed difference. This paper provides a stylized theoretical model of the banking industry, which suggests that market segmentation and limited market entry can be due to a number of factors, including information costs. Preliminary empirical evidence does not provide clear evidence for the hypothesis that universal banking is the reason for the observed differences in financial systems.\n\nAnomalous Price Impact and the Critical Nature of Liquidity in Financial Markets\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nB.

However, it is unclear whether argumentation is understood and practiced in comparable ways across disciplines. This study consequently examined empirically how students perceive argumentation in science and (first) language lessons. Specifically, we investigated students' beliefs about the relevance of discourse and the role of facts. Data from 3,258 high school students from 85 German secondary schools were analyzed with multigroup multilevel structural equation modeling in order to disentangle whether or not differences in argumentation across disciplines exist and the extent to which variation in students' beliefs can be explained by gender and school track. Results showed that students perceived the role of facts as highly relevant for science lessons, whereas discursive characteristics were considered significantly less important. In turn, discourse played a central role in language lessons, which was believed to require less knowledge of facts. These differences were independent of students' gender. In contrast, school track predicted the differences in beliefs significantly. Our findings lend evidence on the existence of disciplinary school cultures in argumentation that may be the result of differences in teachers' school-track-specific classroom practice and education. Implications in terms of a teacher's role in establishing norms for scientific argumentation as well as the impact of students' beliefs on their learning outcomes are discussed.

We motivate the essay by establishing the following two stylized facts. First, we document...... insurance against the default of safe sovereigns? Second, what drives safe-haven CDS premiums if not credit risk?...... between bond yield and risk-free rate, for safe sovereigns. This finding is in opposition to the no-arbitrage theory that CDS premiums and yield spreads should move in lockstep. Motivated by these stylized facts, we investigate the following two questions: First, what are the motives behind purchasing...\n\nModeling and forecasting crude oil markets using ARCH-type models\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nCheong, Chin Wen\n\n2009-01-01\n\nThis study investigates the time-varying volatility of two major crude oil markets, the West Texas Intermediate (WTI) and Europe Brent. A flexible autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity (ARCH) model is used to take into account the stylized volatility facts such as clustering volatility, asymmetric news impact and long memory volatility among others. The empirical results indicate that the intensity of long-persistence volatility in the WTI is greater than in the Brent. It is also found that for the WTI, the appreciation and depreciation shocks of the WTI have similar impact on the resulting volatility. However, a leverage effect is found in Brent. Although both the estimation and diagnostic evaluations are in favor of an asymmetric long memory ARCH model, only the WTI models provide superior in the out-of-sample forecasts. On the other hand, from the empirical out-of-sample forecasts, it appears that the simplest parsimonious generalized ARCH provides the best forecasted evaluations for the Brent crude oil data.\n\nModeling and forecasting crude oil markets using ARCH-type models\n\nEnergy Technology Data Exchange (ETDEWEB)\n\nCheong, Chin Wen [Research Centre of Mathematical Sciences, Faculty of Information Technology, Multimedia University, 63100 Cyberjaya, Selango"
