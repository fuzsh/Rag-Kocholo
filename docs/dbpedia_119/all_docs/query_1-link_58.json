        "meta_description": "Mentioning: 13 - This paper presents an overview of some recent applications of methods of statistical physics to financial problems such as stock market behaviour and crashes. This field of research has seen intensive developments over the last ten years and is today known as econophysics. The first section of the paper offers a review of the main directions of research in experimental, theoretical, and applied econophysics. A second section then introduces a case study of physical modelling of a financial event, namely a stock market crash seen as a higher order phase transition. The model used is the Ising model in Bethe-Peierls ('quasi chemical') approximation. In spite of its minimal character, the model exhibits a statistical pattern of stock market prices consistent with that observed empirically.",

        "text": "This paper deals with the disciplinary dimension of a very new field called econophysics and shows that despite the fact that econophysics is regularly described as an interdisciplinary approach, it is in fact a multidisciplinary field. Beyond this observation, we note that recent developments suggest that econophysics could evolve towards a more integrated field. We therefore propose a prospective approach by analyzing how this field could become transdisciplinary. In this article, we focus on financial work, and we show that a common scheme is attainable and we investigate the possibilities of a trandisciplinary econophysics which will make possible to revisit the theoretical foundations of financial economics and develop new models and theories better suited to the management of financial risks and financial markets.The contribution of this article is twofold: on the one hand it clarifies the epistemological status of econophysics, and on the other, it studies the recent evolution of econophysics and shows how this field could evolve to become transdisciplinary.\n\nThis paper deals with the disciplinary dimension of a very new field called econophysics and shows that despite the fact that econophysics is regularly described as an interdisciplinary approach, it is in fact a multidisciplinary field.

In order to strengthen financial stability, policy makers are looking for new analytical tools to identify and address sources of systemic risk. Complexity theory and network analysis can make a useful contribution. The financial crisis has highlighted the need to look at the links and interconnections in the financial system. Complexity and network theory which can help identify the extent to which the financial system is resilient to contagion as well as the nature of major triggers and channels of contagion. However, the methodological suitability of the premises of complexity theory for financial systems is still debatable. The use of complexity analysis in finance draws on two distinct but related strands of theory: econophysics and econobiology. Each strand is associated with advantages and drawbacks in explaining the dynamics of financial systems. Properly combined, these theories could form a coherent body of theoretical premises that are capable of approximating reality in financial systems, i.e. explain the \"stylized facts\", better than the traditional financial analysis model, which is crucially based on the false conception of a Gaussian distribution of financial returns."
