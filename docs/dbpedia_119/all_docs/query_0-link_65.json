This language incorporates quantum logical as well as relativistic restrictions. It is shown that relativity imposes serious restrictions on the validity regions of propositions in space-time. By an additional postulate this relativistic quantum logic can be made consistent. The results of this paper are derived exclusively within the formal quantum language; they are, however, in accordance with well-known facts of relativistic quantum physics in Hilbert space.

It is a sort of intermediate realm, between the familiar nonrelativistic quantum mechanics and fully relativistic quantum field theory, and thus it lacks the simplicity and elegance of both. Yet it is a necessary tool, mostly for quantum chemists. Pilkuhn's book offers to this audience an up-to-date survey of these methods, which is quite welcome since most previous textbooks are at least ten years old. The point of view of the author is to start immediately in the relativistic domain, following the lead of Maxwell's equations rather than classical mechanics, and thus to treat the nonrelativistic version as an approximation. Thus Chapter 1 takes off from Maxwell's equations (in the noncovariant Coulomb gauge) and gradually derives the basic aspects of Quantum Mechanics in a rather pedestrian way (states and observables, Hilbert space, operators, quantum measurement, scattering,. Chapter 2 starts with the Lorentz transformations, then continues with the Pauli spin equation and the Dirac equation and some of their applications (notably the hydrogen atom). Chapter 3 is entitled 'Quantum fields and particles', but falls short of treating quantum field theory properly: only creation/annihilation operators are considered, for a particle in a box. The emphasis is on two-electron states (the Pauli principle, the Foldy--Wouthuysen elimination of small components of Dirac spinors, Breit projection operators. Chapter 4 is devoted to scattering theory and the description of relativistic bound states. Chapter 5, finally, covers hyperfine interactions and radiative corrections. As we said above, relativistic quantum mechanics is by nature limited in scope and rather inelegant and Pilkuhn's book is no exception. The notation is often heavy (mostly noncovariant) and the mathematical level rather low.

Econophysics has emerged organically from a new paradigm of inquiry - synergy. The first and most important characteristic of econophysics is its reliance on the phenomenological approach in economic research, which aims to describe a phenomenonâs nature without aspiring to an exhaustive explanation of its mechanics. Econophysics, utilizing the methods of quantum and statistical physics, had predicted national and global crises (the collapse of the Soviet Union, collapses in the Chinese stock market in 2005-2009 and the global financial crisis. Nonlinear dynamic models were used to describe cyclical and complex modes of the dynamics of socio-economic systems (population, city development, trade between countries and so on. Near-term prospects of econophysics are associated with more in-depth study and simulation of the behavior of economic agents, development of the theory of nonlinear dynamics and interdisciplinary interaction. The value of econophysics is in its ability to both produce applicational results and evaluate scenarios of global development and focus on the fate of humanity\n\nRelativistic Quantum Revivals\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nStrange, P.\n\n2010-01-01\n\nQuantum revivals are now a well-known phenomena within nonrelativistic quantum theory. In this Letter we display the effects of relativity on revivals and quantum carpets. It is generally believed that revivals do not occur within a relativistic regime. Here we show that while this is generally true, it is possible, in principle, to set up wave packets with specific mathematical properties that do exhibit exact revivals within a fully relativistic theory.\n\nRelativistic quantum mechanics\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nOllitrault, J.Y.\n\n1998-12-01\n\nThese notes form an introduction to relativistic quantum mechanics.

Stueckelberg approach proposed in the early 40s. In this framework a universal invariant evolution parameter (corresponding to the time originally postulated by Newton) is introduced to describe dynamical evolution. This theory is able to provide solutions for some of the fundamental problems encountered in early attempts to construct a relativistic quantum theory. A relativistically covariant construction is given for which particle spins and angular momenta can be combined through the usual rotation group Clebsch-Gordan coefficients. Solutions are defined for both the classical and quantum two body bound state and scattering problems. The recently developed quantum Lax-Phillips theory of semigroup evolution of resonant states is described. The experiment of Lindner and coworkers on interference in time is discussed showing how the property of coherence in time provides a simple understanding of the results.

Furthermore, we show that by considering relativistic trajectories of the probe, we enhance the efficiency of the quantum control. We explore the possible use of these relativistic techniques to build 1-qubit quantum gates.\n\nRelativistic quantum chemistry on quantum computers\n\nDEFF Research Database (Denmark)\n\nVeis, L.; Visnak, J.; Fleig, T.\n\n2012-01-01\n\nThe past few years have witnessed a remarkable interest in the application of quantum computing for solving problems in quantum chemistry more efficiently than classical computers allow. Very recently, proof-of-principle experimental realizations have been reported. However, so far only...... the nonrelativistic regime (i.e., the Schrodinger equation) has been explored, while it is well known that relativistic effects can be very important in chemistry. We present a quantum algorithm for relativistic computations of molecular energies. We show how to efficiently solve the eigenproblem of the Dirac......-Coulomb Hamiltonian on a quantum computer and demonstrate the functionality of the proposed procedure by numerical simulations of computations of the spin-orbit splitting in the SbH molecule. Finally, we propose quantum circuits with three qubits and nine or ten controlled-NOT (CNOT) gates, which implement a proof...\n\nStudy of quantum spin correlations of relativistic electron pairs - Testing nonlocality of relativistic quantum mechanics\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nBodek, K.; RozpÄdzik, D.; Zejma, J.; Caban, P.; RembieliÅski, J.; WÅodarczyk, M.; Ciborowski, J.; Enders, J.; KÃ¶hler, A.; Kozela, A.\n\n2013-01-01\n\nThe Polish-German project QUEST aims at studying relativistic quantum spin correlations of the Einstein-Rosen-Podolsky-Bohm type, through measurement of the correlation function and the corresponding probabilities for relativistic electron pairs. The results will be compared to theoretical predictions obtained by us within the framework of relativistic quantum mechanics, based on assumptions regarding the form of the relativistic spin operator. Agreement or divergence will be interpreted in the context of non-uniqueness of the relativistic spin operator in quantum mechanics as well as dependence of the correlation function on the choice of observables representing the spin. Pairs of correlated electrons will originate from the Mo/ller scattering of polarized 15 MeV electrons provided by the superconducting Darmstadt electron linear accelerator S-DALINAC, TU Darmstadt, incident on a Be target. Spin projections will be determined using the Mott polarimetry technique. Measurements (starting 2013) are planned for longitudinal and transverse beam polarizations and different orientations of the beam polarization vector w.r.t. the Mo/ller scattering plane. This is the first project to study relativistic spin correlations for particles with mass\n\nRelativistic quantum chaos-An emergent interdisciplinary field.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nLai, Ying-Cheng; Xu, Hong-Ya; Huang, Liang; Grebogi, Celso\n\n2018-05-01\n\nQuantum chaos is referred to as the study of quantum manifestations or fingerprints of classical chaos.

A new field has thus emerged: relativistic quantum chaos. This Tutorial aims to introduce this field to the scientific community.

The projective representations are equivalent to the unitary representations of the central extension of the group. A celebrated example is Wigner's formulation of special relativistic quantum mechanics as the projective representations of the inhomogeneous Lorentz group. However, Wigner's formulation makes no mention of the Weyl-Heisenberg group and the hermitian representation of its algebra that are the Heisenberg commutation relations fundamental to quantum physics. We put aside the relativistic symmetry and show that the maximal quantum symmetry that leaves the Heisenberg commutation relations invariant is the projective representations of the conformally scaled inhomogeneous symplectic group. The Weyl-Heisenberg group and noncommutative structure arises directly because the quantum phase requires projective representations. We then consider the relativistic implications of the quantum phase that lead to the Born line element and the projective representations of an inhomogeneous unitary group that defines a noninertial quantum theory. (Understanding noninertial quantum mechanics is a prelude to understanding quantum gravity.) The remarkable properties of this symmetry and its limits are studied.\n\nRelativistic quantum mechanics an introduction to relativistic quantum fields\n\nCERN Document Server\n\nMaiani, Luciano\n\n2016-01-01\n\nWritten by two of the world's leading experts on particle physics and the standard model - including an award-winning former Director General of CERN - this textbook provides a completely up-to-date account of relativistic quantum mechanics and quantum field theory. It describes the formal and phenomenological aspects of the standard model of particle physics, and is suitable for advanced undergraduate and graduate students studying both theoretical and experimental physics.\n\nRelationship between quantum walks and relativistic quantum mechanics\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nChandrashekar, C. M.; Banerjee, Subhashish; Srikanth, R.\n\n2010-01-01\n\nQuantum walk models have been used as an algorithmic tool for quantum computation and to describe various physical processes. This article revisits the relationship between relativistic quantum mechanics and the quantum walks. We show the similarities of the mathematical structure of the decoupled and coupled forms of the discrete-time quantum walk to that of the Klein-Gordon and Dirac equations, respectively. In the latter case, the coin emerges as an analog of the spinor degree of freedom. Discrete-time quantum walk as a coupled form of the continuous-time quantum walk is also shown by transforming the decoupled form of the discrete-time quantum walk to the Schroedinger form. By showing the coin to be a means to make the walk reversible and that the Dirac-like structure is a consequence of the coin use, our work suggests that the relativistic causal structure is a consequence of conservation of information. However, decoherence (modeled by projective measurements on position space) generates entropy that increases with time, making the walk irreversible and thereby producing an arrow of time. The Lieb-Robinson bound is used to highlight the causal structure of the quantum walk to put in perspective the relativistic structure of the quantum walk, the maximum speed of walk propagation, and earlier findings related to the finite spread of the walk probability distribution. We also present a two-dimensional quantum walk model on a two-state system to which the study can be extended.\n\nRelativistic Quantum Transport in Graphene Systems\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\n2015-07-09\n\ndimensional Dirac material systems. 2 List of Publications 1.

Quantum metrology has been so far successfully applied to design precision instruments such as clocks and sensors which outperform classical devices by exploiting quantum properties. There are advanced plans to implement these and other quantum technologies in space, for instance Space-QUEST and Space Optical Clock projects intend to implement quantum communications and quantum clocks at regimes where relativity starts to kick in. However, typical setups do not take into account the effects of relativity on quantum properties. To include and exploit these effects, we introduce techniques for the application of metrology to quantum field theory. Quantum field theory properly incorporates quantum theory and relativity, in particular, at regimes where space-based experiments take place. This framework allows for high precision estimation of parameters that appear in quantum field theory including proper times and accelerations. Indeed, the techniques can be applied to develop a novel generation of relativistic quantum technologies for gravimeters, clocks and sensors. As an example, we present a high precision device which in principle improves the state-of-the-art in quantum accelerometers by exploiting relativistic effects.\n\nThe Wigner function in the relativistic quantum mechanics\n\nEnergy Technology Data Exchange (ETDEWEB)\n\nKowalski, K., E-mail: kowalski@uni.lodz.pl; RembieliÅski, J.\n\n2016-12-15\n\nA detailed study is presented of the relativistic Wigner function for a quantum spinless particle evolving in time according to the Salpeter equation. - Highlights: â¢ We study the Wigner function for a quantum spinless relativistic particle. â¢ We discuss the relativistic Wigner function introduced by Zavialov and Malokostov. â¢ We introduce relativistic Wigner function based on the standard definition. â¢ We find analytic expressions for relativistic Wigner functions.\n\nRelativistic entanglement from relativistic quantum mechanics in the rest-frame instant form of dynamics\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nLusanna, Luca\n\n2011-01-01\n\nAfter a review of the problems induced by the Lorentz signature of Minkowski space-time, like the need of a clock synchronization convention for the definition of 3-space and the complexity of the notion of relativistic center of mass, there is the introduction of a new formulation of relativistic quantum mechanics compatible with the theory of relativistic bound states. In it the zeroth postulate of non-relativistic quantum mechanics is not valid and the physics is described in the rest frame by a Hilbert space containing only relative variables. The non-locality of the Poincare' generators imply a kinematical non-locality and non-separability influencing the theory of relativistic entanglement and not connected with the standard quantum non-locality.\n\nOn the Velocity of Moving Relativistic Unstable Quantum Systems\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nK. Urbanowski\n\n2015-01-01\n\nFull Text Available We study properties of moving relativistic quantum unstable systems. We show that in contrast to the properties of classical particles and quantum stable objects the velocity of freely moving relativistic quantum unstable systems cannot be constant in time. We show that this new quantum effect results from the fundamental principles of the quantum theory and physics: it is a consequence of the principle of conservation of energy and of the fact that the mass of the quantum unstable system is not defined. This effect can affect the form of the decay law of moving relativistic quantum unstable systems.\n\nNon-relativistic Limit of a Dirac Polaron in Relativistic Quantum Electrodynamics\n\nCERN Document Server\n\nArai, A\n\n2006-01-01\n\nA quantum system of a Dirac particle interacting with the quantum radiation field is considered in the case where no external potentials exist. Then the total momentum of the system is conserved and the total Hamiltonian is unitarily equivalent to the direct integral $\\\\int_{{\\\\bf R}^3}^\\\\oplus\\\\overline{H({\\\\bf p})}d{\\\\bf p}$ of a family of self-adjoint operators $\\\\overline{H({\\\\bf p})}$ acting in the Hilbert space $\\\\oplus^4{\\\\cal F}_{\\\\rm rad}$, where ${\\\\cal F}_{\\\\rm rad}$ is the Hilbert space of the quantum radiation field. The fibre operator $\\\\overline{H({\\\\bf p})}$ is called the Hamiltonian of the Dirac polaron with total momentum ${\\\\bf p} \\\\in {\\\\bf R}^3$. The main result of this paper is concerned with the non-relativistic (scaling) limit of $\\\\overline{H({\\\\bf p})}$. It is proven that the non-relativistic limit of $\\\\overline{H({\\\\bf p})}$ yields a self-adjoint extension of a Hamiltonian of a polaron with spin $1/2$ in non-relativistic quantum electrodynamics.\n\nRelativistic quantum mechanics of leptons and fields\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nGrandy, W.T. Jr.\n\n1991-01-01\n\nThis book serves as an advanced text on the Dirac theory, and provides a monograph summarizing the description of relativistic quantum mechanics and quantum electrodynamics as classical field theories. It presents a broad, detailed, and up-to-date exposition of relativistic quantum mechanics, including the two-body problem. It also demonstrates the extent to which the behavior of stable particles and their interactions can be understood without introducing operator (second-quantized) fields. The subsequent difficulties are studied in detail and possible resolutions are presented through quantum field theory\n\nPoint form relativistic quantum mechanics and relativistic SU(6)\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nKlink, W. H.\n\n1993-01-01\n\nThe point form is used as a framework for formulating a relativistic quantum mechanics, with the mass operator carrying the interactions of underlying constituents. A symplectic Lie algebra of mass operators is introduced from which a relativistic harmonic oscillator mass operator is formed. Mass splittings within the degenerate harmonic oscillator levels arise from relativistically invariant spin-spin, spin-orbit, and tensor mass operators. Internal flavor (and color) symmetries are introduced which make it possible to formulate a relativistic SU(6) model of baryons (and mesons). Careful attention is paid to the permutation symmetry properties of the hadronic wave functions, which are written as polynomials in Bargmann spaces.\n\nRelativistic quantum similarities in atoms in position and momentum spaces\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nMaldonado, P.; Sarsa, A.; Buendia, E.; Galvez, F.J.\n\n2011-01-01\n\nA study of different quantum similarity measures and their corresponding quantum similarity indices is carried out for the atoms from H to Lr (Z=1-103). Relativistic effects in both position and momentum spaces have been studied by comparing the relativistic values to the non-relativistic ones. We have used the atomic electron density in both position and momentum spaces obtained within relativistic and non-relativistic numerical-parameterized optimized effective potential approximations. -- Highlights: â Quantum similarity measures and indices in electronic structure of atoms. â Position and momentum electronic densities. â Similarity of relativistic and non-relativistic densities. â Similarity of core and valence regions of different atoms. â Dependence with Z along the Periodic Table.\n\nConsistent resolution of some relativistic quantum paradoxes\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nGriffiths, Robert B.\n\n2002-01-01\n\nA relativistic version of the (consistent or decoherent) histories approach to quantum theory is developed on the basis of earlier work by Hartle, and used to discuss relativistic forms of the paradoxes of spherical wave packet collapse, Bohm's formulation of the Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen paradox, and Hardy's paradox. It is argued that wave function collapse is not needed for introducing probabilities into relativistic quantum mechanics, and in any case should never be thought of as a physical process. Alternative approaches to stochastic time dependence can be used to construct a physical picture of the measurement process that is less misleading than collapse models. In particular, one can employ a coarse-grained but fully quantum-mechanical description in which particles move along trajectories, with behavior under Lorentz transformations the same as in classical relativistic physics, and detectors are triggered by particles reaching them along such trajectories. States entangled between spacelike separate regions are also legitimate quantum descriptions, and can be consistently handled by the formalism presented here. The paradoxes in question arise because of using modes of reasoning which, while correct for classical physics, are inconsistent with the mathematical structure of quantum theory, and are resolved (or tamed) by using a proper quantum analysis. In particular, there is no need to invoke, nor any evidence for, mysterious long-range superluminal influences, and thus no incompatibility, at least from this source, between relativity theory and quantum mechanics\n\nExperimental econophysics properties and mechanisms of laboratory markets\n\nCERN Document Server\n\nHuang, Ji-Ping\n\n2015-01-01\n\nExperimental Econophysics describes the method of controlled human experiments, which is developed by physicists to study some problems in economics or finance, namely, stylized facts, fluctuation phenomena, herd behavior, contrarian behavior, hedge behavior, cooperation, business cycles, partial information, risk management, and stock prediction. Experimental econophysics together with empirical econophysics are two branches of the field of econophysics. The latter one has been extensively discussed in the existing books, while the former one has been seldom touched. In this book, the author will focus on the branch of experimental econophysics. Empirical econophysics is based on the analysis of data in real markets by using some statistical tools borrowed from traditional statistical physics. Differently, inspired by the role of controlled experiments and system modelling (for computer simulations and/or analytical theory) in developing modern physics, experimental econophysics specially relies on controlle...\n\nStationary self-focusing of Gaussian laser beam in relativistic thermal quantum plasma\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nPatil, S. D.; Takale, M. V.\n\n2013-01-01\n\nIn the present paper, we have employed the quantum dielectric response in thermal quantum plasma to model relativistic self-focusing of Gaussian laser beam in a plasma. We have presented an extensive parametric investigation of the dependence of beam-width parameter on distance of propagation in relativistic thermal quantum plasma. We have studied the role of Fermi temperature in the phenomenon of self-focusing. It is found that the quantum effects cause much higher oscillations of beam-width parameter and better relativistic focusing of laser beam in thermal quantum plasma in comparison with that in the relativistic cold quantum plasma and classical relativistic plasma. Our computations show more reliable results in comparison to the previous works\n\nRelativity, Symmetry, and the Structure of Quantum Theory, Volume 2; Point form relativistic quantum mechanics\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nKlink, William H.; Schweiger, Wolfgang\n\n2018-03-01\n\nThis book covers relativistic quantum theory from the point of view of a particle theory, based on the irreducible representations of the PoincarÃ© group, the group that expresses the symmetry of Einstein relativity. There are several ways of formulating such a theory; this book develops what is called relativistic point form quantum mechanics, which, unlike quantum field theory, deals with a fixed number of particles in a relativistically invariant way. A chapter is devoted to applications of point form quantum mechanics to nuclear physics.\n\nLectures on relativistic quantum mechanics and path integration\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nGunn, J.M.F.\n\n1989-02-01\n\nThe question posed is why bother with relativistic quantum mechanics? Three reasons are given: First that there are many experimental phenomena which cannot be explained in non-relativistic terms. Secondly it would be unsatisfactory if relativity and quantum mechanics could not be united. Thirdly, there are theoretical reasons why new effects can be expected at relativistic velocities. The objectives of the course are to set up relativistic analogues of the Schroedinger equation and to understand their consequences. In doing so there are some questions which are raised and discussed such as can a first order equation be used to describe spin 0 particles and a second order equation be used to describe spin 1/ 2 (author)\n\nA relativistic theory for continuous measurement of quantum fields\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nDiosi, L.\n\n1990-04-01\n\nA formal theory for the continuous measurement of relativistic quantum fields is proposed. The corresponding scattering equations were derived. The proposed formalism reduces to known equations in the Markovian case. Two recent models for spontaneous quantum state reduction have been recovered in the framework of this theory. A possible example of the relativistic continuous measurement has been outlined in standard Quantum Electrodynamics. The continuous measurement theory possesses an alternative formulation in terms of interacting quantum and stochastic fields.

[Universidade Federal de Sergipe (UFS), Aracaju, SE (Brazil); Gitman, D.M. [Sao Paulo Univ. (USP), SP (Brazil). Inst. de Fisica\n\n2000-07-01\n\nFull text follows: There is a common opinion that the construction of a consistent relativistic quantum mechanics on the base of a relativistic wave equation meets well-known difficulties related to the existence of infinite number of negative energy levels, to the existence of negative vector norms, and so on, which may be only solved in a second-quantized theory, see, for example, two basic papers devoted to the problem L.Foldy, S.Wouthuysen, Phys. Rep.78 (1950) 29; H.Feshbach, F.Villars, Rev. Mod. Phys. 30 (1958) 24, whose arguments are repeated in all handbooks in relativistic quantum theory. Even Dirac trying to solve the problem had turned last years to infinite-component relativistic wave equations, see P.A.M. Dirac, Proc. R. Soc. London, A328 (1972) 1. We believe that a consistent relativistic quantum mechanics may be constructed on the base of an extended (charge symmetric) equation, which unite both a relativistic wave equation for a particle and for an antiparticle. We present explicitly the corresponding construction, see for details hep-th/0003112. We support such a construction by two demonstrations: first, in course of a careful canonical quantization of the corresponding classical action of a relativistic particle we arrive just to such a consistent quantum mechanics; second, we demonstrate that a reduction of the QFT of a corresponding field (scalar, spinor, etc.) to one-particle sector, if such a reduction may be done, present namely this quantum mechanics.

We obtain the relativistic energy spectrum for the four relativistic quantum Smorodinsky-Winternitz systems from their quasi-Hamiltonian and the quadratic algebras studied by Daskaloyannis in the nonrelativistic context. We also apply the quadratic algebra approach directly to the initial Dirac equation for these four systems and show that the quadratic algebras obtained are the same than those obtained from the quasi-Hamiltonians. We point out how results obtained in context of quantum superintegrable systems and their polynomial algebras can be applied to the quantum relativistic case.\n\nEconophysics and individual choice\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nBordley, Robert F.\n\n2005-08-01\n\nThe subjectivist theory of probability specifies certain axioms of rationality which together lead to both a theory of probability and a theory of preference. The theory of probability is used throughout the sciences while the theory of preferences is used in economics. Results in quantum physics challenge the adequacy of the subjectivist theory of probability. As we show, answering this challenge requires modifying an Archimedean axiom in the subjectivist theory. But changing this axiom modifies the subjectivist theory of preference and therefore has implications for economics. As this paper notes, these implications are consistent with current empirical findings in psychology and economics. As we show, these results also have implications for pricing in securities markets. This suggests further directions for research in econophysics.\n\nEconophysics: A new discipline\n\nOpenAIRE\n\nSonia R.

Since the traditional approach performed by Economics or Finance has revealed to be insufficient in fully characterizing and explaining the correspondingly phenomena, we discuss whether Econophysics can provide a new insight onto these matters. Thus, an assessment is presented in order to weight its potential opportunities and limitations.

The participants were physicists with a wide range of different expertise and interests. The lecture was intended as a survey of a small selection of the insights into the structure of relativistic quantum physics that have accumulated through the efforts of many people over more than 50 years. (Including, among many others, R. Haag, H. Araki, D. Kastler, H.-J. Borchers, A. Wightman, R. Streater, B. Schroer, H. Reeh, S. Schlieder, S. Doplicher, J. Roberts, R. Jost, K. Hepp, J. FrÃ¶hlich, J.

This contribution discusses some facts about relativistic quantum physics, most of which are quite familiar to practitioners of Algebraic Quantum Field Theory (AQFT) [Also known as Local Quantum Physics (Haag, Local quantum physics. Springer, Berlin, 1992).] but less well known outside this community. No claim of originality is made; the goal of this contribution is merely to present these facts in a simple and concise manner, focusing on the following issues: Explaining how quantum mechanics (QM) combined with (special) relativity, in particular an upper bound on the propagation velocity of effects, leads naturally to systems with an infinite number of degrees of freedom (relativistic quantum fields).\n\nRun-away electrons in relativistic spin (1) /(2) quantum electrodynamics\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nLow, F.E.\n\n1998-01-01\n\nThe existence of run-away solutions in classical and non-relativistic quantum electrodynamics is reviewed. It is shown that the less singular high energy behavior of relativistic spin (1) /(2) quantum electrodynamics precludes an analogous behavior in that theory. However, a Landau-like anomalous pole in the photon propagation function or in the electron-massive photon forward scattering amplitude would generate a new run-away, characterized by an energy scale Ïâ¼m e thinspexp(1/Î±). This contrasts with the energy scale Ïâ¼m e /Î± associated with the classical and non-relativistic quantum run-aways. copyright 1998 Academic Press, Inc\n\nObserver dependence of quantum states in relativistic quantum field theories\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nMalin, S.\n\n1982-01-01\n\nQuantum states can be understood as either (i) describing quantum systems or (ii) representing observers' knowledge about quantum systems. These different meanings are shown to imply different transformation properties in relativistic field theories. The rules for the reduction of quantum states and the transformation properties of quantum states under Lorentz transformations are derived for case (ii). The results obtained are applied to a quantum system recently presented and analyzed by Aharonov and Albert. It is shown that the present results, combined with Aharonov and Albert's, amount to a proof of Bohr's view that quantum states represent observers' knowledge about quantum systems\n\nRelativistic quantum mechanics and introduction to field theory\n\nEnergy Technology Data Exchange (ETDEWEB)\n\nYndurain, F.J.

In recent years many of physical theories like theory of turbulence, scaling, random matrix theory or renormalization group were successfully applied to economy giving a boost to modern computational techniques of data analysis, risk management, artificial markets, macro-economy, etc. Econophysics became a regular discipline covering a large spectrum of problems of modern economy . It is impossible to review the whole field in a short paper. Here we shall instead attempt to give a flavor of how econophysics approaches economical problems by discussing one particular issue as an example: the emergence and consequences of large scale regularities, which in particular occur in the presence of fat tails in probability distributions in macro-economy and quantitative finance.

These correlations can, however, not be used in order to produce superluminal signals and thus to violate Einstein-causality and special relativity.

[Rutgers Univ., Piscataway, NJ (United States); Sharp, David H. [Los Alamos National Lab. (LANL), Los Alamos, NM (United States)\n\n2017-12-20\n\nWe explore the role played by the di eomorphism group and its unitary representations in relativistic quantum eld theory. From the quantum kinematics of particles described by representations of the di eomorphism group of a space-like surface in an inertial reference frame, we reconstruct the local relativistic neutral scalar eld in the Fock representation. An explicit expression for the free Hamiltonian is obtained in terms of the Lie algebra generators (mass and momentum densities). We suggest that this approach can be generalized to elds whose quanta are spatially extended objects.\n\nTime Operator in Relativistic Quantum Mechanics\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nKhorasani, Sina\n\n2017-07-01\n\nIt is first shown that the Diracâs equation in a relativistic frame could be modified to allow discrete time, in agreement to a recently published upper bound. Next, an exact self-adjoint 4 Ã 4 relativistic time operator for spin-1/2 particles is found and the time eigenstates for the non-relativistic case are obtained and discussed. Results confirm the quantum mechanical speculation that particles can indeed occupy negative energy levels with vanishingly small but non-zero probablity, contrary to the general expectation from classical physics. Hence, Wolfgang Pauliâs objection regarding the existence of a self-adjoint time operator is fully resolved. It is shown that using the time operator, a bosonic field referred here to as energons may be created, whose number state representations in non-relativistic momentum space can be explicitly found.\n\nRelativistic classical limit of quantum theory\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nShin, G.R.; Rafelski, J.\n\n1993-01-01\n\nWe study the classical limit of the equal-time relativistic quantum transport theory. We discuss in qualitative terms the need to fold first the Wigner function with a coarse-graining function. Only then does the singularity at ââ0 seem to be manageable. In the limit ââ0, we obtain the relativistic Vlasov equations for the particle and the antiparticle sector of the Fock space. Similarly, we address the evolution equations of the spin and the magnetic-moment density\n\n1996-2016: Two decades of econophysics: Between methodological diversification and conceptual coherence\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nSchinckus, C.\n\n2016-12-01\n\nThis article aimed at presenting the scattered econophysics literature as a unified and coherent field through a specific lens imported from philosophy science. More precisely, I used the methodology developed by Imre Lakatos to cover the methodological evolution of econophysics over these last two decades. In this perspective, three co-existing approaches have been identified: statistical econophysics, bottom-up agent based econophysics and top-down agent based econophysics. Although the last is presented here as the last step of the methodological evolution of econophysics, it is worth mentioning that this tradition is still very new. A quick look on the econophysics literature shows that the vast majority of works in this field deal with a strictly statistical approach or a classical bottom-up agent-based modelling. In this context of diversification, the objective (and contribution) of this article is to emphasize the conceptual coherence of econophysics as a unique field of research. With this purpose, I used a theoretical framework coming from philosophy of science to characterize how econophysics evolved by combining a methodological enrichment with the preservation of its core conceptual statements.\n\nRelativistic quantum vorticity of the quadratic form of the Dirac equation\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nAsenjo, Felipe A; Mahajan, Swadesh M\n\n2015-01-01\n\nWe explore the fluid version of the quadratic form of the Dirac equation, sometimes called the FeynmanâGell-Mann equation. The dynamics of the quantum spinor field is represented by equations of motion for the fluid density, the velocity field, and the spin field. In analogy with classical relativistic and non-relativistic quantum theories, the fully relativistic fluid formulation of this equation allows a vortex dynamics. The vortical form is described by a total tensor field that is the weighted combination of the inertial, electromagnetic and quantum forces. The dynamics contrives the quadratic form of the Dirac equation as a total vorticity free system.

The notion of a ''particle'' is defined in the classical case and the interpretation of mechanics in space-time is clarified. These notions are carried over to the quantum theory, as much as possible. The relation between the results of Feyman's path integral approach and the theory of Horwitz and Piron is discussed. The ''particle'' interpretation is shown to imply an asymptotic condition for scattering. A general method of constructing the dynamical mass spectrum of composite ''particle'' states is discussed. An interference experiment is proposed to affirm the interpretation and applicability of Stueckelberg type wave functions for actual physical phenomena. Some discussion of the relation of this relativistic quantum theory to Feynman's approach to quantum field theory is also given\n\nRelativistic nuclear physics and quantum chromodynamics.

In particular, we highlight the contrast between the results obtained from linear perturbation theory which can be justified provided switching effects are properly accounted for, and the nonperturbative effects from available analytic expressions which incorporate the backreaction effects of the quantum field on the detector behavior.

The shape of the cavities can be chosen to yield both regular and chaotic dynamics in the classical limit. We find that certain pointer states about classical periodic orbits can exist, which are signatures of relativistic quantum Darwinism (RQD). These localized states suppress quantum tunneling, and the effect becomes less severe as the underlying classical dynamics in the cavity is chaotic, leading to regularization of quantum tunneling. Qualitatively similar phenomena have been observed in graphene. A physical theory is developed to explain relativistic quantum Darwinism and its effects based on the spectrum of complex eigenenergies of the non-Hermitian Hamiltonian describing the open cavity system.\n\nDirac's aether in relativistic quantum mechanics\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nPetroni, N.C.; Bari Univ.; Vigier, J.P.\n\n1984-01-01\n\nThe paper concerns Dirac's aether model, based on a stochastic covariant distribution of subquantum motions.

We conducted this study by using the quantum-hydrodynamic model of dense plasmas, incorporating the quantum effects of semiconductor plasma species which include degeneracy pressure, exchange-correlation potential and Bohm potential. Analysis of the quantum characteristics of semiconductor plasma species along with relativistic effect of beam electrons on the dispersion relation of the HAW is given in detail qualitatively and quantitatively by plotting them numerically. It is worth mentioning that the relativistic electron beam (REB) stabilises the HAWs exciting in semiconductor (GaAs) degenerate plasma.\n\nAxioms for quantum mechanics: relativistic causality, retrocausality, and the existence of a classical limit\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nRohrlich, Daniel\n\nY. Aharonov and A. Shimony both conjectured that two axioms - relativistic causality (``no superluminal signalling'') and nonlocality - so nearly contradict each other that only quantum mechanics reconciles them. Can we indeed derive quantum mechanics, at least in part, from these two axioms? No: ``PR-box'' correlations show that quantum correlations are not the most nonlocal correlations consistent with relativistic causality. Here we replace ``nonlocality'' with ``retrocausality'' and supplement the axioms of relativistic causality and retrocausality with a natural and minimal third axiom: the existence of a classical limit, in which macroscopic observables commute. That is, just as quantum mechanics has a classical limit, so must any generalization of quantum mechanics. In this limit, PR-box correlations violaterelativistic causality. Generalized to all stronger-than-quantum bipartite correlations, this result is a derivation of Tsirelson's bound (a theorem of quantum mechanics) from the three axioms of relativistic causality, retrocausality and the existence of a classical limit. Although the derivation does not assume quantum mechanics, it points to the Hilbert space structure that underlies quantum correlations. I thank the John Templeton Foundation (Project ID 43297) and the Israel Science Foundation (Grant No. 1190/13) for support.\n\nA New Perspective on Relativistic Quantum Mechanics\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nKong, Otto C W\n\n2011-01-01\n\nBased on a linear realization formulation of a quantum relativity, - proposed relativity for 'quantum space-time', we introduce the new Poincare-Snyder relativity and Snyder relativity as relativities in between the latter and the well known Galilean and Einstein cases. While there is supposed to be not separate notion of classical and quantum mechanics at the level of the very unconventional quantum relativity, the Poincare-Snyder relativity is more like a mathematically extended form of Einstein relativity on which we can write down a formal canonical classical and quantum mechanics. We discuss how the Poincare-Snyder relativity may provide a stronger framework for the description of the usual (Einstein) relativistic quantum mechanics and present a first look of the interesting picture from the new perspective.\n\nOptimization of a relativistic quantum mechanical engine.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nPeÃ±a, Francisco J; FerrÃ©, Michel; Orellana, P A; Rojas, RenÃ© G; Vargas, P\n\n2016-08-01\n\nWe present an optimal analysis for a quantum mechanical engine working between two energy baths within the framework of relativistic quantum mechanics, adopting a first-order correction. This quantum mechanical engine, with the direct energy leakage between the energy baths, consists of two adiabatic and two isoenergetic processes and uses a three-level system of two noninteracting fermions as its working substance. Assuming that the potential wall moves at a finite speed, we derive the expression of power output and, in particular, reproduce the expression for the efficiency at maximum power.\n\nA signed particle formulation of non-relativistic quantum mechanics\n\nEnergy Technology Data Exchange (ETDEWEB)\n\nSellier, Jean Michel, E-mail: jeanmichel.sellier@parallel.bas.bg\n\n2015-09-15\n\nA formulation of non-relativistic quantum mechanics in terms of Newtonian particles is presented in the shape of a set of three postulates. In this new theory, quantum systems are described by ensembles of signed particles which behave as field-less classical objects which carry a negative or positive sign and interact with an external potential by means of creation and annihilation events only. This approach is shown to be a generalization of the signed particle Wigner Monte Carlo method which reconstructs the time-dependent Wigner quasi-distribution function of a system and, therefore, the corresponding SchrÃ¶dinger time-dependent wave-function. Its classical limit is discussed and a physical interpretation, based on experimental evidences coming from quantum tomography, is suggested. Moreover, in order to show the advantages brought by this novel formulation, a straightforward extension to relativistic effects is discussed. To conclude, quantum tunnelling numerical experiments are performed to show the validity of the suggested approach.\n\nInternational finance, LÃ©vy distributions, and the econophysics of exchange rates\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nDa Silva, Sergio; Matsushita, Raul; Gleria, Iram; Figueiredo, Annibal; Rathie, Pushpa\n\n2005-06-01\n\nThis paper surveys the developments in the field of international finance, in particular the research of economists on foreign exchange rates.

Complete investigation of a charged relativistic particle motion in the Coulomb field is carried out. Subcritical as well as supercritical cases are considered. In the course of investigation of the charged scalar particle in the Coulomb field the diagonalization of the quadratic hamiltonian describing the charged scalar quantized field interaction with the external Coulomb field has taken place. Mathematically this problem is bound to the construction of self-conjugated expansions of the symmetric operator. The construction of such expansion is necessary at any small external field magnitude [ru\n\nChaos in Dirac Electron Optics: Emergence of a Relativistic Quantum Chimera.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nXu, Hong-Ya; Wang, Guang-Lei; Huang, Liang; Lai, Ying-Cheng\n\n2018-03-23\n\nWe uncover a remarkable quantum scattering phenomenon in two-dimensional Dirac material systems where the manifestations of both classically integrable and chaotic dynamics emerge simultaneously and are electrically controllable.

The phenomenon mimics a chimera state in classical complex dynamical systems but here in a relativistic quantum setting-henceforth the term \"Dirac quantum chimera,\" associated with which are physical phenomena with potentially significant applications such as enhancement of spin polarization, unusual coexisting quasibound states for distinct spin configurations, and spin selective caustics.

This is not the case for relativistic quantum mechanics, however, for which both the Klein-Gordon and Dirac wave equations result in strange and counterintuitive wavepacket behaviors, even for free-particle Gaussians. These behaviors include zitterbewegung and other interference effects. As a potential remedy, this paper explores a new trajectory-based formulation of quantum mechanics, in which the wavefunction plays no role [Phys. Rev. X, 4, 040002 (2014)]. Quantum states are represented as ensembles of trajectories, whose mutual interaction is the source of all quantum effects observed in natureâsuggesting a âmany interacting worldsâ interpretation. It is shown that the relativistic generalization of the trajectory-based formulation results in well-behaved free-particle Gaussian wavepacket solutions. In particular, probability density is positive and well-localized everywhere, and its spatial integral is conserved over timeâin any inertial frame. Finally, the ensemble-averaged wavepacket motion is along a straight line path through spacetime. In this manner, the pathologies of the wave-based relativistic quantum theory, as applied to wavepacket propagation, are avoided.\n\nLorentz-covariant reduced-density-operator theory for relativistic-quantum-information processing\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nAhn, Doyeol; Lee, Hyuk-jae; Hwang, Sung Woo\n\n2003-01-01\n\nIn this paper, we derived a Lorentz-covariant quantum Liouville equation for the density operator which describes the relativistic-quantum-information processing from Tomonaga-Schwinger equation and an exact formal solution for the reduced density operator is obtained using the projector operator technique and the functional calculus. When all the members of the family of the hypersurfaces become flat hyperplanes, it is shown that our results agree with those of the nonrelativistic case, which is valid only in some specified reference frame. To show that our formulation can be applied to practical problems, we derived the polarization of the vacuum in quantum electrodynamics up to the second order. The formulation presented in this work is general and could be applied to related fields such as quantum electrodynamics and relativistic statistical mechanics\n\nEssentials of econophysics modelling\n\nCERN Document Server\n\nSlanina, Frantisek\n\n2014-01-01\n\nThis book is a course in methods and models rooted in physics and used in modelling economic and social phenomena. It covers the discipline of econophysics, which creates an interface between physics and economics. Besides the main theme, it touches on the theory of complex networks and simulations of social phenomena in general. After a brief historical introduction, the book starts with a list of basic empirical data and proceeds to thorough investigation of mathematical and computer models. Many of the models are based on hypotheses of the behaviour of simplified agents. These comprise strategic thinking, imitation, herding, and the gem of econophysics, the so-called minority game. At the same time, many other models view the economic processes as interactions of inanimate particles. Here, the methods of physics are especially useful. Examples of systems modelled in such a way include books of stock-market orders, and redistribution of wealth among individuals.

Phys. J. C 61 111-39), we consider here a classification of orientable relativistic quantum objects in 3+1 dimensions. In such a classification, one uses a maximal set of ten commuting operators (generators of left and right transformations) in the space of functions on the Poincare group. In addition to the usual six quantum numbers related to external symmetries (given by left generators), there appear additional quantum numbers related to internal symmetries (given by right generators). Spectra of internal and external symmetry operators are interrelated, which, however, does not contradict the Coleman-Mandula no-go theorem. We believe that the proposed approach can be useful for the description of elementary spinning particles considered as orientable objects. In particular, it gives a group-theoretical interpretation of some facts of the existing phenomenological classification of spinning particles.\n\nClassification of quantum relativistic orientable objects\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nGitman, D M; Shelepin, A L\n\n2011-01-01\n\nExtending our previous work 'Fields on the Poincare group and quantum description of orientable objects' (Gitman and Shelepin 2009 Eur. Phys. J. C 61 111-39), we consider here a classification of orientable relativistic quantum objects in 3+1 dimensions. In such a classification, one uses a maximal set of ten commuting operators (generators of left and right transformations) in the space of functions on the Poincare group. In addition to the usual six quantum numbers related to external symmetries (given by left generators), there appear additional quantum numbers related to internal symmetries (given by right generators). Spectra of internal and external symmetry operators are interrelated, which, however, does not contradict the Coleman-Mandula no-go theorem. We believe that the proposed approach can be useful for the description of elementary spinning particles considered as orientable objects. In particular, it gives a group-theoretical interpretation of some facts of the existing phenomenological classification of spinning particles.\n\nEconophysics: A challenge to econometricians\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nZapart, Christopher A.\n\n2015-02-01\n\nThe study contrasts mainstream economics-operating on time scales of hours and days-with behavioural finance, econophysics and high-frequency trading, more applicable to short-term time scales of the order of minutes and seconds. We show how the central theoretical assumption underpinning prevailing economic theories is violated on small time scales. We also demonstrate how an alternative behavioural econophysics can model reactions of market participants to short-term movements in foreign exchange markets and, in a direct contradiction of the orthodox economics, design a rudimentary IsingFX automated trading system. By replacing costly human forex dealers with banks of Field-Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) devices that implement in hardware high-frequency behavioural trading models of the type described here, brokerages and forex liquidity providers can expect to gain significant reductions in operating costs.\n\nUps and downs of economics and econophysics â Facebook forecast\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nGajic, Nenad; Budinski-Petkovic, Ljuba\n\n2013-01-01\n\nWhat is econophysics and its relationship with economics? What is the state of economics after the global economic crisis, and is there a future for the paradigm of market equilibrium, with imaginary perfect competition and rational agents? Can the next paradigm of economics adopt important assumptions derived from econophysics models: that markets are chaotic systems, striving to extremes as bubbles and crashes show, with psychologically motivated, statistically predictable individual behaviors? Is the future of econophysics, as predicted here, to disappear and become a part of economics? A good test of the current state of econophysics and its methods is the valuation of Facebook immediately after the initial public offering - this forecast indicates that Facebook is highly overvalued, and its IPO valuation of 104 billion dollars is mostly the new financial bubble based on the expectations of unlimited growth, although itâs easy to prove that Facebook is close to the upper limit of its users.\n\nRelativistic n-body wave equations in scalar quantum field theory\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nEmami-Razavi, Mohsen\n\n2006-01-01\n\nThe variational method in a reformulated Hamiltonian formalism of Quantum Field Theory (QFT) is used to derive relativistic n-body wave equations for scalar particles (bosons) interacting via a massive or massless mediating scalar field (the scalar Yukawa model). Simple Fock-space variational trial states are used to derive relativistic n-body wave equations. The equations are shown to have the Schroedinger non-relativistic limits, with Coulombic interparticle potentials in the case of a massless mediating field and Yukawa interparticle potentials in the case of a massive mediating field. Some examples of approximate ground state solutions of the n-body relativistic equations are obtained for various strengths of coupling, for both massive and massless mediating fields\n\nPropagation of a TE surface mode in a relativistic electron beamâquantum plasma system\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nAbdel Aziz, M.\n\n2012-01-01\n\nThe dispersion properties of a transverse electric (TE) surface waves propagating along the interface between a magneto-quantum plasmaârelativistic beam system and vacuum are studied by using the quantum hydrodynamic model. The general dispersion relations are derived and analyzed in some special cases of interest. Moreover, the effects of density gradients for the beam and plasma on the dispersion properties of surface waves are investigated. The kind of dispersion relations depends strongly on the ambient magnetic field B o via the gyro-frequency Ï c , the quantum parameters, and the width of the plasma layer as well as the relativistic factor for the electron beam. It is found that the quantum effects play a crucial role to facilitate the propagation of TE surface waves. -- Highlights: âº Propagation of TE surface waves on bounded magneto-quantum plasma by relativistic beam is studied. âº The quantum plasma consists of transitional layer adjacent to uniform layer. âº Influence of quantum effects on the propagation of TE surface waves are taken into account. âº Effects of homogeneity and inhomogeneity for beam on TE surface waves are considered. âº It is found that quantum effects facilitate the propagation of TE surface modes.\n\nRelativistic predictive quantum potential: the N-body case\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nGaruccio, A.; Kyprianidis, A.; Vigier, J.P.\n\n1984-01-01\n\nIt is generalized to a system of N scalar particles the casual description with action at a distance already given for two-particle systems in EPR type of experiments. The many body quantum potential is shown to satisfy the predictivity constraints established by Droz-Vincent for relativistic mechanics\n\nThe connection of two-particle relativistic quantum mechanics with the Bethe-Salpeter equation\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nSazdjian, H.\n\n1986-02-01\n\nWe show the formal equivalence between the wave equations of two-particle relativistic quantum mechanics, based on the manifestly covariant hamiltonian formalism with constraints, and the Bethe-Salpeter equation. This is achieved by algebraically transforming the latter so as to separate it into two independent equations which match the equations of hamiltonian relativistic quantum mechanics. The first equation determines the relative time evolution of the system, while the second one yields a three-dimensional eigenvalue equation. A connection is thus established between the Bethe-Salpeter wave function and its kernel on the one hand and the quantum mechanical wave function and interaction potential on the other. For the sector of solutions of the Bethe-Salpeter equation having non-relativistic limits, this relationship can be evaluated in perturbation theory. We also device a generalized form of the instantaneous approximation which simplifies the various expressions involved in the above relations. It also permits the evaluation of the normalization condition of the quantum mechanical wave function as a three-dimensional integral\n\nSolution of relativistic quantum optics problems using clusters of graphical processing units\n\nEnergy Technology Data Exchange (ETDEWEB)\n\nGordon, D.F., E-mail: daviel.gordon@nrl.navy.mil; Hafizi, B.; Helle, M.H.\n\n2014-06-15\n\nNumerical solution of relativistic quantum optics problems requires high performance computing due to the rapid oscillations in a relativistic wavefunction. Clusters of graphical processing units are used to accelerate the computation of a time dependent relativistic wavefunction in an arbitrary external potential. The stationary states in a Coulomb potential and uniform magnetic field are determined analytically and numerically, so that they can used as initial conditions in fully time dependent calculations. Relativistic energy levels in extreme magnetic fields are recovered as a means of validation. The relativistic ionization rate is computed for an ion illuminated by a laser field near the usual barrier suppression threshold, and the ionizing wavefunction is displayed.\n\nQuantum Geometry: Relativistic energy approach to cooperative electron-nucleary-transition spectrum\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nÐÐ»ÑÐ³Ð° Ð®ÑÑÐµÐ²Ð½Ð° Ð¥ÐµÑÐµÐ»Ð¸ÑÑ\n\n2014-11-01\n\nFull Text Available An advanced relativistic energy approach is presented and applied to calculating parameters of electron-nuclear 7-transition spectra of nucleus in the atom. The intensities of the spectral satellites are defined in the relativistic version of the energy approach (S-matrix formalism, and gauge-invariant quantum-electrodynamical perturbation theory with the Dirac-Kohn-Sham density-functional zeroth approximation.\n\nEconophysics: Past and present\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nde Area LeÃ£o Pereira, Eder Johnson; da Silva, Marcus Fernandes; Pereira, H. B. B.\n\n2017-05-01\n\nThis paper provides a brief historical review of the relationship between economics and physics, beginning with Adam Smith being influenced by Isaac Newton's ideas up to the present day including the new econophysics discipline and some of the tools applied to the economy. Thus, this work is expected to motivate new researchers who are interested in this new discipline.\n\nQuantum theoretical physics is statistical and relativistic\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nHarding, C.\n\n1980-01-01\n\nA new theoretical framework for the quantum mechanism is presented. It is based on a strict deterministic behavior of single systems. The conventional QM equation, however, is found to describe statistical results of many classical systems. It will be seen, moreover, that a rigorous synthesis of our theory requires relativistic kinematics. So, QM is not only a classical statistical theory, it is, of necessity, a relativistic theory. The equation of the theory does not just duplicate QM, it indicates an inherent nonlinearity in QM which is subject to experimental verification. It is shown, therefore, that conventional QM is a corollary of classical deterministic principles. It is suggested that this concept of nature conflicts with that prevalent in modern physics. (author)\n\nWeyl consistency conditions in non-relativistic quantum field theory\n\nEnergy Technology Data Exchange (ETDEWEB)\n\nPal, Sridip; Grinstein, BenjamÃ­n [Department of Physics, University of California,San Diego, 9500 Gilman Drive, La Jolla, CA 92093 (United States)\n\n2016-12-05\n\nWeyl consistency conditions have been used in unitary relativistic quantum field theory to impose constraints on the renormalization group flow of certain quantities. We classify the Weyl anomalies and their renormalization scheme ambiguities for generic non-relativistic theories in 2+1 dimensions with anisotropic scaling exponent z=2; the extension to other values of z are discussed as well. We give the consistency conditions among these anomalies. As an application we find several candidates for a C-theorem. We comment on possible candidates for a C-theorem in higher dimensions.\n\nMultiple-event probability in general-relativistic quantum mechanics\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nHellmann, Frank; Mondragon, Mauricio; Perez, Alejandro; Rovelli, Carlo\n\n2007-01-01\n\nWe discuss the definition of quantum probability in the context of 'timeless' general-relativistic quantum mechanics. In particular, we study the probability of sequences of events, or multievent probability. In conventional quantum mechanics this can be obtained by means of the 'wave function collapse' algorithm. We first point out certain difficulties of some natural definitions of multievent probability, including the conditional probability widely considered in the literature. We then observe that multievent probability can be reduced to single-event probability, by taking into account the quantum nature of the measuring apparatus. In fact, by exploiting the von-Neumann freedom of moving the quantum/classical boundary, one can always trade a sequence of noncommuting quantum measurements at different times, with an ensemble of simultaneous commuting measurements on the joint system+apparatus system. This observation permits a formulation of quantum theory based only on single-event probability, where the results of the wave function collapse algorithm can nevertheless be recovered. The discussion also bears on the nature of the quantum collapse\n\nEcological Econophysics for Degrowth\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nSalvador Pueyo\n\n2014-05-01\n\nFull Text Available This paper outlines a synthesis of ecological economics with econophysics and other complexity approaches to economics. Arguably, the resulting âecological econophysicsâ will be scientifically sounder than mainstream economics and much better suited to addressing a major challenge of our times: the development of democratically-based policies to reduce economic throughput to an environmentally sustainable level without triggering economic crises and without excluding part of the worldâs population, i.e., to implement degrowth. Degrowth will need major structural changes, which leads us to question whether there are limits to the malleability of the economic systemâs architecture. A fundamental limit will be encountered if, as suggested by the physics of complexity, long-lasting complex systems always occur midway between an ordered and a disordered state. There is much evidence that this hypothesis holds and that the current economic system satisfies this condition. However, this does not mean that the problems posed by this system should be unavoidable. Ecological econophysics gives clues to identifying alternative economic systems that would also function between order and chaos, but which would have radically different implications for environmental sustainability and social justice.\n\nClassical particle limit of non-relativistic quantum mechanics\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nZucchini, R.\n\n1984-01-01\n\nWe study the classical particle limit of non-relativistic quantum mechanics. We show that the unitary group describing the evolution of the quantum fluctuation around any classical phase orbit has a classical limit as h â 0 in the strong operator topology for a very large class of time independent scalar and vector potentials, which in practice covers all physically interesting cases. We also show that the mean values of the quantum mechanical position and velocity operators on suitable states, obtained by time evolution of the product of a Weyl operator centred around the large coordinates and momenta and a fixed n-independent wave function, converge to the solution of the classical equations with initial data as h â 0 for a broad class of repulsive interactions\n\nSome Mathematical Structures Including Simplified Non-Relativistic Quantum Teleportation Equations and Special Relativity\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nWoesler, Richard\n\n2007-01-01\n\nThe computations of the present text with non-relativistic quantum teleportation equations and special relativity are totally speculative, physically correct computations can be done using quantum field theory, which remain to be done in future. Proposals for what might be called statistical time loop experiments with, e.g., photon polarization states are described when assuming the simplified non-relativistic quantum teleportation equations and special relativity. However, a closed time loop would usually not occur due to phase incompatibilities of the quantum states. Histories with such phase incompatibilities are called inconsistent ones in the present text, and it is assumed that only consistent histories would occur. This is called an exclusion principle for inconsistent histories, and it would yield that probabilities for certain measurement results change. Extended multiple parallel experiments are proposed to use this statistically for transmission of classical information over distances, and regarding time. Experiments might be testable in near future. However, first a deeper analysis, including quantum field theory, remains to be done in future\n\nCausal localizations in relativistic quantum mechanics\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nCastrigiano, Domenico P. L.; Leiseifer, Andreas D.\n\n2015-07-01\n\nCausal localizations describe the position of quantum systems moving not faster than light. They are constructed for the systems with finite spinor dimension. At the center of interest are the massive relativistic systems. For every positive mass, there is the sequence of Dirac tensor-localizations, which provides a complete set of inequivalent irreducible causal localizations. They obey the principle of special relativity and are fully PoincarÃ© covariant. The boosters are determined by the causal position operator and the other PoincarÃ© generators. The localization with minimal spinor dimension is the Dirac localization. Thus, the Dirac equation is derived here as a mere consequence of the principle of causality. Moreover, the higher tensor-localizations, not known so far, follow from Dirac's localization by a simple construction. The probability of localization for positive energy states results to be described by causal positive operator valued (PO-) localizations, which are the traces of the causal localizations on the subspaces of positive energy. These causal PoincarÃ© covariant PO-localizations for every irreducible massive relativistic system were, all the more, not known before. They are shown to be separated. Hence, the positive energy systems can be localized within every open region by a suitable preparation as accurately as desired. Finally, the attempt is made to provide an interpretation of the PO-localization operators within the frame of conventional quantum mechanics attributing an important role to the negative energy states.\n\nThe microcanonical ensemble of the ideal relativistic quantum gas with angular momentum conservation\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nBecattini, F.; Ferroni, L.\n\n2007-01-01\n\nWe derive the microcanonical partition function of the ideal relativistic quantum gas with fixed intrinsic angular momentum as an expansion over fixed multiplicities. We developed a group theoretical approach by generalizing known projection techniques to the Poincare group. Our calculation is carried out in a quantum field framework and applies to particles with any spin. It extends known results in the literature in that it does not introduce any large volume approximation, and it takes particle spin fully into account. We provide expressions of the microcanonical partition function at fixed multiplicities in the limiting classical case of large volumes and large angular momenta and in the grand-canonical ensemble. We also derive the microcanonical partition function of the ideal relativistic quantum gas with fixed parity. (orig.)\n\nTen years after \"Worrying trends in econophysics\": developments and current challenges\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nOrmerod, Paul\n\n2016-12-01\n\nEconophysics has made a number of important additions to scientific knowledge. Yet it continues to lack influence with both economists and policy makers. Ten years ago, I and three other economists sympathetic to econophysics wrote a paper on worrying trends within the discipline. For example, its lack of awareness of the economics literature, and shortfalls in the use of statistical analysis. These continue to be obstacles to wider acceptance by economists. Like all agents, policy makers respond to incentives, and economists understand this very well. Much of the econophysics community appears to think that simply doing good science is sufficient to have the work recognised, rather than relating to the motivations and incentives of policy makers. Nevertheless, econophysics now has three major opportunities to advance knowledge in areas where policy makers perceive weaknesses in what they are presented with by economists. All can benefit from the analysis of Big Data. The first is a core model of agent behaviour which is more relevant to cyber society than the rational agent model of economics. Second, extending our understanding of the business cycle, primarily by incorporating the importance of networks into models. Third, devising proper measures of output in cyber society.\n\nRelativistic rotators: a quantum mechanical de Sitter bundle\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nBoehm, A.\n\n1976-02-01\n\nIf de Sitter fiber bundle over space time is the classical picture of hadrons then for a quantum mechanical description one has to generalize the concept of a principal fiber bundle to a bundle that contains the representation of the group of motion. This idea is related to the relativistic rotator model, and the radius of the de Sitter fiber is determined from the experimental hadron spectrum\n\nDirac particle in a box, and relativistic quantum Zeno dynamics\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nMenon, Govind; Belyi, Sergey\n\n2004-01-01\n\nAfter developing a complete set of eigenfunctions for a Dirac particle restricted to a box, the quantum Zeno dynamics of a relativistic system is considered. The evolution of a continuously observed quantum mechanical system is governed by the theorem put forth by Misra and Sudarshan. One of the conditions for quantum Zeno dynamics to be manifest is that the Hamiltonian is semi-bounded. This Letter analyzes the effects of continuous observation of a particle whose time evolution is generated by the Dirac Hamiltonian. The theorem by Misra and Sudarshan is not applicable here since the Dirac operator is not semi-bounded\n\nChaos in Dirac electron optics: Emergence of a relativistic quantum chimera\n\nOpenAIRE\n\nXu, Hong-Ya; Wang, Guang-Lei; Huang, Liang; Lai, Ying-Cheng\n\n2018-01-01\n\nWe uncover a remarkable quantum scattering phenomenon in two-dimensional Dirac material systems where the manifestations of both classically integrable and chaotic dynamics emerge simultaneously and are electrically controllable. The distinct relativistic quantum fingerprints associated with different electron spin states are due to a physical mechanism analogous to chiroptical effect in the presence of degeneracy breaking. The phenomenon mimics a chimera state in classical complex dynamical ...\n\nLocal U(2,2) Symmetry in Relativistic Quantum Mechanics\n\nOpenAIRE\n\nFinster, Felix\n\n1997-01-01\n\nLocal gauge freedom in relativistic quantum mechanics is derived from a measurement principle for space and time.

Further, this problem is discussed from the point of view of the perturbation theory. (L.C.) [pt\n\nTheoretical physics vol. 2. Quantum mechanics, relativistic quantum mechanics, quantum field theory, elementar-particle theory, thermodynamics and statistics\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nRebhan, E.\n\n2005-01-01\n\nThe present second volume treats quantum mechanics, relativistic quantum mechanics, the foundations of quantum-field and elementary-particle theory as well as thermodynamics and statistics. Both volumes comprehend all fields, which are usually offered in a course about theoretical physics. In all treated fields a very careful introduction to the basic natural laws forms the starting point, whereby it is thoroughly analysed, which of them is based on empirics, which is logically deducible, and which role play basic definitions. Extendingly the matter extend of the corresponding courses starting from the relativistic quantum theory an introduction to the elementary particles is developed. All problems are very thoroughly and such extensively studied, that each step is singularly reproducible. On motivation and good understandability is cared much about. The mixing of mathematical difficulties with problems of physical nature often obstructive in the learning is so circumvented, that important mathematical methods are presented in own chapters (for instance Hilbert spaces, Lie groups). By means of many examples and problems (for a large part with solutions) the matter worked out is deepened and exercised. Developments, which are indeed important, but seem for the first approach abandonable, are pursued in excurses. This book starts from courses, which the author has held at the Heinrich-Heine university in Duesseldorf, and was in many repetitions fitted to the requirements of the students. It is conceived in such a way, that it is also after the study suited as dictionary or for the regeneration\n\nSome connections between relativistic classical mechanics, statistical mechanics, and quantum field theory\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nRemler, E.A.\n\n1977-01-01\n\nA gauge-invariant version of the Wigner representation is used to relate relativistic mechanics, statistical mechanics, and quantum field theory in the context of the electrodynamics of scalar particles. A unified formulation of quantum field theory and statistical mechanics is developed which clarifies the physics interpretation of the single-particle Wigner function. A covariant form of Ehrenfest's theorem is derived. Classical electrodynamics is derived from quantum field theory after making a random-phase approximation. The validity of this approximation is discussed\n\nComputational derivation of quantum relativist electromagnetic systems with forward-backward space-time shifts\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nDubois, Daniel M.\n\n2000-01-01\n\nThis paper is a continuation of our preceding paper dealing with computational derivation of the Klein-Gordon quantum relativist equation and the Schroedinger quantum equation with forward and backward space-time shifts. The first part introduces forward and backward derivatives for discrete and continuous systems. Generalized complex discrete and continuous derivatives are deduced. The second part deduces the Klein-Gordon equation from the space-time complex continuous derivatives. These derivatives take into account forward-backward space-time shifts related to an internal phase velocity u. The internal group velocity v is related to the speed of light u.v=c 2 and to the external group and phase velocities u.v=v g .v p . Without time shift, the Schroedinger equation is deduced, with a supplementary term, which could represent a reference potential. The third part deduces the Quantum Relativist Klein-Gordon equation for a particle in an electromagnetic field\n\nOn some solvable models in non-relativistic quantum mechanics\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nShabani, J.; Shayo, L.K.\n\n1985-11-01\n\nThe theory of self-adjoint extensions is employed to generalize some previous results in non-relativistic quantum interactions.
