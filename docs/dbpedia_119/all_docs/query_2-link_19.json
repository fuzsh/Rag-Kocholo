        "text": "The definition of normative is exploring how the norms of a certain thing compare to its idealized form. Through normative analysis, the societal norms of government are clearly delineated. Normative political theory is focused on discovering how the cultural, social, and community values of citizens perceive the ideal form of government and influence political phenomena. It also compares the current form of government to that form and explores how improvements to the existing form of government can be made. The main elements of normative political theory are values and ideals. In other words, this type of political theory is based on the people and what they believe is the best course of action for the government.\n\nSome political theorists propose that some government functions could be better fulfilled by non-government entities. These include private businesses, charities, and volunteer organizations. Privatized institutions stepping into the sphere of government is referred to as ''non-state governance.''\n\nExample of Normative Theory\n\nThere are many examples of the normative approach to political theory. One example of normative political theory would be an analysis of the cultural and social values that influenced the creation of the current government of Afghanistan under the confederation of Taliban warlords. This would necessarily include an analysis of the dominant religious and cultural traditions and norms in the country. Normative political analysis in this country would explore how major elements of Islam, such as religious xenophobia, rejection of certain types of leadership, attitudes towards women, and a lack of trust of political leaders, contributed to the failure of a previously strong centralized government.\n\nPolitical Theory Defined\n\nElaine and Nathan are professors of political science at a university. They both focus their studies on political theory, which is the study of the ideas and values concerning concepts of the state, power, individuals, groups and the relationship between them. Furthermore, political theory is not only concerned with how these relationships work, but also how they ought to work.\n\nEven though Elaine and Nathan both study political theory, they take different approaches. Let's take a quick look at each.\n\nEmpirical Theory\n\nElaine focuses her studies and research on empirical political theory. In the simplest terms, empirical political theory is focused on explaining 'what is' through observation. In this approach, scholars seek to generate a hypothesis, which is a proposed explanation for some phenomena that can be tested empirically. After formulating a hypothesis, a study will be designed to test the hypothesis. Let's look at an example.\n\nElaine is interested in the role of money in modern Senate elections. She develops a hypothesis that candidates who spend more money on their campaigns than their opponents will win. Elaine then goes about designing a study to test her hypothesis by examining election results and campaign finance reporting disclosures. Elaine must be careful to control for other variables that may affect the result, such as incumbency, and focus on states with a relatively equal balance of political party membership. After collecting the data, she will determine through statistical analysis if it tends to support or not support her hypothesis.\n\nNormative Theory\n\nNathan's focus is on normative political theory. While empirical political theory is concerned with 'what is,' normative political theory is concerned with 'what ought to be.' In other words, normative political theory is concerned about how the world should be and focuses on the exploration of values and what should be done based upon those values.\n\nNathan is also interested in the role of money in democratic elections. However, remember that his focus is on normative theory. So while Elaine wants to explore whether candidates that spend more, win more, Nathan explores whether the influence of money in modern campaigns is a threat to the American values of democratic choice and fair, open elections."
