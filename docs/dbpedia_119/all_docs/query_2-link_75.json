        "text": "In many countries, limitations upon the public funds available for infrastructure have led governments to invite private sector entities to enter into long-term contractual agreements for the financing, construction and/or operation of capital intensive projects. For the public procurer, there is an obvious need to ensure that value-for-money has been achieved. To the project sponsors, such ventures are characterised by low equity in the project vehicle and a reliance on direct revenues to cover operating and capital costs, and service debt finance provided by banks and other financiers. Risk evaluation is complex, requiring the analysis of risk from the different perspectives of the public and private sector entities. This paper analyses the principles involved, drawing on practical experience of evaluating such projects to present a framework for assessing the risks, and using as illustration a case study of a waste water treatment facility in Scotland which is typical of most PPP projects.\n\nA public-private partnership (PPP) can be defined as a cooperative arrangement between the public and private sectors for the sharing of the risks and responsibilities for the provision of asset-based (infrastructure) services. The long-term contractual nature of the business relationship leads to difficult financial issues, related to taxation, cash flow budgeting and disclosure rules. In addition, the number of entities with an interest in the outcome puts a premium on accountability in the broad sense. Neither traditional models of public sector accountability nor those developed for private sector entities are adequate. A new paradigm is required which takes into account the complexity of the risk-sharing mechanisms and identifies clearly the rights and responsibilities of the various partners.\n\nPublicprivate partnerships (PPPs) offer one way of resolving the large cost overruns and delays in traditional public procurement methods for infrastructure, by creating appropriate incentives among contracting partners. However, with the growth of PPPs, the role of government is changing, and the public sector must restructure itself for the new governance and administrative requirements involved as managers of contractual relationships. In this paper a contractual management and reporting regime is developed to address a number of these governance issues. Special emphasis is given to establishing, first, key reporting requirements for the meeting of performance quality standards and, second, a performance monitoring system for assessing the health of the contracting enterprise and the risk of defaultan important factor when government is unable to walk away from service delivery. In contract management terms, monitoring information and reporting is an ongoing activity that has to feed into a review and assessment process."
