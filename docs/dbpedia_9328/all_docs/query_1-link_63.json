        "text": "GEOGRAPHY\n\n1. Serbia: The Cross-road of Europe\n\nSerbia covers about 34,116 square miles (88,361 square kilometres) in south-eastern Europe bordering the Republic of Montenegro, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, Hungary, Romania, Bulgaria, Macedonia and Albania.\n\nSerbia is referred to as the cross roads of Europe. The international roads and railways passing down its river valleys make up the shortest link between Western and Central Europe, on one side, and the Middle East, Asia and Africa, on the other. This explains the geopolitical importance of its territory. These roads follow the course of the valley of the river Morava and Vardar to Thessaloniki; the other, the river Nisava up to Sofia and Istanbul.\n\n2. Landscapes\n\nNorthern Serbia is mainly flat, while its central and southern areas consist of highlands and mountains. The flatlands are mainly in Vojvodina (the Pannonian Plain and its rim: Macva, the Sava Valley, the Morava Valley, Stig and the Negotin Marches in Eastern Serbia).\n\n55 per cent of Serbia is arable land, and 27 per cent is forested. Of its mountains 15 reach heights of over 2,000 meters, the highest being Djeravica in the Prokletija range (2,656 m).\n\nThe terrain of Serbia is extremely varied:\n\n- to the north, rich fertile plains; to the east, limestone ranges and basins;\n\n- to the South-east, ancient mountains and hills;\n\n- to the South-west, extremely high shoreline with no islands off the coast.\n\nA) Mountains\n\nThe Pannonian Plains lie in northern Serbia. The region is mostly flat, with some low hills. Still, Serbia is mostly mountainous, being ringed by the Dinaric Alps on the west, the Sar Mountains and the North Albanian Alps (Prokletije) on the south, and the Balkan and Carpathian mountains on the east. Many peaks in these ranges surpass 6,000 feet (1,800 m) in elevation.\n\nIf you climb up the Stara Planina, Prokletije, Rudnik, Jastrebac, Golija and Cer mountain you might say you have reached the top of world since all these peaks taken together are higher than Mount Everest. And all you need to climb them is a pair of comfortable shoes.\n\nNature took great pains to bestow many hills and valleys to this country, to sculpture the mountain chains, to chisel the canyons and the gorges. If art takes after nature, then it is possible, on every slope in Serbia, for art to be jealous of its master.\n\nIf you climb up the Stara Planina, Prokletije, Rudnik, Jastrebac, Golija and Cer mountains you might say you have reached the top of world since all these peaks taken together are higher than Mount Everest. And all you need to climb them is a pair of comfortable shoes.\n\nEvery walk you take can end with an armload of flowers or herbs and a basket of mushrooms or forest fruits.\n\nIn Kopaonik and Tara: never get time off for resting. In spring and summer, you can enjoy tennis, horseback-riding, swimming, mountain climbing ... If you do your climbing up in summer, do your climbing down in winter by skis. The 100 square kilometres of verdant Kopaonik turns into a modern and very enjoyable ski centre in winter. Kopaonik is the mountain of contrasts and of all seasons, with monasteries on its slopes, ice-cold water springs at its foot and the sun at its peaks.\n\nBrezovica, a locality on the northern side of the Sara mountain, offers skiing above the clouds, at more than 2,000 meters above sea level. Once the skiers leave Brezovica, the hunting and angling enthusiasts occupy it.\n\nProkletije, the Alps of the Southern Europe, has the highest, the steepest peaks in Serbia.\n\nDivcibare, a plateau on the Maljen Mountain, is white throughout the year, half a year because of the narcissuses, the other half because of the snow...\n\nOn the slopes Zlatibor, a large recreation centre, sports teams practice for strenuous competitions, while the skiers show their skills on the tracks of Tornik. Zlatibor village of Sirogojno, a unique ethnic park in Serbia, famous for its knitters who for generations passed over the tradition of wool spinning and knitting.\n\nB) Rivers\n\nA number of rivers flow through Serbia. They include the Danube, one of Europe's longest waterways. The Danube flows southeast to the Black Sea. The river Morava runs north through the hills of southern and central Serbia and then empties into the Danube.\n\nSerbian rivers belong to the basins of the Black, Adriatic and Aegean Seas. Three of them, the Danube, Sava and Tisa, are navigable. The longest river is the Danube, which flows for 588 of its 2,857 kilometres course through Serbia. The river Sava flows eastward, emptying into the Danube at Belgrade. The 50,000 km. of waterways in Serbia has adorned the country with its silver tassels.\n\nThe river Morava winds through the country offering a lot of fish to fishermen. If, instead of a goldfish, you desire to hook in the real gold, the banks of the river Pek are waiting for you.\n\nThere are nice boats crossing the river Tisa and instead sailboats crossing the river Sava.\n\nEvery stream, cascade or fountainhead in Serbia ends in a river, and all the rivers in Serbia (save two) in the Danube. The Danube, parts of which in Serbia remind one of a sea, has always linked us with the world. It is not until it reaches Serbia that the Danube becomes the largest navigable river in Europe.\n\nIn economical terms, the Danube basin has always been extremely important for the development of the country. With the commissioning of the Rhine-Main-Danube Canal in September 1992, the Black Sea and the Near and Far Eastern ports have come much nearer to Europe. Serbia is linked to the Adriatic Sea and Montenegro via Belgrade-Bar railway. For centuries, the great river has been coming to us and leaving us - and is returning to us in the form of electricity. On its way out from the Djerdap canyon the mighty Danube has been tamed and made to serve one of the largest hydroelectric power plants in Europe.\n\nMan took upon himself the duties of nature and created numerous artificial lakes: the lakes of Djerdap, Vlasina, Bor, Zlatar, Srebrno near Veliko Gradiste.\n\n3. Climate\n\nThe climate in Serbia varies greatly. In the north, you will find a continental climate (i.e. cold winter and hot, humid summers with well distributed rainfall); In the centre of Serbia there reigns a continental and Mediterranean climate, whereas to the south, one will find an Adriatic climate along the coast, and hot, dry summers and autumns and relatively cold winters with heavy snowfall inland.\n\nThe Pannonian Plains have cold winters with a freezing wind called a kosava. Summers are dry and hot, with temperatures often rising to about 38 °C. In Belgrade, on the edge of the Pannonian Plains, the average January temperature is 0 °C. The average July temperature is 23 °C. The rest of Serbia has bitterly cold winters with much snow. Heavy rains fall in early summer. Summers are warm in the mountain valleys but cool at higher elevations.\n\n4. Cities\n\nCities organisation: The territorial order of the Republic of Serbia is regulated by the Law on Territorial Organization and Local Self-Government, adopted in the National Assembly on July 24, 1991. Under the Law, the municipalities, cities and settlements make the bases of the territorial organization.\n\nBy its Enactment of 29 January 1992, the Government of the Republic of Serbia defined the state administration affairs that shall be run by the competent Ministries out of their seats, within the districts as regional centres of state authority.\n\nsee table\n\n5.

National Parks.\n\nThe National Parks of Serbia are great natural museums in the open air.\n\nTara With its impassable forests and flower-strewn meadows, waterfalls and streams which disappear in caves. Imagine the memory of the Pancic spruce, endemic to this region of the world only, growing here from the Tertiary! Tara was declared a National Park in 1981. It is in the mountainous region of Western Serbia and it spreads on the Tara and Zvezda mountains, in a large bend of the river Drina. The area of this national park is about 22,000 hectares and its altitude varies from 250 to 1,500 metres a.s.l. The park management office is in Bajina Basta. The national park consists of a group of mountain peaks and areas with deep gorges, the most striking of which is the Drina Gorge. The area is also characterised by karst caves, pits and springs, in addition to many beauty spots.\n\nFruska Gora The verdant island of the Panonian Sea and Serb Mount Athos, devoted to the guarding of dozens of monasteries and 700 species of medical herbs. For the flatlands of Vojvodina, Fruska Gora is an exceptional gift of nature and its greatest decoration. This low mountain, which hugs the banks of the Danube River and stretches in the east-west direction, is about 80 kilometres long. Its highest park Crveni Cot is 539 meters above sea level. The valleys of Fruska Gora are covered with meadows and grain fields, vineyards and orchards spread over its slopes and glades while its higher parts, above 300 meters, are covered by dense deciduous forests. The greatest concentration of linden trees in Europe is in this park, which giving it its distinctive characteristic. About 700 species of medicinal herbs can be found here. Animal life includes deer, mouflons, boar, lynx and marten. The numerous monasteries with their frescoes and libraries situated on picturesque glades on the forest covered mountain represent monuments of exceptional value and beauty.\n\nSara A spacious farm in the open air, with its pastures, traces of the Ice Age at its peaks, mountain lakes, and alpine flowers. The Sara National Park is in the territory of the Autonomous Province of Kosovo and Metohija and it spreads on 38,000 hectares, on the northern slopes of Sar Mountain. What this national boasts in particular are the endemic relict Macedonian pine and white-bark pine, as well as the Alpine rose. As for game, this is the habitat of the lynx, bear, chamois and other species. A locality called \"Gine voda\" is special attraction because the white-bark pine, Macedonian pine, skotch pine, spruce, sycamore... are represented there all on a small area. The Sara National Park abounds in streams and small rivers and it spreads in the municipalities of Urosevac, Suva Reka, Kacanik and Prizren.\n\nDjerdap The main feature and attraction of the Djerdap National Park's natural beauty is the Djerdap gorge - the famous Iron Gate - the grandiose gateway through the southern slopes of the Carpathian mountains where the longest and biggest river accumulation in Yugoslavia is located. The Djerdap gorge, which is some 100 kilometres long (from Golubac to Tekija), is actually a compound river valley made up of four gorges (Gornja klisura, Gospodjin vir, Veliki and Mali kazan and Sipska klisura), separated from each other by ravines. In Gospodjin vir, one of the greatest river depths in the world has been measured (82 m). The cliffs of the canyon in Kazan are about 300 meters high while the riverbed in this part is narrowed down to 150 meters. The territory of the national park is filled with a series of other important features: abundant and diversified animal and especially plant life, attractive surroundings and landscapes, cultural and historical monuments and other anthropogenic tourist attractions, including a lake formed by the erection of a hydroelectric power plant.The national park is dotted with many natural and cultural values which are included in a special protection programme: Lepenski Vir, the 8,000-year-old archaeological site with exceptionally important traces of settlements and the life of Neolithic man, the Golubacki Grad fortress, the fortress in Kladovo, forest reserves and natural monuments.Djerdap National Park has become one of the most visited tourist regions in Serbia especially after the construction of the dam and the formation of the large lake. The gorge and the hydroelectric power plant can be visited from Belgrade and other cities downstream from it. There are a number of tourist points in the park with hotel and other facilities, offering tourists rest and swimming and tours of the cultural and historical monuments and natural values.\n\n7. Caves\n\nTime, water and limestone took their time in sculpturing the underground halls in Serbia: Rajko Cave, Ceremosnja, Marble Cave, Resavska Cave, near Despotovac, some three kilometres in length, is luxuriously adorned with coral-like stone jewels and snow white crystals.\n\nIn the surroundings of Kursumlija, nature, like a skilful Oriental builder, sculptured a city of stone. Hundreds of figures appear and disappear of themselves, rising and changing their shapes. Not knowing how to explain this natural phenomenon, the people named the place the Devil's Town (Djavolja Varos).\n\n8. The Northern Province: Vojvodina\n\nThis province of Serbia occupies the area of 10,849 square kilometres of the territory in the North-East of the Republic. Novi Sad is its administrative, economic and cultural seat.\n\nVojvodina makes almost a quarter of the Serbian territory or 21,506 square kilometres. Novi Sad is the administrative, economic and cultural seat of the province.\n\nTerritorial organization\n\nVojvodina consists of 45 municipalities and 7 districts where seats are Subotica, Zrenjanin, Kikinda, Pancevo, Sombor, Novi Sad and Sremska Mitrovica Vojvodina is intersected by three big navigable rivers: the Danube, Tisa and Sava. They divide its territory into three clearly visible units: Banat in the East, Backa in the North-West and Srem in the South-West. All three regions are characterized by fertile arable land, overall economic and cultural development, high population density and demographic variety.\n\nRelief\n\nThe relief of Vojvodina is primarily flat except for Srem which is dominated by the Fruska Gora and the South-east of Banat with its Vrsacki breg. The river Danube with its tributaries has nowadays the biggest hydrographic potential. It is also the most important water way and the most significant strategic direction in Europe.\n\nThe Danube flows 588 km through Serbia, primarily through Vojvodina and is navigable along the whole length. Its tributaries Tisa (168 km), Sava (206 km) and Begej (75 km) are navigable too. They are connected with a water irrigation system of canals used for irrigation of land and water transportation as well. The whole length of canals is 939 km out of which 673 km are navigable.\n\nTraffic Importance\n\nOther important traffic routes also pass through Vojvodina. First the highway from Central Europe and Horgos at the Hungarian border that goes through Novi Sad and Belgrade further to Nis, where it takes two directions: one to the East towards the Bulgarian border and another to the South towards Skopje and Thessaloniki. There is also the third highway in Srem which takes the direction to the West towards the Republic of Croatia and further on towards Western Europe. On both sides of the highway there is a network of local roads and railway lines.\n\nThe Morava-Vardar valley begins at the South of Vojvodina, is the most important connection between the North and South of the Balkan peninsula. Near Belgrade, it intersects the Danube East-West direction, thus creating the geo-strategic knot. This makes the geographic-strategic position of this province significant and advantageous for Serbia.\n\nPopulation\n\nAccording to the last census from 1991, Vojvodina has 2,013,889 inhabitants, which is slightly more than 20% of the total population of Serbia. With a population of 1,143,723, the Serbs make the absolute majority in the province. Then come the Hungarians - 339,491, Croats - 74,808, Slovaks - 63,545, Montenegrins - 44,838, Rumanians - 38,809, Romanies - 24,366, Ruthenians - 17,652, Macedonians - 17,472 and other smaller ethnic groups like the Ukrainians, Albanians, Slovenians and others (a total of 26 nations and national and ethnic groups) while 174,225 inhabitants declare themselves as Yugoslavs.\n\nThe Statute of Vojvodina which is the basic legal act of the province, permits, besides the Serbian language, the official use of four other languages of the largest national minorities: Hungarian, Slovak, Rumanian and Ruthenian. Except for the language, the population differs in religion so that the Serbs, Montenegrins, Rumanians, Romanies, Macedonians and Ukrainians are Orthodox, Hungarians, Croats and Ruthenians Catholic while Slovaks are Protestant. There is also a number of Muslims and other smaller religious communities.\n\nEducation\n\nThe educational system in Vojvodina is well developed and consists of the following:\n\nPre-school institutions;\n\nPrimary schools (539), where lectures are also held in the languages of the minorities;\n\nSecondary schools (110), where lectures are also held in the languages of the minorities;\n\nNovi Sad University consisting of 13 faculties where lectures are held in the languages of minorities as well.\n\nScience and culture\n\nThe oldest institutions in Vojvodina which traditionally have been the cultural and scientific bastions of the Serbian people, are: Matica Srpska, founded in 1826 and the Serbian National Theatre, founded in 1861, which performs plays in the languages of the minorities too. In Novi Sad, there is a branch of the Serbian Academy of Science and Art and two Scientific Institutes with some 3000 experts in various fields who are active in these institutes and faculties.\n\nEconomy\n\nThe economy in Vojvodina is based on the abundant wealth of fertile arable land which covers 84% of its area. Its natural fertility is improved by an irrigation network so that out of 1.78 million hectares of arable land, around 0.5 million is watered. About 70% of the yield are cereals, 20% industrial herbs and 10% other crops. Part of the produce is exported but most of it is processed by the domestic food industry, stationed mainly in Vojvodina (plants for processing of meat, fruit and vegetables, oil plants, sugar refineries, dairies, etc.).\n\nThere is strong basic industry that produces metal processing machines, electric machines and cables, construction material, oil derivatives, chemical products, electric motors, newsprint paper. There is also a high technology industry like production of dentists' equipment, cars, pharmaceutical products, porcelain, etc.\n\nPart of the income of the economy comes from tourism particularly developed on rivers and lakes, thermal springs and on Fruska Gora mountain which abounds with numerous orthodox monasteries of the Serbian-Byzantine style, built between the 15th and 17th century.\n\n9. The Southern Province: Kosovo and Metohija\n\nAlong with Macedonia, the southern Serbian province of Kosovo and Metohija is the only remaining flashpoint in the Balkans.\n\nThe current political situation in Kosovo is characterized by separatist aspirations of Kosovo Albanians, a large number of expelled non-Albanians, mostly Serbs, almost 5,000 unsolved cases of missing persons on both sides, interethnic war crimes accusations, the absence of dialogue between ethnic Albanian and Yugoslav, i.e. Serbian authorities, and a general atmosphere of insecurity for Serbs and other non-Albanians. All these difficulties strain the relations and living conditions in this part of Serbia.\n\nNeither the armed KFOR contingent, nor the UN Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo has managed a solution to the Serbian-Albanian conflict which has dogged the province for centuries. During the former, non-democratic regime in the late 90s, the conflict culminated in a bloody war which ended with the bombing of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and deployment of NATO troops (according to the Military Technical Agreement in Kumanovo).\n\nThe UN Security Council subsequently adopted Resolution 1244, regulating the interim status of Kosovo and defining the means for restoring a lasting peace in the province, which is an integral part of the Republic of Serbia, i.e. the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia.\n\nWe are providing extensive information on the province in hopes that UNMIK, the international community, the leading ethnic Albanian parties in Kosovo and Serbian and Yugoslav authorities will succeed in finding a joint solution to the Kosovo problem in accord with Resolution 1244. The responsible parties need to provide a peaceful and secure life for all of Kosovo's inhabitants, unhindered return of some 200,000 expelled persons and refugees, and wider and substantial autonomy for Kosovo within the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia.\n\nThis province of Serbia occupies the area of 10,849 square kilometres of the territory in the South-West of the Republic. Pristina is its administrative, economic and cultural seat.\n\nTerritorial organization\n\nKosovo and Metohija consist of 29 municipalities and 5 districts. The seats of the districts are Pristina, Pec, Prizren, Kosovska Mitrovica and Gnjilane.\n\nKosovo and Metohija is separated from neighbouring Albania by the mountain massif of Prokletije and is separated from Macedonia by Sar Planina mountain with two highest mountain peaks in Serbia: Deravica and Crni vrh. The province is made up of two regions which differ from each other in the soil content and climate and are divided by Cicavica and Crnoljevo mountains. The characteristic of the province is rapid economic and cultural development, high population density and demographic variety with a pronounced domination of Albanian population.\n\nRelief\n\nThis Southern Serbian province has a varied relief: it is edged with mountainous wreaths which are intersected by canyons and very wide valleys of the rivers Binacka Morava, Lab and Beli Drim.\n\nKosovo is placed in the South-Eastern and Eastern part of the province, near the Morava-Vardar valley. It is primarily hilly land so that wealth in ores is the main natural potential of this region. On the other hand, Metohija is placed in the West and North-West of the province and consists of fertile arable land.\n\nThe geographic division between Metohija and Kosovo caused the difference of their flora and fauna. Metohija has the characteristic influence of the Mediterranean thus being the region with the highest number of Mediterranean species of flora and fauna in the whole Serbia, while Kosovo does not differ from the rest of Serbia.\n\nTraffic importance\n\nKosovo and Metohija is the watershed of rivers which belong to Black Sea, Adriatic or Aegean basins that make this province an important traffic route. Its Eastern edge touches the Morava-Vardar direction where one branch of the highway goes, while another important Serbian traffic route, the Ibar highway, passes through the North-Western part of the province. There is a plan for the construction of a new highway which would take the western route from Nis through Kosovo, Metohija and Montenegro to the Adriatic coast.\n\nPopulation\n\nAccording to the census from 1991, Kosovo and Metohija have 1,956,196 inhabitants which is slightly less than 20% of the total population of Serbia. There are many nationalities with pronounced domination of Albanians - 1,596,072 or 82.2% of the population of the province, or 17% of the total population of Serbia. Then come the Serbs - 194,190, Muslims - 66,189, Romanies - 45,745, Montenegrins - 20,356, Turks - 10,446, Croats - 8,062 and other smaller national and ethnic groups, 24 in all. No other census were done since 1991.\n\nThe Statute of Kosovo and Metohija which is the basic legal act of the province, permits, besides the Serbian language, the official use of the Albanian language. Except for the language, the population differs in religion so that Serbs and Montenegrins are Orthodox, Croats Catholics, while Albanians are mostly Muslims as are the Turks and most of Romanies.\n\nEducation\n\nThe educational system in Kosovo and Metohija consists of the following:\n\nPre-school institutions;\n\nPrimary schools (983), where lectures are also held in the languages of the minorities;\n\nSecondary schools (57), where lectures are also held in the languages of the minorities;\n\nPristina University consisting of 14 faculties where lectures are held in the languages of the minorities as well.\n\nScience and culture\n\nThe development of science and culture in Kosovo and Metohija received a powerful push forward only after they were attached to Yugoslavia in 1918 which excelerated during the last few decades. Pristina University, University Library, Kosovo and Metohija Museum, Institute of Cultural Monuments Protection, National Theatre in Pristina and other cultural institutions were founded. Thus began elimination of adverse consequences the Turkish empire had left on this territory during the past few centuries.\n\nEconomy\n\nThe economy of the province relies on local resources. Metohija is characterized by fertile arable land with many small rivers which provide water for irrigation and, in combination with the Mediterranean climate, give excellent yields. Except for cereals, this area is well known for its qualitative vineyards, all sorts of fruit, chestnut and almond.\n\nKosovo is also known for the above mentioned crops, but cattle breeding is also very developed at the edges of Kosovo and Metohija valley.\n\nHowever, Kosovo region abounds with extraordinary ore and power potentials. As early as in the Middle Ages, the area around Novo Brdo was known for its money mint and rich deposits of silver. Silver lodes are exploited in Trepca even today, although the main production of the ore-smelting works is based on lead-zinc ore. This provides the basis for the development of other industrial branches in Kosovo. Large lignite deposits represent special wealth which is the basis of the thermal energy of this region and it supplies the electricity to a large portion of Serbia.\n\nThe province is also rich with thermal waters with many spas surrounded by medical centres. Finally, tourist industry is specially enriched with numerous monuments from Serbian history particularly with medieval monasteries and fortresses. It is worth mentioning that the very term Metohija derives from the medieval name for the monastery land given to Orthodox monasteries by the Serbian rulers.\n\nPristina\n\nThe capital has all the beauty and grace that Soviet-stile excesses in concrete could bestow. Prishtina has little to offer and can be considered a jumping-off point to the more interesting towns of Peja and Prizren.\n\nOrientation\n\nCentral Pristina focuses on Mother Theresa and Ramiz Sadiku Sts that that run in a general south to north direction converging near the National Theatre at the northern end.\n\nThe bus station is in the south - western outskirts of Pristina, off Kral Petri St on the Peja road.\n\nThe airport is 17 km to the south - west.\n\nMaps of Pristina can sometimes be difficult to find but ask at kiosks or bookshops along Mother Theresa."
