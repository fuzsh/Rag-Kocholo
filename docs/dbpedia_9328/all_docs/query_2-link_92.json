        "text": "By Ilona Teleki\n\nThe EU-backed Agreement on Restructuring Relations between Serbia and Montenegro signed on 14 March has been extolled by Western European countries and the United States as a landmark success in resolving another problem in the Balkans. Brokered by Javier Solana, the EU's high representative for common foreign and security policy, that deal was intended to thwart the creation of yet another new independent state from the crumbling Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (FRY).\n\nDuring a decade of intervention in the Balkans, the international community has addressed the needs and demands of all but one of the former Yugoslavia's federal units. The exception is Vojvodina, which did not feature in the drafting of the constitutional charter of the proposed Serbian-Montenegrin state.\n\nThis was particularly grating to many of the inhabitants of Vojvodina, which, like Kosova, had the status of autonomous province under the 1974 Yugoslav Constitution. This status was nearly equal to that of the six federal republics. Vojvodina's autonomy was rooted in the fact that its political and cultural traditions have more in common with former Habsburg Central Europe rather than with the former Kingdom of Serbia or Ottoman Empire. It is also the home to a large Hungarian minority, as well as to smaller populations of Czechs, Slovaks, Ruthenes, Croats, and others.\n\nThe Serbia-Montenegro agreement was met with outrage by the most vocal advocates of the restoration of Vojvodina's autonomous status, which was abolished together with Kosova's autonomy by former Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic through changes to the Serbian Constitution during his rise to power in 1988. Nenad Canak, Vojvodina Assembly speaker and leader of the League of Vojvodina Social Democrats, opposed the union agreement because no one consulted Vojvodina during the talks on the future of the union. Leaders representing Serbia saw nothing unusual in this oversight at all. In fact, Serbian Prime Minister Zoran Djindjic has regularly emphasized that Vojvodina is Serbia's \"internal\" matter and that all \"internal\" relations will be regulated in the Serbian Assembly and through the Serbian Constitution. That insistence means Vojvodina has had difficulty in reestablishing its rights.\n\nVojvodina is a peaceful place by Balkan standards, and its campaign for autonomy has fallen on deaf ears both within and outside Serbia. Collectively and separately, for the past decade, parties represented in the Vojvodina Assembly have campaigned for the restoration of the rights of the province -- rights that were illegally revoked under former Serbian President Milosevic. Last year, the campaign achieved international attention when the representatives of the assembly issued a platform on autonomy to the Serbian government that reiterated their demands for a new constitutional position within the FRY. Last month, a provincial parliamentary commission drafted a basic law that would provide legislative, executive and judicial authorities for the province. But these most recent proposals, like previous efforts, achieved nothing. In a recent poll, public support for Vojvodina's own government bodies reached the highest figure yet -- over 80 percent of the region's population. Yet political will and overwhelming public support are not enough to loosen Serbia's grip.\n\nBelgrade has consistently made promises to restore Vojvodina's autonomy, but at the same time has continually manufactured excuses to delay progress. In February 2001, the Serbian Assembly narrowly passed a law to restore partial autonomous powers to Vojvodina. The \"omnibus law,\" as it is commonly known, was met with disbelief within the province. The law has no effect on Vojvodina's legal status without the necessary budgetary provisions that can be made only by the Serbian Assembly. Late last month, the Serbian parliament did agree, in theory, to transfer 8.7 billion dinars [about $145 million] to Vojvodina as a component of the law, to assist in the administration of Vojvodina's new functions. But will Belgrade actually follow through with its latest promise?\n\nBelgrade's reluctance to restore Vojvodina's rights stems from fears that Vojvodina's leaders are nurturing secessionist aims. In fact, Serbian President Kostunica's shadow cabinet just two weeks ago stated that the basic law is proof of Vojvodina's aspirations to independent statehood due to its plans for a full, legal government. The shadow cabinet issued a warning to the basic law's authors of the consequences that may arise from placing it on the parliament's agenda. Yet, no matter how many times Vojvodina's leadership and public assure Belgrade that autonomy for Vojvodina does not pose any threat to the sovereignty of the Serbian state, Belgrade refuses to listen.\n\nBefore 1989, Vojvodina was one of the most prosperous federal units of Yugoslavia. The territory ranked second, behind Slovenia, in wealth and standard of living. Today, Vojvodina powerlessly watches Belgrade drain the province of its taxable income, sell its property for profit, and mismanage its agricultural sector. Belgrade's policies have produced widespread poverty, protests, and tension, and public opinion holds Belgrade directly responsible for the economic hardship. Under the present constitutional circumstances, poverty will continue to spread and tensions will escalate, generating more instability in an already depleted region. Belgrade will continue to unilaterally dominate the province, and now with the permission of the EU, Belgrade will believe that it can legitimately postpone any action on the full restoration of Vojvodina's autonomy.\n\nThe exclusion of Vojvodina in the formation of the new Serbian and Montenegrin state has sent a negative message to all communities struggling for recognition across Eastern Europe: if blood is shed, as in Kosova, you will be noticed; if you have an independent government, as in Montenegro, you can enhance your international profile; but if you are a peaceful region where autonomy continues to be denied, few will listen. Without international pressure on Belgrade, Vojvodina's choices will narrow further. The restoration of Vojvodina's rights could thwart another crisis in the Balkans.\n\nIlona Teleki is research associate of the East European Studies program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS), in Washington, D.C."
