        "text": "I felt depression beginning to descend upon me as I neared the end of developing my itinerary for the lost cities beyond Hungary’s borders. By the time I reached the final city, Subotica in northern Serbia, I should have been suffering full blown sadness. Instead, I began to feel radiant. Subotica can do that to me. My first visit to the city took place four years ago and it was spectacular. A bright winter day, cool and crisp beneath a sky that could not have been bluer. Subotica’s architecture matched the rays of light that shined down upon it. The City Hall was one of the most impressive buildings I have ever seen and that was without stepping inside. Subotica gave me everything and left me wanting more.\n\nLighting ceremony – Splendor in Subotica\n\nNow Playing – City Of Survival\n\nSometimes for your own sanity, you need to let things go. Loved ones you have lost, first loves that faded, other romances that failed, human and otherwise. Love usually comes and goes. It is like a secret that gets passed around. Once in a great while, true love stays with you. And so it is with the lost cities. They continue to occupy my imagination. Perhaps that is because of the inherent drama in their history since the late nineteenth century. Any one of the lost cities would make a great play. My final stop in Subotica is grand theater. There are multiple acts (Austria-Hungary, Kingdom of Yugoslavia, wartime Hungary, communist Yugoslavia, Serbia), heroes (Art Nouveau architects) and villains (communists, fascists, and nationalists), romance (not just for individuals, but for the entire city) and tragedy (World Wars I and II, Treaty of Trianon, the Holocaust) suffering and loss (ethnic Hungarians, Jews, other minorities), survival and resurrection (the city center, synagogue). All the ingredients are there for tragedy and triumph.\n\nVarious iterations of the play have been running for over a century to dramatic effect. There are matinees and midnight showings. The current version features Subotica’s survival and resurrection. Art Nouveau architecture plays the leading role. The performance does not disappoint. The play opens with the main protagonist seeing the Raichle Palace just after arrival at the train station. The decorative floral patterns on the building are in full bloom. That opening catches the viewer’s attention, Subotica Synagogue captures it. The superlatives to describe this scene have not yet been invented. The play unfolds from there throughout the city center. Reviews fail to do it justice, but the scribes still try. I located the following review deep in my imagination:\n\nThe Subotica Synagogue is the closest thing to magic. For those who have trouble believing in God, seeing the fully restored synagogue will prove to be a revelation. Its architecture and aesthetics, symmetry and spirituality are inspired by a higher power. Eternity is preserved within those hallowed walls. The synagogue proves to be as astonishing as the history of the people who worshiped there is tragic. Nothing in the viewer’s experience can prepare them for such a setting,\n\nSubotica’s survival is the counterpoint to all the hurt, all the anger, all the pain, that fell on this little corner of Eastern Europe after the First World War. The city suffers grievous wounds for many decades, but the cityscape survives as an expression of human creativity and ingenuity. Its most stunning pieces of architecture represent the highest levels of artistic achievement. For the play’s protagonist, Subotica’s city center is a stand in for all that is worth saving in the world. He finally realizes that he has entered the magic kingdom. The spiritual force of the structures is so real that the viewer, like the protagonist, can feel them. The hand of God which designed, crafted, and sculpted Subotica reaches out to touch the audience.\n\nHeavenly ascent – Inside Subotica Synagogue\n\nTranscendent Beauty – Desperate Tragedy\n\nSubotica is an endless reel, a succession of spectacular images that keep playing in my head. Do all good things have to end? Maybe not since Subotica and all the other lost cities are still standing. The itinerary I developed will end, but the lost cities will go on. Someone, somewhere, right now is rediscovering them. They are seeing something of themselves in the transcendent beauty and desperate tragedy that stalks their squares and streets. The greatest discovery I made while developing my itinerary is that in the lost cities, I see the best and worst aspects of myself. In Eisenstadt, my frivolity is represented by the candy-colored Esterhazy Palace. In Bratislava’s Old Town, the walls I have built around myself to keep the rest of the world out. In Kosice’s towering St. Elisabeth’s Cathedral, a dream I will never reach. In Uzhhorod, the place where I fear to go. In Oradea, the best version of myself. În Timișoara, my ingratitude for the gift of life after the apocalypse. In Subotica, my belief that life is everlasting.\n\nEach lost city feels like the first and last day on earth. I am sure many of those who suffered and survived in them felt the same. The Austro-Hungarian Empire could be just as bright and beautiful as those who built it. The empire could also be just as dark and decadent as those who destroyed it. All empires vanish, not a single one has managed to survive. That stark fact should be just as humbling to us as Austria-Hungary’s collapse was to its inhabitants. The true measure of an empire is not in its ascension and apex, nor in its decline and fall. The true measure of an empire is its legacy. What it leaves behind for others to build upon, to aspire, to protect, and preserve. In that regard, the legacy of Austria-Hungary is well served by the lost cities. There is still life in those ruins.\n\nLighting up the night – Subotica’s City Hall\n\nImperial Ways – Life Lessons\n\nThe lost cities are astonishing storehouses of art, architecture, and culture. They teach us lessons in history from which we can learn. They show how to prosper during good times and endure when all hope seems lost. They demonstrate the ability to bask in past glories, while stepping boldly into the future. They tell us to enjoy what we have because one day it will be gone. They demonstrate that nothing is inevitable, even if it seems that way.\n\nClick here for: Obstacle Course – Navigating Trianon (The Lost Cities #13)\n\nEarly departures, they are the bane of a traveler’s existence. Is there anything worse than spending your last night with a newfound love and knowing you will abandon it before the crack of dawn? This leads to restless nights in generic hotels, bleary eyed wakeup calls at 4:15 a.m. and half a gallon of coffee downed in a paltry attempt at semi-coherence. This was the situation I put myself in on consecutive days while leaving Novi Sad and Subotica. I should have learned my lesson the first time. Novi Sad was worth more than the time I spent there. That was even more so with Subotica. Why did I feel it necessary to leave the places I loved so soon? If I knew that answer my travels would not have been nearly so adventurous.\n\nOnly in retrospect would I come to lament my decision to leave Subotica on that early Friday morning. At the time I felt an inner urge, one of those all too irresistible compulsions which sent me in search of Szeged and myself. There was always another city I had to see, the seductive allure of something different. A mistress clothed in concrete, the harlot waiting on every obscure corner, that city sized brothel I could make love in for a few hours before dashing out the door and into the wider world to find another fling with my restless nature. I would exhaust myself by the time I made it to Budapest. Then the self-remonstrations and regret would set in. An inner voice would remind me that I should have stayed longer in Subotica. This would be followed by an all too common refrain of “I will be back.”\n\nAn Unspoken Friend – Impossible and Worth Imagining\n\nThe 6:30 a.m. bus from Subotica to Szeged did not sound appealing. Nonetheless, I purchased a ticket the night before departure. The walk from my accommodation to the bus station was long and cold, I spent most of it watching my breath materialize and disappear beneath the blinding glare of streetlights. The fifteen-minute walk was bracing. The Subotica bus station did not offer much in the way of relief. It was an architectural eyesore. The kind of place that looked like a hub for dubious activities and deviant behavior. It was better to stand shivering at a platform than to take my chances inside the station. Of course, at this hour there were not many around to partake of illicit activities or substances. As for myself, I felt compelled to join a handful of others who looked just as cold and cheerless as I did.\n\nThe only potential passenger who looked like he might be enjoying himself was a rather tall, broad shouldered man who stood a few feet away from everyone else while enjoying a cigarette. We struck up a sort of silent friendship when I managed to ask him if this was the correct spot to stand while waiting on the bus to Szeged. He nodded approvingly. A little later he signaled to me when a bus appeared and pulled up beside us. He made sure to show me where to put my baggage. This gracious and accommodating gentleman made me regret all my past attempts to learn Magyar. He would have been an interesting character to quiz. He was obviously Hungarian. The kind of man who could have given me insight into the relationship between Hungarians and Serbs in this region. Such a conversation was impossible, but worth imagining.\n\nA Little Bit Like Home – The Frontiers of Old Europe\n\nThe bus soon arrived, a metal missile that would propel us over the border and beyond the Balkans. Leaving Subotica was a strange goodbye to the Balkans. The Vojvodina region of northern Serbia never quite felt Balkan enough for me. It was more Mitteleuropa than mystery and intrigue. The ethnic diversity in both the Vojvodina and Subotica could have been Balkan, but it was just as much a throwback to the Austro-Hungarian Empire. This was the way Old Europe used to be, with Hungarians, Serbs, Bunjevci and Croats living cheek by jowl. Those days had dissipated during and after World War II as tens of thousands were eradicated or forcibly exchanged. Some pockets of ethnic diversity still exist, usually where national frontiers meet. Subotica was one of them. It was a fascinating place. Most of Europe did not realize what it was missing, but I did.\n\nThe bus wound its way through the outskirts of Subotica and then down an empty highway that took us through one last town before we reached the border. Horgos, I liked the name as soon as I saw it on a sign. At this point I was grasping for something to hold onto. I did not want my Balkan adventure to end. For me, Horgos held as much meaning as Cetinje, Budva, Kotor, Bar, Belgrade and Novi Sad. It was the last link on a thread I had woven from the sublime shoreline of the Adriatic across the majestic mountains of Montenegro to the fallow, frost covered fields of the Vojvodina. Horgos made me feel like I was back in Hungary. It was a little bit like home.\n\nThe Power of Nature – Rising Sun, Setting Scene\n\nSaying goodbye is never easy, waking from a dream is disconcerting, the end of a journey is haunting. Feelings of melancholy and nervous anticipation consumed me as the bus made its way through Horgos and covered the last few kilometers as it closed in on the border. This was the end of one journey and the beginning of another. The sun was slowly rising over the vast plain that knew nothing of nations or borders. What were the malevolent designs of nationalists, fascists and communists when compared to the scene slowly materializing before me?\n\nAll the man made maelstroms that swept over this land were not half as powerful as this sunrise which knew nothing of war or ethnic strife. The power of man is nothing before the power of nature. I watched as the sky lit up. The horizon turned to velvet, a color only nature could create. Wisps of clouds floated above the earth. It was an unforgettable coda to an incredible journey. I knew this scene, much like my trip, would not last. It had to end somewhere and so it did.\n\nClick here for: Going Home To Hungary – The Road To Szeged: Crossover Appeal (A Balkan Affair #41)\n\nRiding the rails between Novi Sad and Subotica took me on a journey through a land that looked frozen in time. The fact that frost had built up on scrub grass beside the tracks and the twisted limbs of trees had turned translucent only added to the sense of stagnation. There was a dramatic beauty in the semi-ruined townscapes and outbuildings in the countryside. I snapped photo after photo with my phone hoping the perfect picture would capture the rustic scenery. There was one scene that really caught my eye. Whether it was a barn or a barrack I have no way of knowing, but the early morning sun illuminated the side of a rustic and roofless building. The grass around it was flecked in frost. The building was caught somewhere between abandonment and ruin. It was the very definition of the phrase, “a long time coming.” What I imagined was a slow, glacial pace of unsightly decay made me wonder if anything ever really changed or everything just crumbled in rural Vojvodina.\n\nGenerating Genocide – The German Experience\n\nAt the approximate midpoint of this journey, the train pulled up to a two-story train station in the village of Lovcenac. The town itself was a good distance east of the station. Farm fields could be seen in all directions. The fields looked as though they had been there since time immemorial. One could be forgiven for assuming that this landscape was timeless. I later learned that Lovcenac had been transformed by the 20th century. A breathtaking wave of historic change had swept over the town, it had been tormented by the whirlwind of modern warfare and buffeted by extreme racial and ideological ideas. All the problems usually associated with the Balkans had taken place in Lovcenac. Ethnic cleansing, forcible population transfers and demographic decline had unsettled and resettled this village of 3,100 inhabitants. The ethnic cleansing occurred in the latter part of World War II, when a century and a half of ethnic German settlement and successful development abruptly ended.\n\nThe communist partisans and South Slavic peoples exacted a deadly retribution for all that they had suffered during the war. The fact that there was no remorse is hardly surprising. After all, the German military command during the war had issued orders stating that for every German soldier killed by a partisan, one hundred Yugoslavs would be murdered. This led to a vicious cycle of violence that boomeranged on ethnic Germans in Yugoslavia. Any ethnic German was subject at best to expulsion, at worst confinement and eventual execution. The Germans of Lovcenac were symbolic of a much larger movement across eastern Europe. Ethnic Germans were thrown out of their homes, never to return. The lucky ones made it back to Germany, the unlucky ones ended up as collateral damage, pawns in a deadly geopolitical game of retribution.\n\nDawn Harvest – Off the Tracks in Vojvodina\n\nMaking Ends Meet – The Ebb & Flow of Montenegrins\n\nLovcenac was one of hundreds of towns dislocated from its past during the post-war period. The agent of change was first the Red Army, a sort of hell on wheels, rails, boots and horseback. They took the area and then handed it over to the Yugoslav communists who marched the German citizens off to perform forced labor. Their main church and cemetery were plowed under. The town was just as fallow as the surrounding fields following the war. Rebuilding the population started after the war when Montenegrins settled in Lovcenac. They had staying power. Today their descendants make up a large portion of the residents. The resettlement was successful, but the town has never really recovered demographically. Lovcenac’s population is a third lower than it was a hundred years ago. It is not just ethnic Germans who are missing. Young and upwardly mobile Montenegrins and Serbs have voted with their feet as well, escaping for greener pastures even though they were already surrounded by hectare upon hectare of pastures and fertile fields.\n\nThe hollowing out of rural Vojvodina has been no different than that seen in so many European societies. Since 1991, the town has lost a quarter of its population. Sometimes I wonder if anyone will be left in villages like Lovcenac a hundred years from now. This is a pattern being repeated all cross Eastern Europe. The first time I came across the physical manifestations of demographic decline was in northeastern Hungary. On the outskirts of villages, ruined houses were the lone traces of the inhabitants who left decades ago. Windows and doors were missing, large sections of plaster and paint had chipped off and weeds choked abandoned garden plots. These scenes are supposed to be reminiscent of the past, but they seem to be creeping portents of the future.\n\nIt used to be that war, disease and famine caused depopulation. Now low birthrates and an aging populace threaten to further marginalize regions such as the Vojvodina. From the window of my train I passed through a world in perpetual decline, where everything was tending toward decay. And yet I still felt hopeful that this region and its people would survive. This land, these towns and villages had been through much worse. There were people living up and down this train line who had witnessed the horrors of World War II. Somehow, they had managed to make it through to the present. By comparison, the present danger seemed rather benign. The difference between the problems facing Lovcenac in 1944 and those of the 21st century is the difference between dying in your life and dying in your sleep. The former happens in a moment of horror, the other in a moment of indifference.\n\nThe Final Stop – A Hungarian Foothold\n\nAfter Lovcenac only a couple of stops remained before the train would reach Subotica. One minute I was peering out at the countryside, lost in dreamy wanderlust, the next I was preparing for imminent arrival. As I expected, the train was running behind by about ten minutes. Its tepid pace had become quite enjoyable. Slowly, ever so slowly the train crawled northward. Arriving at Backa Topola we were now transitioning into a Hungarian world. This may have been Serbian territory, but the town was majority Hungarian.\n\nInterestingly, when Backa Topola was first mentioned in recorded history during the mid-15th century, the town was then chiefly Hungarian. It still is today, five and half centuries later. This was deceptive. Backa Topola had been obliterated by the end of the Ottoman period, then risen from the wasteland to a vibrant community through the collective efforts of generations of Hungarian settlers. Unlike ethnic Germans in the Vojvodina, the Hungarians had managed to keep a tenuous hold on parts of this region. Their presence, both historical and current, was what now brought me to my final stop, Subotica.\n\nClick here for: A Kingdom In Fragments – Subotica: Multiple Personality Disorders (A Balkan Affair #35)\n\nA 6:33 a.m. departure from the Novi Sad station to Subotica seemed a bit on the early side. It may have had something to do with commuters taking this train 95 kilometers north to the city of Subotica. There were not many commuters, but when a train moves as slow as this one did, I can understand why an early start would be a necessity. Consider the fact that the train was scheduled to take 2 hours and 27 minutes to reach Subotica. That means the train took on average a minute and a half to cover a single kilometer. Taking a bus, while much more uncomfortable, would have meant almost an hour of time savings since the bus to Subotica only takes an hour and 35 minutes. A private automobile is even faster, covering the same distance in an hour and 7 minutes.\n\nSuffice to say, the train was by far the most inefficient method of travel between Novi Sad and Subotica. For me, it would also be the most satisfying. It offered simple pleasures, a sort of acquired taste for travelers. Chief among these pleasures was a sting of eight towns and villages the train would pass through along the way. This journey would give me a glimpse of life in the outlying communities and rural hinterlands of Vojvodina. Places where I imagined time had long since stopped ticking, a backward region that had left the world behind. This was the hidden Europe, places that clung tenuously to their precarious existence.\n\nRear View Region – The Idea of Progress\n\nHow long it took to get from Novi Sad to Subotica was esoteric to me. I did not have to be at work or have anyone to meet in Subotica at a certain time. In might be said that there was nowhere I had to be and nowhere was exactly where I was going. That was the entire reason for taking this train in the first place. Time and deadlines are the products of a western, business oriented mindset, the very antithesis of travel. The slower, more relaxed pace of this train appealed to me. It might be put down to a lack of infrastructure upgrades or poor technology. Then again, it might be slow because no one taking it had any reason to be in a hurry. Everyone onboard when the train first set out looked relaxed, if not to say bored. There was no reason to hurry and even if there had been, the train was not going any faster.\n\nOne reason for the train’s slowness was because it stopped every ten kilometers or so at a village. Those stops became a source of fascination for me, as did the in between spaces which were covered with farmland. For me, Vojvodina was a land worth seeing. I had a feeling that the inhabitants would say the opposite. The idea of progress had a different meaning in this region. The Vojvodina had a lot of catching up to do. I wondered if they knew that the world had long since moved on without them. I wondered if they cared. This was a region that had enough of history during the 20th century. It had been consumed by empires, armies, failed nation states, Serbians, Hungarians and Germans. It had managed to survive all these storms. In what condition it survived, I would get to judge for myself.\n\nOnly a few minutes after leaving the Novi Sad station, the train slowed to a stop at Kisac. A town of 5,500, it was still a showpiece for an ethnic minority in the Vojvodina as 80% of the inhabitants were ethnic Slovaks. These were the descendants of those who had been settled in the region during the late 18th century under Habsburg policies to repopulate the area long after the Turks had been pushed out. The Vojvodina was chock full of places like Kisac, with ethnic Serbs, Hungarians, Croats and Romanians, among twenty-one other ethnic groups, inhabiting their own ethnic enclaves. The Habsburg Empire may have disappeared over a hundred years ago and the settlement policies that had brought the Slovaks to Kisac had ceased over two hundred years ago, but its lasting effects were still tangible.\n\nStoicism & Stationmasters – Forgotten Frontier Posts\n\nAs the train picked up speed once again, the rails passed through fields of rich black soil. This churned up earth, interspersed with strips of green grass, was a not so soothing site for the eyes. In one field, I spied a single, small storage building, painted in a bright shade of red. A bare tree was growing beside and rising above it. Winter had stripped everything to its essence. A layer of frost had been lightly laid by the early morning hours upon the grass. A fine mist was slowly being burned off the fields as rays of sunlight began to burst through the cloud cover. A trio of villages, Stepanovicevo, Zmajevo and Vrbas soon came and went. They were scarcely distinguishable from one another. A handful of passengers entered the train, taking advantage of a lifeline that connects the villages of nowhere to the cities of somewhere.\n\nAt stop after stop, I watched with astonishment as stationmasters did their best to practice professionalism by meeting the trains and providing the proper signals. They did this no matter if anyone got on or off the train. I found myself wondering what life must be like for these solitary sentinels who pushed paper most of the day. When they were not selling a ticket or two, they waited expectantly for that moment seven or eight times a day for a train to arrive or depart. There was something romantic about these stationmaster’s presence and posture. All stood stiff backed with chests poked out, straightening their crumpled uniforms. These were the aging soldiers at some forgotten frontier post. Filled with pride, they saluted from in front of barely presentable stations with fading facades. Their faces etched in stone, a picture of determined stoicism. For me, stationmasters are a lasting measure of tradition. I will be forever grateful that I viewed them and the Vojvodina on that glorious morning.\n\nClick here for: The Train To Subotica: Dying In Your Life/Dying In Your Sleep (A Balkan Affair #34)\n\n.\n\nOne of the common complaints I have often heard from eastern Europeans about traveling by train is their chronic slowness. There is a great deal of truth in this opinion. Most train routes, especially ones traveling between provincial cities and towns, takes longer than a car or bus would. The fact that trains usually travel on the straightest possible path only makes their slowness more excruciating. The more I traveled in Eastern Europe, the greater my dissatisfaction with trains. The roominess and relative comfort of a train would be offset by the amount of time it took to get from one place to another. Not to mention the fact that taking the train always meant that I was always on someone else’s schedule.\n\nExacerbating this problem, the trains I took usually did not arrive on time. In Hungary, the trains were only a few minutes late. In Bulgaria and Romania, they could be over an hour late. I always felt this tardiness was paradoxical, because it made me feel rushed. After arriving late at my destination, I would find myself rushing around trying to play catch up with my pre-formulated plans. I was constantly trying to make up for lost time. This seemed self-defeating. Leisure travel is supposed to eschew limitations, of which timetables are the chief culprit. The whole point is to better enjoy a trip. Rail journeys offer a reasonable pace, cost effective price and a wonderful opportunity to see the country which unfolds right outside the large windows which were made for slow motion sightseeing.\n\nRiding a slow train is the equivalent of window shopping on the world. On my journey through Montenegro and then Serbia, I took two unforgettable train journeys. One was the famous Bar to Belgrade railway, the other was into the unknown, heading from Novi Sad north to Subotica, a provincial city par excellence that is located not far off the Serbia-Hungary border. The price was right for my ticket, only costing me a grand total of four dollars for what amounted to a two hour pleasure ride through countryside waking up on a winter morning.\n\nDividing Lines – Two Worlds In One\n\nI awoke early on Thursday morning, excited about making the journey by train to Subotica. The night before, I had walked into the arrestingly cavernous Novi Sad station and purchased my ticket for the next day. After leaving the station I turned back around to find the glass face of the station aglow with fiery light. Filtered through the glass, it looked like the sun was setting inside the station. As I prepared to snap a photo of the brilliantly illuminated facade, a man in a black hat and coat walked into my lens view. He wandered back and forth, going towards the station’s entrance and then away from it. He began to walk back towards me. When he was about halfway between me and the station I began to snap away.\n\nMy best photo from this scene will go down as an all-time favorite. I immediately thought of a title for it, Europe Between East and West. This was because the man stood between white lights illuminating Zeleznicka Stanicka to his right (Train Station) and Зелезницка Станицка to his left. The lettering in both Latin and Cyrillic script was redolent of the East/West divide in northern Serbia. A division between Orthodoxy on one hand and Protestantism on the other. Hints of the orient versus Mitteleuropa. The man in my photo unwittingly stood beneath a symbolic dividing line between east and west or so I thought. Upon further reflection, there was another invisible dividing line present here. One that I was going to cross the next day when my early morning train left the Novi Sad station., a Europe Between North and South.\n\nThe further north I traveled, the more I slipped into the orbit of a western oriented world. To the south was the Balkans, a place of intrigue and mystery. The closer I came to the Hungarian sphere of influence, the more it felt like the familiar. I was leaving behind the sensuality and mysticism of all that was eastern in Europe. North and south, east and west, it does not get more symbolic than the facade of Novi Sad’s train station. Here was a road map lit by Latin and Cyrillic lettering. I knew which way I would go, but the man in my picture still looked lost. Ironically, he was helping me find my way.\n\nA Clean Break – Dirty Kinds of Drama\n\nI always arrive at train stations too early. At least half an hour in advance is my personal standard. In the early morning hours at Novi Sad’s station the world was just beginning to stir. The ticket hall looked lonely and forlorn, the preserve of strangers and a handful of commuters. As I made my way to the platform ten minutes prior to departure, the bowels of the station had a sinister air about them. The smell of concrete and mildew with a hint of disinfectant was pervasive. This was the odor of resignation. It was one of those places that puts people on guard.\n\nI felt as though I had walked onto the set of a horror film. The only thing lacking was a villain or gang of thieves. This was a place filled with a dirty kind of drama. Of course, nothing happened to me, it just felt like something should. After climbing up an unforgiving set of steps to arrive at the correct platform, I was shocked to find a modern train idling on the track. It looked like one that would usually be seen in Austria, rather than Serbia. I had expected to find an ancient locomotive pulling rickety cars. Instead, I found a sleek, modern train that looked like it was ready for takeoff.\n\nStepping inside, I was pleased to find the train just a quarter full. Passengers could pick any seat they wanted. I found one by a large window that would provide me with expansive views of the countryside. As the train slowly began to pull away from the station, I knew it would be slow, probably arrive late and stop at every rural hovel along the route. I already knew that this would be more than a train ride, it would be a journey. One that would take me into the rural heart of northern Serbia, a place few cared to see or visit. For precisely this reason, the rail journey from Novi Sad to Subotica appealed to me.\n\nClick here for: Going Nowhere Slow – Novi Sad to Subotica: Mystery Train (A Balkan Affair #33)\n\nThe bus ride from Belgrade to Novi Sad took an hour and half. This gave me an opportunity to get a closer look at the Vojvodina countryside in January. It was exactly what I expected, frozen fields of upturned earth in every direction. This landscape stretched far off to the horizon. It was monotonous and trance inducing. The monotony was reflective of the region’s topography, but not its demography. The Vojvodina may be one of the flattest regions in Europe, but it is also one of the most ethnically diverse areas in Eastern Europe.\n\nConflict and conquerors have swept through the Vojvodina time and again. This has meant successive waves of depopulation and repopulation, migration and expulsion over the centuries. The result has been an unrivaled ethnic mix. Though Serbians at 66% make up by far the largest population group in the Vojvodina, there are no less than 24 other ethnic groups. They speak a variety of tongues, which account for the fact that there are 6 official languages. Due to its multi-ethnic, multi-lingual nature, Vojvodina was given a high degree of autonomy under Yugoslav rule. Today it still enjoys autonomous status as part of the Serbian nation.\n\nThe Ruling Class – Kingdom of Hungarians, Austrians & Serbs\n\nWhat would Vojvodina be without ethnic diversity? The answer is a lesser place. The most prominent of Vojvodina’s ethnic minorities are the Hungarians. The more obscure include the Bunjevci (Roman Catholic Serbs) and Gorani (Slavic Muslims). It is the Hungarians who loom largest as the region’s most populous minority and whose history has had the greatest effect upon the region’s development. Hungarians have ruled over the area longer than anyone else. Their most crucial period of administration occurred from 1867 – 1918 when agricultural and industrial development of the region soared.\n\nThe Vojvodina was taken from Hungary under the postwar Treaty of Trianon and given to the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes (changed to Yugoslavia in 1929). As late as the mid-1950’s a quarter of the population were ethnic Hungarians. Since 1989 that proportion has continually dropped due to a series of factors including the fall of the Iron Curtain, collapse of Yugoslavia and Hungary joining the European Union. These factors sent many Hungarians scurrying northward in search of better job prospects. I have always been intrigued by Vojvodina’s Hungarian past. The Magyar influence was both historically prominent and well known. Across many villages and towns in the far north of the region, Hungarians are still in the majority.\n\nA Vanishing Presence – Ottomans, Austrians & Oblivion\n\nIronically, two ethnic groups which hardly figure in the area anymore are just as responsible for Vojvodina’s present-day ethnic mix. The first of these was the Ottoman Turks. Their invasion of the area, starting in the mid-15th century, swept away the Hungarians who mainly lived in the northern portion of the Vojvodina. Two hundred and fifty years later, at the tail end of the 17th century, it was the Turk’s turn to be thrown out of the region. The Vojvodina was then incorporated into the Austrian dominated Habsburg Empire as part of the Military Frontier. This area was setup along the border to safeguard against another Ottoman incursion.\n\nThe Austrians brought stability and settlement, inviting in a host of different ethnic groups to resettle what was a despoiled wasteland. The German influence proved decisive, encouraging mass migration to the area. Along with migration came peace and prosperity. The ethnic Germans, like the Ottomans before them, were swept away by conflict, in their case the Second World War and its violent aftermath. Today there are very few traces of either Turks or Germans, their actions have been resigned to the dusty pages of history books. The Serbians, who have been in the region the longest, have managed to outlast all other rulers. All the peoples that have been woven into Vojvodina’s ethnic tapestry were nowhere to be found on the bus taking me to Novi Sad. From the words spoken by passengers, everyone seemed to be Serbian.\n\nOf course, there was no way for me to tell otherwise. Thus, I contented myself by viewing the scenery which was non-scenery. That was until the highway crossed the Danube. Central and Eastern Europe’s most famous river looked just as gray as the sky. There was not much excitement to be had while looking at it on a day like this. The trees lining the riverbanks were bare. Nothing moved except for the dreamy flow of the river, sliding along at a barely discernible pace. In past decades, the river would have been frozen solid at the height of winter. Those days were a distant memory for this mighty river. It lay naked and exposed, a sheet of misty glass laid upon the landscape. This was the stuff mediocrity was made of, a scenic highlight that made me long for sleep.\n\nTurning To Technicolor – An Applied Science\n\nThe bus trip seemed much longer than it actually took. When the bus arrived in Novi Sad, I was shocked by the liveliness around the station. There were university students laughing and socializing everywhere. This was like a shot of caffeine to my senses. The gray day had suddenly turned to technicolor. It was a welcome introduction to a city known as the “Serbian Athens.” Today, it is home to thousands of university students as well as the nation’s oldest theater. In the past, Novi Sad has been a center of learning and culture for Serbs since the 18th century. Most of the great Serb novelists and poets in the decades prior to the First World War spent time living and writing in the city.\n\nDuring this period, the city was ironically under Austrian and then Hungarian rule. This resulted in Novi Sad and the Vojvodina coming under the influence of Central European culture rather than the rest of Serbia and the Balkans. Even today it is still somewhat a world apart, especially owing to the city’s emphasis on education which continues to provide Europe with highly intelligent professionals. This became apparent when I met one of Novi Sad’s native sons. A man of medium height, who looked to be in his early 30’s, with dark features and warm, intelligent eyes checked me into the apartment that I had booked a short walk from the bus station.\n\nThe man told me that his mother would usually be the one who checked people in, but she was unavailable. I was amazed how fluently he spoke English. I did not detect much of an accent. There was a good reason for that. Though he was from Novi Sad, the man was only back visiting for the holidays. He lived in London, working as an investment banker for a major financial institution. His education had begun right here in the “Serbian Athens”. Hundreds of years after Novi Sad was given that nickname, it still applied.\n\nClick here for: The Prison of Nations – Petrovaradin Fortress: White Elephant of the Danube (A Balkan Affair #29)\n\nThe morning after a long journey is always brutal. I have not taken a drink in over twenty years, but the way I felt after my Bar to Belgrade railway trip reminded me of some my worst hangovers. I woke up drained and confused. Where was I at? Where had I been? Where was I going? Those questions were the story of my life on the roads and rails of Eastern Europe. I had spent the past three nights in Kotor, Bar and Belgrade. The day before, I traveled through three countries. My mind and body had not yet caught up to where I was at. Now I needed to collect my wits about me as well as my belongings, catch a ride to the central bus station in Belgrade and buy a ticket for an hour and a half journey to Novi Sad. The thought of this did not seem nearly as appealing as when I first planned it.\n\nI had already spent time in Belgrade eight years ago, thus a day sightseeing in the city did not really interest me. Especially when the Vojvodina lay just to the north. Ever since I first passed through that region of mind bending flatness, sublimely fertile fields and complex ethnic diversity, the idea of a return trip captivated me. The fact that a relatively forgotten stretch of the Danube flowed through the area and past Petrovaradin, one of the largest fortresses in Europe, made the region a must see. All this lay somewhere in the distant past or a future that scarcely seemed conceivable as I slowly raised myself out of the bed that morning. I had to keep going, the question was, as it always has been, why? A restless spirit demands to be constantly satisfied.\n\nJoy Ride – The Stuff Of Feverish Dreams\n\nIt took me an hour to really get going, but I had little choice. The night before I had made the fateful decision to meet the proprietor at 8:00 a.m. for a ride to the bus station. I went to the front desk and was promptly ushered into a bar/dining room where I was offered some very powerful coffee. The proprietor was in fine form, gregarious and outgoing. He proceeded to show me photos on his phone of a trip he took to Greece every year. This, along with his family, were the highlights of his life. Running the hotel was a job, one that did not pay as well as he would have liked. Nonetheless, if attitude counts for anything, this Serbian gentleman was a very wealthy man. I could tell that he was someone who enjoyed life. Even though he was quite full of himself, his larger than life persona grew on me almost instantly.\n\nAs he drove me in his Volkswagen to the bus station, we passed down the road I had stumbled along just twelve hours before. The abandoned tram line was more beat up and busted than I had realized during my walk the previous night. The surrounding forest was covered in an icy frost that coated everything from treetops to undergrowth. It was a world all made up for the winter, dead trees and dead leaves beneath a leaden sky. The idea of summer seemed the stuff of feverish dreams in such a setting. The proprietor and I sped through the streets until rush hour traffic brought us to a halt. That’s when I asked my two favorite questions when traveling through the former Yugoslavia. What did you think of Tito? and Did you ever see Tito?\n\nFather Knows Best – The Cult of Tito\n\nThe proprietor surprised me. I could tell by the tone of his voice that he admired Tito. Though he had not ever seen or met Tito, his father had on many occasions. The proprietor’s father had been a famous doctor who was well known for his medical work. He traveled to the United States and Canada on occasion. Tito himself had honored his father. And in turn, the father had told the son that Tito was a very gracious man. This chimed with almost everything I had ever heard about Tito while traveling in the former Yugoslavia. Never once had I heard a disparaging remark made about Tito.\n\nThis was a considerable achievement that spoke volumes about the man especially considering what a disaster communism had been. Everyone I have spoken with regarding Tito does not blame him for the dissolution of Yugoslavia. On the contrary, he is still seen as a force for South Slavic unity. Only Tito could hold the country together. In hindsight, I believe this to largely be true. Tito was a remarkable man, delaying what now seems inevitable. Even if his time in power ushered in massive deficits and economic crisis after his death, Tito was the glue that bound Yugoslavia together. Slippage may have occurred during his tenure, but dissolution was still decades away. For that, Tito will always be remembered as a success.\n\nCrowd Control – Every Student For Themselves\n\nThere are moments in travel when I ask myself why I am doing this? Many of those moments have come at bus stations. The Belgrade Bus Station induced in me that same thought. It was cold, ugly, crowded and as close to chaos as anywhere I have been in Eastern Europe. With the central train station out of service, an overwhelming majority of those looking to get out of Belgrade had descended upon the place. Getting a ticket to Novi Sad turned out to be easier than getting on the bus. I only had a few minutes to spare which greatly increased my stress level, When I got to the designated spot for boarding, I joined a crowd rather than a line. It might best be described as every student for themselves, as the majority were college age Serbs.\n\nSharpened elbows and trickery were necessary here. I navigated near to the man who was collecting baggage storage fees. He would then load the suitcases into the underbelly of the bus. When it came my turn, he ignored the offer of payment in dinars and said something in Serbian. A wave of anger flashed through me. I was getting on that bus and my suitcase was going into storage one way or the other. I demanded the man’s attention once again. He looked surprised and grabbed my suitcase placing it in the baggage storage. He refused to take the dinars I held in front of him. Almost immediately I realized that he had wanted me to store the bag myself in return for no fee. It was a kindly gesture that suddenly made me feel as though I belonged. The sky was still leaden, but my day brightened considerably. The trip to Novi Sad just got shorter.\n\nClick here for: A Land Apart – The Vojvodina: Traveling To The Serbian Athens (A Balkan Affair #28)\n\nFor Americans the 1990’s were largely a decade of prosperity and carefree optimism. The dotcom boom sent the economy soaring, unemployment was low and incomes were rising. Terrorism was still on the periphery and the national mood was optimistic. The country was consumed by the internet, various Clinton administration scandals and the OJ Simpson murder trial saga. By and large the United States was at peace, except for involvement in a handful of military engagements, the most prominent of which was in the former Yugoslavia. As the decade wound down Serbian forces, at the behest of Slobodan Milosevic, interjected themselves into the conflict in Kosovo to ostensibly protect the province’s Serbian population against ethnic Albanian forces. This threatened another round of genocide such as had already occurred earlier in the Yugoslav wars. When Serb forces refused to obey a NATO order to leave Kosovo, the alliance led by the considerable firepower of the United States, conducted a series of military strikes against targets in Serbia. Many of these strikes hit the city of Novi Sad, which I was passing through on the train to Belgrade.\n\nPrime Target – A City In The Crosshairs Of Conflict\n\nMy fear of traveling to Serbia had largely subsided after a couple of hours gliding across the Vojvodina region by train. The countryside looked much like that of the Great Hungarian Plain, endless fields of prime agricultural land. It was hard to imagine that an alliance led by my own country had ever dropped bombs on this land, which looked like a snapshot of serenity from the window of a train car. The hard truth was that this had indeed occurred and not that long ago. As the train arrived on the outskirts of Serbia’s second largest city, I was about to pass through what had been a prime target of the bombing.\n\nIf there was anywhere in Serbia that I should have worried about negative attitudes towards Americans than Novi Sad would have been that place. The city had suffered grave damage during the NATO bombings of 1999. This was sadly ironic since politically, Novi Sad did not support Milosevic, but instead was ruled at that time by the Democratic Opposition. Nonetheless, its role as the second largest city in the country, situated astride the Danube made it a prime target. Novi Sad was home to three bridges over the Danube, as well as various industrial facilities.\n\nBombing began on March 24th and would continue for the next two and a half months. In less than four weeks NATO’s missiles and cluster bombs managed to destroy all three of the city’s bridges that crossed the Danube. This would effectively blockade the river for the next four years, causing economic hardship both for Serbia as well as for NATO members upstream. One of the enduring images of the bombing was black smoke pouring into the sky. This resulted from multiple strikes against oil refineries located in the city. The pollutants that were released could be just as dangerous to civilians as any bomb. Breathing in such a large amount of carcinogens in so short a time, led to respiratory problems or worse. It was estimated that over 50,000 tons of refined oil went up in thick, toxic clouds of smoke. The city’s electrical and water supplies were also knocked out. Novi Sad was on its knees by May.\n\nThe Dark Side Of Irony – A Twisted War\n\nThis being modern warfare, the strikes were also tinged with a dark irony, both during and after the bombing. By one estimate, the destruction of the oil refineries and other industrial targets actually led to less pollution. The old communist era refineries were so archaic that their destruction actually improved air quality. Another darkly ironic twist took place on the final day of bombing in June. More lives were lost on this day than any other. This was a bizarre coda to the seemingly endless Yugoslav Wars of the 1990’s. It then took several years to replace two of the bridges over the Danube, the funding to reconstruct these bridges came from the European Union. Many of these same EU members were also part of NATO, effectively helping pay for the reconstruction of what they had previously destroyed. The bridge, which my train crossed the Danube on, was only temporary. A permanent replacement is still in the planning stages.\n\nThe scars of the bombing can be quantified in terms of physical damage, but the human toll is quite another matter. Precision strikes can limit collateral damage, but not entirely avoid it. Innocents were killed and wounded, some unwittingly used as human shields by the government. Others lived through a trauma they would never forget. The sky looked very different after death and destruction had rained down from above. The NATO airstrikes brought the Milosevic regime to the point of collapse while saving the lives of countless Kosvars, both Albanian and Serb. Meanwhile, Novi Sad paid a heavy price since much of its population opposed the regime. It was unfair, but war is not about fairness. There was no escape for civilians. A sad reminder that one thing remains certain in war, that there will always be losers.\n\nGetting Bombed – Shaking Fists At An Empty Sky\n\nAnd there will always be madmen and women who take on a different persona, transformed by war. One of the less reported aspects of the bombing concerned teenage Serbs. Rather than huddling in shelters, they spent the days drinking and partying. They hung out close to the Danube. When it was time for another round of bombing the police would usher them away. It was an act of reckless defiance. Mortal threats did little to dissuade their behavior. There was something both insane and admirable about such conduct. These young Serbs had few defenses other than liquid courage. It was one way to fight back against the injustice of war. This confirmed what I had heard about Serbs, that they are a very tough people, who love to enjoy life. Here was the youth of a nation dancing in the shadow of death while shaking their fists at an empty sky. While black smoke billowed up and hundred foot flames licked the air, many of Novi Sad’s younger citizens threw caution to the infernal wind. This was perhaps the most appropriate, rather than the safest, response to the grave injustice that fell upon that city by the Danube."
