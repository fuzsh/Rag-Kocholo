        "text": "Being bellows-blown means that its possible to play gajde and sing at the same time, and there are four such songs among the instrumentals on this set. It begins with one, a song announcing the arrival in a village of the matchmaker (the person who connected potential brides and grooms), which Ilijev self-accompanies with the low growl of a G gajde. The ability of the second bore of the chanter to play a harmonising line makes, together with the drone, quite a full-sounding three-part harmony, well exemplified in a song whose title translates as Milka Fed The Nightingale."
