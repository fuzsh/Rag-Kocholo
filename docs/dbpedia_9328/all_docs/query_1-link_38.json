        "text": "I have just returned from a ten-day trip to Serbia. I was the guest of Uro Dojcinovic´, one of former-Yugoslavias most prominent guitarists. He is also a composer, publisher and musicologist. Uro (Urosh) lives in Belgrade and was, as usual, in the middle of a concert tour when I arrived. He gave his first concert when he was 12 and has continued almost non-stop giving concerts in former-Yugoslavia and many other countries for 30 years. We became very good friends during my stay, which was a whirlwind adventure orchestrated by Uro. I played duets with him in concert in a total of seven Serbian cities, played with him on national TV three times, local TV twice, local radio twice, and was interviewed several times by TV, radio and newspaper journalists. Of course, I never wanted to be on national TV, but it was impossible to refuse. On these long drives all over Serbia, I had a chance to talk to Uro and we laughed heartily many times. He is very funny. He has toured in America with a guitarist friend in Texas, James Bogle. One of his delights on that tour was those big fat dill pickles  a pickle for a nickle. (The price has surely gone up now.) I got up early to do tai chi in Belgrade, and he asked, Theo, what on earth are you doink? He meant that it wasn't the safest city in which to be in the park at early hours.\n\nUro taught me how to say in Serbian, Good evening, I dont speak much Serbian, but it is a pleasure to be with you at each concert. The public applauded. At the last concert in Sremska Mitrovica, Uro left me alone in front of the bright lights and cameras of national Yugoslav TV to play one solo piece. I had refused several times before, but I was unable to that last time. He is a great virtuoso and has helped me on the way to getting over my stage-fright. The concert tour promoted our collaboration in the publishing of sheet music for guitar music in Yugoslavia. We played two kolos (Serbian dances) that I have just published, as well as Swedish folk music.\n\nNow I begin work type-setting volume one of a collection of guitar music from Yugoslavia, collected and researched by Uro. I could not have had a better introduction to Serbia, visiting small provincial towns like Pirot, 60 kilometers from the border with Bulgaria (where Uro has also given concerts). What follows is a list of the cities where we played. (I say we a bit shamelessly, because Uros masterful solo performances of very difficult pieces was of course the main item in the concerts.)\n\nJuly 4: Novi Knezevac\n\nJuly 5: Smederevo\n\nJuly 6: Zrenjanin\n\nJuly 7: Kragujevac\n\nJuly 8: Prokuplje\n\nJuly 9: Pirot\n\nJuly 10: Sremska Mitrovica\n\nThe last city is an ancient Roman capital with many Roman ruins. We played outdoors in the museum courtyard, tormented by mosquitoes from the nearby Danube. (Belgrade lies at the convergance of the Danube and Sava rivers.) Sremska Mitrovica is one of the oldest cities in Europe, an important industrial center of the Yugoslav region of Vojvodina. It was originally called Sirmi or Sedmi (said to mean wisdom) in the time of Alexander the Great. The Slavs called it Srem until the 14th century, when it was renamed Dimitrovica, \"the city of Saint Demetrius.\" Dimitrovica became Mitrovica, and finally the ancient name was added, to become the modern Sremska Mitrovica.\n\nIn Pirot (see poster left), the vice-mayor got stinking drunk and was talking loudly on his cell phone during Uros performance. I was the \"special ghost\" (gost=guest). After this performance, Uro was taking his family to the Adriatic coast for summer vacation, so at 2 AM he dropped me off at the impoverished home of my relatives, Milan and Malina Bukvic, in a suburb of Belgrade. They were forewarned, but I was not able to get there earlier. Bodo (short for Slobodan), their son, led me sleepily into their flat. Bodo is 64 and lives in Mostar (very distant), but is staying with his parents helping them until August first. I could not communicate with them other than by sign language and clumsy attempts at Serbian with my dictionary. They live in their own apartment, but it is misery nonetheless. They were very grateful to my mother for her financial help, and said hello to her and the rest of my family in California. Milan is 87 and Malina is 86. She broke her hip a while ago and has trouble walking. They are refugees from the war in Bosnia who had to flee their home in Mostar in 1992 with only the clothes on their backs. I stayed two nights with them. I last saw them 29 years ago in Mostar. They live in poverty. It is sad to see them. I gave them money when I first saw them, with Uro as interpretor. I gave them and additional $50 in Yugoslav money before I left. They almost wept with gratitude. I should have given them all the Yugoslav money I had left, because it is totally worthless outside of Yugoslavia. When I tried to buy a bottle of whiskey at the Belgrade airport duty-free shop, THEY DID NOT ACCEPT YUGOSLAV MONEY!\n\nDuring my visit to Serbia I learned that the title of a book I carried with me  Teach Yourself Serbo-Croat  is no longer politically correct. The people in Serbia today do not like this term, and insist that their language is Serbian, period. People in Bosnia who earned a diploma in Serbo-Croat now say that they speak Bosnian. Not being a linguist, I cant comment on what name is more accurate. But I can comment on the tragic and bitter mood which I encountered in Serbia. After horrifying conflagrations for almost ten years, the political Yugoslavia today has been reduced to Serbia and Montenegro, when once upon a time it comprised six republics and two autonomous regions. (NOTE: Now, in 2010, Yugoslavia is non-existent after Montenegro became independent.) Guitar Compostions from Yugoslavia expresses a wish on the part of the editors to keep alive the originl idea of Yugoslavia (an idea conceived by 19th-century poets and linguists), as well as the harmony intrinsic to music, and the joy and friendship it brings human beings. It is the result of many years of research into the guitar music of his homeland by the master guitarist, composer, musicologist and writer, Uro Dojcinovic. I am indeed grateful to Uro for being my gracious host, guide, chauffeur, translator, guitar duo partner and friend during my visit to Serbia.\n\nNow it was time to return to the EU-part of Europe, my home for decades: Sweden. After going through two metal detectors at the Belgrade airport for my flight back to Stockholm (via London), I was physically searched by a scowling Serb in uniform with a long black club. What on earth was he looking for? As he searched me, I wondered just what circumstance would oblige him to begin beating me with his club, drag me off to a concentration camp, where I would be tortured and summarily executed? It is not unheard of, you know, for Serbian military to do such things. Radic is just as much a Croatian name as a Serbian one. Only a few years ago in this fairytale Balkan land, being a Croat in custody of a Serb soldier could mean a beating, a trip to a concentration camp, torture and/or murder. Serbia is a violent nation, for centuries on good terms with war. With their heavy, dark, orthodox religion, their aberrant patriotism and their refusal to acknowledge their collective crimes, they relive their past centuries of calamities like clockwork."
