        "text": "Serbia is home to over 8.7 million people, making it the 99th-most populous country in the world. Serbia’s most populous city and capital is Belgrade. Belgrade’s population is about 1.17 million, while its metro population is 1.67 million, almost one-fifth of Serbia’s total population. Belgrade serves as Serbia’s and southeastern Europe’s financial center. The second-most populous city is Novi Sad, also the capital of the Vojvodina province, home to over 250,000 people in its city proper and about 277,000 in its urban area. Along with Belgrade, Novi Sad serves the country as a financial and industrial center. Three other cities in Serbia have populations of over 100,000 people: Niš with 183,164 people (260,000 in its administrative area), Kragujevac with 150,835 (179,000), and Subotica with 97,910 (105,681).\n\nAbout 56.26% of Serbia’s population lives in cities and urban areas, while 43.73% live in rural areas. This was a small increase from 2009 when it was 54.77%."
