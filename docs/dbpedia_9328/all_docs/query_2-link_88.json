If it achieves international recognition and gets an ISO country code, I will separate its listing from Serbia's. Some countries have already recognized it, and the U.S. has issued GEC code KV for it, while changing the GEC code for Serbia from RB to RI, to reflect the change in territory. The European Union is using XK as a temporary substitute for an ISO code. \"Geopolitical Entities, Names, and Codes\" (GENC) also assigns it the two-letter code XK, as well as the three-letter code XKS. ISO codes beginning with 'X' are reserved for user-customized codes. Kosovo had been administered under U.N. supervision since 1999. The GEC change was made official by Change Notice 14, published on 2008-07-31. The latest censuses were reported separately for Serbia and Kosovo. For the time being, I list them in two tables.\n\n\"GENC Edition 2\" was issued on 2014-03-31. It has codes for the cities, districts, and municipalities of Serbia, and for the autonomous province Vojvodina (RS-VO). It is intended as the U.S. version of ISO 3166-2. The divisions of Kosovo have GENC codes that begin with XK-, and represent municipalities. ISO has codes for one city, Belgrade, which is at the district level; and for two autonomous provinces, Kosovo and Vojvodina. There are no ISO codes for ordinary cities or municipalities.\n\nISO 3166-2 Newsletter number II-1, dated 2010-02-03 and revised on 2010-02-19, has changes to the listing for Serbia, but nothing substantive. The prefix RS- is explicitly added to each autonomous province code (Kosovo-Metohija, Vojvodina). All of the district names have been changed from the noun to the adjective form (e.g. Pirot to Pirotski okrug). The last six districts in alphabetical order were originally omitted from the list by an oversight.\n\nISO 3166-2 Newsletter I-8, published on 2007-04-17, has ISO codes for the districts of Serbia. They are shown in the table below.\n\nISO 3166-1 Newsletter V-12, dated 2006-09-26, announces the splitting of Serbia and Montenegro into two countries. Serbia is the successor country to Serbia and Montenegro, so this page will still be the place to look for Yugoslavia's history.\n\nFIPS 10-4 Change Notice 11, dated 2006-07-11, assigned new GEC codes to Serbia and Montenegro as separate countries.\n\nOn 2002-03-14, Serbia and Montenegro (the two republics of Yugoslavia) signed an accord. Under its terms, they agreed to restructure their federation, and rename it \"Serbia and Montenegro\" (Serbian: Srbija i Crna Gora) under the eventual new constitution. Montenegro held a referendum on independence from Serbia on 2006-05-21. The required 55% majority was attained, although barely. The National Assembly of Montenegro declared independence on 2006-06-03. On 2006-06-28, Montenegro became the 192nd member of the United Nations. Serbia remains the successor state to Serbia and Montenegro.\n\nFIPS Publication Change Notice No. 9, affecting FIPS PUB 10-4, was issued on 2004-10-01. The only change was the name of the country, from Yugoslavia to Serbia and Montenegro.\n\nISO 3166-1 Newsletter V-8 was published on 2003-07-23. It shows the name of Yugoslavia changed to Serbia and Montenegro. The two-letter country code is changed from YU to CS, and the three-letter code from YUG to SCG. The three-digit code remains unchanged. The new codes were chosen on the basis of the Serbian form of the country name. ISO 3166-2 Newsletter number I-5, dated 2003-09-05, changes the ISO codes for the subdivisions of Yugoslavia so that they contain the new country code.\n\nErratum: The Kingdom of Serbs, Croats, and Slovenes was proclaimed on 1918-12-01, not -04 as stated in the book.\n\nThe position of the United States Department of State from about 1992-2000 was that Montenegro and Serbia were two separate, unrecognized countries. Apparently, after Slobodan Milosevic was defeated in the 2000 election, the U.S. recognized Yugoslavia again. Change Notice 6 to FIPS PUB 10-4 was published on 2001-01-28. The GEC country codes MW (Montenegro) and SR (Serbia) were dropped, to be replaced by YI (Yugoslavia). (Note: the GEC code for Yugoslavia used to be YO, in the period before 1992 when the country consisted of six republics.) Montenegro and Serbia were given codes with a YI prefix.\n\nCountry overview:\n\nShort nameSERBIA ISO codeRS GEC codeRI, KV LanguageSerbian (sr) Time zone+1~ CapitalBelgrade\n\nIn 1900, the Balkans were still balkanized. The Ottoman Empire retained a foothold in Europe. Its vilayet of Kosovo later became part of Yugoslavia, as did northern Monastir and a corner of Saloniki vilayet. Bosnia-Herzegovina and the sanjak of Novibazar, both nominally Ottoman, had been occupied by Austria-Hungary since 1878. Serbia and Montenegro were independent kingdoms. The rest of the area that would eventually become Yugoslavia was in the Austro-Hungarian Empire, including the Austrian provinces of Carniola and Dalmatia, parts of Coastland and Styria, the Hungarian provinces of Fiume and Croatia and Slavonia, and parts of the Hungarian counties of Bács-Bodrog, Csongrád, Temes, and Torontál. In 1908, Austria-Hungary formally annexed Bosnia-Herzegovina. Following the Second Balkan War, by the Bucharest Peace Treaty (1913-08-10), Serbia annexed lands from the Ottoman Empire including its present southern section and what is now the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia. The sanjak of Novibazar was split between Serbia and Montenegro. On 1918-12-01, the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats, and Slovenes was proclaimed. This kingdom was soon being called Yugoslavia, although the name didn't become official until 1929. The peace treaties which ended World War I sanctioned the fait accompli. They left the exact border with Italy open for negotiation (see Croatia and Slovenia for more details about this border, which was again shifted after World War II). Yugoslavia was occupied by the axis powers in World War II. After it was liberated, on 1945-11-29, it proclaimed itself the Federal People's Republic of Yugoslavia, formed as a federation of six constituent republics: Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, Macedonia, Montenegro, Serbia, and Slovenia. Within Serbia there were two autonomous divisions: Kosovo region and Voivodina province. When the Communist bloc fell apart, starting in 1991, the republics began declaring themselves independent. Finally, only Montenegro and Serbia remained in the federation. They claimed to be the successor state to Yugoslavia. The United Nations and the United States rejected this claim, and treated them as two separate unrecognized states, until about 2000. The country changed its name to Serbia and Montenegro in 2003. Montenegro became a separate country in 2006. Kosovo declared independence in 2008. Other countries began recognizing it immediately, but Serbia doesn't, and it doesn't have an ISO code.\n\nOther names of country:\n\nDanish: Serbien, Serbien og Montenegro (obsolete)\n\nDutch: Servië, Staatengemeenschap Servië en Montenegro (formal), Joegoslavië (obsolete), Servië en Montenegro (obsolete)\n\nEnglish: Yugoslavia (obsolete), Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (formal-obsolete)\n\nFinnish: Serbia, Serbia ja Montenegro (obsolete), Jugoslavia (obsolete)\n\nFrench: Serbie f, Serbie-et-Monténégro f (obsolete), Yougoslavie f (obsolete)\n\nGerman: Serbien n, Serbien und Montenegro n (obsolete), Jugoslawien n (obsolete)\n\nIcelandic: Serbía, Serbía og Svartfjallaland (obsolete)\n\nItalian: Serbia f, Serbia e Montenegro m (obsolete), Iugoslavia (obsolete)\n\nNorwegian: Serbia, Serbia og Montenegro (obsolete), Jugoslavia (obsolete)\n\nPortuguese: Sérvia f, Sérvia e Montenegro (obsolete), Estado-Comunidade da Sérvia e Montenegro (formal-obsolete), Iugoslávia f (Brazil-obsolete), Jugoslávia (obsolete)\n\nRussian: Республика Сербия, Югославия (obsolete)\n\nSerbian: Srbija, Srbija i Crna Gora (obsolete), Savezna Republika Jugoslavija (formal-obsolete)\n\nSpanish: Serbia f, Serbia y Montenegro (obsolete), Yugoslavia f (obsolete)\n\nSwedish: Serbien, Serbien och Montenegro (obsolete), Jugoslavien (obsolete)\n\nTurkish: Sırbıstan\n\nOrigin of name:\n\nSerbia: land of the Serbs\n\nPrimary subdivisions:\n\nSerbia is divided into 24 okruzi (sing. okrug: districts) and one grad (city).

HASC codes in the table above were inherited from the codes for the districts of Serbia and Montenegro, viewed as secondary subdivisions, with CS.SR replaced by RS. Exception: the former code for Prizren was CS.SR.PR.\n\nPostal codes:\n\nSerbia uses five-digit postal codes.\n\nFurther subdivisions:\n\nSee the Municipalities of Serbia page.\n\nThe 2011 census reports show a rather complicated territorial breakdown of Serbia. Kosovo has its own census report, which is organized by municipalities. The five districts may still be valid, but they aren't mentioned in the report. As for Serbia, the census report shows it divided at the very top level into Serbia North and Serbia South. Each of those is divided into two regions. The regions are:\n\nRegionN/SCodePopulation BelgradeNB1,659,440 Southern and Eastern SerbiaSE1,563,916 umadija and Western SerbiaSW2,031,697 VojvodinaNV1,931,809\n\nN/S: North or South.\n\nCode: Arbitrary abbreviation\n\nreferenced to table above.\n\nPopulation: 2011-10-22 census\n\nBelgrade region is coextensive with Belgrade city. The other regions are subdivided into districts, as listed under Primary subdivisions. Districts are subdivided in various ways. The secondary divisions are cities (grad) and communes (opstina). The cities Belgrade, Ni, Novi Sad, Poarevac, and Vranje have further subdivisions.\n\nBefore Yugoslavia broke up, it was divided into six socialist republics. One of them, Serbia, was further divided into Serbia proper and two autonomous divisions. All of them - republics and autonomous areas - were in turn divided into opčine (communes).\n\nTerritorial extent:\n\nThe UN LOCODE page for Serbia lists locations in the country, some of them with their latitudes and longitudes, some with their ISO 3166-2 codes for their subdivisions. This information can be put together to approximate the territorial extent of subdivisions.\n\nOrigins of names:\n\nKosovo: field of the black birds\n\nYugoslavia = Serb jugo: south + ethnic name Slav + -ia (country suffix)\n\nChange history:\n\nThis table shows the divisions of Serbia in 1910, according to sources [6] and [8]. Serbia was a good deal smaller then than it is now. It didn't include any of Kosovo or Vojvodina, and Kosovo was somewhat larger than it is today.\n\nThe two sources give different spellings for the names. Source [8], corresponding to the column headed \"SY Name\", is clearly using a transliteration system that differs from modern usage. Another curiosity in source [8] is that it has separate listings for Chachak and Rudnik, whereas source [6] says that Chachak is the capital of Rudnik department. Gornji Milanovac and Rudnik departments were contiguous. I have guessed that source [8] meant Gornji Milanovac when it said Chachak.\n\nDepartmentSY NamePopulationArea(km.²)Capital BelgradeBelgrade220,7092,038Belgrade Gornji MilanovacChachak130,9893,797Gornji Milanovac KragujevacKraguyévatz174,7562,295Kragujevac KrajinaKrayina104,4502,909Negotin KruevacKruzhévatz150,2872,709Kruevac MoravaMorava186,9002,901Ćuprija NiNish183,8542,559Ni PirotPirot104,0862,419Pirot PodrinjePodrinye219,7553,551abac PoarevacPozarevatz243,7054,157Poarevac RudnikRudnik78,1111,570Čačak SmederevoSmederovo134,5741,277Smederevo TimokTimok140,8073,196Zaječar ToplicaToplitza102,5922,839Prokuplje UiceUlitzé138,7603,289Uice ValjevoValyévo143,7102,458Valjevo VranjeVranyé230,7024,341Vranje Total2,688,74748,303\n\nPopulation and area: 1905 (source [8]).\n\n1918-12-01: Kingdom of the Serbs, Croats, and Slovenes was proclaimed.\n\n1920-06-04: Croatia, Slavonia, and western Banat were annexed from Hungary by the Treaty of Trianon.\n\n1920-07-16: Austrian provinces of Coastland, Carniola, Dalmatia, the southern part of Styria, and a small section of Carinthia were incorporated into Kingdom of Serbs, Croats, and Slovenes by the Treaty of Saint-Germain.\n\n1922-04-26: Kingdom of Serbs, Croats, and Slovenes was reorganized into 33 oblasti (sing. oblast: regions).\n\n1929-10-03: Name of the country was officially changed to Yugoslavia (Jugo-Slavia was the preferred transliteration from the Cyrillic alphabet at that time). Yugoslavia was reorganized into nine banovine (sing. banovina, variously translated province, bannate, or prefecture) and one special administrative zone, listed below.\n\nNameCapitalOriginTerritory BelgradeBelgradeWhite citySerbia DravskaLjubljanaDrava R.Slovenia DrinskaSarajevoDrina R.Bosnia, Serbia DunavskaNovi SadDanube R.Serbia, Vojvodina MoravskaNisMorava R.Serbia PrimorskaSplitMaritimeDalmatia, Herzegovina SavskaZagrebSava R.Croatia, Slavonia VardarskaSkopjeVardar R.Macedonia, Kosovo VrbaskaBanja LukaVrbas R.Bosnia ZetskaCetinjeZeta R.Montenegro, Novibazar\n\nName: Province name; Belgrade was a special\n\nadministrative zone.\n\nOrigin: Source of province name, usually the\n\nmain river in the province.\n\nTerritory: Approximate extent of the province,\n\nin terms of previous or subsequent divisions.\n\n(Source [7])\n\n1939-08-26: Under the Cvetkovic-Macek agreement, Hrvatska province was formed by merging Primorska and Savska provinces, plus kotari (districts) taken from other provinces: Brcko, Derventa, Dubrovnik, Fojnica, Gradacac, Ilok, Sid, and Travnik.\n\n1945-11-29: Yugoslavia became the Federal People's Republic of Yugoslavia, comprising six republics: Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, Macedonia, Montenegro, Serbia, and Slovenia.\n\n1946: Name of capital of Montenegro changed from Podgorica to Titograd.\n\n1991-01-25: Macedonia declared independence from Yugoslavia.\n\n1991-10-08: Slovenia declared independence from Yugoslavia.\n\n1992-01-15: Croatia's claim to independence was recognized by the European Union.\n\n1992-04-05: Independence of Bosnia and Herzegovina was proclaimed.\n\n1992: Name of capital of Montenegro restored to Podgorica.

The word \"remaining\", of course, refers to the fact that since 1990, four of Yugoslavia's six original republics had broken away. The final standard shows the same two republics with the same codes. They are no longer described as remaining or socialist. In addition, there are two new entries for the two autonomous provinces of Serbia. Officially, Serbia contains these two provinces, as well as a substantially larger area of Serbia proper.
