        "text": "Heightened security is likely in Zrenjanin, Vojvodina Province, over the coming hours following calls for an election-related protest in the city Dec. 28. The purpose of the demonstration, which was reportedly scheduled to begin at 18:00 in front of the city's former \"Belgrade\" department store, is to denounce alleged irregularities in the Dec. 17 election. The number of people who gathered to participate in the protest was not immediately clear.\n\nTransport and business disruptions cannot be ruled out in areas that are subject to protest activity. Clashes between demonstrators and security forces are possible, especially if protesters fail to heed any orders issued by police to disperse. Similar demonstrations may materialize in Zrenjanin and other cities over the coming days."
