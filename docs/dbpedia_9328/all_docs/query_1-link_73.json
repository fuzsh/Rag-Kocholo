        "text": "Birding Serbia\n\nIn terms of biodiversity, the Balkan Peninsula is recognized as one of Europe’s finest birding regions. Within it, Serbia compares well with already established birding destinations like neighbouring Hungary or Bulgaria, as it has a greater diversity of habitats and birds than Hungary and a better infrastructure than Bulgaria. Reasonably good (and improving) accommodation is available near birding sites and, with the new democratic government and the return of political stability, the country is poised to provide the traveller with an exciting birding experience.\n\nBird NumbersThe number of bird species recorded in Serbia is 360 species. In recent years, 239 bird species were recorded breeding in Serbia (123 non-passerines and additional 116 passerines), quite a few of them increasing their breeding ranges: Black-headed Bunting, Cetti’s Warbler, Red-rumped Swallow, Black Redstart, etc.Significant percentages of European populations of Saker Falcon, Little Bittern, Purple Heron, Ferruginous Duck, Scops Owl, Middle Spotted and Syrian Woodpeckers, to mention but a few, breed in Serbia. Among the breeding birds, there are 103 species of European conservation concern (SPECs), which include six species of global conservation concern: Ferruginous Duck, Egyptian Vulture, Imperial Eagle, Lesser Kestrel, Great Bustard and Corncrake. Interestingly, while they were not yet recorded in Serbia in the breeding season, Masked Shrike, Olive-tree Warbler and Sardinian Warbler were seen breeding just south of the border and it is not unlikely that some pairs might choose localities further north.For more detailed bird species data, check under extensive Top Sites.\n\nRegionsNorth of Belgrade, the Pannonian plain is a lowland landscape with large rivers (Danube, Sava and Tisa), and to the south, hilly/mountainous landscapes are intersected by river valleys. Forest covers 27% of Serbia (25,625 km2), with the proportion of conifers being only 10%. For more detailed data on birding sites and habitats, check under Top Sites.\n\nWhen to goSun can be formidable: don’t forget a wide-brimmed hat, water bottle and sunscreen cream. For wetland areas, insect repellent is also heartily recommended. An early start to any birding day is essential – mid-day summer temperatures often climb well into the thirties.Depending on your particular interest, opt for March/April (spring migration), May to July (breeding season), August to October (autumn migration and occasional vagrants), November/December when waterbird migration reaches its peak, or January/February period when more than 250,000 waterbirds overwinter on the lower Danube.\n\nLogisticsAs Serbia is not a large country (only marginally smaller than Portugal, Hungary or the US state of Indiana) and the infrastructure is fairly well developed, it is possible to explore it in about dozen days and, with some advance planning and guidance from the local experts, build up a list of more than 150 species. Bear in mind that the local experts are concentrated in Belgrade and north of it and harder to find further south. Among travel guides, due to its extensive coverage of natural history and birding sites, recommendation goes to Laurence Mitchell’s Serbia: The Bradt Travel Guide (4th edition, 2007). The time has finally come for Serbia to be appreciated as another excellent birding destination in the Balkans."
