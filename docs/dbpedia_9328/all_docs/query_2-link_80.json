        "text": "Serbia is a Republic (Republika Srbija). The Parliament (National Assembly - Narodna skupština) is unicameral. The Government is led by a Prime Minister and the Head of State is the President. After the collapse of former Yugoslavia, Serbia and Montenegro formed the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia from 1992 to 2002. From 2003 to 2006, it was a confederation. Since 2006, Montenegro and Serbia are two independent countries.\n\nSerbia is a unitary State which recognises local self-government. The 2006 Constitution foresees three levels of governance: central, provincial and local. The Autonomous Provinces date back to Tito's Yugoslavia: in 1974, Vojvodina, Kosovo and Metohija were granted significant autonomy. This autonomy was ended in the 1980s and restored in 2002. On 14 December 2009, the statute of the Autonomous Province of Vojvodina was adopted. The same year, the Law on establishing competencies of the Autonomous Province of Vojvodina transferred competences from the State to the Province. Serbia does not formally recognise Kosovo and Metohija's independence which was proclaimed on 17 February 2008 and considers it as an Autonomous Province.\n\nThe Constitution provides that the substantial autonomy for Kosovo and Metohija shall be regulated by a special law (art. 182). Kosovo and Metohija is under the interim civilian administration and security peace[1]. However, Kosovo's independence is recognised by 109 UN member state and by the EU[2]. In 2013, the Serbian government announced it was dissolving the Serb minority assemblies it had created in northern Kosovo, in order to allow the integration of the Kosovo Serb minority into the general population of Kosovo and support the two countries in their EU ascension bids[3].\n\nParliamentary elections were held on 8th June 2014 in Kosovo and in Serbia on 24th April 2016 in order to provide stability for the accession to the EU bid. Prime Minister Aleksandar Vučić's Serbian Progressive Party retained the majority. A largely unchanged government was announced on 8th August 2016, and approved was by the National Assembly on 10th August 2016[4].\n\nSerbia began the process for accession to the European Union on 1 March 2012. The implementation of the Stabilization and Association Agreement between the EU and Kosovo came into force in April 2016. This is a ten year plan to see the application of EU standards across state departments, market integration and state reform[5].\n\nFollowing the adoption of the Constitution in 2006, a set of important laws on decentralisation were passed which granted local self-government units with powers.\n\nAs of today and according to the Constitution, Serbia is composed of two Autonomous Provinces (autonomne pokrajine) (Vojvodina as well as Kosovo and Metohija,) and the local self-government units, i.e. the City of Belgrade, 23 Cities (grad) and 150 Municipalities (opstina). Municipalities are the basic local self-government units. Cities have more than 100.000 inhabitants. The City of Belgrade has a special status[6].\n\nThe Autonomous Province of Vojvodina contains 7 Districts, 6 Cities and 45 Municipalities. The rights and duties of the Province are described in the Constitution and in the Province's Statute. Kosovo-Metohija consists of 29 Municipalities and 5 districts.\n\nIn addition, Serbia has 5 Regions for statistical purposes (Belgrade Region, Vojvodina Region, Sumadija and Western Serbia Region, Eastern and Southern Serbia Region and Kosovo and Metohija Region) and 29 administrative Districts.\n\nLocal self-government and provincial autonomy are enshrined in the Constitution (Art. 12 and 176) and in the Law on Local Self-Government . Provinces and local authorities have the status of legal entities. Local self-government units are not bestowed with legislative powers; they exercise their functions by means of regulations.\n\nLocal authorities and autonomous provinces have a general competence for matters of local/provincial interest respectively, and in accordance with the subsidiarity principle (Art. 177). The Constitution sets out the competences of the Autonomous Provinces (art. 183) and of the local self-government units (art. 190). The allocated competences are shared. In addition, the central Government may delegate some competences.\n\nBesides the Constitution, the division of powers between the different levels of governance is specified by various laws:\n\nLaw on Implementation of the Constitution of the Republic of Serbia (November 2006)\n\nLaw on Territorial Organisation of the Republic of Serbia (Official Gazette of the Republic of Serbia, No. 129/07),\n\nLaw on the Establishment of Competencies of the Autonomous Province (Official Gazette of the Republic of Serbia, No. 99/09 and 67/2012 - Constitutional Court Decision).\n\nLaw on the Capital City (Official Gazette of the Republic of Serbia, No. 129/07)\n\nthe Law on Local Elections (Official Gazette of the Republic of Serbia\", no. 129/07, 34/10 – Constitutional Court Decision and 54/2011)\n\nLaw on Local self-g​overnment(Official Gazette of the Republic of Serbia, No. 129/07, defines the competences of local authorities,\n\nLaw on Local Government Finance, regulates the financing of local self-government units,\n\nLaw on Regional Development (Official Gazette of the Republic of Serbia, No. 51/09 and 30/10)\n\nLocal Self-Government Funding Act (Official Gazette of the Republic of Serbia, Nos. 62/06, 47/2011, 93/2012 and 99/13),\n\nAutonomous Provinces have direct revenues for the exercise of their competences. In accordance with the Serbian Constitution, Vojvodina's budget shall amount to at least 7% (65.19 milijardi dinara) of Serbia's budget[7].\n\nLocal self-government units' budgets are derived from own and shared taxation, grants and fees[8]. The Republic is obliged to provide local authorities with adequate funds[9].\n\n1.1 Central level\n\nState responsibilities\n\nThe Serbian Government is responsible for the development and implementation of laws and policies (aligned to the Constitution) through the following ministries and their associated departments and parliamentary groups/ committees:\n\nMinistry of Finance\n\nMinistry of Economy\n\nMinistry of Agriculture and Environmental Protection\n\nMinistry of Construction, Transport and Infrastructure\n\nMinistry of Mining and Energy\n\nMinistry of Trade, Tourism and Telecommunications\n\nMinistry of Justice\n\nMinistry of Public Administration and Local Self-Government\n\nMinistry of the Interior\n\nMinistry of Defence\n\nMinistry of Foreign Affairs\n\nMinistry of Education, Science and Technological Development\n\nMinistry of Health\n\nMinistry of Labour, Employment, Veteran and Social Affairs\n\nMinistry of Youth and Sport\n\nMinistry of Culture and the Media\n\nNational Department of Regional Development\n\n1.2 Regional level\n\nResponsibilities of the Provinces\n\nIn accordance with the Constitution (Art. 183), and the Autonomous Provinces may regulate matters of provincial interest in the field of:\n\nRegional development and relations with European Union and other regional bodies on projects related to infrastructure, construction, institution strengthening etc.\n\nUrban planning and development;\n\nAgriculture;\n\nWater management;\n\nCatering;\n\nForestry;\n\nHunting;\n\nFishing;\n\nTourism;\n\nHospitality industry;\n\nSpas and health resorts;\n\nEnvironmental protection;\n\nIndustry and craftsmanship;\n\nRoads;\n\nRiver and rail traffic, road design;\n\nEvents organisation;\n\nEducation;\n\nSport;\n\nCulture;\n\nHealthcare;\n\nSocial welfare;\n\nPublic information;\n\nRealisation of human and minority rights;\n\nDetermined symbols of Autonomous Provinces and ways of using them;\n\nManaging the property of Autonomous Provinces;\n\nHaving the original income, the provision of funds to local level for performing delegated tasks, bringing the budget and final accounts.\n\n1.3 Local level\n\nResponsibilities of the Municipalities and Cities (Constitution, art. 190)\n\nLocal municipalities have responsibilities to create and manage institutions and organisations which relate to the following:\n\nRegulation and provision of municipal services;\n\nUrban planning;\n\nLocal roads; railways, waterways and public transport provision;\n\nEducation;\n\nCulture;\n\nHealthcare;\n\nSocial welfare;\n\nChild and family welfare;\n\nSport;\n\nTourism;\n\nAgriculture;\n\nOther tasks specified by the law.\n\nMoreover, Cities also have competence in the field of local police.\n\n[1] UNSCR 1244, adopted on 10.06.1999.\n\n[2] Given the European Union recognition of Kosovo as an independent republic, the country has its own profile, separate to that of Serbia in the DoP database.\n\n[3] Reuters (19 April 2013) EU brokers historic Kosovo deal, doors open to Serbia accession\n\n[4] Reuters (11 August 2016) New Serbian government gets parliament approval\n\n[5] Stabilisation and Association Agreement between the European Union and the European Atomic Energy Community, of the one part, and Kosovo*, of the other part (2 October 2015)\n\n[6] A special law defines the competences of Belgrade: Law on the Capital City, No. 129/2007.\n\n[7] Constitutiuon, Article 184.\n\n[8] Law on local government finance Official Gazette of the Republic of Serbia, No. 62/2006.\n\n[9] Law on local government finance, Official Gazette of the Republic of Serbia, No. 62/2006.
