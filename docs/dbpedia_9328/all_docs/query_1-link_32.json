        "text": "The Library of Congress holds almost 200 newspapers published in Serbia or by the Serbian diaspora. Most of the titles are from the capital Beograd, but a significant number also originated in Vojvodina. The majority of the titles are from the 20th and 21st centuries, with only a handful from earlier centuries. Holdings from the communist and post-communist eras are particularly strong, with many central Yugoslav titles, including long runs of several important dailies, such as Borba and Politika, and current titles such as Republika, Sport, and Danas. Highlights of the collection include a complete run of Radenik, the first socialist newspaper published in the Balkans, a number of rare German-language titles from the inter-war period in Vojvodina, many issues of the anti-Milošević newspaper, Demokratija, and a newspaper in Bulgarian, Ustrem, published in Beograd for the Bulgarian occupation forces during World War II. The Library continues to receive newspapers from Vojvodina representing linguistic minorities in Serbia, such as Magyar szó in Hungarian and Ruske slovo in Rusyn.\n\nThe Library of Congress is currently receiving a number of North American Serbian diaspora newspapers, including American Srbobran, or Amerikanski Srbobran, the oldest continuous Serbian-American newspaper, published in Pittsburgh since 1906. The Library has many years of this title on microfilm and will continue to microfilm it in the future. Other titles include Sloboda from Chicago, the Path of Orthodoxy from Pennsylvania, and Glas kanadskih srba from Toronto. Newspapers published outside of Serbia, including the titles from the United States and Canada, appear in a special section below entitled \"Diaspora.\"\n\nWithin each section, the titles in the holdings list below are arranged by place of publication and then alphabetically by title. Most newspapers from Serbia were published in the Cyrillic script, but some also appeared in the Roman script, in the language now called Bosnian/Croatian/Serbian (B/C/S) by Western scholars. In the entries below the language is designated as B/C/S and the script is indicated by \"Cyrillic\" or \"Roman.\" Microfilm holdings are available for interlibrary loan, but loose paper issues and bound volumes are not. This bibliography does not include Library of Congress holdings of official legal gazettes or other titles held by the Law Library of Congress. All digital issues available via Stacks, a Library of Congress database for digital content, may be accessed onsite only.\n\nSelect the title of any newspaper listed below to view fuller bibliographic information for that item in the Library of Congress Online Catalog. Links to electronic versions are provided when available. \"Bibliographic source\" refers to a printed bibliography or online catalog used to verify publication dates or other data about the newspapers.\n\nNewspapers in this guide are held in various divisions of the Library of Congress.
