On behalf of his hometown of Yantai, Wang extended an invitation to Zrenjanin and Serbian friends to visit Yantai, a seaside city with a long history and stunning scenery.\n\nSalapura, the mayor of Zrenjanin, said China and Serbia enjoy a solid friendship. As a sister city of Yantai, Zrenjanin, though a small city in terms of population and size, has a long history and strong sporting culture.\n\nBoth cities expressed hope of furthering friendly exchanges and cooperation in the fields of trade, agriculture, culture, health and other fields."
