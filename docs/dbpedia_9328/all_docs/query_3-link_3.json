        "text": "Rising multicultural city\n\nContinuing our journey of discovering some of the less known, but precious spots and regions in the Balkan. Allow me to present you the city with the oldest theatre hall in Serbia,the best choir in the world and the city of sports manifestations and the twelve sportsmen at the Olympic Games in Beijing (2008), Zrenjanin. This hidden gem of Serbia is something you, I am convinced, haven't heard off, so lay back and keep reading what this glorious city has to offer. You will definitely broaden your horizons and pick it for your next getaway destination.\n\nZrenjanin, the third largest city of Vojvodina region, after Novi Sad and Subotica, is the administrative center of the Central Banat District in the autonomous province of Vojvodina, Serbia. Its development has lasted for almost seven centuries, because, as a settlement under the name of Becskerek, it was first recorded in historical documents way back in 1326. Today, Zrenjanin is the most attractive city for investment and the city of the most favourable business conditions in Serbia, as assessed by the World Bank.\n\nToday, when you come to Zrenjanin, you are coming to the city of multi-culturalism, multi-denominationalism, and tolerance among nations, as well as to the city of culture, arts, sports, to the city of bridges, the city of the young ones, and the to city of vigorous economic growth. The most renowned trademarks of Zrenjanin are the National Museum or Historical Archives, but also by worldwide famous sports names such as Dejan Bodiroga, Snezana Peric, Grbic brothers, Ivan Lendjer, Ivana Spanovic and Maja Ognjenovic. Another things that are closely associated by the mention of the city of Zrenjanin are amazing performances of the puppet theater, the watercolor colony gatherings, as well as by numerous cultural events as a part of the traditional tourist and commercial event called \"Beer Days\", which has been held in the last week of August for already 23 years.\n\nThe high speed development of Zrenjanin has been rather fascinating and quite promising it will become the next \"it\" tourist destination. In fact, after being known as \"the biggest food factory in the Balkans\", and after it has got over difficult years and the period of transition, today, Zrenjanin is one of the most attractive cities for investment in Serbia. In addition, in 2007, it was declared the City of the Future and, in 2008, the World Bank ranked it first among the cities/towns in Serbia with regard to the overall organization of its business environment.\n\nUpon entering the city, you will definitely feel a strong blend of past and present times, the rich preserved history combined with the modern development that has been in process for some time now.If you really pay attention while walking around the city, you hear that the people speak different languages such as Serbian, Hungarian, Slovakian, Romanianm, since the citizens of Zrenjanin are representatives of 20 national minorities who testify about the extremely rich multilingual and multicultural environment of the city and the region.\n\nIn the very central square of Zrenjanin, you will definitely not miss to see the biggest pride of the city, the former County Court, which today represents the City House. This representative building from 1820 is the work of Josip Fischer. Interestingly enough, the hall buildings are made of stained glass that personify Power, Justice and Wisdom.\n\nIn fact, most of the buildings in the old city center were built at the beginning of the 20th century by wealthy merchants. The most famous such monumental buildings are the magnificent Bukovec palace, the house of the trader Stevan Bukovac from 1905, the Severezade built in the Moorish style, the first department store, now known as Bence's house. Also, the multi-storey building \"Vodotoranj\" built in 1964 definitely dominates the very center of Zrenjanin.\n\nAfter all, Zrenjanin would not be a Balkan city, if it does not offer an array of the best places to wine and dine, have traditional coffee as well as party like there is no tomorrow. Apart from the uncountable events and manifestations such as already mentioned Beer Days, Soundlove, The Story of Banat, Korzo Fest and many, many other, you may enjoy in the tradditional Serbian cuisine in the best restaurants such as Kamel, Four Fat Horses, Lola and Boemian.\n\nFinally, at the crossroad of major inland routes and waterways, 50 kilometers away from Novi Sad, 75 from Belgrade, and 50 from the border with the European Union (Romania), Zrenjanin is nowadays an open city, ready to accept new ideas, way of business thinking or development of new technologies. Zrenjanin is also the city of traditional hospitality and opportunities for a pleasant stay in its environs. Come, and see for yourselves."
