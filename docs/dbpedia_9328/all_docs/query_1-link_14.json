        "text": "Novi Sad, city and administrative capital of the ethnically mixed autonomous region of Vojvodina in northern Serbia. It is a transit port on the heavily trafficked Danube River northwest of Belgrade and is also situated on the Belgrade-Budapest rail line.\n\nBefore the 18th century Novi Sad was a small fishing village called Petrovaradinski šanac (“Petrovaradin Ditch”). In the south bend of the Danube is the Petrovaradin Fortress, which was rebuilt by the Austrians into the present huge structure after 1699 as part of the military frontier with the Ottoman Empire. During the period of Turkish rule of Serbia south of the Danube, Novi Sad became a centre of Serbian culture in Austrian lands, especially after the Serbian literary society Matica Srpska was founded there in 1826.\n\nThe Bačka canal system connects with the Danube at Novi Sad, which is the economic and cultural focus for northern Vojvodina. The ethnic diversity of the region is exemplified by the Public Broadcasting Service of Vojvodina (formerly Radio Television Novi Sad), which broadcasts in Serbo-Croatian, Hungarian, Slovak, Romanian, Ukrainian, and Romany languages among others."
