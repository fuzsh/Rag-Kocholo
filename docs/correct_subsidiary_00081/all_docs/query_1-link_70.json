        "text": "Nashville, TN – Three-time Grammy Award-winning singer, songwriter, and now author Lucinda Williams has released a new video for “Rock n Roll Heart,” the title track from her critically acclaimed new album Stories from a Rock n Roll Heart (Highway 20 Records/Thirty Tigers). The new clip marks the first time in over three decades that Williams has starred in one of her videos, the last being 1988’s “Passionate Kisses” from her highly revered album, Lucinda Williams (aka The Rough Trade Album). The video was directed by Neilson Hubbard and Joshua Britt.\n\nReleased on June 30th, Stories from a Rock n Roll Heart is Williams’ first album since suffering a stroke in 2020. The album received high praise from the media, including a feature segment on CBS Sunday Morning. Williams was the subject of major features in publications that include Rolling Stone, Billboard, Relix, The FADER, SPIN and many more.\n\nLast week, Williams was named one of Forbes’ “50 over 50,” the third annual celebration of women making their greatest impact at age 50 and beyond. The list is produced in partnership with Mika Brzezinski of MSNBC’s Morning Joe and her Know Your Value initiative. Williams is featured in the “Lifestyle” category that includes Jamie Lee Curtis, Patti LaBelle, Annie Leibovitz, Katie Couric, Judy Blume, and many other prestigious authors, designers, CEOs, filmmakers, innovators, and influencers.\n\nIn April, Williams released her long-awaited memoir, Don’t Tell Anybody The Secrets I Told You (Crown, a division of Penguin Random House LLC). The memoir debuted at #5 on The New York Times Bestsellers and she was featured on the cover of The New York Times Sunday Styles. Williams was also featured at Vanity Fair, NPR All Things Considered, The Associated Press, Esquire and more, including a sit-down appearance on Late Night with Seth Meyers in April."
