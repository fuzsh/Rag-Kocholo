        "text": "After a six year hiatus, Practical Pedagogies returns in 2024. To say I was excited when Russel first floated the idea would be an understatement!\n\nPractical Pedagogies is a conference like no other. Over to Russel Tarr to explain:\n\nEducational conferences can be prohibitively expensive for ordinary teachers, and often focus on abstract theory rather than real-world ways of immediately improving classroom practice. In contrast, “Practical Pedagogies” believes the best training is delivered by practising teachers, sharing effective and creative strategies and resources at an affordable price.\n\nThree successful Practical Pedagogies conferences took place in 2015, 2016 and 2018 at the International School of Toulouse, France and at St. George’s British International School Cologne. At each event, teachers from all over the world delivered upwards of 100 sessions in a vibrant, friendly and enriching event over two days. Lunches, refreshments, and evening gatherings provided social opportunities for carrying on the conversations with old friends and new acquaintances.\n\nAfter a COVID-imposed hiatus, we hope that the next conference in November 2024, once more in Cologne, will be the biggest and best so far… and delegates will be encouraged to purchase their tickets from March onwards.\n\nRussel Tarr, lead organiser\n\nHaving been at all three previous conferences I immediately signed up to present and am looking forward to talking about A few of our favourite things! Activities for the Primary Languages classroom\n\nYou can find out what I thought about and learned from the conference in 2015, 2016 and 2018 by clicking on the dates and reading my reflections accompanied by my sketchnotes (subject of my 2026 presentation!) If you want to know what others think, check out the testimonials here including mine. I stand by my assertion that you can’t leave unchallenged and unchanged! One of the things I particularly value is that, as it is an international conference, you get a wider view of education and a different perspective on familiar topics. I love picking up wisdom from other education systems and curricula as well as debating the current issues facing us all.\n\nThis year I’m looking forward to finding out about Using Thinking Maps to enhance instructional experiences for variable learners, learning more about AI (no point burying your head in the sand!) and also catching up with Laura ‘smiley’ Riley-Genton who has had a busy time since I last saw her (getting married, becoming a Mum and changing job!) and attending her session More than just a language:ideas to teach foreign languages to mixed nationalities. I’m also looking forward to catching up with Carol Allen although I unfortunately won’t be able to attend her session as I’m speaking at the same time. You can check out the programme for yourself here.\n\n125 workshops have been confirmed, led by educators from all over the world – including me! – and delegates can pick 8 to attend over the two days. There are a limited number of Early Bird tickets available if you’re quick! It’s worth it as the price rises after that.\n\nI’m also looking forward to visiting Cologne/Köln once more.It’s a wonderful city and this time I can even speak almost passable German! I’d love to see you there. Lisa x\n\nToday at The Language Show it was my pleasure to deliver a presentation entitled A few of our favourite things.\n\nDuring a packed 45 minutes I highlighted as many of the things that my pupils say they enjoy as I could. I do talk very fast but as is often the case, I had far more to say than there was time to share.\n\nAs promised you can find my slides below including links to things I mentioned such as the songs and games. If you have any questions, please feel free to post them in the comments below. And if you bought a ticket, you can access my presentation (along with many many more!) on catch up. I’m looking forward to doing just that over the next week or so.\n\nClickable links from presentation –\n\nSlide 2 Spanish video\n\nSlide 7 Spanish games\n\nSlide 8 Youtube playlist including minibook tutorial\n\nSlide 10 Miguel y Sabo video\n\nSlide 12 Isabella Springmuhl Tejada – Intro – https://youtu.be/ZypUTsEh1-o Sp/Eng explanation https://youtu.be/nbwc2DYofkI and intervie https://youtu.be/TH3g1qe_kko\n\nSlide 15 Yummy Yucky PPT\n\nSlide 17 Songs (clockwise from top left)- Hola a todos Los días Uno dos tres choc ¿Te gusta el helado?

Hopefully one day I’ll get to present a whole session on it (or record one of my own!) but until then, please have a look at the project blog from the point of view of our school here and the whole project blog (which was written by the Greek partners) here.\n\nEarly in October I took part in the Talleres de español at Instituto Español Vicente Cañada Blanch in Portobello, London. It was quite a treat to attend and participate in a face to face conference, and I thoroughly enjoyed the day in spite of the pouring rain and general exhaustion!\n\nMy presentation was entitled Take One Book, considering how one book can be used as the inspiration and impetus for a wide variety of activities in the primary language classroom. You can read a little about it and view my slides in a previous post.\n\nWhen I was asked to speak, the organisers asked if I would be willing to write up my talk for publication in a special edition of TECLA, the Consejería magazine. I agreed and the magazine has just been published. I am really proud to be part of such a prestigious publication, and hope that it is well received and useful to readers.\n\nBelow is the first page and you can download the whole article below that.\n\nOther contributions include an interview with Baroness Coussins, an article on using important artists as the vehicle for Spanish learning, and a report on using MFL projects to build bridges at QKA in Peterborough where 52 languages are spoken by the school community. The full list of articles is below. I’m looking forward to reading through the articles over the holidays when I have time to digest.\n\nI once more had the pleasure of presenting at Language World, the annual conference of Association for Language Learning (ALL).\n\nMy presentation was entitled Take One Book and was the sequel to the presentation I did at PHOrum in November (you can read about it here) this time choosing a book that was originally written in Italian and has no English translation.\n\nI really enjoyed sharing my ideas of how to use ¡Ojo Oso! and was pleasantly surprised that I managed to finish in time and have time for questions. I experimented with using subtitles/captions during my presentation after comments by Helen Simpson on LiPS made me think about accessibility. I need to watch back the recording of my session (which has just been made available for those who registered for the conference but missed the session) to see exactly how accurate they were but I know that when I spoke Spanish they definitely had trouble as they were set to English! For example un agujero became ‘all alcohol’ and una madriguera became ‘mother together.’\n\nBelow you can find a PDF of my presentation. I’ve removed the story slides due to copyright but you can find links to versions of the story read online, as well as to where you can purchase a copy.\n\nAt the end there is a link to my Pinterest where I collected together materials for the talk, some of which I didn’t use! You can also access it via this QR code.\n\nPerhaps you have ideas that spring to mind? Or you have a book that you could use in a similar way? If you have any comments or questions, do leave a comment below.\n\nPostscript – you can watch the ‘standby/rehearsal’ recording of the session here.\n\nAs mentioned in an earlier post, I was asked to speak at The Language Show which this year went online and was delivered via Zoom. Below is my presentation and brief notes on what I talked about.\n\nThank you to all those who saw it ‘live’ for being there – even if I couldn’t see your faces which I found quite disconcerting – and for your questions and comments. I saved the chat and enjoyed reading back your comments. Any questions that were in the chat and not put into the Q&A tab so therefore went unanswered, I’ll answer below.\n\nIf you want to see me delivering it live, you can view the recording of the session for the next month (so until mid December 2020 I would think) via the Language Show website and clicking on my name (see below)\n\nBelow are links to resources, reading and things on which I commented/shared as there are lost of hyperlinked images!\n\nThe pitfalls of Google Translate https://www.redlinels.com/pros-and-cons-of-google-translate/\n\nPhysical Spanish Phonics https://brilliantpublications.co.uk/physical-spanish-phonics.html\n\nHands of the World at WCPS http://www.whitehousecommon.bham.sch.uk/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=3020:this-is-me-signed-in-makaton-hands-of-the-world-project&catid=81&Itemid=278\n\nOld World Language Families Tree https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/59665/feast-your-eyes-beautiful-linguistic-family-tree See also http://www.sssscomic.com/comic.php?page=195\n\nOxford University Press dictionary sheets https://global.oup.com/education/content/dictionaries/free-resources/oxford-school-dictionary-word-origins-free-resources/?region=uk\n\nSomething Rhymes with Purple podcast https://play.acast.com/s/somethingrhymeswithpurple\n\nLanguage Links posters https://www.lightbulblanguages.co.uk/resources-language-links.htm\n\nSlide 37 worksheet https://www.lightbulblanguages.co.uk/resources/PrimarySpanish/days.pdf\n\nSlide 36 The great Eskimo vocabulary hoax and other irreverent essays on the study of language. http://www.lel.ed.ac.uk/~gpullum/EskimoHoax.pdf\n\nFuturelearn course on Intercultural Studies – Language and Culture https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/intercultural-studies-language-culture\n\neTwinning https://www.britishcouncil.org/etwinning\n\nLet’s Go Cultural! Erasmus+ project https://erasmusplusletsgocultural.blogspot.com/\n\nFind out more here too. WCPS Let’s Go Cultural blog\n\nIn the chat Lisa Ng asked about the exercise on slide 21. It’s from a unit on your town and the task the children were doing was using the structure En mi pueblo hay (place) Aquí se puede (infinitive) We’ve been talking about what there is/isn’t in our town, and what our town is like, and moved on to looking at infinitives. The task was supported by a ‘trapdoor’ grid that we’d used to rehearse the structure. The child whose work I shared had extended his sentences using adjectives which weren’t on the grid and applied his previous learning of adjectival position and agreement. I’d suggested it as a way to enhance their writing but not pushed the point which was why I was so pleased.\n\nPaula asked if I remembered The Language Show a few years ago at Olympia with my trolley of resources. Of course I do! I still have it although in Covid19 times it has been rested for a bit as I’m not allowed to use as many resources.\n\nAnd I’d just like to reiterate what people were saying in the chat about making mistakes and being an example to your learners. I completely agree – modelling how we deal with mistakes, and showing that we are lifelong learners is SO important. One of my Y4 classes answer the register by greeting me in variety of languages and I’m trying to learn (and remember!) the response to each. They’re being very patient and keep repeating it until I get it correct. Problem is, by the time the next week comes, I’ve forgotten most of it. I keep trying though – which is all I ask of them!\n\nFinally, if you teach primary languages in the UK, I recommended joining Languages in Primary School group (LiPS) on Facebook. Here’s the link. Please make sure you answer all 3 questions when you ask to join! https://www.facebook.com/groups/primarylanguages\n\nIf you have any questions, please leave a comment below and I’ll answer.\n\nI’ll leave you with Westlife – More than words\n\nDue to current circumstances The Language Show, which is normally held in November at Olympia in London, is going online this year.\n\nHeld the weekend 13th-15th November, the show has three streams of talks:\n\nFor those who love languages – talks, entertainment and insights.\n\nFor language teachers – CPD for teachers in primary, secondary, HE, FE, adult, EFL/ESOL\n\nFor language professionals – interpreters, translators and those who want to put their languages to work\n\nEach stream offers a programme of seminars starting mid morning on Friday Saturday and Sunday and are all free to attend via Zoom. Some that have caught my eye include\n\nFriday 13.30-14.15: Unlocking the hidden meanings of everyday words which is all hidden meanings and ancient connections, and the etymology of words.\n\nSaturday 13.30-14.15: Foods and Words: Can our appetite motivate language learning? which looks at the history of some staple British food of foreign origin and introduces basic linguistic principles to understanding their names.\n\nSunday 11.00-11.45: 5 Weeks of Low-Prep Fun in the Language Classroom – Janina Klimas which offers 25 easy-to-prepare, engaging activities and resources that get students excited about learning languages and through some of the rough parts, all while having fun.\n\nFriday 15.30-16.15: Introduction to subtitling – Lindsay Bywood which will cover the various types of subtitling, how they are created, how the industry is set up and how to train and get work as a subtitler.\n\nI’m definitely signing up for “We Are Multilingual”: Identity-based activities to promote and enhance language learning which is being delivered on Sunday 14.30-15.15 by Linda Fisher and Karen Forbes on behalf of the Multilingual Identity in Education group at the Faculty of Education, University of Cambridge.\n\nOn Saturday from 1300-1345 you can join me as I talk about how language learning is about More than words. Here’s the blurb!\n\n“This session explores the notion that learning a language is about so much more than lists of words and grammar. Drawing from the speaker’s own observations and experiences as a lifelong language learner as well as a teacher and mother, we will consider the importance of context, culture, communication, celebration and connections in nurturing learners with an enduring passion for language(s).”\n\nYou can register for free now on the website Follow all the latest news by following The Language Show on Twitter or Facebook.\n\nHopefully ‘see’ some of you there!\n\nContinuing on the theme of colours, the next story I decided to share with the children is all about Elmer the elephant.\n\nIn the book, we meet Elmer and his multiple colours, and then discover things that are that colour like snow, an ice lolly and fruit.\n\nHere it is:\n\nSince recording it, I’ve discovered the video below which takes the book towards the story of Elmer in which he wants to be the same as everyone else to fit in. [You can find that story here.] They each colour in a picture of Elmer and explore the idea of being the same but different\n\nThen I found this song that is really lovely and worth sharing with children as it speaks about the value of diversity.\n\nThe lyrics are:\n\nDe mil colores es su piel\n\nse llama Elmer y es genial\n\nun elefante quiere ser\n\nde igual color que los demás. (2 veces)\n\nPara ser feliz no hay que ser igual\n\npara sonreír no hay que ser igual\n\npara divertir no hay que ser igual\n\nporque el color no importará. (2 veces)\n\n(Elmer, el elefante de colores – Canción del cuento de David McKee\n\nAutor: Juan Rafael Muñoz Muñoz\n\nArreglo: Luis Miguel González)\n\nI also like this version of the songs with pictograms to aid understanding.\n\nIf you’d like another version of the story I shared, here’s a little child reading it. Very different style to me – far cuter! And I also found a couple of activities here that you could do related to the story."
