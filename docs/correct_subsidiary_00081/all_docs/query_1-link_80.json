As it often takes considerable detective work to determine the actual wealth of an individual, \"Forbes\"' figures are widely cited as nearly-definitive.\n\n*Executive Pay\n\n*Forbes 400, a list of the richest people in the United States\n\n*Midas List, an annual list of the top dealmakers in technology and life sciences\n\n*World's Richest People, a list of the richest people in the world\n\n*China Rich List, a list of the richest people in mainland China\n\n*India Rich List, list of the richest people in India\n\n*Forbes Fictional 15, a self-parodying list of the richest movie, TV and literary characters\n\n*The World's 100 Most Powerful Women\n\n*The Celebrity 100, an annual list of famous and financially influential celebrities (i.e., entertainers, musicians, producers, directors, and athletes)\n\n*The China Celebrity 100\n\n*Top-Earning Dead Celebrities, a list of deceased celebrities that continue their revenue from posthumous material\n\nPlaces\n\n* Best Cities For Singles\n\n* Best Places For Business (e.g. [http://www.forbes.com/lists/2008/6/biz_bizcountries08_Best-Countries-for-Business_Rank.html 2008] list).\n\n* Most Expensive Zip Codes\n\n* Most Expensive Rental Markets In The U.S.\n\nFidel Castro conflict\n\nIn 2005, \"Forbes\" listed Fidel Castro among the world's richest people, with an estimated net worth of $550 million USD.
