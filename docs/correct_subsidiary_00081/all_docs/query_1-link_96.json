        "text": "In the words of Dorothea Mackellar, I love a sunburnt country, but over the years I’ve also learned to respect it and even fear it. Like many Aussies of my vintage, I have vivid memories of childhood sunburn so severe it felt like my skin had shrunk, followed by rounds of calamine lotion and then the inevitable reptilian peeling of skin. It was a reflection of endless summer days in the pool and holidays on the beach, an Aussie rite of passage. Leap forward to the present day and, like so many others, I now have family members and friends who have had to have chunks of flesh removed as a result of skin cancer. I am paranoid about my daughter’s alabaster skin, a gift from her English father. She…\n\nRevisit a classic: The anniversary of The Wizard of Oz has me yearning to hit the yellow brick road again (page 58). Experiment in the kitchen: Who knew you could create a mouth-watering cheesecake in your slow cooker! Yes please (page 136). Master macramé: Well, maybe not master, but these cute feathers are a fun place to start (page 140). Go greener: It’s time ‘doing my bit for the planet’ worked its way back up my list of priorities (page 98).…\n\nLETTER of the MONTH An article I read has brought up memories of abuse that I have hidden for so many years (The Devil Inside, AWW, July). It broke my heart, for I know exactly what she was feeling and experiencing. Many females have experienced abuse and yet we hide it, because we think we are to blame for our partners’ moods.

Name and address withheld GRACEFUL MONARCH Thank you, Juliet Rieden, for the excellent article about our gracious Queen (Secrets of her Reign, AWW, July). While Her Majesty was “born into privilege”, she was given little choice for the demanding lifetime job she had to take on. The Queen is recognised for her unwavering adherence to…\n\nONE OF BRITAIN’s best-loved entertainers, Dame Vera Lynn will be remembered as the voice of hope. Born in 1917, Vera left school at 11 to pursue singing. By the time she was 22, she had sold more than a million records. During World War II, she entertained front-line troops in India and Egypt, where she earned the nickname “Forces’ Sweetheart”. She found fame again in 2009 as the UK’s oldest chart-topper, aged 92, when her Very Best Of album hit number one. Dame Vera Lynn died on June 18, aged 103.…\n\nWEDDING BELLS AT SUNRISE Congratulations to Sunrise co-host Sam Armytage, who showed off this stunning sparkler to announce her engagement to Richard Lavender. THIRTY CANDLES Happy 30th birthday to Margot Robbie. With two Oscar nominations already under her belt, we can’t wait to see what the next decade brings for the Aussie star. ENDURING LOVE Nicole Kidman marked her 14th wedding anniversary with Keith Urban by posting this beautiful photograph, simply captioned “Us”. In return, Keith posted, “I feel like your boyfriend in ALL the right ways!!!!”…\n\nDENMARK A new portrait of Queen Margrethe of Denmark has been unveiled for her 80th birthday and is on display at the Frederiksborg Museum of National History, as part of an exhibit to honour her life. Crown Prince Frederik and Crown Princess Mary also attended the unveiling. SWEDEN Swedish Crown Princess Victoria has celebrated 10 years of marriage with the release of anniversary photos showing her and husband Daniel, Duke of Västergötland. Princess Victoria, heir to the Swedish throne, married personal trainer Daniel in 2010 after the pair met and fell in love at the gym. MONACO The Monaco royals made their first public appearance as a family since lockdown began.
