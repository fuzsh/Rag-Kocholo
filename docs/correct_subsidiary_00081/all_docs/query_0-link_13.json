FOSSIL FUELS ARE BAD, AT LEAST IF YOU SUBSCRIBE TO THE global warming theory. What's the best way to suppress some- thing bad? The economist's answer to this question is to tax the fuel. The politician's answer is to give a boost to alternative fuels, via mandates and subsidies. So it is that the House's energy bill contains a mandate that (by 2020) electric compa- nies get 15% of their energy from renewable resources. The bill also extends and magnifies subsidies for alternative energy. Some version of this is likely to survive a reconciliation with the Senate's competing legislation. After decades on the fringes of the energy sector, solar is making enormous strides. As Elizabeth Corcoran and others detail in the cover story, the technology has almost gotten to the point where it makes economic sense. Look at the chart on page 82. In places where sunshine is bright and electric rates are stiff, solar cells could soon hold their own against fossil-powered generators. This conclusion seems to hang on some heroic assumptions about the mainte- nance costs for solar, its durabil- ity and its financing. But all it would take is another halving or two of the cost of photovoltaics for solar to be a real winner. What's wrong with a little federal boost in the meantime? Just that it's a very sloppy way to get carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere. Taxing carbon motivates people not just to look for alternatives but to conserve energy in the meantime. Subsidizing alternative energy, in contrast, is likely to have the perverse effect of causing them to crank up the air-conditioning in that mansion in Nashville. What you get is the same number of carbon-belching smokestacks as before, but now the countryside is also littered with windmills, ethanol plants and other eyesores. Economists, notably including N. Gregory Mankiw of Harvard, favor putting a tax on carbon. That means higher electric and gasoline bills for consumers, who are, ultimately, the real source of atmospheric pollution. Such taxes do not find favor with politicians like Nancy Pelosi. They would rather identify electric utilities and car companies as the culprits in global warming and declare that they are riding to the rescue with mandates for wind- mills and small cars. Congressmen are also happy to subsidize the solar cells on your roof so you can live in comfort below. Dumb economic thinking has been a feature of energy legis- lation at least since 1973. It seems to be a renewable resource. EDITOR 16 FORBES SEPTEMBER 3, 2007 We close a lease every 3 minutes in markets around the world and we still make sure every t is crossed.

My personal experience is that Michael Moore has got it right! My doctor told me that he was sending me home from the hospital sooner than he would have liked because my HMO would not pay for additional service. When I got home I opened my mailbox and found a letter denying my claim for surgery. I spent the entire night throwing up and sweating profusely. I wrote a letter to my HMO congratulating them for their perfect timing. I guess they thought I was going to sue them, because they sent a representative out and eventually paid the bill. No one should have to jump through that many hoops for medical service. ROBERT PORTER Ellisville, Mo. Blame the Doctor Your article \"Slicko\" (Aug. 13, p. 40) is of interest to me as a physician who has the temerity to believe he has a potentially definitive approach to high-quality, affordable health care. I naively started a software development company in 1990 that created an auditable, Web-based claims administration system. From our analyses of millions of claims we learned that 65% of primary care physicians (PCPs) are very cost-effective and provide top-quality care. The remaining 35% of PCPs practice lower-quality care and are vastly more costly. Thus, in a plan where the premium or the employer pays $250 per member per month, the efficient providers' actual medical expenses are $140, while their inefficient, lower-quality colleagues' medical expenses are $375. A pay- for-performance model of care would require PCPs to be more accountable. SOLOMON J. ZAK, M.D. Minneapolis, Minn. Competitive Health You got it right when you wrote that \"our third-party-based payment system\" makes health care in the U.S. enormously inefficient, unproductive, non-innovative and, of course, insanely expensive (\"Fact and Comment,\" Aug. 13, p. 21). To correct this situation, the starting point is to eliminate, or substantially diminish, employer-pro- vided insurance. Let individuals buy their own health insurance, just as they do automobiles, property, etc. Every- thing else — HSAs, tax treatment — is secondary. HEMANT D. KALE Manlius, N. Y.

ConocoPhillips Energy for tomorro* www. conocophillips . cor Fact and Comment By Steve Forbes, Editor-in-Chief \"With all thy getting get understanding.\" i J Fantasy Fears AL GORE WENT ON A RANT RECENTLY AGAINST THOSE WHO are dubious about his apocalyptic projections on global warm- ing. Doubters and disbelievers are simply stooges of big oil, par- ticularly ExxonMobil, he harrumphed. Newsweek, meanwhile, tastelessly labeled skeptics \"deniers,\" a not-so-subtle comparison to those sick individuals who deny the reality of the Holocaust. Most of the media parrot the Gore/Newsweek chants about global warming; its allegedly disastrous consequences are an absolute given. Scientists who arrive at opposing conclusions are ostracized and often denied grants. Universities won't hire them or, if they are already tenured, will make sure they don't get pro- moted. ExxonMobil is under intense pressure to recant. Literally thousands of scientists have expressed deep doubts about global warming, yet those doubts are deep- sixed by a gullible media. Future generations will look back in aston- ishment that so many supposedly educated people came to be caught up in this hysteria. Not all skeptics, however, are oil company executives. One such per- son who saw Gore's movie, An Incon- venient Truth, is Mary Ellen Gilder, a medical school student at Albany Medical College (and daughter of noted technologist and FORBES newsletter partner, George Gilder). Ms. Gilder decided to dissect the movie piece by piece. You can read her findings in her paper, \"Diagnosing Al Gore: Truth in the Balance,\" at oism.org/pproject. Gilder found Gore's documentary to be riddled with egregious distortions and falsehoods. She did the basic, balanced research that so many politicos and journal- ists have not. She accessed readily available scientific articles and papers from respected sources. Hers is the kind of citizen's jour- nalism that we will see more of in this Internet era. In his film Gore states, \"Now we're beginning to see the impact [of global warming] in the real world.\" Among the fright- ening examples the movie gives is Africa's rapidly shrinking Lake Chad, a once giant body of water that is now nearly dry. It turns out that Lake Chad is not very deep and has dried up many times in the past, the last being about 2,000 years ago. The current dry- ing has been abetted, Gilder points out, by \"a rapidly expanding population drawing water from the lake, the introduction of irri- gation technologies and local overgrazing.\" What about the shrinking of the snows on Mount Kiliman- jaro? According to Gilder, a 2004 article in the International Jour- nal of Climatology says that all three of the major East African Global warming mongers point to disappearing Lake Chad as proof of their fears, yet the lake has repeatedly dried up during the last 10,000 years. glaciers have seen significant retreat since the late 1800s, which is long before there was much CO: around. Moreover, the Kiliman- jaro glacier is melting in a way that suggests it is probably not caused by the supposedly C02-induced higher temperatures but by reduced precipitation. Gore paints a horrifying picture of how global warming may lead to ghasdy increases in infectious diseases because vectors are expanding their ranges. He listed 1 5 new or recently resurgent dis- eases. Four of these — Lyme, malaria, dengue fever and West Nile virus (all spread by insects) — undermine Gore's hysteria. \"Lyme disease — far from being a tropical disease spreading northward— originated in the temperate climate of Lyme, Conn., and spread mainly south and west. Malaria is a disease confined to the tropics more for socioeconomic reasons than climatological ones,\" once having been widespread in Siberia and Northern Europe. \"There is a similar lack of evidence for climate-associated spread of dengue fever.\" As for West Nile virus, the villainous mosquito here \"is the most widely distributed mosquito in the world, common on every continent but Antarctica.\" As Gilder concludes, \"there is no evidence that any of these diseases emerged or resurged due to global climate change.\" Gore's whoppers do not end here. He declares that extreme weather changes are causing ever greater economic losses, that is, more property damage and dis- ruptions to the economy. Alas for his alarmism, an item in the Bulletin of the American Meteorological Society found that \"a robust body of research shows very little evidence to support the claim that the rising costs associated with weather and climate events are associated with changes in the frequency or intensity of events themselves.\" Instead, the change in losses comes about because more and more people are living in vulnerable areas. Gore's movie has a visual that purportedly shows temperature changes over the last 650,000 years correlating closely with levels of carbon dioxide, suggesting that C02 must be the culprit. Dig a little deeper, though, and another picture emerges. It turns out there was a 400- to 1,000-year lag during \"all three glacial inter- glacial transitions on record.\" In other words, there is no real cor- relation. \"The ocean acts as an enormous organism that exhales carbon dioxide during warming periods of the Earth's history, and absorbs it during periods of cooling.\" Another inconvenient truth: The temperature rose in the early part of the 20th century, long before we had today's plethora of cars SEPTEMBER 3, 2007 FORBES 21 ADVERTISEMENT THE NEW DIRECTOR LIFE INSIDE THE FISHBOWL AN EXECUTIVE BRIEFING OF THE EXCLUSIVE BOARDROOM FORUM By Judith L.Turnock Forbes and FTI Consulting convened the first in a series of Boardroom Forums entitled The New Director: Life Inside the Fishbowl, at the Harmonie Club in New York City on June 28, 2007. Any director today knows that corporate scandals, Sarbanes-Oxley, increasingly demanding shareholders and the grow- ing impact of private equity investors are shifting new responsibilities and risks onto directors. In this changing environment, directors — and potential directors — need to rethink how they engage with the CEO and upper management to ensure the success of the company and shareholder-owner investment. What are the outlines of the new director role? The Forum moved toward answers. In the first part of the Forum, a one-on-one conversation with Bruce Upbin, Forbes assistant managing editor, William H. Donaldson joked about the old days, where meetings began with a pat on the back for the CEO and ended with a great lunch. \"That whole game has changed,\" declared Donaldson, and for the better. \"For anyone who's looking to make a contribution, and to have a real hand in helping to guide a company from a strategic point of view, it's a great time to be a director.\" He's in a position to know what he's talking about. As former chairman of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and the New York Stock Exchange, cofounder, former chairman and chief executive of Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette, director and/or executive of a number of major companies, and founding dean and professor at Yale's School of Management, Donaldson has viewed the director's job from every possible perspective. The Forum's second half featured a panel of experts: Joseph L. Bower, Donald Kirk David professor of business administration at Harvard Business School; Dennis J. Shaughnessy, chairman of FTI Consulting, Inc.; David W. Johnson, chairman emeritus of Campbell Soup Co. and director of Colgate-Palmolive; and Patrick S. McGurn, executive vice president and special counsel of Institutional Shareholder Services (ISS). Their joint premise was \"We've mov< from a CEO-centric governance model to a board-centric mode: but their different perspectives revealed many options for playing o the new vamped-up role. The hot topics that emerged from the discussion are not formulas, b rather ways to think about and analyze appropriate action going forwai GOING DEEPER THAN QUARTERLY EARNINGS Directors should focus first on longer-term planning, various pegged at three to seven years. Quarterly earnings — and whether or n they match the company's own projections — are how the market v; ues a stock, so Wall Street has been complicit in \"short-termism,\" whi< has hindered long-term company value, shareholder value and, ul mately, U.S. economic growth. The subcommittee Donaldson chairs the Committee for Economic Development released an in-depth stuc on the issue earlier this year, designed in part to stem privatization. Boards can facilitate the change in perspective by owning t longer-term strategy as a group and then articulating that strategy the market. Boards can also enlist CEO commitment by tying cor pensation to milestones in the strategy, even including a \"snatch-bac provision that follows a CEO for the first year or two after she or leaves a company. THE DELICATE ISSUE OF SUCCESSION PLANNINCl The second focus should be succession planning. Enough compan: have suffered disappointing returns after external CEO searches land big names with compensation requirements to match. Their general skills may or may not be relevant, and they do not share the interrl networks that can smooth transitions. Internal succession planning! an attractive antidote. Developing capable people eight to ten years out involves visitiil some of them at work, bringing them to board meetings for presel 1 \"Built to Last: Focusing Corporations on Long-Term Performance,\" Committee for Economic Development's Research and Policy Committee, Washington, DC. 20C ADVERTISEMENT TTH THE END OF THE ERA OF THE ALL-POWERFUL CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER AND LHE BEGINNING OF A NEW ERA OF SHAREHOLDER- OWNER ACTIVISM, ALL EYES ARE ON THE BOARDROOM. ^1 :ions followed by drinks and dinner, and getting them guidance )m different coaches. One of those candidates might be the right rson for the company at the time of succession. HE ART OF THE CEO -DIRECTOR RELATIONSHIP Because the shifting power center is not an easy transition for many EOs, striking the right balance between the director serving as e CEO's colleague and advisor and a monitor who asks difficult lestions is an art. When every company is \"as individual as a finger- int,\" there is no one best practice. The balance can only be found rough conversations over time, based on the confidence and expe- :nce of the CEO. ANAGING SHAREHOLDER DIVERSITY Directors are, first and foremost, the primary representatives of e owners, and today's owners want to talk directly to their elected presentatives. Forward-thinking boards are already facilitating ose conversations through interactive director Web pages, presen- tions at shareholder meetings, and meetings with buy-side and ll-side institutional investors. These interactions result in stronger dicies, strategies, positions and, ultimately, more-effective boards. Activist owners also raise new proxy access issues. Some owners ok for long-term growth and stability, but most hold shares for ;s than a year. What access is warranted for such different interests, id all the others in between? For example, who should have a say 1 compensation? U.S. experts want to give the relatively new SEC sclosure provisions more time to prompt voluntary change. N THE HORIZON The experts and participants also raised issues that warrant attention It have not ripened into recommended strategies. • Separating CEO and board chair positions. In the mutual fund industry, the inherent conflict of interest probably requires separating the two positions. For most companies, however, there are compromise positions, such as designating a lead director or holding separate meetings of independent directors. • Term or age limits. These limits are probably tactics to avoid the more difficult business of assessing individual director contributions. • More board diversity. Broadening the pool for directors opens the door to greater diversity and the independent thinking those new recruits bring. • Approaches from private equity investors. When interest rates are low, private equity investors will find many sympathetic CEO ears. Boards need a plan of action with the CEO's contractual obliga- tion to report any and all approaches. • Service on other boards and director pay. Now that board service has begun to resemble a full-time job, companies are already limiting service on other boards and increasing director pay to better reflect the actual time commitment. For those who relish the opportunity to shape the future, it's the right time to be a director. ■ The next Forum will be held in San Francisco on November 13, 2007.

Fart and Comment and airplanes; then it went down a bit, even as C02 emissions went up. Though up a tad since 1980, our current temperatures are hardly at record levels. What Gilder and others have discovered is that the subject of weather is an extraordinarily com- plex subject. \"The profound weakness of the cli- mate models on which so many policymakers hang their hats,\" she writes, \"is that they project our present conditions into the future.\" Yet look at the extraordinary changes in the world since 1900, a time when one of the biggest problems facing cities was their growing volume of horse plop. Only a handful of individuals could conceive that Grumpy Gore dislikes skeptics. the automobile would soon put most horse-based transportation out to pasture. Gilder quotes physician-writer Michael Crichton, who wrote a bestselling novel, State of Fear, based on the global warming hysteria: \"Nobody believes a weather prediction 12 hours ahead. Now we're being asked to believe a predic- tion that goes out 100 years into the future? And make financial investments based on that predic- tion? Has everybody lost their minds?\" Crichton's question is an apt one: All too many politicos, academics and journalists do seem to have taken leave of their senses. Will They Take Over the World? The Elephant and the Dragon: The Rise of India and China and What It Means for All of Us— by Robyn Meredith (WW. Norton & Co., $25.95). The book to read on the extraordinary economic expansions of India and China, the two most populous nations on Earth. FORBES Senior Editor Robyn Meredith has produced a well-written and well-researched work chronicling and analyz- ing the most profound, tectonic shift in economics since the rise of the U.S. Even Japan's fabled and stunning economic surge from the rubble of World War II doesn't compare with what's unfold- ing in these once poor and stagnant nations, with their collective populations of more than 2.4 billion people. r Meredith wonderfully combines acute macro observations with micro tales of individual entre- preneurs and companies. She also does a superb job describing the complex, multination supply chains that have been created. Countries rarely make things from start to finish anymore. Instead, \"inputs\" are created seemingly everywhere and then brought together for assembly. Since much of this final assembly takes place in China, our trade deficit with that country looks far bigger than it really is — most of the dollars that go to China end up elsewhere. Meredith portrays the awesome changes in China's coastal cities, while painting a nitty-gritty picture of the living conditions of the many workers pouring into China's burgeoning urban areas. She succinctly discusses the enormous challenges posed to the country's rulers by the hundreds of millions of rural residents who are rapidly falling behind their urban cousins, a disparity made even more painful by the fact that it was the farmers who had initially benefited most from the country's push to modern- ize. The book also candidly analyzes the vast problems Chinas breakneck growth has brought with it— a banking system loaded with hundreds of billions of dollars of worthless loans; wide- spread corruption, particularly severe outside of Chinas cities; and pollution. Chinas rise began in 1978, when Deng Xiaoping decisively ended the Maoist era of murderous repressions and the ghastly crackpot economic policies that had killed tens of millions of people and impoverished nearly everyone else. Meredith tells the j«f ELEPHANT little-known story of Deng's visit to Singapore, Malaysia and Thailand not long after he'd taken the reins of government. He beheld booming, modern metropolises — a day-and-night con- trast with China's. Stunned, Deng decided then and there to consign China's traditional communism to the ash heap of history. During the 1980s India made fitful moves to open its over- regulated, isolated and bureaucratically stultified economy. In the wake of an economic crisis in 1991 the government enacted dras- tic reforms. While China focused on manufacturing, India turned to software and the white-collar work done in back offices around the world. Beijing pours tens of billions of dollars into infrastructure, well before it is actually needed, in a sort of economic version of Field of Dreams: Build it and, eventually, they will come. In India, however, infrastructure remains remarkably backward, with terrible roads, rickety railways and Third World air- ports. China has virtually eliminated illiteracy, while about 40% of India's population remains illiterate. India's leaders say they are determined to make progress on infrastructure; the growing middle class will certainly apply pressure to make that come to pass. The rapid growth of both countries has drawn countless companies in the U.S. and elsewhere to outsource activities and jobs to each. Meredith puts outsourcing in perspective. By 2015, for instance, the U.S. may have lost as many as 3 million jobs to outsourcing — about 2% of the workforce. Yet our economy will still be creating more than 1 million new jobs a year. In other words, U.S. employment will continue to expand, even as China and India move rapidly forward. Job outsourcing helps Ameri- can equity values go up, thereby creating investment capital here and better pensions for our retirees, not to mention better prices for countless goods, which benefits tens of millions of American consumers. Meredith also brings the same sober cost-benefit analysis to trade and the current ballyhoo over the value of China's currency vis-a-vis the dollar. The rapid rise of India and China will mean overall gains for the U.S., especially if we remove the educational and economic barriers that keep us from maximizing our economic opportunities.

But we are not enacting expensive legislation to erect retractable meteorite shields around major U.S. cities, or pouring money into the development of meteorite-proof material.

Iran has enough natural gas to meet its clean electrical generation needs for two centuries. The only rationale for its multibillion-dollar program of building nuclear reactors — and for its spending billions more to hide and decentralize them — is to obtain weapons. Iran presents a uniquely fourfold danger: It has enough cash to buy influence and exemption from sanctions; it possesses oil reserves to blackmail a petroleum-hungry world; it sponsors terrorists who might soon be enabled to find sanctuary under a nuclear umbrella and to be armed with dirty bombs; and it has a leader who talks as if he were willing to take his entire country into paradise — or at least back to the 7th century amid the ashes of the Middle East. Just imag- ine the recent controversy over Danish cartoons in the context of [Iran's President Mahmoud] Ahmadinejad with his finger on a half-dozen nuclear missiles pointed at Copenhagen. —VICTOR DAVIS HANSON, Hoover Institution, Imprimis Unruly Behavior Years of unbudgeted regulatory growth merit concern. But [federal] agencies are not the real cul- prits. Congress regularly shirks its constitutional duty to make the tough calls. It delegates considerable lawmaking power to agencies, and then it fails to ensure that they deliver benefits that are greater than costs. [Consider:] • Regulatory costs hit $1,142 trillion in 2006. The hidden tax of reg- ulation now approaches half the level of federal spending itself. • Regulatory costs are more than quadruple the $248 billion budget deficit [and] exceed 2004 corporate pretax profits of $1,059 trillion. • Regulatory costs exceed the estimated 2006 individual income taxes of $998 billion [and] dwarf corporate income taxes of $277 billion. • Regulatory costs absorb 9% of U.S. GDP. • While agencies issued 3,718 final rules, Congress passed and the President signed into law a comparatively low 321 bills in 2006. —CLYDE WAYNE CREWS JR., Competitive Enterprise Institute Eastern Exposure American politicians often complain that China's currency is undervalued, making its exports cheaper than they should be. That may be so, but the cheap currency's big winners are American companies exporting inexpensive goods and American consumers paying less for them than they otherwise would. Chinas world-beating exports are indeed thriving, but more than half of China's exports, 56% in 2003, are produced by foreign - owned companies. Add in domestic Chinese companies under con- tract to export and nearly 70% of all Chinese exports are made by or for foreign companies, leaving China's most profitable business activities out of the hands of mainland Chinese. China, it seems, has not been invited to its own coming-out party. Whereas the global part of the Chinese economy — the part controlled by U.S. and other foreign companies — is flourishing, the Chinese-controlled portion has an uncertain future. China must transform itself further if it is to reap the full rewards of its own economic rise. More than half of Chinas incredible 10% GDP growth comes from government and foreign direct investment. If you strip that away, China's growth rate is closer to the American growth rate. — ROBYN MEREDITH, The Elephant and the Dragon: The Rise of India and China and What it Means for All of Us Bureaucratic Bungle Pedro Guzman is an Ameri- can citizen.

GENERAL LIABILITY PROPERTY COMMERCIAL AUTO WORKERS COMfl Current Events By Paul Johnson No Shortage of Good Samaritans ONE OF THE NEW TESTAMENT'S KEY TEXTS IS ABOUT THE GOOD Samaritan, and its lessons can be applied to business and business- men. In telling this tale Jesus had two objectives. The first was to condemn sectarianism. At the time, Jews were taught to regard Samaritans as heretics and enemies, but Jesus showed the Samar- itan behaving better than the Jewish priest and the learned and pious Levite. The second and more important objective was to stress the importance of charity. Here was an innocent \\dctim of thieves, robbed and left half dead by the roadside. The priest and Levite \"passed by on the other side.\" But the Samaritan stopped, \"bound up his wounds,\" put the injured man on his donkey and took him to an inn. There the Samaritan paid for the care of the poor man and told the owner of the inn to look after him until he was better and \"whatsoever thou spendest more, when I come again, I will repay thee.\" Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher quoted this text often while in office. She thought it a first-class example of practical compassion in action. The Samaritan was a businessman — a merchant, a com- mercial traveler — who regularly traveled a certain route and knew the inns and their owners along the way. When he found the man in dis- tress, he acted immediately He didn't go around making speeches, setting up a fund and using the cliches of the aid industry. He simply tended to the man, pulled out his purse and left him in good hands, personally financing any other assistance that might prove necessary. Mrs. Thatcher cited this as the best way to help an unfortunate neigh- bor— direct, person to person, with no bureaucracy, no elaborate rules. But there was another point to which Mrs. Thatcher always drew attention— the reason the Samaritan was able to render such aid. He was a man of substance, a successful businessman who plied his trade industriously, lived within his income and was therefore able to provide money without hesitation when it was needed. There is, she added, a lot to be said for a society that allows people to accumulate wealth so they are able to spend it charitably. All very well, you may say, but what about the other biblical text in which Jesus says: \"It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle, than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God\"? This harsh analogy \"amazed\" the disciples and led them to ask: \"Who then can be saved?\" The answer concerns not the accumu- lation of wealth but its disposition. It serves as a warning to the per- son still encumbered by his riches when he seeks entry to heaven. Andrew Carnegie, one of the greatest of American entrepreneurs, took this particular text to heart and lived by it. He was a child im- migrant, the son of a penniless Scots hand-loom weaver. Carnegie made one of the greatest fortunes in history by discovering how to produce high-quality steel cheaply— thus enormously benefiting society, as well as himself. But as he grew richer, Carnegie reflected deeply on the morality of becoming and remaining rich. He set out his conclusions in a remarkable essay that came to be known as \"The Gospel of Wealth\" and was published in the North American Review in June 1889. In it Carnegie argued that the honest accumulation of wealth was morally permissible, especially if in the process the interests of the public were served. What was wrong was to hang on to the wealth. He concluded: \"[The] man who dies rich dies disgraced.\" By the time Carnegie died in his sleep at age 83, he had given away almost all that he possessed. The canny old Scots-American had acquired his money in a businesslike fashion. And it's clear he gave it away in the same manner — and while he was still around to supervise the process (an important point). A Better Way More has been given in the last half-century than in all the previous ages put together. But most of it has been through transactions be- tween governments. Immense sums have simply been transferred from one public treasury to another, with all the decisions regarding the funds — on the part of both donor and recipient — made by politicians and civil servants. The whole process takes place within a context of politics, not business, and correspondingly has been inefficient and wasteful. The big international aid organizations, though less politi- cized and therefore more effective, are still bedeviled by bureaucracy What is common to both kinds of donor, whether they're gov- ernment-financed through taxes or big charities that raise their income worldwide, is that none of those making the decisions are spending their own money. It is a fundamental fact of human nature that someone who opens his own purse to give to those in need is likely to take a close interest in the ways in which and how effectively the money is spent. As a result, it is more likely to be spent wisely Many of the vast government aid schemes have done more harm than good, and despite all the money spent there is as much poverty and distress today as there ever has been. However, there is one consoling factor: More money is being made by the efforts of in- dividuals than ever before. And in the U.S., where the number of such private fortunes is greatest, the culture of personal charity is stronger than ever. The parable of the Good Samaritan is remembered and heeded The example of Andrew Carnegie is understood and followed. We should rejoice that we have a system that allows men and women to accumulate riches — one that produces so many who voluntarily use the fruits of their industry and acumen to benefit the unfortunate. They do not, in their thousands — indeed, in their millions — \"pass by on the other side.\" F Forbes Paul Johnson, eminent British historian and author; Lee Kuan Yew, minister mentor of Singapore; Ernesto Zedillo, director, Yale Center for the Study of Globalization, former president of Mexico; and David Malpass, chief economist, Bear Stearns & Co., rotate in writing this column.

It always does. A new and very slick adaptation to pricey oil is a jet airplane built with only one engine. Three manufacturers — Piper Aircraft of Vero Beach, Fla., Cirrus Design of Duluth, Minn, and Dia- mond Aircraft Industries of Wiener Neustadt, Austria — have a single-engine jet in the works. A fourth, Eclipse Aviation of Albu- querque, N.M., is toying with a single-engine version of its tiny Eclipse 500 twin-engine jet. In July Eclipse flew its skunkworks one-holer, the ECJ, into the big air show at Oshkosh, Wis. Single-engine jets are not new. Air Force fighter jets of the 1950s, such as the F-86 Sabre, had one monster engine embedded in the fuselage. The F-86 ... _ . „.. . ^„ .. ... 5 Cirrus Design s the-jet (left) will flew 685mph and enjoyed a fly over 340mph on one engine. 10: 1 kill ratio over the MiG- Eclipse Aviation's ECJ is faster but 15 during the Korean War. smaller. But the F-86's engine-flame- out rate was unacceptably high for commercial use. Safely through redun- dancy has always driven com- mercial jet aircraft. The Boe- ing 707 entered commercial service in 1 958 and used four engines to carry 141 passengers. The Boe- ing 727 followed in 1964, on a risky bet that only three engines were needed The trend toward fewer engines continued with the 757 twin in the 1980s and, most radically, the jumbo 777 in 1995. Because the 777 was designed to carry more than 300 passengers over large oceans on just two engines, it was the most rigorously tested jet airplane ever. Business jets, being much smaller, have used two engines from the beginning. The four-passenger Paris Jet debuted in 1954 but was considered more toy than tooL The first biz jet to sell in volume was Bill Lear's Learjet, first available in 1964. And todays small, cut- ting-edge Eclipse 500 and Cessna Mustang, as well as the forthcom- ing Embraer Phenom 100 and Honda Jet, are twin-engine designs. Fuel Economy Propels Change ITie single-engine jet is a departure from the old idea that redun- dancy equals safety. Will the market accept singles? I think so. Fuel prices will dictate a demand for greater economy. Modern manu- facturing processes combined with electronic fuel control and engine diagnostics make a single-engine jet much safer than earlier models. Todays jet engines almost never fail. Will the paying pub- lic see it that way? Would you fly in a small jet with one engine? Without hesitation (and assuming pilot competency) I would [ own a single-engine piston airplane, a Cirrus SR22, and both this summer and last I flew my wife and kids over the Rocky Moun- tains in our Cirrus. The Cirrus piston engine, made by Teledyne Continental, is very reliable. Yet in comparison, jet engines — hav- ing fewer moving parts — are ten times more reliable than pistons. You may not know this, but the market has already accepted single-engine jet aircraft. The Cessna Caravan, Pilatus PC- 12 and EADS Socata TBM 700/850 are big hits in the marketplace and profitmaking machines for their manufacturers. You may not think of these aircraft as jets, since they have a single propeller hanging off their noses. They are turboprops. Their engines are jet turbines that use the jets thrust to spin a prop. The Cessna Caravan has been flying since 1985 and is a workhorse for FedEx in smaller cities. The Swiss-made Pilatus PC- 12 specializes as an executive, commuter and f ambulance aircraft. The I (f smaller TBM 850 seats six, goes 370mph and flies a 1,570-mile range on one engine. All three single turboprops have superb safety records, a sure sign that single-engine jet air- craft can be successful. Which of the new single-engine jets will prevail? Eclipse wants to be the Porsche of single-engine jets. Its single will fly higher (41,000 feet) and faster (395mph) than its rivals'. But it will seat only four — two up front, including the pilot, and two in back Cir- rus and Diamond are trying to be the luxury SUVs of these jets. They will fly lower (25,000 feet) and slower (340mph to 360mph) but easily seat five to six people, in various configurations. The Cirrus single has huge windows for passenger comfort and an air- frame parachute, in the unlikely event that the aircraft's Williams FJ33 engine flames out The Eclipse, Cirrus and Diamond jets will cost in the $1 mil- lion range. They will have lower operating costs compared with jets of similar size. Piper's single-engine jet is much larger, more like a Cessna CJ1+. It seats six adults comfortably and includes a potty. It will sell for about $2.4 million when it hits the market in 2010. Aviation is a conservative, slow-moving industry. Bearing this in mind, the sudden interest in single-engine jets is an extraordinary development. It says volumes about the adaptive abilities of free markets to high oil prices. It says volumes more about human innovation. To heck with $75 oil. It's a great time to be alive and free!

SEPTEMBER 3, 2007 FORBES 33 Informer INFORMER@FORBES.COM Shell Game ON ITS WEB HOME PAGE THE COALITION TO SALUTE AMERICA'S Heroes Foundation declares its mission is \"to help our severely wounded and disabled\" soldiers from Middle East strife \"rebuild their lives.\" There are images of vets missing limbs. The Web site mentions an endorsement from New York Times columnist Thomas L. Friedman. Your money won't be wasted if you sent it to this charity, at least if you take its financial statements at face value. A draft that FORBES obtained of the Coalition's latest annual financial statement (for calendar year 2006) claims an appealingly high 97 cents of every donated dollar was left after paying fundraising costs, an efficiency that would put the organ- ization right up there with Goodwill Industries International and the Salvation Army. Look more closely at the Coalition, and several sister nonprofits founded by philanthropic entrepreneur Roger Chapin, and you find only a limited amount of assistance for injured veterans. The charities seem to do a much better job of keeping Chapin comfortable than helping amputees. And that 97% fundraising efficiency is, to put it politely, misleading. We first delved into Chapin's collection of nonprofits in an article published last year (FORBES, Dec. 11). Since then more details of Chapin's finances have fallen into our i hands. They don't paint a pretty picture. The draft 2006 financial statement (it hasn't been finalized or released) disclosed that just $1 million of the $26 million spent last year by the Coalition was direct cash aid to injured vets, with maybe $5 million more spent on things like job-hunting seminars and public awareness. Nearly all the other $20 million spent represented the purported value of 1.5 million calling cards given to uninjured soldiers serving in the Middle East. These cards allowed the soldiers to check sports scores back home but couldn't be used to call, say, family. The cards were donated by EZ Scores, of Silver Spring, Md As for high efficiencies: They turn out to be illusory, a function of the fact that Chapin controls multiple nonprofits. The Coalition is based in Ossining, N.Y. Then there is Help Hospitalized Veterans in Winchester, Calif., with $71 million of revenue last year. Its stated mission is giving craft kits to wounded soldiers, but only 9% of its expenditures went directly to that purpose; half was eaten up in direct-mail costs, some not classified as fundraising. A third Chapin outfit is Help Wounded Heroes, an advocacy group in Washington, D.C. A fourth entity, Salute America's Heroes, is just a name used by Help Hospitalized Veterans when it sends out mail to benefit the Coalition. The various causes are intertwined in their fundraising efforts, with money solicited by one sometimes deposited into the bank account of another. Chapin says there's nothing amiss here: He was merely transitioning donors from the older Help Hospitalized Veterans to the newer Coalition. Whatever the moniker on the envelope, the appeals to the public to chip in for soldiers take place on a grand scale — by one count, 37 million envelopes since 2004 sent out by HHV under the Salute Americas Heroes banner for the Coalition. The campaign was orchestrated by firms associated with political operative and longtime Chapin buddy Richard Viguerie. In 2006 HHV ran up $7 million in costs sending 1 1 million pieces of Salute America's Heroes junk mail. HHV funneled $4 million of net proceeds from the mail campaign to the Coalition. Meanwhile, those sports cards did double duty in fattening the top lines of Chapin's charities (and thus making the overhead costs look less outrageous). The cards were counted as a donation to HHV, then sent to the Coalition and counted as a donation there, too. Credit that cards donation just once, to HHV, move the full junk mail revenue and costs to the Coalition, and the Coalition's fundraising effi- ciency will have dropped from 97% to a decidedly unappealing 50%. (above lefty Beside Viguerie, who feeds off the Coalition's last cash contributions? Chapin got annual report $426,000 in total compensation from coven for sale. HHV last year. He doesn't draw a salary from the Coalition, but earlier this year he was paid $360,000 for what he called his unreimbursed expenses dating back to the Coalition's 2004 founding. Submitted paperwork viewed by FORBES included thousands of dollars for airplane tickets for his wife, Elizabeth — last year a $1 14,000-a-year employee of HHV but never of the Coalition — gasoline and meals around their San Diego home, and accident repairs to a vehicle not owned by the Coalition. Chapin says the Coalition's board okayed his wife's travel and that the meals might have been for entertainment. He says he can't explain the car costs. The Chapins got another fringe benefit: housing. In mid- 2006 HHV quietly spent $445,000 — barely mentioned in public charity filings — to buy a condo near Washington, D.C. suburb Falls Church, Va. HHV minutes say it would be used \"primarily\" by Chapin during trips to D.C. to \"pursue\" HHV's mission. Online directories list three phone numbers at the pad. They are all in the name of Elizabeth Chapin. —William P. Barrett 34 FORBES SEPTEMBER 3, 2007 Lenegildo Ze£na 5 Til IN l# Al IKE On My Mind By Patricia J. Williams, professor, Columbia Law School Private Parts Are young people too eager to give up their civil liberties? NOT LONG AGO I FOUND MYSELF SIT- ting around the jury pool with a group of fellow New Yorkers. It was an odd little gaggle — odder still because I was about the only one over 30. This being the Big Apple, we were all registered Democrats, all self-described \"lefties,\" and yet, I felt a strange generation gap when it came to the matter of civil liber- ties, particularly those having to do with privacy and unreasonable searches and seizures. I wasn't entirely prepared for this. After all, a recent poll, conducted by the New York Times, CBS and MTV, purports to show that liberal ideas are gaining among young people. The poll asked questions about the economy, education, the war in Iraq and health insurance. But it didn't ask about the kinds of freedoms embodied in the Bill of Rights. My jury experience, while admittedly anecdotal, confirmed a growing sense I've gotten from a career on college campuses: that young people seem less worried about the deeper implications of the First Amendment right of the citizenry to express dissent about the actions of government than they are about the free speech rights of drunken fraternity brothers to shout epithets. They seem a great deal more invested in Ann Coulter's claims that she is being \"censored\" than the possibility that intelli- gence agencies are snooping on their computer files and Face- book accounts. I shouldn't be surprised, I suppose. As I was informed by my young juror friends, this is a generation shaped by school massacres and the World Trade Center attack \"New citizens should remain under surveillance for several years after they receive citi- zenship,\" insisted one of the jurors. \"People have no right to argue against an important law like the USA Patriot Act,\" commented an- other. \"Art should not be used for political messages,\" declared a third. These young adults came of age in a culture of unannounced locker searches, of undercover police officers posing as students in their classrooms, of metal detectors at the schoolhouse door, of routine bag searches and requirements like see-through backpacks. This is a generation shaped by school massacres and the Fear has shaped much of their civic sensibility. They espoused propositions that struck my lawyerly ear as quite extreme: They argued that defendants must \"understand\" the beneficence of overzealous or altogether unsubstanti- ated prosecutions. \"The police know more than we do,\" they repeated with alarming confidence. According to a Pew Research Center poll, 59% of those over 40 but only 49% of those between 18 and 25 believe the govern- ment exercises too much control over daily life. Popular culture doesn't help. Young adults have watched more television than any previous humans, leaving lit- tle time to read. Indeed, lawyers have begun to study what's called the \"CSi effect\": the tendency of juries to expect, even insist upon, forensic evi- dence like DNA or blood analyses, rather than witness testimony, before making up their minds. Similarly, torture is a more debatable proposition. The im- pact of one program, 24, has been so disturbing that recently the dean of the U.S. Military Acad- emy at West Point traveled to Hollywood to meet with produc- ers at the Fox network to chide them for depicting illegal activity: \"The kids see it and say, 'If torture is wrong, what about 24V They should do a show where torture backfires.\" Another radical social shift of the last decade can be found in a quick browse through MySpace, Facebook and YouTube, where there is a cyberspace riot of free expression's newest legatees documenting themselves in what I would view as pri- vate, compromised or just plain corrupted positions. And with phone numbers, no less! I marvel at how much individ- ual privacy these up-and-coming citizens are willing to forgo, while hardly blinking at unparalleled levels of government secrecy. And I do wonder if this is just carelessness about personal boundaries or a perfect mirror of the firmly incul- cated surveillances by which their entire lives have been constrained.

Outfront MARKETS Get Off the Ledge Unless you're in a highly leveraged hedge fund or running an investment bank, you have no reason to despair the turmoil on Wall Street. By Neil Weinberg MORTGAGE LENDERS ARE dropping like flies. Hedge funds are blowing up. Central banks are inject- ing money into financial markets to prevent a meltdown. Little won- der that many investors are fighting the urge to panic. Take a deep breath instead. No ques- tion, the mortgage market is in for a rough ride. Defaults are already spreading from the subprime sector to the broader market. And one index that tracks the likelihood of future defaults indicates things are going to get a lot worse as lenders squeeze and housing prices fall. But look beyond the narrow mortgage market, and the gunslingers who leveraged up to buy junky paper, and things don't look so bad. Think the construction indus- try is crumbling? While June housing starts tumbled 19% from a year earlier, nonresi- dential construction grew at a 14% annual clip. Overall, private construction spending is likely to fall slightly for the year as the industry loses about 150,000 jobs. That is 0.1% of U.S. nonfarm employment. \"There's a lot more of a cushion in the construction employment market than most people realize,\" says Kenneth Simonson, chief economist for the trade group Associated General Contractors of America. It might even be time for the intrepid, and the patient, to consider buying — downtrodden home builders and investment banks, for example. Taking the plunge means ignoring the headlines and focusing instead on, say, the tech-stock crash seven years ago. Calling the bottom was a fool's mission.

At a time when home builders are trading at the lowest price-to-book ratios in years, long- term housing demographics are great. Im- migration is running near record levels. Americans are getting ever wealthier. The baby boom is entering its peak second-home- buying years. And hundreds of thousands of postwar houses need to be replaced. Add it up, and the demand for new houses over the next decade is likely to run considerably ahead of where it did in the past one. Nor is the stock market overvalued to anything like the extent it was during the tech bubble. The S&P 500s price/earnings ratio is a fraction of its 200 1 peak value. Junk bond prices are still a bit rich — that is to say, yields on the bonds are still low relative to Treasury yields. But the yield premiums are fatter than they were two months ago. Its more likely at this point that junk bond prices will ease down than that they will go into a tailspin. Is a recession under way or even imminent? You wouldn't know that from the 4.6% unemployment rate (average over the past decade: 4.9%) or from the record revenues being reported by art auction houses. Somebody's finding the money to buy expensive cars, too. If investors have reason to worry, it is because they don't know if, and how, troubles in the U.S. mortgage market might trigger far greater problems through the magic of derivatives and transnational money flows. Then again, whenever the stock market climbs, it's up a wall of worry. F Additional reporting by Susan Kitchens. GURUS So Long, Warren Mutual funds that have been longtime Berkshire Hathaway investors are decamping. By Richard Phalon WARREN BUFFETT DRAWS AS many gee-whiz headlines as ever these days. But the Berkshire Hathaway mystique may be wearing thin among longtime devotees who know the company best — several solid mutual funds that have held its stock for ages. One is the sterling Sequoia Fund, bound in a tight relationship with Buffett for four decades. Since the start of 2005 Sequoia has unloaded $650 million of Berkshire shares, shrinking their weight in Sequoia's portfolio from 35% to 26%. Wallace Weitz shares a hometown with Buffett and runs Weitz Value and Weitz Partners Value funds. He has had a long-standing appetite for the Wizard of Omaha's stock, which had been making up 7.6% of his two funds. Weitz lightened up on the stock last fall. The reduction in the holding, to 7.4% of assets for Value and 7.2% for Partners Value, is small, yet it's equivalent to a devout Muslim deciding to skip some of the required daily prayers. Weitz says he still loves Berk- Sequoia Fund pared its Berkshire stake, citing Warren Buffett's shire but trimmed it to buy other holdings. Another Buffett acolyte, Christopher Davis and his Davis Advisors, has exited from Berkshire entirely in Davis Financial Fund. It recently reported selling $49 million worth of Berkshire A shares for a $20 million profit Three other Davis- run funds have thus far maintained their levels of Berkshire stock. Sequoia did not get around to alerting its investors until earlier this year that it has been easing out of Berkshire lately. The stated reasons for reducing its Berkshire load were its desire for better diversification and Buffett's age. Buffett, 77 on Aug. 30, has assured share- holders that a change in management (he has not publicly named a succes- sor yet) and a possible shift in control to the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation (he's donat- ing most of his shares to it) will have no impact on Berkshire's fortunes. The extraordinary rise in Berkshire's share price during Buffett's tenure (2,533-fold so far) is not necessarily over, yet it seems to be tapering off. Over the past five years the share price growth has lagged age. behind the S&P 500s.

Ready to Buy a Chinese Car? Chrysler, with a new owner and a new boss, is placing a big bet on a fledgling Chinese automaker | By Joann Muller THE CHERY Al IS A CUTE LITTLE car. It's a four-door hatchback, with a 1.3-liter engine, dual air bags and antilock brakes. The two-tone interior, with air-conditioning, power windows and a CD player, is surprisingly appealing for a car that sells for just over $7,000 in China. It may not quite live up to American standards. The engine needs refinement, and some parts don't fit as well as they should — not to mention concerns about the safety of anything made in China these days. But it's just the type of low- cost small car Chrysler needs if it hopes to grow both here and overseas. Divorced in August from Germany's DaimlerChrysler, it has a new owner, Cerberus Capital Management, and a new chief executive, former Home Depot boss Robert L. Nardelli. The automaker's future hinges less on a change in ownership than on a change in strategy. Right now Chrysler is a regional player, with all but 8% of its $62 billion in sales coming from North America, compared with General Motors, which gets half its sales from overseas. And Chrysler is overly dependent on gas- guzzling trucks: 68% of its U.S. sales are pickups, minivans and SUVs, compared with 60% at GM. Yet Chrysler, which lost $2 billion in the first quarter, can't afford the $1 billion or more it would take to develop a new generation of minicars. Nor does it have the small, efficient engines it would need to power them. Chrysler's smallest offering now is the Illinois-built Dodge Caliber. Considered a subcompact in the U.S., it is still too long (174 inches) and wide (69 inches) for many foreign markets. Chrysler's small-car solution, instead, lies with Chery Automobile, a Chinese carmaker with bold ambitions of its own. Chery has been building cars for just eight years but is already China's fourth- largest auto manufacturer, with sales of 300,000 vehicles in 50 countries last year, and plans to sell 1 million cars a year by 2010. Enticed by that growth, Chrysler President Thomas LaSorda — the architect of Chrysler's turnaround strategy before the arrival of Cerberus and Nardelli- signed a deal with the fledgling company in July. Starting next year Chery will build up to 100,000 vehicles, similar to the Al, that will be sold under the Dodge brand in emerging markets. By 2009 Chrysler and Chery plan to co-develop another small car, perhaps the Dodge Hornet, which would be good enough for the 44 FORBES SEPTEMBER 3, 2007 Who helps generate power today to build a better tomorrow?

The Hornet would be the first Chinese-made car sold by a big automaker in the U.S. \"It allows us some speed to market and to position Chrysler where we might have a product void,\" Nardelli said on Aug. 6, his first day on the job. This may not be the best time to be talking about importing anything from China, given the recent safety problems of toys, dog food and toothpaste. Indeed, a Chery sedan failed badly in a recent independent crash test in Russia. That car won't be sold in the U.S., but the test didn't help Chery's reputation. Chrysler says it will work closely with Chery to make sure the cars it sells meet all safety and emissions laws. \"If we put our brand on stuff, sometimes you only get one chance,\" LaSorda admits. \"And if it's not right"
