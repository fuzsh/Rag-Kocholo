The results of the excivation of Gezer carried on during the lust quarter are of considerable interest. No sensational discovery, it is true, has been made, but a great mass of evidence is being steadily accmnulated, thus checking or modifying the provisional con- clusions of previous quarters. At Ta'anach a couple of cuneiform tablets have been unearthed, and the writer of one of these was possibly the prince of Gezer mentioned in the Amarna Tablets ■(p. 98 below). We have yet to discover the tablets which must have been sent to Gezer, and the Committee are anxioiis to make evei'y efJbrt to enable Mr. Macalister to make a thorough examination of the tell. The special donations to the excavation comprise a legacy of £50 19s. Id. from the late Rev. Hon. E, T. C. Mathieson ; George Mathieson, Esq., £10; Rev. H. E, Dixon, £5; and S. Vaughan Morgan, Esq., £5. A great amount of labour has been spent in clearing the large pool to the south of the rock-cut high place, and the evidence now appears to show that this construction, which must have served as a reservoir for the town, dates from the Maccabean period. Among the objects found in the course of clearing it may be mentioned a Hebrew jar handle with the stamp \" Memshath \" ; it is the only object which — following the generally accepted theory of the age of these stamps — is pre-Maccabean. This, therefore, is a find of some value for the determining of their date. Among other interesting objects should be noticed the flint arrowhead with barbs, the curious drain-pipe made up of fragments of jars, the Astarte plaque (p. 15), the first example of an adult human sacrifice (a woman who appears to have been a martyr to rheuma- tism), and the remarkable imitation of a human head especially noteworthy for its prognathism.

JNJacalister will avail himself of a cordial iinitatiyii JviiifUy ejctended to him by Professor Flinders Petrie, et/Kr.-ivill*. prpcetcj tp Cairo, with a a iew of not only studying the carefiUl^'-arranged ol)jects in the museum there, but also of spending a week or two at the excavations now being conducted by Professor Petrie at Sakkara. This visit will not only afford Mr. Macalister some rest and change at a season when the Egyptian climate is at its best, but Avill enable him to make most careful comparison of the characteristics of the numerous Egyptian objects found by himself at Gezer with the carefully assorted and dated collection in the Cairo Museum. Inasmuch as the progress of the Gezer excava- tions has more and more confirmed the continued connection of that site with Egypt, Mr. Macalister's visit seems particularly opportune. The St. Louis ExJiibition. — The general arrangement of the Exhibition at St. Louis is now in an advanced stage. The British Commissioner, Colonel Watson, R.E., is a member of our own Executive Committee, and therefore familiar with all the work, some of the results of which we shall exhibit. The Fvmd has, for many years, received much valuable help from America, both by the subscriptions of members and by the contributions of valued information and suggestions by American scholars. The Committee therefore propose to send as complete an illustration of what the Fund has achieved, and is still achieving, as is compatible with such moderate outlay as they think to be justified — a complete set of the maps, from the original 1-inch survey to the last photo relief map ; the large and small Raised Maps ; all the publications of the Fund, including the \" Palestine Pilgrims' Text,\" ten volumes ; also careful casts of the \" Hittite Inscriptions \" and the \" Siloam Aqueduct Inscription,\" and a Plan of Jerusalem, with the latest discoveries marked thereon. A special feature of the collection will be the illustration of the work now in progress at Gezer. This will consist of a large-scale plan (10 feet by 7 feet) of the site being excavated, ■with the remains of the various epochs distinguished by different tints ; a selection of casts of the objects found ; and a splendid series of large photographs (24 inches by 17 inches) showing the actiud work going on. It is only on seeing these last that the stranger can have any idea of the vast size and extent of the operations which Dr. Macalister is so ably directing. NOTKS AND NEWS. 3 The Kxei:utive Conmiittoe h;ivo juldiessc*! ;i circiil;ir letter to the several societies of ditterent nationalities, calling attention to the great mischief now being wi'uught in Palestine by the illicit opening and rilling of tombs, all over the countr}^ by the native villagers. This practice, which has been (levelo|)ed by the demand for anti<|uities, and the great increase in the number of tourists, is causing the rapid obliteration of valuable historical evidence ; for the objects found jii'e sold to travellers, and, it is to be feared, to museums, with false accounts of their provenance, it being unsafe to betray their real source. The letter advocates some joint action as to this, and at the same time invites consultation as to the possibility of nuitual arrangement regarding areas of exploration for the different societies, with a view to co-ordination of effort in organised research. Mr. Phene Spiers, whose account of the Great Mosque of Damascus appeared in the Quarterhj Stafenienf, 1897, pp. 282 sqq., contributes to the present number a critical discussion of the ruins of the temple excavated by the Germans at Baalbec. He pioposes some interesting explanations of the halls and exedrae, and investigates the date and origin of the leading architectural features. Readers are also indebted to Professor W. Max Miiller, of Philadelphia, one of the greatest Egyptologists of the day, for a valuable paper on the Egyptian monument of Tell esh-Shihab, discovered by Pro- fessor George Adam Smith in 1901. His well-known Aden vnd Europa is the standard work upon Palestine in the light of Egypto- logical discoveries, and the monument in question is naturally valuable evidence for the study of a subject which he has made so peculiarly his own. For some years past, four Samaritan manuscripts have been pre- served in the offices of the Fund. Although of no antiquity, they are not without their interest, and, for the sake of students of Samaritan literature in particulai-, it was deemed advisable to publish a short general account of their contents. !Mr. Cowley, sub-librarian of the Bodleian, Oxford, an eminent Samaritan scholar, has kindly written a description of these manuscripts (pp. 67 •'\"/'/.), and the specimens of liturgical compositions (one reaching back to the fourth century of this era) which he has translated will be read with interest by others than specialists. A 2 4 NOTES AND NEWS. \"The so-called lower pool of Siloam, which for so many years has \"been a receptacle for sewage, and is such a source of annoyance to all visitors to the Old Pool, has recently been purchased by the Oreek ecclesiastical authorities, who have surrounded it with a good wall, have to a large extent cleared it out, and are proposing to make it the site of a convent.\" — From Home Wwds. \"We regret to learn that there is an outbreak of what is reported to be cholera at Bethlehem, which has consequently been very strictly isolated. Prompt measures have been taken, and there is every reason to hope that the disease may be stamped out before it becomes epidemic. Fever has been unusually prevalent this year. In the October number of Biblia, Professor W. M. Miiller has a comniTTnication respecting the two German societies — the Orient- gesellschaft and the Vorderasiatische Gesellschaft. The foimer is a wealthy institution, as it has the aid of the Geiman Emperor and the Court, and its excavations are carried on for the Berlin Museums. The latter was founded by a number of scholars, and, being without official aid, is compelled to limit its sphere of opera- tions according to its means. It has sent Dr. Hugo Winckler to be present at the excavations now carried on at Sidon, and this scholar's report, it is expected, will soon be published. It is interesting to learn that he has discovered a lengthy Aramaic inscription in a well near Sidon. Professor Midler's letter concludes with the hope that readers will join the society, and thus contribute to its funds. We wish the Vorderasiatische Gesellschaft every success. The Tomh of Fhillip d'AuMgni/. — At the Annual General Meeting, held last June, it was mentioned by Sir Charles Wilson that the slab tomb of Phillip d'Aubigny had been broken a few months previously. On inquiry as to its present state, we have heard from Mr. Hanauer, who says : — \" The injury sustained was a crack across the slab, just below the point of the shield — other- wise all is perfect.\" As the inscription is well above the head of the shield, it would therefore not have been damaged. Phillip d'Aubigny was the tutor of Henry III, King of England, and Governor of Jersey and the Channel Islands.

A large and repiesentative gathering assembled at the invitation of the director, Professor Gustav Dalman, who made a short speech on the objects and aims of the new imder- taking. Professor Lohr gave an address on the famous con- troversy, \"Babel and Bible,\" and a telegram with good wishes from the P^mperor was received with much enthusiasm. Professor Dalman is forming a museum containing specimens of every kuid of utensil used by the bedouin and fellahin, with models of tents,, oil-presses, and other lai'ger objects. The programme comprises lectures on the customs of the fellahin and on modern Arabic (especially the native songs) by Professor Dalman, and on the geography of Palestine by Professor Lohr. All those who are interested in the welfare of Palestine cannot but wish this Institute success and prosperity, and we must congratulate it on having at its head so distinguished an Orientalist. Would thsit this country could establish a similar institute ! It may be well to mention that plans and photographs alluded to in the reports from Jerusalem and elsewhere cannot all be pub- lished, but they are preserved in the office of the Fund, where they may be seen by subscribers. Those sent by Mr. Macalister illus- trating the excavations at Gezer which are not reproduced in his quarterly report are held over for the final memoir. A number of lectures are to be delivered in Scotland and the provinces on the Fund's excavations at Gezer, and it is hoped that where arrangements have not yet been made, subscribers and those interested in the work will communicate through the Local Secretary. The attention of subscribers is called to a work by Sir Charles Warren, entitled \"The Ancient Cubit and our Weights and Measures.\" He brings evidence to show that all weights and measures (except those of the metrical system) are derived from one source — the double-cubit cubed of Babylonia. a NOTES AND NEWS.

By R. A. Stewart Macalister, M.A., F.S.A. § I._SUMMARY OF THE QuARTER'S AVoRK. The excavation has proceeded since the forwarding of the last report, with two interruptions — first, a three weeks' interval of rest which I gave myself and the hxbourers during Septeni1)er, and, secondly, a Aveek in November, during which an attack of tlie fever that lias been epidemic in the district throughout the summer prevented me from allowing the work to be carried on, as I was unable to attend to the walls or the objects unearthed. The discoveries that have been made this quarter are not quite of such exceptional interest. This is due to two causes: partly simple chance, the soil turned over (though not less prolific than that examined in previous quarters) containing fewer exceptional objects ; and partly the very considerable time occupied in the clearance of the large pool south of the rock-cut high place, the excavation of which bad been commenced when the previous report was forwarded. I confess to have been doubtful at times as to the advisability of devoting so much labour to a work which, as the event proved, was not very\" productive in interesting antiquities ; but it was, of course, impossiljle to foresee what might or might not lie concealed in the silt at the bottom — objects were as likely to be found there as anywhere else — and in any case it is satisfactory to have obtained the complete design of a very remarkable, and, perhaps, unique engineering work. In addition to the clearance of this pool, the Seleucid necropolis of the city has been located and its examination commenced, and the trenching of the Eastern Hill has been continued. § II.— The Pool. The difficulty of dealing the pool will be realised when it is remembered that it was filled, not with earth, but with large heavy stones which had evidently been thrown into it, and that each of IQ KEPORT OX THE EXCAVATION OF GEZER. these stones had to be curried out separately— many of them, indeed, had to be broken into several pieces with a sledge-hammer before they could be removed. The length and breadth are given in the previous report (p. 321 of last year's Quarterly Statement) at 57 and 46 feet respectively. Amid many expressions of rejoicing on the part of the foreman and labourers, tired of the arduous work of transporting large stones, bottom was found at a depth of 25 feet 6 inches below the level of the rock, 41 feet 6 inches below the surface of the ground. Their satisfaction, however, after a few hours' further excavation turned out to be premature ; for in the centre of the floor of the pool a second pool was found to be sunk, 27 feet long and 24 feet 6 inches broad,' which proved to be of about the same depth as the first. The excavation of this lower pool was less troublesome, in that it was almost completely filled with silt, .and contained but few large stones ; but as all its contents had to be carried up to the present surface of the ground, the work proceeded more and more slowly with evej-y increase of depth. The two pools are wholly quarried in the soft porous chalky limestone which forms the rock of the hill. The sides, which are irregular and have many hollows and projecting bosses, are covered with two coats of cement, each about | inch thick, the outer coat being smooth and comparatively fine, the inner coat being gritty. As the work proceeded a careful search was kept up all rovuid the walls for marks, graffiti, or inscriptions, but none were found. A flight of steps, the lower part cut in the rock, the upper part of masonry and now much broken, runs down the western side of the upper pool, and returns a short distance on the southern side ; it is continued by a narrow flight, wholly rock-cut, running clown the southern and eastern sides of the lower pool (Fig. 1). A rough calculation shows that the pool, when full, would contain in round numbers some four million gallons of water. It is evident that it was excavated as a public work, to serve as a common reservoir for the use of the town, perhaps also to supply the two baths already discovered and reported upon,-' Avhich are close by. How the pool was filled with water is a problem on which the excavation has thrown no light whatever. No doubt ' These ure the measurements at the toj) ; it narrows toward the bottom. ■' Quar/erfi/ Statement, 1903, p. 113. REPOKT ON TIIK KXCAVATION OF CKZEi;. I 1 surface mid roof draiiiacre was conveyed to it by some system of conduits, Imt no tangible trace of any such construction was discovered. The question of the date to which the pool is t(j be assigned must now be re-examined. That it was open at the latest period of the occupation of tlie tcJl is shown by the entire absence of foundations and of antiquities in the soil that overlay its surface. It seems clear that when the site was finally abandoned, and de-voted to pasture or tillage, this great chasm was recognised as EXCAVATION OF CEZER'. the pool f'uj^/tLce- /?/* ^r^icn^ Fig. 1.— The Pool. being useless and dangerous, and was in conseqiience tilled up purposely with the large stones that no doubt at that time cumbered the hilltop in much greater quantities than at present. (Among these stones, it may be observed in passing, are several Ijearing coarse mouldings, also a fragment of a volute of an Ionic capital. No buildings have yet been discovered with which these remains can be associated.) Then vegetable soil gradually grew over the heap of stones, so that at last the hollow was filled up and the pool forgotten. All the datable objects, with one exception, found within the pool belong umnistakably to the Maccabean period. The one 12 REPORT OX THE EXCAA^ATIOxN OF GEZEK. exception, it is curious to note, is the only jar-handle yet found on the mound bearing the royal stamp of the unknown town \" Memshath.\" ^ The other objects discovered were potsherds and a few more or less sound vessels, undoubtedly Maccabean, handles and other fragments of Rhodian wine-amphora' (including several with Greek stamps), a few small Ptolemaic coins, beads, and frag- ments of iron picks, possibly broken tools of the quarrymen. The great depth of silt in the lower pool seems to show that the reservoir was seldom if ever cleared out ; and there is no reason to suppose that the relics found are merely the last accumulation, and that in previous cleansings of the reservoir earlier remains were removed. The Hebrew jar-handle (which might have been washed or thrown in at any time) cannot, I think, upset the unanimous testimony of the remaining objects as to the Maccabean date of the pool. In favour of this conclusion may be advanced another considera- tion. As I have just said, it is evident that the reservoir was a great municipal work, designed to supply the town with water, especially in the case of a siege. In earlier pre-Captivity times the same end was attained by the nvmierous cisterns scattered all over the surface of the hill. These cisterns had all been closed up and forgotten before the Maccabean period ; this follows from the almost total absence of Maccabean pottery among the numerous sherds recovered from the debris within them. Had they been in use this great and expensive work would have been unnecessary. The only time when they were not in use was the Maccabean period, and it follows that this is the most probable period to which to assign the excavation of the pool. An argument which I brought forward in the last report, before the excavation was complete, drawn from the dip of the lower strata towards the pool, and Avhich I relied upon to indicate that the pool was a more ancient work handed down and used by many generations of the inhaljitants, is evidently invalid. The dip of the strata may merely indicate that there was a natural hollow in the ground, the existence of which possibly determined the choice of the site for the excavation.

Of the domestic structures none need be referred to here, with the exception of a row of small chambers belonging to the lowest stratum of building (Stratum II, Stratum I being the rock-cut dwellings). These chambers contained burnt grain — in one barley^ in another wheat, in u third a mixture of these grains, in others various species of vetches (peas, &c.). Another contained chopped straw. Evidently the series formed a grain magazine or market that had been destroyed b}' fire. The first two of the chambers were found in 1902, just before the work was transferred to the neighl)Ourhood of the Canaanite temple ; the excavation of the entire row has now hecn completed. In this section I may also refer to a curious erection of fragments of jars found under the floor of the corner of a room of the second stratum. The room was paved with a plaster layer, in which a round hole had been cut ; underneath this was the lower half of a jar, inverted, with an aperture cut in the base. There were two other portions of jars underneath the first. The accompanying figure represents the elevation and section of this construction, which was no doubt a drain meant to carry away water from the floor ; compare the drain figured p. 20 of last year's Quarterly Statement, and the much more elaborate Babylonian example figured in Hilprecht's Excavations in Bible Lands, p. 365. The drain here described did not lead to any conduit or cesspool, but merely conveyed water downwards so as to be dispersed through the soil under the foundation of the house. Two more drains, of almost identical pattern, have been discovered during the writing of this report. § IV. — Stone, Bronze, and Iron Objects. The only objects in stone calling for notice here are, first, a flint arrov.'head \\\\ inches long which has just been found in the fourth stratum during the writing of this report. It is the only flint arrowhead with barbs that I have seen from Palestine. Barbed bronze arrowheads have not appeared in the Fund excava- tions before the Seleucid period (seventh stratum at Gezer). Secondly, a fine mould for casting bronze daggers, chisels, axeheads, and celts (third stratum). In bronze the majority of the objects found have been of the usual types — arrowheads, pins, needles, spatulas, chisels, rings, IIEPORT ON THE KXCAVATIOX OF c.K/.KU. ;> axeheads, and a spearhead. These are found in all strata indis- criminately, except, of course, the Neolithic first ami second. A copper knife-blade from the third stratum, and a sinail bronze squatting liguie of an animal, found in a cistern liclonging to the fourth, arc jjcrhaps worth mention. The ])rincipal iron ol)jects have been nnuh corroded and broken fra^'ments of picks and hooks, perhaps t|uariymen's tools, found in the large pool. § V. — Eelioiox and Folklore. Numerous specimens of Astarte plaques, presenting an interesting variety of types (a full discussion of which nutst be postponed till Fig. 3. — Figure of Astarte. the concluding memoir) have come to light. These have all been found in the fourth stratum. The most interesting yet found is here illustrated (Fig. .\"}) ; it is remarkable, in the first place for being unbroken, and in the second for the thoroughly Egyptian 16 REPOKT ON THE EXCAVATION OF GEZER. e<iuipmeiit of the figure ; it might almost be taken as a repre- sentation of Hathor. As a general rule any distinctively Egyptian features are conspicuously absent from these plaL[ues, unless we count the lotus-flower which the figures are frequently represented as grasping in their hands. In Fig. 4 is shown a very curious conventionalised plaque (reduced to half size). Here the human figure has degenerated to two discs, a larger and a smaller, the larger having a circular notch cut out on each side. The upper surface liears rows of indented dots round the edges and down the middle ; some of these are emphasised with a spot of red paint. Fig. 4. — ConTentionalised Astarte Plaque. In the second ^stratum was found the first example of an adult human foundation sacrifice as yet discovered on the site. This was the skeleton of a woman of advanced age, deposited in a hollow under the corner of a house. The body was lying on its back, the legs being bent up (but not doubled) ; at the head was a small bowl, and between the femora and tibiae a large two-handled jar — no doubt food-vessels. The exact disposition of the skeleton is shown on Plate II. Pathologically the skeleton had some interest, the right arm and shoulder having been distorted by some rheumatic affection.

No new forms have come to light except a curious filter, 5 inches in diameter, from tlie third stratum. It is broken, but the complete plan can be made out — a small l)0\\vl, with perfora- tions in the bottom, having a wide rim that no doubt rested on the mouth of the vessel intended to receive the purified liquid. There was one handle, now broken off*, attached to the rim. A few more lamp-and-bowl deposits have been found and noted ; they add nothing, however, to our knowledge of the site repre- sented by them. A cave containing several pieces of very early pottery deposited round the wall {m', § VII) has been opened, but the types have l)cen represented by other ^-essels already discovered and illustrated. § VII. — Caves and Cisterns. The area of the moiuid is l)eintf excavated in successive sections 40 feet wide and 80 or 90 feet long, and scarcely one of these sections is carried down to the rock surface without the mouth of a cave or a cistern being exposed. These are all, as I have already stated, carefully cleared of their contents as soon as they are found. Two caves found during the past quarter are of special interest. The first ^ is approached by a downward slope cut in the rock, 7 feet 3 inches long and 2 feet 10 inches across, terminating in a small circular cell 5 feet 6 inches in diameter. From this cell a side doorway leads into the principal chamber, which is about 8 feet in maximum height ; aliout half the area of the floor is raised by a step 2 feet 9 inches above the other half. The lower part of the floor is covered with a series of shallow cups, most of them about 10 inches deep and 1 foot 6 inches across. It is these which mark out the cave as unique among those yet found on the tell, and raise interesting, but at present insoluble, prol)lems as to the purj)ose of its excavation. Close l)y this cave a cistern of the ordinary bottle shape was opened at a later period. This cistern belongs to the lowest stratum of building on the tell, as no shaft was found carrying its mouth up through the debris. That it is later than the cave, * [Plans and photographs are held over until tlie final memoir.] REPOIIT 0\\ TlIK EXCAVATION OF GEZEH. in however, is shown hy tlie great length of the shaft of the cistern — rather more than twice the ordinary length ; the reservoir had to be cut below the level of the cave in order to avoid breaking into it. The second cave contained twcj chaml)ers connected by an luuoofcd passage scarfed in the rock. Access to the first (southern) chamber was gained originally by a stepped passage of the usual sort; a wall had been built across the entrance leading to the unroofed passage. On the surface of the eaith, with which the chaml)er was more than half filled, were deposited, evidently in ordered arrangement, the fragments of two large jars l)rokcu loneitudinallv in halves ;iih1 lying nii their sides; they contained Fig. 5. — Pottery Head from Troglodyte Cave. much decayed bone debris. There were also three saucers, two jugs, and one spouted vessel lying beside the walls of the chamber. The pottery was all of the type found in the l)urial cave described in the fiist of the present series of reports. There were also a fragment of the occij^ital region of a skull, and splinters of a nuich- decayed femur. Under the siu-face of the earth were found many fragments of the characteristic cave pottciy and pieces of cow l)ones ; there was also a part of the lower jaw of a child of about six years, and some fragments of an irifant's skull. The most interesting object, hoAvever, was a very singular human head in pottery, probably the oldest attempt at modelling yet found in the tell. It is here illustrated (Fig. 5) as a unique extynple of troglodyte c 2 20 lIEPOItT ON THE EXCAVATION OF GEZER. art. The marked prognathism, whicli probably reflects a charac- teristic of the race to which the artist belonged, will not escape notice. It is 2i inches high. The floor of this chamber, like that of the cave already descril)ed, had two Clip-marks. Part of its area was covered Avith a pavement of lime, underneath which was nothing but one or two rude flaked flint knives. The passage connecting the chambers contained some further specimens of troglodyte pottery, and a collection of remarkal)ly fine flaked flint knives. The second chamber contained nothing but potsherds and a fragment of a stone mortar. § VIII. — Egyptian Objects. The only Egyptian objects catalogued in this c^uarter's journal, beside the scarabs tabulated below, are the lower part of a small figure in grey friable paste (between Strata III and IV), and a Horus-eye and small pendant plaque with a seated female figure in relief upon it, both in green enamelled paste (Stratum V).

That, at least, part of the tombs referable to the Seleucid period of occupation are to be looked for on the northerii slope of the hill south of the tell is shown by the existence of a number of tombs which have been rifled at some former time and left ojien. These open tombs are not many, and they are sufficiently far apart to raise the hope that unrifled tombs will he found interspersed among them. Dimng the coming quarter I hope to prosecute a search for these. The opened tombs have evidently been broken into many years ago — this is indicated by their being almost all filled up with silt. I have commenced operations on the necropolis by clearing out two of these tombs completely in order to recover their plans and to test the chance of finding objects left behind by the marauders. The result has been encouraging, at least in the case of one of these tombs. I prefer to hold back the plans until I liave more nearly completed the examination of the necrojjolis, when all can be collected and pulilished together. The first tomb examined is a single chamber Avhich had evidently been closed by a rolling stone ; on each side are arcosolia, and, at the inner end, a group of sunk l)ench graves. Nothing was found in this tomb except a few bones. The second proved much more important. It was evidently the tomb of soirie family of distinction, and was an elaborate and costly work. A square vestibule sunk in the rock, and now open to the sky, gives access to two chambers, one on the southern, the other on the eastern side. The eastern chamber contains arcosolia ; the southern has sunk bench graves round the wall, and strewn on the floor were found a few fragments that evidently formed part of a carved sarcophagus which probably stood in the middle. South of this chamber is a second, smaller apartment, also containing sunk bench graves.

This argument proved valid in the present case, for a nunil)er of bimps, some prettily ornamented, and one with a Greek inscription, a consider- able quantity of beads, a small bronze bell, and a remarkable portable altar in soft limestone came to light.

In the concluding section of these notes I propose to consider some of the A'iews of those earnest Christians of all denominations who, for various reasons, find themselves unable to accept the traditional sites as genuine. The situation of the Church of the Holy Sepulchre within the modern cit}' is, in itself, almost suggestive of doubt. Educated pilgrims to the Holy City are often sorely perplexed when they visit the \" holy places \" for the first time. They know that Christ suffered without the gate. They find Golgotha within the walls of a small Oriental city and in close proximity to its thronged bazars. They may realise that the Jerusalem of Herod was not a large city, and may believe that the ground upon which the church stands was outside the walls at the time of the Crucifixion ; but at the same time there lingers in their minds an uneasv feelina; ' Tliore arc two .slight misprints in tlie last Report wliich i-equire correction.

The features of the ground have been so altered, there has l»eeii so much building, and the \" holy places \" are so obscured by decorative and xotive ofterings, that a strong effort of the imagination is re({uired to restore the form of the ground as it existed before the churches of Constantine were built. Many pilgrims, either from indolence or from want of knowledge, never attempt to make the eilort. They form a hasty and unfavourable opinion upon a difficult and obscure question, and seek some spot which appeals more directly to the e)'e and to their i)reconceived ideas of the charactei- and appearance of (Golgotha. The date at which doubts with regard to the authenticity of the \"holy places \"first arose is unknown. But some explanation of their position Avithin the walls seems to have l)een considei'cd necessary as early as the eighth century. The quaint statement of AVillibald ^ {drc. A.D. 75+), that Calvary was formerly outside Jerusalem, \" but Helena, wlien she found the Cross, arranged that place so as to be within the city,\" reads like a reply to the remarks of some doubting spirit of his age. A somewhat clearer apprecia- tion of the situation is noticeable in the twelfth, thirteenth, and fourteenth centuries. Thus Saewulf - (1102-3), AVilbrand von Oldenberg-^ (1212), Jacobus de Vitriaco ^ (Jacques de ^'it^y, rirr. 1226), Burchardus de Monte Siou'^ (1283), Odoricus de Foro Julii, Frejus\" (1320), and Guilielmus de Boldensele \" (1332), maintained that Hadrian, when lie re1»uilt Jerusalem, greatly enlarged the city and enclosed Golgotha and the Ploly Sepulchre which were previously outside the walls. There would appear to have been for several centiu'ies two conflicting views : one that the city had l)eeu moved from its. ' JTo,/., xviii, see P.P. Text Series, toI. iii, p. 19.. -■ lielatio de per.

Monconys^^ (1647) writes that Calvar}', according to tradition, was outside Jerusalem, but that it was difficult to realise this, since the place was then in the centre of the city, which was much smaller than at the time of the Crucifixion. Ill the eighteenth century the authenticity of the \" holy places \" -was vigorously attacked and denied by Jonas Korte,\" a bookseller of Altona, who visited Jerusalem in 1738. Korte's view is ^succinctly descriljed in the title of one of the chapters of his Itook — \" On Mount Calvary, which now lies in the middle of the town and cannot therefore be the true Calvary.\" He argues that the traditional Golgotha is too near the site of the Temple, ' Burcliardiis, I.e. ; see al*o Ludolph von Sudlieim, Descrijiiio Terr.

On his plan three crosses are shown outside the Sion Gate, and referenced, \" Now called Mount Sion, perhaps the place of our Saviour's Crucifixion.\" The tomb of Joseph is assumed to be one of the sepulchres in the Valley of Hinnom on which the inscription, \" Of the holy Sion \" appears.

Ill 1841 the publication of Dr. Kobinson's Biblical Hesearches in Pakdine, whicli at once took its place as the standard work on the topography of the Holy Land, drew serious attention to the questions coiuiected with the traditional tomb, especially in Great Britain and the United States. Dr. Eobinson rejected the accepted tradition, and his great reputation for accuracy of observation and extensive reading gave peculiar importance to his opinion. After a careful consideration of the whole question with the material then available, he came to the conclusion that from every point of view, topographical, historical, and traditional, the decision must be that \" Golgotha and the Tomi) shown in the Church of the Holy Sepulchr'e are not upon the real places of the Crucifixion and Eesurrection.''^ Eobinson very wisely did not attempt to locate the \" holy places.\" \" If it l)e asked,\" he writes, \" where then are the true sites of Golgotha and the Sepulchre to be sought ? — I must reply that probably all search can only be in vain.\"- He does, however, suggest that it may have lieen on the road to Jaffa, or on that to Damascus. Eobinson's opinion that the traditional site of the tomb was not authentic was accepted b}' many writers who, less cautious than the learned American, asserted with confidence that they had found the true sites of the Crucifixion and Eesurrection. One of the first to publish his views was Otto Thenius^ (1842), who identified \" Jeremiah's Grotto,\" and the hill above it, sometimes called \" Skull Hill,\" with the Tomb of Christ and Golgotha. The hill is described as being rounded on the north, west, and east, but abrupt on the south, and as having the form of a skull — whence it might be called Golgotha. \" The hill is outside and near the town ; near a road which must have existed in the time of Christ; and it has in the very place (John xix, 41) a rock-hewn cavern which has an entrance such as the Holy Sepulchre must have had.\" Thenius believed that the tomb was inside \" Jeremiah's Grotto,\" l)ut had been cjuarried away with the exception of the actual place upon which the body ' Biblical Re-searches, 2nd ed., 185(5, vol. i, pp. 407-418.

The knoll ali()\\e \" .leremiah's Grotto\" was also identified with (loli^otha l>y Fisher Howe ' (1871), whose description of the place may I'o quoted as representing the imaginative view of the present day : - \" Thf hill is left steeply rounded on its west, north, and east sides, Forniinj.( the back ami sides of the kranioit or skull.'-' The skull-like front, or fare, on the .south side is formed by the deep perpendicular cutting and removal of the ledge. To the observei', at a distance, the eyeless socket of the .skull would be sugge.stcd at once by the yawning cavern, hewn within it.s face, beneath the hill.' Fisher Howe maintains that the present city wall marks the course of the second wall of Joscjthus ; that pi'e\\'ious to the coii- stitiction of the second wall the eastern spur (Bczetha) was a continuous ridge; and that the wide open cutting south of \"Jere- miah's Grotto \" (between A and B on plan) was part of the general plan of fortification connected with that wall.'' The same spot, considered permissil)le l)y Kenan (>rr p. 29, note 2), was selected by Conder^ (1878) on account of the suita- bility of its position, and, mainly, on the ground that it was pointed fiut by Jews at Jerusalem \"by the name Beth has-Sekilah, 'the Place of Stoning,'\" and, \"according to Jewish tradition,\" was \" the ancient place of public execution.\" Conder identifies the tomb of • loscph. with a rock-hewn sepulchre (No. 1 on plan) about 200 yards west of '• Jeremiah's Grotto.\"'^ The view that Christ suffered on the hill above \"Jeremiah's Grotto\" was widely accepted in this country and in America when it became known that it had received the support of the late General Gordon'' (188:)— 1).

But the site is one that appeals directly to tlie eyes of those who fi'om infancy have heard Calvary called a \" mount,\" and to the minds of those to whom tradition is distasteful, especially when it relates to a scriptural site. The arguments urged in favour of the spot may be stated thus : — (1) Its elevation and conspicuous position ; (2) its resemblance to a human skull; (3) its. proximity to the citv and to the great road to the north ; (4) the Jewish tradition which identifies it with the \"Place of Stoning \" ; (5) the tradition relating to the martyrdom of Stephen ; and (6) the existence of tombs in the vicinity — one of which is described \"as recalling very nearly the proljable appearance of the new tomb of Joseph.\"^ ' \"The Site of Ciilvavy,\" in Andover llcv., 1S85.

(1) II has already been pointed ont ^ that \" there is no indica- tion in the Bible that Golgotha was skull-like in form, or that Christ was crucified on a hill ; that near Jerusalem elevation is not necessary for visibility ; that no Greek writer uses the expression \"mount\" in connection with the spot; and that the skull-like appearance and elevation of Golgotha are apparently fancies introduced from the West. (2) Resemblance to a skull can hardly be regarded as a serious argument, for it involves the assumption that the appearance of the hill, and of \" an artificial cliff produced by ancient quarrying,\" 2 has not altered during the last 1,870 years. There are some reasons for believing that, at the time of the Crucifixion, the eastern spur was a continuous ridge ; that the quarries were then worked underground ; that the wide open cutting south of \" Jeremiah's Grotto \" (between A and B, see plan) had its origin in the ditch of Agrippa's Avail, and did not assume its present form and dimensions until the fifth century, when the great church of St. Stephen was built ^ ; that after the erection of the church portions of the quarry were used as a cemetery; and that some of the excavation is as late as the time of the Crusades. In the first century the eastern spur was at this point a rocky ridge of some width {see Plate *) covered with stony detritus which is still visible, and its essential features appear to have remained unchanged until the period of the Crusades. Daniel ^ (1106-7) calls it \" a flat rocky mountain.\" The knoll, which is supposed to give a skull-like form to the hill, is due to the ruined tombs and accumulations^ of a Moslem cemetery which dates from the fourteenth or fifteenth century. The view that any portion of the very hard limestone beds above \" Jeremiah's Grotto \" could have been worn into a rounded or skull-like form by the action of wind and weather is untenable.''^ » Quarterly Staiemenf, 1902, p. 147.' ^ Dawson, I.e., p. 107.

It is possible that the road then followed the easier slope up the Tyropoeon Valley,' and ran north-west until it met the road from the Upper City. The existing road between the \" Tombs of the Kings \" and the Damascus (Tate, possibly following an earlier footpath, may only date fi'()m the reign of Hadrian. In any case the distance from \" Skull Hill\" to that road is greater than wotild be customary- in the case of a Homan crucifixion. (4) There is no evidence that there was a special Jewish place of execution at Jerusalem in the first century, and the existing local tradition which connects \"Jeremiah's Grotto\" with the \"Place of Stoning \" is luireliable.^ (5) The tradition that St. Stephen suffered martyrdom outside the Damascus Gate may have been based on an eai'lier one that he was stoned outside the north gate of the city, which \\vould be that of the second wall. There is no evidence that he was put to death at a place of public execution. (6) The rock-hewn tomb supposed to be that of Joseph of Arimathca, and called \" Gordon's Tomb of Christ\" or \"the Garden Tomb,\" is one of the most insignificant in the great necropolis which surrounds Jerusalem, and does not resemble the class of sepulchre which a man of Joseph's rank and position is likely to have had hewn out for himself. Unlike the Jewish tombs near the city, it is cut in the cliflf of a disused quarry, and not in the scarped face of one of the beds of limestone.'^ Some of the details in the toml)'' are certainly Christian, and there seems every reason to ■~u})pose that it l)elongs to the great cemetery north of the city, of which a portion north of the tomb is owned by the Dominicans, and south of it l)y the Germans.\" The extensive cemetery, partly ' See plan, Quarterly Statement, 1902, p. 202. - Ibid., 1902, p. 154. ■' Ibid., 1902, pp. 152-155. ^ See view, ibid., 1903, p. 85. •' The only accurate plan and description of this tomb are those by Dr. S.hick {ibid., 1S!92, pp. 121 t(jq.).

During the Byzantine period the luck level was ])robably that of the sill of the door of the tomb, but it was cut down to make room for the Jsun-ie of the Crusaders. The tomb which Conder suggests may have been that of Joseph (Xo. 4 on plan) is certainly Jewish ; ])ut its distance from the assumed site of Calvary on the knoll,- (500 feet, is greater than the narrative of John xix, 17, seems to indicate. Fergusson^ (1847) maintained chiefly upon architectural groitnds that the \"Dome of the Eock,\" in the Haram esh-Sheiif, was the Church of the Resurrection erected by Constantine over the reputed Tomb of Christ. The Tomb he identified Avith the cave beneath the Sakhra, and Golgotha was placed near the Golden Gate. Fergusson urged that the Crucifixion must have takei!! place near the Temple, which he located in the south-Avest anglo of the Han\\m esh-Sherif, since the priests could not otherwise have looked on Avithout incurring risk of ceremonial defilement. The theory, Avhich attracted much attention at the time, Avas adopted by Langlois ^ (1861), Unger\" (1863), and a fcAv other- Avriters ; but the discovery of the Medeba mosaic, on Avhich the Church of Constantine appears on the site noAv occupied by the Church of the Holy Sepulchre, has show^n that Mr. Fergusson AA'as entirely mistaken in his vieAvs. Miuik-* (1856) considered that it AA-as difficult to draAv the second Avail so as to exclude the traditional sites, and that the tradition relating to the disco\\'ery of the Tomb Avas not beyond criticism.

I at one time ^ adopted Dr. Gobat's view under the impression that the hill of Bezetha was covered witli houses at the time of the Crucifixion ; but a recon- .^ideration of the history of Jerusalem during the first 40 years of the first century has led me to modify my opinion with reference to the occupation of Bezetha and possibility of its having been the 8cene of the Passion (see p. 38). Canon Gill- suggests the \"Tond)s of the Kings \" as possiljly the sepulchre in which the body of Christ was laid, but the distance from the city and the character of the Tomb seem opposed to this theory. Keim\" (1883) considers that a spot near the castle garrison would have been selected for safety's sake, and places Golgotha near the Jaffa Gate. Clos-^ (1898) adopts the traditional Golgotha, but places the Tomb some 200 yards to the south of it. The general opinion which I have formed with regard to the traditional sites may be thus stated :— There is no decisive reason, historical, traditional, or topographical, for placing Golgotha and the Tomb where they are now shown. At the same time there is no direct evidence that they were not so situated. No objection surged against the sites is of such a convincing nature that it need disturb the minds of those who accept, in all good faith, the .-uithcnticity of places Avhich are hallowetl by the prayeis of coiuitlcss pilgrims since the days of Constantine.

He maintained that the Temple ought to have been built on the knoll above \" Jeremiah's Grotto,\" which he called \"Skull Hill,\" but that the builders, the Jews, rejected that rock, or stone, and erected the building further south, on the knoll, or rock, within the Haram esh-Sherif — that is, at the spot where the Dome of the Rock now stands.- Neverthe- less, by Divine providence, the stone which was refused or rejected by the builders became the head corner-stone (1 Peter ii, 7) ^ through the crucifixion of Christ upon it (Ephes. ii, 20).

By Professor Clermont-Ganneav, M.I. 25. Platanos and riatane. — Polybiiis,i and later Josephus, indepen- dently tell us of a locality in Phoenicia which they call Platanos and Fhifane respectively, Avhose identity and site no one has yet succeeded in determining; the only hint that results from their tlata is that it should be found in the neighbourhood of Sidon and to the north of it. In the first place, let us examine the facts of the problem, which, although they have been discussed several times,- have not yet received a solution, and let us begin with those which Josephus ^ furnishes. They relate to one of the most tragic episodes in Jewish history. Herod, after he had executed Mariamne his wife, vented his hatred upon his two sons Alexander and Aristobulus. With the approval of Augustus he brought them l^efore a high court of justice, constituted ad Jwc at Beirtit, under the auspices of the Eoman authorities of Syria. It was a sinister comedy. Herod himself brought the charge, demanding capital piinishment, and the two unfortunate princes were con- demned without even being heard. Their father, who had brought them prisoners with him, left them under guard in a village of the Sidojiians named Platane, and near to the city,'* in case their presence was required. But this was not the case. Immediately after the sentence, Herod, after conveying them to Tyre and Csesarea, finished l>y having them strangled in Samaria in 6 A.D. It follows from this that the village of Platane belonged to Sidonian territory, and ought probably to be found in the direction of Beirut, consequently north of Sidon, since in the phrase used by Josephus the word 7r6Xi<f seems rather to refer to the first of these tv o places — Sidon only figures as an ethnic. We shall now see that the second information, that furnished by Polybius, agrees ' I can only recall in passing the mention of our Platanos by Stephen of Byzantium ; it is evidently borrowed from the narrative of Polybius. ^ <S'cc, among others, Robinson, Paldstina, iii, pp. 713-715. •' Atilifj., xvi, 11 ; Bell.

The account of the canipai<(n undertaken in 219-218 u.C. hy Antiochus TIT against Ptolemy IV, master of the greater part of Phccnieia, is given in detail Ijy Polyhius (v, G8-70). Antiochus, operating both on land and sea, turned first to Marathus (Amrit), where the men of Arados lallied to his cause, having forgotten — thanks to his intervention — their ancient differences. Thence he came down south along the coast, having, as the narrative shows, Sidon as his aim. He approached the hostile territory from the side of Thcou ProHopon (Kas esh-Shakka), turning towards Beirut. Proceeding, he seized Eotrys (Batrun), after having burned Kalamos (Kahimun) and Trieres (Enfeh).^ His generals Nikarchos and Theodotos were sent ahead to occupy the defiles of the River Lykos (Nahr el-Kelb), which empties itself into the Mediterranean a little to the north of Beirut. Polyl)ius does not say, however, that Antiochus took this town ; on the other hand, it does not appear to have been in his power already. Perhaps he left it on one side in his hasty march. A\\'e see the king, in fact, at the head of his troops and convoyed by his fleet, which, under the command of the admiral Diognetos, flanked his movements, pushing forward to the banks of the River Damouras (the Tamyras of Strabo), the Nahr ed-Damlir, which enters the sea to the south of Beirut, and also marks the northern limit of the Sidonian territory. Having arrived here, he pitched his camp, then taking with him the light troops of Theodotos and Nikarchos, he threw himself forward to reconnoitre the enemy's position. There it was that Nikolaos, the Egyptian commander, master of Sidon, which was his base of operations, and supported by a powerful fleet, awaited Antiochus in order to dispute the passage. Nikolaos had resolved to defend the approaches, thus barring the road to Tyre, which for some little time had been in the hands of Antiochus. A\\'arned of his approach, he had made all his dispositions in advance. He had divided his troops into two bodies : the one occupied the defiles near Platanos (to kci-h II\\«t«»'oj' <7tgj/«), the other — under his ' The localities, owing, perhaps, to the somewhat involved construct, are not eQuuu-riited in their proper order, but their identity is bcvond doubt.

In addition, his Heet was assenihled close at hand, so as to support his action. Polyhius minutely describes the position where Nikolaos was intrenched. Here, he says, the lesser chain of the Lebanon comes close to the seashore, and the space is cut up again bv a steep and a1)rupt crest, leaving only a narrow and difficult passage along the sea front. Ajitiochus, having reconnoitred the places, decided to attack on tlie following day. He left the heavy infantry to guard the camp, under the command of Kikarchos, and divided his troops into three bodies : the first, under Theodotos, being instructed to attack and, if possiltle, to cany the buttress of Lebanon; the second, under Menedemos, to attempt the passage by the crest ; the third, under Diodes, to operate along the sea front. Antiochus, with his guard, placed himself in the centre, in order to conduct operations and to ])roceed where needed. The two hostile fleets drew near to the land, and prepared to co-operate in the action. When the signal was given, they engaged all along the line. In spite of the resistance oftered by Nikolaos, who had the advantage of the ground, Theodotos, on the extreme left, succeeded in dislodging the enemy entrenched upon the spur of Lebanon, and from this dominating position overwhelmed the Egyptians, who fled with a loss of 2,000 killed and as many wounded. The remains of the Egyptian army reoccupicd Sidon, and the fleet, seeing that the day was lost, retired. Antiochus then pursued his march and camped under the walls of Sidon, but, feeling that his forces were insuflicient, he did not attemi^t to besiege it, and pursued his way into the interior in the direction of Lake Tiberias. A\\'ith his subsequent movements we need not trouble ourselves. Tliere can scarcely be any doul)t but that the Platanos of I'olybius a'id the I'latane of Josephus are the same. The general position and the identity of the names (diftering only in the termination) is sufficient proof. VCe have seen that the Sidonian Platane ought to lie north of )Sid(jii, by the side of Beirut, and the .same conclusion as regards Platanos ajjpears with more clearness in the account of Polybius. It is evident that the strategic position occupied by Nikolaos commanded the approach to Sidon from the nortli, and covered it against the attack of Antiochus on the banks of the DamCir. Accordingly, Platanos (Platane) must be sought between the mouth of the Nahr Damu!' and Saida.
