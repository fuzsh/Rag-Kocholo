        "text": "The investigation and conservation of the Vienna Genesis, a Late Antique manuscript on purple parchment, included the study of parchment production and purple dyeing in the sixth century. The process of parchment making and of purple dyeing was recreated and compared with the Vienna Genesis and other manuscripts from the sixth and eighth centuries. Parchment made from the hides of young lambs and dyed with orchil resembled the folios of the Vienna Genesis. The results of material analysis and the study of parchment technology influenced decisions for the conservation and storage of the manuscript. Fragile areas of ink and parchment were stabilised with strips of adhesive coated Japanese tissue paper. The single folios are stored in folders of Japanese paper and museum matboard within a sink mat.\n\nThe history of the Austrian National Library in Vienna has been associated with a great many Bohemical manuscripts since their medieval beginnings. This situation arises from the close link between Austrian and Bohemian political and cultural history. Unfortunately, we lack primary sources for the history of the Imperial Court Library in the epoch after the death of Maximilian I until 1575, when Hugo Blotius was appointed the first official librarian. Individual acquisitions for the book collection connected with Ferdinand I of Habsburg are less well reconstructed in comparison with the Ambras library of his son Ferdinand of Tyrol. Other manuscripts could be identified on the basis of their personal dedications to Ferdinand I. Among those manuscripts is a tiny illuminated prayer book incorporated by librarian Hugo Blotius into Turcica (Cod. 11704). On the basis of the illuminations this prayer book can be newly identified as an unknown Bohemical manuscript. The decoration is dated and signed. It may be connected with the Prague Old Town guild painter Fabián Puléř (died after 15 December 1562), who has been known as the author of illuminated music manuscripts and contractually documented altar retables. The manuscript was written by Italian Johannes Cavalerius (1524–1580), chaplain and confessor of Archduke Ferdinand of Tyrol, who dedicated the illuminated prayer book to Emperor Ferdinand I. There are documented contacts between Cavalerius and the Prague Catholic church representatives: he was quite close to the St Vitus and Vyšehrad prelates. We presume that the manuscript illuminated in 1557 may have been meant as a gift expressing Cavalerius’ gratitude for being appointed provost of Vyšehrad Chapter of Saint Peter and Paul. In fact, Cavalerius was appointed in 1557. The commission of such a specific manuscript completes the existing image of the relations in the court cultural circle, Catholic representatives of the Church, and the Prague community of guild painters from around the mid-16th century.\n\nAround 1437 Frederick III (1415–1493) may have designed a symbolic device ‘En, Amor Electis, Iniustis Ordinor Ultor; Sic Fridericus ego mea iura rego’ with the letters A.E.I.O.U. (sometimes A.E.I.O.V.). The device is historically used as a motto by the Habsburgs. The AEIOU-device may have played a role in the expansion of the House of Habsburg to the northeast. The manufacture of the vellum for the Voynich Manuscript is dated at the early 15th century (1404–1438), in which the House of Habsburg up to 1556 expands to the most powerful imperial structure from the Germany to Italy & Iberia and Belgium to Hungary. Probably Frederick III was the first member of the House of Habsburg, whose chewing and speaking / articulation suffered from Mandular Prognathism (progenism), also called Habsburg jaw. Genetic disorders by inbreeding however could have occurred before Frederick III's reign and must have been observed as a menace for the House of Habsburg. In serious forms of progenism the problems in chewing may ruin the digesting process and health. The Habsburg jaw may also distort the correct articulation of some labial letters (B, ϝ- V, M, P, U, W). These phonetic elements may be avoided by persons who are suffering of serious forms of progenism. In both humans and animals, progenism can be the result of inbreeding.[8] Maybe Frederick III ordered the composition of a manual for the House of Habsburg with various ciphered scriptures, which was to be send and lend to other (northern and southern) Habsburg familiar branches. The core topic may have been the understanding, avoiding, preventing and healing of genetic disorders, which are caused by inbreeding."
