        "text": "The Magazine Publishers of America (MPA) is sponsoring a couple of public service ads that ask magazine readers to recycle. \"Be a Hero. Recycle Your Magazines,\" says one and \"Turn Over a New Leaf. Recycle Your Magazines!\" The ads were created by Jennifer Kraemer-Smith, art director for Time for Kids.\n\nNina Link, president of the MPA, said the ads are a \"friendly reminder that every one of us is a citizen of this world, and we each have a responsibility to do what we can to conserve and recycle our resources.\"\n\nOne of the difficulties with recycling magazines is the variation in how glossy magazine paper is handled in different jurisdictions across North America. The MPA says that, while two-thirds of U.S. household recycling accepts magazines, only about 20% are put in the blue box (or local equivalent). As an indication of the curious and particular difficulties of magazine recycling, MPA had to come up with two logos: one, the traditional three chasing arrows symbol for recycling and the words Please Recycle This Magazine; the second adds a second message – Please Remove Samples or Inserts Before Recycling, acknowleging the proliferation of non-paper inserts in magazines (e.g., CD disks, product samples, plastics).\n\nToday in the email, another edition of MediaScout, the news digest prepared daily by Maisonneuve magazine in Montreal, containing another brilliant precis (by Daniel Casey) of the so-called news of the day. The topic is the Montebello Summit as covered (or not covered, or covered up) in what MediaScout calls the Big Seven (Globe & Mail, National Post, La Presse, Ottawa Citizen, Toronto Star, CBC TV News and CTV News). As is often the case, the report today in MediaScout is much better written and more to the point than any of the accounts that it summarizes. The question is: how does Maisonneuve, a literary quarterly with the limited resources of a “cultural” magazine, continue to produce such a high quality news publication? And who are these people, the writers of MediaScout: Daniel Casey, Daniel Tencer, Jordan Himelfarb, Valeries Howes, Claire Ward? We imagine them locked in an attic somewhere in Montreal, speed-reading the news and then writing about it in well-formed sentences, all before dawn—how much black coffee does it take? Since signing on for MediaScout a couple of years ago, I haven’t paid for a single newspaper. (Out west of course we supplement MediaScout with the excellent online coverage at The Tyee.)\n\nLabels: maisonneuve, mediascout, osborne, the tyee\n\nFor the last six months, the BC Association of Magazine Publishers has been stumbling along under veils of secrecy thrown over a putative “labour dispute” that has been boiling away since February, an odd state of affairs for a staff consisting of two people working in one room. No mention of the dispute was made at the BCAMP Annual General Meeting in June, and the only committee that made no report to the AGM was the so-called Human Resources Committee, whose members were not identified.\n\nIn the aftermath of the AGM, a few rank-and-filers learned to their dismay that at least some of the Directors on the board knew nothing about the “dispute,” which had become so inflamed that the two employees engaged or embroiled in it were permitted to work in the same room only in the presence of a third party. This policy (unreported to the membership and at least some of the Board) must have posed no difficulty as the BCAMP office is (in my memory) a tiny room in the spire of the historic Sun Tower on Pender Street, where third parties have merely to open the door to separate first and second parties in the act of lunging for each other’s throats.\n\nAttempts by BCAMP members to find out what’s going on with either the “dispute,” which is still unresolved, or with the anonymous Human Resources Committee, have been spurned in emails from the president who, having consulted a “solicitor” and a “litigator,” has concluded that no discussion of the putative dispute can include rank-and-file members, who unlike board members are unprotected against “potential liability” and therefore would be putting themselves at risk. (The same rank-and-filers observe however unfairly that BCAMP has operated for years as a coterie of board members determined to protect the membership from damaging itself with too much information.)\n\nPublishing spectacles are not unknown to the historic Sun Tower, originally the World Tower, when it was the tallest building in the British Empire (103 metres), and owned by the World newspaper. In 1918 Harry Gardiner, aka the Human Fly, scaled its heights equipped only with bare fingers and sneakers, while thousands watched from the street. Five years later, after the Vancouver Sun moved into the tower, another huge crowd gathered in the street to watch Harry Houdini escape from a straitjacket while dangling from a rope above the sidewalk. They just don’t make publishing spectacles like they used to anymore.\n\nLabels: bcamp, labour dispute, osborne"
