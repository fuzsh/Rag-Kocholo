        "text": "Well this is going to be interesting. The dollar is down another penny against the Euro this morning.\n\nThis might force the US government's hand and make them raise rates(which they do not want to do). Other countries will not want to buy our treasuries when you end up getting a negative return because of dollar.\n\nHopefully you guys don't have much money dollar denominated interest bearing vehicles.\n\nThese are not record lows for the dollar yet but they are now entering into the high 140's which had not been seen since last spring. We will start to see very expensive oil again if the dollar keeps falling.\n\nThe stock market seems to like the dollar decline, if you are a MNC with lots of overseas sales your profits will increase nicely as the dollar falls.\n\nApparently the big trade right now is short the dollar, buy the S&amp;P.\n\nApparently the big trade right now is short the dollar, buy the S&amp;P.\n\nHow about unhedged foreign stock and bond funds?\n\nIf you are smart enough to be in those you are a killin'. I am not smart enough.\n\nIt ain't that hard, even for a dumb-ass liburul like me.\n\nIts easy to buy the shit now, but when did you get in. Usually in order to kill on a trade you need to buy when it looks like shit not like gold.\n\nThat fund went from 60 to 20 in two years. Now it is at 30. Timing is a bitch.\n\nIf you bought anything in March you would be up 50%.\n\nAnd you may be a lybril but I doubt many here would say you are stoop.\n\nIts easy to buy the shit now, but when did you get in.

Timing is a bitch.\n\nIf you bought anything in March you would be up 50%.\n\nAnd you may be a lybril but I doubt many here would say you are stoop.\n\nBeen holding that one off and on over the last 5-6 years or so. I bailed out of it into bonds in late 07 as it looked like it was headed over a cliff (and, indeed was), and started back in around mid-May this year. Betwix PRIDX, some luck with F, and the general market rebound, 2009 is shaping up to be a pretty nice year. I'm no market timer, preferring buy and hold with the modifier that if a holding comes more than 10% off a high ... its a strong sell indicator. Only tricky part about that decent loss-stopper is figuring out what to do with the $$ after the sale.\n\nAnyway, I'm sure many others have done better, but I'm not losing any sleep.\n\nSounds like you are way ahead of the game Chuck. Well played. Its too bad buy and hold has been a losing strategy for the past decade. Lots of older folks have been destroyed because the game changed and nobody told them.\n\nBack in March I mostly bought solar stocks with the little bit of cash in my IRA. Some have done great like CSIQ and STP, some have been ok like CSUN and some have sucked like AKNS.\n\nI am still worried that the dollar is going to force our hand as far as interest rates go. Raising rates now would really hurt the real estate market, stock market etc.\n\nThere is a fed meeting in Nov and one in Dec. I bet we raise rates during the Dec meeting. Of course they are basically 0 right now so its not so hard to predict they are going up, the when is the big thing.\n\nI am sort of rethinking this one, the US probably wants to devalue the dollar so we can pay our debts and keeping interest rates low is a good way. But just like all things in finance there are two sides to the coin and it will make borrowing harder and we need to finance 2 trillion per year for at least the next couple of years."
