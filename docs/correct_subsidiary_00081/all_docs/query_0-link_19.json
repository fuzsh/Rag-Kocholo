It’s worth keeping track of the difference. Scholars \"encourage us to see misinformation more as a symptom than as a disease. Unless we address issues of polarization and institutional trust, they say, we’ll make little headway against an endless supply of alluring fabrications.\"\n\n• How to Talk to Your Facebook Friends about Fake News (Brooke Borel, The Open Notebook, 2-21-17) How to \"have a healthy dialogue without fighting—talking to each other instead of arguing and being enemies.” When we see fake news on social media, our first instinct may be to correct it. But \"when someone shares a piece of political fake news, it is an act of confirmation bias, an attempt to buttress their existing point of view\" and fact-checking goes to the core of their identity. Websites that peddle fake news have tapped into that \"sense of identity, whether intentionally or not, by using dramatic headlines and inflammatory language that appeal to emotions....Try to figure out why a friend is sharing a particular piece of fake news—what narrative does it support in their overall worldview?...Keep in mind that “People don’t like to be proven wrong in a public environment.\"\n\n• Conservatives Sue, Investigate Disinformation Researchers (Ryan Quinn, Inside Higher Ed, 6-23-23) A co-director of a COVID-19-vaccine skeptics’ group and the founder of the Gateway Pundit conservative website filed a federal lawsuit filed last month alleging that university disinformation and misinformation researchers colluded with the federal government and social media companies to “censor” Americans’ speech. They’re represented by lawyers from, among other firms, America First Legal. Former Trump administration officials, including former senior adviser Stephen Miller, lead this nonprofit, which opposes the “radical left.”\n\n“This case challenges probably the largest mass-surveillance and mass-censorship program in American history—the so-called ‘Election Integrity Partnership’ [EIP] and ‘Virality Project,’” their nearly 90-page complaint begins. “Four entities—Stanford Internet Observatory, University of Washington’s Center for an Informed Public, Graphika and the Atlantic Council’s Digital Forensic Lab—collaborate closely with federal, state and local government officials to monitor and censor disfavored viewpoints on social media.” [that is] to target and suppress speech on the basis of content (i.e., COVID vaccine-related speech) and viewpoint (i.e., speech raising doubt or concern about COVID vaccines’ safety and efficacy and the extent and severity of side effects),” that third suit says. The Stanford Internet Observatory is a \"cross-disciplinary program of research, teaching and policy engagement for the study of abuse in current information technologies, with a focus on social media.\"\n\n\"In March, Starbird and other co-founders of the University of Washington’s Center for an Informed Public released a lengthy rebuttal to several “false impressions” they identified about the Election Integrity Partnership. “At the core of most of the false impressions of our work is a rhetorical argument that seeks to equate efforts to understand and counter false and misleading information with ‘censorship,’” they wrote. “This argument has increasingly been employed against social media moderation efforts—as though these companies do not routinely act to limit spam, pornography, harassment, impersonation and other harmful content on their networks.\"\n\n[Back to Top]\n\n• Combating Disinformation Wanes at Social Media Giants (Steven Lee Myers and Nico Grant, NY Times, 2-14-23) As the companies have shed jobs recently, many teams assigned to combat false and misleading information have taken a hit.

What happened in Boston in 1834 would resurface in 1920s, with the Ku Klux Klan’s willingness to use violence to defend against fictitious assaults on Protestant women’s “purity” by Catholics and Jews, and again in the ’80s during the Satanic panic, when children were coerced into accusing day-care employees and even their own parents of ritualistic abuse and murder. Contemporary conspiracy theories about Clinton’s murderous sex cabal may sound outlandish, but it’s only the latest page in a playbook that is more than 200 years old. If we remember this, perhaps we can rob the next panic of its heat and fury.\"\n\nSee also Colin Dickey's book Under the Eye of Power: How Fear of Secret Societies Shapes American Democracy and listen to him discuss his book on WAMU's 1a program: America’s unfaltering obsession with secret societies and conspiracy theories (NPR, 7-17-23) The first line of his book: “The United States was born in paranoia.”\n\n• Why is Elon Musk’s Twitter takeover increasing hate speech? (Rashawn Ray and Joy Anyanwu, Brookings, 11-23-22) \"Twitter saw a nearly 500% increase in use of the N-word in the 12-hour window immediately following the shift of ownership to Musk. Within the following week, tweets including the word “Jew” had increased fivefold since before the ownership transfer. Tweets with the most engagement were overly antisemitic. Likewise, there has also been an uptick in misogynistic and transphobic language.\n\n\"Even if this hateful conduct is coming from a small number of troll accounts, this phenomenon speaks to how fringe, alt-right networks not only feel empowered by Musk’s takeover, but protected as well. Shortly after the acquisition, Musk laid off almost 50% of Twitter employees....As a result, the team that was previously in place to monitor and censure hate speech is no longer at Twitter....As Musk is now the primary owner of the platform, he may follow through with loosening standards of harmful content and dissolving the so-called censorship he has criticized in the past.\"\n\n• Getting Wise to Fake News (Paula Span, NY Times, 9-11-20) Older adults are particularly vulnerable to misinformation on social media.

Online, we’re connected with our communities, and we seek approval from our like-minded peers. We bond with our team by yelling at the fans of the other one.” In an ecosystem where that sense of identity conflict is all-consuming, she wrote, “belonging is stronger than facts.”\n\n\"President Trump might have left office, and you can always switch off Facebook, but rumors and falsehoods will be defining features of American life for some time.\"\n\n• The Future of Truth and Misinformation Online (Janna Anderson and Lee Rainie, Pew Research Center) \"Experts are evenly split on whether the coming decade will see a reduction in false and misleading narratives online.
