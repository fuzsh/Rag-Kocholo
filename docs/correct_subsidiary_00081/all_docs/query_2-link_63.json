        "text": "Wikimedia proposes \"Legal Fees Assistance Program\" for Wikipedia, etc support role\n\nI hope I'm not drummed out of the Wikipedia Critics Guild for this post, but it's worth noting there's a hopeful proposal from the Wikimedia Foundation (the nonprofit which owns Wikipedia and various other projects) for a \"Legal Fees Assistance Program\"\n\nThe Legal Fees Assistance Program of the Wikimedia Foundation (WMF) has been established to help secure funds for legal assistance in appropriate cases for Wikimedia users who serve in a community administrator, arbitrator, email response, or project governance role that is specified in this document. ... [It] is intended to help with the costs of a legal defense arising from a support role in the unlikely event that a user should face legal action for their actions in such a role.\n\nI should note this specific program is not about content, which is a different policy.\n\nOne of my deeper criticisms of the exploitative nature of Wikipedia, and why I don't believe it's a good model for anything much except taking advantage of relatively powerless people, is the way it engages in the practice \"risk-shifting\". For example, where low-level volunteers bear the legal risks and costs of legally problematic actions. The con-men who push wonderful stories about self-emergent collective-mind free work, typically never mention that lawsuits can get directed towards real people, not technomystic concepts. This problem is made much worse by the ability of some organizations to disclaim liability and push it onto the unpaid labor.\n\nKudos to whoever at the Wikimedia Foundation took steps to address this issue. It would be a great use of resources.\n\nThat being said, I have some unfortunate worries which I'll phrase as follows: I hope that what sounds so much like a program which would defend the rank-and-file against abuse of power, doesn't get corrupted into stealth lobbying for Google or similar in legal fights about copyright. Basically, misused as another way to channel Wikipedia prominence and reputation into the service of corporate interests. Again, I don't contend that's what the proposers have in mind, and I'm not claiming this is intended as any sort of propaganda effort. But there's many forces who do want to use Wikimedia as a corporate front. And sadly I could see a way it might happen here. Maybe it's dour to bring that up that possibility for such a praiseworthy proposal. But I've seen too much bad net.politics to be unreservedly optimistic.\n\nPosted by Seth Finkelstein at 11:59 PM\n\nWikipedia Is(n't?) For Porn - or, Being A Cult Leader Is Difficult\n\nWikipedia co-Founder Larry Sanger has generated some attention from a post What should we do about Wikipedia's porn problem?. Given that it's been echoed by a couple of A-listers (who have around three orders of magnitude more audience than me), plus mega-gatekeeper sites, I don't feel that I'm going to be doing any harm in adding a few of my squeaks from the bottom of power-law mountain.\n\nNow, as I mentioned in my own post a while back about Wikimedia/Wikipedia Image Filter \"referendum\" results, \"Between ankle-biting wikicultists on one side, and wiki-porn-porn-porn complainers waving bloody heads on the other\", other writers can argue the censorship-related issues. I've been there, done that, and got the suffering for it. I'm intrigued by the way various pro and anti Wikipedia factions react (which is not something that's been argued endlessly).\n\nNote there's many topics which get mixed in these discussion. There's legal sexual material but not appropriate for little children, material where let's say one should think very carefully about obscenity and child pornography law, and some extremely dark corners of Wikimedia-world that I remain amazed have not resulted in a major scandal (yet). All of it, however, is a public-relations problem. And that hits the Wikimedia Foundation (owner of Wikipedia and related sites) like nothing else.\n\nIn another post about Wikipedia's other co-founder Jimmy Wales's reaction, Sanger states \"I found it implausible that the God King could do nothing\". However, this is closer to truth than is apparent at first glance. There's no hucksters interested in hyping the following formulation, but being a cult leader is in fact pure democracy. Any follower can leave at any time, at least to as good an approximation as many other things which get called \"democracy\". If a large, vocal base, having some of the organization's most fanatical followers, wants to do something which is embarrassing to the Dear Leader, then Dear Leader has a problem. Getting into a costly battle with the base is bad politics, even for the most absolute of monarchs.\n\nAnd the last time he did try to take on the base over this topic, they actually started revolting. It was very revealing as to the dynamics. When I talk about how Wikipedia is a cult, too many people seem to take that as if it were a cartoonish statement of zombies being ruled by a puppet-master. It's not like a bad genre story. A cult leader only remains in that position by fulfilling the emotional needs of the acolytes. Go against those feelings, and there's trouble. Alternatively, no king wants to massacre a bunch of farmers over bad PR, even content-farmers.\n\nI have no idea how it's all going to shake out. I'll just end with what I've said before:\n\nHave fun, Wikimedia Foundation folks. I don't envy you. Running a cult is not all PR puff-pieces and back-scratching among elites. Sometimes you have to actually deal with the uncomfortable fact that the \"community\" isn't completely dedicated to doing unpaid work exactly as you desire.\n\nPosted by Seth Finkelstein at 11:59 PM | Comments (1)\n\nResolutions, SOPA, Wikipedia blackout, Google, etc. essay\n\n[Note this post is deliberately written in \"personal voice\", as it's more aimed at my vast dozens of readers, rather than expecting to have any significant effect]\n\nI had intended to do a New Year's Resolutions post about planned site updates and eventually finally shuttering the blog, but I decided it was all just too much of a rehash to be worth the bits wasted (which fits the theme of worthless resolutions). However, the upcoming \"Wikipedia Blackout\" gave me an inspiration for weaving it all into at least a current event commentary.\n\nFor those unfamiliar with the term \"SOPA\", it's a proposed law involving extensive new powers for copyright enforcement. Potential aspects (specific details vary depending on versions) include domain-name seizures, payment-processing and advertiser blockades, blacklisting in the mechanism that actually locates sites on the Internet (DNS), mandating removals from search engines, changes regarding how sites deal with infringement, and more. This is all very scary from a civil-libertarian and open Internet point of view. And I oppose it. But there's no point in my campaigning personally. Most readers in my audience are already against it, and I doubt those who are for it will change their minds. The expected return is near-zero gain from the civil-liberties side, versus soft-on-infringement from the copyright-maximalist side. Besides, many on both sides get paid for this, I don't. Or, I don't want to do free lobbying for Google:\n\nSince Leahy proposed similar legislation in late 2010, Google has been the most high-profile corporate opponent of the anti-piracy legislation. The company's business model depends on an open Internet, and some of its top properties, particularly YouTube, have long been targets for Hollywood and TV moguls.\n\nHaving a corporate ally is a clear boost for libraries, free speech advocates and open-Internet nonprofits, who don't have the lobbying might Google has.\n\nWhich brings us to the upcoming \"Wikipedia blackout\" in protest of SOPA. This has been an unprecedented politicization of the Wikipedia site itself, putting it to use as a tool for political advocacy. One of the things which interests me about Wikipedia (and I truly find it fascinating, which is not the same as regarding it positively) is that it's large enough to be a factor in real-world disputes, but small enough so that various factional politics are observable, and often even visible in terms of maneuvering.\n\nThe Wikimedia Foundation and co-founder Jimmy Wales clearly wanted to use Wikipedia as a lobbying tool here. That was blatantly obvious to anyone who knows how Wikipedia works. Most simply, if they didn't want to do it, Wales would have sanctimoniously intoned how Wikipedia must remain neutral, and that would be that. Instead, they engaged in a classic \"Manufacture of Consent\", which could have come right out of a political science study (which I wish someone would do). Essentially, the community was fed scaremongering about how Wikipedia was in (my phrase) mortal peril, and so the use of the Wikipedia site itself in this copyright law fight would be justified. I'm not going to detail all the machinations that went on, since I doubt anyone reading cares. But it was another increment of cynicism for me, to see the Foundation people's extensive \"suggestions\". And when those in charge of handing out goodies like jobs and fellowships (which doesn't have to be stated outright) want a certain outcome, that's a fist, not thumb, on the scales. But, of course, at the end it was a \"community decision\", like say a country's decision to go to war.\n\nAnyway, watching this, I made a few stabs at participating and correcting misinformation (Wikipedia is NOT in mortal peril). But I kept asking myself \"Do I really want to get into a big fight with the Wikimedia Foundation and Wales where ultimately this is a proposed law which I oppose???\" (haven't I learned my lesson?). It was another iteration of \"Do the ends justify the means?\", and more specifically, is it worth all the inevitable personal attacks to oppose bad means being used by others? Other writers, with far bigger platforms, and the ability to defend themselves, can say what needs to be said.\n\nAnd that leads back to uselessness of blogging, at least for the Z-lister. In every item above (fighting SOPA, opposing Wikimedia politicization, defending myself from attacks), the net result seems that blogging is going to get me more negative than positive. Maybe I've said that too many times, which recursively should be a lesson in itself.\n\nPosted by Seth Finkelstein at 03:11 AM | Comments (1)\n\n\"The Closed, Unfriendly World Of Wikipedia\" and anti-expert sentiment\n\nDanny Sullivan, search expert, details his journey through \"The Closed, Unfriendly World Of Wikipedia\". Skipping the details of his attempt to navigate the maze, he finally ends up being cheesed:\n\nBottom line - I've gotten no indication that anyone at Wikipedia actually cares what a subject expert has to say on, well, a subject they're an expert in. Instead, you drown in a morass of bureaucracy. ...\n\nAnd when I read this, I thought, right, Danny, they don't (care). That is, this is another example of what Lore Sj�berg wrote about in his classic funny-because-it's-true Wikipedia FAQK:\n\nBut why should I contribute to an article? I'm no expert.\n\nThat's fine. The Wikipedia philosophy can be summed up thusly: \"Experts are scum.\" For some reason people who spend 40 years learning everything they can about, say, the Peloponnesian War -- and indeed, advancing the body of human knowledge -- get all pissy when their contributions are edited away by Randy in Boise who heard somewhere that sword-wielding skeletons were involved. And they get downright irate when asked politely to engage in discourse with Randy until the sword-skeleton theory can be incorporated into the article without passing judgment.\n\nThere's a strange strain of anti-expert sentiment that runs through Wikipedia, and I see experts run into it again and again. It's not simple to articulate this aspect, since Wikipedia presents itself as a project to collect knowledge. That's usually where the PR fluff ends thought on the topic. But underneath, there's some very troubling social undercurrents.\n\nSo when Danny Sullivan writes:\n\nI am a subject expert in the field of search marketing. A notable one - after all, Wikipedia says so. But my type of first-hand assertion isn't enough. Wikipedia would rather find third-party mainstream media resources that quote people, as if that is somehow better than first-party information.\n\nThat's exactly right - \"that is somehow better\". Because first-party information is based in expert authority, while third-party mainstream media represents a kind of institutional approval. Some Wikipedia editors will actually agree with and justify this, from a rules-based perspective.\n\nThe subsequent debate has some fascinating elements going around a question of the proper context, of whose authority should be respected. Subject experts generally expect to be treated with with some respect, as being high ranking members in the hierarchy of the topic. This does not mean unquestioned deference (though some do want that), which is an easy strawman. But, generally, within their area, they are regarded as having a social status outranking nearly everyone else. So when they go to Wikipedia, they're thinking the Wikipedia \"editors\" are, well, editors, who have the job of working with the experts to polish and publish the expert's work. However, the Wikipedia \"editors\" are convinced that the Wikipedia hierarchy is what matters, and they (the Wikipedia unpaid \"staff\") are really the high status members, to whom the newbie contributor should behave with appropriate status respect. The attitude is roughly that if the expert wants their contribution to be accepted by Wikipedia, it's up to the expert to learn the rules of the game and start playing it. And maybe someday, with the right political skills, clique alliances, and of course a huge amount of time and effort, that expert could hope rise to as exalted a ranking level as the Wikipedia editor.\n\nThis leads to the experts leaving in disgust, and the Wikipedia editors saying don't let the huge article count hit you on the way out.\n\nAnd this is a reason I'm not on the Wikipedia bandwagon. But there's not much of an audience or support for this sort of analysis.\n\nPosted by Seth Finkelstein at 06:56 PM\n\nWikimedia/Wikipedia Image Filter \"referendum\" results\n\nThere's been a so-called Wikimedia/Wikipedia Image Filter \"referendum\" with results announced now (The Wikimedia Foundation owns Wikipedia and other projects, such as their \"Commons\" image repository). Much \"discussion\". \"So-called\", as it wasn't really a referendum. It was obviously intended as more of a rubber-stamp for what the Wikimedia higher-ups have decided to do anyway about an ongoing problem with \"controversial\" images (they said it, not me: \"The Board of Trustees has directed the Wikimedia Foundation to develop and implement a personal image hiding feature ... The feature will be developed for, and implemented on, all projects.\"). The little people got to \"vote\" on advice for the developers! (\"To aid the developers in making those trade-offs ...\").\n\nI keep telling myself stay out, stay out, stay out, as no good will come from any commentary I make. I have very bad memories of hurting my life from censorware activism. Between ankle-biting wikicultists on one side, and wiki-porn-porn-porn complainers waving bloody heads on the other, I can lose from both ends (i.e. Wikipedia fanatics have incentives in social approval for attacking me just on general principles because I'm a critic, while being insufficiently moralistic is never an easy pundit position). But I don't intend to argue the censorship-related issues. Other writers can do that. This post is about the incredible circus around the event.\n\nOne reason Wikipedia truly fascinates me is that, contrary to very deliberate public relations, \"Inside, Wikipedia is more like a sweatshop than Santa's workshop\". There's distilled group dysfunction on display. And since so much of the interaction is documented (not everything, but a large amount), one can see all the factors much more visibly than elsewhere. Here, one can trace the various political forces at work.\n\nThe powers-that-be find sexual material controversies to be embarrassing. They're very clear about the thinking involved, for example regarding some images \"in various categories and sub-categories around\" \"Female toplessness\" and \"Nude women\":\n\nThirdly, it is our belief that the presence of these out of scope images in Commons is potentially dangerous for the Foundation and Community because they reduce the overall credibility of the projects as responsible educational endeavors, and thus call into question the legitimacy of the many images of sexual content and \"controversial\" sexual content that must remain on Commons for the projects to fulfill their mission. And, although not our primary motivation in making this recommendation, it must be noted that they are offensive to many people, men and women alike, and represent with their inclusion a very clear bias, and point of view � that of woman as sexual object. They are far from neutral. We would never allow this point of view untrammeled and unreflexive presence on any Wikipedia site as a clear violation of NPOV � we should not allow it on Commons either.\n\nTo put it mildly, this runs into conflict with prominent sentiments among a major demographics of wiki editors, single young men. I don't think I need belabor the obvious differences of opinion involved.\n\nSo, what to do with when there's outside social pressure but you don't want to alienate a major source of free labor? It's time to start contortions about \"filtering\". This was a censorware argument I'd seen many times before, and it went down the same path.\n\nHave fun, Wikimedia Foundation folks. I don't envy you. Running a cult is not all PR puff-pieces and back-scratching among elites. Sometimes you have to actually deal with the uncomfortable fact that the \"community\" isn't completely dedicated to doing unpaid work exactly as you desire.\n\nPosted by Seth Finkelstein at 02:40 AM | Comments (2)\n\nWikipedia-Bombing Rick Santorum \"(neologism)\"\n\nThe [Rick] \"Santorum_(neologism)\" Wikipedia article (n.b. - not safe for work!) is currently a battleground of, well, I'll let a very high-status Wikipedia editor describe the situation:\n\nStatement by Coren\n\nWe have, I think, a novel problem.\n\nWikipedia is being willfully used as a weapon for political activism against a specific person: there is a concerted effort to manipulate and misuse our policies into giving exposition to a political campaign against an American politician. ...\n\nTo give the essentials, there's been a successful Google-bombing campaign to associate \"Rick Santorum\" with some disgusting material, which then has effectively created a secondary \"Wikipedia-bombing\" campaign via documenting the first campaign. Thus, a search gets at first the Google-bomb site, and then a Wikipedia-bomb via an article talking about the attacks.\n\nThis is a classic situation every media outlet faces of how to cover political stunts, and the difficulties of possibly contributing to problematic actions by giving attention to the sensational. Wikipedia, by virtue of the Google power it has, can drive issues to high-ranking Google placement. And scarily, this power is in the hands of too many people who have difficulty even with the very concept of the problem.\n\nAs put in one Wikipedia mail-listing message\n\nWhat the article *does* is smear a human being. The fact that our rules don't consider it to be a POV violation as long as as the article doesn't state a position is a loophole in the rules.\n\nYou can't neutrally discuss how a person is compared to shit. Not in any real-world sense.\n\nI should disclaim that I find Rick Santorum's political positions to be reprehensible, and I sympathize with the feelings behind the actions against him. But, in reply to the obvious more-activist-than-thou point of how one can be concerned over these Google and Wikipedia reactions, rather what prompts them from Santorum's stances, there's something very worrying going on here. Today it's Rick Santorum ... tomorrow, who knows? And I suspect that right-wingers are going to eventually be able to play that game far better than left-wingers.\n\nPosted by Seth Finkelstein at 08:32 PM\n\nCall For Crowd-Sourcing - Wikipedia Song Parody \"Junk Food Junkie\"\n\nOne of FAQ's (Frequently Asserted Querulousness) about Wikipedia criticism is charging some sort of hypocrisy when Wikipedia critics have been known to read Wikipedia. This has always seemed to me a kind of cheap \"gotcha\" strawman. I don't know any critic who thinks that reading Wikipedia will cause someone to go insane, like an Internet version of H.P. Lovecraft's Necronomicon (working on Wikipedia may indeed drive you mad, but that's another topic).\n\nAfter yet another discussion going around this, it struck me that it was analogous to when a nutrition advocate eats junk-food. Now, a person's claim about what's healthy may be right or wrong. And if they said anyone who ate junk-food was a horrible person who was doomed to a heart-attack immediately, one might legitimately call that hypocritical. All of which put me in mind of an old humor song \"Junk Food Junkie\".\n\nIt's about someone who's a public health-food promotor, yet enjoys eating junk-food in private:\n\nYeah, in the daytime I'm Mr. Natural\n\nJust as healthy as I can be\n\nBut at night I'm a junk food junkie\n\nGood lord have pity on me\n\nWhich suggested to me something along the lines of:\n\nOh, in the daytime I'm The Professor\n\nJust as scholarly as I can be\n\nBut at night I'm a Wikipedia reader\n\nGood lord have pity on me\n\nThat is, parody the above \"gotcha\" argument, as an academic who considers reading Wikipedia to be a secret shame. So from\n\nAh, but when that clock strikes midnight\n\nAnd I'm all by myself\n\nI work that combination\n\nOn my secret hideaway shelf\n\nAnd I pull out some Fritos corn chips\n\nDr. Pepper and an Ole Moon Pie\n\nThen I sit back in glorious expectation\n\nOf a genuine junk food high\n\nTo\n\nYet, but when that clock strikes midnight\n\nAnd I check there's no risk\n\nI type in the password\n\nOf my hidden encrypted disk\n\nAnd pop up wikipornography\n\nAnime and Star Trek too\n\nThen I click round in glorious expectation\n\nOf a popular culture zoo\n\nI'm not going to claim I'm particularly good at this, especially given all the references that can go into good parody. Rather, I will be true the wiki way, which is to have others do work for you. Thus, anyone who is an expert is invited to do it, because it's a valuable civic task that needs to be done.\n\n[Disclaimer: Kidding around is one thing, but no libel/defamation, please.]\n\nPosted by Seth Finkelstein at 11:59 PM | Comments (3)\n\nWikipedia Is Down, And I Feel Fine\n\nWikipedia is down.

Sadly, the reporting of it is turning into a game of journalistic \"telephone\".\n\nImportant, co-founder Jimmy Wales did not \"resign\" overall. He did voluntarily give up some special technical editing status he had (in the face of some very strong pressure to have that status stripped from him for using it in a pre-emptive way which garnered widespread disapproval). Basically, in Unix terms, he resigned his super-user/\"root\" bit on the servers. It's not clear if this is more than symbolic, if he can politically restore that status once the attention dies down. It is certainly embarrassing for him.\n\nSince I'm often a critic of Wikipedia, I'll point to a public message by the former Chair of the Wikimedia Foundation:\n\nhttp://lists.wikimedia.org/pipermail/foundation-l/2010-May/058020.html\n\n\"Jimmy [Wales]'s is behaving like a vandal and breaking the very notion of our \"power in the hands of the community\"\"\n\nI'd say \"chaos\" is the wrong word - \"intense factional infighting\" would be more accurate (though when it comes to running Wikipedia, what else is new?). Although there are many interrelated topics, the gist of the dispute is how to handle some sexual material on Wikimedia Commons, a hosting resource (not Wikipedia _per se_), which is, let us put it, of less than obvious immediate educational value, in the face of _Fox News_ making an issue of it. Civil-libertarians will be familiar with such disputes.\n\nThe best single message I've found is this one, from a current Wikimedia Foundation board member:\n\nhttp://lists.wikimedia.org/pipermail/foundation-l/2010-May/058301.html\n\n\"And I am firmly against reducing the content on Wikimedia to only that which is acceptable for children. The world's knowledge contains a lot of things that are shocking, divisive, offensive, or horrific, and people should be able to learn about them, and to educate others. Not including these things doesn't make them go away--it only makes it more difficult for interested people to learn from a source that tries to be neutral and educational. I don't think Wikipedia will ever be (or should ever be) \"safe\", for the same reason your public library will never be, either.\"\n\nDisclaimer/plug - see the column I wrote for the _Guardian_ more than an year ago when a different Wikipedia pornography controversy was in the news:\n\nhttp://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2008/dec/18/wikipedia-jimmy-wales\n\n\"The combination of moral-panic-mongers willing to practice a politics of personal destruction and the ability to anonymously advocate for one's favorite fetish on one of the world's most widely read websites leads to constant low-intensity conflict. Wikipedia trades off quality control for greater production. That same design flaw is manifested in extremely weak and failure-prone mechanisms for determining the boundary between provocative and profane.\"\n\nPosted by Seth Finkelstein at 11:04 PM | Comments (2)\n\nWikimedia Foundation Form 990 for 2010 - no riches in nonprofit salaries\n\nThe Wikimedia Foundation Form 990 (fiscal year 2009) has been made available. I seem to be one of the few people who reads these things, so perhaps a blog post about it won't be completely redundant. As I explained in my post last year about \"Wikimedia Foundation Form 990, Jimmy Wales Speaking Fee $75,000+ (\"salary\")\":\n\nFor people unfamiliar with this, a \"form 990\" is an IRS disclosure form required for charities. And it's often full of interesting financial information. Definitely worth a look if you're interested in the internal workings of an organization. Particular in terms of what people are paid.\n\nWe finally get to find out what Sue Gardner, Executive Director, receives for being ringmaster of the wiki-circus: $150,000 base salary, $6,350 benefits, and $18,700 of what looks to be a one-time housing relocation expense.\n\nThat's decent money in general in the midst of a recession, but in a relative sense, it strikes me as quite reasonable for the position, especially in Silicon Valley. The salaries of any technical people aren't given this time, per their FAQ \"The requirements for inclusion on this schedule are more specific than in prior years. [requirements then specified]\". But it can't be all that much, given those requirements.\n\nIt does point out again, though, that there just isn't a whole lot of money in the nonprofit per se. Apparently the way to (try to) get rich is using Wikipedia for publicity, to promote oneself for lecture fees, or a venture-capital funded start-up.\n\nPosted by Seth Finkelstein at 04:19 PM\n\nMore On Wikipedia blackout of David Rohde kidnapping\n\nA few days ago, the radio program \"On The Media\" ran a segment on the David Rohde kidnapping and Wikipeda's suppression of information: \"The Silent Treatment\"\n\nConsider this statement:\n\nJIMMY WALES: No, it's not one that we had encountered in quite this way before, but because The New York Times was very successful in having their media blackout, it was pretty easy for our volunteers to look at it and say, well, really under the rules of Wikipedia we've never considered ourselves a wide open free speech forum where people can post speculative things. We just look at it and we say, well yes, there was one report here and a couple of blogs, but really it's not being reported anywhere else, so who knows.\n\nNow, of course, I knew that it was true because The New York Times contacted me to ask what could be done about it, but it's not my obligation to report everything I know, just as it wouldn't be for anybody.\n\nNote the first edit to add the information about David Rohde's kidnapping sourced it to an Afghan news report.\n\nCompare the following message on a Wikipedia discussion list:\n\n... When we want to protect a non-reporter, we are told that since Wikipedia is just republishing information that is already out there and causing damage anyway, the person will probably have been hurt just as much without the Wikipedia article. And of course, Wikipedia is not censored, and that the five pillars of Wikipedia require the free flow of information and can never be compromised.\n\nCertainly, someone who tried to suppress information in the same way, but was not Jimmy Wales or otherwise important on Wikipedia, even if they did it to save a life, would be accused of edit warring, told that they are abusing the rules, and taken to Arbcom and banned. Of course, in the process they would be told that their idea that they are saving a life is speculative and can't be proven. If one such person were to justify their actions by claiming that terrorists can't use the Internet well, we would reply \"nice idea, but you really have no proof for that. You're just speculating. You don't know that that's true. Now stop the edit warring and the rules abuse-- we can certainly prove *that*.\"\n\nWhere you stand depends on where you sit.\n\nPosted by Seth Finkelstein at 11:59 PM | Comments (2)\n\nMy _Guardian_ column on David Rohde kidnapping, and Wikipedia suppression\n\n\"The moral quandary of involving Wikipedia in online 'censorship'\"\n\nhttp://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2009/jul/08/wikipedia-censorship-seth-finkelstein\n\n\"The suppression of news about a reporter's disappearance saw the New York Times and Wikipedia work together � but raises issues about control of information\"\n\nNote this title was written by an editor. I didn't suggest a title of my own. It's not really wrong, but as a title, I'd say it doesn't quite sum up what I was trying to examine in that column. I was attempting to consider a broad moral question, and then use Wikipedia as a worked example because the issues are so visible there (due to all the public arguing which goes on it, and how much internal deliberations tend to get leaked). Not that Wikipedia has any special status - in fact, I was writing against any idea of Wikipedia exceptionalism.\n\nAs I think of it, the column is trying to look at two topics:\n\n1) Why did this hiding of information succeed overall, and what are the implications? (remember, we're constantly told it can't happen - but obviously, gatekeepers remain)\n\n2) Who gets to keep out information, and why?\n\nOf course, there's only so much of this that can be covered in the space available. But that was my attempt at saying something which would be worth reading, amidst all the other punditry on this topic.\n\n[For all columns, see the page Seth Finkelstein | guardian.co.uk.]\n\nPosted by Seth Finkelstein at 03:02 PM | Comments (2)\n\nMy _Guardian_ column on \"Wikipedia Art\" and trademark vs fair use\n\n\"Do commercial pressures outweigh artistic ideals at Wikipedia?\"\n\nhttp://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2009/may/28/read-me-first-wikipedia-art\n\n\"When do commercial pressures affect ideals? Testing that proposition was an unexpected result of the 'Wikipedia Art' project\"\n\nI didn't suggest a title for this one, and the title they used is fine by me. Someone might be pedantic and note it really should be \"at the Wikimedia Foundation\" rather than \"at Wikipedia\", but I'd say that's acceptable shorthand for a headline.\n\nI emailed Jimmy Wales a long set of queries, in part asking him how he could reconcile his statement and accusations with the legal nastygrams sent by the Wikimedia Foundation lawyer. But he never replied to me.\n\nNote to any Wikipedia-defenders: I know the \"Wikipedia Art\" page wasn't acceptable according to Wikipedia rules. My column is about the subsequent trademark-based threat, which had nothing to do with whether that Wikipedia Art page should have been kept or deleted.\n\nNote to net-lawyers: I also know \"fair use\" is a phrase most frequently associated with copyright law. However, there really is trademark \"fair use\", similarly named, which applies in trademark law. That's what was being argued here - it's \"fair use\" to use a trademark to refer to the thing itself as a reference.\n\n[For all columns, see the page Seth Finkelstein | guardian.co.uk.]\n\nPosted by Seth Finkelstein at 08:21 PM | Comments (2)\n\nWikimedia Foundation Form 990, Jimmy Wales Speaking Fee $75,000+ (\"salary\")\n\nThe Wikimedia Foundation Form 990 for their 2008 fiscal year has been posted now. See also their FAQ for details on what's been redacted and why. For people unfamiliar with this, a \"form 990\" is an IRS disclosure form required for charities. And it's often full of interesting financial information. Definitely worth a look if you're interested in the internal workings of an organization. Particular in terms of what people are paid.\n\nIt should be noted that the salaries do not seem to me extravagant at all. For example, the Chief Technical Offer, who is responsible for keeping the servers running overall, is paid $62,473. I've never criticized the technical operations side of Wikipedia, it just seemed like that would be misplaced.\n\nHowever, that information has to be read, well, in context. For example, a recent interview (paywall'ed, so I can't link) of Jimmy Wales contained this exchange:\n\n[Interviewer] Do you draw down a salary from Wikipedia?\n\n[Jimmy Wales] No. I don't get any salary. In fact, I don't even get reimbursed for my expenses. It's my charity work. I'm pretty insistent about that.\n\nThat salary statement is true as far as it goes. One can see that he indeed doesn't get any salary. However, the Jimmy Wales Speaker's Fee is now at: \"FEE CATEGORY: Above 75.0k\" [update 1/2010 - now 50.k - 75.0k]\n\nSomehow, that doesn't feel like \"charity work\" to me. I actually wouldn't mind so much if he said something like \"No, I don't take any money out of the Wikimedia Foundation, since it's a nonprofit, which could pay chump-change anyway. Instead, I fleece executives who have far more money than sense, and are crazy enough to pay me tens of thousands of dollars to spout buzzwords and blather. What do you think, that I'm some sort of silly *altruist*?\" (of course, more elegantly phrased). There would still be a problem of it being built on exploitation. But it's the \"charity work\" part which strikes me as wrong. Nothing which results in one gig paying more than the entire salary of the person in charge of keeping the site running, can fairly be described as \"charity work\".\n\nPosted by Seth Finkelstein at 11:59 PM | Comments (8)\n\nWikimedia Foundation vs Wikipedia Art (wikipediaart.org)\n\nEchoes: EFF - Wikipedia Threatens Artists for Fair Use\n\nCan a noncommercial critical website use the trademark of the entity it critiques in its domain name? Surprisingly, it appears that the usually open-minded folks at Wikipedia think not.\n\n[Snip description]\n\nYep, they used the term \"wikipedia\" in their domain name.\"Wikipedia\" is a trademark owned by the Wikimedia Foundation. And now the Foundation has demanded that the artists give up the domain name peaceably or it will attempt to take it by (legal) force.\n\nWikipedia should know better. There is no trademark or cybersquatting issue here. First, the site is entirely noncommercial, which puts it beyond the reach of U.S. trademark law. (We note that Paul Levy of Public Citizen, who has helped establish key precedents on this issue, has signed on to represent Wikipedia Art). Moreover, even if U.S. trademark laws somehow reached this noncommercial activity, the artists' use of the mark is an obvious fair use. ...\n\nLegal history at Wikipedia Art\n\nI still support the goals of the Wikipedia project, despite my personal disappointment in how they have been handling matters. I find it distressing that their commitment to an open encyclopedia is in stark contrast with their effort to effectively shut down what is clearly an artistic project that asks us to reflect on the Wikipedia system of knowledge production.\n\nLast year, I was a Wikipedia donor. I find it ironic that some small portion of my monetary contribution may be used to pay for their legal counsel in a potential case against me.\n\nMailing-list analysis message excerpt by Wikimedia general counsel (lawyer):\n\nUnsurprisingly, the artists, who enjoyed making a fuss with their initial perfomance-art project, are hoping to make a fuss about our having contacted them at all. We anticipated precisely this reaction, of course, which is why our initial letter to Wikipedia Art, now posted on their website, talks about resolving the matter amicably and asks the artists to respect and understand our concerns. In other words, it's about the gentlest \"demand letter\" one can possibly write. We're pleased it led to positive results (the disclaimer). We always figured they might post our communications with them.\n\nMailing-list comment by Wikimedia (volunteer) United Kingdom PR flack:\n\nThey're performance artists. This is more performance. They fooled the EFF into playing along.\n\nPosted by Seth Finkelstein at 05:35 PM | Comments (2)\n\nLarry Sanger: \"An open letter to Jimmy Wales\"\n\nEcho: Larry Sanger - \"An open letter to Jimmy Wales\" (updates), about Jimmy Wales denying him credit as Wikipedia co-Founder:\n\nI recently read the \"Hot Press\" interview with you. The lies and distortions it contains are, for me, the last straw, especially after this came to light, in which you described yourself as \"co-founder\" in 2002.\n\nStrong stuff, not mincing words:\n\n\"I resent being the victim of another person's self-serving lies.\" ...\n\n\"What angers me is not any one error, but the accumulated weight of your lies about me ...\"\n\nIt was originally posted on Jimmy Wales's personal discussion page on Wikipedia, which of course set off extensive edit-warring on removing and replacing it. But interestingly, that did seem to have some effect. The information was apparently conveyed to some people among a small core group high up in the Wikipedia hierarchy, who otherwise apparently would not have seen it.\n\nNotably, in a mailing-list discussion, Florence Devouard, former Chair of the Board of Trustees of the Wikimedia Foundation (the Wikimedia Foundation is the parent organization of Wikipedia), sent a supportive message\n\nI know it will only be a small satisfaction, but I wanted to mention that in the French speaking user guide book I recently co-wrote with Guillaume Paumier, you are recognised as a co-founder. ...\n\nI have had enough opportunities to see that what the public/journalists say and believe is frequently highly different from the reality and I fear we all have to live with this. For many, Jimmy is still the one doing all the work at the Wikimedia Foundation, and sometimes even the one approving any article before publishing. LOL. ...\n\nIf anyone following my writing didn't know, I've read extensively through the background, and my assessment is that Larry Sanger has the right of it. Truth is not in the middle here. He was regularly termed \"co-founder\" of Wikipedia for several years, even after he left the project, until it appears around the time Jimmy Wales started seriously to commercialize the ideas of Wikipedia. And while it can't be proven absolutely that the commercialization led to a rewrite of history, it's a powerful motive and very suspicious timing.\n\nI'm surprised none of the Usual Suspects covered the issue (not even the gossip site Valleywag, and that's really surprising). And of course, a few posts on blogs simply won't be heard compared to the huge megaphones Jimmy Wales gets for his \"sole founder\" story because of the hype around Wikipedia :-(.\n\nPosted by Seth Finkelstein at 11:59 PM | Comments (4)\n\nA reply to \"Wikipedia criticism, and why it fails to matter\"\n\nVipul Naik wrote a blog post \"Wikipedia criticism, and why it fails to matter\" (and follow-up) where he discussed many critics of Wikipedia, and raised a question:\n\nDoes criticism of Wikipedia serve any purpose (constructive or destructive) other than being an excuse to fill journal columns and blog space (I might note that the critical articles I wrote about Wikipedia have driven the most traffic to my blog)? it is hard to say. I want to argue here that it does not at least serve the obvious purpose of keeping potential readers away from Wikipedia.\n\nFor my reply, let me put it this way:\n\nPart of my motivation has been the delusion that I can make a (small) difference in the world. But I am not nearly so deluded as to think I can significantly keep potential readers away from Wikipedia. Indeed, as I repeatedly try to point out that Wikipedia's success has been driven by an implicit subsidy by Google (implicit meaning there's no deal, no specific arrangement, but rather an effect overall), it logically follows my ability to compete with that is, in practice, nil.\n\nI started critiquing Wikipedia in self-defense, since my biography there was being used as a weapon in a longstanding harassment campaign. And then the more I looked into the real inner workings of Wikipedia, the worse it seemed. I suspect many people don't understand the frame of reference I try to convey, of cults where idealistic unpaid acolytes work themselves to burn-out, while a few people at the top benefit enormously.\n\nBut I have no grandiose views about my readership and influence. At best, I'd aim to affect things like Jonathan Zittrain's use of Wikipedia in his book - i.e. some intellectuals might read me, and as a result the hype would be less extensive, maybe even debunked a little. Realistically, that's the best I can hope for (and I likely won't achieve even that much).\n\nThat is, I'm not trying to change (directly) the number of Wikipedia editors, but rather the Public Intellectual perspective on Wikipedia.\n\nTo me, structurally, Wikipedia embodies many policy trends which I find immoral and destructive - e.g. the shifting of risk and responsibility from institutions onto relatively powerless individuals, while simultaneously shifting personal benefits to a tiny elite. I know, that's not the way we're told (often by PR flacks) to think about it. But how many $50,000 - $100,000 ? - speaker's fee gigs do the article writers get?\n\nPerhaps it's futile to criticize all that. It's certainly not lucrative. Maybe I've made the same mistake that I made during the Great Bubble, of not getting on the gravy train while the getting was good. I suppose it all comes down to the question of which side you're on, and why you're on it.\n\nPosted by Seth Finkelstein at 06:09 AM | Comments (8)\n\nMy _Guardian_ column on Wikipedia Inclusionism vs. Deletionism (vs. Wikia)\n\n\"In the end, it's actually about money\"\n\nhttp://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2009/mar/05/wikipedia-seth\n\n\"One of the perennial debates about Wikipedia is 'inclusionism' v 'deletionism', which revolves around what topics should be covered.\"\n\nThe title isn't mine, but it does capture the ideas. I do hope people grasp that the \"money\" part is meant to be a multilayered observation, connecting the two concepts explored - an examination of the costs that every article creates, and the pressures of commercialization. Not something silly, like a potential strawman of deletionism being a plot to enrich Wikia's digital-sharecropping gains.\n\nI quote with attribution and permission two very active Wikipedia editors being critical of Jimmy Wales. So it'll be interesting to see how that affects the article's perception in Wikipedia cabals, err, circles. I've been derided as a \"media troll\", but I've sourced some of the criticism here to \"insiders\", so maybe that'll matter (or not ...).\n\n[For all columns, see the page Seth Finkelstein | guardian.co.uk.]\n\nPosted by Seth Finkelstein at 04:18 PM | Comments (2)\n\nRoger McNamee (Venture Capitalist) on Wikimedia Advisory Board - THE MONEY\n\nWhen I wrote Roger McNamee, \"Elevation Partners\", and Don't Think Small on Wikipedia, I said:\n\nIt's not about the minor Google-juice that the commercial digital-sharecropping startup company \"Wikia Inc.\" gets from the nonprofit mothership Wikipedia (and that trick doesn't even seem to work anyway). ... It's not about trying to put a $1,300 dinner on a charity's expense account. It's not even about pocketing fat speaking fees, though that must be a nice perk.\n\nLooks at millions of dollars, if you can wrap your mind around that. Anybody who is rainmaking a literal million dollars of donations has an angle where they're going to get comparable value back.\n\nWith the announcement of Roger McNamee appointed to Wikimedia Advisory Board, I re-iterate that point. I severely doubt that the idea is to convert Wikipedia itself to some sort of profit center. That's too risky.\n\nInstead, just speculating, I suspect what's going on here is a continuation of the strategy of digital sharecropping. Note this item in a profile\n\nOne such acquisition was Investopedia, the leading online portal for investment-related research, which Forbes bought in April 2007. Another was Clipmarks, a small company that lets users tag, store, organize, and share snippets of webpages, acquired in November 2007\n\nHaving insidery access to various deals and start-ups is likely the benefit, not direct commercialization of Wikipedia itself.\n\n[Update : Hmm... \"Roger McNamee will act as a special advisor to the Executive Director on business and strategy issues.\" ]\n\nPosted by Seth Finkelstein at 03:04 PM | Comments (4)\n\nOn \"A Personal Appeal From Wikipedia [*CO*]Founder Jimmy Wales\"\n\nThere's a Wikipedia fundraising message which is drawing a bit of critical comment for the implicit self-promotion it contains. The efforts to remove Larry Sanger from history as a Wikipedia co-Founder are an ongoing matter. Worse, it plays into Wikipedia's weakness in that what's widely reported in the press tends to be taken as true, even if it's obviously the result of a PR campaign.\n\nOne could argue the text is not technically inaccurate. But I would also say it's fair to observe how this feeds into the history-rewriting process, and how there's a system of benefit to a small number of the insiders in this supposedly volunteer democratic process. As Wikimedia's UK PR-flack has stated: \"Jimbo applying his rock star factor is one of his most useful jobs for WMF :-)\"\n\nAlso notable is the appeal's statement that:\n\n\"Like a national park or a school, we don't believe advertising should have a place in Wikipedia.\"\n\nAgain, while not inaccurate, it's useful to know that Wales's own attitude towards advertising on Wikipedia in the early days was being quite open to it. And he certainly doesn't have the anti-advertising attitudes that many people think he has (to be fair, it's not all his fault, but he definitely gives certain impressions from which one might easily take a mistaken view).\n\nOne good quote, from 2003:\n\n\"I know that not many people share my curious political views, but to me, it's much worse to seek money from governments, i.e. to ask them to take money by force from others, than it is to accept advertising money.\"\n\nBut the number of people who will read this commentary is a joke compared to the hype-machine.\n\nPosted by Seth Finkelstein at 09:20 PM | Comments (1)\n\nMy _Guardian_ column on Wikipedia, Sex, Scandal, and problematic material\n\nSting in the Scorpions tale is the exposure of Wiki's weakness\n\nhttp://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2008/dec/18/wikipedia-jimmy-wales\n\n\"Anyone who needs to use an old album cover to make a Wikipedia sexual controversy is not trying very hard\"\n\n[I didn't pick the title, though I like it for the wordplay - I would have been more pragmatic myself and gone for more SEO-friendly phrasing]\n\nI didn't do the IWF-is-absurd article, as that's been done extensively.

It's in German, but the gist comes through well in translation. I've made an attempt to clean this up a bit from the automatic translation results, but don't rely on it being absolutely correct:\n\nWhile Jimmy Wales, founder of the site and president of the non-profit organization Wikimedia Foundation cloudy with speeches about democracy, the Internet and the wisdom of the masses, the image of improving the world increased, and somewhere in a squad with Al Gore and Bono the rescue of our future was involved. Other hand, the former stock options trader Wales makes no secret of his views about fundamental capitalism, most recently a whole series of articles about him appeared. His first wife, as reported in the September issue of U.S. magazine W, he discouraged her from becoming a nurse, because he basically nothing altruistic activity held with. The Economist in June attempted to explain Wales' career from his openly expressed admiration for libertarian and radical market thinkers such as Ayn Rand and Friedrich August von Hayek.\n\nAs novelist Ayn Rand [did, says] the blogger and Guardian columnist Seth Finkelstein, the language could also be taken with the Wales people to bring to their work delights to be provided free of charge. ...\n\n[It then summarizes, with credit, many of the points I've made in columns]\n\nI wrote Jonathan Zittrain about a small error in his book's Wikipedia chapter - \"Thus dot-com Web sites like Answers.com mirror all of Wikipedia's content and also display banner ads to make money, something Jimbo Wales has vowed never to do with Wikipedia.\". There's never been any such \"vow\", and the history was quite different from the implications of that sentence.\n\nThat's all not bad, but I'm not sure it's made any sort of dent in all the hype.\n\nPosted by Seth Finkelstein at 09:29 AM\n\nMy _Guardian_ column on Wikipedia, advertising, Jimmy Wales's proselytizing\n\nWikipedia isn't about human potential, whatever Jimmy Wales says\n\nhttp://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2008/sep/25/wikipedia.internet\n\nIt's informative to observe how long Wales has been selling advertising around other people's work\n\nThis is my attempt to debunk some of the mythologizing of the development of Wikipedia, pointing out its initial consideration of being advertising-supported site (i.e. commercial), and examining the very extensive history of Jimmy Wales wanting to commercialize other people's work for private profit.\n\nIt's not any sort of secret.

Cade Metz has done a good job of putting it all in context.\n\nWhat interests me is what I believe it reveals of the dark side of Shiny Happy \"Community\" Sites: \"But his tale bares the flaws of the social web in general - and Wikipedia in particular.\". Since of course these are not physical communities, it is trivially easy to manufacture members. And if you're a seeker of social approval, why not help the process along by having some admiring echoes of yourself? And also a support cadre for those inevitable arguments? There's a limit to this process, as all people aren't stupid, so a chorus of clones is going to be obvious. But that just raises the bar for the cloners (should the pseudonyms argue with each other to throw off suspicion? simulate different interests? protest loudly against allegations, or pretend to co-operate?). So one can get a kind of multiple arms race in terms of balancing factors between creators of multiple-pseudonyms and the targets of the deception.\n\nCall it another experiment in a top laboratory of social pathology.\n\nPosted by Seth Finkelstein at 11:59 PM | Comments (3)\n\nMore on the upcoming \"Ford Hall Forum\" Jimmy Wales talk\n\nI did a bit of journalism today, asking about details of the the \"Jimmy Wales with Christopher Lydon\" Ford Hall Forum Boston event (Thursday Sept 11, 6:30pm-8:00pm). The basics: Wales will speak in the first half for 45 minutes, and the second half will have an additional 45 minutes for comments and questions from the audience. I spoke to Alex Minier, the Executive Director, who was graciously helpful, and quite willing to discuss how the Forum tried to conduct matters. He stated \"We don't filter questions\", though \"we ask for people to be respectful of both the speaker and the other audience members who may have questions.\" Christopher Lydon's role is facilitating the conversation between the audience members and Jimmy Wales.\n\nThe facts having been given, the rest of this post is my opinion and speaking only for myself. While Alex Minier impressed me with his sincerity in wanting to foster debate, I see the situation itself as inevitably yielding nothing but a snow-job sales-pitch from Wales, an infomercial using Wikipedia to hype his commercial start-up Wikia. In opposing such marketing, it's necessary to have both authority and time to dissect an argument, and a hurried questioner has neither. Sure, I could go to the event and try to hone a devastating razor-sharp 30-second sound-bite which would eviscerate the cultish pontifications. But using the minimal effect of several newspaper columns as a yardstick, it doesn't seem like that sound-bite would do any good.\n\nFor example, just conveying the concept that Wikipedia's prominence is very much a quirk of Google's algorithm (and not some mystical embodiment of the human spirit) is already quite complex. And debunking myths of \"crowds\", showing that Wikipedia is more like a set of little fiefdoms ruled by petty warlords, requires significant effort. Plus it's all far less appealing than the fairy tale of the little elves who work for free (and of course, for the right consulting fee, maybe he can get them to do unpaid labor for YOU ...).\n\nPosted by Seth Finkelstein at 08:57 PM | Comments (2)\n\nJimmy Wales \"Ford Hall Forum\" Boston event 9/11 6:30pm\n\nThe Ford Hall Forum has \"Jimmy Wales with Christopher Lydon\" on Thursday, September 11, 6:30pm-8:00pm.\n\nFree Speech, Free Minds, Free Markets:\n\nCompetition and Collaboration\n\nAcross the globe we are building, editing, and contributing to a growing body of knowledge and tools at everyone's fingertips. Volunteers in leaderless organizations contribute to online initiatives and articles. Software developers spend their free time collaborating with complete strangers. Amazingly, these efforts are creating products of extraordinary quality, sometimes better than that of large for-profit organizations. Why do we do it? Why does it work? Join us tonight as Wikipedia founder Jimmy Wales joins journalist Christopher Lydon to address these questions, where \"web 2.0\" will take us next, and how Objectivist philosophy guides his vision.\n\nOne can see, even from the \"Wikipedia founder\" description, that this won't exactly be a critical examination of Wikipedia or digital-sharecropping.\n\nNote Christopher Lydon, a very well-respected Boston media person, has long associations with the overall topic. You can read the comment thread on his 2005 radio show episode about Wikipedia for a sense as to what this event is likely to be. The commenter said it, not me:\n\nI also found it a little out of place that Chris was cheerleading a little for Wikipedia, by way of praising it. It's not like I don't agree that Wikipedia is a great idea; it's just that it's off-putting for the referee of a conversation to also be a participant in that way.\n\nSee also guest Karen Schneider's Wikipedia show post:\n\nLydon seemed disappointed, after the fact, that \"dissers\" of Wikipedia were stronger presences on the radio than Wikipedia leader \"Jimbo\" Wales. Lydon found that the two \"dissers\" had \"weak\" arguments, and then remarked that Wikipedia needed a stronger defender to \"summon up the appropriate awe for so grand an accomplishment.\" I'm glad I didn't know going in that the show's host had so thoroughly drunk the KoolAid on one side of an issue he was covering; I said what I believed, well or not, you decide.\n\nPosted by Seth Finkelstein at 11:59 PM | Comments (2)\n\nGoogle Results Domination by Wikipedia - another study\n\nAnother study about Google's high ranking of Wikipedia articles:\n\n\"Just How Powerful Is Wikipedia?\"\n\nWell, with 70% of the US using Google (and that number is similarly high is many countries around the world) to find information, it would definitely be important if Google was very often sending us to Wikipedia. ....\n\n... we found that an amazing 50.2% of the top 1000 searches had a Wikipedia result on the first page. (That's 502 out of 1000 for the math challenged.) We theorized that many of the \"no\" results likely came from the large number of porn terms on the list, and a cleaner list of family friendly terms might favor Wikipedia even more.\n\nThis overall result is of course not new - but I think it shows one reason why the extensive law / policy marketing of Wikipedia is a cause for concern.\n\nPosted by Seth Finkelstein at 11:59 PM | Comments (2)\n\nWikipedia Is An Attractive Nuisance - Sarah Palin Edition\n\nThey said it, not me:\n\n\"Kelly\"\n\nJimbo, I'd recommend keeping an eye on the Sarah Palin article and the associated talk page.

So where do people turn? To Wikipedia - the so-called \"encyclopedia\" that any axe-grinder can edit-war.\n\nYeah, they should know better. They should, they should, they should.

For example, at the Wikia site Armchair GM, sports fan use a variation of the original wiki software that runs Wikipedia to manage discussions about sports.\n\n[ESPN] Where do you think Wikipedia fits in the broader framework of what's happening in society now with user-driven content?\n\n[JW] I think Wikipedia was just the leading edge of a much broader trend. At Wikia, we are seeing people build out all kinds of collaborative works... \"the rest of the library.\" The biggest category is gaming sites, unbelievably in-depth and accurate how-to manuals for every possible game. More than 70,000 articles about the World of Warcraft. And of course fan sites for tons of different teams, sports, etc.\n\nNote the pattern in those responses (Wikipedia ... Wikia) - how they \"bridge\" from Wikipedia, the nonprofit project to Wikia, the commercial $14million venture-capital funded business with an intrinsic motivation of making investors rich (though profitability is a problem). That is, Wikipedia is presented as some sort of prototype or proof-of-concept for a system where a few digital-sharecropping site owners rake in big bucks from massive unpaid labor. And remember, for anyone tempted to do the tactic of rebuttal via personal attack, I'm not the one who wrote about \"World of Wiki: Potential Advertising Goldmine\" or the plan to \"commercialize the hell out of it\".\n\nPosted by Seth Finkelstein at 11:54 PM | Comments (2)\n\nWikipedia researcher about being right losing to persistence and arguing\n\nThe researcher said it, not me (remember, I'm an idiot who just wants to engage in conspiracy mongering and FUD):\n\nFrom today's SFGate Wikimedia Foundation article, my emphasis:\n\nEd Chi of the Palo Alto Research Center is the creator of WikiDashboard, a social dynamic analysis tool created independently of the foundation that allows readers to analyze all of the edits made by their peers. In October, Chi discovered a huge drop-off in the number of edits, to the point that 1 percent of editors were editing 50 percent of the content. While Wikipedia remains strong in page views and overall ranking, Chi said the waning interest among editors does not bode well for the site or community.\n\n\"The edits have leveled off and remained steady,\" Chi said. \"We don't yet know a reason for the decline, but we suspect it is due not to the wisdom of crowds but to the increased level of conflict among community members. Often it is not the one with the right answer who has their say, but the one who sticks around the longest and is best able to argue his case.\"\n\nWhen one cuts through all the hype, Wikipedia is not very hard to understand. As I say, it's a cult, and the people who win in that sort of system are the people who best play clique-status games. There's sadly too many prominent people who know better, or should know better, who have peddled a mystification so as to profit from that.\n\nUpdate: Welcome, boston.com readers.

If you want to reach a certain demographic this is a great place to do it -- if you don't, then don't waste your money and so that actually works really well for advertisers,\" Wales goes on.\n\nOf course, there are some problems with Wikia's strategy.\n\nNow, note \"I'm not selling Wikipedia\"\n\nIn 2004, he started a for-profit company called Wikia, a community and search engine for wikis. He said that company is valued at US$70 million.\n\nSo remember digital-sharecroppers - it's all about people, it's all about connections, it's all about community - and selling them to advertisers to make a buck (or more than 70 million bucks, supposedly, on paper).\n\nPosted by Seth Finkelstein at 11:39 PM | Comments (2)\n\nWikia and \"GamePro\" Advertising Deal\n\nAs something of a follow-up to my last post on Wikia and digital-sharecropping, I've run across this article: GamePro Strikes Ad, Content Deal With Wikia\n\nby Mark Walsh, Monday, Jul 28, 2008 7:00 AM ET\n\nGamePro Media will exclusively handle ad sales for the gaming section of Wikia, the for-profit Web hosting service started by Wikipedia co-founder Jimmy Wales, under a new marketing partnership announced today.\n\nGamePro will serve display ads across the approximately 500,000 pages of game-related content on Wikia covering a wide range of enthusiast topics from the complex fantasy game \"World of Warcraft\" to Club Penguin. Wikia's game-related inventory accounts for more than 300 million ad impressions a month.\n\nThis connects interestingly with Wikia's recent lust for advertising space. Moreover:\n\nWith the upcoming relaunch of GamePro.com on Aug. 12, the company also plans to feature Wikia Gaming content on the revamped home page. ...\n\nAt the same time, GamePro will also allow Wikia authors to grab content from the site including game screenshots, expert reviews and video available to use within their own wikis, Huseby said\n\nLet's see if I've got this straight. You work for free, and a for-profit magazine might use your material without paying you.

I examine the tensions between so-called \"community\" and commerce, actually breaking (nominally) a story about how some of Wikia's digital sharecroppers are very unhappy with how that company has been treating them. Wikipedia is part of a non-profit foundation, but Wikia is a corporate start-up with $14 million dollars invested in it. And venture capitalists want a return on their investment.\n\nAs others have noted, it's no secret that their overall strategy is to \"commercialize the hell out\" of free labor, via aggressive advertising. And groups like the fans of Transformers are pushing back.\n\nAnd it's not at all clear how it'll all turn out.\n\n[For all columns, see the page Seth Finkelstein | guardian.co.uk.]\n\n[Update: My article seems to have inspired Wikinews to do a story: \"Potential Wikia mass exodus\" (they said it, not me!)]\n\nPosted by Seth Finkelstein at 03:13 PM | Comments (2)\n\nJimmy Wales now making BIG BIG speakers fees, \"Harry Walker Agency\"\n\nSome images are unfortunate:\n\nThe Harry Walker Agency, \"The World's Leading Exclusive Speaker's Agency\", announced exclusive representation of Jimmy Wales for speaking engagements. In an amusing juxtaposition, the front page of their website now has him right above Karl Rove. And that gives you a sense - both intentionally and unintentionally - of the sort of level he's now inhabiting.\n\nThis type of agency charges megabucks for its clients. The exact number for Wales isn't given, but from other material I've seen, I'd estimate $50,000 a shot is a ballpark figure.\n\nAnd what can you get for all that money? (which could probably buy a whole starving village in Africa). I like this:\n\n# Democracy and the Internet\n\nFreedom of speech and the distribution of knowledge is the foundation of Wikipedia. Mr. Wales predicts that the internet will democratize developing countries by making the world 'flat,' opening markets, promoting cultural understanding, and giving developing nations the resources they need to compete in the 21st century. With current total Internet usage by one billion people set to double in the next five to 10 years (with the majority of new users arising from developing nations), Mr. Wales asserts that internet will combat stereotypes, censorship, media control, and monopolies while simultaneously allowing citizens of developing nations to have a more prominent voice. As Mr. Wales states: \"It does not take a lot of technology to foster open dialog and debate. Even the simplest technologies like mailing lists, wikis, blogs can help a lot. What is needed mostly, I think, is more content in local languages, and support from people around the world to help others join in the global conversation.\"\n\nAs the saying goes: The thing speaks for itself.\n\nSo, though Wikipedia is more like a sweatshop than Santa's workshop and has a poorly-run bureaucracy with the group dynamics of a cult fueled by peddling a type of spiritual transcendence through selfless service to an ideal - someone is definitely benefiting.\n\n[Update: Verified asking price: above $75,000]\n\nPosted by Seth Finkelstein at 07:25 AM | Comments (4)\n\nWhat's In Jimmy Wales's Repudiated _Observer_ Article?\n\nThe Observer has a For the record correction:\n\nLast week, we ran an article - 'It's the next billion online who will change the way we think' - under the byline of Jimmy Wales, explaining at the end that it was an edited version of a conversation with the Wikipedia founder. Mr Wales agreed to the piece on the condition that he have final editorial approval but unfortunately this proved impossible before publication. Mr Wales wishes to make clear that he repudiates the piece, and that it misrepresents his views. He has written an alternative version, which can be found at observer.co.uk/commentisfree. We apologise to Mr Wales.\n\nThis made me very curious as to what they'd written for him. Was it such extreme hype that even Wales himself couldn't abide it.? Maybe the bubble-blowing was utterly over-the-top, especially if you know the standard Wikipedia PR about the (knowledge-)starving children of Africa, if even he found it too much. Did it propose that the power of Wikipedia would end poverty, sickness, and war? (note - this paragraph is humor, or at least intended as such)\n\nI've seen a short blog quote \"'If you think the internet has transformed the way we live, the way we work and - crucially - the way we learn about the world, imagine what happens ... when the next billion people come online, as will happen in the next five or 10 years ... What an extraordinary wealth of local knowledge they will bring.\"\n\nThere's also a paraphrase: \"it's likely there'll soon be digital revolutions in far-flung places we don't tend to consider very much, such as Kazakhstan. With internet connections and the Web 2.0 tools that have become available over recent years, [someone writing for] Wales says, it's likely that they'll be able to propel themselves very quickly through twenty years of technological progress and produce the next crop of internet tycoons.\"\n\nBut the article itself apparently never made it online. Has anyone else seen it?

And he will be called Batman. Excuse me while I take my medication. My head doctor calls them my happy pills. I'm a little teapot.....\"\n\nAnd what's even more impressive (in a negative way), is that those attacks seem to have sat there for nine days\n\nTell me again how Wikipedia is almost as accurate as Encyclopedia Britannica.\n\nPosted by Seth Finkelstein at 11:59 PM\n\nTrader: Wikia \"commercialize the hell out\" of Wikipedia success for Jimmy Wales\n\n\"The Jimmy Wales Experience\" was just published in a financial press organ called \"Trader Monthly Magazine\". I find these sorts of articles very interesting, since they have a perspective vastly different from the Kool-Aid doled out for the consumption of the rubes. And note if I said the exact same things as appear here, I'd probably get intensely personally attacked as a negative person. The article requires site registration, so I'll share the best parts. Like this gem:\n\nIn 2004, he launched another Web site, this one called Wikia Inc. (See \"Wikipedia 2.0.\") The company, Wales readily admits, is his effort to take the success -- and, indeed, the underlying philosophy -- of Wikipedia, and commercialize the hell out of it. \"Look, I'm not against making money,\" he says.\n\n[But remember folks, it's all about sharing. It's about the community.]\n\nHe decided that there was no reason he couldn't become the Internet's Michael Dell. In his spare time, he experimented with a handful of Web ventures, like a kid in a young entrepreneurs' club. He started something called Loop Lunch, a site where office workers in downtown Chicago could order food online from local eateries. It flopped.\n\nIn 1998, at the height of the dot-com gold rush, Wales resolved to go for broke. He quit the firm, took his savings and left for California to take part in the boom.\n\n[But he's always been about bringing knowledge to the people.]\n\nWales, meanwhile, has gone on to fame, if not exactly the enormous fortune one typically associates with Internet moguls. But it's not as if he's opposed to rectifying that situation. Early in Wikipedia's life, Wales and his partners considered selling ads on the encyclopedia's pages. The site was showing signs of explosive growth, and they certainly could have used the extra money. Though ultimately they nixed the proposal (Internet ad rates had fallen off anyway, of course), they didn't exactly do so for idealistic reasons. \"We've never said, 'Absolutely not, we don't want to sell ads,'\" Wales says, explaining that the decision had more to do with preserving the Wikipedia brand.\n\nAnd with the advent of his for-profit venture, Wikia Inc., it appears Wales is finally ready to monetize.\n\n[They said it, not me!]\n\n\"Wikipedia 2.0.\":\n\nThe company's business plan maintains that the bulk of its revenue will be generated by...drumroll, please...advertising.\n\n\"The monetizing is pretty straightforward,\" Wales says. \"We don't have any clever, innovative ideas around that.\"\n\nBut even after three years of operation, the site has refrained from selling ad space, content to build critical mass before it goes full-tilt with its sales effort. For now, it's about brand building.\n\nWales's ambitions for Wikia don't stop with online community-building. At the end of 2007, his company launched an alpha version of Wikia Search, with which Wales aims to do battle with Google. ... Instead of search results produced solely by computer programs, the Wikia engine will use its wiki-based communities -- and the actual human beings who participate in them -- to refine its results. The hope is that these people -- the open market -- will edit out the spam and other extraneous junk, producing a series of links that Wales believes will be more relevant to people than what Google generates.\n\n[Saying \"the open market\" sounds so much better than \"the unpaid masses\" (at least Mahalo pays the piece-workers something). But isn't it fun to buy Jimmy Wales a jet?]\n\nPosted by Seth Finkelstein at 04:21 PM | Comments (3)\n\nWikimedia Foundation Form 990 for 2007 posted\n\nThe Wikimedia Foundation Form 990 for fiscal year 2007 is available now. for people who don't know, the \"form 990\" is an IRS disclosure form required for charities. And it's often full of interesting financial information. Definitely worth a look if you're interesting in the internal workings of an organization.\n\nFun facts (money, money, money):\n\nThe compensation of general counsel and interim executive director: $118,500\n\nThe compensation of chief operating officer: $45,914\n\nDirectors, Secretary, Treasurer, Vice-Chair, Chair, positions are uncompensated\n\nThere's $6,000 from Wikia, the commercial start-up company formed by several high-level people involved in Wikipedia (such as Jimmy Wales), but which is not in any way formally or legally a part of the non-profit Wikimedia Foundation charity (but has plenty of informal associations which are an ongoing topic of interest, though I should hasten to add those connections seem to be completely within the letter of the tax laws and do not constitute a \"self-dealing\" violation of IRS regulations). I believe this $6,000 is financial insignificant, and harping on it per se is \"thinking small\". That's not where the big money is to be found.\n\nKudos to the WMF for posting a FAQ addressing some of the obvious issues that arise when reading the form, e.g:\n\nOn page 8, the question is asked \"Are any officers related to each other through family or business relationships?\" Given that several individuals who were on the Board during 06-07 (Jimmy, Angela, and Michael Davis) were also involved with Wikia, how can this answer be no?\n\nAt first glance, it does seem like this question should be answered \"yes.\" However, the IRS provides non-profits with detailed guidelines regarding what it considers a \"business relationship.\"\n\nWhether or not there is a business relationship hinges upon the amount of direct compensation (salary) a person receives, as well as the amount of stock they own. In the case of Jimmy, Angela and Michael, none of them received sufficient compensation, nor owned sufficient stock, to qualify as having a business relationship under the IRS guidelines. Therefore, the question is properly answered no. We have reviewed this issue in detail with Wikia and with our audit firm, and we are satisfied that the question is answered accurately.\n\nI've never considered whether or not that box was checked to be as important as some critics have made it. It's not as if the associations are difficult to find. But in the past, addressing the issue has been far more tedious than it needs to be, perhaps due to a \"bunker mentality\".\n\nPosted by Seth Finkelstein at 08:55 PM | Comments (3)\n\nWikimedia Foundation Community Petition about \"governance\" and \"community\"\n\nWikipedia hype meets harsh reality:\n\nhttp://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Meta:Community_petition (Wikipedia site version) [via Danny Wool]\n\nI'll simply quote it, since it says all that needs to be said:\n\nPetition to the Wikimedia Foundation Board of Trustees:\n\nWe, volunteers, ask the Board to give the volunteer community a fair voice in Foundation governance. During its most recent meeting, the Board of Trustees not only rejected a proposal to improve community input in Foundation matters, but implemented an unexpected restructuring to reduce the community seats on the board. The community was not consulted about this reduction in representation and the board provided no explanation for this change. [1]\n\nThat is not a good way to treat people who donate their time and labor. The volunteer base made this the seventh most popular website in the world. We expect courtesy and respect, but received neither. That hurts morale.\n\nPlease provide a full explanation for recent board decisions and reconsider your top-down approach.\n\nI keep telling the people who donate much of their time to Wikipedia:\n\nDon't ever risk anything for Wikipedia, since it won't risk anything for you. You're fed a line about \"community\" and \"knowledge\", but you're utterly powerless. And when it comes down to a crunch, you're merely unpaid labor with no rights, who can be discarded at a moment's notice.\n\nAnd if you think I'm just a bombastic critic, well, he said it, not me (Brad Patrick, former Wikimedia Foundation general counsel and interim executive director) [via \"Durova\"]\n\nIt would be best for those critical of the Board (and feeling that the community is the most important ideal) to remember that whether you like it or not, agree with it or not, or would have selected an alternative reality or not, it is still the case that the Board is that which governs the Wikimedia Foundation, ... As is oft-repeated, WMF is not a membership organization.\n\nWithin the spirit of civil discourse, to those who are feeling frustrated and demanding action, I submit - \"so what are you going to do about it?\" I suggest you be pragmatic. You do not have any means of grabbing the reins of power from the Board, and you don't have any entitlement to anything except your ability to participate in a project, if you choose, a chapter, if you choose, or to speak up in some forum. You don't have a \"right\" to vote on anything, and the Board could just as easily have a contest than an election to fill Board seats. [... snip]\n\nStop whining and ask yourself if you have the objective qualifications to lead an international organization. If not, work on obtaining the skills to be such a leader, if you choose. Toiling on a project is neither a necessary nor sufficient condition to be a Board member at WMF.\n\nOr, get back to the data-mines, suckers.\n\nThe funniest thing about this is Jimmy Wales has been appointed a special slot that's counted as a \"community\" seat.\n\nPosted by Seth Finkelstein at 11:53 PM | Comments (2)\n\nWikipedia as Google-Weapon\n\nA huge hornet's nest has been stirred up with the posting of some private emails about supposed plans by a group, \"isra-pedia\", to use various tactics on Wikipedia to favor pro-Israel viewpoints in various disputes. There's alleged leaked group mail (the host website is untrustworthy, but Wikipedia administrative discussion provides some evidence that the group mail is authentic). My favorite part:\n\nEvery time you see a Hamas person makes an outragous statements (like Jews came from apes or kill the jews) you write a small article about that peroson (google his name to find more ) and bring the quote from memri.\n\nwhy doing all that ?\n\nbecause google is wikipedia friend - 3 days after you created the article google the person's name again and voila your article will be the #1 in google for that name.\n\nIt's by no means news that Wikipedia's Google rank can be used to go after people. But it's nice to have it stated so bluntly and with such obvious intent.\n\nNow, the plans outlined seems to have been more somebody's idea of a good manipulation scheme than anything which they were able to do. But maybe this is merely amateurs who couldn't pull it off, and got caught.\n\nPosted by Seth Finkelstein at 11:59 PM | Comments (1)\n\nWhen I hear the word \"Wikipedia\", I reach for my flame-thrower\n\nI frequently get negative reactions for writing critically about Wikipedia. I'm not even talking about the Kool-Aid poisoned True Believers, who can't grasp how someone could not love the wonderful wiki-world which has provided them purpose in life. Rather, net-activist friends have suggested my efforts are misdirected. And there's others who argue I'm simply too harsh.\n\nToday I received a promotional postcard for Jonathan Zittrain's new book The Future of the Internet - And How to Stop It. This was obviously a targeted marketing mailing from the publisher (from the format of my address). I've in fact been thinking about the ideas for a while.\n\nThe postcard has three people blurbing the book. The first is a very high status law professor. The third is the \"Executive Chairman and Founder of the World Economic Forum\". And the second is ... \"Jimbo Wales, Founder, Wikipedia\" (not CO-founder, Wikipedia), who says:\n\nJonathan Zittrain does what no one has before -- he eloquently and subtly pinpoints the magic that makes Wikipedia, and the Internet as a whole, work. The best way to save the Internet is to turn off your laptop until you've read this book.\n\nThis sort of hype is why I think the cult of Wikipedia needs some deprogrammers. The \"magic that makes Wikipedia\" strikes me as more like a sweatshop than Santa's workshop. To me, it represents much that's wrong with the future of the Internet, in terms of the promotion of a model of masses of powerless people working for free while a tiny, tiny, elite makes out like bandits.\n\nThis puts me at odds with certain groups, where cheerleading Wikipedia is part of the game. But much of my writing is against lottery-like systems anyway, and I often argue against playing a game where almost everyone loses.\n\nPosted by Seth Finkelstein at 08:46 PM | Comments (4)\n\nInside Higher Ed - \"Professors Should Embrace Wikipedia\" - April Fool?\n\nI wasn't inspired to do an April Fool's post. The best I could think of was something along the lines that I'd received a big grant from the \"Patton Foundation\" and the \"Open But Not So Open Our Brains Fall Out Minded Institute\", to set up a \"Center for Internet Skepticism\". And that sort of post sounded like a self-indulgent waste of everyone's time.\n\nBut fate provided me with blogging material today, in the form of the article \"Professors Should Embrace Wikipedia\". If this isn't an April Fool's joke, it should be:\n\nI propose that all academics with research specialties, no matter how arcane (and nothing is too obscure for Wikipedia), enroll as identifiable editors of Wikipedia. We then watch over a few wikipages of our choosing, adding to them when appropriate, stepping in to resolve disputes when we know something useful.\n\nIf the writer is serious, I'm going to save this for proof of one reason I'm so critical of Wikipedia. Namely, the proposals that experts should work for free, donating their time and energy in terms of grunt work to support the deliberate design choice of Wikipedia to favor quantity over quality.\n\nIt's really a triumph of marketing over academic standards. Set up a system where any troll, vandal, or axe-grinder can mess up a carefully worded article. Then get experts (and others) to volunteer to fight off the trolls, vandals, and axe-grinders. THEN claim this is the \"wisdom of crowds\", where the result of all that uncompensated effort and perhaps burned-out contributors shows that, magically, openness produces respectable material.\n\nSomeone's being fooled ... :-(.\n\n[Update - bonus link: Hillary Clinton Wikipedia article vandal-fighter\n\nSchilling is the man who protects Hillary's online self from the public's hatred. He estimates that he spends up to 15 hours per week editing Wikipedia under the name \"Wasted Time R\"--much of it, these days, standing watch over Hillary's page. ... \"You constantly have to police [the page],\" he says, recalling the way Rudy Giuliani's Wikipedia article declined in quality after its protectors lost interest. \"Otherwise, it diverts into a state of nature.\"\n\nSigh ...

Keep in mind that the goal was to put some recent scandals in context for a general reader, not those who have already heard me at length. In particular, Rachel Marsden got significant coverage in the British tabloid press, so there are likely now many newspaper readers who think of Wikipedia as the so-called encyclopedia that can be used to publicize a break-up (some of that tabloid stuff was pretty funny: \"Jimmy would continually be on this website called Twitter where you write one-sentence updates on what you are doing at that moment, even small things like \"I'm making a sandwich\". I couldn't understand it.\").\n\nBonus link: Wikipedia contributor \"Durova\" made a hilarious \"Nymphs and Satyr\" parody (nudity, but artistic). She meant it as a jab at the gossip blog Valleywag's writing of Wikipedia, but art sometimes carries a message different from the intent of the artist.\n\n[For all columns, see the page Seth Finkelstein | guardian.co.uk.]\n\nPosted by Seth Finkelstein at 08:53 PM | Comments (16)\n\nDebunking Wikimedia Foundation \"executive chairman\" story\n\n[Real journalism here! Not an echo! Even if nobody reads it ...]\n\nThere was a gossip-blog story yesterday which claimed that Jimmy Wales secretly retains legal control of the Wikimedia Foundation (the owner of Wikipedia):\n\nA Florida business registration for the nonprofit filed last May shows Wales's title did change -- but to \"EC,\" short for \"executive chairman,\" a worker in Florida's Department of State confirms. On paper, Wales still outranks Devouard. Could he have told her that \"EC\" stands for \"emeritus chair,\" while secretly keeping legal authority over Wikipedia to himself?\n\nI was extremely skeptical, but since there's been so much dirt coming out recently I didn't ignore it entirely (which I should have). I wasted entirely too much time chasing it around Florida's Department of State. According to what I was told, the above quote is just wrong. A registration can have any set of titles that the organization wants. There's no legal standard. If they say \"EC\" stands for \"emeritus chair\", it's up to them. If they wanted to make up a title \"Godking\", they could. There's no big revelation, the form is exactly a trivial report.\n\nLook, I understand that since the Wikipedia cult functions as a hype machine, with drama and scandal aplenty, figuring out what's reasonable and what's paranoia is not always easy. But this item was out into literal paranoia reaches. It was an accusation of major, major fraud, possible criminality. The number of Board members who would have had to go along with misrepresentation made it dubious on its face.\n\nThis sort of stuff is counter-productive for Wikipedia critics.\n\nPosted by Seth Finkelstein at 11:59 PM | Comments (0)\n\nRoger McNamee, \"Elevation Partners\", and Don't Think Small on Wikipedia\n\nWhile it may do no good for me to write posts about the pile of Wikipedia scandals, a New York Times article on its recent woes (no-reg link) contains an important mention bearing on a point I often make. The article discusses the involvement of the venture capitalist Roger McNamee, of the firm \"Elevation Partners\". I'm glad the _Times_ mentions it, as anyone of lesser status (especially mere bloggers) would simply find themselves personally attacked for raising the issue:\n\nMs. Gardner said that Mr. McNamee in the past had lined up a $500,000 donation, and arranged another $500,000 donation that came through last week. ... [snip]\n\nMr. Wales said that \"existing on donations keeps us on a shoestring budget\" adding that he was not opposed to leveraging Wikipedia's brand, consistent with its free-culture values, of course.\n\n\"There are some kinds of ways of using our brand name - a trivia game, a branded home-edition trivia game, that kind of thing seems to fit,\" he said. Perhaps a Wikipedia documentary TV show. He said that Elevation Partners \"are flexible - they could be involved in that kind of stuff.\"\n\nAs I'm constantly telling various Wikipedia critics:\n\nDON'T THINK SMALL!\n\nIt's not about the minor Google-juice that the commercial digital-sharecropping startup company \"Wikia Inc.\" gets from the nonprofit mothership Wikipedia (and that trick doesn't even seem to work anyway). It's not about overheated accusations of chump-change $5,000 donations to the Wikimedia Foundation for attention to a biography. It's not about trying to put a $1,300 dinner on a charity's expense account. It's not even about pocketing fat speaking fees, though that must be a nice perk.\n\nLooks at millions of dollars, if you can wrap your mind around that. Anybody who is rainmaking a literal million dollars of donations has an angle where they're going to get comparable value back.\n\nThat's what it's about.\n\nPosted by Seth Finkelstein at 07:11 AM | Comments (2)\n\nDebunking Jeffrey Merkey Alleging Wikipedia protection racket\n\nJeff Merkey\n\n--- STATEMENT TO THE ASSOCIATED PRESS ---\n\n\"According to Merkey, in 2006, Wales agreed that in exchange for a substantial donation and other financial support of the Wikimedia Foundation projects, Wales would use his influence to make Merkey's article adhere to Wikipedia's stated policies with regard to internet libel \"as a courtesty\" and place Merkey under his \"special protection\" as an editor. Merkey later withdrew his financial support of the Wikipedia project after reviewing evidence of diversion and mismanagement of the charities funds by Wales and the Wikimedia Board of Trustees and was immediately banned from the Wikipedia site by the Arbitration Committee for frivilous and unsubstanciated claims after he terminated the payments of $5,000.00 per year to the Wikimedia Foundation.\"\n\nJimmy Wales\n\nIt's nonsense.\n\nI've held back about posting in this, because I didn't want to even give an impression of fanning the flames from my supposed highly-read and influential blog (sarcasm). But given that this story has already made the rounds on media sites ranging from Slashdot to the BBC, my shouting to the wind can't even be alleged to have affected anything.\n\nThe irony is that while the circumstantial evidence looks bad, as to donations and action on the article, I think there's nothing in it.\n\nBasically, I don't believe Jimmy Wales would ever be so blunt and crude as accused. He's far too sophisticated to have an explicit quid-pro-quo. This may not be the sort of defense he'd like, but it has the virtue of being a lot more credible than sycophancy. And what's the charge? $5,000 to the Wikimedia Foundation? It's not even a claim of $5,000 in honoria or as a \"consulting fee\" (which is roughly how I'd expect any hypothetical bribe to be handled), which would be money directly to him. Merkey may have thought a donation would buy him influence - and he might even be right there in an extremely narrow way - but nobody at this level is ever going to make it an outright contract.\n\nI think Jeffrey Merkey confused the Wikipedia jargon of protecting an article (restricting editing) with the sense of the word in \"protection racket\", hence misunderstanding \"special protection\".\n\nPosted by Seth Finkelstein at 11:59 PM | Comments (3)\n\nSex, Lies, And Wikipedia Scandals Of Jimmy Wales\n\nI go back and forth between thinking the lid is finally coming off the extremely seamy underside of the cult of Wikipedia, and a sympathy backlash when I see some of the severe errors which have been made in the reporting of the various scandals. I can't decide if it's all ending up as rough justice where multiple attention-mongers deserve what they get from each other, or if many wrongs don't make any right.\n\nHere's one specific example from \"The Sydney Morning Herald\"\n\nMore woes for Wikipedia's Jimmy Wales\n\nEarlier, an ex-girlfriend, Rachel Marsden, leaked instant messaging transcripts that purported to show Wales using his influence to improperly make changes to Marsden's Wikipedia entry so he could continue \"f---ing [her] brains out\".\n\nIn fact, that's a direct lift of phrasing from sensationalist blog ValleyWag, self-described as \"Silicon Valley's Tech Gossip Rag\", which has\n\nWhile they were together, Wales promised Marsden swift action on edits so he could \"continue fucking [her] brains out.\"\n\nThat phrases it as if Wales stated a quid-pro-quo, of edits for sex. But he didn't say that. The whole quote in context is:\n\njimbo.wales: right so the way it is told now, hang on a second\n\nlet's actually do this right now\n\nbecause the last thing I want to do is take a break from fucking your brains out all night to work on your wikipedia entry :)\n\nNote there's no \"continue\" in the real quote. That is, he basically said he wanted to get the work done so it doesn't interrupt play, not that he's trading edits for trysts. The word \"continue\" shows that the _Morning Herald_ got it from ValleyWag. So an inaccurate gossip blog post has been reputation-laundered into a far more prestigious venue. And henceforth an edits-for-sex accusation-cloud is going to follow Jimmy Wales around forever.\n\nLive by media manipulation, die by media manipulati"
