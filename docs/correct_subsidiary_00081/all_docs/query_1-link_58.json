        "text": "Posting from the High Level Dialogue at FAO COFO (Committee on Forestry) which is a fantastic collaboration between countries from around the world sharing and learning from each other across the spectrum of critical forest issues. Here in this conversation led by national governments there is a growing emphasis on the relationship between urban centers and forests, in particular the global supply and demand of forest products and resources. This reflects a landmark moment at COP26 - UN Climate Change Conference in Glasgow, when Cities4Forests <www.cities4forests.com> convened 55 of our network city #mayors to endorse a \"Call to Action on Forests and Climate\" https://lnkd.in/d7JBiHJQ This statement was and is a strong and clear call for funding, engagement and cooperation. As we enter a new phase of awareness and connection between cities and forests, especially tropical forests, I call on our partners to continue to build on this momentum. This includes the use of timber as a climate friendly and ultimately \"forest-positive\" building material. It also includes the importance of #urbanforests and trees. The Glasgow COP was a watershed event in many respects, resulting in the #GlasgowDeclaration on Forests and Land Use, and in turn the Forest & Climate Leaders' Partnership to implement these commitments. At a local level it lead to a series of groundbreaking Partner Forest Programs with Glasgow City Council https://lnkd.in/dy2SnAUS which includes the world's first urban \"Wood Flow Analysis\" in partnership with Pilot Projects Design Collective, Metabolic and the GCC. We look forward to building and partnerships and programs in the connecting cities and forest areas as we expand into a new era of systemic collaboration. Please join us! Daniel Cornalba, Dr Emma Mellanie Morton, Fabiola Conti, James Drinkwater, Lyndall Bull, Thais Linhares-Juvenal, City of Amsterdam, Tina Ryan, Luca Ballarini, Arnaud Ngatcha, Simone Borelli See also: Better Forests, Better Cities report: https://lnkd.in/eJee5HpJ\n\nDear colleagues here at FAO COFO and Wood for Globe, Following up on the powerful Wood for Globe event on Friday, and a general consensus in favor of improved collaboration on forest management and utilization, I am sharing several initiatives from our team that may be pertinent. Please reach out if you would like to discuss: 1) The \"Partner Forest Program\" connecting major cities to threatened forests - www.partnerforests.org 2) “Sustainable Wood for Cities” - a Pathways approach to evaluating and sourcing sustainable wood: www.citywoodguide.com 3) “Better Forests, Better Cities” - by Pilot Projects and WRI: https://lnkd.in/eRzP_hWt 4) “Conservation Timber” Initiative - wood that supports long term natural (especially tropical) forest conservation: https://lnkd.in/eMJTgHPa 5) Systemic Collaboration Framework for Forest Positive Buildings: https://lnkd.in/ehdMNSdA (Related to this topic, yesterday I wrote a short piece on “Infrastructure” from my walk through some of Rome’s famous infrastructure: https://bit.ly/3Yh5Cuv) 6) The Mass Timber Tipping Point - NA-wide study on the uptake of mass timber by engineers and architects: https://lnkd.in/eMYQWTdF 7) The Future of Forest Work and Communities - a Youth Visioning methodology and pilot program to promote next gen engagement in tropical forests: www.futureforestwork.com Finally on the topic of #innovation we take a more circumspect view of innovation given its paradoxical socio-cultural impacts. 14 years ago I wrote The Innovation Paradox on this challenging topic: https://bit.ly/3y90qOQ Silvia Melegari, Simone Borelli, Lyndall Bull, Thais Linhares-Juvenal, Kim Carstensen, Murcus Vinicius, Paul King, Sally Henderson, James Drinkwater, Sarah Rivest, Sven Walter, Ross Hampton GAICD, Paula Sarigumba, Peter Graham, Tahiana Ramananantoandro, Elizabeth Rose Heeg, Vincent Gitz, Jaime Sotela Montero, Alexander Buck, Ewald Rametsteiner, Pascal Martinez, Keith Anderson, Derek Nighbor, Chetan Kumar, Katherine Poe, Michael Berger\n\nI’m looking forward to presenting at the IUFRO World Congress on \"Sustainable Wood for Thriving Cities and Forests,\" (June 27th), alongside a Poster Presentation on \"The Future of Forest Work and Communities\" by teammate Valeria Romano Lara (June 25)...Youth engaging in the future of tropical forest conservation - what could be more important! We are keen to connect with likeminded organizations supporting frontline community-based forest conservation, and to work together to showcase their positive impact. From the voices of many communities we know that sourcing their wood (especially for next-gen urban construction) can support community-led conservation, and yield substantial climate and biodiversity benefits. And when we engage young people in this forest innovation it brings exponential economic, cultural, and ecological advantages! Please meet up with us at IUFRO - International Union of Forest Research Organizations Stockholm, and with me at the World Green Building Council Congress in London and the Timber Development UK Design Conference. Looking forward to connecting and collaborating! #IUFRO2024 #ConservationTimber, Cities4Forests, Veronika Juch, Peter Graham, Sally Henderson, Paul King, Cristina Gamboa, Robin Chazdon, Jamie Micah Lawrence, Claude A. Garcia, Aurélien Sautière, Thais Linhares-Juvenal, Lyndall Bull, Ewald Rametsteiner, Benoit Jobbe - Duval, Fabiola Conti\n\nA few weeks ago we hosted the #ConservationTimber Forum and #PartnerForest Summit respectively at Carrefour International du Bois in Nantes, and Urban Future. 24 in Rotterdam. These events brought together city leaders from Glasgow City Council, City of Amsterdam, Gemeente Rotterdam, Comune di Torino and forest experts from FSC, FAO, Rainforest Alliance, Probos, PEFC International, ETH Zürich and others to share insights and brainstorm new ways to enhance collaboration between people, organizations, sectors, and even geographies (i.e. forests and cities!) Participants discussed what strategies have been effective in these ambitious projects, the challenges encountered, and how the programs support their city's broader goals of climate action, biodiversity conservation, social justice and other vital commitments. Cities globally are turning their attention to sustainable wood procurement as critical tool in their #bioeconomy and #climateaction strategies, and they are taking notice of these efforts. (We just welcomed Ville de Paris into this collaboration!) The exchange of recent experience and new ideas aimed to highlight best practices and ways to accelerate the impact of Partner Forest Programs and the use of Conservation Timber on behalf of forest outcomes such as: #forest_youth, #forest_conservation, #forest_entrepreneurship and #value_system_transparency. We are grateful for everyone's contributions and excited about the potential for even greater collaboration moving forward. I encourage municipal changemakers to subscribe to our Partner Forest newsletter, and to connect with us on LinkedIn. The momentum is inspiring! I hope to see some of you next week at IUFRO World Congress on forests in Stockholm, the World Green Building Council Forum and UK Timber Design Conference in London!

We are excited to start learning and sharing sustainable and visionary strategies for cities (and forests) around the world. Here are three events we will be contributing to at UF24 - Please join us!: Wednesday June 5, 4:00 PM - 5:30 PM | Session 2.2 \"Starting from Scratch: Change by Design: How planners, architects, and engineers transform the way we build\". (My talk is called \"Starting from Forests: Systemic Change by Design\" :) Join me and other architects and urbanists as we discuss our journeys, ideas and collaborations! Caterina Rocca , Andrej Šmid , Angeline Chartier and Eugen Antalovsky (Moderator) in Rotterdam Ahoy. Thursday June 6, 9:00 AM - 10:30 AM | I host: \"Engage with Partner Forest Urban Leaders\" where we'll discuss a set of Cities4Forests pilots that paired city leadership with community managed TROPICAL forests for mutual benefit - using conservation timber sourced in their forests! https://lnkd.in/eyWEMytu Friday June 7, 10:00 AM - 1:30 PM You can lean more by join us on a \"Conservation Timber Tour\" of Rotterdam: Meet me and other Partner Forest Leaders at Westerkade 31, Rotterdam https://lnkd.in/eKCa8E2m Mack Phillips, Mark van Benthem, Eli Prins, John van Vilsteren, Dr Emma Mellanie Morton, Gavin Slater, Luca Ballarini, Stratosferica, Francesco Tresso, Carlos Estrada, Benoit Jobbe - Duval, Jeroen van der Waal, Stephane Glannaz, David Östby Thais Linhares-Juvenal, Camilla Richter-Friis van Deurs, Todd Gartner, Paige Langer, Sadof Alexander, James Drinkwater, Nazakat Azimli, Paul King, Sarah Rivest\n\nMontreal friends, Today Concordia University hosts its \"Young Entrepreneurs\" fair, where 50 kids will be selling goods and services that they have created. It's a great program to support next-gen entrepreneurship! Our son Peter (age 7) will be selling his handmade coat-hooks and other useful products made from salvaged tree limbs he collected in the parcs and streets of Montreal. His self-designed brand is: \"From Plant Only\" Aujourd'hui 10:00 à 14:00 Location: Concordia University, LB Atrium; 1400 Blvd. De Maisonneuve Ouest, Montreal, QC H3G 2V8, Canada Peter's webpage: https://lnkd.in/ekQpAKK8 These hooks come in a variety of sizes for a wide variety of uses. In my personal experience (not at all biased! :) every time you use one of these hooks you will experience a spark of joy as you connect to the natural and miraculous world of trees! I am currently in Paris, but Sarah Jane Wilson will be at the fair with Peter and they would also be very happy to see some of you. If my memory serves me correctly, the hooks start at $4 and go up to about $20 for the huge hooks that can hold hundreds of kilos. I suspect Peter may be willing to bargain!"
