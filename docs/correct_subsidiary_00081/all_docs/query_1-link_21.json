        "text": "Dear fellow sports fans, let's be honest. If a 95 mph inside fastball with late-action break screamed past us, we probably wouldn't hit it, and might need treatment for PTSD afterwards.\n\nThat, however, does not affect our ability to critique. The key player on our team who doesn't rip that into the left-center gap on a regular basis will hear our invectives, as we analyze the glitch in his swing, question his batting coach and wonder whether we can trade him for the pitcher.\n\nMark Teixeira, the New York Yankees' first baseman, has no problem with that.\n\n\"Sports exists for the fans,\" says Teixeira, a three-time All Star and one-time World Series champion. \"If it weren't for fans who come out and buy tickets and jerseys, watch the games on TV, athletes wouldn't have a game to play. If they want to talk about the teams, and the players, that's good for the sport.\"\n\nAnd he is investing his money where his mouth is. Teixeira is one of the founding partners of SportsYapper, a social platform strictly for talking sports, which has been growing over this year mainly with an East Coast audience. Currently available as an app on iOS and Android, the company is developing a web interface as well.\n\nSports has proven to be a big-time winner for Social Media. Two of the three largest Social TV events have been sports events: The 2012 Super Bowl and Game 5 of the 2012 NBA Championships. This has happened on platforms that were built for any conversation -- Twitter and Facebook. SportsYapper is an attempt to draw that energy into its own space.\n\nAnd Teixeira is on a tech team with solid stats. Co-founder Eric Goldstein developed clipmarks.com, a social news site, purchased by this publication in 2007. He sold another venture, amplify.com, to Clipboard last year. His founding partner, Dave Grossman, created Rare Medium, one of the first digital agencies, in 1996 and partnered with Goldstein on amplify. They've brought on partners such as Teixeira and entrepreneur Kenny Dichter, founder of Marquis Jets and Tequila Avion.\n\nThey all share one commonality: they're sports fanatics and they love Social Media.\n\n\"The idea that we can share experiences over the web and mobile devices is something I'm very passionate about,\" Goldstein says. \"And I'm also incredibly passionate about sports. Both playing sports and watching them and rooting for them.\"\n\nAbout a year ago, Goldstein and Grossman were talking in Starbucks about their wish for a Twitter or Facebook that just centered on games.\n\n\"It was a conversation that lasted weeks,\" Goldstein says. \"It was just one of those moments where we decided, 'Let's just do it.'\"\n\nIn tech terms they've chosen to play small ball. Rather than rolling out a massive app with dozens of bells and whistles, SportsYapper arrives with a simple concept: Pick the teams you love and join the conversation around them.\n\nThis measured approach toward iterating a product is common. But SportsYapper has some notions that look a little different than the current guard of Social Media. It's not just the content-specific model. It's the curation within that model that might catch the attention of businesspeople who wouldn't know the difference between a play-action rollout and a pick-and-roll.\n\nHere are four examples:\n\nTwitter-resistant Social TV\n\nTechnically, SportsYapper could be added to the league of Social TV apps. There's a section in the app called \"Game On\" that lets friends know which game you're watching. Goldstein knew from the outset that games on TV would be a critical driver of SportsYapper's conversations.\n\n\"We created it because people watching sports on TV are, very often, not able to communicate with other people watching the game,\" Goldstein says.\n\nBut SportsYapper strategy is different from many Social TV players. For one, The TV integration is not driven by SoundPrint technology or a sophisticated TV listing interface. Social discovery is only created by friends tuning in and logging on.\n\nMore importantly, SportsYapper is not integrating Twitter conversations into the app.\n\n\"I don't necessarily see the value for apps that are just pulling in Twitter feeds. I would say just go to Twitter,\" Goldstein says. \"There is a certain flow and certain way to communicate on Twitter, with hashtags and a 140-character limit. We have a 300-character limit, because we just felt too often that trying to fit into 140-characters wasn't working. And as far as hashtags, we feel that's another inhibitor to the flow of the conversation.\"\n\nAll the information from SportsYapper is outflowing to Twitter. If you're watching a game, you can Tweet that or post it on Facebook. And most likely, Teixeira says, leave it at that.\n\n\"I'm a huge Georgia Tech football fan,\" says Teixeira, who has 170,00+ followers on Twitter, \"and if I tweet all day long about the last game, my followers are going to say, 'That's enough. We've heard enough about Georgia Tech football.'\"\n\nThe other distinction from Twitter, Goldstein says, is that there's a natural context in SportsYapper that Twitter users don't usually experience. There was one yapp from the NHL playoff series between the New Jersey Devils and New York Rangers that Goldstein says summarizes the difference.\n\n\"The entire yapp was the word: Post!!\" Goldstein says. A puck had just hit the post and caromed away. \"And I knew without having to think about it, or contextualize it, exactly what that person was talking about. Because I was in the Rangers stream at that moment and I was watching the Rangers game. If you were to tweet the word, 'Post!!' no one on Twitter would know what you were talking about.\"\n\nTopic-first connections\n\nUnlike Twitter, Facebook and Pinterest, which defines connections between people first and topics second, SportsYapper puts the topics front and center. Connecting with friends is encouraged, but a primary way to find conversations is by picking your teams. And SportsYapper is adding those streams, not the user. So you won't be able to add your children's high school sports conference or youth baseball league.\n\n\"What we want to do is not build a critical mass,\" Goldstein says, \"but to think of every single team in pro sports and college sports as their own critical mass.\"\n\nEncouraging community over \"smack\"\n\nUnlike most sports conversation sites, there's also not a lot of cross-talk between rival fans on SportsYapper. Yankees fans tend to be talking to Yankees fans. Of course, the occasional Red Sox believer can wonder in and disrupt the proceedings, but they'll always be outnumbered. It is possible to see all the conversations streaming on the app, but it's easier to join in conversations through a team's portal.\n\n\"Thinking about a sports bar where, typically, Yankees fans are in their bar and Red Sox fans are in their bar, they don't go meet somewhere in the middle,\" Goldstein says. \"We think of SportsYapper and the sports bar in your pocket.\"\n\nTeixeira argues these semi-porous silos could potentially create quality conversations between fans and players.\n\n\"If I wanted to, after the game, go on and talk to the real diehard Yankees fans on Twitter,\" he says, \"as soon as I've answered one or two questions, I would have a bunch of people jumping on saying, 'Yankees stink. Go Red Sox.' Or, 'Teixeira, you stink, you should retire.' But on SportsYapper, in the future when we have lots of users, and you become a trusted user and I can follow you or the Yankees can follow you and know you're not going to talk smack about all the Yankees players, I could go on and have a good conversation with those fans directly.\"\n\nUser-integration, not just generation\n\nIf there is a commonality to Twitter, it's the simplicity of the interface. Goldstein says the plans are to gradually grow out the platform to include more teams, more services and more sophisticated technologies.\n\nBut there's also a key difference. Where Twitter and Facebook hold looser reins on content generation, especially with portals, SportsYapper plans to bring greater user involvement into the interface itself.\n\n\"As we grow,\" Teixeira says, \"the changes and additions to the site will be driven by what users want, not what we decide they need.\""
