        "text": "Earlier today I saw someone share that they had made an Advent calendar using AdventMyFriend. Not liking to actually sit and do just one thing, I decided to investigate and have a go myself whilst watching TV.\n\nBelow is the result!\n\nReally easy to do too!\n\nOne you’ve finished, you can share your calendar to most social media platforms as well as sharing via email and embedding it into a website or blog.\n\nI’m thinking that I’ll make another one with Christmas traditions from around the world. In the meantime, you’ll have to wait until December 1st before you can look behind the first door of the one above! Why not make your own in the meantime?\n\nI was overjoyed to be asked to present at the inaugural PHOrum meeting for members of the Association for Language Learning last Wednesday evening (get well soon Susanne x). My presentation was entitled Take One Book and can be viewed below along with links to some of the resources and ideas I shared.\n\nYou can find out more about the Take One Book by going to their website. A helpful literacy idea with amazing resources! https://www.takeonebook.org\n\nThere are multiple versions of the story being read online in Spanish online – this is one and here’s another one that are read in both Spanish and English, and this one has the bilingual text but just Spanish narration.\n\nWordwalls:\n\nhttps://wordwall.net/resource/6417210 Esta no es mi gata\n\nhttps://wordwall.net/resource/6416418 Es mi gata Q+A with words\n\nhttps://wordwall.net/resource/6417038 Es mi gata Q+A no words\n\nJoining in with a story video featuring Nigel Pearson sharing the book in German (Wo ist meine Katze?) https://vimeo.com/123422432 Well worth watching this masterclass in engaging a class in a story!\n\nIf you want to story as written in the book in German here’s a video of it being read\n\nA number of resources are available for the original text (in English) that could be adapted.\n\nA puzzle to adapt\n\nhttps://www.readytoread.com/documents/rtr-carle-activities.pdfResource\n\nResources on TPT\n\nhttps://www.teacherspayteachers.com/Product/Have-You-Seen-My-Cat-by-Eric-Carle-Bundle-Resources-4566552?st=2bc1e1ad0f265de650a2c2f0f099b137\n\nA literacy lesson plan\n\nhttps://tracieanzara.weebly.com/uploads/1/1/7/2/11727035/lesson_2.pdf\n\nReadWriteThink Planning PDF http://www.readwritethink.org/files/resources/interactives/stapleless/StaplelessBookPlanningSheet.pdf\n\nWord cards http://www.readwritethink.org/files/resources/lesson_images/lesson131/wordcards.pdf\n\nLesson ideas http://www.readwritethink.org/classroom-resources/lesson-plans/using-predictable-text-teach-131.html?tab=4#tabs\n\nTissue paper cat craft https://www.gluedtomycraftsblog.com/2015/08/tissue-paper-black-cat-kid-craft.html\n\nHidden cat article https://www.cnet.com/news/find-the-cat-photograph-with-tricky-kitty-stumps-many-as-it-goes-viral/\n\nInfographic showing the effect of loss of habitat on wild cats https://www.agenciasinc.es/Visual/Infografias/La-perdida-de-habitat-amenaza-a-los-felinos-del-mundo#results\n\nArticle about the Cat Island https://www.ngenespanol.com/traveler/descubre-la-isla-de-los-gatos-japon//\n\nAnimalandia – a great website with short factfiles in Spanish about a wide variety of animals as referenced in slide 46. http://animalandia.educa.madrid.org/\n\nThere will a PHOrum meeting every term so if you don’t want to miss out on the next one, do join ALL. Find out how here.\n\nAs mentioned in an earlier post, I was asked to speak at The Language Show which this year went online and was delivered via Zoom. Below is my presentation and brief notes on what I talked about.\n\nThank you to all those who saw it ‘live’ for being there – even if I couldn’t see your faces which I found quite disconcerting – and for your questions and comments. I saved the chat and enjoyed reading back your comments. Any questions that were in the chat and not put into the Q&A tab so therefore went unanswered, I’ll answer below.\n\nIf you want to see me delivering it live, you can view the recording of the session for the next month (so until mid December 2020 I would think) via the Language Show website and clicking on my name (see below)\n\nBelow are links to resources, reading and things on which I commented/shared as there are lost of hyperlinked images!\n\nThe pitfalls of Google Translate https://www.redlinels.com/pros-and-cons-of-google-translate/\n\nPhysical Spanish Phonics https://brilliantpublications.co.uk/physical-spanish-phonics.html\n\nHands of the World at WCPS http://www.whitehousecommon.bham.sch.uk/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=3020:this-is-me-signed-in-makaton-hands-of-the-world-project&catid=81&Itemid=278\n\nOld World Language Families Tree https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/59665/feast-your-eyes-beautiful-linguistic-family-tree See also http://www.sssscomic.com/comic.php?page=195\n\nOxford University Press dictionary sheets https://global.oup.com/education/content/dictionaries/free-resources/oxford-school-dictionary-word-origins-free-resources/?region=uk\n\nSomething Rhymes with Purple podcast https://play.acast.com/s/somethingrhymeswithpurple\n\nLanguage Links posters https://www.lightbulblanguages.co.uk/resources-language-links.htm\n\nSlide 37 worksheet https://www.lightbulblanguages.co.uk/resources/PrimarySpanish/days.pdf\n\nSlide 36 The great Eskimo vocabulary hoax and other irreverent essays on the study of language. http://www.lel.ed.ac.uk/~gpullum/EskimoHoax.pdf\n\nFuturelearn course on Intercultural Studies – Language and Culture https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/intercultural-studies-language-culture\n\neTwinning https://www.britishcouncil.org/etwinning\n\nLet’s Go Cultural!

It’s from a unit on your town and the task the children were doing was using the structure En mi pueblo hay (place) Aquí se puede (infinitive) We’ve been talking about what there is/isn’t in our town, and what our town is like, and moved on to looking at infinitives. The task was supported by a ‘trapdoor’ grid that we’d used to rehearse the structure. The child whose work I shared had extended his sentences using adjectives which weren’t on the grid and applied his previous learning of adjectival position and agreement. I’d suggested it as a way to enhance their writing but not pushed the point which was why I was so pleased.\n\nPaula asked if I remembered The Language Show a few years ago at Olympia with my trolley of resources. Of course I do! I still have it although in Covid19 times it has been rested for a bit as I’m not allowed to use as many resources.\n\nAnd I’d just like to reiterate what people were saying in the chat about making mistakes and being an example to your learners. I completely agree – modelling how we deal with mistakes, and showing that we are lifelong learners is SO important. One of my Y4 classes answer the register by greeting me in variety of languages and I’m trying to learn (and remember!) the response to each. They’re being very patient and keep repeating it until I get it correct. Problem is, by the time the next week comes, I’ve forgotten most of it. I keep trying though – which is all I ask of them!\n\nFinally, if you teach primary languages in the UK, I recommended joining Languages in Primary School group (LiPS) on Facebook. Here’s the link. Please make sure you answer all 3 questions when you ask to join! https://www.facebook.com/groups/primarylanguages\n\nIf you have any questions, please leave a comment below and I’ll answer.\n\nI’ll leave you with Westlife – More than words\n\nDue to current circumstances The Language Show, which is normally held in November at Olympia in London, is going online this year.\n\nHeld the weekend 13th-15th November, the show has three streams of talks:\n\nFor those who love languages – talks, entertainment and insights.\n\nFor language teachers – CPD for teachers in primary, secondary, HE, FE, adult, EFL/ESOL\n\nFor language professionals – interpreters, translators and those who want to put their languages to work\n\nEach stream offers a programme of seminars starting mid morning on Friday Saturday and Sunday and are all free to attend via Zoom. Some that have caught my eye include\n\nFriday 13.30-14.15: Unlocking the hidden meanings of everyday words which is all hidden meanings and ancient connections, and the etymology of words.\n\nSaturday 13.30-14.15: Foods and Words: Can our appetite motivate language learning? which looks at the history of some staple British food of foreign origin and introduces basic linguistic principles to understanding their names.\n\nSunday 11.00-11.45: 5 Weeks of Low-Prep Fun in the Language Classroom – Janina Klimas which offers 25 easy-to-prepare, engaging activities and resources that get students excited about learning languages and through some of the rough parts, all while having fun.\n\nFriday 15.30-16.15: Introduction to subtitling – Lindsay Bywood which will cover the various types of subtitling, how they are created, how the industry is set up and how to train and get work as a subtitler.\n\nI’m definitely signing up for “We Are Multilingual”: Identity-based activities to promote and enhance language learning which is being delivered on Sunday 14.30-15.15 by Linda Fisher and Karen Forbes on behalf of the Multilingual Identity in Education group at the Faculty of Education, University of Cambridge.\n\nOn Saturday from 1300-1345 you can join me as I talk about how language learning is about More than words. Here’s the blurb!\n\n“This session explores the notion that learning a language is about so much more than lists of words and grammar. Drawing from the speaker’s own observations and experiences as a lifelong language learner as well as a teacher and mother, we will consider the importance of context, culture, communication, celebration and connections in nurturing learners with an enduring passion for language(s).”\n\nYou can register for free now on the website Follow all the latest news by following The Language Show on Twitter or Facebook.\n\nHopefully ‘see’ some of you there!"
