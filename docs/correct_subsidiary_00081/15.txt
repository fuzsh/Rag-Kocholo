Clipmarks is a New York-based bookmarking tool that allows users to clip the best parts of web pages. It doesn’t matter whether its videos, images, or text. The clippings can be private or public. ClipSearch is a feature within Clipmarks that allows users to search within the content that is clipped.

VentureBeat ran a story that Forbes is looking to buy Clipmarks for the use of giving their journalists a tool to find the important parts of given story references. Roger McNamee, a board member at Forbes, wrote that the story ran a bit prematurely, “but only by a little.”

Forbes has 700 employees and made $78.80 million in revenue as of the 2007 fiscal year end. Forbes directly competes against Dow Jones, which is being acquired by News Corp. for up to $5.6 billion.

Forbes is also rumored to be in the midst of moving their headquarters into an office that will house all of Forbes’ units. Elevation Partners, an investment company that includes Bono of the rock band, U2 bought a 40% stake in Forbes about a year ago.
