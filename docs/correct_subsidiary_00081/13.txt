Fidel Castro conflict

In 2005, "Forbes" listed Fidel Castro among the world's richest people, with an estimated net worth of $550 million USD. In the 2006 article "Fortunes Of Kings, Queens And Dictators", "Forbes" increased their estimate to $900 million USD. [cite web |url=http://www.forbes.com/2006/05/04/rich-kings-dictators_cz_lk_0504royals.html |title=Fortunes Of Kings, Queens And Dictators - Forbes.com |accessdate=2008-01-05] The article notes that estimating net worth for government leaders is "more art than science", and points out that in the case of Castro the authors used a discounted cash flow method for several state-owned companies, and assumed a portion of that profit stream went to Castro.

Castro responded that he has a net worth of less than $1 USD, and challenged any one to prove that he has any money in overseas accounts. [cite web |url=http://www.granma.cu/ingles/2006/mayo/mar16/21fidel1.html |title=granma.cu - "I call on them to prove that I have one single dollar!" |accessdate=2008-01-05] Castro also stated that Forbes should place a bucket over their head.
