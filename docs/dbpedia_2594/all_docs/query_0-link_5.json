For the chief executives of the US state of New Jersey, informally also known as 'Jersey', see Governor and Lieutenant Governor of New Jersey.\n\nLieutenant Governor of Jersey\n\nIncumbent\n\nVice-Admiral Jerry Kyd\n\nsince 8 October 2022\n\nStyleHis ExcellencyResidenceGovernment HouseAppointerMonarchy of the United KingdomTerm lengthFive years[1]Formation1502First holderSir Hugh Vaughan\n\n(as Governor of Jersey)Websitewww .governmenthouse .gov .je\n\nThe lieutenant governor of Jersey (Jèrriais: Gouvèrneux d'Jèrri, \"Governor of Jersey\"), properly styled the lieutenant-governor of Jersey[2] (French: Lieutenant-Gouverneur de Jersey), is the representative of the British monarch in the Bailiwick of Jersey, a dependency of the British Crown.\n\nPresently, there is no governor of Jersey (French: Gouverneur de Jersey), the role having devolved its responsibilities onto the lieutenant governors and then been discontinued in 1854. The position of lieutenant governor is now itself largely ceremonial, with day-to-day responsibility over most functions of government overseen by the Chief Minister of Jersey and judicial and certain other official matters overseen by the Bailiff of Jersey.\n\nDuties\n\n[edit]\n\nThe lieutenant governor serves as the de facto head of state in Jersey, performing various ceremonial functions and liaising between the Governments of Jersey and the United Kingdom. The lieutenant governor also exercises certain executive functions relating broadly to citizenship, including involvement with passports, deportation, and nationality. Jersey passports are British passports issued on behalf of the lieutenant governor, in the exercise of the royal prerogative, through the Passport Office which the States fund and from which the States retain any revenue generated. Deportation from Jersey is formally ordered by the lieutenant governor. Certificates of naturalization as a British citizen are issued by the lieutenant governor.[3]\n\nEx officio, the lieutenant governor is a member of the States of Jersey but may not vote and, by convention, speaks in the Chamber only on appointment and on departure from post.\n\nHistory\n\n[edit]\n\nThe unusual position of the lieutenant governor is a product of the unusual situation created when the once-Viking dukes of Normandy, vassals of the kings of France, became kings of England and subsequently claimed the French throne itself. Despite the loss of Normandy and failure of the First and main Hundred Years' Wars, the situation caused the terms of the 1259 Treaty of Paris to be generally maintained and the Channel Islands were organized separately from the Kingdom of England and its successor states and held directly under the Crown.\n\nFrom 933, the dukes of Normandy and then kings of England held the islands directly. Beginning with Prince John on 8 February 1198, they began to be delegated to a series of princes and royal favourites like Peter de Preaux as feudal lords of the isles (Latin: dominus insularum; French: seigneur des îles). Actual administrative control was separately placed with a warden of the isles (custos insularum; gardien des îles), at first typically a member of the king's household knights or the royal council. This post was given wide autonomy in command and judgment alongside 12 sworn coroners (coronatores juratos) charged to preserve and clarify the local traditions, obligations, and freedoms and some of its holders were greatly enriched by the provision of terra Normannorum, lands seized from previous owners obliged to swear fealty to the Capetian king of France to preserve their other holdings on the Continent. The wardens were initially appointed by the islands' lords but, particularly under the long and neglectful rule of Edward I's favourite Otto de Grandson, some were appointed directly by the king to ensure the islands' allegiance and protection during times of hostility with France. This became standard after the lordship became hereditary in the line of Henry Beauchamp and then ceased to be awarded upon the line's extinguishment. As early as 1201, the lords and wardens were both sometimes described as the bailiff of the islands (ballivus insularum; bailli des îles), but this gradually became a separate position held by a separate agent.\n\nFollowing the capture of Mont Orgueil and Jersey's occupation by the French from 1461–1468 owing to the support of Pierre de Brézé, seneschal of Normandy, to the Lancastrian cause of his cousin Margaret of Anjou during the Wars of the Roses, greater attention was paid to the islands' organisation and defense. Upon its reconquest by Richard Harliston, he was named captain of the isles (capitaine des îles) or captain-in-chief (capitaine en chef). Shortly thereafter in 1473, the previous captains or subwardens (subcustos) at Jersey and Guernsey were replaced by separate captains or governors (gouverneur) overseeing the local garrisons.[10] Jurisdictional friction with the islands' bailiffs culminated in legal disputes between the captain John Peyton and the bailiff Jean Hérault, who was attempting to usurp the title of \"governor\". A series of rulings by the Privy Council from 1616 to 1618 determined that Jersey's captain would be formally styled its governor but largely restricted to military matters, while the bailiff would exercise most civil and judicial responsibilities without his oversight; Guernsey's officials followed suit shortly thereafter.[10][11]\n\nAfter the Stuart Restoration, King Charles II—who had previously escaped to France via Jersey—rewarded the island with the power to levy customs duties. The post of governor of Jersey thereafter became a sinecure chiefly used for its incomes, with its responsibilities discharged after 1806 by lieutenant governors. Following the long and entirely absent \"service\" of William Beresford as governor, the post was left vacant. Since his death in 1856, the Crown has been formally and constitutionally represented in Jersey by lieutenant governors.[12] The lieutenant governors have gradually lost various powers of their office. Jersey's custom duties—previously levied by an assembly consisting of the governor, bailiff, and jurats—has been controlled by the States of Jersey since 1921, removing most control over the island's finances by the lieutenant governor; the States of Jersey Law 2005 abolished the lieutenant governor's previous ability to veto resolutions of the States;[13] and the recommendation of future lieutenant governors was announced in 2010[needs update] to be the responsibility of a panel on Jersey rather than of the ministers of the United Kingdom.[14][15]\n\nList of governors of Jersey\n\n[edit]\n\nGovernors have been:[16]\n\nDate Governor 1470–1483 Richard Harliston (Captain in Chief of Jersey) 1486–1494 Matthew Baker 1494–1500 Thomas Overay 1500–1502 Jean Lempriere 1502–1531 Sir Hugh Vaughan (first to be known as Governor)[dubious – discuss] 1532–1534 Sir Anthony Ughtred 1534–1536 Sir Arthur Darcy 1536–1537 Sir Thomas Vaux, Lord Vaux 1537–1550 Sir Edward Seymour 1550–1574 Sir Hugh Paulet 1547–1590 Sir Amyas Paulet 1590–1600 Sir Anthony Paulet 1600–1603 Sir Walter Raleigh 1603–1630 Sir John Peyton 1631–1643 Sir Thomas Jermyn 1644–1651 Sir Henry Jermyn, 1st Earl of St Albans 1651–1654 Colonel James Heane 1655–1659 Colonel Robert Gibbon 1659–1660 Colonel John Mason 1660 Colonel Carew Raleigh 1660–1665 Sir Henry Jermyn, 1st Earl of St Albans 1665–1679 Sir Thomas Morgan, 1st Baronet 1679–1684 Sir John Lanier[17] 1684–1703 Thomas Jermyn 1704–1722 General Henry Lumley 1723–1749 Richard Temple, 1st Viscount Cobham 1749–1761 Lieutenant General John Huske 1761–1772 George Keppel, 3rd Earl of Albemarle 1772–1795 Field Marshal Henry Seymour Conway[18] 1795–1796 Field Marshal Sir George Howard[19] 1796–1807 George Townshend, 1st Marquess Townshend 1807–1820 John Pitt, 2nd Earl of Chatham 1820–1854 William Beresford, 1st Viscount Beresford (Last Governor)\n\nList of lieutenant governors of Jersey\n\n[edit]\n\nLieutenant Governors of Jersey have been:[16][dubious – discuss]\n\nTitle Appointed Name 1634 Sir Philippe de Carteret (Royalist) 26 August 1643 Major Lydcott (Parliament) 24 November 1643 Sir George Carteret (Royalist) at least by 1689 Edward Harris[20]: 164 3 March 1695[21] Col.
