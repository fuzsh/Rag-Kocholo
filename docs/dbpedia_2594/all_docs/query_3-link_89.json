        "text": "Record Series of the Week Phebe Jacobsen\n\nMaryland's Participation in the War of Jenkins' Ear\n\nIntrigued by the title of Indexes to \"Colonial Wars\", I have gone through histories and records to see exactly the extent of Maryland's participation in Wars of the Empire. The index per se covers only Maryland officers and companies engaged in the Seven Years War, commonly known as the French and Indian War, 1756-1763. Some of these troops also guarded the western frontiers of the Colony before and after the French and Indian War ended. The following information, however, may be of interest.\n\nThe final stage of the 250 year struggle between the major European powers for domination of the North American continent took place between 1739 and 1763, manifested largely by wars between England and France. The year 1739 began with Britain's war against Spain, and the attempted acquisition of Spanish trade in South America. The War of Jenkins' Ear 1739-1743 was preliminary to King George's War 1744-1748, which was prior to the Seven Years War. Maryland troops participated in all three, as they never had in earlier campaigns.\n\nBy the Treaty of Utrecht (1713), British merchants, except for those belonging to the English South Sea Company, and party to the Asiento Agreement {this was an agreement signed in 1713 by the South Sea Company and the Spanish Crown, whereby that Company was given the exclusive right to sell 4800 African slaves each year in the Spanish colonies for 30 years}, were greatly restricted in trade. So being the brave souls that they were as smugglers, they invaded the Spanish Main. Some British ships were seized by the Spanish, and during one such altercation, the ear of a British sailor, Edmund Jenkins, was cropped by his captors. The story of Jenkins' ear, raised the wrath of all red blooded Englishmen.\n\nAs early as June 1739, the British government had authorized Governor Ogle, as it no doubt authorized other colonial governors, to issue letters of marque and reprisal against Spanish ships. In the following months, as a logical step in preparation for the coming conflict, Ogle ordered a list of his militia from the colonels of each county's militia units.\n\nWar was formally proclaimed October 19, 1739, but not until the following spring did Maryland's participation actually begin. His majesty requested able-bodied, debt free freemen for whom His Majesty's government would provide arms and clothing, return transportation, and a share of booty. The war was, His Majesty said, against Spain and the Spanish settlements in the West Indies. Transportation for a general rendezvous would be provided by the Province, as would be the funding for enlistments.\n\nA disagreement arose over the enlistees' debt free status in the initial bill offered by the Lower House. Eventually, L2562.10 in current money, in Bills of Credit were to be applied to persons who volunteered. On September 6, 1740, the following officers received appointments and royal commissions: Captains John Milburn, John Lloyd, and Thomas Addison. There is no record of these men {Volume 1 of The Iron Chest Accounts has an entry dated February 25, 1740 [1741] saying that Patrick Creagh was paid by agents for maintaining and transporting. . . troops as per order December 10, 1740. Others were paid for enlisting persons in His Majesties service}. Scharf says that most colonies sent volunteers.\n\nAlthough there were skirmishes and battles along Florida borders, involving the new colonies of Georgia and the Carolinas, the greatest action was far to the south.\n\nThe American Regiment (this was the first time \"American\" had been used by the British military) fought alongside British regulars. Twelve thousand soldiers and fifteen thousand sailors embarked on a fleet of 115 ships, many of them Ships of the Line. The expedition, composed of forces from England, as well as volunteers from the colonies, made rendezvous in Jamaica early in 1741. There they set sail for Carthagena, now in northern Colombia, and then the largest stronghold of Spain in South America. From March 4 to April 16, 1741, the expedition labored and fought near the city which was protected by four forts. Two fell under the onslaught of British soldiers, and fortifications had been erected for assaults upon the other two when the rains came and yellow fever struck. Vernon, much against his will, was forced to withdraw. Hall says that \"the loss of life from sickness was appalling. Hundreds fell before the guns of the Spaniards, but thousands perished from disease.\"\n\nThus ended the first campaign in which Britain had used her colonial troops outside of North America. Only two-thirds returned. So far as we know, there were none from Maryland. But George Washington's stepbrother Lawrence, an aide to Vernon, came back to establish an estate on the Potomac, named Mount Vernon, for the admiral. It is also written that Vernon, being so disgusted with the amount of rum his forces consumed, had water added to the bottles, thus creating Grog.\n\nThe last battle of the War of Jenkins' Ear took place near the Florida border in 1742, when a Spanish counterattack was repulsed. Already, the War of the Austrian Succession had begun in Europe. Spain and France had joined forces against Prussia and Britain. In the colonies, this conflict was known as King George's War (1744-1748), because it involved the family connection of German born and German bred George I. To a large extent, it was fought in Europe, but in the New World, it took place in Canada.\n\nContenders for land in Canada had long ago narrowed to Britain and France. Spain's dominion day to the South and West. By the national Treaty of Utrecht (1713), Britain received Newfoundland, Acadia (Nova Scotia), and the Hudson Bay area. France retained islands of the St. Lawrence, and Cape Breton. Neither country was satisfied with this part of the treaty any more than England had been satisfied with the section limiting her right to trade in the Spanish Main.\n\nNews of the declaration of war had just reached the small British island of Canso, at the extreme northeast corner of Nova Scotia, when it was captured in May 1744 by the French. Canso was an important port for New England fishermen, and offered a place for them to cure cod. In retaliation, Governor Shirley of Massachusetts, with the help of local fishermen, made plans to take Louisbourgh, the great French fortress guarding the St. Lawrence. New Englanders believed that Louisbourgh harbored pirates, and it certainly harbored privateers. With assistance from the northern colonies, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, and an army of civilians, led by William Pepperrell, aided by the British, fleet, the impossible was accomplished. After a siege of two months, Louisbourgh surrendered on June 1744. News of the victory traveled throughout the colonies, and was met with great joy. In Maryland, subscriptions were taken up for New England soldiers and their families, while provision and arms were sent to the garrison at Louisbourgh.\n\nGovernor Shirley now turned to plans for the invasion of Canada by a colonial militia, but the British military were not about to allow such an independent venture for their colonial subjects. Instead, they proposed that an integrated force strike against Quebec. The British plan was not disputed, and as a request for the usual levy, went out to all colonies. The General Assembly of Maryland voted L4500 for the cause, and on September 15, 1745, the Maryland Gazette reported that three companies under Captains Campbell, Crofts, and Jordan had sailed northward. The planned expedition never took place, but the volunteers were retained at Albany for eighteen months. The British officials asked Maryland for further money to maintain them, but outside of the L1100 voted in November of 1754, the General Assembly refused to accept further obligation.\n\nThe Treaty of Aix-la-Chappelle was announced in Annapolis May 5, 1749. One of its provisions directed Louisbourgh be returned to the French.\n\nSERENDIPITOUS NEWS Kevin Swanson\n\nOriginal Laws in more recent times are quite useful for tracing the legislative history of an act of the General Assembly. The laws show the original bill number and indicate the dates on which the three readings of the bill took place in each of the houses of the legislature.\n\nTHE ARCHIVISTS' BULLDOG\n\nVol. 1, No. 26\n\n28 September 1987\n\nLibrary Libations Doug McElrath\n\nEleanor L. Albright and Mary A. Dye, Naturalized in Cumberland (Cumberland, 1987) Loc: LIB-3-1-1\n\nR. Benice Leonard, Talbot County Maryland Land Records, Vols. I and II (St. Michaels, 1987) Loc: LIB-3-2-3\n\nNaturalized in Cumberland is a transcription of the original Allegany County Naturalization Indexes dating from 1820 to 1852. This publication duplicates the information on the cards in Index 42. You should note that we do not have the actual naturalization records for Allegany County on film or in the original until 1845. Don't be surprised if a request slip appears in the tray asking for a pre-1845 naturalization that is still only available at the courthouse in Cumberland.\n\nMrs. Leonard's books abstract the first two volumes of Talbot County land records. Her index is particularly useful because it not only includes grantors and grantees, but also names of witnesses, adjacent property owners if mentioned in the deed and tract names."
