        "text": "Alfred Jerome Cadman\n\nCADMAN, SIR ALFRED JEROME (1847-1905), a son of Jerome Cadman (q.v.), was born in Sydney and came to Auckland with his parents as an infant. He received his education in the parish schools of St Paul's and St Matthew's and at Wesley College, after which he completed his term of apprenticeship as a carpenter under E. J. Matthews. As a young man he served in the volunteer forces during the war. At the age of 21 he entered the sawmilling business in Coromandel, and he did very well for many years. There he first entered public life as a member of the Tiki road board, of which he soon became chairman. He was chairman of the Coromandel county council for the first ten years. Cadman was elected to represent Coromandel in Parliament in 1881, and again in 1884 and 1887. In 1890 he was returned after a severe contest for a changed constituency under the name of Thames. Ballance invited him to join his cabinet (1891) as Commissioner of Stamp Duties, to which were presently added the portfolio of Native Affairs and in May 1892 that of Justice. As Native Minister he dealt sympathetically with the South Island tribes, and assisted to have a large area of land made available for their use. Owing to charges made against him by W. L. Rees in 1893 of using his position to benefit himself in connection with native lands, he challenged his accuser to resign and contest a seat. They both resigned on 20 Jul and, Rees choosing his own constituency of Auckland City, Cadman defeated him by 750 votes (4 Aug). He declined, however, to retain the administration of native affairs and assumed instead the portfolio of mines, to which was added later that of railways, then a difficult and exacting department.\n\nIn 1893 Cadman became member for Waikato and from 1896 for Ohinemuri. His health having been undermined by close application to the detail of his departments, he retired in 1899 and was called to the Legislative Council. He continued as a member of the cabinet without portfolio until Apr 1901, in which year he received the C.M.G. After his retirement he continued to take a keen interest in the development of ironsand on the west coast of the North Island, paying two visits to Great Britain to form a company. He was promoted K.C.M.G. in 1903. In Jul 1904 he was elected Speaker of the Council, but his health prevented him assuming the duties and he died a few months later (23 Mar 1905).\n\nCadman married (1886) Fanny, daughter of Joseph Bell (of Aylesbury, who arrived by the King of Italy and settled at Whangarei). She died 7 Apr 1892.\n\nN.Z.P.D., pass. (notably 27 Jun 1905); N.Z. Cycl., i (p); Reeves; Coromandel County Diamond Jubilee; N.Z. Herald, 15 Jul 1879; 24 Mar 1905. Portrait: General Assembly Library.\n\nReference: Volume 1, page 81\n\nðŸŒ³ Further sources\n\nDuncan Alexander Cameron\n\nCAMERON, SIR DUNCAN ALEXANDER (1808-88) was the son of Sir J. Cameron and obtained his first commission in the 42nd Highlanders in 1825. (Lieutenant, 1826; colonel 1854.) On the outbreak of the Crimean war he was made a local major-general in Turkey, and he commanded the 42nd regiment at the Alma and the Highland brigade at Balaklava. He was present at Kertch and the fall of Sebastopol.\n\nPromoted major-general and appointed to command in Scotland (1860), he came in the following year to New Zealand to succeed General Pratt (q.v.). On landing here Cameron found that the Imperial troops had been withdrawn from Taranaki and were working on the construction of military roads from Auckland to Waikato. He represented to the Governor (Grey) in 1862 that his force was insufficient for the forthcoming campaign. On hostilities being resumed over the Tataraimaka block he advanced with a force including the 57th and 70th regiments towards the enemy position at Katikara, which was carried on 4 Jun 1863.\n\nOn 12 Jul he initiated the advance from winter quarters at Pokeno and crossed the Mangatawhiri river, thereby opening the Waikato campaign. He personally led the 14th Regiment at Koheroa. After defeating the King forces at Meremere he was repulsed with severe loss at Rangiriri, where he ordered repeated assaults by military and naval detachments on an almost impregnable trench. On the following day (21 Jun) the defenders, under Tioriori, surrendered. The flag was hoisted at Ngaruawahia on 8 Dec and with a force of 3,000 men Cameron took possession of an important part of the Waikato, with headquarters at Tuhikaramea. The strong enemy position at Paterangi was cleverly outflanked by engagements at Rangiaowhia and Hairini. Cameron was not present when the operations against Orakau commenced, and he made an effort to induce the defenders to surrender but had to carry on the assault. After the fall of that place he conducted the assault on the enemy position at the Gate Pa. Though he had a force of 1,650 of all ranks, naval and military, the works were not destroyed by the artillery preparation and he was severely repulsed, with the loss of 31 killed and 80 wounded (29 Apr). He inflicted heavy losses on the enemy at Te Ranga (21 Jun), but the defenders withdrew under cover of night and escaped.\n\nEarly in 1865 Cameron opened the campaign to take possession of the Waitotara block. Advancing cautiously along the coast he left the strong position of Weraroa in his rear. Attacked in broad daylight at Nukumaru, he suffered some losses. Thereafter he kept away from the bush, but again the natives drove in his pickets. He moved northward with 2,300 of all arms, crossed the Waitotara river, and built redoubts to hold the country. Governor Grey pointed out the danger of leaving the Hauhau post at Weraroa in his rear, but Cameron protested he had not sufficient force to reduce it. After an acrimonious correspondence the Wanganui native contingent offered to assault the pa, Colonel Waddy moved 400 troops up in support and colonial troops outflanked the pa, which was abandoned and captured. Cameron inflicted some losses on the rearguard of the enemy at Kakaramea and continued his march to the Waingongoro river. There he deemed it advisable to turn back owing to the difficulty of provisioning the force on an open coast. He accordingly stationed 750 troops at Patea and, having garrisoned the redoubts, left for Auckland.\n\nCameron disliked the field tactics of the Hauhau and disapproved of the war, which he believed was being deliberately waged for the benefit of the settlers. In Feb 1865 he resigned and returned to England, with the approval of the War Office and the thanks of the Legislative Council of New Zealand. He became lieut.-general 1868; general 1874; governor of Sandhurst College 1868-75; G.C.B. 1873. He died on 7 Jun 1888.\n\nD.N.B.; App. H.R., 1861-66; Cowan; Rusden; Gudgeon (p); Rees; Gisborne; Gorton.\n\nReference: Volume 1, page 83\n\nðŸŒ³ Further sources\n\nJohn Logan Campbell\n\nCAMPBELL, SIR JOHN LOGAN (1817-1912) was born at Edinburgh, the son of Dr John Campbell and grandson of Sir James Campbell, of Aberuchill and Kilbryde, Perthshire. He was educated at the Edinburgh High School and at the University, where he graduated M.D. and F.R.C.S. He gained a commission in the East India Company, but changed his plans and decided to come to the colonies. He sailed for Australia as surgeon-superintendent of the Palmyra in 1839, and during a few months in that country visited the Bathurst and Lachlan districts. Attracted by reports of the projected colony in New Zealand, he crossed in the Lady Lilford early in 1840 and at Coromandel joined William Brown (q.v.), who had been a passenger in the Palmyra. Together they prospected the neighbourhood of Hauraki Gulf and Waitemata and eventually purchased from the natives Motukorea (afterwards called Brown's Island). There they erected a habitation which they occupied until the foundation of Auckland, when they moved thither and acquired central sections at the first sale of town lots. Brown and Campbell started business in Shortland Street in Dec 1840, and were soon leading merchants, with agents in the more important settlements of the north. In 1844 they loaded the barque Bolina with the first cargo of New Zealand produce for the English market, Brown proceeding thither as a passenger. In 1844 Campbell was offered a seat in the Legislative Council, but he declined owing to the demands of his own business. The firm had taken the main responsibility in establishing a newspaper, the Southern Cross, which had been managed by Brown since its first appearance early in 1843. It did not pay, and during the depression its finances made serious leeway. Campbell consequently suspended publication (Apr 1845). On Brown's return the state of public affairs made the revival of the Southern Cross imperative (1847).\n\nHis partner now taking control of the business, Campbell in 1848 left on his first visit to England. He spent many months travelling in the East and in Europe and did not return to New Zealand till 1850. In the following year he left again on a visit to San Francisco and was a witness of the burning of that city. He then took a renewed interest in New Zealand affairs, and on 21 Sep 1852 was elected by the Auckland Suburbs constituency to the Legislative Council of New Ulster. The functioning of that body was forestalled by the promulgation of the new constitution in 1853. Campbell did not stand for election to the first legislative bodies either in the province or at the capital. His partner, however, contested the superintendency of Auckland against Colonel Wynyard (Jul 1853) and in Aug 1854 was elected to Parliament for the City. When Wynyard resigned the superintendency (Jan 1855) Brown was elected, and he held office to the end of the year. In the midst of a political crisis he had to leave on a visit to Scotland. Campbell was elected to Parliament in his stead (Oct 1855) and, by defeating F. Whitaker (q.v.) by 99 votes, he became superintendent of the province (15 Nov). He was a member of Stafford's executive without portfolio (Jun to Nov 1856) and meanwhile judiciously managed the affairs of the province until Sep 1856, when he resigned both the superintendency and his parliamentary seat to pay another visit to Great Britain.\n\nAgain Campbell spent many months travelling on the Continent and in the East. When he heard of the outbreak of the mutiny in India he proceeded there hastily in order to join his fiancee, Emma, daughter of Sir John Cracroft Wilson (q.v.). He reached Cawnpore in time to witness the marching out of Sir Colin Campbell's force to the relief of Lucknow, and was married at Meerut. On his return to New Zealand in 1860 he was again elected to Parliament, but retained the seat only from Aug till the dissolution in Nov. In 1862 he again proceeded to England, and for the next 10 years the family lived mostly in Europe. In 1871 Campbell returned to Auckland as resident partner of the firm, of which three years later he became sole proprietor. He took a prominent part in the development of many other commercial undertakings in New Zealand. His firm having had built for their own business the paddle steamer Golden Crown, he became interested in the formation of the New Zealand Shipping Co. He was a promoter and director also of the Bank of New Zealand, the New Zealand Insurance Co., the New Zealand Loan and Mercantile Agency Co., and the Thames Valley and Rotorua Railway Co. (of which he was chairman). In 1847 he had helped to found the Auckland Savings Bank, of which he was secretary for some years. He was president of the Northern Club, the Auckland Institute, the chamber of commerce and the Auckland education board. In 1856 he organised the first volunteer corps, the New Zealand Rifles.\n\nCampbell showed a keen interest in the cultural well-being of his city. In 1877 he established the free school of art, which he maintained until the founding of the Elam School of Art in 1889. At an early period he acquired a considerable area of land close to the centre of the town with the intention of preserving it from the inevitable encroachment of the city's expansion. On 24 Apr 1901 he was elected mayor in view of the approaching visit of the Duke and Duchess of Cornwall and York, and in commemoration of that occasion he presented to the city a generous gift of 300 acres of this land, now known as Cornwall Park. Amongst his other public gifts were a free kindergarten and a creche. He was knighted in 1902 and in 1906 a statue erected in his honour by the city was unveiled. Campbell published in 1881 an attractive book of reminiscences entitled Poenamu. He was an amateur photographer of outstanding talent.\n\nCampbell died on 22 Jun 1912 and was buried on the summit of Maungakiekie.\n\nN.Z.P.D., 1856; 26 Jun, 4 Jul and 7 Aug 1912; Auckland P.C.

Cargill, was born at Edinburgh, and received his education in Edinburgh, and afterwards (when his father moved to the east of England) at the Grammar School at Norwich and at Perone's School. At the age of 14 he was apprenticed to the sea in the mercantile marine. There he spent six years, visiting Australia and the Far East. In 1844, having attained his majority, he settled down at Colombo (Ceylon) in the service of the Bank of Western India (afterwards the Oriental Bank). From this he moved into a mercantile office, and eventually went into business as Dowdall, Cargill and Co. Later they took into partnership Andrew Nicol, brother of the founder of the Bombay firm of W. Nicol and Co., and they continued to trade under the name of Nicols, Cargill and Co.\n\nCargill moved to Melbourne where he was in business (1855-57) as Eastern importers. In 1858 he settled in Dunedin. For the first two years after landing he was in partnership with John Jones as Jones, Cargill, and Co., merchants, shipping agents and shipowners. This was dissolved in 1861, and Cargill was then joined by his brother John. On the discovery of gold their business expanded rapidly, though they had the misfortune to be burned out in Dec 1861, and again in Feb 1864. In 1859 they purchased the paddle steamer Geelong, which was the first steamer to ply, under a provincial contract, between Lyttelton, Dunedin and Invercargill. The City of Dunedin, specially built for the firm, was delivered in 1863, after the dissolution of the partnership, but Cargill retained his interest in her. Jones and Cargill together projected the Otago Steam Navigation Co. for which ships were built on the Clyde to run in the intercolonial trade. The first of these, the Scotia, arrived in Mar 1864, but on her first voyage to Melbourne ran ashore near the Bluff. The Albion arrived in the same year and was sold for service in the East. The City of Dunedin sank in Jun 1865 and the Geelong near Whangape in 1878. The firm of Cargill and Co. was the first to import sugar direct from Mauritius (1862), and imported some of the earliest tea shipments direct from China. They were agents for the Scottish firm of Patrick Henderson and Co., whose ships carried emigrants under the Otago provincial government scheme. For some time G. McLean (q.v.) was in the firm (then Cargill and McLean) and on his retirement W. C. Gibbs came in (Cargill, Gibbs and Co.). In 1881 the business was purchased by the British and New Zealand Mortgage and Agency Co. (formed for this purpose by Cargill, Tolmie, Gibbs, Joachim and others). The company, which had investments in station lands in Otago, suffered heavily in the slump of the eighties, and was wound up in 1889. Cargill lost severely, and he was disappointed also in the meat-preserving works at Green Island, in which he had invested much money. Discouraged by these misfortunes, he retired from business. He was a director of the New Zealand Refrigerating Co., the Mosgiel Woollen Co., the Union Steamship Co. (on the first board), the Trustees, Estate and Agency Co., the Westport Coal Co., and the old City and Suburban Tramway Co., and a founder of the National Insurance Co. and the Colonial Bank (of which he was for two years president).\n\nIn the first Otago Provincial Council Cargill represented Western District (1862-63). In the next Council (1863) he sat for Dunedin and was for a month or so provincial secretary; but he was defeated at the general election in 1867. He again successfully contested the seat in 1871, and was again in the executive, but was defeated in 1873. In the Council he introduced resolutions aiming at the free selection of land in the interior of the province, but they were withdrawn in favour of another scheme. In Parliament Cargill represented Bruce (1862-65), retiring at the general election. He stood for Dunedin Central in 1887, but was defeated by Fitchett. He was a member of the old Dunedin town board, of the Otago harbour board and of the city school committee. In 1870-71 he was a member of the City Council. When the jubilee of the province was about to be celebrated Cargill, as a son of the first Superintendent, was mayor of Dunedin (1897-98). Education always had in him a strong supporter. He was a member of the High School board of governors and of the council of Otago University (1869-1903), and a vice-chancellor (1894-1903). Cargill was a strong supporter of Knox Church, of which he was an elder, and the last survivor of the first kirk session.\n\nCargill was unwittingly the originator of the term 'Old Identity.' Having in public utterance exhorted the original settlers to stand together to preserve their identity, he was made the butt of a joke by Thatcher, the comedian, who represented him as 'an Old Identity.' Cargill married (1854) Dorothy (d. 1889), daughter of Dr Nesham, of Newcastle-on-Tyne. His death occurred on 9 Aug 1903.\n\nOtago P.C. Proc.; NZP.D.; Cycl. N.Z., iv(p); Ross; McIndoe; Otago Daily Times, 8 May 1872, 10 Aug 1903, 17 May 1930 (P). Portrait: Parliament House.\n\nReference: Volume 1, page 86\n\nðŸŒ³ Further sources\n\nWilliam Walter Cargill\n\nCARGILL, WILLIAM WALTER (1784-1860) was born in Edinburgh and was descended from the Scottish Covenanter Donald Cargill, who was beheaded in 1681. His father was James Cargill, a writer to the signet, and the boy had a Scots tutor, Thomas Chalmers, who was later a famous divine. He also attended the Edinburgh High School.\n\nAt the age of 18 Cargill received an ensigncy in the 84th Foot, and went to Calcutta to join his regiment. At the battle of Assaye (Sep 1803) the casualties suffered by the 74th Highlanders provided promotion, and Cargill was appointed a lieutenant in that regiment. After spending four years in India he returned to England, and in 1810 the regiment went to the Peninsula, where he served for four years. Severely wounded at Busaco, he was invalided to England, but soon returned to his regiment as captain and fought through to the concluding victory at Toulouse. In 1813 he married at Oporto, Mary Ann, daughter of Lieutenant Yates, R.N. After the peace of 1814 the regiment returned to Ireland and eventually to Scotland, and in 1820 Cargill retired, with the Peninsula medal and seven clasps.\n\nCargill now thought of going abroad, but the family strongly opposed the idea, and he went into business in Edinburgh as a wine merchant. In 1834 he joined the service of the Yorkshire District Bank, in charge of one of its branches. In 1836 he became general manager for the East of England, with headquarters at Norwich. In 1841 he resigned and joined the board of the Oriental Banking Corporation in London. His attention was attracted by the correspondence of George Rennie in the Colonial Gazette in 1842 regarding the proposed Scots settlement in New Zealand. He got into touch with Rennie and for a year or two worked in close conjunction with him to further the scheme of a Free Church colony. The New Zealand Company favoured the project, and the Assembly of the Free Church of Scotland adopted it. When Cargill paid for two sections in New Zealand (Jul 1843) he gave his address as 'Bombay, India.' Troubles arose at both ends, and the Otago scheme was suspended for about four years.\n\nWhen eventually the pioneers sailed in the John Wickliffe, with Cargill as their leader, he was already 64 years of age, with a military career of 17 years completed fully a generation earlier. But he had the ripe, shrewd sagacity which a body of Scots wanted in their leader. \"I almost believe,\" said Sir George Grey some time later, \"that a more wise and sagacious man than Captain Cargill never existed.\" In spite of his Nonconformist tradition and upbringing, Cargill was not more narrow than a man of nearly three score and ten years must necessarily be. If he opposed innovations that were wildly liberal, he also resisted some which were too liberal for the good of posterity. When the constitution of 1852 came into force (1853) Cargill waited anxiously for weeks and months after the other provinces lest his Council should take any step in the appropriation of moneys that was not fully justified by the law. He was elected Superintendent without opposition; and re-elected without opposition for a new term (1855-60). For part of the time he was also a member of Parliament, representing the Dunedin Country District (1855-60). Tried by the opposition of a small but able party within the province, Cargill showed a tendency to obduracy with his Council, which was obviously the result of advancing years. He steadfastly contended for his dignity and his prerogative and chafed sorely in the harness of responsible government, under which all his utterances to the Council had to be composed or approved by his executive before he delivered them. Accused of nepotism in circumstances which left him little option but to promote some of his influential and brainy sons-in-law, he said (Oct 1857): \"This I say because of the untruthful ribaldries that are on this occasion being circulated. Nepotism and family clique are words that must indeed be a farce, in the face of the Otago public, whose Superintendent and sons-in-law have been so openly opposed to each other in politics, and that with perfect independence on either side. Truly there never has been, and on my part never shall be, a vestige of favour or affection in any such matters. But neither am I to be scared from public duty by any such missiles as I have referred to. I would have all to know that I am in no degree to be swayed from doing what I have a right to doâ€”to put the right man into the right placeâ€”whether that man might happen to be my son-in-law or anyone else.\" A greater insult to the veteran was the suggestion that he was old. \"This at least is the truth,\" he admitted in a message to the council, \"and to the curious in such matters I shall give a gauge not easily forgotten. Your Superintendent is just 50 days older than Lord Palmerston, and can look back upon half a century when, as a humble sub, he had occasion to correspond with his lordship, then Secretary at War. Subsequent experience must have taught him something of public matters, but he will only notice that the last 14 years have been extremely devoted to the planting and progression of this colony, in whose advancing prosperity he greatly rejoices, and I should therefore lament its passing under the slashing regime of a young assistantâ€”young, at least, in experienceâ€”and whose first vaunted steps would be a breach of the law.\" Cargill held office for two years longer. He handed over the superintendency to Macandrew on 3 Jan 1860, and several months later resigned his seat in Parliament. He died on 6 Aug 1860 and his widow on 26 Oct 1871. (See E. B. CARGILL, JOHN CARGILL and WILLIAM H. CUTTEN.)\n\nN.Z.C. (Otago Association); Otago Witness, Mar 1898 (p); Otago P.C. Proc.; Arnold; Cox; Reeves; Hocken, Otago; Gisborne; Cycl.

Though born in England, he was of Irish descent. Educated at Eton (under Dr Keate), he was admitted to Trinity College, Cambridge, in 1828, with the promise of high classical distinction, but his studies were interrupted by rustication as the result of what he called \"an affair of honour with the long carpenter,\" arising out of a town-and-gown disturbance. He pulled No. 4 in the Privateer for Trinity in 1831, when it bumped Lady Margaret (Bishop Selwyn pulling No 7), which had been head of the river for three terms.\n\nProceeding to London, Carleton studied in the Middle Temple under Sir John Bailey, but took a dislike to law and was never called. Instead he went to Italy to study art and spent the greater part of three years in travelling. He came to Auckland in 1845, and was employed for a while by Brown and Campbell. Then he engaged in commercial speculations, notably the importation of stock from Australia, for which he chartered a small vessel, the Orwell. She made three unprofitable voyages, and ended her career by being cast away on the Orwell Bank at Manukau (Mar 1848). At intervals Carleton took part in editing the New Zealander, which advocated the rights of the pre-emption land claimants and FitzRoy's grantees. Then he established on his own account (Apr 1848) the Anglo-Maori Warder, in opposition to the government of the day. In spite of Carleton's ignorance of business, it paid its way for about six months, and then closed down. Carleton next turned his attention in a desultory manner towards the South Seas, and saw much of the islands of Fiji. William Brown having decided to despatch the schooner Noble to San Francisco, agreed to take Carleton with him as a cabin passenger. When Carleton was ashore at Pitcairn island the vessel was blown off and he spent three weeks on the island awaiting a chance to leave. During this time, it is said, he amused himself teaching the natives part singing. He was picked up by the Colonist (Capt. Marshall, from whom he had previously chartered the Haidee), and reached San Francisco some time ahead of the Noble but in some difficulty owing to the absence of his property.\n\nReturning to New Zealand in time for the first election of the General Assembly, Carleton was elected member for Bay of Islands, which he represented continuously from 1853 to 1870, when he was regarded as \"the father of the House.\" He took a prominent part in the controversy regarding responsible government, and acquired a reputation as a polished and highly cultured speaker, though inclined to be ponderous and dogmatic. A marked attitude of superiority, and a facility in several languages, with which he freely adorned his speeches, militated against his political popularity. Responsible government at that stage he considered a mistake. Carleton did not enter the first Auckland Provincial Council, but at the general election in Oct 1855 he was returned for Bay of Islands. Here, too, he took a prominent part in the early struggles, exciting opposition often by his obvious attainments. He was provincial secretary for most of the year 1856 (under the Superintendency of Campbell) and again (1864-66) under Graham and Whitaker. He represented Bay of Islands (1855-57), the City of Auckland (1859-61), Newton (1861-65) and Bay of Islands again (1865-75). As early as 1858 he supported the new provinces bill in the hope of destroying the provincial system by subdivision. Having taken his part in defeating the Sewell government in 1856, Carleton supported Fox for the sake of his waste lands policy; then supported Stafford and voted for the compact. In 1856 he took charge (as editor) of the Southern Cross, to which he had long been a contributor. He had strong views against the Waitara war, but supported Stafford because he felt himself pledged to a general support. Next year he gave his casting vote to put the government out. He agitated for direct purchase of native lands, thus destroying the government monopoly.\n\nHaving paid a visit to England, from which he returned in 1864, Carleton found Stafford in office and supported him. For a period of 14 years (1856-70) he acted as chairman of committees in the House. At the general election in 1870 he was defeated for Bay of Islands by John McLeod, the lessee of the coalmines, and this practically closed his political career. He was nominated again in 1878 for the Eden seat, which he could have won if he had pledged himself to support Grey, but he answered that \"if he were to follow any man blindfolded it was not worth having the seat.\" A scholarly man even amongst many fine classical scholars in the early Parliaments of New Zealand, Carleton nevertheless had limitations of manner which were politically disastrous. He knew nothing of compromise, and was often considered \"crochety\" in his fine distinctions and punctilio. His speeches, though at times they struck a high note of oratory and sentiment, often bored the House. Nor was he a stranger to invective, as witness his scathing indictment (during the debates on responsible government) of Edward Gibbon Wakefield's sense of honour.\n\nOn retiring from politics Carleton lived quietly at his home at Pakaraka, Bay of Islands, only emerging to maintain his steady interest in higher education. As early as 1851 he had urged the establishment in each province of a secular university supported by the state. In 1871 he was elected vice-chancellor of the University of New Zealand, a position which he occupied until his departure for England in 1880, and was one of the leaders of the successful struggle against the foundation of a single university institution in Otago. He represented the university at the tercentenary celebrations of the University of Edinburgh (1884). Carleton spent the last ten years of his life in England, and when he died on 14 Jul 1890, he had been almost forgotten in the Colony. He married on 30 Nov 1859 Lydia Jane (1835-91), daughter of Archdeacon Henry Williams (q.v.).\n\nCarleton's life of Archdeacon Henry Williams is an important, though controversial, contribution to the early history of New Zealand. He published several controversial pamphlets.\n\nAuckland P.C. Proc.; N.Z.P.D., pass.; Registry of Cambridge University; Thomson; Rusden; Beaglehole; P. A.

Besides owning a large tract of land at Hurumua, he engaged in business as a blacksmith and kept several small schooners for whaling. He married Tapuke, a chieftainess of the Wairoa hapu of Ngati-Kahungunu.\n\nJames was born at Wairoa on 20 Aug 1857, the youngest child of the family. He spent his childhood in the Urewera under leading tohungas, and at the age of six was sent to Thomson's school at Napier. He showed no aptitude for study, spoke little English and at the age of 12 returned to work on his father's station. In 1869 he enlisted with the native allies (under F. E. Hamlin) in pursuit of Te Kooti; in every skirmish with the enemy he behaved in all cases with great steadiness, and for his services received the war medal and a bonus of Â£50. Then he spent 18 months as a cadet under Locke, native commissioner and magistrate for the East Coast. McLean transferred him to the native office in Wellington, and a year later he was licensed as an interpreter and attached to the native land court under Judge Rogan. In 1879 he was appointed interpreter in the House of Representatives, where he gained a close acquaintance with the forms of parliament and became a fluent speaker.\n\nIn 1883 Carroll resigned to contest the Eastern Maori seat, but was defeated by Wi Pere by 23 votes. Declining to return to his old post, he became thoroughly intimate with the needs of his people, and in 1887 he defeated Pere by 200 votes. He held the seat continuously until 1894, when he was elected for the European constituency of Waiapu (afterwards Gisborne), defeating De Lautour by 497 votes. That seat he held for 25 years. Meanwhile Carroll had a distinguished career. In 1892 he was appointed a member of the executive representing the native race, and he held that position throughout the Ballance and Seddon administrations. From 1896 he was also Commissioner of Stamps and in Dec 1899 he became Minister of Native Affairs. His native policy was conservative and he carried some important measures extending native government, notably the Maori councils act 1900. His object was to conserve and extend the remaining rights of the Maori and to encourage the co-operative farming of their lands. Carroll had a dignified personality, was a fluent speaker, practised in the imagery of Maori lore, and equally eloquent in English. He had great influence and mana, and did much to make the Maori better understood by the pakeha. He continued in office throughout the Hall Jones and Ward administrations and was for some years the senior member of the Cabinet. In 1911 he was created K.C.M.G.\n\nReverting to the position of a private member when the Liberal government was defeated in 1912, he lost his seat to Lysnar at the election of 1919, and two years later was called to the Legislative Council by the Massey government. Carroll attended one of the conferences in London of the Empire Parliamentary Association. He died on 18 Oct 1926, nine days after delivering an eloquent oration at the grave of his friend Sir William Herries (q.v.). He married early in life Heni Materoa, who survived him until 1 Nov 1930. There were no children, but Sir James and Lady Carroll brought up about thirty foster children.\n\nParltry Record; Army department record of war service; N.Z.P.D.

He was intended for a profession and went to Samuel Marshall's school (1835-6) but became interested in the intelligence from New Zealand. He was an ardent Chartist and a radical reformer. While working at Newcastle and Gateshead (1839-43) he attended the exhibition of arts, manufactures and practical science and took classes in drawing.\n\nGoing to London in 1843, Carter was a good deal out of employment and made use of his leisure by studying in the Westminster Literary Institute. He was interested in working-class politics and was secretary of the movement which resulted in many London shops stopping work at 4 p.m. on Saturdays. Inspired by the Liberal risings in Europe, he wrote many letters to the papers in favour of emigration to New Zealand. He was now employed as a builder's principal foreman. When news reached London of the earthquake in New Zealand (1848) he wrote an article on the defective building construction then prevalent in Wellington.\n\nIn 1850 Carter married Jane Robieson (or Robertson), of Turriff, Aberdeenshire, and sailed for New Zealand in the Eden. He at once entered into business as a builder, erected a fine country house for Fitzherbert, and in 1853 began to practise as a surveyor and valuer. He helped to form the No 1 Building Society and became interested in politics as a supporter of Featherston and the Constitutional Association. He was nominated for the Provincial Council in 1853 but withdrew on accepting a government contract for the first reclamation in the harbour. In March of that year he attended the first public meeting with the object of forming a small farms association. W. Allen (q.v.) presided and Masters (q.v.) and Carter were on the committee. Carter saw the project through, and was eventually liquidator of the association (1858). In 1853 he purchased Wilson's brickyard. In 1855 he was one of the two members of the earthquake commission, and was responsible for the report (presented to the Superintendent on 4 Sep 1855). He was an active promoter of the first Steam Navigation Co., which purchased the Wonga Wonga and afterwards the Stormbird, paid 10 per cent. per annum and returned to shareholders Â£19 for every Â£10 share. In 1857 a petition was sent to the Provincial Council asking for another small farm settlement to be proclaimed and to be named Cartervale. ('Carterton' was duly proclaimed on 26 July 1859).\n\nCarter and Borlase were elected to the Provincial Council for Wairarapa, defeating Revans and Jackson. In the political duel between Wakefield and Featherston he supported the Superintendent. In 1859 Carter was elected to represent Wairarapa in the House of Representatives, in which he sat until 1865. He retired from the Provincial Council in 1859 on accepting a contract for the bridge over the Waiohine, but was re-elected unopposed. At the end of 1863 Carter sailed for England, where he acted as immigration agent for the province and negotiated on behalf of the Provincial Council for the patent slip in Evans Bay and the iron bridge over the Wanganui river. During his absence he resigned from both Council and Parliament. Carter suggested to the people of Greytown to create an educational trust out of unselected town sections (a plan afterwards adopted in Masterton). In 1866 he published the first of a three-volume autobiography which gives a valuable insight into life and politics in early Wellington. He lived for some years in England, being employed by the agent general as immigration officer (1871-74). On his wife's death he returned to New Zealand, and died on 22 Jul 1896.\n\nCarter, op cit.; Cycl. N.Z., i; Wellington P.C. Proc. and Gaz.; N.Z.P.D.; Wakelin; Wellington Independent, 13 Jan 1860.

He received his education at Christ's Hospital, where he was for four years on the Royal Mathematical foundation. On leaving school he went to sea, and for the next three years sailed chiefly in the East India trade. On returning home he studied architecture and surveying and was an assistant in the tithe commission office at Somerset House. This involved much surveying and land valuing, and Cass received a thorough grounding in field work.\n\nIn 1841, on the recommendation of Captain Dawson, R.E., he was appointed to the surveying staff of the New Zealand Company at a salary of Â£200 a year. Ligar (the surveyor general), embarked with his staff in Apr 1841, in the Prince Rupert (owned and commanded by Sir Henry Esch Atkinson). Amongst the passengers was William Spain (chief land claims commissioner). Provisions ran short and Atkinson put into Bahia. On 4 Sep, when about to enter Table Bay, the Prince Rupert struck a rock and became a total wreck. Cass and the other surveyors, who lost much of their outfit, were brought on by the Antilla and reached Auckland in Dec. For some months Cass was employed on surveys under the land claims commission, first on the north shore of Waitemata harbour and then in the vicinity of Bay of Islands. He assisted in surveying the town of Kororareka, exploring the country to the northward, and cutting lines for the roads to Hokianga, Whangaroa and Mangonui.\n\nAt the end of 1844 a reduction of the survey staff threw him out of employment, and he joined the government brig Victoria, first as second officer and then as chief. He saw much rough work, and not a little fighting, first in connection with the sack of Kororareka (1845) and later in the operations about Cook Strait. While on the coast of the South Island Cass took in custody to Auckland men who had stuck up the Greenwoods' station at Purau and threatened the Deans family at Riccarton. In 1847 he returned to England. There he represented to the New Zealand Company the loss he had sustained by the termination of his employment, and as a result he was appointed assistant-surveyor under Captain Thomas to prepare for the Canterbury settlement. Sailing in the Bernicia, he reached Canterbury in Dec 1848, the other members of the party being E. Jollie, C. O. Torlesse, Gollan, S. Hewlings and John Boys. In 1849 Cass took part in the survey of Lyttelton harbour and Banks Peninsula, and then in the triangulation of the Canterbury Block. His name was given to a river flowing out of the Alps, a peak in Banks Peninsula and one of the bays in Port Cooper.\n\nShortly after the arrival of the Canterbury pilgrims Thomas retired and Cass succeeded him as chief surveyor (1851). He was present at the first allotment of town and country lands and until failing health compelled him to retire on pension (1868) Cass administered the post with efficiency and vigour. In 1854 he went to the site of Timaru and with W. Brittan reported on the steps that were necessary. Though holding an official position Cass was not debarred from membership of the Provincial Council. He was one of the first members for the City of Christchurch (Sep 1853). Standing for cheap land and improved communications, he polled 77 votes, followed by S Bealey 74, Packer 71, Fooks 51, Dobson 21. He retired from the Council in 1855, but was in again (1857-60). He was repeatedly a member of the provincial executive and on two occasions led an executive of his own. In 1858 he was on a commission appointed by Moorhouse to report upon the best route for the railway to the port. In 1853, with Sewell and the Rev R. B. Paul, he fixed the site for Christ's College. For 10 years Cass was a commissioner of the waste land board, and from 1858 a commissioner of native reserves. After retiring from the council he was several times in the executive, and again in 1863 he led an executive. In 1864 he was chairman of the railway and bridge commission.\n\nCox remarks that Cass was 'the lightest-hearted and youngest man that ever went through 30 years of the toughest work.' On retiring he paid a visit to Great Britain. There again his services were requisitioned as emigration officer (until 1868). Returning to Canterbury, he served another three years on the waste lands board. He was for many years a church warden at St Michael's.\n\nCass married (1856) the widow of David Theodore Williams, manager of the Deans estate. She died in 1886. Cass died on 17 Apr 1895.\n\nN.Z.C.; Canterbury P.C.

The elder Chapman was secretary and afterwards one of the higher officials under the American loyalist general, Oliver de Lancey.\n\nYoung Chapman was educated partly at the private school of Mr Peters at Bromley, in Kent, and partly on the continent. Owing to defective eyesight, he left school at an early age, but he cultivated a love of literature, and on the Continent and in Canada acquired a good facility in French and German. He also indulged in rowing and skating. Chapman first took a position with Esdaile's Bank in London, but soon transferred to the office of a Dutch financial agent in the city. In 1822 he was sent on a mission to Holland, where he profited by a winter spent in Amsterdam to acquire a knowledge of Dutch. In 1823, while still in his teens, he commenced his colonial career as a merchant in Quebec, with connections in England and New York. In Canada he spent 10 years, doing well enough without amassing a fortune. Each winter he visited England, keeping in touch with old friends, and in particular with John Stuart Mill. In summer he made extended business tours in North America, which had a profound influence upon his later life. On a steamboat excursion on the lakes in 1824, he made the acquaintance of John A. Roebuck, with whom he was afterwards closely associated.\n\nIn 1833 Chapman went again to Canada. Impressed with the justice of the Canadian demand for self-government, he took a printing press and settled down in Montreal, where, with Revans (q.v.), he established the Montreal Daily Advertiser. He did most of the literary work himself for the Advertiser and other papers issued from the same office. His friendship with Papineau, the Liberal leader, ripened; and through him Chapman made his first public speech in French. The paper was intensely disliked by the dominant party and did not achieve permanent success. In 1834 Chapman disposed of his interest and returned to England as the agent of the Liberal parliamentary party in Canada. This brought him into close touch with leading reformers of the time (including Buller, Ricardo, Mill, E. G. Wakefield, and Dr Evans). He assisted Roebuck in the compilation of his pamphlets (in every number of which he had an article) and in other ways promoted the demand of the Canadian Liberals for representative government. When Roebuck got into Parliament again in 1837 he became the parliamentary agent for the Canadian Liberals, as Burke had been of the American loyalists, and with the changes resulting from the Papineau rebellion, Chapman's arrangement came to an end. He then devoted himself more to journalism and the writing of pamphlets in the cause of colonial reform. It has been suggested that Chapman had an active part in the Papineau rising, but he had left Canada two years earlier, and was in no way involved. He always regarded the resort to arms as a mistake. Revans, however, was deeply involved and fled from Canada. In the late thirties Chapman read for the bar as the pupil of Dodgson, an eminent pleader, and he was called at the Middle Temple on 12 Jun 1840. A week earlier he was married to Catherine, daughter of T. G. Brewer, barrister, of Nottingham place. As a beginner, Chapman had a fair practice on the Northern Circuit, but he still relied for his main income upon journalism, writing to the reviews and many pamphlets on economics. This work, about 1832, brought him into close touch with Cobden. A lifelong free-trader, he took an active part in the anti-corn law agitation. He was also employed on various royal commissions, including that relating to the condition of the handloom weavers of Yorkshire. This experience resulted in his being asked to write the article on wool and woollen manufacturing in the Encyclopaedia Britannica, the mechanical drawings for which he did himself. He then pointed out to the editor that New Zealand had been omitted from the work, and he was commissioned to write it. But, as the letter 'N' had been passed the article had to be placed under 'Z'. Chapman was deeply interested in the New Zealand project of Wakefield, and in Feb 1840 published the first issue of his New Zealand Journal, which he brought out continuously (as editor and owner-proprietor) until the middle of 1843. Owing to the indifferent health of his wife he contemplated living in New Zealand. The opportunity came in 1843, when Lord Derby appointed him a judge of the Supreme Court for the southern division (which included Wellington and Nelson). He sailed with his wife and son in the Bangalore in Jun 1843 (amongst the passengers being Governor FitzRoy). At Sydney Chapman renewed his acquaintance with Robert Lowe (afterwards Lord Sherbrooke). While there he reported favourably to the government on the system of having a resident judge at Port Phillip. At Auckland on 26 Dec the Governor and the judge took their oaths of office. Chapman lived at Wellington for the next nine years. During the native troubles of 1846 his home at Karori was one of the defensive posts against possible attacks. When the two judges (Martin, C.J., and Chapman) had to confer on the making of rules they met in Taranaki. The vessel in which Chapman took his passage landed him at Kawhia from which he had to walk back to New Plymouth and later to Wellington.\n\nIn 1852, unsought by himself, Chapman was appointed Colonial Secretary in Van Diemen's Land (under the governorship of Denison). There he found public opinion highly incensed against the Colonial Office and the Governor on the question of transportation. When a division was forced in the Council lifelong convictions compelled Chapman to side with the colonists, and he declined to vote. Denison was furious at the recalcitrance of his new official, and Chapman had to sacrifice his post to his convictions and proceed on leave to London to place his case before the Colonial Office. Transportation was soon abolished and responsible government granted later to both Tasmania and Victoria. Having declined a governorship in the West Indies, Chapman in 1854 took passage in the Lightning to Victoria, and engaged in a lucrative practice in Melbourne. In 1855 he was elected to the Legislative Council (still partly nominated) for the district of South Bourke. The Ballarat riots brought him into prominence as counsel for some of the accused, who were acquitted. In the last session of the Council in 1855 Chapman and others tried to have inserted in the reform bill provision for the ballot system of voting. It was carried against the government with the assistance of the votes of eight members sent from the goldfields (including Vincent Pyke, q.v.). Chapman's part in this episode proved to be of considerable future importance. When the vote was carried against the government the Attorney-general (Stawell) refused to draft the ballot clauses. Nicholson, the merchant who had carried the resolution, was unable to do so, and a meeting of his supporters appointed Chapman to draw the clauses. The result was the scheme now known as 'the Australian ballot.' It discarded the method of the voter putting a mark against the name of the favoured candidate, in favour of striking out the names of those not favoured. This idea was Chapman's.\n\nAt the first elections under the new constitution (1856) Chapman was defeated, but in Mar 1857 O'Shanassy persuaded him to accept office as Attorney-general, and a seat was soon found for him (for Rodney) by the resignation of Mr Baragwanath. The ministry lasted only four or five weeks. Within a year the succeeding government was defeated and Chapman was entrusted with the formation of a ministry. O'Shanassy again became Premier, and remained there for 18 months. He was on bad terms with the Governor (Sir Henry Barkly), and the ministry was kept together mainly by the tact of the Attorney-general. The government's defeat in Oct 1859 practically marked the end of Chapman's political career. He was returned late in 1861 as member for Mornington, but a few months later was appointed a temporary puisne judge. After serving on the bench for a considerable time he returned to his practice and resumed an appointment he had previously held as lecturer in law at Melbourne University (where he was vice-president of the forensic society). In journalism he was Melbourne correspondent of the London Times.\n\nEarly in 1864 Chapman accepted a new appointment to the New Zealand bench and in Apr took up his duties at Dunedin, where he was to live for the remainder of his life. Besides earning credit for sound law and patient and painstaking administration of his office, he took a keen interest in the Otago community. He was a member of the council of Otago University (1870-81) and chancellor (1876-79). He was a strong supporter of the Otago Institute, before which he read an important paper on the political economy of railways. He was a lover and patron of music in all its forms. In business life he was a director of the Victoria Insurance Co. after his retirement from the bench, and for a while he had an interest in a run in the Maniatoto district.\n\nEarly in 1866 Mrs Chapman and two of her sons and a daughter were drowned when the ship London foundered in the Bay of Biscay. In 1868 Chapman married (in Victoria) Selina Frances, daughter of the Rev T. C. Carr, rector of Aghavoe, Queen's county, Ireland, and a sister of the police magistrate at Avoca. He visited England and returned to New Zealand in 1870. Five years later he retired from the bench. He was granted the title of 'honourable' in 1877. He died on 27 Dec 1881 and his widow on 27 Dec 1902. (See SIR FREDERICK CHAPMAN.)\n\nFamily information from Sir F. R. Chapman; Cycl. N.Z., iv (p); Scott; Chapman papers in Canadian Archives; J. A.

He was educated at St Aidan's Academy, Enniscorthy (1874-76), at St Peter's College, Wexford, and then at Maynooth Ecclesiastical College, near Dublin. From there he proceeded to the Pontifical Seminary at the Lateran, Rome, pursuing higher studies in theology and canon law at the Papal University of the Apollinaire (1880-83). His health suffered from close study in Rome and he had several times to retire for rest periods. On leaving Rome he completed his studies at the College of St Sulpice in Paris (1884).\n\nIn the following year Cleary was ordained priest in the Shannon chapel at Enniscorthy and was appointed to the house of missions there. Owing to indifferent health he did not remain in mission work but was sent as assistant to the parish priest at Monagheer. He was then appointed professor of modern languages in his old college at St Peter's, where one of his pupils was Sir James O'Connor, afterwards lord chief justice of Ireland. It seemed imperative that he should seek change of climate and in 1888 he took up duty as assistant priest in the diocese of Ballarat, in Australia. In 1890 he went to Hamilton (Victoria) and later to Ararat. While there, in addition to intense devotion to parochial duties, he undertook the task of defending the Catholic faith in the press. Working at high pressure he published a book, The Orange Society, which ran into 12 editions.\n\nThis work attracted the attention of Bishop Verdon and Cleary was in 1898 invited to assume control of the Catholic organ in New Zealand, the New Zealand Tablet. His term in charge of that paper was distinguished by brilliant journalistic success and in 1900 the paper received the apostolic blessing. While in Dunedin Cleary published An Impeached Nation, giving the Irish version of the agrarian outrages which were constantly occurring in Ireland. He also published Secular v. Religious Education and wrote a number of articles for the Catholic Encyclopaedia. In recognition of the notable work done in this sphere the Pope in 1908 conferred upon him the doctorate of divinity. He made an extensive tour abroad in 1910, including a long visit to Central and South American countries for the purpose of establishing a number of Catholic news agencies which should combat hostile propaganda at its source. He was made a life member of the International Catholic Truth Society. While Cleary was on this tour the death occurred of Dr Lenihan (q.v.), Bishop of Auckland, and the nomination of a new bishop was unanimously in favour of Dr Cleary. He was consecrated on 21 Aug 1910 at Enniscorthy and he took possession of his see on 11 Jan 1911.\n\nThe new Bishop made the Maori people his especial care, and for that purpose learned the language thoroughly. He was mainly responsible for the establishment of St Peter's rural training college at Takapuna, in which the Mill Hill Fathers co-operated and which they afterwards controlled. There selected native boys are not only trained for service as catechists, but learn technical work of various kinds which they may afterwards impart to their own people. Cleary saw the Star of the Sea home for orphans at Howick replanned on generous lines. He wrote many fairy tales for children and personally told them to the orphans. He was most zealous in the cause of Catholic education, building schools wherever he could find the means, and publishing many pamphlets in defence of the Catholic standpoint on the Bible-in-Schools question. He envisaged a Catholic school in every parish. During his episcopate of Auckland he saw the number of parishes increased from 38 to 57, of primary schools from 30 to 51, of secondary schools from 8 to 9, of children receiving Catholic education from 3,300 to 7,200, and the total Catholic population from 31,000 to 55,000. He took the interest of a scholar and a historian in the preservation of Catholic archives, which he left complete and well organised as a legacy to posterity. In 1916 he had to go abroad for medical advice and spent some months in various private hospitals in Australia, America and Great Britain. Finding in England that there was only one Catholic chaplain for the military camps of the New Zealand division in Great Britain, and that the 2nd brigade in France had none, he volunteered for service and on 31 Oct 1916 was gazetted a chaplain of the 4th class. From Dec 1916 to Feb 1917 he was with the troops in the front line. Though he received injuries in attending the wounded under fire he did not flinch; and found time also to write his observations of the effect of shell fire upon birdlife. (O.B.E. 1918) He returned to New Zealand in Oct 1917. In 1918 Cleary founded a Catholic newspaper in Auckland, The Month. His death occurred on 9 Dec 1929.\n\nThe Month, pass.

In 1831, he brought back two Maori chiefs, Taraia and Ahouiffe, to England to see the King, and also made an interesting report to Lord Goderich on conditions in New Zealand. While in command of the City of Edinburgh he had bought land in the Bay of Islands from Pomare and others in Dec 1830, and on this he settled in Sep 1832, opening a trading establishment in partnership with Samuel Stephenson at Okiato. During the official residency of Busby (q.v.), Clendon, being one of the wealthiest settlers and influential with the natives, played a prominent part. When Busby's house was attacked (May 1834), he protested against Busby's weak handling of the natives and joined his fellow settlers in petitioning for military protection. He was one of the leading agitators for the prohibition of spirits (1835), and gave a practical lead by starting all his own casks. He supported Busby, however, in his attempt to confederate the Northern chiefs, and he (not, as usually stated, James C. Clendon) was a witness to the Declaration of Independence (28 Oct 1835). In the war of 1837, he saved the lives and property of several Europeans at the Bay, and assisted the Rev Henry Williams in the peace negotiations. Buick's suggestion that Clendon acted as assistant-resident at Hokianga is mistaken. He was the first consul at Bay of Islands for the United States (1838-42). From the beginning of 1839 to Apr 1841, Clendon acted as American consul at the Bay of Islands. Though the Colonial Office had anticipated that the American government might protest against the establishment of British sovereignty, Clendon did not consider that his office obliged him to oppose Hobson's mission. On the contrary, he actively supported Busby and Williams in winning over the chiefs to the treaty of Waitangi, his influence with the natives being the greater because his office created the impression that he was disinterested. He signed the memorial witnessing Hobson's assumption of authority, and was one of the witnesses to the treaty.\n\nThe decision to fix the seat of government temporarily at Bay of Islands, and to form a government township there, gave Clendon an opportunity for profitable speculation. Felton Mathew (q.v.), acting surveyor-general, reported that Clendon's estate at Okiato (some 380 acres) was the only site in the Bay suitable for government purposes. Clendon, anticipating this, had had his land surveyed and laid out as a township, and commenced selling lots. He was willing enough to sell to the Government, and started by asking Â£23,000; he refused to suspend sale of lots till Hobson referred to Gipps for authority to buy; and eventually (22 Mar) he agreed to accept Â£15,000. The price was not unduly high compared with the speculative prices then prevailing and the very high cost of building material and labour. The buildings consisted of a comfortable dwelling house, a large store, two small cottages, and blacksmith's and carpenter's shops, valued at Â£13,000, the land being valued at Â£2,000. In the event, it proved that Clendon had not made as good a bargain as he thought. Gipps refused to sanction the purchase, the sale of lots in the government township of 'Russell' was held up sine die, and without the income from sales neither capital nor interest due to Clendon was forthcoming. He had received only the first instalment of Â£1,000. In Jun 1841 he was persuaded to accept Â£1,250 as rent plus interest on the debt to date, and 10,000 acres of government land in lieu of the capital sum still due. His selection of this land was limited, and instead of getting a block at Tamaki (near the new capital of Auckland) he had to take 10,000 acres at Papakura. The value of these lands fell sharply, to about 1/6 per acre, and in 1845 Clendon complained (in a petition to Lord Stanley), that he was the loser, in capital and accumulated interest, to the tune of nearly Â£18,000.\n\nIn Mar 1840 Clendon was appointed magistrate, and he was a member of the Legislative Council (1841-44). After the destruction of Kororareka, he was made police magistrate at Bay of Islands in place of Thomas Beckham. His confidential reports to the Governor throw much light on the conduct of the war in the north (1845-46), the condition of the Natives, and the intrigues of the few disaffected Europeans. His nominal census of the Bay of Islands and Hokianga districts in 1846 is an interesting compilation. He was superseded as magistrate (Dec 1846) by the senior military officer, but was reappointed in Jun 1850 and held other offices (sub-treasurer, 1850; registrar of births, etc., 1854; and inspector of police, 1859). About the end of 1861, he removed to Herd's Point (Rawene) on the Hokianga, resigning his Bay offices, and becoming magistrate, inspector of customs, and registrar at Hokianga. He was superannuated in 1866 with a pension. He continued trading till the end of his life, but latterly his affairs went badly, mainly through giving too much credit. He died at Rawene, 24 Oct 1872.\n\nN.Z. Archives, G. 1, B.R. 1 and 2; N.Z.

Clifford, and grandson of the Hon Thomas Clifford. Educated at Stonyhurst College, he came to New Zealand in the George Fyfe and at once set to work to clear his section near Porirua, on which he and Vavasour entertained their fellow passengers at a picnic before they went on to Nelson.\n\nHaving been gazetted a justice of the peace in 1844 and a member of the Legislative Council, Clifford went to Auckland to attend the sittings of that body. In 1845 he, in view of the unrest amongst the native tribes, took his part in the mobilisation of the militia and volunteers for the defence of the Port Nicholson settlement. With Vavasour and Weld he took up land in the lower valley of the Wairarapa and their sheep, driven round the rocks from Wellington, were actually the first to reach their station in the valley, though C. R. Bidwill reached the valley first and cut the track by which the others overtook him. Meanwhile Clifford was conducting a land agency in Wellington. His attention was attracted to pastoral land in the northern part of the South Island, and he made some explorations there which resulted in the partnership in 1846 taking up a large area of open country on lease. They at once brought a flock of merino sheep across and occupied what was afterwards known as Flaxbourne and Stonyhurst stations, on the borders of Canterbury and Marlborough. In 1850 they had 10,000 merino sheep thriving on the native grass and were so well satisfied with the outlook that they parted with their interests in the North Island and concentrated on their new station.\n\nIn 1847 Clifford married Mary Anne (who died in 1899), daughter of John Hercy, deputy lieutenant of Berkshire. He was now actively engaged in the agitation for self-government, and took part in the work in England, where he spent most of the years 1848-50. On his return the partners decided to dispose of their property at Wharekaka, in south Wairarapa. They were soon realising the highest prices in New Zealand for their rams bred in the South Island.\n\nAt the inauguration of the new constitution Clifford, although a Catholic, was returned at the head of the poll as representative for Wellington City in the Provincial Council. He was at once elected speaker of the Council, a position which he filled with credit until his voluntary retirement in 1857. He took a great interest in the development of provincial institutions and was a member of the education commission in 1854. In 1853 also he was elected to Parliament for the City of Wellington. When he took his seat at Auckland on the opening of Parliament he already had a reputation as a speaker. Edward Gibbon Wakefield, and others who desired him to be Speaker of the House feared that he might use his position to favour his own faith. Clifford, on the other hand, with his co-religionist Weld, was actuated by one thought only as regards religion. He wished to ensure, as Bishop Pompallier had done at Waitangi in 1840, merely that all religions should have equal freedom in the new colony; that there should be no suggestion of a state religion. He declined to give Wakefield any assurances and was eventually elected Speaker without opposition. Though he had refused to give any undertaking to get a Church of England clergyman to open with prayer, he had arranged that one of that denomination (the Rev J. F. Lloyd) should be in the vicinity at the moment when Parliament commenced its deliberations. Having been elected Speaker, he stated that he believed it would be the wish of members that they should open their meeting with some sort of prayer and he requested the sergeant-at-arms to go outside and bring in the first clergyman he could find. Lloyd soon made his appearance, and said a prayer. The House afterwards debated at length the manner of saying prayers and eventually referred it to a committee of two to recommend a procedure (Clifford and Weld being the committee). They recommended that the Speaker should read prayers at the opening of each sitting of Parliament, a course that has been followed to the present day.\n\nIn 1858 Clifford was knighted. He paid a visit to England in 1860 and, having decided to remain there, resigned his seat in Parliament and the Speakership. In England he was a director of several financial companies. On 16 Jul 1887 Clifford was created a baronet (of Flaxbourne). His death occurred on 27 Feb 1893.\n\nWellington P.C. Proc. and Gaz.; N.Z.

Educated privately in Penzance, he was apprenticed to printing and bookbinding there and afterwards worked as a compositor in London.\n\nIn 1833 the C.M.S. appealed for a mission press to be established in New Zealand. The S.P.C.K. responded, and Colenso was engaged as a catechist and printer. He landed at Paihia on 30 Dec 1834. Though lacking much of the requisite equipment, he produced on 17 Feb 1835 the first proofs of the first book printed in New Zealand, the epistles to the Ephesians and the Philippians (in Maori). In Dec 1837 he completed his new testament, an octavo volume in small pica type, of which 6,000 copies were printed. In Jan 1838 he accompanied W. Williams on a visit to the East Coast. When Captain Hobson arrived Colenso carried out most of the printing in connection with the treaty of Waitangi (of which he published in 1890 an authentic narrative based on his diary). From this time Colenso devoted himself to missionary work. He travelled a great deal in the north, the East Coast and Waikato in 1841-42, and in Oct 1843 sailed with Henry Williams for Port Nicholson. Landing at Castle Point, they walked overland to Hawke's Bay, where a site was chosen at Ngaruroro for a station to be opened by him.\n\nHaving completed two years at St John's College, Colenso was ordained deacon (Sep 1844) and four months later he took up his station. For some years he had charge of a very wide district, involving a great deal of travelling and affording opportunities of study in Maori language and lore and the natural sciences. He devoted much study to Maori arts, antiquities, myths and legends, and had a high reputation among scientists. In 1842 he published in the Tasmanian Journal of Science papers on New Zealand ferns and in 1843 a paper on fossil remains of the moa (discovered by W. Williams in 1838). In 1845 he traversed the Ruataniwha plains and travelled by inland Patea to Rangitikei. In 1844 he published in Tasmania an account of his explorations in 1841-42 and in 1845 a classification and description of some of the ferns he discovered. In 1847 he made a journey across the Ruahine range and thence by Onetapu and Roto-aira to the headwaters of the Moawhango. His authority on Maori subjects and the natural history of New Zealand was unquestioned. In 1851 (with Sir G. Grey) he founded the New Zealand Society for the Furtherance of Scientific Research, and in 1868 he was one of the most active members of the New Zealand Institute. He was a founder of the Hawke's Bay Philosophical Society (of which he was president) and a constant contributor to the transactions of the Institute. Abroad he was a fellow of the Linnaean Society and the Royal Society. In 1865 he wrote for the Dunedin Exhibition papers on the botany of New Zealand and the Maori race, and in 1871 a plea for Kereopa (Fiat Justitia); in 1888 Fifty Years Ago in New Zealand; in 1889 Ancient Tide-lore and Tales of the Sea; and in 1898 the first section of his Maori-English Lexicon, the dimensions of which have prohibited its continuation.\n\nOn the separation of Hawke's Bay from Wellington Colenso was elected to the Provincial Council for Napier Town (1859-67, 1871-75). He was acting-speaker for a while in 1871. In the Parliament of 1861 he represented Napier, but lost his seat to D. McLean (146 votes to 32). He was for many years inspector of schools for Hawke's Bay. He died on 10 Feb 1899. Colenso married Elizabeth (1821-1904), daughter of W. T. Fairburn.\n\nHawkes Bay P.C.

Mrs Mary Walker, the wife of a respectable yeoman, taught him a little reading and writing while he worked on their farm, watering stock and doing other tasks. When he was eight years old his father removed to Ayton as bailiff of Skottowe, and James continued his schooling at High Green, where he showed considerable aptitude at arithmetic and writing.\n\nAt 13 he was apprenticed to a grocer and haberdasher at Staithes, 10 miles from Whitby, and after 18 months there he was bound to John Walker, a coal and shipping owner of Whitby. He made several voyages in the Freelove and the Three Brothers, carrying coal in the North Sea and to Liverpool and Dublin. In 1749 Cook went to sea before the mast for three years, and in 1752 became mate of one of Walker's ships, the Friendship. On the outbreak of war with France in 1755 he entered as a volunteer seaman in H.M.S. Eagle, 60 guns, in which he was rated as master's mate a month later. In her he saw his first naval engagement (with the French Indiaman Duc d'Aquitaine, 50 guns, which was captured). In 1757 he was master of the Solebay, and a few months later of the Pembroke, in which he saw service again at the reduction of Louisburg in Canada by naval and military forces under Admiral Boscawen and Major-general Amherst. After that the fleet moved to the St Lawrence to harry the French forces in Canada. Cook wintered at the Ile aux Coudres, where he was engaged for many weeks in the boats of the fleet sounding and charting the waterway for the forthcoming operations. The excellence of his charts attracted the attention of his commander, and subsequently the senior officer, Lord Colville, appointed him master of the flagship Northumberland. Wintering in Halifax the following year, Cook spent some time studying mathematics and obtaining a sound knowledge of astronomical navigation. After carrying out a survey of Placentia harbour he was in 1763 appointed marine surveyor of the coast of Newfoundland and Labrador, with command of the Grenville schooner. He held this position until 1767, and published his results as volumes of sailing directions which still retain a reputation for accuracy.\n\nWhen in the following year the Admiralty prepared an expedition to observe the transit of Venus in the Pacific, Cook was given command, and raised to the rank of lieutenant. He sailed in the Endeavour (370 tons) on 26 Aug 1768, and arrived at Tahiti in Apr 1769 by way of Cape Horn. The transit was successfully observed in Jun. On the way home (on 7 Oct) New Zealand, which was believed to be part of the southern continent, was sighted. On 9 Oct Cook anchored at Turanganui. Six months were spent on the coasts of this country, which was for the first time circumnavigated, examined and charted with some approach to accuracy. Cook had several encounters with the Maori, whom he considered intelligent and comparatively civilized. Though he desired to make friends they were often hostile, and firearms had at times to be used to compel them to observe fairness in trading or to desist from aggression. Many points on the coast were named during this voyage (including Poverty Bay, Cape Kidnappers, and Cape Palliser) and the scientists, Joseph Banks and Dr Solander made valuable collections of new plants. On 15 Nov he took possession of Mercury Bay, and on 31 Jan 1770 of Queen Charlotte Sound, where he had careened his ship for cleaning. After circumnavigating the South Island, Cook made his departure from Cape Farewell on 31 Mar and proceeded to examine the north-east coast of Australia. After two months at Batavia, the Endeavour reached England by way of South Africa on 12 Jun 1771.\n\nThe success of the voyage and the importance of the discoveries being recognised, Cook was promoted to the rank of commander and given command of a new expedition for the exploration of the Pacific. This expedition, which sailed from Plymouth on 13 Apr 1772, consisted of two ships, the Resolution (460 tons) commanded by Cook, and the Adventure (330 tons) commanded by Tobias Furneaux, with a staff of competent astronomers, naturalists and artists. Proceeding by way of the Cape of Good Hope, and following a southerly route in the hope of sighting the southern continent, the Resolution arrived at New Zealand alone and anchored at Dusky Bay on 26 Mar 1773. On 18 May the two ships met in Queen Charlotte sound, where friendly relations with the Maori were established, provisions taken on board, and pigs and goats liberated. On 7 Jun the ships left. After a visit to Tahiti and the Friendly Islands, on which the position of numerous islands was noted or rectified, the two ships returned to New Zealand on 21 Oct. On 2 Nov Cook discovered the entrance of Port Nicholson and anchored off it, but did not enter. He spent some time in Ship Cove refitting and sailed on 25 Nov for the far south. He reached the latitude of 62Â° 10\" south and explored many leagues of the Antarctic, afterwards sailing north to the New Hebrides and discovering New Caledonia. On 17 Oct 1774 he again saw mount Egmont. He overhauled his vessel in Ship Cove and, having waited in vain for the Adventure, he sailed on 10 Nov for England. Proceeding by way of Cape Horn, he discovered South Georgia and reached England on 29 Jul 1775, the Adventure having arrived more than a year earlier. She had had a fatal experience in Grass Cove (Wharehunga Bay), Queen Charlotte Sound, where a boat's crew was massacred and eaten.\n\nCook was promoted to captain and appointed to the Greenwich Hospital. He was given permission to publish his account of the voyage, which besides being important from the point of view of discoveries was remarkable for the high standard of health of the crew and the absence of scurvy. In the following year Cook was given command of a third expedition which was sent out to investigate the North West Passage. It consisted of the Resolution and the Discovery (commanded by Captain Charles Clerke). The expedition, with a large supply of livestock, sailed on 12 Jul 1776 and reached New Zealand by way of South Africa on 10 Feb 1777. Some of the animals were landed at Queen Charlotte Sound, and on 23 Feb Cook sailed for Tahiti (where the rest of the stock was landed). After visiting other Pacific islands they sailed to the west coast of North America, which was followed northward as far as Icy Cape, in Behring Strait. In Jan 1779 Cook anchored at Karakakoa Bay, Hawaii. There the natives, with whom he always tried to deal fairly, were friendly but dishonest, and in a scuffle which occurred as a result of thieving Cook was killed (on 14 Feb 1779). Portions of his body were given up by the natives and buried at sea. In Dec 1762 Cook married Miss Batts, of Barking, by whom he had six children, all of whom died fairly young.\n\nCook's life was written by Arthur Kitson (1907) and good articles appear in the Dictionary of National Biography and the Encyclopedia Britannica. The earliest Life, by Andrew Kippis (1778) is of little biographical value. Many editions of his voyages have been published, notably the narrative of the first voyage (edited by Hawkesworth, 1773); of the second voyage (1777); and the third voyage (1784). Cook's own journal of his first voyage, much garbled by Hawkesworth, was published by Wharton in 1893. The fullest bibliography, based on material in Australian libraries, was published by the Public Library of New South Wales in 1928. There is also a short critical bibliography by Maurice Holmes (1936). The most important portraits are by Nathaniel Dance (1776) now in Greenwich Hospital, and frequently reproduced, and by William Hodges.\n\nD.N.B.; Encycl. Brit.; Kitson (op. cit.); Cycl. NZ, i; Hocken, Bibliog.\n\nReference: Volume 1, page 104\n\nðŸŒ³ Further sources\n\nAlfred Cox\n\nCOX, ALFRED (1825-1911), was born at Clarendon, New South Wales, the son of William Cox, who came to the Mother Colony in 1788 as a captain in the 102nd Regiment, retired from the army and became a prosperous settler. Alfred received his education at the King's School at Parramatta. As a pupil he was present at the funeral of Samuel Marsden (1837). Cox records that he was taught music by Samuel Wallace, bandmaster of the 17th Regiment, and father of William Vincent Wallace (q.v.). At the first concert that he attended young Wallace played on both piano and violin. Cox became an accomplished musician. In 1844, with the consent of his guardians, he paid a visit to England and to improve his knowledge of farming he stayed on a farm in Northamptonshire. In Ireland he saw the intense distress of the peasantry during the potato famine (1846).\n\nReturning to Melbourne (1847) Cox found many Tasmanians taking up the cheap runs offering in the Western District. On 26 Nov he married a daughter of Lieutenant-colonel Macpherson, of the 99th Regiment. Being now settled on the property in New South Wales, he made many trips out west. In 1854, at Newcastle, he met John Sidey, who was making large profits by shipping stock from Australia to New Zealand and selling to the owners of the new stations in Canterbury. Cox later met in Sydney one of the firm of Francis and Muter, from whom he purchased licenses to occupy two grazing runs, then unstocked. Getting together a quantity of stock, he took his passage in the Admiral Grenfell (1854), arranged temporary grazing near Christchurch and made another trip. He now had 3,000 sheep, 350 cattle and 40 or 50 horses. In company with Healey and W. Du Moulin he drove to the run, which he named Raukapuka, left Du Moulin in charge and returned to Australia, where he witnessed the first session of the General Assembly. It was three years before Cox saw his property again. In 1854 he was returned as having 826 sheep on 20,000 acres; three years later he had 2,600 on 60,000 acres.\n\nIn 1855 Cox and his family paid a visit to England and on returning to New Zealand he decided to stay in the colony. The homestead was built in 1860 at the foot of the Raukapuka bush. At the first stock show (1859) Cox won commendation for his fine-woolled sheep. Eventually he freeholded 1,500 acres at 10s an acre and, having made an excellent profit by fattening 2,000 merinos in time for the Otago diggings, he purchased another 2,000 acres at 42s 6d an acre.\n\nAs a public man the treatment meted out to the settlers of south Canterbury brought him into prominence. In 1862 he was elected for the Geraldine seat in the Provincial Council. Though he hated the idea of separation, it seemed to him the only way open to the Timaru settlers to get control of their own money. In 1863 he was elected to the General Assembly for Heathcote. In Feb 1864 he was elected a member and chairman of the first Geraldine road board. His parliamentary duties increasing, he resigned in 1865 from the Provincial Council and in 1866 was elected to the General Assembly for Timaru. In 1866 and 1867 he presented three petitions asking for self-government, and at length got a favourable recommendation from the House. In Sep 1867 he obtained the passage of a bill for the establishment of the Timaru and Gladstone board of works, and a month later he was elected a member of the first board.\n\nMeanwhile Cox had become interested in the prospects of settlement in the North Island. During 1867 he paid a visit by way of Hawkes Bay to the native land in the interior. In 1869, having accomplished his main task in Parliament, he resigned the Timaru seat, and next year he sold a large portion of his property. During 1870-71 he was again in the Provincial Council as member for Papanui. In 1873, in company with James Williamson (Auckland), he visited Waikato to inspect a property which Williamson had purchased through the government. He invested a large amount in land in the Thames district which called for much outlay on draining, and he resided in the Waikato for the next seven years. In 1876-78 he was again in Parliament as member for Waipa. His land venture turned out a costly failure and in 1882 he sold out and returned to Christchurch, where he passed his remaining years. He contested the Geraldine seat in 1884.\n\nIn 1884 Cox published an interesting volume of Recollections and two years later a biographical dictionary entitled Men of Mark in New Zealand. Cox died in St Albans on 23 May 1911.\n\nCanterbury P.C. Proc.; Hansard, pass.; Cox, op. cit.; Godley, Letters; Acland; Lyttelton Times, 24 May 1911; The Press, 11 Oct 1930 (P).

He was sent to the Royal Naval College at Portsmouth (where he won the gold medal), and was posted to the Prince Regent, 120 guns (Rear-Admiral Sir William Parker). He saw service on both coasts of South America; in Spanish waters during the Carlist war, and in the Sapphire at Corfu (1836). Here he received the Royal Humane Society's medal for life saving. In 1837 he was promoted sub-lieutenant, but seeing no likelihood of further promotion resigned and came to Sydney in the Commandel (1838).\n\nCrawford bought a herd of cattle and drove them overland from Braidwood to Adelaide. Late in 1839 he came to New Zealand in the schooner Success, landing at Titahi Bay and walking across to Port Nicholson. Chartering the cutter Harriett from the whaler Toms, he did some exploring in the northern bays of the South Island. While camped on the beach at Pito-one he bought from Henry Moreing five of the New Zealand Company's land orders, entitling him to five town acres and 500 country. He acquired a tract of land on Watts Peninsula, where he established the Glendavar cattle farm (north of Burnham lake). Some years later, in order to drain the lake, he had a tunnel 100 yards long cut through the hill to Evans Bay. This is said to have been the first tunnel made in New Zealand, and is still being used for sewerage and for oil pipelines. The name Miramar was given to the estate by Crawford's brother-in-law, Major McBarnett. After acquiring his land Crawford returned to Sydney by way of Bay of Islands, and brought back cattle. In that year (1840) he made an overland journey to Auckland, and then left for England by way of the Philippines and India.\n\nIn 1846 he returned to New Zealand and was present in H.M.S. Driver with Sir George Grey at the apprehension of Te Rauparaha. Next year he made a journey on foot with Clifford and Stafford to reconnoitre the Wairarapa, and was much struck by the remarkable sense of locality that Stafford possessed; the future premier readily recognised from the reverse side trees and natural features that they had passed on their outward journey. Later Crawford visited in H.M.S. Inflexible the settlements at Nelson and Taranaki. As a geologist he rendered great service both to the General Government and the province of Wellington. In 1861 he rode overland to the upper Wanganui to inspect the coal measures of the Tangarakau river. Next year he accompanied the Superintendent (Featherston) to Waitotara. He explored the Tararua range, portion of north Auckland, and finally (1864) the Waikato basin. In 1841 he started a flax dressing company in Wellington. He was a member of the Geological Society of Edinburgh and of the Imperial and Royal Geographical Society of Austria. He was president of the Wellington Philosophical Society and a governor of the New Zealand Institute, in whose transactions appear many papers recording his observations. In 1880 he published in London Recollections of Travel in New Zealand and Australia, and in 1883 The Reform of English Spelling.\n\nCrawford was a member of the Legislative Council (1859-67), resigning on accepting the post of resident magistrate and sheriff at Wellington, which he held until 1882. He was a captain in the New Zealand militia and also in the Lanarkshire militia in Scotland. He married (1843) Sophia (d. 1852), daughter of Sir James W. D. Dundas, G.C.B. In 1857 he married Jessie (d. 1880), daughter of Alexander McBarnett, of Torridon and Attadale, Ross-shire, Scotland. Crawford died in England on 8 Apr 1889.\n\nG.B.C., 1844/556; Col.

After receiving a good education he studied law, and in a few years received a post in the department of the commissioner of bankruptcy.\n\nAt the age of 26 Cutten emigrated to New Zealand in the John Wickliffe, and established himself as a merchant and auctioneer in Dunedin. In 1849 he was appointed emigration agent, and he was also a land claims commissioner. He took a prominent part in the Otago Settlers' Association, which worked for full self-government, and was one of the founders of the Mechanics' Institute in Dunedin. The first newspaper in the settlement, the Otago News, came to an end in Dec 1850. A group of business men financed the Otago Witness, which made its first appearance in Feb 1851. It was intended that they should take week about editing the journal, but before long Cutten was appointed editor at Â£1 a week. In Oct 1851 the proprietors presented the property to him. Soon afterwards the plant was transferred to Cutten's auction rooms, whence the paper issued for some years. On the outbreak of the diggings (1861) Cutten and his associates established the Otago Daily Times, and engaged Vogel as editor of both papers. B. L. Farjeon took charge of the mechanical side. Cutten found his temperament unsuited to the hurly-burly of journalism, and before long he parted with his interest in the company.\n\nIn the first Provincial Council he was one of the members for the City of Dunedin (1853-63). During most of that time he was a member of the executive, often as provincial treasurer, and he held from the General Government the post of commissioner of crown lands for the province. These combined offices caused embarrassment, and he had to choose between the service of the province and that of the Colony. A rule had been passed by the Provincial Council forbidding its members holding office under the General Government. Cutten retired from the Council and continued in the office of commissioner of crown lands until 1867, when it was combined with that of chief surveyor, and J. T. Thomson assumed the post.\n\nCutten was elected in 1853 as member for Dunedin Country district in Parliament. The long journeys to Auckland made it impossible for him to leave his business for so long, and he resigned in 1855. In that year he was elected a member of the Dunedin town board (which preceded the City Council). In 1863 Cutten tried again to enter Parliament, but was defeated for Dunedin and Suburbs by Reynolds and Vogel. Having resigned his General Government appointments, he was free in the early seventies to take public office, and he returned to the Provincial Council as member for Dunedin. He was for 18 months a member of Donald Reid's executive, and he foreshadowed the Liberal land measures of Rolleston by introducing resolutions in the Council providing for the system of land purchase by deferred payment. Having retired from the Council, Cutten in 1873 paid a visit of two years to the Old Country.\n\nOn returning he was again elected M.H.R. (for Taieri, which he represented from 1878-79). In 1881 he tried to get himself elected for Peninsula, but without success. He was a member of the Otago University council 1871-83.\n\nCutten married (1850) a daughter of Cargill. He died on 30 Jun 1883.\n\nOtago P.C. Proc.; Hocken; Arnold; Otago News, pass; Otago Daily Times, 1 Jul 1883, 4 Jul 1930 (p).\n\nReference: Volume 1, page 111\n\nðŸŒ³ Further sources"
