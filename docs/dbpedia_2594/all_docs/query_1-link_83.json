        "text": "Category Archives: Peerage and Nobility\n\nCharles Beauclerk, 1st Duke of St. Albans, Illegitimate Son of King Charles II of England\n\nby Susan Flantzer\n\n© Unofficial Royalty 2024\n\nDespite fathering many illegitimate children with his mistresses, King Charles II of England had no children with his wife Catherine of Braganza. Charles II is an ancestor through his mistresses of many British aristocrats and of several women who married into the British Royal Family. Lucy Walter and Charles II are ancestors of Sarah, Duchess of York and Princess Alice, Duchess of Gloucester. Barbara Palmer, 1st Duchess of Cleveland and Charles II are ancestors of Diana, Princess of Wales and Sarah, Duchess of York. Louise Renée de Penancoet de Kérouaille, Duchess of Portsmouth and Charles II are ancestors of Diana, Princess of Wales, Queen Camilla, and Sarah, Duchess of York.\n\nCharles Beauclerk, 1st Duke of St. Albans was born on May 8, 1670, at his mother’s house in Lincoln’s Inn Fields in London, England, the illegitimate son of King Charles II of England and his mistress Nell Gwyn. Charles II acknowledged Nell’s son right away.\n\nThe surname Beauclerk derives from King Henry I of England, who reigned 1100 – 1135. King Henry I received a good education, learning to read and write in Latin and studying English law. He also studied English, which was unusual for the time. As a younger son, his destiny probably was to enter the Church. He earned the nickname Beauclerc, Anglo-Norman for fine scholar.\n\nCharles’ mother Nell Gwyn has uncertain beginnings. Generally, her birth is given as February 2, 1650. Nell’s father was thought to be Thomas Gwyn, an army captain who died or disappeared. Nell’s mother was born Helena Smith, known as Madam Gwyn, in the civil parish of St Martin-in-the-Fields in London, England, and lived there all her life. Nell’s mother worked as a tapwoman at the Rose Tavern on Russell Street and it can be assumed that she also worked as a prostitute and that Nell probably worked as a child prostitute. Nell and her older sister Rose worked as orange girls selling fruit and sweetmeats to the patrons of a new playhouse, the Theatre in Bridges Street, which was later rebuilt and renamed the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane. The orange-girls were exposed to aspects of theater life and London’s higher society. The actors at the theater were the King’s Company and King Charles II frequently attended performances.\n\nLess than a year after becoming an orange girl, fourteen-year-old Nell became an actress with the King’s Company. Nell could not read or write and had to learn her lines by having them read to her. The affair between Nell and King Charles II began in April 1668 when Nell was attending a performance at Lincoln’s Inn Fields Theater. Charles II was in the next box and was more interested in flirting with Nell than watching the play. Charles II invited Nell and her escort to supper, along with his brother the Duke of York (the future King James II). After supper, so the story goes, Charles II discovered that he had no money on him and neither did his brother, resulting in Nell having to cover the cost of the supper. “Od’s fish!” she exclaimed, in imitation of Charles II’s manner of speaking, “but this is the poorest company I ever was in!”\n\nBesides Charles Beauclerk, 1st Duke of St. Albans, Nell had one other son with King Charles II:\n\nLord James Beauclerk (1671 – 1680), died in childhood\n\nIn 1676, King Charles II created six-year-old Charles Earl of Burford and Baron Heddington. In 1684, Charles was created 1st Duke of St. Albans. Since then, all the Dukes of St. Albans have been his descendants. King Charles II also granted his son an allowance of £1,000 a year and the offices of Chief Ranger of Enfield Chace and Master of the Hawks. Charles served as Colonel in the Regiment of Horse and fought with Leopold I, Holy Roman Emperor at the Siege of Belgrade in 1688. When Charles’ 36-year-old mother Nell Gwyn died in 1687, she left her estate including Burford House, near Windsor Castle to her son Charles.\n\nIn 1688, Charles supported his first cousin William III, Prince of Orange (also William III, Prince of Orange) in overthrowing their uncle King James II in the Glorious Revolution of 1688, resulting in his first cousins, husband and wife William III, Prince of Orange and Princess Mary of England, the elder of the two daughters of King James II, reigning England jointly as King William III and Queen Mary II. Charles held several important appointments under King William III and Queen Mary II and under King George I including Captain of the Band of Gentlemen Pensioners, Lord of the Bedchamber, and Lord Lieutenant of Berkshire.\n\nOn April 17, 1694, Charles married Lady Diana de Vere, daughter of Aubrey de Vere, 20th Earl of Oxford and one of the Hampton Court Beauties, a series of eight portraits by Sir Godfrey Kneller (one of the portraits is above), commissioned by Queen Mary II of England, depicting the most glamorous ladies from the court of William III and Mary III. From 1714 to 1717, Diana was Mistress of the Robes to Caroline of Ansbach, Princess of Wales, the wife of the future King George II of Great Britain.\n\nCharles and Diana had twelve children:\n\nCharles Beauclerk, 2nd Duke of St Albans (1696 – 1751), married Lucy Werden, had one son and one daughter\n\nLady Diana Beauclerk (born c. 1697)\n\nLord William Beauclerk (1698 – 1732), married Charlotte Werden, had two sons and two daughters\n\nAdmiral Vere Beauclerk, 1st Baron Vere of Hanworth (1699 – 1781), married Mary Chambers, had four sons and two daughters\n\nColonel Lord Henry Beauclerk (1701 – 1761), unmarried\n\nLord Sidney Beauclerk (1703 – 1744), married Mary Norris, had one son\n\nLieutenant-General Lord George Beauclerk (1704 – 1768), married Margaret Bainbridge, no children\n\nLord Seymour Beauclerk (1708 – 1709), died in infancy\n\nLord James Beauclerk, Bishop of Hereford (circa 1709 – 1787), unmarried\n\nLord Aubrey Beauclerk (1711 – 1740), Captain in the Royal Navy, and died at the Battle of Cartagena de Indias, unmarried\n\nLady Mary Beauclerk (1710 – 1795), married Michael Archibald McDonald, had one son\n\nLady Anne Beauclerk (1716 – ?)\n\nCharles Beauclerk, 1st Duke of St. Albans died on May 10, 1726, aged 56, in Bath, England. He was buried at Westminster Abbey in the Chapel of St. John the Evangelist but he has no monument or marker. His wife Diana survived him by sixteen years, dying, aged 63, on January 15, 1742, at Windsor Castle in Windsor, England, and was buried in St. George’s Chapel, Windsor Castle in Windsor, England.\n\nThis article is the intellectual property of Unofficial Royalty and is NOT TO BE COPIED, EDITED, OR POSTED IN ANY FORM ON ANOTHER WEBSITE under any circumstances.

Charles II is an ancestor through his mistresses of many British aristocrats and of several women who married into the British Royal Family. Lucy Walter and Charles II are ancestors of Sarah, Duchess of York and Princess Alice, Duchess of Gloucester. Barbara Palmer, 1st Duchess of Cleveland and Charles II are ancestors of Diana, Princess of Wales and Sarah, Duchess of York. Louise Renée de Penancoet de Kérouaille, Duchess of Portsmouth and Charles II are ancestors of Diana, Princess of Wales, Queen Camilla, and Sarah, Duchess of York.\n\nBorn on September 28, 1663, at the Palace of Whitehall in London, England, Henry Fitzroy, 1st Duke of Grafton was an illegitimate son of King Charles II of England and one of his mistresses, Barbara Palmer, 1st Duchess of Cleveland in her own right. The surname FitzRoy comes from the Anglo-Norman Fitz, meaning “son of” and Roy, meaning “king”, implying the original bearer of the surname was a child of a king. Charles’s paternal grandparents were King Charles I of England and Henrietta Maria of France (the daughter of King Henri IV of France and his second wife Marie de’ Medici). His maternal grandparents were William Villiers, 2nd Viscount Grandison and Mary Bayning.\n\nHenry’s mother was born in 1640 as Barbara Villiers, the only child of William Villiers, 2nd Viscount Grandison and Mary Bayning. In 1643, Barbara’s father died in the First English Civil War, leaving his 18-year-old widow and his three-year-old daughter in financial difficulty. Barbara’s mother soon married Charles Villiers, 2nd Earl of Anglesey, her late husband’s cousin. The marriage was childless and Barbara’s stepfather died from smallpox in 1661. Barbara was considered one of the most beautiful of the young Royalist women but her lack of a dowry did not help her marriage prospects. In 1659, Barbara married the Roman Catholic Roger Palmer, later 1st Earl of Castlemaine, against his family’s wishes. In 1660, Barbara became King Charles II’s mistress.\n\nBesides Henry, Barbara gave birth to five other children and it is surmised that they were all the children of King Charles II. Through their children, Barbara Palmer and King Charles II are the ancestors of Diana, Princess of Wales and Sarah, Duchess of York, and their children Prince William, Prince Harry, Princess Beatrice, and Princess Eugenie. As a reward for Barbara’s services, Charles II created Roger Palmer Earl of Castlemaine in 1661.\n\nThe children of Barbara Palmer, probably the children of King Charles II, and therefore, probably the full siblings of Henry Fitzroy, 1st Duke of Grafton:\n\nLady Anne FitzRoy (1661 – 1721), married Thomas Lennard, 15th Baron Dacre, 1st Earl of Sussex, had four children\n\nCharles Fitzroy, 2nd Duke of Cleveland, 1st Duke of Southampton (1662 – 1730), married (1) Mary Wood, no children (2) Anne Pulteney, had six children\n\nLady Charlotte FitzRoy (1664–1717), married Edward Lee, 1st Earl of Lichfield, had eighteen children\n\nGeorge FitzRoy, 1st Duke of Northumberland (1665–1716), married (1) Catherine Wheatley, no children (2) Mary Dutton, no children\n\nBarbara FitzRoy (1672–1737), became a nun taking the name Sister Benedicta; her mother claimed that she was Charles II’s daughter but she was may have been the child of her mother’s second cousin and lover John Churchill, later 1st Duke of Marlborough\n\nOn August 1, 1672, nearly nine-year-old Henry, the newly created Earl of Euston, was betrothed to four-year-old Isabella Bennet, daughter and heiress of Henry Bennet, 1st Earl of Arlington and Elisabeth of Nassau, a granddaughter of Maurits of Nassau, Prince of Orange, and a great-granddaughter of Willem I (the Silent), Prince of Orange. On November 4, 1679, Henry, now the newly created Duke of Grafton, and Isabella were married. In 1685, when her father died, Isabella became the 2nd Countess of Arlington in her own right.\n\nHenry and Isabella had one son who succeeded his parents as 2nd Duke of Grafton and 3rd Earl of Arlington:\n\nCharles FitzRoy, 2nd Duke of Grafton (1683 – 1757), married Lady Henrietta Somerset, had seven children\n\nHenry was raised as a sailor and was well-suited to military life. He was appointed Colonel of the Grenadier Guards in 1681 and served as Vice-Admiral of England from 1682 to 1689. Henry participated in several military expeditions, both at sea and on land. In 1684, Henry fought on the side of the French in the Siege of Luxembourg, when King Louis XIV of France successfully laid siege to the Spanish-controlled Fortress of Luxembourg. In 1685, when his half-brother James Scott, 1st Duke of Monmouth, an illegitimate son of King Charles II of England and his mistress Lucy Walter, attempted to claim the throne by overthrowing their uncle King James II, Henry fought against his half-brother and commanded the royal troops in Somerset. However, Henry later acted with John Churchill, 1st Duke of Marlborough, and joined his first cousin William III, Prince of Orange to overthrow their uncle King James II in the Glorious Revolution of 1688, resulting in his first cousins and husband and wife William III, Prince of Orange and Princess Mary of England, the elder of the two daughters of King James II, reigning England jointly as King William III and Queen Mary II.\n\nIn 1683, Henry became captain of the HMS Grafton, a British naval ship named after him. On July 10, 1690, at the Battle of Beachy Head during the Nine Years’ War, pitting the French and the Dutch against each other, Henry’s brilliant action aboard the HMS Grafton gave the Dutch the victory. However, just three months later, on October 9, 1690, in Cork, Ireland, 27-year-old Henry FitzRoy, 1st Duke of Grafton died from wounds received two weeks earlier at the Siege of Cork, during the Williamite War in Ireland when supporters of the former King James II attempted to retake the English throne from King William III and Queen Mary II.\n\nThe remains of Henry FitzRoy, 1st Duke of Grafton were returned to England where he was buried in the churchyard at St. Genevieve Church in Euston, Suffolk, England. His descendants still hold the peerage Duke of Grafton. The current holder of the peerage is Henry Oliver Charles FitzRoy, 12th Duke of Grafton, born in 1978.\n\nThis article is the intellectual property of Unofficial Royalty and is NOT TO BE COPIED, EDITED, OR POSTED IN ANY FORM ON ANOTHER WEBSITE under any circumstances.

The title first appeared in the 1300s, but it was not until 1611 that the title became commonly used. In 1611, King James I issued Letters Patent granting Baronetcies to 200 men. In return, they were required to pay for the upkeep of 30 soldiers for three years. Eight years later, he created the Baronetage of Ireland. In 1625, King Charles I created the Baronetage of Nova Scotia, to raise funds and support for the colonization of the now Canadian province. After failing to reach his desired 150 Scottish grantees, he allowed English and Irish men to be created Baronets in Nova Scotia as well. Upon the Act of Union 1707, new baronets were created in the Baronetage of Great Britain (and since 1801, the Baronetage of the United Kingdom).\n\nBaronets (and Baronetesses in their own right) hold precedence following all members of the peerage, but above all knighthoods other than the Order of the Garter and the Order of the Thistle. The title traditionally descends to male heirs, but sometimes special remainder allows them to pass to daughters and their male heirs; sons-in-law; and sometimes to whoever holds ownership of the property or estate.\n\nBaronetesses in their own right\n\nThere have been only four women who were Baronetesses in their own right. Of them, three were inherited titles, while only one was created a Baronetess in her own right.\n\nDame Maureen “Daisy” Moore Dunbar, 8th Baronetess (of Hempriggs) – 1906-1997 – Daisy inherited the Baronetcy in 1963, following the death of a second cousin.\n\nDame Mary Witham Bolles, 1st Baronetess (of Osberton) – 1579-1662 – Mary is the only woman created a Baronetess in her own right. The baronetcy was inherited by her grandson, Sir William Jopson, 2nd Baronet.\n\nDame Eleanor “Nora” Dalyell, 10th Baronetess (of the Binns) – 1895-1972 – Nora inherited the baronetcy which was created with special remainder to “tailzie succeeding the grantee in the estate” – the technical owner of the property and estate.\n\nDame Anne Maxwell Macdonald, 11th Baronetess (of Pollack in the County of Renfrew) – 1906-2011 – Anne was recognized as heir to her father’s baronetcy in 2005, 49 years after his death.\n\nKamagra Oral Jelly, in the same way as all are discount viagra cialis made with the same thing.

Approximately 242 of these baronetcies are held by members of the Peerage.\n\nThe creation of Baronetcies basically ended on December 31, 1964. Since then, only one Baronetcy has been created. In February 1991, Denis Thatcher, husband of former Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, was granted a hereditary Baronetage. (This is also the last hereditary peerage granted to anyone other than members of the British Royal Family.)\n\nTitles and Styles\n\nBaronetcies are created with a territorial designation (ex. John Smith, Baronet Smith of London), and usually include the surname. These territorial designations are not usually used in casual reference, unless to differentiate several baronets with the same surname (example: Baronet Smith of London, Baronet Smith of Manchester, etc). Holders are entitled to Sir or Dame before their name, and the post-honorific of ‘Bt’ or ‘Btss’ following their name.\n\nA Baronet is styled Sir (first name) (surname), Bt, and is addressed as Sir (first name).\n\nA Baronetess, in her own right, is styled Dame (first name) (surname), Btss, and is addressed as Dame (first name).\n\nA wife of a Baronet is not styled or addressed as a Baronetess. Instead, they are styled and addressed as Lady (surname).\n\nChildren of a Baronet are not accorded any courtesy titles or styles.\n\nThis article is the intellectual property of Unofficial Royalty and is NOT TO BE COPIED, EDITED, OR POSTED IN ANY FORM ON ANOTHER WEBSITE under any circumstances.

Despite being the lowest rank, it is perhaps the oldest title. The rank was introduced by William I to recognize those who had pledged their loyalty to him under the feudal system. With this came the obligation to provide troops and support for the army, and the right (and often obligation) to attend the King’s Council They were charged with advising and supporting the King, and in return received protection from outside forces. In the mid-1200s, Barons started to be created by writ – personally summoned by the King based on their accomplishments or character, and not merely because of their ownership of land. By 1388, this was done via Letters Patent, and the once feudal claims to the title had fully shifted from territorial to personal. Additional degrees of peerage were soon added and they all become collectively known as the Peerage. The female version of the title is Baroness.\n\nIn the Peerage of Ireland, the title of Baron was first created shortly after the Norman Invasion of Ireland in 1169. One of the earliest was Baron Athenry, believed to have been created in 1172 for a member of the de Birmingham family. The title became extinct in 1799.\n\nThe Premier Baron in England is the Baron de Ros. In 1264, Robert de Ros was summoned to Parliament, and it was considered that the barony was created by writ that year. It was later deemed to have been granted to his son, William de Ros, in 1288, but with precedence dating back to December 1264. Unlike many titles within the peerage, this barony passes down to heirs-general, meaning it can pass to daughters if there are no living sons. In that case, if there is more than one daughter, all of them hold an equal claim to the title and the title goes into abeyance until such time as there is only one heir (or the Sovereign declares a sole heir). The current holder is Peter Trevor Maxwell, 27th Baron de Ros.\n\nThe last non-royal hereditary barony created was Baron Margadale, created on January 1, 1965 for the politician John Granville Morrison. Today the title is held by his grandson, Alastair John Morrison, 3rd Baron Margadale. The first Baron was also the father of The Hon. Dame Mary Anne Morrison, who has served as Woman of the Bedchamber to Queen Elizabeth II since 1960, and is considered to be one of The Queen’s closest friends and confidantes.\n\nSince that time, the only hereditary baronies created have been for members of the Royal Family:\n\nPrince Andrew – created Duke of York, Earl of Inverness and Baron Killyleagh upon his marriage in 1986\n\nPrince William – created Duke of Cambridge, Earl of Strathearn and Baron Carrickfergus upon his marriage in 2011\n\nPrince Harry – created Duke of Sussex, Earl of Dumbarton and Baron Kilkeel upon his marriage in 2018\n\nThe Life Peerages Act 1958 established the creation of non-hereditary peerages, granted for the holder’s lifetime only. These life peerages have all been baronies. Since that time, only 47 hereditary baronies have been created, while there have been over 1300 life baronies created (as of January 2019). The first of these was created on August 1, 1958, when William Jocelyn Ian Fraser was created Baron Fraser of Lonsdale.\n\nLord of Parliament\n\nWhile the title of Baron is the 5th rank in the peerages of England, Ireland, Great Britain and the United Kingdom, it does not exist in the Peerage of Scotland. Instead, the 5th rank is Lord of Parliament. Dating back to the 1100s, the basis for the title is very similar to the history of the Barons in England. Often landowners who provided support and troops, they became part of the Scottish parliament. Since the Act of Union 1707, which joined England and Scotland into the Kingdom of Great Britain (and consolidated the two parliaments into one), no new Lords of Parliament have been created. Instead, they are granted the title of Baron. Today, there are still nearly 100 Lordships of Parliament still extant, although many of those are subsidiary titles to more-senior peerages.\n\nThere have not been any women specifically created with the title, but many women have inherited it. Perhaps the most well-known today would be Flora Fraser, 21st Lady Saltoun and Chief of the Name and Arms of Clan Fraser. She has held the titles since 1979 when she succeeded her father. Lady Saltoun was married to Alexander Ramsay of Mar, the only son of The Hon. Sir Alexander Ramsay and the former Princess Patricia of Connaught, a granddaughter of Queen Victoria. (This made him a second cousin once removed of Queen Elizabeth II.) Lady Saltoun and The Queen have a close relationship, and she is formally considered a member of the extended Royal Family by Her Majesty. As such, she is often in attendance at major royal family events.\n\nIn Scotland, the title of Baron still refers to a feudal, or prescriptive, baron – one who owns an estate or manor. A Scottish barony is the only title that can be sold.\n\nThe first Lordship of Parliament – Lord of Abernethy – was established in the 12th century, and was the hereditary holder of the church and lands of the Scottish monastery at Abernethy. The oldest Lordship still extant is Lord Strathnaver, created in 1230 for William de Moravia, who was also created Earl of Sutherland. The Sutherland Earldom is the Premier Earldom in the Peerage of Scotland. The titles are currently held by Elizabeth Sutherland, 24th Countess of Sutherland and Lady Strathnaver, who is also Chief of Clan Sutherland.\n\nThe last created Lordship of Parliament was Lord Aberruthven, Mugdock and Fintrie. It was created in 1707 when James Graham, 4th Marquess of Montrose was created 1st Duke of Montrose and Lord Aberruthven, Mugdock and Fintrie, and remains a subsidiary title of the Montrose dukedom. That year, the Act of Union 1707 joined England and Scotland together as the Kingdom of Great Britain. Since that time, any new creations for the 5th rank of the peerage have been Barons. The titles are held today by James Graham, 8th Duke of Montrose.\n\nTitles and Styles\n\nA Baron or Lord of Parliament is styled The Right Hon. The Lord XX, and is typically referred to as ‘Lord XX’.\n\nA Baroness, in her own right, is styled The Right Hon. The Baroness XX, or The Right Hon. The Lady XX, and is typically referred to as ‘Baroness XX’ or ‘Lady XX’.\n\nThe wife of a Baron, or a Lady of Parliament (in her own or her husband’s right) is styled The Right Hon. The Lady XX, and is typically referred to as ‘Lady XX’.\n\nChildren of a Baron or Lord in Parliament are styled ‘The Hon. (firstname) (surname). Example: The Hon. Finbar Maxwell is the son of Peter Maxwell, 28th Baron de Ros.\n\nThis article is the intellectual property of Unofficial Royalty and is NOT TO BE COPIED, EDITED, OR POSTED IN ANY FORM ON ANOTHER WEBSITE under any circumstances.

There have been nearly 800 Viscountcies created in the various peerages, including 14 Viscountcies created for women in their own right. Over 330 Viscountcies are still extant, however the majority are held as subsidiary titles of Dukes, Marquesses and Earls.\n\nThe word Viscount comes from the Old French visconte, which itself comes from the Medieval Latin vicecomitem, and referred to a trusted appointee or courier, and later a count. In Anglo-Norman England, it was used as an honorific, typically referring to a county sheriff. Wives of Viscounts, and women holding a Viscountcy in their own right, use the title Viscountess.\n\nThe first Viscountcy was granted in 1432 when John Beaumont, 6th Baron Beaumont was created Viscount Beaumont by King Henry VI. The most-senior Viscount – known as the Premier Viscount of England – is The Viscount of Hereford. The title was created in 1550 for Walter Devereux, 9th Baron Ferrers of Chartley. The current holder is Robin Devereux, 19th Viscount Hereford. This is also the most senior Viscountcy with no more-senior titles.\n\nThe last non-Royal Viscountcy was granted in 1984, when former Prime Minister Harold Macmillan was created Earl of Stockton and Viscount Macmillan of Ovenden. The last non-Royal Viscountcy, with no more-senior title, was granted in 1983 for Thomas George Thomas, a former Speaker of the House of Commons, who was created Viscount Tonypandy.\n\nThe last Royal Viscountcy was created in 1999 as a subsidiary title when Prince Edward was created Earl of Wessex and Viscount Severn. This was the first time a royal prince was granted a viscountcy since 1726, when the title was given to two of King George II’s sons:\n\nPrince Frederick (later Prince of Wales) created Duke of Edinburgh, Marquess of the Isle of Ely, Earl of Eltham, Viscount Launceston and Baron Snowdon. The titles were inherited by his son, the future King George III and merged with the Crown upon his accession in 1760.\n\nPrince William was created Duke of Cumberland, Marquess of Berkhamsted, Earl of Kennington, Viscount Trematon and Baron Alderney. He died without issue in 1765 and the titles became extinct.\n\nIn 1917, four Viscountcies were granted to relatives of the Royal Family when they relinquished their German titles at the request of King George V:\n\nPrince Adolphus of Teck, The Duke of Teck – became Adolphus Cambridge, was created Marquess of Cambridge, Earl of Eltham and Viscount Northallerton\n\nPrince Alexander of Teck – became Alexander Cambridge, was created Earl of Athlone and Viscount Trematon\n\nPrince Louis of Battenberg – became Louis Mountbatten, was created Marquess of Milford Haven, Earl of Medina and Viscount Alderney\n\nPrince Alexander of Battenberg – became Alexander Mountbatten, created Marquess of Carisbrooke, Earl of Berkhamsted and Viscount Launceston\n\nAnd in 1946, Lord Louis Mountbatten, the younger son of the Marquess of Milford Haven, was created Viscount Mountbatten of Burma. The following year, he was also created Earl Mountbatten of Burma, which became his senior title. Both grants allowed for the titles to pass to his daughters (as he had no sons), and the Viscountcy became a subsidiary title of the Earldom. The titles are currently held by the 1st Earl’s grandson, Norton Knatchbull, 3rd Earl Mountbatten of Burma.\n\nThere have been 14 women created Viscountesses in their own right:\n\nElizabeth Heneage Finch, Countess of Winchilsea (1556-1634) – Elizabeth was created Viscountess Maidstone in 1623 by King James I. She was later created Countess of Winchilsea in 1628 by King Charles I. Both titles were hereditary, and remain extant.\n\nAnne Bayning, Viscountess Bayning (1619-1678) – the daughter of the 1st Viscount Bayning, Anne was created Viscountess Bayning, for life only, in 1674.\n\nSarah Monson Corbet, Viscountess Corbet – Sarah was the wife of Sir Vincent Corbet, 1st Baronet, an English politician who fought on the Royalist side in the English Civil War. Long after his death, Sarah was created Viscountess Corbet in her own right – for life only – in 1679.\n\nGrace Granville Carteret, Countess Granville (c1667-1744) – Grace was the daughter of the 1st Earl of Bath. Several years after the Bath Earldom became extinct, Grace was created Countess Granville and Viscountess Carteret in her own right in 1715. The titles became extinct following the death of her grandson in 1776.\n\nMargaret Coningsby Newton, Countess Coningsby (1709-1761) – Margaret was the daughter of the 1st Earl Coningsby, and was created Viscountess Coningsby and Baroness Coningsby in her own right in 1716. She later inherited her father’s Earldom, becoming 2nd Countess Coningsby. As she died with no male heirs, her titles became extinct upon her death.\n\nElizabeth Villiers Mason, Countess Grandison (d. 1782) – the daughter of the 1st Earl Grandison, Elizabeth was created Viscountess Grandison in her own right in 1746. Later, in 1767 following her father’s death, she was created Countess Grandison and Viscount Villiers. The titles all became extinct upon the death of her son in 1800.\n\nElizabeth Upton Rowley, Viscountess Langford (1713-1791) – Elizabeth was created Viscountess Langford and Baroness of Summerhill in her own right in 1766. The titles became extinct upon the death of her son in 1796.\n\nMargaretta Amelia Burgh Foster, Viscountess Ferrard (c1737-1824) – Margaretta was first created Baroness Oriel in her own right in 1790, as a way of honoring her husband, but still allowing him to continue as Speaker of the Irish House of Commons. She was later created Viscountess Ferrard in 1797. The title remains extant.\n\nCharlotte Gleadowe-Newcomen, Viscountess Newcomen (d 1817) – Charlotte was first created Baroness Newcomen in 1800, and then Viscountess Newcomen in 1803. The titles became extinct upon the death of her son in 1825.\n\nJoan Scott Canning, Viscountess Canning (1777-1837) – Joan was the widow of George Canning who served as Foreign Secretary, Chancellor of the Exchequer and Prime Minister before his death in 1827. Six months later, in January 1828, Joan was created Viscountess Canning in her own right. The title was inherited by her son Charles, who served as Viceroy of India, and was later created Earl Canning. All of the titles became extinct upon the Earl’s death in 1862.\n\nAnne Sutherland-Leveson-Gower, Duchess of Sutherland, Countess of Cromartie (1828-1892) – Anne was Duchess of Sutherland by marriage. In 1861, she was created Countess of Cromartie and Viscountess Tarbat in her own right, reviving titles which had been held previously by her ancestors. The Cromartie and Tarbat titles were granted with special remainder to her younger sons, as her eldest would inherit his father’s Dukedom. The titles remain extant.\n\nMary Anne Evans Disraeli, Viscountess Beaconsfield (1792-1872) – Mary Anne was the wife of Prime Minister Benjamin Disraeli. In 1868, at the end of his first time as Prime Minister, she was created Viscountess Beaconsfield in her own right. The title went extinct upon her death in 1872. Four years later, her husband was created Earl of Beaconsfield, and later refused the offer of a Dukedom from Queen Victoria.\n\nEmily Danvers Smith, Viscountess Hambleden (1828-1913) – Emily was the widow of politician William Henry Smith. Following his death in 1891, Emily was created Viscountess Hambleden. The title remains extant.\n\nMuriel Douglas-Pennant FitzRoy, Viscountess Daventry (1869-1962) – Muriel was the widow of Edward FitzRoy who served as Speaker of the House of Commons from 1928 until his death in 1943. Following his death, she was created Viscountess Daventry in her own right by King George VI. The title remains extant.\n\nStyles and Titles\n\nViscountcies are titled either using a place name, a surname, or a combination of the two, and rarely contain the article ‘of’ when using place names. The exception would be Viscountcies in the Peerage of Scotland, which were typically titled as The Viscount of XX. However, in practice, very few maintain that style, preferring simply to be known as Viscount XX.\n\nA Viscount is styled The Right Hon. The Viscount XX, and is referred to as ‘My Lord’, ‘Your Lordship’, or ‘Lord XX’.\n\nA Viscountess is styled The Right Hon. The Viscountess XX, and is referred to as ‘My Lady’, ‘Your Ladyship’, or ‘Lady XX’.\n\nUnlike eldest sons of Dukes, Marquesses and Earls, the eldest son of a Viscount does not use any subsidiary titles. All children of a Viscount are styled ‘The Hon (first name) (surname)’. Example: The Hon. Henry Devereux is the eldest son and heir of the Viscount Hereford.\n\nLIST OF EXTANT VISCOUNTCIES, in order of creation:\n\nWikipedia: List of Viscounts in the Peerages of Britain and Ireland\n\nThis article is the intellectual property of Unofficial Royalty and is NOT TO BE COPIED, EDITED, OR POSTED IN ANY FORM ON ANOTHER WEBSITE under any circumstances. It is permissible to use a link that directs to Unofficial Royalty.\n\nEarl and Countess\n\nby Scott Mehl\n\n© Unofficial Royalty 2019\n\nEarl is the third highest rank within the Peerage, preceded by Dukes and Marquesses, in order of creation. There have been 979 Earldoms created in the various peerages, with over 600 different titles. These include 21 Earldoms created for women in their own right. Of the 324 Earldoms still extant, over a hundred of those are held by higher ranking Dukes and Marquesses as subsidiary titles.\n\nThe word Earl comes from the Old English word, eorl, meaning a military leader. This likely came from the Scandinavian form of the word, jarl, which meant chieftain. There is no specific female version of the word, but Countess is used for wives of Earls, and for women holding an Earldom in their own right.\n\nThe title of Earl dates back to Canute the Great’s conquest of England in 1016. He divided the kingdom into several regions, which were governed by Earls. Following the Norman Conquest in 1066, William the Conqueror created the first Earldoms in the Peerage of England. These Earldoms still represented large areas of the country. The eldest is considered to be The Earldom of East Anglia, created for Ralph the Staller in 1067, and later renamed to the Earldom of Norfolk in 1070.\n\nThe most senior earl – The Premier Earl of England – is the Earl of Arundel, whose title dates back to c1138. Since 1660, it has been one of the subsidiary titles of The Duke of Norfolk, who is also the Premier Duke of England. The current holder is Edward Fitzalan-Howard, 18th Duke of Norfolk.\n\nThe most senior Earl with no higher peerage titles is The Earl of Shrewsbury. The title was created in 1442 for John Talbot, Baron Talbot, an English general who served in the Hundred Years’ War. Today, the title is held by Charles Chetwynd-Talbot, 22nd Earl of Shrewsbury (who is also 22nd Earl of Waterford, 7th Earl Talbot, 7th Viscount of Ingestre and 7th Baron Dynevor).\n\nThe last non-royal Earldom was created in 1984 when former Prime Minister Harold Macmillan was created Earl of Stockton and Viscount Macmillan of Ovenden. It was the first Earldom created in over 20 years. The Earl had served as Prime Minister from January 1957 until October 1963.\n\nWhen a Prince of the Royal Family marries, it has become tradition that he is granted a peerage – usually a Dukedom, and Earldom and a Barony. One notable exception is Prince Edward, the youngest son of Queen Elizabeth II. Upon his marriage in 1999, he was created Earl of Wessex and Viscount Severn. It is understood that he will later be created Duke of Edinburgh when the title becomes available. Prince Edward is also the recipient of the most recent Earldom created for a member of the Royal Family – The Queen created him Earl of Forfar on March 10, 2019, his 55th birthday.\n\nThere have been 21 Earldoms granted to women in their own right. The 19 women who received these titles are:\n\nMary Beaumont Villiers, Countess of Buckingham (c1570-1632) – created Countess of Buckingham in 1618, following the death of her first husband, Sir George Villiers. She is probably best known as the mother of Sir George Villiers, 1st Duke of Buckingham. The title became extinct upon her death.\n\nElizabeth Darcy Savage, Countess Rivers (1581-1650) – Elizabeth’s father had been created Earl Rivers in 1626. Following his death in 1640, the title passed to Elizabeth’s son. The following year, she was created Countess of Rivers in her own right, in compensation for having been passed over for the hereditary title.\n\nKatherine Wotton Stanhope, Countess of Chesterfield (1609-1667) – Katherine was governess to Mary, Princess Royal and Princess of Orange, and later became one of her closest confidantes and advisors. She later served Anne Hyde, Duchess of York, and Queen Catherine (Catherine of Braganza). She was created Countess of Chesterfield in her own right by King Charles II in 1660.\n\nElizabeth Feilding Boyle, Countess of Guilford (d 1667) – a member of the Royal Household of Queen Herietta Maria, Elizabeth was created Countess of Guilford in her own right, for life, in 1660.\n\nLouise de Penancoët de Kérouaille, Duchess of Portsmouth (1649-1734) – Louise was the mistress of King Charles II. In 1673, she was created Duchess of Portsmouth, Countess of Fareham and Baroness Petersfield. The titles, granted for life only, became extinct upon her death in 1734.\n\nElizabeth Bayning Lennard, Countess of Sheppey – daughter of the 1st Viscount Bayning, Elizabeth was created Countess of Sheppey, for life only, in 1680.\n\nCatherine Sedley, Countess of Dorchester (1657-1717) – Catherine was the mistress of KIng James II/VII, having first served as a lady in waiting to his wife, Mary of Modena. The King created her Countess of Dorchester, for life, in 1686.\n\nMary Stafford Howard, Countess of Stafford – Mary was the wife of William Howard, Viscount Stafford, who was stripped of his titles due to his part in the Popish Plot in 1678, and was executed in 1680. Several years later, Mary was created Countess of Stafford for life, in 1688 at the same time her son was granted an hereditary Earldom of Stafford.\n\nEhrengard Melusine von der Schulenburg, Duchess of Kendal and Munster (1667-1743) – a longtime mistress of King George I. In 1716, she was created Duchess of Munster, Marchioness of Dungannon, Countess of Dungannon and Baroness Dundalk in the Peerage of Ireland. Three years later, she was also created Duchess of Kendal, Countess of Feversham and Baroness Glastonbury in the Peerage of Great Britain. All of her titles were for life only, and went extinct upon her death in 1743.\n\nSophia von Kielmansegg, Countess of Darlington and Leinster (1675-1725) – Sophia was a half-sister of King George I. She was created Countess of Leinster in the Peerage of Ireland in 1721, and then Countess of Darlington and Baroness Brentford in the Peerage of Great Britain in 1722. These titles – granted for life only – became extinct upon her death in 1725.\n\nPetronilla Melusine von der Schulenburg, Countess of Walsingham (1693-1778) – an illegitimate daughter of King George I with his mistress, Ehrengard Melusine von der Schulenburg, Duchess of Kendal and Munster. She was created Countess of Walsingham and Baroness Aldborough, for life, in 1722. She also became Countess of Chesterfield by marriage in 1733.\n\nAmalie von Wendt von Wallmoden, Countess of Yarmouth (1704-1765) – Amalie was the principal mistress of KIng George II. In 1740, she was created Countess of Yarmouth, for life. Amalie holds the distinction of being the last Royal Mistress to be granted a peerage.\n\nEllis (Elizabeth) Agar Bermingham, Countess of Brandon (1708-1789) – Ellis was created Countess of Brandon in the Peerage of Ireland in 1758. The title, granted for life only, became extinct upon her death in 1789.\n\nElizabeth Cuffe Pakenham, Countess of Longford (1719-1794) – descended from the Earls of Longford from the first creation (1677), Elizabeth was created Countess of Longford, in her own right, in 1785. Unlike previous women granted Earldoms, the Earldom of Longford was created as an hereditary peerage. It is currently held by Thomas Pakenham, 8th Earl of Longford.\n\nAlice Forward Howard, Countess of Wicklow (d. 1807) – Alice was married to Ralph Howard, Viscount Wicklow and Baron Clonmore. Several years after his death, she was created Countess of Wicklow in her own right in 1793. The title was hereditary, but went extinct in 1978.\n\nHenrietta Laura Johnstone Pulteney, Countess of Bath (1766-1808) – a wealthy heiress, Laura was created Baroness of Bath in 1792, a nod to her mother’s ancestors having held the Earldom of Bath until its extinction in 1794. She was later elevated to Countess of Bath, in her own right, in 1803. The title became extinct upon her death in 1808.\n\nAnnabel Yorke Hume-Campbell, Countess de Grey (1751-1833) – a daughter of the 2nd Earl of Hardwicke, Annabel was created Countess de Grey in her own right in 1816. As she had no children, following her death the title passed to the son of her younger sister. The Earldom de Grey became extinct in 1923.\n\nAnne Sutherland-Leveson-Gower, Countess of Cromartie (1829-1888) – Anne was descended from the Earls of Cromartie, whose titles and estates were forfeited in 1746. In 1861, she was created Countess of Cromartie, Viscountess Tarbat, Baroness Castlehaven and Baroness MacLeod in the Peerage of the United Kingdom, by Queen Victoria. Unusually, the title was granted with remainder to her younger sons, and daughters (her eldest son would inherit his father’s Dukedom of Sutherland). The Cromartie Earldom is currently held by John Mackenzie, 5th Earl of Cromartie.\n\nAnne Mathews Cave, Countess Cave of Richmond – Anne was the wife of George Cave,1st Viscount Cave, who served as Lord Chancellor from 1922-1924 and 1924-1928. It had been announced that he would be elevated to an Earldom after retiring as Lord Chancellor. However, he died on the day his resignation was accepted, so his wife, Anne, was created Countess Cave of Richmond in her own right. The title was hereditary, but as none of her children lived to adulthood, the Earldom went extinct upon her death in 1938.\n\nStyles and Titles\n\nEarldoms are titled one of two different ways. If the Earldom originates from a place, one is created The Earl of XX (example: The Earl of Shrewsbury). If the Earldom originates from a surname, one is created The Earl XX (example: The Earl Spencer).\n\nAn Earl is styled The Right Hon. The Earl of XX, and is referred to as ‘My Lord’, ‘Your Lordship’, or ‘Lord XX’.\n\nA Countess is styled The Right Hon. The Countess of XX, and is referred to as ‘My Lady’, ‘Your Ladyship’, or ‘Lady XX’.\n\nThe eldest son of an Earl traditionally uses his father’s most senior, but lower-ranking, subsidiary title as a courtesy title. (If the senior subsidiary title is similar to the name of the Earldom, the next senior title is used). This used without the article ‘The’ preceding it. Example: the eldest son of The Earl Spencer is styled ‘Viscount Althorp’.\n\nIn the Peerage of Scotland, the heir is styled Master of XX if there are no other subsidiary titles.\n\nYounger sons of an Earl are styled as ‘The Hon. (first name) (surname)’. Example: The Hon. Edmund Spencer is the younger son of The Earl Spencer.\n\nAll daughters of an Earl are styled as ‘Lady (first name) (surname)’. Example: Lady Kitty Spencer is a daughter of the Earl Spencer.\n\nLIST OF EXTANT EARLDOMS, in order of creation:\n\nWikipedia: List of Earls in the Peerages of Britain and Ireland\n\nThis article is the intellectual property of Unofficial Royalty and is NOT TO BE COPIED, EDITED, OR POSTED IN ANY FORM ON ANOTHER WEBSITE under any circumstances.

Currently, there are 55 Marquessates, held by 51 people. For 34 of them, Marquess is their senior title, while the others are subsidiary titles of Dukes.\n\nThe word Marquess comes from the french marchis, mean ruler of a border area. Marchis was itself derived from marche – “frontier”, coming from the Latin marcha. Women holding a Marquessate in their own right and wives of a Marquess hold the title Marchioness.\n\nThe title of Marquess was first used in England in 1385, when Robert de Vere, the 9th Earl of Oxford was created Marquess of Dublin by King Richard II. Less than a year later, the title was revoked, and de Vere was created Duke of Ireland. In 1397, two additional marquessates – Dorset and Somerset – were granted to John Beaufort, the 1st Earl of somerset. These, two, were revoked two years later. It would be 1442 before the title of Marquess was granted again, and continued so until the 1930s. In total, 135 Marquessates have been created, consisting of 125 different titles. These include 1 woman created a Marchioness in her own right (a title which went extinct upon her death).\n\nThe Peerage of England (1385-1707)\n\n33 Marquessates created\n\n30 different titles\n\n1 Marchioness in her own right\n\n6 still extant\n\nThe Peerage of Scotland (1488-1707)\n\n23 Marquessates created\n\n22 different titles\n\n13 still extant\n\nThe Peerage of Great Britain (1707-1801)\n\n22 Marquessates created\n\n22 different titles\n\n8 still extant\n\nThe Peerage of Ireland (1642-1801-1825)\n\n24 Marquessates created\n\n19 different titles\n\n10 still extant\n\nThe Peerage of the United Kingdom (1801-present)\n\n33 Marquessates created\n\n32 different titles\n\n18 still extant\n\nThe most senior Marquess, known as The Premier Marquess of England, is the Marquess of Winchester whose title was created in 1551. He is also the only Marquess in the Peerage of England with no higher ranking Dukedom.\n\nThe last non-Royal Marquessate – Marquess of Willingdon – was granted in 1936. However, it became extinct in 1979. The last created, and still extant, is the Marquess of Reading, created in 1926.\n\nThe last Royal Marquessates were granted in 1726 by King George II to two of his sons:\n\nPrince Frederick was created Duke of Edinburgh, Marquess of the Isle of Ely, Earl of Eltham, Viscount Launceston and Snowdon. Frederick later became Prince of Wales, Duke of Cornwall and Duke of Rothesay, and was the father of King George III. His titles passed to his son, and reverted to the crown upon his accession in 1760.\n\nPrince William was created Duke of Cumberland, Marquess of Berkhamsted, Earl of Kennington, Viscount Trematon and Baron Alderney. These titles became extinct upon his death in 1765.\n\nIn addition, three Marquessates were created for relatives of the Royal Family in November 1917, when King George V asked his relatives to relinquish their German titles and styles:\n\nPrince Adolphus of Teck, The Duke of Teck – became Adolphus Cambridge, was created Marquess of Cambridge, Earl of Eltham and Viscount Northallerton\n\nPrince Louis of Battenberg – became Louis Mountbatten, was created Marquess of Milford Haven, Earl of Medina and Viscount Alderney\n\nPrince Alexander of Battenberg – became Alexander Mountbatten, created Marquess of Carisbrooke, Earl of Berkhamsted and Viscount Launceston\n\nThere has only been one woman created a Marchioness in her own right:\n\nAnne Boleyn (c1501-1536) – in preparation for her wedding to King Henry VIII, she was created Marchioness of Pembroke in her own right in an investiture ceremony held at Windsor Castle on September 1, 1532. The couple married several months later, and Anne was Queen of England until her beheading in 1536. The title was created with remainder to her “heirs male”, making it the first hereditary peerage granted to a woman. However, as she had no sons, the title became extinct upon her death.\n\nStyles and Titles\n\nA Marquess is styled The Most Honourable The Marquess of XX, and referred to as ‘My Lord’ or ‘Your Lordship’.\n\nA Marchioness is styled The Most Honourable The Marchioness of XX, and referred to as ‘My Lady’ or ‘Your Ladyship’.\n\nThe eldest son of a Marquess traditionally uses his father’s most senior, but lower-ranking, subsidiary title as a courtesy title. (If the senior subsidiary title is similar to the name of the Marquessate, the next senior title is used). This is used without the article ‘The’ preceding it. For example, the eldest son of the Marquess of Milford Haven is styled ‘Earl of Medina’.\n\nYounger sons and all daughters of a Marquess are styled as ‘Lord/Lady (first name) (surname)’. Example: Lady Tatiana Mountbatten is the daughter of The Marquess of Milford Haven.\n\nLIST OF EXTANT DUKEDOMS, in order of creation:\n\nPEERAGE OF ENGLAND\n\nMarquess of Winchester\n\nMarquess of Worcester – subsidiary title of the Duke of Beaufort\n\nMarquess of Tavistock – subsidiary title of the Duke of Bedford\n\nMarquess of Hartington – subsidiary title of the Duke of Devonshire\n\nMarquess of Blandford – subsidiary title of the Duke of Marlborough\n\nMarquess of Granby – subsidiary title of the Duke of Rutland\n\nPEERAGE OF SCOTLAND\n\nMarquess of Huntly\n\nMarquess of Douglas – subsidiary title of the Duke of Hamilton and Brandon\n\nMarquess of Clydesdale – subsidiary title of the Duke of Hamilton and Brandon\n\nMarquess of Montrose – subsidiary title of the Duke of Montrose\n\nMarquess of Atholl – subsidiary title of the Duke of Atholl\n\nMarquess of Queensberry\n\nMarquess of Dumfriesshire – subsidiary title of the Duke of Buccleuch and Queensberry\n\nMarquess of Tweeddale\n\nMarquess of Kintyre and Lorne – subsidiary title of the Duke of Argyll\n\nMarquess of Lothian\n\nMarquess of Tullibardine – subsidiary title of the Duke of Atholl\n\nMarquess of Graham and Buchanan – subsidiary title of the Duke of Montrose\n\nMarquess of Bowmont and Cessford – subsidiary title of the Duke of Roxburghe\n\nPEERAGE OF GREAT BRITAIN\n\nMarquess of Lansdowne\n\nMarquess of Stafford – subsidiary title of the Duke of Sutherland\n\nMarquess Townshend\n\nMarquess of Salisbury\n\nMarquess of Bath\n\nMarquess of Abercorn – subsidiary title of the Duke of Abercorn\n\nMarquess of Hertford\n\nMarquess of Bute\n\nPEERAGE OF IRELAND\n\nMarquess of Kildare – subsidiary title of the Duke of Leinster\n\nMarquess of Waterford\n\nMarquess of Downshire\n\nMarquess of Donegall\n\nMarquess of Headfort\n\nMarquess of Sligo\n\nMarquess of Ely\n\nMarquess of Londonderry\n\nMarquess Conyngham\n\nMarquess of Hamilton – subsidiary title of the Duke of Abercorn\n\nPEERAGE OF THE UNITED KINGDOM\n\nMarquess of Exeter\n\nMarquess of Northampton\n\nMarquess Camden\n\nMarquess of Wellington – subsidiary title of the Duke of Wellington\n\nMarquess Douro – subsidiary title of the Duke of Wellington\n\nMarquess of Anglesey\n\nMarquess of Cholmondeley\n\nMarquess of Ailesbury\n\nMarquess of Bristol\n\nMarquess of Ailsa\n\nMarquess of Westminster – subsidiary title of the Duke of Westminster\n\nMarquess of Normanby\n\nMarquess of Abergavenny\n\nMarquess of Zetland\n\nMarquess of Linlithgow\n\nMarquess of Aberdeen and Temair\n\nMarquess of Milford Haven\n\nMarquess of Reading\n\nMultiple Marquessate Holders\n\nThe Duke of Abercorn holds the Marquessates of Abercorn and Hamilton\n\nThe Duke of Atholl holds the Marquessates of Atholl and Tullibardine\n\nThe Duke of Hamilton and Brandon holds the Marquessates of Douglas and Clydesdale\n\nThe Duke of Wellington holds the Marquessates of Wellington and Douro\n\nThis article is the intellectual property of Unofficial Royalty and is NOT TO BE COPIED, EDITED, OR POSTED IN ANY FORM ON ANOTHER WEBSITE under any circumstances.

Precedence is determined by the date of the creation of the title. Currently, there are 37 Dukedoms, held by 31 Dukes.\n\nThe word Duke comes from the Latin word dux, meaning leader. In Ancient Rome it was used for a military commander, and later the leading commander of a province. Women holding a Dukedom in their own right, and wives of Dukes, hold the title of Duchess.\n\nThe title Duke was first used in England in 1337, when King Edward III created his son Edward, the Black Prince, as Duke of Cornwall. His other surviving sons were later created Dukes as well – Clarence, Lancaster, York and Gloucester. There were 16 dukedoms created by 1483, but only four remained by the time the Tudor dynasty began in 1485. In total, 160 dukedoms have been created, consisting of 106 different titles. These include 7 Dukedoms created for women in their own right. (6 women held these titles, all of which went extinct upon their deaths.)\n\nThe Peerage of England (1337-1707)\n\n76 dukedoms created\n\n43 different titles\n\n4 Duchesses in their own right\n\n11 still extant, including one Royal Duke (Cornwall)\n\nThe Peerage of Scotland (1398-1707)\n\n27 dukedoms created\n\n16 different titles\n\n0 Duchesses in their own right\n\n9 still extant, including one Royal Duke (Rothesay)\n\nThe Peerage of Great Britain (1707-1801)\n\n27 dukedoms created\n\n24 different titles\n\n1 Duchess in her own right\n\n3 still extant\n\nThe Peerage of Ireland (1661-1868)\n\n5 dukedoms created\n\n4 different titles\n\n1 Duchess in her own right\n\n2 still extant\n\nThe Peerage of The United Kingdom (1801-present)\n\n25 dukedoms created\n\n19 different titles\n\n1 Duchess in her own right\n\n12 still extant, including 6 Royal Dukes (Gloucester, Kent, Edinburgh, York, Cambridge, and Sussex)\n\nThe most senior Duke (aside from the Royal Dukes), known as The Premier Duke of England, is The Duke of Norfolk, whose title dates back to 1483. As the premier duke (and also the premier Earl as he holds the Earldom of Arundel), The Duke of Norfolk holds the position of Earl Marshal, one of the Great Officers of State. In this role, the Duke is responsible for major ceremonial events, such as the Coronation of the Monarch and State Funerals. He is also the head of the College of Arms, and is one of the four people who precede the Monarch in the procession at the State Opening of Parliament. Since The House of Lords Act 1999, as Earl Marshal, the Duke of Norfolk is one of only two hereditary peers who is automatically a member of the House of Lords.\n\nThe last non-royal dukedom created was The Duke of Fife in 1900. Alexander Duff had succeeded his father as Earl of Fife in 1879. Ten years later, in 1889, he married Princess Louise of Wales, the eldest daughter of the future King Edward VII. Two days after the wedding, Queen Victoria created Alexander Duke of Fife and Marquess of Macduff in the Peerage of the United Kingdom. The Letters Patent creating the title contained the traditional succession to the “heirs male of his body”. As the couple only had two surviving daughters, The Queen granted a second creation of the title in 1900, creating him The Duke of Fife and Earl of Macduff. These Letters Patent included a special remainder that allowed the title to pass to the daughters of the Duke, and then to their male heirs.\n\nUpon the Duke’s death in 1912, the original dukedom and marquessate became extinct. However, the second Dukedom, and earldom, passed to his eldest daughter, Princess Alexandra, who became the 2nd Duchess of Fife and 2nd Countess of Macduff in her own right. Following her death, as she had no surviving sons, the title passed to the son of her younger sister, James Carnegie who also inherited the Earldom of Southesk from his own father. The title continues to pass through the male line, and is currently held by David Carnegie, the 4th Duke of Fife, 13th Earl of Southesk, 4th Earl of Macduff, 13th Lord Carnegie of Kinnaird, 13th Lord Carnegie (of Kinnaird and Leuchars), 5th Baron Balinhard (of Farnell in the County of Forfar), and 10th Baronet Carnegie (of Pittarrow in the County of Kincardine). As the dukedom is his senior title, he is styled as The Duke of Fife.\n\nSince then, the only dukedoms created have been for members of the Royal Family. There was one potential exception when in 1955, former Prime Minister Winston Churchill was offered a dukedom by Queen Elizabeth II. But Churchill declined the offer and was instead created a Knight of the Order of the Garter.\n\nThere have been seven Dukedoms created for women in their own right. The six women who received these titles are:\n\nMargaret of Brotherton, Duchess of Norfolk (c1320-1399) – a granddaughter of King Edward I, Margaret succeeded her father as Countess of Norfolk in her own right in 1338, and was created Duchess of Norfolk in 1397 by King Richard II.\n\nAlice Leigh Dudley, Duchess of Dudley (1579-1669) – Alice was the second wife of noted explorer Sir Robert Dudley, who abandoned her and their children, settling in Tuscany, remarrying and selling all of his English estates. She was created Duchess of Dudley in her own right – only for life – by King Charles I in 1644.\n\nBarbara Villiers Palmer, Duchess of Cleveland (1640-1709) – a mistress of King Charles II, with whom she had several children. The King appointed her Lady of the Bedchamber to his wife, Catherine of Braganza, and in 1670 created her Duchess of Cleveland. The title passed to her eldest son, and then grandson before becoming extinct in 1774.\n\nLouise de Penancoët de Kérouaille, Duchess of Portsmouth (1649-1734) – a lady-in-waiting to King Charles II’s sister, the King later appointed her a Lady of Bedchamber to his wife, Catherine of Braganza. She became the King’s mistress, and he created her Duchess of Portsmouth, Countess of Fareham and Baroness Petersfield in 1673. Her titles were only for life, but her only son was later created Duke of Richmond.\n\nEhrengard Melusine von der Schulenburg, Duchess of Kendal and Munster (1667-1743) – once a maid of honour to the Electress Sophia of Hanover, Ehrengard became a mistress of the future King George I. After he became King, Ehrengard accompanied him to England, and in 1716 he created her Duchess of Munster, Marchioness of Dungannon, Countess of Dungannon and Baroness Dundalk in the Peerage of Ireland. Three years later, she was also created Duchess of Kendal, Countess of Feversham and Baroness Glastonbury in the Peerage of Great Britain. All of these titles were only for her lifetime.\n\nCecilia Gore Buggin Underwood, Duchess of Inverness (1789-1873) – after being widowed in 1825, Cecilia became the wife of The Duke of Sussex, the sixth son of King George III. As the marriage was in violation of the Royal Marriages Act, it was not recognized, and Cecilia did not gain any of her husband’s titles, or right of precedence. She instead assumed her mother’s maiden name, Underwood, as her surname. In 1840, her husband’s niece, Queen Victoria, created her Duchess of Inverness in her own right (recognizing one of her husband’s subsidiary titles, Earl of Inverness). Unlike many of the other Duchesses in their own right, Cecilia’s title was granted to her and her male heirs. As she had no children, the title became extinct upon her death.\n\nStyles and Titles\n\nA Duke is styled His Grace The Duke of XX, and referred to as ‘Your Grace’.\n\nA Duchess (whether a Duke’s wife or a Duchess in her own right) is styled Her Grace The Duchess of XX and referred to as ‘Your Grace’.\n\nThe eldest son of a Duke traditionally uses his father’s most senior, but lower-ranking, subsidiary title as a courtesy title. (If the senior subsidiary title is similar to the name of the Dukedom, the next senior title is used). This is used without the article ‘The’ preceding it. For example, the eldest son of The Duke of Fife is styled ‘Earl of Southesk’.\n\nYounger sons and all daughters of a Duke are styled as Lord or Lady (first name) (surname). Example: Lord George Carnegie is a younger son of The Duke of Carnegie.\n\nLIST OF EXTANT DUKEDOMS, in order of creation:\n\nPEERAGE OF ENGLAND\n\nDuke of Cornwall\n\nDuke of Norfolk\n\nDuke of Somerset\n\nDuke of Richmond\n\nDuke of Grafton\n\nDuke of Beaufort\n\nDuke of St Albans\n\nDuke of Bedford\n\nDuke of Devonshire\n\nDuke of Marlborough\n\nDuke of Rutland\n\nPEERAGE OF SCOTLAND\n\nDuke of Rothesay\n\nDuke of Hamilton\n\nDuke of Buccleuch\n\nDuke of Lennox\n\nDuke of Queensberry\n\nDuke of Argyll\n\nDuke of Atholl\n\nDuke of Montrose\n\nDuke of Roxburghe\n\nPEERAGE OF GREAT BRITAIN\n\nDuke of Brandon\n\nDuke of Manchester\n\nDuke of Northumberland\n\nPEERAGE OF IRELAND\n\nDuke of Leinster\n\nDuke of Abercorn\n\nPEERAGE OF THE UNITED KINGDOM\n\nDuke of Wellington\n\nDuke of Sutherland\n\nDuke of Westminster\n\nDuke of Gordon\n\nDuke of Argyll\n\nDuke of Fife\n\nDuke of Gloucester\n\nDuke of Kent\n\nDuke of Edinburgh\n\nDuke of York\n\nDuke of Cambridge\n\nDuke of Sussex\n\nMULTIPLE DUKEDOM HOLDERS\n\nDuke of Cornwall and Rothesay (England, Scotland)\n\nDuke of Hamilton and Brandon (Scotland, Great Britain)\n\nDuke of Argyll (Scotland, United Kingdom)\n\nDuke of Buccleuch and Queensberry (both Scotland)\n\nDuke of Richmond, Lennox and Gordon (Scotland, England, United Kingdom)\n\nThis article is the intellectual property of Unofficial Royalty and is NOT TO BE COPIED, EDITED, OR POSTED IN ANY FORM ON ANOTHER WEBSITE under any circumstances. It is permissible to use a link that directs to Unofficial Royalty.\n\nOverview of the Peerage in The United Kingdom\n\nby Scott Mehl\n\n© Unofficial Royalty 2019\n\nThe Peerage is a complex system of hereditary and lifetime titles within the United Kingdom. Know as Peers of the Realm, holders of these peerages were entitled to seats in the House of Lords – one of the two houses of the British Parliament. The Peerage actually consists of five different peerages:\n\nThe Peerage of England – titles created in England before the Act of Union in 1707\n\nThe Peerage of Scotland – titles created in Scotland before the Act of Union in 1707\n\nThe Peerage of Ireland – titles created in Ireland before the Act of Union in 1801, and some created later\n\nThe Peerage of Great Britain – titles created in Great Britain between 1707 and 1801\n\nThe Peerage of the United Kingdom – titles created since the Act of Union in 1801\n\nWithin these five peerages, there are different titles, listed below by rank:\n\nDuke (Duchess) – comes from the Latin word dux, meaning leader\n\nMarquess (Marchioness) – comes from the French word, marquis (derived from marche), referring to the borders between England, Scotland and Wales\n\nEarl (Countess) – comes from the Old English word, eorl, meaning a military leader\n\nViscount (Viscountess) – comes from the Latin word vicecomes, meaning a vice-count\n\nBaron (Baroness) – comes from the Old Germanic word baro, meaning a freeman.\n\nLord of Parliament – title in the Scottish peerage, equivalent to Baron in the other peerages. It ceased to be granted following the Act of Union 1707. (In Scotland, a Baron is traditionally the holder of a feudal dignity, not a peer.)\n\nThere are a few other titles that, while considered part of the aristocracy, are not actually part of the peerage:\n\nBaronet (Baronetess) – baronetcies are hereditary titles, but are not part of the peerage.\n\nKnight/Dame – those who have been knighted by the Sovereign, either independently, or as a member of one of the Orders of Chivalry.\n\nHistory of the Peerage system\n\nThe Peerage, as we know it today, grew out of the medieval baronage system which existed in feudal times. Barons, in those times, were responsible for raising troops for military service, and held land as a tenant-in-chief, in addition to attending Parliament. Over time, many of those ceased to be called to Parliament, making their baronies personal titles as opposed to territorial. The titles were hereditary, but only upon payment of a fee – called relief – by the new holder. The Tenures Abolition Act of 1660 eliminated this practice.\n\nThe first Duke was named in 1337, when Edward the Black Prince was created Duke of Cornwall by his father, King Edward III.\n\nThe first Marquess was named in 1385, when Richard de Vere, 9th Earl of Oxford was created Marquess of Dublin by King Richard II.\n\nEarldoms existed prior to the Norman Conquest of 1066. But the first Earl named in the Peerage of England was in 1067, when Radulf Stalre (Ralph the Staller) was created Earl of East Anglia by King William I.\n\nViscountcies became a title in the peerage in 1440 when John Beaumont, 6th Baron Beaumont was created Viscount Beaumont by King Henry VI. Prior to then, Viscount was used as a judicial honorific, typically referring to a county sheriff.\n\nBaronies – Barons first existed during the reign of King William I, who introduced the title to recognize those who had been loyal to him under the feudal system. They later became members of the King’s Council, a predecessor to the House of Lords.\n\nLords of Parliament have existed since the beginning of the Parliament of Scotland in the early 1200s.\n\nMultiple Titles and Peerages\n\nWhen a peerage is created, there is often more than one title granted. For example, when the Dukedom of Marlborough was created in 1702, John Churchill was created Duke of Marlborough and Marquess of Blandford, both in the Peerage of England. The Dukedom became his primary title, while the Marquessate became his most senior subsidiary title, in addition to several other titles he already held – Earl of Marlborough (England), Lord Churchill of Eyemouth (Scotland) and Baron Churchill of Sandridge (England).\n\nThere are also many peers who hold multiple titles in more than one peerage. For example, in 1675, King Charles II created his illegitimate son, Charles Lennox, Duke of Richmond, Earl of March and Baron Settrington, in the Peerage of England. A month later, he was also created Duke of Lennox, Earl of Darnley and Lord Torbolton in the Peerage of Scotland. He was then styled as Duke of Richmond and Lennox. Two hundred years later, the 6th Duke of Richmond and Lennox was also created Duke of Gordon and Earl of Kinrara in the Peerage of the United Kingdom. The current holder, Charles Gordon-Lennox, is one of only 5 people to hold more than one dukedom, and the only one to hold three.\n\nHere’s a fun fact about multiple titles – there are currently 31 Dukes, and they hold nearly 200 titles!\n\n37 Dukedoms\n\n21 Marquessates\n\n57 Earldoms\n\n17 Viscountcies\n\n45 Baronies\n\n21 Lordships of Parliament\n\n(and also 4 Baronetcies – a lesser title which is not considered part of the peerage)\n\nHereditary Peers vs Life Peers\n\nHereditary Peers are those whose titles are passed down to future generations. Traditionally, the succession is in the male line, passing from father to son, with only males eligible to assume the title. There are, however, several exceptions where the title has been granted with a special remainder allowing a daughter to succeed. This has typically only been done in cases where there are no sons to inherit. A notable example is The Earl Mountbatten of Burma. As he only had daughters, the Letters Patent creating his title included a special remainder allowing his daughters to succeed him, but then reverting to their male descendants. Hereditary Peerages continue to exist as long as there are legitimate surviving descendants to inherit, based on the succession defined in the Letters Patent creating the title. When there are no eligible heirs, the peerage becomes extinct (ceases to exist).\n\nLife Peers are those who are given peerages for themselves only, for the duration of their life. Life Peers are typically given the rank of Baron or Baroness, with only a few notable exceptions. Legitimate children of a life peer are accorded the style ‘The Honourable’, but they are unable to inherit the peerage itself.\n\nThe House of Lords Act 1999 reformed the House of Lords, which until that time had been comprised of several hundred hereditary peers. The Act removed most of them, leaving just 92 hereditary peers (and an additional 10 who were created life peers to allow them to remain). The House of Lords now consists primarily of Life Peers.\n\nPrecedence\n\nIn the very complex order of precedence in the United Kingdom, peers are amongst the highest level, preceded only by The Royal Family, Archbishops and High Officers of State. Wives and children of peers are also accorded precedence, as are widows – who take precedence over their successors. Former spouses do not hold any precedence, unless specifically decreed by the Sovereign. (See Wikipedia: Orders of Precedence in the United Kingdom for a full list of precedence for peers and their families.)\n\nRobes and Coronets\n\nThere are two kinds of robes worn by peers:\n\nParliamentary Robes – worn at a member’s introduction to the House of Lords, and at the State Opening of Parliament. They may also be worn when specifically directed, such as the Investiture of the Prince of Wales. These are worn by all peers and peeresses in their own right, but not by wives of peers. They feature a full-length garment of scarlet wool with a collar of white miniver fur, closed at the front with black silk satin ribbon ties. Bars of miniver fur (edged with gold oak-leaf lace) on the right side of the robe indicate the rank of the wearer:\n\nDUKE – 4 bars\n\nMARQUESS – 3-½ bars\n\nEARL – 3 bars\n\nVISCOUNT – 2-½ bars\n\nBARON/LORD OF PARLIAMENT – 2 bars\n\nEmbed from Getty Images\n\nCoronation Robes – worn only at the Coronation of a new Sovereign. They consist of a cloak of crimson velvet extending to the floor, open in the front, with white silk satin ribbon ties and trailing behind. Attached is a cape and collar of miniver fur, with the wearers rank indicated by the number of rows of ermine tails on the cape:\n\nDUKE – 4 rows\n\nMARQUESS – 3-½ rows\n\nEARL – 3 rows\n\nVISCOUNT – 2-½ rows\n\nBARON/LORD OF PARLIAMENT – 2 rows\n\n(NOTE: Royal Dukes have six rows of ermine, and additional rows on the collar and the front edges of the robe.)\n\nFor peeresses in their own right, and wives of peers, the Coronation robes are slightly different in design. They consist of a crimson velvet kirtle, edged in miniver fur, and worn over evening dress. The robe is attached at the shoulder, taking the form of a long train of matching crimson velvet, edged in miniver. At the top of the train is a miniver cape which has rows of ermine indicating their rank (same as those listed above). In addition, the length of the train is indicative of their rank:\n\nDUCHESS – 2 yards\n\nMARCHIONESS – 1-¾ yards\n\nCOUNTESS – 1-½ yards\n\nVISCOUNTESS – 1-¼ yards\n\nBARONESS – 1 yard\n\nIn addition to their Coronation Robes, peers are entitled to a coronet. This is worn only at a coronation, and typically is featured in the holder’s coat of arms. Coronets are worn by peers, peeresses in their own right, and wives of peers. They are comprised of a silver-gilt circlet, chased as though it is jeweled, but no actual gems are used. They feature different symbols based upon the wearer’s rank:\n\nDUKE- features 8 strawberry leaves\n\nMARQUESS – features 4 strawberry leaves and 4 pearls\n\nEARL – features 8 strawberry leaves and 8 pearls raised on stalks\n\nVISCOUNT – features 16 pearls, all touching each other\n\nBARON/LORD OF PARLIAMENT – features 6 pearls\n\nThis article is the intellectual property of Unofficial Royalty and is NOT TO BE COPIED, EDITED, OR POSTED IN ANY FORM ON ANOTHER WEBSITE under any circumstances.
