        "text": "page 13 note 1 There were many ladies thought of after the Empress's death and the giving up of hope of the Princess of Innsprnck: the Emperor's sister, the Duchess of Guise (a cousin of Louis XIV.), a Princess of Wurtemberg, Princess of Neuburg, the Princesses d'Elbeuf of the House of Lorraine, a daughter of the Due de Retz, a Princess of Spain, and two Princesses of the House of Modena. Louis XIV. wished for the Duchess of Guise, but Lord Peterborough pronounced her ugly. The Princess of Wurtemberg was thought of by Charles and James, but they changed their minds, and sent Lord Peterborough to see the Princess of Neuburg. See No. 59 of July 21. Her appearance did not please Lord Peterborough. This Princess afterwards married the Emperor, after the death of his second wife. See full particulars in “Les Derniers Stuarts a St. Germain de Laye par la Marquise de Cavelli,” 2 vols. 4to. 1871. The choice ultimately fell on Princess Mary of Modena.\n\npage 13 note 2 The Earl of Peterborough had been appointed Ambassador to Vienna for the purpose of concluding the affair of the Duke of York's marriage with the Princess of Innspruck: he had only just left England, and had not reached Paris en route for Vienna, when the news of the death of the Empress of Austria reached the English Government. He was immediately ordered not to proceed further. This Earl of Peterborough was the second of the title, and was through life a devoted friend of Charles I. and hi s sons Charles and James. He fought in the Civil Wars, and was wounded at Newbury. He died in 1697. He has given a detailed account of his mission in quest of a second wife for the Duke of York in his work on genealogies published under the name of Halstead.\n\npage 14 note 2 “Mr. Blood the elder” is the notorious ruffian who had attempted to assassinate the Duke of Ormond and afterwards to steal the Crown from the Tower, and had been not only pardoned by the King (astounding enough !) but taken into his favour and rewarded with the grant of an estate of 500l. a-year in Ireland. See Sir Gilbert Talbot's relation of Blood's attempts on the Crown and Duke of Ormond in Strype's Survey of London, vol. ii. p. 91, and Carte's Life of Ormond, vol. ii. pp. 420–5 These crimes of Blood were committed in 1670 and 1671. Evelyn relates meeting him at dinner at Sir Thomas Clifford's, then Treasurer of the Household, on May 10, 1671 (but there is some mistake about the date: it would probably have been later in the year), “Dined at Mr. Treasurer's in company with Monsieur de Grammont and several French noblemen, and one Blood, that impudent bold fellow who had not long before attempted to steal the imperial Crown itself out of the Tower, pretending only curiosity of seeing the regalia there, when, stabbing the keeper, thongh not mortally, he boldly went away with it through all the guards, taken only by the accident of his horse falling down. How he came to be pardoned, and even received into favour, not only after this but several other exploits almost as daring both in Ireland and here, I could never come to understand. Some believed he became a spy of several parties, being well with the sectaries and enthusiasts, and did his Majesty services that way which none alive could do so well as he.” The murderous assault on Ormond was a greater villany. Cart& relates, in his “Life of Ormond,” that Blood had pretended to the King great power among the fanatics. “He was admitted,” says Carte, “into all the privacy and intimacy of the Court: no man more assiduous than he in both the Secretaries' offices. If any one had business at Court that stuck, he made his application to Blood, as the most industrious and successful solicitor, and many gentlemen courted his acquaintance, as the Indians pray to the Devil—that he may not hurt them. He was perpetually in the royal apartments, and affected particularly to be in the same room where the Duke of Ormond was, to the indignation of all others, though neglected and overlooked by his Grace. All the world stood amazed at this mercy, countenance, and favour showed to so atrocious a malefactor, the reasons and meaning of which they could not see or comprehend.” Amazing, indeed, were the ways of Charles the Second's government! This reference to Blood in Mr. Ball's letter shows his connection with the Secretary of State's office.\n\npage 30 note 1 Muting, changing, means the same as moulting, but the word is very rare in this meaning. Richardson in his Dictionary gives one example from Beaumont and Fletcher:\n\n“Not one of my dragon's wings left to adorn me: Have I muted all my feathers?”\n\nThe Little Thief, Act iv. sc. 1.\n\nTo mute has another special meaning as applied to birds, and especially to hawks, which is mentioned in all dictionaries, viz. to make dung. The following curious passage is given in Halliwell's Dictionary of Archaic and Provincial Words from “Wits, Fittes, and Fancies,” 1595: “One used an improper term to a falconer saying that his hawk dunged. The falconer told him that he should have said muted. Anon after, the fellow stumbled and fell into a cowshare, and the falconer asking him how he came so berayed, he answered in a cowmute.”\n\npage 31 note 1 This letter is from Sir John Robinson, Bart. Lieutenant of the Tower, and a City Alderman. He was a member of the City Clothworkers’ Company with Williamson. Pepys mentions calling on him when he was Lord Mayor in 1663, and thus describes him: “My Lord Mayor, a talking, bragging, buffleheaded fellow, that would be thought to have led all the City in the great business of bringing in the King, and that nobody understood his plot, and the dark lanthorn he walked by; but he led them and ploughed with them as oxen and asses, his own words, to do what he had a mind; when in every discourse I observe him to be as very a coxcomb as I could have thought had been in the City:” and more to the same purpose (Pepys's Diary, March 17, 1663). Sir John was nephew of Archbishop Laud.\n\npage 170 note 1 This was a false report. The fight had lasted from the 11th of August to the 13th. Ralph thus describes the close of the fight, in which Spragge, fighting like a lion, was drowned, and Prince Eupert showed immense bravery and skill. The French played him false. “De Ruyter, with the residue of the Dutch Fleet, came up close with the Prince, and renewed the attack with all possible fury. Out of ninety, his Highness had but thirteen serviceable ships, exclusive of the French remaining: yet even with this wretched remnant of a Fleet, did he not only make head against the enemy, but recovered the wind, and, by the help of two gunships, put them into great disorder. Upon this he again made the signal for the French to engage; and had they even then, late as it was, obeyed it, without sharing the danger of the fight, they would have acquired the honour of the victory. But they continued still insensible, and the Prince found it expedient to give over the contest, and make the best of his way to port, whither he carried along with him the name and merit of a victory without any ef the advantage.”—(Hist, of England, vol. i. p. 240.)"
