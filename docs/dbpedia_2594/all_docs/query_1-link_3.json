        "text": "Sir George Carteret, Baronet (born c. 1610, St. Helier, Jersey, Channel Islandsâ€”died January 14, 1680, London, England) was a British Royalist politician and colonial proprietor of New Jersey.\n\nA British naval officer and lieutenant governor of Jersey, Carteret made the island a Royalist stronghold during the English Civil Wars and privateered in the Stuart cause, thereby winning a knighthood (1644) and a baronetcy (1645). After the capture of the island by a Parliamentary force in 1651, he went into exile in France, where he served in the French navy, but he returned to England at the Restoration (1660). There he became a powerful administrator and legislator. Censured by Parliament for laxity in account keeping, he gave up the naval treasury in 1667, though he subsequently held other important posts."
