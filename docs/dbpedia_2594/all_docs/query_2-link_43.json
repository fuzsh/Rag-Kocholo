Bradley (Justice of the Supreme Court of the US). After graduation, they all studied law together in Uncle Theodore Frelinghuysen's offices in Newark, and were admitted to the Bar in 1839. He was a strong Republican in an otherwise Democratic state: he supported abolition and President Lincoln, although a majority of Jerseymen did not. He was married to Elizabeth Wolcott Stites of Morristown, who produced six sons and three daughters.After the Civil War, he left his position as Prosecutor of the Pleas for Essex County, and formed a partnership with Anthony Q. Keasbey which became one of the \"busiest and most important in the State.\" Keasbey lived in Morristown, and wrote an important article in 1907 for the NJHS on the history of slavery in New Jersey. His son, Richard Wayne Parker, also joined the firm, and was later to become an important figure in his own right both in the fields of law and historical research. His highest ambition was to become an Associate Justice of the United States Supreme Court - a position which his friend Joseph Bradley attained (Parker wrote the memorial essay on Bradley for the Proceedings of the NJHS).

The author of this biographical sketch presents a variety of fascinating explanations for this British scion's descent into madness.

This biography details his public service as member of the Assembly, Council, Chief Justice, etc., as well as many important apsects of his private life. Military historians will especially value the list of men serving in the New Jersey Militia under Colonel Thomas Farmar in 1715. The document was found in the New York State Archives, presumably because at that particular time, both the provinces of New York and New Jersey were under the government of the notorious Robert Hunter. The names presented are still found in New Jersey, remembered on monuments or townships: Allen, Bloomfield, Bishop, Brotherton, Carhart, Conger, Crowell, Dunham, Everett, Randolph, Gano, Hude, Jaqui, Pike, Pitney, Veall, Buckalue (Bucklew), Parker, Elston, Frost, Gordon, Letts, Leveridge, Sherman, Walker, Freeman, Van Camp, Allford, Allston, Ayers, Bunn, Campbell, Compton, Day, Eddy, French, Illsley, Kent, Martin, Skinner, Wilkinson, Dunn, LaForce, Gilman, Blackford, Brockhouse, Doty, Drake, Martin, Sutton, Stockton, and many more (six Companies of about 100 men each) \"The Whole Including all Officers is 579\" William Haig of Bemerside by David McGregor | NJHS 1928 | 7pp | PDF 123K | $2.00 | B1\n\nThe memorial biography of Earl Haig, Commander-in-Chief of the British Forces in France and Belgium, traces this distinguished soldiers roots to Pennsylvania and New Jersey.
