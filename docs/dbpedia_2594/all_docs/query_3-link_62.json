        "text": "The Census Bureau's November 2010 revisions to the ACS/PRCS samples are now incorporated into the IPUMS:\n\nTo address problems in the Census Bureau's disclosure avoidance procedures, AGE has changed in the 2003-2005 ACS/PRCS samples and for the 2005 cases in the 2005-2007 3-year file. Ages were subject to change only among people who were formerly coded as being at least 65 years old. (The exception is the 2004 ACS, in which several people who formerly had ages of less than 65 now have ages of at least 65.) Because the new ages appear to have been created via synthetic data techniques, IPUMS has marked AGE as allocated (QAGE codes of 4) for all people aged 65 and up. The former, erroneous ages are now contained in a new variable, AGEORIG, which allows users to analyze the effects of the age revisions on their own research. Please note that the age revisions for the 2006 ACS have been available via the IPUMS since January 2010, with the former, erroneous values of AGE contained in AGEORIG06. AGEORIG subsumes the variable AGEORIG06 and provides original values for all of the affected samples and years, including the original values contained in AGEORIG06. Researchers should use AGEORIG only for sensitivity analyses; AGE contains more plausible values for people's true ages.\n\nThe Census Bureau's errors in adapting their editing procedures to the new 2008 ACS questionnaire have been corrected for the 2008 ACS/PRCS and for the 2008 cases in the 2006-2008 multi-year ACS/PRCS. (For more information about these errors, see ACS Errata note 53, note 54, and note 64.) These include the following household-level variables in the IPUMS:\n\nTelephone service (PHONE and its data quality flag QPHONE);\n\nKitchen facilities (KITCHEN and its data quality flag QKITCHEN);\n\nRefrigerator presence (FRIDGE and its data quality flag QFRIDGE);\n\nNumber of bedrooms (BEDROOMS and its data quality flag QBEDROOM); and\n\nNumber of rooms (ROOMS).\n\nSo that users can assess the sensitivity of their results to these corrections, the original, erroneous values are also provided (PHONEORIG, QPHONEORIG, KITCHENORIG, QKITCHENORIG, FRIDGEORIG, QFRIDGEORIG, BEDROOMSORIG, QBEDROOMORIG, and ROOMSORIG).\n\nBecause of an unspecified Census Bureau error, the variable represented by MOVEDIN contained erroneous values in the 2004 ACS. This has been fixed; the original variable is contained in MOVEDINORIG so that users can assess how their results may have changed.\n\nIn the processing of these revisions, several other variables changed slightly in the original Census Bureau data. These changes are not due to documented Census Bureau errors, and original variables were not created to preserve the changes. These changes fall into three broader categories:\n\nThe Census Bureau veteran variables represented by VET01LTR, VET47X50, VET90X01, VETKOREA, VETOTHER, VETSTAT, and VETWWII changed slightly for some of the samples in which the Census Bureau revised AGE, partly as a result of the age revisions.\n\nTopcoded values in CONDOFEE, FTOTINC, HHINCOME, INCEARN, INCINVST, INCOTHER, INCWAGE, OWNCOST, RENTGRS, and RENT changed slightly in some of the revised samples.\n\nThe changes in the AGE values affected the IPUMS family interrelationship variables, which rely on information about household members' ages. The IPUMS also uses AGE to classify the householder's in-laws, since the original Census Bureau data does not distinguish among parents-in-law, siblings-in-law, and children-in-law. Consequently, some people's values of RELATE may differ, although only in-laws are affected. See \"In-Law Classification Procedures\" for details.\n\nThe values contained in these variables are from the latest, revised Census Bureau PUMS file. Users interested in specific differences between the original release and the revised release may use the IPUMS archive page to compare the revised data with the older data.\n\nReleased new preliminary (penultimate) versions of the 1860 and 1870 samples. Frequencies in the documentation will not be changed until release of final versions of these datasets, scheduled for summer 2002. Two versions of the 1860 and 1870 samples are now available:\n\na flat 1-in-100 sample of all dwellings, and\n\na black oversample containing a 1-in-50 sample of dwellings containing one or more blacks and a 1-in-100 sample of all other dwellings.\n\nThe sample weights in both the flat and black oversamples of the preliminary 1860 and 1870 PUMS have been adjusted to be representative of the total population. Although we believe that the new samples are near their final form-we expect only minor changes in the number of cases and the coding of a few variables between the current and final versions of the samples--users are advised that the current releases have a few known problems. In particular, the occupation (\"OCC\") variable in 1860/1870 is not coded. Users should rely on the occupation 1950 basis (\"OCC1950\") variable for studying occupation and labor force participation. In addition, detailed birthplace codes are not available for individuals born in Germany. Users may still use the birthplace variable (BPL), but no detail will be returned for German birthplaces."
