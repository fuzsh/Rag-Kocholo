        "text": "Chloe Meltzer | March 11, 2024\n\nHow does the 11-word credit loophole actually work? The 11-word phrase has been making the rounds on the Internet as a way to get debt collectors off your back. However, you should be aware that this phrase may not be effective in all situations.\n\nIf you are being pursued for a debt, you might be scared and stressed out. Try not to let all of the debt collector's badgering calls get to you. If you need to take a break, you can use this 11-word phrase to stop debt collectors:\n\n“Please cease and desist all calls and contact with me, immediately.”\n\nHere is what you should do if a debt collector is contacting you\n\nIf a debt collector contacts you, then not responding is an option, but it is not a good option. Ignoring calls is one thing, but ignoring a Summons is a bad idea. You should find out if you actually owe the debt and if the statute of limitations is still active. The one thing you must never do is confirm the debt is yours. This can be used against you in court.\n\nHowever, it is a good idea to force debt collectors to validate the debt before it gets taken to court by sending a Debt Validation Letter. This document forces the debt collectors to verify the information they have about the debt. Many collectors give up after receiving a debt validation request.\n\nWhat is the 11-word phrase credit loophole?\n\nYou can say a number of things to stop debt collectors from phoning you. You have the right to instruct a debt collector to stop calling, even if the debt they are contacting you about is yours. Your goal is to get the collector to stop calling and contact you via written communication.\n\nRemember, these are the 11 magic words to stop debt collectors: ”Please cease and desist all calls and contact with me, immediately.”\n\nWhat the law says about debt collector calls\n\nDue to the long history of abuse by debt collectors, the U.S. government created the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act (FDCPA) to protect your rights as a consumer. This rule explains what is allowed and not allowed in debt collection practices and calls from debt collectors.\n\nAccording to the FDCPA, debt collectors cannot:\n\nCall before 8 a.m. or after 9 p.m.\n\nUse vulgar or obscene language to intimidate you.\n\nThreaten to take legal action that they cannot or do not plan to take.\n\nPretend to be a police officer or judge.\n\nDiscuss your debt with anyone other than you, your spouse, or your attorney.\n\nCall you at your workplace when they know your employer prohibits such communications.\n\nTell you that you will be arrested if you do not pay off your debt.\n\nSue you for a debt that is past the statute of limitations.\n\nIf a debt collector uses any of these tactics against you, and then files a lawsuit, you may be eligible for compensation. You can consider filing a counterclaim where you explain that the debt collector violated your rights under the FDCPA. You may also consider reporting the behaviors to the FTC or the CFPB.\n\nDon't ignore a debt collection lawsuit. Respond fast with SoloSuit.\n\nOutsmart debt collectors\n\nWhen a debt collector contacts you, there are certain steps you can take to protect yourself and outsmart them. Most consumers don't know how to communicate with debt collectors without making the situation worse, and debt collectors know this. They are counting on you to be ignorant of ways to protect yourself from their schemes.\n\nYou can outsmart debt collectors by following these tips:\n\nKeep a record of all communication with debt collectors.\n\nSend a Debt Validation Letter and force them to verify your debt.\n\nWrite a cease and desist letter.\n\nExplain the debt is not legitimate.\n\nReview your credit reports.\n\nExplain that you cannot afford to pay.\n\nSee if they have your updated address.\n\nNow, let's take a moment to break down each of these tips in detail.\n\nOutsmart debt collectors with SoloSuit's help.\n\nKeep a record of all communication with debt collectors\n\nEnsure that you keep a log of every single time you speak to a debt collector. Note who you spoke with, what they said to you, and what time they contacted you. This will help you remember all important information, as well as how often they call you and any inconsistencies in what they say to you. If you have any voicemails or messages with abusive language, you need to keep them because these can be used as evidence in a countersuit.\n\nSend a Debt Validation Letter and force them to verify your debt\n\nIf you suspect that the debt is not yours, or that is past the statute of limitations, try sending a Debt Validation Letter within 30 days of the initial contact with a debt collector. This letter forces debt collectors to verify that the debt they are trying to collect is valid and that they have the right to do so.\n\nMany debt collectors purchase old debts from original creditors, like credit card companies or banks. They purchase these debt accounts for a fraction of the original debt amount. During the transfer of the account, it is common for the collector to lose the proper documentation and proof needed to validate a debt.\n\nSo, when you send a Debt Validation Letter, most debt collectors give up.\n\nWrite a cease and desist letter\n\nUnder the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act (FDCPA), if you ask for a debt collector to stop contacting you, they must do so. There are only a few exemptions to this rule. It is good to note that your request must be in writing.\n\nWhen you ask a collector to stop communicating with you, it may become easy for you to lose track of the debt. This is something that you must decide for yourself. Regardless, if you decide you want the collector to stop contacting you, you can simply ask for this to happen. If this happens, the only time they may contact you is to serve you with a lawsuit.\n\nRespond to debt collectors with SoloSuit and beat them in court.\n\nExplain the debt is not legitimate\n\nIf you feel that you should not pay the debt, or that you do not owe it, then you need to make your case. Tell the collector that this is uncollectable and present your information. If you have a valid reason, the collector may voluntarily stop collection on the debt. Otherwise, you will need to present this information in court if the debt collector files a lawsuit against you.\n\nReview your credit reports\n\nYou can get a free copy of your credit report from one of the three major credit reporting bureaus (Experian, Equifax, and TransUnion) once per year. Check the reports carefully to see if you have any accounts that you are unaware of. If you find inaccurate information on your credit report, you can dispute the errors with the credit reporting bureaus.\n\nExplain that you cannot afford to pay\n\nIf you cannot afford to pay your debt, you can try to explain this to the debt collector. Although explaining that you can't pay does not mean they have to stop collections, it may push them to move on to another customer. This can also prevent your file from going to court.\n\nDo not admit that the debt is yours or do anything that could restart the clock on the statute of limitations. Instead, ensure that you do not admit you are responsible, nor state that you will pay off the debt.\n\nMake the right defense the right way with SoloSuit.\n\nSee if the debt collector has your current address\n\nAlthough you might want to hide from a debt collector, you want to ensure that you get all correspondence. Rather than change your phone number, ask them to stop calling. Then ensure they have your current address because you will never miss a Summons. If you miss a Summons, this will lead to the possibility of having a default judgment placed against you. When a default judgment is placed against you it gives debt collectors the right to garnish your wages and even money taken from your bank account.\n\nWhat to remember when talking to a debt collector\n\nThe 11-word phrase will prevent debt collectors from getting in touch with you by any means other than mail, but your debt will still be unpaid. As a result, you need a long-term approach to deal with the debt. Learn about the possibilities that are open to you. Then seek advice on which one is best based on your circumstances.\n\nLet's take a look at an example.\n\nThere are a few things you need to remember when a debt collector calls you. First, do not give out your personal information such as bank account number or social security number. You should also not offer a small payment to “get them off their back.” this could restart the clock on the statute of limitations. Above all, never make promises or admit the debt is valid. Otherwise, you can always ask them to cease and desist.\n\nWhat is SoloSuit?\n\nSoloSuit makes it easy to fight debt collectors.\n\nYou can use SoloSuit to respond to a debt lawsuit, to send letters to collectors, and even to settle a debt.\n\nSoloSuit's Answer service is a step-by-step web-app that asks you all the necessary questions to complete your Answer.
