        "text": "The first depth chart for the Atlanta Falcons’ 2024 roster has dropped as they get set to take on the Miami Dolphins this Friday.\n\nThe first depth chart should never be treated as if it were written in stone, but plenty can be deduced from it. It’s a good way to check if camp reporting matches what the coaches are seeing.\n\nAfter a quick review of the Atlanta Falcons depth chart, the team beat reporters have been on the money. There are still a few surprises, and some players are already in a tough spot as we gear up for the preseason opener.\n\nHere are the highlights from the initial 2024 depth chart:\n\nOffense\n\nOn the offensive side of the ball, everything is going according to plan. Rookie Michael Penix Jr. has checked in as QB2, which is where he needs to be at this stage in his career. Reps and patience are the only things Penix Jr. needs right now. Reports around the former Washington Huskies’ camp have been largely positive, and we see that reflected here.\n\nThe move that may come as a surprise to some (but not those who have been following the work of our very own Adnan Ikic) is that Ray-Ray McCloud is currently the WR3. By all accounts, McCloud has had a great camp, and that continued today as highlights surfaced from the wideout winning his one-on-ones in joint practices with Miami. Hopefully, Ray-Ray can continue his stellar camp and carry it into the regular season, providing another weapon for Kirk Cousins and the Falcons offense.\n\nDefense\n\nThe defense did have a few surprises, most notably Troy Andersen being listed as the starting inside linebacker next to Kaden Elliss. Raheem recently stated that Andersen is a starting-caliber linebacker and that fans shouldn’t read too much into camp rotations. Today, that statement was backed up.\n\nBy all accounts, Nate Landman has had a good camp, so don’t let the depth chart drive your opinion of him. The Falcons will still be calling on him a lot this upcoming season.\n\nThe outside linebacker position had its own surprise, unfortunately, and this one probably has more weight. DeAngelo Malone is currently listed at the bottom of the position group. Many hoped returning to a 3-4 base defense would help the player, but it appears that Malone isn’t thriving in the system as many had expected. The Falcons have had to cut ties with multiple 3rd-round picks in recent years (Jalen Mayfield and Desmond Ridder), and Malone could be joining that group if things don’t change. Malone still has plenty of time to move up this roster in a wide-open edge room, however.\n\nThe CB2 battle still belongs to Mike Hughes for now, but expect Clark Phillips to be right on his tail until the final depth chart comes out. The same should be said for strong safeties Richie Grant and DeMarcco Hellams. The battle in the Falcons’ secondary has been competitive, and that’s what this staff wants to see at this point.\n\nSpecial Teams\n\nThis wouldn’t be a proper article if we didn’t discuss special teams, where we see that Ray-Ray McCloud has been listed as the starting punt returner while Avery Williams is the starting kick returner. What’s interesting is that Mike Hughes is listed as the backup punt return man, not Williams. Williams’s strength pre-injury was as a punt returner, so seeing that he’s not listed as one on the depth chart was surprising. Rondale Moore is listed as the backup kick returner, but under the new rules, two returners are allowed to be in the loading zone, so the starter/backup designations here are likely a formality.\n\nAnalyzing the first depth chart should always be done lightly, but you can still start identifying trends and picturing how the puzzle pieces come together. What surprised you most from the Falcons’ first depth chart of the year? You’ll find the full version below."
