        "text": "Alternative rocker Matthew Phillips has recently released his third single, \"Time Fades Love.\" Following the success of his previous hits in 2023, \"So In Love\" and \"Till It’s Over,\" Phillips received recognition by winning the \"Best Pop Artist\" award at the San Diego Music Awards. Coinciding with this achievement, the official music video for \"Time Fades Love\" was recorded live in front of a full audience.\n\nMatthew Phillips is recognized for his thoughtful lyrics and vibrant pop style, as evidenced by his captivating storytelling in “Time Fades Love.” The emotional depth of his vocals enhances the rawness of the song's message about the fleeting essence of love. Poignant lines like “When love fades away, there is hope/don’t you give up on me now, I need you,” resonate over a sorrowful guitar and piano backdrop, eventually giving way to a transcendent soundscape that lifts the listener.\n\nWhen asked about the song, Phillips says, “It is about never giving up on someone you care about. It’s not strictly a romantic song, I am also referring to friendships and anyone who you care about. Sometimes we can get so busy with life we lose connection. It’s a song of hope and asking whoever this may be in your life to not lose faith in you. We need each other more than any of us would like to admit. The song is about working through conflicts, seeing them through, and coming out stronger together.”\n\nSave the date - Matthew Phillips is set to play a free show at the Spreckels Organ Pavilion in Balboa Park on August 29th as part of the “Twilight in the Park” concert series. “Twilight in the Park” is a non-profit that makes it possible to keep the arts alive and free in the local community.\n\nSan Diego-based musician, Matthew Phillips, is trailblazing across worldwide stages, pairing electronic elements, cinematic soundscapes and classic hook-filled lyrics that breathe new life into the alternative genre. On July 2nd, Phillips and his band took to the Main Stage at the Del Mar Fairgrounds for the single and video release concert of his debut single \"So In Love” with thousands in attendance. As for the reminder of 2023, the multi-instrumentalist shows no signs of slowing down with the release of his newest single, “Till It’s Over.”\n\n“Till It’s Over” showcases a vulnerable side to Matthew Phillips as he grapples with moving on from a toxic relationship.\n\nPhillips says, “I wrote “Till It's Over” from a place of uncertainty. Not really knowing where I stand with this relationship. The one thing I knew is it was very toxic. I needed to move on from but chose to stay out of fear of being lonely. It hurt deeply and during the recording of the song I had a few moments where I completely choked up and had to stop. “I am a shattered heart, I am a shattered soul” is exactly how I felt when I had to let go. It really hurt. “It's not over till it's over, but it's time to get over you” speaks to the notion that while there will always be history with this person. At some point it's time to move on and take a chance on finding someone else who will value you.”\n\nMelancholic lyrics brood over a lamenting guitar and piano before a frenzied electric soundscape surge in intensity throughout the track. Phillips’ vocals effortlessly convey heartbreak through the ebb and flow of the cinematic instrumentation. Despite the pain Phillips offers a glimmer of hope, “Love would be the emotion I am trying to convey. While in the moment it might seem like it's the end of your world. We have to make a choice to get out of the relationship and love ourselves. While the song is about heartbreak, it's more about making the difficult choice to set yourself free.”\n\n“Till It’s Over” is a must listen for anyone healing from a breakup and trying to find the inner strength to move on.\n\nCheck out the music video for “Till It’s Over.” The video was filmed live at the House of Blues San Diego on Nov 18.\n\nMatthew Phillips returns with a new single, “So In Love,” and a video release concert on July 2nd.\n\nAccording to Phillips, “the song is about being so in love.” He says, “It’s the things we are willing to do in that state of mind. An incredible thing about music is when people take a song like this and make it their own. I have my story as to what it means to me. I think it's incredible when we play it live and others will tell me what it means to them. Music is such a beautiful form of expression.”\n\nOn The Flipside Music was given early listening access to the song and here are my thoughts:\n\nTastefully layered with catchy guitar hooks, a synth bass and spirited drums, “So In Love,” is a vibrant musical delight that showcases Phillips’ ability as a compelling storyteller. The cinematic soundscape is complimented with earnest lyrics that hit hard through passionate vocal delivery. The melody pulses like a racing heartbeat as he professes, “I would do anything to have one more day with you/And I would say anything to have one more night with you.” Just when listeners think the song is winding down, in comes a rip roaring guitar solo that soars over the backbeat. The recording and mixing on this track is flawless and smooth from start to finish.\n\nPhillips says about the recording, “We recorded it with producer Jerrell Ayran and layered the arrangement in his studio. I went back and started tracking all my guitars and cut the lead local with Roy over at Rarefied Recording. We had 4 Mics across 2 amps and I couldn't be more satisfied with the tone we captured. I then linked up with producer Joel Piper over at Farmhouse Studios. We tracked all the backing vocals, he added a synth bass in the chorus and layered his incredible drum sounds to give it that final touch. It's something we are really proud of and it's time to share.”\n\nHot off the presses from Lost Records comes the debut single of Mikey Videotape’s “The Strangest Dream.” This progressive song has a modern day The Romantics - “Talking In Your Sleep” vibe with its electronic production.\n\n“The Strangest Dream” begins just like something from a dream with a whimsical sonic ambiance as Mikey croons softly, “Last night I had the strangest dream/Every number, every piece/One…Two…Three…”\n\nMikey takes listeners on an ethereal journey through the use of cinematic moving synths and hypnotic layered vocals. When the acoustic guitar outro abruptly kicks in, it snaps listeners awake from the lush lucid dreaming soundscape into a more traditional musical arrangement.\n\nListeners are left almost discombobulated as Mikey gently reflects with, “Everytime you fall asleep, you’re gonna wonder what it means/When you wake up, I’ll be gone, but the feeling lingers on.”\n\nWith elements of nostalgia and mystery blended among the programmed instrumentation, “The Strangest Dream” is an infectious earworm worth keeping on repeat.\n\nNeo Soul artist Padon Suber releases his new single, “Kinda Love.” This is the second single off his highly anticipated album, Love Daze, which is set to release later this month.\n\nSuber says, “Kinda Love is love in the form of infatuation of being so crazed about someone, for no specific reason other than the happiness you feel when you think about the way you function around that person. It’s that blissful feeling that makes you want to be with them all the time.”\n\n“Kinda Love” begins with a funky guitar riff and breezy background harmonies, as Suber reminisces about the joy of just being with his love. As the chorus starts, we learn that he’s not interested in something superficial, but just, the ‘kinda love’ when you and your love just can’t get enough of each other. It’s an upbeat and feel good love song\n\nSuber’s silky smooth voice croons, “Give me that 24/7 kinda love. You seen me 78 times but it aint enough.” The Neo Soul sonic ambiance and catchy lyrical professions is a perfect listen for long drives or just lounging poolside for the summer.\n\nDim the lights and get ready to take things nice and slow. Cigarettes After Sex are best known for their dreamy pop-noir ambience and sensual, androgynous vocals from frontman Greg Gonzalez, who describes the band’s songs as “erotic lullabies.”\n\nWhile all of their songs have that same lethargic vibe, “Nothing’s Gonna Hurt You Baby” from the 2012 EP, I, is a stand out track in terms of modern romanticism lyrics with a beautiful, subdued melody.\n\nThe song begins with a thumping bass as Gonzalez croons, “Whispered something in your ear.” As he proceeds to recount the wholesome yet romantic debauchery with his lover, the haunting guitars linger in the background accompanied by a delicate tapping of drums. The tempo picks up briefly with a whimsical synthesizer at the chorus, “Nothing’s gonna hurt you baby/As long as you’re with me, you’ll be just fine.”\n\nWhether you’re looking to have a passionate night or to just wind down and relax after a stressful day, Cigarettes After Sex is a band worth checking out.\n\nR&B artist Padon Suber releases his new single “Thursday” from the upcoming album, Love Daze. This soulful track is a celebration of love that is bursting with warm tones and blissful rhythmic grooves that will have you falling in love with Suber’s sultry smooth voice.\n\nAt the start we’re treated to heavenly harmonies telling us that “It’s Thursday.” Suber coos on counting down the days until he can finally see his love with, “I can’t wait to see your face. Monday. Tuesday. Wednesday. I can’t wait til this Thursday. I hope you’re on your way.”\n\nWhen asked about his new song, Suber recalls, “I wrote this song as an ode to one of my band member’s relationship with his girlfriend. Before they moved in together they shared a long distance relationship, he was in Houston and she was in Louisiana. They had a system where she would come stay with him at least once a month for a full week starting on a Thursday. I was so moved by the consistency of his response toward those symbolic Thursdays that I wanted to capture that moment in a song. I think everyone can relate to that feeling of bliss when thinking about seeing the person who makes them smile.”\n\nFilled with the soft strum of an acoustic guitar, gentle percussion, a spirited organ, and a powerful falsetto, this song is a beautiful addition to any romantic playlist or just to share with that special someone.\n\nAs featured on the On The Marq Radio Show with DJ Marq - Episode: Soul glo\n\nHeartfelt confessions and sonic backdrops take center stage on Minneapolis based artist Naja’s latest song, “Closer.” Jump starting into the song, Naja pours his heart out to the listener about not “needing no fancy things,” which builds the emotion with a concise drum beat before cresting into a layered echo of background vocals.\n\nAccording to Naja, “this song is inspired from trying to reject materialism and ego, and trying to pursue spirituality. I’m a recovering drug addict, and although I have been sober for over a decade, I find that drugs are a just symptom of my soul sickness. I’ve always tried to use external things to fix the way I feel internally.”\n\nThe profound highlight of the song comes with the piano melody cascading down like gentle raindrops to cleanse and purify the soul. As Naja coos his soulful harmonies delicately, a warm saxophone injects a funky jazz element into this already rich musical soundscape. As the song winds down, Naja leaves us with the overall message that real happiness doesn’t come from outside things, and yes, life is not always great, sometimes it’s full of fear, and we have to walk through it, but we don’t have to do it alone.\n\nReminiscing and regret, yearning and letting go, moving forward yet looking backwards…this pure and catchy song by Conrad Ashton reflects loving (and having lost) that one person who no matter what remains an influence in everything. These lyrics capture the hold of a true love that got away, a past love that was so strong that still infiltrates the present. A love that still lives in dreams. You can’t help but feel a little sad listening to this tale of a love that once was. At some point we all want to go back in time, to relive the best times of our lives. This song demonstrates that everything we go through in life does indeed become a part of us – especially when we find love.\n\nHeartfelt and sincere, Conrad sings from his core – you can feel how much he cherishes the memories of this past relationship. Love and hurt co-mingles together, and what is encouraging is his acceptance of it all – he is moving forward and realizing that what he shared with this love will always be with him, and because of this experience, even with his loss, he is never truly alone because his memories are always there.\n\nCool guitar rhythm (who would’ve thought you could jam along with a song about loss)? Conrad has brilliantly put together a song that we can all relate to – having the best of times with a true love, and then dealing with the aftermath when those times come to an end.\n\nCheck out Conrad’s website for more information.\n\nCh3ls releases her new single, “Crying Wolf,” a seamless blend of country, blues, and hard rock with a tinge of pop appeal, thrown in for good measure. She’s a spitfire powder-keg of talent ready to explode into the atmosphere.\n\nThe delicate opening guitar lulls you into a false sense of security as Ch3ls sweetly sings, “Oh you know/I used to care/ but how much can a girl take?”\n\nHer sugary sweet delivery comes as a surprise when you realize that she’s calling out a guy who did her wrong: “Don’t you know…You did it to yourself/so go lay down in that bed you made,” she croons casually before the tempo picks up and we’re thrown into a whirlwind of booming hand claps and somber backing vocals.\n\nCh3ls’ howls are justified when she reveals evidence of this man’s behavior: “A wolf in sheep’s clothes/ That huffin’ and bluffin’ is bullshit/I’m sick of your lying and whining, you crying wolf!” The electric guitar solo that ensues will have your heart pumping on an adrenaline fueled high. Before long you’ll find yourself howling along with Ch3ls’ fierce wolf pack. It’s well worth the listen.\n\nWithout even one glance out of a window, this latest single from artist Rob Drabkin lets you know what the weather is.\n\n“It’s a Beautiful Day” is so positive and uplifting, you may not even need that morning Cup of Joe to get you going. The guitar is very pretty, and Rob’s lyrics are just so smooth and soothing. As the song pleasantly soars you into the chorus, you want to get up and take that deep breath – breathe in all of the joy of this beautiful day. And you can just feel the sun on your face as you listen and take in this day that Rob has created and shares with you, feeling more than okay as you sing along with this anthem of celebrating today.\n\nAlthough his musical talents make it easy to believe he’s always been a full-time musician, Rob attended Trinity University in San Antonio, TX, where he graduated with a degree in Biochemistry and Molecular Biology with the intention of becoming a doctor. His focus quickly changed after a family trip to New York to reconnect with his father’s old musician friends. After that moment, Rob knew he wanted to pursue a career in the music industry. His song, “Someday” has already a spot on major Spotify playlists and in just one month, the single accumulated over two million plays from listeners around the world. I think we can agree that Rob made a great choice in a career change.\n\nClap your hands, move to the beat, and enjoy the vibrant horn arrangement - just drink in the fun of this celebration of life! And like a day that is as truly beautiful as this musical creation, as Rob tells us in his song - “whatever you do, don’t let it go, don’t let it get away!” No worries, Mr. Drabkin, we promise we will hit replay on this one!\n\nLet me begin by addressing the one disappointment I found with Blake Brown & The American Dust Choir’s new single “Stop Shakin.\" It is not fair, just not fair! How can you tell us to stop shakin’ to such a lively beat?\n\nLet me tell you, I am just loving how this song gets you movin’ and groovin.' And even though this song has some angst, it is a happy song, a song of hopeful reconciliation – a song of “ok, enough is enough – can’t you see I can’t take it anymore?”\n\nBlake's wife, Tiffany Brown and and his longtime friends Jason Legler, Adam Blake and Trent Nelson make up The American Dust Choir, creating a blend of indie rock and Americana. Blake’s music is rooted in acoustic sounds, and characterized by his seemingly simple, yet complex melodies and heartfelt lyrics.\n\nThis is actually a sweet love song, too. And what is that I hear? An echo of Fleetwood Mac in the music and vocals! \"Stop Shakin\" is the lead single off the band's debut full length album, Long Way Home. It should shake up the charts, for sure!\n\nAt first, I thought the bass is what I love the best, then – those guitars! And wait a minute, the keyboards, too! All in all, such a complete package of vocal and instrumental beauty. Did I mention I love this song? I cannot wait to hear more from you, Blake Brown!\n\nListening to Tim Lancaster’s latest single, \"Half-Life\" has left me in joyful wonderment.\n\nTim Lancaster is a multi-instrumentalist, composer, and singer. His music spans the spectrum of pop-rock-psychedelic-punk to modern jazz. \"Half-Life\" is the second single off his debut album, Conspiracy. With Conspiracy, Tim created a genre-bending collection of tracks that utilize a carefully selected range of instruments, effects and production techniques. He even built a pedal board from scratch, imagining exactly how he wanted the fuzz to sound and how the distortion should roar.\n\nThere is so much to love about \"Half-Life.\" The music itself is spooky-cool, an eerie, melodic sound that is all at once futuristic, yet it transports you to the past. With keyboards that pay homage to The Doors, some electric guitar riffs that whisper a little bit of Jimi Hendrix, drum beats reminiscent of the space-age beat of Billy Thorpe’s \"Children of the Sun,\" to Tim’s smooth vocals and performance channeling a bit of Alice Cooper – this song is a trip to the past, present, and future.\n\nYet with this pleasant transportation, \"Half-Life\" is truly Tim’s song and Tim’s song only. Such an eclectically-ethereal treat. This song is far-out for sure. Far-out in a good way, man. We are definitely feeling your presence with \"Half-Life,\" Tim, and we are all the better for it!\n\nI am so energized right now people!\n\nIf you haven’t heard it already, rush right now and listen to Kodacrome’s single \"Think of the Children.\" I promise you an awakening and a rush, a transportation into an electro pop dream, with beautiful vocals that are breathy and sexy, yet what a pristine sound! The techno-beat gets your feet moving, your head grooving, and your body shaking in a rapturous dance.\n\nKodacrome is comprised of Elissa LeCoque and Ryan Casey. The pair create fragmented pop with a warm electronic pulse, featuring swells and lead lines which ring from synths and throats, alike. Elissa and Ryan share a deep love for melodic composition and it certainty shows within their music.\n\nI particularly love the horns and keyboards playing along with the beat, a joyous addition to the composition. This is the type of song that keeps playing in your head long after it ends, the kind of music you tell the D.J. to “play it again”!\n\nA line in the lyrics tells us to “Stretch your arms out…” Indeed. Listeners will most definitely stretch their arms out in an embrace for this one. Think of all of us, Kodacrome, and keep up your excellent and eclectic work!\n\nListening to Jake Aldridge’s latest single, \"The Underdog,\" I was pleasantly haunted and inspired. The music is incredible. It’s melodic and ethereal beat puts me in mind of emerging out of the mists of a moor. Which is fitting, as his song about an underdog is all about coming from the bottom and rising to the top, and not giving up.\n\nLike a swirling mist that may obscure those in our lives (or even our own selves), that we might say never have a chance, \"The Underdog\" breaks through the clouds and comes into the light on the winning side. Jake’s moving lyrics convey in every way the struggle of the underdog, and how hard the battle is, and how lonely it can be.\n\nListeners can relate to feeling like they never fit in, and having to “fight demons for your freedom,\" as Jake raps smoothly and sincerely the plight of the underdog. Yet in this plight, what encouragement! Jake tells us we “gotta get up” and “stop wasting our potential,\" and even though at the bottom, with a long way to go, we can “live in hope for tomorrow.\" What an inspiration this song is, as Jake reiterates to the listener in his lyrics that the underdog doesn’t need a mirror to know who he is, and he offers to “let me show you,\" opening himself up to reveal who he is to us, keeping it real.\n\nJake is showing us his heart and sharing his soul to us in this song. A very moving part of this song is his tribute to his father, who he reveals he “lost at an early age, but his love remains.\" He also refers to being the son of a king. And my favorite line in the song is “a gift from God, the underdog with no collar” – how humble the underdog is to recognize where his gift comes from, and what imagery that there is nothing holding this underdog back!\n\nI will conclude this review with the beginning of this song, which is a montage of introductions of Jake Aldridge. One of the announcers introduces Jake with the underdog’s proclamation: “Don’t get discouraged, no matter what is going on in your life.\" This is the key to \"The Underdog\" coming out on the winning side – never give up. Bravo, Jake, for this brilliant song – you are definitely on the winning side with this work.\n\nOkay, folks. First, I cannot tell you how relaxed and chill I am right now. Listening to Yona Marie’s new single, \"My Soulful Baby\" has de-stressed me (can I say to the max)?\n\nIn 2010, R&B artist Rachel Marie Moore AKA Yona Marie first gained mainstream popularity by releasing 'The Luv Exposure' featuring artists, producers, and singers from all over the world. The lead single was featured on a Majormix release which included Chris Brown, Ace Hood, and Tyga.\n\nMarie followed up with the release of \"High,\" a 90's styled instrumental garnering over 100,000 listeners and 20,000 downloads. In 2014, Marie released her full length album, \"Reminiscent\" which eventually led her to collaborate with EDM producer Eli in 2016 to create the viral track, \"Just Wanna Love You\" which hit over half a millions plays between Spotify, Youtube, and Soundcloud.\n\nMarie's soothing, soulful voice is such a balm to the soul. And what a song! With hints of Diana Ross’s voice, and such sensuality flowing from her heart-felt words that I am put into the mind of hearing a female version of some of Barry White’s work, Yona Marie is indeed a multi-talented artist.\n\nThe musical arrangement is very cool and smooth - the keyboards and groovy guitars and the beat just carries \"My Soulful Baby\" onto the dance floor for a romantic slow dance. The music to this song, along with the lyrics, takes me back to another time – a time when this world cared a little more and loved a little more. Thanks, Yona Marie, for helping bring us back to this time with your beautiful love song."
