        "text": "WHAT IT IS: The Music City native and singer/songwriter made his imprint on the Nashville community before he realized the extent of his craft. He recently released his self-titled EP, penning four of the five songs and collaborating with producer Jimmy Robbins. Creating a buzz among critics, the burgeoning talent has already been named one of CMT’s Listen Up Artists, featured as a Rolling Stone Artist You Need to Know and highlighted as an Artist to Watch by Huffington Post. Throughout his time in Nashville, the budding entertainer has worked with notable songwriters, such as Shane MacAnally, Andrew Dorff, Josh Osborne, Jonathan Singleton, Nathan Barlowe, Brandy Clark and Trevor Rosen, among others. Hummon also wrote with Steven Tyler on his current single, “Red, White and You.” Signed to The Valory Music Co., Levi joined a roster chalked full of diverse talent. His EP is a glimpse into his zest for life and thirst for adventure, and serves as a homage to his upbringing.\n\nALBUM: Levi Hummon (EP)\n\nRELEASE DATE: 4/1\n\nSINGLE: “Guts and Glory”\n\nLIVE: Ram Truck “Guts & Glory” promotional tour\n\nPRESS: Huffington Post, Rolling Stone, CMT, Music Row, Sounds Like Nashville, The Tennessean, People, more\n\nBOOKING: Blake McDaniel, Shannon Casey/CAA\n\nPUBLISHING: Desmond Child, Deston Entertainment (administered by Kobalt)\n\nMANAGEMENT: Fletcher Foster (Brian O’Neil - day)/Iconic Entertainment"
