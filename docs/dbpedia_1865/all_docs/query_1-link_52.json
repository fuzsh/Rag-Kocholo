        "text": "Boston’s Only Child is putting a synth bounce in everyone’s step with their new single “Defeater,” out now via Casey Desmond’s Jungle Up Records. The song will be featured on the Only Child’s forthcoming EP, which is set for a 2023 release and also produced by the Bostonian Electro-Pop queen.\n\n“Defeater” is a song about the would-be lover who did us wrong. It follows Only Child’s summer single “Don’t Call Me BB,” and showcases Boston singer-songwriter and multi-instrumentalist Christopher James Martin’s knack for both pop melody and acerbic, yet humorous lyricisms.\n\nOnly Child had the following to say about the new release:\n\n“‘Defeater’ is kind of a continuation of the themes covered in ‘Don’t Call Me BB’, about being infatuated with someone you shouldn’t be, with the added twist being ‘you tell yourself you know better, but you’re still falling for it’. In some ways, I feel like ‘Defeater’ distills what I was trying to do with this EP and this whole project, both sonically and lyrically, in one song.”\n\nStream the new single below and keep checking back for more from Only Child!"
