Perplexed. Passionate. If these three words were a song, Jillian Marie Kelleher would sing them. In the meantime, she’s busy breaking her way onto the music scene with a classic and powerful pop/soul sound, sophisticated lyrics and an emotional performance that lures you in and smacks you awake.\n\nA self-pronounced a-cappella nerd and one-time musical theater major, Jillian has dabbled in performing her entire life. From hosting a talk-show for MSNBC to touring frat parties in a southern rock band, Jillian gets her thrills from connecting with an audience and being a renaissance woman. In fact, she was recently flown to Klon, Germany to perform as a rapper with Def Jam and 4MM Games at Europe’s largest video-gaming convention “Gamescom”– a true testament to her multi-faceted approach.\n\nWhen she’s not on stage, Jillian is the CEO/Founder of Connector Entertainment Group a full-service agency that specializes in optimizing opportunity for various lifestyle & entertainment brands. She plans to release her first single “Girl Like Me” in Fall, 2010\n\nSocial Networks:\n\nFacebook\n\nTwitter\n\nDJ Brendan Fallis\n\nSocial Networks:\n\nTwitter\n\nFacebook\n\nManagement Company: RKM Talent\n\nManagement Contact: laura@rkmtalent.com\n\nA Little Bit of Info About The Event’s Host: Sound Museum Music\n\nSocial Networks:\n\nTwitter: http://www.twitter.com/soundmuseum"
