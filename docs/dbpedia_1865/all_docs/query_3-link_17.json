        "text": "Tonight Desmond will open for the dance-pop trio,The Dragonettes, at The Paradise Rock Club in Boston, promising to unveil four or five new tunes in her half-hour set. When we caught up with Desmond on Monday, she was still bubbling over from having spent the weekend filming a new video for the forthcoming album, \"Deja Vu,\" which she hopes to have ready by the end of the year.\n\nDesmond's music is effervescent pop with folkie undertones, yet enough rhythmic spice to keep a dancefloor hopping. Most local fans already know her parents, Bill and Katherine, played in the 1970s-80s Beantown rock band The Bentmen.\n\n\"I've been writing a lot, and working on everything,\" Desmond laughed. \"Since we were doing this video over the weekend, I've been doing my costumes and props too. Since 'The Voice' I've toured quite a bit, done a lot of music festivals, and shot two videos before this one. I'm pretty excited about my next album, \"Deja Vu,\" and we're also going to be releasing it on vinyl this time. But I've also been writing songs already for my next album after this one--once we release \"Deja Vu\" and start touring it will get hectic, so I wanted to have some writing done, so I won't have to worry about taking time off to write the next one.\"\n\nNaturally, everyone asks Desmond how her tv experience helped, or hindered her career, and if perhaps her appearance won her new fans or had some fans assuming she was something she's not. On her final show, she had to sing Elton John's \"Don't Let The Sun Go Down On Me\" with another contestant, who ended up winning that faceoff.\n\n\"I'll forever be grateful for what that show did for me,\" Desmond said without hesitation. \"It would've been nice to have the financial reward of winning, but for the purposes of my personal growth, and my exposure within the music industry, what it did for me was wonderful. It was an awesome experience. It prepared me to go forward in the music industry.\"\n\n\"I've always had no problem about getting up and performing, but I was not always good about promoting my music, or, for instance, doing interviews,\" Desmond noted. \"Once I had done it in that setting, the whole thing just was not as scary. I found I was not terrified about my first time on tv, but really filled with anticipation. I'm stronger for having that experience. I still have people come up to me on the street and talk about it. It helped to strengthen my confidence--it's always nice to hear people say they really like your music. So I appreciate what I got out of that, and I will always think 'The Voice' is awesome.\"\n\nDesmond has always loved desinging her own costumes, and recently she played at Fashion's Night Out at The Estate in Boston.\n\n\"The show at The Estate was a lot of fun,\" she said. \"I try to stay productive and connected to the creative community in Boston. I don't disappear--mystery is not charming. I'm super-sociable. I think our city has a terrific arts community, and it's great to see artists working together. Growing up, it often seemed like it was a very competitive scene, but now I can say I've been so enriched by working, and just hanging out with some of the city's other artists, and not just musicians.\"\n\nAs for her songwriting, Desmond has also profited from working with several other songwriters, most notably former Bostonian Robert Ellis Orrall, now an established Nashville tunesmith. Orrall and his band played a kind of twangy rock when he was playing around here, but he's successfully plied his writing trade for a long list of country stars.\n\n\"I have gone down to Nashville and written with Robert,\" said Desmond. \"It's not so much a case of refining my technique as it is that Robert knows naturally, and technically, how to write a hit song. He just naturally writes amazing melodies. Rhythm and rhyme are very important to me--I'm a stickler!--and Robert is especially good at that. He's a very talented writer, obviously, and the fact that someone like that wants to write with me is very reassuring.\"\n\n\"It's kind of a natural continuum, because Robert is about my father's age,\" Desmond said with a chuckle. \"I haven't yet written a song with my dad, but he has helped with recordings and videos. My family are all artsy types, so my video crew last weekend was all family, or friends who are just like family. My brother is an illustrator, and my sister is a photographer, and both have helped me out tremendously. My sister's boyfriend has a video studio, Red Hot Box, in Cambridge, so that was the core of my film crew.\"\n\nDesmond's band is the same as it has been for the past three years or so, which is to say she's still creating stunning sounds with just herself and multi-instrumentalist Taylor Barefoot. They record in his studio, or Desmond's own home studio, or wherever the mood strikes. Barefoot's ever-expanding sonic palette has given Desmond's music its unique, genre-smashing feel. He's more than your common guitarist.\n\n\"We always always perform as just me and him,\" Desmond said. \"I bring out other stuff, like weird toys from the '80s that make funny noises. But Taylor uses two different soundboards, and that lets him create many different soundscapes for us. Way back when we started we'd have lots of studio guests when we recorded, but these days it's usually just the two of us, playing all the different stuff.\"\n\n\"Taylor also has these things he calls 'pedal shout-outs,'\" Desmond added. \"He does those with these electronic companies that might take a boutique pedal and hook it up to various effects, and then Taylor does a video which demonstrates how it all works. It has resulted in Taylor becoming a kind of underground star with all the 'gear-nerds.' He has his own following; a lot of people who only recognize him from those videos. If you care about that sort of thing, it can be very complicated, but Taylor makes it all sound pretty normal and easy in his pedal shout-outs, so those people love him.\"\n\nDesmond, who noted she is \"about five or six songs deep\" in writing the next album, said she is a longtime fan of Dragonette, and is looking forward to tonight's show. There's a California trip on her fall schedule, mostly a chance to connect with old friends and get some more writing done.\n\n\"I am so thrilled to be on this Dragonette gig,\" said Desmond. \"Actually I'm a big fan of theirs, and they've had some super-catchy tunes. My own set will be limited to about half an hour, but I expect it will all be new tunes, and I can't wait. There's nothing I love more than being up onstage, dancing like a nut, in spandex!\""
