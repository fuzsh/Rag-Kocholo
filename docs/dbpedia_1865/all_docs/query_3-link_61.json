        "text": "posted in: Music News • Pop\n\nIf you’re not yet familiar with OurStage artist and recent MTV Buzzworthy sensation Casey Desmond, you’ve really got to change that. Luckily, we’re about to fix that. Between her stint on Season 1 of The Voice, writing, performing and re-mixing her own music, and even designing her own costumes, we don’t know how she had time to create one of the funkiest music videos we’ve seen in a while for her song “Bad Habit.” But boy, are we glad she did. Filled with silhouettes, electro-pop, and plenty of energy, you don’t want to miss this. Check it out after the jump.\n\nIf you like Casey Desmond check out OurStage artist Andrea Godin.\n\nMore like this:"
