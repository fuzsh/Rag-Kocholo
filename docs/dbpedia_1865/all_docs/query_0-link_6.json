It started with a reputation as \"low life\" music, associated with bordel- los and rent parties. It is now considered an art form on level terms with Western classical music, performed in the great concert halls of the world, but without ever abandoning the visceral excitement and rhythmic drive it had enjoyed from the outset. This collection of 50 or so biographies, plus a collection of shorter life sto- ries in the \"More ... to Remember\" sections at the end of each main part, can- not hope to be a comprehensive narrative history of jazz. For that, you will need to look in the bibliography in the appendix for some suggestions. The select discography in the appendix offers a snapshot history of jazz on CD. It is by no means the whole picture, but sufficient to get a good idea of how the sound of jazz developed. Nevertheless, the lives of the men and women covered in this book are central to the development of jazz; if you read their profiles in sequence, much of the story of jazz itself will unfold. Among them are most of the innovative instrumentalists, bandleaders, and composers who shaped the music as it grew, and who kept its spirit of development alive and well nour- ished. The discography at the end of each profile will also guide you to CDs to hear how each individual's music progressed. Not all the musicians here had easy lives. Poverty was seldom far away from the early pioneers, and the specters of alcoholism and drug addiction hang over many of the lives described in the later sections of the book. Yet amid all the hardships, there were individual successes, and above all, a success story for jazz itself, which has continued to develop, and to fight off every challenge that has threatened to kill it off or sideline it from popular awareness. Rhythm and blues, for example, was a threat in the 1940s, but it was absorbed into the playing of many jazz musicians. Likewise, the jazz-rock fusion movement of the 1960s and 1970s, spearheaded by Miles Davis, Herbie Hancock, and Chick Corea, became a new form of jazz in its own right. In my day-to-day work as a newspaper critic and radio presenter, I constantly hear new discs and new performers. The most heartening thing about jazz as it goes into the 21st century is its resilience, and the number of enthusiastic young musicians who are appearing, ready to take the music forward at a time when many of the founders of jazz are no longer with us. The second century of jazz promises to be just as exciting, exhilarating, and challenging as the first. Alyn Shipton Oxford, England PREFACE • 7 Early jazz met the blues in the Wildcat Jazz Band fronted by the great blues singer Ma Rainey. In a jazz era costume, she was pho- tographed with her band — featuring, from left to right, \"Gabriel\" on drums, Albert Wynn on trombone, Dave Nelson on trumpet, Ed Pollack on alto saxophone, and \"GeorgiaTom\" Dorsey on piano — in 1924-25. 8 • JAZZ MAKERS The Pioneers jt In New York City's Avery Fisher Hall, the last notes die away. j&gSr Wynton Marsalis lowers his trumpet and looks at the capacity audi- Jfflf ence as it breaks into spontaneous applause. Another annual season of Lincoln Center Jazz Concerts gets under way, and there is every sign that jazz music is alive and well, and set to flourish for many years to come. When ragtime, the blues, military marches, social dances, and the rhythms of African drums came together at the end of the 19th century into what be- came known as jazz, few of its originators had any idea that they were creating a new and distinctive form of American music that would be filling the world's concert halls well over 100 years later. Throughout that century of development, jazz continued to grow and to absorb new ideas. In the second half of the 20th century, jazz became a truly international music, drawing in musicians from Europe, Africa, Asia, and South America alongside its American originators. It is that very flexibility and adaptability that makes jazz so healthy as it moves into the 21st century. Individual musicians have always played a very significant role in the devel- opment of jazz. Because jazz involves improvisation — the ability to create new melodies and rhythms on the spur of the moment — its direction has been shaped by three distinct groups of people. First are the players, those musicians whose command over their instruments allows them to turn any idea into musical sounds almost at the speed of thought itself. Second are the bandleaders, the organizers who provide a framework in which improvisers can work. Third are the composers and arrangers, who provide the raw material for jazz musicians to play. In practice, these three groups are mixed: many instrumentalists are also bandleaders and composers. Almost all jazz comes from these groups working together, and it is very rarely the product of improvisation alone. Jazz was not created overnight. The elements that grew together to form the new style of music were present in more than one region of the United States for several years before they coalesced into a recognizable new development. Rag- time, for instance, was a jaunty style of solo piano music with heavily accented or syncopated rhythms. It incorporated the cakewalk (a dance that involves cou- ples strutting, bowing, and kicking, which was popularized by American minstrel shows in the second half of the 19th century and imitated as far away as France IN THIS PART SCOTT JOPLIN JELLY ROLL MORTON KING OLIVER LOUIS ARMSTRONG SIDNEY BECHET BIX BEIDERBECKE BESSIE SMITH THE PIONEERS • 9 by the classical composer Claude Debussy), the jig, and the rhythms imported to the United States from Africa during the period of slavery. In the 1890s ragtime developed particularly in the Midwest, around St. Louis and Sedalia, Missouri, and Indianapolis, although it soon became popular all over North America, from New York to Los Angeles to New Orleans. The African rhythms that developed in jazz drumming had survived from the Southern plantations. Other African musical traditions that became part of early jazz included field songs known as ring shouts, work songs, and the intensely moving harmonies incorporated into sung hymns or spirituals. In some parts of the South, white owners banned drumming, fearful that the sounds symbolized independence and might be used to signal insurrection. However, before emancipation, in public spaces as far apart as Manhattan and New Orleans, large numbers of slaves gathered on a regular basis to dance, sing, and drum. In many areas, such gatherings were progressively prohibited, even in New Orleans, where they were for many years restricted to the Place Congo, as it was called in the Creole French widely spoken in the city, or in English, Congo Square. Despite efforts to suppress these events, we have some idea of what they sounded like because the folksong collector and musicologist Henry E Gilbert jotted down many songs and dances, and in 1906 combined them into a thrilling orchestral piece called \"The Dance in Place Congo.\" This was just one of a number of works in which Gilbert recorded the sounds of African- Ameri- can and Native North American music at a stage when few other musicologists were seriously studying American folk music. The blues, a fusion of melancholy lyrics with plaintive melodies, developed across the South, although strangely it was not particularly well known in the Southern city where all the elements that went to make up jazz finally com- bined in the early years of the 20th century: New Orleans. During the previous half-century, New Orleans had become the most cul- turally mixed city in North America. There was a predominantly French influ- ence in its opera house and concert halls, with white and Creole (people with mixed African- American, French, and Spanish origins) society enjoying new productions of operas by Giacomo Meyerbeer, Hector Berlioz, and Charles- Francois Gounod within months of their opening in Paris. The benign climate also stimulated an outdoor life in which all forms of music were developed for parades, picnics, and other social gatherings. Ensembles of various sizes played for these events, and a strong tradition of string bands started up, with man- dolins, guitars, and violins performing everything from dances like mazurkas (a Polish folk dance) and polkas to the current ragtime favorites. The city's strong- ly established Masonic and other fraternal societies all employed bands for their functions, and to a young musician with talent, all kinds of doors were open, regardless of color. In New Orleans, as in many towns across the United States with large African- American populations, there was a tradition of marching brass bands. It was among the musicians who made up these marching bands that some of the first signs of jazz emerged, as they abandoned the formal written parts and in- stead improvised their own variations. Soon this developed into a custom that persists to this day for musical funerals, where a brass band plays mournful dirges on the way to the cemetery, then breaks into joyful improvised dances as it returns to the wake. The first legendary figures of New Orleans jazz played in brass bands with exotic names like the Excelsior, the Eureka, and the Imperial. 10 • JAZZ MAKERS Trumpeters Buddy Bolden, Manuel Perez, Peter Bocage, and King Oliver were all among the pioneers of this type of music. Bolden, with trombonist Frank Dusen, also led a band that played for outdoor society events at the city's Lincoln Park. Other groups, like that of John Robichaux , played a form of orchestral ragtime to similar audiences, and this style of gentle, slightly syncopated music was recorded in the 1920s by violinist and bandleader Armand J. Piron. Bolden's spontaneous variations on the popular number \"Carnival of Venice\" made him famous with local crowds, as did the scatological lyrics to the tunes he played for evening dances in or near the Story ville, the city's red-light dis- trict. In the many houses of entertainment in this area where prostitution was legal, there was a constant demand for music. Among the groups that played were < — - dren's \"spasm\" bands that performed with homemade instruments, (One of the best known, the Bouzan Kings, launched the careers of many famous jazz musicians.) The area was also renowned for sophisticated pianists like Tony Jackson, Dink Johnson and Jelly Roll Morton. As early as 1911, musicians playing what a listener today might recognize as a primitive form of jazz were leaving New Orleans to play as far afield as Chicago and the West Coast. The closing of Storyville in 1917 accelerated the spread of this new music by encouraging many more musicians to leave New Orleans to find work in Chicago and other large cities. However, well before Storyville was shut down, bands like the white groups led by Tom Brown and Johnny Stein had left New Orleans and had become popular in Chicago, where the music they played was called \"jass\" or \"jazz.\" The word was used to mean \"full of pep or excitement,\" but equally often as a euphemism for sex, consistent with the Storyville dives and dance halls where much of its development occurred. Stein's band soon became the Original Dixieland Jazz Band, making the first phonograph records of the new music in 1917, and traveling to New York City and then London in the years that followed. The discs contain a cheerful, angular style of music close to ragtime, but incorporating the kind of collective improvisation famil- iar from the musicians' New Orleans background. They can be said to have launched the Jazz Age. It is against this background that the first pioneers began to define jazz and the direction it would take in the future. In the 1920s, Chicago became the center for new developments in jazz, and then the spotlight moved to New York. This key peri- od in musical history was also the time when, from the passing of the 18th Amend- ment in January 1920, the manufacture, consumption, and sale of alcohol became illegal. There is little doubt that the thrill of illegal drinking in \"speakeasies\" — the forerunners of nightclubs — where jazz was played added to the music's mystique. In an atmosphere of intense excitement, and a social climate that encouraged the music, there were many innovations. Soloists began to use the jazz group as a jumping-off point for their own flights of creative improvisation. Composers and arrangers produced music to be played by increasingly large groups, giving birth to the first big bands, and in the middle of the decade, the invention of electrical recording made it possible to preserve for posterity a very accurate impression of the sounds these pioneers made. Scott Joplin KING OF RAGTIME 0 V ^ cott Joplin stands just outside the story of jazz ^^^^ itself, as the towering figure in ragtime, a style of . ^ music from an earlier era that was just one of the L m ingredients that went to make up jazz. Yet, with- r^^i^r out ragtime, early jazz would not have developed in the way that it did. Many early jazz tunes took their struc- ture, a sequence of melodic themes linked together by \"bridge\" passages, from the way ragtime numbers were writ- ten. Throughout the United States, the first jazz pianists, such as Jelly Roll Morton in New Orleans, Eubie Blake in Baltimore, and James P. Johnson in New York City, all wrote and played rags, gradually transforming them as time went by into freer, more improvised pieces, but never losing touch with the strutting rhythms and simple syncopation of ragtime. The first jazz bands played orchestrated versions of ragtime pieces, from adaptations of 12-bar blues, like \"The Dirty Dozens,\" to instrumental arrangements of JopluVs own rags from a famous collection known as the Red Back Book of Rags, In 1 907, when this frequently reproduced photograph was first published, Scott Joplin traveled to New York City to raise money for his second opera, Treemonisha. Joplin's first opera, A Guest of Honor, almost left him in financial ruin when someone in his company ran off with the box office receipts. 12 • JAZZ MAKERS None of this would have been pos- sible without the enormous contribu- tion of Joplin, a man who not only composed many of the most influential ragtime pieces, but encouraged many other musicians to play and compose in the style. He was ragtime's most accom- plished composer, one of its finest exponents at the piano, and also its most passionate advocate. He took rags into the genres of ballet and opera, and tried to enthuse audiences, promoters, and publishers alike, even when other types of music started to become more popular. He was also one of the last fig- ures in popular music to achieve his fame almost entirely through sales of sheet music rather than recordings. He did make some piano rolls — a forerun- ner of disc recording that involved a piano being played by a punched paper roll through which compressed air operated the keys. From these it is pos- sible to get an impression of how he might have sounded; but his own pub- lic knew him mainly from the string of compositions he issued through his publisher, John Stark. The life of Scott Joplin is a direct link between the era of slavery and the Jazz Age. He was born just three years after the Civil War ended, as his father, who had been born into slavery, was sharing the experience of thousands of other Southern African Americans of getting used to relative freedom despite the harsh economic conditions of Reconstruction, When Joplin died, the Original Dixieland Jazz Band had already made the first jazz records. The exact place of Scott Joplin's birth is unknown. The often-cited birth date of November 24, 1868, based on papers filed after his death by his widow, is now thought to be incorrect. Although, his age on various census reports confirms that he was born in 1868. His family traveled around the East Texas area, working in various small towns and villages as tenant farmers, eventually settling in Texarkana, a new town that had been set up as a trade center where two railroads intersected on the Texas- Arkansas border. Giles Joplin, Scott's father, became a railroad worker, and from 1873 until 1880 provided a de- cent living for his wife and five chil- dren until he left home. All the family were musical, Giles having played in a slave band, and Flo- rence (Scott's mother) being a banjoist and singer. Scott sang and played the banjo as well, but his real talent was for the piano. Although the family did not own one, he was taught to play by sev- eral helpful local teachers, including multi-instrumentalist J. C. Johnson and German-born Julius Weiss. During his teenage years, as he continued to develop as a pianist, he composed and sang for his own vocal group, the Texas Medley Quartette, with whom he began to travel throughout the area, perform- ing for local audiences. Living in the African- American community in Tex- arkana, and playing for the dances and social events of neighboring settle- ments, Joplin acquired a deep knowl- edge of folk song and dance traditions that he was later to absorb very effec- tively into many of his compositions. Both with his singing group and as a solo pianist, Joplin traveled increas- ingly farther afield, leaving home close to his 20th birthday and visiting Chicago, St. Louis, and Syracuse, New York, before settling around 1896 in the town of Sedalia, Missouri. During the five years he spent based there, Joplin published his first compositions, includ- ing a thrilling depiction of a railroad crash called \"Crush Collision March.\" He both studied music at a local college and taught the subject to others, includ- ing his fellow ragtime composers Scott Hayden and Arthur Marshall. Locally, he became famous playing at a club called the Maple Leaf, and in 1899 he immortalized both the club and himself with the publication of his \"Maple Leaf Rag.\" This piece, which JAZZ MAKERS Scott Joplin BORN 1868 East Texas DIED April 1, 1917 New York, New York EDUCATION No formal education as a child, but studied with local pianists in Texarkana; attended George R.

This one dates from 1 906. f>t/&L h KaTTtTwk nuaft^t* l>inrw»Mj STAR ANCt sold 500,000 copies by 1909, became the best-known ragtime composition, studied by pianists all over the United States. In its wake, Joplin published a number of other pieces, beginning with \"Original Rags\" (1899) and including his famous \"The Entertainer\" (1902). His publisher, John Stark, paid Joplin a royalty — an amount for every copy sold — which was an extremely fair and unusual arrangement at a time when most popular tunes were sold for a sin- gle cash payment. It cemented an agreement between the men that led Stark to continue to publish much of Joplin's work, and to bring out rags by other promising composers recom- mended to him by Joplin. The rags Joplin later wrote include stately, leisurely dances known as slow drags, other dances including waltzes, and novelty pieces that used Hispanic 14 • JAZZ MAKERS rhythms. He had an extraordinary abil- ity to represent events in music, as in \"The Cascades,\" which depicts an or- namental watercourse constructed for the St. Louis World's Fair in 1904- The fame brought to him by \"Maple Leaf Rag\" and his prowess as a pianist could have brought Joplin a comfortable life. However, having mas- tered writing in the ragtime form, he had greater ambitions. He became a driven man, writing ragtime ballets and operas, and then trying to raise the money and support to present them in public. He traveled widely as a soloist, billed as \"The King of Ragtime Com- posers,\" and with some of the money he earned he formed a succession of small companies to tour theaters and halls presenting his theatrical works. His ambitions — combined with the fact that many amateur musicians found his new pieces too hard to play, which re- duced sales of his music — eventually led to a falling out with John Stark, and what had been a steady stream of income dried up. One of his published rags, \"Rag- time Dance,\" is a cut-down version of a miniature ballet that he presented in 1899, and still retains the foot- taps (in- structions for the pianist to stomp when the dancers would have drummed their feet on the stage) and changes of tempo that were part of that ballet. After mov- ing to St. Louis in 1901, he formed an opera company and toured with his first ragtime opera, A Guest of Honor, which unfortunately no longer survives. Following a move to New York City in 1907, he became obsessed with com- posing and presenting his second full- length opera, Treemonisha. Completed in 191 1, it was performed only once in his lifetime. Devoid of sets, and with no money to pay an orchestra, he put it on in 1915 at the Lincoln Theater in Harlem, New York, directing it from the piano. By then he was already suf- fering from the terrifying last stages of syphilis, which he had contracted in his youth; he found himself no longer able to play in public as he lost control of his hands. Fellow ragtimer and com- poser Eubie Blake met him around 1915, and reported that Joplin's leg- endary skill had already deserted him. Shortly afterward he seemed to be los- ing the power of speech. Joplin had been married three times, and his third partner, Lottie Stokes, who was with him throughout the New York period, shared his busi- ness interests. Even she could not cope as Joplin slid into syphilis- induced madness. He died in a mental ward of Manhattan State Hospital. His legacy is remarkable. In addi- tion to Scott Hayden (who was Joplin's brother-in-law from his first marriage) and Arthur Marshall, Joplin helped the careers of many other pianists and composers, black and white, including Louis Chauvin and Joseph Lamb. The skill and range of his compositions in- spired other ragtime musicians all over the United States, including one of the first women composers of popular tunes, May Aufderheide, whose \"Dusty Rag\" of 1908 is a perennial favorite. Joplin's own music went through a remarkable renaissance from the 1970s onward, completing the process begun in the 1950s when a book called They Ail Played Ragtime was published, drawing attention to what had become \"The greatest ragtime writer who ever lived\" — Jelly Roll Morton SCOTT JOPLIN • 15 a largely forgotten genre. In 1970, clas- sical scholar and conductor Joshua Rifkin made two albums of Joplin's piano rags that became popular all over the world, and the following year most of Joplin's rags were republished. Soon afterward, the head of the New Eng- land Conservatory of Music, Gunther Schuller, made a phonograph record of Joplin's orchestrated rags from the Red Back Book, which led to the music being used in the 1973 movie The Sting. Pianist Marvin Hamlisch won a Grammy for .his playing of Joplin's music on the soundtrack. Finally, in 1972, after a decade of work by composer William Bolcom and orchestrater T. J. Anderson to recon- struct the complete score, a full produc- tion of Treemonisha was presented in Atlanta. There, and in a subsequent, revised, version on Broadway, it was hailed as a masterpiece. More than half a century after his death, Joplin's vision and persistence were finally rewarded. DISCOGRAPHY The Entertainer. Biograph BCD 101.

He was regarded as a colorful ■^^L loudmouthed character, but few who heard him bragging or saw his flashy clothes and the diamond in his teeth realized that there was more than a little truth in his claims. He may not have invented jazz, but he was its first great composer and one of its finest pianists. When a radio show suggested that W.

His old publishers Benjamin and John (\"Reb\") Spikes jointly composed the piece, and his new publishers Lester and Walter Melrose arranged with Gennett Records to get the piece recorded by the New Orleans Rhythm Kings, with whom Morton himself collaborated on an interracial record session in July of that same year.

They gave him a picturesque notion of his ancestry, naming him Ferdinand after the King of Spain. His mother, Louise Monette, and stepfather William Mouton (whose surname he adopted) were French-speaking. Jelly later changed his name to Morton \"for business reasons ... I didn't want to be called 'Frenchy'.\" His godmother practiced voodoo, and Morton held a lifelong belief that she had put a curse on him. His hometown left an indelible impression on Morton. There were street events, carnivals, parades, and dances. Above all, music was an every- day part of New Orleans life: light clas- sics, dances such as schottisches, a round dance like a slow polka; waltzes; and polkas, ragtime, and the plaintive 18 • JAZZ MAKERS sounds of blues singers. All these things came together in his piano playing, which combined a brilliant technique on his own test pieces like \"Finger- breaker,\" with a sense of grace, style, and hints of the Spanish rhythms of the Caribbean in Creole-flavored com- positions like \"Mamanita.\" In the red-light district of New Orleans, Storyville, where prostitution was still legal, the young Morton played piano in the \"sporting houses,\" or bor- dellos. The seamier side of life attracted htm, and as a teenager he became a pool shark and a pimp, once using his charm and dexterity to beat the leg- endary Pensacola Kid, the finest pool- shark in the South. Morton had a large diamond set in his front tooth, the sym- bol of a man who had made substantial immoral earnings. His nickname \"Jelly Roll\" is a sexual metaphor similar to the very word \"jazz\" or \"jass\" itself. He took to the road in 1907, play- ing music for touring shows, in bars or restaurants, and applying his pool- sharking and pimping skills. He was not subservient like many Southern African Americans of the time, and adopted a lifelong practice of referring to everyone, white or black, rich or poor, by their surnames. He never returned home, but treasured sentimen- tal memories of New Orleans. Before settling for a few years on the West Coast in 1917, he spent a short time in several cities: St Louis; Chicago; Memphis, Tennessee; and Mobile, Alabama. In each he outplayed all challengers at the piano. In Los Angeles, Morton moved in with a woman named Anita Johnson Gonzales, whom he probably met while walking through town. Morton would wear each of his suits in turn over the course of a few hours as he walked through town to give the impression that he was very wealthy. He briefly managed a dance hall there, and had a share in a gambling club next to a rooming house run by Anita. They made and lost a small fortune, and also briefly ran a club together in San Fran- cisco, which was closed by the authori- ties because black and white customers were allowed to mix. Jelly quit California after an argu- ment with his publisher. For years, he had been writing and publishing com- positions, but then his publishers, the Spikes Brothers, claimed some of Morton's songs as their own. Morton decided to move to the Melrose Pub- lishing Company in Chicago, whom he trusted, for his future pieces, and so he set off back to the Windy City to find work. In June 1923, Jelly's recording ca- reer began. Over the next couple of years he cut several band and solo discs for a variety of labels until he secured a lucrative contract with Victor in 1926 for his band, the Red Hot Peppers. As each disc appeared, Melrose published the sheet music, helping Morton make as much as possible on the deal. This was necessary, as the powerful Mafia, who took exception to Morton's small- time crimes such as pimping and pool- sharking, prevented him from leading a band in any Chicago dance halls or cabarets, and virtually all his work as a leader was in the recording studio or out of town. His musicians included several from New Orleans: the Dodds brothers, Johnny St. Cyr, Kid Ory, John Lindsay, and Omer Simeon. \"My theory is never to discard the melody,\" he wrote, and his pieces embellished the many melodies produced by his fertile imagi- nation. His skill in creating miniature Ferdinand \"Jelly Rolf Morton BORN October 20, 1890 New Orleans, Louisiana DIED July 10, 1941 Los Angeles, California EDUCATION Left school between fourth and eighth grades; piano lessons from Professor Nickerson, and an unknown teacher at St. Joseph's University, New Orleans; acquired more expertise in music from fellow musicians in the Storyville district MAJOR INTERESTS Piano, composing, bandleading ACCOMPLISHMENTS The first significant composer in jazz; produced piano pieces that bridged the gap from ragtime to jazz; wrote and arranged for bands, creat- ing the first recordings in jazz in which the arrangements were tai- lored expertly to the playing time of 78 rpm discs.

The rhythms in his music were very much like the rhythms of the Caribbean islands . \" — Bud Freeman, saxophonist, in Crazeology (1989) set-pieces for the brief running time of a 78 rpm record (about three minutes) brought him critical acclaim as the first great composer in jazz. These record- ings used music to tell a story, such as the funeral march in \"Dead Man Blues\" or the bustling harbors ide activity of \"Steamboat Stomp.\" Jelly moved to New York in 1928, an astute move given the city's growing prominence as the center of the record and publishing business, but a disas- trous one for Morton's career as a band- leader. Instead of being able to pick his bands from fellow Louisiana-born musi- cians as he had done in Chicago, he was forced to put together groups of New York players who were indifferent to his ideas and who lacked his instinc- tive understanding of the New Orleans style. Morton produced some exciting records with a big band in the late 1 920s, and a few genuinely inspired sides, such as \"Kansas City Stomps,\" with a New Orleans lineup, but by the end of the 1920s his career had begun to decline. This coincided with the Great Depression, and although Morton con- tinued to play occasional well-paid jobs, he could not keep a regular band working and had to return to playing solo or in other people's bands. Gradu- ally Morton slid into the role of a has-been, berating all who would listen with the many reasons for his woes. Afraid that his godmother's curse was taking effect, he spent much money trying to get the voodoo hex lifted. When Benny Goodman and Bob Crosby made best-selling discs of his tunes, Jelly failed to restart his career, and Victor let his recording contract lapse. Until his last great burst of recording activity, in 1938—40, Morton spent almost no time in the studio in the 1930s. Around 1936 he moved to Wash- ington, D.C., to play in a club. It was up two flights of stairs in a none-too- good neighborhood, and visitors recall Morton letting them in with a large bunch of keys, pointing out his home- made \"jungle\" decor, and demanding a cover charge for entertainment that would be presented. \"What entertainment?\" they would ask. \"I'm the entertainment,\" he would say as he pocketed their dollars. It was from this seedy club in 1938 that researcher Alan Lomax invited him to the Library of Congress to record his life story. The Library of Congress discs — a rough-and-tumble musical account of his life and times — marked a watershed in Morton's career. His wife, Mabel (nee Bertrand), whom he had married 10 years earlier, urged him to give up the club and return to New York City. At the end of 1938 he did so, once more making some records and taking part in radio shows that were fueled by his controversial press attacks on W. C. Handy. This was Morton's final flower- ing. If he had survived just a few years longer he might have joined in the re- vival of interest in New Orleans jazz alongside contemporaries like Bunk Johnson and Sidney Bechet. Instead, he failed to make any impression on the jazz tastes of the day, and his return to the spotlight was short-lived. Discouraged, Morton set off for California in late 1940, partly because he hoped to recapture the magical days of the early 1920s. He even teamed up with Anita again, having left Mabel in New York, where he had been forced to live on welfare. From the West, Morton kept up a stream of letters to Mabel. Things were always just about to look up, even though he could not disguise the fact that he was poor and unwell from her; but in his other letters to friends he was more honest, and told the heartrending story of his final decline. He died in a hospital, with Anita by his bed. She benefited from a suspiciously recent will in which he left her virtually everything, ignoring his wife entirely and leaving only a small royalty income to his sister. His deathbed poverty was ironic, as Morton's songs have seldom been out of print since then, and hundreds more recordings have been made of his com- positions during the last half-century. In his lifetime, the only person consis- tently sure of his worth was Jelly him- self. Now he is recognized by the world at large as the prolific composer, bril- liant arranger, and sensational band- leader he always knew himself to be.

King Oliver THE RAZZIEST, JAZZIEST BAND YOU EVER HEARD A V s jazz was emerging in New Orleans as a V 1 distinct musical style between 1900 and ^v^^A 1920, its first heroes were the showy trunv / peters and cornetists who led the city's JLi bands. The original \"king\" of the cornet was Buddy Bolden, whose career was cut short by his alarm- ing decline into insanity and hospitalization. The next \"king\" was Joe Oliver, who eventually took the new sounds of jazz to California, to Chicago, and, through pioneer recordings, to the world. King Oliver's life is a classic tale of triumph and tragedy. He scaled the heights of popularity, but then fell into hard times as the very musicians he had made famous outstripped him. In early 1920s Chicago, his Creole Jazz Band was the most influential of all black jazz bands, and it launched the career of Louis Armstrong. Later, he formed one of the first big bands in Chicago. His musicians included the most famous names in jazz: clarinetists Barney Bigard, Albert Nicholas, Omer Simeon, and Johnny Dodds; trumpeter Henry Allen; trombonist Kid Ory; banjoists Bud Scott and Johnny St. Cyr; and drummers Paul Barbarin and Baby Dodds. Yet all these men found fame and fortune with leaders other than Oliver, who bravely struggled on into the Great Depression years leading groups of ever more obscure musicians far from the center of musical life. Wi I L King Oliver's band visit Comiskey Park, Chicago, in 1919. Clearly visible in the bleachers are (from left to right) drummer \"Ram\" Hall, Honore Dutrey, trombone; Oliver (in flat cap, holding cornet); and Lawrence Duhe, clarinet 22 • JAZZ MAKERS Joe Oliver's musical development dovetailed exactly with the emergence of jazz* The marching bands of his hometown started to turn their parade music for funerals and civic events into a swinging, partly improvised music that owed less and less to the conven- tional marches of John Philip Sousa and Arthur Pryor, the leading march composers and bandleaders in the United States at the time. In his teens and early 20s Oliver was a powerful player in these street parades, already able to outblow other players like Manuel Perez and Kid Rena. Oliver had gained experience in a youth band led by Walter Kinchin. He injured his left eye, leaving it protruding and the butt of nicknames for the rest of his life, when Kinchin's band was involved in a fight in Baton Rouge. \"Bad Eye\" Joe Oliver was a tough customer from early on, and later held his own in rough company by packing a pistol, which he even used to ensure that his band rehearsed diligently. Oliver played with many of the legends of early jazz, including Sidney Bechet, Frankie Dusen, and Lorenzo Tio, but quickly assumed the honorary title \"King\" amid stiff competition from other players. Guitarist and raconteur Danny Barker, a child at the time, recalls watching parades go by: \"I saw how the crowd gathered closely, listen- ing happily, tingling all over.\" Oliver and his band were, remembers Barker, \"like gods or saints.\" So, when the red- light district of Storyville closed and work temporarily became scarcer in New Orleans, Oliver was among the first to leave, opening at the Royal Gardens in Chicago early in 1918. Jazz had been introduced to Chi- cago by Freddie Keppard, another New Orleans cornetist, as early as 1911, but as World War I drew to a close, the city welcomed the new music in a big way. The Jazz Age had begun. For three years, Oliver worked steadily, often at two venues a night, becoming famous as one of the best cornetists in Chi- cago. Despite his success, Oliver tem- porarily left Chicago to venture to California in 1921-22. After a year in the West, which included work with Jelly Roll Morton in San Francisco, Oliver returned to Chicago. At the Royal Gardens, now renamed the Lincoln Gardens, after the former president, he began his most famous period as a bandleader. In July 1922, he summoned Louis Armstrong to join him on second cornet, a move that created the most influential band in early jazz. The general public flocked to hear them, with Johnny Dodds on clarinet, Honore Dutrey on trombone, Baby Dodds on drums, Lil Hardin on piano, and Bill Johnson doubling on banjo and double bass, but their biggest impact was on other musicians. White and black, young and old, players — including those who later gave their names to the style called \"Chicago jazz\" like Jimmy McPartland, Bud Freeman, Art Hodes, Eddie Condon, and Dave Tough— gathered to hear the sensa- tional interplay between the magisterial Oliver and the young and brilliant Arm- strong. The two took unison \"breaks\" in which the rest of the musicians dropped out, leaving the cornetists play- ing alone. The breaks were second na- ture to both men after working in New Orleans parade bands, but they thrilled the Chicago crowds, who had never heard this exciting style before. When the band made its first discs in April 1923, it caused a sensation, and other jazz musicians wore out the recordings learning the parts note for note. \"The razziest, jazziest band you ever heard!\" claimed the Chicago Defender newspaper. Yet, by the end of the year, the original lineup was separating. Early in 1924 Louis Armstrong and Lil Hardin were married, and soon Louis left for New York City to star with Fletcher Henderson's band. Oliver began his policy of recruiting brilliant JAZZ MAKERS Joseph \"King\" Oliver BORN May 11, 1885 New Orleans, Louisiana DIED April 10, 1938 Savannah, Georgia EDUCATION Learned music in Walter Kinchin's brass band of young players around 1900; later studied with Bunk John- son and joined various New Orleans bands in which he perfected his cor- net technique: Onward Brass Band, Henry Allen Sr.'s Brass Band, Origi- nal Superior Orchestra, Eagle Band, Magnolia Band MAJOR INTERESTS Cornet, later trumpet; bandleading; composing ACCOMPLISHMENTS Led the most influential band in Chicago for much of the 1920s; launched the careers of many great jazz musicians, including Louis Armstrong; was a key developer of the art of playing muted trumpet solos.

When he noted all were present, he'd set the gun down on the table and start rehearsing. \" — Freddie Moore, drummer, in Voices of the Jazz Age (1989) replacements, and after briefly hiring a trumpeter named Bob Shoffner, Oliver sent to New Orleans for the young Lee Collins- With butterflies in his stom- ach, Lee took a solo on \"Panama Rag.\" The club's bouncer, Roy Williams, came up to the stand. \"Joe,\" he told Oliver, \"that's the first time I've seen you smile since your boy Louis left the band!\" i I— C f \\ i ^ Even Collins's electrifying presence could not recreate the popularity Oliv- er had enjoyed with Louis Armstrong. So Oliver broke up the band and went to New York City to make some records. On his return, billed as \"The World's Greatest Jazz Cornetist\" at the Plantation Cafe, he doubled with his own band at the Lincoln Gardens*, but that venue caught fire, and Oliver went into 1925 with no regular band and his library of parts completely burned up. Like a phoenix from the ashes of the Lincoln Gardens, Oliver changed direction and founded a big band: the Dixie Syncopators. His new group landed the job at the Plantation, and helped to define how jazz could be played by larger ensembles: two trum- pets, trombone, and three saxophones, plus rhythm. Local reviewers hailed their \"loud, wailing and pulsating\" jazz. During this period, Oliver developed his \"talking trumpet\" technique, using mutes to create a whole range of effects, a piece of showmanship that marked his band out from those of other leaders. After several successful years, Oliv- er left Chicago in May 1927. New York City was becoming the new center for jazz, and Oliver moved there along with many other Chicago bandleaders, including Jelly Roll Morton. Until his last record date in 1931, he managed to put together excellent recording bands, even if his day-to-day group was less distinguished. Then Oliver's health degenerated, with the worst possible affliction for a trumpeter: chronic gum disease. Playing cornet for long periods caused havoc to his already-weakened teeth, which wobbled back in his mouth, making it impossible to play, and made blood gush from his gums. From mid- 1931 he was forced to take his band out on the road to sur- vive. They traveled to Wichita, Kansas; Fort Worth, Texas; and Kansas City, Missouri, trading on Oliver's rep- utation, and often playing for white audiences. As the years went by, the band rode in an ever-less-reliable suc- cession of buses, old cars, and jalopies, and the better musicians quit. Oliver began to miss dates because of his transport, or because he would not accept bookings that he considered beneath his status as \"King.\" On one occasion his band had to burn the tires of their broken-down bus to keep warm as they camped at the roadside through a long, cold night. By 1936, Oliver settled in Savan- nah, Georgia, his last veteran bus parked forever in a dusty side street. He did various menial jobs, eventually becoming the janitor of a pool hall. 24 • JAZZ MAKERS He had always been a more than com- petent pool player, and in his great New York years had been a regular at the tables, alongside Jelly Roll Morton and Fletcher Henderson. Now he was reduced to sweeping and cleaning, with only the odd game thrown in to recall the great times. His former associ- ates sought him out when they came through on tour. Louis Armstrong is said to have given him a $100 bill — a fortune in the deprived South of the time — and the singer Miss Rhapsody recalls going back to his lodgings where his only souvenir of the great years was a collection of 15 trumpets. He died of a cerebral hemorrhage in his lodgings one night after sweeping out the pool hall. The cover for the published edition of Olivers \"Sugar Foot Stomp\" (also known as \"Dippermouth Blues\") features his most famous band.

He was born in poverty in New Orleans, yet went on to become the music's most influ- ential soloist and singer. His inspired trumpet playing is instantly recognizable in the hun- dreds of recordings he made from 1923 until his death in 1971, and his singing voice, which ranged from the high tenor of his youth to the gravelly sounds of his later years, spawned a host of imitators. Louis was bom on the borders of Storyville while it was still an active red-light area, and he was only six years old when its leading pianist, Jelly Roll Morton, left town. Amid the bordellos, the young Louis toured the streets on a cart, selling rags and bones or buckets of coal. On these rounds, he heard through open windows the music that was played for the patrons as it was developing from what we might rec- ognize today as ragtime to something much closer to jazz. In the band of the Home for Colored Waifs, where he was sent after firing a gun in the street on New Year's Day 1913, he learned to play the cornet, and his career began while he was little more than 12 years old. Like almost all aspiring New Orleans cornetists, Arm- strong played in marching bands for parades and funerals. In his late teens he also played in a dance band on the river- boat steamers that went between New Orleans and St. Louis. The leader of the riverboat band was Fate Marable, who had a strong impact on Armstrong's career, helping him begin to learn how to read music. But from the earliest days, Arm- strong's mentor was King Oliver, and when Oliver started his new career in Chicago after Storyville was closed down, it was not long before the young Louis traveled north to join Oliver's Creole Jazz Band. A group of young Chicago musicians, white and black, like saxophonist Bud Freeman, idolized the band and crowded in to hear it at the Lincoln Gardens. \"When they played,\" Freeman wrote, \"each chorus seemed to swing more than the previous one until every bit of tension seemed to leave your body.\" Soon, Louis was more famous than his boss. His fame grew after he married the band's pianist, Lil Hardin, in 1924, and moved to New York City to join Fletcher Henderson's band, then the best-known black big band in the United States, His time with Henderson was a mixed success, for the suave and sophisticated New Yorkers found him a rough country boy. But his playing won them over, and so did his disarming humor. When he played his very loudest during a passage marked \"pp\" (for pianissimo, meaning \"very soft\") Armstrong laughed heartily at his mistake, confessing he 26 • JAZZ MAKERS Louis Armstrong (left) and cornetist Bobby Hackett play at a jam session arranged to introduce jazz to the elemen- tary grades at Waft Whitman School in New York City. Trombonist Brad Gowans and guitarist Eddie Condon are in the background. thought it meant \"pound plenty\"! He cut some important discs with Henderson, and also with some of the great blues singers of the time whom Henderson's band accompanied, including Bessie Smith. A year later Armstrong was back in Chicago, where he began to lead his own small groups, the Hot Five and Hot Seven, in record studios. Lil Hardin was the pianist on many of these sessions, although she and Louis did not remain married for long, and he was subsequently married twice more. His bands made a series of remarkable discs that include many of the best jazz cornet solos he recorded. Through these, in the space of a few years, he altered the whole course of jazz history by abandoning the idea of group or col- lective improvisation around a theme. He replaced that approach with a sin- gle instrumentalist playing extended solos between choruses by the group, to display both inventive musical ideas and technical prowess. His \"West End Blues\" and other tracks like \"Hotter than That\" and \"Potato Head Blues\" became jazz classics. The wordless vo- cals he invented when he accidentally dropped the words to \"Heebie Jeebies\" during a recording session gave the world an early example of a new sound known as \"scat\" singing. During the years he led these influential recording bands, he changed from playing comet to the more incisive trumpet. Louis worked a full schedule, play- ing with several of Chicago's leading bands like those of Erskine Tate and Carroll Dickerson. Often, as King Oliv- er had done before him, he appeared at two different venues on the same day, setting up a relentless workload that he kept up for almost the rest of his career. In 1929, having moved to New York, he made his first discs with a Panamanian pianist named Luis Rus- sell, whose big band backed Louis from 1935 through the mid- 1940s, except when Louis made tours to Europe or to the West Coast. This band became known as Louis Armstrong and His Orchestra (although they made many excellent discs without Armstrong under Russell's name, with Henry LOUIS ARMSTRONG • 27 \"Louis Armstrong was so tough on trumpet that nobody dared challenge him. He didnt come to us, we had to go to him.\" — Rex Stewart, cornetist, in his posthumously published autobiography, Boy Meets Horn (1991) \"Red\" Allen taking the trumpet parts). Throughout the late 1930s, Armstrong and Russell turned out a series of first- rate recordings in which Louis' majestic trumpet glides over the sound of the big band on the popular songs of the day, and with the vocal sections inter- preted in Armstrong's characteristic voice. His singing earned him the nick- name \"Satchelmouth\" or \"Satch,\" and later, when he began an impressive round of world travels, he became known as \"Ambassador Satch.\" His near contemporary, guitarist Danny Barker, not only remembers Armstrong playing higher, faster, and better than anyone in New York's many jam ses- sions, but also how other trumpeters in town even tried to catch colds so that their singing would sound like Louis' throaty voice. By the late 1940s, very few big band leaders could afford to keep going, as the cost of taking a 14-piece band on the road spiraled rapidly. In a 1946 film called New Orleans, in which Billie Holiday also appeared, Louis had played in a seven-piece band with a group of fellow New Orleans veterans. It was so popular that the following year he formed his own small group called the All Stars, which opened at Billy Berg's club in Hollywood in late 1947, and the year after traveled to Europe for the Nice Jazz Festival in France. With such sidemen as pianist Earl Hines, trombonist Jack Teagarden, and clarinetist Barney Bigard, Louis' band lived up to its name; he contin- ued to lead this group until his death. The All Stars marked a return for Louis to the Dixieland style of jazz he had heard in his youth. In middle age, his trumpet playing was more economi- cal than the rapid flurries of the 1920s, and he sang more. But all over the world new audiences discovered jazz from Louis' golden, burnished tone on the trumpet and his ever-swinging vocals on popular classics like \"Hello, Dolly!\" \"Mack the Knife,\" and \"Won- derful World,\" with which he was still achieving recording-chart success in his late sixties. In the late 1960s Armstrong had serious heart problems, but he returned to playing, appearing with his All Stars at the Waldorf Astoria in New York only shortly before his death. He was mourned by millions as the most popu- lar entertainer in jazz. Dizzy Gillespie wrote: \"Every trumpeter in the world had to be influenced by him. He changed the modus operandi of music by inventing the solo.\" DISCOGRAPHY The Hot Fives, Vol. I. Columbia 460821-2. [The earliest Hot Five discs, 1925-26.] The Hot Fives and Sevens, Vol. II.

L m The Swiss conductor Ernest Ansermet described r^^^r him in 1919 as \"an artist of genius.\" Alongside Louis Armstrong, he was the most significant soloist in early jazz. However, because he spent many years in Europe, and also because of his famously volatile temperament, Bechet's genius was not properly recognized in the United States until the 1940s, when interest in \"traditional\" jazz was revived by record collectors and enthusiasts. By then, Bechet was about to move to France, where he spent his final years as a national celebrity. Like Morton, Oliver, and Armstrong, Bechet belonged to the generation of New Orleans musicians who grew up alongside jazz. Even when Storyville closed in 1917, there were still plenty of opportunities for young players to appear at picnics, rallies, weddings, funerals, and the \"ballyhoos\" that advertised medicine shows and circuses. The tubby, pugnacious Sidney Bechet became a celeb- rity during his teens. \"At around twelve years of age, Sidney got himself a cheap tin flute,\" remembered one contemporary. \"He became a virtuoso, a wizard on that tin flute.\" Bechet's 7 Sidney Bechet (left) with cornetist Rex Stewart in the RCA Vic- tor studios in Chicago, September 6, 1940. Bechet's forceful playing style often made life difficult for the brass players who accompanied him, but Stewart was a sympathetic and successful frontline partner 30 • JAZZ MAKERS lifelong nickname, the \"Wizard of Jazz,\" stems from those years, with his magi- cal ability on a 10-cent toy. He trans- ferred this mastery to the clarinet, and liked to turn up to hear local bands, concealing his instrument in separate pieces in his pockets. Then, he would assemble the clarinet as he came on stage and blow everyone away with his powerful solos. He also briefly played the cornet in some of New Orleans' many marching bands. In his entire life, Bechet took only a few lessons. He hated the written exercises given to him by his teacher, \"Big Eye\" Louis Nelson, and preferred to play truant from school to practice the clarinet alone. By his 20th birthday, Sidney had played with all the best- known bandleaders in New Orleans. However, in common with many of them, he decided to travel north to Chicago to work. One reason was that although there were plentiful opportu- nities in New Orleans, they paid no better than other occupations, whereas in 1920s Chicago jazz musicians were relatively well paid. For example, trum- peter Doc Cheatham received $85 in one night when he sat in for Louis Armstrong at a Chicago club — the equivalent of several weeks' salary in most bands in New Orleans. In Chicago, Bechet worked with both King Oliver and Freddie Keppard. His fame spread rapidly, as did his repu- tation for getting into fights and argu- ments. There was a notable spat with Oliver, and an even more serious argu- ment that blew up when another mem- ber of Keppard's band was paid more than Bechet. Bechet could have stayed and made his reputation in Chicago. Instead, he accepted Will Marion Cook's invita- tion to travel to Europe with a large orchestra, along with a wealth of black musicians, dancers, and singers. They set off for London in 1919, and Bechet's decision to travel altered the direction of his life permanently. In London there was a warm reception for Cook's orchestra when it opened in July 1919. After working with Cook for some time, Bechet moved to a small group, then to a series of other bands until he was deported following a fight in his lodgings. Despite the untimely end of this first European trip, it achieved three things. First, Bechet was singled out for praise by the critics. Second, after buying a soprano saxophone in a London music shop, Bechet increasingly used it in preference to the clarinet. Third, he developed a taste for Europe, where he felt his talents were better appreciated than in the United States. Back in New York City after his rapid ejection from Britain, Bechet cut a sequence of first-rate discs, some with pianist Clarence Williams and Louis Armstrong. It looked for a while as if, like Armstrong, he would become a star in his own country. Instead, in 1925, he returned to Europe, with singer and dancer Josephine Baker in a show called La Revue Negre. Bechet enjoyed a brief romance with Baker, displaying a penchant for attractive and dynamic women that later led him into other such liaisons, including one with the actress Tallulah Bankhead. Until late 1930, Bechet was loosely based in Paris but traveled widely in Europe, until a hot-tempered shooting incident landed him in jail in 1928-29, whereupon he moved to Berlin. He wandered all over Europe, as far as Russia. With his Creole background, Bechet loved the European cafe life and his music brought him plenty of ac- claim. Yet his absence from the United States at the time when jazz was devel- oping rapidly meant that the music moved on without him. He was never fully able to capture the ground he lost. In Noble Sissle's big band, with whom he made some recordings, Bechet again traveled to Europe in 1931, and re- mained in the band when it returned to the United States. \"To tell a story, to grab the listeners attention, to carry him away on a continuously rising curve of excitement . . . was Bechet's musical credo.\" Bob Wilber in Music Was Not Enough (1987) SIDNEY BECHET • 31 In this poster for Jean Josipovici's 1955 film Llnspecteur connait la musique, Bechet is more prominently featured than the lead- ing actors — illustrating his celebrity status in France at the time. He appears with Claude Luther's band in several scenes of this melodramatic movie. Bechet's natural style was to play solo, so he was not really happy in a big band. After leaving Sissle in 1931, he and New Orleans trumpeter Tommy Ladnier formed the New Orleans Feetwarmers to play an energetic brand of Dixieland jazz. For a while they worked in and around New York City. It was still hard to get work during the Great Depression, and the band, which audiences thought old-fashioned, soon folded. The co-leaders went into busi- ness running a laundry, where Sidney rekindled a youthful interest in tailor- ing, and also cooked generously for friends in the back room — no doubt adding an odor of Creole spices to the clothes that he cleaned and pressed! The laundry, like the band, failed, and Bechet rejoined Sissle to make ends meet. In the late 1930s he was reunited with Ladnier when French critic Hugues Panassie recorded a band play- ing in the old style. Partly because of Panassie's discs, a revival of interest in New Orleans jazz began, which opened up a new role for Bechet. Already gray and elderly- looking, he now assumed the role of senior statesman of jazz. He made a commercial success of playing the very material that had seemed so unfashionable at the start of the 1930s. From 1938 until mid- 1942, when the American Federation of Musicians imposed a ban on recording, Bechet made enough discs to confirm his genius and initiate the New Orleans revival all over the world. On a disc of \"China Boy,\" made in 1940 with cometist Muggsy Spanier, Bechet played one of his most elaborate recorded choruses. His pupil, clarinetist Bob Wilber, believes that this exempli- fies a routine that Bechet composed and diligently rehearsed. In a jam session, after endless improvisation, Bechet could go into such prearranged material and be sure of outplaying everyone else. There was nobody to compete with, however, when he cut two remarkable sides in which he played all the instru- ments of the band himself. Although record collectors and jazz fans began to appreciate Bechet's skill, 32 • JAZZ MAKERS JAZZ MAKERS for most of the 1940s he worked in rel- atively obscure circumstances. He was still waiting for his talents to be recog- nized and rewarded as befitted a player of his experience and stature. This finally happened as a consequence of an invitation from the French critic and discographer Charles Delauney to visit Paris in 1949 for a concert. In due course, after a triumphal return to Paris and an equally successful flying visit to London, Bechet settled in Europe. He returned a few more times to the United States, but from 1950 his home was in France, and he married an old flame, Elisabeth Zeigler, whom he had gotten to know in his earlier European days. In the last decade of his life Bechet was finally recognized as the genius he was. With Claude Luter's band he made a series of potent records that defined a new style of traditional jazz, and he became a national hero in France, his legend fueled by the fact that he publicly shared his attentions between his wife and a mistress. His music blared out from speakers in cafes, and he made appearances on television, notably during a return trip to England, when he appeared on the cult TV show 6.5 Special. His celebrity status was such that it seemed not in the least incongruous that a white- haired jazzman in his 60s should share the stage with young pop groups. In the very late 1950s, Bechet suc- cumbed to lung cancer and went into a slow but inexorable decline. His talent refused to become dormant, even with the onset of his fatal disease. In a con- cert in Paris in late 1958, he summoned up all his wizardry to produce one of his very finest shows, even though he was by then desperately ill. Bechet died in Paris on his 62nd birthday.

In his tragically short 28-year life, he be- came the first white jazz musician to alter the course of the music and indelibly stamp his personality on a whole school of players. Whereas Louis Armstrong and Sidney Bechet played with an assertive dominance, Beiderbecke's incurably romantic approach filtered his childhood memories into a beautiful and reflective style. It combined the sounds of clas- sical concerts with those of riverboat jazz bands, half-heard across the water as they rounded the great bend in the Mississippi River near his home town of Davenport, Iowa. Bix was bom into the second generation of a German immigrant family in the settlement founded in the Midwest territory that would become Iowa by Colonel George Davenport in the first half of the 19th century. His family was prosperous and middle class, and they continued many Bix Beiderbecke in 1928 was a star soloist in Paul Whiteman's band.Whiteman played with the San Francisco Symphony Orchestra until he resigned in 1916, after hearing jazz music for the first time in a bar in the so-called Barbary Coast district of San Francisco. 34 • JAZZ MAKERS \"There was an ethereal beauty of Bix's tone, with its heart-rrielting blend of pure joyousness and wistful haunting sadness \" -Max Kaminsky, trumpeter, in My Life in Jazz (1963) of the European musical and cultural traditions from their German heritage. Young Bix did not prosper in formal music lessons, but his quick ear and instinctive talent for music meant that he could pick out tunes on the piano with ease. At age 12 he had already made his mark playing the steam organ, or calliope, atop one of the town's river excursion boats. When a similar boat arrived in town from New Orleans, bringing with it Fate Marable's band starring Louis Armstrong on cornet, Bix had his first exposure to jazz. Around the same time, Bix's elder brother Charles returned from Europe at the end of World War I, where he had found himself fighting against his grandfather's countrymen. He brought back to the family home a disc of the Original Dixieland Jazz Band playing \"Tiger Rag.\" Bix, who had already shown a penchant for playing the cor- net, was entranced, and soon began practicing the sounds of jazz on piano and cornet alike during every spare moment. He sat in with various local bands, also getting occasional jobs play- ing on riverboats, but his inability to read music fluently prevented him from getting his musicians' union card, without which he could not play cor- net professionally. His family did not approve of Bix's interest in jazz, especially as he showed no aptitude for formal educa- tion. Their final attempt to drum some schooling into him at Lake Forest Mili- tary Academy ended in disaster when he was expelled in May 1922. Instead of returning home, the 19-year-old headed for Chicago, about 35 miles from Lake Forest, where he had been making unofficial visits to hear and play jazz. He had already met some of the friends and musicians who would be part of his circle in the coming years, including tuba player Min Leibrook and pianist, vocalist, and songwriter Hoagy Carmichael, His father made attempts to haul Bix back to Davenport, but these were short-lived, and he began his musical career with various bands in and around Chicago, as well as playing on various pleasure boats on the lakes. During one visit to Davenport, how- ever, Bix finally got his union member- ship by taking the audition on piano; he breezed through by memorizing a couple of light classics. On a visit to New York, Bix met and learned from Nick La Rocca, the cornetist with the Original Dixieland Jazz Band, whose discs he had so much admired as a youth. In late 1923 he joined a band of Chicagoans in Cincin- nati called the Wolverines, with whom he cut his own first discs in February 1924. In the following weeks, the band stayed on the Indiana University cam- pus, where Bix and Hoagy Carmichael spent time together, culminating in Carmichael's \"Riverboat Shuffle\" being recorded by the band in May. Later the same year Beiderbecke spent a short time in the big band led by Jean Goldkette, to whom he returned in 1926 to make some of his finest discs. In the interim, Bix teamed up with Frankie Trumbauer, a talented saxophonist who played the cumber- some C-melody instrument with a grace and lightness that matched Bix's JAZZ MAKERS Leon Bix Beiderbecke BORN March 10, 1903 Davenport, Iowa DIED August 6, 1931 Queens, New York EDUCATION Lake Forest Military Academy, Illi- nois; expelled in 1922 before gradu- ating; played in several school bands MAJOR INTERESTS Cornet, piano ACCOMPLISHMENTS One of the most original of all early jazz soloists, featured in bands of Jean Goldkette, Frankie Trumbauer, Paul Whiteman; later, led his own recording groups; published compo- sitions are \"In A Mist,\" \"Flashes,\" \"Candlelights,\" \"In the Dark\" MUSEUMS & ARCHIVES Beiderbecke collections held at the New Orleans Jazz Museum and the Putnam Museum of History and Natural Science in Davenport, Iowa BIX BEIDERBECKE • 35 The Wolverines playing at Doyle's Dancing Academy Cincinnati, 1 924.

Together, Bix and \"Tram,\" as he was nicknamed, played for several months in St Louis before rejoining Goldkette together Playing arrangements by Bill Challis, the new, light, swinging style of Beiderbecke and Trumbauer matured, and in a sequence of discs cut under Trumbauer's name in early 1927, they captured the very best of their collaboration on tunes like \"I'm Coming Virginia\" and \"Singin 1 the Blues.\" Even during his most creative peri- od with Goldkette and Trumbauer, Bei- derbecke had demonstrated a weakness for alcohol. He had once been fit and athletic, playing football and baseball at Lake Forest, but his lifestyle took its toll, and there were signs that he could not maintain the pace at which he chose to live. Until late 1927, how- ever, Bix largely managed to keep his drinking in hand, and to play well on every occasion. It was after joining the big band led by Paul Whiteman, the \"King of Jazz,\" in which Bix and Trumbauer became just two of a galaxy of featured soloists, that Beiderbecke's health began to break down. Although he may have found the band's cumbersome arrangements and elaborate routines tedious, he gave every impression of enjoying being a part of Whiteman's well-paid and starry ensemble, taking a fair number of features in their stage shows and recordings. What caused the problems was that he tried to fit in his old lifestyle of after-hours jam sessions, freelance recordings, and bouts of drinking alongside the punishing work schedule of Whiteman's band. He collapsed with pneumonia in late 1928, and barely recovered before his health gave way again. To his cred- it, Paul Whiteman was benevolent toward his musicians. He kept Bix on his payroll during several of the months he was unable to play — a period that was lengthened when Bix was attacked and hurt in a brawl. His last recording date for Whiteman in September 1929 was unfinished, and apart from a few isolated visits to the studios with pick- up bands, he passed the last years of his life in an alcoholic haze, unable to rekindle his zest for life or playing. With the help of his close friend, arranger Bill Challis, Bix managed to eke out a living from occasional free- lance playing dates when he was well enough, but many of these passed in a blur of oblivion. Challis persevered in writing out several of Beiderbecke's piano pieces to preserve them for pos- terity, but he was unable to help his friend back to the limelight, or to health. In a lonely hotel room in Queens, New York, Bix finally died of alcohol-induced pneumonia at the very time that the first jazzman he had heard on the riverboats at Davenport, Louis Armstrong, his only serious rival, was becoming an international star.

Her robust singing voice and her forceful, heartfelt interpretations of the blues can be heard on the 159 records she made during her short life. But it is from her riveting, charismatic presence on film that it is possible to understand something of the vaudeville and theater world she inhabited for most of her life. On screen, she acts as well as sings, but she packs more emotional power into the title song, her one vocal number, than in the lightweight acting role of a wronged wife that surrounds it. The film captures forever something of the essence of her stage presence and unmistakably com- municates the aura of a star. The world of the touring stage show offered an escape from the grinding poverty of the South for many performers such as Bessie, who was born one of seven children in her family's cabin near Chattanooga, Tennessee. In the compa- nies that crisscrossed the United States, playing in a chain of theaters operated by an organization called TOBA (the Bessie Smith in 1 925 with her fashionably bobbed wig and feather boa had earned the title Empress of the Blues. Her re- ported income of $2,000 a week made her the most successful African-American performer of the time. BESSIE SMITH • 37 Afthough Bessie Smith's acting and singing in her 1 925 movie, St. Louis 8/ues, is digni- fied and moving, the same could not be said of the film's publicity posters, which used crude racial stereotyping to promote the picture. Theater Owners' Booking Agency), the worlds of jazz, blues, and vaudeville came together in a fascinating mixture. Jazz musicians acquired the polish and sophistication of the performers who strutted in front of the footlights, while singers simultaneously absorbed much of the nuance and swing of jazz. Bessie Smith was not a jazz per- former herself; she was always a vaude- ville and blues singer. But for much of her career she was accompanied by the finest jazz musicians of her generation, from Louis Armstrong and Fletcher Henderson to saxophonist Chu Berry and clarinetist Buster Bailey. The com- bination of her emotional power as a singer and the musical depth of her accompaniments helped make her discs some of the finest recordings from the pioneer period of jazz. Her theater career began in 1912, under the wing of another great female blues singer, Gertrude \"Ma\" Rainey. Indeed, some early stories suggested that Rainey had \"kidnapped\" Bessie to take the teenager on the road. Throughout the period leading up to 1920, she toured the country, generally returning to a theater called the \"81\" in Atlanta, Georgia. Many aspiring jazz musicians heard her during this time — the teenage trumpeter Doc Cheatham, for example, actually sat in with her band in Nashville — and by 1922 she either hired her own backup bands or fronted prestigious orchestras like the Atlantic City group led by pianist Charlie Johnson. Following the sensational success of Mamie Smith (no relation to Bessie), who cut the first blues record, \"Crazy Blues,\" in 1920, Bessie apparently audi- tioned for several record companies, even cutting a test disc with Sidney Bechet that was never issued. Her first recordings were eventually made in February 1923, and within months she had become a major star. Her disc of \"Down-Hearted Blues\" sold over three- quarters of a million copies. It is symp- tomatic of her tempestuous lifestyle that only a few weeks before the session she had been fired from a stage show for fighting with its producer. And, shortly after the recording, she and her 38 • JAZZ MAKERS husband Jack Gee beat up the pianist on the session, Clarence Williams, for apparently trying to defraud her. There was soon plenty of money, as Bessie was earning good fees for her discs and hundreds of dollars a week for her theater appearances, amounts that were a fortune in 1923-24. At this stage, welcoming the contrast with her previous hand-to-mouth existence, she accepted most of the offers she received, and worked far harder than she needed. For a time her famous temper was kept in check and she did not overindulge in bootleg alcohol During the next four years she made a string of excep- tional recordings, adeptly handled by producer Frank Walker at Columbia. To modern ears, some of the accompaniments sound plodding and dated, but Bessie Smith's voice is full and well recorded throughout. The musicians on her best discs include members of Fletcher Henderson's band, notably Louis Armstrong, trombonist Charlie Green, and clarinetist Buster Bailey, whose contributions spur her on to a higher level of performance. She cut virtually all her discs in New York City, but appeared in person there infrequently, mainly continuing to work the provincial circuit where she was well known, but adding new the- aters in Cincinnati and Chicago to her itinerary. Eventually, she had her own railroad car and a customized tent made for her show, so that she could appear even where there was no circuit theater. As the years went on, stories fil- tered back from the touring circuit that Bessie's temper and her fondness for drink were getting the better of her. She was stabbed in her hometown of Chattanooga, she abandoned her band in Kentucky, and she indulged in sever- al liaisons with dancers and musicians, male and female, which jeopardized her relationship with Jack Gee, even though they adopted a son in 1926. On one occasion when Jack was accused of stepping out of line, she attempted to shoot him. Finally, in 1928, after he had an affair with another singer, Gertrude Saunders, their marriage broke up. For almost a year, Bessie's life con- tinued as it had been. She toured, she recorded, and she made her one and only film appearance. However, 1929 was a year in which dramatic changes took place. First, talking pictures, of which Bessie's own film was an exam- ple, rapidly began to overtake the pop- ularity of the touring theater circuit, reducing the opportunities for shows like Bessie's to play provincial cities. Second, the Wall Street crash ushered in the Great Depression, which sound- ed the death knell of much popular entertainment as people scrimped along on slender financial resources in order to remain alive. An artist of Bessie's stature might have survived the Depression, but in the wake of her sep- aration from Jack her dependence on alcohol increased. Just as she began to be feted by white intellectuals, like the writer and photographer Carl Van Vechten, who celebrated African- American show life and performers, her career took a serious turn for the worse. In 1930 she took to the road again with a show called Moaniri Low. It played to small theaters in out-of-the- way places, but it kept her in funds, as did the two shows in which she subse- quently appeared in New York City and Philadelphia. At the same time, Jack Gee managed to separate Bessie from Jack Jr., their adopted son, and she had to cope with this emotional trauma while carrying on working. Fortunately she found a new partner, Richard Morgan, who had become wealthy from bootlegging, and this helped soften the blow when she JAZZ MAKERS Bessie Smith BORN April 15, 1894 Chattanooga, Tennessee DIED September 26, 1937 Clarksdale, Mississippi MAJOR INTEREST Blues and vaudeville singing ACCOMPLISHMENTS The finest blues singer of her gener- ation, her phonograph records are an enduring monument to her art; accompanists include many pioneer jazzmen; wrote many important blues songs, including \"Backwater Blues,\" \"Jailhouse Blues,\" \"Reckless Blues,\" \"Young Woman's Blues.\" Featured in many touring shows, in- cluding Happy Times (1930), Broad- way Revue (1931), Fan Waves (1934), Hot from Harlem (1934), League of Rhythm (1936); appeared in film St. Louis Blues directed by Dudley Murphy and featuring James P.

She also accepted lower and lower fees for her theater appearances, but her voice could still work its old magic. One chance to hear this is in her last recording session, arranged in 1933 by the entrepreneur John Hammond, who paid the musicians out of his own pocket. Bessie's voice is in incompara- ble form on a selection of vaudeville songs in which she is accompanied by some key swing era musicians, includ- ing trumpeter Frankie Newton and trombonist Jack Teagarden. By 1937, there were signs that Bessie's career would revive, and she was being lined up to make further recordings and possibly another film. She had her drinking under control once more, and although her tours were seldom without incident, she was defi- nitely in the process of making a come- back when she was killed in an automo- bile accident 75 miles outside Memphis, where she had been appearing. For years after her death, rumors circulated that she had died as a result of being refused admission to a white hospital and bleeding to death en route to a hospital for black patients. The account of the doctor who attended her | disproves this, but he also made clear that her injuries were so severe she had only a slight chance of survival. In the case of a legend, however, rumors are often more potent than facts, and the story of Bessie Smith's death has come to symbolize the segregation of the South in which she grew up.

By then he had already taken an early form of jazz to the West Coast and to Chicago, where he settled during the 1920s. He did not record until the mid- 1920s, when he was considered by those who knew him to be past his prime. Nevertheless, his 1926 record of \"Stock Yards Strut\" reveals a player of huge power and swinging drive, one who must have been a formidable rival to King Oliver and Louis Arm- strong. Legend has it that Keppard refused the chance to record because he was worried about his material being copied by others. He was so concerned about rival musi- cians stealing his material that he apparently played with a handkerchief over his valve hand to conceal his fingering. Recent research suggests that in fact he turned down the deal because it did not pay enough. Consequently, Nick La Rocca (1889-1961), the cornet-playing leader of the Original Dixieland Jazz Band (or ODJB) made the first jazz discs in 1917, with colleagues Larry Shields (1893-1953) on clarinet, Eddie Edwards (1891-1963) on trombone, Henry Ragas (1891-1919) on piano, and Tony Sbarbaro (1897-1969) on drums. They took New York by storm after an appearance at Reisenwe- ber's restaurant in 1917, traveled to London, England, in 1919, and made many discs before disbanding in 1925. Rag- time composer J. Russell Robinson replaced Ragas, who died prematurely. The band's discs were influential in beginning the Jazz Age, and many of La Rocca's compositions, like \"At the Jazz Band Ball\" and \"Clarinet Marmalade,\" became popu- lar \"standard\" compositions in early jazz. The ODJB's five- piece instrumentation was widely copied in the early 1920s. Trombonist Edward \"Kid\" Ory (1890-1973) led the first African- American jazz band from New Orleans to make records. He had been a major figure in New Orleans until his Creole Jazz Band traveled to California in 1919, where they recorded \"Ory's Creole Trombone\" in 1922. He moved to Chicago in 1925, and became a prolific recording artist, working with Louis Armstrong, Jelly Roll Morton, and King Oliver. From the mid- 1940s, based on the West Coast once more, he became a leading figure in the New Orleans revival, playing an earthy brand of traditional jazz until his semiretirement in the 1960s. The clarinetist on many of Ory's discs was Johnny Dodds (1892-1940), whose soulful, bluesy clarinet captured much of the African heritage in jazz. His contemporaries, MORE JAZZ PIONEERS TO REMEMBER • 41 The Original Dixieland jazz Band in a characteristic \"novelty\" pose, in which trombonist Eddie Edwards and cornetist Nick La Rocca share a bucket mute, and even the clarinetist Larry Shields gets in on the act with a mute of his own. Also shown are drummer Tony Sbarbaro and pianist Henry Ragas. such as Barney Bigard (1906-80), Albert Nicholas (1900-73), and Jimmie Noone (1895- 1944), favored a more ornate, decorative style derived from classical music that became nick- named \"Creole\" clarinet playing. On many early records, the technology prevented drums from being used, as the sensitive needles that cut the record grooves in the wax master discs jumped out of place with any loud percussive sounds. Johnny Dodds's brother, Warren \"Baby\" Dodds (1898-1959), was one of the first drummers to record, although some of his earliest work on disc was playing the domestic wash- board with thimbles, a scratchy approx- imation of a snare drum, originally used by children's \"spasm\" or \"skiffle\" bands. In his later recordings Dodds captured the authentic sounds of New Orleans brass bands, with their rolling snares and booming bass drums. He was a great influence on many young white drummers who heard him on Chicago's South Side in the 1920s, as was his fel- low New Orleans percussionist Zutty Singleton (1898-1975). The \"Austin High School Gang\" was the name given to the young white Chicago musicians, because several of what became a ti"
