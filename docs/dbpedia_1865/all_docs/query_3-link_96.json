        "text": "New post-Voice music released recently includes singles from Casey Desmond, Jacquie Lee and Mia Z.\n\nHere’s a bit about each of those releases. The links take you to the songs on Apple Music. Or you can check out the Spotify snippets below.\n\n* Casey Desmond from Season 1 released a years-old song she wrote to her sister that she considered especially timely because of the coronavirus crisis. It’s called “Mary Lee” and she released it on her sister’s birthday. Writes Casey on social media: “We don’t get to celebrate together because of all the health risks at this time, however, I was finally able to release a song I wrote for her years ago across all streaming platforms today. Some of you remember this song, which I only ever had up on a private SoundCloud. We have so much madness and fear around us right now that it’s nice to take a second and remember the good stuff, like one another and the love we have for family and friends.” Wonderful gesture, Casey.\n\n* Mia Z (Zanotti) from Season 8 has released an addictive singer called “Danger” and an accompanying music video. It’s the second release of 2020 for Mia, following her Valentine’s Day release of “On the Knife” and the 21-year-old promises “there’s so much more music coming soon.” She wrote the new single with RJ Bertera and Kyle Horrell; Daniel Kelly filmed the music video.\n\n* Jacquie — Jacquie Lee when she was on Season 5 of The Voice — recently released a delightfully different new single called “Red.” It’s already been a busy 2020 for Jacquie, who released an EP called “Infinity” in early January. Those who were watching The Voice at the time will recall that Jacquie was runnerup to Tessanne Chin back in Season 5.\n\nIn addition:\n\n* Rizzi Myers from Season 16 is featured on a single called “Mug Shot,” released by rapper T.o.n.e.-z. The single also features a vocal assist from Colt Ford."
