        "text": "After looking at a book from one Australian publisher in my last post, today I’m casting an eye over a new release from another one, this time the excellent Scribe Publications. They put out a fair few translations each year, and this latest work comes from Indonesia, one of our closest neighbours. However, it actually takes us further afield than that, with a number of journeys outside the country, each designed to shed light on a rather tumultuous past. Let’s get the journey underway, then – we have a number of people waiting to meet us…\n\n*****\n\nDias Novita Wuri’s Birth Canal (translated by the writer, review copy courtesy of the publisher) is a novel in four parts, each named after a woman featured in that section. We begin in Indonesia, where an unnamed male narrator tells us the story of the beautiful Nastiti, a close friend who one day vanishes:\n\nShe didn’t charge her phone. She’d do it at some point, but right now she wasn’t going to do anything with it. At last, she took a deep breath and got up from the bench. She knew where she was headed and knew that it was time to go. She knew what ‘a place’ meant, her singular destination.\n\np.9 (Scribe Publications, 2023)\n\nDevastated by Nastiti’s disappearance, the man is suddenly contacted by her again after a long period of silence, called in to help her one last time with a very delicate matter.\n\nThe book then moves on to other women, other countries and, most importantly, other times. We follow a woman helping a Dutch researcher, at the same time pursuing family ties, while in post-war Yokohama, an American photographer is intrigued by a Japanese housewife. The final section takes us to present-day Osaka, where an Indonesian ex-pat crosses paths with a beautiful Japanese woman with a secret. Four stories, all different, but also interlinked, and with a common theme tying them together even more closely.\n\nAs you might have guessed from the title, Birth Canal has women at its heart. The four main characters each have their own cross to bear, struggling under the weight of their woes while trying to move on with their lives. Yet as much as there’s a female focus, it’s inevitable that men will become involved somewhere along the way, and while the narrator of the first story is there to help, few of the other men are shown in a good light.\n\nPregnancy and birth are at the heart of the stories, but if you’re expecting pink fuzzy moments here, you’ll be disappointed. While some of these pregnancy tales are concerned with an inability to conceive, others have more to do with how it happened, which can often be brutal. The writer introduces a numbers of cases of cheating, rape, miscarriage and abortion, which may disturb some readers, so be forewarned.\n\nAs much as the book focuses on the personal, though, there’s a fair bit here about the national story, too. Indonesia has experienced many foreign influences in the past, particularly during the Dutch colonial era and the war years, and Wuri weaves these into her tale. A particularly nice touch is the inclusion of quotations preceding each section, courtesy of Norman Erikson Pasaribu, Herman Koch, Bashō Matsuo and Sebastian Faulks. These apt epigraphs emphasise the international nature of the story, expanding the scope.\n\nPerhaps the most absorbing sections are the historical parts in the middle. In ‘Rukmini’, we have a woman telling her mother’s story to an academic, and a disturbing one it is, too:\n\nWhenever my mother cried, tears would fall down her cheeks just like that, as if she were leaking, and then the lack of liquid would deflate her. But whenever she told me about her past, I got the impression that she was actually bleeding so profusely that the blood formed a flood, and I was drowning in it. (pp.55/6)\n\nThis section touches on the fate of women rounded up by the occupying Japanese forces, and I was reminded of Kim Soom’s One Left (tr. Bruce and Ju-Chan Fulton), with Rukmini’s experiences showing it wasn’t just Koreans that the Japanese used as ‘comfort women’. Meanwhile, ‘Hana’ has us looking at the other side of the coin, with the title character attempting to reconnect with a husband who has returned from the war with no arms, and little will to live. By now, the conflict is over, but that doesn’t mean women are safe, particularly with predatory men around.\n\nOne thing most readers will notice is how the novel is marked by a blend of styles and view-points. The main characters are usually seen by others (an anonymous first-person narrator, a loving daughter, an inquisitive neighbour), and the sections tend to have two main strands. We continually jump between the different stories, and often back and forth in time, too. It’s all very well done, drawing the reader in and pushing them away at just the right points, until each story comes to a dramatic conclusion.\n\nIt will be interesting to see how well readers consider Birth Canal works as a novel, though. It could easily be read as four separate stories, even if there are links between them, and a recurring character bringing us full circle in the last piece. Of course, the common themes help bring the sections together, too, but it’s certainly not a novel in the sense of having one central plot. Nevertheless, it is an impressive first work in English for the writer, a book that explores the experiences of women in a male-dominated world, and the dilemma of whether to bring children into it. Each of the characters must decide for themselves what to do when the inevitable occurs, and whether death might be preferable to birth…"
