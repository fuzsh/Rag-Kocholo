        "text": "My reviews this week will see me taking a break from our International Booker Prize longlist journey, but as regular readers will know, my focus on literary fiction in translation means that our vicarious travels are unlikely to stop. Today’s choice sees me returning to one of my favourite literary destinations, South Korea, with a look at the latest work by a familiar name. We’re heading off into the countryside to spend some one-on-one time with an old man, whose ordinary life turns out to be anything but. As his daughter’s about to learn, there’s always more to your parents than you could ever imagine…\n\n*****\n\nKyung-Sook Shin is best known in the Anglosphere for her novel Please Look After Mother (translated by Chi-Young Kim), a novel in which a guilt-ridden family look back at their mother’s life and how they (mis)treated her. While it’s not a sequel as such, Shin’s latest work I Went to See My Father (translated by Anton Hur, review copy courtesy of Astra House) can be seen as a companion work of sorts, with the writer this time focusing on a father figure representative of his generation.\n\nThe set-up has a woman in her sixties, a writer, visiting her home town for the first time in a while. Her mother is in Seoul for a hospital visit, leaving her father alone, so the daughter decides to stay for a while and look after him. Unsurprisingly, their relationship has changed, and Hon (or Honnie, as her father calls her) begins to wonder just how accurate the picture she’s had of her father all these years is, and whether she’s neglected him.\n\nOver almost three-hundred pages, which pass in a leisurely manner, the daughter learns more about her father’s life. This comes from letters she discovers, memories she interprets in a new way and stories from other people. Early in the book, she writes:\n\nSome people are born into love and attention and support from their parents, live their lives in this world expressing everything they want to, and leaving behind their immortal names. Then others, like Father, are born in a completely ordinary farming house far from the then town of J—, in the middle of nowhere in South Korea, prevented from setting foot in school and never leaving home except for survival itself, living a life of dust.\n\np.13 (Astra House, 2023)\n\nHaving believed there was little extraordinary about such a man, she’s to discover how wrong she is, in many ways, as she learns about his feats and sniffs out hints of a couple of dark secrets.\n\nI Went to See My Father is very similar to Please Look After Mother in its focus on reevaluating the life of an old person, but there are perhaps differences in tone, with the later work less angst-ridden and accusatory. Hon uses her trip to come closer to her father, filling in gaps in her memories of him while enjoying her time back at home. Piece by piece, a picture emerges for the reader, turning a frail old pensioner into a man who lived a full life.\n\nThere are also similarities with the earlier novel in how the daughter is immersed in guilt. From an early memory of ignoring her father as they crossed paths on a local bridge to her realisation of how little she’s done for him in recent times, there’s a sense of having failed him in some way:\n\nWhat could I possibly have to say for myself? For the past few years, I hadn’t even called my parents regularly. Especially my father. And they couldn’t come to see me, either; I wouldn’t allow it. We’ll meet some other time, some other time, another time… That’s all I’d ever say. I’d already known. That someday I would regret every moment I didn’t spend with Father when I had the chance. (p.105)\n\nHer current visit is an opportunity to make up for this, and a final chance to get to know more about her father before it’s too late.\n\nLike many Korean novels, I Went to See My Father is also an excuse to run through many of the traumatic events of the twentieth century. Hon tells us about her father’s (mis)adventures during the Korean War, including attempting to avoid being drafted, or killed by North Korean partisans and southern draft dodgers. Later, when the children are older, we move on to protests in Seoul, with her father evading tear gas and bullets that could easily have cut his story tragically short. Viewers and readers of Korean dramas and novels love a bit of teary nostalgia, and Shin provides it here in spades, and does a good job of it, too.\n\nInterestingly, there’s also a rather autobiographical slant to the book. That starts with the town of J— where Hon was born (Shin’s home town of Jeongup), as well as the narrator’s revelation that (like Shin) she’s the fourth child of six, and the eldest daughter. When we hear that her debut work was called Winter Fable (again, a parallel with Shin’s own life), it’s hard to decide how much of this is actually fiction.\n\nThis feeling is emphasised by the style, which is decidedly unstructured at times, deliberately so. The book is often more a series of anecdotes and memories than a cohesive novel. For example, the fourth of the five sections is simply a series of accounts, stories about the writer’s father by family and friends, taking us away from Hon’s own view of events. It’s all nicely done, with these shades of autofiction drawing the reader in rather than keeping them at a distance."
