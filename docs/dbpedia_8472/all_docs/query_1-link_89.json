        "text": "‘Refresh Man’ completed filming after 5 months; Aaron Yan to film his first Mainland Chinese drama in July\n\nTTV and SETTV idol drama ‘Refresh Man’ held their early farewell wrap up party on 3rd June, Aaron Yan, Joanne Tseng and the other casts were present. Aaron said, “Within these few months, we filmed a lot of scenes which involved competition, my emotions more or less have been affected by these scenes, now we have completed filming, we will return to being good friends again, so happy.” Before the party ended, Joanne Tseng and Lene Lai took off Aaron’s vest top, showing off his abs and he became an eye candy for the girls at the party!\n\nThe filming of ‘Refresh Man’ commenced at the end of January 2016, during these 5 months of filming the casts developed some great friendships, Aaron said, “We went to Neiwan to film for an entire day in a scorching 38 degrees heat, my body temperature was as hot as 40 degrees, I had to wear a vest top to cool myself down.” He added, “Whether it’s filming or off cameras, me and Joanne interact with each other very naturally, we are not awkward even when we hold hands or say sweet words to each other.”\n\nThough everyone is happy the drama is finally completed, everyone still feels a bit sad to depart, the production crew even printed the casts’ faces onto macarons to give out to everyone.\n\nAaron will be heading to Mainland China to film another drama in July, he said, “Since I prefer to eat foods that are light, so I will have to buy these foods myself.” Joanne suggested, “You can hire a local assistant when you get there, they will know how to cook; I know an assistant myself, I love eating crabs so she’ll always go to the market everyday and buy crabs for me, she also knows how to make soup.” In addition to foods, Aaron said he’ll miss his dogs very much, “Because I don’t have children right now so I will put all my attention on the dogs; they will sleep next to my leg or climb next to my arm to sleep, little actions like these make me feel so comforted.” Aaron even installed CCTVs in his house so he keep an eye on his dogs anytime and anywhere to relieve his lovesickness for his dogs."
