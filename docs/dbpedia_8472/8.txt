Lene Lai, a Taiwanese model, is owned by Yilin Models Co., Ltd., and looks like a model of Cathy. I used to participate in the "I Love Black Skull" with the name of the stage, because of the mature and sexy appearance, a pair of slender legs and a charming electric eye, known as "the wife and the girl". And once served as a stuffy girl in "The Great Man". In 2008, she won the third place in the Hong Kong Miss Asia Competition, but her popularity was greatly increased due to the mistakes in the number of votes. The 17-year-old debut has always been known for being sexy. Lai Linen has evolved over a decade and evolved into a charming little woman from a little girl who is waiting to be released.
