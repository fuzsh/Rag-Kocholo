        "text": "A review snippet is a short excerpt of a review or a rating from a review website, usually an average of the combined rating scores from many reviewers. When Google finds valid reviews or ratings markup, we may show a rich snippet that includes stars and other summary info from reviews or ratings. In addition to the text of the review, a rating is an evaluation described on a numeric scale (such as 1 to 5). Review snippets may appear in rich results or Google Knowledge Panels. You can supply ratings for the following content types (and subtypes):\n\nBook\n\nCourse\n\nEvent\n\nHow-to\n\nLocal business (only for sites that capture reviews about other local businesses; see the guidelines about self-serving reviews)\n\nMovie\n\nProduct\n\nRecipe\n\nSoftware App\n\nGoogle also supports reviews for the following schema.org types (and their subtypes):\n\nCreativeWorkSeason\n\nCreativeWorkSeries\n\nEpisode\n\nGame\n\nMediaObject\n\nMusicPlaylist\n\nMusicRecording\n\nOrganization (only for sites that capture reviews about other organizations; see the guidelines about self-serving reviews)\n\nHow to add structured data\n\nStructured data is a standardized format for providing information about a page and classifying the page content. If you're new to structured data, you can learn more about how structured data works.\n\nHere's an overview of how to build, test, and release structured data.\n\nAdd the required properties. Based on the format you're using, learn where to insert structured data on the page.\n\nFollow the guidelines.\n\nValidate your code using the Rich Results Test and fix any critical errors. Consider also fixing any non-critical issues that may be flagged in the tool, as they can help improve the quality of your structured data (however, this isn't necessary to be eligible for rich results).\n\nDeploy a few pages that include your structured data and use the URL Inspection tool to test how Google sees the page. Be sure that your page is accessible to Google and not blocked by a robots.txt file, the noindex tag, or login requirements. If the page looks okay, you can ask Google to recrawl your URLs.\n\nTo keep Google informed of future changes, we recommend that you submit a sitemap. You can automate this with the Search Console Sitemap API.\n\nExamples\n\nThere are several ways you can add Review structured data to a page:\n\nAdd a simple review.\n\nNest a review into another schema.org type using its review property.\n\nAdd aggregate ratings. You can omit the rating for an individual review if your marked-up content contains both an author and a review date. For aggregate reviews, you must supply the average rating for the rich snippet to display.\n\nNest aggregate ratings into another schema.org type using its aggregateRating property.\n\nSimple review\n\nHere's an example of a simple review.\n\nJSON-LD\n\n<html> <head> <title>Legal Seafood</title> <script type=\"application/ld+json\"> { \"@context\": \"https://schema.org/\", \"@type\": \"Review\", \"itemReviewed\": { \"@type\": \"Restaurant\", \"image\": \"https://www.example.com/seafood-restaurant.jpg\", \"name\": \"Legal Seafood\", \"servesCuisine\": \"Seafood\", \"priceRange\": \"$$$\", \"telephone\": \"1234567\", \"address\" :{ \"@type\": \"PostalAddress\", \"streetAddress\": \"123 William St\", \"addressLocality\": \"New York\", \"addressRegion\": \"NY\", \"postalCode\": \"10038\", \"addressCountry\": \"US\" } }, \"reviewRating\": { \"@type\": \"Rating\", \"ratingValue\": \"4\" }, \"author\": { \"@type\": \"Person\", \"name\": \"Bob Smith\" }, \"publisher\": { \"@type\": \"Organization\", \"name\": \"Washington Times\" } } </script> </head> <body> </body> </html>\n\nRDFa\n\n<html> <head> <title>Legal Seafood</title> </head> <body> <div vocab=\"https://schema.org/\" typeof=\"Review\"> <div property=\"itemReviewed\" typeof=\"Restaurant\"> <img property=\"image\" src=\"https://example.com/photos/1x1/seafood-restaurant.jpg\" alt=\"Legal Seafood\"/> <span property=\"name\">Legal Seafood</span> <span property=\"servesCuisine\">Seafood</span> <span property=\"priceRange\">$$$</span> <span property=\"telephone\">1234567</span> <span property=\"address\">123 William St, New York</span> </div> <span property=\"reviewRating\" typeof=\"Rating\"> <span property=\"ratingValue\">4</span> </span> stars - <b>\"A good seafood place.\" </b> <span property=\"author\" typeof=\"Person\"> <span property=\"name\">Bob Smith</span> </span> <div property=\"publisher\" typeof=\"Organization\"> <meta property=\"name\" content=\"Washington Times\"> </div> </div> </body> </html>\n\nMicrodata\n\n<html> <head> <title>Legal Seafood</title> </head> <body> <div itemscope itemtype=\"https://schema.org/Review\"> <div itemprop=\"itemReviewed\" itemscope itemtype=\"https://schema.org/Restaurant\"> <img itemprop=\"image\" src=\"https://example.com/photos/1x1/seafood-restaurant.jpg\" alt=\"Legal Seafood\"/> <span itemprop=\"name\">Legal Seafood</span> <span itemprop=\"servesCuisine\">Seafood</span> <span itemprop=\"priceRange\">$$$</span> <span itemprop=\"telephone\">1234567</span> <span itemprop=\"address\">123 William St, New York</span> </div> <span itemprop=\"reviewRating\" itemscope itemtype=\"https://schema.org/Rating\"> <span itemprop=\"ratingValue\">4</span> </span> stars - <b>\"A good seafood place.\" </b> <span itemprop=\"author\" itemscope itemtype=\"https://schema.org/Person\"> <span itemprop=\"name\">Bob Smith</span> </span> <div itemprop=\"publisher\" itemscope itemtype=\"https://schema.org/Organization\"> <meta itemprop=\"name\" content=\"Washington Times\"> </div> </div> </body> </html>\n\nNested review\n\nHere's an example of a review that's nested in a Product.

Google may display aggregate ratings as rich snippets or, for certain types of items, answers in search results.\n\nRefer clearly to a specific product or service by nesting the review within the markup of another schema.org type, such as schema.org/Book or schema.org/Recipe, or by using a schema.org type as a value for the itemReviewed property.\n\nMake sure the reviews and ratings you mark up are readily available to users from the marked-up page. It must be immediately obvious to users that the page has review content.\n\nProvide review information about a specific item, not about a category or a list of items.\n\nIf you include multiple individual reviews, also include an aggregate rating of the individual reviews.\n\nDon't aggregate reviews or ratings from other websites.\n\nIf the review snippet is for a local business or an organization, you must follow these additional guidelines:\n\nIf the entity that's being reviewed controls the reviews about itself, their pages that use LocalBusiness or any other type of Organization structured data are ineligible for star review feature. For example, a review about entity A is placed on the website of entity A, either directly in their structured data or through an embedded third-party widget (for example, Google Business reviews or Facebook reviews widget).\n\nRatings must be sourced directly from users.\n\nDon't rely on human editors to create, curate, or compile ratings information for local businesses.\n\nStructured data type definitions\n\nYou must include the required properties for your structured data to display in search results. You can also include the recommended properties to add more information to your structured data, which could provide a better user experience.\n\nReview\n\nThe full definition of Review is available at schema.org/Review.\n\nThe Google-supported properties are the following:\n\nRequired properties\n\nRecommended properties\n\nAggregateRating\n\nThe full definition of AggregateRating is available at schema.org/AggregateRating.\n\nThe Google-supported properties are the following:\n\nRequired properties\n\nRecommended properties\n\nMonitor rich results with Search Console\n\nSearch Console is a tool that helps you monitor how your pages perform in Google Search. You don't have to sign up for Search Console to be included in Google Search results, but it can help you understand and improve how Google sees your site. We recommend checking Search Console in the following cases:\n\nAfter deploying structured data for the first time\n\nAfter releasing new templates or updating your code\n\nAnalyzing traffic periodically\n\nAfter deploying structured data for the first time\n\nAfter Google has indexed your pages, look for issues using the relevant Rich result status report. Ideally, there will be an increase of valid items, and no increase in invalid items. If you find issues in your structured data:\n\nFix the invalid items.\n\nInspect a live URL to check if the issue persists.\n\nRequest validation using the status report.\n\nAfter releasing new templates or updating your code\n\nWhen you make significant changes to your website, monitor for increases in structured data invalid items.\n\nIf you see an increase in invalid items, perhaps you rolled out a new template that doesn't work, or your site interacts with the existing template in a new and bad way.\n\nIf you see a decrease in valid items (not matched by an increase in invalid items), perhaps you are no longer embedding structured data in your pages. Use the URL Inspection tool to learn what is causing the issue.\n\nAnalyzing traffic periodically\n\nAnalyze your Google Search traffic using the Performance Report. The data will show you how often your page appears as a rich result in Search, how often users click on it and what is the average position you appear on search results. You can also automatically pull these results with the Search Console API.\n\nTroubleshooting\n\nIf you're having trouble implementing or debugging structured data, here are some resources that may help you.\n\nIf you're using a content management system (CMS) or someone else is taking care of your site, ask them to help you. Make sure to forward any Search Console message that details the issue to them.\n\nGoogle does not guarantee that features that consume structured data will show up in search results. For a list of common reasons why Google may not show your content in a rich result, see the General Structured Data Guidelines.\n\nYou might have an error in your structured data. Check the list of structured data errors and the Unparsable structured data report.\n\nIf you received a structured data manual action against your page, the structured data on the page will be ignored (although the page can still appear in Google Search results). To fix structured data issues, use the Manual Actions report.\n\nReview the guidelines again to identify if your content isn't compliant with the guidelines. The problem can be caused by either spammy content or spammy markup usage. However, the issue may not be a syntax issue, and so the Rich Results Test won't be able to identify these issues.\n\nTroubleshoot missing rich results / drop in total rich results.\n\nAllow time for re-crawling and re-indexing. Remember that it may take several days after publishing a page for Google to find and crawl it. For general questions about crawling and indexing, check the Google Search crawling and indexing FAQ.\n\nPost a question in the Google Search Central forum."
