        "text": "Compare and contrast essays are academic papers in which a student analyses two or more subjects with each other. To compare means to explore similarities between subjects, while to contrast means to look at their differences. Both subjects of the comparison are usually in the same category, although they have their differences. For example, it can be two movies, two universities, two cars etc.\n\nGood compare and contrast papers from college essay writer focus on a central point, explaining the importance and implications of this analysis. A compare and contrast essay thesis must make a meaningful comparison. Find the central theme of your essay and do some brainstorming for your thesis.\n\nThis type of essay is very common among college and university students. Professors challenge their students to use their analytical and comparative skills and pay close attention to the subjects of their comparisons. This type of essay exercises observance and analysis, helps to establish a frame of reference, and makes meaningful arguments about a subject. Let's get deeper on how to write a compare and contrast essay with our research writing services.\n\nHow to Start a Compare and Contrast Essay: Brainstorm Similarities and Differences\n\nNow that you know what is compare and contrast essay and are set with your topic, the first thing you should do is grab a piece of paper and make a list with two columns: similarities and differences. Jot down key things first, the most striking ones. Then try to look at the subjects from a different angle, incorporating your imagination.\n\nIf you are more of a visual learner, creating a Venn diagram might be a good idea. In order to create it, draw two circles that overlap. In the section where it overlaps, note similarities. Differences should be written in the part of the circle that does not overlap.\n\nLetâs look at a simple example of compare and contrast essay. Let one of the subjects be oranges, and the other one be apples. Oranges have thick peel, originally from India, and are tropical fruit. These characteristics pertain only to oranges and should be in the part of the circle that does not overlap. For the same section on apples, we put thin peel, originated in Turkey or Kazakhstan, and moderate to subtropical. In the section that overlaps, letâs say that they are both fruit, can be juiced, and grow on trees. This simple, yet good example illustrates how the same concept can be applied to many other complicated topics with additional points of comparison and contrast.\n\nThis format of visual aid helps to organize similarities and differences and make them easier to perceive. Your diagram will give you a clear idea of the things you can write about.\n\nAnother good idea for brainstorming in preparation for your comparison contrast essay is to create a list with 2 columns, one for each subject, and compare the same characteristics for each of them simultaneously. This compare and contrast format will make writing your comparison contrast paper argument a breeze, as you will have your ideas ready and organized.\n\nOne mistake you should avoid is simply listing all of the differences or similarities for each subject. Sometimes students get too caught up in looking for similarities and differences that their compare and contrast essays end up sounding like grocery lists. Your essay should be based on analyzing the similarities and differences, analyzing your conclusions about the two subjects, and finding connections between themâwhile following a specific format.\n\nCompare and Contrast Essay Structure and Outline\n\nSo, how do you structure this compare and contrast paper? Well, since compare and contrast essay examples rely heavily on factual analysis, there are two outline methods that can help you organize your facts. You can use the block method, or point-by-point method, to write a compare and contrast essay outline.\n\nWhile using the block structure of a compare and contrast essay, all the information is presented for the first subject, and its characteristics and specific details are explained. This concludes one block. The second block takes the same approach as the first for the second subject.\n\nThe point-by-point structure lists each similarity and difference simultaneouslyâmaking notes of both subjects. For example, you can list a characteristic specific to one subject, followed by its similarity or difference to the other subject.\n\nBoth formats have their pros and cons. The block method is clearly easier for a compare and contrast essay writer, as you simply point out all of the information about the two subjects, and basically leave it to the reader to do the comparison. The point-by-point format requires you to analyze the points yourself while making similarities and differences more explicit to the reader for them to be easier to understand. Here is a detailed structure of each type presented below.\n\nPoint-by-Point Method\n\nIntro\n\nIntroduce the topic;\n\nSpecify your theme;\n\nPresent your thesis - cover all areas of the essay in one sentence.\n\nExample thesis: Cars and motorcycles make for excellent means of transportation, but a good choice depends on the personâs lifestyle, finances, and the city they live in.\n\nBody Paragraph 1 - LIFESTYLE\n\nTopic Sentence: Motorcycles impact the ownerâs lifestyle less than cars.\n\nTopic 1 - Motorcycles\n\n~ Argument: Motorcycles are smaller and more comfortable to store.\n\n~ Argument: Motorcycles are easy to learn and use.\n\nTopic 2 - Cars\n\n~ Argument: Cars are a big deal - they are like a second home.\n\n~ Argument: It takes time to learn to become a good driver.\n\nBody Paragraph 2 - FINANCES\n\nTopic sentence: Cars are much more expensive than motorcycles\n\nTopic 1 - Motorcycles\n\n~ Argument: You can buy a good motorcycle for under 300$.\n\n~ Argument: Fewer parts that are more accessible to fix.\n\nTopic 2 - Cars\n\n~ Argument: Parts and service are expensive if something breaks.\n\n~ Argument: Cars need more gas than motorcycles.\n\nBody Paragraph 3 - CITY\n\nTopic sentence: Cars are a better option for bigger cities with wider roads.\n\nTopic 1 - Motorcycles\n\n~ Argument: Riding motorcycles in a big city is more dangerous than with cars.\n\n~ Argument: Motorcycles work great in a city like Rome, where all the streets are narrow.\n\nTopic 2 - Cars\n\n~ Argument: Big cities are easier and more comfortable to navigate by car.\n\n~ Argument: With a car, traveling outside of the city is much easier.\n\nConclusion\n\nSum up all you wrote in the article.\n\nBlock Method\n\nIntro\n\nIntroduce the topic;\n\nSpecify your theme;\n\nThesis â cover all areas of the essay in one sentence\n\nExample thesis: Cars and motorcycles make for excellent means of transportation, but a good choice depends on the personâs lifestyle, finances, and the city they live in.\n\nBody Paragraph 1\n\nTopic Sentence: Motorcycles are cheaper and easier to take care of than cars.\n\nAspect 1 - Lifestyle\n\n~ Argument: Motorcycles are smaller and more comfortable to store.\n\n~ Argument: Motorcycles are easy to learn and use.\n\nAspect 2 - Finances\n\n~ Argument: You can buy a good motorcycle for under 300$.\n\n~ Argument: Fewer parts, easier to fix.\n\nAspect 3 - City\n\n~ Argument: Riding motorcycles in a big city is more dangerous than cars.\n\n~ Argument: Motorcycles work great in a city like Rome, where all the streets are narrow.\n\nBody Paragraph 2\n\nTopic sentence: Cars are more expensive but more comfortable for a big city and for travelling.\n\nAspect 1 - Lifestyle\n\n~ Argument: Cars are a big dealâlike a second home.\n\n~ Argument: It takes time to learn to become a good driver.\n\nAspect 2 - Finances\n\n~ Argument: Parts and service are expensive if something breaks.\n\n~ Argument: Cars need more gas than motorcycles.\n\nAspect 3 - City\n\n~ Argument: Big cities are easier and more comfortable to navigate by car.\n\n~ Argument: With a car, traveling outside the city is much more comfortable.\n\nBody Paragraph 3â\n\nUse the last paragraph to evaluate the comparisons and explain why theyâre essential. Giving a lot of facts can be intense. To water it down, try to give the reader any real-life applications of these facts.\n\nDepending on the structure selected, you can begin to create an outline for your essay. The typical comparison essay follows the format of having an introduction, three body paragraphs, and a conclusion â though, if you need to focus on each subject in more detailed ways, feel free to include an extra paragraph to cover all of the most important points.\n\nTo make your compare and contrast essay flow better, we recommend using special transition words and phrases. They will add variety and improve your paper overall.\n\nFor the section where you compare two subjects, you can include any of the following words: similarly, likewise, also, both, just like, similar to, the same as, alike, or to compare to. When contrasting two subjects, use: in contrast, in comparison, by comparison, on the other hand, while, whereas, but, to differ from, dissimilar to, or unlike.\n\nShow Your Evidence\n\nArguments for any essay, including compare and contrast essays, need to be supported by sufficient evidence. Make good use of your personal experiences, books, scholarly articles, magazine and newspaper articles, movies, or anything that will make your argument sound credible. For example, in your essay, if you were to compare attending college on campus vs. distance-based learning, you could include your personal experiences of being a student, and how often students show up to class on a daily basis. You could also talk about your experience taking online classes, which makes your argument about online classes credible as well.\n\nHelpful Final Tips\n\nThe biggest tip dissertation writing services can give you is to have the right attitude when writing a compare contrast essay, and actively engage the reader in the discussion.

Geert Hofstede came up with a structured way of comparing cultural dimensions of different countries. The theory explains the impacts of a communityâs culture on the values of the community members, and the way these values relate to their behaviors. He gives scores as a way to help distinguish people from different nations using the following dimensions: long-term orientation, individualism, power distance, indulgence, necessity avoidance, and masculinity. Let us examine comparisons between two countries: the United Kingdom and China â based on Hofstedeâs Six Dimensions of Culture.\n\nOver the last two decades, the demand from consumers for organic foods has increased tremendously. In fact, the popularity of organic foods has exploded significantly with consumers, spending a considerably higher amount of money on them as compared to the amount spent on inorganic foods. The US market noted an increase in sales of more than 10% between 2014 and 2015 (Brown, n.p). The increase is in line with the views of many consumers that organic foods are safer, tastier, and healthier compared to the inorganic foods. Furthermore, considering the environmental effects of foods, organic foods present less risk of environmental pollution â compared to inorganic foods. By definition, organic foods are those that are grown without any artificial chemical treatment, or treatment by use of other substances that have been modified genetically, such as hormones and/or antibiotics (Brown, n.p).\n\nStill feeling confused about the complexities of the compare and contrast essay? Feel free to contact our paper writing service to get a professional writing help.\n\nFinding the Best Compare and Contrast Essay Topics For You\n\nWhen choosing a topic for your comparison essay, remember that subjects cannot be drastically different, because there would be little to no points of comparison (similarities). The same goes for too many similarities, which will result in poor contrasts. For example, it is better to write about two composers, rather than a composer and a singer.\n\nIt is extremely important to choose a topic you are passionate about. You never want to come across something that seems dull and uninspiring for you. Here are some excellent ways to brainstorm for a topic from essay writer:\n\nFind categories: Choose a type (like animals, films or economics), and compare subjects within that category â wild animals to farm animals, Star Wars to Star Trek, private companies to public companies, etc.\n\nRandom Surprising Fact: Dig for fun facts which could make great topics. Did you know that chickens can be traced back to dinosaurs?\n\nMovie vs. Book: Most of the time, the book is better than the movie â unless itâs Blade Runner or Lord of the Rings. If youâre a pop culture lover, compare movies vs. books, video games, comics, etc.\n\nUse our rewrite essay service when you need help from professionals.\n\nHow to Choose a Great Compare and Contrast Topic\n\nCollege students should consider providing themselves with a chance to use all topic examples. With enough revision, an advantage is gained. As it will be possible to compare arguments and contrast their aspects. Also, discuss numerous situations to get closer to the conclusion.\n\nFor example:"
