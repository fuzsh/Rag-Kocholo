        "text": "Just like ancient Greek and Roman historiographers, medieval Oriental historians too were vexed by the problems they faced when inventing or constructing history and in devising and defining strategies for both formulating and categorizing historical narratives. In other words, they are struggling with what counts as or constitutes an historical record; what we have learned from studying their traditions and sources is that most cultures and civilizations proved only moderately successful in delimiting the all too porous boundaries prevailing between what we today categorize as myths, historical fiction and traditional historiography. Tibet, popularly known as the 'Roof of the World'- remote, inaccessible and isolated over long stretches of time, and largely unknown to most people-includes a civilization of great antiquity. Yet, a few idiosyncratic features characterize Tibetan historiography. Compared to her immediate neighbors, India, China, and for that matter Mongolia - major civilizations and countries with whom Tibet over time was to entertain strong and enduring cultural, political and historical bonds - national and historical writing for over a millennium remained strongly influenced and dominated by religion and ecclesiasticism. In due course of time, writing history therefore primarily meant writing or retelling the history of religion, its foremost representatives and their institutions.\n\nHistoriography in Tibet shows many features of syncretism, similarly to Tibetan Buddhism in general. Beyond containing records of actual events, Tibetan historiography is full of etiological myths modified according to current ideological needs, yet preserving many ancient motifs. These express not only the origins of the Tibetan people but also the wider context of the movements and interactions of the different peoples of India, Tibet and China. 1 In this paper I shall investigate a quasi-historical event in the biographies of the second 'Dharma King' of the Tibetan Empire, Khri-srong Lde-btsan (Trisong Detsen 2). As the newborn heir to the throne, he was stolen from his mother by a rival queen; however, at a ceremonial event the still infant prince indicated his true descent by sitting on the lap of his maternal uncle. As Ruzsa (2016) noticed, the complex motif of the new ruler choosing his family by sitting on the lap of a male representative can be found in the Indian legend of Śunaḥśepa, embedded into a much richer structure. Following his reconstruction, by analysing further parallelisms in a wider corpus, it appears that the seemingly innocent story of a baby prince is, in fact, a remnant of an archaic rite. I argue that originally this was a rite of passage, related to a special variant of puberty initiation: the consecration of the heir apparent. Furthermore, its relationship to the Indian legend of Śunaḥśepa connects it indirectly with the stories of Isaac and even Snow White and also with several rites of passage in ancient Greece. 3 I will also suggest that some versions of the legend point to a probably even more obsolete cycle of maternity rites with parallels in Solomon’s judgment and the Chinese Chalk Circle."
