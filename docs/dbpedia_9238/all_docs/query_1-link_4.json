        "text": "The Dalai Lama ruled in Tibet until October 7, 1950 when Chinese Communist troops occupied Tibet. It was formally annexed by China on May 23, 1951. Tibet has been an autonomous, but not independent, province within China since 1965.\n\nTibet's monetary system was more closely tied to India than to China until the Twentieth Century. The Tangka was the principal unit of account in Tibet until 1912. The Indian Rupee was equal to 3 Tangka, and 1 Tangka was equal to 6 Annas, though 1 Rupee was equal to 16 Annas. A second monetary system, also based on the Tangka was introduced around 1912. In this system, coins similar to Indian Rupees were minted in Tibet, and 1 Rupee was divisible into 4 Srang or 6 Tangka. There were further subdivisions into 40 Sho (1/10 Srang) or 90 Skar (1/15 Tangka). The Government of Tibet issued banknotes.\n\nAfter Chinese annexation of Tibet, the Chinese monetary system was introduced. The Jen Min Piao Yuan (CNP) was used in Tibet until the new Renminbi (People's) Yuan (CNY) replaced it on March 1, 1955 at the rate of 10,000 Old Yuan equal to 1 New Yuan. The People's Bank of China is the sole banknote issuing authority in China. The Yuan is divisible into 10 Chiao or 100 Fen."
