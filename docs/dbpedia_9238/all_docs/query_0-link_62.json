Input by Dan Martin, Jerusalem. Diacritic Sanskrit and Tibetan script are both now done in a unicode font, but beware of the diacritics and verify that they are correct. Someday someone will make a perfect study that will supply full coverage of all these things. Until then this may be of some use to some people some of the time. I realize that the bibliographical references are often presented in an inadequate form, and hope to repair this problem in the near future.\n\nNote: Leonard W.J. van der Kuijp, “A lag sha Ngag dbang bstan dar (1759-after August 1, 1840) on some Chinese Lexemes and the Chinese Language, Part Two,” Revue d'Etudes Tibétaines, no. 70 (April 2024), pp. 101-137, has much discussion about measurements of size and value, using significant literary sources different than those used here.\n\nNotice the high numbers and measurements in the account of the historical Buddha's childhood schooling as told in Lalitavistara, ch. 12 (English translation, pp. 223-227).\n\nDpa'-bo Gtsug-lag-phreng-ba attributed the introduction of standard weights and measures to the grandfather of Srong-btsan-sgam-po, Stag-ri-gnyan-gzigs.

This would date their introduction to the mid to late sixth century.\n\nConsidering the tradition of weights and measures in the present catalogue, CHABSPEL (1989: 129-30) notes the following related traditions of weights and measures:\n\nWeights and Measures for Grain:\n\nTradition One:\n\n1 phul = 3.5 ya-khyor;\n\n1 bre = 21 ya-khyor = 6 phul;\n\n20 bre = 1 khal.\n\nTradition Two:\n\n1 phul = 3 ya-khyor;\n\n1 bre = 21 ya-khyor = 7 phul;\n\n20 bre = 1 khal.\n\nWeights and Measures for Meat, Butter and so forth:\n\n20 se = 1 zho;\n\n10 zho = 1 srang;\n\n4 srang or 4 spor = 1 nyag;\n\n20 nyag = 80 srang = 1 khal.\n\nWeights and Measures for Silver, Gold and so forth:\n\n7 sran = 1 nam; 7 nam = 1 zho; 10 zho = 1 srang.\n\n- - -\n\nFrom: Dung-dkar Rin-po-che, History, pp. 60-61.\n\n\"Some historians say that horses were priced at four ཁལ་ [khal] of grain each.\"\n\nSource: Dung-dkar 184: bre srang sogs kyi 'jal tshad rgya gar ma gha dha'i tshad gzhi dang mthun par gcig gyur byed dgos pa de yin / de'i dgos pa ni / skabs der bod sa gnas su phul drug la bre gang du rtsis pa'i drug phul ma dang phul bdun la bre gang du rtsis pa'i bdun phul ma zhes mi 'dra ba gnyis yod pa'i thog bod bre gang la drug phul rtsis na ma gha dha'i bre phyed las med cing / bdun phul yin na ma ga dha'i bre gang la bod bre do dang khyor ba gang yod pa bcas khyad par chen po yod pa dang / de bzhin ma gha dha'i gser zho brgyad la gser srang gang / gser srang bcu drug la gser bre gang du rtsis kyi yod pas / ma gha dha'i gser srang gang la bod kyi gser srang do yod pa bcas kyi he bag chen po des bod dang rgya gar bar tshong 'brel byed skabs stabs bde yong ched / 'jal gshor 'degs gsum gyi tshad gcig gyur gyi gtan 'bebs mdzad pa yin.\n\nSource: Topgyal in Tibet Journal XXIII no 3 (1998) 36: \"two goats are equal to one sheep, five or six sheeps to one 'bri or yak and four or five yaks to one horse.

The measurements they most frequently use are the following (p. 158).\n\n4 nas = 1 rkang\n\n4 rkang = 1 sor (sor mo)\n\n= 1 cha phran\n\n4 sor mo = 1 chag (fist width)\n\n12 sor mo = 1 thal mo (or, mthil, tāla) or\n\n= 1 mtho (or mtho zhal, span) or\n\n= 1 zhal (or, zhal tshad) or\n\n= 1 gdong (size of face) or\n\n= 1 cha chen\n\n24 sor mo = 1 khru (hasta, cubit)\n\nOn Human measurements in art:\n\nSource: Lokesh Chandra, Buddhist Colossi and the Avataṃsaka Sūtras, contained in: Lokesh Chandra, Cultural Horizons of India, International Academy of Indian Culture (New Delhi 1993), vol. 6, pp. 32-51.\n\nAt p. 34-35:\n\nThe breadth of the finger/aṅguli of the hand of the donor provides the proportions in portrait images. The Śāriputra-śilpaśāstra, verse 21: \"The wise man makes an image according to the size of the finger's breadth of the donor\" (H. Ruelius, Śāriputra und Alekhyalakṣaṇa, 1974: 82-88, quoted in Schroeder 1981: 33).\n\n(What follows is a quote from Lo Bue 1990: 192):\n\nThe need of linking images to the actual features of the human body is further revealed by the habit of basing iconometric units of measurement on those of real people. Apparently, as early as the 7th century, the Tibetan King Srong-brtsan-sgam-po commissioned a famous Newar artist to make eleven images of Avalokiteśvara of the same size as himself.\n\nIn the 14th century the prince of Gyantse had the silver image of Tārā in Indian style made in proportions having as their unit of measure his dead wife's thumb. His grandson prince Rab brtan kun bzang 'phags pa (1389-1442) had a gilded copper statue of Vairocana measuring 21 spans (Tib. phyag mtho) made following his bodily measurements.\n\nDuring the same century the Newar King Yakṣamalla commissioned an image of Viṣṇu to be made according to the bodily proportions of his deceased son.\"\n\n----------\n\nSource: Heather Stoddard, “Thang stong Rgyal po, Jesus and the Fifth Dalai Lama,” Archiv Orientalni, vol. 71, no. 3 (2003), pp. 433-440, at p. 434, note 8, based on information from Rdo rje tshe ring.\n\ntho [~mtho] = tip of thumb to tip of index finger.\n\nkhyid [~mkhyid] = knuckle span to the tip of the outstretched thumb.\n\npho dom [~pho 'dom] = from fingertip to fingertip of outstretched arms.\n\nThe marketing weights of both gold and silver:\n\n1 བལ་སྲན་ [bal sran] (today called དམར་རུ་མགོ་ནག་, dmar ru mgo nag, n. of a grass seed) == 1 སེ་བ་ [se ba].\n\n8 སེ་བ་ [se ba] == 1 ཞོ་ [zho].\n\n8 ཞོ་ [zho] == 1 སྲང་ [srang].\n\n1 སྲང་ [srang] gold == 2 སྲང་ [srang] silver\n\n4 སྲང་ [srang] gold == 8 སྲང་ [srang] Tibetan silver == 1 བྲེ་ [bre] silver\n\n16 སྲང་ [srang] gold == 1 བྲེ་ [bre] gold == 2 བྲེ་ [bre] silver\n\n50 སྲང་ [srang] silver == 1 བྲེ་ཆེན་ [bre chen] silver\n\n25 སྲང་ [srang] gold == 1 ཤིང་སྲང་ [shing srang] (a སྲང་ [srang] made of wood).\n\nSource: Francke, Antiquities of Indian Tibet, vol. 2, p. 105, a note by Dr. K.

One zho of gold is the price charged, e.g., for large printed volumes like the Mdo-mang, which may be had at Leh lamasery, printed to order for this price.\" See also Blue Annals, p. 383, which mentions the se ba measurement for gold.\n\nWhat are evidently also later monetary units are explained in Jampel Kaldhen, Interest Rates in Tibet, Tibet Journal 1 no 1 (1975) 109 as follows:\n\n2 1/2 Skar ma [Skar] = 1 Kha-gang.\n\n2 Kha gang = 5 Skar ma.\n\n3 Kha gang = 1 Phyed brgyad\n\n10 Skar ma or 4 Kha gang = 1 Zho gang (Zho).\n\n10 Zho gang = 1 Srang gang (Srang).\n\n50 Srang gang = 1 Rdo tshad (or .Tam-mdo).\n\nAccording to Tsarong in Tibet Journal 23 no 3 (1998) 33, n. 6: 4 kha gang (or 10 skar ma) equals 1 zho gang. 10 zho gang equals 1 srang. 50 srang equals 1 rdo tshad. In Pabongka, Liberation in Our Hands, pt. 1, p. 5, a srang is said to be equiv. to about ten or twenty dollars in modern currency. In pt. 2, p. 83, it says that a kha gang is approximately a penny.\n\nThubten Kunga Chashab, A Study of Religious Expenditure in Tibet in the 19th Century Based on the Biography of Dharmabhadra, Acta Orientalia, vol. 63 (2002), p. 199: Denominations of skar ma, kha, zho, ṭam, ṭam srang, dngul srang, srang, rdo tshad and gser zho (although Kha, rdo tshad and gser zho are rarely mentioned).

(according to Pabongka, Liberation in Our Hands, pt. 1, p. 170, it is about a quart).\n\n20 མཁར་བྲེ་ [mkhar bre or bre] == 1 མཁར་ཁལ་ [mkhar khal or khal]. According to Rebecca French, a khal is the same as a 'bo[1] (a wooden box approximately 10 by 10 by 6 inches, said to weigh approximately 30 pounds).\n\nAccording to Lobsang Gyatso, Memoirs of a Tibetan Lama, p. 206: \"The grain was measured in a big, square, measuring bucket called a bo ['bo]. There were nineteen buckets to a load (khel [i.e. khal]) so a bucket was about fifteen kilos worth of grain. When you were measuring the grain, specific conventions governed allowable and forbidden leveling-off techniques.\"\n\nAccording to Thubten Kunga Chashab, “A Study of Religious Expenditure in Tibet in the 19th Century Based on the Biography of Dharmabhadra,” Acta Orientalia, vol. 63 (2002), p. 201, citing Tshering the weight standards for such commodities as barley, butter and flour:\n\nOne khal weighs 3.34 kg. while\n\none nya ga weighs 167 grams.\n\nChashab also cites Goldstein's different opinion.\n\nDungkar Rinpoche says: This is taken from commentaries written in those times on vinaya and medical texts, and represents a great advance on the method of measuring in handfuls in the time of Khri-srong-lde-btsan. (Additional interpretations from R. French, The Golden Yoke, p. 230.) There is a confusing explanation in Blue Annals, p. 402, \"Mes tshon po presented him with several lumps of pigment and brown sugar with which one could cover a field which could be sown with one zho (1 zho = 1/10 of a 'bre) of seeds, and requested to be initiated.\"\n\n* * *\n\nButter (and medicinal) market measures:\n\n1 ཁམ་ཚིག་ [kham tshig, apricot kernel?] == 2 large + 2 medium + 2 small barley corns == 1 སེ་བ་ [se ba, rose hip?].\n\n20 སེ་བ་ [se ba] == 1 ཞོ་ [zho]\n\n10 ཞོ་ [zho] == 1 སྲང་ [srang] or 1 སྤོར་ [spor]\n\n4 སྲང་ [srang] or 4 སྤོར་ [spor] == 1 ཉག་ [nyag or nya ga]\n\n5 ཉག་ [nyag] == 1 ཁྱོར་བ་ [khyor ba]\n\n4 ཁྱོར་བ་ [khyor ba] == 20 ཉག་ [nyag] == 1 ཁལ་ [khal]\n\nAccording to Tsarong in Tibet Journal 23 no 3 (1998) 33, n. 6: 20 gnya' ga of butter equals 1 khal. 12 khal equals one mar tang (approximately 40 kilograms).\n\nIn biography of 'Jig rten mgon po, as found in Lho-rong Chos-'byung, p. 355, it says that he had purchased a horse for 7 zho of brown sugar and offered it to the monastic community (sngar gyi rta de'i rin bu ram zho bdun lon pa dge 'dun la phul).\n\nAccording to Precious Deposits V 102, one zho is about 5 grams, one nya ga (nyag) is 200 grams.\n\nThubten Kunga Chashab, A Study of Religious Expenditure in Tibet in the 19th Century Based on the Biography of Dharmabhadra, Acta Orientalia, vol. 63 (2002), p. 201: The exchange rate between grain and money in the 1860's was 1 khal grain to 3 zho and 1 1/2 khal butter to 1 srang, but in another source a different exchange rate is given: 1 khal and 10 nya ga [i.e., 1 1/2 khal] of butter was worth 1 srang and 5 ṭam. The government exchange rate for barley was 1 ṭam per khal (he's following Tsarong 1998 here).\n\n* * *\n\nLand measurement:\n\nSource: Sumner Carnahan, In The Presence of My Enemies (1995), p. 15: \"A don is a measure of land equivalent to two kang; each kang is equivalent to sixty rukhay. One rukhay amounts to the quantity of land that can be sown with a single bushel of barley.\" p. 16: \"Generally, one don was equal to the amount of land that can be sown with 120 bushels of barley. But in the lower central valley, in the Lhasa region — which was much more fertile — a different system was used.\"\n\nSource: Sarat Chandra Das, Journey to Lhasa & Central Tibet, p. 86: \"The ordinary kang is a measure of land in which about 400 lbs of seed-grain can be sown. The State tax on each kang is 50 srang (or ounces of silver) a year.\"\n\nSee 3-vol. dictionary under the word 'don, where it says that it is a basis for taxation, varying in size from place to place. A large 'don could be as much as could be seeded with over 100 khal of barley. A small 'don could be as little as what could be seeded with 20 or 30 khal.

The Kālacakra and Trika Tantric systems share this rather curious and interesting system of time calculation that, while familiar to Indian astrologers and astronomers, is not commonly known about by modern scholars, even though it apparently derives from a Babylonian system. During the course of 60 years, there are considered to be 21,600 days, since the ideal year for the Indian calendars was 360 days (60 x 360 = 21,600). In a built-in system of macro-microcosmic mapking, it was also considered that a human being takes 21,600 breaths— consisting of an inhalation & exhalation—during the course of one 24-hour day. It turns out that a full prāna (inhalation & exhalation, prāna + upāna) lasts four seconds. ... this temporal unit of a four-second prāna ... goes back to practices of breath control used for chanting the Vedic mantras...\n\nThe 24-minute hour was called ghaṭikā, one 60th of a day.\n\n***\n\nNumbers (low numbers and numeric codes):\n\nWord-symbols used in place of numbers found in back of Bod Rgya Shan-sbyar-gyi Shes-bya'i Rnam-grangs Kun-btus Tshig-mdzod:\n\n0. mkha. thig. stong pa.\n\n1. gzugs. zla.

It says it is based on the Vaiḍūrya Dkar po.\n\nThe following (he makes reference to the collection of synonyms by Dpal-khang Lo-tsā-ba) are from Per Kværne, 'Chronology', p. 220, note. 11:\n\n11. drag po.\n\n12. nyi, nyi ma.\n\n13. 'dod, 'dod pa.\n\n14. yid.\n\n15. tshes.\n\n16. rgyal po.\n\nThe following based on the Chandoratnākara by Ratnākaraśānti (according to Michael Hahn, “Sanskrit Metrics as Studied at Buddhist Universities,” Adyar Library Bulletin, vol. 52 (1988), pp. 34-35):\n\n1. rūpa.\n\n2. yama.\n\n3. agni (also, dahana).\n\n4. veda, abdhi (also, udadhi, samudra, salilanidhi).\n\n5. śara, indriya, viṣaya (also, akṣa, iṣu, karaṇa).\n\n6. ṛtu, rasa (also, svāda).\n\n7. loka, aśva, muni (Tib. version adds svara; also, turaga, haya).\n\n8. vasu, aṅga, madana.\n\n9. randhra, graha (also, kha).\n\n10. diś (also, āśā).\n\n11. rudra (also, hara).\n\n12. arka (also uṣṇagu, taraṇi, ravi).\n\n13. bhuvana.\n\n14. manu.\n\nSource: S. Lienhard, “Life & Religious Belief as Reflected in Nepalese Folksongs,” Studia Asiatica, vol. 3 (2002) 11-18, at p, 18:\n\nNewars use symbolic words/encodements for numbers in dating their songs (the order is right-to-left).\n\nforest = 5.\n\nelephant = 8.\n\njewel = 9.\n\n--------------\n\nThis list of gambling numbers in the language of the Ma-sang[s] is from N.Norbu, Drung De'u & Bön, p. 15, and the added note. The real spellings are given second, if they differ. (Since two dice are used, the minimum possible result is '2', so there is no '1')\n\n2. para. pa ra.\n\n3. sug.\n\n4. dzig.\n\n5. kha.\n\n6. ndrug. 'brug.\n\n7. ri.\n\n8. sha.\n\n10. chu.\n\n11. thog, thoge. thog. tho ge.\n\n12. njam. 'jam. OR chala. ca la.\n\nOther source for dicing numbers, see TS7 II 1056: par ra, sug, tshigs (zing, zig, tsig), kha, drug (lug), rig (ri, tig, ting), sha (skya), dgu (sgug), chu, rdog (thog), 'jang.\n\nHigh Numbers\n\nOne source for the following high numbers is: Mchims 'Jam-pa'i-dbyangs, Mdzod 'Grel Mngon-pa'i Rgyan, Khrung-go Bod-kyi Shes-rig Dpe-skrun-khang (Beijing 1989), p. 328.\n\nThere is a very important discussion in the Pruden tr. of the Abhidharmakośa, vol. 2, pp. 543-544 (note no. 507). It appears that Vasubandhu already recognized that there were 8 missing numbers in the list of 60.\n\nAnother source is Anton Schiefner, Über die hohen Zahlen der Buddhisten, Mélanges Asiatiques [St. Petersburg], vol. 4 (1862), pp. 629-648 (have xerox of copy in Kern Institute library).\n\nThe 60th 'place' in the number system is that called Grangs-med, and this is the one that measures the amount of time in the phrase Grangs-med gsum (3 'limitless' Kalpas).\n\nAnother interesting source for high numbers is the Mdzod-phug comm. by Sga-ston, p. 225. This Bon source has a complete list of 60.\n\nHigh numbers (source is Bu-ston, Collected Works, vol. 24, pp. 726-7):\n\nAs Bu-ston notes, there seem to be 8 missing (since the total is supposed to be 60 ending with grangs med pa). Mchims seems to have a similar problem. Mchims suggests adding 8 more 'places' before the last 'place', Grangs med (anywhere you like after the Dung phyur!). This suggests how little practical value Mchims, unlike modern astrophysicists, placed on high numbers.\n\nAnother longer list of high numbers, as given in the Avatamsaka Sutra, is found in the Mahāvyutpatti. nos. 7697-7820.\n\n------------------------------------\n\nNotes, links and bibliography to end with:\n\nFor more on the symbolic number-words, see now\n\nEdward Henning, “Symbolic numbers in Kālacakra literature”\n\nFor an excellent discussion of Tibetan measurements in German (and nicely illustrated), seethis essay entitled, “Tibetische Maßeinheiten.”\n\nFor mathematics, see yet other works of Dieter Schuh.\n\nFollowing are a couple of old but still interesting writings on the subjects of measurements and numbers.\n\nDECOURDEMANCHE, J.A., Traité des monnaies, mesures et poids anciens et modernes de l'Inde et de la Chine (P.
