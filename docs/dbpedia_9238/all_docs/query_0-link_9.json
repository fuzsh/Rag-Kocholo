        "text": "Tibet (Tibetan: བོད) ་is a country in East Asia. Though having formally declared its independence from the Chinese Empire during the Xinhai Revolution, it is not recognized by any other country, though it is usually treated as de facto independent by foreign powers. It borders the Yunnan Clique and Burma to the southeast, the Sichuan Clique to the east, the Ma Clique to the northeast, the Xinjiang Clique to the northwest, and India, Nepal, and Bhutan to the south.\n\nHistory[]\n\nAn ancient kingdom stretching back to the time of Songtsen Gampo in the 7th century, the Tibetan kingdom regained its independence following the collapse of the Qing Dynasty and the onset of the Warlord Era. In 1913, the 13th Dalai Lama returned to Lhasa from exile in Mongolia and declared his nation independent from China. The Dalai Lama greatly reformed Tibet, building hospitals and schools, reorganizing the government to discourage political corruption, expanding the military, abolishing the death penalty, and allowing (relatively) free movement in and out of the country. Following the collapse of the British Raj, his foreign outreach became restricted, as the new Indian republic was less cordial towards the Tibetan theocracy.\n\nIn the chaos caused by the Sikh Rebellion of 1925, Tibetan forces led by Tsarong Dzasa seized control of the Tibetan-speaking area of Ladakh in eastern Kashmir. In 1930, Thubten Kunphlea led an army through Kham, taking control over areas weakly occupied by the Sichuan Clique. In response, the Ma Clique invaded Amdo in 1931. While the Tibetans were able to occupy all the territory up to the Yalong River on the edge of the Tibetan Plateau, their offensive in Amdo against the Ma faltered, and they were eventually pushed back out of the region entirely. Yushu and Golmud were occupied, but a lucky victory near the town of Qamdo prevented Ma forces from occupying Kham. A ceasefire was soon signed, but border raids continued to be conducted by both sides along the mountainous border, as neither side could agree on where exactly the border between the two states was to be drawn.\n\nIn 1933, the 13th Dalai Lama was suddenly struck by a fatal illness. Before dying he made this prophecy:\n\n“Very soon in this land deceptive acts may occur from without and within. At that time, if we do not dare to protect our territory, our spiritual personalities including the Victorious Father and Son may be exterminated without trace, the property and authority of our Lakangs and monks may be taken away. Moreover, our political system, developed by the Three Great Dharma Kings will collapse into strife and chaos disrupting the peace that has kept us safe. The lives of all people, high and low, will be changed forever and the people will turn on one another and fight.. All living beings will have to endure endless days of suffering and will be stricken with fear. Such a time will come.”\n\nThough the 5th Reting Rinpoche was immediately appointed regent, a power struggle soon broke out among the leaders of the Ganden Phodrang. Thubten Kunphela, high-ranking administrator and commander of the elite Trongdra Regiment, was accused by his political rival Tsipön Lungshar of murdering the late Dalai Lama. Kunphela’s enemies convinced the regiment to mutiny and he was arrested and brought to trial. The charge of murder was dropped and Kunphela was convicted of merely failing to notify the Kashag of the Dalai Lama’s illness. Nonetheless, Kunphela’s property was confiscated and he was forced into exile, fleeing to Kalimpong in India and reconnecting with his old friend, the similarly-exiled 9th Panchen Lama.\n\nLungshar petitioned the Kashag for wide-ranging government reform, earning the ire of the traditionalist politician Trimön Shap-pe. Trimön framed Lungshar for a supposed socialist revolutionary plot and had him imprisoned, tortured, and blinded. With Lungshar supporters driven underground, most reformist activity was effectively outlawed, and Trimön consolidated his position thanks to his control of the Reting Rinpoche.\n\nPolitics[]\n\nThe Kingdom of Tibet is a theocratic monarchy. The traditional head of state is the Dalai Lama, who is recognized as the spiritual leader of all Tibetan Buddhists. He is believed to be a reincarnation of Avalokiteśvara, and as such, the new reincarnation must be sought out each time after the previous Dalai Lama has died. In the interim, the kingdom is ruled by a regent, currently the 5th Reting Rinpoche.\n\nThe actual government of the country is known as the Ganden Phodrang, a group of bodies that draw membership from the traditional monastic orders. The great exception to this is the Kashag, a four-member “cabinet” of sorts that is staffed mostly by laypeople. Being an autocratic government, Tibet does not have political parties per se, but there does exist four major factions:\n\nThe Traditionalists are led by the general Trimön, a close friend of the Reting Rinpoche, and currently hold effective power through control of the Kashag. They tend to champion Tibet’s traditional system of governance and reject all but the most incremental of reforms.\n\nYoung Tibet is the only remaining legal opposition, led by the diplomat and statesman Tsarong Dzasa. They desire to open up the nation on the world stage, import technology, and modernize the military and bureaucracy so that Tibet does not fall behind (and becomes vulnerable to) its neighbors.\n\nKyicho Kuntun (“Union of Happiness”) is a political society founded by Tsipon Lunghar advocating a radical reformation of Tibet’s government. It was widely popular, especially among lay officials, but was pushed underground after Lungshar’s imprisonment.\n\nThe Tibet Improvement Party was founded by Tibetan exiles living in India, principally Thubten Kunphela, Pandatsang Rapga, and Gendün Chöphel. It is a nationalist, secularist, and anti-feudal movement heavily influenced by the Kuomintang and Sun Yat-sen’s Three Principles of the People.\n\nMilitary[]\n\nThe Tibetan Army was founded in 1912 after the country’s declaration of independence from the Qing Empire. In the early years, it received training and equipment from the British. As China slid into the Warlord Era, the Tibetan Army attempted to exert influence over Kham, which was inhabited by ethnic Tibetans, to limited success. The standing army is supplemented by the Dob-dobs, bands of warrior monks who comprise the internal security and police force for most of the country, though they are not controlled directly by the central government and tend to be reactionary in character.\n\nForeign Relations[]\n\nThough Tibet declared independence from China in 1912, it is not recognized as an independent state by any other country in the world except for Mongolia, with which it has warm relations. This status complicates its relationship with the Qing Empire and its various warlord cliques, though the Chinese have not had the means to assert any kind of control over Tibet for decades. The borders between Tibet and its neighbors are ill-defined and result in periodic clashes, particularly with the forces of the Ma Clique, which currently occupies the Tibetan-claimed town of Yushu.\n\nEconomy[]\n\nTibet has a primitive economy composed mostly of subsistence farming and pastoralism. Because of the Tibetan Plateau’s mountainous geography, there is very little arable land, most of which is owned by the monasteries. Possibilities for mineral extraction or hydroelectricity remain distant as the country is only barely industrialized.\n\nCulture[]\n\nTibet is known worldwide for its Buddhist monasteries, some of them very remote, which contain a great wealth of art and literature. The monasteries are also the basic unit of Tibetan society, for they still maintain a great deal of autonomy from the central government, being able to collect taxes and raise private armies. Most of the Tibetan peasants are serfs tied to monastic lands."
