        "text": "1. Introduction\n\nIn the neuroscience field, increasing data-sharing initiatives have accelerated the use of neuroimaging data to study brain disorders in the clinic (Poline et al., 2012, Poldrack and Gorgolewski, 2014, Woo et al., 2017). Access to multi-site datasets affords unprecedented opportunities to perform large-scale analysis across disorders. Brain functional connectivity and other related measures derived from functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data are powerful for characterizing brain organization and its abnormalities in brain disorders. Mounting evidence has supported that functional connectivity is a reliable indicator of brain disorders for early diagnosis and treatments (Liu et al., 2008, Whitfield-Gabrieli et al., 2009, Li et al., 2020). Many approaches have been utilized to capture neuroimaging features informative of functional connectivity, including region of interest (ROI) or seed derived connectivity analysis (Tzourio-Mazoyer et al., 2002, Dosenbach et al., 2010), decomposition-based independent component analysis (ICA) (Calhoun et al., 2001, McKeown et al., 2003, Calhoun and Adali, 2012), self-activation detection method such as amplitude of low frequency fluctuation and regional homogeneity (Zang et al., 2004), as well as clustering techniques to group brain voxels (Du et al., 2012). ROI analysis and ICA are two commonly used strategies for studying functional connectivity. While ROI-based methods typically require fixed brain regions according to prior experience or knowledge (e.g. atlas), ICA, a data-driven method, is capable of capturing functional networks while retaining more single-subject variability (Yu et al., 2017). ICA leverages the hidden spatial–temporal information to extract spatially independent components (ICs), each of which includes brain voxels sharing co-varying patterns. In addition, ICA performs component extraction and noise component removal simultaneously (Du et al., 2016), which might provide better signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) level for the functional connectivity estimation. ICA also enables separation of overlapping but distinct functional activity (Xu et al., 2015), which cannot be achieved by using atlas-based analysis. To overcome the limitation of ICA that components from different subjects might not have spatial correspondence, group ICA methods were developed (Calhoun et al., 2001, Beckmann et al., 2009, Du and Fan, 2013, Calhoun and de Lacy, 2017), which perform ICA on the group data to estimate the group-level components, and then utilize a back-reconstruction strategy to extract individual-level functional networks and associated time-courses.\n\nHowever, there is still a big challenge on group ICA that the identified components might vary across different group ICA runs due to the difference of the data properties, affecting its ability to replicate and compare findings across different studies. For example, Allen et al. (Allen et al., 2014) identified 50 intrinsic connectivity networks (ICNs) arranged into seven functional domains, while Marusak, Calhoun et al. (2017) characterized 52 ICNs sorted to three domains, despite they implemented the same model order in the group ICA. Such discrepancy hinders the direct comparisons across the results. Another potential problem of group ICA is that conventional ICA-based classification studies typically performed group ICA on all subjects’ fMRI data to make the resulting features consistent across training and testing sets (Demirci et al., 2008, Rashid et al., 2016). However, this operation can be biased, as the feature extraction should be independent from the testing data. Accordingly, it is essential to adopt an ICA approach to estimate brain network measures in an unbiased way that fully persist individual property while also being able to be compared across subjects from various datasets/studies/disorders.\n\nFrom a clinical perspective, it is very important to evaluate sensitivity and specificity as well as similarity and overlap between disorders that share clinically-overlapping symptoms using neuroimaging data. For example, both schizoaffective and bipolar disorders experience hallucinations and delusions that are typical features of schizophrenia (SZ) (Cosgrove and Suppes, 2013), which can make their clinical differentiation difficult. As such, it would be beneficial to study the shared and unique brain impairments among them for better diagnosis and accurate treatments. Unfortunately, there is a paucity of studies that perform a direct comparison of symptom-related disorders and the validation of brain changes using large-sample datasets, probably due to the limited ability of analytic methods to characterize individual variability (Zuo et al., 2014) and reliability (Noble et al., 2019). Furthermore, since the traditional diagnosis relying on symptom assessment could be imperfect, it may be promising to develop new biologically-based types across the psychotic illnesses by combining the use of neuroimage-derived features (Marquand et al., 2016). Taking SZ and autism spectrum disorder (ASD) into account, although they are conceptualized as distinct illnesses, they have also been revisited in recent years due to their shared phenotypic and genotypic expression (Hommer and Swedo, 2015). There have been studies that explore subtypes for mental disorders such as schizophrenia by performing clustering techniques on neuroimage-derived features (Yang et al., 2014, Sun et al., 2015, Dwyer et al., 2018, Honnorat et al., 2019, Chand et al., 2020). Hence, effective methods that can accurately capture biologically meaningful subject-specific features that are still comparable across different individuals will benefit the refinement of current disorder categories. As more neuroimaging data are now available than ever before, ICA based method has a great potential to study the shared and unique brain network abnormalities across brain disorders. But the traditional ICA methods cannot be implemented directly on multiple datasets due to the inconsistency of IC estimations and arrangements across different ICA runs, which greatly influence the ability for comparing and validating the brain changes among disorders. Therefore, there is a need for advanced ICA techniques that can accurately estimate subject-specific network features representing interpretable biomarkers and achieve corresponding network features to accelerate the evaluation of biomarkers in terms of their generalizability, reproducibility and relationship to other data.\n\nIn this study, we propose a pipeline called NeuroMark, which leverages an adaptive-ICA technique such as group information guided ICA (GIG-ICA) (Du and Fan, 2013) or spatially constrained ICA (Lin et al., 2010) to fully automate the estimation and labeling of individual-subject connectivity features, by incorporating an additional input of spatial network priors derived from independent large samples. We implemented the NeuroMark pipeline to four studies involving six brain disorders and >2400 subject samples, in order to validate its performance from different aspects. We expected that replicable brain changes in patients with certain mental disorder can be found on independent datasets. We were interested in the cross-study comparison to link related mental disorders using NeuroMark. We also hoped that NeuroMark is able to extract subtle group difference across progressively developing disorders. Another concern was its ability in capturing effective biomarkers for the classification on challengeable brain disorders.\n\n4. Discussion\n\nThe current diagnosis of brain disorders overwhelmingly relies on the patterns of clinical symptoms. Neuroimaging measures may hold more objective, biology-based quantification of brain abnormalities and consequently serve as potential biomarkers to guide diagnosis and treatment. However, the human brain is highly complex and the neuroimaging signals are confounded by various noises. This requires the neuroscience community to analyze big-data samples that might be assembled from multi-site studies to achieve enough statistical power for capturing more reliable findings. Studying the brain alterations in multiple brain disorders via using neuroimaging data collected from different studies would advance our understanding of their underlying mechanisms and relationships, which might help to redefine the disorder categories or develop new subtypes (Marquand et al., 2016, Du et al., 2018).\n\nFunctional connectivity, which evaluates the interaction of spatially distributed brain regions, has been suggested to be associated with cognition and many mental activities (Bressler and Menon, 2010). Studies of functional connectivity also improve the understanding of functional alterations caused by brain disorders (Sheline et al., 2009, Öngür et al., 2010, Xia et al., 2019). ICA is a promising method that can be used to extract functional connectivity measures (Calhoun et al., 2001, Allen et al., 2014), like intra-network connectivity (spatial maps of ICNs) and inter-network connectivity (functional network connectivity). Compared with ROI-based analysis, ICA is capable of extracting functional connectivity features that retain more individual-level variability (Yu et al., 2017), which might provide more statistical power benefiting the analysis of cross-disorders brain abnormalities. However, ICA is a data-driven approach which might result in different components identified across data. Such inconsistency of identified components and their arrangements may hinder finding replication and cross-study comparison.\n\nTo address this issue, we proposed the NeuroMark pipeline, a priori-driven ICA informed by reliable network templates to achieve linked analyses among different datasets, studies, and disorders. In this pipeline, the network templates were first generated using two large-sample HC populations (including 1828 subjects) in order to automatically maintain inter-subject correspondence of networks. The use of such prior information can greatly reduce the search space and improve the likelihood of detecting useful biomarkers (Cohen et al., 2017). Then, subject-specific ICNs and TCs were estimated based on the network templates, and this procedure would not only maintain the correspondence of extracted networks but also achieve more individual variances by optimizing the subject-specific network independence (Lin et al., 2010, Du and Fan, 2013).\n\nTo assess the efficacy of NeuroMark, we performed four studies including six different brain disorders. The performance of NeuroMark was evaluated from different angles. The overall results clearly support that NeuroMark is capable of capturing functional connectivity abnormalities that can be replicated across datasets and can be compared across brain disorders. NeuroMark also shows promising ability in characterizing atypical dynamic functional connectivity features across progressively developing disorders. More importantly, the functional connectivity features extracted by NeuroMark can serve as reliable biomarkers that can be used for the classification of brain disorders.\n\nIn study 1, by using the NeuroMark pipeline, we explored the whole-brain sFNC abnormalities in two independent SZ datasets. Similar abnormalities in sFNC were observed across datasets, mainly involving the subcortical, sensory, and cerebellar networks. Specifically, SZ shows increased sFNC between subcortical networks (including thalamus and caudate) and sensory networks. Being validated across datasets, these findings are consistent with and significantly extend previous reports about hyperconnectivity between subcortical and sensory regions using both atlas-based and ICA approaches (Woodward et al., 2012, Anticevic et al., 2014, Damaraju et al., 2014a, Damaraju et al., 2014b, Fu et al., 2018a, Fu et al., 2018b). For example, Woodward et al. have shown that SZ exhibits increased connectivity between thalamus and somatosensory regions by evaluating the connectivity between thalamic region and the other cortical regions (Woodward et al., 2012). Chen et al. (2019) revealed that thalamic hyperconnectivity with sensorimotor areas is related to the severity of cognitive deficits and clinical symptoms in SZ. Studies using ICA also reveal that increased strengths of FNC between subcortical and sensory networks in SZ patients from both static and dynamic perspectives (Damaraju et al., 2014a, Damaraju et al., 2014b). The subcortical regions are important sensory gates that receive and deliver information to the cortical regions, supporting the basic brain functions and behaviors. The thalamus is known for its important roles in visual, auditory, motor activity, emotion, memory, and sensorimotor association functions, and the caudate nucleus integrates spatial information with motor behavior formulation. Considering the negative functional connectivity between subcortical and sensory regions in our results, our observed increased sFNC in SZ might indicate dysfunctional connectivity between those regions. Such disconnection between subcortical and sensory regions would influence the information flow in the SZ brain, which might further result in cognitive deficits and other clinical symptoms in SZ. We observed replicated decreased sFNC between subcortical networks and cerebellum, which are also in line with previous findings (Andreasen et al., 1998, Anticevic et al., 2014). Using a large sample of SZ patients, Anticevic et al. found hypoconnectivity between the thalamus and cerebellar regions in patients (Anticevic et al., 2014). Although cerebellum has been previously viewed as a key node of motor coordination, more and more documents show that it would participate in a broad range of cognitive functions in humans (Buckner, 2013). Recent studies using large-scale neuroimaging data have documented the potential associations between the structure and function of the cerebellum and schizophrenia (Cao and Cannon, 2019). Our results provide additional evidence supporting that the cerebellar dysfunction, especially the dysfunction in cortical-subcortical-cerebellar circuitry involved in the pathogenesis of schizophrenia (Cao and Cannon, 2019). Overall, the results of study 1 highlight the potential of NeuroMark as a tool for capturing reproducible connectivity changes.\n\nIn study 2, the NeuroMark pipeline was applied to an open source data for studying the sFNC abnormalities in ASD. With the help of NeuroMark, the extracted ICNs not only retained subject-specific variability but also had the same order and arrangement as that in the study 1, making it feasible to compare the results from two independent studies. Combining their results, we found that subcortical networks were significantly affected by both SZ and ASD. Similar to SZ, decreased sFNC between cerebellum and thalamus/caudate and increased sFNC between thalamus and superior temporal gyrus/postcentral gyrus were identified in ASD. One previous study (Cerliani et al., 2015) using ICA-based fMRI analysis also showed increased connectivity between networks encompassing thalamus with the sensorimotor networks in ASD. Indeed, the disruption of subcortical-cortical brain connectivity, especially between thalamic and sensory regions has been widely documented in literature (Minshew and Keller, 2010, Fu et al., 2019). The broken connection between thalamus and the cortical regions is suggested to a potential cause of the atypical sensory processing in ASD (Fu et al., 2019). Our results indicate that atypical thalamic-to-cortical connectivity in SZ and ASD might underlie the same impairments of cerebello-thalamo-cortical pathways in both diseases (Andreasen et al., 1998, Bailey et al., 1998). While our findings are consistent with previous work, this paper directly shows, for the first time, the overlap between SZ and ASD with respect to these changes. Besides those common sFNC abnormalities, we found that ASD also showed unique changes on sFNC involving the cognitive-control and default mode domains. Our results are in line with the abnormal functional connectivity which is observed both within the DMN and between the DMN and networks involved in higher cognitive processing (de Lacy et al., 2017). Another dynamic functional connectivity study found that children with ASD diagnoses spend less time in the dynamic state with strong DMN connectivity, which might result in overall decreased DMN connectivity, aligned with our findings (Rashid et al., 2018). SZ and ASD are currently conceptualized as distinct disorders, however there is overlap in symptoms such as social withdrawal and communication impairment (Ford et al., 2017). Historically, schizophrenia and autism were even once considered to be the same disorder expressed at different developmental periods. The exploration of common and unique brain changes in SZ and ASD using a standardized pipeline like NeuroMark would help to advance our understanding of the neuronal relationship between these clinically-overlapping diseases and provide biological evidence hinting at their possible underlying mechanisms.\n\nThe human brain is highly dynamic system that spontaneous brain activity and connectivity is rich with dynamic properties (Leonardi and Van De Ville, 2015). Increasing evidence has shown that the research into dynamic functional connectivity would provide more information on brain functions and organization that cannot be probed by its static counterpart (Chang and Glover, 2010). The study of dynamic functional connectivity also improves the understanding of impaired brain and the functional alterations caused by brain disorders (Du et al., 2016). In study 3, we tested the performance of NeuroMark on capturing dynamic functional connectivity features from large scale imaging data. Via the NeuroMark framework, the atypical dFNCs were studied on brain disorders which manifest symptom severity along a continuous spectrum (MCI to AD). Five states with highly variable connectivity patterns were identified, demonstrating the flexibility in the functional coordination between brain networks during the resting state. Compared to HCs, AD patients exhibited more occurrence in weakly-connected states but fewer occurrence in strongly-connected states, consistent with our previous findings observed from another independent data (Fu et al., 2019). We speculate that the increased occurrence in the weakly-connected states but decreased occurrence in the strongly-connected states would result in disrupted inter-region communication which influences the maintenance of the basic brain functions in dementia brain. Similar observations were found in other brain disorders, including bipolar disorder (Rashid et al., 2014), schizophrenia (Damaraju et al., 2014a, Damaraju et al., 2014b, Du et al., 2016b), and autism (Fu et al., 2018a, Fu et al., 2018b). Interestingly, we observed that MCI showed similar changing trends as AD, with a weaker degree than AD. MCI is suggested to be an intermediate stage between HC and AD and our results demonstrate that the biological changes in MCI also show an intermediate condition between HC and AD. We further divided the MCI group into EMCI and LMCI, such phenomenon can also be observed in the dynamic features from HC to EMCI to LMCI to AD, suggesting a continual change in neurodegenerative diseases. The converging results of study 3 show that NeuroMark is an effective framework that can capture subtle dFNC differences that help to characterize progression in cognitive impairment in dementia.\n\nIn study 4, we tested whether the functional connectivity features captured by NeuroMark can serve as reliable biomarkers that help to distinguish different disease groups. The spatial maps of the ICNs extracted via NeuroMark were used as the input in the classification of BD and MDD patients, who have highly overlapping depressive symptoms and usually are difficult to be separated in clinical practice. We achieved >90% overall accuracy and balance accuracy, which are comparable with previous work that tried to distinguish BD and MDD (Jie et al., 2015, Osuch et al., 2018). However, Osuch et al. performed component decomposition using all the MDD and BD data, which makes them difficult to extend their findings on the new coming subjects or on another independent data. Our results suggest that although the use of functional network features and sophisticated classification algorithms is not practical in routine clinical due to the difficulty to implement the approaches to the new coming data, the NeuroMark framework might help to overcome this. Our results also indicate that the most important regions that help to discriminate BD and MDD are middle temporal gyrus, insula, precuneus, putamen, superior parietal gyrus, and inferior occipital gyrus. The abnormalities in these regions have been widely reported in MDD (Wang et al., 2012, Peng et al., 2015, Schreiner et al., 2019) or BD (Favre et al., 2014) literature. Our results argue that although these regions shows atypical patterns in both MDD and BD, their abnormalities may pertain to the different pathophysiology of mood disorders and may be particularly helpful for separating patients with challenging mood diagnoses.\n\nAlthough NeuroMark shows great promise on extracting comparable and reproducible functional connectivity abnormalities that can serve as valuable markers across brain disorders, one limitation is that the present network templates were obtained only based on two independent HC datasets. The templates can be progressively improved and refined as more datasets collected under different conditions are included, hopefully to generate functional network templates with greater reproducibility. Since matching group-level networks across multiple groups is difficult, an efficient matching technique will be needed in order to find the highly reproducible (matched) networks as templates. In addition, the network templates were estimated using a higher model-order (the number of ICs = 100). In future, we will explore network estimation at different parcellation levels. Considering the ability to link different datasets, studies, and disorders in our method, we also plan to provide a cloud computation platform that implements this approach. Our hope is that by using NeuroMark, functional connectivity features can be widely studied and compared among numerous brain disorders. In this paper, we did not compare the NeuroMark with other pipelines (such as other group ICA and ROI methods) in the four studies, because we are more interested in the application of the proposed pipeline in a broad range. However, our previous studies (Du and Fan, 2013, Du et al., 2016a, Salman et al., 2019) have shown the superiority of the core of NeuroMark (i.e. GIG-ICA) in its powerful capability of estimating individual networks. In this work, we validated that the unique property of network features can be captured in NeuroMark while the correspondence between the network templates and individual ICNs is well maintained. We also found that the template-ICN similarity is relatively stable across different datasets and populations (as shown in the section 3.2). Furthermore, we also investigated the correlation between the network templates and the subject-specific ICNs across groups with different age and head motion parameters. As shown in the supplementary section S4, our results indicate that age and head motion did not greatly influence the correspondence measure. We wanted to point out that in this work we carefully regressed out the age, gender, and site effects before the statistical analyses (see the section S3) and handled the motion in the preprocessing and FNC computation steps, which minimized the contamination of these effects on the group differences.\n\nWe also wanted to mention that in this paper we identified the group differences under the guidance of diagnosis labels in studies 1–3 and classifying different subjects using models and features obtained by believing in the class labels in study 4. Our work accords with most of previous studies in the neuroscience field (Du et al., 2018), however, it is obvious that the diagnosis labels could be inaccurate. Refining mental disorder categories with the help of neuroimaging technique has attracted a lot of interests (Insel et al., 2010, Cuthbert and Insel, 2013, Fusar‐Poli et al., 2019), and unsupervised or semi-supervised clustering is the mostly popular method to solve the regrouping problem (Marquand et al., 2016). The biggest difficulty is to select good measures which can reflect subject-unique characteristics while still be corresponding across subjects for being used as features in clustering, under the situation of lack of group label information. We believe that NeuroMark helps to facilitate this issue, as our studies support that subtle data variation can be captured and linking of data can be easily achieved by NeuroMark.\n\nAlthough the current NeuroMark framework was only applied for the analysis of fMRI datasets, it can also be expanded to other modalities. Taking structural MRI for example, source-based morphometry (SBM) (Xu et al., 2009, Bergsland et al., 2018), a multivariate version of voxel-based morphometry (VBM), applies ICA to gray matter maps to detect common covariation among subjects and subject-associated weights. It is apparent that results of SBM vary across different datasets and runs. Using our method taking reliable priors as guidance, the covariation patterns can be linked, thus resulting in comparable weights as features across different data (see regression based example here (Silva et al., 2014)). Group ICA is also useful for analyzing electroencephalography (EEG) data. Previous studies (Huster et al., 2015, Huster and Raud, 2018) extracted EEG sources by concatenating the data across the spatial dimension (see also the EEGIFT software: http://trendscenter.org/software). Generating a priori sources to guide the individual source computation in different modalities will be an ongoing effort.\n\nIn summary, we proposed an ICA-based framework to generalize and standardize the calculation of possible functional connectivity features that leverages the benefits of a data-driven approach and also provides comparability across multiple analyses. Via four different example studies, we highlight the validity of this framework. We hope this will be a useful stepping stone towards eventual application of such approaches in the clinic."
