        "text": "Mnova will allow the user to customize nearly all the attributes of the spectrum.\n\nThe user can select the properties of the spectrum by following the menu 'Edit/Properties' or by double clicking the left mouse button or pressing the right mouse button on the spectrum display and selecting 'Properties' from the pop-up menu.\n\nThe user will be able to save his/her own properties just by clicking on the Save Properties' icon\n\n. The Saved Properties will be opened by clicking on the 'Load Properties' icon .\n\nIt is also possible to set the current properties as default by clicking on the 'Set as Default' button. Clicking on the 'Restore' button, will restore the predefined properties.\n\nFrom this set of tabbed pages you can change, for instance, the spectrum's geometry (position, angle, size), the 'Background', the 'Line-Style' (line, crosses or circles), the 'Line Colour' and the 'Line Width'. Bear in mind that a 'Line Width' of zero indicates a cosmetic pen. This means that the pen width is always drawn one pixel wide, independent of the transformation set on the painter. In 2D NMR spectra, you can set the legend, the number of contours and customize the palette. The user can also set the scales' properties, change the grids, the aspect of the axes and margins or the units (ppm, Hz, points, seconds), for a more convenient representation of the spectrum. It is also possible to easily change the color of the spectrum background to suit your eyesight, your working hours, or your mood. Enjoy complete freedom on how to present your data! Transparency is also supported! Here you can see an example:\n\nThe user will be able to select the desired 2D spectrum palette and also customize his own palette by selecting for example 'Custom 2' in the 'Palette scroll down menu and then clicking on the 'Palette Editor' button to display the '2D-Spectrum Palette' dialog box, where the user will be able to customize the desired palette (Name, Level Growth, Colors, Number of Levels, etc..). It is also possible to select the number of the positive and negative contours and also the scaling (in the 'Properties' dialog box) as you can see in the picture below:\n\nIf you want to obtain monochrome printouts, in pure black and white with no grayscale, just follow the procedure below and take a look at the picture below:\n\nRun Mnova and load your 2D-NMR spectrum.\n\nDouble click on the spectral window to open the â€˜Properties dialog boxâ€™\n\nSelect \"Custom\" on the \"˜Palette\" scroll down menu\n\nClick on the â€˜Palette Editorâ€™ button (just at the right side of the scroll down menu)\n\nSelect \"Grayscale\" on the \"˜Template\" colours scroll down menu\n\nClick on the \"Generate\" button\n\nIf you have 10 levels, check the 10th level of the palette and then click on the light-grey rectangle (just at the left side of the check mark) and select the black colour. Finally click on â€˜OKâ€™ buttons.\n\nIf you have 20 levels, do the same with the 20th level and so onâ€¦\n\nClick on OK buttons\n\nLet's take a look at another situation: how to make all positive contours a scale of greens and all negative contours a scale of blues? In this case, you will only need to select in the '2D Spectrum Palette' dialog box the first and the last colour of the positive peaks and the same for the negatives. For example, imagine that you have 10 positive contours, then you will need to select the colour of the contour 1 as 'dark green' (for example) and then check the corresponding mark at the right side. Finally, select the colour of the contour number 10 as 'light green' and check the mark. Do the same for the negative peaks; in this case the contour number 11 will be 'light blue' and the number 20 will be 'dark blue'. Please take a look at the screenshot below for further information.\n\nIt is also possible to change the colours of the 2D overlaid spectra by following the above procedure (but changing the colours). You will find below two overlaid spectra with different colours (one red and the other purple):\n\nOf course, you can also make your 2D spectrum with a single color (no ramp). Once you are in the 'Palette Editor' dialog box, double click on the coloured rectangle of the level number 1 and select the desired colour, do the same with the level number 10 (bear in mind that you select the same colour) and uncheck any other key mark that could be in the other levels:\n\nThe user can include the spectrum title (the title set previously on the spectrometer at acquire time) on any axis label by typing '$t$' in its corresponding edit box. Bear in mind that, Mnova will only show the first line of the original title. This title appears by default on each page of the page navigator. Hovering the cursor over the label edit box will reveal other commands for including information on the axis label, such as: $u$ = Lowercase Units; $U$ = Uppercase Units; $d$ = Lowercase Dimension; $D$: Uppercase Dimension; or $1n$ = Observed Nucleus (e.g. 1H, 13C...).\n\nIn the same way, the user can modify many other features such as the parameters and properties of the peaks or integrals. We will not go into further detail here since all the property pages should be self-explanatory and a description of each one can be found in its corresponding section of this manual. For example: once any table has been reported, it is possible to change its properties (position, size, fill and border) just by double clicking on it:\n\nOr for the molecules:"
