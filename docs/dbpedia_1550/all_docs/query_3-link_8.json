        "text": "Have you ever wondered why someone else got the position you applied for? Or why a colleague succeeded in getting a promotion rather than you? Steve Herz may know why, and what to do about it not happening again. Steve has spent his career helping broadcast journalists get positions with companies like CBS, CNN MSNBC, and Fox, as a premier talent agent, and now he helps others to advance their careers and improve their lives.\n\nI was looking forward to connecting with Steve Herz ever since I first read a piece about his work in Fast Company on a very clever and scalable approach to improving your career, which is detailed in his new book, Don’t Take Yes for an Answer.\n\nSteve is President of The Montag Group or TMG, a sports and entertainment talent and marketing consultancy. He is also a career advisor to CEOs, lawyers, entrepreneurs, and young professionals. Prior to joining TMG, Steve was the President and Founding Partner of IF Management, an industry leader and premier talent agency whose broadcasting division became one of the largest in the space—representing over 200 television and radio personalities and represents some of the biggest names in sports and news-media, including NBC Sports' Mike Tirico, ESPN’s Scott Van Pelt and Dan Shulman, and CNN Chief International Correspondent, Clarissa Ward.\n\nSteve received his bachelor’s degree in political science from the University of Michigan and his J.D. from Vanderbilt University Law School. Steve is involved with several charities, including serving on the local leadership council at Birthright Israel. He has also been a volunteer tutor at the Horizon High School at Rikers Island Prison in New York, and the Harlem Academy Charter School. Steve and his work have been featured in Entrepreneur, Business Insider, Chief Executive, Forbes, Wharton, Sirius, and a number of other podcasts.\n\nDon’t Take Yes for an Answer: Using Authority, Warmth, and Energy to Get Exceptional Results was nominated to be in the Next Big Idea Club by Adam Grant, Susan Cain, Daniel Pink, and Malcolm Gladwell. Here is what others have said about it:\n\nClarissa Ward, Chief International Correspondent at CNN said: “With clarity, wisdom and authority, Herz outlines smart and sensible ways to achieve success. Sometimes you have to take tough advice to get better, and failure is often the best teacher. Herz’s message is one we all need to hear.”\n\nNicholas Zeppos, Chancellor Emeritus and Professor of Law and Political Science at Vanderbilt, said “Steve has written a brilliant book. It is a must read for everyone no matter what age or stage in life or career. The characters come to life off the pages as Steve mixes humor, pathos, empathy, and straight honesty that makes this book one wants to read again and again. At the end of the book, Steve has become your best and most honest adviser!”\n\nWe learn what the tipping point was for Steve to formally articulate his approach and practice into a book. His construct, AWE, is based on three key communication strategies—Authority, Warmth, and Energy. I like the design of the chapters that include assessments, actionable tips and practices, cheat sheets, and stories. Steve’s premise is that when all else is equal—education, work ethic, intelligence, experience, ambition—the single biggest factor for doing well in business, or getting promoted, or more followers, or even being a better friend, hinges on our ability to communicate and connect. When we align these communication strategies, we can develop an advantage, no matter what area of our lives.\n\nSteve walks us through each of the strategies, shares some examples from the book, and tells us how even working from home, we can adapt the AWE tools in more virtual situations. Applying Steve’s construct to our personal lives, as well as our work lives, can help us all to live more fully and connected.\n\nAs for living a life in full, Steve shared his Gulf Coast Triathlon experience and what that was like while also raising thousands of dollars for the Leukemia Society (and being voted Most Inspirational member of the Team in Training!).\n\nHis underdog, earn-everything spirit has propelled Steve his whole life, and solidified his belief in the power of personal change. He’s leveraged his unique communication gifts and interpersonal skills to build a little company into an industry powerhouse. Steve’s ultimate goal remains using his motivational message and distinct skill-set to aid others on their journey to greater heights. He is a great role model for living a life in full.\n\nListen on iTunes or download here. You can also listen on Overcast, SoundCloud, Stitcher, Spotify, Google Podcasts, and iHeartRADIO as well.
