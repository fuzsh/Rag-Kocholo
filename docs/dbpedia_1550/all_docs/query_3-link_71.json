        "text": "Note: The Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) publishes a range of indicators that point to the extent to which labor resources are being utilized. Known as U–1, U–2, and U–4 through U–6 (U–3 is the official unemployment rate), these alternative measures of labor underutilization provide insight into a broad range of problems workers encounter in today’s labor market. Similar to the official unemployment rate, the alternative measures are presented as a percentage of the labor force (adjusted as necessary). U–1 shows the number of individuals unemployed 15 weeks or longer as a percentage of the labor force, while U–2 presents job losers and people who completed temporary jobs as a percentage of the labor force. U–4 through U–6 are broader than U–1, U–2, and U-3. In addition to the total unemployed, U–4 adds discouraged workers; U–5 adds all people marginally attached to the labor force (which includes discouraged workers); and U–6 adds all people marginally attached to the labor force, plus people employed part time for economic reasons.\n\nNote: All individuals who, during the Current Population Survey (CPS) reference week, did any work at all (at least 1 hour) as paid employees, worked in their own business or profession or on their own farm, or worked 15 hours or more as unpaid workers in an enterprise operated by a member of their family are said to be “at work.” Data on employed individuals “at work” exclude people who were not working but had jobs or businesses from which they were temporarily absent because of, for example, vacation or illness.\n\nNote: The average number of hours per worker for which pay was received.\n\nSee the video, \"The many ways we measure pay.\"\n\nNote: Access is defined as the percentage of workers in an occupation who are offered a benefit. For example, an employee may have access to an employer-sponsored fitness center, but may or may not use it. Employees in contributory plans are counted as participating in an insurance plan or a retirement plan if they have paid required contributions and met any applicable service requirements. Employees in noncontributory plans are counted as participating regardless of whether they have fulfilled their service requirements.\n\nNote: The benefits of chaining over a fixed base include a better reflection of (1) changing economic conditions, (2) technological progress, and (3) spending patterns, as well as a suitable means for handling items that are not traded every month in which the index is calculated. For example, see the video on the chained Consumer Price Index (CPI).\n\nSee the video, “Understanding the Chained Consumer Price Index.”\n\nNote: This form of medical cost sharing requires an insured person to pay a stated percentage of medical expenses after the deductible amount, if any, is paid. After any deductible amount and coinsurance are paid, the insurer is responsible for the rest of the reimbursement for covered benefits, up to the maximum allowed charges. The individual is responsible for any charges in excess of what the insurer determines to be “usual, customary, and reasonable.” Coinsurance rates may differ between services received from an approved provider and those received from providers not on the approved list.\n\nNote: The employer has a contractual arrangement to pay a premium to a third party, such as an insurance company, union, or association, in exchange for it assuming the risks and expenses of a benefit plan. For short-term disability, the actuarially determined premium is often specified as a rate per $10 of weekly benefit per month. In some cases, the employer contributes a specific amount (often a number of cents per hour worked for each employee) to a designated union or association fund that provides welfare benefits.\n\nNote: In all consumer expenditure Survey tables before 2004, income data were for complete income reporters only. From 2004 onward, income data are for all consumer units. Even complete income reporters may not have provided a full accounting of all income from all sources. Before 2004 in the Consumer Expenditure Survey, across-the-board zero income reporting was designated as invalid and the consumer unit was categorized as an incomplete reporter. With the introduction of income imputation, all consumer units have missing income values imputed or are represented by valid zeroes.\n\nNote: This type of plan replaces different types of leave, such as vacation, sick leave, and personal leave. In a consolidated leave plan, all types of leave are combined or used interchangeably within a single plan. Employees are allowed to use leave for any purpose that is stipulated by the plan. These plans are most often found at establishments such as hospitals, which must be open around the clock.\n\n(1) All members of a particular household who are related by blood, marriage, adoption, or some other legal arrangement; (2) a person living alone or sharing a household with others or living as a roomer in a private home or lodging house or in permanent living quarters in a hotel or motel, but who is financially independent; or (3) two or more people living together who pool their income to make joint expenditure decisions\n\nNote: Individual accounts are set up for participants, and benefits are based on the amounts credited to these accounts (through employer contributions and, if applicable, employee contributions) plus any investment earnings on the money in the account. Only employer contributions to the account are guaranteed, not the future benefits. In defined contribution plans, future benefits fluctuate on the basis of investment earnings. The most common type of defined contribution plan is a savings and thrift plan. Under this type of plan, the employee contributes a predetermined portion of his or her (usually pretax) earnings to an individual account, all or part of which is matched by the employer.\n\nNote: An interesting example is the use of the Consumer Price Index (CPI) as a deflator of the value of the consumer’s dollar to find its purchasing power. The purchasing power of the consumer’s dollar measures the change in the value to the consumer of goods and services that a dollar will buy at different dates. In other words, as prices increase, the purchasing power of the consumer’s dollar declines.\n\nNote: To derive an index, each component area is assigned a value of 0, 50, or 100 percent, depending on whether its employment showed a decrease, no change, or an increase, respectively, over the timespan of interest. The average (mean) value is then calculated, and this percentage is the diffusion index number. Fifty percent indicates an equal balance between industries with increasing and decreasing employment.\n\nNote: Discouraged workers are a subset of those who are marginally attached to the labor force. Discouraged workers include people who did not actively look for work in the prior 4 weeks for reasons such as “thinks no work available,” “could not find work,” “lacks schooling or training,” “employer thinks too young or old,” and other types of discrimination. (See table A-16 in “The Employment Situation” news release.)\n\nMore information can be found on the Current Population Survey's Labor force characteristics page under the heading, \"Discouraged workers.\"\n\nNote: Each employed person is counted only once, even if he or she holds more than one job. (The employment–population ratio represents the proportion of the civilian noninstitutional population that is employed.) The scope of the employed in the Current Population Survey (CPS) is smaller than that in American Time Use Survey (ATUS), because the CPS counts people 16 years and older, whereas ATUS counts people 15 years and older. (The reference period in ATUS is the last 7 days prior to the interview.)\n\nNote: A single establishment generally produces a single good or provides a single service. An enterprise (a private firm, government agency, or nonprofit organization) can consist of a single establishment or multiple establishments. All establishments in an enterprise may be classified into one industry (e.g., a chain); into different industries (e.g., a conglomerate); or into an economic unit that produces goods or services, usually at a single physical location, and that is engaged in one or predominantly one activity (e.g., a factory, a mine, a store, or an office). In the National Compensation Survey, for sampled private industries, the establishment usually is at a single physical location, such as a mine, a factory, an office, or a store, that produces goods or provides services. If a sampled establishment is owned by a larger entity with many locations, only the employment and characteristics of the establishment selected for the sample are considered for the survey. For state and local government, an establishment can include more than one physical location, such as a school district, a police department, a fire department, a health or social service operation, a highway maintenance operation, an urban transit operation, or some other governmental unit. Each establishment is assigned a six-digit North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code to reflect its primary economic activity.\n\nNote: The event or exposure describes what happened to cause an injury or illness—for example, overexertion while lifting an object or a fall from a ladder. This categorization differs from the nature of the incident, which describes the result of the incident, such as a torn muscle (from overexertion) or a broken ankle (caused by, say, a fall from a ladder). The categorization also differs from the source, or what contributed to the injury or illness—for example, a heavy object (what is lifted) or the floor (after a fall).\n\nNote: This type of leave may be used to care for a newborn child, an adopted child, a sick child, or a sick adult relative. A typical family leave plan extends leave without pay to an employee for a period of several months while the employee cares for the family member. The Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA) of 1993 is a federal law providing unpaid job-protected leave to eligible workers for the care of their families or themselves for specified family and medical conditions. The FMLA provides eligible workers with up to 12 workweeks of unpaid leave per year for the birth, adoption, or foster care placement of a child; the care of a spouse, son, daughter, or parent with a serious health condition; and the employee’s own serious health condition resulting in an inability to work.\n\nNote: Because prices for food and energy, and margins for trade services, tend to be erratic, some economists have come to focus attention on indexes that measure price changes for final demand to the exclusion of food, energy, and trade components as clearer measures of what is sometimes referred to as the underlying rate of inflation. This index is typically referred to as the Producer Price Index (PPI) for final demand less foods, energy, and trade services.\n\nSee also inflation.\n\nSee the Producer Price Index video.\n\nNote: For example, no matter what the level of profits, 5 percent is contributed to the plan. Profits may include those for the entire company or just those in a specific business unit. In a variation of this formula, employers set aside a reserve amount of profits (e.g., $1 million) and pay only a fixed percentage of any profits above this amount into the employees’ defined contribution plan.\n\nNote: The code permits companies providing flexible benefit plans to offer employees the following options: accident and health insurance plans, including healthcare spending accounts; group term life insurance and dependent coverage; disability benefits and accidental death and dismemberment plans; employee contributions to 401(k) plans or other thrift or savings plans (either pretax or after tax); dependent care assistance plans, including spending accounts; vacation days; and group legal services. Flexible benefit plans may be funded solely by the employer or through joint employer–employee contributions. Employers usually grant each employee credits to purchase benefits covered by the plan. Many plans include a core group of benefits (e.g., life insurance coverage of $25,000) and allow employees to purchase additional levels of the core benefit, as well as benefits not included in the core group. An example is the employer’s offering an additional $20,000 in life insurance coverage.\n\nNote: State employment includes counts of workers employed by state agencies. Local government represents those working for county or municipal organizations. Both state and local employment are covered by state unemployment insurance programs. Employment at all federal agencies for any given month is based on the number of people who worked during or received pay for the pay period that included the 12th of the month. Employment data reported for federal civilian employees are a byproduct of the operations of state workforce agencies in administering the provisions of Title XV of the Social Security Act the Unemployment Compensation for Federal Employees (UCFE) program. Federal employment data are based on reports of monthly employment and reports of quarterly wages, both submitted quarterly to state agencies. Reports are submitted for all federal installations with employees covered by the act, except for certain national security agencies, which are excluded for security reasons. Some Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) programs do not have data for all types of public sector employment.\n\nNote: For example, in the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) Employment Projections program, growth rate adjectives used in the Occupational Outlook Handbook (OOH) are defined by the following percent changes for the 2016–26 employment projections: much faster than the average = 15 percent or more, faster than the average = 10 percent to 14 percent, as fast as the average = 5 percent to 9 percent, slower than the average = 2 percent to 4 percent, little or no change = –1 percent to 1 percent, and decline = –2 percent or more.\n\nSee the video Understanding BLS employment.\n\nNote: For example, people who normally work 40 hours a week but were off on a holiday would be reported as having worked 32 hours even though they were paid for the holiday on which they did not work. Published data on hours of work relate to the actual number of hours spent “at work” during the reference week. For those working in more than one job, the published figures relate to the number of hours worked at all jobs during the reference week. Data on people “at work” exclude those employed who were absent from their jobs during the entire reference week for reasons such as vacation, illness, or an industrial dispute. Data also are available on usual hours worked by all those employed, including those who were absent from their jobs during the reference week.\n\nNote: Workers identified as self-employed (incorporated and unincorporated) in the basic Current Population Survey (CPS) are asked, “Are you self-employed as an independent contractor, independent consultant, or something else (such as a shop or restaurant owner)?” to distinguish those who consider themselves to be independent contractors, consultants, or freelance workers from those who are business operators such as shop owners or restaurateurs. Those identified as wage and salary workers in the basic CPS are asked, “Last week, were you working as an independent contractor, an independent consultant, or a freelance worker? That is, someone who obtains customers on his or her own to provide a product or service.”\n\nNote: The amount of the survivor annuity may not be less than 50 percent, or more than 100 percent, of the amount payable during the time the participant and spouse are both alive. The annuity payable for the life of the participant is lower than that for a straight-life annuity; to account for the increased length of time over which payments will be made, this reduction may be a percentage of the straight-life benefit, such as 10 percent, or may be based on the life expectancy of the participant and spouse (an actuarial reduction).\n\nNote: Benefits usually are paid as a fixed percentage of predictable earnings, up to a set limit. Most participants have a waiting period of 3 to 6 months, or until sick leave or short-term disability benefits end, before long-term disability benefits begin. Long-term disability benefits generally continue until retirement or a specified age, or for a period that varies with the employee’s age at the time of the disability.\n\nPeople not in the labor force who want and are available for work, and who have looked for a job sometime in the previous 12 months (or since the end of their last job if they held one within the previous 12 months), but were not counted as unemployed because they had not searched for work in the 4 weeks preceding the survey.\n\nNote: Terms used to define the marital status of individuals at the time of the Current Population Survey (CPS) interview are as follows: (1) “Married, spouse present” applies to husband and wife if both were living in the same household, even though one may be temporarily absent on business, on vacation, on a visit, in a hospital, etc. (2) “Other marital status” applies to people who are married with spouse absent (relates to people who are separated because of marital problems, as well as to husbands and wives who are living apart because one or the other was employed elsewhere or was on duty with the Armed Forces or who are living apart for any other reasons); widowed; or divorced.\n\nNote: \"Text taken from D. Kasprzyk, “Chapter IX – Measurement error in household surveys: sources and measurement” in Household Sample Surveys in Developing and Transition Countries - • Questionnaire: the effect of the questionnaire design, its visual layout, the topics it covers, and the wording of the questions. • Data-collection method: the effect of how the questionnaire is administered to the respondent (for example, mail, in person, or diary). Respondents may answer Household Sample Surveys in Developing and Transition Countries 174 question+D317s differently in the presence of an interviewer, by themselves, or by using a diary. • Interviewer: the effect that the interviewer has on the response to a question. The interviewer may introduce error in survey responses by not reading the items as intended, by probing inappropriately when handing an inadequate response, or by adding other information that may confuse or mislead the respondent. • Respondent: the effect of the fact that respondents, because of their different experiences, knowledge and attitudes, may interpret the meaning of questionnaire items differently.\"\n\nNote: Eleven Metropolitan Statistical Areas (MSAs) and New England City and Town Areas (NECTAs) are large enough to be subdivided into metropolitan divisions. MSAs and NECTAs are identified by five-digit codes in which the fifth digit is zero. The metropolitan divisions are also identified by five-digit codes—codes for metropolitan divisions all end in 4, so they can be easily distinguished from MSAs and NECTAs. For example, the Dallas–Plano–Irving, TX, Metropolitan Division (code 19124) and the Fort Worth–Arlington, TX, Metropolitan Division (23104) make up the Dallas–Fort Worth–Arlington Metropolitan Statistical Area (19100).\n\nSee metropolitan statistical area and NECTAs.\n\nNote: Asset changes include changes in savings and checking accounts; purchases of securities (stocks, bonds, or mutual funds) in the year in which they were held to the end of the year; sales of securities that were purchased in a previous year; changes in the balances of money owed to the consumer unit; sales and purchases of, and repairs and improvements to, own dwelling occupied by the consumer unit, a vacation home, recreational property, unimproved land, and other property owned by the consumer unit; changes in investments in unincorporated family businesses and farms; amounts received or reimbursements from the sale of vehicles; principal amounts of trust held on own dwelling, vacation home, and other properties owned by the consumer unit; and surrender of insurance policies.\n\nNote: Before 1994, new entrants were defined as jobseekers who had never worked at a full-time job lasting 2 weeks or longer, and reentrants were defined as jobseekers who had held a full-time job for at least 2 weeks and had then spent some time out of the labor force before their most recent period of job search. These definitions have been modified to encompass any type of job, not just a full-time job, of at least 2 weeks’ duration. Thus, new entrants are now defined as jobseekers who have never worked at all, whereas reentrants are defined as jobseekers who have worked before, but not immediately before their job search.\n\nNote: \"Employees who perform essentially the same tasks are in the same occupation, whether or not they are in the same industry. Some occupations are concentrated in a few industries, whereas other occupations are found in the majority of industries. In the Consumer Expenditure survey, occupation refers to the occupation in which the reference person received the most earnings during the survey period. \"\n\nSee also job.\n\nSee the video, \"A look at occupational employment in the United States.\"\n\nNote: This category includes workers who answer affirmatively to the question, “Some people are in a pool of workers who are ONLY called to work as needed, although they can be scheduled to work for several days or weeks in a row, for example, substitute teachers and construction workers supplied by a union hiring hall. These people are sometimes referred to as ON-CALL workers. Were you an ON-CALL worker last week?” People with regularly scheduled work that might include periods of being “on call” to perform work at unusual hours, such as medical residents, are not included in this category.\n\nNote: People classified as at work part time for economic reasons are sometimes referred to as involuntary part-time workers. Economic reasons are slack work or unfavorable business conditions, inability to find full-time work, and seasonal declines in demand. Those who usually work part time must also indicate that they want and are available for full-time work to be classified as part time for economic reasons.\n\nNote: Noneconomic reasons are illness or other medical limitation, childcare problems or other family or personal obligations, school or training, retirement or Social Security limits on earnings, and being in a job in which full-time work is less than 35 hours. The group also includes those who gave an economic reason for usually working 1 to 34 hours but said that they did not want to work full time or were unavailable for such work.\n\nNote: Developed by the U.S Census Bureau, CPS population controls are based on decennial census population counts, supplemented with birth and death data and estimates of net international migration. The population estimation methodology is available on the Census Bureau’s website. The Census Bureau adjusts the CPS population controls each year to include the latest information about population change and to incorporate any improvements in the estimation methodology. BLS introduces the annual population control adjustments into the CPS estimates with data for January. The adjustments may increase or decrease the estimated population level, depending on whether the latest information indicates that the population estimates had trended high or low. Conceptually, the effects of the annual population control adjustments represent cumulative over- or underestimation of the population since the last decennial census point.\n\nNote: The lowest quintile ranges from the lowest value to the 20th percentile; the second quintile ranges from the 20th percentile to the 40th percentile; the third quintile ranges from the 40th percentile to the 60th percentile; the fourth quintile ranges from the 60th percentile to the 80th percentile; and the final quintile ranges from the 80th percentile to the highest value.\n\nNote: These cases include any work-related case involving cancer, chronic irreversible disease, a fractured or cracked bone, or a punctured eardrum. Additional criteria that can result in a recordable case include any needlestick injury or cut from a sharp object that is contaminated with another person’s blood or other potentially infectious material, any case requiring an employee to be medically removed under the requirements of an OSHA health standard, and a tuberculosis infection as evidenced by a positive skin test or diagnosis by a physician or other licensed healthcare professional after exposure to a known case of active tuberculosis.\n\nNote: When a sample rather than the entire population is surveyed, there is a chance that the sample estimates may differ from the “true” population values they represent. CPS data are subject to both sampling and nonsampling error. The exact difference, or sampling error, varies with the particular sample selected, and this variability is measured by the standard error of the estimate. There is about a 90-percent chance, or level of confidence, that an estimate based on a sample will differ by no more than 1.6 standard errors from the true population value because of sampling error. BLS analyses are generally conducted at the 90-percent level of confidence. More information about the reliability of data from the CPS can be found at Labor Force Statistics from the Current Population Survey, Reliability of estimates from the CPS.\n\nNote: Respondents are asked whether they were currently enrolled in a regular school, including day or night school in any type of public, parochial, or other private school. Regular schooling is that which may advance a person toward a high school diploma or a college, university, or professional degree. Other schooling, including trade schools, on-the-job training, and courses that do not require one’s physical presence in school, such as correspondence courses or other courses of independent study, is included only if the credits granted count toward promotion in regular schools.\n\nNote: Some economic data exhibit fluctuations due to seasonal events, including changes in weather, harvests, major holidays, and school schedules. Because these seasonal events follow a more or less regular pattern each year, their influence on statistical trends can be eliminated by seasonally adjusting the statistics from month to month. Seasonal adjustments make it easier to observe the cyclical, underlying trend and other, nonseasonal movements in the series.\n\nNote: This category includes workers who say their job is temporary and answer affirmatively to the question, “Are you paid by a temporary-help agency?” Also included are workers who say their job is not temporary and answer affirmatively to the question, “Even though you told me your job is not temporary, are you paid by a temporary-help agency?” To the extent that permanent staff of temporary-help agencies indicate that they are paid by their agencies, the estimate of the number of workers whose employment is mediated by temporary-help agencies can be overstated.\n\nNote: For the 2010 census, the Census Bureau redefined the classification of urban areas to “a densely settled core of census tracts and/or census blocks that meet minimum population density requirements, along with adjacent territory containing nonresidential urban land uses as well as territory with low population density included to link outlying densely settled territory with the densely settled core.”\n\nSee also rural population.\n\nFor an example of quality adjustment, see Quality adjustment in the CPI.\n\nNote: Usual weekly earnings include any overtime pay, commissions, and tips usually received (at the main job in the case of multiple jobholders). Earnings reported on a basis other than weekly (e.g., annual, monthly, hourly) are converted to weekly. Data refer to wage and salary workers only, excluding all self-employed people (regardless of whether their businesses were incorporated) and all unpaid family workers. Before 1994, respondents were asked how much they usually earned per week. Since January 1994, respondents have been asked to identify the easiest way for them to report their earnings (hourly, weekly, biweekly, twice monthly, monthly, annually, other) and how much they usually earn in the period reported. Earnings reported on a basis other than weekly are converted to a weekly equivalent. The term “usual” is as perceived by the respondent. If the respondent asks for a definition of “usual,” interviewers are instructed to define the term as more than half of the weeks worked during the past 4 or 5 months.\n\nNote: Nonveterans never served on Active Duty in the U.S. Armed Forces. Veterans could have served anywhere in the world during the following periods of service: Gulf war era II (September 2001–present), Gulf war era I (August 1990–August 2001), Vietnam era (August 1964–April 1975), Korean war (July 1950–January 1955), World War II (December 1941–December 1946), and other service periods (all other periods). Veterans who served in more than one wartime period are classified into only the most recent one. Veterans who served during one of the selected wartime periods and another period are classified into only the wartime period.\n\nNote: Wage and salary workers include employees in both the private and public sector. Union membership data and earnings data exclude all self-employed workers, both those with incorporated businesses as well as those with unincorporated businesses. “Wage and salary” is the worker’s hourly straight-time wage rate or, for workers not paid on an hourly basis, straight-time earnings divided by the corresponding hours worked. Straight-time wage and salary rates are total earnings before payroll deductions, excluding premium pay for overtime and for work on weekends and holidays, shift differentials, and nonproduction bonuses such as lump-sum payments provided in lieu of wage increases.\n\nTo find information on pay and benefits, see the \"Comparison matrix of BLS compensation data sources.\"\n\nNote: \"Straight-time wage and salary rates are total earnings before payroll deductions, excluding premium pay for overtime and for work on weekends and holidays, shift differentials, and nonproduction bonuses such as lump-sum payments provided in lieu of wage increases. However, the NCS does include production bonuses and commissions in wages and salaries.\n\nSee the National Compensation Measures Handbook of Methods concepts section for additional information on wages and salaries.\n\nNote: The requirements of usually working for only one customer and usually working at the customer’s worksite are imposed to focus on workers whose employment appears to be very closely tied to the firm for which they are performing the work, rather than including all workers employed by firms that provide services. The category of workers provided by contract firms includes workers who answer affirmatively to the question, “Some companies provide employees or their services to others under contract. A few examples of services that can be contracted out include security, landscaping, and computer programming. Did you work for a company that contracts out you or your services last week?” but who respond negatively to the question, “Are you usually assigned to more than one customer?” and affirmatively to the question, “Do you usually work at the customer’s worksite?”\n\nNote: The NCS produces earnings data by levels of work within an occupation. The duties and responsibilities of a job are evaluated with the use of four factors (knowledge, job control and complexity, contacts, physical environment in which the job is performed) to determine a work level. Levels vary by occupation, ranging from 1 to 15. For example, level 1 may represent an entry level, while level 15 may represent master-level skills."
