        "text": "Germ cells are unique stem cells that give rise to eggs and sperm, and ultimately to an entire organism. Germ cells of diverse species are characterized by the accumulation of electron-dense and membraneless structures referred to as germ granules (Lehtiniemi and Kotaja, 2018; Trcek and Lehmann, 2019; Voronina et al., 2011). Germ granules are widely distributed throughout the animal kingdom. For example, they are known as ‘P granules’ in worms (Strome and Wood, 1982), ‘nuage and polar granules’ in fruit flies (Mahowald, 1968), ‘intermitochondrial cement’ in frogs (Bilinski et al., 2004), and ‘chromatoid bodies’ in mice (Parvinen, 2005).\n\nGenetic and molecular analyses uncovered common classes of proteins that are enriched in germ granules across phyla (Anderson and Kedersha, 2009; Trcek and Lehmann, 2019; Updike and Strome, 2010; Voronina et al., 2011). These include Piwi proteins and their small RNA cofactors—piRNAs that recognize and silence transposable elements Aravin et al., 2006; Brennecke et al., 2007; Lau et al., 2006; Vagin et al., 2006; ATP-dependent helicases such as Vasa proteins that are involved in RNA metabolism (Gustafson and Wessel, 2010; Spike et al., 2008), and LOTUS-domain proteins (Limkain /MARF1, Oskar and Tudor domain-containing proteins 5 and 7) (Anantharaman et al., 2010; Callebaut and Mornon, 2010; Kubíková et al., 2020). Metazoan LOTUS domain proteins promote germ cell development. For example, Drosophila Oskar interacts with Vasa through its LOTUS domain and serves as scaffold for germ plasm assembly (Jeske et al., 2017; Lehmann, 2016). Mouse TDRD5 and TDRD7 are required for spermatogenesis (Lachke et al., 2011; Smith et al., 2004; Tanaka et al., 2011; Yabuta et al., 2011). Recent work revealed the identity of three LOTUS-domain proteins in C. elegans and has begun to explore their role in germ granule organization and small RNA biogenesis (Cipriani et al., 2021; Marnik et al., 2021).\n\nC. elegans germ granules—P granules—provide an exceptional in vivo model to study granule formation and function (Seydoux, 2018; Strome and Wood, 1982; Updike and Strome, 2010). Biophysical studies combined with high-resolution microscopy describe P granules as phase‐transitioned condensates (Brangwynne et al., 2009). P granules are present in germ cells throughout the entire C. elegans life cycle. Yet strikingly, they appear in different forms. In the adult gonad where germ cells undergo mitosis and differentiation, abundant P granules are associated with the cytoplasmic face of nuclear pores (Pitt et al., 2000; Sheth et al., 2010; Updike et al., 2011). During oogenesis, P granules detach from the nuclear membrane and become diffuse in the cytoplasm. Passed on to progeny, P granules partition to the posterior of one-cell embryos. During following cell divisions, P granules are segregated into the germline blastomeres and begin to coalesce and attach to the nuclear periphery. P granules ultimately become perinuclear in the primordial germ cells which give rise to the adult germ line (Updike and Strome, 2010).\n\nMore than 40 protein components are enriched in P granules (Updike and Strome, 2010). Genetic analyses have revealed an assembly pathway that involves core proteins including DEPS-1, GLH-1, PGL-1, and IFE-1. DEPS-1 is a nematode-specific protein that is required for GLH-1 accumulation (Spike et al., 2008). GLH-1 belongs to a conserved Vasa family that contributes to germ line development and fertility (Gustafson and Wessel, 2010; Spike et al., 2008). In addition to the conserved DEAD-box helicase domains, GLH-1 and some of its paralogs contain phenylalanine-glycine (FG) repeats which are postulated to promote perinuclear localization of P granules (Chen et al., 2020; Marnik et al., 2019; Updike et al., 2011). PGL-1 contains both RNA binding and dimerization domains and serves as a P granule scaffold protein (Aoki et al., 2016; Kawasaki et al., 1998). Loss of either DEPS-1 or GLH-1 causes dispersal of PGL-1 into the cytoplasm, suggesting DEPS-1 and GLH-1 act upstream of PGL-1 (Kawasaki et al., 2004; Kawasaki et al., 1998). IFE-1 is a C. elegans homolog of eIF4E, an mRNA cap-binding protein (Keiper et al., 2000). IFE-1 and PGL-1 interact directly and the association of IFE-1 with P granules depends on PGL-1 (Amiri et al., 2001). So far, P granule components are primarily identified by genetic approaches (Updike and Strome, 2010). Due to their perinuclear localization and the nature of membraneless compartments, P granules cannot be easily purified via a conventional fractionation-based approach. Therefore, P granule composition and the molecular rules underlying its assembly and migration remain largely unknown.\n\nOur current study used a proximity-based labeling method in conjunction with mass spectrometry to define the P granule proteome. This uncovered over 200 protein candidates. We show that EGGD-1 and EGGD-2 (embryonic and germline P granule detached), referred to as MIP-1 and MIP-2 (MEG-3 interacting protein), respectively, in a related study (Cipriani et al., 2021), play a key role in promoting perinuclear localization of P granules. EGGD-1 associates with the nuclear periphery and its localization depends on its intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs). EGGD-1 recruits the Vasa protein GLH-1 possibly through its LOTUS domains. Loss of eggd-1 and eggd-2 causes detachment of P granules from the nuclear periphery, germ line atrophy, and infertility. Taken together, our findings define the germ granule proteome and shed light on the organization principles of germ granules.\n\nSince the discovery of perinuclear P granules, the molecular mechanisms for their assembly have been under intensive investigation (Strome and Wood, 1982; Updike and Strome, 2010). Previous studies showed that P granule formation requires core components including PGL family members PGL-1 and PGL-3, and Vasa family members GLH-1 and GLH-4 (Gruidl et al., 1996; Kawasaki et al., 2004; Kawasaki et al., 1998; Spike et al., 2008; Updike et al., 2011). Zygotic P granule assembly further requires intrinsically disordered proteins MEG-3 and MEG-4 (Smith et al., 2016; Wang et al., 2014). However, it remains unclear how P granules are formed and retained at the nuclear periphery.\n\nUsing proximity labeling and genetic approaches, we discovered and characterized EGGD-1 and EGGD-2—LOTUS-domain and IDR-containing proteins. The same proteins were identified as MEG-3 interactors and referred to as MIP-1 and MIP-2 (MEG-3 interacting protein) respectively (Cipriani et al., 2021). Both studies reveal that LOTUS-domain proteins are required for C. elegans germline development and fertility. More importantly, both studies provide insight into the molecular function of LOTUS-domain proteins in promoting formation of perinuclear P granules. Using in vitro pull-down and yeast two-hybrid assays, Cipriani et al show that MIPs physically interact with GLH-1, a member of the Vasa family (Cipriani et al., 2021). Here we show that IDRs are required to anchor EGGD-1 protein to the nuclear periphery, and that the LOTUS domains are essential for perinuclear localization of P granules, likely by recruiting GLH-1. Remarkably, EGGD-1 is capable of self-assembling into perinuclear granules. Thus, EGGD-1 is not only necessary but also sufficient for recruiting GLH-1 to the nuclear periphery.\n\nBased on these findings, we propose a model for the molecular function of EGGD proteins (Figure 6D). IDRs of EGGD proteins may form multivalent interactions with cytoplasmic filaments of the nuclear pore complex. It is possible that IDRs preferentially associate with phenylalanine/glycine-rich NPPs that are intrinsically disordered (Marnik et al., 2019; Updike et al., 2011). Dimerization of LOTUS domains may serve as an interface for the binding of Vasa protein GLH-1 (Cipriani et al., 2021; Jeske et al., 2015; Jeske et al., 2017). Association of GLH-1 with the nuclear periphery initiates the recruitment of PGL-1 and additional P granule proteins. More experiments, both in vitro and in vivo, will be required to dissect this complex PPI network.\n\nInterplay between EGGD-1 and EGGD-2\n\nThe interplay between EGGD-1 and EGGD-2 seems complex. In the adult germ line, EGGD-1 and EGGD-2 function partially redundantly. EGGD-1 plays a more dominant role in promoting the perinuclear localization of P granules (Figure 3C). In the embryos, however, both proteins are required for P granule partitioning and attachment to the nuclear periphery (Figure 3—figure supplement 1B). One speculative explanation is that EGGD-1 and EGGD-2 interact with different Vasa proteins and thus make distinct contributions to P granule assembly in the germ line and zygotes.\n\nMost LOTUS domain proteins, including Oskar, TDRD5, and TDRD7, harbor a single eLOTUS domain. In contrast, EGGD-1 and EGGD-2 are predicted to contain two eLOTUS domains (Figure 4—figure supplement 1A). The eLOTUS domain of Drosophilla Oskar is capable of forming dimers (Jeske et al., 2015; Jeske et al., 2017). In vitro pull-down assays revealed that recombinant MIP-1 physically interacts with itself and MIP-2 (Cipriani et al., 2021). Here we show EGGD-1 self-aggregates into granules when expressed ectopically (Figure 6). It is possible that MIP-1/EGGD-1 and MIP-2/EGGD-2 form homodimers, heterodimers, or even oligomers in vivo through their eLOTUS domains. Of note, an independent study identified a third LOTUS domain protein LOTR-1 which is homologous to mammalian TDRD5/7 (Marnik et al., 2021). Interestingly, similar to EGGD-1 and EGGD-2, LOTR-1 was also enriched from our TurboID experiments (Figure 2B and Supplementary file 1). Future genetic experiments will be required to determine the interplay of these three LOTUS domain proteins in regulating perinuclear P granule formation.\n\nLOTUS domain proteins as scaffolds for germ granule assembly\n\nLOTUS domains are found in bacteria, plants, and animals (Anantharaman et al., 2010; Callebaut and Mornon, 2010). LOTUS domains exhibit minimum sequence homology (Figure 4—figure supplement 1A; Anantharaman et al., 2010; Callebaut and Mornon, 2010). Yet they adopt a common helix-turn-helix conformation (Anantharaman et al., 2010; Callebaut and Mornon, 2010; Jeske et al., 2015; Jeske et al., 2017). The fact that diverse sequences yield a similar structure implies that the LOTUS domain acts as a structural scaffold. Indeed, the conserved function of eLOTUS domains is to bind to Vasa (Jeske et al., 2017).\n\nConsistent with the idea the structure of a protein largely determines its functional properties, LOTUS proteins are essential for the development of metazoan germ cells. In Drosophila, Oskar is required for germ plasm assembly and germ cell formation (Jeske et al., 2017; Lehmann, 2016). In mice, TDRD7 localizes to chromatoid bodies (P granule counterpart), and is required for spermatogenesis (Lachke et al., 2011; Smith et al., 2004; Tanaka et al., 2011; Yabuta et al., 2011). In this study, we show that C. elegans EGGD-1 and EGGD-2 are key components for germ granule assembly on the nuclear periphery. Taken together, these findings suggest that LOTUS domain proteins belong to a unique family that has low sequence identity, but high structure homology and functional similarity. It will be important to use structure-based, but not sequence-based, search programs to identify more LOTUS domain proteins across phyla.\n\nAdvantage and limitation of proximity labeling in this study\n\nProximity labeling is a powerful approach to map the proteome composition of organelles in living cells. Compared to conventional affinity purification, the key advantage lies in its ability to capture weak and transient interaction. In addition, the strong binding of biotin to streptavidin permits stringent protein extraction which reduces background contaminants. It is therefore an ideal tool to define the composition of phase-separated membraneless organelles that are formed by weak multivalent interactions (Bracha et al., 2019). Proximity labeling uses a promiscuous enzyme such as BioID, APEX, or TurboID (Branon et al., 2018; Rhee et al., 2013; Roux et al., 2012). TurboID appears to be the best choice for C. elegans labeling for several reasons: (1) TurboID is active from 20°C to 25°C, a range of temperature suitable for C. elegans cultivation (Branon et al., 2018). (2) TurboID uses ATP and biotin as substrates which are readily available in cells, while APEX requires exogenous cofactors which may not be easily transported into worms (Branon et al., 2018; Rhee et al., 2013). (3) TurboID catalyzes biotinylation with much greater efficiency than BioID (Branon et al., 2018).\n\nIn this study, we employed TurboID in combination with mass spectrometry analysis to define the constituents of P granules. While this approach identified many known and unknown P granule proteins, it has some limitations. First, TurboID fusion proteins can be toxic. We found strains expressing TurboID::IFE-1 and PGL-1::TurboID proteins either unhealthy or infertile (Figure 1B). Second, TurboID labeled cytoplasmic proteins as revealed by streptavidin staining (Figure 1D). It is possible that some proteins are biotinylated by TurboID when passing through P granules and shuttling between the nucleus and cytoplasm. Consistent with this idea, TurboID enriched IMA-2, a member of importin α family of nuclear-cytoplasmic transport factors (Supplementary file 1). Alternatively, because P granules are membraneless and highly dynamic, the bait proteins (GLH-1 and DEPS-1) may constantly mix and de-mix with surrounding cytoplasmic components.\n\nWhile we continue to optimize the protocol for TurboID labeling, several approaches can be used to overcome these limitations. For example, an auxin-inducible degradation system can be applied to deplete the toxic TurboID fusion proteins (Zhang et al., 2015). Removing worms from auxin-containing plates enables the transient expression of TurboID proteins and thus proximity labeling. More recently, a split-TurboID method was developed, in which TurboID is split into two inactive fragments, but can be reconstituted in vivo (Cho et al., 2020). It is conceivable to fuse individual fragments of TurboID into two P granule proteins. In this case, TurboID will become active only when two bait proteins interact within the compartment. We envision this approach will greatly improve the specificity in labeling P granule proteins.\n\nIn addition to P granules, C. elegans germ cells possess other membraneless organelles such as Z granules and Mutator foci (Phillips et al., 2012; Wan et al., 2018). These granules are adjacent to one another, but each has distinct functions in RNAi and transgenerational epigenetic inheritance (Phillips et al., 2012; Wan et al., 2018). We speculate that they share some common proteins, but also contain unique components. Proximity labeling described in this study can be applied to unravel the proteome of Z granules and Mutator foci, and thus will provide new insight into the organization and function of germ granules."
