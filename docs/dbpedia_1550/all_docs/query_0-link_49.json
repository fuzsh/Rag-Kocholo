        "text": "About the ADA Accessibility Standards\n\nAccessibility standards issued under the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) apply to places of public accommodation, commercial facilities, and state and local government facilities in new construction, alterations, and additions. The ADA Standards are based on minimum guidelines set by the Access Board.\n\nThe Department of Justice (DOJ) and the Department of Transportation (DOT) issue the ADA Standards. DOJ’s ADA Standards apply to all facilities except public transportation facilities, which are subject to DOT’s ADA Standards. This version of the ADA Standards combines both documents and notes unique provisions in the DOJ Standards and the DOT Standards. The Access Board is responsible for providing technical assistance and training on these Standards.\n\nFigures\n\nFigures in the ADA Standards are available for download (zip file of figures in .dwg format).\n\nBackground\n\nJuly 26, 1991 — The Board publishes the original ADA Accessibility Guidelines (ADAAG), which are also adopted as standards by DOJ on the same day.\n\nSeptember 6, 1991 — The Board publishes the original ADAAG for Transportation Facilities, which are also adopted by DOT on the same day.\n\nSeptember 14, 1994 — The Board creates the ADAAG Review Advisory Committee to assist in updating the ADAAG.\n\nJuly 10, 1996 — ADAAG Review Advisory Committee submits its final report to the Board.\n\nJanuary 13, 1998 — The Board publishes ADAAG supplements covering state and local government facilities and building elements designed for children’s use.\n\nNovember 16, 1999 — The Board jointly proposed updates to ADAAG and to the Architectural Barriers Act (ABA) Accessibility Guidelines for public comment.\n\nOctober 18, 2000 — The Board publishes an ADAAG supplement on play areas.\n\nSeptember 3, 2002 — The Board issues an ADAAG supplement on recreation facilities.\n\nJuly 23, 2004 — The Board issues the updated ADA and ABA Accessibility Guidelines as a final rule.\n\nOctober 30, 2006 — DOT adopts new ADA Standards for transportation facilities based on the updated ADA Guidelines (effective November 29, 2006).\n\nSeptember 15, 2010 — DOJ adopts new ADA Standards (effective March 15, 2012) under title II and title III of the ADA.\n\nMay 7, 2014 — The Board publishes a supplement to the ADA and ABA Accessibility Guidelines on emergency transportable housing.\n\nSeptember 26, 2014 — The Board issues correction to final guidelines for emergency transportable housing.\n\nIntroduction to the ADA standards\n\nThe ADA standards are issued by the Department of Justice (DOJ) and the Department of Transportation (DOT) and apply to facilities covered by the ADA in new construction and alterations. DOJ’s standards apply to all facilities covered by the ADA, except public transportation facilities, which are subject to DOT’s standards.\n\nBoth standards are very similar and are closely based on the Board’s ADA Accessibility Guidelines (ADAAG). However, each contains a few unique provisions, which are included in this edition of the standards.\n\nDepartment of Justice ADA Standards (2010)\n\nDOJ’s ADA standards (2010) became mandatory on March 15, 2012. They include provisions that modify certain portions of Chapters 1-10, including provisions addressing the following areas:\n\nAssembly Areas (221)\n\nMedical Care Facilities (223)\n\nPlaces of Lodging (224)\n\nHousing at Places of Education (224 and 233)\n\nDetention and Correctional Facilities (section 232)\n\nSocial Service Center Establishments (233)\n\nResidential Dwelling Units (233)\n\nSee also on DOJ’s website at www.ada.gov:\n\nThe full text of DOJ’s 2010 ADA Standards\n\nDOJ’s ADA regulations implementing the 2010 ADA Standards\n\nDepartment of Transportation ADA Standards for Transportation Facilities (2006)\n\nDOT’s ADA standards (2006) apply to facilities used by state and local governments to provide designated public transportation services, including bus stops and stations, and rail stations.
