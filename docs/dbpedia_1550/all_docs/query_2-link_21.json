        "text": "Pub­lished in Q. J. R. Mete­o­rol. Soc.,147,1150–1169, 2021:\n\nOne impor­tant attribute of mete­o­ro­log­i­cal fore­casts is their rep­re­sen­ta­tion of spa­tial struc­tures. While sev­er­al exist­ing ver­i­fi­ca­tion meth­ods explic­it­ly mea­sure a struc­ture error, they most­ly pro­duce a sin­gle val­ue with no sim­ple inter­pre­ta­tion. Extend­ing a recent­ly devel­oped wavelet-based ver­i­fi­ca­tion method, this study sep­a­rate­ly eval­u­ates the pre­dict­ed spa­tial scale, ori­en­ta­tion and degree of anisotropy. The scale com­po­nent has been rig­or­ous­ly test­ed in pre­vi­ous work and is known to assess the qual­i­ty of a fore­cast sim­i­lar to oth­er, estab­lished meth­ods. How­ev­er, direc­tion­al aspects of spa­tial struc­ture are less fre­quent­ly con­sid­ered in the ver­i­fi­ca­tion lit­er­a­ture. Since impor­tant weath­er phe­nom­e­na relat­ed to fronts, coast­lines and orog­ra­phy have dis­tinct­ly anisotrop­ic sig­na­tures, their rep­re­sen­ta­tion in mete­o­ro­log­i­cal mod­els is clear­ly of inter­est. The abil­i­ty of the new wavelet approach to accu­rate­ly eval­u­ate direc­tion­al prop­er­ties is demon­strat­ed using ide­al­ized and real­is­tic test cas­es from the Meso­VICT project. A com­par­i­son of pre­cip­i­ta­tion fore­casts from sev­er­al fore­cast­ing sys­tems reveals that errors in scale and direc­tion can occur inde­pen­dent­ly and should be treat­ed as sep­a­rate aspects of fore­cast qual­i­ty. In a final step, we use the inverse wavelet trans­form to define a sim­ple post-pro­cess­ing algo­rithm that cor­rects the struc­tur­al errors. The pro­ce­dure improves visu­al sim­i­lar­i­ty with the obser­va­tions, as well as the objec­tive scores.\n\nAuthors: Sebas­t­ian Buschow and Petra Friederichs"
