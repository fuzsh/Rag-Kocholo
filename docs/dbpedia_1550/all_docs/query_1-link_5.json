        "text": "The lawsuit by Hertz Rental Car against Accenture turned into a rallying cry by Agilest and No Estimates advocates. Of course, these advocates still need to perform a Root Cause analysis, but it makes good clickbait for their followers.\n\nHaving done many Root Cause Analyses using the Apollo Method, let's look at the claims made in the lawsuit and see if any root causes, corrective, or preventive actions can be revealed from the court documents. This is an outside view that asks some simple questions:\n\nIf there is an observed undesirable outcome, what might be the conditions or activities that are the root cause of this outcome?\n\nWith the observed undesirable outcome, what corrective or preventive actions could have been taken to remove the possibility of the unwanted outcome?\n\nThis approach is guided by the processes for Root Cause Analysis in the Software-Intensive System of Systems project I've worked on.\n\nRoot Cause Analysis is Risk Management, which asks the question, what is the condition or activity that will create a risk to the success of our project? With this information, the management of the project installs corrective or preventive actions to remove or reduce those conditions and activities as much as possible. Without this approach, you only learn about the problems that will cause failure (for example, Hertz and Accenture) after they happen. Risk Management is How Adults Manage Projects - Tim Lister.\n\nAs well, here are some past work and resources on problems similar to this.\n\nProject Disappointment Starts When We Fail to recognize the 5 Immutable Principles of Project Success.\n\nGetting it Right\n\nHere's a decomposition of the situation\n\nCourt document\n\nHertz spent months planning the project. It assessed the current state of its e-commerce activities, defined goals and strategy for its digital business, and developed a roadmap that would allow Hertz to realize its vision.\n\nAssessment\n\nWhat did these plans look like?\n\nWere they based on the established planning processes for complex Software Intensive System of Systems? Were there: Measures of EffectivenessMeasures of Performance Key Performance ParametersKey System Attributes\n\nWas there a system architecture? Not a technical architecture but a process and acquisition architecture defined in an Acquisition Project Execution Plan (PEP)? Did this Programmatic Architecture define all the player, what they were accountable for, and the units of measure to assess the credibility, validity, quality, and compliance of their products with the PEP?\n\nCourt Document\n\nHertz needed more internal expertise and resources to execute such a massive undertaking and partner with a world-class technology services firm.\n\nAfter considering proposals from several top-tier candidates, Hertz narrowed the field of vendors to Accenture and one other.\n\nAssessment\n\nGood acquisition starts with understanding the business process for acquiring a solution. Hertz needed to have a 3rd party look after their interests. We play this role in ERP acquisitions for commercial and government clients.\n\nWhat were the selection criteria? Past Performance is the 1st question - have you done this before, and if so, were your efforts successful? Do you have a framework for the solution? In other words, are you building the website on a platform that has been shown to work and be?\n\nCourt Document\n\nAfter Accenture put on an impressive, one-day presentation for the Hertz team that demonstrated the transformed Hertz experience, Hertz selected Accenture to design, build, test, and deploy Hertz's new website and mobile applications.\n\nAssessment\n\nOne-day Presentations usually differ from the criteria for spending double-digit millions on a software project.\n\nFunding the development of a working skeleton, some type of reference model, or some other demonstration that the vendor can do what they say they can do is standard in our SW Intensive System of Systems world\n\nA mentor taught me a nice phrase when we were helping a large government nuclear and conventional power general agency acquire an extensive document management and design system (about the same dollar size as this). After listening to the one-day presentation, he said I see your work here is fully buzzword compliant. Can you show us (our firm and the client) where you have performed similar work, what changes will be needed from that work, and the cost and schedule impact of those changes?\n\nYes, Dorthey, the vendor, must provide some sort of credible estimate of the work based on a model of that work. SysML is a nice modeling language that can be used to produce cost and schedule estimates. SysML is a core requirement elicitation process used nearly everywhere we work through tools that can produce not only the system model but also the basis of estimates for that system. There are lots of SysML Tools.\n\nA function Point Analysis derived from the SysML model can also be used. Google will surely find you all you need to know about this approach.\n\nCourt Document\n\nBecause of Hertz's work with Accenture in the initial planning phases, Hertz trusted Accenture to lead the project and deliver websites and apps that met Hertz's business requirements.\n\nAssessment\n\n\"Trust but Verify\"—Henry Kissinger should always be the principle of managing any project. This axiom is the basis of all good project management. Where we work, all program management is based on Systems Engineering principles, where compliance with the needed Measures of Effectiveness and Measures of Performance of the needed business, technical, and operational Capabilities is assessed every month.\n\nA critical success factor for all projects is to ask and answer a simple question:\n\nHow long will you wait before you find out you are late?\n\nIf both parties didn't have a status reporting process that was one-half the distance between those times, they would lose control of the project. This is a foundational principle of program planning and controls, just as it is a principle of closed-loop control systems. It's the Nyquist rate of sampling the system at a sufficiently small interval to maintain control of the system.\n\nCourt Document\n\nHertz relied on Accenture’s claimed expertise in implementing such a digital transformation. Accenture served as the overall project manager, gathered Hertz’s requirements, and then developed a design to implement those requirements. Accenture served as the product owner, and Accenture, not Hertz, decided whether the design met Hertz’s requirements.\n\nAssessment\n\nBack to trust but verify. Where was the evidence that Accenture:\n\nHad you done this in the past?\n\nCould you do it in the future?\n\nWhat units of measure were used to perform this verification?\n\nGathering Requirements is a very tricky business.\n\nAre these requirements derived from a Capabilities-Based Plan? That is, did Hertz know what Capabilities they needed to possess to accomplish their business strategy before they started listing all the requirements? That begs the question, did Hertz have a Strategy for this project?\n\nCourt Document\n\nAccenture is committed to delivering an updated, redesigned, and re-engineered website and mobile apps ready to “go live” by December 2017.\n\nAssessment\n\nWhat was the risk-adjusted date? That is what schedule margin protected that date?\n\nWithout a credible schedule and cost margin, any date is suspect.\n\nTo develop that schedule margin a risk model is needed. One with reducible (epistemic) uncertainties and their handling strategies is placed in the Integrated Master Schedule.\n\nFor the irreducible uncertainties (Aleatory), a margin is needed. To develop that margin, a model of the network of activities showing what work drives what other work, what the statistical distributions are for that work, what coupling between all the work is present, what the impacts of each work activity on other work activities are present, and how all this comes together in an integrated risk management plan is needed.\n\nThis is standard practice in any mature project management process.\n\nRemember\n\nRisk Management is Project Management for Adults - Tim Lister\n\nThese risk management processes are well documented and have mature tools and standard processes. Applying them may have been the problem.\n\nCourt Document\n\nAccenture began working on the execution phase of the project in August 2016, and it continued to work until its services were terminated in May 2018. During that time, Hertz paid Accenture more than $32 million in fees and expenses. Accenture never delivered a functional website or mobile app. Because Accenture failed to manage and perform the services properly, the go-live date was postponed twice, first until January 2018 and then until April 2018. By then, Hertz no longer had any confidence that Accenture could complete the project, and Hertz terminated Accenture.\n\nAssessment\n\nWhat was the Physical Percent Complete on a monthly basis for this project? Better yet what was the Physical Percent Complete for the weekly progress to plan?\n\nWhen Accenture discovered it was falling behind schedule, did it take corrective and preventive actions to get back on schedule?\n\nWhy was this a surprise? This is a fundamental principle of all project management - NO SURPRISES!!!\n\nYou can be late, over budget, and have technical problems, but it can't be a surprise.\n\nCourt Document\n\nAccenture’s work was seriously deficient in multiple respects\n\nFor instance, the contract documents required Accenture to develop a responsive website – one that automatically scales content and elements to match the screen size of the device on which the website is viewed – with breakpoints for small (phone), medium (tablet), and large (desktop) displays.\n\nAccenture ignored the specification that called for a medium-sized layout and developed the website for only small and large breakpoints and demanded hundreds of thousands of dollars in additional fees to deliver the promised medium-sized layout.\n\nAssessment\n\nWhere was the Hertz program manager?\n\nWhy was Accenture allowed to proceed for a single day with noncompliant requirements?\n\nCourt Document\n\nAs another example, the Architecture Specifications for the Project expressly specified that a fundamental principle of the design of the website was its extensibility – that is, the use of a common core of libraries that could be extended across the websites and mobile apps for each of Hertz’s brands.\n\nWithout Hertz’s knowledge or approval, Accenture deliberately disregarded the extensibility requirement and wrote the code so that it was specific to the Hertz brand in North America and could not be used for the Hertz global brand or for the Dollar and Thrifty brands.\n\nAssessment\n\nExtensibility requires measures of effectiveness and performance to be defined BEFORE any work starts.\n\nThen, compliance with the MOEs and MOPs at every status review - one-month intervals at a minimum.\n\nIf they're using Agile every 2 to 3 weeks.\n\nCourt Document\n\nAccenture’s programming was also deficient. Its developers wrote the code for the customer-facing e-commerce website (the “front-end development” or “FED” code) in a way that created serious security vulnerabilities and performance problems.\n\nThe defects in the FED code were so pervasive that all of Accenture’s work on that component had to be scrapped. For other system components, substantial portions of the code were also unusable.\n\nAssessment\n\nWhere were Hertz's Program Manager and System Acceptance and Quality Validation team?\n\nCourt Document\n\nIn addition, Accenture failed to properly test the software it developed. Accenture did not perform tests on many components of the system, and when it did, the tests were seriously inadequate, to the point of being misleading.\n\nAssessment\n\nWhy?\n\nWhere are the Unit Test, System Acceptance, System Integration, and System production test plans and the weekly validation and verification that the deliverable software meets those specifications and continues to meet those specifications at every stage of the project through full production use?"
