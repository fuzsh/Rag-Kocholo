        "text": "HZ University of Applied Sciences\n\n5G-Blueprint partner HZ University of Applied Sciences is located in the South-West of the Netherlands. HZ offers high-quality study programs. Since 2011 – so for the past eleven years – HZ has been in the top three of Dutch multidisciplinary universities of applied sciences. As a university of applied sciences, HZ focuses on practice-based education and research opportunities. Its close cooperation with the business world, various research centers, and its global network of partner universities is of paramount importance. The students are encouraged to get the best out of themselves through personal development and the growth of knowledge.\n\nAs the provider of this course, the Supply Chain Innovation research group of HZ University of Applied Sciences, together with companies and governments in the region, is researching how innovations can make the logistics chains in Zeeland more efficient, more responsive, more sustainable, and more competitive.\n\nMOOC’s Introduction and Objectives\n\nNowadays, autonomy can be seen as an inevitable paradigm in the modern transportation and logistics sector. It is generally accepted that increased road capacity, traffic safety, and driving comfort can be seen as potential benefits of automation. Furthermore, when it comes to the logistics sector, resolving the problem of the ever-increasing driver shortage is a big advantage autonomy can bring. While the transportation sector was expected to undergo a massive change with the advent of fully autonomous vehicles (AVs), their widespread operation has not come true yet. Teleoperation can be seen as an intermediate step towards full autonomy in this respect.\n\nThe overall objective of the 5G-Blueprint project is to design and validate the technical architecture, business, and governance models for uninterrupted cross-border teleoperated transport based on 5G connectivity. The project’s outcome should be usable as the blueprint for subsequent operational pan-European deployment of teleoperated transport solutions in the logistics sector and beyond.\n\nOur objective is to develop an educational program that is to become directly available on a European scale by means of a Massive Open Online Course (MOOC). The MOOC will be freely available for students, professionals, and anybody interested in the logistics sector, and willing to deepen their knowledge about the application of autonomous vehicles in logistics.\n\nThe course will provide a comprehensive outlook on the relevant features, technological aspects, and characteristics of autonomous vehicles and their potential applications in logistics and will purvey tools helping to tackle the challenges that the application of AVs will bring.\n\nTarget Attendees\n\nThis course encompasses a broad range of participants, that may fall under one of the following profiles:\n\nStudents who are interested in mobility, logistics, supply chain management, etc.\n\nKnowledge and research institutes who are active in the area of logistics\n\nRoad authority and infrastructure planners who will be responsible for managing the integration of autonomous vehicles into the current system\n\nLogistics and terminal operators who will have to adapt their operations to the arrival of the AVs’\n\nAutomotive industry managers and OEMs who will integrate autonomous technology into their vehicles\n\nAny non-professionals who are interested in the application of autonomous vehicles in logistics\n\nNote: Participants are not required to have specific previous education in the AV field.\n\nCourse Format\n\nThe course consists of video lectures with accompanying slide sets, as well as complimentary optional reading material, and assignments. There will also be a discussion forum to get in touch with other students that can largely facilitate the interaction among involved attendees.\n\nCourse Syllabus\n\nThe course is comprised of three modules: Introduction to autonomous systems, Technology, and Teleoperation. Each of these modules contains several sub-modules as follows (please note some of the lecturers are yet to be confirmed, and will be announced soon):\n\n1. Introduction to autonomous systems\n\n1.1. Features of AVs\n\nMain characteristics of AGVs such as self-driving, self-awareness, and safety features\n\n1.2. State of the art\n\nThe state of the art on application of AGVS\n\n1.3. Advantages & disadvantages\n\nPros and Cons of applying AGVs\n\n1.4. Use cases\n\nDifferent use cases for the application of AGVs\n\n1.5. Intermediate steps toward full automation\n\nTeleoperation and platooning as short-term solutions for autonomy\n\nAssignment or Test\n\n2. Technology\n\n2.1. Localization\n\nLocalization of AVs, its importance, and methods\n\n2.2. Perception\n\nPerception of AVs, its importance, and requirements\n\n2.3. Prediction and routing\n\nThe way prediction and routing work for AVs\n\n2.4. Motion planning\n\nThe way motion planning works for AVs\n\nAssignment or Test\n\n3. Teleoperation\n\n3.1. Teleoperation on the road\n\nThe application of teleoperation in roadways\n\n3.2. Teleoperation of barges\n\nThe application of teleoperation on waterways\n\n3.3. 5G technology in teleoperation\n\nThe impact of 5G technology on teleoperation\n\n3.4. Business and Governance\n\nBusiness and governance aspects of teleoperation\n\nAttendance Certificates\n\nAttendees can get a certificate upon the completion of the course credited by the 5G-Blueprint project, provided that they complete all units and submit the assignments by the intended deadline. After the ending date of the 5G-Blueprint project, the course will be archived, which means that attendees can review the course content but can no longer participate in graded assignments or work towards earning a certificate (they can still get a confirmation of watching all educational content).\n\nLaunch and Timing\n\nYou can follow the course at your own pace, within a limited period of time: the course material will be available online from October 9, 2023 until December 1, 2023 via hz.learn.nl upon opening.\n\nREGISTRATION\n\nInterested in joining the course? You can easily enrol through the course’s official registration page.\n\nShare this"
