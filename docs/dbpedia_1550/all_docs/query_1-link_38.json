        "text": "I updated Audacity this morning to 3.3.0\n\nUpon doing so, I quickly realized that the Project Sample Rate that is normally in the bottom left has disappeared. I reset the toolbars to no avail. I’d appreciate some help.\n\nPlease restore the ability:\n\nto view the project sample rate in the bottom bar when audio isn’t playing (why only show it when audio is playing?); and\n\nideally restore the ability to change the project sample rate from the bottom bar.\n\nI take all sorts of clips of audio from all sorts of places (and thus sample rates), but the output always needs to be 44.1kHz. Now, not only have you made it more difficult to change the project sample rate, you’ve made it very easy to miss the fact that any audio I export will be at the wrong rate.\n\nEven better would be to have an option that allowed the project rate to be set to the default rate whenever an audio file is opened in Audacity and a new project created as a result.\n\nThanks.\n\nNigel\n\nIn older versions of Audacity, the reason that Audacity automatically changed the project rate to match the imported file was that many people use Audacity to edit a single file, and those people will invariably want to export with the same sample rate as the imported file.\n\nPersonally, I always thought that was a week argument because:\n\nIt was so easy to change the project rate\n\nA “default” should be “default” (not change unless explicitly changed)\n\nAlthough possibly a slight benefit (less clicks) for one subset of users, it was an inconvenience for other users.\n\nHowever, now that the project rate is hidden, I think that old argument becomes much stronger.\n\nYou can’t know what the project rate is unless you already know to click on a specific button and then select a specific option.\n\nAudacity now has both a default and non-default settings for the project rate in Preferences.\n\nIt is now equally inconvenient for everyone.\n\nI don’t understand why it was released “half done”. Wouldn’t it have been better to overhaul it, get it working, and check that it works as intended before releasing it?\n\nAll of Audacity is work in progress as things are getting refactored and made UI independent. It also is generally stable and doesn’t cause data losses, so I don’t see a reason to slap an eternal “beta” sticker on it for the next few years.\n\nThe new features aren’t necessarily fully polished yet and don’t handle some edge cases particularly well, sure. But they already enable workflows which are simply impossible in 2.4. If you don’t need these features because you’re content with your existing workflow, it’s totally fine to continue using 2.4.\n\nAgreed. Messing around with the toolbars etc. has been a massive time suck. I resorted to coming here after wasting an hour trying to work out how to change the sample rate for export.\n\nMy workflow is regulary.\n\nRecord side of a vinyl album to flac, sample rate 9600 (external to Audacity)\n\nImport saved Flac file in audacity, add labeles, noise reduction, etc.\n\nchange sample rate to 4800\n\nExport multiple to MP3 based on labels\n\nTag files with mp3 tag\n\nRecord other side of album\n\ngoto step 2.\n\nwith 3.3 I get an error “project sample rate not supported by MP3 file format” and the only thing I can do is set the sample rate per track as each track export returns an error. Please put back the old sample rate setting, just like the cut/copy/paste toolbar.\n\nI concur regarding the “vanished” project sample rate from the very bottom left side.\n\nI regularly record vinyl recordings by using an external application at 96kHz - 16Bit, when I covert them to mp3 format I choose 48kHz to get the best possible result (320kbps). Often I just need a 30 sec. audio clip, which select by copy and past from the original file into a new one by using the short cut + . The next step was, until the update to version 3.1.0, to set the project sample rate to my favorite rate. Suddenly I have to change my workflow which I used many many years. Annoying, really.\n\nNow I have to scroll up to the top left corner next to the audio file and click on the little converted black triangle to select the project sample rate I want.\n\nOn top of that, a window pops up forcing me to choose whether to copy the whole project or just the selected part. What good is that?\n\nAs if these problems weren’t enough, I found that the converted mp3 files would play at an extremely slow speed! When I had this problem 3 times in a row, I reinstalled the previous version (3.0.5) and everything went fine.\n\nI am using MS Windows 11 Pro\n\nStick with 3.3.0 - wait for the developers to complete this set of changes. Software development for long standing systems is always hard, almost ever change breaks something or some user interaction.\n\nThey put back the cut-paste toolbar, in this case they are re-designing a new feature that needs UI space. Let see what they finally do with the project rate and how it can be accessed.\n\nThere are lots of other recording tools, they often break things as well."
