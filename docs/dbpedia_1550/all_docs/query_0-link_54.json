        "text": "@kmin @Michael_H @Barbara @Birrgit\n\nMy name is Mabel, I am on the product team of a software company, a partner of Monday. Great to meet you, albeit virtually!\n\nWe’re conducting interviews to increase our understanding of the workarounds, pain points and your needs around sub-subitems. As active users of Monday, your experience is invaluable to us, and your feedback can help us create a solution for you, which is our ultimate goal!\n\nWould you be up for a 20-minute chat over Zoom? As a token of appreciation for your time and insight, we’re offering an incentive. If you’re interested to take part, please suggest a day and time that suits you and I’ll do my best to be available.\n\nYou can reach me out here or at mhernandez@adaptavist.com. Thank you!\n\nI have to vote on this and then get back to work finagling monday to do what I need it to do!\n\nThank you @timlittletech for the checklist idea - it might help for some use-cases, but not very reportable, and would be hard to automate with. (I’m thinking of progress indicators here like 7/10 checkboxes means this subitem is 70% done.)\n\nThe way subitems seem to be handled, IMHO, needs a lot of thought. (Only three automations come up as as a suggestion, and you can’t build your own having subitems are just some of the examples.)\n\nLinking the boards isn’t a practical option in the long run either. It becomes very hard to build a template to roll-out a new project where you have to create a ton of links between boards just to get them to work, it almost defeats the purpose of having the templates, other than you have consistent shells each time.\n\nThere are many times that you need to have sub-subitems. If anyone has managed staff before, you can most likely name two past (or present) employees that are on the opposite ends: one you can tell “put on your shoes,” and the other that needs “place left foot into left shoe, tighten laces on left shoe, tie left shoe…” The task of putting on your shoes is already part of the task “prepare to go outside,” so where do you put those detailed instructions? (I’m sorry if you live in an area where you just put on sandals and head out to the beach - I’m jealous and won’t help you! )\n\nThis may be a simplistic example, but there are many real-world applications that require steps deeper than just a subitem or subtask. The example used in PCs for example, could also be extended. The days of just a monitor, terminal and keyboard are long gone. A PC has several components to it, and can have several accessories attached. This would end up creating spaghetti-lookups, and much like spaghetti-code, is not ideal. (Now I’m hungry and have to get back to work!)\n\ntldr; We need more than just the one subitem level, but could probably adapt to monday much easier if you could do more with the subitems, or at least had sub-subitems.\n\nHi Mabel, I’m looking to switch a team of about 125 users from a custom FileMaker Pro system (process tracking hybrid board system) to a new system built in Monday.com (if our test phase works well, we could move up to 400 employees over).\n\nThe biggest obstacle I seem to be running into is the current limitations found in the “Subitem” column. It’s really important that this column be editable to a different kind of column such as a pull down, etch and that it can link to a separate item from another board.\n\nJust a totally random example here for demonstration, but say we are working in Board 1 called “Upload Packages” and the “items” are all Packages with specific names.\n\nIn Board 2, called “Delivery Files,” the Items are a list of all movie files have been or will be delivered to our executives for review.\n\nWhat is needed in Board 1/Packages, is for the users be able to create a subitem under Packages items and select from a list of the client delivery files / items from Board 2 (linked), if that makes sense?\n\nCurrently, it seems that I can’t link the first column called “Subitem” in the Subitem spin-down section to “Items” from other tables/boards (you can only enter random text there). I can however link second column but (!) I’m stuck with that random text field to the left. The biggest problem with that Subitem column being text (and not linkable) is that we are needing our users to never add random/unique text in the subitem section, especially in such an important slot (most every selection a user must make is from multiple choices / pulldowns for efficiency and human error reduction) so that text (which must be filled with something and can not be left blank) would become a big problem. I see there’s some other web based systems that allow for this the same way Filemaker does but I prefer Monday currently.\n\nIs there any way tho that I’m not seeing yet where I can this happen?\n\nI would love subitems under subitems as well but I would definitely want subitem linking set up first.\n\nThank you!"
