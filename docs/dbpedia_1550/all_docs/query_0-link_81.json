The EMF Project encourages focused research to fill important gaps in knowledge and to facilitate the development of internationally acceptable standards limiting EMF exposure.\n\nKey objectives of the Project are to:\n\nprovide a coordinated international response to concerns about possible health effects of exposure to EMF,\n\nassess the scientific literature and make a status report on health effects,\n\nidentify gaps in knowledge needing further research to make better health risk assessments,\n\nencourage a focused research programme in conjunction with funding agencies,\n\nincorporate the research results into WHO's Environmental Health Criteria monographs where formal health risk assessments will be made on exposure to EMF,\n\nfacilitate the development of internationally acceptable standards for EMF exposure,\n\nprovide information on the management of EMF protection programmes for national and other authorities, including monographs on EMF risk perception, communication and management, and\n\nprovide advice to national authorities, other institutions, the general public and workers, about any hazards resulting from EMF exposure and any needed mitigation measures."
