        "text": "A common mistake we see founders make is to hire the 𝗿𝗶𝗴𝗵𝘁 𝗽𝗲𝗿𝘀𝗼𝗻 𝗮𝘁 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝘄𝗿𝗼𝗻𝗴 𝘁𝗶𝗺𝗲. It happens for any function. Recently, I was discussing with an early-stage entrepreneur his plan to hire a product person. They considered a former colleague who was excellent but very senior. But something felt off and they eventually decided to go for a junior profile - typically the right move. Here’s why: In a company's early days, the product vision originates from the founder. The founder needs to stay as close to the customer as possible, minimizing intermediaries. The two biggest risks of hiring a senior product person at an early-stage company: 1. Creating a screen between the founder and the end user 2. Introducing a different product vision that may be at odds with the founder’s The risk is even greater when that senior hire comes from a large tech company where their responsibilities are more focused on process and management rather than first-hand product building. Instead, start with a more junior hire, ideally with a technical orientation, like this entrepreneur ultimately did. And steadily delegate product leadership over time. How do you know when it’s time to delegate? For most founders, directly overseeing product gets more challenging with scale. More and more feature requests and priorities start coming from your GTM team. Your PM team starts growing and needing day-to-day supervision and professional development. In Scaling Through Chaos, we outlined the four phases of delegating product leadership and more things to consider so you hire the right person at the right time — including some exceptions to this advice. I’ll link directly to that section in the comments. The chart below, showing the most senior product leader at software companies for each headcount stage, can also be helpful to benchmark how the very best tech companies levelled their product org over time."
