        "text": "This graphic explains the difference between certifications.\n\nThe ASPCA has identified three independent and meaningful welfare certification programs that ban unacceptable factory farming practices and provide a better life for animals through their standards and farm audits: Animal Welfare Approved, Certified Humane, and Global Animal Partnership. These certifications’ standards range from raising animals indoors with added enrichments, which the ASPCA considers to be baseline for better animal care, to outdoor access where animals have access to more space, fresh air, and sunlight, to pasture raised where animals have reliable access to space and growing vegetation – generally the highest welfare farming model.\n\nThe below chart shows where the ASPCA-recognized certifications fall with respect to these three types of higher welfare farming. Note that some certifications have multiple levels, different meanings for different species*. Some are strengthened by the presence of additional claims or certifications on the package, including Certified Grassfed by AGW (A Greener World) as an optional addition to Animal Welfare Approved or the Better Chicken Project for Global Animal Partnership certified chicken products. To learn more, visit www.aspca.org/labelguide.\n\nInformation about this search engine\n\n“Where to buy” information is kept up-to-date by individual companies; please contact the store or seller directly to confirm product availability.\n\n*The ASPCA does not audit farms or ranches and instead relies on independent animal welfare certifications as the basis for evaluating different food brands in the marketplace. The animals’ housing environment is designated on Shop With Your Heart as Indoors with Enrichments, having Outdoor Access, or Pasture Raised based on the highest animal welfare distinction the food brand/product achieves from any one of the meaningful programs we recognize. At this time, Certified Humane does not have free range or pasture standards for pork production, pasture standards for turkey, or grass-fed/pasture standards for goats or sheep. We encourage Certified Humane to build out these distinctions in their program to enhance animal welfare, advance transparency in the marketplace, and reward farmers and ranches that achieve this level of animal care. The default environment for products from dairy and beef cattle, bison, sheep (lamb), and goats is Outdoor Access as these animals are never confined indoors.\n\n** These items feature an animal welfare certification logo on product packaging when delivered but not on its online order page. If you receive this product without the certification logo, please contact us at [email protected].\n\nThe ASPCA's position on chicken breeds\n\nAWA and G.A.P. Step 4-5+ currently require the use of chicken breeds that intrinsically have higher welfare than industrial breeds, which can suffer due to their genetics. As of 2024, Shop With Your Heart will only recognize chicken-welfare certifications and brands that require better breeds.\n\nShop With Your Heart Logo Use – Terms and Conditions\n\nCompanies/Farms listed here [on the SWYH grocery or farm list] may contact the ASPCA at FarmAnimalWelfare[at]aspca.org for a version of the Shop With Your Heart (SWYH) logo that may be used SOLELY on the company's website and/or social media pages to signify inclusion on this list. The logo may only be used in conjunction with the following language: “[product/farm name] is certified by [Certified Humane/AWA/G.A.P.2+] and appears on the ASPCA®'s list of certified farms/products.” The ASPCA reserves the right to revoke the use of the Shop With Your Heart (SWYH) logo at any time.\n\nNote: This list is provided for informational purposes only and is believed to be accurate as of the time posted. Listing of a welfare certification or brand does not mean that there is any affiliation or endorsement between the ASPCA® and the listed company. The ASPCA makes no representation or warranty whatsoever regarding any certification program or brand listed above, and you agree to hold the ASPCA harmless from any and all claims based on the information set forth herein.\n\nPlease contact us at [email protected] if we have missed a company or product that should be on this list."
