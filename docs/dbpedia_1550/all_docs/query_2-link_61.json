        "text": "SmartDelta builds automated solutions for quality assessment of product deltas in a continuous engineering environment by providing smart analytics from development artifacts and system execution, offering insights into quality improvements or degradation of different product versions, and providing recommendations for next builds.\n\nThe development of quantum algorithms, potentially exponentially faster than classical algorithms, is attracting widespread interest in business and science. To implement these algorithms in accessible and user-friendly quantum programming the project “Qompiler - Standardized Quantum Software Stack” a software stack with a higher-level quantum programming language is being developed.\n\nArtificial intelligence (AI) is being treated as a key technology that can make cars drive intelligently and autonomously, supply chains easier to plan, production processes more efficient, and thus achieve sustainability goals. However, legal-ethical issues, data protection, and resilience also play a role in the use of AI. The SPATIAL (Security and Privacy Accountable Technology Innovations, Algorithms, and Machine Learning) project, which has now been launched, aims to answer questions relating to trustworthy AI.\n\nIn the EXPAND+ER WB³ project, the vision of educator Otto Herz is applied to the field of vocational education. The technology partners of the BMBF-funded EXPAND+ER WB³ project develop a scalable platform that protects privacy and enables users to search for and receive recommendations for further education courses.\n\nThe IML4E project has therefore brought together companies from the main sectors of the European software industry to develop a European framework for the development, operation and maintenance of AI-based software to ensure the development of intelligent services and intelligent software on an industrial scale.\n\nThe KI-LOK project, therefore, aims to develop new test procedures and methods for safeguarding and certifying AI-supported technologies for safety-critical applications in railroad technology.\n\nIn the SANDMAN project, Fraunhofer FOKUS has developed an AI based predictive maintenance solution for smart pipes able to detect potential leakages and their corresponding positions in time.\n\nKYKLOS 4.0 aims to develop an innovative Circular Manufacturing ecosystem based on novel CPS (Circular Production System) and AI (Artificial Intelligence) technologies, enhanced with novel production mechanisms and algorithms, targeting personalized products with extended life cycle and promoting energy efficient and low material consumption intra-factory production processes, resulting in reduced greenhouse gas emissions and air pollutants."
