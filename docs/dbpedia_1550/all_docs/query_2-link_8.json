        "text": "Sometimes it may only be small things, but ultimately it‚Äôs always the gesture that counts. For example, they offer free drinks for all employees at our company. And every now and then, the boss even treats us to a meal at meetings. As service technicians, we also get a modern smartphone and a well-equipped VW Golf station wagon, which we are also allowed to use privately.\n\nThe work is also very varied. No two days are the same. There are always new challenges. I like that! (raises thumb)\n\nI‚Äôm sure you‚Äôve already experienced a lot with us. What was or is your personal highlight?\n\nMy first assignment in fault service. It was a great feeling to have managed to fix the really complex fault on the elevator on my own.\n\nAnother highlight: our summer party last year. A great atmosphere and delicious food fresh from the grill ‚Äì and the boss didn‚Äôt miss the opportunity to stand behind the grill himself. That was great!\n\nHave you always wanted to be what you are?\n\nMechanics and electronics have fascinated me since I was a teenager. I find it exciting to understand machines and the interaction of the electronics behind them. At the same time, I like working with people. That‚Äôs exactly why I completed an apprenticeship as a retail salesman and mechatronics technician after leaving school. This experience also helps me now when dealing with customers and repairing elevators.\n\nWhere can you relax best?\n\nWalking and hiking. I live in beautiful Falkensee. There are plenty of opportunities to get out into nature and really switch off. ‚Äì A blessing! (smiles)\n\nWhat would you do with 5 million euros?\n\nI would invest in my own property. This would provide for my old age. At the same time, I would also go on unforgettable vacations. I‚Äôm particularly fond of the sea. I would have no shortage of destinations! (laughs)\n\nYou must have experienced a lot in all your years at HERZ Elevators. What has been the most extraordinary task you have mastered so far?\n\nOh, there are a lot of things. Because every elevator is different. Our ever-changing challenges are just as varied. The good thing is that each of our service technicians has special strengths. I am aware of these and therefore always find the right employee for particularly tricky tasks.\n\nHave you always wanted to be what you are?\n\nLet‚Äôs put it this way: I‚Äôve always been good at organizing and coordinating. I also like working with nice people. (smiles) So, I feel very comfortable with my work at HERZ Elevators!\n\nWhere you can relax best?\n\nThe location is not important to me. The main thing is that I have nice people around me. Ultimately, it doesn‚Äôt matter whether I‚Äôm sitting around a barbecue in the garden with friends or enjoying the sun and beach by the sea with my family. ‚Äì It always depends on the people.\n\nWhat would you do with 5 million euros?\n\nI live with my family in a nice house with a garden on the northern outskirts of Berlin. I would use some of the money to pay off the property and house completely. Apart from that, I don‚Äôt have to live the high life. It‚Äôs important to me that my family and friends are doing well. I would therefore let them share in my prosperity and also donate some money. I would continue to work. Because that gives me pleasure!\n\nWhat was the most unusual task you have mastered so far?\n\nMoving new drives into the engine room using chain hoists. This doesn‚Äôt happen every day and is physically very demanding. The drives have a lot of weight and value. They have to be handled with particular care and sometimes with a little improvisation skill.\n\nHave you always wanted to be what you are?\n\nMy heart beats for both craftsmanship and social work. I opted for the former and completed an apprenticeship as an electrician. After a few years in this job, however, I was looking for a bit more variety ‚Äì and found it in the elevator industry. I‚Äôve been working there for 8 years now. In between, I spent 10 months traveling the world in Southeast Asia. I traveled through 6 countries, from Vietnam to Cambodia to Laos. It was a great time! It was very exciting to see how people live in really simple conditions, make do with little and yet are so content. We would have gone on to Canada for Work & Travel. Unfortunately, the coronavirus pandemic was a showstopper. And now I‚Äôm delighted to have joined the HERZ Elevators team.\n\nWhere can you relax best?\n\nI regularly go to CrossFit. It‚Äôs like a reboot for me. And of course, I also love being on the beach on vacation. With my feet in the sea and a cocktail in my hand. That‚Äôs the way to live üòâ\n\nWhat would you do with 5 million euros?\n\nWith 5 million? First of all, I would give my family a carefree life. I would also emigrate to Thailand with my girlfriend: Tropical beaches in the south, mountains and forests in the north and very friendly people. Thailand is not called the land of smiles for nothing. I know the country well from my trip around the world. Yes, it has already become my second home.\n\nWhat was the most unusual task you have mastered so far?\n\nIn bitterly cold temperatures of -4 ¬∞C, we changed the rotating ropes outside. We needed around 5 liters of tea to stay warm. (smiles) Our advantage: whatever the weather, we at HERZ Elevators are really well equipped in terms of clothing. On my very first day at work, I was given the full kit: T-shirts, underwear, flowing jacket, outer jacket, pants‚Ä¶ To be honest, I‚Äôve never received so much clothing in my entire working life.\n\nWhere can you relax best?\n\nWith my wife and two small children. We live right next to the Schlosspark in Charlottenburg. It‚Äôs a wonderful place to spend your free time.\n\nAnd of course also in my home country, Croatia. Both my parents and my parents-in-law live there. Celebrating birthdays in a large family circle is always something very special.\n\nWhat would you do with 5 million euros?\n\nOh, that‚Äôs not so easy to say. First of all, I would make sure that my children have a financially carefree life ahead of them. I would also build two houses in Croatia: One near Zagreb, close to my parents, and the other by the sea.\n\nWhat did you do professionally before you came to us?\n\nI am an electrician by trade. I worked as a facility manager and service technician for a long time. After that, I worked as a technical property manager in the administration department. That often involved a lot of commuting throughout Germany. Now I‚Äôm delighted to be able to contribute my many years of experience to HERZ Elevators and to have a good balance between work and leisure.\n\nHave you always wanted to be what you are?\n\nI‚Äôve always been myself. And that‚Äôs a good thing üòâ\n\nWhere can you relax best?\n\nWith my loved ones and with my music. I play drums and bass in two bands. If you want to listen to my German rock band: search for ‚Äú5 Volt Band‚Äù on YouTube.\n\nWhat would you do with 5 million euros?\n\nEmigrate! To the north. To Norway or Finland, for example. I like the Nordic landscape and the calmness of the people. I would set up my own music studio there.\n\nWhat I like about elevators is that our challenges are not only technically very demanding, but also have to comply with numerous standards, laws and regulations. That makes our work very interesting! But it‚Äôs also extremely varied. Every customer is different, every project is different. You can really have fun here, but you always have to ‚Äúkeep the lights on‚Äù. Because there is hardly any routine.\n\nAnother little anecdote: When I started at HERZ Elevators, I first wanted to get a feel for what it‚Äôs really like out in the field working for customers. The advantage of this is that you have a different view of things afterwards and are aware of the challenges of everyday life. So I went straight into the field with my colleagues. And what can I say: after just a few days, I had damaged my first control unit. My heart rate shot up considerably, because a control unit like that costs at least ‚Ç¨2,500. When I ‚Äúconfessed‚Äù to Managing Director Sebastian Frenzel over the phone, I wasn‚Äôt expecting anything good. But the opposite was the case. He said casually and with a wink: ‚ÄúThe fact that you fell on your a*** was worth the ‚Ç¨2,500 to me‚Äù. The very next day, he turned up with a new control unit, which we installed together until shortly before midnight. I will never forget that! Because it showed me that we have the full backing of the management, even in tricky situations.\n\nWhat was the most unusual task you have mastered so far?\n\nJumping in at the deep end on day one. We went to Frankfurt / Oder. We had a truly mammoth project there. We had to completely overhaul a number of freight elevators that were really getting on in years. There‚Äôs no question that we faced some major challenges there. But we overcame them all. They have been working perfectly ever since. And for me, it was a chance to find out right away: What is not yet running perfectly? What can we do even better?\n\nHave you always wanted to be what you are?\n\nI‚Äôve always enjoyed working with my hands. That‚Äôs why we bought a house in Erkner a few years ago and have since renovated a lot of things ourselves. I really enjoy my work.\n\nWhere can you relax best?\n\nIn my own garden in Erkner. My two daughters can romp around there. And I can sometimes really relax with a cold drink. (winks)\n\nWhat would you do with 5 million euros?\n\nFirst of all, I would make sure that my two daughters would not have to worry about material things in life. I would also buy a small house for my family and myself on the sunny island of Kos in Greece. Initially this would be our second home, and later perhaps even our retirement home. Because I like the friendliness and light-heartedness of the Greeks.\n\nHave you always wanted to be what you are?\n\nNo, I originally wanted to become a pathologist. I always found medical analysis and diagnostics fascinating. Nevertheless, I ultimately decided to train as a paralegal and notary‚Äôs assistant. Looking back, this was the right decision for me. Even though I no longer work in a law firm, but in the extremely exciting elevator industry.\n\nWhere you can relax best?\n\nFor sure: preferably on a long walk on the beach with my dog Rosa, a white French bulldog. A day at the sunny North Sea (preferably in St. Peter-Ording) is just as relaxing for me as a whole week‚Äôs vacation. I am and always will be a coastal child. I originally come from Gl√ºcksburg (Baltic Sea), right on the border with Denmark.\n\nWhat would you do with 5 million euros?\n\nTraveling the world and discovering new scenic spots. I would also treat myself to a VW bulli and distribute some of the money to my family and friends. I would also donate a large sum to animal welfare, as this is a matter close to my heart.\n\nWhat was the most unusual task you have mastered so far?\n\nTogether with a colleague, we had to fish a small object out of an 8 (!) meter deep pipe. That was quite a challenge! It required patience, skill and a steady hand. So we celebrated all the more when we actually succeeded.\n\nHave you always wanted to be what you are?\n\nBasically yes. I‚Äôve enjoyed manual work from an early age. That‚Äôs exactly why I worked as a automotive mechatronics technician for a long time. At HERZ Elevators, the tasks are technically demanding and very varied. I like that!\n\nWhere can you relax best?\n\nWith my family. On tour with my motorcycle, a Suzuki GSX-R 1000, and with friends ‚Äì preferably in the garden when the weather is nice.\n\nWhat would you do with 5 million euros?\n\nI‚Äôd nevertheless continue to work. Because I like working. I would buy my parents a house. I would buy a Ducati sports bike, the magnificent Panigale V4 R. I would also buy a small apartment with a garden. And, if there‚Äôs anything left over, a nice caravan with a motorcycle trailer.\n\nSometimes you need a second opinion for a tricky case or an extra pair of hands for an on-site repair. It‚Äôs good to know that you can rely on your colleagues.\n\nThe equipment is also top notch! We have good tools and modern vehicles.\n\nYou must have experienced a lot in all your years at HERZ Elevators. What has been the most extraordinary task you have mastered so far?\n\nHmmm‚Ä¶ (ponders) It‚Äôs difficult to pin that down to just one task. After all, it‚Äôs always a good feeling to get the sometimes somewhat outdated and often particularly complicated elevator technology up and running again after malfunctions. Sometimes this requires a real detective‚Äôs instinct.\n\nHave you always wanted to be what you are?\n\nI‚Äôve always wanted to work in a skilled trade, which is why I decided to train as an elevator fitter.\n\nWhat do you like to do most in your free time?\n\nEnjoying time with my grandchildren. Spending the weekend with my wife, family and friends in a small village in Mecklenburg. I also enjoy fishing, canoeing and wandering through the woods.\n\nWhat would you do with 5 million euros?\n\nHave it first! And then we‚Äôll see.\n\nWhat has been the most extraordinary task you have mastered so far?\n\nI have no shortage of unusual tasks. On the contrary: troubleshooting requires not only a lot of patience, but often also creativity in narrowing down the problem. After all, there are practically countless potential sources of error.\n\nMy personal challenge was working at height. When you look down from the 10th floor, you do have a certain amount of respect. The good thing is that you get used to it. And when in doubt, respect is definitely good for safety.\n\nHave you always wanted to be what you are?\n\nLet‚Äôs put it this way: I‚Äôve always liked working with my hands. And technically demanding tasks have always appealed to me. I benefit from both today. So yes, I am very satisfied. And I‚Äôm not only happy to have interesting work, but also great colleagues.\n\nWhere can you relax best?\n\nTaking a nap on the couch with my children. (laughs) Otherwise, I like nature and my garden. I enjoy walking around Alt-Landsberg with my Labrador retriever. I also have a nice hobby workshop in my house. I recently restored a VW Beetle built in ‚Äô70 myself. This was not only a big topic for me, but also for my two children. My son now also has a Mini Beetle that we built ourselves as an electric vehicle. The speed can be controlled via its radio. The vehicle even has its own car horn. (smiles)\n\nWhat would you do with 5 million euros?\n\nClearly: vacation. And a lot of it. First with my wife and children, because I‚Äôm a family person through and through. I find Japan exciting. I like the culture there and the friendliness of the people.\n\nIf there is still time, I would like to go on a sailing trip on the Atlantic. Once to the Canary Islands and back again in about two weeks. That would be great. But maybe I would take out life insurance first. (winks)\n\nWhat‚Äôs more, at HERZ Elevators we all work as equals and receive a lot of appreciation. Our Managing Director, Mr. Frenzel, is a very sociable person and always has an open ear. He is always on hand with help and advice when things get tricky. He is also always open to suggestions for improvement. Everyone has the opportunity to think along, have a say and contribute their own ideas. An example of this? A colleague recently mentioned that the tool bags were a bit bulky and therefore difficult to transport. The management picked up on this straight away and very quickly purchased a new bag system for us.\n\nBasically, everything is very uncomplicated for us. I really appreciate that!\n\nYou must have experienced a lot in all your years at HERZ Elevators. What has been the most extraordinary task you have mastered so far?\n\nWe recently modernized the elevator system of an older industrial building. This system had a really powerful traction sheave (this is the rope carrier of the elevator system) and a very heavy motor. We needed a heavy-duty crane to dismantle the parts. It was used to transport the parts down from the engine room, which is located on the roof. That was a real feat of strength! (wipes the sweat from his forehead and smiles)\n\nHave you always wanted to be what you are?\n\nTo be honest, it was more of a coincidence. Even though I‚Äôve always enjoyed working with my hands. I‚Äôve also always enjoyed tinkering with tricky technical challenges. So, I‚Äôve come to the right place! (smiles with satisfaction)\n\nWhere do you relax best? What is your favorite place?\n\nWith my family and friends. I really enjoy sitting together in the garden and having a good chat.\n\nWhat would you do with 5 million euros?\n\nDefinitely keep working. (laughs) I would buy the land we live on. I would also buy a house for my parents. And of course I would throw a big company party. That would be a point of honor. (winks and laughs)\n\nWhat‚Äôs more, elevators are a matter of trust. Our customers appreciate the fact that we always communicate openly, honestly and transparently and put our heart and soul into our work.\n\nAnd within our company? It‚Äôs a give and take. Of course we work overtime from time to time, but we can always take it off. That‚Äôs fair!\n\nYou must have experienced a lot in all these years at HERZ Elevators. What was or is your personal highlight?\n\nIt‚Äôs always an incredibly great feeling when I and my colleagues succeed in making our customers happy. It‚Äôs worth going the extra mile for that.\n\nHave you always wanted to be what you are?\n\nI like working with my hands and appreciate the direct contact with customers. I enjoy both developing solutions and advising customers as well as getting hands-on. So, HERZ Aufz√ºge is the right place for me. (smiles) Looking back, it was actually the best career decision I could have made after my time in the army. Because when I joined, the company was still relatively small. So I was able to make a significant contribution to building it up.\n\nWhere you can relax best?\n\nIn my garage. I am a passionate mechanic. Whether on my motorcycle or my car, there‚Äôs always something to do. And with my friends. Relaxing together on the terrace or having a barbecue in the garden at the end of the day is something special.\n\nWhat would you do with 5 million euros?\n\nI would buy a property for my family. In beautiful Brandenburg, perhaps in Hoppegarten. I like living in the countryside and appreciate the peace and quiet. Any stress usually falls away by itself.\n\nYou must have experienced a lot as a service technician at HERZ Elevators. What has been the most unusual task you have mastered so far?\n\nThis was a troubleshooting job on an elevator that the previous maintenance company had tried and failed at. It was an incorrect configuration of the control package and an induction voltage in the control system.\n\nHave you always wanted to be what you are?\n\nAs my father was very successful in the elevator industry himself, I was ‚Äúborn into it‚Äù. His love for this profession meant that I no longer had to ask myself what I wanted to do for a living.\n\nWhat are your professional goals?\n\nBringing elevator technology to the next generation and making it interesting. We need to invest in the next generation. By this I mean, above all, passing on experience as well as tips and tricks to build up self-confidence and passion for the profession.\n\nWhat‚Äôs more, the working atmosphere is great! The colleagues are like a family and stick together. Just one small example: It‚Äôs the weekend. I‚Äôm on emergency duty. A fault occurs in one of the elevators we maintain. This turns out to be a bit trickier. To solve it quickly, I can always call a colleague who last worked on the system and ask for advice. It doesn‚Äôt matter that it‚Äôs long past closing time or the weekend. That‚Äôs exactly what I mean by team spirit.\n\nYou must have experienced a lot in all your years at HERZ Elevators. What has been the most extraordinary task you have mastered so far?\n\nThere have been some tough nuts to crack. Because elevator technology is extremely complex. There is no shortage of new challenges (winks).\n\nHave you always wanted to be what you are?\n\nNo! (Laughs) Elevators weren‚Äôt even on my radar until a few years ago. But what I have always enjoyed is math and physics. Originally, I even wanted to become a teacher for these two subjects. In the end, however, I opted for the practical side and did an apprenticeship as an electrician. Looking back, that was a good decision. Because thanks to the variety of tasks, it never gets boring (smiles).\n\nWhere you can relax best?\n\nOn the beach. No matter where. The main thing is an azure blue sea, plenty of sun in the sky and fine sand under your feet.\n\nWhat would you do with 5 million euros?\n\nI would invest the money well and buy a nice apartment or even a house here in Berlin. Even if I became rich, I would still continue to work. Because I like working, it‚Äôs good for me (laughs).\n\nAnother big advantage is that we have a boss, Sebastian Frenzel, who has an incredible amount of experience in elevator technology himself. I also got to know HERZ Elevators through him. At the time, I was still a facility manager at a real estate management company at Tempelhofer Hafen. HERZ Elevators was responsible for the maintenance of some of our elevators. I liked their highly professional approach right from the start.\n\nYou must have experienced a lot in all your years at HERZ Elevators. What has been the most extraordinary task you have mastered so far?\n\nActually, the tasks are extraordinary every day (smiles). I had a particularly exciting project in Frankfurt (Oder). There, we almost completely rebuilt an elevator in an old industrial complex. Apart from the rails and the counterweight, there was nothing left.\n\nI always find historic elevators fascinating. They are often still fitted with wooden rails. That really has a face! (nods appreciatively)\n\nHave you always wanted to be what you are?\n\nI have always enjoyed manual work. I‚Äôm also very interested in electrics. That‚Äôs exactly why I originally trained as an energy electronics technician. This knowledge and the ability to read circuit diagrams still helps me today in the maintenance and repair of elevators.\n\nWhere do you relax best? What is your favorite place?\n\nWith my family. In the hobby cellar, working on my Honda CBR. And at Liepnitzsee. We are permanent campers and always spend lovely days on the island in summer. That‚Äôs pure relaxation!\n\nWhat would you do with 5 million euros?\n\nI would definitely share the money generously with my family. ‚Äì And buy a nice house with a plot of land in the countryside."
