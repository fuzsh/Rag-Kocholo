Subjects with sinus rhythm and without known cardiovascular disease or diabetes were included. RHR was assessed from a resting ECG at study visit in 1985–1986. VO2Max was determined by the Åstrand bicycle ergometer test in 1970–1971. Subjects were classified into categories according to level of RHR. Associations with mortality were studied in multivariate Cox models adjusted for physical fitness, leisure-time physical activity and conventional cardiovascular risk factors.\n\nResults 2798 subjects were followed for 16 years. 1082 deaths occurred. RHR was inversely related to physical fitness (p<0.001). Overall, increasing RHR was highly associated with mortality in a graded manner after adjusting for physical fitness, leisure-time physical activity and other cardiovascular risk factors. Compared to men with RHR ≤50, those with RHR >90 had an HR (95% CI) of 3.06 (1.97 to 4.75). With RHR as a continuous variable, risk of mortality increased with 16% (10–22) per 10 beats per minute (bpm). There was a borderline interaction with smoking (p=0.07); risk per 10 bpm increase in RHR was 20% (12–27) in smokers, and 14% (4–24) in non-smokers.\n\nConclusions Elevated RHR is a risk factor for mortality independent of physical fitness, leisure-time physical activity and other major cardiovascular risk factors.",

        "text": "Discussion\n\nIn the present study of healthy middle-aged men, the main finding was that resting heart rate was a risk factor for mortality independent of physical fitness (VO2Max) and other major potential confounders.\n\nResting heart rate as a risk factor for mortality has received considerable attention in recent years. However, a concern has been whether elevated resting heart rate is merely a surrogate marker of poor physical fitness, which in turn is associated with poor prognosis. A high level of physical fitness is a strong predictor of longevity11 and is associated with lower heart rate, as also demonstrated in the present study. Level of physical fitness therefore plays a pivotal role in the study of resting heart rate. In a study from the Paris Prospective Study, resting heart rate was predictive of mortality and especially sudden death after adjusting for duration of exercise.24 However, the main body of studies use self-reported levels of physical activity22 ,25 or, in some cases, include no information.26 In the current study, all subjects underwent a physical exercise test and estimation of VO2Max as well as an assessment of leisure-time physical activity; we found that irrespective of level of physical fitness subjects with high resting heart rates fare worse than subjects with lower heart rates. This suggests that a high resting heart rate is not a mere marker of poor physical fitness but is an independent risk factor.\n\nThere were more smokers in the low heart rate categories than in the higher heart rate categories. Although the acute effects of smoking are tachycardia and increase in BP, healthy smokers are more likely to have lower BP than non-smokers; this has been shown in numerous studies,27–29 and the same mechanisms may explain the observation in the present study. The possible mechanisms are at least twofold and probably pertinent to heart rate as well: first, it represents a counter-regulatory physiological response to the acute rise in BP and heart rate following smoking; and second, the healthy worker effect probably plays a role—smokers in the present study are healthier, leaner and more fit than non-smokers; they can ‘endure’ the smoking.\n\nInterestingly, we found a borderline significant interaction between resting heart rate, smoking and mortality, which suggests that high heart rate at any given resting heart rate level is associated with greater risk in smokers than in non-smokers. In a study from the Copenhagen City Heart Study,23 resting heart rate was a stronger predictor of all-cause mortality among smokers than among non-smokers, which is in line with results from the present study. That this relationship can be found in two different large cohorts adds to the evidence that a true relationship may exist and not simply be a random association. Considering that the number of smokers globally is about 1 billion,30 this is yet another argument for preventive measures against tobacco consumption and might have therapeutic implications in terms of heart rate monitoring and perhaps modification in smokers."
