        "text": "Kalibr is a toolbox that solves the following calibration problems:\n\nMulti-Camera Calibration: Intrinsic and extrinsic calibration of a camera-systems with non-globally shared overlapping fields of view with support for a wide range of camera models.\n\nVisual-Inertial Calibration (CAM-IMU): Spatial and temporal calibration of an IMU w.r.t a camera-system along with IMU intrinsic parameters\n\nMulti-Inertial Calibration (IMU-IMU): Spatial and temporal calibration of an IMU w.r.t a base inertial sensor along with IMU intrinsic parameters (requires 1-aiding camera sensor).\n\nRolling Shutter Camera Calibration: Full intrinsic calibration (projection, distortion and shutter parameters) of rolling shutter cameras.\n\nTo install follow the install wiki page instructions for which you can either use Docker or install from source in a ROS workspace. Please find more information on the wiki pages of this repository. For questions or comments, please open an issue on Github.\n\nNews / Events\n\nNov 24, 2022 - Some new visualization of trajectory and IMU rate for the generated report along with fixed support for exporting poses to file (see PR #578,#581,#582)\n\nMay 3, 2022 - Support for Ubuntu 20.04 along with Docker scripts have been merged into master via PR #515. A large portion was upgrading to Python 3. A special thanks to all the contributors that made this possible. Additionally, contributed fixes for the different validation and visualization scripts have been merged.\n\nFebuary 3, 2020 - Initial Ubuntu 18.04 support has been merged via PR #241. Additionally, support for inputting an initial guess for focal length can be provided from the cmd-line on failure to initialize them.\n\nAugust 15, 2018 - Double sphere camera models have been contributed to the repository via PR #210. If you are interested you can refer to the paper for a nice overview of the models in the repository.\n\nAugust 25, 2016 - Rolling shutter camera calibration support was added as a feature via PR #65. The paper provides details for those interested.\n\nMay 18, 2016 - Support for multiple IMU-to-IMU spacial and IMU intrinsic calibration was released.\n\nJune 18, 2014 - Initial public release of the repository.\n\nPaul Furgale\n\nHannes Sommer\n\nJérôme Maye\n\nJörn Rehder\n\nThomas Schneider (email)\n\nLuc Oth\n\nThe calibration approaches used in Kalibr are based on the following papers.
