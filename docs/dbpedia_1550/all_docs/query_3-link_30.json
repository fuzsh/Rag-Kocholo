        "text": "GMAR member Dues for local, state & national association membership are paid in one lump sum. The initial payment amount is prorated if joining after the payment of the annual dues deadline.\n\nRenewal for this plan is October 1st annually. Payments can be made online by logging into your member account. Premier dues invoices are mailed directly to Agents and are also available in the member portal.\n\nPremier Membership: Renewing members pay only $580/year for GMAR local ($150), MR state ($229), NAR national ($201) dues.\n\nThe Instant Due Diligence App\n\nGain instant knowledge prior to face-to-face engagements to better understand and address risk. Using as little as an incoming phone number, FOREWARN can provide real-time verification of an individual from the palm of your hand, enabling safer engagements and smarter interactions.\n\nFOREWARN solutions enable real estate professionals to verify identity, search for criminal histories, and validate information provided by potential clients - all from just a phone number or a name - and at no cost to GMAR REALTOR® members.\n\nCLAIM YOUR BENEFIT TODAY!\n\nPhone search tip #1: When you are unable find an individual in FOREWARN using a phone number, this does not necessarily mean fraud or criminal intent. FOREWARN users are encouraged to gather further details and use the additional search functionality (the “Search by name” link) within the FOREWARN app to ensure verification of the prospect.\n\nPhone search tip #2: In the search results, FOREWARN displays all the individuals who have ever been associated/linked with the searched phone number. It is normal for multiple people to be linked to a single phone number, either as previous owners of the phone number, or relatives.\n\nName search tip: When searching by name, if there are more than 100 results to your query, FOREWARN will display “Too many records found” and prompt you to re-run your search using additional criteria.\n\nIMPORTANT – COMPLIANCE:\n\nPlease note that you must limit your FOREWARN searches to professional uses only. FOREWARN is only to be for verifying inbound prospects that have initiated the interaction, such as when a buyer, or seller themselves have initiated a request for information or service. FOREWARN cannot be used to verify information for outbound marketing efforts. FOREWARN activity is actively monitored (search terms and volume) to ensure proper use by FOREWARN Subscribers as outlined in the Subscriber Agreement and the FOREWARN Terms and Conditions. FOREWARN is a powerful tool intended only for the increased safety and efficiency of your business.
