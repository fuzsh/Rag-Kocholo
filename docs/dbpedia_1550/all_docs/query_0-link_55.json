This includes payment gateways, payment service providers (PSPs), and independent sales organizations (ISOs). This also includes companies that provide services that control or could impact the security of CHD and/or SAD. Examples include managed service providers that provide managed firewalls, IDS, and other services as well as hosting providers and other entities.\n\nIf an entity provides a service that involves only the provision of public network access—such as a telecommunications company providing just the communication link—the entity would not be considered a service provider for that service (although they may be considered a service provider for other services). See Multi-Tenant Service Provider and Third-Party Service Provider.\n\nSNMP\n\nAcronym for “Simple Network Management Protocol.”.\n\nSplit knowledge\n\nA method by which two or more entities separately have key components or key shares that individually convey no knowledge of the resultant cryptographic key.\n\nSQL\n\nAcronym for “Structured Query Language.”\n\nSSH\n\nAbbreviation for “Secure Shell.”\n\nSSL\n\nAcronym for “Secure Sockets Layer.”\n\nStrong Cryptography\n\nCryptography is a method to protect data through a reversible encryption process, and is a foundational primitive used in many security protocols and services. Strong cryptography is based on industry-tested and accepted algorithms along with key lengths that provide a minimum of 112-bits of effective key strength and proper key-management practices.\n\nEffective key strength can be shorter than the actual ‘bit’ length of the key, which can lead to algorithms with larger keys providing lesser protection than algorithms with smaller actual, but larger effective, key sizes. It is recommended that all new implementations use a minimum of 128-bits of effective key strength.\n\nExamples of industry references on cryptographic algorithms and key lengths include:\n\nNIST Special Publication 800-57 Part 1,\n\nBSI TR-02102-1,\n\nECRYPT-CSA D5.4 Algorithms, Key Size and Protocols Report (2018), and\n\nISO/IEC 18033 Encryption algorithms, and\n\nISO/IEC 14888-3:2-81 IT Security techniques – Digital signatures with appendix – Part 3: Discrete logarithm based mechanisms.\n\nSystem Components\n\nAny network devices, servers, computing devices, virtual components, or software included in or connected to the CDE, or that could impact the security of cardholder data and/or sensitive authentication data.\n\nSystem-level object\n\nAnything on a system component that is required for its operation, including but not limited to application executables and configuration files, system configuration files, static and shared libraries and DLLs, system executables, device drivers and device configuration files, and third-party components.\n\nt\n\nTargeted Risk Analysis\n\nFor PCI DSS purposes, a risk analysis that focuses on a specific PCI DSS requirement(s) of interest, either because the requirement allows flexibility (for example, as to frequency) or, for the Customized Approach, to explain how the entity assessed the risk and determined the customized control meets the objective of a PCI DSS requirement.\n\nTDES\n\nAcronym for “Triple Data Encryption Standard.” Also referred to as “3DES” or “Triple DES.”\n\nTELNET\n\nAbbreviation for “telephone network protocol.”\n\nThird-Party Service Provider (TPSP)\n\nAny third party acting as a service provider on behalf of an entity. See Multi-Tenant Service Provider and Service Provider.\n\nThird-Party Software\n\nSoftware that is acquired by, but not developed expressly for, an entity. It may be open source, freeware, shareware, or purchased.\n\nTLS\n\nAcronym for “Transport Layer Security.”\n\nToken\n\nIn the context of authentication and access control, a token is a value provided by hardware or software that works with an authentication server or VPN to perform dynamic or multi-factor authentication.\n\nTrack Data\n\nAlso referred to as “full track data” or “magnetic-stripe data.” Data encoded in the magnetic stripe or chip used for authentication and/or authorization during payment transactions. Can be the magnetic-stripe image on a chip or the track data on the magnetic stripe.\n\nTruncation\n\nMethod of rendering a full PAN unreadable by removing a segment of PAN data. Truncation relates to protection of PAN when electronically stored, processed, or transmitted.\n\nSee Masking for protection of PAN when displayed on screens, paper receipts, etc.\n\nTrusted Network\n\nNetwork of an entity that is within the entity’s ability to control or manage and that meets applicable PCI DSS requirements.\n\nv\n\nVirtual Payment Terminal\n\nIn the context of Self-Assessment Questionnaire (SAQ) C-VT, a virtual payment terminal is web-browser-based access to an acquirer, processor, or third-party service provider website to authorize payment card transactions, where the merchant manually enters payment card data through a web browser. Unlike physical terminals, virtual payment terminals do not read data directly from a payment card. Because payment card transactions are entered manually, virtual payment terminals are typically used instead of physical terminals in merchant environments with low transaction volumes.\n\nVirtualization\n\nThe logical abstraction of computing resources from physical and/or logical constraints. One common abstraction is referred to as virtual machines or VMs, which takes the content of a physical machine and allows it to operate on different physical hardware and/or along with other virtual machines on the same physical hardware. Other common abstractions include, but are not limited to, containers, serverless computing, or microservices.\n\nVisitor\n\nA vendor, guest of any personnel, service worker, or personnel that normally do not have access to the subject area.\n\nCardholders present in a retail location to purchase goods or services are not considered “visitors.” See Cardholder and Personnel.\n\nVPN\n\nAcronym for “virtual private network.”\n\nVulnerability\n\nFlaw or weakness which, if exploited, may result in an intentional or unintentional compromise of a system."
