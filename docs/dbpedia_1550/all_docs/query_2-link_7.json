        "text": "ROVER®, a laboratory automation platform, uses self-driving \"cars\" to move microplates and other labware from one laboratory instrument to another. The ROVERs use machine vision to navigate virtual maps, providing researchers with a flexible and scalable solution. The platform can scan barcodes, perform plate transfers at designated locations, and move freely in its environment with precise, omnidirectional motion.\n\nThe ROVER system can automate many of the repetitive tasks involved in laboratory work to free up researchers to focus on more important tasks, such as experiment design and analyzing data.\n\nThe ROVER platform is modular by design to allow users to easily and rapidly expand as your lab’s requirements change. The system can be integrated into existing automation setups and easily reconfigured and expanded to meet changing needs.\n\nThe platform consists of three major components:\n\nROVERs (aka “cars”)\n\nFleet Manager Software\n\nInfrastructure (the navigable environment of the ROVERs, including tracks and elevators)\n\nEach of these components can be adjusted to provide more flexibility and through to your automation workflow. The lightweight ROVERs can be easily picked up and added or swapped out in a matter of minutes. The Fleet Manager Software continuously schedules and tracks the status of every ROVER and features an open API to enable easy integration. Adding new ROVERs to the software will give it greater flexibility in scheduling transfer tasks. Finally, the infrastructure is also lightweight and modular, allowing it to be pieced together and rearranged as needed. Installing new track and/or new ROVERs to your system can be done in as little as two days.\n\nThe intention of laboratory automation is to increase efficiency. That cannot be achieved if your system is constantly down for maintenance or recalibration. The ROVER platform was created to allow easy maintenance for increased up-time, while minimizing system downtime.\n\nThe ROVERs self-navigate within a defined laboratory space, utilizing downward-facing cameras and barcode-encoded mats. The need for precise calibration is eliminated by utilizing real-time visual alignment as the ROVERs interface with instruments during plate transfers. The Fleet Management Software monitors the status of each ROVER and notifies the user of any potential issues. At only 2.5 kg (5.3 lbs), the ROVERs are lightweight enough to be picked up and swapped out if needed."
