        "text": "Manfred Zechner: Intelligence means that our systems can independently adapt to situations. Humans, of course, are masters in adaptation. How? By continuously taking in information through our senses, comparing it to patterns we know and deriving the necessary strategies. The same applies to our systems: They receive information through the Host interfaces, sensors or the user, compare it with patterns and draw on a store of strategies that fit the conditions at our customers.\n\nSiegfried Zwing: Our software ensures a smooth interplay of various components in logistics systems. Here, intelligence means to make lasting improvements to operations and at the same time simplifying warehouse management. Examples are the Pick-it-Easy Robots that learn self-sufficiently or, at redPILOT, the software learns how to optimally allocate resources and, having learned, suggests alternative actions to the warehouse manager.\n\nBernd Stöger: We achieve profoundly intelligent systems by increasingly linking production, distribution and point of sale. Another factor is that we have always used intelligent components – for example by installing an additional sensor at the ejector of the central belt autopicker which monitors the channel fill level and therefore ensures a high delivery quality. Vertical and horizontal integration is truly a hot topic which we can use to position ourselves as a value chain provider along the entire supply chain.\n\nSiegfried Zwing:Comprehensive systems and interconnectedness are a clear advantage. That’s our focus and is why we stand out from our competitors…\n\nBernd Stöger: …We create actual customer benefits: Using fewer resources to achieve higher performance and quality. What does this mean? In logistics, this results, for example, in a reduced number of empty transports or in storing and processing more articles in less space within a warehouse using intelligent storage strategies.\n\nManfred Zechner: Intelligent software is the enabler of new services and offers new opportunities. The customer can install new service functions and integrate several processes in their warehouse to fulfil very specific requirements, especially in terms of customization.\n\nSiegfried Zwing: In the view of redPILOT’s operations management, it is important to know which processes are used at what time and to what extent. In doing so, we can achieve higher performance because resources are used optimally and we also think beyond the boundaries of our company. The same applies for logistics employees: Away with rigid shift systems, bring on higher flexibility, more freedom and greater involvement in operations scheduling.\n\nAlessandro Freidl: We’re moving more and more from reactive and preventive towards predictive. In other words, we already know today what to expect tomorrow or what has to be done the day after tomorrow. This enhances flexibility, plannability and cost-efficiency for our customers. By analyzing the processes, we can, for example, carry out planned maintenance in off-peak periods to keep the costs to a minimum.\n\nBernd Stöger: A clear trend in software and logistics is that everything is becoming increasingly smarter. This includes our software and our machines as well. The most important form of intelligence by far is in our employees. Their knowledge and their expertise make our solutions what they are. As in the example of the little sensor at the ejector that makes the entire value chain more intelligent, every employee makes a difference and people are at the heart of our solutions. We incorporate all of our networked expertise in the further development of our system’s technologies and software. In doing so, we succeed in increasing the customer benefit and, ultimately, in improving the life both of consumers and of ourselves."
