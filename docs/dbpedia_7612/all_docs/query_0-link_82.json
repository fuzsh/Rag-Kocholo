        "text": "Learning by doing has proven value, but Video and Film Production takes the concept to an extreme level, thanks to VER, the world's largest provider of video equipment for live events. \"We started that partnership in 2014,\" says Mike Forbes, assistant director for technical systems for Media Arts. \"Some of our students went there to work, and, while VER was certainly willing to train them, I heard from some friends there that they prefer more experience. When I explained that equipment limited training, the response was We can take care of that.' And they sent a huge box truck of LED equipment for us to use!\" Thus MTSU students train on state-of-the-art equipment that is inventoried and updated each summer. \"It's a win-win! Our students learn the equipment and technology; consequently, various companies hire our students — not just VER [although more than 16 MTSU students have joined the prestigious company]. No other university that I'm aware of has such a partnership,\" says Forbes. The first year's equipment was valued at about half a million dollars; currently students are working with equipment worth about $2.5 million. Students use the equipment to create video walls and special effects for three to four large events each semester — some on campus in Tucker Theatre or Murphy Center — such as awards shows, dance programs, and concerts — Ludacris in 2017. \"I'm most excited about the collaboration among different departments,\" says Forbes, citing an end-of-the-semester show featuring bands brought in by Recording Industry, who does the audio; Theatre and Dance, lighting; and Media Arts, video. He's proud too of the successes students achieve, sharing a story of FaceTiming during his Monday morning class with a grad wrapping up from a Super Bowl half-time show the night before."
