        "text": "Director Yorgos Lanthimos trips over himself reconnecting with his inner freak in \"Kinds of Kindness,\" a frustrating triptych that works hard to reconfirm his weirdo cred after he experienced a pair of mainstream successes.\n\nOnly in Lanthimos' twisted world could the oddball bonanzas \"Poor Things\" and \"The Favourite\" be considered mainstream movies. But the two films came with a certain amount of prestige attached to them and were presented as big awards season propositions, and they each won Oscars for their lead actresses (Emma Stone for \"Poor Things,\" Olivia Colman for \"The Favourite\").\n\n\"Kinds of Kindness\" abruptly changes lanes and shifts Lanthimos back to his home turf, where he's the guy in the back of the classroom peeling back his own fingernails just to try and get a reaction out of you. This is the awkward, stilted, disturbing Lanthimos of \"The Killing of a Sacred Deer,\" \"The Lobster\" and his 2009 breakthrough, \"Dogtooth,\" which established him as a filmmaker who took great pleasure in making your skin crawl.\n\n\"Kinds of Kindness\" — which was also written by Lanthimos, unlike \"Poor Things\" and \"The Favourite\" — wants to make your skin crawl, too, but it feels like a regression after the boundary-pushing achievements of his last two films, which made no concession to strangeness but managed to expand his reach and grasp of the world around him.\n\nThis series of stories stars a troupe of actors — Emma Stone, Jesse Plemons, Willem Dafoe, Margaret Qualley and Hong Chau among them — who are placed in different spots on Lanthimos' chess board in each of the three tales. The individual stories aren't connected, but they share themes of power and control, and the lengths people will go to to attain and hold onto those things. They also share a deep oddness and sicko sense of humor, Lanthimos' stock in trade.\n\nThe three tales are each named after a bit character named R.M.F., which seems like an inside joke locked in Lanthimos' head. In the first, which is the most effective of the three, Plemons plays Robert, a man whose every move is controlled by his boss, Raymond (Dafoe), right down to his scheduled intimacy with his wife, Sarah (Chau). Things get weird — and it's only a matter of time before they do in all three stories — when Robert is asked, nay, ordered by Raymond to kill a man in a car accident. When he refuses, his life falls apart, and he is sent scrambling trying to make things right.\n\nThe second tale involves Daniel (Plemons), who begins to suspect his long-missing wife, Liz (Stone) might be an imposter after she returns home following a stint where she had been missing at sea. In the third tale — and due to the rhythms of the storytelling and the film's 165-minute running time, they tend to follow the law of diminishing returns — Plemons and Stone play cult members attempting to resurrect the dead at the behest of their leader, played by Dafoe. Again, weirdness ensues.\n\nThe respective successes of \"Poor Things\" and \"The Favourite\" gave Lanthimos carte blanche to do what he wants, and kudos to him for following his muse and not cashing in his chips and selling out. (Although the prospect of Lanthimos directing a Marvel film, for example, is quite enticing.) Making \"Kinds of Kindness\" is sticking to your guns and doubling down on yourself, this is following up \"Born in the USA\" with \"Tunnel of Love.\" (The analogy is far from perfect, but you understand.)\n\nBut Lanthimos never sold out in the first place, and \"Kindness\" feels a bit petulant in its conception and execution. The effect of one of these stories, thought through and fully formed into one standalone film, would have been greater than the sum of the three, which feel varying degrees of incomplete.\n\nDafoe and Plemons are especially at home with the material; there's no level of freak these two can't match. (Stone, for her part, does her best work in the third story, where she gets to drive like a maniac and dance to Cobrah.) Hopefully Lanthimos feels reconnected to what he felt he lost and takes it with him going forward, but \"Kinds of Kindness\" adds up to less than the sum of its parts, and leaves you feeling a bit empty.\n\nagraham@detroitnews.com\n\n'Kinds of Kindness'\n\nGRADE: C\n\nRated R: for strong/disturbing violent content, strong sexual content, full nudity and language\n\nRunning time: 165 minutes\n\nIn theaters"
