        "text": "Like many crimes in South Carolina, crimes involving child pornography are broken up into various degrees. The degrees can be described in three categories: production, dissemination and possession of child pornography. All degrees are felony offenses.\n\nThe most serious is First Degree Sexual Exploitation of a Minor, which prohibits the production of child pornography. This charge carries a mandatory minimum penalty of three years to twenty years in jail.\n\nSecond Degree Exploitation of a Minor is a felony which prohibits the dissemination or reproduction of child pornography. This charge carries a mandatory minimum sentence of two years to ten years jail time.\n\nThird Degree Sexual Exploitation of a Minor is a felony which prohibits the possession of child pornography.
