        "text": "Our laws contain notable gaps that allow individuals who have demonstrated a significant risk of violence to possess firearms.\n\nBackground check laws are crucial to protecting public health and safety by preventing people from acquiring firearms when they have a significant history of harming themselves or others or are otherwise at elevated risk of violence. Under federal law, meeting certain criteria, such as criminal convictions and court orders, can prohibit individuals from passing a background check. State laws may also establish additional, stronger eligibility standards.\n\nBackground\n\nFederal law establishes a baseline national standard regarding individuals’ eligibility to acquire and possess firearms. Under federal law, a person is generally prohibited from acquiring or possessing firearms if, among other things, they have been convicted of certain crimes or become subject to certain court orders related to domestic violence or a serious mental condition. The FBI’s NICS background check system helps to ensure that people subject to these restrictions cannot pass a background check to obtain a firearm—at least in circumstances when a background check is legally required and relevant records have been properly submitted to the background check system. For more information on the NICS and how the background check system is implemented in the states, go to NICS & Reporting Procedures and Background Check Procedures.\n\nIt is also important for states to prohibit the same categories of people prohibited by federal laws to allow local prosecutors and courts to enforce those laws instead of relying on more limited federal enforcement capacity alone. Many states have enacted prohibitions that mirror federal law in the areas of felony convictions, domestic violence, mental health, and drug addiction prohibitions.\n\nFederal law does not go far enough, however, to prohibit people who have demonstrated significant risk factors for future violence or self-harm from legally acquiring and possessing guns.\n\nStates can play an important role in enacting laws that go above and beyond federal law to prohibit firearm possession by broader categories of people who are at higher risk of committing violence with firearms, such as people who commit violence misdemeanors and hate crimes, misuse alcohol, and commit serious crimes as juveniles. As discussed in more detail below, many states have expanded categories of prohibited people in key areas.\n\nThese expanded categories of firearm prohibitions are based on decades of research showing that certain behaviors are associated with increased risk of firearm violence and that such policies can help prevent gun violence and promote public safety:\n\nMisdemeanor Convictions: People who have previously been convicted of a violent misdemeanor are nine times more likely to be charged with another violent offense after purchasing a handgun, compared to people with no criminal history. State laws which prohibit firearm purchase for individuals with a history of violent misdemeanor convictions are associated with an 18% reduction in firearm homicides overall and a 23% reduction in firearm intimate partner homicides.\n\nHate Crimes: Hate crime incidents in the US rose 48% between 2014 and 2020, and each year, there are more than 10,300 hate crime incidents involving firearms. Studies show that people with a history of hate crime convictions are at significantly higher risk of committing further violence.\n\nAlcohol and Substance Misuse: Heavy alcohol use and misuse can increase the risk of dangerous and risky behavior with firearms. In fact, studies show that approximately a quarter of firearm suicide victims and roughly a third of firearm homicide victims and offenders heavily consumed alcohol prior to their death. People with a history of alcohol related offenses, such as DUIs, are five times more likely to be arrested for firearm related crimes compared to individuals without such convictions.\n\nJuvenile Offenses: Juvenile justice involvement more than triples the likelihood of adult violent felony arrest, and people with a felony-equivalent juvenile conviction are nine times more likely to be arrested for a firearm-involved crime compared to the general population.\n\nSummary of Federal Law\n\nFederal law establishes a baseline national standard regarding the criteria that make people ineligible to acquire and possess firearms. The federal Gun Control Act of 1968, codified at 18 U.S.C. § 922, generally prohibits the sale to, and possession of firearms by, a person who:\n\nHas been convicted of, or is under indictment for:\n\nA federal crime punishable by imprisonment for more than one year (typically a felony, however, federal or state offenses pertaining to antitrust violations, unfair trade practices, restraints of trade, or other similar offenses relating to the regulation of business practices are exempt. )\n\nA state crime that is not classified as a misdemeanor and is punishable by imprisonment for more than one year\n\nA state crime that is classified as a misdemeanor under state law and is punishable by more than two years imprisonment\n\nIs a fugitive from justice\n\nIs “an unlawful user of or addicted to any controlled substance”\n\nThough certain states have legalized the use of medical and recreational marijuana, it remains illegal under federal law. Therefore, ATF considers people who use marijuana legally under state law unlawful users of a controlled substance.\n\nIs underage (For additional information about federal age restrictions for the purchase and possession of firearms, see our page on the Minimum Age to Purchase and Possess Firearms.)\n\nHas been found by a court, board, commission, or other lawful authority to be a danger to self or others, or to “lack[] the mental capacity to contract or manage [their] own affairs,” as a result of their mental condition or illness (This prohibition also expressly applies when a person has been found incompetent to stand trial or not guilty of a crime due to mental incapacity)\n\nHas been involuntarily committed to a mental health or substance abuse treatment facility by a court, board, commission, or other lawful authority. (This prohibition does not apply when a person is admitted for treatment voluntarily or when a person is only hospitalized for short-term observation without longer-term commitment or court-ordered treatment.)\n\nIs unlawfully in the United States or has been admitted to the US under a nonimmigrant visa\n\nHas been dishonorably discharged from the US Armed Forces\n\nHas renounced their US citizenship\n\nIs subject to an active court order restraining them from harassing, stalking or threatening an intimate partner, their child, or a child of a partner, or from engaging in other conduct that would place an intimate partner in reasonable fear of bodily injury to the partner or child\n\nHas been convicted of a misdemeanor offense of domestic violence (For more detailed information on firearm restrictions—and gaps—related to domestic violence, see our summary on Domestic Violence and Firearms).\n\nAlthough federal law does not prohibit gun access by people who were adjudicated as juveniles for crimes that would have been felonies if the juvenile were an adult when they committed the crime, in 2022, President Biden signed the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act, which amends the Gun Control Act of 1968 taking into account juvenile records in the prohibition of sales of firearms to persons pursuant to 18 U.S.C. § 922(d). The law also clarifies that the prohibition on the sale of a firearm to a person who has been adjudicated as a “mental defective” or committed to a mental institution applies to an adjudication or commitment at age 16 or older.\n\nSUPPORT GUN SAFETY\n\nWe’re in this together. To build a safer America—one where children and parents in every neighborhood can learn, play, work, and worship without fear of gun violence—we need you standing beside us in this fight.\n\nSummary of State Law\n\nSome states have enacted stronger eligibility standards than federal law by placing additional limitations on firearm access based on criteria that have been associated with elevated risk of violence or self-harm.\n\nMisdemeanor Convictions\n\nAll states except Vermont generally restrict firearm access after a person has been convicted of a felony, mirroring federal law in this area, which generally prohibits firearm access after an individual has been convicted of a crime punishable by more than one year in prison. (Vermont prohibits firearm possession after a person has been convicted of “a violent crime,” which includes crimes like murder, stalking, and domestic assault, but not other felonies). Most state laws mirror federal law in this area by generally prohibiting firearm access after a person has been convicted of a crime punishable by more than one year in prison.\n\nSeveral states also prohibit firearm access after a person has been convicted of certain misdemeanor offenses, often including broader categories of violent or firearm-related crimes. For example, New York prohibits firearm access after a person has been convicted of misdemeanor crimes defined as “serious offenses” under state law, including child endangerment, certain disorderly conduct crimes, and certain stalking offenses. California, Colorado, and Connecticut prohibit firearm access for a minimum period after a person has been convicted of specified misdemeanors involving violence or misuse of firearms.\n\nHate Crimes\n\nHate crime laws were designed to protect groups most likely to be targeted in bias attacks, but they generally apply after the fact, increasing penalties when a serious violent crime is carried out with hateful intent. However, in practice guns are often used only to intimidate victims but are not always fired, resulting in shorter sentences that do not trigger federal firearm prohibitions. Research shows that hate crime convictions are excellent predictors for future violence and that those convicted of violent hate crimes tend to continue or escalate their behavior.\n\nDespite this evidence, only a handful of states expressly prohibit people from accessing firearms based on a misdemeanor hate crime conviction. For more information about this topic, see our page on Hate Crime Gun Laws.\n\nAlcohol Addiction and Offenses\n\nFederal law prohibits firearm access by individuals who are “unlawful users of or addicted to a controlled substance” but does not prohibit people who misuse alcohol from accessing firearms. However, people who misuse alcohol are at greater risk of committing violence with firearms.\n\nA number of states and the District of Columbia restrict firearm access by individuals grappling with alcohol addiction and misuse disorders.\n\nJuvenile Offenses\n\nIn all states, when juveniles commit crimes, they are brought to justice in a tribunal granted special authority to impose punishments and rehabilitative services. Juveniles who have passed through this system are often referred to in the law as “adjudicated delinquent.”\n\nBecause the juvenile justice system does not issue convictions, an adjudicated delinquent juvenile who commits a serious crime that would be considered a felony if the juvenile had been an adult when the crime was committed will not have a felony conviction. When the juvenile becomes an adult and otherwise legally able to purchase firearms, their adjudication will not prohibit them from purchasing or possessing a firearm. Nevertheless, juveniles who have committed such serious crimes pose a higher risk of committing violence in the future, at least for a period of time.\n\nAccordingly, a number of states have passed laws prohibiting firearm access for individuals who were adjudicated delinquent for a crime that would have been a felony had they been an adult for at least some period of time once they reach adulthood.\n\nState Laws Restricting Access to Firearms\n\nState Violent or Gun-Related Misdemeanors Alcohol Misuse\n\nJuvenile Offenses\n\nAlabama Yes Yes .

Our reports bring you the latest cutting-edge research and analysis about strategies to end our country’s gun violence crisis at every level.\n\nLearn More\n\nDisarming People who Become Prohibited from Accessing Firearms\n\nFederal law does not provide a standard process to ensure that individuals who have become prohibited from possessing firearms actually relinquish them. Most states expressly authorize law enforcement to remove firearms when they are discovered in the possession of a person who is prohibited from possessing them. However, only a few states have a more proactive process in place to ensure that individuals lawfully relinquish their firearms after becoming prohibited from possessing them. For more information about this topic, see our page on Firearm Relinquishment.\n\nRisk-Based Removal Laws\n\nIn addition, several states have enacted laws, generally referred to as extreme risk protection orders, which allow law enforcement officers or family or household members to petition a court for an order to have firearms temporarily removed from an individual who poses a significant risk of harm to self or others. For more information on this type of law, see our summary on Extreme Risk Protection Orders.\n\nKey Legislative Elements\n\nThe features listed below are intended to provide a framework from which policy options may be considered. A jurisdiction considering new legislation should consult with counsel.\n\nAt a minimum, firearm eligibility standards are at least as extensive as federal law, to allow state and local resources to assist in implementation and enforcement.\n\nAccess to firearms is restricted for at least a temporary period after a person has been convicted of violent, firearm-related, and other serious felonies and misdemeanors, including domestic violence offenses and hate crimes.\n\nStates should prohibit gun access for people convicted of misdemeanor hate crimes and also expand hate crime definitions to include all protected groups on the basis of race, ethnicity, religion, nationality, disability, gender identity, and sexual orientation.\n\nAccess to firearms is restricted after a person has been found to pose a significant risk of harm to themselves or others, including when individuals have been found to be severely cognitively impaired as a result of their mental condition or ordered to receive mental health treatment.\n\nA procedure exists to allow law enforcement officials and a person’s family or household members to petition courts for an extreme risk protection order, which temporarily suspends a person’s access to firearms if a court has determined they pose a significant risk of harming themselves or others.\n\nAccess to firearms is restricted for people subject to domestic violence restraining orders and other civil and criminal court orders issued for the protection of named parties or the public from acts of violence, including orders protecting witnesses against threats and intimidation.\n\nAccess to at least some firearms is restricted for people under the age of 21.\n\nSelling or transferring a firearm to a person who is ineligible to possess firearms is unlawful.\n\nA state agency identifies individuals who have become ineligible to possess firearms and state law provides standard procedures to verify that such individuals have relinquished any firearms in their possession."
