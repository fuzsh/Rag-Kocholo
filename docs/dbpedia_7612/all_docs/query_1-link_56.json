Most producers and directors work full time, and some work more than 40 hours per week. Their schedules may vary.\n\nHow to Become a Producer or Director\n\nProducers and directors typically need a bachelor’s degree. They also typically need several years of experience working on set in film, TV, stage, or other productions in positions such as actors, film and video editors, or cinematographers or in related occupations, such as theater managers.\n\nPay\n\nThe median annual wage for producers and directors was $82,510 in May 2023.\n\nJob Outlook\n\nEmployment of producers and directors is projected to grow 7 percent from 2022 to 2032, faster than the average for all occupations.\n\nAbout 16,000 openings for producers and directors are projected each year, on average, over the decade. Many of those openings are expected to result from the need to replace workers who transfer to different occupations or exit the labor force, such as to retire.\n\nState & Area Data\n\nExplore resources for employment and wages by state and area for producers and directors.\n\nSimilar Occupations\n\nCompare the job duties, education, job growth, and pay of producers and directors with similar occupations.\n\nMore Information, Including Links to O*NET\n\nLearn more about producers and directors by visiting additional resources, including O*NET, a source on key characteristics of workers and occupations.\n\nWhat Producers and Directors Do About this section\n\nProducers and directors make business and creative decisions about, film, television, stage, and other productions. They interpret a writer’s script to entertain, inform, or instruct an audience.\n\nDuties\n\nProducers and directors typically do the following:\n\nSelect scripts or topics for a film, television, video, stage, or radio production\n\nAudition and select cast members and the film or stage crew\n\nApprove the design and financial aspects of a production\n\nOversee the production process, including sound, lighting, and performances\n\nOversee the postproduction process, including editing, music selection, special effects, and a performance’s overall tone\n\nEnsure that a project stays on schedule and within budget\n\nPromote finished productions or works through advertisements, film festivals, and interviews\n\nAlthough producers and directors have distinct roles in a production, their work may overlap. For example, directors ultimately answer to producers, but some directors share producing duties for their own films.\n\nProducers make the business and financial decisions for a film, stage production, or TV show. They raise money for the project and hire the director and crew, which may include designers, editors, and other workers. Some producers also assist in the selection of cast members. Producers set the budget and approve any major changes to the project. They make sure that the production is completed on time, and they are ultimately responsible for the final product.\n\nVarious producers often share responsibilities on large productions. For example, on a large movie set, an executive producer is in charge of the entire production and a line producer runs the day-to-day operations. A TV show may employ several assistant producers to whom the head or executive producer gives certain duties, such as supervising the costume and makeup teams.\n\nDirectors are responsible for the creative decisions of a production. They select cast members, conduct rehearsals, and direct the work of the cast and crew. During rehearsals, they work with the actors to help them portray their characters accurately. For nonfiction video, such as documentaries or live broadcasts, directors choose topics or subjects to film. They research the topic and may interview experts or relevant participants on camera. Directors also work with cinematographers and other crew members to ensure that the final product matches the overall vision.\n\nDirectors work with set designers, location scouts, and art directors to build a project’s set. They also work with costume designers to ensure that clothing suits the overall look of the production. During a film’s postproduction phase, they work closely with film editors and music supervisors to make sure that the final product meets the producer’s and director’s vision. Stage directors, unlike television or film directors, who document their product with cameras, make sure that the cast and crew give consistently strong live performances.\n\nAs with assistant producers, several assistant directors may work on large productions. Assistant directors help the director with small production tasks, such as making set changes or notifying the performers when it is their time to go onstage. Their specific responsibilities vary with the size and type of production they work on.\n\nFor more information about occupations related to producers and directors, see the profiles on actors, writers and authors, film and video editors and camera operators, dancers and choreographers, and multimedia artists and animators.\n\nWork Environment About this section\n\nProducers and directors held about 175,300 jobs in 2022. The largest employers of producers and directors were as follows:\n\nMotion picture and video industries 35% Media streaming distribution services, social networks, and other media networks and content providers 13 Performing arts, spectator sports, and related industries 9 Self-employed workers 8 Television broadcasting stations 7\n\nProducers and directors are often under pressure to finish their work on time. Work assignments may be short, ranging from 1 day to a few months. They sometimes must work in unpleasant conditions, such as bad weather.\n\nTheater directors and producers may travel with a touring show across the country, while those in film and television may work on location (a site away from the studio and where all or part of the filming occurs).\n\nWork Schedules\n\nWorkdays for producers and directors may be long and irregular. Many do not have a standard workweek, because their schedules may change with each assignment or project. Evening, weekend, and holiday work is common. Most producers and directors work full time, and some work more than 40 hours per week.\n\nHow to Become a Producer or Director About this section\n\nProducers and directors typically have a bachelor’s degree. They also typically need several years of experience working on set in film, TV, stage, or other productions in positions such as actors, cinematographers, or film and video editors or in related occupations, such as theater managers.\n\nEducation\n\nProducers and directors typically need a bachelor's degree in film or cinema studies or a related field, such as arts management, business, communications technology, or theater. In film or cinema studies programs, students learn about film history, editing, screenwriting, cinematography, and the filmmaking process.\n\nStage directors may complete a degree in theater, and some go on to earn a Master of Fine Arts (MFA) degree. Courses may include directing, playwriting, set design, and acting.\n\nWork Experience in a Related Occupation\n\nProducers and directors might start out working in theatrical management offices as business or company managers. In television or film, they may begin as assistants or in other low-profile studio jobs. They may also participate in internships that provide opportunities to work alongside producers and directors. For more information, see the profile on film and video editors and camera operators.\n\nAdvancement\n\nAs a producer’s or director’s reputation grows, he or she may work on increasingly large, challenging, and expensive projects that attract publicity.\n\nImportant Qualities\n\nCommunication skills. Producers and directors must convey information and ideas clearly in order to coordinate many people to finish a production on time and within budget.\n\nCreativity. Because a script may be interpreted in different ways, directors must decide on their approach and on how to represent the script’s ideas for the production.\n\nDecision-making skills. Producers must find and hire, within budget, the best director and crew for the production. Directors must make choices that affect the look and feel of the production.\n\nLeadership skills. Directors instruct actors and help them portray their characters in a believable manner. They also supervise the crew, which is responsible for behind-the-scenes work.\n\nPay About this section\n\nProducers and Directors\n\nMedian annual wages, May 2023\n\nProducers and directors\n\n$82,510\n\nEntertainers and performers, sports and related workers\n\n$53,360\n\nTotal, all occupations\n\n$48,060\n\nThe median annual wage for producers and directors was $82,510 in May 2023.
