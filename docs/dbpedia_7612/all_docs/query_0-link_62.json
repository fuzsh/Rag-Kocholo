        "text": "Jonathan + Marie are the kind of people who can make any stranger feel like family. They’re full of joy, kindness, and a whole lot of fun! This was reiterated time ad time again during each of the speeches given at their reception. It’s such a testament to who they are and the life they’re building together! We love couples that love to laugh and don’t take themselves too seriously. We love couples who surround themselves with humans who are just as wonderful as they are. We love couples who know this whole wedding thing is really about a beautiful marriage, not just a beautiful day. And all of these things are reasons we love Jonathan + Marie and had the best of days celebrating with them!\n\nTheir wedding at Third Degree Glass Factory, a quirky little glassblowing studio and gallery in St. Louis, was filled with color, whimsy, and a few sweet personal touches (like jars of honey harvested from their own bees in their backyard!) that made the day even more special! During their first look, Jonathan gave Marie a sweet book about their love story. But this wasn’t just an ordinary book…y’all, he commissioned an author to write an entire novel based on their characters! He’s leveling up that groom gift game! We took bridal party photos at the Grand Basin in Forest Park, where they had their first kiss, got engaged, and did their engagement photos! I love when we get to return to special spots like that on their wedding day. Some other highlights from the day include their gorgeous color-filled blooms from Sisters Flowers, Marie’s killer dance moves, and the Clementine’s Creamery truck that rolled in during the reception!\n\nJonathan + Marie, we adore you both and are so glad we got to be a part of your day! Cannot wait to show you the rest of your images!\n\nVendor Love:"
