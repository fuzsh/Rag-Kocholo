        "text": "Hi, i'm very new to keeping tarantulas as pets, i recently bought a G. pulchripes about and its about 2\" very little thing, However when i first got hr she was fine and moving around and exploring. Climbing stuff, moving stuff etc etc. However on the 30th of June its behavior changed. She is staying under her hide , not moving, refusing food, just not moving and being a pet rock. I understand the process of the molt and she could well be in pre-molt. Just wondering f anyone could help or should i be concerned in anyway. Thank you.\n\nCould be premoult. But pics of the enclosure are always helpful to rule everything else out.\n\nHi yes thanks I'll send pictures of the enclosure now.\n\nHi yes thanks I'll send pictures of the enclosure now.\n\nOkay, as you can see the substrate is dry as a bone, the bark i gave her , as you can see it just hides under it and has been doing since Saturday, its strange because it was all out in the open eating fine, then it's behavior just changed to her not moving and staying under the hide not even coming out at all and refusing pinhead crickets. She does not web at all either. I'm assuming pre-molt tbh. However if there is anything wrong with the enclosure or anything please let me know. Thank you\n\nAttachments\n\n575.3 KB Views: 8\n\n580.1 KB Views: 8\n\nThe enclosure looks perfect. Don’t be concerned at all. Tarantulas behavior can change from day to day occasionally. Post a pic of the tarantula when you get a chance so we can assure you that the enclosure isn’t too large. It’s important to give them space, however not too much space when they are small to limit them having to hunt and possibly go hungry. You want to make a sling’s life as easy as possible. But yeah, the enclosure looks great.\n\nIn regards to the crickets. If you’re feeding live ones, try to crush their heads and place one or two near the burrow. It’s possible the T is intimidated by the cricket. I’ve encountered that behavior countless times with slings. But it’s nothing that can’t be fixed by prekilling the food.\n\nThe enclosure looks perfect. Don’t be concerned at all. Tarantulas behavior can change from day to day occasionally.

I’m really worried , I had to move her hide to take that photo and she didn’t even move, only moved one leg. Also is the enclosure still fine or to big if so I have a small deli cup to place her in. Like I say I assume premolt but anyway thank you.\n\nView attachment 313508 View attachment 313507\n\nHi thank you for your help, there is the golden knee as you can see quite small and tiny , I noticed the thing on her back , WHAT THE HELL IS THAT !!

That golden patch on the top of the abdomen is nothing to be concerned about. That’s just one of the more attractive features of the species. As stated earlier, your enclosure is great and your T looks healthy. Just replace that cork bark and let your tarantula be a tarantula.\n\nThat enclosure doesn’t really look to large at all.

That’s a beautiful species that is quite docile. That’s why you didn’t get any running/ threat postures when you removed the bark. Just let her/ him chill out and do as they will. The only maintenance you need to keep up on is removing food waste from time to time, keep her fed and a clean water supply. Hopefully you have a female! I used to have one of the same species that got quite large. Good luck!\n\nHappy to help! That’s a beautiful species that is quite docile.

If you’re looking for a second T, I recommend you pick up a Brachypelma Hamorii (Mexican Red Knee). It’s another absolutely beautiful species with bright orange/ red knees. They’re growth rate is very similar to the Chaco you already have and they have an extremely docile temperament which makes them an excellent beginner species. The B. Hamorii is also a terrestrial (ground dwelling) species so a set up similar to your Chaco would suit one well. They tend to be a bit on the pricey side if you shop for a juvenile so maybe try your hand at a younger sling and watch it blossom."
