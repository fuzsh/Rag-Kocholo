        "text": "In one of the issues of EL DORADO (the journal of THE SOUTH AND CENTRAL AMERICAN MILITARY HISTORIANS SOCIETY) that Terry Hooker recently sent me in PDF format, there was a review of Adrian J. English’s THE GREEN HELL – A CONCISE HISTORY OF THE CHACO WAR BETWEEN BOLIVIA AND PARAGUAY 1932-35.\n\nAlthough the book was published in 2007 by Spellmount Ltd., (ISBN 978 1 86227 445 7) this was the first I knew about it, and so I ordered one immediately. It arrived in the post today, and a quick glance through it indicates that it is even better than I had hoped.\n\nThis is hardly surprising as Adrian English is probably the doyen of English-speaking historians who specialise in the study of South American military history.\n\nThe book has chapters and sections entitled:\n\nChronology of Events\n\n1. The Actors and the Stage\n\n2. The Roots of Discord\n\n3. Preparations for Conflict\n\n4. The Dispute Escalates\n\n5. The Road to War\n\n6. The Opposing Forces\n\n7. The First Paraguayan Offensive\n\n8. The First Bolivian Counter-Offensive\n\n9. The Second Paraguayan Offensive\n\n10. The Third Paraguayan Offensive\n\n11. The Second Bolivian Counter-Offensive\n\n12. The Paraguayan Counter-Offensive\n\n13. The War in The Air\n\n14. The Fourth Paraguayan Offensive\n\n15. The Closing Phase\n\n16. Armistice and Peace Treaty\n\n17. Summary\n\n18. Epilogue\n\nAppendix I: Bolivian Army Units\n\nAppendix II: Major Equipment of the Bolivian Army\n\nAppendix III: Material Captured by Bolivia During the War\n\nAppendix IV: Aircraft of the Bolivian Air Force\n\nAppendix V: Paraguayan Army Units\n\nAppendix VI: Major Equipment of the Paraguayan Army\n\nAppendix VII: Material Captured from the Bolivians by Paraguay During the War\n\nAppendix VIII: Ships of the Paraguayan Navy\n\nAppendix IX: Vessels of the Paraguayan Merchant Marine Mobilised and Incorporated into the Navy During the War\n\nAppendix X: Aircraft of the Paraguayan Air Force and Naval Air Arm\n\nThe book seems to have just about every piece of information a wargamer would need to have to refight this war. All I have to do now is to resist the temptation to do so!"
