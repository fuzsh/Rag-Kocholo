        "text": "Argentine heavy metal band\n\nTren Loco is an Argentine heavy metal band formed in the suburban town of Grand Bourg, in Buenos Aires Province. Their lyrics relate social issues, like \"Clase trabajadora\" (Working class), \"Fuera de la Ley\" (Outlaw) and \"Lucila\"; others are about political issues, such as \"Pampa del Infierno\" (Hell's Land) and \"Nos vemos en Cutral-Co\" (See you at Cutral-Co). They also write about personal matters: \"Endemoniado\" (Possessed), \"No me importa\" (I do not care) and \"A ultranza\" (To the end). The group's name is inspired by the classic Ozzy Osbourne song: Crazy Train.[2]\n\nThe bass player Gustavo Zavala created a new band in 1990, after the breakup of his previous band, Apocalipsis. He called the guitarist Rubén El Turco Atala, the drummer El Pollo Fuentes and the singer Gabriel Marian. The songs composed by this line-up were published in the album Apocalipsis in 1985.[3] A month later, the singer Carlos Cabral leaves the band Dhak and joins Tren Loco, at the same time Mauricio Pregler joins as the second guitarist and Sergio Rojas as keyboardist.\n\nIn early 1991, they recorded their first demo at Sonovision studios, in Buenos Aires, with Álvaro Villagra as the producer. That same year, on June 23, they performed a show at Halley Discothèque and started the competition for the Yamaha Band Explosion.\n\nThey finally reached to the finals in Tokyo, Japan, where they played at the Budokan Stadium, competing with bands from Germany, Spain, United States, France and England. Tren Loco received the Special Jury Prize and signed a contract with the multinational label record company PolyGram, in 1992. Their first album Tempestades (Storm) was recorded in CD, cassette and vinyl. That same year, the band acts as support of Saxon in Buenos Aires.\n\nIn 1994, the Polygram contact finished and El Turco Atala and Rojas left the band. As a quartet again their sound changed being more raw and direct. Tren Loco recorded an EP with new songs: \"Patrulla bonaerense\" (Buenos Aires Patrol), \"Al Acecho\" (Spying), \"Paz de Mentira\" (False peace), \"Luca no murió\" (Luca is not dead), \"Vengan Juntos\" (Come together) and \"O Sole Mio\".\n\nAs an independent band they recorded their second album: No me importa! at Del Abasto al Pasto Studios, with Álvaro Villagra as the recording engineer again. This album was edited under their own record label: Yugular Records in 1997, after opening the show of Skid Row at Obras Sanitarias Stadium in Buenos Aires. That year, they performed more than 50 shows, published the CD and released a video home Biografía (Biography) with songs from both albums and EP. The following year, they released the videos along with photos from the Japan tour.\n\nIn 2000 Tren Loco released a new record: Carne Viva (Live Flesh) with arrangements on violin, accordion, and an interactive track. They presented this album for the first time at Cemento, as the main group. At this time, Mauricio Pregler decided to leave the band, and after the tryouts of several guitarists, Cristian Zombie Gauna joined Tren Loco as the leader guitar. They participated in Raza Metálica and La Cumbre del Metal festivals, and opened the Paul Di'Anno and Judas Priest's first show (with singer Tim \"Ripper\" Owens) in Argentina at Obras Sanitarias Stadium.\n\nIn 2001, they performed in the First National Metal Meeting of Argentina, in La Falda, Córdoba. The next year, they released a new album Ruta 197 (Route 197), which it was recorded once again at Del Abasto al Pasto studios with Álvaro Villagra.\n\nIn 2002, Tren Loco performed for the first time in Ecuador: in the cities Quito and Cuenca.\n\nIn 2003 they performed in Venezuela, at Teresa Carreño Theatre in Caracas.

On March, they announced the publishing of their biographical book as part of the celebration; that it was released on September 18.
