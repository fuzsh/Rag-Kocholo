It takes place a while before the original Cave Story. It explains where all of the strange, dangerous creatures on the island came from.\n\nStory I'll show:\n\nYou wake up one day and realize that you might be late for the lunch you'd planned with Santa. You go there, and he reveals that someone has taken the bread. You search for it, and fall into a tunnel you can't get up from, and venture on from there. You find a crowbar and an H.E.V. suit at a mysterious underground house.\n\nWork I have to show so far:\n\nDec 18, 2010 at 4:26 AM\n\nIn my body, in my head\n\nForum Moderator\n\n\"Life begins and ends with Nu.\"\n\nJoin Date: Aug 28, 2009\n\nLocation: The Purple Zone\n\nPosts: 5998\n\nPronouns: he/him\n\nDec 18, 2010\n\n#2\n\nThe only chaco mod where you get more clothes as you progress.\n\nI'm just teasing, good luck.

The fact that you're explaining the monsters' appearance on the island is really dinamic, you could make up a lot stuff that doesn't make sense while at the same time seems interesting.\n\nGood luck to you.\n\nDec 21, 2010 at 2:47 AM\n\nI don't anymore.\n\n\"I'm sorry Mario, but your princess is in another castle.\"\n\nJoin Date: Aug 9, 2010\n\nLocation: Greener Pastures\n\nPosts: 1188\n\nAge: 30\n\nDec 21, 2010\n\n#6\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_G4w81ir68\n\nA theme like this might work.

A lot of nostalgia with that game, haven't played it since I was around 4 but it was one of my favorites.
