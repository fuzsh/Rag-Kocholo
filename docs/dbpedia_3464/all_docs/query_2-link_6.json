        "text": "Earlier this year, I broke down and bought a pair of Chacos Z1s. I got these second hand for a good deal. I was looking for something to wear when fishing in a jon boat, as I do quite a bit in the Spring/Summer/Fall, and flip flops can sometimes get a little cumbersome. My Father in Law almost exclusively wears Chacos in the Summer, so he vouched for them.\n\nSo far, so good. I’ve had a lot of luck with these. They are super comfortable, and provide great support in the boat. I prefer to stand when fishing, and I’m usually in the boat for hours at a time.\n\nI came home from a fishing trip about a week ago, and noticed something:\n\nAnd more:\n\nOn the other shoe…\n\nThe soles were starting to separate from the shoes. Keep in mind I have about $30 invested in these, so it wasn’t that big a deal, but it got me thinking, could I just glue these myself? It’s a risk, but a $6 tube of glue worth it?\n\nI sent out the question to the RCS Hive Mind on Instagram, and the OVERWHELMING response was to spend the $40 and send them in for a resole. I know there are some Chaco Cult folks out there, and I really appreciated all the feedback. I also heard that I’ll have them back within two weeks…that’s good news.\n\nSo here are the ‘before’ images. I’ve got them packed up and ready to go – I’ll do a follow up post once they come back.\n\nDo any of you have any experience with Chaco resole? I’d love to hear it in the comments…"
