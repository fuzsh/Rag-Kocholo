        "text": "UTM posted recently raving about his Keen sandals the other day, so it got me thinking about some of the gear that I dig. There are a few things that I dig and use almost daily, and I figured while I am not by any means an expert I do know what I like and dislike about some of my gear so I figured I would share my experiences. Take note that I have added a \"Gear Review\" section in the categories listed above. This category will house my likes \"High Five\" and dislikes \"Kick in the Nuts\" primarily concerning gear but I could branch out into other things such as beer, events, places, etcâ€¦ you get the picture. Feel free to let me know what you think. Oh and I must warn you any negativity concerning PBR will not be tolerated and you will most assuredly have to deal with Brownie should you choose to bash this fine beer.\n\nThe first such gear choice are my beloved Chacos. High Fives all the way!!!!! For those of you not familiar with this product be prepared to be amazed. I personally give the UpaDowna endorsement to the Chaco Z/1. I have had these for a few years now and can not even begin to tell you how awesome these are. I have hiked extensively, waded in rivers and lakes, swam, played ultimate frisbee, climbed boulders and trees, explored waterfalls, biked, drank beer and tons more in these amazing sandals. Their ultra grippy vibram soles never give up and if they do, Chacos can be resoled!! If the strap wears out they can replace it!!! Buckle breaks you guessed it, it can be replaced! Seriously think about a pair of sandals that you can use forever. Just replace the worn out part and you are off for the next adventure. Average repair turn around time is 5 days once they receive them. As with anything there is always something negative, and for Chacos it is no different. The price is about the only negative aspect since they hover right around $100. However put it in context. These are the LAST pair of sandals you will EVER need. That money is well spent, hell Chacos are an investment that makes great sense. So I cannot say enough about these rugged do it all sandals. If you don't have a pair yet GO GET ONE."
