Established to preserve the rich natural and historical heritage of the region, this park is a testament to the diversity and resilience of the Chaco ecosystem. Through its history and the variety of life it harbors, the park invites deep exploration of its unique landscapes and offers an invaluable window into South American biodiversity.\n\nBrief history of Defensores del Chaco National Park\n\nFounded on the 6th of August, 1975 with the aim of commemorating veterans of the Chaco War and protecting a unique ecosystem, two years before the Ybycui National Park, the protected area spans an impressive 6859 square kilometers, serving as a conservation stronghold since its inception. Its name honors those who defended the territory in past conflicts, while its current management focuses on environmental protection and biodiversity conservation.\n\nEcological and cultural importance of the Chaco\n\nThe park is an epicenter of biological diversity, hosting endemic and endangered species. Additionally, it is a space of great cultural value, reflecting the history of the region and the ancestral practices of the indigenous peoples who inhabit its surroundings.\n\nHow to get to Defensores del Chaco National Park\n\nLocated in the heart of the Paraguayan Gran Chaco, access to the park can be made by land from the main cities of Paraguay, with routes that traverse changing landscapes until reaching this natural reserve.\n\nIt is located at coordinates 20°09′22″S latitude and 60°18′14″W longitude, providing a unique and diverse ecosystem.

Indiscriminate hunting, illegal trafficking and trade of species, excessive exploitation of forests, as well as the conversion of these into extensive pastures for agriculture and livestock, are just some of the actions causing a rapid loss of the country’s natural wealth.\n\nAdditionally, soil and water pollution, alteration of watercourses through the construction of hydroelectric dams, and the introduction of exotic species are contributing to ecosystem deterioration. As a result, many animals and plants are being affected, with many species now threatened or endangered.\n\nThis unchecked development model without proper planning is one of the main causes of biodiversity decline in Paraguay. It is crucial to prioritize sustainable use of natural resources and promote development that respects ecological balance, thus ensuring a better quality of life for future generations."
