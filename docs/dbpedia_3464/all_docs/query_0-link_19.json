        "text": "Every year the team and I pour our hearts into building Midwest House during SXSW. At the event, the days rush by and the details of the moment consume us. Event planners, you get this: Are there enough chairs on stage? Does the bar know what color tickets are valid for free drinks? Where's the next speaker? Is catering set up? Are the garbages empty? It's not til the end of the day, when the music starts pumping that I finally remember to take a breath. I cannot help but start bopping along. I might even start smiling (if you've come to SX you are familiar with my 'speeding ticket face'). We all simultaneously slow down and speed up. The energy during music is so alive. We start dancing next to strangers. Music connects us in a way other content simply cannot. For the people on the stage it is important, too. We love our big partners and our corporate partners and our brand partners. And we love that working with them allows us to provide paid opportunities for bands, musicians, and artists to showcase their work on a global stage. For a global audience. Our partnership with andrea (dre) wallace and Opnr is truly transformational for the artists and in turn adds so much texture and cache to our whole region. Shout out to Peter Fox who is behind the scenes making all this seem effortless and helping all of us in the audience create those core memories. üíò .\n\nWheelie, LLC asked me to join them on the Outside by Design podcast recently. We talked about superpowers, making big changes, side hustles as a creativity supercharger, how I trick myself into taking risks, and what's in store for my next chapter in a new industry. A year ago the idea of being on a podcast would have terrified me. The work I've done with Articulate with Hannah has given me the tools and confidence to approach an opportunity like this with a \"hell yes\" and that feels so good. Thanks to Lisa Slagle and Iris Matulevich for this fun conversation.\n\nThe #creativemornings invited me to speak last week on the topic of liminality. Special thanks to Kelly Brown for the invite and coaching. To Chelsea Warne for the social media support and cheerleading. To Emily Bode for the amazing comms. And Erica Hunt and Elbert D. Foster. Huge shout out to Adrian Butler for the tunes and Leigh Ann Cobb for the photos. AND Madcap Coffee Company, Mighty in the Midwest and Listening Room for sponsoring the event. A year ago I wouldn't have had the tools or confidence to get on this stage and share my story. Thanks to Hannah Michelotti for her AH-MAZING coaching and personalized approach to public speaking training ‚ú®. She is magic and has helped me change my life in so many ways that reach far beyond giving presentations. If you struggle with any aspect of public speaking or preparing presentations... contact her now and thanks me later üòâ.\n\nOne of the things Chaco should be recognized for is durability. Our z/sandals last many consumers a decade or more and can be repaired once worn out. But our brand health tracker results showed a lower score on this metric than they should have. So we came up with an experiential strategy to help improve consumer perceptions around durability - build a mobile factory bus and offer free repairs for our down-but-not-out product. Invite them in to see the process. Give them the opportunity to design their own custom pair and have it made right before their eyes. The bus just pulled in to the ReChaco garage after a summer careening around the country, dusty and full of memories. We met so many amazing folks and collected enough heartwarming stories to fill our social feeds for a year. Folks got on planes to get to the bus, they rerouted their vacations, they drove hundreds of miles. We met one man who climbed all the 14ers in Colorado in his Chacos and wrote a book about it. The field crew repaired over 800 pairs of sandals and built another 1000 pair of customs for excited members of the #ChacoNation. I am so proud of all the hard work the Chaco and Field Scout teams put in to make the Roving Repairs tour a reality. Shout out to Lyndi Bell who put her heart and soul (and sweat equity) into the strategy and execution of this mobile sandal factory and Katie Nguyen Huber, Handcar, and Someoddpilot for the incredible digital storytelling surrounding it.\n\nIt‚Äôs hard to have a life of adventure without playing with some friends along the way.... Chaco loves using what we do best (making sandals) as a canvas for unique partnerships with like-minded pals. For our latest collaboration, Chaco teamed up with country music‚Äôs male artist of the year, Thomas Rhett, to launch a collection of products inspired by his love of the outdoors. Like many great relationships, the convo about this collection started when TR slid into our Instagram DMs. The partnership felt like a natural fit since TR‚Äôs been wearing Chaco‚Äôs since his days back at summer camp. Check out the WWD article about the partnership to learn more and for a quote from yours truly. A huge shout out to all the amazing people on the Chaco team who brought this collection to life: Lyndi Bell Katie Nguyen Huber Adam Garrett Katherine Simons Lisa Kondrat Hannah Beurkens Ellen Evangelides Someoddpilot Jesse Green Handcar\n\nAcross the nation there has been a huge influx of consumers discovering the outdoors for the first time in 2020. Studies show 82% of them will stay engaged in the outdoors after restrictions lift. In fact, as restrictions lifted Chaco saw a surge of Z/sandal sales on chacos.com and through other online retailers. The combination of people discovering the outdoors, and the consumer mindset shift toward the functional benefits of products scored Chaco high marks in all the right categories. Through the lens of the Fit for Adventure campaign and the launch of the Chillos recovery slide, 2020 gave us the chance to bring Chaco to life in a way like never before. From a pivot to making masks for healthcare workers in our Michigan factory, to peaked brand awareness and off-the-charts results, celebrity sightings, and even Nintendo Switch. I‚Äôm super proud of the way the Chaco team, our parent company Wolverine Worldwide, our independent sales reps, and retail partners worked together to pivot and turn ‚Äúunprecedented times‚Äù into unprecedented results. Here's a short video of the year's highlights. Good things ahead. Special shoutout to: Lyndi Bell, Emily Bode, Katie Nguyen Huber, Adam Garrett, Craig H., Someoddpilot Inc, Josh Weichhand, Jesse Green.
