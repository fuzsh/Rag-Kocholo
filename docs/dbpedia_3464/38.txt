In this mod, you play as Chaco. It takes place a while before the original Cave Story. It explains where all of the strange, dangerous creatures on the island came from.

Story I'll show:

You wake up one day and realize that you might be late for the lunch you'd planned with Santa. You go there, and he reveals that someone has taken the bread. You search for it, and fall into a tunnel you can't get up from, and venture on from there. You find a crowbar and an H.E.V. suit at a mysterious underground house.

Work I have to show so far:

The only chaco mod where you get more clothes as you progress.

I'm just teasing, good luck. The sprites are pretty well done.

Thanks, I guess I'm better at making sprites than I thought I was.

I need to find some inspiration for a theme for Chaco, if there isn't one already.

Awesome idea, I honestly hope you'll finish this mod. The fact that you're explaining the monsters' appearance on the island is really dinamic, you could make up a lot stuff that doesn't make sense while at the same time seems interesting.

Good luck to you.

A theme like this might work. Hope you do well, Chaco is one of the few characters that hasn't been used in a mod.

That's great. A lot of nostalgia with that game, haven't played it since I was around 4 but it was one of my favorites. I could never beat it, it was too hard.

I'll use that as a base for the theme.

It turns out that mychar.bmp is a bit glitchy - cutting off sometimes, parts from other frames, etc.

That song is cool, and I like how your incorporating Half Life into CS like that. I think it's pretty unique. Also, the sprites are good.

It's not glitchy at all, you just need to keep the sprites in their designated 16x16 square and there won't be a problem... -_-'

that's kinda how sprites work...

That's exactly what I meant by glitchy, they're not in the right boundaries. What did you think I meant?

Fixed it, GIMP with a grid/the background squares aligned perfectly is great for this.

And the sprites were, in fact, broken.

I would argue that the only thing that would constitute as a mychar.pbm glitch would be the .exe having an issue in the code, causing it to behave incorrectly.

Misplaced sprites is simply a mistake (one I make all the time lol).

Remember boys and girls, Cave Story is a perfect divine creation and there are no glitches; only your own mortal mistakes.
