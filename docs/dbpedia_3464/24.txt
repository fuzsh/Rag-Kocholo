In one of the issues of EL DORADO (the journal of THE SOUTH AND CENTRAL AMERICAN MILITARY HISTORIANS SOCIETY) that Terry Hooker recently sent me in PDF format, there was a review of Adrian J. English’s THE GREEN HELL – A CONCISE HISTORY OF THE CHACO WAR BETWEEN BOLIVIA AND PARAGUAY 1932-35.

Although the book was published in 2007 by Spellmount Ltd., (ISBN 978 1 86227 445 7) this was the first I knew about it, and so I ordered one immediately. It arrived in the post today, and a quick glance through it indicates that it is even better than I had hoped.

This is hardly surprising as Adrian English is probably the doyen of English-speaking historians who specialise in the study of South American military history.

The book has chapters and sections entitled:

Chronology of Events

1. The Actors and the Stage

2. The Roots of Discord

3. Preparations for Conflict

4. The Dispute Escalates

5. The Road to War

6. The Opposing Forces

7. The First Paraguayan Offensive

8. The First Bolivian Counter-Offensive

9. The Second Paraguayan Offensive

10. The Third Paraguayan Offensive

11. The Second Bolivian Counter-Offensive

12. The Paraguayan Counter-Offensive

13. The War in The Air

14. The Fourth Paraguayan Offensive

15. The Closing Phase

16. Armistice and Peace Treaty

17. Summary

18. Epilogue

Appendix I: Bolivian Army Units

Appendix II: Major Equipment of the Bolivian Army

Appendix III: Material Captured by Bolivia During the War

Appendix IV: Aircraft of the Bolivian Air Force

Appendix V: Paraguayan Army Units

Appendix VI: Major Equipment of the Paraguayan Army

Appendix VII: Material Captured from the Bolivians by Paraguay During the War

Appendix VIII: Ships of the Paraguayan Navy

Appendix IX: Vessels of the Paraguayan Merchant Marine Mobilised and Incorporated into the Navy During the War

Appendix X: Aircraft of the Paraguayan Air Force and Naval Air Arm

The book seems to have just about every piece of information a wargamer would need to have to refight this war. All I have to do now is to resist the temptation to do so!
