        "text": "Dublin Independent Fashion Weekend is launching on Friday October 20 with an inaugural DIFW fashion show, panel discussion with PJ Kirby, live music and a visual art display. Designers showcasing their work at the event include Ríon Hannora, Aisling Duffy, Laoise Carey, Mar Knitwear, The Zero Waster, Shock of Grey and Seeking Judy. Tickets are available for the fashion show via www.eventbrite.com.\n\nGet a first look at some of the emerging independent fashion designers taking part in the event below …\n\nRíon Hannora\n\nEmpowering the alternative fashion scene in Ireland and abroad is Cork born Ríon Hannora. A breakthrough fashion designer, Hannora combines traditional methods of textile work with modern innovations to explore eco-friendly alternatives to fashion design by incorporating fabrics and materials that have already served their purpose. These fabrics are recycled and rejuvenated into bizarre and wonderful garments that could stand alone or on display in a museum. Bridging the gap between fine art and fashion, Ríon creates wearable art. Although she is a ‘slow fashion’ enthusiast she has worked alongside many designers and also worked on the production of Saint Laurent AW20 collection. www.rionhannora.com @rioncarnation\n\nAisling Duffy\n\nEmbracing slow fashion and sustainability is key to Aisling Duffy’s designs. Working with reclaimed fabrics she creates handmade collections, one-of-a-kind pieces and accessories from her studio in Dublin. Aisling studied at NCAD and The Edinburgh College of Art where she specialised in Printed Textile Design. Techniques such as patchworking, screen-printing and embellishment are at the core of each collection – a reflection of her background in surface design and work in the textile industry. Duffy’s label is inspired by 90s grunge baby dolls, day-dreaming, and playing dress up, ultimately creating unique pieces designed to be loved forever. www.aislingduffy.shop@aislingduffystudio\n\nLaoise Carey\n\nLaoise Carey is an independent fashion designer, designing and handmaking her collections in Co Tipperary. Carey is an advocate of the slow-fashion movement, aiming to reduce the textiles going to waste in landfill with every collection produced and all garments are handcrafted using vintage and re-purposed textiles. She is a graduate of NCAD with a BA in Fashion Design and has previously worked at Simone Rocha’s London studio for four seasons. www.laoisecareystudio.com\n\nMar Knitwear\n\nDriven by the exploration of textile manipulation and narrative through design, Mihai Mar designs and produces expressive concept-based collections of made-to-order bespoke garments and one-of-a-kind creations, each piece crafted to be a wearable artwork in their own right. Born in Romania and raised in Ireland, Mar’s textile journey began from a young age. From an unassuming puppetry project in art class, Mar became fascinated with handcrafted 3D story-driven characters. This pivotal moment would lead him to study in NCAD where he was introduced to an array of textile machinery and his love of knitting was born. Committed to ethical craftsmanship, Mar hand selects scavenged materials, waste yarns and sustainable natural fibres to create diverse collections under Mar Knitwear. www.mar-knitwear.com @mii_haii\n\nThe Zero Waster\n\nThe Zero Waster is an independent regenerative studio established by designer Sarah O’Neill, specialising in bespoke collections consisting of handmade and hand-dyed pieces. With a focus on sustainability through her process and practise through zero waste pattern cutting, repurposing existing garments, reclaimed fabrics and using Anthotype print methods, O’Neill is onstantly adapting her designs to be more responsible and conscious in her approach. www.thezerowaster.ie @the_zerowaster\n\nShock of Grey\n\nSarah Carroll Kelly makes bold, unique, handcrafted statement jewellery from unpredictable materials like wood, brass, plastic, silicone and acrylic. Kelly’s pieces, centred around bold, bright vivacious colours and playful shapes, are all designed, wood cut and painted and built in her studio in Dublin 8. Her background in both sculpture and digital design provided the foundations for making these mini wearable sculptures. www.shockofgrey.com @shockofgreyshop\n\nSeeking Judy\n\nA fashion and textile designer from Dundalk, currently based in Dublin, Megan McGuigan has a store called Seeking Judy in the Georges Street Arcade in Dublin. As well as having an office/studio in this space, her larger studio in Dundalk is where McGuigan has her machines, makes garment samples and shoots the lookbooks. McGuigan is also a Creative Spark Dundalk print studio member and since joining, has been able to learn and experiment a lot with printing styles and of course, learn from the amazing technicians and members there. www.seekingjudy.com @seekingjudy"
