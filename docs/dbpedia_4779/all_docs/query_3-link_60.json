He will be a free agent this winter.\n\nThe 32-year-old veteran had spent his entire 11-year career with the Royals, who selected him in the third round of the 2007 MLB draft.\n\nDuffy was 4-3 with a 2.51 ERA and 65 strikeouts in 61 innings pitched for the Royals this season. He is 68-68 with a 3.95 ERA in his career."
