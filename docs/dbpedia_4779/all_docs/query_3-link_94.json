        "text": "Cazenovia, N.Y. — A recruit for the New York State Police was charged after trying to take a training officer’s loaded gun last week.\n\nThe recruit, Jose L. Valeriano, 22, was meeting around 10 p.m. last Tuesday, July 23, with Trooper Cory Sprague when he started acting “erratically” and lunged for Sprague’s gun, according to Beau Duffy, a state police spokesperson.\n\nValeriano, of Hyde Park in Dutchess County, was talking with Sprague after saying he wanted to resign and leave the training academy at the former Cazenovia College in Madison County, Duffy said.\n\nValeriano grabbed at Sprague’s holstered gun with both hands, troopers said in court papers. Other academy staff members helped Sprague subdue Valeriano, Duffy said.\n\nThe gun was loaded with live rounds, Duffy said.\n\nOne of Sprague’s elbows was hurt during the struggle, troopers said. He was briefly hospitalized, Duffy said.\n\nValeriano was charged with second-degree attempted robbery and second-degree assault with the intent to prevent a law enforcement officer from performing their duties.\n\nHe posted $2,500 bail and was released from the Madison County Jail last Wednesday, July 24, Duffy said.\n\nThe case is awaiting action by a grand jury in Madison County Court, according to Chief Assistant District Attorney Robert Mascari.\n\nThe state police has about a year left on its lease of the buildings and athletic center of the closed Cazenovia College for use as a training academy. The college closed in spring 2023."
