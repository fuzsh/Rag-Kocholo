        "text": "New Students\n\nNew students will receive a printable, temporary Dashboard Parking Tag via email prior to Move-In Day. You must print it and place it on your car dashboard when arriving at campus. Please arrive at the Farinella Gate (which is the campus’ main entrance on South Orange Ave.). Public Safety officers will be stationed around campus to guide you from the Farinella Gate directly to the front of your residence hall to meet residence hall staff, check into your housing assignment, and receive your room key.\n\nOnly one vehicle will be permitted to arrive with you at your residence hall (extra vehicles will be directed immediately to the campus parking deck and items will need to be unloaded from there). Once you arrive at the unloading zone outside your hall, then you will unload all your items and immediately be asked to move your car to the parking deck. No car may remain in the unloading zone for more than 15 minutes, and a licensed driver must always remain with your vehicle while it is in the unloading zone (any students traveling alone will be assisted).\n\nReturning Students\n\nReturning students should arrive directly at your residence hall to meet residence hall staff, check into your housing assignment, and receive your room key. Then, you will be ready to unload your items. Please limit your time parked near the hall, to ensure a streamlined move-in process for other students – but take the time that you need to move items into your room. Once you have unloaded your items, you should move to the campus parking deck.\n\nFor more details on parking after Move-in Day, please visit the Parking Services Webpage .\n\nWhile preparing to pack your items, check out the What to Pack for Seton Hall Residence Halls webpage. We recommend coordinating with your roommate(s) and suitemate(s).\n\nIf you are interested in renting a MicroFridge (combination microwave and refrigerator), visit the MicroFridge website. While we partner with the MicroFridge vendor to coordinate them dropping off and picking up the units in the residence halls, they oversee the rest of the process. Therefore, you should contact the vendor directly with any questions.\n\nAdditionally, view a Residence Hall Virtual Room Tour to see an example room layout and residence hall furniture dimensions.\n\nPrior to each academic year, a Housing & Residence Life staff member inspects each room and assesses its condition – that assessment is called the Room Condition Report (RCR). Staff members take photos and write descriptions of any damage which exists prior to you moving into your room. That damage is documented into your RCR.\n\nAs per the Housing License Agreement , you must review and sign your RCR by Add/Drop Day (approximately one week into the semester). After that day, the RCR is finalized, and you are presumed to have agreed to it.\n\nAfter you move out of your room, a Housing & Residence Life professional staff member and a Department of Facilities professional staff member will again assess the room to close out your RCR. As per the Damage Billing Policy you may be assessed charges for any damage beyond \"normal wear and tear\".\n\nMore details will e provided to students when they check into their new room, but we highly recommend that you review your Room Condition Report (RCR) during your Move-In Day and report any updates to the room condition to HRL staff."
