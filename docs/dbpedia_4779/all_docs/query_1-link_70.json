        "text": "The annual AWA Release Liner Industry Leadership Award – established in 2016 and now an annual feature of the industry’s calendar – was presented during the recent AWA Global Release Liner Industry Conference & Exhibition in Denver, CO, USA. The award was presented to Sean Duffy, vice president, Sustainability & Regulatory Compliance, Elkem Silicones, on March 21, 2023.\n\nThis award provides peer and industry recognition to an individual who has demonstrated singular dedication, service, and leadership through their efforts to drive growth, innovation, and continuing success for the release liner industry.\n\nPresenting this special award for an outstanding contribution to the release liner industry, AWA Alexander Watson Associates’ president and CEO Corey Reardon said,\n\n“From the days he was directly driving the silicone release and pressure sensitive industry activities at Elkem to his current role, influencing the future of our industry, Sean has spent a large part of his career passionate about release liners, and inspiring so many on the topic. Sean’s outstanding contribution to the release liner and pressure sensitive industry has helped, in part, make the industry what it is today and will be tomorrow.”\n\nAt a special AWA Global Release Liner Industry Conference & Exhibition Dinner, sponsored by Mondi, the award was given, and acknowledgment and recognition by a packed room of key players across the value chain was provided with a standing ovation."
