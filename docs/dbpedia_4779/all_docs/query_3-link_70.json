        "text": "New York (CNN) — Google has pulled its controversial Olympics ad after critics blasted it for portraying what they called a bleak application of artificial intelligence.\n\nThe ad showed a father using Google’s Gemini AI chatbot to help his daughter write a fan letter to US Olympic track star Sydney McLaughlin-Levrone. But many online questioned why Google would want to replace a child’s creativity with words written by a computer.\n\nGoogle initially defended the ad, which ran during breaks from the Olympics, saying it showed how Gemini could provide a “starting point” for a piece of writing. But on Friday, the company reversed course.\n\n“While the ad tested well before airing, given the feedback, we have decided to phase the ad out of our Olympics rotation,” a Google spokesperson said in a statement.\n\nThe ad marked a striking miss for the tech giant, which has positioned Gemini as its answer to rival OpenAI’s ChatGPT and is working to incorporate the AI technology throughout its suite of products, including Google Search and Gmail.\n\nAnd it underscored a broader fear around artificial intelligence that the technology could take away jobs from people in creative fields, such as writers, musicians and visual artists.\n\nApple faced similar backlash earlier this year when it released an ad that showed symbols of human creativity — paint cans, musical instruments, a sculptural bust of a human head — being crushed by a giant hydraulic press and replaced by an iPad Pro, to the tune of Sonny & Cher’s “All I Ever Need Is You.” Apple quickly apologized for “missing the mark” with the advertisement.\n\nThe-CNN-Wire™ & © 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.
