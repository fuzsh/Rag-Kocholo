        "text": "Bob Duffy is passionate about using technology to create positive change. As Director of Product Experiences and Advocacy, Client Graphics, GPU IP and AI at Intel, Bob has championed initiatives that unleash tech for good, from ensuring clean water to providing more accessible creative tools for all. He created the Intel Software Innovator program – an initiative that empowers developers to leverage Intel’s technology – which led to several advances, including the Clean Water AI initiative: a low-cost system that uses machine learning to identify harmful bacteria in water samples.\n\nWe spoke with Bob to learn about the initiative, his role and career, and how he works with Intel colleagues and developers to unleash technology for good.\n\nCan you share some of the pivotal moments that stand out to you from your career at Intel?\n\nI’ve been fortunate to be part of many inspirational programs at Intel. However, a few projects stand out. I created the Intel Software Innovator program to empower external developers to innovate using Intel’s hardware and software. The program fostered amazing projects, including Clean Water AI, which tackles the real-world challenge of detecting bio-contaminants in water. The low cost of Clean Water AI empowers communities and organizations to take control of their water quality. This ensures everyone has access to safe drinking water, a basic human right.\n\nWhat excites you most about the potential for AI in creative fields and art?\n\nDigital tools and AI are a game-changer, especially for people like me who love creating but struggle with the time commitment of traditional art, like acrylic paintings and charcoal sketches. AI represents a future where creating art is faster and more accessible, and we are still just scratching the surface. I’ve seen firsthand how AI can revolutionize how designers work, allowing for faster iteration and further exploration. At Vision 2024, I showcased a demo that used AI to rapidly create photo-realistic visuals from basic CAD wireframes. Many designers at the show shared that seeing the potential of AI in this way shifted their perspective. They saw AI not as a replacement, but as a powerful assistant to accelerate their workflow. I feel fortunate that Intel allows me to play in this sandbox and create content and demos that would have seemed like science fiction just a few years ago.\n\nYou've mentioned the importance of community engagement. Can you say more about that?\n\nThrough the Intel Involved Volunteer Program, I’ve supported several community-focused initiatives, including a tech education series at the Folsom Library and youth programming at Sacramento HackerLab, a community space for tech enthusiasts to learn, collaborate, and build. Expertise and knowledge sharing go hand-in-hand for me. I’ve been a creator and artist for most of my life, always inspired to improve my art skills by observing the talents of others. Just like learning from other artists improved my creative skills, I believe in fostering a “skill contagion” in tech, by helping innovators grow their skills by experiencing the skills of others.\n\nI’ve also learned that it’s not just about skills, but about curiosity and asking the right questions. Sometimes just being curious, with a hunger to move something forward, is what makes the difference. I’ve carried this throughout my career at Intel.\n\nHow has team building played a role in your professional and personal success?\n\nRaising my son, who has a disability, has been a powerful teacher when it comes to teamwork. His day-to-day life requires the support and cooperation of many people. As a result, he is a constant reminder of the power and compassion of teamwork. Because of this, my instinct is not to isolate and protect. Instead, I try to collaborate and empower. It’s about working together to achieve a common goal. At Intel and beyond, strong team building is essential for tackling impactful projects. Teamwork wins – big or small – bring a sense of joy and accomplishment that’s shared by everyone involved."
