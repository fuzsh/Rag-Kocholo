        "text": "A gamer of sorts that has flashed in a variety of different settings. Has a knack for making something out of nothing. Creative when the pocket breaks down and does a nice job of keeping his eyes down the field while on the move. Equipped with a live arm that has proven to be rather accurate when he’s got his A game going. Not afraid to take a deep shot or challenge a tight coverage window. Started prep career off in California where he lost his entire junior year due to global pandemic. Ended up transferring into the national powerhouse that is IMG Academy for his senior season where he directed a run-heavy offense. Still managed to complete just under 64 percent of his passes with 13 touchdowns to go against four interceptions. Must cut down on mistakes and limit errant throws when he gets to college, but has a chance to win games at the Power 5 level one day given his skillset as he’s more than capable of making high-level throws. Likely to find the most success in a balanced single-back spread attack that has plenty of RPOs on the call sheet."
