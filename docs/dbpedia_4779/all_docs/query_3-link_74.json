        "text": "I'm really upset because it's clear eBay doesn't care about their sellers. It's bad enough how much they are charging us, any including tax and shipping in fees despite sellers not getting that money. But to make matters worse, more and more eBay just automatically gives refunds to buyers even when you gave clear evidence they are abusing the return policy. No wonder people are doing it more and more, with eBay giving out free money instead of reviewing the case and protecting the seller. Again, I have a buyer who kept a product for over a week (they clearly used it based on their pictures, although the pictures themselves were purposefully blurry) and tries to say the item wasn't as described but what they are complaining about was documented in various ways: the pictures included several with the defects circled and with a description box on the picture explaining the flaws in detail; then in the description, I included a detailed description of any flaws, told them which pictures to look at for further explanation, and even added a disclaimer that to please not buy the product if one is partial to any signs of use as it's sold as is and no returns are allowed. Of course, the ad also has checked of that no returns are accepted. The buyer waited 12 days after receiving the item and states the very flaws I meticulously listed and pictured but tried to say it wasn't listed! I don't know what else I can do at this point because it's a clear case of someone using the item and then trying to return, and the claim it wasn't detailed in the ad is clearly a lie just based on the ad itself. Yet I know exactly what will happen as always: the buyer will just wait till the time frame is up and eBay will automatically generate a refund and then I will have to fight then to get my money back. Anne the worst part is I'm noticing other sellers on here are now doing this as they know themselves that eBay does it. It's become almost a monthly process and since eBay doesn't even try to be fair and review the facts, and just gives out free products & money, of course more people are catching on and doing this! And then they keep charging us sellers more to make up for all the free handouts. It's becoming such a problem that I'm worried I'm going to have to stop selling on here. I don't get why they even try to pretend they have policies if they don't even follow them. It's really wrong and makes me feel bad about ebay after being a loyal customer and seller for numerous years. I feel disrespected and I feel the situation will only get worse as eBay clearly doesn't care about this concern that I see multiple people discussing on here. It's setting buyers up to be abused and cheated and eBay condones it by giving out refunds that no other store would give out simply because it's clear the buyers doing this are abusing returns. I'm actually shocked at how indifferent eBay is to this problem because it's been over two years that I've tried myself to get them to see this problem, and all I get is empty promises without any true respect or protection. Why is eBay letting such an obvious problem go for years now! I'm basically writing this in desperation because I don't know that else to do.\n\nI don't know, last week Ebay cancelled a completed auction due to a bad buyer account that actually had had some bidding on it - sometimes its like blaming the mall owner for our store's problems.\n\nIf ebay was to provide the level of support we often seem to want, they would need to greatly increase fees to pay for the staff.\n\nOne solution is right here on these boards where we help each other.\n\nHow does a dress store deal with the problem of people buying dresses on Friday, wearing them to the wedding Saturday and then returning them on Monday? The mall owner certainly has nothing to do with the bad buyers-unless say mall security is supposed recognize them and escort them back out. What do store owners do, this is a real problem. Can it be applied to online issues?\n\nOne thing that has made things easier for me dealing with problems is to realize there is no \"there there\" in reference to Ebay - its not like they are managers of the flea market or mall - it is just software and you can't invest personally in it like you would say at a flea market or retail situation.\n\nEbay doesn't seem to take into account how these false claims really hurt small sellers, it is real money to us, and we can't just write it off. But it would cost many times their value to judge, its just not worth it on any business plan, even the sellers - how much time should you spend to recover $20? and that is one way the scumbags game us.\n\nThis month is my 24th anniversary of selling on eBay. I've seen a LOT of changes - some good, some really bad. The lack of fair, equitable, and common sense seller protections is one of the really bad changes.\n\nA real case in point:\n\nAbout 20 years ago I sold a used item that was honestly and comprehensively detailed both in written description and with a lot of clear photos. It was also listed \"As-Is, No Returns\". Exactly similar to your situation, my buyer complained about things that were pointed out and honestly detailed. I said \"No\" to his request to return the item. He got his knickers in a twist and in a snot-flying rage got eBay CS involved. An actual live CS Rep (back then) looked at the situation and in just a few moments told the buyer, and I quote, \"If the terms in the listing were not acceptable to you, you should not have purchased the item to begin with\". Case closed in my favor, no appeals.\n\nFast forward to today and eBay's Customer-No-Service and bots making the stupid, wrong decisions.\n\nThat is the reason why I sell a lot of brand new, sometimes factory-sealed items when I can, and my fingers are crossed when I sell used items. Today, I'm ready to either refund the item after its return, or lose the item and refund at a full loss and as a cost of doing business here.\n\nI also no longer use eBay to sell any items that are of such a higher value that my business model cannot afford to lose. That is reserved for CraigsList or another local venue, where the buyer shows up in person, accepts the item as-is, pays with cash, no shipping or return scams, and leaves with a handshake. It's too bad that eBay is potentially losing billions of dollars of revenue from sellers who no longer sell higher-value items here because of its lack of real and equitable seller protections and common sense.\n\nIt's very frustrating, but I've adjusted my expectations and adapted to the limitations that eBay unfairly imposes on us sellers. I've found other ways of successfully selling items I can't afford to lose. EBay's loss, not mine.\n\nCheers, Duffy"
