        "text": "For the \"Tracking uploaded on time and validated\" metric alone, your rating will never go below Above Standard, as long as you or Pirateship make sure that the sales in question have been \"Marked As Shipped\" in your Seller Hub. It can drop you out of TRS to Above Standard, but not lower than that by itself.\n\nI sell a lot that uses USPS First Class Letter or First Class Envelope, where the USPS does not even issue tracking numbers. EBay makes allowances for this in service metrics, as long as a seller makes sure that those items are marked as shipped in their Seller Hub > Orders. I use Stamps.com for all of my shipping, and it automatically marks my FC Large Envelope sales as shipped for me at eBay, without a tracking number. For those FC Letter items I send with a stamp or two, I manually mark them as shipped in my Orders tab. That is the only metric that has me below TRS, at 66%, but a seller will not drop below Above Average just on \"Tracking uploaded on time and validated\".\n\nSO unless TRS status is important to you (it never materially helped my sales when I had it), it is nothing to worry about on its own if you make sure the affected sales are marked as shipped... UNLESS a scamming buyer wants to claim that they never received the item, at which time you'll have to refund them. That is the only caveat, and with a couple thousand USPS First Class sales, only a handful over the years had to be refunded.\n\nIf you're still concerned about no tracking number being allowed to be uploaded, do NOT telephone what appears to be eBay Customer Service. It's an outsourced joke and is actually Customer No-Service where they will lie or tell you anything just to get you off the phone. Instead, contact an actual eBay employee at eBay For Business on Facebook and use the message button in the upper right to get things started. The actual eBay employees on the other end have been quite helpful in the past for a lot of us sellers.\n\nCheers, Duffy\n\n.\n\nIt's hard to say whether the interface is broke on the eBay side or the Pirate Ship side. I have used Pirate Ship for quite some time. When you generate the label on Pirate Ship there is a little copy tracking number to the right of the tracking number that you can click on and copy the tracking number to the clipboard.\n\nYou then just go into the eBay order and add the tracking information into the order, the carrier should fill in automatically, and save the information.\n\nI use Pirate Ship for a number of reasons including the cash back credit card for label payment mentioned by very-nice-finds. While I seldom ship with UPS I was burned once by eBay with surcharges on a label, something I do not worry about with Pirate Ship. Also I have found Pirate Ship to have slightly better discounted rates than eBay does on occasion. Pirate Ship does not have FedEx as a carrier option but I never ship FedEx anyway\n\n@martin2001 wrote:\n\nWhen you check your tracking number on the USPS site, does it show your information or someone else's? Depending on what it shows, you need to contact either pirateship or ebay customer service, one of them needs to fix it.\n\nIt shows all the correct info. on USPS website, as well as Pirate Ship which has a nice tracking window. The \"real\" shipping process is also fine and packages physically proceed as normal. The order also gets marked as shipped in eBay automatically but won't allow the tracking number to be uploaded, even manually. I'm pretty sure it's something on eBay's end.\n\nWe just had another one happen today (5/9).\n\nWe also had an older instance that actually let me upload the tracking number (although it had long since been delivered). That's another reason why I think this is some kind of system issue with old tracking numbers not getting \"released\" in the right time frame by however eBay validates the number.\n\nIf it became a big issue a workaround should be to catch the problem tracking numbers by reviewing orders list and then void and print new labels for any that don't show the tracking upload. We haven't gotten to that point yet."
