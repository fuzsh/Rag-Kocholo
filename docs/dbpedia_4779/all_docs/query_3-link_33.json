        "text": "The Bobcats head into the 2024 season drastically impacted by the new realities of the transfer portal. What began in 2018 as a system by which the ‘Cats added or lost a handful of players has grown this year into a team-transforming event.\n\nAccording to 247Sports, from 2018-2023, Ohio gained or lost a total of 37 players while the number of transfers listed for this season alone was 45.\n\nThe brunt of the key losses are shouldered by the offense, as at least 11 players who started or were major contributors in 2023 are gone including former MAC MVP QB Kurtis Rourke. The turnover leaves Ohio with two returning starters from the 2023 offense and a handful of important contributors who may assume bigger roles.\n\nFiguring out how Ohio will look offensively is perhaps the biggest mystery of the preseason, as they also gained a number of experienced and talented players through the portal.\n\nThe challenge for head coach Tim Albin and his staff then is a new one in getting all of the players on the same page to field a cohesive unit. If the ‘Cats can do that, they have a solid chance to exceed 2023 offensive production which was statistically near the middle of the MAC last season in several categories.\n\nWith that, we examine the new-look offense.\n\nQuarterbacks\n\nDepartures:\n\nKurtis Rourke (transfer to Indiana)\n\nCJ Harris (transfer to Cal)\n\nArrivals:\n\nMatthew Papas (incoming recruit)\n\nNick Poulos (incoming recruit)\n\nIncumbents:\n\nParker Navarro\n\nCallum Wither\n\nJacob Winters\n\nAn end of an era happened with the close of the 2023 season, as a quarterback named Rourke will not be a central figure for the first time since 2017. Nathan Rourke burst on to the scene, appearing in 39 games while leading the ‘Cats to three straight bowl wins in 2017-2019. Nathan also led the MAC in touchdowns accounted for in each of his three seasons finishing with the second most touchdowns accounted for in MAC history since 1962 (111).\n\nKurtis Rourke picked up the torch after the 2019 season, appearing in 36 games, winning the MAC MVP in 2022 while guiding his team to a MAC championship appearance and contributing to back-to-back 10 win seasons.\n\nThe brothers had prolific combined career production, passing for 15,107 yards and 110 touchdowns while rushing for 3,471 yards and 60 touchdowns.\n\nAnd while the Rourkes were special players, the ‘Cats have some promising players on-roster, starting with QB1 Parker Navarro.\n\nNavarro appeared in eight games so far with the ‘Cats, leading the team to a bowl win over the Georgia Southern Eagles last year in his most significant game action as a Bobcat.\n\nWhile a small sample size of game action, Navarro appears very capable of leading the Bobcats offense to significant success. Against the Eagles, Navarro looked poised and operated the action well, leading the ‘Cats to 41 points (aided a great defensive day which including five turnovers).\n\nNavarro’s skill set as an athletic, dual-threat QB also fits well within the Bobcat’s offensive philosophy that provides ample opportunity for the QB to make an impact on the ground as well as through the air. If the ‘Cats are successful on offense this year, look for Navarro to be a significant factor in the rushing attack.\n\nThe Bobcats will look to some additional players to step up and push Navarro while establishing themselves as the next man up. Callum Wither and Jacob Winters have not seen game action for the ‘Cats but Wither has been in the system for several years and there are reports that Winters has impressed for a younger player. We’ll likely see in the non-conference schedule which QB has the lead for the backup role.\n\nRunning backs\n\nDepartures:\n\nSieh Bangura (transfer to Minnesota)\n\nO’Shaan Allison (transfer to Austin Peay)\n\nBryce Kitrell (graduation)\n\nQuintell Quinn (transfer to Texas Southern)\n\nArrivals:\n\nAnthony Tyus III (transfer from Northwestern)\n\nDuncan Brune (incoming recruit from Germany)\n\nIncumbents:\n\nNolan McCormick\n\nRicky Hunt Jr.\n\nDevon Hunter\n\nAginon Wilson Jr.\n\nThe backfield will have a new look with Sieh Bangura and O’Shaan Allison hitting the portal after combining last year for 1,263 yards rushing and 10 TDs while adding 27 pass receptions for 183 yards and two scores.\n\nDespite the departures, the 2024 Bobcats feature a blend of experience and promise and, depending on how the reworked O-line and other blockers perform, should be more productive than 2023 when Ohio ranked mid-MAC with 3.9 per carry.\n\nHead coach Tim Albin has also emphasized throughout the offseason a desire to include more two-back sets in the offense due to the amount of talent in the room. Since his arrival in Athens, the Bobcats have typically spread the bulk of the workload among a primary and secondary running back with the occasional exception such as Beau Blankenship in 2012 (312 carries) and Bobcat Hall of Famer Kalvin “All Day” McRae toting the rock 294 times in 2007.\n\nRedshirt freshman Ricky Hunt Jr. will get his shot after his breakout game in the bowl win over Georgia Southern last year where he garnered MVP accolades while scoring a program bowl record five touchdowns and 133 yards rushing and receiving.\n\nBefore transferring to Ohio for this season, Anthony Tyus III played three years at Northwestern and recorded 119 carries for 504 yards and two scores while adding ten receptions and another score. Tyus was a versatile athlete in high school, lettering in basketball, track, and football and had offers from at least eight MAC schools. Tyus III also brings some significant size to the room weighing in at around 225 last season.\n\nNolan McCormick has appeared in 14 games for the ‘Cats showing himself to be a reliable north-south runner with soft hands, combining for a career 116 touches for 493 yards and two scores.\n\nWide receivers\n\nDepartures:\n\nSam Wiglusz (graduation)\n\nMiles Cross (transfer to Indiana)\n\nJacoby Jones (transfer to UCF)\n\nTyler Walton (transfer to Eastern Michigan)\n\nKeegan Wilburn (transfer to Bryant)\n\nAramoni Rhone (transfer to Arkansas-Pine Bluff)\n\nJailen Hammer (transfer portal, has not signed per 247Sports.com)\n\nMajor Brown (graduation)\n\nKJ Howard (graduation)\n\nChristian Hilton (not on online roster)\n\nArrivals:\n\nColeman Owen (transfer from Northern Arizona)\n\nDelaney Crawford (transfer from Virginia, former QB)\n\nEian Pugh (transfer from Illinois)\n\nEamonn Dennis (transfer from Michigan)\n\nMax Rodarte (transfer City College of San Francisco)\n\nKaden Hurst (incoming recruit)\n\nMiles Cremascoli (income recruit)\n\nHunter Thompson (incoming recruit)\n\nDom Dorwart (incoming recruit)\n\nRiley Neer (incoming recruit)\n\nIncumbents:\n\nChase Hendricks\n\nRodney Harris II\n\nKhamani Debrow\n\nJack Borer\n\nDesmond Duffy\n\nRyan McDole\n\nMatthew Stuewe\n\nCaleb Gossett\n\nAs the arrivals and departures above strongly suggest, the starting WR group will be nearly completely rebuilt when it comes to 2024 game days. The ‘Cats departing after 2023 accounted for a staggering 92.5 percent of the catch production in the WR group, as the returnees to the roster combine for just 12 catches over their careers.\n\nThis is not to say the 2024 WR group cannot accomplish big things in 2024, but what they might get done on game day is one of the biggest unknowns heading into the season.\n\nIncumbent Chase Hendricks figures to be featured prominently as he was a regular contributor in 2023 with 11 catches as only a true freshman.\n\nRodney Harris II is back for his third season after making his first career catch in the bowl game last year and will have a chance to make a case for more playing time.\n\nThe ‘Cats brought in some more experienced options via the portal as well to try and shore up competition in the group.\n\nColeman Owen transferred in from FCS, Northern Arizona for this winter where he was a standout in the Lumberjacks program, appearing in 39 games while finishing top ten all-time in program history in career receptions (177), yards receiving (2,272), and touchdowns (17).\n\nJUCO Max Rodarte picked up first-team all-conference honors with 45 catches for 790 yards and nine scores last year.\n\nThree recruits from big-time schools also signed later in the 2024 offseason, including Virginia’s Delaney Crawford, Illinois’ Eian Pugh and Michigan’s Eamonn Dennis.\n\nAssisting the group in the transition to 2024 is new WR coach Andre Allen who has about 30 years of coaching experience on offense at the JUCO and FBS levels with the majority of his experience at City College of San Francisco.\n\nTight ends\n\nDepartures:\n\nTyler Foster (transferred to Oklahoma State)\n\nWill Kacmarek (transferred to Ohio State)\n\nAlec Burton (transfer portal, no new team listed)\n\nArrivals:\n\nJake Bruno (transfer from FCS St. Francis [PA])\n\nBeau Blankenship (transfer from Marshall)\n\nNick Segarra (incoming recruit)\n\nAJ Miller (incoming recruit)\n\nAiden Lowery (incoming recruit)\n\nBlake Guffey (transfer from D-II Notre Dame College)\n\nIncumbents:\n\nMason Williams\n\nBryce Butler\n\nThe transfer portal leaves the ‘Cats a far less experienced group in 2024, as the experience of 100 combined appearances depart with Alec Burton, Tyler Foster and Will Kacmarek all in new locations for the upcoming season.\n\nThe Bobcats have used a lot of tight end groups in the past and figure to need a minimum of two or three from the arrivals or incumbents to step up in 2024.\n\nRedshirt freshman Mason Williams was already in the plans last season, appearing in multiple games before an injury sidelined him. Williams figures to be an impact starter as soon as this year as he looked the part when playing last season.\n\nBryce Butler returns for his fourth year with the ‘Cats and was in the mix last year appearing in 13 games with his first career Bobcat TD, a nine-yard catch against the LIU Sharks.\n\nJoining Williams and Butler is St. Francis transfer Jake Bruno, who may get a chance to make an impact in 2024 if he can make the jump from FCS to FBS. Bruno saw action in 22 career games and was a solid contributor in the passing game for St. Francis last season with 10 catches and two scores.\n\nOffensive line built around a returning core of starters and contributors\n\nDepartures:\n\nKurt Danneker (medical retirement)\n\nShedrick Rhodes Jr. (transfer to Rutgers)\n\nJay Amburgey (graduation)\n\nJoe Oakes (graduation)\n\nHark Sohi (no longer on online roster)\n\nDemond Arter (portal entry, withdrawn, not on online roster)\n\nArrivals:\n\nTigana Cisse (transfer from FCS Idaho)\n\nBen Maldonado (JUCO transfer)\n\nCarson Heidecker (transfer from D-II Notre Dame College)\n\nTrent Allen (transfer from D-II Davenport [MI])\n\nZach Reiners (transfer from D-III Centre College)\n\nAndrew Erby (incoming recruit)\n\nCharlie Nowinsky (incoming recruit)\n\nSeth Anstead (incoming recruit)\n\nJase Miller (incoming recruit)\n\nJakob Lemus (incoming recruit)\n\nBryce Parson (incoming recruit)\n\nIncumbents:\n\nParker Titsworth\n\nChristophe Atkinson\n\nJacob Dennison\n\nJoseph Habinowski\n\nDavion Weatherspoon\n\nDane Jackson\n\nKaden Rogers\n\nJake Skelly\n\nKam Wright\n\nAidan Johnson\n\nJarian Shelby\n\nWhen Ohio takes the field against Syracuse on August 31st for the season opener, they’ll have to replace replace both tackles and a guard in 2024. The obvious replacement for left tackle is program staple Jacob Dennison. Since transferring in from Jacksonville State for the 2022 season, the Mansfield, Ohio product has appeared in 23 games with five spot starts.\n\nThe new right tackle and left guard looks less resolved at this point.\n\nIf healthy, Senior Joe Habinowski is an experienced option at either position, having appeared at guard and tackle for 15 games.\n\nThe competition for the remaining spots was bolstered by some experienced smaller-school transfers. Carson Heidecker and Trent Allen transferred in from DII while Tigana Cisse transferred from Idaho (FCS) and Ben Maldonado from JUCO.\n\nFans will also some familiar faces from the 2023 squad beginning with two returning interior starters.\n\nOn an offense working to gel, center Parker Titsworth should be a central figure to that effort having the intelligence and experience to lead. A four-time All-MAC Academic selection with over 35 game appearances, Titsworth is well versed in the Bobcat way and can function as “the coach on the field” to get everyone on the same page.\n\nThree-time All-MAC Academic guard Christophe Atkinson returns for 2024. Atkinson has a blend of versatility and experience, working his way into the lineup as a backup at right and left guard while ultimately winning the starting job at right guard in 2023. Atkinson enters 2024 with 34 appearances as a Bobcat.\n\nNext in the series we look at defense, a group returning an experienced core to build upon for 2024."
