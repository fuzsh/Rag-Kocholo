        "text": "With camp underway and the season rapidly approaching, our team took the time to rank the offenses in the Mountain West. The top pick was unanimous, but there was plenty of parity when ranking the rest of the teams. Here are the results:\n\nAll of the stats are per the Mountain West Conference official website.\n\n1. Boise State\n\n2023 stats: 32.1 ppg, 214.9 rushing ypg, 221.3 passing ypg\n\nNot really a huge surprise here, as the Broncos return the best offensive weapon in the conference in last year’s Offensive Player of the Year Ashton Jeanty. The Broncos also return four of five starters at offensive line and have a deep wide receiver room. There is some uncertainty at quarterback between Malachi Nelson and Maddux Madsen, but both guys are capable of being one of the best quarterbacks in the conference. It will be interesting to see who the number one receiver is at the end of the season.\n\n2. UNLV\n\n2023 stats: 34.4 ppg, 173.5 rushing ypg, 239.2 passing ypg\n\nThere is some uncertainty at the quarterback position after freshman sensation Jayden Maiava transferred. But with a weapon like Ricky White III and plenty of returning production in the running back room, this should be a loaded offense for the Rebels. Whoever ends up taking the bulk of the snaps at quarterback will have no shortage of weapons at wide receiver. The Rebels are loaded with speed and will be a threat to go deep all the time. The offensive line did show some weaknesses late last season, but it should be a strength for this team.\n\n3. Fresno State\n\n2023 stats: 30.5 ppg, 105.5 rushing ypg, 282.2 passing ypg\n\nThe Bulldogs have the preseason picks for top quarterback in the conference in Mikey Keene and have plenty of talented wide receivers to sling the ball around. The late departure of head coach Jeff Tedford leaves this offense with plenty of question marks. But dynamic running back Malik Sherrod is back. The success of this offense is going to come down to building a more consistent rushing attack and keeping Mikey Keene clean; he took some brutal hits last season and his health cost the Bulldogs some games late in the season.\n\n4. Colorado State\n\n2023 stats: 26.1 ppg, 92.2 rushing ypg, 306.5 passing ypg\n\nThe Rams are loaded with talent, but will they be able to overcome their recent trend of underachieving? Sophomore quarterback Brayden Fowler-Nicolosi is a gunslinger with a cannon for an arm and a ton of potential. He will need to overcome his tendency to force passes; the Rams turned the ball over way too much last season. They will lean heavily on super senior wide receiver Tory Horton, who will likely be playing on Sundays next fall. Consistency is key for the Rams this season. If they can be consistent, they will surprise a lot of teams.\n\n5. Utah State\n\n2023 stats: 33.2 ppg, 184.4 rushing ypg, 254.2 passing ypg\n\nThe Aggies finished last season as the leader in total yards per game. The talent is there with this team, but the uncertainty at quarterback and the late dismissal of head coach Blake Anderson have left this team with more questions than answers. Will Iowa transfer Spencer Petras be the guy at quarterback, or will Utah transfer Bryson Barnes end up taking over the reins? Regardless of who the quarterback is, they are lucky to have a weapon at wide receiver like Jalen Royals. A name to keep an eye on is running back Robert Briggs, Jr. He is a candidate for breakout player of the year.\n\nTied 6. Air Force\n\n2023 stats: 27.8 ppg, 281.5 rushing ypg, 85.0 passing ypg\n\nThe middle-of-the-road ranking for a team that lost nearly all of its offensive production might seem optimistic, but if there is one thing we have learned about the Falcons over the years, it is that they will be able to run the ball. And they will do it with authority. The Falcons will be featuring a new quarterback, new running back, and new fullback, so there are some reasons to be concerned. But, our team trusts that Troy Calhoun and his staff will keep the offense going strong.\n\nTied 6. Hawaii\n\n2023 stats: 21.4 ppg, 76.1 rushing ypg, 276.4 passing ypg\n\nThis ranking might seem a bit optimistic after the Rainbow Warriors finished last season near the bottom of the conference in points per game. But with senior quarterback Brayden Schager returning and sophomore receiver Pofele Ashlock continuing to improve, this group seems like a solid candidate to be the most improved offense in the conference. It will probably come down to the offensive line. This group has really struggled in recent years and will need to be much better if this team is going to succeed this fall.\n\n8. Wyoming\n\n2023 stats: 25.3 ppg, 158.5 rushing ypg, 168.5 passing ypg\n\nWe got a sneak peak of new Cowboy quarterback Evan Svoboda when he filled in for Andrew Peasley against Texas. He was efficient, but not spectacular. However, Wyoming fans are really excited for Svoboda’s future; his size and arm strength have drawn comparison to former Cowboy great Josh Allen. Svoboda’s success may come down to running back Harrison Waylee staying healthy. Waylee was super productive last season but battled injuries over the course of the season. If Waylee can stay healthy and Svoboda can live up to his potential, it could be a special season for the Cowboys. But the recent product and lack of success on the offensive side of the ball has made our team hesitant to rank the Cowboys higher.\n\n9. San Diego State\n\n2023 stats: 20.5 ppg, 154.3 rushing ypg, 171.8 passing ypg\n\nThe Aztecs were a mess last year on offense and even struggled to run the ball at times last season. However, San Diego State has brought in an offensive mastermind in Sean Lewis. There are so many unknowns for this squad. This team has some intriguing talent on the offensive side of the ball. Colorado State transfer wide receiver Louis Brown IV gives the Aztecs a unique weapon that can stretch the field and running back Jaylon Armstead seems poised for a breakout season. The quarterback position will be interesting to watch. True freshman Danny O’Neil was committed to Lewis when he was the offensive coordinator at Colorado and followed him to San Diego. The Aztecs also brought in Florida State transfer AJ Duffy. This offense has potential; it will be interesting to see if they can put it all together.\n\n10. San Jose State\n\n2023 stats: 31.8 ppg, 184.1 rushing ypg, 219.5 passing ypg\n\nAs you can see, our team expects the Spartans to take a massive step back this fall. The Spartans had the number four offense in the conference last fall but lost their starting quarterback in Chevan Cordeiro. Our team anticipates the offense being the weakness of this team under new head coach Ken Niumatalolo. It will be interesting to see what kind of offensive philosophy Niumatalo brings to San Jose. It is clear that they will not be running the triple option that his teams at Navy did. Will they be run heavy? Or will they have a more balanced attack?\n\n11. Nevada\n\n2023 stats: 17.3 ppg, 124.8 rushing ypg, 175.2 passing ypg\n\nNevada’s offense was bad last season...historically bad. Watching the Wolf Pack on offense last season was frustrating to say the least. They have made some changes that should have them heading in the right direction. Chubba Purdy should be an upgrade at quarterback. and new head coach Jeff Choate will instill a toughness in the trenches that this team hasn’t had in recent seasons. Don't be surprised to see Choate and his staff lean on the running game and try to find success by controlling the clock.\n\n12. New Mexico\n\n2023 stats: 27.3 ppg, 192.7 rushing ypg, 217.9 passing ypg\n\nWhile it was close, our team has the Lobos in the bottom spot. They lost their star running back to the transfer portal and new head coach Bronco Mendenhall and his staff have had to scramble to fill the roster with late additions from the transfer portal. Quarterback Devon Dampier showed a lot of potential late last season and has given the fan base some reasons to feel optimistic. Dampier is a dual threat quarterback that is a dynamic runner, but he will need to be more consistent throwing the ball. Like many Mountain West teams, there are a lot of unknowns for the Lobos.\n\nYour turn: How would you rank the offenses in the Mountain West? What changes would you make?
