Her discography began with the release of one Welsh language extended play using her birth name, Aimée Duffy, and she has appeared on two soundtrack albums, as well as on a studio album by Mint Royale in 2004. Duffy's range of musical genres incorporates styles such as blue-eyed soul,[1] pop[2] and pop rock.[3] Aimée Duffy, her debut extended play (EP), was released in 2004 by Welsh music label Recordiau Awen Records,[4][5] following her success on the Welsh talent show WawFfactor in 2003.[6][7] Following this release, a performance of Richard J. Parfitt's \"Oh Boy\" brought her to the attention of Duffy's former manager, Jeanette Lee of Rough Trade Records.[8]\n\nHer debut single, \"Rockferry\", was released in late 2007, and charted at number 45 on the UK Singles Chart.[9] Her follow-up single, \"Mercy\", was internationally released, charting inside the top ten on 15 international singles charts, as well as reaching number one on eight of these.[10][11] \"Mercy\" was the third-biggest-selling single of 2008 in the United Kingdom.[12] This came after staying at number one on the UK Singles Chart for five weeks.[13] Duffy's debut album Rockferry, was released on 3 March 2008, and became the biggest selling album of that year in the UK.[12] Her follow-up singles, \"Warwick Avenue\" and \"Stepping Stone\", did not replicate her early success, although they still sold well; for example \"Warwick Avenue\" charted at number 3 on the UK Singles Chart.[14] Her fifth single, \"Rain on Your Parade\", was released in December 2008. Rockferry was the fourth-best-selling album of 2008 worldwide, according to the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry, and since its release the album has sold over six million copies worldwide.[15] The album won the Grammy Award for Best Pop Vocal Album at the 51st Annual Grammy Awards.[16]\n\nDuffy released her second album, titled Endlessly on 29 November 2010, which to date has charted in most major markets.[17] The lead single from the album, \"Well, Well, Well\", was released on 21 November 2010.[17] Duffy also contributed to the films soundtracks of The Boat That Rocked, Patagonia and Legend.\n\nStudio albums\n\n[edit]\n\nTitle Details Peak chart positions Sales Certifications\n\n(sales thresholds) UK\n\n[18] AUT\n\n[19] DEN\n\n[20] GER\n\n[21] IRE\n\n[22] NL\n\n[23] NZ\n\n[24] SWE\n\n[25] SWI\n\n[26] US\n\n[27] Rockferry\n\nReleased: 3 March 2008\n\nLabel: A&M (#175 642–3)\n\nFormat: CD, digital download, LP\n\n1 2 1 3 1 2 1 1 1 4\n\nWorld: 9,000,000 (as of 2016)[28]\n\nUK: 2,230,000 (as of 2021)[29]\n\nEU: 4× Platinum[30]\n\nUK: 7× Platinum[31]\n\nAUS: 2× Platinum[32]\n\nAUT: Platinum[33]\n\nDEN: 4× Platinum[34]\n\nGER: 4× Gold[35]\n\nIRL: 3× Platinum[36]\n\nNZ: 3× Platinum\n\nSWE: Platinum[37]\n\nSWI: 3× Platinum[38]\n\nUS: Gold[39]\n\nEndlessly\n\nReleased: 29 November 2010\n\nLabel: A&M\n\nFormat: CD, digital download\n\n9 17 2 15 3 6 19 4 10 72\n\nUK: 205,000 (as of 2021)[29]\n\nUK: Gold[31]\n\nDEN: Gold[40]\n\nSWE: Gold[41]\n\nSWI: Gold[42]\n\nExtended plays\n\n[edit]\n\nTitle Details Aimée Duffy[a]\n\nReleased: 2004[44]\n\nLabel: Awen\n\nFormat: CD, digital download\n\nLive from London[b]\n\nReleased: 25 February 2008\n\nLabel: Polydor, Mercury\n\nFormat: Digital download\n\nFNMTV Live[c]\n\nReleased: 2008\n\nLabel: Mercury\n\nFormat: Digital download\n\nDeluxe EP\n\nReleased: 3 February 2009[48][49]\n\nLabel: Mercury\n\nFormat: CD, digital download\n\nLive at the Theater of\n\nLiving Arts – 6 August 2008\n\nReleased: 23 November 2009[45]\n\nLabel: Polydor\n\nFormat: Digital download\n\nSpotify Session[d]\n\nReleased: 2010\n\nLabel: Polydor\n\nFormat: Online streaming[50]\n\nNRJ Live Sessions: Duffy\n\nReleased: 4 February 2011[51]\n\nLabel: Polydor\n\nFormat: Digital download\n\nSingles\n\n[edit]\n\nTitle Year Peak chart positions Certifications Album UK\n\n[18] AUT\n\n[19] DEN\n\n[20] GER\n\n[21] IRE\n\n[22] NL\n\n[23] NZ\n\n[23] SWE\n\n[25] SWI\n\n[26] US\n\n[52] \"Rockferry\" 2007 45 — — — — — — — 35 — Rockferry \"Mercy\" 2008 1 1 2 1 1 1 4 3 1 27\n\nUK: 2× Platinum[31]\n\nAUS: Platinum[53]\n\nDEN: 2× Platinum[54]\n\nGER: Platinum[35]\n\nNZ: Gold[55]\n\nSWI: Gold[56]\n\nUS: Platinum[39]\n\n\"Warwick Avenue\" 3 17 7 12 11 9 15 16 12 —\n\nUK: Platinum[31]\n\nDEN: Platinum[54]\n\n\"Stepping Stone\" 21 — 18 — 41 34 — — 49 — \"Rain on Your Parade\" 15 29 — 29 50 38 — 32 25 — \"Well, Well, Well\" 2010 41 33 24 24 26 16 — 60 19 — Endlessly \"—\" denotes a single that did not chart or was not released.\n\nPromotional singles\n\n[edit]\n\nTitle Year Album \"Endlessly\"[57][e] 2010 Endlessly \"Keeping My Baby\"[59][f] 2011 \"My Boy\"[60][61][g]\n\nOther charted songs\n\n[edit]\n\nTitle Year Peak\n\nchart\n\npositions Album UK\n\n[18] \"Oh Boy\" 2008 96 \"Rockferry\" (single) \"Tomorrow\" 192 \"Mercy\" (single) \"Hanging on Too Long\" 193 Rockferry \"Delayed Devotion\" 166 \"Syrup & Honey\" 142 \"I'm Scared\" 172 \"Distant Dreamer\" 187 \"Live and Let Die\" 2009 131 War Child Presents Heroes\n\nOther appearances\n\n[edit]\n\nTitle Year Album \"Something New\"\n\n(with Mint Royale) 2005 See You in the Morning[7] \"Little Words\"\n\n(with Mint Royale) \"Live and Let Die\" 2009 War Child Heroes Vol. 1[63] \"Stay with Me Baby\" The Boat That Rocked[64] \"Desearía\" 2011 Patagonia[65] \"Ar Lan y Môr\" \"Whole Lot of Love\"[66] 2015 Legend[67] \"Are You Sure?\" \"Make the World Go Away\"\n\nMusic videos\n\n[edit]\n\nTitle Year Director \"Rockferry\" 2007 Joseph Bull[68] \"Mercy\" 2008 Daniel Wolfe[69][70] \"Warwick Avenue\" \"Mercy\" (U.S. version) Adria Petty[71] \"Stepping Stone\" Sophie Muller[72][73][74] \"Rain on Your Parade\" \"Well, Well, Well\" 2010 Chris Cottam[75]\n\nLive versions of seven songs from Endlessly recorded at the Café de Paris were also released as music videos.[76] A video was filmed for the prospective single \"My Boy\", but was never released.\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]\n\nNotes\n\n[edit]\n\nSources\n\n[edit]\n\nGeneral\n\nSpecific"
