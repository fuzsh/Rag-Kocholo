        "text": "ANTIOCH, Calif. (KGO) -- A woman is dead and several people are injured following a shooting in Antioch, police said.\n\nThe family of 18-year-old Nadia Tirado confirms she died in the shooting at a birthday party in Antioch Sunday morning. Antioch police say seven people in total were shot.\n\nAPD says they went to a home on the 3300 block of Sunset Lane just before 1 a.m. where they say a 19-year-old man was having a birthday party.\n\nThey say uninvited guests arrived outside and a shooting broke out, causing everyone to flee. When officers arrived onto the scene, they found multiple people shot outside and a large crowd, police said.\n\nOfficers also say some of the shooting victims took themselves to the hospital. The victims' ages range from 18 to 20 and most of the injuries are considered non-life threatening, police said.\n\nMORE: Residents react as SFPD investigation continues into Mission District shooting that injured 9\n\nPolice say no arrests have been made and detectives are interviewing numerous witnesses and residents in the area, and are working to identify any suspects or persons-of-interest.\n\nPolice say they are searching for potentially multiple suspects who left in a car before officers arrived.\n\nThe Tirado family told ABC7 news Nadia was an amazing person who always put a smile on everyone's face. They say she made everyone feel wanted. We reached out to APD for further comment and we are waiting to hear back.\n\nMORE: Family grieves, remembers Antioch Chevron store employee killed during armed robbery\n\nAnyone with information is asked to contact Detective Gragg, rgragg@antiochca.gov at (925) 779-6889, or Detective Duffy, aduffy@antiochca.gov at (925) 779-6884.\n\nYou may also text-a-tip anonymously to 274637 (CRIMES) using the key word ANTIOCH."
