        "text": "Well, the Hokies Haven’t Stumbled on the Recruiting Road\n\nMegan Duffy seems like a breeze of fresh air across the New River Valley public relations persona for Virginia Tech Basketball. She’s definitely made some changes in the public offseason image of the team, having some fun with photo sessions for the staff, and hiring first rate assistants who have followed right along with her on the image re-establishment.\n\nCoach Duffy even participated in the tradition of grilled cheese sammis for exam week.\n\nBut Image and PR presence aren’t the only things that rebuild programs after major changes. It’s critical that the new coaching staff get wins in the recruiting department and Duffy seems to be stepping right in and filling that diverted stream quickly.\n\nDuffy and staff have some big gets for the future. With Lani White, Kathleen Doyle, Kayl Petersen, Leila Wells, and retaining recruit Myah Hazelton.\n\nDuffy’s big wins on the road were also met with three critical big keeps as Rose Micheaux, Karleigh Wenzel, Matilda Ekh, and Carys Baker have chosen to stay with us in Blacksburg. Those four will form a critical core and institutional memory for the new staff and players.\n\nDuffy isn’t Finished, Though\n\nThe big news this weekend was a commitment from Watauga High School Boone, North Carolina junior, Kate Sears. This is a long-term commitment, so we’ll see how her senior year progresses, but it lays a foundation for the 2026 season, and potentially on to 2030.\n\nA big welcome to Hokie Nation for next season to Kate. The future is looking really bright for the new image Hokie Women’s Basketball Team.\n\nIt’s going to be fun covering this bunch for the foreseeable future."
