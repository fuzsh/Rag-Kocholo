Etta James, Ruth Brown, Lou Rawls, Bo Diddley (who called her “dangerous”), The Neville Brothers, to name just a few.\n\nWith long-time collaborator, guitarist, singer/songwriter, husband Chris Carlson, they have travelled and made music across the USA, Canada, Norway, Hong Kong, Japan, and Austria.\n\nTo find out more about Duffy. She was the subject of a 2010 documentary “Who Is Duffy Bishop and Why Is She Not World Famous?”, an exploration of her career and life. https://youtu.be/yqKLAbguCg0\n\nDuffy’s mission statement is clear, “There is always more music to create, in hopes of helping make people happier and more positive about the world “.\n\nDuffy Bishop’s new album, I'm Gonna Do What I Want, was produced by Duffy, guitarist/husband Chris Carlson and engineer, Jim DeVito at Retrophonics Studios in Crescent Beach, FL.\n\n\"Bishop is a revelation, belting dynamic blues ...\n\nwith the blistering guitar of her husband Chris Carlson.\""
