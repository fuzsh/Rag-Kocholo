        "text": "Duffy On World Cafe\n\nWXPN\n\nWorking with The Roots and Albert Hammond Jr., the Welsh neo-soul singer returns with a new record. Hear her perform songs from Endlessly, along with a cut from her debut, Rockferry, on World Cafe.\n\nDuffy On World Cafe\n\n24:12\n\nDuffy: The British Invasion Continues\n\nWXPN\n\nWelsh singer Duffy sings with a roughness and soul that's well suited to her style of Motown-influenced pop. She joins host World Cafe host David Dye with songs from her debut album, Rockferry.\n\nDuffy: The British Invasion Continues\n\nBritish Invasion: Duffy's Brand New Soul\n\nThe young singer, part of a wave of British female pop stars finding success in the U.S., has been compared to Dusty Springfield and sparked rumors that her father is fellow Wales native Tom Jones. She talks about the tiny town where she grew up, and recording her first demos on a karaoke machine.\n\nBritish Invasion: Duffy's Brand New Soul\n\nDuffy Makes the Classic Sound Special Again\n\nWFUV\n\nGrowing up in Wales, neo-soul singer Duffy didn't have the luxury of record stores, or even possess the notion of trendy pop music. As she tells Rita Houston in a session from WFUV, this allowed her to fully enjoy the classic songs she heard on the radio.\n\nHear a performance and interview from WFUV"
