        "text": "NASA Johnson Space Center Oral History Project\n\nEdited Oral History Transcript\n\nKathryn D. Sullivan\n\nInterviewed by Jennifer Ross-Nazzal\n\nColumbus, Ohio – 28 May 2009\n\nRoss-Nazzal: Today is May 28, 2009. This oral history with Kathy Sullivan is being conducted for the Johnson Space Center Oral History Project in Columbus, Ohio. Jennifer Ross-Nazzal is the interviewer. Thanks again for making time for me all day today.\n\nSullivan: Always a pleasure.\n\nRoss-Nazzal: I thought we’d start with a contemporary topic. That is Charlie [Charles F.] Bolden [Jr.], who has been nominated as [President] Barack Obama’s choice for the new NASA administrator. You spoke so highly of him last time, I thought maybe you’d like to talk about his selection.\n\nSullivan: Nothing has changed since the last time we spoke in how highly I regard Charlie Bolden. From the beginning of the speculation and rumblings on the blogosphere about who might be chosen by the new administration, I frankly was hoping that Charlie might a) come under consideration and b) be willing to consider it. It’s not a small consideration to shift from whatever you’re currently doing to take on a service role like NASA administrator or any such presidential appointment.\n\nAs you know, there was lots of to-ing and fro-ing in the blogosphere starting probably around January 20 at 1:30 in the afternoon. I’m delighted. I just think Charlie is such a superb package overall for the job. His personal qualities, his integrity, his character, his leadership capacity and style, his manner of leadership I think are well suited. It’s a tough job. There is both the authoritative clarity of being in charge of the agency and directing things, as well as the realities of working in the congressional environment and with the White House environment. You have so many stakeholders and so many competing viewpoints. It’s not a small thing at all, and I think Charlie’s competencies and approach to leadership suit him to that really well. So I’m hopeful.\n\nI’m pleased the nomination came out when the new Augustine panel was still just forming. I think in the end it serves the agency and the country better to have a designated administrator, if not fully confirmed yet, able to see and be part of and follow that process, given that it will in the end turn into some degree of his charge to carry out. I’m glad for that. I’m delighted. I think it’s all to the good for the country and the agency and wish him well. He knows I’m on his list of able and willing foot soldiers any time he needs me.\n\nRoss-Nazzal: We were happy to hear that. We’re hoping it means good things for JSC and for human spaceflight in particular.\n\nSullivan: Yes. I hope that too, although we all recognize the charge of the administrator is not just human spaceflight. I think we’re in for some interesting times, to say the very least.\n\nRoss-Nazzal: Especially given the economic situation that the nation is in at this point.\n\nSullivan: Current economics will not make any of this any easier. That is for sure, yes.\n\nRoss-Nazzal: You spent so much time working up all those plans for servicing missions. What are your thoughts on STS-125, the final Hubble servicing mission, as it comes to a close?\n\nSullivan: I adored watching the final servicing mission for lots of reasons. I guess I didn’t feel quite the same twinge of sadness that some folks seem to feel. Hubble has had its designated service life and then some, and even the full mission run that it was set up to have, if you start the counting after the first servicing mission restored the optical performance.\n\nI understand the nostalgia of seeing this spacecraft end, but I’m also excited by the ones that are coming in its wake. There were some obviously very fun bookends to me, being on the first Hubble flight and now watching the final one. Everything that’s happened and all the great scientific and flight operations accomplishments in between just lent a nice glow to the experience of watching it.\n\nThere’s a fun little personal story embedded in this last flight, part of which had escaped my memory for quite some time and was brought back to mind through Christmas card correspondence earlier in the year. I’ll start at the end of the story and then back up to it. A couple of years ago, I designed, with a jeweler here in town, a variant of the astronaut pin that was a little bit larger and suggested Earth orbit. This was the kind of piece of jewelry I could imagine wearing with great delight on business suits and even formal wear. I copyrighted the design so that no one would just glibly use it, and let the folks down in the Astronaut Office know that we’d let any of the full-time CB gals [female astronauts] that wanted one have it just for cost of reproduction. Contact the jeweler or let me know.\n\nSomething around a year went by, and I finally heard back from the jeweler that they’d been contacted by an astronaut who wanted the pin. I asked who it was. He said, “Oh, it’s [K.] Megan McArthur, do you know her?”\n\nI told him Megan came well after me and I didn’t really know her. Then I hopped online, dropped her an email, saying, “Delighted you’ve found the pin, know you’ll enjoy it, and let me know if I can help in any way with the interfaces.”\n\nShe quickly came back asking if my pin had ever been flown. Of course it hadn’t. I told her that. She asked if I would like it to go up with her. She’d be pleased to take it on STS-125. Those personal item and memento slots are terribly limited, as you well know. This is Megan’s first flight, and certainly on my first flight, I was mindful of a lot of people. So I was delighted, but frankly a bit amazed that she would offer such a generous thing. We never worked together, we didn’t really overlap, so I’m thinking this is an awfully nice thing to do, out of the blue. I figured she was offering as a nice courtesy to the gal who came up with the pin; fair enough. “Yes, please,” I said, and sent it down to her.\n\nThat was something around early ’08, I think. Comes Christmas time, and I get a card from a friend in Virginia who used to work with the Secret Service as a special agent and aquatics guy. He collaborates with some other mutual friends on a student design engineering competition called the International Human-Powered Submarine Races. In his card to me, Jim remarks that he’s going to go down and see the STS-125 launch. Megan McArthur has invited him. “You remember her,” he says, “that young student that you talked with on the beach at the sub races back in 1993? The one who had wanted to be an astronaut forever, who I asked you to spend some extra time with? Boy, did you make a difference! Isn’t it fun to see where this has all come out?”\n\nI’ve done hundreds of such appearances, with brief counseling, and inspiration sessions on the side. I’m always happy to do them, but they do quite honestly become a bit of a blur. So I remembered being at those sub races, but any particulars about one team or one young gal had long since vanished in the blur of memory.\n\nI laughed out loud. Now it all made sense. Now there were at least two reasons that Megan might have been moved to offer to take something of mine along on her first flight. I quickly hopped on email again and sent off just a fun, “Hey, you’ll never guess what I just realized,” and recapped in two lines that Jim had pointed this out and closed with something like, “a) now you’ve done enough of these, I’m sure you can appreciate how it could have faded into memory and been lost from my recollection, and b) I sure hope I said something useful and intelligent on the beach that day.”\n\nHer email came back like instantly. “Are you kidding? I quote you all the time,” and filling in a little more of that. That was terribly fun to realize that that thread ran the way it did, and that I had played a small role. Megan was already well on the track in terms of motivation and technical skills to end up an astronaut, and I was fortunate to get to meet her at one of those moments where a bit of inspiration or a bit of confirmation could add to the equation. The rest speaks for itself, including the fabulous performance of the crew overall on the flight. So that was a very fun bookend that also ran through my mind as I watched this all go by.\n\nI thought back to the early days, or least my early days, when I joined Bruce McCandless [II], who’d had his hand in this for a fair bit before me, and Ron Sheffield and others. We kept scratching our head and sharpening our pencils about what really is the full set of items on Hubble that one ought to want to be able to service if this thing really gets up there and starts performing. When I joined the effort and we were just eighteen or twenty months from flight, there was a limit to what you could do. In the aftermath of the Challenger accident, that time window expanded. Without even much conscious discussion among Bruce and Ron and I and others, we just kept using that time to refine and deepen the repair capability that could support Hubble for a long run.\n\nIn that phase of things, we did actually think ahead and do some fair amount of preparation for the eventuality of needing to fix a Power Control Unit, which of course happened on Servicing Mission 3 [STS-109]. The level of breaking open boxes and doing integrated circuit card replacement on this last flight was another horizon beyond where we got to. So another other thing I found fun and really gratifying about [STS]-125, was that it represented both another really great confirmation of the strong foundation that all our early work had set and a new horizon to boot. We’d built a team that was very thoughtful and intentional about capturing and passing down lessons. We started that in the early predeployment phases. That’s clearly been continued by Ron Sheffield and others, because the conveyed wisdom, the carried-down knowledge, the propagation of lessons learned and even tacit knowledge, has clearly been done well enough and strongly enough to support high performance by each of the subsequent servicing crews. That’s very gratifying to see. We got all this started on a really sound footing, and folks have come in and kept that going.\n\nOn the other hand, as a counterpoint, it was equally gratifying to see that the team was still up to a pushing-the-frontier challenge, both from the management and the technical side. It’s a real testament to the discipline, the competency, and just the mindset and the confidence of lessons really learned and ingrained to be able to continue to move the bar on what is now feasible without prior planning, without preflight on-the-ground preparation; what can you step in and say, “I need to change my mind. I now need to be able to do this. So, we can do this, and here’s how.” That’s a simple thing to say, but that’s actually a really important capacity philosophically, culturally, and technically in an organization.\n\nI do feel a little bit of bittersweet regret that the hiatus is coming up. The program design that’s coming forward at us seem to me to pose a lot of likelihood that this very hard-won competency and capacity at spacewalks and complex servicing will be lost. I worry about that frittering away in the however many years that may lie ahead that are consumed with PDRs [Preliminary Design Reviews], CDRs [Conceptual Design Reviews], and PowerPoint meetings. Everything but bending metal, everything but actually getting out and doing the work.\n\nMy history with the program starts before STS-1, goes through the hand-wringing of the very first spacewalks and the nervousness about suits. Even in [STS]-41G when we did our spacewalk, the program was still really awfully nervous about spacewalks being very risky. You didn’t have the sense that spacewalking was really a tool and capability the program comfortably used—not cavalierly—but comfortably used in a comparatively routine task. It’s a tool you use. It’s not a difficult scary thing you do only when you have to. The Station assembly approach pushed on that boundary. The early satellite servicing missions, we did Solar Max and the PALAPA/WESTAR retrieve. We then had a hiatus before the INTELSAT retrieve. I thought we lost some lessons within collective memory just between those clusters of servicing missions. I thought there were some glitches in the planning and preparations just by the time INTELSAT came around that to me represented a failure on our collective part to really carry all those lessons forward and keep them in active use and convey them to each other so we were progressively building.\n\nThe Hubble experience, I think it fed into and supported a lot of aspects of how Station preparations and EVA [Extravehicular Activity] cadre training was done. All of that worked together and has really created a very robust capacity now. I just worry about that atrophying. If we’re serious about doing extended zero-G work or planetary surface work, that’s not a capacity I think we can afford to let atrophy, or to have it once again fade back to being infrequently used and we’re a bit nervous about it. I think that has to be an integral part of the toolkit that we know we’re competent at and we’re smart but comfortable about using.\n\nRoss-Nazzal: How do you think you can keep that up without flying the Shuttle?\n\nSullivan: I don’t know. I’m not arguing to do frivolous spacewalks for training purposes, necessarily, but I just worry about bridging Station assembly. Physical Station assembly is almost complete. That’ll go back to indoor sports and science, as it should. That’s the right thing to do. The need for lots of EVAs in that domain is going to go away. Shuttle and EVA capacity will go down. We’re going to go to a more encapsulated system if, presumably, the current architecture stays in place. The next real need for extensive suited operating experience may well not come until you’re back on the surface of a planet, unless in the process of getting there you decide that you do need to use orbital flights on whatever platform as your training and preparation or for engineering tests. There are ways to do it. I think it has to start with key program officials higher up and down at the operating level being very mindful of the challenge, the concern, and acting intentionally to do what they can to avert it.\n\nRoss-Nazzal: I thought we would turn to STS-31. One of the things that we didn’t talk about last time was the press interest in this mission. Do you want to talk about that some?\n\nSullivan: Well, we can. My recollection of the press interest surrounding STS-31 is not a whole lot different than around either of the other two flights. [STS]-41G had a certain amount of press interest because it was still early days and a bit rare. This idea of women flying in space was still a little bit new. Two on one flight was certainly wildly new. Then we had a Canadian and another visiting scientist. There was kerfuffle around those aspects. The astronomy community’s and the scientific community’s interest in Hubble and what it would do post-deployment, I felt removed from. I didn’t feel overwhelmed by that. I didn’t really register the press interest as affecting me in any meaningfully different way.\n\nWe got down to thirty-one seconds with an APU [Auxiliary Power Unit] problem on the first launch attempt and scrubbed at thirty-one seconds. It pretty quickly became clear that we weren’t going to turn around within the time span of our quarantine window so we got sprung loose from quarantine so we could go to the beach and at least visit some of the family and friends who had come all that way to see us go. The thing that was different to me about that flight was that it was the only one of my own flights where I got a sense of the energy and activity level on the beach around family and friends. Of course a huge swarm of Hubble relatives and extended family had gathered themselves, or been gathered by NASA. I don’t honestly know which, but they were staying at the same hotel complex that my friends and family were at. I remember that very vividly. There was this huge whole gaggle and party over there. “Those are the Hubbles!” There’s this mass of excited and eager people. Slightly disappointed that they hadn’t seen the fireworks, but glad to be there for this great exciting evolution.\n\nIt’s interesting that you raise that point, because that’s not really on my radar screen at all.\n\nRoss-Nazzal: I was curious. I think Loren [J.] Shriver talked a little bit about the press interest, not much. Loren doesn’t say a lot, but I was curious what your thoughts were.\n\nSullivan: My perception was that it was not notably different, from the point of view of my role on the crew. Loren may have been fending off. I think that was also Loren’s first command. So first command where you’re triaging and making all the go/no-go decisions, how much exposure, how much of this stuff will I put on my crew, maybe that played a role in his sense of it. Certainly I would think there was probably more interest in Hubble than some generic cargo at that time, but I didn’t have to deal with those things. We had a press event on the schedule, so we’d go to the press event. Interview rounds on the schedule, we go do the interview rounds. Back in the simulator.\n\nRoss-Nazzal: You had talked a great deal about your work in California. Did you want to talk some about your work with the European folks? In particular, going over to England and working with solar arrays?\n\nSullivan: That was pretty significant and was one of the memorable parts of the preparations. The original HST solar arrays, the curtain rod ones, were designed by British Aerospace. The arrays plus contributions to some of the science instruments constituted the European share, which in turn earned them a share of the observing time. When we came to deployment, we were going to have mission control in Houston, the Hubble Ops Center at Goddard [Space Flight Center, Greenbelt, Maryland], the Telescope Ops Center at Johns Hopkins [University, Baltimore, Maryland], and the various European Space Agency elements, some on-site at US Centers and some still back at home. A larger lash-up in that sense than I had seen on my first flight.\n\nThe solar arrays of course consisted of two solar arrays with three different mechanical functions. Unlatch them, pivot them down, and then unfurl them. All three of these had manual backups through EVA tools. I guess it would have been ’89 when the solar array flight hardware was finished and undergoing test at British Aerospace Bristol.\n\nOur approach to all these tools was, in every case, whenever humanly possible, take the actual flight tool to the actual flight hardware. This let us verify that it fit on every fitting, that all that we expected was there. We could verify that the tool extension clears the things that we were aware of it needing to clear; get a visual confirmation that the way underwater mockups are built jives with what we’ve seen here in the flight hardware, gather any annotation that we need to take back to the training facilities to update the training. Then there’s the tactile experience of, if you actually end up out here cranking the solar array out, what does the running torque actually feel like? What are the visual observations you should be watching for? You’ve got the experts there that built it. They can give you commentary and cue you to the behaviors they’ve learned from running it through earlier tests.\n\nThat flight hardware experience is really valuable to prepare you to recognize what’s expected, what’s not expected, and make sure that the simulators have not been lying to you in a bad way. My operating philosophy was that every simulator is lying to me. They can’t be perfected. That’s a silly standard to try to set. They’re inevitably lying to me. The challenge is to get very sharp and aware of where are they lying to you, and how significant is the miscue or the lie, and mentally correct for that.\n\nBruce and I got things set up, grabbed the tools, and rendezvoused at the facility over in Bristol. It was a really fascinating combination of technical and cultural experience. We traveled independently because of preceding commitments. I went from Washington all-day meetings onto a plane. I landed at [London] Heathrow [Airport, England] around 7:00 a.m., and they had sent a car to drive me to Bristol, because I knew I was going to be so exhausted I wouldn’t dare drive. We were going to go right into a test, and I needed to be fresh.\n\nI slept most of the way to Bristol and was taken to a management briefing room when I arrived. It all seemed very formal. I was ready to just throw on my flight suit and get out on the test floor and get at this. Instead we found ourselves in these rather more formal “welcome the flight crew” events, which I hadn’t expected. Eventually we went onto the shop floor and did an initial walkthrough overview. They had the solar array suspended in a rig. It’s not meant to move itself in a gravity field, so you had to orient it in the G field and suspend it so that the pull-down curtain part, the extension of the arrays out from the central spool, was essentially unconstrained by gravity. They had it rigged so that curtain rod would go sideways in each direction. I think that was the way it was set up.\n\nWe got an overview brief of all that. Again we’re rubbing our hands, about ready to dig in and get the tools out and go, and they said, “Lunchtime!”\n\nWe looked at each other like, “Lunch? Let’s do the test!” but they hauled us off to lunch. It was a seated lunch in, again, what looked like the management dining room, with senior company officials and linen tablecloths. To our complete astonishment, several folks were having a pint of ale or a glass of wine. I know this is more common in the European culture, but this is the middle of the workday. I remember they offered Bruce and me something to drink, and we just looked at each other in amazement—we didn’t say anything out loud, but you could tell, just by eyeball contact, that we each were thinking, “Who in their right mind would think I would have even a sip of alcohol when I’m about to go out and manipulate flight hardware? You’re kidding, right? Not in a million years.” So there were just some of those interesting “and now for something entirely different” moments.\n\nEvery other piece of Hubble we had ever dealt with was in a Class 5 Clean Room facility. Here are the solar arrays in a rather different clean room. It was a clean room, but a couple of guys didn’t have anything on their hair. Nobody was bunnied up like you’d see in a Class 5 facility, with gloves taped on and booties. It was all just rather less rigorous than certainly what I had seen of Class 5. I thought, “Well, this is interesting. We’re going to prepare this all up here and button it up, and then ship it over and bolt it onto the telescope in a Class 5 clean facility. I wonder what how that’s going to work out.”\n\nThere were those bits of comic threads that may have felt larger at the time because I was perhaps a little bit sleep-deprived, but the test went fine. It was very informative to get that feel of things and watch things. Then, of course, not too many months later one of the arrays balked during the original deployment. Bruce and I bolted down to the airlock, and Charlie came with us to button us up and get us ready to go out the door. Given the geometry of the telescope out in the payload bay at that time and the array that had stuck, it would in fact have come to me to crank it out, if the software command hadn’t worked.\n\nI was, at that point, extra grateful for that trip to Britain, the experience that I had there. That was a very busy time. We went over, did the test, and right after the test headed back to Heathrow and came home. I remember hearing from KT [Kathryn C. Thornton] and some of the SM1 [Servicing Mission 1] crews about going over to get the training at Bristol, getting the whole Stonehenge tour, and all sorts of great things. Maybe that’s what you get after you’ve successfully fixed their solar array. We didn’t get that. We just went over there, worked, and came home.\n\nRoss-Nazzal: The documentary that recently aired on Discovery, When We Left the Earth, made such a big deal out of your mission, about how there was a possibility that you might have used too much propellant going up to put the Hubble into its altitude.\n\nSullivan: The deployment altitude for Hubble was quite high for a Space Shuttle. I’m pretty sure it’s the highest altitude civilian flight. Every time I say that, KT squints at me as if she went higher than that at some other point in time. Her first flight was a Defense Department flight, though, so if she did, she can’t say anything. We were pretty high, 340 nautical miles. The standard design orbit is 160, so we’re over twice as high. The altitude was driven by the pointing stability requirements of the telescope. It’s a big vehicle with a lot of cross-section. You need to get it into a very low-density region, very high. Its control systems, they’re all they need to be for the task they’re designed for, but they’re wimpy in a sense. Magnetic torquers and control moment gyros are not high impulse things. So you want to get it pretty high so that the pointing systems can keep it very still for long observations.\n\nThe year 1990 was at or close to a solar maximum year. So the envelope of the atmosphere is bigger, physically larger, in a year like that. There was a long time watching the solar activity and doing all the calculations to determine when we will actually be at a solar max. Because if we’re on the down side—it’s a fifteen-year life—if we’re on the coming down side of a solar max cycle, then you could go a little lower, because the atmosphere would be deflating. This would give you more performance margin for the deployment flight. You’d have more margin for every servicing flight. As the flight slipped, moved off the original 1985-86 date into the 1990ish timeframe and was being juggled around the manifest, it was a very extended period of time of tracking all of that and running calculations around various target launch dates.\n\nThe end of all of that extensive work, with a March 1990 launch near solar max, was a target deploy altitude of 340 nautical miles. When you put all those numbers together and run it against Orbiter performance and consumables, it turned that when you arrive on orbit about 50 percent of your onboard propellant will already have been consumed. So you’re less than an hour into day one of a five-plus-day flight. You’ve got to release the telescope and back away, you’ve got to station-keep nearby in case there are any infant mortality failures. If one of those happens, you’re going to have to rendezvous and capture again, service it, release, and back away again, then deorbit. You need margin for all of that, and half your propellant is already gone.\n\nThat’s a lot lower initial level of propellant day one than you typically see on a Shuttle flight. That had everybody’s attention. The artistic license the film guys took in When We Left the Earth was implying that in real time on the day we launched we unexpectedly found ourselves with such low fuel remaining. That’s invention; it just juices up the story. But there is consequence, obviously, to working on those fuel margins.\n\nOne of them that we put a lot of energy into was how to respond to propellant leak alarms. If you’ve got fatter fuel margins and you get a leak alert, a first prudent step is to find indications that confirm it’s not a false alarm. If it’s not a false alarm, then act on it. For STS-31, just the risk that it might genuinely be a leak had to trigger action, because the risk that it could deplete fuel needed for deorbit was too high. So for any indication of a leak, we needed to launch parallel paths of action. We had to start out on the assumption that it is going to turn out to be a leak, and that we’re going to button the heck up really fast. I’d rather burn the propellant lowering my orbit than spew it out the side, so I want to quickly get ready to do a deorbit burn. It may be a complete deorbit burn, it may be a lower the altitude burn, but I need right away to be ready to do the burn and change the orbit. I might be going home right away, so I’d be starting to button up the cockpit and the cabin. Someone had better be checking is it really a leak, and what part of the tank system is leaking, so how much do we have to burn off? All of that has to get acted on in parallel.\n\nWe got awful darn good at that. For the telescope guys, the consequence was a little different. I actually tell this tale sometimes in talking about leadership, communication, and training, and what it sometimes takes to get people to see and move past mental models that they’ve created. If you’re the telescope guy, you’ve been waiting more than a decade for this, and your view of the world is that the Shuttle crew is going to lift me up, hold me above their heads while I properly, thoroughly, and carefully unfold everything and check that everything is working. Then we’re going to get everything perfectly positioned with the Sun angle and communications and all of that, and then we’re all going to say, “Is everybody ready?” When everyone’s really ready, then they’re going to let me gracefully go and back away, and it’ll be like a nice smooth handover of a baton at a track meet. That is exactly what we intended to do, and at the end of the day exactly what we delivered.\n\nHowever, if anywhere in that little dance a leak alarm goes off, all bets are off. We spent a lot of effort trying to explain to them that, if that happens all of the niceties are OBE—done, gone, overtaken by events. “We are punching you off the arm ASAP. Have a nice time; we’re getting out of there.” This was just incomprehensible.\n\n“No, no, no, no, you can’t, we need this and this.” They’d start back through the rehearsal of all the deployment constraints. Just in conversation, you’d go back and forth.\n\n“Yes, we understand the deployment constraints. We intend to do that, but if this circumstance arises, forget it.”\n\n“No, no, you don’t understand. You have to—.” It would just be this endless circular argument.\n\nFinally, in consultation with the flight director and sim [simulation] supervisors and others, we scripted a full team international integrated simulation that was deploy day with a leak scenario. It’s very unlikely to happen, but if it does happen we have to be sure the team is as ready as possible and not have it risk the Hubble mission. So the telescope is up on the arm, and they’re working through pre-deploy stuff on the ground. Well, not many minutes into that simulation, just when everybody’s getting in the groove, here comes the propellant leak. They set it up to be a real one, not a false alarm, so we went into “button up and get down” mode. I think we had a deorbit burn done within twenty, twenty-five minutes. So something in the space of about an hour, the flight crew’s role in this eighteen-hour integrated sim was done. We’re gone. We’re down. We’re home. The rest was mission control Houston, the Telescope Ops Center, and Europe figuring out, “Oh my goodness, now what?” Well, they did figure it out. They worked themselves through that. They solved the problems. They regrouped.\n\nThat exercise obviously forced them to think and come up with new insights, and dig deeper into what do we understand and how can we help each other, all those kinds of things that you would imagine. That process revealed some greater smarts, some better approaches to normal ops for the telescope. So the program got two good things out of it. It got a telescope flight operations control team that had learned some important lessons that would let the telescope mission go forward and succeed even if we had to throw it overboard and get out of Dodge, and they even learned some improvements to the normal course of business. They deployed with better operating skills than they would have had otherwise, and they were ready to cover that contingency if it happened, but it was pretty funny at the time.\n\nIt has struck me as I’ve thought about in years since. We had, happily, a simulation-rich environment. We could create a circumstance that forced people to actually sit at their consoles and live with a scenario they couldn’t bring themselves to contemplate, and at a level of detail that would really change their practice. You could set up that constraint, and people engaged those simulations very constructively in good faith. You rarely see someone just gaming or BSing a simulation in that environment. The learning value is likely to be high when people engage that kind of exercise so genuinely. It was a humorous event at the time—still humorous, for that matter—but also a truly illuminating experience. “Oh no, you can’t do that!” “Oh, yeah? Just watch us. I’d rather be safe with you yelling at me about wrecking your telescope than die in orbit.”\n\nRoss-Nazzal: You did mention, and this is something that Loren had mentioned as well, that you watched the Hubble for a few days. You mentioned there might be a possibility of going back and servicing it if there were some challenges.\n\nSullivan: We didn’t station-keep very nearby. The Shuttle is a comparatively dirty vehicle, plus you want to be safe enough away that there’s zero collision likelihood. It would have to be intentional to go back to the telescope. The elements that needed to work, that you wanted to be concerned about, were that both high gain antennas deployed successfully and were operating satisfactorily. That the solar arrays deployed successfully and were operating satisfactorily.\n\nThe final moving piece of this was the aperture door, the big barn door on the front of the telescope. That was closed. It had been kept closed on the ground 99.99 percent of the time, and it was closed in the payload bay. Before you opened this, you wanted to let the Shuttle and all of its propellant effluents get away. You wanted to let whatever little tenuous cloud of this that surrounded the telescope dissipate. You also wanted to let some initial off-gassing of the telescope itself happen before you opened the aperture door, to prevent depositing any contamination on the mirror, or as little as possible contamination on the mirror. So the aperture door was really the key driver. It was the one mechanical function that, under normal operating procedure, would not be known and verified before we released the telescope. You get up there, and everything is fine. Then the Shuttle comes home, and then you discover after landing that the latch on the aperture door won’t release. It’s latched shut, or the hinge motor won’t drive. Those were the two final critical functions. If it won’t unlatch or it won’t hinge up, then no light gets in the telescope and you may as well not have done this.\n\nSo the door would have been the main thing that could have brought us back.\n\nRoss-Nazzal: What did you do between deployment and landing? Were you in charge of any experiments?\n\nSullivan: We did not have a lot of other experiments aboard, just because the combination of upmass and altitude that we needed to reach really pressed the performance. Hubble itself effectively totally filled the payload bay. It’s not like you had a lot of room. We had room for a cargo bay IMAX camera and a little gas can on the aft port sill, but that was about it. I don’t think we had anything in the cabin other than DSOs [Detailed Secondary Objectives]. I’d have to go look at my payload log. I don’t even remember something any other of payload class. Smaller experimental objectives of the DSO class is all that I remember, mainly with us as test subjects. Bruce and I were test subjects on the intraocular pressure experiment, tracking that through time. We were higher than many crews, so we had some additional more sensitive radiation dosimetry type measurements to check the shielding. Just take more measurements inside the Shuttle cabin with that radiation exposure, that sort of thing.\n\nWe had a Linhof camera. Bruce came up with this idea. It was an interesting one. Since we were going to be in a pretty stable orbit, mowing the lawn for those days in a relatively stable consistent attitude and because we didn’t have pointing constraints, we took the Linhof camera, mounted it in a bracket in W1, W2 so it could look pretty well straight down. We did swaths for the Earth observations guys. Contiguous swaths across all the major continental areas, because any image frame would cover a larger area at twice the normal Shuttle height. We figured we should take advantage of that and help fill in some of the gaps that they get in the point-and-shoot observations that are more typical of what operating crews can do. That was kind of it.\n\nRoss-Nazzal: You mentioned that you were the IMAX operator, I think, last time, but that you weren’t able to operate it because you were in the airlock.\n\nSullivan: Neither Bruce nor I was the primary IMAX camera operator for just that reason. If we’d been out doing spacewalks, you would have wanted to record the spacewalks. I’d operated IMAX on my first flight, not the cargo bay-mounted, but I’d been fully trained on the camera, even the film changing and stuff that wasn’t relevant for 31. I think I trained. I think Bruce had trained on it before. We all got some training on it. That really would have been Charlie and Loren commanding it on and off. That’s all you can do. You set the f-stop and command it on and off through a little hand controller. That would have been the prime thing to do for any of the key deployment and other scenes.\n\nThe one time I really stepped into the fray was after deployment. They wanted a specific shot. They were aiming our footage towards two films. One they had already envisioned, a film about Hubble, that became Destiny in Space so they needed that footage. Plus they were trying to fill in some final gaps in the storyboard for Blue Planet. With our high altitude and cargo bay-mounted camera, we could get some great overview shots for them. That was our main assignment for Blue Planet, a couple of key regional framing shots, a great limb of the Earth; one is the great Caribbean panorama. That’s a 31 shot. The particular gap they had in the storyboard for Blue Planet was that they didn’t have a good shot of any of the great mountain ranges. There’s several you could have, but the preference they expressed was to have the Himalayas. We were the last guys that were going to film for that. It would have been Himalayas first or Andes second, probably just because of the prominence of the mountain ranges and the snowcaps.\n\nThey had found one pass that was the only time our orbital geometry gave a shot at the Himalayas. We were at 28.5 degrees. The Himalayas were going to be north of us. We had the rollover point of the orbit looking right up at the Himalayas. The problem was it was smack dab in the middle of our sleep period. They’re not allowed to task anybody in the sleep period. The editor, Toni Myers, who I’d worked with on the first flight and had up a social rapport with, took advantage. Not undue advantage, but used that to her benefit. She sidled up to me during the training sessions, sketched out this problem, and said, “I don’t know what to do about this. Is there anything I can do about this?”\n\nI said, “You have just done the only thing you can do about it. Understand?” “Got it.” We took the map out. We looked a little bit. “Okay, got it. This is all you can do about it. I’ll do what I can. That’s the only commitment I can make. You’re not allowed to hold any of us hostage or beat on our heads if it doesn’t work. Don’t say a word to anybody. You didn’t task us. We can do what we want voluntarily in our sleep period. I’m willing to give this a go, but you don’t get to beat up on us if something doesn’t work out.” Fine. That was all good. She appreciated that. The problem was she needed to know if we got that shot. That was going to be like the third night. We had maybe two more days in orbit. If we got that shot, then she would go one direction with the rest of her film usage. If we didn’t get it, she would take a different pathway. It would matter pretty quickly. Do I have this shot or not? She said, “Well, since I’m not allowed to have asked, how are we going to do this bit? How am I going to know?”\n\nI said, “Tell you what. Flight day four, when you come on shift, if you hear me say or if Payload says, ‘There was a great pass over the Himalayas last night,’ that will mean I got your shot.” We left it at that. I woke myself up during the sleep period. I was sleeping on the flight deck. It was very interesting. I went mentally dyslexic a bit about the viewing angle. We’re inverted and the camera is pointing up out of the payload bay and the horizon is here. [Demonstrates] Now I’m trying to envision more carefully how much of the snowcap and how much of the darker background will be in the frame. “What f-stop do I need to set this at? Boy, I hope I set this at the right f-stop. Oh, well. I think it’s f/11.” Set it up and shot it. It was pretty forgiving broad latitude film. It all worked out fine, but it was one of those is it this way or is it this way dyslexic things. The camera is pointing this way and the Orbiter is pointing—oh my goodness, “Shoot the scene! Shoot the scene!”\n\nRoss-Nazzal: It ended up being in the film?\n\nSullivan: It ended up in the film. I always have fun when I watch that. I like the film in general. There’s this wonderful lead-in narration about, “And the great Himalayas.” This whole little story of Toni skulking around trying to figure out how to get the shot and our code phrases back and forth through mission control all comes to mind every time I see that.\n\nRoss-Nazzal: I’ll have to check it out. I was thinking, in comparison to your first flight, this flight had fewer crew members. There were only five. You had seven on your first. Was there any major difference that you noticed other than there was more room?\n\nSullivan: A whole lot more room. Meals and everything went by more quickly. It was easier to get that organized. It was not a big deal or a huge inconvenience to have seven. That all worked fine. It was interesting to have a bit more room. We ended up with about the same amount of clutter. You unstow so much gear for any such flight, and we had a full EVA set up in both cases so the general operating environment wasn’t notably different. We did not have an in-cabin IMAX camera. That and all the film canisters and changing accessories was like having at least a half an extra crew member on the seven-person flight. Not having some equipment of that scope around routinely deployed was about as noticeable as not having the seven people around.\n\nNot really a big deal. I think all of the crews that I was on interacted well enough, communicated well enough, built such strong shared awareness of the whole flight plan and the interacting parts of it that the orchestration, whether through meals or through the head in the morning—it flowed. It worked smoothly and just went without a hiccup, whether it was five or seven. On my three flights, it was seven folks, one single shift, five folks single shift, and then seven folks split shift. I noticed the seven folks split shift change more, because it was different to have so few people on the flight deck through an entire shift. It was different to have two such different things going on. You’re eating, doing your notes, or marking up your flight plan, while other guys are working. So two different realms of experience, and then combine them in stories rather than everybody largely in the same flow of experience, that was interesting. “What are you guys doing down on the middeck? Never mind, never mind.” Whole separate things could be happening on your spacecraft, which had sort of not really happened in the same way before.\n\nRoss-Nazzal: I just have to ask. I know that you’re probably going to say no, but for this mission you’re the only woman on flight. Any differences?\n\nSullivan: No. I was the only woman on my third flight as well, and it was really a complete no big deal either way on both flights. Again, I think all the individuals on all those crews, to first order, we were of the same general mindset and comfort level with respect to issues of privacy. People have to change clothes. People are in the head. It was just kind of a no big deal. Nobody felt a big compulsion to say, “Go into the airlock if you’re going to change your undies.” Those were just nonissues. On one of the flights I remember—I guess it might have been [STS]-45, where it was just a little more crowded, and again one group would be working while one was changing or doing presleep or postsleep preps. It was completely just an aside of no real consequence. You’d hear someone say, “I’m going to change my drawers now” or “I’m going to change my shirt now.” It was as if that announcement created a sufficient bubble of privacy and was just enough of an alert to “I’m taking a private moment.” No one did anything very overt. It’s not like everyone fled the middeck, but it was just that easygoing, that mutually respectful, that matter-of-fact, and that much of a nonissue.\n\nRoss-Nazzal: I just had to ask. We have so many people that have so many questions for us.\n\nSullivan: Well, no claim there that the way it worked out on my crews is everybody’s way. The astronaut corps, especially as it becomes more heterogeneous and international, it’s not all uniform. Someone might feel more particular about privacy, so maybe they do use the potty screen or the airlock as a bit of a changing room. Fine. That works pretty simple. It’s not a big deal. Pretty well do what you needed to do. Again, maybe some crews tease more or jostle each other more and poke at that. The crews I was on, if you announced, “I’m going to change,” or if you felt you needed to go into the airlock, there was nobody on any of my crews that would have played gotcha games or joked with you that way. Couldn’t have been that consciously programmed, but it was a pretty copacetic group from that point of view.\n\nI told you the story of when Dave [David C.] Leestma and I were first doing our suit-up training in 41G. Did I tell you that story in the trainer?\n\nRoss-Nazzal: I don’t remember that one.\n\nSullivan: It’s this exercise during EVA training, where they stowed the one-G trainer fully. The middeck is fully accurate with respect to all your locker labels and then all the EVA stowage. Everything of your EVA stowage is there as it’s going to be in flight. EV1, EV2, and the IV [Intravehicular Activity] guy go out, and you start with the day before preps. You time-compress everything, but you go from initial unbuttoning of the airlock to staging the equipment the day before. You walk through the cabin depress procedures. You do every single thing of the EVA timeline from the very first preparation step to the final restowing of the gear to come home. You time-compress it all.\n\nIn the middle there, you reach the point where the checklist says, “Don LCVGs [Liquid Cooling Ventilation Garment].” Dave and I are both standing there in slacks and shirts. It’s Dave, me, Jon [A.] McBride, and three or four EVA trainers, all of whom are male.\n\nRoss-Nazzal: I don’t remember this story. It’s not ringing any bells.\n\nSullivan: I remember we pulled the LCVGs out of the locker. I recall Dave standing on my left. I’m standing here. We’re just facing the lockers. There just suddenly is this notable pause and notable silence. I have this fleeting sense that everyone has just realized that we’re about to go boldly where no man has gone before—there’s a woman in this mix. You have this sense that every trainer there is going, “Okay, so I always knew how this worked when it was just guys in the locker room and they peel down to their skivvies and on we go. What happens now that she’s here?” Blank. No idea. So I looked over at Dave and said, “Dave, let me tell you my philosophy about modesty in circumstances like this.” He shifts a bit and says, “Okay.” I said, “I have none.” He said, “Fine.” We start peeling off clothes. The trainers dove out of the mockup head first. We got in the LCVGs and said, “You can come back in now.” That was just how we seemed to do things on our crews. “Good. Right. Never mind. Let’s go!”\n\nRoss-Nazzal: Probably worked out better.\n\nSullivan: Yes.\n\nRoss-Nazzal: This mission was using a new system of brakes. There seemed to be an almost longer landing pattern. Any recollections in terms of landing?\n\nSullivan: No, nothing stands out. Other than you remind me of the other bookend that I chuckled about with STS-125, because STS-31 launched from Florida of course, and had a weather wave-off and landed in California. I don’t think we got an extension day. I think it was just a couple of revs’ wave-off, and we landed out there. So I thought it was intriguing that the very first Shuttle flight and the very final Shuttle flight to Hubble both waved off for weather and then ended up in California.\n\nRoss-Nazzal: Any major differences you noticed?\n\nSullivan: My first and third flights landed in Florida, the middle one in California. Not a huge difference. The mini-moment of thanks and press at the landing site before you get on the airplane to go home stands out more on the Edwards [Air Force Base, California] landing than the final flight. I really don’t recall a post-landing, pre-Houston media moment on 41G. I recall runway to crew quarters to airplanes and home, and all the media was in Houston. So the second flight’s landing site events stand out more, because it’s unusual to get to Edwards. Edwards, of course, is manned up to deal with this, but it’s a pretty big deal for a Shuttle to actually end up there. There was a little mini-moment on a bit of a platform of saying some thanks.\n\nIn the STS-31 countdown, we had a problem with—I think it was the inboard fill-and-drain valve on the ET [External Tank] that was showing that it had not closed. This cropped up around the nine-minute hold. GLS [Ground Launch Sequencer] software sees that and sets a flag, so the countdown clock stops. This was on the second launch attempt; an APU malfunction scrubbed the first STS-31 launch attempt ten days prior. We sat there listening to the loops of the Launch Control Center [LCC] as the propellant and main engine guys are sorting through the different parameters that they can see in that crisp cadence. It was a fabulous thing to listen to. It was just absolutely amazing. Absolutely crisp, absolutely together. NTD [NASA Test Director] is talking to the guy, “What have you got? Where are we?”\n\nYou’d hear the launch controller thinking out loud, “I see X, but I see Y also. I see A, but, I see B. Therefore I conclude it’s a false indication, and the valve is fully closed.” There’s another explicit question from NTD. “Is that your firm conclusion? Are you prepared to override?” “I’m prepared to override.” Then you hear the controller go through his steps. “I’m issuing the GLS override, MARK.” NTD just (claps) says without even missing a beat, “This is NTD. Pick up the count on my mark. Three, two, one, MARK.” The count starts again and (claps) off we go.\n\nWe radioed down to the mission management guys, “That team of people needs to be at the landing site when we come home, because there wouldn’t be a landing if there hadn’t been the launch they pulled out of the bucket. Those guys need to be at the landing site, because this whole mission went off because they were sharp, on the money.” Sure enough, somehow somebody arranged that those couple of launch controllers were out at the landing site. It was really pretty cool to look out over the audience at two key people and say, “Thank you for making sure this happened the right way, for the right reasons and safely.” Tough call, tough call, got to be made quickly, got to get it right, and they did.\n\nI asked someone to get me the tape of the LCC loops from that event, because I love to witness those kind of really crisp moments of absolute expertise in action. Big risks, tough issues, a lot of data to fuse, the world is about to be moving at 17,500 miles an hour—we’re fundamentally dealing with bombs. If we do this all right, it’s a fabulous dramatic spaceflight, a tremendous scientific accomplishment. If we do just a few things even slightly wrong, people die. You’ve got to make the call, and you’ve got to make the call now. Teams of people that can come together and do that, and those microcosmic moments—“GO for launch” calls, “GO for deploy” calls, things like that—those are just pretty amazing things to be a part of. That tape’s one of my favorite souvenirs.\n\nRoss-Nazzal: Very soon after you guys returned, they noticed that there was some trouble with one of Hubble’s mirrors. What were some of your thoughts when you heard that?\n\nSullivan: Unfortunately it was with the primary mirror, the big one. I had already been assigned to STS-45 when we learned that. So even before that, immediately after our core debriefs were done, I was already jumping in with the ATLAS [Atmospheric Laboratory for Applications and Science]-1 training team. Actually, I had done a couple of evolutions with them before we launched on 31, just getting things organized and moving forward. I was payload commander. We had the PSs [payload specialists] and MSs [mission specialists] assigned, but hadn’t yet added in the rest of the crew. That required me to detach from the Hubble story pretty quickly and go off and get buried in the ATLAS-1 story. Bruce stayed much more closely engaged in all that and was able to support the tiger team that came together to start figuring out what on Earth can we do about this, or, more appropriately, what off of Earth can we do about this.\n\nI remember hearing it on the news and just being flabbergasted, just worried and disappointed. Not for myself, and not really for our crew, but the entire story and all of the planning and effort and scientific potential and everything else that had already been invested in getting to the point of having the telescope in orbit. It had been decades since 1949, if you want to start counting when Lyman Spitzer [Jr.] first thought about it. To have all of that work, and all the persistence and perseverance and dedication it had taken to culminate with an astoundingly complex and gorgeous vehicle in orbit that couldn’t see right was just heartbreaking.\n\nI followed it through the news and the technical sources that I could get at through the agency. The first little bit of heart I took—and this part seemed to elude the press and the general public—was that it didn’t completely incapacitate the telescope. It was a severe problem, and it really would have compromised severely the telescope’s scientific production, but the telescope wasn’t dead. It could still perform at close to original performance specifications on targets that were sufficiently bright. That really reduced tremendously the range of things that Hubble could have done and, quite critically, it probably would have made impossible the deep field and Hubble constant studies which were at the core of some of the highest priority scientific objectives. But there was some good scientific productivity coming out earlier than many people recognized.\n\nI was only able to vaguely track from afar the progress of the regrouping team—the “what do we do now” team. I was delighted, of course, when Bruce first told me they thought they had figured out a reflective optics correction, because, my God, they went through everything. Well, the first thing they did was set the rule: “No one laughs, no one snickers—anything anybody can imagine goes up on the wall. Then we’ll start doing puts and takes and combining and rejecting and so forth.” It ranged from the “wildly impossible and violates the laws of physics besides” to “you have just got to be kidding me.” I mean things like “We’re going to send astronauts down the barrel of the telescope with polishing rags and reshape the mirror.” Throw everything out there. As they worked through it all, they realized, “The bad news is you did indeed screw up the mirror by an amount that is significant and should be avoidable in figuring astronomical mirrors. The good news is you screwed it up very precisely.” This meant you knew the actual mirror shape very precisely and could do a precise difference calculation of the actual versus the desired and determine the needed correction out of that.\n\nWhen they realized that and figured out that you could correct that via reflective lenses instead of transmissive ones—I don’t have to make all the light come through a lens, I can bounce it off of several mirrors and, through a couple of steps basically restore it to the focus that it should have had—that just struck me as fabulously clever. Finally, to figure out a way to engineer an optical bench that can unfold a set of small arms and position the mirrors precisely enough to do that correction, and that can be built inside of an instrument enclosure—that was just cool.\n\nThe engineering behind the COSTAR [Corrective Optics Space Telescope Axial Replacement] was just fabulous. Absolutely wonderfully clever. I followed all that very keenly, but from the distance of being busy on the ATLAS flight. ATLAS flew in April ’92, and SM1 flew in December of ’93. All of those final ramp-ups and preparations were being done while I was busy with my own final flight and then transitioning to Washington. I followed them rather at a distance. Except for, obviously, following the servicing mission very closely, and being thrilled at the success and the validation of all the servicing and repair procedures and tools that were taken along with it, which was personally gratifying.\n\nMore importantly, it was confirmation that we really had set up the kind of robust, accurate and reliable platform of knowledge, tools, and procedures for the telescope teams to build on going forward, and that was what mattered most. That was a pretty extensive bunch of repairs, and it really gave me great confidence that we had built the quality of foundation that we had aimed to build. We had succeeded in doing that.\n\nRoss-Nazzal: Did you have any chance to go on any PR [Public Relations] tours, or were you pretty busy with your next mission?\n\nSullivan: I didn’t do very many PR tours. We were rolling in pretty fast because it was a multipayload Spacelab flight. One that had been delayed. It was the reflight of Spacelab 1, in a sense. I joined that effort, I probably joined it for real, fully, in late April early May of ’90, and we flew in March ’92. That’s a pretty quick turnaround for bringing a Spacelab crew, all the international linkages, and science teams back up to speed.\n\nRoss-Nazzal: Talk about that. You were the payload commander. For people who don’t know what that is, tell us what it is.\n\nSullivan: Payload commander had a couple pieces to it. Payload commander was the NASA mission specialist who would oversee and organize the typically two mission specialists and two payload specialists who work back-to-back shifts operating complex multiexperiment Spacelab flights. I think several factors went into conceiving of the payload commander role.\n\nOne is you’ve got a very complex Spacelab mission with a dozen to three or four dozen experiments. The training time that the responsible mission specialist should put into that needs to be longer than the pilot and commander probably need to put into the basic orbital operations. So you’re going to want to slot in mission specialists eighteen, maybe twenty-four or thirty-six months in advance so they can build the relationships that are necessary with the scientific team and the payload operations team, get out to the factories, laboratories, engineering facilities, and see the flight hardware. To the degree that the mission simulations are going to represent those payloads—sometimes they do. Sometimes it’s built into the Shuttle Mission Simulator. Sometimes the preparation is done differently. The payload crew is going to play a really substantial role in helping the simulation teams know how to model the payloads correctly.\n\nTo provide a long lead time for the mission crew, to be sure that one of the NASA mission specialists is considered and recognized as authoritative in all those early planning decisions, you want that group to be able to make effective decisions and move the flight preparations forward, not have various people on the team saying someone doesn’t have the authority to do this or we need the commander to make this final decision. Naming a mission specialist as payload commander gave that authority. You’re also counting on that person to use smart judgment when different payload operating or crew issues do impinge on larger flight ops constraints that do eventually need concurrence by the flight director or by the commander. You’re not going to step in and overrule those or supplant those. You need someone who’s representing CB [Astronaut Office] and JSC and able to keep the ball moving in those early lead phases. Help the payload specialist folks who sometimes have had prior flight experience—one of our payload specialists had flown before—but often this is their first time. Giving them some guidance about, “This is how it’s going to get done,” or, “This is the way things normally go.” Being that training voice about life aboard the Shuttle, with some authority backing that up.\n\nThat was the whole idea. Later, closer to launch, when you combine the payload crew with the Shuttle crew, that balance shifts around. The Shuttle commander is the Shuttle commander, there’s no two ways around that. You help the commander in that sense, because you know the mission teams. You know the experiment teams. You have a little more insight about the personalities, cultures, backgrounds, mindsets that the payload team brings to bear and can help jump-start the overall crew’s understanding of that by the time investment that you’ve made. That was the idea behind it.\n\nI got slotted in with Mike [C. Michael] Foale on his first flight. At the time, Byron [K.] Lichtenberg and Mike [Michael] Lampton were going to be the payload specialists. Let’s see, that would have been, like I said, May ’90 pretty well I jumped in. I think I knew I was on the flight from something closer to January of 1990, somewhere in the first quarter of the year. Charlie, Brian [Duffy], and Dave Leestma, the flight deck crew, got slotted in somewhere in 1991, I think. It might have been as early as very late 1990, but I recall it being more like early, mid ’91.\n\nThis was a payload that had been promised as a reflight to the Spacelab 1 guys. That reaches back to 1983. It had then been bouncing through all the different remanifesting exercises for quite some time. They’d been trying to keep the experiment teams together and keep some connective tissue across the team and keep things moving along. Now we really seemed to have a track towards a fixed and firm launch date. So that was that challenge. Get Mike and me into the game, start us up to speed, and see where are all these procedures stand, that have largely lain untouched and not been frequently exercised for almost six, seven years. Get that back up to a more proficient footing and see were we really ready to intersect it with the Shuttle team. There was a lot of time at Marshall [Space Flight Center, Huntsville, Alabama]. All the Spacelab simulators are at Marshall. I was spending most of my time going back and forth to Marshall and learning the experiments and the payloads.\n\nWe had spectrographs and a couple of in-cabin experiments that complemented the ones mounted in the payload bay. It was jump right back into about a dozen instruments and prewritten procedures. The Spacelab guys had taken a fundamentally different tack on how to structure and organize checklists. We combed through those and reoriented them to align more with Shuttle approaches just to help lower the risks of misunderstandings across segments of the flight team. Off we went, finally.\n\nRoss-Nazzal: Would you describe the ATLAS payload itself and what it consisted of?\n\nSullivan: I’d have to haul out one of my reprints to remind myself of all the instruments. This was a Spacelab pallet missions, so we did not have a pressurized module out in the payload bay. Again, were going to have seven folks working on the flight deck and middeck. The difference here for me was that we were going to split up into shifts so that we could do twenty-four-hour operations. There was not enough automated interface to operate all the experiments from the ground if you put the whole crew to sleep at the same time.\n\nWe were going to go with Dave Leestma, Mike Foale, and Byron Lichtenberg on one shift, me, Brian Duffy, and at the time Mike Lampton on the other shift. The idea there was Byron had flight experience and of course Dave Leestma had flight experience. Mike was a rookie. We had experienced Orbiter crew and experienced payload crew, and that was the Red shift. Charlie of course, you don’t put the commander on a shift, the commander does what he wants to do, but Charlie was going to favor towards the Blue shift as his main operating shift, because that worked properly into the landing timelines. Brian was the PLT [pilot], and so he’d have the extra backup of his CDR [commander] being around. I had flight experience. Mike L. hadn’t, he’d been a backup on Spacelab 1.\n\nWe moved towards flight somewhere around—this must have been Christmas of 1990. Mike Lampton got life-threateningly ill and had to be taken off the crew. That moved consideration to the two backup payload specialists. One was Dirk [D.] Frimout of Belgium, and one was Rick [Charles R. Chappell], from Marshall. Who had both stayed with the team since Spacelab 1 days. The Spacelab guys made the decision after some months. We did a little bit of a cross-evaluation. “Let’s start feeding both of them into more simulators. Everyone take a look at them, bring them up the curve a little bit, and see if we find any grounds in performance that argue one way or the other.” Both very competent. There wasn’t really any high level distinguishing factor there. The Spacelab team went with Dirk for the prime, for Mike’s replacement. He was going to be with me on the Blue shift.\n\nThe top priority experiment was one called SEPAC, and that was something like Space [Experiments with] Particle Accelerators. It was about the physics and plasma behaviors of the space environment. It was really cool. We were all pretty jazzed about this. What this thing was, it was basically an electron gun. In a sense, a large capacitor in the payload bay that would build a charge up to a certain level and then release a bolt of electrons.\n\nThe idea was to have the Orbiter oriented so that the aperture of the instrument would inject these electrons roughly along the magnetic field line down towards the atmosphere near the polar regions. You can think of it basically as a dose-response experiment. In medicine or other experiments, you put in a dose, you see what happens. Dial the next dose up or down, and see how the response varies. The idea here was to try to better understand the physics behind auroral phenomena by injecting a known dose of electron energy into the upper atmosphere. Then with a camera out in the payload bay and one in the cabin, measuring the brightness of the aurora type glow that that dose of electrons induced. If I know I put in this many kilovolts of energy, and I measured that luminosity, maybe I can start to get a clearer understanding of how the energy of the incoming solar particles couples into the atmosphere and creates auroral luminescence.\n\nThat was pretty exciting. It had failed early on Spacelab 1, and so this was a prime driver for the reflight, one of scientific life’s tragic little ironies. An experiment like this takes electric power from the Orbiter into the pallet and then distributes it to the different experiments with an electrical bus on the pallet. There’s a fuse, of course, between the Orbiter primary payload bus and the pallet. If really dumb stuff happens on the pallet, the fuse blows and the Orbiter is protected. There was also some fusing within the distribution bus on the pallet, in fact, which probably came from all the littler experiments saying, “If this sucker fries, it’ll kill all of us.” They probably insisted that NASA fuse SEPAC so it doesn’t take all the rest of this down. I might be recalling the rating of this fuse incorrectly, but I think it was like a twenty-amp fuse between SEPAC and the other. It was fifty amps between the Orbiter primary payload bus and the pallet, and I’m sure it was a lower rating, like twenty amps into SEPAC. We, to a one, all squinted at the European guys and said, “Oh, isn’t that awfully low?” They sort of agreed it was awfully low, but the fuse was buried deeply enough inside the housing unit that nothing really was to be done about it. Hold that thought. It comes back later.\n\nSo there was SEPAC. There were a couple of spectrographs measuring solar spectra at different altitudes and latitudes, via solar occultations. The instrument would acquire the Sun far above the Earth. The Sun has a known spectrum. You’re measuring that spectrum. As you go around the Earth, what happens is that the Sun effectively sets. The Sun disappears behind the Earth because you’re moving away from it. As that geometry changes, your line of sight to the Sun effectively knifes down through the atmosphere, so you see changes in the spectrum of the Sun in every second that you’re sampling that amount to measuring the composition of the atmosphere at all those different levels. Fun clever stuff. It was particle physics, it was atmospheric composition, that was the suite of them, and I won’t remember the whole list of experiments off the top of my head. SEPAC was the biggie.\n\nThe complexity in the cabin was we had a handheld camera with photomultipliers and different filters that was the adjunct to SEPAC, and you wanted to get auroral photography, Earth limb photography, and shots of these patches that we had fired the electron gun into. That became a pretty elaborate ensemble of dark shades so you could shield the window, not have any glare, get yourself all dark-adapted, stack up all these filters and diffraction gratings, and get these photo observations. It was still photo. We were still talking photo observations back then. We’re talking film and film changes, just complex photographic assembly and disassembly.\n\nSEPAC was going to fire, finally, a day or so into the flight. The first firing was going to be on the Red shift, not long after they had taken over. Us Blue guys were all down below mucking around with dinner and starting to get changed for sleep. We knew it was coming, and we were eager to see it, but we thought we should get out of their way, let them get set up for this, and get into it. It’s the first of several firings. Some will come on our shift. We’re all going to want to see this. So we’re staying out of their way, being considerate crewmates. We hear them going through the checklist. Then we hear this, “Oh my God, look at that!” and four other bodies come flying up to the flight deck. There’s a cardinal rule on spaceflights, or at least on all my crews, which is “there shall be no sentences from the flight deck ending in ‘that,’” as in “What the hell was that?” ‘Cause you’ll terrify the guys down below, who can’t see anything. So they had violated that rule and had all four of us come flooding up to the flight deck just in time to see.\n\nThe SEPAC looked like—out in the payload bay it would remind you of a house paint canister. You could see a little bit obliquely into the top of it. It’s about to go into the second firing, there are now seven noses pasted up against the window. This odd blue. It felt like I’d stepped into a science fiction movie. This oscillating blue blob is accumulating vaguely in and around the can, as if some luminescent blue creature is about to ooze out of this can. It’s getting a little brighter and larger. Then suddenly this parcel of blue energy leaps away from the Orbiter, just jumps out of the can. You actually could see it—obviously at the speed of light, so it goes by quickly. It was starting to curve away. You could see the curvature of the magnetic field line. You could just see it begin to spiral along, like all this material you drilled into your head in college physics you’re now seeing in front of your eyes: the curvature of the magnetic field lines, the electron gyroradius as this thing spirals around it. “Wow, fabulous!” Then the fuse fried.\n\nRoss-Nazzal: So it was the end?\n\nSullivan: End of SEPAC! They got like two or three doses off. We all each managed to see at least one. We joked around a lot, and I still joke sometimes, that I’m sure we are the only Space Shuttle crew to ever fire photon torpedoes, because that’s what this was. It was like firing photon torpedoes down towards the atmosphere. Then it died, and we were distraught.\n\nRoss-Nazzal: How disappointing!\n\nSullivan: Oh, it was terrible. It was terrible. We told them it was the wrong fuse. Our photon torpedoes were much better than George Lucas’s photon torpedoes.\n\nRoss-Nazzal: This as I understand it, was the first Mission to Planet Earth.\n\nSullivan: The first Spacelab Mission to Planet Earth.\n\nRoss-Nazzal: Oh, it was the first Spacelab Mission to Planet Earth.\n\nSullivan: Yes, the whole Mission to Planet Earth Program thrust had already come out. It was somewhat teed up by the Paine Commission report, really crystallized and taken by the agency I think first in Sally’s report, the Ride Report, in the rather early days after the Challenger accident. Remember, this mission actually had been planned and committed as a reflight back in 1983. This was not a mission originally conceived of as a Mission to Planet Earth, but the nature of its scientific work really genuinely did align with the purposes of that new program, which was gaining momentum and clarity. That was appropriate, but it was a late addition of a moniker.\n\nRoss-Nazzal: Your crew, as you pointed out, was broken up into two shifts. Was there any competition between the two teams?\n\nSullivan: No. No, there really wasn’t. Not really. None of us were really of that sort of personality, “Got to prove to the other guy.” I was just looking around to see if I had any of those reprints. Charlie didn’t ever really use a device like that to drive performance. Commitment to each other, commitment to the mission, the intrinsic factors that he exemplified and reinforced. You want to do right by the mission. You want to do right by the opportunity you’ve been given. You want to certainly do right by, live up to, and deliver on the expectations of a leader like Charlie. He wouldn’t have needed to set up some fake game for me to make me do anything better.\n\nRoss-Nazzal: One of the things Charlie pointed out in regards to this mission that he did that was unusual, I think, was that he had the crew participate in some sort of Myers-Briggs or personality type testing. Did you find that helpful?\n\nSullivan: I actually did. The operational psych guys I think always made that option available to commanders if at any time they felt that some better understanding of a crew member or the whole crew would help make sure that there was good cohesion and group performance. We were going to fly two out of four guys who’d been sitting around for a decade waiting. We had a four experienced Shuttle crew members and three rookies. Quite a different mix of folks around. I think Charlie knew he wanted to look at everybody to have a sense of how best to move them and drive them, support, encourage, and propel them, and suggested to us all—and it was a suggestion, and I think we all felt fully free to say what we wanted, not have to go along. We were all going to take it, and he wanted us to know he would see everybody’s. The optional part was whether we would share our profile with all the other members of the crew. He recommended that we do this and have a group discussion around who are we, what factors are making us tick. If strain goes up, pressure goes up, or anxiety goes up, what do we need to understand about each other so that we will have a greater likelihood of performing just as effectively in an anxious or stressful circumstance as we can when things are easygoing? Because everyone has got sort of a home base or default response pattern that they tend to move back to when things get strained. When things are not strained, you’ve got some more flexibility and more latitude in your ways of interacting with people. That’s just normal human nature. So we did that.\n\nIt was very illuminating. I think I’d seen the early psych profile that they do on all of us somewhere back years before that. It was interesting to see a new snapshot and look across the whole group. The guy who did that with us had some stats on the kinds of personality modes. His model has, I think, six different personality modes. It was Myers-Briggs-like, but it wasn’t that model. The normal distribution of those modes across the population, and the way the Astronaut Office is constructed. My recollection is the two very mission- or purpose- or goal-oriented types out of the six constitute typically on the order maybe 15 percent of the general population, but those two types constitute 95 or 98 percent of the astronaut population. Whereas more dreamer or salesman type folks are very underrepresented in the astronaut population. Not an altogether unexpected thing, but I didn’t know that mixture of distributions. It was interesting. I found it helpful. I think it did open up a couple different avenues of conversation across the crew. Byron Lichtenberg had been a candidate for the mission specialist selection back with our group and had not made it into the class. He ended up with the Spacelab 1 team and had flown as a payload specialist on Spacelab 1.\n\nThere’d been some bit of tension around, “Scientists are flying. We gave up our careers and came over to become astronauts, and then these guys are flying before we are.” There was a little bit of that in the astronaut/ESA [European Space Agency]/Spacelab world in the early ’80s, I hadn’t known Byron well. I just only had sort of an impression of him out of Spacelab 1. I think he and I, in particular, got an interesting different angle each on the other, and went off and had a beer and talked about it some. We live in different worlds and haven’t worked together since the flight, but we became much better able to support each other, understand each other, and really work together as colleagues driving both shifts because of the exercise that we did there, than if we had just gone in with whatever stereotype or bits of impressions we had of each other from back in the early ’80s. So it was really helpful.\n\nRoss-Nazzal: Any other thoughts about the mission itself? I know you worked on SAREX [Shuttle Amateur Radio Experiment].\n\nSullivan: Yes. The ham radio stuff was very fun. We all got into that. We used Dave’s call sign. Although several of us got a no-key amateur license just as part of making sure we trained well. I wasn’t quite sure what to expect of that as we were training, but once we got up there, it was quite fun.\n\nSome of my more amusing recollections come out of that. I think Dave and I in particular got into this. Dave was the key SAREX guy on the Red shift and me on the Blue shift. I figured out pretty quickly that it wasn’t going to be hard to talk to people on every continent. Ham radio guys have all sorts of little milestones that they notch their belts with, and one of them is, “Worked all seven continents.” So sitting in your backyard in Columbus, through the magic of ham radio antennas, you talk to someone on every one of the seven continents. Well, there’s not a lot of people in Antarctica to talk to. For a lot of reasons getting Antarctica is not a trivial thing to do, but we had some passes, especially on the Red shift, where our high latitude southern passes were near the Antarctic Peninsula, where places like the US Palmer Station is. So it was becoming pretty fun to look out the window. I remember one pass where I could see all of New Zealand at night.\n\nAs you go by, you’re hearing call signs from different people. It’s very quick. It’s not really conversation. So many people are eager for the opportunity to say they reached the Shuttle that if you threw out your call sign and the code word that says, “Anybody out there,” you would just have a flood of voices coming back. You’d pick a call sign and say, “Whiskey Charlie Alpha Roger,” and they could now write a little card that says, “I got a two-way exchange. That counts.” You’re just traffic-copping a lot of these things, but it was quite fun. I particularly liked at night when you’d see a whole continent lit by light and be talking to people. Just imagine, it’s after dinner. They’re spending some time on the radio. They know you’re overhead. You’re probably a satellite in their sky. They’re really keen to be talking to you.\n\nI worked some passes across Australia one time where we had three successive passes, each one several hundred miles further west because the Earth rotates underneath you. One was offshore, one was probably right about over the Sydney coastal area, and then one was inshore from that. On the third pass, I picked up a call sign and acknowledged it. A man’s voice came up quickly pleading, “Could I talk a little more?” He’d been working all three passes, an hour and a half between them. It was now pretty late on the ground in Australia. He had his six- or seven-year-old daughter there who he really had wanted to connect so she could say hello to someone on the Shuttle. So I told all other frequencies stand by and spent a couple minutes talking with his little girl. I thought it was just kind of neat.\n\nDave woke me up one night. He finally reached Antarctica and connected with someone at Palmer Station. He’d already been telling me about how he was going to try to do that, because it’s only a tiny window of time. “If you catch them on one night, ask them if they’ll commit to man the radio the next night. Wake me up for that one, so I can talk to Antarctica and chalk that one off.” So the second night he gets me up. It’s all set, and I make the contact with Antarctica.\n\nDuffy has been a bit above all of this for a while. He had his license, but he’s busy. He’s got lots of things to do. So Dave and I are down after that evening when I connected with Antarctica, and we’re both celebrating at the shift handover that we’ve now both talked to all seven continents, that’s very cool. Suddenly I see Duffy counting on his fingers and racking up how many he’s gotten, and he realizes—I think he needed Asia, and then he’d get Antarctica the next night with David. So he needs Asia. We had some night pass coming up right along just offshore parallel to the islands of Japan. Duffy has got this figured out in his head.\n\nI remember he takes the antenna, stuffs it in the window, picks up the handset, throws out the call sign to Japan. There’s rabid ham fans in Japan. He throws the call sign out. Honest to goodness, it sounded like 100,000 voices came back. He grabbed one call sign, said, “Roger, got you,” turned off the radio and pulled out the antenna. I said, “Duffy, you are cruel. There are 99,999 really disappointed people on the ground there.”\n\n(Break in audio)\n\nRoss-Nazzal: You were talking about Brian Duffy and shutting off his radio.\n\nSullivan: Yes, absolutely cruel. The other fun thing I remember—ham radiowise—is that when we landed, in all of the postflight milling about, waiting for people to regroup at the welcome back event, I had a second to chat with Jan [Janet M.] Duffy. Duffy’s son Shaun—who would have been something around seven, fairly young at the time of this flight—while Daddy was in orbit, had gone and gotten his ham license. Jan was looking forward to having Brian discover when they got back to Houston was Shaun was now a ham radio operator. I just thought that was going to be a neat little bit of homecoming news.\n\nRoss-Nazzal: Yes, very cool. Anything else stand out about that mission in terms of experiments? I’ve got some other questions, but I wasn’t sure if you wanted to talk about them; no one really has shared those sort of details with us about that flight.\n\nSullivan: The rest of the experiment ops were pretty benign, pretty vanilla. It was notable to have an in-flight press conference with the king of Belgium, because Dirk, the first Belgian citizen to fly, was aboard. We will soon have the first European commander of the Space Station [Frank De Winne], who will also be Belgian. Set up the cameras and all that preparation, and all seven of us mustered up with Dirk right at the middle. It was going to be Dirk and Charlie, of course—the commander and the guest of honor, with the rest of us clearly and properly as window dressing.\n\nDirk, bless his heart—as we were preparing for it, he said, “Well, no. We’re going to want the microphone here so I can pass it to you for other questions.” We said, “No, Dirk, this is not going to be necessary. The microphone is going to start here with Charlie, and then it’s going to go to you.” “No, no, no, but he will want to speak—.” “No, trust me, your king is not going to need to speak to any of us. We are window dressing. This is just fine, don’t worry about it.” So that was fun.\n\nRoss-Nazzal: Any challenges on that flight other than the fuse?\n\nSullivan: Other than the fuse blowing, no. No real significant anomalies. Experiment ops all went standardly pretty smooth. No spacewalk issues of course. We were doing some filming for one of the first Johnson Space Center efforts at educational videos. That did generate one of the funnier moments. I’m a pretty good photographer and can be fairly finicky about composition and lighting. I’m sure my crewmates could say I would be outrageously, obnoxiously, and foolishly finicky about some of those things. Duffy is trying to film something on the middeck with the camera way over by the WCS [Waste Collection System]. I’m two thirds of the way towards the starboard side up by the front. The idea is I’ll be floating free, not attached to anything, with an inflated Earth globe spinning next to me. That’ll be the fun visual cue that “No, no, really, we filmed this in orbit.”\n\nWe’re trying to get the angle right and the lighting right, because you almost couldn’t get far enough away with the camera to get the shot we want. We had these funky little cage-protected lights that would mount on top of the Arriflex camera to brighten a scene. They had cages around them because they would get so hot. We’re back and forth, we’re tweaking, I’m being finicky and obnoxious. Duffy is probably just about ready to kill me. Finally he says, “We’re going to do this.”\n\nSo I go over, get in position. He starts the camera going. He goes to flip the big on-off toggle switch on this light. The light was never really quite designed to mount to an Arriflex camera, and so everybody had been cobbling it together with tape and other things. Duffy gets the camera going. His jaw muscles were just about giving up. He’s got his teeth clenched so tight trying not to snap at me. He flips the switch on the light. The switch is so stiff that in flipping it he undoes all of the tape and the light just launches from the camera and goes spiraling up towards the ceiling. This look of combined astonishment, rage, and utter frustration flashes across his face. I completely lost it and just let go of the bulkhead and just started cracking up. The scene is this flashing strobe as the light goes by and me floating in a ball of laughter drifting off. We didn’t get that scene. We stopped right there.\n\nRoss-Nazzal: Needed a moment, huh?\n\nSullivan: Yes, we needed one. Yes, and I also remember Dave and Duffy doing a golf tournament. Balling up a sock, and tying it up with gray tape—they’re both avid golfers—taking the inspection mirror out, and Dave did a little chip shot across from one side of the middeck to the other. Then he tried to get clever and calculate how many seconds. They made the cup. They took a roll of gray tape and put it on the galley wall with a pencil sticking out of it, as if that was the hole and the greens flag. So just monkeying around and having a bit of a good time.\n\nRoss-Nazzal: Charlie told us that he agreed to have the crew taken off on gurneys. Do you recall this? Were you one of the participants?\n\nSullivan: I wasn’t taken off on a gurney.\n\nRoss-Nazzal: No? Okay.\n\nSullivan: No. Walked into the crew transfer van and sat on the brown Barcaloungers.\n\nRoss-Nazzal: He had mentioned that there was some study. Somebody wanted to study the impact of zero G on the human body, and that it would be better if people came off in gurneys rather than experiencing too much gravity.\n\nSullivan: That did not happen. One of the experiments that I participated in was basically a kinematics, body mechanics. Preflight they get you to a little studio, put on gym clothes, put little luminescent dots, IR [Infrared] dots, on different key joints, so they could film you in low light with IR and do stick mapping of your body mechanics as you walked, trotted, and ran, running through different speeds on a treadmill. They’d get a couple baseline data takes before flight. That was one of the groups. There’s always several that would like to catch you ASAP [As Soon As Possible] after landing without much gravity influence yet evident and see if they can map the readaptation back to one G. That was one of the groups that was eager to get you back into the lab as quickly as possible after touchdown so they could see if there was any residual change in your gait or behavior. We did that. I got there within forty-five minutes or an hour after landing. Minor but not very substantial differences from the preflight routine.\n\nWe didn’t get off on gurneys. That was the only time I got off on a CTV [Crew Transport Vehicle], the Dulles Airport transporter vehicles that NASA got several of so that you could bring it out on the runway, raise the cab to the height of the hatch so it’s a level, no one has to go up and down stairs, which is both a balance concern and a trip and fall concern. From the medical guys that want experimental data, the mechanics of going down a stair are certainly going to be probably inducing more gravity effects faster than just walking on a level surface. The CTV had, like I said, the Barcalounger. Same kind of recliners that you would have at Kennedy [Space Center, Florida] before you got on board that can accommodate you in a pressure suit and can lean back. So if someone is having any orthostatic issues, or if they’re just tired, or if you want to minimize the readjustment, you can put them close to horizontal in the loungers and just drive them off the runway right to the O&C [Operations and Checkout] building, right to the flight clinic, or right to wherever your postflight biomedical facility is, if there’s a special area set up, and go at it.\n\nRoss-Nazzal: The only other question I had about this flight is did you go on the PR flight to Belgium.\n\nSullivan: I did not go on the PR trip to Belgium. I was either about to go into confirmation hearings or just confirmed at NOAA [National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration], when that came along. I ended up having to stay behind.\n\nRoss-Nazzal: When you were working this flight, were you considering leaving NASA at that point?\n\nSullivan: Yes. A friend of mine had been serving as NOAA chief scientist from something like 1989 or ‘90. Around Christmastime of 1991 or early part of ’92, she got in touch with me and said that a variety of family factors—aging mother and things like that—she had realized she needed to step down from the chief scientist post. She wanted to put my name in to the White House or in to the secretary of commerce as a candidate replacement. Was I interested? Would I let my name go forward? If I was, could I get up to Washington in the next three to six weeks for a courtesy visit with the under secretary of commerce that runs NOAA.\n\nI thought about that for a while. The turnaround between 31 and 45 had been reasonably tight, ’90 and ’92, and I was happy for that. It had been a long gap from the first to the second flight, so I was pleased to have a quick turn. I’d realized in the run-up to 45 that I was feeling I would really be ready for a bit of a downtime, some kind of shift, a little bit of certainly a timeout in terms of not a quick turnaround to another flight. Coming up on fifteen years in the program I was probably at a point where I really ought to do a personal review, taking stock, and consider. Either reconfirm that yes and yea verily this is still exactly where I want to be, and the outlook of things that I can see to be a part of, and opportunities in this arena are just what I want for a goodly ’nother five to ten years as far as I can tell. Or, are interests and desires for personal growth and professional development, are they shifting at all and beginning to argue for some readjustment.\n\nI had found for a couple years, I guess, that I was enjoying more and more the chances I had to really get more deeply into educational program design, museum advisory work, all done on a volunteer basis. I’d really loved the creativity and the challenge of designing the Challenger Center Program for June Scobee and getting that launched for her. That had really been fun. As I followed the general progress of things in oceanography, satellite remote sensing, and environmental science, I was finding that was claiming more and more active interest compared to my earlier years in the program.\n\nThose two things alone had me questioning, “Do I want to see if there’s a way to craft a different mixture of those things into being an astronaut, or are they early signs that there’s another direction that’s worth considering for the next phase of my career?” That was as far as I’d gotten. Good moment to take a bit of a timeout and do a rethink and consider where you are and what the next career phases are that are important to you.\n\nThen this offer came up, and, NOAA, there’s not another agency that captures so many of the things that I’ve always been interested in. It’s geography, information systems, and geographic mapping. It’s coastal survey, it’s ships, it’s spacecraft, it’s airplanes, it’s weather, it’s everything. Just on first principles, well, the first answer ought to be certainly I’d like to have that next conversation. The secretary is going to have a slate. It’s not a foregone conclusion. I talked with Charlie about it. Told him it was at least intriguing enough that I’d like to work our schedule so that I could pop up to Washington and have a courtesy meeting with these guys and see, just take at least that step. He worked with me to arrange that. That would have been probably sometime in early February. Just went up and came back down.\n\nThen put my head back into flight and went off and flew. The guy who was heading NOAA at the time was John [A.] Knauss from Rhode Island. He actually reached me by phone in the crew quarters on landing day. My thinking in the weeks after meeting with him, as we ran forward, headed in the direction that this would be a really interesting thing to do. It’s a presidential appointment. It’s not a career civil service slot. It left lots of opportunities to consider crafting it as a leave of absence from the agency, not necessarily a one-way street. It could be a really pretty interesting thing to do, to get regrounded in the sciences, get a closer look at the industry and academic side of things, and just for general education and general information. Maybe that would add up, if I did it, to a decision that it was time to move in other fundamental career directions. Maybe it would just be a breather and refreshing pause, and I’d end up back in NASA or staying in NOAA. Couldn’t foresee all of that, but it had become more and more interesting to have a two-to-four-year stint in something like that.\n\nJohn reached me, actually, in the crew quarters before we got on the planes and came back to Houston. I’ve always wondered if he waited until we landed to be sure I was going to get back. Said he’d made his decision, and I was indeed the person whose name he would like to send forward to the White House, if I would confirm that I was still interested and give him some sense of when I might be able to get up to Washington and take some next steps. So off we went.\n\nRoss-Nazzal: When did you officially accept that position?\n\nSullivan: I decided to sell my house, and move to Washington, and just take it as a blank slate whether I would end up doing a long time in Washington or come back to Houston. Just free up everything and be open to whatever came next. I packed up and moved to Washington in July of ’92. My nomination had already gone over to the Senate. It went over to the Senate in April. I’d asked NASA to detail me to NOAA so I still had my career status and was a NASA person on loan to NOAA for that window of time between nomination and confirmation.\n\nWell, it was a Bush 41 [George H.W. Bush] nomination, so of course that went OBE in November of ’92 when he lost the election to President [William J.] Clinton. I, in the meanwhile, had decided this really did look like an interesting thing I’d like to do so I set about trying to figure out how to make the case that I should be the new group’s nominee. I’m about as apolitical as you can get, thanks in part to the Hatch Act. I’m a competent safe neutral choice for any administration. I can serve either administration, and I would like to serve as the chief scientist. I managed to figure that out and make that case, and so got renominated by the Clinton team in early ’93 and finally confirmed by the Senate in like March of ’93.\n\nRoss-Nazzal: Did you have to testify?\n\nSullivan: Yes.\n\nRoss-Nazzal: How did that go?\n\nSullivan: That was pretty funny. The three presidential nominees who were tapped to head NOAA all testified at the same hearing. So there was the under secretary for oceans and atmosphere, who’s the administrator of NOAA; there’s the assistant secretary, who’s also the NOAA deputy. Traditionally that’s the guy that handles all the coastal zone management and fisheries regulation issues. Then there’s the chief scientist.\n\nWe did all the briefing books, murder boards, and things that you normally do. We had one session in particular where Jim [D. James] Baker, who was going to be the head of NOAA, wanted to get more intense on, “Now what are the things they’re really going to roll in and chew on us about?” I said, “Jim, these are great. We’ll do all the murder boards, but here’s how it’s going to go. You, they’re going to roll in on and chew on, because they need to make the point, at least the gesture, to you, about the executive-legislative branch tension, the checks and balances, and plant the message with you that you dare not think that you unilaterally control this agency.” They have strong say over it, and their constituencies matter. “Doug they’re going to wire-brush because he’s going to be the guy working fisheries and coastal zone stuff that gets directly to resource "
