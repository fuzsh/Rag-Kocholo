        "text": "I have had some interesting discussions on labels recently. About their limitations, about the risks associated with adopting one (if you have the choice), about their stigma. These discussions were not only in the context of my choice to adopt the autistic label. They were also with parents considering whether a diagnostic route is necessary for their child and with colleagues and friends when discussing diversity, equity, and inclusion. In all these discussions I noticed a yearning for a world in which we do not need labels to carve out a space for ourselves that is safe and welcoming; and I noticed a fear of being misunderstood and by extension finding limitations imposed on us that were not valid.\n\nIn this edition I will share how I came to the decision to embrace the autistic label for myself and offer up a view on the efficacy of labels despite their limitations.\n\nUnless you have had reason to find out more about what autism is, you are likely to have a vague picture in your mind of what autism looks like. I imagine it might look like a white boy, or a hunched over white man. If a boy, I would not be surprised if your visualisation has him hitting his head with the side of his hand, muttering things over and over, oblivious to the world around him; or zoned in on some detail in a room with no interest in what is going on around him. If a man, he is wringing his hands, eyes averted, stumbling over his words trying to get some genius idea across to his small audience and ready to dash out of the room at the slightest stimulus.\n\nIf this is true for you, I will not hold it against you, because before I had reason to look into it, my picture wasn’t far off what I have just described. It is after all the image depicted in the media most often. It is no surprise then that I could not see myself in this picture.\n\nWhat is not as widely known about autism is that there has been a growing recognition in the research community that autism has many different presentations. And underneath these presentations, there is something that connects us autists regardless of how it impacts our interaction with our environment and people.\n\nThe “something” that connects us is that we experience most things intensely (even, and perhaps especially, empathy) and we often have a bottom-up processing style. What that means, in a nutshell, is that when there is too much going on (emotionally, physically and in terms of sensory input), it becomes all-encompassing and leaves an autist in a shutdown or meltdown mode. Processing ceases.\n\nWhen processing ceases, some of us might look odd, but more importantly the opportunity to learn and/or experience what is happening stops. In other words, before an autist can even notice that they are at a nice social event or that there is interesting information being shared, the number of stimuli and information that serve as the building blocks for the whole experience becomes more than the processing power available and the whole does not get built.\n\nThere is a lot of good information on autism out there (which I am happy to share as I come across it) and my aim is not to repeat all of it here. Instead, I want to give some tangible examples of what autism might look like in a person that does not seem autistic and why understanding autism has been a breakthrough for me. If I were not willing to try on the label, the breakthrough might never have happened.\n\nAs a child I was a reasonably social and confident girl, good with communication and oratory, often one of the top students in the class, provincial swimmer, displayed leadership potential. I was optimistic and opinionated. From neither my parents nor my teachers’ point of view there would have been any reason to think I process atypically nor that I need any extra support because I did most of what I did well and independently. Looking back, I can see what should have been signs that my strategies for adapting to life’s requirements were quite extreme for my age. Though few parents or teachers would question much if what they see is a well-behaved, socially integrated, academically strong, and physically active child who seems quite happy and content on the face of it.\n\nNot many were aware that the following was also true of me (just a few examples):\n\n- I spun. I hid. I sat in the shower with my head in the spray finding it soothing to hear and feel the shower drops.\n\n- When a day drained me, the impact was so physically intense that I would crawl around our house because there was a weight in my body that would not let me stand.\n\n- I walked with my eyes shut often when the light hurt my eyes.\n\n- I read non-stop, walking to school with a book, reading between classes in the corridors, reading in classes as soon as no teaching or learning was happening. This is how I drowned out what was happening around me.\n\n- I played imaginatively.\n\n- I rarely hugged, I hated kisses. When my siblings shared my mum’s bed when my dad was travelling I would, after some coaxing, drag my mattress across to my parents’ bedroom and partake in the family event from a distance.\n\n- I started sleeping 4-5 hours a night when I was about ten. I did this so that I could use the quiet of the night to feel prepared for classes and handle quick-fire questions from teachers. I also did this because I had no energy to do much in the way of homework after school, so often slept first and woke up exceedingly early.\n\n- I used my holidays to rest because I was exhausted. I slept and read and did not need much activity or play.\n\n- I could never handle watching a lot of television, it didn’t grip me, and I felt I didn’t have time for it even as a child. I often experienced it as noise and movement of images.\n\n- I gave up biology as a subject when I had run out of memory tools to use and recognised that my short-term memory would not suffice on its own. I stuck to the subjects I could reason my way through.\n\nAs an adult I have done well in my career. I have enjoyed most of my adulthood, and I throw myself into my work and experiences because I do things passionately, as an all or nothing type. But I somehow do not notice when things are getting too much for me until it is too late. Repeatedly. I cannot tell you how often people have told me not to take on too much. People say this because I like work and I work long hours sometimes. I think what they mean is that I should work normal hours and not give too much of myself to a role. This makes sense as a solution to impending burnout. It just does not suit me very well.\n\nThanks to my growing understanding of autism, I am now understanding that taking on too much for me, means:\n\n- Doing a job that requires of me to spend most of time responding to the needs and interruptions of others and my surroundings.\n\n- Being forced to stop before I am done – the knock-on effect on time is often greater if I cannot see a process through to the end.\n\n- Having no plan to manage my sensory experience of any given day.\n\nMy point being, exercise and meditation, though good for me, will not address the reasons why life gets to me.\n\nAt work, I process and build my solutions systematically, in detail, and often with great result. Each interruption has the power to undo all my progress because of a poor working memory and renders me inefficient against my will and preference. This happens because the work I am busy with has not come together in my head yet, and so I need a restart. Systematically, logically, thinking through my building blocks until the whole comes together. Until the blocks become a whole, I typically feel out of my depth. Once it has come together, it becomes a part of me. And once a part of me, I can teach it, coach it, support it, email it, share it, present it, run with it. And more than that, I can talk about the “why”. Believe you me, not everyone does this. Some people can follow, and remember, process without a why.\n\nI know this because I often have the following conversation:\n\nMe: “Why?”\n\nThem: “Because it is the process.”\n\nMe: “Why is it the process?”\n\nThem: “We don’t know, you need to ask team X.”\n\nMe to team X: “Why?”\n\nTeam X: “Because we need it to do the next step.”\n\nMe to team X: “Why do you need to do the next step.”\n\nTeam X: “Because it has to be done before the deadline.”\n\nFor sure, we need people who can follow process at speed for the sake of getting the job done, I am just not one of them. I eventually do the job at speed, but for some reason, this only happens once I know it inside out and am comfortable with the “why.”\n\nFor most of my working life I did the same thing that I used to do as a girl. Most of my productive work happened outside of work hours and because it was just the way that I have always worked I did not think much of it. That is, until I had kids who did not sleep and needed me outside of work hours. Suddenly, I had to figure out how to do my best work during work hours. I couldn’t do it.\n\nI have a 2- and 5-year-old. They make a lot of noise and it overloads my auditory processing, they create a lot of mess which overloads my visual processing, they create smells which overload my olfactory processing, they feel so intensely which overwhelms me emotionally, they want to climb on me which makes my skin crawl and they distract me which leads me to making horrible coffee and disappoints my hope of a taste sensation that will help me balance it all out. They do all of this before I have tried to dress them, feed them, or load them in the car to get them to childcare at which point I am late for work with a house turned upside down and without energy. 8:30am and with no opportunity to replenish the lost energy until my own bedtime. Yes, I do love them.\n\nI can see how some parents might counter, isn’t that just parenthood? Perhaps.\n\nSay my husband has been with the kids and I am just arriving home. I come in and I scan the room. I take it all in and describe everything I see and think out loud. I smell urine, I look for the bulge on the backside of my youngest and notice the full nappy, I say she might not have been changed for a while and that I need to check for nappy rash, then I see the kids have their jackets on and worry about my kids over-heating in a cosy room, I look at the sink and see the bottle has not been rinsed out and I fear the rotten milk smell that awaits me, I notice the dishwasher is half packed and that the light Tupperware lids are packed in a way that they’ll be upturned in the spray of the wash and be left with dirty stinky water in them and so I worry about whether it does more damage to just repack them (I am grateful the dishwasher is packed after all) or deal with the dirty water later. I hear one girl screaming and one crying and I know it is a no nap day for the youngest and the eldest has had a few stand-offs against her dad. I look at the time and they are behind schedule and so I think of all the steps I need to compress into 20 minutes before it is lights out time. I notice the half-eaten dinner and understand that they are tired and fidgety but also hungry and that they need more food. They run to me for a cuddle while my husband tries to say they have not eaten much, it has been hard going and so they had a good jump on the trampoline instead.\n\nI stare at him blankly after having rattled off all my observations on arrival audibly and reach for the dishwasher to fix the Tupperware which has suddenly become one thing too much to have to handle later. At this point, I relax, having processed what I have come home to and feel happy to be with them.\n\nAnd then after a few seconds my brain starts registering what my kids have been saying for a while: \"Mummy, mummy look at this!\" And as I turn to them, my brain registers that my husband was trying to say they have had a nice jump outside and I realise I have done it again. My kids and husband feel unheard, judged, and criticised as a result of how I process arriving home. I have settled myself and simultaneously unsettled them by not coming across as present and listening. It is a work in progress for us all.\n\nYou might offer some great advice. You might say I could process it all silently and then no one needs to feel criticised or ignored. My counter: my eyes would be dashing around the room, no one would receive any eye contact, I would be mute in my response to anything spoken to me. I would look autistic.\n\nLabels have their limitations, but in some cases, they come with information that help us to reach a better place. Sometimes the route to that better place is through the label. If not for being able to google the word “autism”, I would have had nothing to search for, nothing to read, nothing to help me understand why being a working mum was so incredibly hard for me (reminder, not hard because being a parent is hard for everyone, hard to the extent that I desperately wanted to escape from it because I knew in my gut I could not do it). Instead, my search terms would have brought me answers that did not suit me and might have made the situation worse. An understanding of myself through the lens of autism reassured me that there are practical solutions that suit me. Sleep, mindfulness, meditation, exercise, meaningful connection is as good for me as for the next person, but I needed solutions that would:\n\n1. Give me a break from noise and protect me from unnecessary work interruptions.\n\n2. Help me to create spaces that do not overwhelm me.\n\n3. Allow me to work in “flow” more often, something that fuels and energises me.\n\n4. Give me a vocabulary that I could use to explain what was going on with me (e.g. I am not angry, it is just too noisy; I am not unappreciative of a nice day out, it is just too hot; I am not critical, I am just processing; I am not unhappy, just tired to the point of tears; I am not incompetent when I forget things and make mistakes, it really is just one of those days. Processing has ceased.\n\nYes, let us continue to address the unfortunate stigma associated with some labels used in the context of inclusion. Autism being one example. But where labels are the only available route to better understanding between us, they are the best we have until we replace them with something better. They may not be perfect, but in their imperfection, they give us tools and vocabulary that can serve as a starting point that we might not have had otherwise. Labels are tools. Used responsibly they can do a lot of good but used without due respect for the people behind them they can do a lot of damage.\n\nI adopted this label, but I also want to reserve the right to have chosen not to. Not everyone needs a label, depending on how safe and welcoming they find their environment to be. I support that people choose how they describe themselves to the world and explain why their choice makes sense to them. Sometimes we need labels and their content to survive first, and then thrive.\n\nResource/Information request:"
