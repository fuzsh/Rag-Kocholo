        "text": "Hollie McNish has stopped talking for a moment; this doesn’t happen much during the interview. I have just asked her why she thinks her “poetic memoir”, Nobody Told Me, recently won the Poetry Society’s Ted Hughes award (previous recipients include Kate Tempest and Alice Oswald). “I really don’t know,” she says after a brief pause, shrugging and pulling awkwardly at the sleeves of her jumper. “I don’t think it’s because those experts in poetry [the judging panel] think the poetry in that book is good.”\n\nBut obviously they think it’s good – they would hardly have given you the prize if they didn’t. She shrugs again. “It’s because it has reached a wide audience,” she explains. “It’s because of where the poetry has gone, not for the quality of the writing.”\n\nPart of me wants to tell her to resist that typically female urge to downplay her talent, to give her work a harder sell. But the truth is that anyone who has read the book – even those, like me, who have loved it and pressed it on friends and relations – will know what she means. If “good” poetry is intricately crafted, with delicate layers of meaning, Nobody Told Me is not it. The book is a scrappy, chaotic, heartfelt portrait of new motherhood, from the moment McNish found out she was pregnant (in the toilets at King’s Cross station on her way to Glastonbury) to her daughter turning three. It includes diary entries, poems jotted in the dead of night and during nap-times, breathless musings on breastfeeding, sex after giving birth, and the state of the world.\n\nShe split up with the father of her now seven-year-old child a couple of years ago (she bristles at the term “single mum”, because “that suggests I’m doing it all by myself, which isn’t accurate, and isn’t fair to him. He does more childcare than any other dad I know”). She and her daughter now live in a rented house in a small village just outside Cambridge, the major appeal of which is its relative affordability. “I may be the only non-Conservative in the village,” she jokes. “Let’s just say it’s ripe for a sitcom.”\n\nHer new collection, Plum, is rather more polished, if equally accessible, irreverent and downright rude. Drawing on her childhood and teenage years, the subject matter ranges from getting her first bra to contracting chlamydia. Recent work is interspersed with poems written by her younger self, including a meditation on litter-picking and some very funny – and deadly serious – teenage love poetry. McNish often accompanies the poems with explanatory notes: about one particularly dire teenage series written in French, she writes: “I would say they are some of the worst poems I have ever written.”\n\nMost of us hide our worst ever poems in the bottom of a drawer; why did McNish want to publish them? “Because I wanted the book to be funny. And I wanted to look back at the young person I was. I thought to myself, maybe I can learn from the things I was thinking when I was 15. I was a passionate young teenage girl, and I wanted to celebrate that, even if some of the poems are cringe-worthy.”\n\nThe appeal of McNish’s writing lies precisely in her willingness to let it all hang out. She tackles big topics – the politics of breastfeeding and the family, gender discrimination, sex and birth – humorously and with a total lack of pretension. Her voice is warm and instantly likeable, the experience of reading her poetry often compared to having a conversation with a friend. In the process she has won a dedicated following of a size almost unheard of in the poetry world, with her readings filling 1,000-capacity venues, and videos of her poems often attracting millions of views online (seven million views in the case of “Embarrassed”, her poem about breastfeeding).\n\n“My work is readable,” she says. “It is easy to understand, and for me that’s not at all a bad thing. People often come up to me at gigs and tell me that they didn’t think they could write poetry until they read mine, which always makes me kind of laugh and frown. It’s not really a compliment, is it? Saying that anyone could do what I do.”\n\nMcNish began her career on the spoken word scene, and says that she doesn’t think she would ever have made it as a poet “if I’d just sent my stuff off to traditional poetry publishers. I never would have got in that way.” Lately, however, she has begun to rail against the “spoken word” label that is often attached to her. “It’s not like I’m a performance poet: at my gigs I’m basically reading my poems from the page. I am first and foremost somebody who writes things down. And while I love the spoken word thing because it’s the scene I came from, I’m aware that it can be a bit of a derogatory label.\n\n“Sometimes when I hear myself and other people I know described in that way, I think if you’re going to call that other person a poet you should call me a poet, or [her spoken word colleagues] Sabrina Mahfouz or Raymond Antrobus, because they are just as talented. Most spoken word artists who I work with are hugely into poetry. Raymond, for example, has read everything from the 17th century to the present day. He’s read more poetry than anyone I’ve ever met. There seems to be a thing that who you’re published by determines whether or not you are called a poet.”\n\nI wonder whether this may be partly a matter of class. Spoken-word poetry is a form that is relatively accessible to those from less privileged backgrounds: unlike novels or plays, the material doesn’t take long to produce, and it is possible to earn at least some money from gigging. The scene has links with popular culture – rap and hip-hop – as well as more traditional forms of poetry. Certainly McNish does not come from a particularly privileged background. She was brought up in a village outside Reading, her mother is a nurse and her father was a director of a computer company. She was educated at the local comprehensive, but went on to Cambridge University.\n\nWhile studying for her degree in modern languages she refused to use long words in her essays, and was told by tutors that she had a “state-school mentality”. When she graduated, she funded a master’s in development economics by working in a shop and a nightclub, but then found that without the money to back unpaid internships, she wasn’t able to apply for the jobs she really wanted. She did youth work for a charity, performing poetry gigs on the side, until she was earning enough to give up the day job.\n\nMcNish doesn’t agree that the division between poetry and spoken word is simply about class. “There are plenty of published poets who are from less privileged backgrounds than me. But I do love the democratic nature of the spoken word scene,” she says. “I don’t know any other art form that attracts people of all colours and genders, between the ages of 15 to 80. And you really don’t find the same diversity in ‘poetry’ audiences.”\n\nMainstream publishers, for whom diversity is an ever more urgent concern, are waking up to the potential of spoken word, too, particularly following the success of Tempest. McNish struggled to find a publisher for Nobody Told Me – she went through a year and a half of rejections before finding an editor at Little, Brown – but Plum is published by Picador Poetry, which is also home to Tempest.\n\nMcNish was worried when she got the offer from Picador that they were just “cashing in”, having realised that she had a following and thus commercial potential.\n\n“I kept saying to them: you don’t have to do this. You don’t have to pretend you like my poems. I wondered: do they actually like the work or are they just interested because they know there is a market? But when we started working on the collection I was reassured that they did seem genuinely excited about it.”\n\nDon Paterson, Picador Poetry’s editor, acknowledges that part of McNish’s appeal was her “direct connection with an audience”, but also praises the “disarming honesty of the work; it gives me the kind of feeling you get from recognition comedy. Hollie takes on subjects that we don’t talk about as much as we think we do. People may think it’s easy writing as spontaneously as she does, with no artifice, but it’s really not. It only works because it perfectly suits her personality.”\n\nAnother label McNish is keen to shake off is that of “the next Kate Tempest”. “We both have blond hair and breasts. That is genuinely where the similarities end. We get on really well – she asked me to support her on her tour about two years ago, and I wrote a poem for it called ‘I Am Not Kate Tempest’. The subjects of our poems really aren’t very similar, and our performances are totally different. Kate is an amazing performer. She tried to make me do all these drama school warm-up exercises once, before going on stage. I told her thanks, I’m glad this works for you, but it just makes me feel like a knob.”\n\nThe two do, however, share a love of hip-hop and MC culture, which inflects their work with its rhythms. When I ask McNish about her influences, she mentions 50 Cent and R Kelly in the same breath as Paradise Lost. “Music has been a massive influence, definitely. But I’m not a rapper, and I get really frustrated with the crap lyrics in a lot of hip-hop. It’s like, how can the music be so good, and the words so misogynist and rubbish? It frustrates me.”\n\nWith a publisher and a major prize under her belt, McNish is still getting used to her literary respectability. “I’ve noticed that my gigs are starting to attract a new kind of crowd,” she says. “Before, people were drawn to the poems by the themes – motherhood, immigration, gender.\n\n“I’ve always attracted a lot of mums, and a lot of midwives. It’s only now that I’m starting to get people who are just interested in poetry. That has scared me more than anything, because I’m like: wow, you came here for literature and you’ve got me standing on stage talking about blowjobs.”"
