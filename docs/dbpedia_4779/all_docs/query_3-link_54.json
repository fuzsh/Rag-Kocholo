        "text": "Basel is famous for Nietzsche, 1st Zionist Conference, Museums, but not this missing Bank control? Basel in 1875 was a hotspot for Intelligensia. It had recently had train lines from Austria & Germany completed with a new Station. Trains from France & elsewhere had been coming for years Switzerland was a safe haven for radicals escaping a crackdown on their revolutionary politics, like Pyotr Lavrov fresh from the Paris Commune, Pavel Axelrod who with Lavrov led the Mensheviks. Other dissidents from Russia & elsewhere. Many students too such as a young Sir Arthur Conan Doyle A new Theatre & Opera House was completed in 1875 in Basel for 1600 people. It would have drawn Intellectuals & Society from far & wide. The city was a hive of activity One of the most famous residents in 1875 was the Philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche, who's works were hijacked by Nazi's & supported by Zionists like Chaim Weizman, instrumental in obtaining the Balfour Agreement at the outbreak of WWI for the creation of British Palestine & later 1st President of Israel. Demonstrates how words & ideas can be taken to extremes One of his famous essays from 1875 published many years later was Science and Wisdom in Battle (also known as Philosophy & Truth) a work questioning the use of science for oppressive ideologies, when it should be tempered with the search for truth. It is said to be the inspiration for HG Wells War of the Worlds, part of the challenge of faith at the time whether God exists This was a time when Darwin's, new theories of Evolution - Origin of Species by Means of Natural Selection. One of Nietzsche's contemporaries in Basel was Wilhelm His who was a leader in embryo research, a breakthrough at the time - his concrescence theory & causal-mechanism of development. The later the neuroscience basis of the Amygdala & related system controls missing in ANZ & Basel III https://lnkd.in/gxVkMZ5A His by 1875 had moved to Leipzig University in Germany, where in 1884-86 Pavlov's operant conditioning theory from dogs digestive system research was formed. Sigmund Freud regularly conversed with those in the field at Leipzig. He started his research on the Nervous system in 1876 after His's causal-mechanism theory. Freud later wrote about this Fear control mechanism in the brain, societal fear control These controls important in all organisations for optimal performance, especially Banks including $Bs traders. Appropriate controls throughout to avoid lax control situations i.e. Leeson at Barings, Kerveil at Societe Generale, Finger's team in ANZ @Danny Pearson Ben Carroll @Enver Erdogan MP Anthony Carbines MP Ros Spence Sonya Kilkenny Chris Minns John Pesutto Matt Guy David Southwick MP David Davis Roma Britnell MP Danny O'Brien The Hon.

This is attempted murder in retaliation for their International Torture crimes I have had enough of being persecuted by Zionists Terrorists because they didn't want to do their jobs in ANZ & Government, committed human rights abuses refusing to address controls then persecuted me in retaliation for enforcing my rights. The latest ongoing criminal conduct by LSBC protecting these psychotic criminals & Federal & State Police & every Australian Government shutting me out whilst these murderous criminals do not leave me alone As a result of this ongoing hate filled crimes against me & the relentlessness of this by Jewish criminals I am considering moving to a Muslim country where these abusive criminals can no longer persecute me The UN Special Rapporteur will get my Statement which this Human Rights Criminal Country will not as these Jewish criminal networks continually shut me out & imprison me without right, putting me in a system with no Justice & no voice or discussion only set up with the delusions of psychotic leftwing criminals. The Rapporteur will expect evidence that this Country cannot produce & as you have seen with FOI responses from Police cannot demonstrate any law was upheld by Police & that delusional psychotic criminals who perjure themselves are protected. The seriousness of the external factors in my case have recently been found to be a lot worse, & go to explain why this country has no Rule of Law or human rights This ongoing abuse by human rights Jewish criminals Elana Rubin, Gary Lowenstein, Yoram Finger, Peter Rozen, & others such as Grant Lester, Judy Smith, inter alios has opened my eyes to the abuses by parts of the Jewish community & left, them playing the victim whilst they terrorise people & try to hide. Whilst, as this disclosure has shown, when called upon to address these criminals the broader Jewish community harbour them as do those in Politics, Government including Police who they control. Recent blocking of rightwing ALP, & blocking of communications to Federal enforcement proving no Rule of Law - trapped by fixated abusers, narcissists @Danny Pearson Ben Carroll @Enver Erdogan MP Anthony Carbines MP Ros Spence Sonya Kilkenny Chris Minns John Pesutto Matt Guy David Southwick MP David Davis Roma Britnell MP Danny O'Brien The Hon.

Desi Arnaz is alleged to have said about his wife Lucille Ball \"The only thing Red about Lucy is her hair, & even that isn't legitimate\". Wonder if that can be said about others This comment was in response to allegations Ms Ball was a Communist during the McCarthy show trials, as she'd signed a voter card as a communist. They say she was cleared, I'm not so sure it appears otherwise. This was after all a show trial At the time he was persecuting Soviet communists, in Government & other areas such as show business. However, as I have shown communism was active around the World not linked to the Soviets, there were those spread out from UK, China through their International Liaison Department with elements linked to US & Australia etc well before WWII, others such as Mensheviks led by Pavel Axelrod (Europe, UK, US, Australia) who opposed Bolsheviks & was in exile persecuted like Trotsky by Stalin, & others involved in terrorism etc These trails by McCarthy are show trails, a spectacle. Especially with Hollywood. There the Democrat later turned Republican President of the Screen Actors Guild, Ronald Reagan you know the Celebrity turned President in the 80s (it feels like we're in the 80s right?) defending actors. McCarthy's side kick was Roy Cohn, he later became Donald Trump's lawyer in 80s, you know that other celebrity President People will say oh these Republicans. How about Democrats? I see the same issue in US I see in Australia, Democrats in left setting up right. Take the law changes under President Clinton that led to GFC/Credit Crunch for instance. The 3 Senators basically Democrats posing as Republicans, 2 Democrats before Republicans, 3rd says Republican wrote thesis Locke v Marx, studied Soviets then after decades became Democrat in 2022. Loose credit free flowing capital flows from China, like Japan in 80s, & economy bust when Australia's own Greg Medcraft (ALP) didn't manage Operational Risk in MBS etc I've said before Bolsheviks used Unions to get power then ditched them in USSR. Axelrod with Mensheviks preferred to work through Unions using their networks & the left. He was a privateer in Switzerland he didn't make Billions but a significant amount. He's different to other elements in Unions those that believed they're owed something should get away with stealing, transferring wealth through crimes. GFC didn't do that, poor got poorer as that's what anarchists do - its only about them & their power. They still think they're living in a Dickens novel In summation, Rothschild way good, Commies bad @Danny Pearson Ben Carroll @Enver Erdogan MP Anthony Carbines MP Ros Spence Sonya Kilkenny Chris Minns John Pesutto Matt Guy David Southwick MP David Davis Roma Britnell MP Danny O'Brien The Hon.

Forensicare lack insight as they fall in this Quantum Mechanical cloud, commenting without independent thought or facts on Classical Physics put to them in a direction inexplicably devoid of reality Hellmann-Feynmann theory goes to the Quantum Level to identify the sources of molecular forces on a nuclei that created a Classical Physics result - for example the direction of ball being kicked. Essentially the theory requires at its simplest: information of a ball, time, and what kicked the ball - forces over time relative to the ball. Without seeing the person or persons kicking the ball the Theorem falls over as the forces become invisible That is a simplified explanation, nuclei have many forces over time to create classical physics outcome. Let's say we have the ball's position & direction heading at the siren at game's end, with the soccer pitch & game time known. Then we can identify the source point of molecular forces - kicks Assume you don't know the soccer pitch, therefore can't identify the kickers & where they were. That's what this Jewish criminal cell does - what they do in unions with unions (& in my case outside unions), but they are masters, they know to leave unionists as only sources of molecular forces if they can't disappear. When you know this parameter you identify a field worldwide & pinpoint it all over the place Forensicare lack insight as their own hid, these people hid, evidence was hidden & it was lumped on others to blame, & try to permanently label me Delusional, as the basis of the matters requires them to produce controls that never existed. They thought the evidence I had disappeared, it didn't. Mercy mercy me wherefore art thou source of reports? Another day I'll talk about their abuse control model, punish model. For now think Stasi Zersetzung, SS, mixed with Mao's Cultural Revolution - If you don't do what they want, blame who they want to fit their delusions. This cell do this now in emails, social media etc as I've proven nudging their target, and those around targets. Murders can be ruled suicides, people trapped abused to death with that origin field unknown They can't hide from me, doing it for too many years exposed their field, it was a matter of time when you realise someone is doing it. I was a GRC manager in a Bank. These people think they can pull one over the person who's job it was to tell them in ANZ to comply with these idiots in Government's law In the words of Rage Against the Machine \"No!! I want do what you tell me\" you criminal network @Danny Pearson Ben Carroll @Enver Erdogan MP Anthony Carbines MP Ros Spence Sonya Kilkenny Chris Minns John Pesutto Matt Guy David Southwick MP David Davis Roma Britnell MP Danny O'Brien The Hon. Michael O'Brien MP Jess Wilson MP Jim Chalmers Richard Marles Chris Bowen MP The Hon. Peter Dutton MP Michaelia Cash Libby Mettam Roger Cook Annika Smethurst\n\nCult of Personality theory - think Hitler - is why Elana Rubin & her mates commit human rights atrocities with impunity The term Cult of Personality is a term used in a speech, leaked by Israeli Intelligence, by USSR leader Nikita Khrushev after Stalin's death. The used to describe Stalin's leadership & how USSR would change post his death The Cult of Personality occurs a lot in Communism & can be seen with Karl Marx himself & his daughters notably Eleanor Marx. Her ashes were kept by successive iterations of communist parties in UK for 58 years after her death until 1956 the year this speech was leaked Eleanor Marx was raised with her fathers theories, attended the Paris Commune, dated followers of Marxism. Her father & others like Benjamin Disraeli were Jewish & either did not acknowledge their faith or like Disraeli converted. This was a time when Jewish people did not have rights like they do today, a Jewish person could not be a member of the UK Parliament until years after Disraeli entered Parliament. Jews were oppressed across Europe, living in Ghettos with restricted rights such as Frankfurts Judengasse that Amschel Rothschild building his Banking Empire was able to free all Jews from tge Judengasse, his descendants becoming Barons in UK & Austria Eleanor Marx did embrace Judaism during her life. She committed suicide in 1898 a year after a fellow socialist Emile Durkheim wrote Le Suicide. Eleanor endured a domestic violent relationship, suiciding when jilted. Her sister who helped publish her father's works & inherited everything from Engels also suicided in a pact with her husband in 1911 Cult of Personality creates extreism with such movements pushing people right creating Hitlers, or Stalin's within Communism - he hunted down his own left worldwide Erich Meikle (later head of Stasi) making left feel he killed more in war with Franco than Franco's forces Elana Rubin has a Cult of Personality in this country. An untouchable, as a narcissist racist she cannot allow the truth to be known. Why I am targeted like a Cultural Revolution victim by her network to hide what her, Finger, Lowenstein, Rozen, Lester, Smith, Frank, Day, Borg, inter alios did These people need psychiatric treatment The leftwing accountablility. Lots of people to be arrested. Unfortunately, Australia Rule of Law. It lost its Administrative & Judicial arms of Government to organised crime, & the Political will to hold these criminals accountable Why I am leaving as Australia will bully me to death for their Cult of Personality leader, & listen to their enablers.

Criminal conduct such as that referred to in this article You know this writer as the one behind the Theory of Agency - Directors are Agents of Shareholders, required to act lawfully in interests of shareholders ensure Management do same. The Theory that has enabled criminal control in Australia of companies by Unions as offenders in ASIC such as Warren Day protected organised crime of communist anarchists Back to our Spy agencies do we have a Russian spy in ASIO? His name is Burgess, just like the Mi6 officer that was a spy in the Cold War & defected to Russia. How about Mi6, Richard Moore - Roger Moore - James Bond. CIA - Career Diplomat, former Russian Ambassador. These are mind games of spies to counter organised crime & counter nations Let me explain you see we are in cycles, my Mum used to teach me this as a kid having worked in PR. I saw the cycles, counter cycles, & missing controls. This is part of my Whistleblower Disclosures in ANZ & Government now extended to SEC etc I came across this article this week & its covers some of what I refer to in my disclosures & what I've been eluding to. Mr Mitnick refers to Sherlock Holmes' Illuminati conspiracy which illuminates some light on how con artists such as Mr Mitnick help con artists continue to rip off & manipulate markets. More on Illuminati another day I'll leave you to ponder it for now Mr Mitnick refers to the Rule of Two, the reality is its a Rule of Many designed to create associations in the brain to help the con in future. It's taping parts of the brain that helped us survive such as cats friendly & cuddly like a pat, Lions ate my friend steer clear of Lions. Trump a liar as people like this say so, Democrats holier than though as same person says so This con is exceptionally concerning in the US & other democracies as the networks involved control both candidates no matter the outcome, more another day on that. An outcome, however, through the Rule of Many that they now control the outcome as they've associated parties to thought patterns through cons. Communist anarchists & others in the clique have run a long cyclical con on markets for decades & now can manipulate an election These criminal networks using illegal buy & sell signals controlled boom busts to create a delusion they have of Marxists theory. These people rip off with RICO behaviour millions of people, put people in tents, leave kids homeless, prevent schooling & medical care, people's pensions (probably not Union super in Oz, they're in the know) Which investors make money in a Ponzi?

This case in Chicago Illinois demonstrates a pattern of behaviour, flipped later to always blame the other side in Politics & hide anarchists. I wonder if anarchists saw their own as necessary casualties to ignite their cause? I bet some people wish they could go back in time to 1885 & stop Engels publishing Das Kapital 2. The Communist Manifesto had been written by him & Marx many years earlier, that cat was already out of the bag Chartists can be traced back to England, after the Great Reforms Act 1832 did not give people what they wanted. Benjamin Disraeli supported this type of movement writing in Whig papers around this time after 1825-26 crash, where on his mothers side his family they lost everything after 300 years of Banking in UK - after loose financial controls in a period not related to a war, this time years post Waterloo. As an anti-Whig (Lord Melbourne was a Whig, think Tory, Liberal, Republican) he entered Parliament on such a platform. His prior work Vivian Grey about failing to control a politician an insight into his future. We see attempted murder of Queen Victoria in 1840 & conspiracies of others, Orange Order, Germans, Chartists etc. Its a time to reflect on this in current volatile times as Disraeli helped start State of Israel https://lnkd.in/gBvxDfsa They say arrests & trials in Chicago all Politically motivated - Democratic President Cleveland & his Illinois VP arresting innocent people. We see Spies, Engel, Parson, & Fischer were executed Oscar Neebe sentenced to 15 years others pardoned in 1893 by progressive Democrat State Governor, he introduced OHS laws, who opposed Cleveland Chartists are tied to Eureka Stockade. Driven from UK, others joined up with Engels & Marx in UK disappeared into Commies. We see this all came around in 1955 post World Wars then the Cold War, another critical point in 1985 the Equalizer that brought down the Soviets ending the Cold War. Even in 2015 the history with Cuba relations started again What I find interesting in all cases is what's missing like in mine here, the ones that seem to vanish leave Santamaria, Liberal affiliated Board members holding the bag? May 4th this occured, not May Fourth Movement 1919. May the force be with you thinking this through. What is needed is criminal arrests in Melbourne for those in this network They say that an activist mother-in-law of L. Frank Baum inspired Wizard of Oz from Chicago bombing. The story is different in movies, especially the vaudeville 1927 version, later one has red shoes to take her home not silver, the prequel in 2013 interesting @Danny Pearson Ben Carroll @Enver Erdogan MP Anthony Carbines MP Ros Spence Sonya Kilkenny Chris Minns John Pesutto Matt Guy David Southwick MP David Davis Roma Britnell MP Danny O'Brien The Hon.

It is a vote against an equitable, just and humane society. It is a vote in favour of the personal trauma that the present workers’ compensation system enforces\" Victorian Treasurer, Rob Jolly, 1985 The system in 2010 was inhumane & inflicted personal trauma, Elana Rubin (joined ACTU 85) ran criminal networks, the problem goes to the core of neuroscience - in this case Banking Act controls - APRA & Basel. Rubin's part, controls hijacked in ANZ by terrorists that destroyed the bank's GRC, KAOS in Control Recall Bill Landeryou from recent posts, he instigated a review into Workcover in 1983 after ALP came to power. The \"Cooney Inquiry\" like me recommended a system of private insurers as it creates feedback loops & efficiency gains reducing cost to employers & improves worker outcomes. It stated Victoria couldn't wait for a Federal system Landeryou was removed before the Inquiry was finalised, but he recommended a system like we have. Government ignored advice & chose a corrupt system. This was after all 1st & foremost a system driven by leftie (card carrying commie) Construction Unions This is how we ended up with a system that built a stronghold & training ground for leftwing anarchists to continue applying their trade. The leftwing (commie) Unions were able to penetrate Government & run a Regulator with surveillance capability, great opportunity for commies to shall we say Spy on people with PIs if they chose hiding in Government spend At the same time Bill Kelty was working with Communist (pro Moscow till 68 Czech Invasion) Builders Workers Industrial Union (BWIU) leader Tom McDonald on their Mensheviks use of Unions to weild power with Bolsheviks consolidation of power Superannuation plan - keep Union power as hostages broke free & no longer paid Union dues. Plan to hold WA hostage with PRRT & Terms of Trade deficits to build things for population growth with no economic value add or a sustainable future. A wealth transfer system to landed gentry, poor to rich These people are unaccountable. This report below that explains the background to Workcover by Peter Rozen, confirms his mens rea & intent in criminal offences - no fault claim. No mention here of perjurying criminal Jewish mafia protecting each other, maybe change laws needed as they gaol victims as they're mentally unwell Freudian transferrers aggressively threatening victims with neurotic guilt & silencing victims to protect their narcissistic egos. No mention they'd rather expose Governments to International condemnation than admit what they do Ben Carroll Anthony Carbines MP Ros Spence Sonya Kilkenny Chris Minns John Pesutto Matt Guy David Southwick MP David Davis Roma Britnell MP Danny O'Brien The Hon.

Have you ever noticed how limiting Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs is? It's a Pyramid, the diagram limiting your belief that only some get to Self-Actualisation. Bit like Keltynomics King maker Victoria had another Pyramid, the Pyramid Building Society, that like Tricontinental (another day) collapsed owing $2B. A significant sum in 1990, that was the equivalent of the Victorian Terms of Trade Deficit in 1983, now $84B/yr. Victorians paid 3c per litre to pay non-guaranteed depositors ($900m), took 16 years to payback 51c in $ This another prime example of asset transfer from people who earned it to dodgies. Not the way lefties will argue it, a pattern of their mates anarchy as history revealed shows. Hiding, putting the blame on others This was loose credit mixed with poor management & Government & anarchists in Victoria This society had even bought one that survived 1893 with prudent management since 1867, only to destroy it too. It switched from a Union to a share structure with the original management (later shown to be ALP mates in 03) owning most of the shares. Other shareholders became Time Deposits, gypped by this \"Pyramid\" scheme, placed behind everyone in liquidation. Some Round robin(hood) in this, including loan capital movements. In the end the greater public paid, like they did ALPs 80s debt, and do now $5.5B/yr in interest & in future generations the $188B+ they're raking up for Construction & other mates, hiding behind Bikie gang obfuscation Back to Maslow's Pyramid, its limiting because we can all achieve Self-Actualisation in our own way if we have the basics, a safety net to catch those in need (especially when lefties deliberately blow up the economy - those recessions we have to have, not), a free Neoliberal market, genuine representative democracy, the Rule of Law, Justice, Human rights, No politics in Administrative & Judicial arms of Government just the Rule of Law, proper advice in government (kinda Technocracy but not commie style, people qualified technically in field with broader/generalist upper management). Could be achieved if lefties weren't psych terrorists Instead we have Keltynomics, absolute power corrupts absolutely. Zhou Enlai understood the economic stages as we see in China now, just not what our people want for Democracy. Somehow Keltynomics left us with a bunch of Union & Union mates landed gentry, autocracy, no Rule of Law, no Industry, ever expanding negative Terms of Trade in Vic/NSW, no Science & Technology stage I'm trying to Marshall people with a plan - Build on Better (BOB) Program https://lnkd.in/g8DwqN6d @Danny Pearson Ben Carroll @Enver Erdogan MP Anthony Carbines MP Ros Spence Sonya Kilkenny Chris Minns John Pesutto Matt Guy David Southwick MP David Davis Roma Britnell MP Danny O'Brien The Hon.
