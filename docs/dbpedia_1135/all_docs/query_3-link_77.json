        "text": "\"Pericos & Friends is the result of nearly two years of hard work, during which time we have revisited many of our favorite songs and recreated them, along with some hits by Bob Marley and other legendary reggae artists. We spoiled ourselves and invited artists we revere and some great friends to come and play with us, and each of them added their own magic to our music. Pericos & Friends is an album created with the help of over 50 musicians, recorded in 9 countries and with songs in multiple languages, yet a love for reggae and music in general blended the whole project together. We, Los Pericos, celebrated 25 years of makng music this way\". With such a strong statement, all we can do is examine the result; Pericos & Friends is an album full of life, magic and joy, the pinnacle of an extended career that not only made reggae popular throughout Latin America but also provided an indispensable songbook known and loved by all. Like the best parties, Pericos & Friends is an album chock full of fun from beginning to end. Waiting, Mucha Experiencia, Pupilas Lejanas, Natural Mystic, Runaway, Complicado and Aturdido are all here! Los Pericos are celebrated in 2010 their 25th birthday and they did in style. They have even brought along special guests like Ali Campbell (of UB40), the pioneer Gregory Isaacs, the immortal Wailers, founding father Toots Hibbert (of Toots and the Maytals), the talented Mykal Rose of Black Uhuru and contemporary legends like the Skatalites. They come together along with Latin stars like Cidade negra, Guillermo Boneto of Los Cafres, Juan Manuel Cas√°n of the Spanish group Seguridad Social as well as the Uruguayans of No Te Va Gustar and the Chilean members of Gondwana. Now, for the first time ever, Pericos & Friends is available in Vinyl format. An essential add to your reggae collection."
