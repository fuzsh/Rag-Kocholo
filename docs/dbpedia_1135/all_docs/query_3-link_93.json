        "meta_description": "<p>Mit 21 Jahren schrieb Marcos Valle den Bossa Klassiker „Summer Samba (So Nice)“, der das Lebensgefühl eines jungen Surfers in Rio beschreibt. Dieser Song ist neben „The Girl from Ipanema“ der Bossa Song, den jeder kennt. Walter Wanderley machte den Song 1967 zum Hit, seitdem wurde er hunderte Male gecovered. Marcos wurde 1943 in Rio de Janeiro geboren und begann früh, mit seinem Bruder Paulo Sergio Songs zu schreiben. Im Verlauf seiner Karriere nahm Marcos Valle zahlreiche Alben auf. Stetig entwickelte er sich weiter, widmete sich mal mehr dem Jazz, mal mehr dem Pop oder Funk, aber der Spirit war immer Bossa Nova. Marcos Valle ist zurück und präsentiert ein Meisterstück des modernen Bossa Nova. Er beschwört seinen fast schon orchestralen Sound herauf und mixt ihn mit wunderschönen Melodien und komplexen Harmonien zum perfekten, romantischen Bossa-Pop. Das neue Album bedient sich aus seiner bereits Jahrzehnte dauernder Karriere, in der sich zwischen Pop, Bossa Nova, Psychelic, Jazz und Funk bewegt hat. Valle hat mit Musikern wie Leon Ware, Sarah Vaughan, & Chicago gearbeitet; Jay Z hat seinen Song „Ele E Ela“ für Blueprint 3 gesampelt und Größen wie Frank Sinatra und Bebel Gilberto haben Songs von ihm aufgenommen.

Marcos Valle’s music also caught the attention of the American film director Brad Anderson who used Brazilian music as theme songs in his awarded film Next Stop Wonderland, where two of Valle’s most popular dance floor music “Batucada surgiu” and “Os Grilos” were included. On the other side of the world, in China, “Os Grilos” reached 3rd place on the list of the most played songs in 1998.\n\nWith the show Nova Bossa Nova, Marcos Valle received an award from APCA (Association of Art Critics in São Paulo) as Best Arranger of the Year, and the Brazilian newspaper O Globo referred to his show as being one of the ten Best Shows Of The Year.

The three got together to sing and tell stories of Bossa Nova.\n\nOn September he participated on a big world tour, performing in Portugal, Ireland, Denmark, Japan where he celebrated the local release of Escape (Farout / Rice) and six other albums of his discography: Garra, Mustang Cor de Sangue, Marcos Valle 1970, Previsão do Tempo, Vontade de Rever Você and Samba 68, all of them released on CD by Emi-Toshiba.
