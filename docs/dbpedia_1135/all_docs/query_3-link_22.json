        "text": "General Admission Standing Room with Limited Seating\n\nMusic has been part of Marcelo Falcão's life since a very young age, when he received a guitar from his father. Born in Engenho Novo, a neighborhood in the North Zone of Rio de Janeiro, he even studied classical guitar at the Villa Lobos Institute and flamenco guitar at Casa de Espanha (Rio). It was during this time that he read an advertisement in the newspaper about a band looking for a vocalist.\n\nThis marked the birth of O Rappa, one of the biggest names in the Brazilian music scene, which, over 25 years, has amassed countless hits and numerous awards. With 13 projects released, thousands of performances in Brazil and abroad, and a legion of passionate fans, O Rappa has left an indelible mark.\n\nDuring breaks between O Rappa's albums and tours, Marcelo Falcão led various side projects. This includes Falcão e os Locomotivos, a group formed by friends coming together to make music, and Jet Dub System, a project that creates versions of songs by Jorge Ben Jor, Tim Maia, and Bob Marley, where Falcão goes by the pseudonym Jet. Additionally, he hosts the program Mofaia on FM O Dia, dedicated to his passion for vinyl records.\n\nBeyond music, Marcelo Falcão has ventured into the world of fashion, creating his own clothing brand, Jonny Size, reflecting his lifestyle and sponsoring Brazilian musicians and athletes.\n\nThe album features musicians such as Bino on bass (Cidade Negra), Marcos Suzano on percussion, Hélio Ferinha on keyboards, DJ Negralha on scratches and effects, Felipe Boquinha on drums, and Marcelo Falcão himself on guitar, vocals, and keyboard. The tracks were recorded throughout the year 2018."
