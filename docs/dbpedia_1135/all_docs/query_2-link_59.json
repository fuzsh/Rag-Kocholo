        "text": "I started playing the guitar when I was 9. Growing up in Brazil, I was exposed to a large variety of music genres that helped me create my own identity as an artist. Pop and rock are the main genres I perform, but I am strongly influenced by Brazilian rhythms (samba and bossa nova), electric blues, funk and soul. I had my first paid gig when I was 15 in a wedding anniversary, over 10 years ago. I never stopped since then, having many opportunities to perform in weddings, bars, corporate events and private parties. After moving to Germany in 2017, I noticed a high demand for Brazilian music. I connected with some musicians after performing in an Open Mic and we played in many bars, restaurants and private events, always mixing English songs with Brazilian rhythms. Having moved to London in 2019, I am looking forward to using my experience in South America and Europe to provide high quality music and entertainment and do what I love the most in life."
