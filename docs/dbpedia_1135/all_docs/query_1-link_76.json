        "text": "Forfun\n\nForfun was a Brazilian alternative rock band which reached the peak of its popularity in the mid- to late 2000s. Formed in Rio de Janeiro in 2001, their initial line-up comprised vocalist/guitarist Danilo Cutrim, bassist Vítor Isensee and drummer Bruno Tizé. By 2002, Tizé left the band and was replaced by Nicholas Christ, while Isensee switched his position with Rodrigo Costa to become second guitarist. Their first shows were frequently attended by the sons of then-Deputy (and future President) Jair Bolsonaro, Eduardo and Carlos, who were personal friends of the bandmembers; Eduardo would later cameo in the music video for \"História de Verão\". They released in 2003 the demo album Das Pistas de Skate às Pistas de Dança, which was a significative underground hit, and in 2005 their official debut, Teoria Dinâmica Gastativa, produced by Liminha, came out through Universal Music Group.Following the release of Polisenso (2008) and Alegria Compartilhada (2011), which counted with guest appearances by rapper Black Alien and big band Funk Como Le Gusta, the group reached further proeminence due to their nominations to the MTV Video Music Brazil award in 2006, 2009, 2011 and 2012; in the 2005 edition, they performed a cover of Ultraje a Rigor's \"Nós Vamos Invadir Sua Praia\" alongside Leela, Ramirez and Dibob, with whom they would develop a strong friendship. In 2012 they collaborated on the song \"Rio Porque Tô no Rio\", described as an ode to Rio de Janeiro.In 2007 they collaborated on the eighth album by Santos-based band Charlie Brown Jr., Ritmo, Ritual e Responsa, co-writing and performing on the track \"O Universo a Nosso Favor\". The same year they took part in a show organized by MTV Brasil alongside NX Zero, Fresno, Hateen and Moptop; a live album of the performance would be released soon after. In 2013 they released the DVD Forfun ao Vivo no Circo Voador, recorded at a performance the year prior which counted with guest appearances by their friends from Dibob, Toni Garrido of Cidade Negra and Dead Fish vocalist Rodrigo Lima. Alongside the DVD they also released the extended play Solto, containing three studio tracks recorded as extras. Their final studio album, Nu, came out in 2014. The following year they announced they would be ceasing their activities; Rodrigo Costa would elaborate in a 2019 interview that the major reason of the band's end was that he was veering from their initial \"left-wing ideals\", causing a rift between them. In 2016, Cutrim, Isensee and Christ formed a new project, Braza, and alongside former members of Dibob and Ramirez Costa founded the group Tivoli."
