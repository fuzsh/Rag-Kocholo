        "text": "BRAZILIAN MUSIC PART 6 – 90’s Brazilian Music – The dance of Globalization (translation by Juliana Areias and Sue Burns)\n\nIn the 90’s Brazil and the world were marked by transformations: election and impeachment of Collor, (the first post-dictatorship Brazilian president to be elected by direct vote), followed by the economic “Real Plan” created by his successors Itamar Franco and Fernando Henrique Cardoso; collapse of the Soviet Union, Gulf War, deaths of Princess Diana, Mother Teresa , Ayrton Senna and from the music scene, deaths of : the band Mamonas Assassinas, Cazuza, Renato Russo, Antonio Carlos Jobim and Chico Science.\n\nThe globalization via PCs, CDs, TV and radio programs promoted the expansion of mass culture. Pop stars, Michael Jackson and Madonna, went to Brazil for the first time and the youth enjoyed dancing to the new electronic music – techno, trance and house – in night clubs. Here’s an overview of this period:\n\nMPB ( Brazilian Popular Music) : Marisa Monte, Adriana Calcanhoto, Leila Pinheiro e Rosa Passos stood out as singers and / or songwriters. Djavan innovated with his “funky” guitar groove in songs like “Boa Noite” (Good Night) and “Linha do Equador” (Equator Line). Lulu Santos working with DJ Meme remixed his songs creating dance hits such as “Assim caminha a Humanidade” (So goes Humanity). Ed Motta, following his Uncle Tim Maia’s footsteps, emerged as a Brazilian soul / funk singer. Like begets like, Joao Marcelo Boscoli and Pedro Mariano (Elis Regina’s sons); Simoninha and Max de Castro (Wilson Simonal’s sons ) appeared in the music scene recording an album together “Joao Marcelo Bôscoli & Cia” which included songs by Claudio Zoli and Lenine;\n\nMangue Beat (Pernambuco): This movement was led by Chico Science & Nação Zumbi and Mundo Livre S/A. Mixing “maracatu” rhythm with other contemporary genres, they carved a pathway for other Brazilian north-eastern composers such as Lenine, Chico Cesar, Zeca Baleiro;\n\nAxe Music (Bahia): Its precursors were Geronimo and Luiz Caldas (with Carlinhos Brown at his band) who created the “fricote” style. The great stars of Axe Music were: Daniela Mercury, Carlinhos Brown with Timbalada. Ivete Sangalo with Banda Eva, Araketu, Chiclete com Banana and Olodum – creator of the rhythm “samba reggae” which was recorded by Paul Simon and Michael Jackson.\n\nPop Rock Rap Reggae: Skank, Cidade Negra, O Rappa, Mamonas Assassinas, Patu Fu, Cássia Eller, Zélia Duncan, Jota Quest, Gabriel O Pensador and Fernanda Abreu (former member of Blitz);\n\nPagode (from carioca roots): Fundo de Quintal with Arlindo Cruz, Jorge Aragão, Zeca Pagodinho, Martinho da Vila; Só Pra Contrariar, Exaltassamba, Raça Negra;\n\nLambada(Born in the Amazon Region it reached Bahia to then be released to the world via Paris): Kaoma and Beto Barbosa;\n\nMusica Sertaneja – Brazilian Country Music (from Sao Paulo and the central-west): Duets such as Chitãozinho & Xororó, Zeze di Camargo & Luciano and Leandro & Leonardo;\n\nForró Universitário /Eletronico– Brazilian Pop Folk Music : (Sao Paulo, Ceará and Paraíba): Falamansa, Mastruz with Leite, and Magnificent Cavalo de Pau e Magníficos;\n\nBrega – Cheesy Music (North and Northeast): Falcao, Reginaldo Rossi, Banda Calypso and Tiririca .\n\nFor kids : Xuxa\n\nMany of these artists collaborated creating interesting partnerships, such as the union of Marisa Monte, Carlinhos Brown, Arnaldo Antunes and Nando Reis on the album “Green, yellow, indigo, pink and charcoal,” proving again that it is the diversity of influences that creates the richness and magic of Brazilian music.\n\nRegarding Brazilian Music produced outside of Brazil; the UK band, “Smoke City” was a highlight. Formed by Brazilian singer, Nina Miranda, Mark Brown and Chris Franck, the band created an interesting fusion of acid jazz, trip hop, dub, reggae, folk, samba and bossa. They released their first album in 1997, “Flying Away” and their single “Underwater Love” became a hit across Europe, after being used in a Levi television advertisement “Mermaids”."
