The very first split record ever released in Brazil holds 10 tracks, being divided by the bands: BAMBÚ STATION (Virgen Islands) and SENSIMILLA DUB (Brazil).\n\nThe well-known BAMBÚ STATION, founded in 1996 by Jalani Horton from St. Thomas, Virgen Islands, is already considered one of the greatest exponents of reggae worldwide. For this release, 5 of the tracks that best represent the history of the band have been selected, putting together a compilation of “greatest hits”. The tracks Gunsmoke and One Day have been previously released on the album One Day from 2003 (Mt. Nebo Records), Birds I View is one of the highlights of the album Break The Soil from 2006 (Mt. Nebo Records) and the most recent singles, Leaning On Afreeka and All We Have had the public’s attention since 2012 through the album Children Of Exodus (Griotlife Recordings).\n\nThe Brazilian veterans from SENSIMILLA DUB released 5 new tracks for its half of the split album. The track A Cor Do Sol featuring Eric from the band Mato Seco, followed by the tracks E Deixa O Vento and Homens De Marte that show the musical maturity acquired by the years. Once again showing the results of the mixture of reggae and different genres, the track O Que A Ver Com Isso features artist such as Ras Menor (Rap Roots), Niko Souza and one of the Brazilian punk rock legends, Jão from Ratos de Porão. And closing the record, the track Liberdade Controlada.\n\nAll SENSIMILLA DUB’s tracks (with the exception of Liberdade Controlada, recorded at Spectrum Studios) have been produced, recorded and mixed in São Paulo at Wah Wah Studio by the respected producer Michel Kuaker (which has in his portfolio works of such artists as: Edgard Scandurra, CPM 22, Supla, Lobotomia, and Ratos de Porão).\n\nThe split album has been released and distributed by the São Paulo based record company CRASSO Records and it is available on several streaming media already.\n\nBAMBÚ STATION & SENSIMILLA DUB – Unity"
