        "text": "Brazilian Music\n\nMúsica popular brasileira, habitually shortened to MPB, is the catch-all term Brazilians use for Brazilian music in general. You can trace its history to the 1930s, when the national radio network made it possible for musicians to capture a national audience.\n\nHowever, Brazil is home to many regional musical centres, including the city of Salvador de Baha, with its unique blend of African and Brazilian influences; Recife (home to música nordestina or northeastern music) and eastern Amazonia – home to lambada, while Sao Paulo has a thriving rock and punk scene.\n\nThe Traditional Brazilian Music Styles You Need to Know\n\nSamba\n\nSamba actually originated in Africa as the music of former slaves and African religions, but has become an icon of Brazilian national identity. Much like the blues in America, samba was originally a product of the sorrow of slaves who came to Bahia, a region in northeastern Brazil – ‘samba is the father of pleasure and the son of pain’ according to composer Caetano Veloso.\n\nBut its combination of music and passion transform sorrow into joy. It developed in Brazil in the early 1900s, in Rio’s favelas, with the first recorded version in 1917 ('Pelo Telefone' – ‘By Telephone’).\n\nThe original form of samba is samba de morro (morro meaning hill – it alludes to the slums located on Rio’s hillsides.) Here, the earliest samba style incorporated other music genres in the city, such as the polka, the maxixe, the lundu and the xote, creating a completely unique character.\n\nThere are various sub-genres of samba, which include samba-enredo, which is what the ‘samba schools’ perform at the Rio Carnival. ‘Enredo’ is Portuguese for ‘plot’ – this style is about singing stories.\n\nSamba-choro is a mix of the two genres, while samba-exaltação is the most relaxed type of samba – check out 'Aquarela do Brasil' by Francisco Alves. Partido Alto has the most pronounced African influence.\n\nAs festive dance music, samba plays a huge role in Brazil’s Carnival celebrations – Carnival is a huge party that takes over the streets in the week leading up to Lent. A samba band consists mainly of percussion instruments playing syncopated rhythms and the music features call-and-response and imitation.\n\nThe band leader uses an Apito (a whistle) to signal breaks and calls, with metal drums - Repinique (or the Reps) – leading introductions, played with a wooden stick and one hand; Surdo – the large bass drums which old the beat, snare drums, shakers and agogô (double metal cow bells).\n\nChoro\n\nChoro pre-exists samba and literally means ‘crying, sobbing’, despite the music most often being joyous and celebratory. Its roots are in European salon music and Portuguese fado and it’s mainly instrumental, played with a flute a guitar, a clarinet and a cavaquinho – a miniature guitar introduced by the Portuguese. It’s known by some as ‘the New Orleans jazz of Brazil’ and, like much jazz, is based on improvisation and also for its dizzying speeds, and surprising changes of harmony.\n\nOne of choro’s most important composers was Pixinguinha who, in 1922, was part of the first Brazilian group contracted to play abroad when they travelled to Paris. Choro began to fall out of fashion in the mid-1950s, but underwent a revival in the 1970s and is still being played today.\n\nBossa Nova\n\nBrazilian singer and composer Caetano Veloso said in an interview with the Guardian that, ‘Bossa nova is a sacred music for many Brazilians. It’s political and nationalistic and poetic. It’s a form of high modernist art that somehow became one of the most popular musics on earth’.\n\nVeloso also revealed that it’s a rare example of music becoming popular by being more sophisticated (rather than, like rock ‘n’ roll, stripping out the complexity), as ‘it took the samba and added harmonic sophistication – extended chords and so on – and added a degree of lyrical complexity.’\n\nOne of its key architects was Antônio Carlos Jobim, a classically-trained pianist who helped to fuse elements of jazz with samba to create the bossa nova sound.\n\nThe music emerged at a very specific point in Brazilian cultural history – in a brief period of democracy between the early 1950s and the mid-60s, between two spells of military dictatorship, when industry, education, health and labour rights were all flourishing, as the society left behind its colonial past and looked out at the world.\n\nThe phrase bossa nova literally means ‘new trend’ or ‘new wave’, and it became the music of choice for the emerging smart, young, urban Brazilian middle class.\n\nBossa nova songs differ from samba songs in that their focus is more on the individual and the personal – love, longing and nature – whereas samba usually refers to the public sphere, with themes around carnival and politics. There’s also a difference in that there are no dance steps to accompany it, as there are with samba.\n\nOne of the most famous bossa nova tracks is 'Garota de Ipanema' – aka 'Girl from Ipanema'. The lyrics were written by a famous poet, lyricist, linguist and diplomat, Vinicius de Moraes.\n\nThe Portuguese lyrics are, however, very different from their English translation – the rhythm is displaced and the lyrics become languid, mimicking the movement of the girl passing by. Whereas in English, everything is on the beat. You can hear the difference when you listen to João Gilberto’s version.\n\nThe song, which reached No. 5 in the US pop singles chart in the summer of 1964, sung by João’s wife, Astrud, became a global hit, and bossa nova fever gripped the US, helped by its popularity amongst jazz musicians such as Charlie Byrd, Dizzy Gillespie, and Stan Getz and their fans.\n\nThe Beach Boys, with 'Busy Doin’ Nothin’ 'and The Beatles’ 'And I Love Her' brought in a bossa nova flavour, while Frank Sinatra and Ella Fitzgerald devoted whole albums to covers of bossa nova classics.\n\nMusician Sérgio Mendes thinks the continuing appeal of bossa nova music is because, ‘it’s very sensual, it’s very romantic, and you can also dance to it. Those three components make it very, very beautiful. And it has great melodies – melodies that you can remember.’\n\nTropicália\n\nIn 1964, just as bossa nova was hitting big globally, Brazil’s left-wing government was deposed – replaced by a military regime which resulted in open repression by 1968. Bossa nova’s serenity and sun suddenly seemed out of touch in these darker times and a sound influenced by rock and electric guitars – Tropicália – emerged instead, as part of a wider cultural movement.\n\nLed by Caetano Veloso and Gilberto Gil, the anarchistic, anti-authoritarian music and oblique lyrics of the Tropicalistas made them a target of censorship and repression by the military junta. The pair were eventually arrested and imprisoned and subsequently sought exile in London, where they resumed their musical careers.\n\nThe 1999 compilation, Tropicália Essentials, is a good introduction to the style, featuring songs by Gil, Veloso, Gal Costa and Os Mutantes.\n\nAxé\n\nOriginating in Salvador in the 1980s, Axé fuses Afro-Caribbean genres including marcha, reggae and calypso with Brazilian influences from frevo, forro and carixada. The name comes from a Yoruba term, meaning ‘soul, light, spirit or good vibrations’.\n\nAxé entered the mainstream in 1992, when Daniela Mercury released 'O Canto Da Cidade' – it remained at No. 1 for months and became an anthem for the Brazilian people. Axé’s current biggest star is Ivete Sangalo – check out 'À Vontade' for a flavour of Axé rhythms and style.\n\nBrazilian Pop Music\n\nThe biggest genre in modern Brazilian music is sertanejo. Originating from the Brazilian countryside, it’s played across the country. Although there are some solo singers, many sertanejo artists are duos, often siblings, or duos of two men, such as Henrique and Juliano.\n\nBrazilian Rap\n\nLifestyle site Highsnobiety claims that, ‘Brazilian rap has always felt caught between two worlds, unsure of whether to experiment with music indigenous to the country or follow the trusted pattern of American boom-bap.’ At the moment, trap is a big influence, but there’s still plenty of traditional Brazilian flavour to its rap scene.\n\nThe Best Brazilian Music Artists and the Top 25 Brazilian Tracks You Need on Your Spotify List:\n\n1.
