⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ "Like the best stand-up comedians, Turan Ali’s material has been tried, tested and perfected for an audience. It was a joy to watch." (Broadway Baby)

Turan Ali is an acclaimed stand up and storyteller from the United Kingdom with a very Turkish name and a big mouth. He writes, produces and directs drama and comedy for the BBC, and performs on stage throughout Europe, so you’re in for an evening of high quality, intelligent and provocative comedy.

His material makes sense of having a Turkish Muslim father, an Austrian Catholic mother, growing up in London, going to a Jewish school, and being gay and proud of it. But not all parts of his world cope so well with that pride. In his new solo show, Straight Talking, he shines a light on some of the crazy ways heterosexuals run their lives and relationships. And surprises audiences with many things he claims straights can learn from gays.

The show mixes stand-up comedy, performance poetry, songs and outrageous stories, delivering silliness, surprising confessions and provocative claims, all delivered through straight talking. But, however funny it is, can you handle the truth?
