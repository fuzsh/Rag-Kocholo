        "text": "Once a refuge for those fleeing the Syrian war, Turkey has become a hostile environment for over 3.2 million Syrians who now live in constant fear of deportation, violence, and deadly attacks.\n\n“I fear leaving my house,” says 28-year-old Syrian, Ahmed Rahmani, who lives in Gaziantep, a city close to the Syrian border hosting one of the largest Syrian communities in Turkey.\n\n“I just want to be safe and live without threats. I want everyone to give me and my family a break, but now we may need to leave Turkey and never come back.”\n\nPolitical tensions have recently escalated after Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan said he would engage again in talks with Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, marking a shift in Turkey's stance towards Syria in a potential revaluation of diplomatic strategies amidst ongoing regional conflicts.\n\nHistorically, Turkey has been a staunch opponent of Assad's regime, supporting the opposition military groups and setting up 125 military bases and observation points in northern Syria.\n\nHowever, the announcement suggests a recalibration in Turkish foreign policy, potentially seeking avenues for dialogue that could influence the dynamics of the Syrian conflict and Turkey's broader regional interests — as well as the lives of all Syrian refugees in Turkey.\n\nViolent anti-Syrian riots spread fear\n\nOn June 30, anti-Syrian riots erupted in Kayseri, in Central Anatolia, after Turkish authorities arrested a Syrian man for allegedly sexually abusing a seven-year-old Syrian girl.\n\nOutraged Turkish residents, fuelled by online racist campaigns that have been trending on Turkish social media for months, set fire to Syrian-owned homes and businesses, vandalising vehicles and demanding the expulsion of Syrians from the country.\n\nAmr Atassi, a 34-year-old from Aleppo, left Syria in 2017 and sought refuge in Kayseri, where he obtained a legal document of temporary protection. At 10:30 pm on June 30, Amr's car and shop were destroyed by a mob in the Turan district of Kayseri.\n\n\"They are my neighbours,\" Amr said, recognising some of the Turks who participated in the attack.\n\nHelpless and terrified, he locked his door and held his wife and son close as the assault continued for more than two hours. No police arrived during the attack, only showing up after it ended, Amr explains.\n\nThe following morning, Amr reported the incident to the local police station. But instead of receiving any form of reassurance or protection, he says he was questioned about his legal documents. A policeman advised him against pressing charges, suggesting it might escalate the situation with his neighbours.\n\n“I’ve lost my car, my shop, my job, and any sense of stability and safety,” Amr concluded. He also confirmed he is now planning to leave Turkey as soon as possible, whilst instructing his eight-year-old son to stay indoors and avoid playing outside.\n\nThe violence quickly spread to other provinces across the country, including Hatay, Gaziantep, Konya, Antalya, Kilis, and Bursa, resulting in deadly attacks on Syrians and their properties.\n\n'I feel I am facing a slow death'\n\nIn response to the escalating violence, the Turkish government urged citizens to “act with moderation.”\n\nPresident Erdoğan blamed opposition parties for inciting hatred and racism. Turkish law enforcement increased security measures, detaining 475 people after \"provocative actions were carried out against Syrians in cities across our country,” according to Interior Minister Ali Yerlikaya's post on X.\n\nOn July 5, the number of arrests had risen to 855.\n\nThe arrests were not enough to contain anti-Syrian sentiments. On July 4, 2024, a Telegram group called Ayaklanış Türkiye leaked documents containing the sensitive personal information of over 3.3 million Syrian refugees in Turkey.\n\nThe leak revealed the personal data of Syrians residing in Turkey until 2022 and included information such as residency card photos, full names, parents' names, birth dates, addresses, and residency card numbers.\n\n\"In the leaked data I found my name, address, and personal information,” says Ahmed, a Syrian resident in Gaziantep.\n\nThe day before the leak, Ahmed was stopped and beaten by a group of young Turkish men after they heard him speak Arabic in the street.\n\n\"I was screaming for help, trying to protect my face, but they kept hitting me harder, telling me to shut up,\" Ahmed recounts.\n\n“I am already scared because of the anti-Syrian riots and attacks, and now this [leak] made me fear even staying inside my home,\" he tells The New Arab.\n\n\"All my personal information is public now, I can’t even imagine what kind of threat that could bring. I feel I am facing a slow death.”\n\nAl Moutassim Al Kilani, a Syrian human rights lawyer based in France emphasised the responsibilities of the Turkish government in response to the data breach.\n\n\"The Turkish government must undertake several immediate steps to address this data breach and safeguard the rights of affected individuals,\" said Al Kilani.\n\n\"Firstly, they need to conduct a thorough and transparent investigation into the data leak. It's essential to identify and hold accountable those responsible under Turkish criminal law, particularly laws that penalise the unauthorised disclosure of personal data,\" the lawyer told The New Arab.\n\nThe Turkish police department released a statement on X a few hours after the leak, saying that the social media group was created and managed by a 14-year-old boy and that the Istanbul police Children's Branch Directorate was intervening in the matter.\n\nAl Kilani highlighted the importance of improving data protection measures to prevent future incidents.\n\n\"Enhancing data security is paramount. This includes updating systems and implementing best practices and international standards in information security.\"\n\nThis significant leak exposes Syrian refugees in Turkey to various risks, including identity theft, account hacking, unauthorised financial activities, fraud and extortion.\n\nAdditionally, the leaked information provides a treasure trove of data that could be exploited by the Syrian regime, raising serious concerns about the safety and privacy of Syrian refugees in Turkey.\n\nSyrian backlash\n\nThe leak and week of riots in Turkey sparked a backlash in several areas inside Syria, including Afrin, Ras Al Ain, Al Atareb, Al Ghazawia, Mare’a, Azaz, Jarablus, and Al-Bab.\n\nSyrian protesters removed and burned Turkish flags, replacing them with Syrian Free Army banners. Clashes in Afrin and Jarablous, both locations close to the Turkish border, led to the death of seven protesters during shootouts with Turkish military guards inside Syrian territory.\n\nTo mitigate the spread of protests, the main internet service providers in northwestern Syria, including Vodafone, Turkcell and Turk Telecom, turned off internet connections from July 1.\n\nFurthermore, companies using fibre optic lines had their services disabled, leaving people in the region under a communication blackout.\n\n“We don’t know what to do with this situation. Inflation is increasing and people are struggling more than ever to find jobs,\" Semra Atasoy, a Turkish citizen from Antakya, tells The New Arab.\n\n\"We’ve trusted our politicians to find a solution for refugees, but clearly they have failed at this. I know more and more people who are convinced that Syrians must leave Turkey and should return home, even if it’s not safe,\" Semra added.\n\n\"We have already done more than what we should, other countries should share the refugee’s responsibility.”\n\nAref Alkrez is a Syrian freelance news reporter and researcher"
