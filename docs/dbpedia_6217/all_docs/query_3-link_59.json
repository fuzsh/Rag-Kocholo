        "text": "This study aims to identify and analyze ‘national romanticism’ in Turkey’s political culture during the modernization process. Despite the recognition of modernization (temeddün, civilizing) and modernity (the standards of modern civilizations) as self-declared goals and the adoption of modern concepts, geographic, social, and cultural differences modified the meanings associated with terms like modernity and modern concepts, sometimes erasing crucial nuances. Romanticism went under similar modifications in its Turkish instantiation. Hence, Turkish romanticism has not been identical to the Western European experience: instead, a type of Romanticism developed in Turkey which grows more national the more one goes Eastward and significantly changes and transforms, greatly losing its philosophical depth. In various chapters, I intend to demonstrate that these claims are justified. This study focuses on the concept of ‘Romanticism’ and its political bearings in monographic approach. The chief interest here will be the relation between ‘Romanticism’ and the emergence of ‘national identity’ from the mid-19th century to the Cold War Era, even though, as we shall see, these two notions or evolutionary trends cannot be understood without the context of the other great changes of modern times. A consideration of the relationship between Romanticism and national consciousness suggests from the beginning some issues, or problematic themes, that we need to approach first. In general, the subject of this research revolves around how central and critical a role Romanticism plays in Turkish “belated modernity” and its political culture. As is generally accepted, Romanticism and the Romantics try to re-enchant the world which had become mostly disenchanted through the secularization process with the rise of modernity. Romantic weltanschauung in this regard is an intellectual movement which came out of the cultural, philosophical and political channels of the second half of the 18th and early 19th centuries in European thought, mostly in affiliation with Counter-Enlightenment. Therefore, the study starts by a general framework of the theoretical and historical background of European Romanticism(s), and consists of four more main sections. The first is a general discussion, which aims to characterize the nature of Turkish Romanticism. This chapter also highlights and outlines some critical issues of modern Turkish thought. It also discusses how to classify the historical periods and basic problems of Turkish social-political thought in accordance with Romanticism. The dissertation starts with a general discussion on Romanticism in Turkish thought followed by four main chapters that aims to highlight the four fields in which romantic elements were more dominant in national political culture. While I often cross-reference from chapter to chapter, I preferred to rewind to the main framework at the beginning of each chapter. Each chapter thus first examines the historical and philosophical cradle of the subject in question and points to various reflections and manifestations in different countries and later turns back to Turkey to engage in a historically specific discussion on Turkey. This method is part of the effort to make this study comparative and historical. The first chapter tries to trace Romanticism in Turkish thought and lists the main avenues and characteristics of romanticism in literature, social thought and politics. The chapter tries to answer the question “Can we speak of a Turkish romanticism?” This is probably the most critical and problem based part of the study – hence the section most vulnerable to criticism. To see how a spiritualist discourse keeps reproducing ‘the idea of the nation,’ one must see which references are selected by social consciousness. The second chapter picks up from this question and uses the concept Volksgeist in its title so as to suggest the place of this concept in the narratives of national spirit in literature and history, political discourse and cultural studies. The third chapter focuses on the province as it becomes the object of Romanticism – the search for the sine-i millet (the heart of the nation), the nondrying spring of romantic nationalism, by way of folklore, populism, and villageism. The fourth chapter critically investigates the place of concepts homeland and state, the essential fetish objects of “national romanticism” besides the nation. In doing so, the chapter focuses on the interrelations between Romanticism and the myths of state and homeland. The discussion shows how and why the Romantic perspective makes the state a ‘sublime’ and ‘esteemed’ entity and perceives the homeland to be a ‘holy’ place or a ‘piece of paradise.’ Chapter Five attempts to understand and interpret the questions of romantic historiography and historical romanticism. Here, I argue that literary romantics and romantic historians often supported one another, consciously or unconsciously, and created legends or epic conceptions of history that can rapidly slide into chauvinism. The conclusion includes an extensive repetition and summary of the four main chapters and adds some points on the place of Romanticism in Turkish political culture."
