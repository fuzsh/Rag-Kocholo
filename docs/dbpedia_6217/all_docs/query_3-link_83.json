        "text": "I am a recent graduate of School of Architecture and Design from NJIT. I am currently taking my Architectural Registration exams. I plan to utilize the ARE 4.0 - 5.0 transition in my favor and finish my licensing by Summer 2018.\n\nAs a teenager, I finished high school in 3 shorts years, attended NJIT as an honors student. Apart from academics, I spent my summers interning, even at the early ages during my high school years for companies like Turner and Louis & Berger.\n\nI registered to New York Board of Architects, and began taking my tests for Architectural Licensing in Summer 2016.\n\nI have played soccer since my childhood, and now as an adult, I am climbing the ladder of Coaching licenses in US Soccer Coaching structure. I received my license F in Spring 2016, and License E in Summer 2016. Also through Habitat for Humanity, I volunteered for Rebuilding efforts after devastation of Sandy, and also for low income housing efforts for the underprivileged areas in Newark."
