        "text": "Migration is an important concept that has existed throughout human history. Although migrations throughout history can be described as mobility in its shortest form, they contain important reasons such as war, climatic conditions, industrialization, urbanization, etc. in themselves. Many internal and external factors are involved in the fact that people have to move away from where they were born/live for a better life. The motivation at this point is effective in the conceptualization of migration. Although it is known that there are multiple types of migration in the literature, the migrations experienced as of the last quarter of the 20th century have been effective in determining the common characteristics of migration. It is possible to exemplify and explain this with human rights violations, ethnic conflicts, civil wars and oppressive regimes. Migration has become the subject of research in many disciplines due to its social, political and economic dimensions. This study deals with the phenomenon of migration from an economic perspective. It is known that the socioeconomic dimension of migration differs from country to country. From this point of view, the concept of migration will be analyzed theoretically. Then, a general framework will be drawn by analyzing the statistical data on migration in Turkey, which is one of the transit countries in Middle Eastern migration, with tables."
