        "text": "The rise of Azerbaijan is the continuation of the path left to us by Heydar Aliyev. With his wisdom, political foresight, and perseverance, he played the role of a savior by being with his people in the most difficult days. With the return to power of Heydar Aliyev on June 15, 1993, the independence of our state was preserved and the foreign policy was restructured based on the country's strategic interests. Only Heydar Aliyev could eliminate the very tense political situation around Azerbaijan at that time. With his coming to power, the country saw an upswing and revitalization, and invaluable work was done for the development of the republic. There were great changes in the political and cultural life of our republic. Improvement works were carried out in the country, people who played an important role in our history, literary and artistic figures were highly appreciated, and statues were erected to them. It should be noted that Heydar Aliyev always appreciated the role of Turkey in strengthening and developing the Turkish unity.\n\nAhmed Agayev, better known as Ahmet Ağaoğlu (1869-1939), has been a prominent preacher of Turkism and one of the founding fathers of the so-called Azerbaijani identity, having played also a significant role in the formation of Pan-Turkism. Ağaoğlu's involvement in Pan-Turkist circles in the Ottoman Empire and then in the nationalist movement in Kemalist Turkey partly overshadowed some details of his earlier life. This paper examines one of the lesser-known episodes in his biog-raphy—his participation in the activities of the Iranian revolutionaries in Istanbul and his collaboration with their Persian organ, Sorush (Sorūš) in 1909-1910 in Istan-bul. Ironically, positioning himself in his Persian writings in Sorush as an avid follower of Iranian nationalism, Ağaoğlu began soon to propound in the Ottoman press the idea of \" the Turks of Iran \" , actively promoting Turkism and Pan-Turkist views on the ethnic background of the South Caucasian Muslims and the population of the northwestern areas of Iran. Ahmet Ağaoğlu's writings in Istanbul in 1909 and 1910 shed some light on the genesis of a modern ethnic identity, which was later labelled as \" Azerbaijani \" .\n\nThe article is devoted to the study of the factor of the Azerbaijani Turks in the political and social life of Iran. The focus is on modern concepts of mobilizing the protest activity of this second largest ethnic group in Iran after the Persians. The fact that the Azerbaijani Turks have the ability to quickly mobilize themselves during the events taking place inside Iran increases their importance not only in the internal politics of Iran but also in the Middle East and South Caucasus. However, from time to time, infringement of their interests by the Iranian authorities causes tension and any confrontation that can occur between ethnic groups in Iran can lead to a violation of stability both in this country and in the region as a whole.\n\nThis article examines the roots and development of Azerbaijani identity in Iran. This study aims to demonstrate that the Azerbaijani minority in Iran lacked consciousness of a distinct national identity at the dawn of the twentieth century, and argues that the driving force behind the emergence of the consciousness of Azerbaijani national identity in Iran was the Pahlavi regime’s repressive and exclusivist nationalist policies between 1921 and 1941. Building upon the grievances of the Pahlavi era, the occupation of Iran by Allied forces during the Second World War and the short, Soviet-supported autonomy under the leadership of Sayyed Ja’far Pishevari in 1945–1946 institutionalized and consolidated the Azerbaijani Turkish identity in Iran.\n\nThis study looks at Turkish manuals and textbooks, approved by the Ministry of Education of Turkey and used at different levels of the education system, to compile clues regarding the potent identity questions assumed to exist in the relationship between Turkey and Azerbaijan. Textbooks serve as the main source for this study because the education system is the tool that strengthens the state’s influence over its citizens. A nation-state’s establishment of its own identity is a process that directly builds citizens’ consciousness."
