        "text": "In the newest iteration of our column Current Attractions, where authors from different disciplines discuss a cultural object that relates thematically to our current issue, the curator, writer, and researcher Alper Turan reflects on three deaths which affect him very personally. Drawing on his previous research at the intersection of AIDS and art, he commemorates these disruptions of his own social environment – the İstanbul art scene.\n\nThe art community in İstanbul lost three queer figures in the last year: an artist, Nihat Karataşlı; a patron, Ali B.; and a curator, Stephane Ackermann. These three untimely losses from three generations left me and many around me with a mélange of grief and guilt – the delinquency of becoming, in the words of Hervé Guibert, a friend who cannot save lives. None of these deaths were AIDS-related; yet, citing the artist Félix González-Torres, we all continue to “live and die in AIDS, whether or not we die of AIDS.” Any queer existence that lived through or after the 1980s was born into a world with AIDS, regardless of the passed time or medical progress (you can save our T cells, but who will take care of psyches?). For generations, HIV/AIDS has been shaping the experience of queer bodies, their collective trauma, their fleshy knowledge of living with an end, to die before one’s time. How have they, all of our teachers who died of AIDS, been training us?"
