        "text": "I'm about to complete my 1st month. I researched dozens of doctors and after five or six face-to-face meetings, we decided on Selim. The primary reason is that I saw very few doctors who did a good job on thick-skinned noses, and Selim Hodja was the closest one to me. The price was a little above my budget, but although he had a lot of foreign patients, he gave discounts especially to Turkish patients and said he wanted more Turkish patients. He is a polite and professional doctor who greets you every time and bids you farewell. And most importantly, his style and attitude are very realistic and accurate. Of course, there were minor problems throughout the process, but as a result, my doctor is very good, my nose is beautiful, my breathing is excellent and the examinations and controls so far are being done in detail and meticulously😌\n\nA year ago I decided to have my nose job done by Dr. Having Selim Turan perform it after I became aware of him. The consultation via video chat was extremely professional and the doctor explained the process precisely. After I booked my flight to Turkey, everything went smoothly.The welcome from the assistants and the doctor was warm. This was followed by thorough checks and a detailed discussion of my wishes for the nose correction. The surgery itself went excellently, with no pain or noticeable bruising. This was one of the main reasons I chose Dr. Selim Turan decided.One year after my nose job, I am completely satisfied. The results met my expectations and I am grateful to have found such a competent and compassionate surgeon as Dr Selim Turan. I can Dr. Recommend Selim Turan without reservation. His professional advice, smooth process and excellent results exceeded my expectations. Highly recommended!! 🙂 Greetings from Germany\n\nI had surgery with Mr. Selim about 1.5 months ago. We met with him twice before the surgery. He listened devotedly and answered all my questions. Even though I was very worried, he clearly informed me about the whole process and helped remove the question marks in my mind. Both his assistants and nurses were very supportive throughout the entire process. Even though it has been 1.5 months now, I am very pleased with the result. It was the nose I wanted. I can say that my breathing problems have also been resolved. I was once again sure that I made the right choice. Thank you again to Mr. Selim and his entire team 🙂\n\nI come from Australia and had my rhinoplasty with Dr Selim in October, he was very kind and a caring doctor. I found him through instagram and spoke with his assistant nurses through WhatsApp. Nurse Tugce and Seyma were incredibly lovely and helpful they assisted me through the whole procedure and consultation. They set up a video consultation with Dr Selim he was confident and he reassured me that although I have extremely thick skin and deviation he is confident with my case and that he will be able to deliver the results I wanted. The clinic and hospital was so spacious and extremely clean, and the surgery was a smooth procedure. They had me overnight and the nurses would come as soon as I requested. I highly recommend him he is very skilled and good at what he does. He fixed my nose deviation and reduced the size immensely.\n\nI had surgery at the end of June, we planned everything during the pre-operative period, and everything I would and would not do afterwards was explained in detail. Even though I have a thick-skinned nose, it was exactly what I wanted and I often receive compliments about my nose from people around me. In the post-operative period, only my face was swollen, no bruises, pain etc. You can trust Mr. Selim and his team with your eyes closed. I would like to thank Mr. Selim and his team for their interest and doing their job in the best way possible.\n\nFIRST AND FOREMOST, I want to thank from the bottom of my heart, Dr Selim Turan and the team behind Dr Selim Turan: Seyma, Tugce and the surgical nurses with Dr Selim in operation room for being such an amazing caring genuine souls helping me in my primary Septorhinoplasty journey... always so responsive and there for you whenever you needed (especially coming from all the way from Australia). Thank you Seyma for your endless support from day 1!!! I cannot thank you enough, always there whenever I needed... amazing assistant, god bless. Words can't thank how thankful I am and I am full of gratitude to have done my surgery with this team and Doctor!! I have done my research for SO many years since I was 20 and I'm 27 now, I finally found my doctor that has changed my life positively and made my dreams come true!! I knew he was the one for me as his work on Instagram just shown how perfect, artistic and his attention to detail he truly is. In person, Dr Selim is truly such a beautiful person, shows such passion and pride in his work, calm, patient, understanding, easy-going, caring, very attentive and actively listens to your concerns/ desires. What really stood out to me with Dr Selim is that he wants to bring out your beauty and do his best to make a personalised beautiful nose that will compliment your overall face/features. I trusted Dr Selim from day 1 and he never promised me anything but ensured he will do his best to achieve what I desired, which I loved! Dr Selim Turan achieved what I truly desired and MORE! I am three weeks post op now and I am so obsessed with my new nose as it brings out my features so much and it suits my face. I have received so many compliments already and I'm still healing. Dr Selim is so talented and knowledgeable! Dr Selim I am convinced you have magical hands and god bless you and your team. Dr Selim ,You have made me the happiest girl. My insecurity of my nose is gone and I'm so thankful for you and your beautiful team. So much love! From Susana (Australia) X\n\nI felt very well looked after and advised, the whole team noticeably cares about the well-being of their patients!, all my questions were answered and I could do the surgery with a clear conscience. The operation went very well, almost no swelling, no major limitations or anything else, even in the hospital there are always people around who ensure my well-being. Even after the operation, Dr Turan's assistant is always open to questions, which helps me enormously!. I am currently 3 weeks post op and I am absolutely in love with the results, I am currently still very swollen ofc, but even with swelling I am very happy with the nose, especially the definition in the front profile!!, because I have extremely thick skin and I never dreamed of being able to achieve this definition🥹!, thanks to Dr Turan and the whole team for the great time in Istanbul!:)Greetings from Berlin, Germany\n\nAbsolutely recommended. Both Selim Turan and his assistants are extremely competent. S. Turan took a lot of time and worked with me to create the best possible and, above all, suitable thing for my face and made it even more beautiful. I had hardly any swelling and no pain. For a nose job it was absolutely pleasant. The stay also goes hand in hand with a short vacation and can be combined perfectly.If you have any questions, both he and the assistants are available at any time. The focus here is clearly on the patient and not on the economic advantage. I never had a bad feeling and am incredibly grateful that I came across this doctor. I would warmly recommend the whole team at any time!!\n\nI’m writing with 100% honesty when I say I truly had the most amazing rhinoplasty experience with Dr. Turan and his team! Once I’ve had rhino somewhere else and didnt satisfied at all. I had been unhappy with my profile for as long as I could remember and dreamt of the day I’d be able to change it. I left my consultation feeling confident Dr. Selim Turan was the right choice - no questions or reservations. I was made to feel extremely comfortable, educated on what to expect throughout the process, and felt all my concerns with my appearance were addressed. At 4 week post-op i’m feeling great and love the result! I used to turn away from a mirror or my reflection to avoid seeing my profile and now I can’t stop staring! If you’re considering rhinoplasty, I encourage you to book a consultation with Dr. Turan you won’t be disappointed!😎🙏🏻\n\nMagical Hands! Dr. Selim has magical hands! I searched many different doctors for my nose surgery and finally decided to go with Dr. Selim. In Dec 22, I had my surgery. Firstly, he took my photos and uploaded them to his system. He showed me what he can do. It was software he used and showed me how my nose might be after the surgery. I liked it. The next day I had my surgery.

The thing that particularly attracted me was that he had different noses for everyone. After my surgery I never had a problem everything was on top. And after 10 days when I saw the result I was so shocked because IT LOOKS AMAZING! I‘m so thankfull. I can only recommend him and I need to say Thank you to his beautiful, kind Team. Thank you everyone.\n\nFirst of all, Dr. Selim Bey has a great communication with his patients, and the nurses are so kind and understanding. 🌸 Selim is a great Dr. I never had any questions in my mind, but something went beyond my expectations and I am very happy. Most importantly, I never had any pain during the surgery process, I did not have any painkillers. I didn't use it, there was almost no bruising, I was able to go out, no one even believed that I had a new surgery, nothing was lost from my social life and comfort. First of all, I would like to express my endless gratitude to Selim Bey's team 🥰♥️\n\n3 months after the operation, very satisfied with the result 💕 Salim is an amazing doctor, the attitude is professional and nice, he is always available to answer even after the surgery I had good intuitions about him from the beginning, without too much in-depth inquiry beforehand, I felt very quickly that he could be trusted. He knows how to fit the nose exactly to your face, and for each one he makes a completely different nose, what makes him unique as a surgeon is that he does not do the same thing for everyone and really thinks about what fits each person's face specifically, and what will work best for him in terms of health, which is also important The recovery was beyond what was expected, the hospital is at a high level, the attitude of the coordinator is very professional and she is charming. I recommend Slim, you won't regret it 😊"
