Severe thunderstorms capable of damaging thunderstorm winds and occasional large hail are possible across the Great Lakes region and portions of the Midwest through tonight. ...Great Lakes/Midwest/Central Plains... A rather complex mesoscale scenario exists particularly across the Great Lakes region, influenced by multiple MCSs/outflows since last evening. Multiple MCVs are apparent across the region including western Upper Michigan, potentially including an MCV with evolving asymmetric quasi-linear convection across east-central Wisconsin late this morning. Within a zone of pre-frontal confluence/augmented outflow, MCS persistence and further upscale/southward peripheral growth is possible into Lower Michigan/northern Illinois into a very unstable air mass, but this is far from certain. For additional short-term information, see Mesoscale Discussion 2013. Where storm clusters do develop and intensify regionally, ample buoyancy, particularly south of the aforementioned late-morning MCS, and sufficient deep-layer shear will support damaging wind and isolated large hail potential. The severe threat could reach as far as the Lake Ontario vicinity late tonight/early Wednesday. Farther southwest, nearer to the cold front and potentially augmented by residual outflow, CAPE and especially vertical shear will be weaker from southeast Iowa/western Illinois into northern Missouri and eastern Kansas/southeast Nebraska. A few organized multicells are possible atop a strongly heated boundary layer, with strong wind gusts and severe hail possible. ..Guyer/Wendt.. 08/27/2024 CLICK TO GET WUUS01 PTSDY1 PRODUCT NOTE: THE NEXT DAY 1 OUTLOOK IS SCHEDULED BY 2000Z"
