        "text": "Dry Wells is a tribal camp located south along the Colorado River from Cottonwood Cove in Arizona in Fallout: New Vegas. It is currently occupied by Caesar's Legion. It will only be accessible to the Courier after completing the Fallout: New Vegas add-on Lonesome Road, by aiming nuclear weapons at Legion territory; and can only be reached by the boat in Cottonwood Cove.\n\nBackground\n\nTaken from their home, the Twisted Hairs tribe was destroyed here after Vulpes Inculta betrayed them, subsequently assimilating them into Caesar's Legion and crucifying those who resisted.[1][2][3]\n\nLayout\n\nDry Wells consists of several burned tents and crumbling buildings along a road from an irradiated stretch of the river, ending in a large crater. Attempting to enter the crater will cause instant death. Just south of the boat the Courier arrives in are a couple of crates behind an overturned boat with random loot. Several burned tents are also scattered about the area, along with numerous ammunition boxes and weapons crates. The entire camp is filled with Irradiated Legionary Prime, Irradiated Legionary Veteran and Irradiated Legion Explorers, along with their Centurion, Gaius Magnus.\n\nLoot\n\nArmor of the 87th Tribe - Worn by Gaius Magnus.\n\nRed Victory Grenade Rifle - Overlooking the western side of camp, there is a tower that is broken but still standing. On a cliff beside it is a burnt tent. Beneath the frame of the tent is a gun case, in which the weapon can be found.\n\n\"Missing\" shipment - In the same gun case as the Red Victory grenade rifle.\n\nTwo Lead-Lined Metal Boxes at the same burned tent as described above. They are guaranteed to hold Med-X, Stimpaks, RadAway and an issue of either Lad's Life or Today's Physician.\n\nRandom advanced armor (Combat Armor, Reinforced Mark 2, T-45 or T-51 power armor) - Located inside a Metal Box on a ledge, south-southeast of the crater. The ledge can be accessed by traversing a concrete slab, which leans onto it. Alongside the box are two Emergency Kits and four Ammunition Boxes.\n\nThree High-tech Gun Cases - One is in the first destroyed house encountered on the left (west) side of the road after entering the camp, surrounded by four ammo boxes. The other two are in the rubble of a destroyed building near the northwest corner of the camp, next to a Military Shipping Crate containing random ammunition (including potential Mini Nukes), Weapon Mods and Weapon Repair Kits, as well as four additional Ammunition Boxes.\n\nNotes\n\nUnlike nearly every other location introduced through add-ons, companions can travel to Dry Wells and the Long 15 due to Dry Wells being inside the Mojave, rather than an entirely new area (i.e. Big MT and Zion National Park).\n\nSome Legion explorers may be using Stealth Boys upon entering the area.\n\nDue to the high level of radiation, irradiated legionaries regenerate health very quickly.\n\nKilling any irradiated Legion troops will yield Legion infamy. This makes it difficult to obtain the Armor of the 87th Tribe while remaining on good terms with the Legion.\n\nApproaching the edge of the blast crater (the far end of the site when fast traveling there) will result in a radiation level of up to 35 rads/sec, as opposed to 20/sec max in the Long 15. Jumping into the crater in either location will result in a massive spike in this rate. Additionally, the amount of radiation increases exponentially as the player character approaches the crater in Dry Wells, as opposed to a more linear increase in the Long 15. This reaches approximately 322 rads/sec in the dead center of the crater, fatal almost immediately without any protection.\n\nTrying to swim upstream will bring up the message, \"You can't swim any further in this direction\" and the player character will hit an invisible wall.\n\nIf he is still alive, meeting Ulysses after visiting Dry Wells will bring up new dialogue options.\n\nBehind the scenes\n\nA black outline of a person who was vaporized by the blast can be found on the building facing the crater. These imprints happen in the real world and are called \"nuclear shadows,\" caused by the intense heat of an atomic blast. The blast changes the colors of surfaces like steps, walls, and pavement. When people or items block this light, their outline is left on the surface behind them. In the real world, the impression on the wall would be the opposite of that seen in-game, with the dark area consisting of the individual and wall or surface appearing lighter, akin to a real shadow.\n\nAppearances\n\nDry Wells appears only in the Fallout: New Vegas add-on Lonesome Road.\n\nGallery\n\nMap of Dry Wells\n\nDry Wells in an endings slide\n\nBurned body outline by a nuclear blast\n\nHigh-tech Gun Case with high tier loot near the docks\n\nTwo more high-tech gun cases near ground zero\n\nGaius Magnus awaits"
