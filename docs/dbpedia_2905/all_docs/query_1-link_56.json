It is one of the largest lakes in Missouri with 55,000 miles of waterways. The lake came into existence 75 years ago through an undertaking known as the Great Osage River Project. Union Electric, now Ameren UE, began construction on the dam on August 6th, 1929. In the midst of the Great Depression, some 4,600 employees labored day and night to build Bagnell Dam and what was, at the time, the largest man-made lake in the world. It was opened to the public on May 30, 1931.\n\nSurrounded by expansive forests and rolling hills, enhanced by dramatic bluffs, the lake boasts more than 1,150 miles of meandering shoreline. Fed by the Osage River, the Big and Little Nianguas and the Glaize River, it maintains a beautiful home for the great blue heron, many species of fish, waterfowl and animals from white tail to chipmunks.\n\nFun for family and friends includes indoor and outdoor water parks, amusement parks, miniature golf, go-carts, air excursions, boat rides, boat races, horseback riding, bowling, toe-tapping' fun country music shows, festivals, fireworks, museums, and tours of local caves.\n\nAlthough the lake offers some of Missouri's finest recreational and sight-seeing opportunities above the water, it's what's underneath that counts with anglers. And it counts with large-mouth bass, crappie, white bass, stripers and catfish. When one species isn't cooperating, relax — another will!\n\nCovering 1,150 shore miles and 92 square miles of water, the lake offers one of the best scenic panoramas in the state and a range of leisure and water activities that will excite and enchant any visitor."
