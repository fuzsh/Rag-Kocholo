According to Wyeth, “The pump in the Olsons’ pantry drew water from a cistern below the floor. Rainwater pouring off the high roofs above was fed by troughs and downspouts into this cistern. For weeks on end no rain fell. Alvaro put a big barrel on a drag, towed it to the spring in the pasture, covered the barrel full of water with a canvas and hauled it back to the house. This was their well the summer of the drought” (as quoted in Andrew Wyeth, Meriden, Connecticut, 1970, p. 185)."
