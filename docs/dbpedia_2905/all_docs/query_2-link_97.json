        "text": "From the Upper Dry Fork trailhead, follow the marked trail as it heads across the open desert north. It comes to a junction with the rim return trail just before reaching Dry Fork. Continue into Dry Fork and follow it down canyon. Narrows are reached about 0.8 miles from the trailhead.\n\nContinue down through the narrows. Peek-a-boo Canyon comes in on the left about 1.6 miles from the trailhead. This is just after the Dry Fork narrows open, and a side canyon comes in on the right.\n\nPeek-a-boo Canyon:\n\nAbout 4 minutes down the canyon from the side canyon on the right is Peek-a-boo on the left. A 6 m up-climb guards the entrance to Peek-a-boo. The climb has carved steps, but is still a little tricky. A short rope for a hand-line may be useful for beginners. This up climb is the biggest obstacle of the hike.\n\nOnce in Peek-a-boo, enjoy the many arches and narrows. What a gem! Continue up the canyon until the canyon opens into a wide open wash. Here a cairned trail takes off on the right. Follow this trail about 10 minutes over the open country to where it drops into Spooky, a large open wash at this point.\n\nSpooky Canyon:\n\nHead down Spooky! It gets deep and dark quickly. Several spots are narrow enough you have to turn sideways. Spooky is a fantastic canyon, and a lot of fun to descend. A couple of minor down climbs occur in the upper section, but if you look around, an easy path over or under the obstacle can be found. Once Spooky opens up, follow it down to its junction with Dry Fork in about 5 minutes.\n\nBrimstone Canyon:\n\nLast on the list is Brimstone. From the junction of Spooky and Dry Fork, hike down Dry Fork to the first major canyon coming in on the left. This section can change with each flood, but is usually an easy walk.\n\nAbout 30 minutes down from Spooky Canyon, a wide side canyon comes in on the left with impressive sand slides on the west side. This canyon is Brimstone. Hike up the wide wash 10-15 minutes to where it suddenly narrows to an incredibly deep and dark slot. Work your way up as far as you comfortably can, but be careful, at least one person has gotten stuck in Brimstone. Return up Dry Fork to Peek-a-boo.\n\nI recommend taking the rim trail return, which goes up the side canyon 4 minutes west of Peek-a-boo that comes in on the left (lookup up Dry Fork). Follow this trail up to a junction, then go right at the junction to head back to the Upper Dry Fork trail you started on. It is well-worn and easy to follow."
