        "text": "A biome is a region in a world with distinct geographical features, flora, temperatures, humidities, and sky, water, fog, grass and foliage colors. Biomes separate every generated world into different environments, such as forests, deserts and taigas.\n\nThe biome of a location is determined during world generation and by the current environment. If the player completely changes all the blocks in a large area to imitate the terrain of other biomes, every biome will be affected. This can be accelerated in Java Edition with the /fillbiome command, which can change the biome in an area.\n\nBiomes can be located using the /locate biome command.\n\nList of biomes[]\n\nBiome types[]\n\nIn Java Edition, there are 64 different biome types: 53 for the Overworld, 5 for the Nether, and 5 for the End, plus one used only for a superflat preset. In Bedrock Edition there are 86 biome types: 53 for the Overworld, 5 for the Nether, 1 for the End, and 27 unused.\n\nOn this page, for convenience of description and reading, the biomes in Overworld are divided into 8 categories, which are not official. While in each category, biomes may be further divided into some sub-categories. Biomes in a sub-categories are placed in one page, such as plains and sunflower plains, and are described as variants on this wiki.\n\nOverworld[]\n\nOffland biomes[]\n\nThese biomes are used for the generation of oceans and mushroom fields. They are large, open biomes made entirely of water going up to y=63, with underwater relief on the sea floor, such as small mountains and plains, usually including gravel. Squid and fish spawn frequently in the water.\n\nThese biomes are further divided into three categories: Oceans, Deep Oceans, and Mushroom Fields.\n\nHighland biomes[]\n\nHighland biomes are biomes with high Y-level, rugged terrain, and snow-covered peaks appear above the snow line.\n\nThese biomes are further divided into two categories: Mountains and Windswept Hills.\n\nWoodland biomes[]\n\nWoodland biomes are rich in plants, with trees, flowers and grasses constituting the flora on the surface. It is one of the ideal birthplaces where plenty of wood resources are available, but the dense vegetation makes it dangerous to move around the forest at night because the trees block the view.\n\nThese biomes are further divided into 7 categories: Forests, Taiga, Old Growth Taigas, Snowy Taiga, Birch Forests, Dark Forest, and Jungles.\n\nWetland biomes[]\n\nWetland biomes contains rivers, swamps and beaches. They have a large amount of water resources. Rivers separate other biomes; beaches generate as a transition between the ocean and land.\n\nFlatland biomes[]\n\nThese biomes have a flat terrain and a wide view. Trees spawn less here, while lakes are more common here.\n\nThese biomes are further divided into two categories: Plains and Snowy Plains.\n\nArid-land biomes[]\n\nIn these biomes, it neither rains nor snows at all, but the sky still turns overcast during inclement weather. The surface is covered with sparse vegetation.\n\nThese biomes are further divided into three categories: Deserts, Savannas, and Badlands.\n\nCave biomes[]\n\nThese biomes generates inside caves in the Overworld. They're mostly found underground but can sometimes leak out of cave entrances.\n\nVoid biomes[]\n\nThe Nether[]\n\nThe Nether is considered a different dimension. It is a hellish place; all biomes in this dimension are dry and it is not possible to place water in these biomes; ice can still be placed, though it does not turn into water upon melting.\n\nThe End[]\n\nThe End is considered a different dimension.\n\nUnused biomes[]\n\nMain article: Unused features\n\nMain article: Biome/Before 1.18\n\nThese biomes don't generate in default worlds. They have been completely removed from the game in Java Edition.\n\nBiome name Features Description Screenshot\n\nLegacy Frozen Ocean\n\nPolar Bears, Salmon, Cod, Strays, Cold underwater ruins, Gravel, Seagrass, kelp, Snowy Rabbits, Ice, shipwrecks\n\nSimilar to the Frozen Ocean biome, but without icebergs, it is completely flat. Because they are a Frozen Ocean variant, they can spawn polar bears and strays, but not dolphins. Unlike the regular frozen ocean, polar bears, drowned, squid, salmon, cod, rabbits, skeletons, and strays are the only mobs that spawn here. Kelp also generates here. This biome doesn't generate naturally from Pocket Edition Alpha 0.9.0 onward. When Bedrock Edition 1.4.0 introduced the new frozen ocean, this biome was not removed or replaced by the new frozen ocean, although the id name changed from frozen_ocean to legacy_frozen_ocean.\n\nDesert Lakes\n\nSand, Cacti, Water, Sugar Canes, Gold Rabbits, Desert well, Fossils, Husk\n\nIn this biome, patches of water are more common, and the terrain is slightly more rough. Although desert wells can be found, desert pyramids, villages, and outposts do not generate in this biome.\n\nMountain Edge\n\nGrass, Dirt, Stone, Llamas, Emerald ore, Infested stone, Spruce trees, Oak trees, Snow\n\nSimilar to the sparse jungle biome, the mountain edge used to generate exclusively at the edge of windswept hills biomes in order to smooth the transition between biomes. This biome has lots of trees, similar to windswept forests. While the terrain is lower and gentler in nature, some areas may reach high enough to be covered by snow. This biome doesn't generate naturally from Pocket Edition v0.9.0 alpha and Java Edition 1.7.2 onward.\n\nDeep Warm Ocean\n\nDolphins, Pufferfish, Tropical fishes, Warm underwater ruins, Sand, Seagrass, Ocean monuments, Guardians, Elder guardians, shipwrecks\n\nSimilar to the Warm Ocean biome, but without coral reefs or sea pickles, and twice as deep. Because they are a deep ocean variant, they can generate ocean monuments, resulting in the spawning of guardians, elder guardians, prismarine, and sponges.\n\nHills Hills are generated within certain biomes (including some of their variants) and are referred in the F3 menu with Hills added to their name (except Snowy Mountains).\n\nThis includes: Wooded Hills, Taiga Hills, Snowy Taiga Hills, Jungle Hills, Desert Hills, Birch Forest Hills, Tall Birch Hills, Giant Tree Taiga Hills, Giant Spruce Taiga Hills, Snowy Mountains, and Bamboo Jungle Hills.\n\nMost hills are gentle rolling slopes on which the usual biome terrain generates, with some sharper cliffs here and there. Snowy Mountains have a lower chance of spawning passive mobs during world generation than other biomes (7% versus 10%).\n\nGiant Spruce Taiga Hills are a special case. In Java Edition, the game code sets the values setBaseHeight and setHeightVariation to define a \"hilly\" biome, but uses the same values as for its non-hill variant (giant spruce taiga), meaning there is absolutely no terrain difference between the two biomes. In Bedrock Edition, this biome generates as a hillier version of the giant spruce taiga, but uses the same trees as the giant tree taiga hills (with leaves only at the top), resulting in the differences between these biomes being non-terrain aspects like water color and temperature.\n\nBadlands Plateau Badlands plateaus generate as actual biomes within Badlands biomes, and are flattened at the top, much like real-life plateaus. They come to rest at an elevation of about 20 to 30 blocks above sea level. One may discover the entrance to a mineshaft within the tall slopes of a Badlands Plateau.\n\nModified Plateaus Two rare variants of the plateau biomes, which are variants themselves. However, neither of these biomes closely resemble their counterparts.\n\nCompared to the average Badlands Plateau, the Modified Badlands Plateau features more variable terrain and smaller plateaus, as if a larger plateau was weathered down over time. It is the second-rarest biome in the game, after the Modified Jungle Edge.\n\nThe terrain of the Shattered Savanna Plateau biome is much less tame than its normal counterpart. It features incredibly large and steep mountains that jut out of the terrain, similar to the Shattered Savanna biome, albeit slightly smaller and gentler in comparison. In Bedrock Edition, shattered savanna plateaus are considered a temperate/lush biome, making foliage a vibrant green color and allowing rain to occur in them.[2]\n\nModified Wooded Badlands Plateau\n\nOak trees, Dead Bushes, Coarse Dirt, Dirt, Terracotta\n\nThis biome features grass and oak trees on top of plateaus, much like its counterpart. However, the plateaus that generate here are generally smaller, allowing far less foliage to generate. The terrain is more erratic, and can be compared to that of the similar Modified Badlands Plateau biome, having an old and eroded appearance. Eroded badlands generate instead of desert alongside this biome.\n\nMushroom Field Shore\n\nMushrooms, Huge Mushrooms, Mycelium, Mooshrooms, Buried Treasure, Shipwreck\n\nMushroom Field Shores represent the transition between mushroom fields and the ocean, forming long strips between the biomes as a \"beach\", hence the name. However, it does not generate if the ocean biome is a Deep Ocean. This biome also generates when a river meets a Mushroom Fields biome, similar to what Frozen Rivers do in Snowy Plains. The terrain of this biome is much more flat and shallow than the main Mushroom Fields biome, though it contains many of the same features, such as a mycelium surface layer, huge mushrooms, and lack of hostile mobs, but shipwrecks and buried treasure can generate here.\n\nRemoved biomes[]\n\nThese biomes no longer exist in current versions of the game.\n\nBiome name Features Description Screenshot\n\nTundra\n\nSnow, Grass Block, Ice\n\nSnowy, barren terrain with few trees. The occasional trees do exist, although rarely. Ice can be found over water. Snow is common weather in tundras. It generates when the temperature is below 50% and the downfall is less than 20%.\n\nRain Forest\n\nGrass Block, Grass, Oak trees, Birch trees\n\nRainforests are wet biomes with many trees, which have a 1 in 3 chance of being big, instead of 1 in 10 like all other biomes. They generate only oak trees and have a large amount of tall grass and ferns. A biome is classified as a rainforest if the temperature is greater than 97% and the downfall is more than 90%. This could be the biome with some of the most cliffs and hills because the world generator reduces height variation at lower downfalls.\n\nSeasonal Forest\n\nGrass Block, Grass, Oak trees\n\nSeasonal Forests spawn with a temperature of 97% or greater, and a downfall value between 45% and 90%. They are commonly found between forest and rain forests, and near plains biomes. They are identical to forests, except they have fewer trees and can spawn only oak trees. They have a little bit of tall grass.\n\nIce Desert\n\nSand, Snow, Ices\n\nAn unused biome before Beta 1.8 that was in the code but never implemented into the temperature/downfall table and thus did not actually generate. It was a biome of sand with snow on top of it and had snowfall and ice (the player can create something similar using the buffet world option and choosing the snowy beach biome).\n\nShrubland\n\nGrass Block, Oak trees, Birch trees\n\nA biome with few trees and no tall grass. It is identical to the savanna biome. It is one of the smallest biomes in the game. It can generate if the temperature is between 50% and 97%, and the downfall value is below 35%. It is too small to generate a forest.\n\nJoke biomes[]\n\nThese biomes can only appear in joke snapshots of the game.\n\nBiome name Features Description Screenshot\n\n_generated:id\n\nBetween End Ships Grid of End Ships. Generates in the fleet dimension. There is no elytra as loot. Chests generate, but contain only a book titled \"orders\"\n\nBiome For Player With No Time For Nonsense Generates as Snowy Taiga, but all ores are mineral blocks or redstone components\n\nThe Moon Moon Cow, Lunar Base, Cheese Generates flat terrain with craters. The only mob that spawns here is the moon cow. There is also the Lunar Base, the only feature in the moon.\n\nShapes Terracotta, Glazed Terracotta, Concrete, Concrete Powder, Wool, Carpet, Stained Glass, Stained Glass Pane Generates Spheres, Cubes, Ocathedra, etc. of various colors and materials\n\nTint[]\n\nPlants[]\n\nBiome grass and foliage colors are selected from two 256×256 colormap images: grass.png and foliage.png under assets/minecraft/textures/colormap‌[JE only] or textures/colormap‌[BE only]. The grass.png colormap sets the colors for grass block, ferns in flower pots, grass, tall grass, sugar canes, stems of pink petals. Meanwhile, the foliage.png colormap sets the colors for vines and tree leaves of oak, jungle, acacia, dark oak, and mangrove. Only the colors in the lower-left halfs of both images are used, even though the upper-right side of foliage.png is colored.\n\ngrass.png\n\nfoliage.png\n\nThe adjusted temperature and adjusted downfall values (recognized as AdjTemp and AdjDownfall in the following, respectively) are used when determining the biome color to select from the colormap. They are computed as follows:\n\nAdjTemp = clamp( Temperature, 0.0, 1.0 )\n\nAdjDownfall = clamp( Downfall, 0.0, 1.0 ) * AdjTemp.\n\n\"clamp\" limits the range of the temperature and downfall to 0.0—1.0. The clamped downfall value is then multiplied by the adjusted temperature value, bringing its value to be inside the lower left triangle. Treating the bottom-right corner of the colormap as AdjTemp = 0.0 and AdjDownfall = 0.0, the adjusted temperature increases to 1.0 along the X-axis, and the adjusted downfall increases to 1.0 along the Y-axis.\n\nSpecial plant tints[]\n\nIn the following cases, the plants are not tinted exactly according to the colormap. In Java Edition, severals of them are specified in biome Jsons in vanilla data pack.\n\nSwamps\n\nIn Swamp and Mangrove Swamp, the color for grass blocks, ferns in flower pots, grass, sugar canes, and the stems of pink petals is based on a noise on XZ plane. When the value of this noise is less than -0.1, it uses the color #4c763c. Otherwise using #6a7039. The color for vines and leaves of oaks, jungles, acacias, dark oaks and mangroves is #6a7039 in Swamp and #8db127 in Mangrove Swamp, which are not affected by the colormap.\n\nDark Forest\n\nIn Dark Forest, the color for grass blocks, ferns in flower pots, grass, sugar canes, and the stems of pink petals is the result of the bitwise AND between the color in the colormap and #fefefe, and then averaging with #28340a. In vanilla, that is #507a32.\n\nBadlands\n\nIn Badland, Wooded Badland, and Erosion Badland, the color for grass blocks, ferns in flower pots, grass, sugar canes, and the stems of pink petals is #90814d. The color for vines and leaves of oaks, jungles, acacias, dark oaks and mangroves is #9e814d. Both are not affected by the colormap.\n\nCherry Grove\n\nThe color for plants in the Cherry Grove is always #b6db61, which is not affected by the colormap.\n\nOther leaves\n\nThe color for spruce leaves is #619961 and the color for birch leaves is #80a755. Both are not affected by the biome.\n\nEnvironment[]\n\nThe color of the sky in Overworld changes according to the basic temperature value of the biome. The basic temperature is first modified as T = clamp( Temperature / 3 , -1.0, 1.0 ). Then the triple ( 0.62222224 − 0.05 T , 0.5 + 0.1 T , 1 ) {\\displaystyle (0.62222224-0.05T, 0.5+0.1T, 1)} is the sky color.\n\nIn addition, the colors of water, underwater fog and fog in a biome are defined in the vanilla data pack‌[JE only] or vanilla resource packs‌[BE only].\n\nSee the List of biome climates for these colors.\n\nTransition[]\n\nWhen plants or water are at the borders between or among biomes, the color is affected by the biome of the surrounding blocks at the same Y-level. The range of the block involved in the calculation is determined by the biome blend radius in options. Takes the plant color or water color of the biomes within a square centered on this block and with the side length being the biome blend radius, and calculates their average value to get the final color for this block.\n\nThe sky color ‌[JE only] and the fog color use the color processed by Gaussian blur from colors of the biomes at each block in the range of 5×5×5 centered on the block the camera is in.\n\nClimate[]\n\nA biome has three climate attributes: temperature, downfall, and precipitation.\n\nTemperature[]\n\nEach biome has a base temperature value (see the List of biome climates), but the actual temperature value at each location in the biome is also affected by the height of the location. Locations with Y≤80 use the base temperature as actual temperature. At Y=81, the actual temperature value randomly fluctuates up and down by -0.00875 — +0.01125 from the base temperature based on a noise on the XZ plane, and at Y≥81 the actual temperature decreases by 0.00125 (1⁄800) every block up.\n\nIn Java Edition, specially, in Frozen Ocean and Deep Frozen Ocean, it is also affected by another noise on XZ plane. In some regions according to the noise, the base temperature value is always regarded as 0.2. The actual temperature values for these regions are also calculated on this basis. This is detectable in Frozen Ocean, as its base temperature is low enough to freeze or snow, so that only these regions do not freeze or snow at sea level.\n\nDownfall[]\n\nThe downfall value is a number between 0.0 and 1.0 (see the List of biome climates). When the downfall value is greater than 0.85, the biome is marked as humid, which is related only to the random extinction of fire. This value doesn't affect the weather.\n\nPrecipitation[]\n\nThe precipitation value can be \"true\" or \"false\". If the precipitation of the biome is false, no rain or snow occur. Otherwise, a location is rainable when its temperature value is greater than 0.15, and snowable otherwise.\n\nSo, if the base temperature is not greater than 0.15, it's snowable at any Y level. And if greater than 0.15, it can snow above a certain Y level, which are listed below:\n\nBiomes Minimum height for snowfall Windswept Hills\n\nWindswept Gravelly Hills\n\nWindswept Forest\n\nStony Shore[1]\n\nDripstone Caves‌[BE only][3]\n\nSome regions of Frozen Ocean and Deep Frozen Ocean 120±8 Old Growth Spruce Taiga\n\nTaiga 160±8 Old Growth Pine Taiga\n\nMeadow‌[BE only]\n\nCherry Grove‌[BE only] 200±8 Others Out of world\n\nSnow accumulation[]\n\nIn Java Edition, the maximum snow accumulation layer can be set by snowAccumulationHeight game rules. In Bedrock Edition, the maximun snow layer is based on the snow accumulation value of the biome. The value is a array of 2 numbers, representing the minimum and maximum snow heights, with 0.0 being no snow and 1.0 being the full height of one block.\n\nList of biome

Vegetation), Continentalness (aka. Continents), Erosion, Weirdness (aka. Ridges) and Depth, which are calculated with 6 density functions. They respectively correspond to T, V, C, E, W and D in the \"NoiseRouter\" line of debug screen‌[Java Edition only]. Except \"depth\", the other 5 parameters are based on only horizontal coordinates.\n\nThinking of them as a six-dimensional space, in the space a lot of intervals are defined for biomes, as described in the tables below. If the six parameters at a location fall into an interval, the corresponding biome is generated. If the six parameters at a location do not fall into a defined biome interval in these tables, it uses the closest biome interval to the 6D parameter point, in order to form a transition between biomes.\n\nTemperature[]\n\nThe temperature parameter is a noise parameter used only in biome generation and do not affect terrain generation.\n\nThe range of temperature is about from -2.31 to +2.31. But biome intervals are defined only from -1.0 to +1.0.\n\nTemperature values from -1 to +1 are divided into 5 levels. The corresponding ranges from level 0 to level 4 are: -1~-0.45, -0.45~-0.15, -0.15~0.2, 0.2~0.55, 0.55~1. The level at a horizontal location can be found at the \"T\" in the \"Biome builder\" line on the debug screen. Temperature values less than -1 are displayed as level 0; higher than +1 are displayed as ?.\n\nNote that the temperature parameter is not the temperature of a biome, but they roughly correspond each other, e.g. if a location's temperature parameter is level 0, the base temperature of the biome here is usually low enough or the terrain is high enough, that the surface is covered in snow and ice.\n\nHumidity[]\n\nThe humidity (also known as vegetation) parameter is a noise parameter used only in biome generation and do not affect terrain generation.\n\nThe range of humidity is about from -1.76 to +1.76. But biome intervals are defined only from -1.0 to +1.0.\n\nHumidity values from -1 to +1 are also divided into 5 levels. The corresponding ranges from level 0 to level 4 are: -1~-0.35, -0.35~-0.1, -0.1~0.1, 0.1~0.3, 0.3~1. The level at a horizontal location can be found at the \"H\" in the \"Biome builder\" line on the debug screen. Values less than -1 are displayed as level 0; higher than +1 are displayed as ?.\n\nContinentalness[]\n\nThe continentalness (also known as continents) parameter is used to decide between ocean/beach/land biomes. It affects the terrain height during terrain generation. The larger the continentalness, the higher the average terrain height. And when the continentality is extremely low, the terrain height also becomes higher, in order to generate mushroom fields in the center of the ocean.\n\nThe range of continentalness is about from -3.80 to +3.80 . Biome intervals are defined only from -1.2 to +1.0.\n\nIf the continentalness of a location is between -1.2~-1.05, the mushroom fields biome is generated; when it is between -1.05~-0.455, deep ocean biomes are generated; when -0.455~-0.19, ocean biomes are generated; when -0.19~1.0, inland biomes are generated. For inland biomes, continentalness values are further subdivided into 4 types: coast (-0.19~-0.11), near-inland (-0.11~0.03), mid-inland (0.03~0.3) and far-inland (0.3~1.0). The level at a horizontal location can be found at the \"C\" in the \"Biome builder\" line on the debug screen. Values less than -1.2 are displayed as Mushroom fields; higher than +1.0 are displayed as Far inland.\n\nErosion[]\n\nThe erosion parameters mainly affect inland terrain during terrain generation. The higher the erosion at a location, the lower the terrain height and the flatter the terrain.\n\nThe range of erosion is about from -2.52 to +2.52. Biome intervals are defined only from -1.0 to +1.0.\n\nErosion values from -1 to +1 are divided into 7 levels. The corresponding intervals from level 0 to level 6 are: -1~-0.78, -0.78~-0.375, -0.375~-0.2225, -0.2225~0.05, 0.05~0.45, 0.45~0.55, 0.55~1. The level at a horizontal location can be found at the \"E\" in the \"Biome builder\" line of the debug screen. Values less than -1 are displayed as level 0; higher than +1 are displayed as ?.\n\nWeirdness[]\n\nThe weirdness (also known as ridges) parameter affects whether to generate a weirder biome or not. If the weirdness value is greater than 0, the generated biome becomes weirder. For example, using the variant of the Jungle biome — Bamboo Jungle; not using beach biomes when on the coast.\n\nThe range of weirdness is about from -2.97 to +2.97,but biome intervals are defined only from -1.0 to +1.0.\n\nThe PV (\"peaks and valleys\", aka. \"ridges folded\") value is calculated through the formula 1 − | 3 | w e i r d n e s s | − 2 | {\\displaystyle 1-\\vert 3\\vert weirdness \\vert-2 \\vert} , which is also shown at the \"PV\" in the \"NoiseRouter\" line of the debug screen.\n\nWhen the weirdness value is between -1.0 and 1.0, the PV values are divided into 5 levels:\n\nIf the PV is -1.0~-0.85, the PV level is \"Valleys\";\n\nIf -0.85~-0.6, \"Low Slice\";\n\nIf -0.6~0.2, \"Mid Slice\";\n\nIf 0.2~0.7, \"High Slice\";\n\nIf 0.7~1, \"Peaks\".\n\nNot that the PV value is defined no matter what the weirdness is, but these 5 PV levels are defined only when weirdness is between -1.0 and 1.0. The level at a horizontal location can be found at the \"PV\" in the \"Biome builder\" line on the debug screen. Though the five PV levels are defined only when weirdness is between -1.0 and 1.0, the PV level is always displayed even when weirdness is out of ±1.0, and PV values less than -1.0 are displayed as Valleys. So, when weirdness is not between -1.0~1.0, the PV level in the \"Biome builder\" line often doesn't match the biome here.\n\nBoth weirdness and PV affect the terrain height during terrain generation, especially the PV value has a more significant impact on the terrain height inland. The higher the PV value, the higher the terrain. Usually, at places with low continentalness or high erosion, when the PV level is \"Valleys\", the terrain is low enough to generate rivers. At high terrain, negative weirdness values lead to taller and more jagged and point peaks. When the erosion level is approximately 5, positive weirdness values result in weird inland terrain that is shattered and extremely precipitous and craggy. Since the weirdness value controls both whether the biome is a weird variant and whether the valley is generated, a biome and its variants often not appear on the same bank of a river.\n\nDepth[]\n\nUnlike other five parameters, depth is not based on a single noise. Depth corresponds approximately to the terrain height. It is roughly 0 when at surface, and increases by 1⁄128 (0.0078125) for every 1 block down. The depth parameter affects whether a surface biome or a cave biome is placed. The table below lists the depth values for surface biomes and cave biomes.\n\nDepth Biomes D=0 Surface biomes D=0.2~0.9 Dripstone Caves（Continentalness=0.8~1; Humidity=-1.0~1.0）\n\nLush Caves（Continentalness=-1.0~1.0; Humidity=0.7~1)\n\nSee also [4] D=1 Surface biomes D=1.1 Deep Dark（E=0,1）\n\nNon-inland surface biomes[]\n\nThe generation of non-inland biomes has nothing to do with humidity, erosion and weirdness. The following table lists the relation between non-inland surface biomes and continentalness and temperature.\n\nTemperature Oceans Deep oceans Mushroom fields T=0 Frozen Ocean Deep Frozen Ocean Mushroom Fields T=1 Cold Ocean Deep Cold Ocean T=2 Ocean Deep Ocean T=3 Lukewarm Ocean Deep Lukewarm Ocean T=4 Warm Ocean\n\nInland surface biomes[]\n\nThe following table lists the relation between inland surface biomes and continentalness. erosion, and PV.\n\nPV Erosion Coast Near-inland Mid-inland Far-inland Valleys E=0~1 Frozen River（T=0）\n\nRiver（T>0) Frozen River（T=0）\n\nRiver（T>0） Middle biomes（T<4）\n\nBadland biomes（T=4） E=2~5 Frozen River（T=0）\n\nRiver（T>0） E=6 Frozen River（T=0）\n\nSwamp（T=1,2）\n\nMangrove Swamp（T=3,4） Low Slice E=0~1 Stony Shore Middle biomes（T<4）\n\nBadland biomes（T=4） Snowy Slopes（T=0; H=0,1）\n\nGrove（T=0; H=2,3,4）\n\nMiddle biomes（0<T<4）\n\nBadland biomes（T=4） E=2 Middle biomes Middle biomes（T<4）\n\nBadland biomes（T=4） E=3 Beach biomes E=4 Middle biomes E=5 Beach biomes（W<0）\n\nMiddle biomes（W>0; T=0,1 OR H=4）\n\nWindswept Savanna（W>0; T=2,3,4; H=0,1,2,3） Middle biomes（W<0 OR T=0,1 OR H=4）\n\nWindswept Savanna（W>0; T=2,3,4; H=0,1,2,3） E=6 Beach biomes Middle biomes（T=0）\n\nSwamp（T=1,2）\n\nMangrove Swamp（T=3,4） Mid Slice E=0 Stony Shore Snowy Slopes（T<3; H=0,1）\n\nGrove（T<3; H=2,3,4）\n\nPlateau biomes（T=3,4） E=1 Snowy Slopes（T=0; H=0,1）\n\nGrove（T=0; H=2,3,4）\n\nMiddle biomes（0<T<4）\n\nBadland biomes（T=4） Snowy Slopes（T=0; H=0,1）\n\nGrove（T=0; H=2,3,4）\n\nPlateau biomes（T>0） E=2 Middle biomes Middle biomes（T<4）\n\nBadland biomes（T=4） Plateau biomes E=3 Middle biomes Middle biomes（T<4）\n\nBadland biomes（T=4） E=4 Beach biomes（W<0）\n\nMiddle biomes（W>0） Middle biomes E=5 Beach biomes（W<0）\n\nMiddle biomes（W>0; T=0,1 OR H=4）\n\nWindswept Savanna（W>0; T=2,3,4; H=0,1,2,3） Middle biomes（W<0 OR T=0,1 OR H=4）\n\nWindswept Savanna（W>0; T=2,3,4; H=0,1,2,3） Shattered biomes E=6 Beach biomes（W<0）\n\nMiddle biomes（W>0） Middle biomes（T=0）\n\nSwamp（T=1,2）\n\nMangrove Swamp（T=3,4） High Slice E=0 Middle biomes Snowy Slopes（T<3; H=0,1）\n\nGrove（T<3; H=2,3,4）\n\nPlateau biomes（T=3,4） Jagged Peaks（T=0,1,2; W<0）\n\nFrozen Peaks（T=0,1,2; W>0）\n\nStony Peaks（T=3）\n\nBadland biomes（T=4） E=1 Snowy Slopes（T=0; H=0,1）\n\nGrove（T=0; H=2,3,4）\n\nMiddle biomes（0<T<4）\n\nBadland biomes（T=4） Snowy Slopes（T<3; H=0,1）\n\nGrove（T<3; H=2,3,4）\n\nPlateau biomes（T=3,4） E=2 Middle biomes Plateau biomes Plateau biomes E=3 Middle biomes（T<4）\n\nBadland biomes（T=4） E=4 Middle biomes E=5 Middle biomes（W<0 OR T=0,1 OR H=4）\n\nWindswept Savanna（W>0; T=2,3,4; H=0,1,2,3） Shattered biomes E=6 Middle biomes Peaks E=0 Jagged Peaks（T=0,1,2; W<0）\n\nFrozen Peaks（T=0,1,2; W>0）\n\nStony Peaks（T=3）\n\nBadland biomes（T=4） Jagged Peaks（T=0,1,2; W<0）\n\nFrozen Peaks（T=0,1,2; W>0）\n\nStony Peaks（T=3）\n\nBadland biomes（T=4） E=1 Snowy Slopes（T=0; H=0,1）\n\nGrove（T=0; H=2,3,4）\n\nMiddle biomes（0<T<4）\n\nBadland biomes（T=4） E=2 Middle biomes Plateau biomes Plateau biomes E=3 Middle biomes（T<4）\n\nBadland biomes（T=4） E=4 Middle biomes E=5 Shattered biomes（W<0 OR T=0,1 OR H=4）\n\nWindswept Savanna（W>0; T=2,3,4; H=0,1,2,3） Shattered biomes E=6 Middle biomes\n\nIn which, the specific biome generation of beach biomes, badland biomes, middle biomes, plateau biomes, and shattered biomes is determined by the temperature, humidity and weirdness values.\n\nBeach biomes generates in the low terrain along the coast, and the specific biome generation is only related to the temperature value.\n\nTemperature Biomes T=0 Snowy Beach T=1,2,3 Beach T=4 Desert\n\nBadland biomes usually generate inland with low erosion value, and can also generate along the coast with high terrain and low erosion.

Unlike the Overworld, the Nether biome specifies biomes with points, while the Overworld uses 6D intervals.\n\nThe offset parameter isn't from density function. It is always 0 at any location in a world. This means that the parameter point of a location is always in the temperature-humidity-plane. The closer the offset (of a biome point) is to 0, the closer the point is to the T-H-plane, and the greater the advantage it has during biome generation.\n\nBiomes Temperature Humidity Offset Basalt Deltas -0.5 0 0.175 Crimson Forest 0.4 0 0 Nether Wastes 0 0 0 Soul Sand Valley 0 -0.5 0 Warped Forest 0 0.5 0.375\n\nThe End[]\n\nin Java Edition, the End uses only one density function value: erosion.

Maps now have a snowy or grassy theme randomly determined when creating the world. v1.2.0previewAdded true biomes; they were rain forest, seasonal forest, forest, shrubland, taiga, tundra, savanna, plains, swampland, desert, and frozen desert. World saves remained unchanged, other than a change in the hue of the grass. If the player moves into ungenerated chunks, the new biomes would generate. Java Edition Beta 1.6Added the Sky Dimension with its own biome. It could be viewed only through the use of modifications. 1.8August 18, 2011Notch tweeted a screenshot of a revamped river biome. September 2, 2011Notch teases a screenshot of the new desert biome. September 3, 2011Notch teases a screenshot of the new swamp biome. pre1Biomes got an overhaul, removing some biomes, such as the tundra and the taiga, and others replaced with nine fractal-based biomes that were a mix of the previous biomes and new biomes. See here for more details. Java Edition 1.0.0September 14, 2011Notch mentions \"snow biomes\". September 15, 2011Notch teases a screenshot of snow biomes. Beta 1.9 PrereleaseRe-added tundra (as ice plains). Added mushroom islands and frozen ocean. 1.112w01aAdded hills and beaches. Smoothed color transitions between biomes – swampland grass, foliage and water smoothly transition into other biomes. 1.2.1January 18, 2012Jens Bergensten tweeted a teaser screenshot of a new jungle biome. January 19, 2012He tweeted another jungle screenshot, showcasing the bright green foliage. 12w03aAdded the jungle biome. 12w07aThe Anvil file format was introduced and it allows for biomes to be stored in the world data. In contrast, the Region file format relies on the seed to dynamically calculate biome placement. This would cause biome placement in older worlds to change when the biome generation code was changed. With the current Anvil format, the biome data is stored along with the rest of the world data, meaning it does not change after the world is generated and can be edited by third-party map-editing tools. Furthermore, \"edge\" biomes allow for biomes to continue to extend beyond the edge chunks of an old world. This allows for smooth transitions in world generation after the generation code changes in an update. 1.3.1?Some sections of ice plains biomes were replaced with taiga biomes. 1.7.2August 2, 2013Jens tweeted the first image of the mesa biome. He jokingly referred to them as \"disco mountains.\" August 7, 2013Jens tweeted the first image of a mega taiga, unofficially dubbed the Redwood Forest. The name was changed following 1.7's release. August 9, 2013Jens tweeted the first image of a stone beach, which was then referred to as a \"cliff\" biome. 13w36aMesa, mega taiga, roofed forest, birch forest, savanna, extreme hills+, deep ocean and snowless taiga biomes were added as well as variations for many of the biomes. Biomes were also separated by temperature, and snowing was added to extreme hills. Biomes avoid getting placed next to a biome that is too different from itself, temperature-wise.The frozen ocean and extreme hills edge biomes no longer generate naturally.\"Adventuring Time\" achievement added, but it was broken until 1.8, making the goal of getting all achievements impossible in 1.7. 1.814w17aThe End's biome name is now \"The End\" instead of \"Sky\". Adventuring Time is now available without commands. Before, the 38 biomes had to be visited without visiting any other biomes, which made the achievement unavailable because the End has to be visited for its prerequisite, The End?. The \"no other biomes\" restriction is now lifted.Visiting the frozen ocean and extreme hills edge biomes, which no longer generate since 13w36a, is no longer required for Adventuring Time. 1.915w37aAdded new biome \"The Void\", which is used in Superflat preset \"The Void\". 16w02aA lot of M type biomes no longer generate due to . 16w03aM biomes generate again, with the exception of birch forest M (which messes with a lot of other things), see . 1.1116w43aBirch forest M biomes generate once again. 1.1318w06aThe outer islands of the End biome are now divided up into four separate biomes: The End - Floating Islands, The End - Medium island, The End - High island, and The End - Barren island. Slightly tweaked the placements of all modified biomes. 18w08aAdded ocean variants, including warm ocean, lukewarm ocean, cold ocean, warm deep ocean, deep lukewarm ocean, deep cold ocean, and deep frozen ocean. Frozen ocean now generates naturally again, for the first time since 13w36a. 18w08bDeep warm ocean biome no longer generates. 18w16aBiome names are now translatable. Cleaned up several biome names, mainly by adding missing spaces and changing \"Biome M\" for \"Mutated Biome\". 18w19aNames of several biomes are changed. The exact name changes are listed here. pre5Changed several biome IDs, mostly to comply with their names, listed here. 1.1418w43aAdded bamboo jungles. 1.1519w36aBiome information now stores Y-coordinates, allowing biomes to be changed based on height. However, this is not yet implemented. September 28, 2019Nether biomes were shown at Minecon Live 2019. 1.1620w06aImplemented vertical biomes in the Nether. Added soul sand valleys, crimson forests, and warped forests.\"Nether\" biome has been renamed to \"Nether Wastes\".Added the /locatebiome command that shows the coordinates of the nearest biomes. 20w15aAdded the basalt deltas. 20w19aTweaked biome distribution in the Nether. 1.16.220w28aExperimental Support for Custom Biomes was added. October 3, 2020Cave biomes and new mountains were shown at Minecraft Live 2020. 1.1720w46aBiome-specific sky colors now blend more smoothly. 20w49aAdded the dripstone caves biome. Currently accessible only using the buffet world options. 21w10aAdded the lush caves biome. Currently accessible only using the buffet world options. October 16, 2021New swamps were shown and overhauls for other biomes were hinted at Minecraft Live 2021. 1.18Experimental Snapshot 1Implemented multi-noise biome generation in the Overworld. Biomes no longer control the terrain height.Added the meadow, grove, snowy slopes, lofty peaks, and snowcapped peaks biomes.Dripstone caves, lush caves, and deep warm ocean biomes can now generate naturally.Several variant biomes no longer generate naturally. Affected biomes are listed here.Swamp does not generate properly. Experimental Snapshot 2Savanna plateau, eroded badlands and ice spikes can now generate naturally once again. Swamp now generates properly. Experimental Snapshot 3Added the stony peaks biome. Experimental Snapshot 5Jungle edge now generates naturally once again. 21w40aNames of several biomes changed. The exact name changes are listed here. Non-cave biomes no longer change with height.Increased biome sizes to better match pre-1.18 sizes. 21w43aRemoved the deep warm ocean biome. 1.19Deep Dark Experimental Snapshot 1Added the deep dark biome. 22w13aEroded badlands now require positive weirdness instead of negative weirdness. 22w14aAdded the mangrove swamp biome. 1.19.423w03aNow, whether it rains or snows are determined only by temperature. The Precipitation value of a biome can be only \"true\" or \"false\".[6] 1.20\n\n(Experimental)23w07aAdded the cherry grove biome. Pocket Edition Alpha v0.1.0Added biomes, these 5 biomes include: snowy tundra, snowy taiga, plains, forest, and desert, from Java Edition Alpha v1.2.0. v0.1.3Cacti now generates in deserts. v0.8.0build 1The color of the sky now changes slightly depending on the biome. v0.9.0build 1All biomes as of Java Edition 1.7.2 have been added.

Report issues there.\n\nTrivia[]\n\nThe term biome is analogous to its scientific usage: in real life, a biome is climatically and geographically defined by distinctive communities of plants, animals and soil organisms supported by similar climatic conditions. They are often referred to as ecosystems.[7][8]\n\nMost biomes in the Overworld are based on real world counterparts. Dark forests or swamps parallel real world biomes except for the addition of giant mushrooms, which don't exist in reality. Biomes in the Nether and the End don't exist either.\n\nIt is possible for biomes to be a single block in size.[9]\n\nGallery[]\n\nScreenshots[]\n\nThe five general shades of green for grass blocks and leaves, clockwise from top right: aquamarine (cold, oceanic and birch forest), brown (for badlands, which is a rare dry biome), olive (dry), green (temperate), and blue-grey (snowy).\n\nAn above view of a flower forest biome.\n\nA dark forest bordering onto a lake.\n\nA dark forest biome.
