        "text": "Frequently asked questions (FAQ) about MediaWiki usage. If your question is neither answered here nor in the technical MediaWiki documentation or the MediaWiki user documentation, then please ask in a support venue.\n\nThe basics\n\nWhat are the differences between MediaWiki, Wikimedia, Wikipedia, and wiki?\n\nPlease see Differences between Wikipedia, Wikimedia, MediaWiki, and wiki for a detailed answer.\n\nI want to use a MediaWiki instance to (blank). Am I allowed to?\n\nMediaWiki is free software: this means that you may use it for any purpose without legal hindrance. Furthermore, its licensing conditions apply solely to the software itself. This means that although many wikis license their content under a permissive license, you are not obliged to license the content submitted to your wiki in any particular way. Of course, as a project founded to support sites like Wikipedia, we encourage you to license the texts you write under a free license, but, in short, you are not required to.\n\nIf you wish to alter or amend the software itself, in general, you are permitted to, but there are some restrictions and you should consult the full text of the GNU GPL version 2 for details. Because MediaWiki is provided free of charge, there is no warranty, to the extent permitted by applicable law.\n\nHow do I create a wiki?\n\nCreating a wiki implies installing MediaWiki on a server and having access to manage it. There are different options, depending on your level of expertise:\n\nTo create a wiki on your own server, follow the Installation guide.\n\nSome hosts offer one-click installs, or allow creating a wiki on-request. See Hosting services for different options.\n\nThis site (MediaWiki.org) or the Wikimedia Foundation does not allow individuals to create wikis.\n\nInstallation and configuration\n\nWhere do I download MediaWiki?\n\nDownload the latest stable release of MediaWiki. Files are supplied in a .tar.gz archive. MediaWiki can also be obtained directly from our Git repository.\n\nHow to install MediaWiki?\n\nInstalling MediaWiki takes around 10 to 30 minutes, and involves uploading/copying files, and running the installer script to configure the software. See Manual:Installation guide , where you will also find the minimum system requirements.\n\nHow do I install MediaWiki using a package?\n\nMany Linux distributions provide MediaWiki in a packaged format for that distribution. The MediaWiki development team refers you to your Linux distribution for assistance with installing, configuring or using them. The individual communities and companies who maintain such packages should provide installation instructions.\n\nBe warned that third-party distributions may be older versions, so pay close attention to compatibility information for directions and extensions.\n\nSee also: Software bundles\n\nCan I install more than one wiki on a server using MediaWiki?\n\nIt is possible to install more than one wiki on a server provided that:\n\nYou install multiple instances of MediaWiki (such as with a software bundle like the Bitnami MediaWiki Stack); in different directories â€“ one for each wiki\n\nOr\n\nYou use a different database for each wiki\n\nOr\n\nYou use a different database prefix for each wiki (for Postgres, you can achieve a similar effect by using different schemas and users). If you want to use the same LocalSettings.php file for both, you must ensure $wgServer is dynamically set to the correct value.\n\nFor information on the latter two options, see $wgDBname and $wgDBprefix respectively.\n\nFor more information on setting up a wiki family (wikifarm), see Manual:Wiki family .\n\nHow do I install an existing wiki, like Wikipedia or Wiktionary?\n\nThe main (but not necessarily the easiest) method is to import. See Wiki importing, below.\n\n(Non-MediaWiki methods, such as Xowa and Kiwix can be found at w:Wikipedia:Database download).\n\nDoes MediaWiki require shell access?\n\nShell access (SSH) is not required for installing MediaWiki, but it is highly recommended. Without shell access, it may even be difficult for you to get a backup of your wiki, or to upgrade to a new version. Some maintenance tasks are not possible at all without shell access. Many major extensions work best with shell access.\n\nHow do I install extensions?\n\nSee Manual:Extensions for information about installing and writing extensions. See Category:Extensions to find existing extensions.\n\nHow do I add extra namespaces?\n\nSee Creating a custom namespace.\n\nHow do I enable uploading?\n\nFile uploads are an often-used feature of MediaWiki, but are disabled by default in all current release versions. To enable them, first make the upload directory (default images) writable by the web server (chmod -R 777 ./images or allow the Apache user to write to it, etc.) then set $wgEnableUploads to true in LocalSettings.php. If you get a \"failed to mkdir\" error when you try to upload, it probably means that there's a permissions problem.\n\nSee also: Manual:Configuring file uploads\n\nHow do I allow uploading of additional formats?\n\nMediaWiki requires that allowed file upload formats are specified using the $wgFileExtensions configuration directive. Usually this directive is situated in LocalSettings.php in the root of your MediaWiki installation.\n\nFor example, to extend uploading to PDF files, add the following to LocalSettings.php:\n\n$wgFileExtensions[] = 'pdf';\n\nTo extend uploading to more than one type of file, use the following syntax\n\n$wgFileExtensions = array_merge( $wgFileExtensions, [ 'pdf', 'txt', 'mp3' ] );\n\nSee also: Manual:Configuring file uploads\n\nHow do I enable embedded math formulas?\n\nMediaWiki allows embedded math formulas. See Extension:Math for complete setup instructions.\n\nHow do I set the timezone for my MediaWiki?\n\nSee Manual:Timezone\n\nHow do I purge a cached page?\n\nTo purge a cached page, such as when making changes to the navigation bar, add &action=purge to the end of the page's dynamic URL.\n\nE.g. https://www.mediawiki.org/w/index.php?title=Main_Page&action=purge\n\nOr ?action=purge to the end of the page's short form URL:\n\nE.g. https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Main_Page?action=purge\n\nSee also: Manual:Purge , Manual:Parameters to index.php\n\nHow do I completely disable caching?\n\nAdd in your LocalSettings.php file the following lines:\n\n$wgParserCacheType = CACHE_NONE; $wgCachePages = false;\n\n\"File is corrupt or has an invalid extension\"\n\nSome users have reported that after adding a file format to the allowed extensions list, an error is encountered. The text of the error is similar to the following:\n\nThe file is corrupt or has an incorrect extension. Please check the file and upload again.\n\nAs a possible solution, set the value of $wgMimeDetectorCommand. Under Unix or Linux, this would be\n\n$wgMimeDetectorCommand = \"file --brief --mime\";\n\nSee also: Manual:MIME type detection\n\nInitial user was not created by installer or it is not an administrator\n\nSometimes, the installer fails to create the default user, or the user table is lost for some reason. There are a couple of options for solving this:\n\nmaintenance/createAndPromote.php\n\nExecute maintenance/createAndPromote.php --username <new user name> --password <password for that user> from the shell. Append --bureaucrat to command line if you want that user to become a bureaucrat, in addition to becoming an administrator.\n\nThis will create a new user and promote them to an administrator. For help, run the script with the parameter --help.\n\nAlter the database\n\nRegister a new account using the regular method (Special:UserLogin).\n\nCheck the user ID via API.\n\nExecute the following SQL statement against the database:\n\nINSERT INTO user_groups ( ug_user, ug_group ) VALUES ( <id>, 'bureaucrat' ), ( <id>, 'sysop' );\n\n<id> above should be replaced with the appropriate user ID which you can see on the user's preference page.\n\nNote: if $wgDBprefix is defined in LocalSettings.php, prepend its value to the table name. For example, if $wgDBprefix is \"XYZ\", then the table name to use is XYZuser_groups\n\nTemporarily let everyone assign rights to promote your initial user\n\nWarning: You should not let outsiders access your wiki while you do this, if you use this method. This method may leave your wiki temporarily vulnerable to attack while you do the procedure.\n\nThis method essentially involves letting all users temporarily modify user permissions in order to promote one user\n\nRegister a new account using the regular method (Special:UserLogin). Be logged in using that account.\n\nAdd the following line to the bottom of LocalSettings.php\n\n$wgGroupPermissions['user']['userrights'] = true;\n\nGo to special:userrights and add the user you just created to the Administrator and Bureaucrat groups.\n\nRemove the $wgGroupPermissions['user']['userrights'] = true; line from your LocalSettings.php. This step is very important, as until you remove it anyone can alter permissions, which is bad.\n\nHow do I reset a user's MediaWiki password?\n\nSee Manual:Resetting passwords\n\nSee Manual:Interwiki\n\nHow do I make my base URLs shorter?\n\n(i.e. /wiki/Article_Name as opposed to /w/index.php?title=Article_Name)\n\nSee Manual:Short URL\n\nHow do I organize pages into subdirectories like /wiki/subdir/PageName?\n\nSee Manual:$wgNamespacesWithSubpages and Help:Subpages\n\nIs downloading and using all of MediaWiki.org free?\n\nYes, it is free in the sense of Free software. See Project:Copyrights for licensing issues regarding the written content of this site.\n\nHow do I administrate/manage user rights?\n\nSee Manual:User rights for general information. See Manual:Preventing access for methods and strategies for restricting access.\n\nHow do I stop anonymous users from editing any page?\n\nThe recommended method is by changing the value of the $wgGroupPermissions configuration option. Edit LocalSettings.php and add the line:\n\n$wgGroupPermissions['*']['edit'] = false;\n\nIf you use Extension:AbuseFilter , any admin can also disable IP editing temporarily as needed.\n\nSee also: Preventing access , Manual:User rights\n\nHow do I stop anonymous users from reading any page?\n\nAdd this to the bottom of LocalSettings.php:\n\n$wgGroupPermissions['*']['read'] = false;\n\nSee also Manual:$wgWhitelistRead . See Manual:Preventing access#Restrict viewing of all pages for more information.\n\nHow do I restrict account creation?\n\nAdd this to the bottom of LocalSettings.php:\n\n$wgGroupPermissions['*']['createaccount'] = false;\n\nSee Manual:Preventing access#Restrict account creation for more information.\n\nHow do I require an email address be specified at registration?\n\nSee Manual:$wgEmailConfirmToEdit\n\nHow do I put MediaWiki into Read Only mode?\n\nMediaWiki version:\n\nâ‰¥ 1.5\n\nSee Manual:$wgReadOnly\n\nHow do I change default user preferences?\n\nMediaWiki version:\n\nâ‰¥ 1.4\n\nThe MediaWiki default user preferences are in MainConfigSchema.php Don't edit that file, just use it for reference.\n\nSay if you want to hide minor edits in recent changes by default. DefaultSettings.php says:\n\npublic const DefaultUserOptions = [ ... 'hideminor' => 0, ... ]\n\nTo change the preference, put this in your LocalSettings.php:\n\n$wgDefaultUserOptions[\"hideminor\"] = 1;\n\nTo change the default namespaces to be searched, in any version of MediaWiki, set $wgNamespacesToBeSearchedDefault in LocalSettings.php to an array mapping namespace indexes to boolean values. For example, to search the main namespace and the category namespace, use:\n\n$wgNamespacesToBeSearchedDefault = [ NS_MAIN => true, NS_CATEGORY => true, ];\n\nIn some cases, after you change a default user preference, you may also want to change the user preferences of all existing user accounts.\n\nIf so, use the userOptions.php script in the maintenance directory. Use the --dry option for the first run, assess the impact and go from there. (--dry does not write the database.)\n\nphp userOptions.php --dry --nowarn hideminor --old 0 --new 1\n\nAlso, always backup your database before making these kinds of changes (you do not need to if you are just using --dry).\n\nSee also: Manual:$wgDefaultUserOptions\n\nHow can I make MediaWiki run faster?\n\nSee: Manual:Performance tuning\n\nHow do I enable a drop-down list of search suggestions?\n\nSee Manual:Enabling autocomplete in search box\n\nHow do MediaWiki and GDPR go together?\n\nSee GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation) and MediaWiki software\n\nUpgrading\n\nSee Manual:Upgrading\n\nMoving\n\nIs it possible to move my wiki to a different machine?\n\nYes. It should be. In essence, you will be backing up your old installation and then \"restoring\" it onto the new machine. Finally, you will have to make additional modifications to update the wiki configuration so that everything points to the new location.\n\nHow do I move my wiki to a different server?\n\nFollow the instructions at Manual:Moving a wiki .\n\nChanging the interface\n\nHow do I change the logo?\n\nThe logo that appears in the top left of each page is determined by the $wgLogo configuration line in the LocalSettings.php file.\n\nThere are two ways to change the logo:\n\nUpload a picture to your wiki using the normal file uploading interface. This allows the logo to be replaced easily, so you may want to protect the page if you use this method.\n\nThen add the $wgLogo line to LocalSettings.php, for example:\n\n$wgLogo = \"{$wgUploadPath}/6/62/mylogo.png\";\n\nUpload an image to your server by other means (such as FTP).\n\nAdd the $wgLogo line to LocalSettings.php, for example:\n\n$wgLogo = \"{$wgScriptPath}/mylogo.jpg\";\n\n(In this example, the image is in the same folder as the LocalSettings.php file.)\n\nIf you want to change the logo in only specific pages, override #p-logo css's background-image property or use third party extension like Extension:LogoFunctions .\n\nCaution: Do not simply overwrite the default logo installed with MediaWiki (/resources/assets/wiki.png); this file will be overwritten when you upgrade.\n\nA good size for a square logo is 135x135px or 150x150px, but the logo need not be square, especially if it contains text below an image. The maximum logo size in Vector is ~160x160px, while MonoBook's is ~155x155px. A logo that is too large will be cut off.\n\nHow do I edit the wiki's CSS?\n\nYou shouldn't edit the CSS files (such as common.css) directly, because it will make upgrading harder if you need to apply your customizations each time you upgrade the software. Instead you need to edit a wiki page called MediaWiki:Common.css if you want to apply your CSS changes for all skins, or a wiki page called MediaWiki:Vector.css if you want to apply the customizations only for the Vector skin.\n\nThe content of the MediaWiki:Common.css and MediaWiki:Vector.css pages always overrides the default CSS styles specified in the skin files.\n\nHow do I hide the left vertical navigation toolbar?\n\nIn other words, how do you make the main content div take up 100% of the display, hiding the logo, toolbox, navigation and search engine?\n\nTo hide it permanently, copy and paste the following into the MediaWiki:Common.css page:\n\n#column-content{margin:00.6em0;} #content{margin:2.8em000;} #p-logo,.generated-sidebar,#p-lang,#p-tb,#p-search{display:none;} #p-cactions{left:.1em;}\n\nTo instead hide the toolbar when the user presses F11, enter this in your wiki's MediaWiki:Common.js:\n\ndocument.onkeydown=function(e){ if(e==null)e=event if(testKey(e,122)){//F11 appendCSS('#column-content {margin: 0 0 .6em 0;} #content {margin: 2.8em 0 0 0;} #p-logo, .generated-sidebar, #p-lang, #p-tb, #p-search {display:none;} #p-cactions {left: .1em;} #footer {display:none;}'); returnfalse; } } functiontestKey(e,intKeyCode){ if(window.createPopup) returne.keyCode==intKeyCode else returne.which==intKeyCode }\n\nHow do I hide the categories at the bottom of each page?\n\nYou can hide display of the categories on each page by modifying your MediaWiki:Common.css and adding:\n\n.catlinks{display:none;}\n\nHow do I customize the link-URL of the site-logo in the top left corner of all pages that activates when the site-logo is clicked upon?\n\nBy default, clicking the site-logo takes you to the main site-page. If you want to change which internal site-page is the \"main\" site-page, edit MediaWiki:Mainpage.\n\nTo make the link of the site-logo link externally to any other arbitrary URL, you can use jQuery code within MediaWiki:Common.js:\n\n$(\"a.mw-wiki-logo\").attr(\"href\",\"http://www.example.com\"); $(\"a.mw-wiki-logo\").attr(\"title\",\"Go to example.com website\");\n\nHow do I change the icon in the browser's address line (favicon)?\n\nSimply upload your favicon.ico to the root of your domain/subdomain, make sure file name is in lower case and its name is favicon.ico\n\nAlternatively edit the $wgFavicon setting in LocalSettings.php and add $wgFavicon = \"$wgScriptPath/path/to/your/favicon.ico\";\n\nSee Manual:$wgFavicon for more details.\n\nTip: The favicon image should be either 16 x 16 pixels or 32 x 32 pixels.\n\nRewrite Rule\n\nIf you are using a rewrite rule in .htaccess to remove \"index.php\" from the URL, you will also need to add an exception for .ico files. Simply add the following rule to your .htaccess:\n\nRewriteRule .*\\.ico$ - [L]\n\nThis rule must appear before the index.php rule.\n\nCase sensitivity\n\nWhen uploading the favicon file, be sure the filename is in lowercase. (That is, \"favicon.ico\", not \"Favicon.ico\".) A lot of servers (e.g., those on UNIX-like operating systems) will not be able to find the file unless its name is in lowercase.\n\nHow do I customize the navigation bar?\n\nThe contents of the navigation bar which appears to the left of each page using the Vector or the Monobook skin are determined by the MediaWiki:Sidebar page there on your wiki. For information on customising these, please see Manual:Interface/Sidebar .\n\nHow do I put a text message (sitenotice) on every page?\n\nPut a text in the MediaWiki:Sitenotice page. It will be displayed on top of every article page.\n\nYou can also add text to MediaWiki:Anonnotice to create a message that only displays for logged-out users. It is often a good idea to transclude the site notice on the anon notice to make sure that logged-out users still get the information on the site notice.\n\nHow do I change which page is the main page?\n\nBy default, MediaWiki looks for a page with the title Main Page and serves this as the default page. This can be changed by altering the contents of MediaWiki:Mainpage to point to a different title. If this does not change the 'Main Page' link included on the sidebar at install time, edit MediaWiki:Sidebar.\n\nHow do I change the Main Page title?\n\nSimply click on the \"Move\" tab, and move the page to the desired page title.\n\nUsually you also want to change which page is the configured as \"main page\".\n\nHow do I hide the main page title?\n\nMediaWiki 1.38+\n\nThe displayed title of the main page can be changed using the MediaWiki messages MediaWiki:mainpage-title and MediaWiki:mainpage-title-loggedin (for logged-out and logged-in users respectively). The main page title can be hidden by setting both messages to empty (or only either of them if the title should still be displayed to logged-out or logged-in users).\n\nMediaWiki 1.37 and below\n\nWarning: This is not the recommended way to do this for Wikimedia projects as it may cause integration problems with extensions, gadgets and skins.\n\nMediaWiki does not have a built-in option to hide the main page title (see task T8129), but you can use CSS to hide the title. Alternatively, you can use the NoTitle extension.\n\nAdd the following to MediaWiki:Common.css on your wiki:\n\nbody.page-Main_Page.action-viewh1.firstHeading,body.page-Main_Page.action-submith1.firstHeading{display:none;}\n\nIf your main page uses a localized name or you have renamed the main page you need to change the page-Main_Page part. You can find a correct parameter by viewing HTML source of the main page and searching for the body tag.\n\nFor example, if your language is Lojban, the body tag looks like this:\n\n<body class=\"mediawiki ltr sitedir-ltr ns-4 ns-subject page-uikipedi_as_ralju skin-vector action-view\">\n\nTherefore you should put this line in your MediaWiki:Common.css instead:\n\nbody.page-uikipedi_as_ralju.action-viewh1.firstHeading,body.page-uikipedi_as_ralju.action-submith1.firstHeading{display:none;}\n\nIf you would like to hide the title of a \"Main Page\" in a specific namespace like \"Help:Main_Page\" add the following to MediaWiki:Common.css on your wiki:\n\nbody.page-Help_Main_Page.action-viewh1.firstHeading,body.page-Help_Main_Page.action-submith1.firstHeading{display:none;}\n\nNote the difference: body.page-Help_Main_Page in comparison to body.page-Help:Main_Page. The latter will not work.\n\nIf this doesn't work, you may be using a skin that doesn't support this, or you moved your main page without updating MediaWiki:Mainpage, or you have a really old MediaWiki version.\n\nIf the skin uses a different element for the title than a h1 element with class firstHeading, you'll need to find the appropriate CSS selector to apply for that skin.\n\nHow can I hide the table of contents?\n\nThe table of contents (TOC) is automatically shown once there are four or more headings in the article. There are multiple ways to hide it.\n\nFor one page\n\nPlace the magic word __NOTOC__ in the page's wikitext.\n\nFor all pages\n\nInstall Extension:NoTOC\n\nor\n\nAdd the following rule to MediaWiki:Common.css:\n\n.toc,#toc{display:none;}\n\nPer user\n\nUsers can add the same CSS rule to their common.css personal stylesheet.\n\nHow do I change the interface text?\n\nInterface text is altered using the MediaWiki namespace. For each deviation from the default in the site language there is a page MediaWiki:Englishmessagename, and for each deviation from the default in each other language a page MediaWiki:Englishmessagename/languagecode. (Since release 1.9 there are no pages for messages equal to the default.). On creation of a page the edit box autofills with the default. When creating a page to override the default it is useful to first save the default version, to allow diffs with it. See also Help:System message .\n\nFor a list of system messages, see Special:Allmessages\n\nTo switch off the MediaWiki namespace, see the $wgUseDatabaseMessages configuration setting\n\nTo remove the Privacy policy or Disclaimers links at the bottom of each page, set the content of pages MediaWiki:Privacy or MediaWiki:Disclaimers respectively to a single hyphen (-).\n\nHow do I edit error messages?\n\nSpecial:Allmessages contains a complete list of messages (error or otherwise), that can be edited.\n\nYou may also add ?uselang=qqx or &uselang=qqx to a URL which will display the name of each messages in the interface.\n\nHow do I change the interface language?\n\nTo change the default interface language, alter the value of $wgLanguageCode in LocalSettings.php, for example\n\n$wgLanguageCode = \"fr\";\n\nYou may also need to bypass your browser's cache to see the changes.\n\nThe new default interface language will be applied to all users who haven't ever customised it.\n\nIf you want to provide users the possibility to create and choose pages and interface elements in languages other than the default one of the wiki, you need the Translate extension, which can make your wiki multilingual.\n\nIf you want to change the language settings for all existing users, use the userOptions.php maintenance script. For instance, to have all users with English set use French instead, run:\n\nphp userOptions.php language --old en --new fr\n\nHow do I remove the article/edit etc tabs?\n\nFor a little more control see: User:Subfader/Hide_page_tabs\n\nEdit MediaWiki:Common.css on your wiki, and add this:\n\nli#ca-edit{display:none;}\n\nSee the page source for the various #ca-* ids used in the content tabs.\n\nThis will only work for Monobook and derived skins such as Modern and Vector (the default skin), and doesn't actually stop people from editing. To do that, see Manual:User rights .\n\nHow do I add/remove tabs throughout my wiki?\n\nSee Manual:User group CSS and JavaScript or write your own extension (See: Manual:Hooks/SkinTemplateNavigation ):\n\nFor example, to remove the talk tab and then add a tab that always goes to the main page you would save this code in extensions/AR-Tabs.php:\n\nMediaWiki version:\n\nâ‰¥ 1.21\n\n<?php if( !defined( 'MEDIAWIKI' ) ){ die( \"This is not a valid access point.\\n\" ); } $wgHooks['SkinTemplateNavigation'][] = 'replaceTabs'; function replaceTabs( &$skin, &$links) { // Remove the talk action unset( $links['namespaces']['talk'] ); $maintitle = Title::newFromText( wfMessage( 'mainpage' )->inContentLanguage()->text() ); // Add an additional link $links['namespaces']['main'] = array( 'class' => false, // false or 'selected', defines whether the tab should be highlighted 'text' => wfMessage( 'sitetitle' )->text(), // what the tab says 'href' => $maintitle->getFullURL(), // where it links to 'context' => 'main', ); return true; }\n\nand then add\n\nrequire_once(\"extensions/AR-Tabs.php\");\n\nto the bottom of LocalSettings.php\n\nHow do I remove a tab on only one page?\n\nMediaWiki version:\n\nâ‰¥ 1.9\n\nFor example, to remove the Discussion (talk) page tab from the Main Page, on the MediaWiki:Common.css page add:\n\nbody.page-Main_Pageli#ca-talk{display:none!important;}\n\nTo modify MediaWiki:Common.css you must be an Interface administrator .\n\nSee also: Manual:Hide page tabs\n\nHow do I remove a tab on all pages\n\nMediaWiki version:\n\nâ‰¥ 1.9\n\nFor example, to remove the Discussion (talk) page tab on all wikipages, on the MediaWiki:Common.css page add:\n\n#ca-talk{display:none!important;}\n\nOther tabs to remove are #ca-history, #ca-viewsource, #ca-view (Read tab), #ca-nstab-main (Page tab).\n\nOther drop down menu items you can remove are #ca-watch, #ca-move, #ca-delete.\n\nTo modify MediaWiki:Common.css you must be an Interface administrator .\n\nOne option is to hide the link using the following CSS in the wiki page MediaWiki:Common.css in your wiki:\n\n#p-personal#pt-anonuserpage{ display:none; }\n\nAnother option is, inside your LocalSettings.php file, to use the PersonalUrls hook to remove the link to the talk page of anonymous users:\n\n$wgHooks['PersonalUrls'][] = 'lfRemoveAnonUserpageLink'; function lfRemoveAnonUserpageLink( &$personal_urls, $title ) { unset( $personal_urls['anonuserpage'] ); return true; }\n\nHow do I remove the \"Create an Account or Login\" link at the top right of the screen?\n\nTo remove the login / create account links from the personal_urls you can use this code in your LocalSettings.php to hook in and remove them:\n\n$wgHooks['SkinTemplateNavigation::Universal'][] = function ( $skinTemplate, &$links ) { unset( $links['user-menu']['login'] ); unset( $links['user-menu']['login-private'] ); unset( $links['user-menu']['createaccount'] ); };\n\nHow can I suppress actions and special pages?\n\nThere are two different ways:\n\nUsing .htaccess file\n\nMediaWiki is not designed for this kind of usage! Not all servers support .htaccess file. Note also that this system is not foolproof, it's just one step further than hiding the links (see above).\n\nSuppressing actions and special pages can be useful when you want to create the illusion of a static website via a particular URL or VirtualHost, but also have an 'internal' view that is a true wiki. i.e. if you have an inward facing 'view' of your wiki that users can edit, and an outward facing 'view' that should appear like a static website (no history, no discussion, etc., etc.).\n\nAfter hiding all the appropriate links (see above), if you are using the Apache web server, you can disable actions and special pages using the following rewrite rules:\n\n# Lock down the site (disable MediaWiki commands) RewriteEngineOn #RewriteLog /tmp/rewrite.log #RewriteLogLevel 9 ## See https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Special:MyLanguage/Manual:Parameters_to_index.php#Actions RewriteCond %{QUERY_STRING} (.*action=.*) RewriteRule .* http://www.my.domain.com? RewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI} !^/index.php/Special:Search RewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI} ^(.*Special:.*) RewriteRule .* http://www.my.domain.com? ## Catch a trick... RewriteCond %{QUERY_STRING} ^(.*Special:.*) RewriteRule .* http://www.my.domain.com?\n\nAbove, a request for 'http://www.my.domain.com/wiki/Page_name?action=edit', for example, will be simply rewritten to 'http://www.my.domain.com'. Similarly any page in the Special namespace (except for Special:Search) will be rewritten to 'http://www.my.domain.com'.\n\nAlternatively, you may also serve a \"403 Forbidden\" for all such requests using: RewriteRule .* - [F]. Remember, this is only a hack, and isn't intended as a solution for a secure CMS.\n\nNote that you will need to adjust the above rules to match your specific URL naming schema.\n\nOther issues to consider when trying to lock down a site like this is the API and POST requests for the wiki content (rather than GET).\n\nUsing LocalSettings.php\n\nTo disable a specific special page (such as Special:SpecialPages), you may use:\n\n$wgSpecialPages['Name'] = DisabledSpecialPage::getCallback( 'Name', 'message' );\n\nwhere Name is the canonical (English) name of the special page to disable, and message is the message to be shown to users when they try to access the special page.\n\nTo disable an action (such as edit), you may use:\n\n$wgActions['edit'] = false;\n\nSee API:Restricting API usage to disable an API module.\n\nThis is only the basic usages. Usually you may want to disable special pages, actions or API modules conditionally.\n\nSee: Manual:Footer , Manual:Configuration settings#Copyright\n\nYou can hide the Powered by MediaWiki image by adding the following to your wiki's MediaWiki:Common.css:\n\n#footer-poweredbyico{display:none;}\n\nIf you want to remove it completely, you can use $wgFooterIcons to remove it using this in your LocalSettings.php:\n\nunset( $wgFooterIcons['poweredby'] );\n\nNote that this will also remove other powered-by icons, e.g. also the one coming from BlueSpice.\n\nIf you wish to change the icon images, urls, alt text, or add new icons please see $wgFooterIcons' documentation.\n\nHow do I add a reply link to default signature tildes (~~~~) template?\n\nYou can customize signatures in MediaWiki:Signature / MediaWiki:Signature-anon.\n\nFor example, changing the entries to [[{{ns:user}}:$1|$2]] ([[{{ns:user_talk}}:$1|talk]]) will put a link to users' talk pages and [[{{ns:user}}:$1|$2]] ([{{fullurl:{{ns:user_talk}}:$1|action=edit&section=new}} Reply]) would give a more direct link.\n\nUsers can change their signature in their preferences.\n\nMost of the text that you want to change can be found in the namespace of MediaWiki.\n\nIn order to change titles, texts, announcements, etc., go to Special:AllMessages, where you will see the text associated with the pages you wish to change. You need to log in as an administrator to edit the protected entries in the MediaWiki namespace.\n\nIf you want to change the title in your browser, you need to edit MediaWiki:Pagetitle. Go there and edit it just like you would any other page in your wiki.\n\nIn recent versions of MediaWiki, MediaWiki:Pagetitle is $1 - {{SITENAME}} by default. If {{SITENAME}} is producing the wrong text for you, you need to set $wgSitename in your LocalSettings.php.\n\nDon't forget to clear your browser cache after you change your settings.\n\nDoes MediaWiki automatically capitalize the first letter of $wgSitename?\n\nYes. This can be changed using the $wgCapitalLinks configuration setting.\n\nSee Manual:$wgExternalLinkTarget\n\nPut \"â€Ž<nowiki>â€Ž</nowiki>\" tags around the URL or tag.\n\nExample:\n\nsvn co <nowiki>http://svn.example.com/myproject/</nowiki>\n\nProduces:\n\nsvn co http://svn.example.com/myproject/\n\nHow can I force users to preview before they save?\n\nSee: Manual:Force preview , Extension:ForcePreview\n\nHow do I add more buttons on the edit page?\n\nSee: Manual:Custom edit buttons\n\nFor adding more selectable special characters, etc., below the edit field, see Extension:CharInsert .\n\nHow can I use a different skin on my wiki?\n\nSee Manual:$wgDefaultSkin for more information on configuring your default skin.\n\nEdit the page MediaWiki:Print.css on your wiki and add the following code there:\n\n#contenta.external.text:after, #contenta.external.autonumber:after{ content:none; }\n\nThis will override the styles defined in the CSS files coming with the MediaWiki source code. For more information, see Manual:CSS .\n\nIf instead you want to have the external links underlined in the printable version, then also add the following code:\n\n#contenta.external{ text-decoration:underline!important; }\n\nTry this StackOverflow solution: Printed HTML per-page footnotes\n\nHow do I change the text of the article (page name) tab of my wiki's main page?\n\nTo change the text of the tab, as one example used in Wikipedia, you first open the page \"MediaWiki:Mainpage-nstab\".\n\nAfter you've done that, click Edit and type in the edit box the text you want to be seen later on the main page - that's it. Don't forget to save the page as well.\n\nHow do I change the background color?\n\nTo change the background color of the MediaWiki interface outside of the page content and tabs, add the following CSS to the MediaWiki page [[MediaWiki:Common.css]]:\n\n/* Changes the background color of the bottom and left of each page, up to behind half of the logo: */ body{ background:red; } /* Changes the background color behind the top half of the logo and at top of each page: */ #mw-page-base{ background:red; }\n\nThis will change the background color outside of the tabs, search, and page content to red. See Manual:CSS for more information.\n\nHow do I load external fonts?\n\nThis example refers to Google Fonts, a repository of free open-source fonts that you can use with MediaWiki. Go to https://fonts.google.com/, find fonts that you like, and select them by clicking the \"plus\" (+) icon. Select one or more fonts to be added. Click the tab for the pop-up notification, and then select \"@IMPORT\". Copy and paste the resulting CSS into [[MediaWiki:Common.css]]. The examples below use Noto Sans and Noto Serif. They are default fonts for Android operating system and have good support for Unicode text.\n\n@importurl('https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Noto+Sans|Noto+Serif '); /* Changes the default font used for MediaWiki to Noto Sans (does not include headings or monospaced text): */ body{ font-family:\"Noto Sans\",sans-serif; } /* Changes the default font used for MediaWiki headings to Noto Serif: */ #contenth1, #contenth2{ font-family:\"Noto Serif\",serif; }\n\nHow to hide the \"Your edit was saved\" notification?\n\nEdit the wiki page MediaWiki:Common.css on your wiki to include the line .postedit {display: none;}. See Manual:Interface/Stylesheets for more information.\n\nBasic usage\n\nHow do I edit a page?\n\nTo edit a page, simply click the edit link that appears on each page. Using the default Vector skin, this is in the form of a tab at the top of the page. A form will appear, containing the existing markup. When you have finished making modifications, click the Save button to commit your changes.\n\nSee also: Help:Editing pages\n\nHow do I create a new page?\n\nThere are several ways to create a new page:\n\nCreate a link to the page on another page, then click on the red link which appears\n\nBrowse to the intended location of the page, e.g. http://www.example.com/index.php?title=New_page and click on the \"Edit\", \"Create\" or \"Create source\" link.\n\nOn some wikis, a failed search for a page will contain a link which allows you to edit that page.\n\nSee also: Help:Starting a new page\n\nHow do I delete an old version of a page?\n\nOld versions of page data are retained in the database and can be accessed via the page history features. This is useful for reviewing changes and correcting or reverting undesirable ones, but in some cases, administrators might want to make this information unavailable, for legal reasons, or to reduce the size of the database.\n\nAdministrators can delete an old revision of a page by deleting the page, and then selectively undeleting revisions to be kept\n\nFor newer MediaWikis (1.14+), you can enable the core RevisionDelete feature that allows privileged users to remove single revisions from page histories.\n\nThe maintenance/deleteOldRevisions.php maintenance script can mass-delete all old revisions of pages and their associated text records.\n\nSee also: Manual:Removing embarrassment\n\nHow do I use oversight/delete revisions in the page history?\n\nSee: RevisionDelete\n\nYou can also delete a page, and then restore only the revisions you want.\n\nAre there any editing tutorials available?\n\nThere are several editing tutorials available, mostly on Wikimedia sister projects, such as Wikipedia. There are also markup references, etc. available on Meta.\n\nThe page Help:Editing pages on this site\n\nThe How to edit a page guide on the English Wikipedia\n\nHow do I view the printable form of a page?\n\nMediaWiki includes stylesheets which automatically style a page appropriately when it is printed; using the print or print preview function within your browser ought to render the page in a printable form.\n\nYou can also view this printable form using the printable version link in the sidebar under Toolbox or Print/export if using the Collection extension.\n\nHow do I use templates?\n\nSee Help:Templates\n\nCan I use media (images, video, audio, etc.) from Wikimedia Commons in my installed version of MediaWiki?\n\nYes, this is encouraged through the use of Manual:$wgUseInstantCommons .\n\nSee also: InstantCommons\n\nHow do I use a template as a signature?\n\nWhen you look at your preferences, you see a check box for \"raw signature.\" But the field will only take a certain number of characters. What if you want more?\n\nYou will need to create two pages, possibly in your userspace.\n\nCreate the first page (FIRST PAGE)\n\nGo to your preferences, check \"raw signature\" and put {{FIRST PAGE}} in the signature. Save\n\nCreate a second page (SECOND PAGE) (possibly a sub-page of the first)\n\nGo back to the first page (FIRST PAGE) and do {{SECOND PAGE}}\n\nGo to the second page (SECOND PAGE) and place the code you wish to have for your signature.\n\nIf you don't have this structure, you will still be inserting all your signature code into the raw code wherever your signature is used, because the software will insert \"SUBST\" in your preferences. You may not mind this, in which case you only need one page. If you want the raw code to only display {{FIRST PAGE}}, which looks a lot cleaner, then you need to use the two-page structure.\n\nHow do I add the sandbox functionality to my installation of the wiki?\n\nIn wiki terms, a sandbox is simply a \"play pen\"; a page which users can mess about in. This is an ordinary page created in the normal manner, and can be located wherever you like. There is no special sandbox functionality built into MediaWiki.\n\nUsers often inquire about the Wikipedia sandboxes, which seem to be self-emptying. This is not quite correct; there are a number of volunteers who run bots to clean these up and return them to a certain state at regular time intervals.\n\nSee also Extension:SandboxLink which will add a link to user's personal sandbox (i.e. a subpage of personal user page) to personal tools menu.\n\nYou need to install the SandboxLink extension.\n\nHow do I make my wiki serve all languages?\n\nTo allow user to switch the language of the interface, see Extension:UniversalLanguageSelector\n\nTo allow translation of pages and of the custom interface (like the sidebar), use the Translate extension; there's extensive documentation.\n\nWiki importing\n\nImporting from MediaWiki XML dumps\n\nSee: Manual:Importing XML dumps\n\nImporting from other types of wiki software\n\nThis section lacks information - please feel free to add it.\n\nImporting from other types of files\n\nThere are a variety of tools available to help convert content from HTML (and other formats) to MediaWiki markup.\n\nDeveloper and SysAdmin tools\n\nHTML::WikiConverter::MediaWiki - a Perl module for converting from HTML to MediaWiki markup.\n\nWikificator - a JavaScript MediaWiki extension that converts XHTML to MediaWiki markup.\n\nThe Edit.php and importImages.php maintenance scripts can be used to import text and images into MediaWiki.\n\nEnd-user tools\n\nwikEd - a text editor for MediaWiki that can import HTML (including Microsoft Word-generated HTML.)\n\nInstructions\n\nBrief notes on converting from Microsoft .chm help files to MediaWiki\n\nNotes on converting from Microsoft Office formats to MediaWiki\n\nTemplates imported from other wikis (such as Wikipedia) don't work for me\n\nYou probably need to install some extensions used on the source wiki, such as Scribunto , TemplateStyles , ParserFunctions or sometimes Cite . Also, make sure that you copied all site CSS and JavaScript required by the template.\n\nCustomising further\n\nI want to have multiple wikis, but only require registration once\n\nIf you're starting from scratch or you're switching from one wiki to multiple, you can use $wgSharedDB and $wgSharedTables to have all wikis share the user table of the \"main\" wiki. You can share other tables as well, as long as they don't contain any data dependent on non-shared tables or data specific to one wiki. See Manual:Shared database for examples and more information.\n\nIf your wikis are already established and you want to switch to a single sign-on, you can use the CentralAuth extension. It has a few more features than a shared user table, but it's more difficult to configure and it's tailored toward a Wikimedia-style setup. However, it is easier than attempting to completely merge multiple user tables into one.\n\nSee Manual:$wgRawHtml as well as Manual:$wgGroupPermissions and Manual:Preventing access .\n\nCaution: This can be easily abused to attack users\n\nSee Extension:Secure HTML and Extension:HTMLets for ways to make this safer.\n\nHow do I fix problems or add features to MediaWiki?\n\nThe basic steps to improving MediaWiki (that is, becoming a MediaWiki developer) are:\n\nInstall Git\n\nDownload the Git \"clone\" of the MediaWiki source code\n\nGet a server, a database, and PHP running on your computer (this can be annoying, so please ask for help if something isn't working)\n\nGet MediaWiki running on your computer off that Git checkout (can be annoying as well, so, ditto)\n\nFix the problem or add the feature you were thinking of\n\nEdit the source code of the relevant file(s) to fix the problem\n\nFollow Gerrit/Tutorial\n\nHow do I run a bot?\n\nSee: Manual:Bots\n\nYou might want to use the Pywikibot framework.\n\nHow do I change noindex nofollow\n\nSet $wgNoFollowLinks = false; in LocalSettings.php\n\nHow do I create a small wiki farm?\n\nSee: Manual:Wiki family\n\nThe OutputPage class includes an addMeta method which can be used to add meta tags. The RequestContext can be used to get the relevant OutputPage object.\n\n$out->addMeta ( 'description', 'This is a meta description.' );\n\nWhy...?\n\nâ€¦is the Help namespace empty?\n\nThe Help namespace currently ships in a blank state. It's up to you how much or how little help you give to your site visitors and whether this relates to other aspects of your site. Obviously you can easily link your visitors to help resources elsewhere.\n\nWe don't currently have a clean, internationalised set of help pages under a free license. However, if you want to copy in some help information onto your site, about how to use a wiki (a MediaWiki powered wiki) you are free to copy the Help:Contents from this wiki. This set of pages have been deliberately created for this purpose, with wiki-neutral information, and no license restrictions. See Project:PD help .\n\nâ€¦are some of my images not showing up after an upgrade?\n\nSeveral users have reported that, following an upgrade or a moving of their wiki, several images fail to be shown inline. The files exist, and the image description pages show a MIME type of unknowncode>/unknown and, in some cases, a warning about potentially dangerous files.\n\nTo fix this, run the maintenance/rebuildImages.php script from the command line. This will set MIME information for each file in the database.\n\nMediaWiki 1.21 and newer implements responsive images. Due to a bug, if the server locale is set to one that uses commas instead of dots for representing a decimal point, images may not render on some browsers/devices. This can be confirmed by inspecting a thumbnail of a medium or big image on a page with the browser tools, looking at the HTML code, and see if the srcset attribute contains commas instead of dots when representing the 1.5x value.\n\nâ€¦are all PNG files not being turned into thumbnails?\n\nAfter upgrading to a more recent version of PHP, it is possible a different MimeMagic.php function is being used to detect file MIME types, particularly the built-in PHP function mime_content_type, which fails to detect PNG files. Search the web for mime_content_type png for information on fixing this bug at the PHP level, possibly by editing your magic.mime file.\n\nSee File is corrupt or has an invalid extension for more info.\n\nâ€¦can't I download MediaWiki 1.43?\n\nMediaWiki 1.43 is in a development state at present, and has not been packaged into a general release. The code can be downloaded from Git if desired. Or, if you want the latest development version packaged as an archive, get it at mediawiki-master.tar.gz (GitHub).\n\nâ€¦doesn't this work? It works on Wikipedia!\n\nWikipedia and other Wikimedia web sites use the current version of the code in development; at present, this is MediaWiki 1.43.0-wmf.17 (21482f8), pulled from the current development branch. Coupled with the use of several extensions, this means that functionality between these wikis and your particular setup may differ.\n\nTo obtain the current development code, read Download from Git\n\nTo check what version a Wikimedia wiki is running, as well as what extensions are installed, visit the Special:Version page for that wiki\n\nYou may also be missing several Extensions that are installed on Wikipedia, see #Templates imported from other wikis (such as Wikipedia) don't work for me\n\nâ€¦do I get a 403 Forbidden error after setting permissions on my Fedora system?\n\nFedora enables SELinux by default. Instructions for setting SELinux permissions for MediaWiki are available.\n\nâ€¦do I get Installing some external dependencies (e.g. via composer) is required?\n\nMany hosting providers only handle zip archives, and we only provide gz compressed tar archives, thus the archives has to be recompressed before uploading. This should not be a hurdle, but it seems like some archive tools occasionally fail to include all files in large archives. When this happen the vendor folder is left out, leaving the user with the rather non-explanatory error message.\n\nUse a command line tool when recompressing the tar archive into a zip archive.\n\nâ€¦do I get logged out constantly?\n\nThis is probably related to cookies or session data. See Log in problems for information.\n\nIf this is happening constantly to all users, it probably means that caching is misconfigured. Setting $wgSessionCacheType = CACHE_DB; can be used to determine if caching is the cause of the problem. If that solves the problem, you should still investigate what is wrong with your caching configuration.\n\nâ€¦is it a good idea to keep user accounts?\n\nAt many times you just want to remove a user account out of the wiki either because it belonged to a spammer account or you just feel like it. The appropriate choice is to block the account or rename it if needed. Here is why:\n\nDo I just remove this row from the user table?\n\nRob Church posted the following regarding this issue on the wikitech-l mailing list:\n\nIf the user has made edits, then removing rows from the user table cause theoretical loss of referential integrity.\n\nNow, to be honest with you, I can't think of any conditions where this would cause an actual problem; \"undefined behaviour\" is the phrase we use.\n\nWhat I'd suggest doing, to be on the safe side, is running a couple of quick updates against the database:\n\nUPDATErevisionSETrev_user=0WHERErev_user=<current_user_id>\n\nUPDATEarchiveSETar_user=0WHEREar_user=<current_user_id>\n\nWhat this will do is cause MediaWiki to treat the revisions as having been made anonymously when generating things like page histories, which should eliminate any problems caused by these routines attempting to check user details from other tables.\n\nIf the user has caused log entries, i.e. rows in the logging table, or uploaded images, then the situation becomes trickier, as you'll have to start mopping up all the rows everywhere and it could become a bit of a mess, so if the user's done anything other than edit, I would strongly recommend just blocking them indefinitely.\n\nIf the username is offensive or undesirable, then you could consider renaming it using the RenameUser extension.\n\nAnother option is to give Admins the 'hideuser' right, and indefinitely block the user with the Hide username from edits and lists option selected.\n\nExtension:UserMerge is also useful.\n\nâ€¦is the number of pages so low on Special:Statistics?\n\nBy default, $wgArticleCountMethod is set to link. This means the number of \"Content pages\" on the Special:Statistics page only counts pages which include at least one internal link. This can be changed by setting $wgArticleCountMethod to any. Afterwards, run updateArticleCount.php and/or initSiteStats.php . (On Wikimedia websites, initSiteStats.php is run on the 1st and 15th of each month.) There might still be wrong behavior, see for example phab:T212706.\n\nAnti-spam\n\nHow do I use $wgSpamRegex to block more than one string?\n\n$wgSpamRegex is a powerful filter for page content. Adding multiple items to the regex, however, can be awkward. Consider this snippet:\n\n$wgSpamRegexLines[] = 'display\\s*:\\s*none'; $wgSpamRegexLines[] = 'overflow\\s*:\\s*auto'; [...] $wgSpamRegex = '/(' . implode( '|', $wgSpamRegexLines ) . ')/i';\n\nThis example code allows convenient addition of additional items to the regex without fiddling about each time. It also demonstrates two popular filters, which block some of the most common spam attacks.\n\nSee also: Extension:SpamRegex\n\nAre there additional ways to fight spam?\n\nSee Manual:Combating spam for an overview of anti-spam measures such as Captcha, content filtering and restricting edition.\n\nAnti-vandalism\n\nSee Manual:Combating vandalism for hints and suggestions on how to deal with wiki vandalism.\n\nWhere now?\n\nI've found a bug or have a feature request. Where do I post it?\n\nBugs and feature requests should be posted on Phabricator . See How to report a bug.\n\nI'm getting a strange error. What now?\n\nSee if it is covered by Manual:Errors and Symptoms\n\nTry to find out more about the problem, see Manual:How to debug\n\nSee the section below for information on how to contact developers and other knowledgable users.\n\nI tried that but it didn't work\n\nI had a problem, I came to this page and it told me how to fix it. But it didn't work, the problem is still there!!!!\n\nNine times out of ten this is because you didn't clear your cache. The simple test for this is to request a page that hasn't been requested before. Select the part of the URL in the address bar that contains the page title (e.g. Main_Page). Twiddle your fingers on the keyboard for a while, hit enter. Check if the problem is on that page too.\n\nMediaWiki uses both a server-side cache and a client-side cache, so clearing your browser cache is often not enough. See the relevant entry above for more details.\n\nHere are some other things to check:\n\nWere you editing the right file? Try inserting some garbage into the file you edited, does it break anything?\n\nA great debugging tool in this case is to create a file called phpinfo.php, containing only <?php phpinfo() ?>. Upload it into your web directory and invoke it with your browser. Check the document root and the path to php.ini.\n\nWere you editing the right part of the file? Did you create a duplicate entry in php.ini? Add new settings to the end of LocalSettings.php, not to the beginning.\n\nIf you created a .htaccess, are you sure AllowOverrides is on? Ask your hosting provider.\n\nI have a question not answered here. Where do I go next?\n\nIf you've exhausted the FAQ above, please try the following:\n\nCheck the other sources of help on this site\n\nSearch the rest of this site\n\nSearch the web\n\nDig into the source\n\nSee the section below for information on how to contact developers and other knowledgeable users.\n\nStill no luck. Where can I ask for help?\n\nSee the support venues listed on Communication .\n\nSee also"
