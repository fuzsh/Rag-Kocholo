        "text": "In a large plastic tub, place water, cider, 1 cup brown sugar, salt, cinnamon, cloves and ham and stir until dissolved. Place the ham in the brine and refrigerate overnight. The following day, take the ham out of the brine and dry well.\n\nFill your turkey fryer with the peanut oil. Heat the oil to 375 °F. *Cook’s Note: For a larger ham, use less oil as the larger the ham, the more liquid displacement there will be.\n\nPlace the ham carefully inside the fryer. There is a lot of moisture in the ham, the oil will bubble up intensely, so be careful and lower it very slowly. Cook for 7 1/2 minutes per pound. The ham will be cooked when it is 160 °F inside. Check it with an instant-read thermometer to make sure it is cooked.\n\nRemove the ham carefully letting it cool off and drain of excess oil for about 10 to 15 minutes."
