Isolated severe thunderstorms are possible today over parts of the coastal Carolinas, central High Plains, the eastern Great Basin northward into parts of the north-central Rockies, and northern Montana. ...Central High Plains/Central Plains... Upslope flow will persist across the central High Plains, helping to maintain moderate low-level moisture across region. Afternoon dewpoints are expected to range from the upper 60s in the southeast CO/northeast NM/western Panhandles vicinity to the mid to upper 50s across eastern WY. This low-level moisture will help support moderate buoyancy during the afternoon/evening, although some limited capping may linger. Thunderstorms are expected to develop across the higher terrain before then progressing eastward into the more moist and buoyant airmass downstream. Generally moderate deep-layer vertical shear coupled with the potential for some remaining convective inhibition suggest the severe potential will remain isolated, with damaging gusts and/or large hail as the primary severe risks. Thunderstorms will likely persist eastward into more of the central Plains, supported by moderate buoyancy and shear and the development of modest low-level jet. Isolated instances of large hail are possible, but the overall storm severity will likely be tempered by limited instability. ...Intermountain West into the Northern High Plains... Morning satellite imagery depicts upper ridging centered over TX covering much of the southern third of the CONUS and also extending northward into MT. Several shortwave troughs are moving through the westerlies within the northern periphery of this ridging, including a low-amplitude shortwave currently moving into ID and northern/central NV and another, more defined shortwave farther west off the northern CA coast. Eastward/northeastward progression of these waves will bring greater mid-level moisture and increased large-scale forcing for ascent, supporting the development of scattered to numerous thunderstorms across the region. Mid-level flow will remain modest, but a few more organized/persistent updrafts are possible. High cloud bases atop steep low-level lapse rates could result in a few stronger gusts as these more persistent storms form into clusters, particularly from northern/central UT into far eastern ID and far western WY and northern MT. ...Coastal Carolinas... Far southern periphery of an upper trough currently extending from Quebec through the Upper OH Valley will glance this region today as it progresses eastward. Modest (i.e. 20-30kt) mid-level flow will overspread a moisture-rich airmass (i.e. PWs over 2\") in place south of a front. Scattered thunderstorms should develop along this boundary by early afternoon then propagate toward and off the coast by early evening. A few water-loaded downbursts capable of damaging gusts could be noted with the strongest storms. ..Mosier.. 08/12/2024 CLICK TO GET WUUS01 PTSDY1 PRODUCT NOTE: THE NEXT DAY 1 OUTLOOK IS SCHEDULED BY 2000Z"
