A disaster supplies kit is a collection of basic items your household may need in the event of an emergency.\n\nMake sure your emergency kit is stocked with the items on the checklist below. Download a printable version to take with you to the store. Once you take a look at the basic items consider what unique needs your family might have, such as supplies for pets or seniors.\n\nEmergency Supply List\n\nEmergency Supply Kit Checklist Translations\n\nBasic Disaster Supplies Kit\n\nTo assemble your kit store items in airtight plastic bags and put your entire disaster supplies kit in one or two easy-to-carry containers such as plastic bins or a duffel bag.\n\nA basic emergency supply kit could include the following recommended items:\n\nWater (one gallon per person per day for several days, for drinking and sanitation)\n\nFood (at least a several-day supply of non-perishable food)\n\nBattery-powered or hand crank radio and a NOAA Weather Radio with tone alert\n\nFlashlight\n\nFirst aid kit\n\nExtra batteries\n\nWhistle (to signal for help)\n\nDust mask (to help filter contaminated air)\n\nPlastic sheeting, scissors and duct tape (to shelter in place)\n\nMoist towelettes, garbage bags and plastic ties (for personal sanitation)\n\nWrench or pliers (to turn off utilities)\n\nManual can opener (for food)\n\nLocal maps\n\nCell phone with chargers and a backup battery\n\nAdditional Emergency Supplies\n\nConsider adding the following items to your emergency supply kit based on your individual needs:\n\nSoap, hand sanitizer and disinfecting wipes to disinfect surfaces\n\nPrescription medications. About half of all Americans take a prescription medicine every day. An emergency can make it difficult for them to refill their prescription or to find an open pharmacy. Organize and protect your prescriptions, over-the-counter drugs, and vitamins to prepare for an emergency.\n\nNon-prescription medications such as pain relievers, anti-diarrhea medication, antacids or laxatives\n\nPrescription eyeglasses and contact lens solution\n\nInfant formula, bottles, diapers, wipes and diaper rash cream\n\nPet food and extra water for your pet\n\nCash or traveler's checks\n\nImportant family documents such as copies of insurance policies, identification and bank account records saved electronically or in a waterproof, portable container\n\nSleeping bag or warm blanket for each person\n\nComplete change of clothing appropriate for your climate and sturdy shoes\n\nFire extinguisher\n\nMatches in a waterproof container\n\nFeminine supplies and personal hygiene items\n\nMess kits, paper cups, plates, paper towels and plastic utensils\n\nPaper and pencil\n\nBooks, games, puzzles or other activities for children\n\nMaintaining Your Kit\n\nAfter assembling your kit remember to maintain it so it’s ready when needed:\n\nKeep canned food in a cool, dry place.\n\nStore boxed food in tightly closed plastic or metal containers.\n\nReplace expired items as needed.\n\nRe-think your needs every year and update your kit as your family’s needs change.\n\nKit Storage Locations\n\nSince you do not know where you will be when an emergency occurs, prepare supplies for home, work and cars.\n\nHome: Keep this kit in a designated place and have it ready in case you have to leave your home quickly. Make sure all family members know where the kit is kept.\n\nWork: Be prepared to shelter at work for at least 24 hours. Your work kit should include food, water and other necessities like medicines, as well as comfortable walking shoes, stored in a “grab and go” case.\n\nCar: In case you are stranded, keep a kit of emergency supplies in your car."
