        "text": "From today's featured article\n\nWorlds is the debut studio album by American electronic music producer Porter Robinson, released on August 12, 2014, by Astralwerks. Initially known for his heavier bass-centric production, Robinson became increasingly dissatisfied with the electronic dance music (EDM) genre, believing it limited his artistic expression. Following the release of his 2012 single \"Language\", Robinson decided to prioritize aesthetic and emotional qualities in his work, taking inspiration from media that evoked nostalgia for his childhood and integrating elements taken from anime, films, and sounds from 1990s video games. The album was promoted with four singles and later a tour (pictured) in North America and Europe. Worlds was well-received by most critics, who praised it as innovative and forecasted a promising career for Robinson, though others felt the record lacked coherence or was unexciting. The album has been retrospectively noted for its impact on the EDM scene.

Among these are four fire whirls, a type of tornado that develops from a wildfire. California's strongest tornadoes on the Fujita scale (or, after 2007, the Enhanced Fujita scale) have been rated an F3 or EF3, which has occurred three times – two F3 tornadoes in the Greater Los Angeles area in the 1970s, as well as an EF3-equivalent fire whirl (pictured) near Redding in Shasta County that developed within the Carr Fire in 2018. Although less common and not as strong as tornadoes in the central United States, there are regularly tornadoes in three regions of the state: the Los Angeles area, the deserts of Southern California, and the Central Valley. Most tornadoes in California are weak and short-lived, although some can be destructive or notable. (Full list...)"
