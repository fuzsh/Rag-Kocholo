        "text": "By Inga Aksamit & Aaron Owens Mayhew, MS, RDN, CD\n\nUpdated January 5, 2024\n\nThis post may contain affiliate links.\n\nChickpeas are versatile, healthy, and easy to love. You can eat them in dips, taco fillings, soups, and salads. They are a good source of carbohydrates and fiber. Furthermore, they are full of protein and make a complete protein when eaten with grains. This makes them a perfect foundation for plant-based diets. Most importantly, they rehydrate easily and taste great on the trail. With a few tips, you can successfully dehydrate or freeze-dry chickpeas to use in your favorite backpacking meals.\n\nWhat forms of chickpeas (garbanzo beans) can you dehydrate or freeze-dry?\n\nYou can dehydrate any plain, canned chickpeas. However, extra sugar and other ingredients may affect the final product if they are seasoned or flavored. Canned chickpeas do not have to be cooked before dehydrating.\n\nYou can also dehydrate raw chickpeas after cooking them at home. Soak them in water overnight to reduce the cooking time. Replace the water and simmer for 60-90 minutes until tender.\n\nYou can dehydrate whole chickpeas, but lightly mashing them first (just enough to break the skins) can be helpful. Fully mash them or puree if you’re aiming for a creamy, consistent product like hummus. Pureed and powdered chickpeas are well suited for cold soaking.\n\nHow do you dehydrate or freeze-dry chickpeas?\n\nStep One: Prepare the chickpeas for drying.\n\nDrain the cooked or canned chickpeas.\n\nLeave whole, mash, or puree.\n\nPRO TIP\n\nRemoving the skins before drying greatly improves the quality of the final product. If skins are not removed, they will separate from whole chickpeas during rehydration and create a “sludge.” The rehydrated product will have a somewhat gritty texture if the skins are not removed before pureeing and dehydrating.\n\nStep Two: Prepare the trays.\n\nSpread the chickpeas onto dehydrator trays using mesh tray liners or parchment paper. Fruit roll sheets may also be used.\n\nTray liners are not necessary if using freeze-dryer trays.\n\nStep Three: Begin the drying process.\n\nDehydrate at 145℉ (63℃).\n\nAfter an hour or two, stir the chickpeas to ensure even drying on all surfaces.\n\nIf freeze-drying, start the freeze-dryer and allow it to run its cycle.\n\nStep 4: The chickpeas are done when completely dry.\n\nThe dehydration process will take approximately 8-24 hours, depending on the humidity. They are done when they feel hard and dry to the touch. The chickpeas may crack open as the skins dry.\n\nThe freeze-drying process will take approximately 12-15 hours.\n\nStep Five: Prepare the dried chickpeas for long-term storage.\n\nFor dehydrated chickpeas, allow them to cool for 30-60 minutes. Then, package them in an air-tight container.\n\nFor freeze-dried chickpeas, package them immediately in an air-tight container.\n\nYou can grind dehydrated chickpeas to a powder using a coffee grinder or a bullet-type blender (optional). This may reduce the time needed to rehydrate.\n\nOnce dried, the chickpeas will reabsorb moisture from the air, so do not leave them out for more than an hour.\n\nTo lengthen the shelf-life of the chickpeas, consider vacuum sealing them in vacuum seal bags, mylar bags, or mason jars.\n\nYou can purchase a mason jar vacuum sealer accessory online.\n\nAlso, consider adding an oxygen absorber. Oxygen absorbers will remove any extra oxygen from your container.\n\nSign-Up & Save!\n\nSubscribe to our weekly newsletter & save 10% off Backcountry Foodie memberships.\n\nYour email is safe with us. We don’t like spam either.\n\nWhat is the yield?\n\nA 15-ounce (425 g) can of chickpeas provides about 1 cup canned, 3/4 cup dehydrated, and 1 cup freeze-dried.\n\nHow do you rehydrate dried chickpeas?\n\nAdd hot water and cover for 10-20 minutes for whole chickpeas.\n\nCold water can also rehydrate whole chickpeas, taking up to 2 hours.\n\nPowdered chickpeas rehydrate almost instantaneously with hot or cold water.\n\nHow long will dehydrated or freeze-dried chickpeas last?\n\nDehydrated chickpeas can be stored well for six months in an airtight container. Keep in a cool, dry, dark area.\n\nYou can store freeze-dried chickpeas for 10-15 years when vacuum-sealed with an oxygen absorber.\n\nSafety Considerations\n\nLegumes like chickpeas can be affected by a bacteria (bacillus cereus) that can survive cooking and cause food poisoning with vomiting and diarrhea.\n\nThis bacteria thrives at temperatures between 59 to 122℉ (15 to 50℃). For this reason, dehydrate chickpeas at no lower than 145℉ (63℃).\n\nHow do I use dehydrated or freeze-dried chickpeas in backpacking meals?\n\nDried chickpeas can be used in a wide variety of backpacking meals. They can replace freeze-dried meat as a protein, serve as the base for hummus (or variations like our Brownie Batter Hummus), or be enjoyed cold as part of a salad.\n\nHere are a few of our favorite recipes using dried chickpeas:\n\nDreaming about owning a freeze-dryer but afraid to take the leap?\n\nYou’re not alone! I droooled over Harvest Right freeze dryers for FIVE years before finally biting the bullet and investing in one. I’m happy to share that my unit has been worth every bit of the investment!\n\nBeing the number-crunching dietitian that I am, I’ve calculated the cost savings for every batch. Some time-intensive foods, like apples (washing, peeling, coring, chopping), are not cost-effective when freeze-dried at home. However, other foods like freeze-dried cheese can be prepared at home for a third of the cost of commercially dried cheese. The final product of home freeze-dried foods is also far superior to commercially dried foods. See the example of the blueberries below…\n\nHome freeze-drying also allows you to dry foods that would otherwise go to waste. I don’t know about your household, but we never seem to consume all of the produce before it goes bad. By drying produce instead of tossing it, my backpacking meal ingredient supply grows without having to purchase new commercially dried ingredients later. Reduce food waste and save money. Win-win!\n\nClick here to learn more about Harvest Right’s product. Feel free to contact me before purchasing one and ask whatever questions you have. I am happy to share my experience.\n\nWait, there’s more!\n\nWe’re here to make the meal planning process for adventures as easy as possible.\n\nBackcountry Foodie is your go-to resource for over 200 backpacking dietitian-created recipes and a one-of-a-kind automated meal planning tool.
