        "text": "We start by digging up the area where the dry well will go. We do this very carefully to make sure we don't damage anything. Then, we put it in the dry well, ensuring it sits in the right place and is stable. This part is essential so that the well works right and lasts a long time.\n\nWe also connect the dry well to the downspouts and gutters you already have. It helps your property handle rainwater better. By doing this, water from your roof will go into the dry well, stopping flooding and water damage around your house.\n\nWe put down layers of gravel and special fabric. It is to make sure the water can drain through without any problems. It also stops the well from getting blocked by dirt or other stuff. This setup is vital in keeping the dry well working well and lasting longer.\n\nWe fill the dug-up area back in once we've put in the dry well. We do this neatly and return the land to how it was before. It means your yard will look nice and clean when we're done, and you won't even be able to tell we dug it up."
