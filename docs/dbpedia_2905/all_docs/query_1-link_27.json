        "text": "Sandoz Receives FDA Approval for Eylea Biosimilar Enzeevu\n\nThe FDA has approved Sandoz's Enzeevu (aflibercept-abzv), an Eylea biosimilar, for the treatment of wet age-related macular degeneration (AMD). The approval includes both a 2 mg vial kit and a pre-filled syringe for intravitreal injection. The FDA provisionally determined Enzeevu would be interchangeable with the reference medicine as it is currently subject to an unexpired exclusivity for the first interchangeable biosimilar products. The FDA’s approval of Enzeevu was granted based on a comprehensive review of evidence, including extensive analytical and preclinical in vitro study data, as well as clinical results from the Mylight study, according to Sandoz.\n\nAutomated Standard Graphs for Refractive Surgery\n\nA new tool makes reporting outcomes simpler.\n\nAvi Wallerstein, MD, FRCSC, and Mathieu Gauvin, BEng, PhD\n\nCataract and Refractive Surgery Today\n\nIn 1992, Waring introduced the first standards for reporting refractive surgery outcomes with six graphs that show the accuracy, efficacy, safety, and stability of a surgical intervention.1 The number of graphs was later expanded to nine to address astigmatism.2 Similar guidelines were recently developed for lens-based refractive surgery, and the Journal of Refractive Surgery, Journal of Cataract & Refractive Surgery, and Cornea now require these standard graphs for submissions that evaluate refractive surgery outcomes. The AAO’s journal Ophthalmology also recommends the adoption of these graphs in their author guidelines.3 Adhering to these standards helps ensure that the results of various surgical techniques, studies, case reports, and series are formatted consistently and are readily comparable across different studies. Unfortunately, currently available web-based and standalone software solutions are often expensive and require manual data entry or calculations, all of which limits their widespread adoption. A lack of specialized, free software that can automate the production of standard graphs has hampered ophthalmologists’ ability to understand the results of surgical interventions empirically and hindered efficient comparative analyses in the field. In response to these challenges, we developed mEYEstro, a tool to simplify and enhance the accuracy, reproducibility, and standardization of refractive surgery outcomes analysis. SOFTWARE OVERVIEW Our aim with mEYEstro is to transform the complexity of refractive surgery data analysis into a seamless, user-friendly experience. Designed specifically for corneal and intraocular procedures, this tool offers automated generation of journal-standard graphs and robust statistical analysis within 30 seconds and with minimal user input. The mEYEstro software has been fully tested, and its results were reported in a peer-reviewed journal.4 Core Functionality The software currently produces 11 standard graphs that fall into four categories (Table). Percent proportions, means, standard deviations, effect sizes, and P values are calculated and displayed on each graph. All graphs can easily be exported as high-resolution images to illustrate scientific manuscripts and presentations (Figure).\n\nIOL Subluxation in the Presence of Retinal Disease\n\nSurgeons discuss how suspected retinitis pigmentosa would influence their approach.\n\nCristos Ifantides, MD, MBA; Cathleen M. McCabe, MD; and Erik Navas-Villar, MD\n\nCataract and Refractive Surgery Today\n\n.fluid-width-video-wrapper{ margin-bottom: -75px !important; } CASE PRESENTATION A 67-year-old man is referred for an evaluation after experiencing a spontaneous IOL dislocation in the right eye. Cataract surgery with a three-piece monofocal IOL was performed on each eye 7 years ago. Three days ago, the patient noticed a change in the vision in his right eye. He saw neither flashes nor floaters. Upon presentation, the patient says he has a congenital condition with bear tracks (ie, benign pigmented fundus lesions) that impair his peripheral vision. Based on an earlier retinal evaluation, he may have retinitis pigmentosa (RP). On examination, the patient’s UCVA is 20/50 OD, and there is no improvement on refraction despite an autorefraction showing +5.75 +4.75 x 16º. His BCVA is 20/25+ OS. The IOP is 25 mm Hg OD and 22 mm Hg OS. The cup-to-disc ratio is 0.3 OU, and severe pallor of both optic nerves is evident (Figure 1).\n\nReady to Enter the World of Aesthetics?\n\nWorking up to optimal care will give you the best chance of success.\n\nMelanie J. Denton Dombrowski, OD, MBA, FAAO\n\nModern Optometry\n\nOur profession has steadily expanded beyond its traditional focus on vision correction and eye health, and today, many optometrists offer a wider range of services, including aesthetic procedures. Ocular aesthetics is an exciting new area to explore, but diving headfirst can be overwhelming. In this article, I offer points to consider before you make the decision to add ocular aesthetics to your practice, as well as a slow-start plan to set you up for success if you do decide aesthetics is worth investing in. WHY CONSIDER AESTHETICS? The decision to incorporate aesthetics into your practice must include careful consideration of your practice’s unique value proposition and a well-designed plan for implementation. Benefits may include enhanced patient care, professional growth, and financial stability. Aesthetics is its own juggernaut of a field, highly competitive and foreign to most ODs, so this decision should not be made lightly. Enhanced Patient Care Certain aesthetic procedures can address concerns related to facial aging, which can affect patients’ self-confidence and overall well-being. Offering these services, while still being mindful of the eye, allows you to provide a more holistic approach to patient care. Professional Growth Learning about aesthetic procedures expands your knowledge base and enables you to offer a wider range of services, increasing your professional satisfaction and potentially attracting new patients."
