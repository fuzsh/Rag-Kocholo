        "text": "Who's At Risk?\n\nBrittle nails are fairly common, affecting nearly 20% of the population. They are most frequent in women and older adults.\n\nPeople in occupations requiring frequent wetting and drying of the hands or who work with chemicals are also at increased risk for brittle nails.\n\nHorizontal splitting of the thumbnails and big toes is quite common in newborns, affecting about 1 in 3 newborns. Fingernail and toenail splitting in children up to age 2 years is also seen, and it is thought to be because their nails are so thin. Thumb sucking can also be a contributing factor in nail splitting."
