        "text": "Hello, I am trying to build a WordPress website, but having an awful time with images. Seems that in more than 50% of the images I try to upload, the file loads, but no thumbnail is created. The browser becomes unresponsive for both admin functions and to view the page in a separate tab.\n\nWhen you search the gallery, the image is there, but without a thumbnail. And if you try to edit the image, the image does not appear in the editing window and you get a message stating “\n\nIf anyone can help or need more information, I can send you actual slides of the error message and how they appear on the screen (4 images) that may be of assistance in sorting this out.\n\nThank you.\n\nJust used the multi-file uploader and moved three files. The first two loaded and it said they crunched, and the thumbnails appeared, plus the thumbnails appear in the media library. On the third file, it showed uploaded 100% but did not crunch and no thumbnail for it in the media library.\n\nAny help is appreciated.\n\nHi there,\n\nFor what site is this? http://testosprey.wordpress.com/ ?\n\nCan you please try clearing your browser cache and cookies, and also reset your internet connection by unplugging your modem/router for a few seconds, and see if that makes any difference.\n\nAre you uploading the images via the Add Media button in the editor, or are you uploading directly to the media library here:\n\nhttps://testosprey.wordpress.com/wp-admin/upload.php\n\nNormally I’d ask you to upload screen shots to the media library, but you can also add them to http://snag.gy, and paste the resulting URLs here for me, then I can view them there.\n\nThe site is http://devel.ospreylinksgolf.com\n\nTried all suggestions you mentioned, clear cache, reset cookies, unplugged modem and router, etc and no change to the problem.\n\nI have tried both IE and Chrome and Safari browsers, tried on three different computers on two different networks, plus my Ipad and no change.\n\nI am using the Add Media button.\n\nI have four screen shots if you wish to have a look at how the problem manifests itself on WordPress. You can view them\n\nhttp://www.ospreylinksgolf.com/images/wperrors/Error_ScreenShot_1.jpg\n\nhttp://www.ospreylinksgolf.com/images/wperrors/Error_ScreenShot_2.jpg\n\nhttp://www.ospreylinksgolf.com/images/wperrors/Error_ScreenShot_3.jpg\n\nhttp://www.ospreylinksgolf.com/images/wperrors/Error_ScreenShot_4.jpg\n\nThank you for having a look. I am going to try to post the screen shots to the url you listed as well.\n\nhttps://snag.gy/JltuK9.jpg\n\nhttps://snag.gy/pkmVLv.jpg\n\nhttps://snag.gy/sFwMV0.jpg\n\nThat site is not hosted on our servers, so we have no control over your image uploads and no access to your site whatsoever.\n\nThat site is using the self-hosted WordPress.org software, so this can be anything from a problem at your hosting provider, to a database setting, to a plugin on your site causing a conflict. The best place to get help with that is the self-hosted forums where users will have experience with this kind of issue:\n\nhttps://wordpress.org/support/\n\nI thought that might be the case. Just for fun, I started a test site hosted on your servers and it uploaded without issue. So today I am calling my ISP to see if they can offer an explanation, and if not will probably bounce to your server.\n\nThank you very much for taking the time to have a look. You have given me a starting point and I appreciate that.\n\nThanks, my ISP is also hosting for me.\n\nI have posted on the .org forum, so we will see what kind of replies that garners. I am an extreme novice, but seem to love the headaches delving into this kind of stuff provides.\n\nReally appreciate your taking the time to look.\n\nPS, I had a quick look at your blog, stay dry! I am in Canada where we contend with snow, not rain this time of year."
