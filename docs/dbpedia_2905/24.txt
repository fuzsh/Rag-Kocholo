I've published an article on the blog and tried to share it on Quora.

I've set up proper og:image tags, and twitter card tags I've verified that using Facebook Open Graph debugger.

Unfortunately, sharing this article on Quora doesn't work as expected.

Quora, for a thumbnail, sets the first image in the content of the html (a logo), instead of grabbing the one specified in the og:image tag (article cover photo)

Below is the affected URL:

Notes

Facebook debugger do not return any errors nor warnings.

Sharing on slack/Fb/twitter works well

The image Proportions are the ones that FB suggests (1.9x1)

with JS disabled everything still loads the same.

Does anybody have an idea why is it happening?

Expected behaviour

Current behavior:

Technology used:

This micro project is written in Nuxt.js and metadata are server-rendered

is open-sourced: https://github.com/driggl/blog

Update

After a lot of debugging, I've found, that:

After writing the quick basic project in Next (React), I got the same issue.

Quora seems to ignore image meta tags on this page.

When I place the image that is loaded in the same domain, Quora can grab the thumbnail without issues.

When image is loaded from AWS S3 directly, Quora doesn't load it.

I came with a monkey patch:

Configure PROXY to load images from within the same domain the project is hosted on

Add 1x1 px image at the top of the html body so quora can grab it.

But this question remains Unanswered, as I don't see this hacky stuff as a proper answer.
