Featuring convenient dry heat, the three-well modular dry hot well by Vollrath is reliable, easy to use and maintains serving temperatures perfectly. Made of 300-Series stainless steel and insulated with high-density glass fiber, this hot well is equally durable and high-performing. The open-element, energy-efficient design uses a smaller circuit, reduces installation costs and provides comparable performance to higher-wattage elements. Easy-to-use infinite controls ensure accurate temperature settings and are detachable for remote mounting, while the flat flange creates a sleek, streamlined appearance. This hot well does not require water for operation, making it a popular, reliable choice.
