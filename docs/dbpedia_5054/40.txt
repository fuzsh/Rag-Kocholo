To me, Forest Lawn Memorial Park–Glendale is the most notable cemetery to visit in the Los Angeles area. The original and current flagship location of the six cemeteries in their chain, this location is home to a vast amount of notable individuals and continues to host high-profile services to this day. Each year, over a million people visit. In addition to the fact that so many performers and writers whom I hold dear are at rest in this truly breathtaking location, the art, architecture, and lovely landscapes are sights that are inspiring to behold.

Knowing the history behind this cemetery, it is not surprising that I am so moved by it. Dr. Hubert Eaton, the cemetery’s manager in 1917, is credited as being the “Founder” of Forest Lawn Memorial Park, largely thanks for his innovations of establishing the memorial park plan. In doing so, he eliminated upright grave markers in favor of drawing focus to works, both original and replicated, of established artists. Eaton was an individual who believed in a joyful life after death but felt that cemeteries at the time were “unsightly, depressing stoneyards.” As a result, he wanted to create a cemetery that reflected optimistic beliefs that mirrored his own Christian faith, wishing that his cemetery would be “as unlike other cemeteries as sunshine is unlike darkness.” He wanted Forest Lawn Memorial to be “a great park devoid of misshapen monuments and other signs of earthly death, but filled with towering trees, sweeping lawns, splashing fountains, beautiful statuary, and […] memorial architecture.”

Thanks to his philosophy, the six Forest Lawn locations contain roughly 1,500 statues, with about 10% of them being reproductions of famous works of art. For example, Leonardo da Vinci’s The Last Supper was recreated in stained glass at the Glendale location, while full-sized reproductions of Michelangelo’s David and Moses also grace the grounds. In fact, this cemetery is the only place that contains a complete collection of replica Michelangelo’s sculptures which were made from castings taken from the originals. The marble used for them was sourced from the original quarries in Carrara, Italy.

Whereas some art in Forest Lawn is religious, others are more secular and patriotic. Glendale’s Court of Freedom, for example, houses the large mosaic of John Trumbull’s Declaration of Independence in addition to a statue of George Washington. In the Hall of the Crucifixion, visitors will find a panoramic painting called The Crucifixion by Polish artist Jan Styka. It is the largest permanently mounted religious paining in the world, measuring 195 feet by 45 feet.

Furthermore, Forest Lawn–Glendale’s main gates are claimed to be the largest wrought iron gates in the world.

By 1957, the Forest Lawn Museum was established on the grounds, displaying a variety of art and artifacts while also hosting rotating art exhibits.

In addition to the stunning art work, Forest Lawn–Glendale has three non-denominational chapels, including The Little Church of the Flowers, The Wee Kirk o’ the Heather, and The Church Recessional, with each one being an exact replica of famous European churches.

The key architectural gem here, however, is the Great Mausoleum. Fashioned after Campo Santo in Genoa, Italy, it is one of the most highly sought after interment places within the cemetery. Only a portion of it is accessible to the general public, with a portion of it being the Court of Honor. Here, individuals are inducted as “Immortals” by Forest Lawn’s Council of Regents. The rest of the structure is private and only accessible to individuals who have a loved one interred there. This emphasis on privacy is not limited to the Great Mausoleum; there are many other private gardens throughout the cemetery that require a golden key, distributed only to property owners.

This article does not offer a full overview of each individual located here; rather, it is a “walk” through the grounds from my perspective, highlighting places and people of interest to me. At this point, I have not paid my respects to all of the individuals here and this list is far from exhaustive in covering the notable individuals here.

The first group profiled features individuals who are at rest in outdoor areas.
