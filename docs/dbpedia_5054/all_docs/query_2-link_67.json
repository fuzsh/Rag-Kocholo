        "text": "With a life that spanned times of war and times of peace, times of plenty and times of want, Roy McFarland was an extraordinary man to know and love. He was a longtime resident of the community he loved, and it has been said that he was one of the original “Grumpy Old Men.” Roy was a loving husband and devoted father who was blessed to witness his family tree blossom to include the grandchildren and great-grandchildren he adored. Although he will be deeply missed, Roy’s loved ones will forever hold his memory near and dear to their hearts.\n\nIt was great to be an American during the decade that we commonly recall as the Roaring Twenties. Innovation was leading the way to new technologies that brought us things like radios, washing machines, and refrigerators. This was also the decade when Ty Cobb and Babe Ruth created a love for the sport of baseball that remains to this day. Amidst this exciting time was the year 1928 when Roy and Enid McFarland were pleased to announce the birth of the baby boy they named Roy E. on June 14th in Mishawaka, Indiana. He was one of four children in the McFarland family as he was raised in the family home alongside his brother, Howard and his sisters, Madiline and Phyllis. While growing up Roy could often be found outside as he grew up fishing in the St. Joseph River by Uniroyal in Mishawaka. He also enjoyed hunting, and when sledding as a young boy he was sure to watch out for the horse-drawn milk wagon when coming down the hill! Roy attended Battell School in Mishawaka, and after his schooling he went to work at Ball Band in Mishawaka.\n\nIn 1945, Roy joined the United States Navy, serving as a fireman in the boiler room, which was a very hot job. When he had a few moments off, he often slept under the planes to keep cool. Roy always spoke of how the food was less than desirable. He never liked orange marmalade or raisin pie after being in the Navy since they served these things all too often while he was in the service. Chicken pot pie was something he never ate once out of the service since they had to pick the feathers out of it, and the maggots in the oatmeal pretty much turned him off to oatmeal as well. Occasionally, they enjoyed ice cream as a special treat.\n\nWith his military duties fulfilled, Roy was eager for all that life had in store. He went back to work at Ball Band, which is where he met the woman of his dreams. Her name was Pauline Conrad, and his life was never the same. It didn’t take the couple long to fall deeply in love. With a desire to establish a new life together, Roy and Pauline were married at the courthouse in South Bend on June 25, 1948. Together they welcomed three children including Lon, Kevin, and Leah into their hearts and home. Although work kept him busy, Roy made the most of family time. He and the boys went on fishing trips to Canada every summer. These trips were really something as they started out on a train and then get on a boat to be taken to a peninsula where there was no electric or toilets. They also needed to use flashlights to watch for skunks. Leah went along on one of these trips - and that one trip was enough for her! As a family, the McFarlands took a vacation out West in the station wagons and camped in Canada while one of the boys was still in diapers.\n\nThroughout his life, Roy was a hardworking man who was rarely one to be still. In addition to hunting and fishing, he enjoyed shooting trap and gardening. As a family, they loved spending time at their cottage on Burntside Lake in Ely, Minnesota. The natural beauty of the lake and the woods included their pet bear, George, who was always happy to make himself a temporary member of their family! During their retirement years, Roy and Pauline spent their summers at the cottage and their winters in Sebring, Florida.\n\nAll who knew Roy McFarland would agree that there was no one quite like him. He worked hard, but he also took the time to enjoy life along the way, and things were only better when he was sharing them with the ones he loved. Roy treasured his family, and he was so blessed to share more than 60 years with the love of his life. Deeply loved, he will be forever missed.\n\nRoy E. McFarland, of Mishawaka, died at 12:45 a.m., Tuesday, February 21, 2017, at South Bend Hospice House. Roy’s family includes his children, Lon (Vicky) McFarland, Mishawaka, Kevin (Linda) McFarland, Elkhart, Leah Serkes, South Bend; grandchildren, Jennifer (Doug) Webb, Matthew Serkes, Melanie (Jason) Scarabin, Valerie (Brad) Martin, Sean McFarland, Kyle (Kristen) McFarland, Ryan McFarland; step-grandson, Jason (Alesia) Kurz; great grandchildren, Parker and Ainsley Scarabin, Liam and Hadley Martin, Harper and Charlie McFarland; step-great-grandchildren, Jaxon, Breena, Jason Jr. and Samuel Kurz. Roy was preceded in death by his wife; parents; brother, Howard McFarland; and sisters, Madiline Carter and Phyllis Huys. Roy was preceded in death March 18, 2016. Family and friends may call from 10 - 12 Friday, February 24, 2017, at Thompson-Lengacher & Yoder Funeral Home, Wakarusa. Funeral services will begin at 12:00. Pastor Arlen Chochran, Hospice Chaplain will officiate and burial will be in Olive West Cemetery with Military Graveside services.
