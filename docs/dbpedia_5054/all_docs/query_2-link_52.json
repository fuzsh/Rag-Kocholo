(Note: There is a cemetery at this same location that is listed as CORY FAMILY CEMETERY, also)\n\nIn the August 29, 1985, issue of The Balch Springs News, the following was published in an article written by Marie Hughes:\n\n\"The COX Family Cemetery was on the corner of Lake June and Hickory Tree Roads on the southwest side. When Merle Redd worked for Dallas County in 1918 he was cleaning up the cemetery before the county widened the roads. When the fence was reset it was erected across the graves. Later the roads were wided [sic] about the time of World War II and all of the graves are under the road now.\"\n\nIn 1985 Marie Hughes and Merle Redd were both alive and living in Balch Springs. It is logical to assume that she talked to Merle directly to gain her information. Old census reports confirm Merle Redd lived near the area described. One of his sons, still living, told me his father had to quit school as a teenager and go to work to contribute to the family income, so it is believable that he did road work in 1918. Both Marie and Merle are deceased.\n\nThis previous information was contributed by Marilyn Kosanke.\n\n59-S CRAWFORD MEMORIAL PARK CEMETERY Exit south off of Elam Road across (Samuell-Crawford Memorial Park Cemetery) from Cedar Cliff past circle drive, just to the left before crossing the bridge across Prairie Creek, Dallas.\n\n86 81B-E CRAWFORD'S TORNADO GRAVEYARD 1856 Cedar Hill 75104 (Erroneously referred to as OLD PIONEER CEM)\n\nFrom Belt Line Road west, go 0.6 mile north on Main Street North and South Cedar Hill Road (the roads merge).

The adjoining graveyard was established when a tornado descended April 29, 1856, destroying the church, town and many homes.\n\nAugust 13, 1856, Robert Crawford, Cedar Hill's first preacher and school teacher, gave 4 acres of his land where the tornado victims were buried, to the Methodist Episcopal Church South, thus establishing the first cemetery in far southwest Dallas County. The 2-acre church site, sold by Milton Merrifield to the church in 1854, lies adjacent and south of this cemetery.\n\nSurrounded by hog wire fencing and cedar posts, nine tornado victims were laid to rest in a small plot with only piled rocks and Red Cedar trees to mark their graves. Those killed by the tornado were Mr. Berry, his wife and child, John C. Hart, his wife and child, Mr. Dickson, Jacob Allen's wife, Martha, and an unnamed \"Negro woman.\"\n\nThe church and cemetery land was first owned by early settlers, Rev. Robert Crawford and Milton Merrifield, then the Methodist Episcopal Church South, later by James B. Bryan and his son, Connie Bryan, and lately, by Dr. Franklin L.

The cemetery lies in the original abstract 463 of the George Floyd land grant from Peters Colony, per Survey 89-C on May 11,1853. The survey lines were gerrymandered in 1905. Key to locating the survey lines is the location of the spring in Floyd Branch - 20 feet west of the Highway 342 bridge over the branch.\n\nThe Cemetery is in the Smith-Elkins Survey, adjacent to the George Floyd Survey line in southeast Dallas.

They had two little girls. The little girls died. They buried them in a pasture and placed two ordinary field rocks at the heads of their graves. Then they moved on. \"The cemetery starts from there,\" says Fred Marsh, Jr. \"I have no idea who those people were or where they went or when it was. It was way on back..\" Harrison C. MARSH was buried near the little girls in 1882, and T. C. MARSH in 1889. Their tombstones are among the oldest and tallest in the patch of pasture that became their family cemetery.\n\nAn ancient chain-link fence surrounds the grave of McALLISTERS,\n\nVERBICKS, EDDISTONS, KENNEDYS, and GILLUMS, as well as the MARSHES. Its iron posts lean, its wires sag. The graves of Harrison C. and T. C. MARSH are surrounded by another fence of cast iron spikes, once elegant, separating them from the graves of their kin. The spikes are rusty now. Many years ago, the gate of the enclosure fell off and somebody leaned it against a hackberry tree. The tree grew around the gate and imprisoned it. Most of the smaller tombstones are cracked and broken. Mr. MARSH has tried to pick them up and set them back, but some are smashed into too many pieces to be put together again.\n\nThe stone of Elizabeth EDDISTON, an infant who died in 1882, lies in the grass, broken into three pieces. A jagged fragment of white marble, the words \"not forgotten\" still legible on its surface, props up the broken granite tombstone of Labolt KEIVER, who died in 1901, age 76. Mr. KEIVER, it says, is \"At Rest\". A plastic pot of artificial flowers and a half deflated balloon with the message \"I Love You\" in gay colors decorates the fresh earth of the new grave.\n\nTwo brown field stones, hard to notice in the shade of the hackberry trees, lie undisturbed. Anonymous forever.\n\n\"Who will take care of it after Fred is unable to?\" Mrs. Marsh asks,\n\n\"will anybody care?\"\n\nAdded June 5, 2004:\n\nhttp://www.dallasgenealogy.org/cemetery/marsh.htm\n\nAdded June 6, 2004:\n\nhttp://ftp.rootsweb.com/pub/usgenweb/tx/dallas/cemeteries/marsh.txt\n\nTopographical map showing location of Marsh Family cemetery here\n\n133 35P MARTIN VAN BUREN CEM S/E side of Lakeside & Gillon Streets, Dallas, Moved to Greenwood Cem.\n\n134* 45P MASONIC CEM 1109 Masonic, Dallas 75201.\n\nWas located in the Dallas Convention Center area.
