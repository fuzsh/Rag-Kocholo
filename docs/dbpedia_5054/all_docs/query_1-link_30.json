She was born March 22, 1925 in Towanda, PA, daughter of the late Andrew and Lillian (Ackley) Marshall and died Sunday, September 25, 2011 at Bethany Manor surrounded by her loving family. The one you could turn to, no matter what - Sunday we lost the person who always had our back, never said no to our request as she was on call for us 24/7; a listener, advisor, lender, chauffer, babysitter, always helping us out in a pinch. Where her children resided she had \"Lincoln will travel\" as it took her across the country; Florida, Tennessee, Virginia or Medina, she would come. She was a loving sister to her brothers, Andrew, Bernard, Jack, Billy and Hank Marshall (all deceased), who often spent time at the \"round table\" and nursed them when they were ill. They could count on her. The 7 sisters were only a phone call away as they discussed politics, CN and gossiped. Her sister Marie would send food, Mom would stay the night at Marie's, drawing comfort from each other. Her eldest sister Pauline brought Mom her favorite treats and visited Bethany for hours to spend time with her, even though Mom could not converse. True sibling love. Marie Gullo, Phyllis Vanderpool and Barbara Roman (all deceased), Pauline Reid, Betty Hart and Sylvia Laughlin all of Elmira, Norma Matthews of Ohio. While raising her children, Mom babysat and later worked for Arnot Art Museum, Danny Discount, Grandway and Notre Dame High School cafeteria. She loved the Nuns and Marie Storch, her friend. Washington Ave. was a safe haven to accommodate anyone who needed it. When Mom's declining health made it impossible for her to remain in her home, it broke her heart and tugged at all our heartstrings to give up the Washington Ave. security and memories. We want to thank our brother Larry for guiding Mom to Bethany so she was no longer frightened of being alone even though it wouldn't be possible to come back home, he was her light at the end of the day as he faithfully came to spend time and tuck her in nightly for the past 3 years. Debra baked for Mom and the staff and residents. Mom was never alone as she was visited everyday by someone in her family, and we were blessed to have her added caregivers when we couldn't be there. In the end, caregivers Diane, Larry and Alice were beside her family and shared our sorrow. The window was opened, the oxygen removed and Mom's spirit traveled on a beautiful Sunday morning to meet her beloved Dominic and her family waiting to greet their daughter, sister and friend. Until we meet again, you will be in our hearts. She was predeceased by her husband Dominic in 1990, former husband Lawrence Huyck, Sr. in 1990; grandchildren Lawrence Huyck III and Kayla Huyck and is survived by her children Judith (Mert) Voorhees of Elmira Heights, Karol Huyck, Lawrence Huyck, Jr., Lyn Girardi and Debra (Robert) Watts all of Elmira; stepson Michael Stirpe of TN; grandchildren Lori Fullwood, John Fesetch, Curtis Bush, Jr., Felicia Maxwell, Scott Bush, Missy Harris, Jan Marie Huyck, Larry Huyck IV, Thomas Guy Huyck, Daetina Clark, Nancy Fiscus; 37 great grandchildren; several nieces and nephews; dear brother-in-law Steven Roman of Elmira.
