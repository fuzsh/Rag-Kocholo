Published in The Beaumont Enterprise on June 17, 2011\n\nJulian Melvin Galiano\n\nJulian, a longtime Southeast Texas newsman with an encyclopedic recall of sports and a deep love of family and friends, died early Sunday at Beaumont Health Care Center after a long illness.\n\nGaliano, a French High School graduate, a Lamar University alumnus who also had a hand in naming the college newspaper the \"University Press,\" had suffered from a combination of ailments, but remained sharp in mind and gleamed when old friends visited.\n\n\"He was barely awake on Thursday when I went to go see him,\" said Al Caldwell of KLVI. \"I sat down and asked, 'Do you remember Irish Johnny Copeland?' We started talking sports and he went into overdrive.\" Copeland was an obscure boxer who was a Golden Gloves winner in the 1960s. But he was part of Galiano's encyclopedia of sports knowledge. \"He knew he was in his last days,\" Caldwell said. But they laughed about a trip to Ruston, La., to cover a Lamar game, a trip in which Caldwell found himself under arrest for unclear reasons. \"'You were aiding and abetting,'\" Caldwell said Galiano told him.\n\nGaliano had worked a couple of years for the Port Arthur News and was assigned to cover the Jefferson County Courthouse. Louise Wood was covering the courthouse for The Enterprise. She thought a sportswriter, which Galiano was, would be lost trying to cover news. \"He beat me on stories so many times because he knew everybody,\" she said. Rush Wood, former Enterprise sports writer, assistant sports editor and retired Lamar sports information director, remembers the first time he met Galiano, which was in the press box at a South Park High School baseball game in 1968 when a contingent of Houston sports writers had come to Beaumont to cover the Pasadena team.\n\n\"He talked a whole lot,\" Wood said. \"You didn't really talk to Julian. You listened to Julian.\" Galiano was an authoritative source on a variety of local sports. In the news story about NFL great Bubba Smith's death, Galiano provided some eyewitness history. \"He had incredible explosiveness off the line,\" said Galiano, who was in his teens when he saw Smith play at Charlton-Pollard High School. \"With Bubba, it was his quickness after the snap that set him apart from a lot of people.\"\n\nGaliano was proud of his close relationship with second-cousin Joseph Anthony Fiorenza, archbishop emeritus of the Galveston-Houston Roman Catholic diocese. In a 2008 column in The Enterprise, Galiano wrote, \"His spiritual foundation also has direct ties to his parents, Anthony Fiorenza and my great-aunt Grace Galiano Fiorenza. My Uncle Tony was a barber and his loving wife certainly epitomized her given name. Joe has always had such a wonderful pastoral quality and listening to him speak is compelling.\n\nI remember well his eulogy for my mother, who died in 1971. Those soothing words helped ease my grieving process.\" In his column, Galiano also wrote of three other second cousins who had become nuns in the Roman Catholic Church and served as healers and teachers. \"Faith, family and friends. My family has been so richly blessed in these attributes,\" Galiano wrote.\n\nGary Etie\n\nGary Nolan Etie died Jan. 19, 2012, in Austin. Gary, a 1968 graduate of French High, was born Feb. 25, 1950, in Abbeville, La.\n\nHe was legendary for his appreciation of music and his passionate idealism, and was fiercely proud of his Cajun heritage and family. His heart belonged to his partner in life, Patricia Hillman, and to his daughter, Marianne, of Austin. He is survived by sister, Roy Lynn Myers of Bolivar and brothers, Galen Etie and Roy Etie of Beaumont.\n\nJoe Perkins\n\nJoseph David Perkins, Age 64, of Lumberton, TX, passed away on Saturday, May 17, 2014 in Beaumont, TX. He was born to George Dorman Perkins Sr. and Ellen West on September 19, 1949 in Beaumont, TX.\n\nIn Joe's youth, he was a star athlete who played basketball, ran track and walked on as a baseball player at Lamar University. From ballet to baseball, Dad and PawPaw didn't miss many of his children's or grandchildren's events, and never failed to take his family on annual vacations. The attention and love he gave them will forever leave a legacy to be cherished. He loved hunting, fishing and playing golf with his kids and grandkids. A devoted husband of 41 years, Joe enjoyed eleven cruises with his bride and had he lived, would have cruised more. He never met a stranger, and would engage almost anyone in conversation. When in good health, he enjoyed attending church with his family. He had begun taking annual trips with his boys to Arlington to watch the Rangers play. He also supported the Astros and attended many of their games as well.\n\nDuring his two year battle with pancreatic cancer, Joe received a myriad of visitors from numerous coworkers. This was evidence of the respect he earned as a friend and coworker. Left to honor his memory are his wife, Cindy Perkins; daughter, Tonya Ortiz and husband, Joel; sons, Ryan Perkins and wife, Nacona, Robert Perkins and wife, Carrie; and four grandchildren, Tyler Landrum, Harley Perkins, Hunter Perkins, and Lyla Perkins mother-in-law, Frances Reeves; sisters, Barbara Perkins, Penny Bickham and husband, Shane; brother, George Perkins and wife, Bobbie.
