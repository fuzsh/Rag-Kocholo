Warden offers traditional funeral services with burials and graveside services. You can count on our classic details that make the service meaningful, like limousine services, a horse-drawn hearse, or dove releases. Also, look into our green burial options for the environmentally conscious. We also offer cremation services. You may choose a direct cremation without a service, or cremation with a memorial ceremony is a popular selection. You can plan a memorial service weeks or months after a cremation, whichever is best for the family. Our funeral planning team can also arrange an ash scattering service at the location of your preference.\n\nLife celebrations are a less conventional way to honor the life of your loved one, with the focus on light and casual atmospheres with music and dancing.
