        "text": "Forest Lawn – Hollywood Hills Cemetery, is part of the Forest Lawnchain of Southern California cemeteries. It is located at 6300 Forest Lawn Dr, Los Angeles, CA 90068, in the Hollywood Hills neighborhood in Los Angeles, California, on the lower north slope at the far east end of the Santa Monica Mountains range that overlooks North Hollywood and Burbank in theSan Fernando Valley from its southeast. The Los Angeles River courses from west to east immediately to the north.\n\nForest Lawn – Hollywood Hills is a park dedicated to the preservation of American history and hosts high-profile events such as an annual Veterans Day ceremony attended by dignitaries and other VIPs. Los Angeles Magazine described it as a \"theme-park necropolis\", paraphrasing Jessica Mitford, indicating \"Forest Lawn’s kitsch was just a sophisticated strategy for lubricating the checkbooks of the grieved.\"\n\nFeatures\n\nThe park features such sights as:\n\nCourt of Liberty\n\nThe Court of Liberty features statues of George Washington and Thomas Jefferson and the Birth of Liberty mosaic. At 162 feet (49 m) long and 28 feet (8.5 m) high, Birth of Liberty is the largest historical mosaic in the United States. It is composed of ten million pieces of Venetian glass and depicts twenty-five scenes from early America, from 1619-1787.\n\nThe Old North Church, a precise replica of Boston's historic church, from Henry Wadsworth Longfellow's poem \"Paul Revere's Ride\". The historical rooms have documents and mementos of the colonial period.\n\nThe Hall of Liberty American History Museum has a copy of the Liberty Bell and other exhibits. The museum has a 1,200-seat auditorium.\n\nMonument to Washington, a marble and bronze tribute to America's first president, created by sculptor Thomas Ball. Four of Washington's generals are honored in the memorial.\n\nLincoln Terrace\n\nThe Lincoln Terrace features a 16-foot (4.9 m) bronze statue of the 16th president by Augustus St. Gaudens, flanked by a panoramic mosaic depicting key scenes from Lincoln's life.\n\nPlaza of Mesoamerican Heritage\n\nThe Plaza of Mesoamerican Heritage has sculptures by Meliton Salas Rodriguez, of Guadalajara, Mexico. Salas used hand tools to first quarry, then work the native Mexican stone into precisely scaled, detailed replicas of artwork and artifacts that are representative of the Aztec, Huastec, Maya,Mixtec, Olmec, Teotihuacan, Toltec, Totonac, and Zapotec civilizations that preceded modern Mexican culture. A smooth Olmecan head, an intricateAztec sun calendar and a sinuous Teotihuacan bas relief are some of the sculptural features of the Plaza that are set off by crushed stone walkways and complemented by groupings of Mesoamerican plants.\n\nHistory\n\nThe first Forest Lawn, in Glendale, was founded in 1906 by businessmen who hired Dr. Hubert Eaton, a firm believer in a joyous life after death, who was convinced that most cemeteries were \"unsightly, depressing stone yards,\" and pledged to create one that would reflect his optimistic beliefs, \"as unlike other cemeteries as sunshine is unlike darkness.\" He envisioned Forest Lawn to be \"a great park devoid of misshapen monuments and other signs of earthly death, but filled with towering trees, sweeping lawns, splashing fountains, beautiful statuary, and... memorial architecture\".\n\nBefore it was a cemetery, Forest Lawn was a filming location used by directors such as Carl Laemmle and Cecil B. DeMille. The climactic battle scenes for D. W. Griffith's The Birth of a Nation were filmed there. The alternate names of the filming site are Providencia Flats, Nestor Ranch, Oak Ranch, Oak Crest Ranch, Universal Ranch/Universal City, Lasky Ranch, and Paramount Ranch until November 1927.\n\nWhen Eaton (self-proclaimed as \"The Builder\") made known his desire to open a second Forest Lawn location in the Hollywood Hills, the local residents protested vehemently. To circumvent the protesters, Mr. Eaton sent his staff to the county morgue to claim 4 \"John Does\" and buried them at the corners of the property in the dark of night. In the morning, the protesters had no power because, by law, the property was now a cemetery. The new mortuary and cemetery opened in 1952.\n\nNotable interments\n\nInterred or entombed in the Hollywood Hills cemetery are many famous people, particularly from the entertainment industry.\n\nA\n\nHarry Ackerman, TV executive producer\n\nRodolfo Acosta, actor\n\nEdie Adams, actress and singer\n\nIris Adrian, actress\n\nPhilip Ahn, actor\n\nHarry Akst, songwriter\n\nRobert Aldrich, director\n\nIrving Allen, producer and director\n\nSteve Allen, actor, comedian, writer, and television host\n\nDon Alvarado, actor and director\n\nLeon Ames, actor\n\nMorey Amsterdam, actor and comedian\n\nCarl David Anderson, Nobel Prize winning scientist\n\nErnie Anderson, television announcer\n\nMignon Anderson, actress\n\nLois Andrews, actress\n\nMatthew Ansara, actor and bodybuilder\n\nMichael Ansara, actor\n\nDimitra Arliss, actress\n\nRobert Arthur, producer\n\nJohn Ashley, actor\n\nGene Autry, actor, singer, and former owner of the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim\n\nLuis Ávalos, Cuban actor\n\nDoe Avedon, actress and model\n\nPatricia Avery, actress\n\nTex Avery, animator\n\nB\n\nArt Babbitt, animator\n\nLloyd Bacon, director\n\nParley Baer, actor\n\nDavid Bailey, actor\n\nBuddy Baker, composer\n\nBonnie Lee Bakley, murdered wife of actor Robert Blake\n\nJohn Ball, novelist\n\nHarry Barris, singer, songwriter and musician\n\nDon \"Red\" Barry, actor\n\nJudith Barsi, child actress\n\nGordon Bau, film and television make-up artist\n\nClyde Beatty, circus owner\n\nNoah Beery, Sr., actor\n\nNoah Beery, Jr., actor\n\nRalph Bellamy, actor\n\nRichard Benedict, actor and director\n\nSpencer Gordon Bennet, director\n\nLamont Bentley, actor\n\nMary Kay Bergman, voice-over artist\n\nFred Berry, actor\n\nGus Bivona, musician\n\nWillie Bobo, musician\n\nPriscilla Bonner, actress\n\nTom Bosley, actor\n\nTruman Bradley, actor and television announcer\n\nDelaney Bramlett, musician\n\nChet Brandenburg, actor\n\nMary Brian, actress\n\nPamela Britton, actress\n\nAlbert \"Cubby\" Broccoli, producer\n\nJoe Brooks, actor\n\nLeslie Brooks, actress and model\n\nWally Brown, actor and comedian\n\nKathie Browne, actress\n\nMona Bruns, actress\n\nEdgar Buchanan, actor\n\nMildred Burke, professional wrestler\n\nSolomon Burke, singer\n\nBartine Burkett, actress\n\nEverett G.
