        "text": "I had no plans at all! From the first call to Dale Groce, letting him know of Jerry's passing, he was at Carepartners Solace in 20 mins. He was greeting everyone, and his compassionate nature was overflowing!! He said they would be there, no rush to plan, just to let him know when we were ready. That made the whole process for us to plan just open up. We met, planned as Dale's professionalism was evident from the start. He listened as we talked, taking notes, and asked us to tell him about Jerry. Dale Groce and his staff were Amazing!! They helped us turn a very sad situation into a wonderful celebration of Life. We are forever grateful for Groce Funeral Home. 10 isn't high enough!\n\nI honestly can't say thank you enough to the amazing staff at Groce Funeral Home. I truly feel they have treated my family and I like we were part of theirs. They provided unparalleled support during what is an incredibly challenging time for anyone. I want to mention Al in particular. From all aspects of this process, Al has been extremely understanding, helpful and a source of comfort.\n\nWhen my mother passed my sister had to work with two Funeral homes and many people to make sure my mother's final wishes were met. Out of all the people Groce Funeral home was the most professional. Dale Groce is in the business he was ment to do he is kind, understanding and very professional our family couldn't of asked for a better person to work with in such a sad time for my family. I would recommend Groce Funeral home. Thank you to you all at Groce's.\n\nA class act as far as Im concerned no better place to help with your needs. I have just lost my Brother in-law and used a different funeral home.......will never make that mistake again. There are absolutely no worries when using Groce.\n\nGroce Funeral Home Inc is top notch. The morticians and staff at Groce are so very kind and caring to those who have just lost loved ones. They are very patient, and are not pushy when you are trying to make decisions about what to do during that delicate time. I would recommend to anyone.\n\nA sincere thank you to the staff of Groce Funeral Home for your gentle kindness and care of my precious sister, Wanda King Stines. Groce has helped with our family over the years in making sure our loved ones are treated with respect. A very special thank you to Trey for all you help.\n\nThank you so much Scott for your kind and compassionate service. The staff has been super easy to work with during this challenging time. Y'all treated my father as if he were part of your family. That will never be forgotten.\n\nWe had the most incredible experience with Scott and the staff. Their job is far from easy but they manage to make you feel like you are so special. They take care of your loved one like they were part of their family. Extremely professional but they have such warmth. They go over and beyond to handle a heartbreaking situation with grace , dignity and comfort. Honestly 5 stars are not enough!!\n\nThese are great people and very sympathetic towards your family during a loss of your loved one...... we have used Groce for everyone in our family. Thank you for all you do.\n\nGroce won me over when my friend had a stillborn and she was very young, unmarried and no money. They took care of the baby just the same. No one else (other funeral homes) would talk to her about helping. Since then all of my family goes there and that li'l babys' family as well.\n\nJonathan helped us get a glass heart made with my brother's ashes mixed in. On top of that he took time out of his busy day to get it to me. I know that delivery is not a normal service and I really appreciated it. Also the heart looks amazing.\n\nMy mom and I pre-planned arrangements for dad while he was in hospice. It was a comforting experience with no pressure. When dad passed it was nice to have arrangements in place and everything with regard to viewing and funeral service unfolded with dignity and ease. We appreciate the support of the staff and use of the beautiful facility.\n\nMy former husband passed away suddenly last year and Trey was such a blessing to me as he simplified that part of an otherwise stressful circumstance. Now, my brother's care is entrusted to them and I have no doubt that he is being well-cared for\n\nMy Father recently passed away. He had the forethought to pre-plan his own Funeral. He worked with Greg at the Lake Julian location. Greg and his team provided excellent guidance to help my Father put the plan in place. Last week, my Father finally passed on. Greg and the team at Groce helped us coordinate the entire proceedings from out-of-state. My Father was Veteran and I believe Greg's experience of being a vet himself, really helped to coordinate with officials to facilitate Dad's burial with Military Honors at the VA Cemetery in Black Mountain. My entire family was pleased with the Groce Team and we highly recommend their services for your loved one."
