        "text": "Take me to the cemetery and “We’ll hear the dead people talk. They do talk there. They chatter like birds… but all they say is one word and that one word is ‘live.’ They say ‘live, live, live, live, live.’ It’s all they’ve learned, it’s the only advice they can give. Just live. Simple! A very simple instruction.” — Tennessee Williams (from his play Orpheus Descending)\n\nWith sprawling, well manicured lawns, nicely tended gardens, shade trees and more statuary then you shake a stick at, cemeteries can be magical places and do not have to be considered morbid. They are places of history, places of remembrance, places where you can “meet” your idols, even if they passed away a century before you were born. They are sacred places that will put you in touch with your mortality and may even give you a life affirming jolt. Time is priceless and we never know how much of it we have left. Visiting the graves of the multitude of celebrities we have buried in Los Angeles is a unique and somewhat surreal way to pay homage to our heroes. Below is a partial list of area cemeteries where some of the celebrated are buried. Finding the actual graves can be like detective work, but there are a few internet sites that are very helpful.
