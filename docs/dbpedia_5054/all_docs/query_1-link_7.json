        "text": "To me, Forest Lawn Memorial Park–Glendale is the most notable cemetery to visit in the Los Angeles area. The original and current flagship location of the six cemeteries in their chain, this location is home to a vast amount of notable individuals and continues to host high-profile services to this day. Each year, over a million people visit. In addition to the fact that so many performers and writers whom I hold dear are at rest in this truly breathtaking location, the art, architecture, and lovely landscapes are sights that are inspiring to behold.\n\nKnowing the history behind this cemetery, it is not surprising that I am so moved by it. Dr. Hubert Eaton, the cemetery’s manager in 1917, is credited as being the “Founder” of Forest Lawn Memorial Park, largely thanks for his innovations of establishing the memorial park plan. In doing so, he eliminated upright grave markers in favor of drawing focus to works, both original and replicated, of established artists. Eaton was an individual who believed in a joyful life after death but felt that cemeteries at the time were “unsightly, depressing stoneyards.” As a result, he wanted to create a cemetery that reflected optimistic beliefs that mirrored his own Christian faith, wishing that his cemetery would be “as unlike other cemeteries as sunshine is unlike darkness.” He wanted Forest Lawn Memorial to be “a great park devoid of misshapen monuments and other signs of earthly death, but filled with towering trees, sweeping lawns, splashing fountains, beautiful statuary, and […] memorial architecture.”\n\nThanks to his philosophy, the six Forest Lawn locations contain roughly 1,500 statues, with about 10% of them being reproductions of famous works of art. For example, Leonardo da Vinci’s The Last Supper was recreated in stained glass at the Glendale location, while full-sized reproductions of Michelangelo’s David and Moses also grace the grounds. In fact, this cemetery is the only place that contains a complete collection of replica Michelangelo’s sculptures which were made from castings taken from the originals. The marble used for them was sourced from the original quarries in Carrara, Italy.\n\nWhereas some art in Forest Lawn is religious, others are more secular and patriotic. Glendale’s Court of Freedom, for example, houses the large mosaic of John Trumbull’s Declaration of Independence in addition to a statue of George Washington. In the Hall of the Crucifixion, visitors will find a panoramic painting called The Crucifixion by Polish artist Jan Styka. It is the largest permanently mounted religious paining in the world, measuring 195 feet by 45 feet.\n\nFurthermore, Forest Lawn–Glendale’s main gates are claimed to be the largest wrought iron gates in the world.\n\nBy 1957, the Forest Lawn Museum was established on the grounds, displaying a variety of art and artifacts while also hosting rotating art exhibits.\n\nIn addition to the stunning art work, Forest Lawn–Glendale has three non-denominational chapels, including The Little Church of the Flowers, The Wee Kirk o’ the Heather, and The Church Recessional, with each one being an exact replica of famous European churches.\n\nThe key architectural gem here, however, is the Great Mausoleum. Fashioned after Campo Santo in Genoa, Italy, it is one of the most highly sought after interment places within the cemetery. Only a portion of it is accessible to the general public, with a portion of it being the Court of Honor. Here, individuals are inducted as “Immortals” by Forest Lawn’s Council of Regents. The rest of the structure is private and only accessible to individuals who have a loved one interred there. This emphasis on privacy is not limited to the Great Mausoleum; there are many other private gardens throughout the cemetery that require a golden key, distributed only to property owners.\n\nThis article does not offer a full overview of each individual located here; rather, it is a “walk” through the grounds from my perspective, highlighting places and people of interest to me. At this point, I have not paid my respects to all of the individuals here and this list is far from exhaustive in covering the notable individuals here.\n\nThe first group profiled features individuals who are at rest in outdoor areas.\n\nWalt Disney\n\n(December 5, 1901 – December 15, 1966)\n\nBorn Walter Elias Disney. An American entrepreneur, animator, voice actor and film producer. A pioneer of the American animation industry, he introduced several developments in the production of cartoons. As a film producer, Disney holds the record for most Academy Awards earned by an individual, having won 22 Oscars from 59 nominations. He was presented with two Golden Globe Special Achievement Awards and an Emmy Award, among other honors. Several of his films are included in the National Film Registry by the Library of Congress.\n\nJoe E. Brown\n\n(July 28, 1891 – July 6, 1973)\n\nBorn Joseph Evans Brown. An American actor and comedian, remembered for his amiable screen persona, comic timing, and enormous elastic-mouth smile. He was one of the most popular American comedians in the 1930s and 1940s, with films like A Midsummer Night’s Dream (1935), Earthworm Tractors (1936), and Alibi Ike (1935). In his later career Brown starred in Some Like It Hot (1959), as Osgood Fielding III, in which he utters the famous punchline, “Well, nobody’s perfect.”\n\nSpencer Tracy\n\n(April 5, 1900 – June 10, 1967)\n\nBorn Spencer Bonaventure Tracy. An American actor, noted for his natural performing style and versatility. One of the major stars of Hollywood’s Golden Age, Tracy won two Academy Awards for Best Actor from nine nominations, sharing the record for nominations in the category with Laurence Olivier.\n\nMerle Oberon\n\n(19 February 1911 – 23 November 1979)\n\nBorn Estelle Merle O’Brien Thompson. A Eurasian actress who began her film career in British films as Anne Boleyn in The Private Life of Henry VIII (1933). After her success in The Scarlet Pimpernel (1934), she traveled to the United States to make films for Samuel Goldwyn. She was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Actress for her performance in The Dark Angel (1935). A traffic collision in 1937 caused facial injuries that could have ended her career, but she recovered and remained active in film and television until 1973.\n\nErrol Flynn\n\n(20 June 1909 – 14 October 1959)\n\nBorn Errol Leslie Thomson Flynn. An Australian-born American actor during the Golden Age of Hollywood. Considered the natural successor to Douglas Fairbanks, he achieved worldwide fame for his romantic swashbuckler roles in Hollywood films, as well as frequent partnerships with Olivia de Havilland. He was best known for his role as Robin Hood in The Adventures of Robin Hood (1938); his portrayal of the character was named by the American Film Institute as the 18th-greatest hero in American film history.
