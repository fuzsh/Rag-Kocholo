        "text": "Wembley Stadium: An arena of important games, history and magic. It is the English national football team's home ground and the largest football stadium in London. Every football lover should visit the overwhelming Wembley, located in the neighbourhood of the same name in the north-western part of the British capital.\n\nArsenal plays its home matches in Emirates Stadium in the Islington neighbourhood. It is your typical modern stadium you have seen plenty of times elsewhere. However, the area surrounding the stadium is quite special: Statues of club legends such as Thierry Henry and Dennis Bergkamp and remnants of the old, and more iconic, Highbury.\n\nAfter the opening of the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium in 2019, the stadium was directly recognised as one of the most beautiful (and most modern) stadiums in Europe. It is an impressive football temple where the details are not forgotten. The most beautiful piece is the gold cockerel on top of the South Stand. The ultra-modern home of the Spurs stands in contrast to the surroundings because Tottenham is one of the country’s poorest neighbourhoods and is, to say the least, not the safest area of London.\n\nFour years after the Olympic Games of 2012, West Ham United closed the gates of Upton Park for the last time and moved into the London Stadium. With the move, the football club lost a lot of its charm, but they are getting more and more used to playing in the Olympic arena, which is supposed to close the gap between them and the top six clubs. The stadium, which is not really a football stadium, is located in a nice area of Stratford next to one of the biggest shopping malls in England.\n\nDespite its name, Chelsea is not located in Chelsea, but in the adjacent neighbourhood of Fulham, one of the fanciest and most beautiful neighbourhoods in London. The blue stands are, as they are supposed to be, close to the pitch in the wonderful British stadium. It is a rather small arena for a club like Chelsea, but extending the stadium is not easy given the surrounding mansions. But we do not mind, if it was up to us The Blues would remain here for a long time.\n\nA bit further into Fulham, you will find the football stadium of Fulham FC, perhaps the city’s most beautiful football temple. With its monumental facade, beautiful ‘hunter’s cottage’ in the corner and perfect location along the Thames, the historic ground has everything. If you only have time to visit one stadium in London, go to Craven Cottage and walk through Bishops Park and the nearby surroundings.\n\nCrystal Palace’s home ground flies a bit under the radar, but secretly Selhurst Park is one of the capital’s coolest stadiums. As you get off the train in Norwood Junction, in the quiet suburb of South Norwood, you will feel like you have stepped out of the hustle and bustle of London. The old stadium is built onto a hill and the double-decker stand on Holmesdale Road immediately catches your eye.\n\nUnfortunately, Brentford’s former stadium Griffin Park, which was arguably the city’s most special home ground, no longer exists. Since 2020, The Bees have been playing in the brand-new Brentford Community Stadium, located in the west of London in Brentford. It is certainly not the most beautiful stadium from the outside, but inside it is surprisingly cool given descending roof and all the asymmetries.\n\nThe illustrious home ground of Millwall is located in the hipster neighbourhood of Bermondsey, which has revived in the last decade. Nevertheless, you will still find dark alleys and buildings that have seen better days around The Den. Something that perfectly fits the intimidating image of the football club of the dockers and factory workers.\n\nLoftus Road is the cosy and compact stadium of Queens Park Rangers. The ground is definitely not an architectural masterpiece, but the inside is quite characteristic given its double-decker stands. QPR’s stadium is located in the lively Shepherd’s Bush where many cultures blend. You can combine your visit with a day of shopping, because Westfield Mall, one of Europe’s largest indoor shopping malls, is right around the corner.\n\nCharlton Athletic’s The Valley is evidently located in a valley in the green suburb of Charlton. After the stadium was declared unplayable in the 1980s, the fans fought for a return to The Valley for years. In 1992, they finally had success and since then the club has been playing again in their nostalgic home ground.\n\nAn extra tip: the beautiful Greenwich, arguably one of London’s prettiest neighbourhoods, is nearby. From the top of the hill in Greenwich Park, you have a magnificent view of Canary Wharf’s skyline.\n\nThe photos might suggest otherwise, but AFC Wimbledon’s Plough Lane is a lot nicer than you originally might have thought. They practically always played on this pitch between 1912 and 1991. The club then had to move due to safety issues and temporarily played in Crystal Palace’s Selhurst Park. When the club was sold to a consortium at the beginning of this century, they heartlessly moved the club to the city of Milton Keynes. Nowadays, we know this club as MK Dons and the fans of Wimbledon created their own club which now plays in their familiar ‘home’ Plough Lane.\n\nLeyton Orient plays its home games on Brisbane Road, located in the eastern middle-class neighbourhood of Leyton/Leytonstone, where David Beckham was born. Brisbane Road is a stadium of dissimilarity: A brand-new main stand with modern facilities on Oliver Road and a nostalgic eastern stand where the paint peels off the walls. The highlights, however, are the apartment buildings in the northern corners from which the residents can enjoy a game from their balconies.\n\nAfter Sutton United’s (founded in 1898) first-ever promotion to the professional level in 2021, Gander Green Lane needed a renovation. The capacity was extended from 500 to close to 5,000, the artificial pitch was replaced by a natural one and the away supporters got their own end. The rather unique oval stadium has not lost any of its character though and still feels like the home ground of an amateur side.\n\nYou will find Barnet FC’s The Hive Stadium in the far north of London. It is the club where Dutch footballer Edgard Davids retired and started his coaching career. The Hive is a modern ground with striking black stands and bright orange seats in Barnet’s secluded training facility. The gates are open daily from 6 am to midnight.\n\nHayes Lane has been Bromley FC’s home ground since 1938. The club has been playing in the Vanarama National League (fifth tier) since 2014. The stadium, which has a capacity of 5,150, is located in a green area of Bromley, a southern middle-class neighbourhood which does not feel like metropolitan London. Bromley’s home ground, which has an awful new grey stand, is not worth a visit. But if you want to see a Bergkamp, not Dennis but his son Mitchell, play, then you could consider going to Hayes Lane.\n\nOn the edge of an industrial zone in the eastern neighbourhood of Dagenham, you will find Victoria Road. It is the home ground of Dagenham & Redbridge FC, which still played in League One (the third tier) in 2011. However, the old stadium, which is not a recommendation for the ordinary football tourist, does not appear to have once been a League One ground.\n\nClose to the last stop of London’s Central Line, you will find Grosvenor Vale in Ruislip, the home ground of fifth-tier side Wealdstone FC. You will not find this stadium in the travel guides either and can easily be skipped. The old blue-white stand has got something about it, but to travel to London’s far west, where there is not much to do anyways, is not worth your time.\n\nPark View Road is one of London’s nicest semi-professional football stadiums. Sixth-tier side Welling United and the amateur side Erith & Belvedere FC share the ground. Both clubs have a separate entrance, changing rooms and canteen on the touchlines. Behind one of the goals you will see the trees of Danson Park, whereas behind the other one, you will see the buildings on Park View Road and a bus stop where a red London bus stops regularly.\n\nThe Beveree Stadium is characteristic and has a mix of old and new stands surrounded by trees. It is the home ground of Hampton & Richmond Borough FC, also known as The Beavers. It is the only football club in the wealthy and picturesque Richmond Upon Thames, where many scenes of the hit series Ted Lasso were filmed. The majestic Hampton Court palace and its parks are nearby, as is the famous rugby ground Twickenham Stadium. It is a perfect neighbourhood to explore if you have already seen all the main sights in the city centre.\n\nDulwich Hamlet is one of the capital’s trendiest semi-professional football clubs. The club, which plays in beautiful pink and dark blue kits, fights against homophobia and fascism. During home games, you will see banners with leftist quotes all over Champion Hill in the hipster East Dulwich. The club is immensely popular and more and more people find their way to Champion Hill.\n\nThere are tens of other smaller football stadiums amateur sides use in London. Most of them are not that remarkable, but there are some which are worth visiting if you have the time or are nearby. For example, the Queen Elizabeth II Stadium of Enfield Town, Enfield & Haringey and New Salimis. The stadium is a grade II listed building with a stunning art-deco stand from 1953. King George’s Field, home ground of the Corinthian Casuals, is in a unique location next to a railroad, which can make for some great pictures. Chelsea’s women and academy teams now play in Kingsmeadow Stadium, the former home ground of AFC Wimbledon. And Imperial Fields, the stadium of Kingstonian FC and Tooting & Mitcham FC, has beautiful terracing with a small roof the size of an 18-yard box and a modern main stand."
