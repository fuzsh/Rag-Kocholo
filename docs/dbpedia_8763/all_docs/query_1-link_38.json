        "text": "Selhurst - SE25\n\nSelhurst, situated to the north of Croydon between Thornton Heath and Norwood, lies 11 miles from the centre of London and 12.5 miles from the M25. Although situated an easy bus ride from the busy retail centre of Croydon, Selhurst has its own bustling, multicultural community of small independent shops, supermarkets and restaurants, which can largely be found lining the main Whitehorse and Selhurst roads.\n\nSelsdon - CR2\n\nSelsdon, lies between Sanderstead and Forestdale, it is 15 miles from the centre of London and only 8 miles from the M25. The busy high street has a large number of shops and several banks, restaurants and pubs. Although no train service exists, there are frequent bus services to the nearby town centres of Croydon and Bromley. Sanderstead station lies only a brief drive away. Housing is predominantly semi-detached and post 1930's surrounding the high street, although larger detached properties lie to the south towards Warlingham and to the north towards South Croydon. Property between Selsdon and Forestdale consists of smaller 1960's and 70's built houses and flats laid out in cul-de-sacs.\n\nSeven Sisters - N15\n\nIt may not look too pleasant around the tube, but walk for 3/4 minutes to the residential streets and the houses are ideal for first time buyers and the streets are quiet.\n\nShad Thames - SE1, SE16\n\nA forgotten area after the docks declined in the 1970's, now rejuvenated with riverside flats and apartments and the arrival of the Jubilee Line. Trendy bars, restaurants and shops lie east of Tower Bridge in Shad Thames. Rotherhithe remains the focus for much of the riverside development. Plush apartments and converted warehouses draw the attentions of the city set, whilst Bermondsey still retains a reminder of its past with several scruffy council estates. Some Victorian cottages and terraces remain further inland.\n\nShepherds Bush - W12\n\nLarge shopping centre and lively local market. Numerous bars and restaurants. Nearest Park - Ravenscourt Park\n\nShooters Hill - SE18\n\nSoutheastern Suburb. Handy for Millenium Dome, the building which can still be viewed.\n\nShoreditch - N1\n\nHandy for the City.

Good road access to Southeast and M25 orbital motorway\n\nSipson - UB7\n\nSoho - W1\n\nSoho is not as seamy as it used to be, although if you look hard..... The area now attracts designers and artists, authors and media-types to a vibrant, cosmopolitan scene. Plenty of restaurants and lively bars.

Smart multi storey stucco houses off Old Brompton Road and Gloucester Road, many of which have been converted into flats. Larger houses around the Fulham and Brompton Roads all of which command an equally large price. More modest homes can be found to the north of the Fulham Road. A plentiful supply of smart shops and restaurants.\n\nSouth Norwood - SE25\n\nCommercial properties, warehouses and small businesses sit side-by-side amidst tight roads of Victorian and 1960's built terraced housing. As you climb the hill along the Whitehorse Road towards Norwood from Croydon, properties increase in size with neat rows of Victorian and mid-war semis\n\nSouth Tottenham - N15\n\nSouthall - UB1\n\nCulturally diverse, lively area with restaurants and bars that reflect the multi-ethnic character.

Convenient for M1 giving access to North\n\nStepney Green - E1\n\nStepney is noted for its centuries old riverside pubs and new luxury flats in former warehouses.

There are some popular local eateries, though many make the very small journey to nearby Harrow.\n\nThe area is spoilt for choice when it comes to parks and green spaces, and a popular area for sports with the Vale Farm sports centre close by. It's overall got a good villagey feel and is only 20 minutes from the centre of town.\n\nProperty here is from a variety of periods. The mainstay is the semidetached house, with a good spread of midwar houses, but some modern blocks and purpose built developments as well. Most of the houses here are whole, but there are some conversions; they're set in leafy, very wide streets that are mostly quiet and safe.\n\nSurbiton - KT6\n\nSouth Western suburbia\n\nSurrey Quays - SE16\n\nExciting modern redevelopment of Docklands waterfront area.
