They also now play at the 62,500 capacity London Stadium, having left the Boleyn Ground in 2016.\n\nWest Ham have certainly been one of the more impressive teams in recent years having achieved European football over the past two seasons with 6th and 7th-placed finishes in the Premier League under David Moyes. Last season, they reached the semi-finals of the UEFA Europa League, and will look to continue their rise up the league table in 2022/23. With the likes of Declan Rice and Jarrod Bowen in their side, anything is possible for the Hammers."
