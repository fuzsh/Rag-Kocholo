        "text": "Football has been played in London for nearly a thousand years, and it was in 1863, in the Freemasons' Tavern in the centre of England's capital, that the Football Association was founded and the modern game established.\n\nNow, 150 years on, how many football teams in London are there? How many are in the Premier League, the Football League and non-league, and which area of London has the most top sides?\n\nMoreover, London has, over the years, become a powerhouse of football, hosting world-class stadiums, a typical example being Wembley.\n\nThat is not to mention that London is home to some of the best clubs/teams that continue to redefine English football.\n\nEverything you need to know is belowâ€¦\n\nLondon football teams map\n\nThe most comprehensive map of London football teams is made by The London Football Guide, and you can find it here.\n\nIn the above map, you'll find a stunning 134 teams, ranging from the Premier League right down into the grassroots game.\n\nFrom the National League South upwards (sixth tier), there are a total of 20 football teams in London.\n\nFootball teams in London FAQs\n\nNow, to best answer the question regarding the number of football teams in London, we break everything down into sections starting from the Premier League to the lower tiers.\n\nHow many Premier League teams are in London?\n\nThere are seven Premier League teams in London: Arsenal, Brentford, Chelsea, Crystal Palace, Fulham, Tottenham Hotspur, West Ham United.\n\nHowever, based on the argument of fans, it is not easy to say which is the best London football team unless we dig deeper into history. Arsenal has enjoyed great success recently, finishing second in the Premier League, so the Gunners are currently and arguably the best London-based football club.\n\nTottenham and West Ham follow closely, thanks to their perennial presence in the English top flight and party due to the financial power the teams have wielded in recent years.\n\nHow many Championship teams are in London?\n\nThere are two Championship teams in London: Millwall and Queens Park Rangers. While the two teams did not have a good campaign in 2023/24, the fact that they survived the drop means the new season of 2024/25 could come with a ray of hope for both of them.\n\nMillwall were at risk of relegation but a tight race and a spirited fight toward the end of the 2023/24 season saw them survive the drop. Millwall won their last five games of the 2023/24 season, a success they attributed to the appointment of a new coach, Neil Harris. The London-based Championship football club also improved defensively, so fans expect a better performance in the upcoming season.\n\nMillwall's home stadium is The Den, which has a seating capacity of at least 20,000. The London-based football club was founded on 1 January 1885.\n\nQPR, another London-based Championship club, was founded on 1 January 1882. The current head coach is Spanish tactician Martis Cifuentes, who was appointed in October 2023 to rescue QPR's troubled season. Three wins in the final three games of 2023/24 came with a stroke of luck for the Queens, who survived relegation.\n\nQPR plays its games at Loftus Stadium in London, a venue with a seating capacity of 18,500. On the other hand, Millwall stage their home games at The Den, a football stadium with a capacity of 20,146.\n\nHow many League One teams are in London?\n\nThere are two League One teams in London: Charlton Athletic and Leyton Orient. Charlton survived relegation last season as they put up a spirited fight in the final games of the 2023/24 season.\n\nThey play their home games at The Valley, a stadium that has a capacity of 27,111. On the flip side, Leyton Orient stage their home matches at Matchroom Stadium, which has a capacity of 9271.\n\nTactician Nathan Jones from Wales is the current head coach of Charlton, a tactician who took over the reigns at Matchoom Stadium halfway through 2023/24 to rescue the team from relegation.\n\nHow many League Two teams are in London?\n\nThere are two League Two teams in London: AFC Wimbledon and Sutton United. AFC Wimbledon had a good run in the 2023/24 but were unable to secure promotion, so they remain in the division for the 2024/25 season. AFC Wimbledon play their home matches at Plough Lane, which has a capacity of 9,300.\n\nOn the other hand, Sutton had a terrible run in the 2023/24 season as a consequence of which they were relegated from League Two to the National League. Bromley's exit from League Two means they have been replaced by two more London-based football clubs promoted from the National League namely Barnet, and Bromley.\n\nBromley's head coach is currently Andy Woodman, a long-serving tactician since March 2021. Bromley play their home matches at Hayes Lane, which has a seating capacity of 5,000.\n\nHow many National League teams are in London?\n\nSutton's relegation to the National League means they join Dagenham & Redbridge and Wealdstone as London-based clubs in the English National League.\n\nHow many National League South teams are in London?\n\nThere are three National League South teams in London: Dulwich Hamlet, Hampton & Richmond Borough, and Welling United.\n\nHow many North London football clubs?\n\nSeven teams are in North London, which is most famous for the rivalry between Premier League heavyweights Arsenal and Tottenham.\n\nList of football teams in North London: Arsenal, Tottenham Hotspur; Barnet; Enfield Town, Haringey Borough, Wingate & Finchley; Hendon.\n\nHow many East London football clubs?\n\nDefined by the bitter and often violent clashes of West Ham and Millwall, East London has a total of six teams from the seventh tier upwards.\n\nHere is a list of football teams in East London: West Ham United, Millwall, Charlton Athletic, Dagenham & Redbridge, Welling United, and Hornchurch.\n\nHow many South London football clubs?\n\nIt's a hotbed of footballing talent and a huge contributor to the Premier League and English national team in terms of players produced, but South London is the least successful area of the capital in terms of trophies. Nevertheless, there are plenty of teams. Nine can be found from the seventh tier up.\n\nList of football teams in South London: Crystal Palace, AFC Wimbledon, Sutton United, Bromley, Dulwich Hamlet, Carshalton Athletic, Corinthian-Casuals, Cray Wanderers, Kingstonian.\n\nHow many West London football clubs?\n\nThe dominant force for Premier League sides, with three, and there are nine in total in West London.\n\nList of football teams in West London: Brentford, Chelsea, Fulham; Queens Park Rangers, Wealdstone, Hampton & Richmond Borough, Harrow Borough, Hayes & Yeading United."
