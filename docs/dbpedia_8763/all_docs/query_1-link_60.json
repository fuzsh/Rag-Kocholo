Yet, some have dissolved during the years. Some clubs of great historical significance that no longer exists are presented below.\n\nQueen’s Park. Founded in 1868 and by that being Scotland’s oldest football club. Characterized by a passing game opposed to the dribbling game practiced by English teams. In need for more opponents, Queen’s Park joined the FA in 1870, and from that adopted to the different kind of offside rule that was practiced by the FA. When the first national matches between Scotland and England was played, the Scottish side was represented by Queen’s Park. The club did exhibition tours in Scotland and was important for the early development of the game.\n\nDarwen FC. Founded in 1870 as one of the early Lancashire clubs. Dissolved in 2009 after bankruptcy, but was reconstituted as AFC Darwen. The club was a part of the early English football history and marked the shift when clubs with working-class background started to become significant. They played in The Combination 1888-1889 and Football Alliance 1889-1891 before being a member of the Football League in 1891. They became the first winner of Lancashire Senior Cup in 1880.\n\nAfter 1899, however, Darwen would reside in non-professional leagues. The best result in Division 1 was a 14th place in 1892 and the best result in FA Cup was the semi-finals in 1881.\n\nAccrington FC. The English Accrington Football Club was founded in 1878. The club was thrown out from FA in 1883 after using a paid player (only amateurs were allowed at the time). Was one of the teams in the English Football League when it started in 1888 and reached a seventh place that season. Accrington played in the league five seasons, but when relegated to the second division, the club decided to leave the league all together and a few years later the club was dissolved. Accrington FC should not be confused with Accrington Stanley FC.\n\nBlackburn Olympic. Less known than Blackburn Rovers is Blackburn Olympic that existed from 1877 to 1889. Blackburn Olympic won the FA Cup in 1883."
