        "text": "Rush Green Training Ground is the current training centre of West Ham United.\n\nIt’s situated in the London Borough of Barking and Dagenham. The club moved from Chadwell Heath and made it their main headquarters in 2015.\n\nThe facility features numerous pitches and some impressive facilities where the first team trains.\n\nWest Ham training ground name\n\nWest Ham United‘s training ground, Rush Green, got its name from the street where it is located in the London Borough of Barking and Dagenham.\n\nThe name ‘Rush Green’ is believed to have originated from the medieval English word ‘risch’, meaning rush or reed, which grew in abundance in the area’s marshy grounds.\n\nThe word ‘green’ refers to the open spaces or fields in the area.\n\nHow many pitches are there at Rush Green Training Centre?\n\nThe Rush Green Training Centre is an impressive site, featuring state-of-the-art amenities to help the team prepare for their games and maintain their fitness.\n\nOne of the key features of Rush Green is the several full-sized outdoor football pitches. The facility also has a 3G artificial turf pitch that provides a consistent playing surface in all weather conditions.\n\nIn addition to these outdoor pitches, the training centre has an indoor sports hall, hydrotherapy pool, medical and physiotherapy rooms, and a gymnasium. These facilities ensure that the players have access to everything they need to train, stay fit, and recover from injuries.\n\nThe club has invested heavily in upgrading Rush Green’s facilities over the years. For example, the installation of a hybrid pitch surface has allowed the team to train in a range of conditions.\n\nThe facility’s medical facilities are also top-notch, featuring the latest equipment and staffed by highly trained professionals.\n\nWhere did West Ham train before Rush Green Training Centre?\n\nBefore the Rush Green Training Centre, West Ham United trained at several different locations.\n\nThe club’s first-ever training ground was at the Memorial Grounds in West Ham. They trained here from the late 19th century until the early 20th century.\n\nIn the 1950s and 1960s, West Ham United trained at the Boleyn Ground, the club’s former stadium. This was situated in East London. However, due to limited space and the proximity of local residents, training here was not always ideal.\n\nIn 2015, West Ham moved three miles from their previous Chadwell Heath base in east London to Rush Green.\n\nPlans to develop West Ham training ground\n\nOver the last few years, multiple planning applications have been applied for Rush Green,\n\nIn August 2021, the club submitted a fresh proposal to build a new training ground building, after the license previously granted by the local council lapsed.\n\nThankfully for the Irons, this proposal was approved in October of that year.\n\nThe work was set to be completed in September 2022. However, the changes are yet to be publicly unveiled."
