Park Lane approaches the stadium from the east, Church Road from the West, and the Tottenham High Road from the north and south.\n\nParking\n\nPublic transport is generally considered the best way to reach the stadium on a matchday as there is a lack of nearby parking options. There are no stadium car parks that fans can use.\n\nThere is also a controlled residents’ parking zone around the stadium area, so if you're driving please take care to ensure you are not parked in an area where a permit is required."
