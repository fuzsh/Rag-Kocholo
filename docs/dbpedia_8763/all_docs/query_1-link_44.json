        "text": "Seven of the 20 Premier League teams call London home, the largest allocation of capital city teams since the 1994-95 season.\n\nPremier League odds have Arsenal as the most likely London team to win the title (+1000), while Tottenham (+1600) and Chelsea (+3300) round out the top three.\n\nThe number of London-based teams can fluctuate each season, as the bottom three automatically drop a division into the Championship.\n\nEach season, the three best Championship teams get promoted to the Premier League, so the number of teams from London is ever-fluid.\n\nFour things are guaranteed in London: rain and Arsenal, Chelsea, and Tottenham competing in the Premier League. They’re the only three London-based teams that have played in the Premier League every season since its 1992-93 inception.\n\nHow Many Premier League Teams Are in London?\n\nThere are seven London-based teams for the 2022-23 Premier League season, including Arsenal, Chelsea, Tottenham, West Ham, Crystal Palace, Fulham, and Brentford.\n\nThe only other time seven teams from London competed in the Premier League was in 1994-95. That season saw Tottenham, Queens Park Rangers, Arsenal, Chelsea, Wimbledon, West Ham, and Crystal Palace take part in England’s elite division.\n\nThe last London team to win the Premier League was Chelsea in 2016-17. Chelsea and Arsenal are the only two London teams to win the Premier League in its 30-year history.\n\n7. Chelsea\n\nLocation: West London\n\nStadium: Stamford Bridge\n\nSurrounding Communities: Chelsea, Fulham, West Brompton\n\nYear Founded: 1905\n\nChelsea has won the Premier League five times and is the last London team to win the division. They also have the oldest active stadium in the Premier League, which opened in 1877.\n\nThe Blues recently fired manager Thomas Tuchel and hired Graham Potter to replace him. In terms of London teams, they are the third favorites to win the 2022-23 Premier League (+3300). However, their poor start has already put them in an unenviable position.\n\n6. Crystal Palace\n\nLocation: South London (Croydon)\n\nStadium: Selhurst Park\n\nSurrounding Communities: Thornton Heath, Anerly, Addiscombe\n\nYear Founded: 1861\n\nCrystal Palace, nicknamed the Eagles, is enjoying its 10th consecutive season in the Premier League. You’d have to roll back the years to the 2012-13 season to find a top-flight table devoid of the Eagles.\n\nCrystal Palace finished 10th in 2014-15, their best finish in the Premier League. Patrick Vieira has the Eagles playing an enterprising brand of football, though a top-10 finish is always aspirational for a Palace side hamstrung by a comparatively small financial purse.\n\n5. Arsenal\n\nLocation: North London\n\nStadium: Emirates Stadium\n\nSurrounding Communities: Finsbury Park, Islington, Archway\n\nYear Founded: 1886\n\nArsenal is the only other London team besides Chelsea that has won the Premier League. The Gunners accomplished the feat three times, in 1997-98, 2001-02, and 2003-04.\n\nThe club’s most storied Premier League-winning season came in 2003-04 when they went undefeated for the entire 38-game season and were dubbed “The Invincibles.”\n\nIt’s the only time a team has gone through a Premier League campaign without a single defeat."
