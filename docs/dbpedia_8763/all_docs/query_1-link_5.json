        "text": "Arsenal FC\n\nFounded at the end of 1886 by workers from the Royal Arsenal, the royal arms factories in Woolwhich, Arsenal is indispensable in the Premier League. Arsenal won the most prizes of all football clubs in London: 13 league titles, 13 FA Cups, 2 League Cups, 16 Community Shields and 1 European Cup II. However, it’s already 15 years ago that Arsenal won the title in the Premier League.\n\nYou can reach the Arsenal stadium, the Emirates Stadium, by taking the dark blue Piccadilly line in the direction of Cockfosters. After that you have two options to get off; Holloway Road or Arsenal. Our tip is to get off at Arsenal, because you have the opportunity to take a look at the old Highbury. Nowadays, it’s an apartment complex but the old main stand still looks the same from the front.\n\nChelsea FC\n\nChelsea, founded on March 10, 1905, is the only London club ever to win the Champions League. Since the first of July in 2003, Chelsea has been a permanent member of the top 6 of the Premier League. On that day Mr. Abramovich took over the club and the financial possibilities were endless. Of the six championship titles, the club won 5 after 2003.\n\nThe Chelsea stadium, Stamford Bridge, can be reached via the dark green District line with the Wimbledon stop as final station. Get off at Fulham Broadway station, walk 400 meters to the left and you will see Stamford Bridge immediately.\n\nChelsea matches\n\nCrystal Palace\n\nCrystal Palace was founded on September 10, 1905, named after the crystal palace built for the 1851 world exhibition. The Eagles play their games in southern London at iconic Selhurst Park.\n\nWant to visit Selhurst Park? At Blackfriars train station, take the Thameslink line to Gatwick Airport and get off the train at Norwood Junction. Turn onto Oliver Grove and turn left onto Holmesdale Road. After 500 meters go straight on, the stadium is on your right.\n\nCrystal Palace matches\n\nTottenham Hotspur FC\n\nThe biggest rival of Arsenal, Tottenham Hotspur, saw the light of day on September 5, 1882. In recent years, the Spurs have performed so well that they are part of the top 6 in the Premier League. Despite these good performances, it has been more than fifty years since Tottenham became champion.\n\nIn the season 2018/2019 Tottenham Hotspur moved into its new stadium, now the Tottenham Hotspur stadium, which is built on the same site as the old White Hart Lane. During the entire previous seasons they played their games at Wembley.\n\nTottenham Hotspur matches\n\nWest Ham United FC\n\nWest Ham United was founded in 1895 as Thames Ironworks. From 1900 the name changed to West Ham United and in 1919 the club joined the Football League (the predecessor of the Premier League). The most memorable prize the club won is the FA Cup; in 1964, 1975 and 1980. West Ham moved from the Boleyn Ground to the London Stadium in 2016, with the club now regularly selling out home fixtures, as the London-based side continue to go from strength to strength.\n\nWest Ham United matches\n\nWatford FC\n\nOfficially, Watford FC, founded in 1881, is not in the city of London, but in the suburb of Watford which is part of the metropolis of London. Since 2022-23 Watford FC is part of the Championship again. Watford plays its home games on Vicarage Road. The stadium can be reached by taking the metro towards Watford (Metropolitan line).\n\nMillwall\n\nMillwall, from the south of London, was founded in 1885. The club is, partly due to the famous movie Green Street, known as a raw English club. In the 91 seasons of Millwall in the Football League it managed to be promoted 11 times but also relegated 9 times. Millwall played most of her history on the second or third level. The biggest achievement of the club is reaching the FA Cup final in 2004, allowing The Lions to enter Europe.\n\nMillwall matches\n\nCHARLTON ATHLETIC\n\nCharlton Athletic plays its matches in the southeast of London. The Addicks play their matches in the iconic stadium The Valley. In this stadium the supporters saw their club playing in the Premier League between 2001 and 2007. In the 2003-2004 season, Charlton Athletic even finished 7th and in 1947 it won its only prize by winning the FA Cup. Since relegation in 2007, Charlton Athletic has fluctuated between the Championship and the League One.\n\nCharlton Athletic matches\n\nLEYTON ORIENT\n\nLeyton Orient has a rich history and a passionate fan base. Founded in 1881, the club has experienced both triumphs and challenges throughout its existence. With a home stadium at Brisbane Road, Leyton Orient has competed in various football leagues. Under manager Richie Wellens, the club was crowned champions of EFL League Two in the 2022-23 League Two campaign, meaning that they will be playing in EFL League One from the 2023–24 season."
