        "text": "West Ham Underground Station: Mini ramps are available at this station (not on DLR and c2c platforms). They are designed to cover the small remaining step / or gap between the platform and the train on step-free to train platforms. They make it easier for customers to get on and off the train, in particular for people whose mobility aids have small or swivel wheels. The ramps are quick and easy to use. Staff are trained to use them and will be happy to provide one for you to use. If you would like to use a mini ramp, please ask for help from staff or press the information button on a help point."
