        "text": "Sub-national area of England\n\nSub-national area of England in * England, * United Kingdom\n\nSouthern England, also known as the South of England or the South, is a sub-national part of England with cultural, economic and political differences from both the Midlands and the North. The Midlands form a dialect chain in a notable north–south divide of England. The sub-national area's official population is nearly 28 million and an area of 62,042 square kilometres (23,955 sq mi): roughly 40% of United Kingdom's population and approximately a quarter of its area.\n\nInfluential, geographic and political divisions have created multiple internal identities to the sub-national area of England. The influential division is defined by closeness to the capital; the Greater London itself, the Home Counties and outer areas. The Home Counties identify in a similar way to the neighbouring English Midlands, in this case sharing culture with London and the outer areas yet identifying as separate from each. The geographic split is north-east (fenlands), south (downlands and a coastal plain) and west (following the River Thames to the Bristol channel and a peninsula). The north-east fenlands for example have been affected by the London's expansion; the traditional Cockney dialect's population of London's East End has moved out to the north and east Home Counties with a knock on effect to East Anglia's population. The political divide is the International Territorial Level; the regional level defines the south as London, the South East, the South West and the East[1]\n\nDefinitions\n\n[edit]\n\nFor official purposes, the UK government does not refer to Southern England as a single entity, but the Office for National Statistics divides UK into twelve regions. In England, the North West, North East and Yorkshire and the Humber make up the North (\"centre-north\"); the West Midlands and East Midlands (as well as Wales) make up the Midlands (\"centre-south\") and the rest of England make up the South.[1]\n\nCulturally speaking, the majority of people think that the South consists of the South East (92%), Greater London (88%), South West (87%), and to lesser extent the East of England (57%).[2] However, 35% of people surveyed placed the East of England as part of the Midlands. Generally people in the North tend to put the East of England in the South more than people in the South or Midlands.[citation needed]\n\nGeography\n\n[edit]\n\nFurther information: Geography of England\n\nThe South has land borders with Wales and the English Midlands and a sea border with France, Belgium and the Netherlands.\n\nThe South is generally more low-lying than the North. There are a number of hill ranges, such as the Cotswolds and the Chilterns. The highest point in the South is High Willhays 2,037 ft (621 m), located in Devon within Dartmoor National Park.\n\nLondon is the largest city in the South of England and is the capital of the United Kingdom. The London Metropolitan Area has a population of 14.2 million (2019), making it the largest metropolitan area in Europe.[3]\n\nDemographics\n\n[edit]\n\nLanguage\n\n[edit]\n\nEnglish\n\n[edit]\n\nEnglish is the native language of the English people and the main language spoken in the South.\n\nThe South of England has a dialect and accent distinct from that of other parts of the UK. Due to the prominence of the South in media and politics, Standard British English is largely based on the English spoken in the South. For example, the standard British accent, Received Pronunciation, is very similar to the educated speech of London, Oxford and Cambridge.[4]\n\nCornish\n\n[edit]\n\nCornish is a revived language spoken in Cornwall and is an important part of the identity and culture of the Cornish people.[5]\n\nPeople\n\n[edit]\n\nPeople often apply the terms \"southern\" and \"south\" loosely, without deeper consideration of the geographical identities of Southern England. This can cause confusion over the depth of affiliation between its areas. As in much of the rest of England, people tend to have a deeper affiliation to their county or city. Thus, residents of Essex are unlikely to feel much affinity with people in Oxfordshire. Similarly, there is a strong distinction between natives of the south-west and south-east. The broadcaster Stuart Maconie has noted that culturally \"there's a bottom half of England [...] but there isn't a south in the same way that there's a north\".[6]\n\nHealth\n\n[edit]\n\nOne major manifestation of the North–South divide is in health and life expectancy statistics.[7] All three Northern England statistical regions have lower than average life expectancies and higher than average rates of cancer, circulatory disease and respiratory disease.[8][9] The South of England has a higher life expectancy than the North, however, regional differences do seem to be slowly narrowing: between 1991–1993 and 2012–2014, life expectancy in the North East increased by 6.0 years and in the North West by 5.8 years, the fastest increase in any region outside London, and the gap between life expectancy in the North East and South East is now 2.5 years, down from 2.9 in 1993.[9] Furthermore, all such figures represent an average – affluent northern towns such as Harrogate have higher life expectancies than less affluent areas of the South such as Southampton or Plymouth.\n\nEducation\n\n[edit]\n\nThe South of England has a number of world-renowned universities, such as the ancient universities of Oxford and Cambridge, and many Russell Group universities, such as Imperial College London, University of Exeter and the London School of Economics.\n\nSport\n\n[edit]\n\nThe South Coast Derby is used to describe football matches played mainly between Portsmouth Football Club and Southampton Football Club.\n\nHowever, in Portsmouth's absence from top flight football, AFC Bournemouth and Brighton and Hove Albion – based about 30 miles (48 km) and 60 miles (97 km) from Southampton respectively – gained promotion to the Premier League, with some media outlets marketing fixtures against them as a South Coast derby;[10][11][12]\n\nOther major derbies in Southern England are West Country derbies and London derbies.[13][14]\n\nRugby\n\n[edit]\n\nSee also: History of rugby union\n\nRugby union is the dominant code played in the south with a minor rugby league presence.[a] One of the biggest derbies is the West Country derby (Bath v Gloucester).[15]\n\nDivisions\n\n[edit]\n\nRegions and ceremonial counties\n\n[edit]\n\nSouthern England consists of four regions and 22 counties: the East of England, London, South East and South West. Ceremonial counties are:\n\nSouth West:\n\nBristol\n\nCornwall\n\nDevon\n\nDorset\n\nGloucestershire\n\nSomerset\n\nWiltshire\n\nSouth East:\n\nBerkshire\n\nBuckinghamshire\n\nWest Sussex\n\nEast Sussex\n\nKent\n\nOxfordshire\n\nHampshire\n\nIsle of Wight\n\nSurrey\n\nLondon:\n\nCity of London\n\nGreater London\n\nEast:\n\nBedfordshire\n\nCambridgeshire\n\nHertfordshire\n\nEssex\n\nNorfolk\n\nSuffolk\n\nDevolution\n\n[edit]\n\nThere is a network of local enterprise partnerships, some areas are further devolved:\n\nBuckinghamshire\n\nCambridgeshire and Peterborough (combined authority)\n\nCornwall and Isles of Scilly\n\nDorset\n\nLondon (enterprise panel)\n\nNew Anglia\n\nOxfordshire\n\nSwindon and Wiltshire\n\nWest of England (combined authority)\n\nGreater Brighton City Region (economic board)\n\nCatalyst South (strategic alliance):\n\nCoast to Capital\n\nEnterprise M3\n\nHertfordshire\n\nSouth East\n\nSolent\n\nThames Valley Berkshire\n\nGFirst\n\nHeart of the South West\n\nHistoric counties\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Historic counties of England\n\nThe historic counties ceased to be used for any administrative purpose in 1899 but remain important to some people, notably for county cricket.\n\nBedfordshire\n\nBerkshire\n\nBuckinghamshire\n\nCambridgeshire\n\nCornwall\n\nDevon\n\nDorset\n\nEssex\n\nGloucestershire\n\nHampshire\n\nHertfordshire\n\nHuntingdonshire\n\nKent\n\nMiddlesex\n\nNorfolk\n\nOxfordshire\n\nSomerset\n\nSuffolk\n\nSurrey\n\nSussex\n\nWiltshire\n\nOther\n\n[edit]\n\nHome Counties (areas adjoining Greater London)\n\nEast Anglia (former kingdom)\n\nThames Valley (upper valley)\n\nWessex (former kingdom)\n\nWest Country (demonym of area with a specific dialect)\n\nSee also\n\n[edit]\n\nConstitutional status of Cornwall\n\nEuropean Parliament constituencies in the United Kingdom\n\nHome Counties\n\nNorth–South divide in England\n\nNorth–South divide in the United Kingdom\n\nRegions of England\n\nSubdivisions of England\n\nLloegyr\n\nNotes\n\n[edit]"
