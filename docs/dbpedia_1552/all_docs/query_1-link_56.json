        "text": "Introduction\n\nThe Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC) is an independent U.S. Government agency with the mission to reduce poverty in developing countries through sustainable economic growth.\n\nEach year, the MCC Board of Directors (Board) selects countries as eligible for MCC assistance. The selection process begins with the Board identifying candidate countries to consider; which, by statute, are all countries with per capita incomes below the World Bank’s threshold between lower middle income countries and upper middle income countries that are not prohibited from receiving assistance by federal law. For a candidate country to then be selected as eligible to receive assistance, it must demonstrate a commitment to just and democratic governance, investing in its people, and economic freedom as measured by independent policy indicators. These indicators inform the Board of candidate countries’ broad policy framework for encouraging poverty reduction through economic growth.\n\nThese indicators are compiled into country scorecards. This is a guide to understanding and interpreting the indicators used on the country scorecards by MCC in Fiscal Year 2024. It provides an overview of the policies measured by the indicators, the relationship that these policies have to economic growth and poverty reduction, the methodologies used by the various indicator institutions to measure policy performance, descriptions of the underlying source(s) of data, and the contact information of the indicator institutions. This document also provides the specific information for how MCC constructs the final indicators from these sources. The scorecards produced using these indicators are available at: https://www.mcc.gov/who-we-select/scorecards.\n\nFor general questions about the application of these indicators, please contact MCC’s Selection, Eligibility, and Policy Performance Division at DevelopmentPolicy@mcc.gov.\n\nIndicators—What They Measure\n\nThe MCC scorecards measure performance on the policy criteria mandated in MCC’s authorizing legislation. By using information collected from independent third-party sources, MCC’s country selection process allows for an objective, comparable analysis across candidate countries.\n\nMCC favors indicators that:\n\nare developed by an independent third party,\n\nuse an analytically-rigorous methodology and objective, high-quality data,\n\nare publicly available,\n\nhave broad country-coverage among MCC candidate countries,\n\nare comparable across countries,\n\nhave a clear theoretical or empirical link to economic growth and poverty reduction,\n\nare policy-linked, (i.e. measure factors that governments can influence), and\n\nhave appropriate consistency in results from year to year.\n\nRuling Justly\n\nThese indicators measure just and democratic governance, including a country’s demonstrated commitment to promoting political pluralism, equality, and the rule of law; respecting human and civil rights; protecting private property rights; encouraging transparency and accountability of government; and combating corruption.\n\nPolitical Rights – Independent experts rate countries on the prevalence of free and fair electoral processes; political pluralism and participation of all stakeholders; government accountability and transparency; freedom from domination by the military, foreign powers, totalitarian parties, religious hierarchies and economic oligarchies; and the political rights of minority groups, among other things.

Source: Women, Business, and the Law (World Bank) and the WORLD Policy Analysis Center (UCLA)\n\nDetermining MCC Candidacy\n\nFor Fiscal Year 2024 (FY24), 80 countries meet the income parameters for MCC candidacy (with 65 being candidates and 15 meeting the income parameters but that are statutorily prohibited from receiving assistance). MCC creates scorecards for all 80 countries that meet the income parameters. A country is determined to be an MCC candidate if its per capita income falls within predetermined parameters set by Congress, and it is not subject to certain restriction on U.S. foreign assistance. Those parameters are that the country must be classified as either low income or lower middle income by the World Bank (which means it is estimated to have a Gross National Income (GNI) per capita (Atlas Method) less than the World Bank’s lower middle income country threshold of $4,465 in FY24, as published in the World Bank’s July release of income data. See the FY24 Candidate Country Report for additional information.\n\nSetting the Scorecard Income Groups\n\nFor FY24, MCC is continuing to use the historical ceiling for eligibility as set by the World Bank’s International Development Association (IDA) (often referred to as the ‘Historical IDA Threshold’) to divide the 80 countries into two income groups for the purpose of comparative analysis on the scorecard policy performance indicators. These two income groups are: 1) countries whose GNI per capita is less than or equal to $2,145 in FY24 and 2) those countries whose GNI per capita falls between $2,146 and $4,465 in FY24. For additional information, see the FY24 Selection Criteria and Methodology Report\n\nIndicator Performance\n\nA country is considered to “pass” a given indicator if it performs better than the median score in its income group or the absolute threshold (for certain indicators – see below). A country is considered to “pass” the scorecard if it: (i) “passes” at least ten of the 20 indicators, with at least one pass in each of the three categories; (ii) “passes” the Control of Corruption indicator; and, (iii) “passes” either the Civil Liberties or Political Rights indicator. For technical specifics regarding how these medians are calculated see the Note on Calculating Medians at the end of this document. Indicators with absolute thresholds in lieu of a median include:\n\nInflation, on which a country’s inflation rate must be under a fixed ceiling of 15 percent;\n\nImmunization Rates, on which a country must have immunization coverage above 90% or the median, whichever is lower;\n\nPolitical Rights, on which countries must score above 17; and\n\nCivil Liberties, on which countries must score above 25.\n\nThe Board also takes into consideration whether a country performs substantially worse in any category (Ruling Justly, Investing in People, or Economic Freedom) than it does on the overall scorecard. While the indicator methodology is the predominant basis for determining which countries will be eligible for assistance, the Board also considers supplemental information and takes into account factors such as time lags and gaps in the data used to determine indicator scores.\n\nExample Scorecard\n\nFor reference, this is an example of a scorecard from FY23.\n\nReading the Indicators\n\nEvery year each MCC candidate country receives a scorecard assessing perfomance in thre policy categories: Ruling Justly, Investing in People, and Encouraging Economic Freedom. *For the Political Rights, Civil Liberties, Inflation, and Immunization Rates (when the median is over 90% immunized) indicators, the score and percent ranking are reversed due to those indicators operating on a minimum or maximum-score system rather than a median based system.\n\nRuling Justly Category\n\nThe six indicators in this category measure just and democratic governance by assessing, among other things, a country’s demonstrated commitment to promote political pluralism, equality, and the rule of law; respect human and civil rights, including the rights of people with disabilities; protect private property rights; encourage transparency and accountability of government; and combat corruption.\n\nPolitical Rights Indicator\n\nThis indicator measures country performance on the quality of the electoral process, political pluralism and participation, government corruption and transparency, and fair political treatment of ethnic groups.\n\nCountries are rated on the following factors:\n\nfree and fair executive and legislative elections; fair polling; honest tabulation of ballots;\n\nfair electoral laws; equal campaigning opportunities;\n\nthe right to organize in different political parties and political groupings; the openness of the political system to the rise and fall of competing political parties and groupings;\n\nthe existence of a significant opposition vote; the existence of a de facto opposition power, and a realistic possibility for the opposition to increase its support or gain power through elections;\n\nthe participation of cultural, ethnic, religious, or other minority groups in political life;\n\nfreedom from domination by the military, foreign powers, totalitarian parties, religious hierarchies, economic oligarchies, or any other powerful group in making personal political choices; and\n\nthe openness, transparency, and accountability of the government to its constituents between elections; freedom from pervasive government corruption; government policies that reflect the will of the people.\n\nRelationship to Growth and Poverty Reduction\n\nAlthough the relationship between democracy and economic growth is complex, research suggests that the institutional structures of democracy can promote growth by increasing policy stability, cultivating higher rates of human capital accumulation, reducing levels of income inequality and corruption, and encouraging higher rates of investment. The links between political rights and poverty reduction are similarly complicated, but there is evidence that democratic institutions are better at reducing economic volatility and provide a more consistent approach to poverty reduction than do autocratic regimes. Research also links the incentive structure of democratic institutions with outcomes favorable for the poor.\n\nSource\n\nFreedom House, http://www.freedomhouse.org. Questions regarding this indicator may be directed to info@freedomhouse.org or +1 (212) 514-8040.\n\nIndicator Institution Methodology\n\nThe Political Rights indicator is based on a team of expert analysts and scholars evaluating countries using a ten question checklist grouped into the three subcategories: Electoral Process (3 questions), Political Pluralism and Participation (4 questions), and Functioning of Government (3 questions). Points are awarded to each question on a scale of 0 to 4, where 0 points represents the fewest rights and 4 represents the most rights. The highest number of points that can be awarded to the Political Rights checklist is 40 (or a total of up to 4 points for each of the 10 questions). There is also an additional, discretionary, political rights question which can subtract up to 4 points from a country’s score. The full list of questions included in Freedom House’s methodology may be found at: https://freedomhouse.org/reports/freedom-world/freedom-world-research-methodology.\n\nIn consultation with Freedom House, MCC considers countries with scores above 17 to be passing this indicator.\n\nMCC Methodology\n\nFreedom House publishes a 1-7 scale (where 7 is “least free” and 1 is “most free”) for Political Rights. Since its Freedom in the World 2006 report, Freedom House has also released data using a 0-40 scale for Political Rights (where 0 is “least free” and 40 is “most free”). Table 1 illustrates how the 1-7 scale used prior to Fiscal Year 2007 (FY07) corresponds to the new 0-40 scale.\n\nNew Scale Old Scale 36-40 1 30-35 2 24-29 3 18-23 4 12-17 5 6-11 6 0-5 7\n\nMCC adjusts the years on the x-axis of the Country Scorecards to correspond to the period of time covered by the Freedom in the World publication. For instance, FY24 Political Rights data come from Freedom in the World 2023 and are labeled as 2022 data on the scorecard (the year Freedom House is reporting on in its 2023 report.)\n\nCivil Liberties Indicator\n\nThis indicator measures country performance on freedom of expression and belief, associational and organizational rights, rule of law and human rights, personal autonomy, individual and economic rights, and the independence of the judiciary.\n\nCountries are rated on the following factors:\n\nfreedom of cultural expression, religious institutions and expression, and academia;\n\nfreedom of assembly and demonstration, of political organization and professional organization, and collective bargaining;\n\nindependence of the media and the judiciary;\n\nfreedom from economic exploitation;\n\nprotection from police terror, unjustified imprisonment, exile, and torture;\n\nthe existence of rule of law, personal property rights, and equal treatment under the law;\n\nfreedom from indoctrination and excessive dependency on the state;\n\nequality of opportunity;\n\nfreedom to choose where to travel, reside, and work;\n\nfreedom to select a marriage partner and determine whether or how many children to have; and\n\nthe existence of a legal framework to grant asylum or refugee status in accordance with international and regional conventions and system for refugee protection.\n\nRelationship to Growth and Poverty Reduction:\n\nStudies show that an expansion of civil liberties can promote economic growth by reducing social conflict, removing legal impediments to participation in the economy, encouraging adherence to the rule of law, enhancing protection of property rights, increasing economic rates of return on government projects, and reducing the risk of project failure. Additional research has shown that civil liberties have a positive effect on domestic investment and productivity, increase the success of investments by international actors, enhance economic freedoms, and can bolster growth through the freedom of mobility for individuals.\n\nSource\n\nFreedom House, http:/www./freedomhouse.org. Questions regarding this indicator may be directed to info@freedomhouse.org or +1 (212) 514-8040.\n\nIndicator Institution Methodology\n\nA team of expert analysts and scholars evaluate countries on a 60-point scale – with 60 representing “most free” and 0 representing “least free.” The Civil Liberties indicator is based on a 15 question checklist grouped into four subcategories: Freedom of Expression and Belief (4 questions), Associational and Organizational Rights (3 questions), Rule of Law (4 questions), and Personal Autonomy and Individual Rights (4 questions). Points are awarded to each question on a scale of 0 to 4, where 0 points represents the fewest liberties and 4 represents the most liberties. The highest number of points that can be awarded to the Civil Liberties checklist is 60 (or a total of up to 4 points for each of the 15 questions). The full list of questions included in Freedom House’s methodology may be found at: https://freedomhouse.org/reports/freedom-world/freedom-world-research-methodology.\n\nIn consultation with Freedom House, MCC considers countries with scores above 25 to be passing this indicator.\n\nMCC Methodology\n\nFreedom House publishes a 1-7 scale (where 7 is “least free” and 1 is “most free”) for Civil Liberties. Since its Freedom in the World 2006 report, Freedom House has also released data using a 0-60 scale (where 0 is “least free” and 60 is “most free”) for Civil Liberties. Table 2 illustrates how the 1-7 scale used prior to FY07 corresponds to the new 0-60 scale.\n\nNew Scale Old Scale 53-60 1 44-52 2 35-43 3 26-34 4 17-25 5 8-16 6 0-7 7\n\nMCC adjusts the years on the x-axis of the Country Scorecards to correspond to the period of time covered by the Freedom in the World publication. For instance, FY24 Civil Liberties data come from Freedom in the World 2023 and are labeled as 2022 data on the scorecard (the year Freedom House is reporting on in its 2023 report).\n\nControl of Corruption Indicator\n\nThis indicator measures the extent to which public power is exercised for private grain, including both petty and grand forms of corruption, as well as “capture” of the state by elites and private interests. It also measures the strength and effectiveness of a country’s policy and institutional framework to prevent and combat corruption.\n\nCountries are evaluated on the following factors:\n\nThe prevalence of grand corruption and petty corruption at all levels of government;\n\nThe effect of corruption on the “attractiveness” of a country as a place to do business;\n\nThe frequency of “irregular payments” associated with import and export permits, public contracts, public utilities, tax assessments, and judicial decisions;\n\nNepotism, cronyism and patronage in the civil service;\n\nThe estimated cost of bribery as a share of a company’s annual sales;\n\nThe perceived involvement of elected officials, border officials, tax officials, judges, and magistrates in corruption;\n\nThe strength and effectiveness of a government’s anti-corruption laws, policies, and institutions;\n\nPublic trust in the financial honesty of politicians;\n\nThe extent to which:\n\nprocesses are put in place for accountability and transparency in decision-making and disclosure of information at the local level;\n\ngovernment authorities monitor the prevalence of corruption and implement sanctions transparently;\n\nconflict of interest and ethics rules for public servants are observed and enforced;\n\nthe income and asset declarations of public officials are subject to verification and open to public and media scrutiny;\n\nsenior government officials are immune from prosecution under the law for malfeasance;\n\nthe government provides victims of corruption with adequate mechanisms to pursue their rights;\n\nthe tax administrator implements effective internal audit systems to ensure the accountability of tax collection;\n\nthe executive budget-making process is comprehensive and transparent and subject to meaningful legislative review and scrutiny;\n\nthe government ensures transparency, open-bidding, and effective competition in the awarding of government contracts;\n\nthere are legal and functional protections for whistleblowers, anti-corruption activists, and investigators;\n\nallegations of corruption at the national and local level are thoroughly investigated and prosecuted without prejudice;\n\ngovernment is free from excessive bureaucratic regulations, registration requirements, and/or other controls that increase opportunities for corruption;\n\ncitizens have a legal right to information about government operations and can obtain government documents at a nominal cost.\n\nRelationship to Growth and Poverty Reduction\n\nCorruption hinders economic growth by increasing costs, lowering productivity, discouraging investment, reducing confidence in public institutions, limiting the development of small and medium-sized enterprises, weakening systems of public financial management, and undermining investments in health and education. Corruption can also increase poverty by slowing economic growth, skewing government expenditure in favor of the rich and well-connected, concentrating public investment in unproductive projects, promoting a more regressive tax system, siphoning funds away from essential public services, adding a higher level of risk to the investment decisions of low-income individuals, and reinforcing patterns of unequal asset ownership, thereby limiting the ability of the poor to borrow and increase their income.\n\nSource\n\nWorldwide Governance Indicators (WGI) from the World Bank/Brookings Institution, http://info.worldbank.org/governance/wgi/. Questions regarding this indicator may be directed to wgi@worldbank.org or +1 (202) 473-4557.\n\nIndicator Institution Methodology\n\nThe indicator is an index combining a subset of 24 different assessments and surveys, depending on availability, each of which receives a different weight, depending on its estimated precision and country coverage. The Control of Corruption indicator draws on data, as applicable, from the Country Policy and Institutional Assessments of the World Bank, the African Development Bank, the Asian Development Bank, the Afrobarometer Survey, the World Bank’s Business Environment and Enterprise Performance Survey, the Bertelsmann Foundation’s Bertelsmann Transformation Index, the Economist Intelligence Unit’s Country Risk Service, The University of Gothenburg’s European Quality of Government Index, Transparency International’s Global Corruption Barometer survey, the World Economic Forum’s Global Competitiveness Report, Global Integrity’s African Integrity Index (previously known as the Global Integrity Index), the Gallup World Poll, Freedom House’s Nation in Transit, Freedom House’s Countries at the Crossroads, the International Fund for Agricultural Development’s Rural Sector Performance Assessments, the Latinobarometro Survey, Political Economic Risk Consultancy’s Corruption in Asia, Political Risk Service’s International Country Risk Guide, Vanderbilt University Americas Barometer Survey, the Institute for Management and Development’s World Competitiveness Yearbook, Varieties of Democracy’s Corruption Index, the French Government’s Institutional Profiles Database, IHS Markit’s World Economic Service, and the World Justice Project’s Rule of Law Index.\n\nMCC Methodology\n\nMCC Normalized Score = WGI Score - median score\n\nFor ease of interpretation, MCC has adjusted the median for each of the two scorecard income pools to zero for all of the Worldwide Governance Indicators. Country scores are calculated by taking the difference between actual scores and the median. For example, in FY23 the unadjusted median for the scorecard category of countries with a Gross National Income (GNI) per capita between $2,046 and $4,255 on Control of Corruption was -0.47 (note, in FY24, the GNI per capita range for this scorecard category is $2,146 to $4,465). In order to set the median at zero, MCC simply adds 0.47 to each country’s score (the same thing as subtracting a negative 0.47). Therefore, as an example, Algeria’s FY23 Control of Corruption score, which was originally -0.61, was adjusted to -0.14.\n\nThe FY24 scores come from the 2023 update of the Worldwide Governance Indicators dataset and largely reflect performance in calendar year 2022. Since the release of the 2006 update of the Worldwide Governance Indicators, the indicators are updated annually. Each year, the World Bank and Brookings Institution also make minor backward revisions to the historical data. Prior to 2006, the World Bank released data every two years (1996, 1998, 2000, 2002 and 2004). With the 2006 release, the World Bank moved to an annual reporting cycle and provided additional historical data for 2003 and 2005.\n\nGovernment Effectiveness Indicator\n\nThis indicator measures the quality of public services, the quality of the civil service and its independence from political pressures, the quality of policy formulation and implementation, and the credibility of the government’s commitment to its stated policies.\n\nCountries are evaluated on the following factors:\n\ncompetence of civil service; effective implementation of government decisions; and public service vulnerability to political pressure;\n\nability to manage political alternations without drastic policy changes or interruptions in government services;\n\nflexibility, learning, and innovation within the political leadership; ability to coordinate conflicting objectives into coherent policies;\n\nthe efficiency of revenue mobilization and budget management;\n\nthe quality of transportation infrastructure, telecommunications, electricity supply, public health care provision, and public schools; the availability of online government services;\n\npolicy consistency; the extent to which government commitments are honored by new governments;\n\nprevalence of red tape; the degree to which bureaucratic delays hinder business activity;\n\nexistence of a taxpayer service and information program, and an efficient and effective appeals mechanism;\n\nthe extent to which:\n\neffective coordination mechanisms ensure policy consistency across departmental boundaries, and administrative structures are organized along functional lines with little duplication;\n\nthe business processes of government agencies are regularly reviewed to ensure efficiency of decision making and implementation;\n\npolitical leadership sets and maintains strategic priorities and the government effectively implements reforms;\n\nhiring and promotion within the government is based on merit and performance, and ethical standards prevail;\n\nthe government wage bill is sustainable and does not crowd out spending required for public services; pay and benefit levels do not deter talented people from entering the public sector; flexibility (that is not abused) exists to pay more attractive wages in hard-to-fill positions;\n\ngovernment revenues are generated by low-distortion taxes; import tariffs are low and relatively uniform, export rebate or duty drawbacks are functional; the tax base is broad and free of arbitrary exemptions; tax administration is effective and rule-based; and tax administration and compliance costs are low;\n\npolicies and priorities are linked to the budget; multi-year expenditure projections are integrated into the budget formulation process, and reflect explicit costing of the implications of new policy initiatives; the budget is formulated through systematic consultations with spending ministries and the legislature, adhering to a fixed budget calendar; the budget classification system is comprehensive and consistent with international standards; and off-budget expenditures are kept to a minimum and handled transparently;\n\nthe budget is implemented as planned, and actual expenditures deviate only slightly from planned levels;\n\nbudget monitoring occurs throughout the year based on well-functioning management information systems; reconciliation of banking and fiscal records is practiced comprehensively, properly, and in a timely way;\n\nin-year fiscal reports and public accounts are prepared promptly and regularly and provide full and accurate data; the extent to which accounts are audited in a timely, professional and comprehensive manner, and appropriate action is taken on budget reports and audit findings.\n\nRelationship to Growth and Poverty Reduction\n\nCountries with more effective governments tend to achieve higher levels of economic growth by obtaining better credit ratings and attracting more investment, offering higher quality public services and encouraging higher levels of human capital accumulation, putting foreign aid resources to better use, accelerating technological innovation, and increasing the productivity of government spending. Efficiency in the delivery of public services also has a direct impact on poverty. On average, countries with more effective governments have better educational systems and more efficient health care. There is evidence that countries with independent, meritocratic bureaucracies do a better job of vaccinating children, protecting the most vulnerable members of society, reducing child mortality, and curbing environmental degradation. Countries with a meritocratic civil service also tend to have lower levels of corruption.\n\nSource\n\nWorldwide Governance Indicators (WGI) from the World Bank/Brookings Institution, http://info.worldbank.org/governance/wgi/.

The Government Effectiveness indicator draws on data, as applicable, from the Country Policy and Institutional Assessments of the World Bank, the African Development Bank, the Asian Development Bank, the Afrobarometer Survey, the World Bank’s Business Environment and Enterprise Performance Survey, the Bertelsmann Foundation’s Bertelsmann Transformation Index, Global Integrity’s African Integrity Index (previously known as the Global Integrity Index), the Economist Intelligence Unit’s Country Risk Service, The University of Gothenburg’s European Quality of Government Index, the World Economic Forum’s Global Competitiveness Report, the Gallup World Poll, the International Fund for Agricultural Development’s Rural Sector Performance Assessments, the Latinobarometro Survey, Political Risk Service’s International Country Risk Guide, the French Government’s Institutional Profiles Database, IHS Markit’s World Economic Service, and the Institute for Management and Development’s World Competitiveness Yearbook.\n\nMCC Methodology\n\nMCC Normalized Score = WGI Score - median score\n\nFor ease of interpretation, MCC has adjusted the median for each of the two scorecard income pools to zero for all of the Worldwide Governance Indicators. Country scores are calculated by taking the difference between actual scores and the median. For example, in FY23 the unadjusted median for the scorecard category of countries with a Gross National Income (GNI) per capita between $2,046 and $4,255 on Control of Corruption was -0.47 (note, in FY24, the GNI per capita range for this scorecard category is $2,146 to $4,465). In order to set the median at zero, MCC simply adds 0.47 to each country’s score (the same thing as subtracting a negative 0.47). Therefore, as an example, Algeria’s FY23 Control of Corruption score, which was originally -0.61, was adjusted to -0.14.\n\nThe FY24 scores come from the 2023 update of the Worldwide Governance Indicators dataset and largely reflect performance in calendar year 2022. Since the release of the 2006 update of the Worldwide Governance Indicators, the indicators are updated annually. Each year, the World Bank and Brookings Institution also make minor backward revisions to the historical data. Prior to 2006, the World Bank released data every two years (1996, 1998, 2000, 2002 and 2004). With the 2006 release, the World Bank moved to an annual reporting cycle and provided additional historical data for 2003 and 2005.\n\nRule of Law Indicator\n\nThis indicator measures the extent to which individuals and firms have confidence in and abide by the rules of society; in particular, it measures the functioning and independence of the judiciary, including the police, the protection of property rights, the quality of contract enforcement, as well as the likelihood of crime and violence.\n\nCountries are evaluated on the following factors:\n\npublic confidence in the police force and judicial system; popular observance of the law; a tradition of law and order; strength and impartiality of the legal system;\n\nprevalence of petty crime, violent crime, and organized crime; foreign kidnappings; economic impact of crime on local businesses; prevalence of human trafficking; government commitment to combating human trafficking;\n\nthe extent to which a well-functioning and accountable police force protects citizens and their property from crime and violence; when serious crimes do occur, the extent to which they are reported to the police and investigated;\n\nsecurity of private property rights; protection of intellectual property; the accuracy and integrity of the property registry; whether citizens are protected from arbitrary and/or unjust deprivation of property;\n\nthe enforceability of private contracts and government contracts;\n\nthe existence of an institutional, legal, and market framework for secure land tenure; equal access to land among men and women; effective management of common property resources; equitable user-rights over water resources for agriculture and local participation in the management of water resources;\n\nthe prevalence of tax evasion and insider trading; size of the informal economy;\n\nindependence, effectiveness, predictability, and integrity of the judiciary; compliance with court rulings; legal recourse for challenging government actions; ability to sue the government through independent and impartial courts; willingness of citizens to accept legal adjudication over physical and illegal measures; government compliance with judicial decisions, which are not subject to change except through established procedures for judicial review;\n\nthe independence of prosecutors from political direction and control;\n\nthe existence of effective and democratic civilian state control of the police, military, and internal security forces through the judicial, legislative, and executive branches; the police, military, and internal security services respect human rights and are held accountable for any abuses of power;\n\nimpartiality and nondiscrimination in the administration of justice; citizens are given a fair, public, and timely hearing by a competent, independent, and impartial tribunal; citizens have the right to independent counsel and those charged with serious felonies are provided access to independent counsel when it is beyond their means; low-cost means are available for pursuing small claims; citizens can pursue claims against the state without fear of retaliation;\n\nprotection of judges and magistrates from interference by the executive and legislative branches; judges are appointed, promoted, and dismissed in a fair and unbiased manner; judges are appropriately trained to carry out justice in a fair and unbiased manner; members of the national-level judiciary must give reasons for their decisions; existence of a judicial ombudsman (or equivalent agency or mechanism) that can initiate investigations and impose penalties on offenders;\n\nlaw enforcement agencies are protected from political interference and have sufficient budgets to carry out their mandates; appointments to law enforcement agencies are made according to professional criteria; law enforcement officials are not immune from criminal proceedings;\n\nthe existence of an independent reporting mechanism for citizens to complain about police actions; timeliness of government response to citizen complaints about police actions.\n\nRelationship to Growth and Poverty Reduction\n\nJudicial independence is strongly linked to growth as it promotes a stable investment environment. On average, business environments characterized by consistent policies and credible rules, such as secure property rights and contract enforceability, create higher levels of investment and growth. Secure property rights and contract enforceability also have a positive impact on poverty by granting citizens secure rights to their own assets. Research shows that people who do not have the resources or the connections to protect their rights informally are usually in most need of formal protection through efficient legal systems.\n\nSource\n\nWorldwide Governance Indicators (WGI) from the World Bank/Brookings Institution, http://info.worldbank.org/governance/wgi/.

The Rule of Law indicator draws on data, as applicable, the Country Policy and Institutional Assessments of the World Bank, the African Development Bank and the Asian Development Bank, the Afrobarometer Survey, the World Bank’s Business Environment and Enterprise Performance Survey, the Bertelsmann Foundation’s Bertelsmann Transformation Index, Freedom House’s Nations in Transit report, Freedom House’s Countries at the Crossroads report, the Economist Intelligence Unit’s Country Risk Service, The University of Gothenburg’s European Quality of Government Index, the World Economic Forum’s Global Competitiveness Report, Global Integrity’s African Integrity Index (previously known as the Global Integrity Index), the Gallup World Poll, the Heritage Foundation’s Index of Economic Freedom, the International Fund for Agricultural Development’s Rural Sector Performance Assessments, the Latinobarometro Survey, Political Risk Service’s International Country Risk Guide, the United States State Department’s Trafficking in Persons Report, Vanderbilt University’s Americas Barometer, Institute for Management and Development’s World Competitiveness Yearbook, Varieties of Democracy’s Liberal Component Index, the French Government’s Institutional Profiles database, IHS Markit’s World Economic Service, and the World Justice Project’s Rule of Law Index.\n\nMCC Methodology\n\nMCC Normalized Score = WGI Score - median score\n\nFor ease of interpretation, MCC has adjusted the median for each of the two scorecard income pools to zero for all of the Worldwide Governance Indicators. Country scores are calculated by taking the difference between actual scores and the median. For example, in FY23 the unadjusted median for the scorecard category of countries with a Gross National Income (GNI) per capita between $2,046 and $4,255 on Control of Corruption was -0.47 (note, in FY24, the GNI per capita range for this scorecard category is $2,146 to $4,465). In order to set the median at zero, MCC simply adds 0.47 to each country’s score (the same thing as subtracting a negative 0.47). Therefore, as an example, Algeria’s FY23 Control of Corruption score, which was originally -0.61, was adjusted to -0.14.\n\nThe FY24 scores come from the 2023 update of the Worldwide Governance Indicators dataset and largely reflect performance in calendar year 2022. Since the release of the 2006 update of the Worldwide Governance Indicators, the indicators are updated annually. Each year, the World Bank and Brookings Institution also make minor backward revisions to the historical data. Prior to 2006, the World Bank released data every two years (1996, 1998, 2000, 2002 and 2004). With the 2006 release, the World Bank moved to an annual reporting cycle and provided additional historical data for 2003 and 2005.\n\nFreedom of Information Indicator\n\nThis indicator measures a government’s commitment to enable or allow information to move freely in society. It is a composite index that includes a measure of press freedom; the status of national freedom of information laws; and a measure of internet filtering.\n\nRelationship to Growth and Poverty Reduction\n\nGovernments play a role in information flows; they can restrict or facilitate information flows within countries or across borders. Many of the institutions (laws, regulations, codes of conduct) that governments design are created to manage the flow of information in an economy. Countries with better information flows often have better quality governance and less corruption. Higher transparency and access to information have been shown to increase investment inflows because they enhance an investor’s knowledge of the behaviors and operations of institutions in a target economy; help reduce uncertainty about future changes in policies and administrative practices; contribute data and perspectives on how best an investment project can be initiated and managed; and allow for the increased coordination between social and political actors that typifies successful economic development. The right of access to information within government institutions also strengthens democratic accountability, promotes political participation of all, reduces governmental abuses, and leads to more effective allocation of natural resources. Access to information also empowers marginalized groups and those living in poverty by giving them the ability to more fully participate in society and providing them with knowledge that can be used for economic gain. Internet shutdowns are harmful as they not only restrict the ability of civil society to engage in political participation and government oversight, but also restrict market access and cost economies billions of dollars each year.\n\nSources and Indicator Institution Methodologies\n\nI.

Questions regarding this indicator may be directed to index@rsf.org or +33 1 44 83 84 65\n\nWorld Press Freedom Index methodology: RSF compiles its data by pooling experts’ responses to 117 questions related to the political context, legal framework, economic situation, sociocultural context, and safety environment that face journalists in a country. This qualitative analysis is combined with quantitative data on abuses and acts of violence against journalists during the period evaluated.\n\nII.

Questions regarding this indicator may be directed to Toby Mendel at toby@law-democracy.org or +1 (902) 431-3688.\n\nRight to Information Methodology: In this dataset, a freedom of information law is rated based on 61 indicators. RTI includes any country with a freedom of information law on the books.\n\nIII. Access Now’s #KeepItOn Shutdown Tracker Optimization Project, https://www.accessnow.org/keepiton/. Questions regarding this indicator may be directed to Peter Micek at peter@accessnow.org or +1 (888) 414-0100.\n\nAccess Now Methodology: Countries are assigned one point for every day of internet or social media shutdown/throttling up to 9 days. Shutdowns listed as ongoing are assumed to last until the end of the year. Shutdowns that last less than one day are counted as one day. Shutdowns with no end date are assumed to only last one day. If no duration is listed, but a start and end date are listed, a duration is calculated. Non-government shutdowns and non-government throttlings are excluded.\n\nMCC Methodology\n\nMCC FOI Score = (Press) + (FOIA in place) - (Access Now)\n\nThis indicator uses a country’s score on RSF’s World Press Freedom Index (Press) as the base. In FY24, MCC uses RSF’s 2023 World Press Freedom Index, which covers events in 2022. A country’s base score may improve based on data from the Global Right to Information Rating. In FY24, MCC uses Centre for Law and Democracy / Access Info Europe’s Global Right to Information Rating (RTI) from 2022. A country’s score is improved by 4 points if they have a Freedom of Information law enacted. Data from Access Now is used to penalize some countries’ base scores. A country’s score is penalized 1 point for each day in the last calendar year (2022) of internet or social media shutdown/throttling, for a total penalty of up to 9 points. For FY24, MCC uses Access Now data from the 2022 #KeepItOn Shutdown Tracker Optimization Project report.\n\nNote regarding construction of missing data: Prior to FY23, MCC utilized old data from Freedom House on Freedom of the Press to construct data for countries that were missing data from RSF. Starting in FY23, MCC will no longer use this methodology as RSF’s methodology has changed and it is no longer comparable to the old Freedom House data. Countries that are missing RSF data will be considered missing and therefore fail this indicator.\n\nInvesting in People Category\n\nThe indicators in this category measure investments in people by assessing the extent to which governments are promoting broad-based primary education, strengthening capacity to provide quality public health, increasing child health, and promoting the protection of biodiversity.\n\nImmunization Rates Indicator\n\nThis indicator measures a government’s commitment to providing essential public health services and reducing child mortality.\n\nRelationship to Growth and Poverty Reduction\n\nThe Immunization Rates indicator is widely regarded as a good proxy for the overall strength of a government’s public health system. It is designed to measure the extent to which governments are investing in the health and well-being of their citizens. Immunization programs can impact economic growth through their broader impact on health. Healthy workers are more economically productive and more likely to save and invest; healthy children are more likely to reach higher levels of educational attainment; and healthy parents are better able to invest in the health and education of their children. Immunization programs also increase labor productivity among the poor, reduce spending to cope with illnesses, and lower mortality and morbidity among the main income-earners in poor families.\n\nSource\n\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) and the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF), http://www.who.int/immunization_monitoring/data/. Questions regarding this indicator may be directed to vaccines@who.int or +41 22 791 2873.\n\nIndicator Institution Methodology\n\nMCC uses the simple average of the national diphtheria-pertussis-tetanus (DPT3) vaccination rate and the measles (MCV) vaccination rate. The DPT3 immunization rate is measured as the number of children that have received their third dose of the diphtheria, pertussis (whooping cough), and tetanus toxoid vaccine divided by the target population (the number of children surviving their first year of life.) The measles immunization rate is measured as the number of children that have received their first dose of a measles-containing vaccine divided by the same target population.\n\nTo estimate national immunization coverage, WHO and UNICEF draw on two sources of empirical data: reports of vaccinations performed by service providers (administrative data) and surveys containing items on children’s vaccination history (coverage surveys). Surveys are frequently used in conjunction with administrative data; in some instances—where administrative data differ substantially from survey results—surveys constitute the sole source of information on immunization coverage levels. There are a number of reasons survey data may be used over administrative data; for instance, in some cases, lack of precise information on the size of the target population (the denominator) can make immunization coverage difficult to estimate from administrative data alone. Estimates of the most likely true level of immunization coverage are based on the data available, consideration of potential biases, and contributions of local experts.\n\nIn consultation with the WHO, MCC considers countries which have immunization coverage above the median for their scorecard income pool to be passing this indicator. If the median is above 90% for an income pool in a year, countries in that income pool will be considered passing if they have immunization coverage above 90% (even if they score below the median).\n\nMCC Methodology\n\nMCC Immunization Rate = [0.5 × DPT3 ] + [0.5 × MCV1]\n\nMCC relies on official WHO/United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF) estimates for all immunization data. MCC uses the simple average of the 2022 DPT3 coverage rate and the 2022 measles (MCV) coverage rate to calculate FY24 country scores. If a country is missing data for either DPT3 or Measles, it does not receive an index value. The same rule is applied to historical data. As better data become available, WHO/UNICEF make backward revisions to the historical data. In FY24, countries must have immunization rates (as defined above) greater than 90% or the median for their scorecard pool, whichever is lower, to pass this indicator.\n\nHealth Expenditures Indicator\n\nThis indicator measures the government’s commitment to investing in the health and well-being of its people.\n\nRelationship to Growth and Poverty Reduction\n\nMCC generally strives to measure outcomes rather than inputs, but health outcomes can be very slow to adjust to policy changes. Therefore, the Health Expenditures indicator is used to gauge the extent to which governments are making investments in the health and well-being of their citizens. A large body of literature links improved health outcomes to economic growth and poverty reduction. While the link between expenditures and outcomes is never automatic in any country, it is generally positive when expenditures are managed and executed efficiently. Research suggests that increased spending on health, when coupled with good policies and good governance, can promote growth, reduce poverty, and trigger declines in infant, child, and maternal mortality.\n\nSource\n\nWorld Health Organization (WHO), http://www.who.int/nha/en/. Questions regarding this indicator may be directed to nhaweb@who.int.\n\nIndicator Institution Methodology\n\nThis indicator measures domestic general government health expenditure (GGHE-D) as a percentage of Gross Domestic Product (GDP). Domestic general government health expenditure includes outlays earmarked for health maintenance, restoration or enhancement of the health status of the population, paid for in cash or in kind by the following financing agents: central/federal, state/provincial/regional, and local/municipal authorities; extra-budgetary agencies, social security schemes; and parastatals. All are financed through domestic funds. GGHE-D includes only current expenditures made during the year (excluding investment expenditures such as capital transfers). The classification of the functions of government (COFOG) promoted by the United Nations, the International Monetary Fund (IMF), OECD and other institutions sets the boundaries for public outlays. Figures are originally estimated in million national currency units (million NCU) and in current prices. GDP data are primarily drawn from the United Nations National Accounts statistics.\n\nMCC Methodology\n\nThis indicator measures public expenditure on health as a percent of gross domestic product (GDP). MCC relies on the World Health Organization (WHO) for data on public health expenditure. The WHO estimates domestic general government health expenditure (GGHE-D) — the sum of current outlays by government entities to purchase health care services and goods — in million national currency units (million NCU) and in current prices. GDP data are primarily drawn from the United Nations National Accounts statistics.\n\nPrior to FY19, MCC utilized a slightly different indicator, which was discontinued by the WHO. Because MCC started using a different indicator from the WHO in FY19, data from FY19 onward on MCC’s scorecard are not comparable to data found on MCC scorecards prior to FY19.\n\nThe FY24 scores come from the 2023 update of the global health expenditure database and largely reflect performance in calendar year 2020. To ensure comparability, given the unprecedented nature of health spending in 2020, for FY24, MCC uses data from 2020 for all countries, even in the very few of cases where 2021 data is available.\n\nEducation Expenditures Indicator\n\nThis indicator measures the government’s commitment to investing in education.\n\nRelationship to Growth and Poverty Reduction\n\nWhile MCC generally strives to measure outcomes rather than inputs, educational outcome indicators can be very slow to adjust to policy changes, and adequate data on educational quality do not yet exist in a consistent manner across a large number of countries. Therefore, the Education Expenditures indicator is used to gauge the extent to which governments are currently making investments in the education of their citizens. Research shows that, for given levels of quality, well-managed and well-executed government spending on education can improve educational attainment and increase economic growth. There is also evidence that the returns to education to an economy as a whole are larger than the private returns. Investments in basic education are also critical to poverty reduction. Research shows that regions that begin with higher levels of education generally see a larger poverty impact of economic growth.\n\nSource\n\nThe United National Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) Institute for Statistics (UIS) is MCC’s source of data, http://www.uis.unesco.org. UIS compiles education expenditure data from official responses to surveys and from reports provided by education authorities in each country. Specifically, MCC uses government expenditure on education as a percentage of GDP (%) from the SDG database. Questions regarding the UIS data may be directed to survey@uis.unesco.org or (514)-343-7752.\n\nIndicator Institution Methodology\n\nUIS attempts to measure total current and capital expenditure on education at every level of administration—central, regional, and local. UIS data generally include subsidies for private education, but not foreign aid for education. UIS data may also exclude spending by religious schools, which plays a significant role in many developing countries.\n\nGovernment outlays on education include expenditures on services provided to individual pupils and students and expenditures on services provided on a collective basis. For FY24, MCC will use the most recent UNESCO data from 2017 or later.\n\nMCC Methodology\n\nMCC uses the most recent data point in the past six years (since 2017)\n\nThis indicator measures public expenditure on education as a percent of GDP. MCC relies on the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) Institute of Statistics as its source. Specifically, MCC uses the indicator named “Government expenditure on education as a percentage of GDP (%).” For FY24, MCC first determines if a country has a value reported by UNESCO in 2017 or later. If so, the most recent data available within those years are used. If a country does not have UNESCO data at any point since 2017, it does not receive an FY24 score.\n\nFor UNESCO data, the GDP estimates used in the denominator are provided to UNESCO by the World Bank. As better data become available, UNESCO makes backward revisions to historical data.\n\nIn FY24 MCC revised its methodology for this indicator to shift from a focus on Primary Education Expenditures to Education Expenditures. As a result, the scores from FY24 are not comparable to scores from FY23 and earlier.\n\nGirls’ Primary Education Completion Rate Indicator\n\nThis indicator measures a government’s commitment to basic education for girls in terms of access, enrollment, and retention. MCC uses this indicator for countries with a GNI per capita below $2,145 only.\n\nRelationship to Growth and Poverty Reduction\n\nUniversal basic education is an important determinant of economic growth and poverty reduction. Empirical research consistently shows a strong positive correlation between girls’ primary education and accelerated economic growth, slower population growth, higher wages, increased agricultural yields and labor productivity, and greater returns to schooling as compared to men. A large body of literature also shows that increasing a mother’s schooling has a large effect on her child’s health, schooling, and adult productivity, an effect that is more pronounced in poor households. By one estimate, providing girls one extra year of education beyond the average can boost eventual wages by 10-20 percent. The social benefits of female education are also demonstrated through lower fertility rates, higher immunization rates, decreased child and maternal mortality, reduced transmission of HIV, fewer cases of domestic violence, greater educational achievement by children, and increased female participation in government.\n\nSource\n\nUNESCO’s Institute for Statistics (UIS), http://www.uis.unesco.org. Questions regarding this indicator may be directed to survey@uis.unesco.org or +1 (514) 343-7752.\n\nIndicator Institution Methodology\n\nThe Girls’ Primary Education Completion Rate indicator is measured as the gross intake ratio into the last grade of primary, a proxy for primary completion. This is measured as the total number of female students enrolled in the last grade of primary (regardless of age), minus the number of female students repeating the last grade of primary, divided by the total female population of the standard entrance age of the last grade of primary. The primary completion rate reflects the primary cycle as defined by the International Standard Classification of Education (ISCED), ranging from three or four years of primary education (in a very small number of countries) to five or six years (in most countries), to seven years (in a small number of countries). For the countries that changed their primary cycle, the most recent ISCED primary cycle is applied consistently to the whole series. For FY24, MCC will use the most recent UNESCO data since 2017.\n\nThis indicator was selected since data limitations preclude adjusting the girls’ primary education completion rate for students who drop out during the final year of primary school. Therefore, UNESCO’s estimates should be taken as an upper-bound estimate of the actual female primary completion rate. Because the numerator may include late entrants and over-age children who have repeated one or more grades of primary school but are now graduating, as well as children who entered school early, it is possible for the primary completion rate to exceed 100 percent.\n\nMCC Methodology\n\nMCC uses the most recent data point in the past six years (since 2017)\n\nMCC draws upon data from UNESCO’s Institute of Statistics as its exclusive source of data for this indicator. Specifically, MCC uses the indicator named “Gross intake ratio to the last grade of primary education, female (%).” To receive an FY24 score, countries must have a UNESCO value in 2017 or later. MCC uses the most recent year available, that is, MCC uses the most recent data from the past six years. If a country does not have UNESCO data at any point from 2017 or later, it does not receive an FY24 score. As better data become available, UNESCO makes backward revisions to its historical data.\n\nGirls’ Lower Secondary Education Completion Rate Indicator\n\nThis indicator measures a government’s commitment to secondary education for girls in terms of access, enrollment, and completion. MCC uses this indicator for countries with a GNI per capita between $2,146 and $4,465 only.\n\nRelationship to Growth and Poverty Reduction\n\nAccess to continued education beyond the primary level solidifies the benefits associated with girls’ primary education. Secondary education for girls ensures they receive both the benefits of primary education and the additional benefits linked to further education. Empirical research consistently shows a strong positive correlation between girls’ secondary education and faster economic growth, higher wages for women, slower population growth, and increased labor productivity. According to one estimate, a 1 percent increase in proportion of women enrolled in secondary school will generate a 0.3 percent growth in annual per-capita income. A large body of literature also shows that increasing a mother’s schooling has large effect on her children’s health, schooling, and adult productivity. The social benefits of female education are also demonstrated through postponed marriage and pregnancy, lower fertility rates, decreased child and maternal mortality, reduced transmission of HIV, and greater educational achievement by children. Overall, studies show that increased schooling and gender equality in education lead to poverty reduction and economic growth.\n\nSource\n\nUNESCO’s Institute for Statistics (UIS), http://www.uis.unesco.org. Questions regarding this indicator may be directed to survey@uis.unesco.org or +1 (514) 343-7752.\n\nIndicator Institution Methodology\n\nThe Girls’ Lower Secondary Education Completion Rate indicator measures the percentage of girls in a particular age cohort that have completed lower secondary school within a few years of their expected graduate date. Lower secondary school is defined as a program typically designed to complete the development of basic skills and knowledge which began at the primary level. In many countries, the educational aim is to lay the foundation for lifelong learning and individual development. The programs at this level are usually on a subject-oriented pattern, requiring specialized teachers for each subject area. The end of this level often coincides with the end of compulsory education. For FY24, MCC will use the most recent UNESCO data from 2017 or later.\n\nMCC Methodology\n\nMCC uses the most recent data point in the past six years\n\nMCC draws upon data from UNESCO’s Institute of Statistics as its exclusive source of data. Specifically, MCC uses the indicator named “Completion rate, lower secondary education, female (%)” which corresponds to SDG 4.1.2. To receive an FY24 score, countries must have a UNESCO value on “Completion rate, lower secondary education, female (%)” from 2017 or later. MCC uses the most recent year available that is, MCC uses the most recent data from the past six years. If a country does not have UNESCO data at any point from 2017 or later, it does not receive an FY24 score. As better data become available, UNESCO makes backward revisions to its historical data.\n\nThe Girls’ Lower Secondary Education Completion Rate indicator measures the percentage of a cohort of children or young people aged 3-5 years above the intended age for the last grade of each level of education who have completed that grade. The intended age for the last grade of each level of education is the age at which pupils would enter the grade if they had started school at the official primary entrance age, had studied full-time and had progressed without repeating or skipping a grade. This data is gathered from population censuses and household surveys which collect data on the highest level of education or grade completed by children and young people in a household.\n\nIn FY24 MCC revised its methodology for this indicator to shift from a focus on Girls’ Secondary Education Enrollment to Girls’ Lower Secondary Education Completion. As a result, the scores from FY24 are not comparable to scores from FY23 and earlier.\n\nChild Health Indicator\n\nThis composite indicator measures a government’s commitment to child health as measured by child mortality, the sound management of water resources and water systems, and proper sewage disposal and sanitary control.\n\nRelationship to Growth and Poverty Reduction\n\nImproving child health leads to a more productive and healthier workforce both presently and in the future. Inadequate water and sanitation is the second leading cause of child mortality; it kills more young children than AIDS, malaria, and measles combined. Improved sanitation and increased access to water have numerous economic benefits, including productivity savings in the form of fewer missed days of work or school due to illness from unclean water; the economic contribution of the lives saved from diarrheal disease; decreasing treatment expenditures for diarrheal disease at both the individual and government levels and time savings related to searching for facilities and water collection that would increase time for income-earning work. Vulnerable groups, such as women, children, handicapped individuals and the very poor, are particularly affected by inadequate sanitation and water quality, meaning that improvement in these areas would help these groups the most. In children in particular, improved sanitation and water quality have been found to improve learning outcomes due to alleviating the burden of illness and helminthes (parasites) on cognitive development.\n\nSource\n\nColumbia University’s Center for International Earth Science Information Network (CIESIN) and the Yale Center for Environmental Law and Policy (YCELP), https://www.ciesin.columbia.edu/data/nrpi-chi-2022/Questions regarding this indicator may be directed to ciesin.info@ciesin.columbia.edu or +1 (845) 365-8988.\n\nIndicator Institution Methodology\n\nThis index is calculated as the average of three, equally weighted indicators:\n\nAccess to Improved Sanitation: Produced by the World Health Organization (WHO) and the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF), this indicator measures the percentage of the population with access to facilities that hygienically separate human excreta from human, animal, and insect contact. Facilities such as sewers or septic tanks, pour-flush latrines and simple pit or ventilated improved pit latrines are assumed to be adequate, provided that they are not public and not shared with other households.\n\nAccess to Improved Water: Produced by WHO and UNICEF, this indicator measures the percentage of the population with access to at least 20 liters of water per person per day from an “improved” source (household connections, public standpipes, boreholes, protected dug wells, protected springs, and rainwater collection) within one kilometer of the user’s dwelling and with collection times of no more than 30 minutes.\n\nChild Mortality (Ages 1-4): Produced by the United Nations Inter-agency Group for Child Mortality Estimation (IGME), this indicator measures the probability of dying between ages 1 and 4.\n\nMCC Methodology\n\nCIESIN/YCELP’s Child Health Score = [ 0.33 × Child Mortality ] + [ 0.33 × Access to Water ] + [ 0.33 × Access to Sanitation ]\n\nIn creating the index used for the FY24 data, Columbia University’s Center for International Earth Science Information Network (CIESIN) and the Yale Center for Environmental Law and Policy (YCELP) relied on the most recent child mortality data ages 1-4 (4q1), water access data, and sanitation access data. If no updates from the most recent year were available, previous data were applied. Each of the three components (child mortality, access to water, and access to sanitation) is equally weighted (33.3%) in the overall index. Country scores are reported as 2022 data on the FY24 MCC Country Scorecards. As better data become available, CIESIN and YCELP make backward revisions to historical data. In FY20, CIESIN changed its source of Child Mortality data from the UN Population Division’s World Population Prospects (WPP data) to the United Nations Inter-agency Group for Child Mortality Estimation (IGME data) since IGME updates its data more frequently than WPP. As such, some variation in Child Health data before FY20 could be attributed to the new underlying data source.\n\nNatural Resource Protection\n\nThis indicator assesses a country government’s commitment to preserving biodiversity and natural habitats, responsibly managing ecosystems and fisheries, and engaging in sustainable agriculture.\n\nRelationship to Growth and Poverty Reduction\n\nEnvironmental protection of biomes and the biodiversity and ecosystems within those biomes supports long-term economic growth by providing essential ecosystem goods and services such as natural capital, fertile soil, climate regulation, clean air and water, renewable energy, and genetic diversity. Additionally, appropriate and sustainable management of non-protected ecosystems and the natural resources within those ecosystems promotes agricultural and non-agricultural productivity. Some research suggests that economic growth will be increasingly difficult to sustain as the current population compromises or decimates the biomes that provide the natural resources that are essential to future development or sustenance. Those in poverty, particularly subsistence farmers and those in rural areas, are most likely to be exposed to and affected by environmental degradation and biodiversity loss because they rely so directly on ecosystem services for their food security and livelihood.\n\nSource\n\nThe Environmental Performance Index (EPI) from the Yale Center for Environmental Law and Policy (YCELP), and Columbia University’s Center for International Earth Science Information Network (CIESIN) https://epi.yale.edu/. Questions about this indicator should be directed to epi@yale.edu.\n\nIndicator Institution Methodology\n\nMCC uses four components of this indicator, which are focused on Biodiversity and Habitat, Ecosystem Services, Fisheries, and Agriculture. The Biodiversity and Habitat component measures the share of terrestrial and marine areas that are protected, as well as the protection of rare species and their habitats. The Ecosystem Services component measures annual loss of tree cover, wetlands, and grasslands. The Agriculture component measures the sustainable use of nitrogen and pesticides in farming. The Fisheries component measures the sustainability of fishing practices, including the share of fish caught from overfished populations, and the use of harmful fishing practices such as trawling.\n\nMCC Methodology\n\nMCC combines these four components using EPI’s weighting methodology. EPI assigns each component a specific weight. To compute the overall score, MCC multiplies the score for each component by the weight for that component, adds them together, and divides by the total weight. If a country is missing data for a particular indicator, the weight for that indicator is included in neither the numerator nor the denominator of the fraction. This is most common in landlocked countries which have no fisheries scores.\n\nMCC’s Natural Resource Protection Indicator = [(Agriculture Score × Agriculture Weight) + (Fisheries Score × Fisheries Weight) + (Biodiversity and Habitat Score × Biodiversity and Habitat Weight) + (Ecosystem Services Score × Ecosystem Services Weight)] ÷ [Agriculture Weight + Fisheries Weight + Biodiversity and Habitat Weight + Ecosystem Services Weight]\n\nFor example, using the old data from the 2020 EPI, the weights for these components would be as follows: Agriculture: 0.05, Fisheries: 0.1, Ecosystem Services: 0.1, and Biodiversity and Habitat: 0.25. This means that a country with all four areas measured, such as Cameroon would have their score calculated as follows. Cameroon had the following component scores: Agriculture: 40.4, Fisheries: 10.5, Ecosystem Services: 31.5, and Biodiversity and Habitat: 48.6. The numerator for this calculation is the weighted sum of the four scores i.e. (40.4 × 0.05) + (10.5 × 0.1) + (31.5 × 0.1) + (48.6 × 0.25) = 18.37. The denominator is just the sum of the weights (0.05 + 0.1 + 0.1 + 0.25) = 0.5. Which means Cameroon would have scored 36.74 (18.37 ÷ 0.5). On the other hand, if Cameroon did not have fishing data for that year, fishing would not be included either in the numerator or the denominator making the score without fisheries data 43.3 (17.32 ÷ 0.4).\n\nEncouraging Economic Freedom Category\n\nThe eight indicators in this category measure the extent to which a government encourages economic freedom by assessing, among other things, a country’s demonstrated commitment to economic policies that: encourage individuals and firms to participate in global trade and international capital markets, promote private sector growth, protect private property rights, and strengthen market forces in the economy.\n\nRegulatory Quality Indicator\n\nThis indicator measures the ability of the government to formulate and implement sound policies and regulations that permit and promote private sector development.\n\nCountries are evaluated on the following factors:\n\nprevalence of regulations and administrative requirements that impose a burden on business; ease of starting and closing a new business; ease of registering property;\n\ngovernment intervention in the economy; the extent to which government subsidies keep uncompetitive industries alive;\n\nlabor market policies; employment law provides for flexibility in hiring and firing; wage and price controls;\n\nthe complexity and efficiency of the tax system; pro-investment tax policies;\n\ntrade policy; the height of tariffs barriers; the number of tariff bands; the stability of tariff rates; the extent to which non-tariff barriers are used; the transparency and predictability of the trade regime;\n\ninvestment attractiveness; prevalence of bans or investment licensing requirements; financial regulations on foreign investment and capital; legal restrictions on ownership of business and equity by non-residents; foreign currency regulations; general uncertainty about regulation costs; legal regulation of financial institutions; the extent to which exchange rate policy hinders firm competitiveness;\n\nextensiveness of legal rules and effectiveness of legal regulations in the banking and securities sectors; costs of uncertain rules, laws, or government policies;\n\nthe strength of the banking system; existence of barriers to entry in the banking sector; ease of access to capital markets; protection of domestic banks from foreign competition; whether interest rates are heavily-regulated; transfer costs associated with exporting capital;\n\nparticipation of the private sector in infrastructure projects; dominance of state-owned enterprises; openness of public sector contracts to foreign investors; the extent of market competition; effectiveness of competition and anti-trust policies and legislation;\n\nthe existence of a policy, legal, and institutional framework that supports the development of a commercially-based, market-driven rural finance sector that is efficient, equitable, and accessible to low-income populations in rural areas;\n\nthe adoption of an appropriate policy, legal, and regulatory framework to support the emergence and development of an efficient private rural business sector; the establishment of simple, fast and transparent procedures for establishing private agri-businesses;\n\nthe existence of a policy, legal, and institutional framework that supports the development and liberalization of commercially-based agricultural markets (for inputs and produce) that operate in a liberalized and private sector-led, functionally efficient and equitable manner, and that are accessible to small farmers; and\n\nthe extent to which:\n\ncorporate governance laws encourage ownership and financial disclosure and protect shareholder rights, and are generally enforced;\n\nstate intervention in the goods and land market is generally limited to regulation and/or legislation to smooth out market imperfections;\n\nthe customs service is free of corruption, operates transparently, relies on risk management, processes duty collections, and refunds promptly; and\n\ntrade laws, regulations, and guidelines are published, simplified, and rationalized.\n\nRelationship to Growth and Poverty Reduction\n\nImproved regulatory quality can promote economic growth by creating effective and efficient incentives for the private sector. Conversely, burdensome regulations have a negative impact on economic performance through economic waste and decreased productivity. Researchers at the International Finance Corporation argue that “improving from the worst … to the best … quartile of business regulations implies a 2.3 percentage point increase in average annual growth.” Good regulatory policies help the poor by creating opportunities for entrepreneurship, reducing opportunities for corruption, increasing the quality of public services, and improving the functioning of the housing, service, and labor markets on which they rely.\n\nSource\n\nWorldwide Governance Indicators (WGI) from the World Bank/Brookings Institution, http://info.worldbank.org/governance/wgi/. Questions regarding this indicator may be directed to wgi@worldbank.org or +1 (202) 473-4557.\n\nIndicator Institution Methodology\n\nThis indicator is an index combining a subset of 15 different assessments and surveys, depending on availability, each of which receives a different weight, depending on its estimated precision and country coverage. The Regulatory Quality indicator draws on data, as applicable, from the Country Policy and Institutional Assessments of the World Bank, the African Development Bank, the Asian Development Bank, the World Bank’s Business Environment and Enterprise Performance Survey, Bertelsmann Foundation’s Bertelsmann Transformation Index, the Economist Intelligence Unit’s Country Risk Service, the World Economic Forum’s Global Competitiveness Report, the Heritage Foundation’s Index of Economic Freedom, the International Fund for Agricultural Development’s Rural Sector Performance Assessments, Political Risk Service’s International Country Risk Guide, the Institute for Management and Development’s World Competitiveness Yearbook, The French Government’s Institutional Profiles Database, The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development Transition Report, IHS Markit’s World Economic Service,and the World Justice Project’s Rule of Law Index.\n\nMCC Methodology\n\nMCC Normalized Score = WGI Score - median score\n\nFor ease of interpretation, MCC has adjusted the median for each of the two scorecard income pools to zero for all of the Worldwide Governance Indicators. Country scores are calculated by taking the difference between actual scores and the median. For example, in FY23 the unadjusted median for the scorecard category of countries with a Gross National Income (GNI) per capita between $2,046 and $4,255 on Control of Corruption was -0.47 (note, in FY24, the GNI per capita range for this scorecard category is $2,146 to $4,465). In order to set the median at zero, MCC simply adds 0.47 to each country’s score (the same thing as subtracting a negative 0.47). Therefore, as an example, Algeria’s FY23 Control of Corruption score, which was originally -0.61, was adjusted to -0.14.\n\nThe FY24 scores come from the 2023 update of the Worldwide Governance Indicators dataset and largely reflect performance in calendar year 2022. Since the release of the 2006 update of the Worldwide Governance Indicators, the indicators are updated annually. Each year, the World Bank and Brookings Institution also make minor backward revisions to the historical data. Prior to 2006, the World Bank released data every two years (1996, 1998, 2000, 2002 and 2004). With the 2006 release, the World Bank moved to an annual reporting cycle and provided additional historical data for 2003 and 2005.\n\nLand Rights and Access Indicator\n\nThis indicator evaluates whether and to what extent governments are investing in secure land tenure and property rights.\n\nRelationship to Growth and Poverty Reduction\n\nSecure land tenure plays a central role in the economic growth process by giving people long-term incentives to invest and save their income, enhancing access to essential public services, allowing for more productive use of time and money than protecting land rights, facilitating use of land as collateral for loans, and contributing to social stability and local governance. Improvements in tenure security also favor growth that is “pro-poor” because the benefits generally accrue to those who have not possessed such rights in the past and those who are affected most by high property registration costs. Land policy reform can be particularly meaningful for women: research shows that when women have secure access to land and are able to exercise control over land assets, their ability to earn income is enhanced, household spending on healthcare, nutritious foods, and children’s education increases, and human capital accumulation occurs at a faster rate. Women’s ability to inherit and possess control rights to land also serves as a crucial social safety net. Beyond land, property rights generally contribute to economic growth and poverty reduction.\n\nSources\n\nInternational Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD), http://www.ifad.org, and V-Dem, https://www.v-dem.net/en/. Questions regarding the IFAD indicator may be directed to +39 06 545 92377. Questions regarding the Varieties of Democracy indicator may be directed to address contact@v-dem.net.\n\nIndicator Institution Methodology\n\nThis composite indicator is calculated as the weighted average of three indicators. Access to Land is weighted 50% and Days and Cost to Register Property are each weighted 25%.\n\nAccess to Land: Produced by IFAD, this indicator assesses the extent to which the institutional, legal, and market framework provides secure land tenure and equitable access to land in rural areas. It is made up of four subcomponents: (1) the effectiveness of the land tenure system; (2) the effectiveness of land markets; (3) the equitable management of communal lands; and (4) the existence of gender-based impediments to access. IFAD’s operational staff base their assessments on a questionnaire and guideposts identifying the basis of each scoring level, available at https://webapps.ifad.org/members/gc/42/docs/GC-42-L-6.pdf or https://webapps.ifad.org/members/eb/125/docs/EB-2018-125-R-4-Add-1.pdf. Past datasets can be found in the documents of IFAD’s governing council https://webapps.ifad.org/members/gc.\n\nProperty Rights (v2xcl-prpty): Produced by the Varieties of Democracy Institute (V-Dem), this index measures the rights to acquire, possess, inherit, and sell private property, including land. It measures both de jure limits on legal property rights, but also de facto limits that may come in the form of customary law, religious law, common practice, or social norms. This indicator is assessed separately for men and women, and then averaged together. V-Dem gathers these data by surveying experts and aggregating their answers into a single index. More information on V-Dem’s methodology can be found here https://www.v-dem.net/en/our-work/methods/.\n\nMCC Aggregation Methodology\n\nMCC’s Land Rights and Access Score = [0.5 × Normalized IFAD] + [0.5 × (Normalized V-Dem)]\n\nThis index draws on 2021 “Access to Land” data from the International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD) and 2022 data from V-Dem on Property rights (v2xcl-prpty). Country scores are reported on the Scorecards as 2022 data. When IFAD data from the current year is missing, normalized data from V-Dem is used. When V-Dem is missing data, the indicator is considered missing, and a country will receive an N/A for this indicator on the scorecard.\n\nSince each of the two sub-components of this index have different scales, MCC created a common scale for each of the indicators by normalizing them. Please see equations below. Both scales are inverted so that a higher score corresponds to better performance.\n\nMCC Methodology to Normalize IFAD and V-Dem Data:\n\nNormalized IFAD = 1 – ((Maximum observed value - Country X’s raw score) ÷ (Maximum observed value -Minimum observed value))\n\nNormalized Property Rights = 1 – ((Maximum observed value - Country X’s raw score) ÷ (Maximum observed value -Minimum observed value))\n\nFor example, to calculate a given country X’s score, MCC first finds the maximum and minimum value for that year. MCC then subtracts country X’s score from the maximum to get the numerator and subtract the minimum from the maximum to get the denominator. MCC divides the numerator by the denominator to get the inverted normalized value. Next, MCC subtracts this quotient from 1, to get the normalized value for a country. Finally, MCC averages the normalized values for each source together. If IFAD is missing, the normalized V-Dem score is used, but if V-Dem is missing the indicator is considered missing and assigned an “N/A” because V-Dem has higher country coverage and more recent data.\n\nIn FY22 MCC revised its methodology for this indicator to expand the populations and concepts covered and to focus more on broad-based property rights. As a result, the scores from FY22 are not comparable to scores from FY21 and earlier.

Relationship to Growth and Poverty Reduction\n\nThe ability to access affordable credit is a critical element of private sector led growth, particularly for small businesses that often lack the initial capital needed to grow and expand and also for agricultural households, where expenditures on inputs precede the returns from harvest; it also increases a business or household’s ability to bear and cope with risk. Financial inclusion and access to both formal and informal financial instruments are crucial for rural and poor populations to be able to manage uncertain and uneven incomes and alleviate the costs of poverty while promoting inclusive growth. Improving credit access for small business and poor populations can have a substantial impact on agricultural development, poverty reduction, and broad-based economic growth.\n\nSources\n\nInternational Monetary Fund, Financial Development Index https://data.imf.org/?sk=F8032E80-B36C-43B1-AC26-493C5B1CD33B and the World Bank Findex Database https://globalfindex.worldbank.org/. Questions regarding the IMF data may be directed to JMarzluf@imf.org. Questions regarding the Findex data may be directed to lklapper@worldbank.org.\n\nIndicator Institution Methodology\n\nThe Access to Credit composite indicator is calculated by taking the simple average of two indicators from the IMF and Findex, which have been normalized and ranked on equivalent scales:\n\nFinancial Institution Access (IMF): MCC uses the Financial Institution Access indicator from the IMF’s Financial Development Index. This indicator has two sub indicators: the number of bank branches per 100,000 adults from the World Bank’s FinStats, and the number of ATMs per 100,000 adults from the IMF’s Financial Access Surveys.\n\nShare of adults with an account (Findex): From the World Bank’s Findex Database, MCC uses the share of the population (adults 15+) with an account. This survey counts both accounts with traditional financial institutions and mobile money.\n\nMCC Methodology\n\nMCC’s Access to Credit Score = [ 0.5 × Normalized IMF] + [ 0.5 × (Normalized Findex)]\n\nThis index draws on 2020 data from the Findex database (as well as 2021 data for those countries added to the dataset in the March 2023 update) and 2021 data published in 2023 by the IMF. Country scores are reported on the Scorecards as 2022 data. When one indicator is missing data, the other is used. Since each of the two sub-components of this index have different scales, MCC created a common scale for each of the indicators by normalizing them. Please see equations below. Both scales are then inverted so that a higher score corresponds to better performance.\n\nMCC Methodology to Normalize IMF and Findex Data:\n\nNormalized IMF = 1 – ((Maximum observed value - Country X’s raw score) ÷ (Maximum observed value -Minimum observed value))\n\nNormalized Findex = 1 – ((Maximum observed value - Country X’s raw score) ÷ (Maximum observed value -Minimum observed value))\n\nFor example, to calculate a given country X’s score, MCC first finds the maximum and minimum value for that year. MCC then subtracts country X’s score from the maximum to get the numerator and subtracts the minimum from the maximum to get the denominator. MCC divides the numerator by the denominator to get the inverted normalized value. Next, MCC subtracts this quotient from 1, to get the normalized value for a country. Finally, MCC averages the normalized values for each source together. If either score is missing, the other is used, but if both scores are missing, the country is given an “N/A”.\n\nIn FY22 MCC revised its methodology for this indicator to expand the populations and concepts covered and to focus more on financial inclusion. As a result, the scores from FY22 are not comparable to scores from FY21 and earlier. For more information about how MCC is making these business climate indicators more inclusive, visit: https://www.mcc.gov/blog/entry/blog-101921-financial-inclusion.\n\nEmployment Opportunity Indicator\n\nThis indicator measures a country government’s commitment to ending slavery and forced labor, preventing employment discrimination, and protecting the rights of workers and people with disabilities.\n\nRelationship to Growth and Poverty Reduction\n\nThis indicator encourages governments to invest in policies that drive economic growth and poverty reduction by supporting policies that ensure everyone has an equal opportunity to earn a fair wage in four areas: employment discrimination, disability rights, forced labor, and the ability of civil society organizations (CSOs) to start-up and shutdown. Broadly, employment discrimination increases poverty through denied employment and social exclusion, while equality of employment opportunities can drive economic growth and social inclusion. The inclusion of people with disabilities in the economy and employment opportunities is key to robust and inclusive economic growth. This is particular critical in developing countries, as people with disabilities make up a disproportionate share of the global poor and supporting the rights of these groups is a crucial component of poverty reduction. Forced labor impedes the ability of individuals to earn a fair wage and exacerbates poverty such as by keeping individuals in debt bondage, preventing them from being able to earn anything or ever become free. CSOs are included because they are instrumental in ensuring that de jure employment protections and other laws are enforced.\n\nSources and Indicator Institution Methodologies\n\nIV. UCLA’s WORLD Policy Analysis Center’s data on Disability Rights and Employment Discrimination. https://www.worldpolicycenter.org/. MCC uses 20 questions related to disability rights and employment discrimination from this data source. Questions regarding this portion of the indicator may be directed to Gonzalo Moreno gmoreno@ph.ucla.edu.\n\nWORLD Policy Analysis Center Methodology: WORLD regularly reviews the laws and constitutions of countries to determine whether certain rights are protected.\n\nDisability Rights: From WORLD’s disability dataset, MCC uses the following seven questions. These questions are coded as binary, where a legal right provides countries with one point, and anything less gives zero points. These questions are then averaged so that each country is given a sub-score for disability rights between 0 and 1 that represents the share of rights protected.\n\nDoes the constitution explicitly guarantee equality or non-discrimination for persons with disabilities? (“Guaranteed right” = 1, all else = 0)\n\nDoes the constitution explicitly require schools or educational institutions to be physically accessible? (“School accessibility explicitly guaranteed” = 1, all else = 0)\n\nDoes the constitution explicitly guarantee the right to work for adults with disabilities? (“Guaranteed right” or “Work rights generally guaranteed and disability discrimination prohibited” = 1, all else = 0)\n\nAre employers required to guarantee reasonable accommodation to workers with disabilities? (“Yes” = 1, all else = 0)\n\nDoes the constitution explicitly require public places and/or public transportation to be physically accessible? (“Accessibility explicitly guaranteed in both public places and public transportation” or “Accessibility guaranteed in one area” = 1, all else = 0)\n\nIs disability-based discrimination prohibited through the completion of secondary education? (“Discrimination broadly prohibited) = 1, all else = 0)\n\nWhat is the guaranteed level of inclusion through the completion of secondary education for students with disabilities? (“Integration in mainstream schools and guaranteed support”, “Integration in mainstream schools”, and “Guaranteed, unclear level of integration” = 1, all else = 0)\n\nEmployment Discrimination: From the WORLD dataset on Employment Discrimination, MCC uses the following questions:\n\nIs there at least some explicit legislative prohibition of workplace discrimination based on disability?\n\nIs there at least some explicit legislative prohibition of workplace discrimination based on religion?\n\nIs there at least some explicit legislative prohibition of workplace discrimination based on race/ethnicity?\n\nIs there at least some explicit legislative prohibition of workplace discrimination based on gender identity?\n\nIs there at least some explicit legislative prohibition of workplace discrimination based on political affiliation?\n\nIs there at least some explicit legislative prohibition of workplace discrimination based on social class?\n\nIs there at least some explicit legislative prohibition of workplace discrimination based on age?\n\nIs there at least some explicit legislative prohibition of workplace discrimination based on marital status?\n\nIs there at least some explicit legislative prohibition of workplace discrimination based on maternal status?\n\nIs there at least some explicit legislative prohibition of workplace discrimination based on paternal status?\n\nIs there at least some explicit legislative prohibition of workplace discrimination based on migrant status?\n\nIs there at least some explicit legislative prohibition of workplace discrimination based on foreign national origin?\n\nIs there at least some explicit legislative prohibition of workplace discrimination based on sexual orientation?\n\nEach of these responses are coded into binary variables (1 for “yes” to any protection for each group in a question (UCLA codes a “5” in their data set as a “yes”) and 0 for “no” or if only some of the groups in question are protected) and then averaged (i.e. all of the 1’s are added together and then divided by 13). This means that the resulting employment discrimination sub-indicator is the percentage of protected classes that are covered by some explicit legal provision prohibiting discrimination against them in a given country.\n\nV.
