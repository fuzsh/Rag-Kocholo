        "text": "Linear Algebra\n\nSpeed up linear algebra computations with low-level routines that operate on vectors and matrices and are compatible with these industry-standard BLAS and LAPACK operations:\n\nLevel 1: Vector-vector operations\n\nLevel 2: Matrix-vector operations\n\nLevel 3: Matrix-matrix operations\n\nSparse Linear Algebra Functions\n\nPerform various operations on sparse matrices with low-level and inspector-executor routines including the following:\n\nMultiply sparse matrix with dense vector\n\nMultiply sparse matrix with dense matrix\n\nSolve linear systems with triangular sparse matrices\n\nSolve linear systems with general sparse matrices\n\nFast Fourier Transforms (FFT)\n\nTransform a signal from its original domain (typically time or space) into a representation in the frequency domain and back. Use FFT functions in one, two, or three dimensions with support for mixed radices. The supported functions include complex-to-complex and real-to-complex transforms of arbitrary length in single precision and double precision.\n\nRandom Number Generator Functions (RNG)\n\nUse common pseudorandom, quasi-random, and nondeterministic random number engines to solve continuous and discrete distributions.\n\nData Fitting\n\nProvide spline-based interpolation capabilities that you can use to approximate functions, function derivatives or integrals, and perform cell search operations.\n\nVector Math\n\nBalance accuracy and performance with vector-based elementary functions. Manipulate values with traditional algebraic and trigonometric functions.\n\nSummary Statistics\n\nCompute basic statistical estimates (such as raw or central sums and moments) for single- and double-precision multidimensional datasets.\n\nThese benchmarks are offered to help you make informed decisions about which routines to use in your applications, including performance for each major function domain in oneMKL by processor family. Some benchmark charts only include absolute performance measurements for specific problem sizes. Others compare previous versions, popular alternative open source libraries, and other functions for oneMKL.\n\nDiscussion on 4th Gen Intel® Xeon® Scalable Processor Benchmarks"
