Entries for this tournament wil. clbae January 10th, on the date of the dinner given for the recently closed Winter tournament. The tournament games will begin on or about January 22. Five men teams will roll under the usual rules and regulations. mm UKSTKK TO HAVE OWN COUNCIL The marriage of Miss Elizabeth Webster Passano, daughter of Profes- sor and Mrs. L. M.

If a girl has a pretty face, no man «.n earth can tell you what kind of clothes she has on. Fewer marriages would prove failures if the contracting par- ties would act after marriage as considerately as they did before.

ADVOCATES FEDERAL OWNER- SHIP OF ROADS Prof. Charles Zueblin, speaking at. the Temple Israel forum Sunday night advocated government ownership of the railroads. He stated his eager- ness, however, to see the roads once more revert to private control in order that the people of the nation may have pointed illustration of the contrast be- tween public and private management. The restoration of the roads to the control of their owners, he maintained, will only hasten government owner- ship. He defended the Plumb plan, de- claring that it would increase the ef- ficiency of the railroad employees by giving them greater responsibility. You have more'n likely noticed.

Notwith- standing the fact that the volume of parcel post and letter mail was by far the largest ever handled by the local Post Office, there was no delay in the delivery or the dispatch of matter. One feature brought out was the decided n I of a new office. The congestion before the windows on tin- few days before the holiday- was largely due to the small space available. Postmaster O'Connor and his corps of clerks and carriers de- Serve credit for their labor and the efficient results. It is said that the bill now pending for an additional appropriation of $22.r.O0 for the proposed Federal building here will be acted upon within a few weeks. The work of t;ikinu the national census begins today i Friday I The census takers will visit every house, manufactory and business place in Winchester in the work of gathering the statistics for the government. Residents should bear in mind that all questions asked are only those required by the government. The enumerator has enough work to do in collecting the necessary informa- tion without asking needless or un- wnrauted questions Such Informa- tion as is given is strictly confiden- tial and everyone who answers the list put to him cheerfully and ac- curately will not only make it easier for the census taker, but for himself as well. The work has to be done, the questions are only (host prede- termined by the government, and the census taker has power to make it very unpleasant for those who re- fuse to give the desired information. THE FOICTXIUHTLY NOTES The next regular meeting of The Fortnightly will occur January 12. This will be an open meeting to which the public may be admitted by ticket at the door.

Philistia, and later the St. Louis of Palestine, has been damaged.\" says a bulletin from the Washington head- iiuarters of the National Geographic Society. \"Modern Gaza is set upon a hill, some 100 feet above the surroundings and dunes and verdant garden spots. It is the hill, and not the present city, which has yielded some of the richest treasures of recent Assyrian study. \"The fortunes of geography laid Gaza open to the misfortunes of war. Not only was the ancient city the fo- cus of all the sea roads of the days when the Mediterranean encompassed the civilized world's commerce, but it teas nicknamed \"the port of the desert. It was on the edge of a sea of sand, depot of the freight-laden caravans be- tween Egypt, Babylonia and Arabia; provisioning point, too, for the Bed- ouins. Captain Kidds of the rolling desert. \"Gaza, in lt»14 had about 40,000 people, considerably fewer than it had 2.000 years ago, but the number rep- resented a rapid growth for an eastern city, since it was but a straggling vil- lage of 2.000 in 1840, and had but l. r >,- 000 a half century ago. \"Its site had been hallowed by the passing of nearly 4,000 years of re- corded history, and while 'the way that goeth down from Jerusalem unto Gaza' may have seemed a considerable journey to Philip, Gaza is but a little farther to the southwest «>f Jerusalem than Washington is from Baltimore. \"Today the city is three miles re- moved from the sea, and for a long time it was thought that after its de- struction by Alexander Jannaeus, a Jewish Richard HI of a cenury before Christ's time, it had been rebuilt at a new site. Researches show it to be more probable that the ancient 'Da- mascus of the South' extended from the site of the modern city to the sea. No Arnold Bennet lived to make the life of the 'five towns-' a Philistine league of cities that included Gaza, vivid to future generation* of readers, but Herodotus th? Greek Macauley. acclaimed it eoua! to Sardis. \"Residents in Gaza will show th<> visitor Sarosi n's tomb.

HUNTERS Never has the scientific brain been in such demand as it has been during the recent conflict, am! never ha^ human ingenuity s\" exhibited its pow- ers as it has -:n i- that thrilling day «>f August, i.-li. when \"the fountains «f the great deep were broken up.\" | and tl\"- whole world seemed thrown into tl.' 1 melting cauldron of fut<-. • Kveay day there are wcurmg without i comment things that would have pro- ' duced universal amazement at any | other period of the world's history.! There an iruns which hurl their pro- , jectiles fourscore miles. There are; ships which ran rest securely on the; bottom of the sea for days and in- stantly rise to the surface when the danger is over. There are shells tiuried into the sky which remain aloft for hours. lighting up the battlefields bright a- day for many miles around There are projectiles which in their explosion spread deadly jrases around which may destroy whole regiment!) almost in an instant. Finally we have flying machines which can rise up miles in the air and fly over moun- tains, seas and rivers with the speed of lightning for hundreds of miles, carrying bombs that will sink a cer- tain number of feet in the water and there explode with deadly violence to any ship in their near neighbourhood. Messages are sent around the world without jhe use of a wire and whispers have been heard of steering ships at sea an.l exploding charges many milea away by the use of the wireless cur- rent which thus seems to act like an impulse of the mind itself. The avia- tor has hitherto been most valuable as a range-finder and a dropper of de- struction from the skies. He is now regularly employed in carrying mails between city and city, and bat yester- day came the report that he is being used as a policeman and a punisher in uisoruer in distant and not easily approachable places. The Atlas Moun- tains, now as in ancient times, are the very synonym of distance, obscurity and inaccessability. Situated in the Southern part of the Western Barbary States, they have for aires been the refuge of the wildest outlaws driven from among the more respectable peo- ple of the cities and plains. These bunds of outlaws have been a thorn in the side of France for ten years past as they have been in the side of other conquerors for ages. To keep order ami to introduce civilization called for action. To send an army of occupa- tion was inconvenient since 1014, and so the work was handed over to the Aviation Department. As a result the terrified and amazed Bedouins found their fastnesses on the moun- tains assailed by gigantic armed birds which sought them out everywhere ami brought death whenever resisted. Surprise and superstitious terror pro- duced peace instantcr and now there is a regular aviation sendee from the coa«t across the Atlas range to the settlements far south.
