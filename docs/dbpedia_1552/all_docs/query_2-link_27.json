        "text": "History\n\nWe Butter the Bread with Butter was founded in 2007 by Marcel Neumann, who was originally guitarist for Martin Kesici's band, and Tobias Schultka. The band was originally meant as a joke, but progressed into being a more serious musical duo. The name for the band has no particular meaning, although its origins were suggested from when the two original members were driving in a car operated by Marcel Neumann and an accident almost occurred. Neumann found Schultka \"so funny that he briefly lost control of the vehicle.\" Many of their songs from this point were covers of German folk tales and nursery rhymes.\n\nOn the \"Infiziert-Tour 2008\" (German: 'Infected-Tour 2008') they performed together with the German metalcore band Callejon and the post-hardcore band, The Parachutes in major cities in Germany such as Berlin, Frankfurt, Hamburg, Cologne and Stuttgart and furthermore opened for A Day to Remember multiple times. After that, both members turned to the production of their second full-length album, Der Tag an dem die Welt unterging, which was released on May 14, 2010 in Germany, the USA and Japan. During the production of the album, three new musicians joined WBTBWB with Kenneth Iain Duncan now being the second guitarist, Maximilian Pauly Saux playing the bass and Can Özgünsür as drummer.\n\nTobias Schultka, vocalist and founding member of We Butter the Bread with Butter when the group was a duo, parted ways with the band in June 2010. The reason stated was because he wanted to focus into being an application developer for Apple Inc.

Schultka has since been replaced by Paul Bartzsch.\n\nOn June 28, 2012, Kenneth Duncan announced his departure from the band via his personal Facebook page, citing creative and personal differences.\n\nOn October 28, 2012 the band posted a video on YouTube called We Butter the Bread with Butter - New EP and Album Trailer.
