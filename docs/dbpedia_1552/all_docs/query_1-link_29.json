        "meta_description": "Weites Herz by ctraltu, released 07 October 2023\n\n1. Das Schweigen der Hirsche\n2. Für die Unbeugsamen\n3. Horror Housesitter\n4. maryrene\n5. sun und schnaps\n6. U make my heart beat\n7. weites Herz\n8. U make my heart beat (vocal version)\n\nCtrl-Alt-U is a project from Thomas Steffen. Born in 1965, Steffen has been a drummer since he was 13 and has studied music science. Steffen has worked in different bands, projects, and film music for Dance 3D Filmfest Barcelona in 2013.\r\n\r\nInstrument(s):\r\nDrums, guitar, bass, sax, trumpet, and others.\r\n\r\nTeachers and/or influences?\r\nWolfgang Eckholt was my drum teacher. I have been influenced by Miles Davis, Erik Truffaz, John Coltrane, and Stan Getz.\r\n\r\nI knew I wanted to be a musician when...\r\nI was 13 and I had to wait another year to get a drum set from my parents; they gave me bongos first and I played them for a year.\r\n\r\nYour sound and approach to music:\r\nI love the lo- fi vibe. I like music from the moment. Make it and feel it—don&#39;t edit it too much.\r\n\r\nYour teaching approach:\r\nYou must have sounds and pictures in your head. I learned to improvise while looking at silent television shows— it works.\r\n\r\nYour dream band:\r\nI would love to work with electro-pop musician, Schiller. I like his way of chilled out electronica combined with singers.\r\n\r\nRoad story: Your best or worst experience:\r\nI had to play during a book launch—four hours driving to the venue and back—but by the time I played my slotted time, the audience went outside for a smoke break.\r\n\r\nFavorite venue:\r\nHundertmeister Duisburg, which is excellent. Today it is called the Grammatikof.\r\n\r\nYour favorite recording in your discography and why?\r\npure (Self Produced, 2013). It is rough and was quickly recorded.\r\n\r\nThe first Jazz album I bought was:\r\nCharly Antolini, Knock Out (Jeton, 1979).\r\n\r\nWhat do you think is the most important thing you are contributing musically?\r\nI am always ready to play.\r\n\r\nDid you know...\r\nThat I studied music science and made my exam about Mozart, Bruckner, and the architecture of organs\r\n\r\nfrom all about jazz https://www.allaboutjazz.com/take-five-with-thomas-steffen-thomas-steffen-by-thomas-steffen",
