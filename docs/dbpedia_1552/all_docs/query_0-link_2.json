The band was originally meant as a joke but progressed into being a more serious musical duo.\n\nThe band's name \"We Butter the Bread with Butter\" came from being bored with many other metal band names, which are often long and sound dark. Instead, they chose that is similarly long, but makes it clear the band are super normal guys who are into music. Its origins were suggested when the two original members were driving in a car operated by Marcel Neumann and an accident almost occurred. Neumann found Schultka \"so funny that he briefly lost control of the vehicle.\" [4] Many of their songs from this point were covers of German folk tales and nursery rhymes. [5]\n\nOn the \"Infiziert-Tour 2008\" (German: 'Infected-Tour 2008') they performed together with the German metalcore band Callejon and the post-hardcore band, The Parachutes in major cities in Germany such as Berlin, Frankfurt, Hamburg, Cologne and Stuttgart [1] [3] [6] and furthermore opened for A Day to Remember multiple times. [6] After that, both members turned to the production of their second full-length album, Der Tag an dem die Welt unterging , which was released on 14 May 2010 in Germany, the US and Japan.

On 20 January 2017 the band released a music video for a song called Klicks. Likes. Fame. Geil! via AFM Records.\n\nOn 12 April 2019 Paul Bartzsch announced his departure from the band via his personal Instagram, the reason being that things happened in the past without [his] knowledge. Paul also uploaded a picture announcing his departure to Instagram, saying \"Thank you for all the support over the past 8 years!
