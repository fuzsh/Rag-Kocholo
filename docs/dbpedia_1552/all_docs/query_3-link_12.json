Bowers Dr. Richardson was g led by Mr. Rowe as follows: \"You. I ! r. are perhaps wondering why the men and women of our church have asked yon and your good wife, your son and daughters, to sather here tonight, because you have probably forgotten having mentioned two years ago today to one of our church members that If JOU lived '.'7 years mor<\\ you would be a century plant, but this Joking remark has been kept in careful re- membrance, and some of the men In the parish thought it was foolish to wait for the \"century plant\" to ful- ly mature before having some pleas- ure at your expense, and as you are now three quarters matured, It seemed to those men a luting time to present to you some slight, ;oken of their affection nnd appreciation of the work you are now doing and hav < been doing in our church. \"Some of these men were a little : jifralu If they waited until von were fully matured they might not be | jiround tii do you honor and hence they have rither selfishly concluded i as this ts your Diamond Knnlver- BBry, it would he a pood time for I them to Indulge themselves in j the pleasure they have been looking ! forward to. There have been four ring leaders in this conspiracy, all equally entity, and there has been much rivalry for the honor of making these opening remarks. All four of the ring lead- ! ers have brought influence to bear to be chosen for the honor, one of them going so far as to invoke the | aid of the Republican Town Com The following poem was read, as •he gift was presented : Cyrus Richardson, March \"n, is in, l iracut, Massachusetts, \\ century ago — or somewhat less — There came Into a Dracut home one day A brand-new baby who forthwith began His strong career of conquest nnd of play.

On Saturday evening, March 27, ! at the Town Hall the Amherst Col- lege Musical Clubs rendered one of the most pleasing conceits beard in Winchester in several year.-. The audience of four seemed t<> enjoy the varied pi to the fullest extent, for not a dull moment was in evidence and the re- peated calls for encores were more than the bovs could respond to. The two Amherst songs: \"Lord Jeffery Amherst\" and \"Cheer for Old Am- herst,\" rendered by the combined < 'lubs, were exceedingly well received, as were also the Harmony Duo of Cellos and the Banjo solo by Mr. Brinkerhoff. The medley by the C!ee Club Quar- tet called forth several reapperances and Mr. Lyon's double rendition of \"Under the Spreading Chestnut Tree\" fairly took the house by storm . After the concert dancing was enjoyed by a large number of people until nearly midnight. Taken as a whole the even- ing was one long to be remembered by all. The Hoard met at present. The records March 23 and approved. Warrants were drawn for $31 \">8 35 an! $2212.12. B. A: M Railroad.

The proposition is to represent the public schools in the homes, with the idea of bringing about a better under- standing between teacher and pupil and a closer relation between tne achool and the home. A prominent Winchester gentleman with whom The Spectator has discussed the pro- ; position believe- that encouraging ad- vance would come about in many Cases where the family visitor would make plan, the attitude of the school, or would show the home the desira- bility of removing some handicap from the child that would give him a fairer chance in school, or would bring to the teacher some word of home conditions that would make her better acquainted with the peculiar need, of some pupil. The scheme is ideal. The weakness of the public school system, in that it must consider the chil- dren in the mass, treating them all pretty much alike without re- gard to personal bent, is a very real conditio:., though its statement in so broad term- exaggerates it to the un- thinking mind, since the individuality of the child forces recognition from the school and the teacher and the work to a very considerable degree. The degree to which this advantage the child depends upon, the school and the spirit of the different teachers in relation to his personal progress, 'lo some teachers the instruction is the important matter; to some others the living child is the center of interest, and then the child is fortunate in be- tonally conducted along the learning and of living. Hut a recognized limit to the possibility in this direction, city or town can see its way sending tactful, helpful per- il the homes of the children, the policeman truant officer spirit, but as a friendly visitor to make things plain, to clear the path of obstructions, and encourage and sympathize, the public school will till a larger and more important place than ever in relation to the com- munity. Hut for all the desirability of a closer connection between the school and home, there is doubt as to the need and practicability of the adop- tion of the school visitor. In towns of Winchester's si/.e the chances for contact are many without the inter- vention of a third party. And how- ever strongly the scheme may appeal, there must be no overlooking the fact that it-, success must inevitably de- pend upon the willingness of the home and the pupils to profit by it. Such a co-operative spirit in the home will not find itself without guidance from the school under present conditions. INSTRUCTOR APPOINTED. at Manches NbWM* I'AK.U.KAFHS.

A meeting was called on the even- ing of March P2, 1915, by Commander John T. Wilson of the A. D. Weld Post of the G. A. R., at the Post Room for the purpose of organizing a Winchester Camp of the Sous of Veterans of the C. S. A. At the meeting there were a number present who were eligible to membership in such a camp and all were very much in favor of the camp being organized in Winchester. There were not suffi- cient present to constitute the neces- sary number for organization, and a committee was appointed to take charge of organizing the camp and get in touch with the different men who were eligible for membership. As the ranks of the (',. A. R. are rapidly thinning out, it seems very ddsirable that a camp of Sons of Veterans be organized in Winchester to perpetuate the names and the ser- vices of the <L A. R. veterans. All persons who are eligible as sons of veterans or descendants of veterans of the Civil War ate requested to tret in touch with some member of tin 1 committee named below and become a member of the camp to be organized here. Committee: Roland 11. Sherman. 14 Everett avenue. Winchester, and 20 Pemberton square, Hoston; George 11. Morse, »>4 Cross street, Winches- ter: W. Minot Hurd, 11 Lakeview road, Winchester, and 20 Pemberton square, Hoston. The Western Union Telegraph Com- pany ha- taken a live year lease of the store in the new Star Building, and mi April 1-1 opened a modern tele- graph office in this location. For the last two and a half years the tele- graph service in Winchester has been handled through the telephone office and prior to that at the 1!. & M. station. While the change is brought about to some extent by the general policy of separating the telephone and tele- graph companies, patrons may still telephone their messages to the office and have them charged on their tele- phone bills. The principal reason tor opening the new office, however, is j the increased patronage the Company has received from the citizens ot Winchester and vicinity, in view of which it feels justified in providing new and more convenient quarters with increased facilities for handling its business. The new arrangement should result in an improvement in service as __the office will be open daily from 7.30 a. m. to 9.00 p. m., and from '.» to 10 a. m. and •\"> to 6 p. m. on Sundays Killing the hours the office is closed pat ions wishing to send messages will be connected with the Hoston office without any extra charge for the tele- phone toll.\" and messages will be ac- cepted and sent dated Winchester ex- actly as though the office here were open. Likewise messages addressed to j Winchester and received when the office is closed will be telephoned to j the' addressees without charge from ! Hoston. In addition to handling the regular . classes of telegrams and cables the new office will accept money to be transmitted by telegraph and will make payments on orders so received. Mi-< Grace S. Delmege, formerly with the Western Union at. Plymouth. Mass., has been appointed Manager and will have charge of the office and other employees. Suits or he ripped dyed bj Ma^anda^i .

It wa.s the Fortnightly this time that gave to us the psychological mo- ment and a glimpse of our lost youth.

Miss Hall with two, and Miss Godfrey with one, were unable to add to the Swampscott team's score. In spite of the penalties, most of the fouls were due to slight violations of the rules. The Winchester backs kept Miss Irene Caproni so well covered that she threw only eight baskets. Miss Rey- nolds of Winchester duplicated Miss Caproni's performance and Miss Ken- dall, with five from the floor and seven from the line, was the high scorer.
