        "text": "We should talk about Russell Wilson. Today, it was announced that he would be benched for the rest of the season. Less than two years ago, Russ was traded in a mega-deal to the Denver Broncos from the Seattle Seahawks. His time in Denver is probably over. Russ wanted a fresh start, but he also wanted more money, he wanted to be the main star, and he thought he could bring his talents to another franchise and repeat the success he had in his early days as a Seahawk. It didn't work out. Tony Zarsadias once said to me, \"Sometimes you can't read the label when you're stuck inside the bottle.\" Russ had it great in Seattle. He had a fan base that adored him, a coach that protected him, a franchise that supported him, and peers that went to bat for him. Somehow, he didn't see it the same way and thought his value was greater elsewhere. The grass isn't always greener, so take note of your environment and surroundings before you jump to the next opportunity. Be aware of your value and worth, but also be accepting of what more money could bring. New organizations bring new expectations that may leave you wishing you never left.\n\nJOCKO + DIRT WORLD = GOOD Two years ago, I attended Muster 010 in Orlando. Last year, I went through Echelon Front's Field Training Excercise event in Nashville. And this year, in October, Jocko, Jamie, JP Dinnell, and Codey will lead a one-day Muster at the first Dirt World Summit in Houston. These have been truly life-changing experiences for me, and I feel so grateful to have been afforded these opportunities. I've reflected on this many times and here's the reality: BuildWitt sent me through both of these trainings. Muster was $2,600, and the FTX was $5,000 + travel. Whenever I tell people that, most almost fall over. \"No way, that is so expensive.\" But knowing what I know now, I would pay out of pocket for both in a heartbeat. Not because I have money to throw around, but because it's worth every penny. Here's my philosophy: If you lead others, need to lead yourself, or have a goal you really want to achieve, you need to become the kind of person capable of doing so. The way you become a capable person is through learning. Leadership is a perishable skill. The real question is, what is the cost of not upgrading my leadership ability? Every day I suck at leading others or myself is another day full of missed opportunities, frustration, and treading water. I want to be in the room to get new perspectives, relationships, tactics, and strategies so I can learn how to win. The same goes for you. And if you are responsible for ten people, your increased leadership ability has a cascading ripple effect and an infinite ROI. You can't get that by sitting in your office looking at your computer. I'm not going to tell you what to do, but if you're a hungry leader in the Dirt World, I'd recommend securing your spot for the Dirt World Summit. Jocko or the other 12+ incredible speakers won't disappoint. Houston | October 25-27, 2023 | Link in the comments #betterdirtworld PS. Happy to chat about Summit if you have questions - shoot me a DM"
