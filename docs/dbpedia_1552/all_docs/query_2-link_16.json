        "text": "We Butter the Bread with Butter was founded in 2007 by Marcel Neumann, who was originally guitarist for Martin Kesici's band, and Tobias Schultka. The band was originally meant as a joke, but progressed into being a more serious musical duo. The name for the band has no particular meaning, although its origins were suggested from when the two original members were driving in a car operated by Marcel Neumann and an accident almost occurred. Neumann found Schultka \"so funny that he briefly lost control of the vehicle.\" A tribute band I Can't Believe It's Not We Butter The Bread With Butter was founded later in 2007.\n\nOn the \"Infiziert-Tour 2008\" (German: 'Infected-Tour 2008') they performed together with the German metalcore band Callejon and the post-hardcore band, The Parachutes in major cities in Germany such as Berlin, Frankfurt, Hamburg, Cologne and Stuttgart and furthermore opened for A Day to Remember multiple times.
