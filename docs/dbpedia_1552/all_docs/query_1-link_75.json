        "meta_description": "Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death worldwide. Advanced insights into disease mechanisms and therapeutic strategies require a deeper understanding of the molecular processes involved in the healthy heart. Knowledge of the full repertoire of cardiac cells and their gene expression profiles is a fundamental first step in this endeavour. Here, using state-of-the-art analyses of large-scale single-cell and single-nucleus transcriptomes, we characterize six anatomical adult heart regions. Our results highlight the cellular heterogeneity of cardiomyocytes, pericytes and fibroblasts, and reveal distinct atrial and ventricular subsets of cells with diverse developmental origins and specialized properties. We define the complexity of the cardiac vasculature and its changes along the arterio-venous axis. In the immune compartment, we identify cardiac-resident macrophages with inflammatory and protective transcriptional signatures. Furthermore, analyses of cell-to-cell interactions highlight different networks of macrophages, fibroblasts and cardiomyocytes between atria and ventricles that are distinct from those of skeletal muscle. Our human cardiac cell atlas improves our understanding of the human heart and provides a valuable reference for future studies. Single-cell and single-nucleus RNA sequencing are used to construct a cellular atlas of the human heart that will aid further research into cardiac physiology and disease.",

        "text": "Data reporting\n\nNo statistical methods were used to predetermine sample size. The experiments were not randomized, and investigators were not blinded to allocation during experiments and outcome assessment.\n\nResearch ethics for donor tissues\n\nHeart tissues (donors D1–D7 and D11) were processed at Wellcome Sanger Institute (Hinxton, UK) and obtained from deceased transplant organ donors after Research Ethics Committee approval (ref 15/EE/0152, East of England Cambridge South Research Ethics Committee) and informed consent from the donor families. Heart tissues (donors H2–H7) were processed at Harvard Medical School (Boston, Massachusetts, USA) and obtained from deceased organ donors after Human Research Ethics Board approval Pro00011739 (University of Alberta, Edmonton, Canada). Informed consent from donor families was acquired via the institutional Human Organ Procurement and Exchange Program (HOPE). Cardiovascular history was unremarkable for all donors (Supplementary Table 1).\n\nTissue acquisition and processing\n\nTissues were acquired from UK and North American donors (D1–7 and 11, H2–7) after circulatory death (DCD) (D2, D4–D7 and D11) and after brain death (DBD) (D1, D3, H2–H7). For UK DCD donors, after a five-minute stand-off and for DBD, the chest is opened, the aorta is cross-clamped and cardiac samples are acquired. For North American DBD donors, the aorta is cross-clamped, cold cardioplegia (Celsior) is administered under pressure via the aorta to arrest beating, the heart is excised, rinsed in cold saline and samples acquired. All donor samples were full-thickness myocardial biopsies from the left and right atrium, left and right ventricles, interventricular septum and apex, with intentional exclusion of large epicardial fat deposits. Samples used for single nuclei isolation were flash-frozen and stored at −80 °C. Single-cell isolation and CD45+ enrichment was carried out on freshly collected samples. Residual tissue after nuclei and cell isolation procedures was formalin-fixed or frozen in OCT for additional studies.\n\nAll tissues were stored and transported on ice at all times until freezing or tissue dissociation to minimise any transcriptional degradation. Previous studies on the post-mortem tissue stability of the GTEx consortium on bulk tissues68 and in single cells69 suggest only minor changes in tissues within the first 24 h post mortem when stored in cold conditions.\n\nSingle nuclei isolation\n\nSingle nuclei were obtained from flash-frozen tissues using mechanical homogenization as previously described70. Tissues were homogenized using a 7 ml glass Dounce tissue grinder set (Merck) with 8–10 strokes of a loose pestle (A) and 8–10 strokes of a tight pestle (B) in homogenization buffer (250 mM sucrose, 25 mM KCl, 5 mM MgCl2, 10 mM Tris-HCl, 1 mM dithiothreitol (DTT), 1× protease inhibitor, 0.4 U μl−1 RNaseIn, 0.2 U μl−1 SUPERaseIn, 0.1% Triton X-100 in nuclease-free water). Homogenate was filtered through a 40-μm cell strainer (Corning). After centrifugation (500g, 5 min, 4 °C) the supernatant was removed and the pellet was resuspended in storage buffer (1× PBS, 4% bovine serum albumin (BSA), 0.2 U μl−1 Protector RNaseIn). Nuclei were stained with NucBlue Live ReadyProbes Reagents (ThermoFisher) and Hoechst-positive single nuclei were purified by fluorescent activated cell sorting (FACS) using influx, XDP or FACSAria (BD Biosciences) (Supplementary Fig. 1). Nuclei purification and integrity was verified under a microscope, and nuclei were further processed using the Chromium Controller (10X Genomics) according to the manufacturer’s protocol.\n\nSingle-cell preparation\n\nHeart tissues (0.2–0.9 g) were transferred from cardioplegic solution into gentleMACS C-tubes (Miltenyi Biotec) containing enzymatic digestion base solution (100 μg ml−1 liberase TH Research grade and 50 μg ml−1 DNase I, HBSS 10 mM HEPES and 30 mM taurine)71. Tissues were minced using scissors (FST) and automatically digested using gentleMACS Octo Dissociator (Miltenyi Biotec) with heaters. Cardiomyocyte-depleted single-cell suspension were washed with base solution containing 20% fetal bovine serum (FBS) (Gibco), filtered through 70-μm nylon strainer (BD Falcon), collected by centrifugation (330g, 10 min, 4 °C) and resuspended in base solution containing 0.2% FBS (Gibco). Cells were manually counted three times by Trypan blue exclusion after each centrifugation and resuspended at a concentration of at least 2 × 106 ml−1. Single cells were processed using Chromium Controller (10X Genomics) according to the manufacturer’s protocol.\n\nCD45+ cell enrichment\n\nCell suspension was prepared as described above and subsequently labelled using anti-human CD45 monoclonal antibody-conjugated microbeads according to the manufacturer’s protocol (Miltenyi Biotec). In brief, up to 107 cells were incubated for 15 min at 4 °C in 80 μl of PBS, BSA, EDTA buffer (1× PBS pH 7.2, 0.5% BSA, 2 mM EDTA) containing 20 μl CD45 microbeads. Cell suspension was washed in PBS, BSA, EDTA buffer once and collected by centrifugation (330g, 10 min, 4 °C). Resuspended cells were applied to MACS LS columns (Miltenyi Biotec). CD45-depleted cell fraction was discarded after three washes with PBS, BSA and EDTA buffer and the CD45+ cell fraction was collected in PBS, BSA and EDTA buffer by removal of the columns from the magnetic field. CD45+ cells were counted and resuspended in PBS, BSA and EDTA buffer to a concentration of at least 2 × 106 per ml before further processing using a Chromium Controller (10X Genomics) according to the manufacturer’s protocol.\n\nChromium 10X library preparation\n\nSingle cells and nuclei were manually counted by Trypan blue exclusion or automatically using a Countess II (Life Technologies) using at least two separate counts. Cell or nuclei suspension was adjusted to 400–1,000 cells per microlitre and loaded on the Chromium Controller (10X Genomics) with a targeted cell or nuclei recovery of 4,000–10,000 per reaction. 3′ gene expression libraries were prepared according to the manufacturer’s instructions of the v2 or v3 Chromium Single Cell Reagent Kits (10X Genomics). Quality control of cDNA and final libraries was done using Bioanalyzer High Sensitivity DNA Analysis (Agilent) or 4200 TapeStation System (Agilent). Libraries were sequenced using HiSeq 4000 (Illumina) at Wellcome Sanger Institute, and NextSeq 500 (Illumina) at Harvard Medical School with a minimum depth of 20,000–30,000 read pairs per cell or nucleus (Supplementary Table 22).\n\nSpatial validation using smFISH with RNAscope probes\n\nDuring preparation of formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) samples fresh tissue was fixed in neutral-buffered 10% formalin for 18–36 h and subsequently embedded in paraffin blocks. Fixed-frozen tissue samples were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde (ThermoFisher). Sections were cut at 5-μm thickness using a microtome and placed onto SuperFrost Plus slides (VWR). FFPE tissue slides were automatically stained using BOND RX (Leica) and the RNAscope Multiplex Fluorescent Reagent Kit v2 Assay (ACDBio) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Fixed-frozen tissue slides were processed according to the protocol of RNAscope Multiplex Fluorescent Assay v1 (ACDBio). RNAscope ready- or custom-made target probes were run in parallel to multiplex positive and negative controls (Extended Data Fig. 12b, Supplementary Table 23). All nuclei were DAPI-stained. All FFPE tissue slides were imaged using an Opera Phenix High-Content confocal Screening System (Perkin Elmer) with a 1-μm z-step size and 20× water-immersion objective (NA 0.16, 0.299 μm per pixel). Channels: DAPI (excitation 375 nm, emission 435–480 nm), Atto 425 (excitation 425 nm, emission 463–501 nm), opal 520 (excitation 488 nm, emission 500–550 nm), opal 570 (excitation 561 nm, emission 570–630 nm), opal 650 (excitation 640 nm, emission 650–760 nm). Fixed-frozen tissue slides were imaged using a LSM710 confocal microscope (Zeiss) and 40× oil-immersion objective (1.3 oil, DIC III). Channels: DAPI (excitation 375 nm, emission 435–480 nm), Alexa Fluor 488 (excitation 492 nm, emission 517 nm), Atto 550 (excitation 560 nm, emission 575 nm) and Atto 647 (excitation 649 nm, emission 662 nm). Visualization and background removal (rolling ball radius) were done using Fiji/ImageJ72. Pseudocolours were used for better visualization.\n\nHaematoxylin and eosin staining\n\nTissue samples were fresh-frozen in isopentane (ThermoFisher) at −80 °C and embedded in OCT (VWR). Sections were cut at a thickness of 10 μm using a microtome, placed onto SuperFrostPlus slides (VWR) and further processed according to a standard haematoxylin and eosin staining protocol (Extended Data Fig. 12a).\n\nAcquisition of skeletal muscle tissue\n\nIntercostal muscle samples were obtained from between the second and third rib on the left side. This is typically from the deepest layer of muscle (furthest away from the skin). Samples were collected directly into the cold preservation solution.\n\nNuclei isolation for skeletal muscle\n\nMuscle tissue was washed in 1× PBS, cleaned of any visible fat depositions and minced to obtain fragments of approximately 1 mm3. Per sample, approximately 0.3 g of minced tissues was homogenized in 3 ml of buffer A (250 mM sucrose, 10 mg ml−1 BSA, 5 mM MgCl2, 0.12 U μl−1 RNaseIn, 0.06 U μl−1 SUPERasIn, 1× protease inhibitor) using Dounce tissue grinder set (Merck) with 50 strokes of the loose pestle (A). The homogenate was filtered through a 100-μm cell strainer (Corning) and the strainer was washed with 1 ml and then 750 μl of buffer A. After the addition of Triton X-100 (final concentration 0.5%), the mixture was further homogenized with 50 strokes of the tight pestle (B). After filtering through a 40-μm strainer, nuclei were centrifuged (3,000g, 5 min, 4 °C), resuspended in 1 ml of buffer B (320 mM sucrose, 10 mg ml−1 BSA, 3 mM CaCl2, 2 mM magnesium acetate, 0.1 mM EDTA, 10 mM Tris-HCl, 1 mM DTT, 1× protease inhibitor, 0.12 U μl−1 RNaseIn, 0.06 U μl−1 SUPERasin) and purified using a 27% Percoll gradient solution. The Percoll mixture was centrifuged at 20,000g (15 min, 4 °C) and the pellet was resuspended in 200 μl of buffer B, followed by centrifugation (20,000g, 3 min, 4 °C). After Trypan Blue staining, the intact nuclei were counted using a haemocytometer. Nuclei were profiled using a Chromium Controller (10X Genomics) according to the manufacturer’s protocol.\n\nSingle-cell isolation for skeletal muscle\n\nMuscle tissue was washed in 1× PBS, cleaned of any visible fat depositions and finely minced. Then, 2 g of the minced tissue was transferred to digestion buffer 1 (750 U ml−1 collagenase type 2 in 1× PBS) and incubated at 37 °C in a water bath for 90 min. The partially digested tissue was collected by centrifugation (650g, 5 min, 4 °C) and the pellet was resuspended in digestion buffer 2 (100 U ml−1 collagenase type 2, 2 U ml−1 dispase in PBS). After 30 min incubation at 37 °C in a water bath, the digestion was stopped by the addition of 2% FBS. Cells were filtered through a 100-μm and a 40-μm nylon strainer (BD Falcon), collected by centrifugation (650g, 4 °C, 3 min) and washed with 1× PBS, 2% FBS. Subsequently, a 20% Percoll gradient (15,000g, 4 °C, 20 min) was used for cell purification. The layer containing cells was collected, washed in PBS containing 2% FBS, and viable cells were counted by Trypan Blue exclusion using a haemocytometer. Nuclei were profiled using a Chromium Controller (10X Genomics) according to the manufacturer’s protocol.\n\nThe methods key resources table is in Supplementary Table 24.\n\nTranscriptome mapping\n\nAfter sequencing, samples were demultiplexed and stored as CRAM files. Each sample was mapped to the human reference genome (GRCh38 v.3.0.0) provided by 10X Genomics, and using the CellRanger suite (v.3.0.1) with default parameters. Single-cell samples were mapped against the reference as it was provided. Single-nuclei samples, the reference for pre-mRNA, was created using the 10X Genomics instructions (https://support.10xgenomics.com/single-cell-gene-expression/software/pipelines/latest/advanced/references).\n\nCount data processing\n\nAfter mapping, samples from each data source (single nuclei, single cell and CD45+ cell) were grouped into individual AnnData objects by concatenating the raw_feature_bc_matrix_h5.h5 and adding the appropriate metadata information. For each data source object, the mean of unique molecular identifiers (UMIs) (n_counts) was calculated and used as a threshold for empty droplets.\n\nDoublet detection\n\nAfter removal of empty droplets, we applied scrublet73 to assign a doublet score (scrublet_score) to each cell. These cells were clustered and visualized using the UMAP method74. In addition, each cell was processed for doublet detection using a percolation method to allow for improved detection of doublets75.\n\nCell quality control and filtering\n\nEach data source was processed and annotated separately to account for source-specific quality differences. These metrics are included as covariates for further processing. Total cells and CD45+ cells were filtered for counts (500 < n_counts <15,000), genes (200 < n_genes), mitochondrial genes (percent_mito <20%), ribosomal genes (percent_ribo <20%) and scrublet score (scrublet_score <0.3). Single nuclei were filtered for counts (500 < n_counts <15,000), genes (300 < n_genes <6,000), mitochondrial genes (percent_mito <5%), ribosomal genes (percent_ribo <5%) and scrublet score (scrublet_score <0.3). The same filtering thresholds were applied to the skeletal muscle dataset.\n\nScanpy toolkit 1.576 in Python v.3.7 was used to perform downstream analyses, including normalization (normalize_per_cell: counts_per_cell_after = 10,000), log transformation (log1p), variable gene detection (highly_variable_genes), regressing out unwanted sources of variation (regress_out: n_counts and percent_mito), data feature scaling (scale: max_value = 10) and PCA (pca: using highly variable genes) as previously described77.\n\nBatch alignment using deep variational autoencoder\n\nWe built a global manifold by aligning all the data sources and donors in our data. This was done in a three-step procedure: (1) Each source was analysed and annotated separately, aligning only for donors using a pericyte-space linear regression step before batch alignment with bbknn78. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were calculated using a Wilcoxon rank sum test with Bonferroni–Hochberg adjustment as implemented in the Scanpy framework. (2) To annotate each cluster, we used an integrative approach by searching the top significant DEGs (P < 1 × 10−5) with a logFC >1 against the ToppFun79 and EnrichR80 databases. Significant hits on pathways, transcriptional regulation and biological processes were prioritized to annotate a given cluster. Each cellular compartment was labelled under the adata.obs[‘cell_type’] slot after grouping source-specific cell states. (3) All sources were combined into a single AnnData object under the label adata.obs[‘cell_sources’]. Batches were aligned using the batch_correction function from the scGen variational autoencoder81. First we align for adata.obs[‘cell_sources’], using adata.obs[‘cell_type’] as an anchor. Next, we aligned for adata.obs[‘donor’], using adata.obs[‘cell_type’] as an anchor. Each batch alignment round was run for 50 epochs.\n\nManifolds for the adipocytes, vascular and immune cardiac populations, as well as the skeletal muscle analysis, were created using this method and the clustering accuracy was evaluated with SCCAF82 (Extended Data Fig. 12d).\n\nDEGs\n\nTo help with the annotation of the subpopulations of each cell compartment, we calculated the DEGs using the Wilcoxon rank sum test as implemented in the scanpy workflow and recommended by recent benchmarking studies83. A gene was considered to be differentially expressed if it has a log2-transformed fold change > 1 and a P < 1 × 10−5, unless stated otherwise in the analysis section.\n\nCell–cell interactions\n\nExpression matrices of the populations under study were exported from the AnnData, together with a metadata table that contained the cell-barcodes as indices. We then ran CellPhoneDB as follows: cellphonedb method statistical_analysis meta.tsv counts.tsv–counts-data = gene_name–threads = 60. CellPhoneDB raw predictions were filtered by removing those interactions with a P > 1.0 × 10−5. Significant pairs were then submitted for gene set enrichment analysis into ReactomeDB, enrichR and ToppFun for functional classification. The vascular cells were randomly sub-sampled to 39,000 cells before the analysis, and the cardiac repair group (atrial and ventricular cardiomyocytes, FBs, and immune cells) was randomly sub-sampled to 69,295 cells before the analysis.\n\nVisualization of gene expression on 10X Genomics Visium data\n\nWe processed the publicly available left ventricular myocardium Visium data from 10X Genomics (https://support.10xgenomics.com/spatial-gene-expression/datasets/1.0.0/V1_Human_Heart) using the Scanpy v.1.5 workflow adapted for the analysis of 10X Genomics Visium data (https://scanpy-tutorials.readthedocs.io/en/latest/spatial/basic-analysis.html). In brief, spots were removed with less than 500 UMIs or more than 20,000 UMIs, and less than 200 genes. Data were log-transformed and normalized before plotting.\n\nEstimation of RNA velocity\n\nTo calculate the RNA velocity of the single cells and CD45+ enriched single cells, we used the CellRanger output BAM file and the GENCODE v33 GTF (ftp://ftp.ebi.ac.uk/pub/databases/gencode/Gencode_human/release_33/gencode.v33.chr_patch_hapl_scaff.annotation.gtf.gz) file together with the velocyto84 CLI v.0.17.17 to generate a loom file containing the quantification of spliced and unspliced RNA. Next, we built a manifold, cluster the cells and visualize the RNA velocities using scVelo85.\n\nSubpopulation analyses of atrial and ventricular cardiomyocytes, FBs and neuronal cells\n\nAll barcodes labelled in the global object as cardiomyocytes, fibroblasts and neural cells were selected for further subpopulation analyses. Additional cell population-specific filtering criteria were applied to nuclei as follows: cardiomyocyte counts (n_counts <12,500), genes (n_genes <4,000), mitochondrial genes (percent_mito <1%), ribosomal genes (percent_ribo <1%) and scrublet score (scrublet_score <0.25); FB mitochondrial genes (percent_mito <1%), ribosomal genes (percent_ribo <1%); neuronal cell genes (n_genes <4000), mitochondrial genes (percent_mito <1%), ribosomal genes (percent_ribo <1%). Total and CD45+ cells were excluded in the atrial and ventricular cardiomyocytes datasets and did not contribute to subpopulation analysis. No further filtering of FBs or neuronal cell total and CD45+ cells was applied. Cardiomyocytes and FBs were then further split into two groupings based on the region of origin: (1) left and right atrium, and (2) left and right ventricles, apex and interventricular septum.\n\nDonor effects were aligned as described in step (1) above. For FB and neuronal cells, sources were aligned as described in step (3) above. Leiden clustering and UMAP visualization were performed for identifying subpopulations and visualization86. Differentially expressed genes were calculated using the Wilcoxon rank sum test. Genes were ranked by score.\n\nCross-tissue comparison of cardiac immune populations with skeletal muscle, kidney and blood immune populations\n\nWe collected single-cell transcriptome data for adult kidneys from ref. 99 (https://www.kidneycellatlas.org/), and subset all immune cells reported in their study. For the SKM we selected the annotated immune cells from the merged manifold. For the human blood, we used the publicly available 10,000 single PBMC cells dataset provided by 10X Genomics (https://support.10xgenomics.com/single-cell-gene-expression/datasets/3.0.0/pbmc_10k_v3). As previously described87, we trained a logistic regression model on the cardiac immune cells using 80% of the expression data and tested its accuracy on the remaining 20% to produce a model with an accuracy of 0.6862 (Extended Data Fig. 8f, Supplementary Table 16). We then applied this model to predict analogue cardiac immune populations in the adult kidney, SKM and PBMCs. Predictions with a probability less than 0.8 were excluded from downstream comparative analyses.\n\nGene Ontology enrichment analysis\n\nFor the ventricular cardiomyocyte population, we used the R package gProfileR (https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/gProfileR/index.html) with the score-ranked gene list of vCM4 as input and the set of genes expressed in ventricular cardiomyocytes as background (those genes having a UMI count >1). To perform the Gene Ontology analysis on the vascular cells, the top 500 significant DEGs (P < 1 × 10−5) with a log-transformed fold change > 1 were searched against the Gene Ontology biological process database using ToppFun79 (Supplementary Table 25). The top five significantly enriched terms (q < 0.05) for each subpopulation were selected and plotted on a heat map. To perform the pathway analysis on the adipocytes, the top 500 significant DEGs (P < 1 × 10−5) with a log-transformed fold change > 0.5 were searched against ToppFun79 pathway databases (Supplementary Table 26). The top five significantly enriched pathways (q < 0.05) for each subpopulation were selected and plotted on a heat map.\n\nGene set score\n\nWe use the score_genes function as implemented in scanpy to calculate the enrichment of genes involved in the Oncostatin M pathway. A list of genes was collected upon literature research88,89. For gene set enrichment, only highly expressed genes were considered to reduce noise (more than 500 UMIs across all cells). The same analysis was performed for comparison of cardiac immune cells in our study with the observations of previous studies on cardiac-resident macrophages51, mouse tissue-remodelling macrophage45 and yolk sac lineage origin90.\n\nStatistics and reproducibility\n\nAll analyses were performed using R Software, v.3.6.1. Student’s t-tests were used to compare cell type distributions at each site. P < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Linear regression models (correlations) were obtained using the R linear model function (lm), which estimates statistical likelihood (P value) of a linear relationship. Bonferroni correction was applied for multiple testing.\n\nThe depicted RNAscope micrographs in the figures are representative. The micrographs in Figs. 2g, 3c, h and Extended Data Fig. 3c (HAMP), Extended Data Fig. 3e (CNN1), Extended Data Figs. 4g, m, 6f were repeated with similar results in two individual tissue sections. The micrographs in Figs. 2h, 3f and Extended Data Fig. 3c (CNN1), Extended Data Fig. 3e (PCDH7), Extended Data Figs. 6e, h, 9d were repeated with similar results in three individual tissue sections. The micrographs in Figs. 1e, 2d, 3e and Extended Data Figs. 1f, 3c (FHL1) and Extended Data Fig. 6d were repeated with similar results in four individual tissue sections. The micrographs in Fig. 2c and Extended Data Fig. 3c (PRELID2), Extended Data Figs. 10e, 12a were repeated with similar results in six or more individual tissue sections. Positive and negative controls were done once per used samples.\n\nGWAS enrichment analysis\n\nWe downloaded GWAS summary statistics from broad cvdi, EBI GWAS catalogue and GWAS atlas. We selected traits with well-powered GWAS (n > 5,000 and number of significant loci >10). GWAS datasets are summarized in Supplementary Table 27. Gene expression data of protein-coding genes were mapped onto Entrez gene ids and these gene annotations were used on the human genome assembly hg19/37. We only used gene expression data from nuclei. We implemented the analysis previously described64 in python and in R. The log-transformed counts (plus one pseudocount) were used to compute average cell type-specific expression profiles. We performed individual magma analyses for each cell type, always conditioning on default gene level covariates (for example, gene length) and average gene expression across all cells. Subsequently, we applied the Benjamini–Hochberg method and selected cell type trait associations with FDR < 10%. These pairs were then subjected to conditional analysis as previously described64 to define ‘independent’, ‘jointly explained’ and ‘partially jointly explained’ pairs of associations (Supplementary Table 28).\n\nDistributions of dispersed cells and isolated nuclei\n\nThe different procedures for obtaining isolated nuclei and dispersed cells resulted in significantly different distributions of cell types (Supplementary Table 29, Extended Data Fig. 2). Notably, 30.1% and 49.2% of isolated nuclei were derived from atrial and ventricular cardiomyocytes in the atrial and ventricular regions, whereas these cells were mostly excluded from preparations of isolated and CD45-selected cells (Supplementary Table 2).\n\nExcluding cardiomyocytes, the distribution of cell types identified from isolated nuclei and dispersed cells remained distinct (Supplementary Table 30). Although 59.0% of dispersed cells were ECs, only 15.7% of nuclei were derived from ECs. By contrast, 64.2% of nuclei were from FBs (31.2%) and pericytes (33.0%), whereas only 17.1% of dispersed cells were FBs (2.3%) and pericytes (14.8%). These differences may reflect sensitivity of EC nuclei to isolation procedures or resistance of pericytes and FBs to cellular enzymatic digestion.\n\nDespite differences in cell distributions between isolated nuclei and dispersed cells, the gene expression profiles of cell lineages were reasonably correlated (r > 0.4 for each cell type). To address the concordance of the genes captured by cells and nuclei, we compared the expression of the major cell type markers from Fig. 1c across the three sources (Extended Data Fig. 1c). As nuclei lack cytoplasmic RNA, the expression of certain genes, especially immune genes NKG7 and C1QA, was lower in nuclei than in cells. Nevertheless, the general trend with respect to marker genes was consistent across the three sources, and the same genes distinguished individual cell types independent of the source.\n\nFurther analysis of vascular cells\n\nThe PC3_str contained similar contribution of cells and nuclei, and had a scrublet score below the stringent threshold used; nevertheless, the average number of genes and counts in this cluster was higher than average. Thus, despite our stringent quality filtering, we cannot exclude the possibility that there might be doublets in this cluster. EC10_CMC-like and PC4_CMC-like co-express EC or pericyte genes with cardiomyocyte markers and further studies are required to understand whether they represent previously unknown cell states or doublets.\n\nThe observations of the arterial and venous SMC are supported by previous studies, which predict that arterial SMCs are more contractile, and venous SMCs are less differentiated91.\n\nEC3_cap enrich for transcripts encoding components of AP1 (JUN and FOS), which mediates multiple EC fate decisions including response to VEGF, inflammatory and stress signals, and ATF3, an adaptive-response gene induced by diverse signals92,93,94.\n\nSkeletal muscle characterization\n\nWe collected intercostal skeletal muscle samples from five healthy individuals, including one donor with matched cardiac tissue, and profiled the transcriptome of 35,665 single cells and 39,597 single nuclei. Analogous to the heart, the combination of cells and nuclei allowed us to capture and resolve major cell lineages, including cardiomyocyte, fibroblasts, endothelial cells, smooth muscle cells, pericytes, myeloid and lymphoid immune cells and satellite cells (Extended Data Fig. 11a, b, Supplementary Table 31).\n\nFurther analysis of the vascular cells of the skeletal muscle identified ten distinct populations. The endothelial cells showed five clusters separated based on their respective vascular beds with signatures similar to the ones we observe in the heart. The EC_cap expresses VWF and RGCC. Venous EC_ven express ACKR1 and PLVAP, whereas arterial EC_art show SEMA3G and HEY1, in line with our heart data (Extended Data Fig. 11c, d, Supplementary Table 32).\n\nThe overall distributions of vascular and stromal cell populations in skeletal and cardiac muscle were similar, including the arterial and venous features of ECs; however; skeletal muscle contained a single SMC cluster, potentially related to the smaller size of the dataset. In skeletal muscle, the predicted cell–cell interactions of the EC_art and SMCs included NOTCH1/4–JAG1 as well as JAG1/JAG2/DLL4–NOTCH3, but not JAG1/JAG2/DLL4–NOTCH2, inferred in the heart (Extended Data Fig. 11e, f, Supplementary Table 33).\n\nCardiac immune cells\n\nUsing the logistic regression model, we did not identify any counterpart of the cardiac IL17RA+ monocytes in SKM or kidney, possibly owing to the small size of this population.\n\nNaive T cells (CD4+T_naive) identified expressed CCR7 and SELL, indicative of their naive and tissue-resident nature95. Memory T cells (CD8+T_tem) expressed BACH2, STAT4 and IL7R, associated with long-term immune memory96,97. We further characterized the lymphoid cells using scNym98, and trained it using published data99,100. The resulting model was applied to our cardiac immune cells and those cells, with a predicted score higher than 0.8 were presumed to be likely candidates for re-annotation. Using this approach, we identified candidates for plasma B cells (109), dendritic cells (645), innate lymphoid cells (89), MAIT T cells (219), T helper cells (80) T regulatory cells (11), T central memory cells (103), γδ T cells (30) and plasmocytoid dendritic cells (27). These annotations can be found in the cardiac immune object annotations under the label ‘scNym’ at www.heartcellatlas.org.\n\nReporting summary"
