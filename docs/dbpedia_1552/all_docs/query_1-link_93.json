        "text": "Description: Each research island field station on the Maine coast has at least one Research Assistant (RA) working on the island at any one time. At each island, a cabin or wall tent serves as the base of field operations, and staff sleep in their own tents. All staff participate in seabird research and camp maintenance duties.\n\nResponsibilities: Participation in all aspects of seabird research, monitoring, management, and camp life, including: collecting data following work plans and daily assignments made by the island supervisors, banding and resighting birds using binoculars and spotting scopes, monitoring productivity and growth, conducting population counts, conducting feeding studies, entering data into computer databases, educating the public, participating in predator management, maintaining buildings and equipment, and shopping for supplies when on the mainland.\n\nSeason: Most positions begin on May 26 and end on August 15. Two or more RAs are needed as early as May 1.\n\nQualifications: Applicants should have a B.S. (or be an upper level undergraduate) in biology, conservation biology, wildlife management, or a related field, and have at least one full season of previous field experience. Plans to pursue graduate studies and a career in conservation biology are desirable. RAs must be in excellent physical condition (capable of climbing over rugged terrain and able to lift approximately 50 lbs.), have wilderness camping experience, be able to work independently and as part of a team, be capable of working long hours outdoors in variable weather conditions, and be able to work well with people of diverse backgrounds. Must be able to sit in a small blind for three hours and maintain focus on data collection. A sense of humor, willingness to learn, dedication to wildlife conservation, and interest in seabirds and isolated islands are basic requirements. Must provide own binoculars, tent, sleeping pad, and sleeping bag.\n\nCompensation: Biweekly stipend, plus room, board, worker's compensation insurance coverage, and transportation from the mainland base to and from the research sites.\n\nAvailable positions: Approximately eleven, depending on funding."
