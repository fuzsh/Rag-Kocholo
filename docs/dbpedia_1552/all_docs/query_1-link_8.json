        "text": "“Assume that I can, so maybe I will!” It was so heartening to see this amazing piece go viral this week. As the older brother of a young man with Down syndrome, I was thrilled to see the internet come to realize what I’ve always known about people with Downs — they’re not just capable, they’re kick-ass! In particular, it was really exciting to see this video touch on one of my core focuses as a filmmaker: people with disabilities living independently. My latest project, MIDDLEGROUND, dives deeply into this topic — it follows my brother, Griffin Herz, and his colleagues on one step of their journey toward independence. We’re currently in the process of fundraising for post-production — please consider taking a look at the project and donating if you feel comfortable. Our goal is to continue to spread the message of disability strength and resiliency, and to show that Down syndrome is more than meets the eye. https://lnkd.in/gZht4jvW As Madison Tevlin says, “Assume that I can, so maybe I will.”"
