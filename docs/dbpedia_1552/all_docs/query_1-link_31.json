        "text": "Can music become too famous? If that is the case anywhere in Bach’s two hundred cantatas, then it probably applies to the gently rocking chorale Wohl mir, daß ich Jesum habe, from the cantata Herz und Mund und Tat und Leben. Already in 1909, it featured separately from the rest of the cantata, with the English words Jesu, joy of man’s desiring, as the set number for a music competition in England. It was soon to be found everywhere – in its original form, but more often as a piece for organ or piano. The cantata itself thus gradually disappeared from view.\n\nBach’s famous chorale was first heard when the cantata was performed in Leipzig, on 2 July 1723, for the Feast of the Visitation. It was during Bach’s first months as cantor and he reused music that he had to hand, as he often did. Bach had already written most of BWV 147 in 1716, as an advent cantata for the court chapel in Weimar, but it was only in Leipzig that he added the recitatives with instrumental accompaniment and the well-known chorale. So Bach turned a concise cantata (opening chorus, four arias and probably a simple closing chorale) into a big two-part cantata.\n\nBut if the fame of that chorale should overshadow the rest too much, just try it without for once. The recipe for the earliest version of the cantata from 1716 is: remove the recitatives, remove the two chorale harmonisations, swap over the soprano and tenor arias, think up different words for the bass aria (‘Lass mich der Rufer stimme hören’) and close with the sixth strophe of the chorale Ich dank dir, lieber Herre (e.g. BWV 347 or 348). Let the result sink in, repeat it a couple of times, and then the expanded version of the cantata will sound like new.\n\n1. Chorus\n\nHeart and mouth and deed and life\n\nMust bear witness of Christ,\n\nWithout fear and hypocrisy,\n\nThat he is God and savior.\n\n2. Recitative (Tenor)\n\nBlessed [Mary’s] mouth!\n\nMary [the mother of Jesus] makes her innermost soul\n\nKnown by thanks and glorifying.\n\nShe begins with [those miracles wrought upon] herself,\n\nTo tell of the savior’s wonders,\n\nWhat [great things] he has done to her\n\nas his maidservant.\n\nO human race,\n\nServant of Satan and of sin,\n\nYou are freed\n\nBy Christ’s consoling advent\n\nFrom this burden and servitude.\n\nYet your mouth and your stubborn disposition\n\nKeeps quiet, denies such goodness;\n\nBut know that in accordance with scripture\n\nYou will meet an all too harsh judgment.\n\n3. Aria (Alto)\n\nDo not be ashamed, o soul,\n\nTo profess your savior [now],\n\nIf he is to call you his own\n\nBefore [God] the father’s countenance [at the end time]. But whoever is unafraid\n\nTo deny him on this earth\n\nWill be denied by him\n\nWhen he [the savior] comes in glory [at the end time].\n\n4. Recitative (Bass)\n\nStubbornness can blind the powerful\n\nUntil the arm of the Most High casts them from their throne; But in contrast this arm,\n\nThough the earthly globe trembles before it,\n\nLifts up the miserable/exiled,\n\nWhom it [God’s arm] redeems.\n\nOh highly fortunate Christians,\n\nUp, make yourselves ready;\n\nNow is the acceptable time;\n\nNow is the day of salvation:\n\nThe savior bids you equip body and spirit\n\nWith gifts of faith;\n\nUp, call to him in ardent desire,\n\nTo receive him in faith.\n\n5. Aria (Soprano)\n\nPrepare the highway for you [into my heart], Jesus, even now; My savior, choose [for salvation]\n\nMy believing soul\n\nAnd look upon me with eyes of grace.\n\n6. Chorale\n\n[It is] well with me that I have Jesus;\n\nOh, how fast I hold him,\n\nThat he might refresh my heart\n\nWhen I am ill and sad.\n\nI have Jesus, who loves me\n\nAnd gives himself to me, to be my own;\n\nAh, thus I will not let Jesus go,\n\nEven if my heart breaks.\n\n7. Aria (Tenor)\n\nHelp, Jesus, help that I too may profess you\n\nIn weal and woe, in joy and sorrow;\n\nThat I may call you my savior\n\nIn faith and resignation [to your will],\n\nThat my heart may ever burn with your love.\n\nHelp, Jesus!\n\n8. Recitative (Alto)\n\nThe wonder-working hand of the Most High’s omnipotence acts in [the womb,] the hidden place of the [“mother,”] earth. John has to be filled with [the Holy] Spirit: The bond of [Christian] love clothes him already in his mother’s [Elizabeth’s] womb,\n\nSo that he knows the savior,\n\nEven though he [John] does not yet\n\ncall him [Jesus, by name] with his mouth;\n\nHe [John] is stirred, he skips and jumps\n\nAs Elizabeth proclaims the wonderwork,\n\nAs Mary’s mouth brings the offering of [praise from] the lips. When you, O believers,\n\ntake note of flesh’s weakness,\n\nWhen your heart burns in love,\n\nAnd yet the mouth does not profess the savior,\n\nGod is the one who powerfully strengthens you;\n\nHe wants to stir up in you the power of the [person’s] spirit, yes, put thanks and praise on your tongue.\n\n9. Aria (Bass)\n\nI want to sing of Jesus’ wonders,\n\nAnd bring him the offering of [praise from] the lips;\n\nIn accordance with the covenant of his love, he will powerfully conquer weak flesh, the earthly mouth\n\nBy [baptism of] holy fire.\n\n10. Chorale\n\nJesus remains my joy,\n\nThe consolation and sap/blood of my heart;\n\nJesus bars all sorrow;\n\nHe is the [protecting] power of my life,\n\nThe desire and sun of my eyes,\n\nThe treasure and bliss of my soul;\n\nThus I will not let Jesus\n\nOut of heart and sight.\n\ntransl. © Daniel R.
