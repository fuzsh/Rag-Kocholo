        "text": "for D.B.F.\n\nThe white and blue folds of her sweater.\n\nThe hand of her daughter on her shoulder.\n\nThe rain.\n\nThe cancer blossoming in her brain.\n\nThe story of when she did dishes for the dying woman.\n\nThis dying woman in the home she just built.\n\nThe glasses lifted high for a champagne toast.\n\nThe medicine waiting for tomorrow.\n\nThe snapdragons on the table not yet starting to droop.\n\nThe song we have sung with her for thirty years.\n\nThe tears.\n\nThe missing harmony where her voice would be.\n\nThe smile on her face as if nothing was missing.\n\nAs if nothing was lacking.\n\nAs if she was opening the gate\n\nand showing us this, this is the way to walk through.\n\nLike this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nBowing at the Feet of the Ordinary\n\nMay I remember this day\n\nwith its two-hundred twenty two\n\nmiles of pavement and my\n\ndaughter beside me and both\n\nof us singing her favorite songs.\n\nRemember this day not because\n\nit was special but because\n\nit was the way it always is,\n\nwith us laughing and talking\n\nand sitting in easy silence.\n\nWith a stop at the car wash\n\nand her grumbling about vacuuming,\n\nthen doing it anyway. With\n\na stop at the coffee shop\n\nand me grumbling about\n\ncake pops, then buying one\n\nanyway. With the sweetness\n\nof ripe Cresthaven peaches\n\nwe bought at the roadside stand—\n\nhow the juice dripped down our chins.\n\nWith the rich green of late summer\n\na blur out the window. The day\n\nso infused with commonplace\n\nlove I never once doubted\n\nI belonged with my girl, in that car,\n\nin the world, in the universe,\n\nthe days getting shorter\n\nbut still so luminous, so warm.\n\nLike this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nlistening to Trio Duende play Allegro con Brio, from Piano Trio 1 in B Major\n\nOnce, on a rainy night, I sat in the home\n\nof a family I did not know and listened\n\nto a trio playing Brahms. Though\n\nit is only hours later, I unwrap\n\nthe memory as if it is tied with silk ribbons\n\nand wrapped in gold tissue—something\n\nprecious as a time-smoothed stone\n\non the banks of a slender river. Unlike\n\na museum piece, this memory wants\n\nto be opened, to be held, to be touched,\n\nto be cradled by bare hands. Wants\n\nmy finger prints all over it—\n\nthe memory of how beauty swells in us\n\nand then breaks us, breaks us\n\nthe way the piano itself broke apart tonight—\n\nthe pedal rods clattering to the ground\n\nmid-movement. Beauty bids us play on\n\nas the pianist did tonight. Play on.\n\nThough broken. Though we know\n\nthe work eventually ends in a minor key.\n\nPlay on, as if we trust the line of beauty\n\nwill not be broken. No matter how intense\n\nit gets. Even if the world explodes.\n\nLike this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nafter “Pleasure” by Rick Barot\n\nIt was a garden, they said,\n\nwith an apple tree and one\n\nman and one woman,\n\nalways blissful.\n\nAnd while I don’t doubt\n\nthis, too, is paradise,\n\nI know well the paradise\n\nwhen one woman is alone\n\nin the garden pulling up\n\nbindweed by the roots,\n\nknowing she’ll never get it all.\n\nAnd somehow there is pleasure\n\nin the endless pulling.\n\nI know the paradise\n\nwhen fifty-thousand people\n\nsing together a song\n\nabout heartbreak.\n\nAnd the paradise of a lover’s\n\narms when I’m weeping\n\nis somehow even more paradisical\n\nthan when the world feels easy.\n\nI’m not saying I want\n\nthings to go wrong.\n\nI, too, pray for peace.\n\nBut I know now that pain\n\ndoes not preclude paradise.\n\nThe bruised apple\n\nmakes a sweet sauce.\n\nThe arm that aches\n\nstill holds the beloved child.\n\nAnd after a fire,\n\nthe world grows back\n\nwith such startling green.\n\nLike this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nfor V, L, C and M\n\nThey know they are beautiful.\n\nThe way late-summer snapdragons\n\nknow they are beautiful, whether\n\nthey’re budded or blossoming\n\nor making new seed. The way\n\nthe sky knows it’s beautiful whether\n\nit’s wearing the pink silks of dawn,\n\nthe deep blue shift of midday or\n\nthe soft black drapes of night.\n\nThey walk down the street and\n\na wake of laughter follows them.\n\nEven their shadows, joined\n\nby the hip, are beautiful.\n\nEverywhere they go, the world\n\nseems to open. They are not beautiful\n\nthe way cruelty is sometimes beautiful—\n\nshiny, powerful, seductive.\n\nThey are beautiful the way only\n\nlove is beautiful—as if there is\n\na golden thread that connects them\n\nto each other, to everything they touch.\n\nLike this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nCount the cash. Make stacks of cash.\n\nTall, teetering towers of cash.\n\nWatch them crash. Build them again.\n\nWhole green cities of cash.\n\nThis was what you dreamed of, yes?\n\nWish you had a sandwich. Maybe\n\na glass of wine. Heck, how about\n\na glass of water? Tap water’s fine.\n\nNotice your stomach grumbling.\n\nThink about eating a dollar.\n\nDecide you’re not that hungry yet.\n\nMake the bills into fans.\n\nFan yourself like the queen of cash.\n\nWish someone else were here\n\nto join this dream. Is this a dream?\n\nPlease let this be a dream.\n\nWish you could use all this cash\n\nto buy something. Like a sandwich.\n\nLike a ticket to Hamilton. Like a key\n\nto get you out of this vault.\n\nLike a glass of tap water.\n\nLike a window to see the sky.\n\nWhy did you ever think you’d trade\n\nwhat you had for all this cash?\n\nWhat you wouldn’t give now\n\njust to lie in summer grass.\n\nAnd eat a peanut butter sandwich.\n\nAnd stare at the sky as it changes colors.\n\nThat genie was right.\n\nBe careful what you wish for.\n\n*\n\nThis poem was inspired by Things to Do in the Belly of the Whale by Dan Albergotti. It’s a lot of fun … just imagine yourself trapped in an unlikely place and give yourself a list of things to do …\n\nLike this:\n\nLike Loading..."
