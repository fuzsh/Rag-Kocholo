3 Doors Down was formed in Escatawpa, Mississippi, (a small town of 400 people) by school friends Brad (vocals and drums), Matt (guitar), and Todd (bass). The band played songs by Metallica, Bush, and similar bands at parties and clubs, adding their own original music. While on a road trip in Alabama the three musicians came out of a building and noticed the sign said Doors Down, which combined with there being three members in the band, was the origin of the name 3 Doors Down.

After two years, the band invited Chris, a member of Todds earlier band, to fill out their sound by addting a second guitar. The band recorded their own album in 1998. Radio station WCPR in Biloxi, Mississippi, started playing the song Kryptonite, leading to a showcase at New York Citys CBGBs and a record contract with Republic/Universal.

After the release of the first album, Better Life, and the number one single Kryptonite, the band added session drummer Richard to join the band so that Brad could concentrate on lead vocals.
