        "text": "I think 3 Doors Down is on the RRHOF track.Best music I've heard in the last 10 yrs or so.These guys craft great hits like Kryptonite,Here Without You,etc. Not really innovative but its solid.\n\nThese guys write good lyrical stuff support their HOF. KG\n\nPosted by KING on Thursday, 02/13/2014 @ 15:46pm\n\nSaw 3 Doors Down about a year ago. Excellent show. Don't think they are Hall worthy (unless they release about 3 more killer albums), but I like their sound.\n\nPosted by Paul in KY on Friday, 02/14/2014 @ 09:20am\n\nIf anyone from this group deserves to get in, its 3 Doors Down. They are a huge stand out from the money-motivated bands and artists of today's music industry. Their music not only sounds better but actually has meaning and quality to it. By far the best band since 2000, no one else comes close to these guys.\n\nPosted by Tim on Saturday, 07/12/2014 @ 23:35pm\n\nSaw them headline Fair St. Louis during the holiday weekend. I first saw 3DD open for Aerosmith back in 2009. I'm not really sure how to explain their music, but I would have to disagree with the person who said they are 'post-grunge'. I'd say they are up there with Nickelback as far as corporate rock.\n\nTheir music is okay, never really gotten into it, and their show wasn't memorable. But they still have their fans, and the lead singer even said he loves it when people post pics and videos of their live shows on social media. He admits that the band members search for them during downtime under the hashtag #3doorsdown. If this is true, then awesome.\n\nI don't know how HOF-worthy they are, so we shall see....\n\nPosted by Jason Voigt on Wednesday, 07/5/2017 @ 14:25pm\n\nI don't see this happening at all but one thing I find 3DD to be interesting is they're one of those bands who fed into the small town America ethos like Journey, Boston, and REO Speedwagon. Not only they seemed to be the only modern band to do it the most, but also weren't afraid to go on that kind of approach back in the 2000's when most bands - and even some of their peers - either care more about how heavy they could be musically or making critics happy.\n\nPosted by The Dude on Sunday, 07/22/2018 @ 22:08pm"
