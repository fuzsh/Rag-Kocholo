        "text": "Hollywood would reject the script. Too improbable.\n\nJudge for yourself.\n\nBrad Arnold of Escatawpa, a Gulf Coast town of 3,902, wrote a song in math class at East Central High School, near Moss Point, in the mid-1990s. He tapped the rhythm he heard in his head with a pencil on his desk, and the words came swiftly. He jotted them in a notebook and stashed it away.\n\nHe already was in a band with friends called 3 Doors Down. Arnold played the drums and was lead singer. Arnold had played T-ball with Matt Roberts, who became lead guitarist. Todd Harrell, the most experienced musician of the bunch, had dated Arnold’s sister. He joined as the bass player.\n\nEventually, Chris Henderson became the rhythm guitarist. Henderson played center on the Moss Point High football team in the late 1980s with Harrell, who was a tight end.\n\nThey decided to rent a small studio and record the song Arnold had written while at school. They took a copy to a local radio station, WCPR in Biloxi. As soon as the station began playing it on air, listeners started calling and requesting it. It became one of the top songs on the station’s regular playlist. Executives at Republic Records noticed and wanted to hear more of the band’s songs. The label and the band struck a deal.\n\nThe song — “Kryptonite” — went to No. 3 on the Billboard chart and was the most-played song on the radio in 2000. The band’s debut album was released that year, and three other songs went to No. 1. Arnold was named BMI Songwriter of the Year — an incredible honor in the music world.\n\nRepublic sent them on a 19-month, 367-show tour. As soon as they returned home, the label wanted a follow-up album. Arnold wrote a lot of the material while on tour, focusing on loneliness and missing loved ones, especially his wife of two years, Terika.\n\nThe first song off the album — “When I’m Gone” — went to No. 1 and earned the band two Grammy nominations. Republic sent them on another world tour. Terika accompanied Arnold on tour this time. “I’m at home wherever Terika is,” he said during a phone interview with me.\n\nThese were country boys who were playing in places like Denmark and Holland, and fans were singing their songs back to them.\n\nPressure mounted while on the road. Arnold told me in February 2003, “I started having anxiety deals before we went on stage. I know these songs. I wrote the words to them. I’ve sung them a thousand times. But I started doubting myself.\n\n“So I was talking to my mom about it one day, and she said, ‘Just say a little prayer before you go on stage.' I said, ‘Mama, I feel a little funny asking God to help me with a rock song.’ She said, God don’t care what kind of music you’re playing. He’ll help you.’ And sure as the world, it has … I don’t want to sound like I’m giving a sermon but God has given me all this, and it’s up to me to be responsible with it now.”\n\nWorld famous\n\nCash was flowing in. Arnold bought his dad, Ralph, the first new truck he ever owned.\n\nAnd 3 Doors Down had been in high demand for a couple of years. When the Pittsburgh Steelers celebrated the 1,000th football game in their storied history in 2002, they asked Arnold to sing the national anthem.\n\nAlso in 2002, 3 Doors Down played a two-week tour for U.S. soldiers in the Mediterranean.\n\n“We played on a stage literally 200 yards from the Persian Gulf,” Arnold said in a phone conversation in 2003. “All these soldiers were coming up after the show and saying, ‘Thanks for coming.’ And we were like, ‘No, man, thank you.’ Those are the people who are taken for granted.”\n\nHenderson was in the Navy during the first Gulf War, in 1991. When the band became known as pro-military, they wore it like a badge of honor.\n\n“All I know is, if it wasn’t for the military I wouldn’t have the freedom to wake up, put the key in my car and drive to Wal-Mart with my daughter and buy whatever the hell I want to,” he said in an interview with me in 2003. “People just don’t get it.”\n\nSo they were world famous. Selling records as fast as they could record them. Playing to sellout crowds everywhere, including the Mississippi Coliseum. Arnold was married and in love.\n\nThey had it all and the future seemed certain to hold more hits, more money, more “gee whiz” moments.\n\nRocky road\n\nLet’s make this clear: 3 Doors Down remains an incredibly talented and popular rock band. And immense credit goes to Arnold and Henderson for being the rock steady cogs of the machine.\n\nIt’s a good thing they are.\n\nArnold went through a painful divorce. (He has since married again.)\n\nIn 2012, Roberts left the group because of pain in his wrist caused by carpel tunnel. He also battled severe stage fright. No matter how many shows they played, he never felt at home in front of an audience.\n\nAnd it is a tough thing when a band loses its lead guitarist, because his fingers have helped created its unique sound.\n\nThen in 2013, Harrell struck a pickup while driving a reported 101 miles per hour in Nashville. The man in the pickup died. Tests revealed Harrell was under the influence of painkillers and anxiety medicine at the time of the accident. While under house arrest awaiting trial in 2015, Harrell was again arrested on a DUI charge. He entered a no-contest plea. He was sentenced in Nashville to two years in prison and is now serving the first year.\n\nAnd then Sunday, Roberts, 38, was found dead in the hallway of a Wisconsin hotel. He was there to perform a benefit for a nonprofit that serves veterans. Toxicology reports are not complete, but Roberts had battled addiction to pain medication for years.\n\nServices for Roberts are scheduled for 3 p.m. Friday in Moss Point.\n\nMeanwhile, 3 Doors Down is doing what it must do — carrying on the business of playing scheduled shows for their fans, many of whom purchased tickets in advance. In Indianapolis a few nights ago, they paid tribute to their friend by playing a song Arnold said Roberts “always enjoyed.” It was called “The Road I’m On.”\n\nLord knows, it’s been a rocky one for 3 Doors Down."
