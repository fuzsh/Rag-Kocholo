        "text": "3 Doors Down has announced an “Away From The Sun” anniversary tour that will bring it to fans at two Alabama venues this summer.\n\nThe band dropped a short, tongue-in-cheek video Monday morning to set the stage. In it, the unexpected appearance of 3DD front man Brad Arnold interrupts a fan’s rendition of “Here Without You.”\n\nThe tour also will feature rock band Candlebox. As the tour’s name suggests, it will feature 3 Doors Down playing all the songs from its sophomore album “Away From the Sun,” released in November 2002, and other hits. The band says the dates form “what is slated to be the band’s last US tour to promote the 30th anniversary of the band and their final farewell studio album being released later this year by Round Hill Records.”\n\nThe tour hits the Tuscaloosa Amphitheater on Saturday, Aug. 5 and The Wharf Amphitheater in Orange Beach on Wednesday, Aug. 16. Tickets for both go on sale at 10 a.m. Friday, March 24, through Ticketmaster. Prices for the Tuscaloosa show range from $39.50 to $99.50, and Wharf prices range from $29.50 to $99.50. Additional fees apply.\n\n3 Doors Down formed in Escatawpa, Miss., in the ‘90s and scored its big break with the single “Kryptonite.” It capitalized with the 2000 studio album “The Better Life, the first in a string of five albums to make the Billboard Top 10."
