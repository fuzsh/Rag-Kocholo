        "text": "We think about a 3 Doors Down tour and we dream about it all the time.\n\nStarting June 14 and stretching all the way to Sept. 23, the dream will become a reality when the alt-rockers launch their ‘Away From The Sun Anniversary Tour’ celebrating their sophomore album released in late 2002.\n\n“’Away From the Sun’ has always been a personal favorite of mine because of how much it resonated with our country’s service members,” 3 Doors Down’s Brad Arnold told Loudwire.\n\n“The show we’re planning will be next level.”\n\nFor fans in the northeast, be sure to circle Wednesday, June 28 on your calendars too — that’s when the band will drop into Holmdel, NJ’s PNC Bank Arts Center.\n\nAnd if waiting for tickets is your “Kryptonite,” we’re here to save the day.\n\nAlthough inventory isn’t available on Ticketmaster until Friday, March 21, fans who want to ensure they have tickets ahead of time can purchase on sites like Vivid Seats before tickets are officially on sale.\n\nVivid Seats is a secondary market ticketing platform, and prices may be higher or lower than face value, depending on demand.\n\nThey have a 100% buyer guarantee that states your transaction will be safe and secure and will be delivered before the event.\n\nThey’ll be joined by grunge rockers Candlebox on all dates.\n\n3 Doors Down tour schedule\n\nA complete calendar including tour dates, venues and links to buy tickets can be found below.\n\n3 Doors Down special guest\n\nAt all shows, Candlebox will open for Brad Arnold and co.\n\nThe group, originally from Seattle, is known for their heavy ballads like “Far Behind,” “You” and “Cover Me.”\n\nFans that haven’t caught up with the group in a while may want to look into their 2021 album “Wolves.”\n\nOver the course of 11 tracks, the band rocks hard, shreds guitar solos and even has a few moments of earnest introspection.\n\nYou can listen to “Wolves” here.\n\n3 Doors Down set list\n\nAlthough it appears that 3 Doors Down tinkers with what they play at concerts, here’s a likely sample of what fans can expect to hear when they seem them live based on recent set lists.\n\n01.) “Duck and Run”\n\n02.) “It’s Not My Time”\n\n03.) “Sarah Yellin'”\n\n04.) “Loser”\n\n05.) “Going Down in Flames”\n\n06.) “Away From the Sun\n\n07.) “Life of My Own”\n\n08.) “Ticket to Heaven”\n\n09.) “Be Like That”\n\n10.) “Better Life”\n\n11.) “Landing in London”\n\n12.) “Changes”\n\n13.) “Kryptonite”\n\nEncore:\n\n14.) “Here Without You”\n\n15.) “When I’m Gone”\n\nThe above set list is courtesy of Set List FM.\n\n3 Doors Down band members\n\nWay back in 1996 Escatawpa, Mississippi, 3 Doors Down formed and soon found success with their massive 2000 single “Kryptonite.”\n\nIn the years since, there’s been a bit of turnover in the group but here’s who should be on the road with the band when the summer tour launches.\n\nBrad Arnold – lead vocals (1996–present)\n\nChris Henderson – rhythm and lead guitar, backing vocals (1998–present)\n\nGreg Upchurch – drums (2005–present)\n\nChet Roberts – lead and rhythm guitar, backing vocals (2012–present)\n\nJustin Biltonen – bass (2013–present)\n\nRockers on tour in 2023\n\nYou may want to stock up on earplugs.\n\nThat’s because many of the hardest rockers around are on the road this year and you’ll need to see them all.\n\nHere are just five of our favorites you won’t want to miss.\n\n• Guns N’ Roses\n\n• Metallica\n\n• Blink 182\n\n• Nickelback\n\n• Breaking Benjamin"
