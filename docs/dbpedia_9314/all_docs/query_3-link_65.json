        "text": "Throughout their time, the band has reconfigured its members drastically. 3 Doors Down originally consisted of Brad Arnold on vocals and drums, Todd Harrell on bass (later replaced by Justin Biltonen) and Matt Roberts on guitar (later replaced by Chet Roberts). They were later joined by guitarist Chris Henderson, and then by drummer Richard Liles, who played for the band during their tour of their first album. From 2002–2005, Daniel Adair replaced him on drums. In turn, he was later replaced by Greg Upchurch. Together, they have played over 1000 shows worldwide and were signed to Universal Records in 2000.\n\nThe band have enjoyed international fame since their formation. They have played with artists such as Nickelback, Daughtry and Megadeth, sharing the stage with these big names. Their album sales to date are roughly 20 million worldwide. Their debut album, ‘The Better Life’ garnered a large fan response, selling an impressive six million copies, and led to a number of hits for the band. 3 Doors Down are best known for producing the smash hit, ‘Here Without You’ as well as hits ‘Let Me Go’, ‘Kryptonite’, which was really responsible for the band achieving international fame, and ‘When I’m Gone’.\n\nArtists that have been compared to the band include Nickelback, Lighthouse and 12 Stones. Many of their songs are considered rock classics for their authentic rock feel.\n\n3 Doors Down are also notable for their generous charity work: they started The Better Life Foundation (TBLF) in 2003, hoping to give as many children as possible a better life. Since its formation, TBLF has supported numerous charities nationwide, as well as providing aid and assistance to the Gulf Coast region of Mississippi (their home state) after it was hit by the catastrophic hurricane Katrina."
