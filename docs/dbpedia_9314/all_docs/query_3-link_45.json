        "text": "3 Doors Down\n\nStyle: alternative rock\n\nmembers\n\nlead vocals: Brad Arnold (born 27 September 1978)\n\nguitar: Matt Roberts (born 10 January 1978)\n\nbass: Todd Harrell (born 13 February 1972)\n\nguitar: Chris Henderson (born 30 April 1971)\n\ndrums: Richard Liles (born 25 February 1973)\n\n3 Doors Down was formed in Escatawpa, Mississippi, (a small town of 400 people) by school friends Brad (vocals and drums), Matt (guitar), and Todd (bass). The band played songs by Metallica, Bush, and similar bands at parties and clubs, adding their own original music. While on a road trip in Alabama the three musicians came out of a building and noticed the sign said Doors Down, which combined with there being three members in the band, was the origin of the name 3 Doors Down.\n\nAfter two years, the band invited Chris, a member of Todds earlier band, to fill out their sound by addting a second guitar. The band recorded their own album in 1998. Radio station WCPR in Biloxi, Mississippi, started playing the song Kryptonite, leading to a showcase at New York Citys CBGBs and a record contract with Republic/Universal.\n\nAfter the release of the first album, Better Life, and the number one single Kryptonite, the band added session drummer Richard to join the band so that Brad could concentrate on lead vocals.\n\nofficial web site: www.3doorsdown.com\n\nbooking agent: Ken Fromaglish / The Agency Group\n\nThisSideofSanity.com now has 13 3 Doors Down songs\n\nAway From the Sun (official video) by 3 Doors Down [play song]\n\nBehind Those Eyes by 3 Doors Down [play song]\n\nDuck And Run (official video) by 3 Doors Down [play song]\n\nHere By Me (official video) by 3 Doors Down [play song]\n\nKryptonite (official video) by 3 Doors Down [play song]\n\nLanding In London (official video) by 3 Doors Down [play song]\n\nLet Me Go (official video) by 3 Doors Down [play song]\n\nLive For Today by 3 Doors Down [play song]\n\nRunning Out of Days by 3 Doors Down [play song]\n\nSarah Yellin by 3 Doors Down [play song]\n\nThe Road Im On by 3 Doors Down [play song]\n\nTicket to Heaven by 3 Doors Down [play song]\n\nWhen Im Gone (official video) by 3 Doors Down [play song]\n\nThisSideofSanity.com now has 13 3 Doors Down songs\n\n#1 - 37906 votes for Kryptonite (official video) by 3 Doors Down [play song]\n\n#2 - 19094 votes for Away From the Sun (official video) by 3 Doors Down [play song]\n\n#3 - 17107 votes for Let Me Go (official video) by 3 Doors Down [play song]\n\n#4 - 17029 votes for When Im Gone (official video) by 3 Doors Down [play song]\n\n#5 - 16837 votes for Here By Me (official video) by 3 Doors Down [play song]\n\n#6 - 16165 votes for Duck And Run (official video) by 3 Doors Down [play song]\n\n#7 - 15854 votes for Landing In London (official video) by 3 Doors Down [play song]\n\n#8 - 12307 votes for Running Out of Days by 3 Doors Down [play song]\n\n#9 - 12195 votes for Ticket to Heaven by 3 Doors Down [play song]\n\n#10 - 11090 votes for Behind Those Eyes by 3 Doors Down [play song]\n\n#11 - 10599 votes for Live For Today by 3 Doors Down [play song]\n\n#12 - 10512 votes for Sarah Yellin by 3 Doors Down [play song]\n\n#13 - 9583 votes for The Road Im On by 3 Doors Down [play song]\n\nsingles: 3 Doors Down\n\nKryptonite 2000\n\nKryptonite\n\nSmack\n\nWhen Im Gone 2002\n\nWhen Im Gone\n\nHere Without You 2003\n\nHere Without You (radio version)\n\nHere Without You (album version)\n\nLet Me Go 2004\n\nLet Me Go (rock version)\n\nLet Me Go (alternative version)\n\nalbums: 3 Doors Down\n\nThe Better Life 1999\n\nKryptonite (follow link for lyrics)\n\nLoser (follow link for lyrics)\n\nDuck and Run (follow link for lyrics)\n\nNot Enough (follow link for lyrics)\n\nBe Like That (follow link for lyrics)\n\nLife of My Own (follow link for lyrics)\n\nBetter Life (follow link for lyrics)\n\nDown Poison (follow link for lyrics)\n\nBy My Side (follow link for lyrics)\n\nSmack (follow link for lyrics)\n\nSo I Need You (follow link for lyrics)\n\nAway From The Sun 2002\n\nWhen Im Gone (follow link for lyrics)\n\nAway From The Sun (follow link for lyrics)\n\nThe Road Im On (follow link for lyrics)\n\nTicket to Heaven (follow link for lyrics)\n\nRunning Out of Days (follow link for lyrics)\n\nHere Without You (follow link for lyrics)\n\nI Feel You (follow link for lyrics)\n\nDangerous Game (follow link for lyrics)\n\nChanges (follow link for lyrics)\n\nGoing Down In Flames (follow link for lyrics)\n\nSarah Yellin (follow link for lyrics)\n\nThis Time (Hidden Track) (follow link for lyrics)\n\nAnother 700 Miles 2003 (live)\n\nDuck And Run\n\nWhen Im Gone (Intro)\n\nWhen Im Gone\n\nKryptonite\n\nHere Without You\n\nIts Not Me\n\nThat Smell\n\nSeventeen Days 2005\n\nRight Where I Belong\n\nIts Not Me\n\nLet Me Go\n\nBe Somebody\n\nLanding in London\n\nThe Real Life\n\nBehind Those Eyes\n\nNever Will I Break\n\nFathers Son\n\nLive For Today\n\nMy World\n\nHere By Me\n\nofficial fan club:\n\nIn De Goot\n\n119 West 23rd Street, suite 609\n\nNew York, NY 10011\n\nweb sites\n\nofficial web site: www.3doorsdown.com\n\nfan web sites:\n\n3 Doors Down Fan Site Created for 3 Doors Down fans.
