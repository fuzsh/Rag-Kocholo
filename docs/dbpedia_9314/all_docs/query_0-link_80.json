        "text": "This story is featured in CityBeat's June 28 print edition.\n\nAs a 40-plus-minute conversation in mid-May with 3 Doors Down singer Brad Arnold wound down, he pondered a question about whether, after 25 years of major success, his band has any goals left to pursue.\n\n“You know, I don’t feel like there’s anything that we're chasing, but honestly, I never really have,” Arnold said. “I say it jokingly, but I’ve never really made plans. I guess I’m a rock kicker. I just kind of walk through life kicking rocks as I go.”\n\nThen came a thought that was more profound.\n\n“I told my mama not long ago and I told my wife the same thing, and I don’t mean it as dark in any way. I mean it as the brightest thing I can mean it as,” Arnold began. “I told both of them, if something happens to me tomorrow and just, I’m gone, let me tell you, I have lived like three lifetimes. In 45 years, I have lived three lifetimes. I’ve gotten to do stuff that people can’t imagine. I have been so blessed that if I don’t get to live another day, I am so thankful for the life I’ve gotten to live. Everything from here on is a bonus. And I’ve been in bonus room for a while now.”\n\nYes, the band that soared to multi-platinum popularity behind a debut album called The Better Life has pretty much lived the best life a rock band could want.\n\nTwenty-three years after “Kryptonite,” the lead single from The Better Life, became a signature hit, 3 Doors Down are in the victory lap stage of their career, touring comfortably and marking anniversaries of musical milestones from a career that has produced six studio albums (four of which went platinum or better) as well as 13 top 10 mainstream rock singles, five of which topped that chart.\n\nThis summer, the band members — Arnold, guitarist Chris Henderson, drummer Greg Upchurch, guitarist Chet Roberts and bassist Justin Biltonen — are following up a 2021 tour on which they celebrated the 20-year anniversary of The Better Life by playing that seven-times platinum album in its entirety. This summer, the second 3 Doors Down album, Away From The Sun, (itself a quadruple-platinum hit) is getting a similar live treatment to mark its two-decade anniversary.\n\nArnold said the band learned a few things about how to structure a set list from doing the anniversary tour for The Better Life and those discoveries are influencing how 3 Doors Down are presenting the songs from Away From The Sun this summer.\n\n“What we found during The Better Life tour is if you just play the album tracklist (in order), you kind of can wind up with a few dead spots in there that maybe some people that aren’t maybe as diehard of fans or weren’t around for the record and don’t know those deeper cuts, you start seeing people get a little bored in the crowd,” he said. “So about halfway through that Better Life tour we said, ‘All right, we’re going to play this whole record, but let’s pick a couple spots and sprinkle a song they know in there.’ So I think we’ll probably start out playing as many songs consecutively off of the (Away From The Sun) record as we can. But most of that record’s singles are kind of toward the beginning of the record. So as we get into the deeper cuts, we’ll sprinkle some hits (from other albums) in there, too, to keep everybody singing along and (hearing) songs that they know. We want to play the whole record, but we want to bring about the best show possible as well.”\n\nArnold still considers Away From The Sun one of his favorite 3 Doors Down albums, and he expects this summer’s tour will bring back fond memories — just as playing The Better Life album did on that previous tour.\n\nNot surprisingly, becoming a popular band with The Better Life album and getting to tour across the U.S. and in countries around the world was a life-changing and eye-opening experience for the band, which started out in the small Mississippi town of Escatawpa and had never toured before recording that first album.\n\n“It was a lot for us,” said Arnold, noting he had just turned 21 when touring began. “And we went so many places on that first record that I think on Away From The Sun, in some ways, I think we felt like veterans. But it had changed us a lot, going out there like that. I was saying it to somebody the other day that I am so incredibly thankful that I had a good family — and I still have a good family — but that I had a good family with a good mama and daddy and good brothers and sisters that didn’t want anything for me but to be alright.”\n\nWhat became particularly significant as writing began for Away From The Sun were the stories the band members heard from fans while on tour about how certain songs related to experiences from their lives. These stories flavored the mood of the band members and the lyrics that Arnold and his bandmates wrote for the second album.\n\n“You meet so many people and when you start hearing so many of these worldly experiences, especially when you’re not a worldly guy from a little bitty town and you don’t know nothing about anything and you start hearing these experiences, you learn that there’s a lot of dark in the world,” Arnold said. “I think that stayed in our minds with us and I think a lot of the lyrics, at least, got written in that darkness I’d seen in the world and a lot of the darkness I felt in me.”\n\nThat’s not to suggest that writing and recording Away From The Sun was at all a depressing experience for 3 Doors Down.\n\nIn fact, even though 3 Doors Down were trying to follow up a hugely successful debut album, Arnold said he and his bandmates didn’t feel much pressure in making Away From The Sun, thanks to having written the song “When I’m Gone” while on tour promoting The Better Life.\n\n“Between our management and label, they had already heard it, and they were like ‘Yeah, that’s most likely going to be the first single off of the second record because that’s a good song,” Arnold said. “(We began writing) that record not knowing, but feeling like we already had one hit. So it took the pressure off of it.”\n\n“When I’m Gone” became another No. 1 single for 3 Doors Down, and Away From The Sun later spawned a second chart-topper in “Here Without You,” solidifying the group’s place at the forefront of the mainstream rock scene.\n\nArnold remembers the tour to promote Away From The Sun as a great experience as well. The band played arenas and other large venues, stayed in nice hotels and had grown more confident as a live band. But the memory that sticks most involves the fans.\n\n“We recorded a live Away From The Sun show over in Houston, and I’m so glad we did that so I can go back and watch it and really re-remember the passion of those crowds back then,” Arnold said. “That was a good time in music, it really was. That’s my favorite thing to look back on.”\n\n3 Doors Down play the Rose Music Center at The Heights at 8 p.m. July 7. Info: rosemusiccenter.com."
