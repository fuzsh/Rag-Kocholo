        "text": "They began as a local rock band in 1996, but when an original song called Kryptonite caught fire on a Biloxi radio station three years later, the trio from Escatawpa, Mississippi suddenly became one of America's hottest acts. Their first professional album \"The Better Life\" burned up the Billboard charts. 3 Doors Down were on their way. and there would be no turning back.\n\n\"We've been through a lot,” says lead singer Brad Arnold. “It has not been a straight road. It's been a really, really crooked road.\"\n\nThat was 20 years ago and now Brad and current members of the band are taking the show on the road again playing more than 40 dates this summer and fall with \"The Better Life\" 20th Anniversary tour.\n\n\"To go from driving a forklift to traveling the world and playing 300 shows a year that first few years at least, it was a lot to hand a 21 year old,” says Brad. “And I'm incredibly thankful for my family and the people of the Gulf Coast down there because everybody just helped us keep it real, you know?\"\n\nThis tour comes as America is trying to emerge from more than a year sheltering from the Coronavirus epidemic, one that had Brad isolated on his farm in Tennessee.\n\n\"It was real nice to be at home and not feel like I needed to be somewhere else, because I couldn't be, you know?\" he says.\n\nBut now, Brad and the band are ready to recreate the magic that lead to the sale of more than 15 million albums. But bands evolve for various reasons, not all of them positive. Two original members are gone. Matt Roberts passed away from an overdose in 2016, while Todd Harrell lost his spot in the band two years earlier because of DUI's, one of them to took a life- painful moments that weigh on Brad's mind even as the tour with the current band gets underway.\n\n\"Because, you know, by the Grace of God, we're all sober. Everybody in this band is sober. And that's something, if I could go back and redo it, I'd redo it in a heartbeat and just be that way our entire career, because it would be, it would be so much different, you know? It would have been a lot different road.\"\n\nBut this road takes them to The Wharf in Orange Beach on July 23rd.\n\nAnd Brad and 3 Doors Down have one mission on their minds-\n\n\"I want everybody to have a great time,” says Brad. “I want everybody to expect to have a good time and to have a good time. And we have one goal. I want everybody to walk out of the Wharf with a smile on their face. \"\n\n3 Doors Down’s “The Better Life” 20th Anniversary Tour"
