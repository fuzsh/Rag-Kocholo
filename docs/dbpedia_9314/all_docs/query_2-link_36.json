        "text": "BRAD ARNOLD\n\n3doorsdown.com\n\nBrad Arnold is the lead singer for the platinum-selling rock band 3 Doors Down, which rose to fame in 2000 and has since been a favorite on the Billboard charts. The group just kicked off its Gang of Outlaws Tour with ZZ Top and Gretchen Wilson, which stops at the St. Augustine Amphitheatre tonight. Music starts at 6:30 p.m., and tickets are $55-$135. Go to staugamphitheatre.com.\n\nTo preface his Gimme 5, Arnold says, \"I believe we've all been blessed with this life we have. I think it's important to use every day to enjoy life. Having days off in so many places really allows us to do that. I'm very thankful for it all.\"\n\n5 favorite things to do on a day off while on the road\n\n1. Camping. We've been staying at campgrounds on our day off. It's been great being in nature instead of a hotel parking lot!\n\n2. Seeing the sights of whatever city or town we're in.\n\n3. Riding anything that has wheels - bicycles, skateboards, scooters, motorcycles. And please, God, let there be go-carts!\n\n4. I love travel days through different parts of the country.\n\n5. I enjoy hanging with the road-crew guys, aka \"The Wolf Pack\" aka \"The Traveling Trailer Park.\"\n\nheather.lovejoy@jacksonville.com, (904) 359-4539"
