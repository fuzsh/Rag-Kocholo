        "text": "Two for the Road is a series in which two artists touring together chat about playing shows, life backstage, and more. The latest installment of the series features Creed’s Scott Stapp and Mark Tremonti chatting with 3 Doors Down’s Brad Arnold and Chris Henderson.\n\nCreed are set to embark on a massive reunion tour this summer and fall, with 3 Doors Down as direct support on most dates. Ahead of the extensive outing, Creed’s Scott Stapp and Mark Tremonti caught up with 3 Doors Down’s Brad Arnold and Chris Henderson via Zoom for Consequence‘s Two for the Road series.\n\nIn April, Creed played their first shows in 12 years aboard a pair of “Summer of ’99” cruises, the first of which also featured 3 Doors Down. Starting July 17th, Creed will kick off the “Summer of ’99 Tour,” with 3 Doors Down and Finger Eleven on the majority of shows. That will be followed by Creed’s fall “Are You Ready? Tour,” also featuring 3 Doors Down, with Mammoth WVH as additional support.\n\nThe summer run is essentially sold out, with limited tickets remaining via Ticketmaster for the fall run. Fans can also get tickets to sold-out dates via StubHub, where your purchase is 100% guaranteed through StubHub’s Fan Protect program.\n\nGet Creed Tickets Here\n\nIn their Two for the Road conversation (watch above), the Creed and 3 Doors Down members discuss the first time they heard each other’s music, their early tours together, what they’re looking forward to the most about these upcoming tours, their response to music critics, and more.\n\nTremonti and Stapp also shared a few real-life “Spinal Tap” moments that happened to Creed onstage over the years, including one that found Stapp in a hilarious predicament.\n\nBoth Creed and 3 Doors Down landed multiple entries on Consequence‘s recent list of the 50 Greatest Post-Grunge Songs, with Creed’s “Higher” taking the No. 1 spot.\n\nWatch the full Two for the Road conversation featuring Scott Stapp, Mark Tremonti, Brad Arnold, and Chris Henderson above, and see Creed’s summer and fall tour dates below.\n\nTrouble viewing the video in the player above?
