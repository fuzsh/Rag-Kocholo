        "text": "How we can apply the principles of effective altruism to Peter Singer’s Animal Liberation Now.\n\nAnimal Liberation Now, the updated and rewritten edition of Peter Singer's groundbreaking book Animal Liberation, is an urgent call to radically rethink humanity's relationship with animals.\n\nOriginally published in 1975, Animal Liberation exposed the widespread abuse of animals in factory farms and laboratories, revealing the appalling and unnecessary suffering they endure. Over the past five decades, Singer's arguments about animal sentience have been vindicated by scientific research, and the book has played a pivotal role in changing public opinion and inspiring a global movement for animal rights.\n\nPractical action to help animals through effective giving\n\nAt Giving What We Can, we recognise the immense suffering of animals across the world, and we're happy to recommend some cost-effective charities working to improve animal welfare.\n\nOur approach to recommending charities is in line with the principles of effective altruism, which aims to use reason and evidence to do the most good we can, in this case, to improve the welfare of animals across the globe.\n\nWe generally recommend giving via a fund (here’s why). These are our top-rated funds helping animals:\n\nEffective Altruism Funds' Animal Welfare Fund\n\nAnimal Charity Evaluators' Recommended Charity Fund\n\nAnimal Charity Evaluators' Movement Grants Fund\n\nThese are our top-rated charities supporting animal welfare:\n\nFaunalytics\n\nGood Food Institute\n\nThe Humane League\n\nTake a pledge to donate to high-impact animal charities\n\nGiving What We Can is best known for our Giving What We Can Pledge to donate at least 10% of lifetime income to highly effective charities. We also offer a trial pledge that allows you to pledge 1%-10% of your income from 6 months to 10 years.\n\nIf you’re serious about committing to help animals through giving, explore our pledges.\n\nMore to explore\n\nHigh impact causes within animal welfare\n\nAdvocating for farmed animals\n\nReducing consumption of animal products\n\nHelping wild animals\n\nLearn more about improving animal welfare.\n\nIn the media"
