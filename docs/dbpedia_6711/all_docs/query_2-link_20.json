        "text": "Bioethicist Lance Stell has challenged those who demand that research not be performed with animals by arguing that they should feel honor bound to refrain from the fruits of current biomedical research. – Chapter 9, page 198\n\nDR. MORRISON'S BOOK AN ODYSSEY WITH ANIMALS IS A REFRESHING DEPARTURE FROM THE EXISTING AND TYPICALLY POLARIZING LITERATURE DEALING with the contentious issue of the use of animals in biomedical research. Dr. Morrison grew up on a farm, is a veterinarian, has always had—and still has—beloved personal pets, and has performed research involving animals resulting in major contributions to the field of sleep medicine. His personal research, his previous role as director of the Office of Animal Research Issues at the National Institute of Mental Health, and his outspoken advocacy of animal welfare legitimize his credibility.\n\nFollowing the devastating 1990 attack on his laboratory by the Animal Liberation Front (ALF) and threats made on his life and upon the safety of his family members, it might have been expected that he would join the vitriolic camp. To the contrary, this work is a thoughtful, insightful, and highly personal reflective analysis of his ambivalence toward the use of animals. Although animal use in biomedical research is emphasized, he also discusses contemporary animal use in a sociologic and cultural context (hunting, trapping, wearing furs, agriculture, bull fighting, cock fighting, and rodeos).\n\nThis book provides a nonconfrontational discussion of the relationship among animal rights/welfare activists, extremists, and the animal welfare movement, emphasizing the very important and oft-confused difference between animal welfare and animal rights.\n\nCentral questions addressed include:\n\nMay one ethically and morally interfere in the lives of other species, to the point of harming and even killing them?\n\nWhen is the use of animals appropriate and when is it not?\n\nAre there good reasons to put humans into a special category that excludes animals, while still recognizing our relatedness to them?\n\nThe continued growth of opposition to the use of animals in biomedical research is attributed to 3 factors: (1) younger generations are unable to appreciate how such research has improved the quality (or very existence) of their lives (think diabetes, bacterial infections, polio epidemics), (2) urbanization has progressively removed the postdomestic society from the natural and agricultural worlds, and (3) the bombardment of propaganda offering distorted, false, or misleading perspectives on animal use.\n\nDr. Morrison reviews his early personal history with animals and discusses the boundaries between humans and animals.\n\nUntil recently, traditional notions of animal welfare existed: people were permitted to use animals, but cruelty to animals was eschewed. Currently, the beliefs of the extreme end of the modern animal rights and liberation movement propose that animals cannot be used for any purpose—period—and that animals be considered equal to humans under the law. The concept of speciesism (a term undoubtedly chosen to imply racism), which challenges the primacy of humankind, is discussed.\n\nThe proposed substitutes for animal research (epidemiology, tissue cultures, autopsies, and computers) are acknowledged to have a place in research, but to seriously think that these techniques can possibly eliminate animal experimentation is naïive.\n\nThere is speculation as to what humankind would lose if animals were granted the same rights afforded to humans in a free society. The author thoughtfully considers how we can best treat (and use) animals without sacrificing the well-being of our fellow humans. He feels that the extremist view that all interactions with animals (including even well-cared-for pets) diminishes the moral value of human life. His ultimate allegiance is to biomedical science and human welfare.\n\nDr. Morrison believes there are distinct physical, moral, and philosophical boundaries between animals and humans that can be rationally defended and should be. He convincingly concludes that (1) our primary obligation is to fellow human beings, (2) the use of animals by humans is appropriate and natural when viewed within an evolutionary context (humans possess unique cognitive and emotional abilities) and, (3) the move from animal welfare to animal rights results in inhumanity toward man.\n\nUnfortunately, scientists and clinicians are inclined to remain silent on this issue—probably with the hope that it will just fade away (the proverbial “don't ask, don't tell” policy). More regrettably, a number of professional organizations, including one of our own, have chosen to remain relatively uninvolved, despite the vital importance of the use of animals in sleep research designed to improve the human condition.\n\nAs a clinician whose career has been completely dependent upon information that could be learned exclusively from animal experimentation, this book is particularly welcome and valuable. Hopefully, it will encourage clinicians, researchers, and professional organizations alike to become more actively and aggressively involved in this critical debate. This easy-to-read book filled with poignant personal anecdotes will be an invaluable resource to all sides dealing with this difficult and often emotional issue. Disagreements will undoubtedly continue—ideally without implied or overt violence."
