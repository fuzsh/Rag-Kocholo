        "text": "Sue Donaldson and Will Kymlicka wrote a remarkable book of political philosophy, called “Zoopolis: A Political Theory of Animal Rights”. In the introduction of the book, the authors argue that after 180 years of organized animal advocacy, no demonstrable progress has been made to dismantle the system of animal exploita­tion. This statement is not meant to discredit the valuable work activists and advocates have done. It is meant to point out that the social, legal, and political structures responsible have remained intact. They propose a different path for animal advocacy, a future where other animals are not only protected, but enabled to shape society as well. Their work describes a picture of what a multispecies just society could look like. To better understand their proposal and how it is different, we first need to see what has been done until now, and in what ways it hasn’t worked.\n\nAccording to their view, the failure to dismantle the larger system of animal exploitation is a result of the three predominant ways in which animal issues are debated in public. Most of the discussions come from a welfarist, ecological, or basic rights approach (Donaldson & Kymlicka, 2011).\n\nFirst, by ‘welfarist’ they mean a view that opposes certain forms of cruelty, yet which takes for granted that other animals can be used for human interests, if it's done within certain limits. Welfarism can be identified by its principle of ‘humane use’. It aims to reduce, what it claims to be, 'unnecessary harm' to which non-human animals are subjected. However, it leaves intact the larger structures of domination and exploitation. The 'welfarist' approach supports a clear moral hierarchy in which humans stand above. It does not question whether humans should use other animals, but how they should use them in a 'humane' way.\n\nSecond, the ‘ecological’ approach. This view implies a focus on the health of ecosystems. Like welfarism, this approach can be critical of certain human practices. But it also ends up favoring conservation and restoration initiatives that support killing individuals of non-endangered species. After all, its goal is to achieve a holistic vision of a so-called ‘natural' and 'sustainable' ecosystem, not to give equal consideration to all individuals.\n\nThe authors point out that, in light of these limitations, many activists and advocates have supported a third approach. An ‘animal rights’ framework considers other animals, like humans, individual beings. They should have a right not to be tortured, imprisoned, or experimented on. And, like humans, they shouldn't be sepa­rated from their families, killed for \"eating too many rare orchids\" (p. 4), or for altering the so-called Nature. Donaldson and Kymlicka accept the core premise of this approach. In their view, inviolable rights, such as the right not to be owned, killed, confined, or tortured are the only truly effective protections that take into account individual animals. Inviolable rights simply imply that an individual cannot be sacrificed for the \"greater good\" of others, a view that is well established when it comes to humans. However, the authors don't stop here. Their goal is to challenge particular ideas coming from animal rights theory.\n\nThe authors identify two main paths in animal rights literature that aim to address the mistreatment of domesticated animals: a threshold approach and an abolitionist approach, which they also call extinctionist (Donaldson & Kymlicka, 2011).\n\nThe 'threshold' approach seeks to \"define certain thresholds for allow­able 'uses' of domesticated animals, while prohibiting their 'exploitation\" (p. 89). The worries that come with this approach are easy to spot. Although, in principle, Donaldson and Kymlicka do not rule out the possibility of drawing a line between permissible and impermissible instrumental relationships entirely, they argue that these views end up offering weak safeguards. The 'threshold' approach can easily reproduce relations of exploitation while allowing for various violations of rights. It can institutionalize a subordinate status to domesticated animals and \"become a pretext for ongoing exploitation\" (p. 95) as we've seen with welfarism. This is why many have supported an abolitionist approach.\n\nAbolitionism seeks to tackle the relationship of domination directly. It proposes that we \"remove ourselves from the equation... as owners, overlords, stewards\" (p. 78) by ending our use of domesticated animals. Abolitionism sees the history of domestication as a violent process, a process in which humans have forcibly enslaved and bred non-human animals for centuries. Its purpose was to transform different animals into docile, compliant, and dependent beings that can please a variety of human interests and whims. For this reason, many abolitionists seek an end to our interactions with domesticated animals and a future without them. Donaldson and Kymlicka agree that the history of domestication is \"a story of ever-intensifying degrees of enslavement, abuse, exploitation, and murder\" (p. 76). They too think that justice requires abolishing the system of animal exploitation that breeds non-human animals to life for human use. However, they disagree about what our future should look like. In their view, it is wrong to assume that to make things just we need to end all our interactions with domesticated animals and create a future in which they are no longer born.\n\nThe authors argue that many abolitionists assume humans can eventually inhabit a separate space from other animals and that potential con­flict could be eliminated in this way. Because of this, they claim, abolitionism avoids addressing the relational obligations that we have towards other animals. So, they criticize it on this basis. Interactions between human and non-human animals are simply inevitable. We share our spaces with innumerable animals. They will continue to exist even if humans no longer cap­ture, enslave, and breed animals for their own interests. Sparrows, squirrels, bats, mice, and countless others, will live on and cohabit with humans in shared spaces. That is because humans do not exist outside of Nature and many non-human animals have adapted to live around various human settlements. A complete separation from other animals is impossible. This is one of the reasons why humans cannot ignore their positive and relational obligations towards them. Another reason is our history. We are responsible for the future that domesticated animals have, because they were forcibly brought into our society and are deprived of other possible forms of existence. Humans cannot keep ignoring their right to have a say, to be consulted, or to shape collective decisions (Kymnlicka and Donaldson, 2016).\n\nAbolitionism, they argue, fails to conceive good lives for domesticated animals and it ignores the many liminal animals that live among us. Although it responds in a meaningful way against welfarism and it raises important issues, it also raises serious questions. Just think of the massive biopolitical control needed for this approach to succeed structurally. This might well imply coercion, confinement, and separation from their families. It raises serious questions about bodily integrity. And it can easily violate all sorts of basic liberties to achieve its end goal. Donaldson and Kymlicka agree that we need to stop breeding domesticated animals, but we should also limit our intervention upon their bodies. The aim is to expand their liberties and choices so that they can end up deciding on their own. Their goal isn't to breed domesticated animals out of existence because they have lost their 'natural features' or because they are dependent on humans or on social and material structures in which humans belong. Drawing from disability justice and feminist critiques, they argue that \"[d]ependency doesn't intrinsically involve a loss of dignity\" (Donaldson & Kymlicka, 2011, p. 84). The problem is how we respond to it. \"Dependency, though highly variable, is an inescapable fact of life for us all. Indignity does not arise from this fact. Indignity arises when our needs are belittled, exploited, and/or unmet by those who should know better\" (p. 84). Dependency, in their view, is not the opposite of independence, but a precursor to autonomy. Thus, it's the society in which domesticated animals live that should adapt to their needs, it's not their state that is undignified.\n\nZoopolis tells us that our public responsibilities towards domestic animals are much bigger than just leaving them alone, or working towards a future without them. One question we need to start asking seriously is how they \"want public power to be exercised so as to reshape society to better suit their interests\" (Kymlicka, 2017, p. 180). After all, it has been well documented that non-human animals have complex social hierarchies. They make group decisions about when and where to move. They even vote with their feet or by standing up. However, politics isn't about voting. We all know that such a view is quite narrow. There's no reason to think that other animals wouldn't co-shape our interaction given the proper chance and without being silenced as a political group. Many acts are political. Humans too engage in various political acts beyond voting. Destroying private property, working in another country because of poor living conditions, or forming communities of resistance, all of these acts are political.\n\nTraditional animal rights theory has criticized again and again the treatment of other animals in our societies, from factory farms to zoos and labs. And to date, we have an enormous, rich literature about how non-human animals shouldn’t be treated. (Festival végane de Montréal, 2018) However, Donaldson and Kymlicka tell us that animal rights theory has said little about how we should relate with other animals.\n\nWhat kind of relations do other animals want to have with us?\n\nThis question, though so simple to raise and so important to ask, hasn’t been addressed much. In order to have an answer to this question we need to change the environment in which other animals live. Changing their social and material conditions can ensure that they too can actively choose what kind of lives to have. To know what relations non-human animals want to have with us, we need to allow and help create intentional interspecies communities. That is to say, spaces in which domesticated animals can choose when, how, and on what terms they want to engage with humans.\n\nThe freedom of those that run needs the earth, like the freedom of those that fly needs the sky. What do pigeons want, what do squirrels, chickens or bears desire? Food, water, companionship, yes. What kind of space do they need? Does anyone want us around, maybe? To know, to really know, we should explore in such a way that they’re allowed to answer.\n\nIn Zoopolis, the animals are thought of in three categories, trying to stay true to their differential needs based on their relations and interests. The categories, wild, liminal and domestic, are not static - animals of any species might wonder from one to the other given their particular life circumstances. In general, however, the three categories consider what possible interests might animals have and what relationships with human communities might benefit them. Wild animals, those that are free-roaming, such as foxes, lions and beavers, might want nothing to do with humans, and prefer distance from us - thus, they should be afforded sovereignty over their territories, which are not to be taken over for human interests. Domesticated animals, given their history of exploitation and, most often, dependence to humans and their social communities, should benefit from protection and care if they wish so, and be able to choose what sort of life to live - to be co-citizens of a multispecies society they helped build, or to be free from human involvement, choosing another territory. One of the advantages of this model is that it clearly names another category that was previously invisibilized and overlooked, a category that did not fit into the wild/domesticated dualism. Liminal animals, such as crows, pigeons, squirrels, coyotes, depend on human settlements, but usually not on specific relations with humans. Their place in Zoopolis is one of residents, not of citizens. Why so? Because citizenship requires some duties of socialization which liminal animals might not be interested in at all. Let’s think through this.\n\nThink of a calf. Not just any calf, but one with a name, not just a human name, but a name from their mother, too. All animals learn life skills from their mothers, if they are allowed to. And if they’re allowed, they learn from many more individuals. In farmed animal sanctuaries, for example, elder cows teach the young ones the rules and the manners of their pasture - there’s no need for humans to do it. Socialization is a process through which all social animals go through, and sometimes this socialization is between different species, which is to say, interspecific or interspecies. In the case of domesticated animals who are viewed as co-citizens, they have a right to residency, they’re part of the public, thus they should be supported in manifesting their preferences, and exercising their political agency to shape society. What might this look like? For example, cows might signal their desire to live in a different pasture, might be able to choose to intermingle with humans or slowly retreat from human society. Attention to their needs can teach us what they want, just like attention to dogs’ needs teaches us that some dogs like running a lot, and others like staying indoors. In the model that Donaldson and Kymlicka are proposing, domesticated animals have a right to shape their interactions with humans by choosing for themselves what kind of relations they want to have with us, and humans have a duty to acknowledge this politically without denying their freedoms.\n\nSo did you know crows remember humans who wronged them? Not that the capacity to remember should grant rights, but it’s good to know. For liminal animals such as crows, typically considered “wild”, but who live and thrive in human settlements, Zoopolis proposes a form of protection called denizenship, for its minimal intervention in comparison to citizenship. Crows, ferrets, sparrows and other liminal animals have a right of residency, but based on their interests in cooperating with human society, they are required less, as they probably don’t want to engage as much as domesticated animals. The flexibility of these categories based on situation and interests, their strong protections in terms of a right to life, and their proposal for positive rights are just some of the things that make them so useful to think with. For example, this crow, considered liminal, if injured and rescued, might wish to become closer to the humans who cared for her. Or she might not. Either way, her wish could be respected, and her voice would count.\n\nNow think of a bear. A bear in the forests of Eastern Europe, diminishing forests, some that are being restored, some not. For wild animals, the authors propose a framework of sovereignty, in the sense of a claim over territory, a right to live their own lives away from foreign rule. Sovereignty, as a political tool, would protect wild animals from particular injustices, such as human encroachment over their lands. In the case of the bear, their forests have been cut and sold, their food sources diminished. If sovereignty is recognized, not only such plunder is not possible anymore, but compensation is necessary. Yet what about the fawn, whose life might be ended by the bear? According to the authors, this unfortunate death is not a result of social injustice, but rather a feature of ecosystems. Animals have various skills that allow them to survive, and to act as if they didn’t, intervening in all of their relationships to control them, cannot be just. Their wild, sovereign territories, shouldn’t be seen as “failed states”, because violence exists, to different degrees, in all states, and this does not warrant foreign involvement automatically. Moreover, sovereignty for wild animals should account for mobility, ecological viability, the multiple dimensions of territory, and the many possibilities we might have for cohabitation.\n\nThe paradigm of rights has received critique for various reasons. Rights are criticized for being too anthropocentric, too focused on individual liberties, or for giving too much legitimacy to state power. Such critiques have legitimate worries. We agree with many points they make. However, some of the raised critiques are shared by people who are overly suspicious about the rights of other animals, instead of their own rights and privileges. Some of these critiques lack substantial alternatives and give no practical ways to protect non-human animals. They leave a system that constantly profits from their death, labour, and bodies to be addressed in a better future. Because of this, we think it is imperative to draw a difference between rights that guarantee the liberties of powerful actors at the expense of those who are marginalized and rights that limit the liberties of the powerful to guarantee participation for the marginalized. Without specifying what we mean by rights, we risk losing the opportunity of being tactical and critical. Are we talking about negative rights or rights that apply to members of a certain community? And who benefits from the kind of liberties that are privileged or restrained? For example, animal rights can directly tackle property rights, and can be used to disrupt and disarm human supremacy, to some degree. Some rights can ensure that the animals who are now suffering the most in our society can have other lives. Inviolable rights for example can directly challenge the animal industrial complex, and guarantee that other animals are no longer bred to be disabled, and then dismembered for capitalist and human interests. Positive rights, on the other hand, aim for a future in which other animals have space, mobility, and the opportunity to act and decide the kind of lives they want to have. Of course, we need to question how rights are assigned in the first place. How sovereignty appears and is determined. After all, it's certain rights that we are opposing. Yet, disqualifying the rights that are aimed to protect marginalized individuals without guaranteeing better protections in exchange is dangerous, not to say, irresponsible, within the current system. So, regardless of how our society is organized now, we need to look for all the ways we can find to ensure that risks and benefits are shared equally between all its members. Rights can potentially ensure that the lives, views, and needs of other animals matter, and that they matter now, not in an ideal future.\n\nCan you hear them? My neighbours. I live in the bird side of town. Sounds a bit funny, doesn’t it? But I love it. There are so many birds, you cannot imagine! Pigeons, crows, sparrows, even some great tits! I learned their species one by one, and then their names, for some. One likes to come by my window a lot, I call them ALF, and they come a bit closer for snacks. They get along well with SHAC, our resident cat, he’s a chunky ball of orange fluff. Our side of town is actually off-limits to stranger cats, but some cats like birds a lot, like me, and they protect them from other cats. My parents, Genie and I, we’re responsible for the avian loft of this block, and even though it’s a bit of work, I like it because I’m making lots of friends. The other side of town has cats free-roaming, but also spaces for pigs, goats, sheep and horses, just on the outskirts. I adore them all! Not all my friends do, but anyway, there’s some parks just for certain species, so everyone can be happy. Mum says that’s a new thing, before there were cars and car parks, just big pieces of hot ugly metal resting in all our public spaces. Sometimes I can’t believe how people were in the past. It was only two generations ago that many of my friends would have been imprisoned, killed, and tortured. You’d think they wouldn’t kill pigeons too, what for, right? But they didn’t like their poop on buildings. Well, I would have pooped on all of their buildings just to spite them! Somedays I really cannot believe all of this happened. Auntie says mum told me the truth too early, that I’m too young, and it will affect me. I hope it does! I never want to see my friends killed. I won’t allow it. I can’t even believe I would have had the power to decide such a thing, long ago. What friendship could that have even been?"
