(I have also been considering trying to read Agamben's Homo Sacer, and perhaps Guattari's Three Ecologies, alongside these.)\n\nWhile I would be interested in finding out about any works that might help supplement the study, anything from critical animal studies to deconstructionist/schizoanalytic approaches to the general question, I would definitely love to discover a robust critical study of the animal-human relation in Western thought/letters."
