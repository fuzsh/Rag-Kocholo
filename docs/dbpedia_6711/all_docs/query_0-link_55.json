        "text": "The Gospel of Kindness by Janet M. Davis\n\nCall Number: HV4764 .D38 2016\n\nWhen we consider modern American animal advocacy, we often think of veganism, no-kill shelters, Internet campaigns against trophy hunting, or celebrities declaring that they would \"rather go naked\" than wear fur. Contemporary critics readily dismiss animal protectionism as a modern secularmovement that privileges animals over people. Yet the movement's roots are deeply tied to the nation's history of religious revivalism and social reform.In The Gospel of Kindness, Janet M. Davis explores the broad cultural and social influence of the American animal welfare movement at home and overseas from the Second Great Awakening to the Second World War.\n\nAnimals and the Human Imagination: A Companion to Animal Studies by Aaron Gross\n\nCall Number: Electronically available\n\nThis interdisciplinary and cross-cultural collection reflects the growth of animal studies as an independent field and the rise of \"animality\" as a critical lens through which to analyze society and culture, on a par with race and gender. Essays consider the role of animals in the human imagination and the imagination of the human; the worldviews of indigenous peoples; animal-human mythology in early modern China; and political uses of the animal in postcolonial India. They engage with the theoretical underpinnings of the animal protection movement, representations of animals in children's literature, depictions of animals in contemporary art, and the philosophical positioning of the animal from Aristotle to Derrida. The strength of this companion lies in its timeliness and contextual diversity, which makes it essential reading for students and researchers while further developing the parameters of the discipline.\n\nMeat Culture by Annie Potts\n\nCall Number: Electronically available\n\nThe analysis of meat and its place in Western culture has been central to Human-Animal Studies as a field. It is even more urgent now as global meat and dairy production are projected to rise dramatically by 2050. 'Meat Culture', edited by Annie Potts, interrogates the representations and discourses, practices and behaviours, diets and tastes that generate shared beliefs about, perspectives on and experiences of meat in the 21st century.\n\nThe Animal Rights Struggle: an essay in historical sociology by Christophe Traïni\n\nCall Number: Electronic resource\n\nSince the early nineteenth century, numerous campaigns have denounced the mistreatment of animals. Originally published in French as La cause animale, this book compares the British and French histories of the animal-protection movement to retrace its origins and assess its impact up to the present day. As Christophe Traïni shows, the struggle for animal rights-inextricably linked to the rise of philanthropy and established long before the birth of the ecology movement-developed out of several important social and political processes, including changes in sensibilities and socially approved emotions, new definitions of what constitutes legitimate violence, and the influence of religious beliefs.\n\nAnimal Abuse: helping animals and people by Catherine Tiplady\n\nCall Number: HV4708 .T57 2013\n\nAnimal abuse affects everybody working in animal-related industries, and constitutes a significant part of veterinary caseloads and animal shelter work. Based on the author's experience as a shelter worker and veterinarian, this book provides advice and assistance to those working with animal abuse. Beginning with definitions and types of abuse that occur worldwide in domestic, industry, leisure and cultural settings, the book goes on to detail current topics of debate such as foie gras production, pedigree dog breeding, links between animal abuse and domestic violence, and the fascinating subject of veterinary forensics - the scientific investigation of instances of animal abuse. The book's practical focus is developed through interviews with people in a variety of affected roles, international case studies, and discussion of the difficulties that arise; how they can be dealt with and the mental health impacts they can have on those involved. With contributions from world-renowned experts including Phil Arkow and David Bailey, and an introduction by Clive Phillips, Animal Abuse: Helping Animals and People provides practical advice and insights into issues surrounding this emotional subject.\n\nIndigenous Creatures, Native Knowledges, and the Arts by Susan McHugh (Editor); Wendy Woodward (Editor)\n\nCall Number: GR705 .I63 2017\n\nThis volume illuminates how creative representations remain sites of ongoing struggles to engage with animals in indigenous epistemologies. Traditionally imagined in relation to spiritual realms and the occult, animals have always been more than primitive symbols of human relations. Whether as animist gods, familiars, conduits to ancestors, totems, talismans, or co-creators of multispecies cosmologies, animals act as vital players in the lives of cultures. From early days in colonial contact zones through contemporary expressions in art, film, and literature, the volume's unique emphasis on Southern Africa and North America - historical loci of the greatest ranges of species and linguistic diversity - help to situate how indigenous knowledges of human-animal relations are being adapted to modern conditions of life shared across species lines.\n\nAnimal Characters: Nonhuman Beings in Early Modern Literature by Bruce Thomas Boehrer\n\nCall Number: PR149.A7 B64 2010 and Electronically available\n\nIn Animal Characters Bruce Thomas Boehrer follows five species—the horse, the parrot, the cat, the turkey, and the sheep—through their appearances in an eclectic mix of texts, from romances and poetry to cookbooks and natural histories. He shows how dramatic changes in animal character types between 1400 and 1700 relate to the emerging economy and culture of the European Renaissance. In early modern European culture, animals not only served humans as sources of labor, companionship, clothing, and food; these nonhuman creatures helped to form an understanding of personhood. Incorporating readings of Shakespeare's plays, Milton's Paradise Lost, Margaret Cavendish's Blazing World, and other works, Boehrer's series of animal character studies illuminates a fascinating period of change in interspecies relationships.\n\nAnimal minds & animal ethics: connecting two separate fields by Klaus Petrus\n\nCall Number: B105.A55 A546 2013 and Electronically available\n\nPhilosophers investigating questions of animal ethics tend to draw on animal cognition research while subscribing to strong positions regarding animal minds, and philosophers pursuing the question of animal minds frequently draw conclusions from the arguments of ethical philosophers. Despite this exchange, animal mind and animal ethics research have developed in fundamentally different directions. One reason for this divison lies in the institutional distinction between theoretical and practical philosophy.\n\nCritical Animal Studies by John Sorenson (Editor); Atsuko Matsuoka (Editor)\n\nCall Number: Electronic resource\n\nThis important book charts new territory by showcasing some of the newest developments in the rapidly-growing field of Critical Animal Studies. Critical Animal Studies presents a radical ethical and normative challenge to existing systems of power in the context of neoliberal capitalism and to the existential structure of speciesism. The essays in this book link activist and academic approaches to dismantle the exploitation and oppression of nonhuman animals. Featuring an international team of contributors, the book reflects the transdisciplinary character of Critical Animal Studies, with chapters by activists and academics from disciplines across the social sciences, including historical archaeology, political science, psychology, geography, law, social work and philosophy. The book provides advanced-level students with an ideal introduction to a wide range of perspectives on Critical Animal Studies, amongst other things proposing new ways of considering animal advocacy, decolonization and liberation.\n\nAnimal personalities behavior, physiology, and evolution by Claudio Carere and Dario Maestripieri\n\nCall Number: (electronic resource)\n\nThe study of animal personality is one of the fastest-growing areas of research in behavioral and evolutionary biology. Here Claudio Carere and Dario Maestripieri, along with a host of scholars from fields as diverse as ecology, genetics, endocrinology, neuroscience, and psychology, provide a comprehensive overview of the current research on animal personality. Grouped into thematic sections, chapters approach the topic with empirical and theoretical material and show that to fully understand why personality exists, we must consider the evolutionary processes that give rise to personality, the ecological correlates of personality differences, and the physiological mechanisms underlying personality variation.\n\nAnimals in our lives: human-animal interaction in family, community, and therapeutic settings by Peggy D. McCardle\n\nCall Number: RM931.A65 A62 2011\n\nGathering contributions from the leading experts in the HAI field, this state-of-the-art research volume is essential for anyone interested in the impact animals have on child development, whether through interaction with pets or through more formal interventions like therapeutic horseback riding or assistance dogs. Program administrators, researchers, and practitioners will explore the current evidence on how children with disabilities can benefit from animal therapies; how animals can strengthen empathy, trust, relationships, and other hallmarks of social competence; which key factors help ensure ethical HAI practices; and more.\n\nThe animal that therefore I am by Jacques Derrida\n\nCall Number: B2430.D483 A5513 2008 (electronic resource)\n\nThe book is at once an affectionate look back over the multiple roles played by animals in Derrida's work and a profound philosophical investigation and critique of the relegation of animal life that takes place as a result of the distinction-dating from Descartes-between man as thinking animal and every other living species. That starts with the very fact of the line of separation drawn between the human and the millions of other species that are reduced to a single the animal.Derrida finds that distinction, or versions of it, surfacing in thinkers as far apart as Descartes, Kant, Heidegger, Lacan, and Levinas, and he dedicates extended analyses to the question in the work of each of them.\n\nCreaturely Poetics: Animality and Vulnerability in literature and film by Anat Pick\n\nCall Number: PN56.A64 P53 2011\n\nSimone Weil once wrote that \"the vulnerability of precious things is beautiful because vulnerability is a mark of existence,\" establishing a relationship between vulnerability, beauty, and existence transcending the separation of species. Her conception of a radical ethics and aesthetics could be characterized as a new poetics of species, forcing a rethinking of the body's significance, both human and animal. Pick turns to literature, film, and other cultural texts, challenging the familiar inventory of the human: consciousness, language, morality, and dignity. In her poetics of the creaturely, powerlessness is the point at which aesthetic and ethical thinking must begin.\n\nCrossing boundaries: investigating human-animal relationships by Lynda Birke\n\nCall Number: QL85 .C76 2012\n\nMany people feel strong bonds with nonhuman animals, and these relationships are central to much emerging scholarship in human-animal studies. Yet to study relationships is not straightforward; research often focusses on how humans affect animals or vice versa rather than on the relationships themselves. Partly, this is a consequence of the history of disciplinary divisions, particularly between natural and social sciences. In this book, contributors from a wide range of disciplinary backgrounds reflect on the methodological challenges they face, and how they go about studying relationships between people and animals. The book provides fascinating insights into how research on human-animal relationships can rise to the challenges of interdisciplinarity, and help us to understand the animals with whom we bond.\n\nDeleuze and the Non/Human by Hannah Stark (Editor); Jonathan Roffe (Editor)\n\nCall Number: B2430.D454 D4575 2015\n\nDeleuze and the Non/Human brings together leading international voices to consider the place of the philosophy of Gilles Deleuze in the nonhuman turn.It examines recent debates about the figure of the nonhuman in fields such as new materialism, speculative realism, animal studies, and the environmental and ecological Humanities and scrutinizes the debt to Deleuze's work that is evident in these emerging fields. Deleuze's philosophy already anticipated many of the current debates about the non/human.\n\nEntangled Empathy: an alternative ethic for our relationships with animals by Lori Gruen\n\nCall Number: HV4708 .G779 2015\n\nIn Entangled Empathy, scholar and activist Lori Gruen argues that rather than focusing on animal \"rights,\" we ought to work to make our relationships with animals right by empathetically responding to their needs, interests, desires, vulnerabilities, hopes, and unique perspectives. Pointing out that we are already entangled in complex and life-altering relationships with other animals, Gruen guides readers through a new way of thinking about-and practicing-animal ethics.\n\nA Foray into the Worlds of Animals and Humans: with A Theory of Meaning by Jakob von Uexküll\n\nCall Number: QL751 .U413 2010 (electronic resource)\n\nA key document in the genealogy of posthumanist thought, A Foray into the Worlds of Animals and Humans advances Uexküll's revolutionary belief that nonhuman perceptions must be accounted for in any biology worth its name; it also contains his arguments against natural selection as an adequate explanation for the present orientation of a species' morphology and behavior. A Theory of Meaning extends his thinking on the umwelt, while also identifying an overarching and perceptible unity in nature. Those coming to Uexküll's work for the first time will find that his concept of the umwelt holds out new possibilities for the terms of animality, life, and the whole framework of biopolitics itself.\n\nHomeless Dogs and Melancholy Apes: Humans and Other Animals in the Modern Literary Imagination by Laura Brown\n\nCall Number: PR408.A55 B76 2010\n\nIn eighteenth-century England, the encounter between humans and other animals took a singular turn with the discovery of the great apes and the rise of bourgeois pet keeping. These historical changes created a new cultural and intellectual context for the understanding and representation of animal-kind, and the nonhuman animal has thus played a significant role in imaginative literature from that period to the present day. In Homeless Dogs and Melancholy Apes, Laura Brown shows how the literary works of the eighteenth century use animal-kind to bring abstract philosophical, ontological, and metaphysical questions into the realm of everyday experience, affording a uniquely flexible perspective on difference, hierarchy, intimacy, diversity, and transcendence.\n\nModern Animalism: Habitats of Scarcity and Wealth in Comics and Literature by Glenn Wilmott\n\nCall Number: PN56.P7 W54 2012\n\nModern Animalism explores representations of the human-animal ‘problem creature’ in a broad assortment of literature and comics from the late nineteenth century to the present — including authors such as Woolf, Joyce, Lawrence, Moore, Murakami, Pullman, Coetzee, and Atwood, and comics creators such as McCay, Herriman, Miyazaki, and Morrison. Drawing on a wide range of scholarship, from environmental economics to psychology, Glenn Willmott examines modern and post-modern allegories of the environment, the animal, and economics, highlighting the enduring and seductive appeal of the modern primitive in an age when living with less remains a powerful cultural wish.\n\nThe welfare of animals used in research: practice and ethics by Robert C. Hubrecht\n\nCall Number: R853.A53 H83 2014\n\nThe Welfare of Animals used in Research: Practice and Ethics gives a complete and balanced overview of the issues surrounding the use of animals in scientific research. The focus of the book is on the animal welfare implications and ethics of animals in research. It covers the topics with sufficient depth to show a real understanding of varied and complex subjects, but conveys the information in a beautifully reader-friendly manner.\n\nWhy the Wild Things Are: Animals in the Lives of Children by Gail F. Melson\n\nCall Number: Electronic resource\n\nWhether they see themselves as King of the Wild Things or protector of Toto, children live in a world filled with animals--both real and imaginary. From Black Beauty to Barney, animal characters romp through children's books, cartoons, videos, and computer games. As Gail Melson tells us, more than three-quarters of all children in America live with pets and are now more likely to grow up with a pet than with both parents. She explores not only the therapeutic power of pet-owning for children with emotional or physical handicaps but also the ways in which zoo and farm animals, and even certain purple television characters, become confidants or teachers for children--and sometimes, tragically, their victims.\n\nThe Animal Catalyst Towards a Human Theory by Patricia MacCormack\n\nCall Number: Electronically available\n\nThe Animal Catalyst deals with the 'question' of 'what is an animal' and also in some instances, 'what is a human'? It pushes the critical animal studies in important new directions; it re-examines its basic assumptions, suggests new paradigms for how we can live and function ecologically, in a world that is not simply \"ours.\" It argues that it is not enough to recognise the ethical demands placed upon us by our encounters with animals, or to critique our often murderous treatment of them: this simply reinforces human exceptionalism.\n\nBeing Animal: beasts and boundaries in nature ethics by Anna Peterson\n\nCall Number: HV4708 .P478 2013\n\nFor most people, animals are the most significant aspects of the nonhuman world. They symbolize nature in our imaginations, in popular media and culture, and in campaigns to preserve wilderness, yet scholars habitually treat animals and the environment as mutually exclusive objects of concern. Conducting the first examination of animals' place in popular and scholarly thinking about nature, Anna L. Peterson builds a nature ethic that conceives of nonhuman animals as active subjects who are simultaneously parts of both nature and human society.\n\nAnimal acts: performing species today by Una Chaudhuri\n\nCall Number: PN1590.A54 A55 2014\n\nWe all have an animal story--the pet we loved, the wild animal that captured our childhood imagination, the deer the neighbor hit while driving. While scientific breakthroughs in animal cognition, the effects of global climate change and dwindling animal habitats, and the exploding interdisciplinary field of animal studies have complicated things, such stories remain a part of how we tell the story of being human. Animal Acts collects eleven exciting, provocative, and moving stories by solo performers, accompanied by commentary that places the works in a broader context.\n\nDerrida and Our Animal Others: Derrida's Final Seminar, \"The Beast and the Sovereign\" by David Farrell Krell\n\nCall Number: Electronic Resource\n\nJacques Derrida's final seminars were devoted to animal life and political sovereignty--the connection being that animals slavishly adhere to the law while kings and gods tower above it and that this relationship reveals much about humanity in the West. David Farrell Krell offers a detailed account of these seminars, placing them in the context of Derrida's late work and his critique of Heidegger. Krell focuses his discussion on questions such as death, language, and animality. He concludes that Heidegger and Derrida share a commitment to finding new ways of speaking and thinking about human and animal life.\n\nCritical Animal and Media Studies: communication for nonhuman animal advocacy by Núria Almiron (Editor); Matthew Cole (Editor); Carrie P. Freeman (Editor); Núria Almiron (Editor)\n\nCall Number: Electronic resource\n\nThis book aims to put the speciesism debate and the treatment of non-human animals on the agenda of critical media studies and to put media studies on the agenda of animal ethics researchers. Contributors examine the convergence of media and animal ethics from theoretical, philosophical, discursive, social constructionist, and political economic perspectives. The book is divided into three sections: foundations, representation, and responsibility, outlining the different disciplinary approaches' application to media studies and covering how non-human animals, and the relationship between humans and non-humans, are represented by the mass media, concluding with suggestions for how the media, as a major producer of cultural norms and values related to non-human animals and how we treat them, might improve such representations.\n\nSuperheroes and Critical Animal Studies by Schatz Schatz EVANS; J. L. Schatz\n\nCall Number: Electronic resource\n\nSuperheroes and Critical Animal Studies explores and puts into dialogue two growing field of studies, comic studies and critical animal studies. The book's aim is to create a form of praxis that people can use to actualize many of the values superheroes strive to protect. To this end, contributor chapters are divided into sections on the foundation of superhero representation and how to teach it, criticisms of particular superheroes and how they fall short of truly protecting the planet, and interpretations of specific characters that can be read to produce a positive orientation to the nonhuman world and craft strategies to promote liberation in the real world. Altogether, the book produces a form of scholarship on the media that is both intersectional in scope and tailored to have an impact on the reader beyond theorizing superheroes for theorization's sake.\n\nThe Animal Inside by Michael Begun (Editor); Rudmer Bijlsma (Editor); Geoffrey Dierckxsens (Editor); Thomas Kiefer (Editor)\n\nCall Number: BD450 .A485 2017\n\nMuch has been written about animals in applied ethics, environmental ethics, and animal rights. This book takes a new turn, offering an examination of the 'animal question' from a more fundamental, philosophical-anthropological perspective. The contributors in this important volume focus on how the animal has appeared and can be used in philosophical argumentation as a metaphor or reference point that helps us understand what is distinctively human and what is not. A recurring theme in the essays is the existence of a zone of ambiguity between animals and humans, which puts into question comfortable assumptions about the uniqueness and superiority of human nature. While the chapters straddle the boundaries of historical-philosophical and systematic, continental and analytic approaches, their thematic unity knits them together, presenting a rich, broad, and yet cohesive perspective. The first part of the book offers general explorations of the relation between animal and human nature, and of the concomitant existential and ethical dimensions of this relationship. The chapters in the second part address the same theme, but, in so doing, focus on specific aspects of animal and human nature: imagination, politics, history, sense, finitude, and science."
