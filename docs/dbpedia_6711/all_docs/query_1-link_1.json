        "text": "If you’re ready to unplug and spend some downtime with a book, then check out the following list for a variety of powerful animal-rights reads that you won’t be able to put down:\n\nSurvival at Stake: How Our Treatment of Animals Is Key to Human Existence by Poorva Joshipura\n\nThis book, written by PETA U.K. Senior Vice President of International Affairs Poorva Joshipura, is essential reading for anyone hoping to change the world for the better. Survival at Stake explores some of the biggest crises facing the planet today, such as pandemics and the climate catastrophe, and how speciesism is linked to these issues. Order your copy now, and be sure to share it with a friend!\n\nFree the Animals: The Amazing True Story of the Animal Liberation Front in North America (30th Anniversary Edition) by Ingrid Newkirk\n\nFree the Animals tells the story of “Valerie,” a police officer in Maryland whose world is turned upside down when she learns about the abuse of animals in laboratories. What follows shows the various horrific ways in which humans use and abuse animals as well as ways in which we can intervene to end these practices. Written by PETA President Ingrid Newkirk, this timeless story captures the essence of the animal rights movement and has since inspired many to take action for animals. This 30th anniversary edition is revised and expanded and features a foreword by actor and activist Joaquin Phoenix, so be sure to order your copy today.\n\nHow to Be Animal: A New History of What It Means to Be Human by Melanie Challenger\n\nWhy do humans try so hard to deny the fact that we are animals? In this book, researcher Melanie Challenger explores why humans throughout history have sought to distance themselves from the label of “animal.” From philosophical, historical, and biological perspectives, she challenges (pun intended!) readers to think critically about being human. Challenger wants readers to “arrive at a more nourishing acceptance of our own reality,” i.e., that we cease to be so alarmed by the fact that we are animals ourselves. And from this acceptance, she hopes we can recognize our interconnectedness with a multispecies community.\n\nAnimalkind by Ingrid Newkirk and Gene Stone\n\nThis bestselling book by PETA President Ingrid Newkirk and acclaimed author Gene Stone gives you a peek into the fascinating lives of animals. It shows just how smart, aware, empathetic, and intelligent our fellow animals are with many examples, such as that geese fall in love and stay with a partner for life and that fish “sing” underwater. Expand your compassion for other animals and discover ways you can help protect them.\n\nThe PETA Practical Guide to Animal Rights by Ingrid E. Newkirk\n\nThe most comprehensive book on animal rights out today, The PETA Practical Guide to Animal Rights lists hundreds of easy ways to stop cruelty. Written by PETA President Ingrid Newkirk, it provides facts, personal insight, inspiration, ideas, and resources. It’s your go-to guide to making everyday compassionate choices.\n\nGive a Sh*t: Do Good. Live Better. Save the Planet. by Ashlee Piper\n\nThis gem of a read will help you make the transition to a kinder, healthier, and more sustainable existence. It gives helpful tips for living compassionately in all aspects of your life—consider it a tune-up for your home, kitchen, closet, makeup bag, and for when you’re out navigating the world. Ingrid Newkirk, the cofounder and president of PETA, says, “If everyone gave a shit, we’d have a far better world. This is Making Kind Choices for today’s audience, and I love it.”\n\nElephants Among Us: Two Performing Elephants in 20th Century America by M. Jaynes\n\nThis riveting new book tells the story of Stoney the elephant, who was dragged around for his entire life to perform at circuses, fairs, and hotels. The first half of the book chronicles his short life and tells an intricate story of the people who tried to save him. The second half weaves in the story of a second elephant named Big Mary, whose life also exemplified the way that animals are cruelly treated and abused within the entertainment industry.\n\nThe Animals’ Agenda: Freedom, Compassion, and Coexistence in the Human Age by Marc Bekoff and Jessica Pierce\n\nIf Peter Singer’s Animal Liberation is considered the “Bible” of animal rights philosophy, The Animals’ Agenda is this generation’s call for pragmatic action. Ethicists Marc Bekoff and Jessica Pierce make the argument that the current approach of animal-welfare science (while offsetting some of the worst aspects of animal suffering) falls far short of promoting true animal well-being and freedom.\n\nNext of Kin: My Conversations With Chimpanzees by Roger Fouts with Stephen Tukel Mills\n\nIn this fascinating page-turner, primatologist Roger Fouts recalls his 30-year career studying the language of chimpanzees. While training them to communicate through sign language, Fouts develops a deep connection with his subjects and evolves into an animal rights advocate who questions the morality of biomedical experiments on chimpanzees.\n\nEating Animals by Jonathan Safran Foer\n\nIf you prefer a personal touch to facts and figures, look no further than Foer’s memoir crossed with an investigative report titled Eating Animals. The bestselling author shares his extensive quest to learn who lies on his dinner plate: He investigates factory farms, discusses societal food norms, and digs deep emotionally to arrive at the answer.\n\nCommitted: A Rabble-Rouser’s Memoir by Dan Mathews\n\nIn this highly entertaining memoir, PETA’s own Dan Mathews shares his colorful adventures as a longtime animal rights activist. Whether dressed in a rabbit costume or his birthday suit, Mathews has advocated for animals all around the world. He’s living proof that controversy wins victories—and definitely earns laughs.\n\nMeat Is for Pussies: A How-To Guide for Dudes Who Want to Get Fit, Kick Ass, and Take Names by John Joseph\n\nThe “in-your-face” title says it all. Written by a punk rocker and Ironman triathlete who’s kicked the meat habit for 30 years, Meat Is for Pussies exposes hard-to-swallow food facts and doesn’t want to hear your excuses. A how-to guide that arms readers with steps to take charge of their diet like a man, this fast read is a great “dude’s” version of Skinny Bitch.\n\nEva by Peter Dickinson\n\nSearching for a present for pre-teens and teenagers who are beginning to consider animal rights on their own? Check out Eva, a spellbinding young adult science-fiction novel that follows a teenager whose consciousness is medically transplanted into the body of a chimpanzee after she’s paralyzed in an accident. After spending half her time in chimpanzee society, Eva plans to save the species from destruction.\n\nVeganist by Kathy Freston\n\nDon’t like to be lectured? Prefer a gradual introduction that’s kind, not shocking? Then Freston’s lifestyle guide is the perfect book for you. Veganist encourages readers to “lean into” a “veganist” lifestyle—one that is vegan in intention but less concerned with achieving hard and fast perfection. Instead, Freston persuades readers with high praise for the health, environmental, and spiritual benefits of a vegan diet.\n\nWhen Elephants Weep: The Emotional Lives of Animals by Jeffrey Moussaieff Masson and Susan McCarthy\n\nThis New York Times bestseller captured the country’s heart for a reason. Masson and McCarthy explore animal emotions with fascinating anecdotes and call on readers to reconsider the treatment of animals who can so clearly feel love, anger, shame, and fear. This thought-provoking read skillfully raises questions without forcing answers.\n\nLIFE Behind Bars Vol. 1 by Julian Starks\n\nThis limited-edition photographic study of the biodiversity of animals in captivity includes more than 100 photographs that are intended to inform and raise awareness of key issues.\n\nWe’re certain that cracking open one of these books will be the beginning of an all-out read-a-thon.\n\nMore of a movie person? Check out these animal rights–related films, most of which are available on Netflix.\n\nAs an Amazon Associate, PETA earns from qualifying purchases.
