Former small forward, 17-year veteran, and Portland Trail Blazers legend Jerome Kersey passed away Wednesday at the age of 52. He played 11 seasons for the Blazers, having his best in 1987-88 in which he averaged 19.2 points, 8.3 rebounds, 3.1 assists and 1.6 steals per game.

In honor of Kersey, Portland point guard Steve Blake will now wear the number 5 jersey, hanging up the number 25, which Kersey wore for the Blazers from 1984-85.

In a statement from the Trail Blazers, Blake spoke on the switch.

“Jerome Kersey meant a lot to this team and to this city. I’ve known Jerome for a long time now and wanted to honor him and his vast contributions both on and off the court. I consider it an honor to wear the number 25, but this just seemed like the right thing to do.”

Blake received permission to change his number, and will don the number 5 jersey for Portland’s Friday game against the Utah Jazz, which you can watch at 9 p.m. ET on CSNW.
