        "text": "Detroit Pistons vs. Los Angeles Lakers - Dec. 6, 2015\n\nDetroit Pistons guard Steve Blake (22) dribbles up the court in the fourth quarter of their NBA game against Los Angeles Lakers at the Palace of Auburn Hills in Auburn Hills, Sunday, December 6, 2015.\n\n(Mike Mulholland | MLive.com)\n\nAUBURN HILLS -- He was hired as a short-term fix, expected to fill the role left by a rehabbing Brandon Jennings.\n\nNow Steve Blake is being relied upon by the Detroit Pistons for heavy minutes at the backup point guard spot.\n\nPlaying his 13th NBA season, Blake, 36, is well respected by teammates, coaches and peers around the league. A ninth overall pick in the 2003 NBA draft out of Maryland, he's averaged 6.6 points and 4.0 assists per game.\n\nIn a recent interview with MLive, Blake talks about growing up a basketball fan, players he looked up to (spoiler alert: they're all guards), and plans for after basketball.\n\nMLive.com: You've played 13 years in the NBA now. Have you had any time to reflect?\n\nSteve Blake: Yeah. As players, we're always talking about our past experiences and kind of always reminiscing a little bit at some point. But not reflecting as far as I'm retired, this is all I've done -- just kind of remembering certain situations.\n\nMLive: Was this always a goal - professional basketball - when you were little?\n\nBlake: Yeah, that's pretty much -- it's what I've been doing since I was a little kid. I wouldn't say it was my goal from a very young age. My goal was to always, mostly, the next step ahead. Middle school, high school, when you get to high school, college. When you get to college, the pros. I never really looked way far ahead.\n\nMLive: Have any other careers in mind?\n\nBlake: I mean, those were my favorite professions. I loved cops and firemen, SWAT team stuff, when they come to your school and you see that. I loved the military. Besides that, basketball was always one path, to get where I'm at.\n\nMLive: Was there a moment where you distinctly remember the NBA was a possibility?\n\nBlake: That wasn't really until I was in college. Playing at Maryland, I remember having NBA talent on the team, and I fit in with them. And some NBA players would come back and play pickup with us sometimes. Playing on a couple USA teams. And finally realizing that I think I'm good enough -- and then it became my goal to get there.\n\nMLive: Have a favorite player growing up?\n\nBlake: Basketball-wise, I always enjoyed - when I was real young - Stockton, Marc Price, and as I got older, some of the other guys - (Steve) Nash and Jason Kidd, are probably the guys I watched in college.\n\nMLive: Have an all-time favorite moment in the league? Something that sticks out for you?\n\nBlake: I could think of some individual moments, but none that are like specific. None that are 'That's my moment type thing.'\n\nMLive: Youngest of four growing up?\n\nBlake: Yeah, I had three older sisters. It was awesome, but very challenging. When you think you have three older sisters, you think they're going to take it easy on you, but they don't. They probably made me tougher than I normally would have been. I'm thankful for that.\n\nMLive: When you're not on the court, what do you like to do?\n\nBlake: Away from the court, I'm a family man. My wife and I have been married for 10 years -- we have three kids, three boys: 9, 7 and 5. So when I leave the game, it's all about my family and how I can take care of them.\n\nMLive: So no hobbies?\n\nBlake: I love other sports. I get outdoors with the kids when I can, to play other sports. Particular hobbies, no, I'm pretty open to everything. I don't have anything set.\n\nMLive: Favorite NBA city?\n\nBlake: I like to go back to Miami. That's where I grew up, so I like to see some of my friends. Other than that, LA is awesome. There's a lot of good places to eat, the weather is always nice -- it's a good place to go.\n\nMLive: Any superstitions or pre-game rituals?\n\nBlake: I think if you talk to most guys, everyone has a routine. We work out on this time on the clock, I put my uniform on, I do this, I do that, but you kind of keep it routine. But I wouldn't call it superstitious -- I just try and get into the habit of pre-game routines.\n\nMLive: You were named vice president of the NBA Players Association in 2013. How did that come about?\n\nBlake: I've always stayed involved and knew what was going on. Just over time, going to meetings and things like that, I think they saw - I think other players saw that I was interested in it. Someone nominated me to be apart of it, and I was voted to be on the board.\n\nMLive: Any goals with it?\n\nBlake: I really did it for a couple reasons. I really wanted to have an honest, unbiased opinion on the things that we were discussing. I wanted to be someone who could look out for the body as a whole, and also for the experience. At the time I joined, we were looking to hire a new executive director, so I got to go through that whole experience of doing interviews and things like that. Mostly for big picture after basketball, that's what I want to do.\n\nMLive: What do you see yourself doing 5-10 years from now?\n\nBlake: Honestly, I still have no idea. I think initially I'll go home and I'll discuss things with my wife and kids. I'll stay involved in the game somehow, even if it's coaching my son's AAU team. Maybe get involved in high school basketball. Five to 10 years? Maybe I'll get back in the NBA, on the front office side or coaching. I just don't know yet.\n\nMLive: You were mentioned in the GM survey earlier season, as a potential future GM or coaching candidate ...\n\nBlake: That was cool to hear that, to know that people who are in a position of understanding the game think so highly of me. I'm very thankful for that.\n\nMLive: You've been here for a little more than half a season now. Has it been every thing you thought?\n\nBlake: Yeah, things have pretty much gone as expected. Coach Van Gundy and I, from the beginning, kind of discussed my role and how it would change. He was dead on about how things have gone. When there's a line of communication with your coach, it makes things a lot easier. He's always communicated with me well, and I've enjoyed living here, the staff has been great. Yeah, it's been another great experience with another NBA team.\n\nMLive: Last question. If you could be the NBA commissioner for a day, what would you change?\n\nBlake: That's a tough question. I don't have an answer for you. The game is in a great place right now -- it's still growing. The fan support is outstanding and I think the NBA side has done a great job of growing the game in unity with the players and the union."
