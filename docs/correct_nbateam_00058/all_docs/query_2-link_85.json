        "text": "When it comes to uniform numbers and the Portland Trail Blazers, it’s a rather complicated history.\n\nPerhaps no NBA franchise has retired numbers as quickly — or some would say imprudently — as the Blazers. Ten players have seen their number raised to the rafters in the franchise’s modest 50-year history, which has included one title and three trips to the NBA Finals.\n\nOnly Boston (23), Detroit (11) have retired more jerseys. The Lakers also have 10.\n\nPortland’s obsession with retiring numbers is a reflection of the relationship between this state and the Blazers. People in these parts like to think when a player puts on a Blazers jersey, he is embraced a little tighter, cheered a little louder and romanticized more dreamily than he would be in other NBA cities.\n\nSo while their Blazers might not be exceptional enough to be enshrined in Springfield, Mass., to those in Springfield, Ore., they were immortal as long as they played hard, played together and never gave up.\n\nSo perhaps that’s why, in 1979, Lloyd Neal and his No. 36 became the first number to be retired. Not star Bill Walton. Not co-star Maurice Lucas. No, it was Lloyd Neal, a backup on the NBA title team who forged his legacy through toughness and selflessness. He often played hurt — never more so than the title year when he played through the aches of a surgically repaired knee — and he often played out of position. When the oft-injured Walton was sidelined, the team would ask the 6-foot-7 Neal to defend centers such as Kareem Abdul-Jabbar and Bob Lanier, which he did with success.\n\nIn Portland, they didn’t just recognize the traits of players such as Neal, they celebrated them. Players like Neal stoked the feeling that the underdog could succeed, no matter the stakes. It had been that way pretty much since the beginning of the franchise. In 1970, when founder Harry Glickman was making his pitch to the NBA expansion committee, New York Knicks owner Ned Irish harrumphed at the notion of a small town in the wilderness joining the NBA, protesting to his fellow owners, “How can I put Portland on the marquee of Madison Square Garden?” Ever since, it seems Portland and the Blazers have operated with a chip on their shoulder and have not shied from trumpeting what most people would consider ordinary players.\n\nIt’s why the rafters in Portland include Larry Steele (No. 15), Dave Twardzik (No. 13) and Bob Gross (No. 30). And why many fans pine for Brandon Roy (No. 7) and Jerome Kersey (No. 25) to join them.\n\nOf the 10 numbers retired, seven are from the title team, not including No. 77 for coach Jack Ramsay. Some have suggested a more prudent tactic would be to include the entire title team with the No. 77 and honor players such as Walton and Lucas — who still resonate today — with their own retired numbers. That might make the rafters more prestigious, but it would be decidedly less Portland.\n\nAnd that brings us to the exercise at hand: Choosing the best player to wear each number in Blazers history. The criteria are decidedly Blazeresque in that only the players’ time in Portland matters. So while Jermaine O’Neal undoubtedly had the best career of any Blazer who wore No. 5, he was not chosen because almost the entirety of his standout résumé was achieved after he left Portland. Same with Rick Adelman, who is among Blazers royalty for his exceptional coaching tenure. But as a player, although decent, he was not the choice at No. 12.\n\nYou will find some oddities throughout the list. Nine players wore two numbers in their stints as Blazers, including Lionel Hollins, who wore Nos. 9 and 14. The 14 is retired. One player (Steve Blake) wore three numbers. Nine numbers (18, 26, 28, 29, 36, 48, 51, 83 and 88) have been worn by only one player. Two players (Pau Gasol and Festus Ezeli) never saw the court. The most difficult choices were at No. 3 (debate in talent), No. 5 (determining what matters) and No. 35 because … well, you’ll understand once you see the cast of characters from whom to choose.\n\nBecause of length, the numbers will be released in batches, starting with this Part 1, where we reveal No. 00 to No. 8.\n\nNo. 00 — Kevin Duckworth\n\nAlthough Carmelo Anthony is a sure-bet Hall of Famer, this was a no-brainer. Duckworth was a fixture at center during the franchise’s most sustained period of success (1986-1993) — a seven-year run when the Blazers averaged 53 wins and went to two NBA Finals. Among the best trade acquisitions in Portland history, Duckworth was a second-round pick by San Antonio and was traded to Portland in December of his rookie season for fellow rookie Walter Berry, who was the 14th overall pick. By the end of his second season in Portland, Duckworth was starting after Sam Bowie and Steve Johnson became injured, and when he raised his scoring average from 5.4 to 15.8, he was named the NBA’s Most Improved Player in the 1987-88 season. He later became a two-time All-Star (1989, 1991) and is part of Blazers lore for his emotional role in Game 7 of the 1990 conference semifinals against San Antonio. Duckworth had missed three weeks with a broken right hand, but 15 minutes before Game 7, he emerged from the locker room in uniform, with his hand wrapped. He received a two-minute standing ovation, and although he went 3-for-11 from the field, his presence was widely touted as a boost that helped the Blazers beat the Spurs.\n\nRunner-up: Enes Kanter.\n\nOthers: Carmelo Anthony, Ken Johnson.\n\nNo. 0 — Damian Lillard\n\nThis jersey was special from the moment Lillard joined the Blazers because of the thought he put into choosing his number. It’s not so much a number as it is a letter. The 0 stands for the three places that have shaped him — Oakland, his hometown; Ogden, Utah, where he went to school at Weber State; and Portland, Ore., where he has now played his entire eight-year NBA career.\n\nWhen discussion of the greatest Blazers player of all time comes up, it is usually a debate between Bill Walton (won the NBA title) and Clyde Drexler (all-time leader in nine categories and made two NBA Finals), but to many, Lillard has entered that debate. So it goes without saying that Lillard is not only the best 0 but also that no one in Portland will ever wear it again. Lillard holds the franchise record for points in a game (61), has hit two of the most memorable playoff shots in Portland history (2014 to eliminate Houston and 2019 to eliminate Oklahoma City) and is on pace to eclipse franchise leaders Drexler in points and Terry Porter in assists.\n\nHe’s a five-time All-Star, a four-time All-NBA selection, Rookie of the Year (2012-13) and winner of the J. Walter Kennedy Citizenship Award.\n\nBut the intangible that perhaps puts him atop the list of all-time Blazers greats is that his on-the-court success is mirrored by his commitment to and connection with fans off the court. He is among the most generous, thoughtful and involved stars the state has ever seen.\n\nRunner up: Voshon Lenard.\n\nOthers: Freddy Jones, Taurean Green.\n\nNo. 1 — Rod Strickland\n\nArguably the best free-agent signing in team history, Strickland arrived in July 1992 after spending his first two NBA seasons with the Knicks and Spurs. At first, he mostly backed up Terry Porter, although he did start 35 games in his first season in Portland and 58 in his second before succeeding Porter as the starter for his final two seasons. Strickland could get to the rim seemingly at will and was equally spectacular as a passer and as a finisher at the rim. His 20 assists in a game is the team record, and he did it twice — against Phoenix in 1994 and at Houston in 1996. His average of 9.6 assists in 1995-96 is the second-highest in team history, and he ranks fifth in team history in assists. He recorded two triple-doubles in Portland and was the headliner that enticed Washington to trade Rasheed Wallace to the Blazers in July 1996.\n\nRunner up: Derek Anderson.\n\nOthers: Jarrett Jack, Ike Diogu, Armon Johnson, Shawne Williams, Jared Jeffries, Dorell Wright, Evan Turner, Anfernee Simons.\n\nNo. 2 — Wesley Matthews\n\nMatthews was undrafted and never forgot about it, playing with a fire to prove people wrong after the Blazers signed him in 2010 as a free agent after his rookie season in Utah. He became a fan favorite and a team leader, standing out one game with his hustle and the next with his prolific 3-point shooting. He was gritty on the court and unafraid to confront teammates in the locker room. He helped Portland win its first playoff series in 14 years by playing disruptive defense against James Harden, which contributed to the Rockets star shooting 8-for-28, 6-of-19, 13-of-35, 9-of-21 and 5-of-15 before a Game 6 game when he hit 9-of-15 shots.\n\nMatthews became known as Iron Man for his ability to play through injury, but it was an Achilles injury in March 2015 that ended his season and his tenure in Portland, and it derailed a talented Blazers team that at the time had the West’s third-best record. Without his defense, shooting and leadership, the Blazers fell to fifth and were rolled in the first round by Memphis. When Matthews left, he was the team’s leader in 3-pointers made, and he did it while shooting 39.4 percent.\n\nRunner-up: Steve Blake.\n\nOthers: Linton Townes, Perry Young, Mark Bryant, Stacey Augmon, Steve Blake, Dan Dickau, Brian Roberts, Wade Baldwin IV, Gary Trent Jr.\n\nNo. 3 — Cliff Robinson\n\nBy far the toughest and most talented group from which to pick a winner. It came down to Robinson, Damon Stoudamire and CJ McCollum (and Gerald Wallace wasn’t half-bad, either). I went with Robinson because he has one of the most complete résumés of any Blazers player, not just those who wore No. 3.\n\nRobinson was an All-Star (1994). Won the Sixth Man Award (1992-93). Was a key player on teams that went to two NBA Finals (1990, 1992). And in franchise history, he ranks fourth in scoring, second in blocks, sixth in steals, 10th in rebounds and fifth in games played. He led the Blazers in scoring for four consecutive seasons and played in a remarkable 461 consecutive games. The closest anyone has come to that consistency is Lillard, who once played in 275 consecutive games. And to think, Robinson was a second-round pick (36th overall) in the 1989 draft out of Connecticut.\n\nThe pick of Robinson came after some deliberation. Stoudamire held the franchise record for points in a game (54) for 12 seasons before Lillard broke it, and he steered the Blazers to back-to-back appearances in the Western Conference finals. McCollum, meanwhile, scored 50 in three quarters against Chicago in 2018 and had a memorable 37-point performance in Game 7 at Denver to push the Blazers into the 2019 Western Conference finals. His 37 points is a team record for a Game 7.\n\nBut in the end, Uncle Cliffy’s body of work was too deep, too impressive. He is number one at No. 3.\n\nRunner-up: Damon Stoudamire.\n\nOthers: Herm Gilliam, Jeff Lamp, Juan Dixon, Jeremy Richardson, Gerald Wallace, Jonny Flynn, Sasha Pavlovic, CJ McCollum.\n\nNo. 4 — Jim Paxson\n\nA great storyteller, Paxson is one of my favorite ex-Blazers. And he also happens to be one of the best who played here, and easily the best to wear No. 4.\n\nOne story that stuck with me came from his rookie season, 1980. He was highly touted, the 12th overall pick out of Dayton, but that first season he was struggling with his confidence while he adjusted to the NBA game. As the Blazers came out of the All-Star break, they were on their own to get to Kansas City for their first game after the break, against the Kings. When Paxson arrived in Kansas City, he ran into coach Jack Ramsay in the airport and the two shared a cab to the team hotel. It was during that cab ride that the legendary coach gave Paxson a heads-up: The Blazers were about to sign off on a trade that would send disgruntled star Maurice Lucas to New Jersey. But this was more than the unusual practice of a coach giving a rookie insider information. This was a master coach working the mind of a youngster. See, in the course of telling Paxson that Lucas was about to be shipped out, Ramsay told Paxson that the Nets really pushed for Paxson to be included in the deal, but Ramsay fought hard with management to keep the rookie. It was Ramsay’s way of telling, and showing, Paxson that he believed in him.\n\n“You know, I’ve always been a believer that you are only as good as your coach thinks you are,” Paxson told me. “And that really gave me a big boost.”\n\nSure enough, Lucas was traded three days later to New Jersey, along with two first-round picks (the picks ended up being Mike Gminski and Albert King) in return for Calvin Natt. On the same night the trade was completed, Paxson scored 21 points in San Diego and one of the best Blazers careers was off and running.\n\nPaxson, a 6-foot-6 shooting guard, was a two-time All-Star (1983, 1984) and was second-team All-NBA in 1983-84, behind first-team guards Magic Johnson and Isiah Thomas. He joined second-team stars Sidney Moncrief, Julius Erving, Moses Malone and Adrian Dantley. When Paxson was traded in February 1988 to Boston, he was the Blazers’ career leader in points. (Interesting side note: Paxson was actually traded in June 1987 to Cleveland for Keith Lee, but the trade was canceled in August when Lee failed his physical.) Today, Paxson ranks seventh in scoring, seventh in assists and fourth in steals and field goals.\n\nRunner-up: Maurice Harkless.\n\nOthers: Greg Smith, Dave Johnson, Marcus Brown, Carlos Rogers, Antonio Harvey, Eddie Gill, Maurice Baker, Geno Carlisle, Josh McRoberts, Jerryd Bayless, Sean Marks, Nolan Smith, Arron Afflalo, Moses Brown.\n\nNo. 5 — Rodney Hood\n\nThis is probably the most controversial or debatable call on the list, but there is no arguing this: Among those who have worn No. 5, only Hood has made a shot that will live forever in the great moments of this franchise.\n\nJermaine O’Neal showed enormous potential wearing No. 5 for Portland, but it wasn’t until he donned No. 7 for Indiana that he became a star. Rudy Fernandez played in more games and had some exciting moments, but he never elevated to memorable. Steve Blake was a solid player, the only player to have three tours with Portland and the only one to wear three numbers (2, 5, 25). But he wore No. 5 for only the final 27 games of the 2014-15 season. He started that season wearing No. 25, but in February, Jerome Kersey — a beloved and hailed Blazer who wore No. 25 in the team’s glory years — suddenly passed away. Blake asked the NBA for permission to change his number from 25 to 5 to honor Kersey. The request was granted.\n\nThis is all a long-winded way to say even though Hood has appeared in only 47 games over two seasons in Portland, he gets the nod as the best to wear No. 5 because he has a signature moment, something that will be replayed over and over throughout the years.\n\nThe scene was Game 3 of the 2019 Western Conference semifinals. At home, against Denver, the series tied 1-1 and the game entering the fourth overtime, the first four-overtime playoff game in the NBA since 1953. Hood sat the final 7:31 of the fourth quarter. He played 31 seconds of the first overtime. He did not play in the second overtime. Or the third. And in the fourth overtime, it wasn’t until 1:59 was left, when starting power forward Maurice Harkless started cramping, that coach Terry Stotts nodded for Hood to go in, the Blazers trailing 133-131.\n\nBy all three accounts, while he sat on the bench throughout the tension-filled game, Hood told rookies Gary Trent Jr. and Anfernee Simons that if he ever returned to the game, he was going to win it.\n\nSo when the calves of Harkless went from flank steak to meatballs, Hood came in, knowing full well what he said on the bench earlier. And if the people in Cleveland were tuned in, they wouldn’t have believed the confident Hood they were watching. See, Hood didn’t have the most sterling of reputations when he came to Portland. In Cleveland, LeBron James and Co. acquired Hood in a trade from Utah to make another run at the NBA Finals. Hood, however, struggled to gain a feel for how he should play alongside The King. He deferred more than he wanted, and probably more than he should have, and it turned into a paralyzing battle of being himself but also making sure the game’s best player was flourishing. By the playoffs, Hood was benched, and he was never more unhappy in basketball.\n\nThe next February, he was traded to Portland and everything changed. He immediately felt at ease around the team, and he connected with players like Evan Turner, Al-Farouq Aminu and Harkless. As he put it, he fell in love with basketball all over again.\n\nThere was one moment, three weeks after he was traded to Portland, that stood out to some teammates. The team was in Boston, and nine players — including Hood — became stuck in an elevator at Emerson College, where the team practiced. Crammed shoulder-to-shoulder, the players waited 30 minutes for it to be repaired. Turner, who knew Hood had battled anxiety throughout his career, took special notice of Hood, who was at ease and smiling during the ordeal.\n\n“I knew then that Rodney was comfortable with us,” Turner said.\n\nSo that brings us back to that moment in the fourth overtime: Blazers trailing by two, Harkless limping off, Hood shaking his arms and legs to awaken his joints after sitting on the sideline for all but 31 seconds of the previous 25 minutes of game time.\n\nAnd then it happened. The combination of happiness, being comfortable and living up to a moment came together. Hood hit a 14-foot jumper with 1:07 left to tie the score. Then he made a 12-footer with 44 seconds left to give Portland a one-point lead. Then, with the Blazers trailing by one, CJ McCollum missed a jumper, then in one motion got the rebound and passed out to Hood on the wing. No hesitation, no stress, no doubt. Hood swished the 3-pointer with 18 seconds left, the Blazers won a game, and Hood etched his name, and number, in Blazers history.\n\nRunner-up: Rudy Fernandez.\n\nOthers: Jim McMillan, Eddie Jordan, Jermaine O’Neal, Jeff McInnis, Desmond Ferguson, Ha Seung-Jin, Ime Udoka, Raymond Felton, Will Barton, Steve Blake, Pat Connaughton.\n\nNo. 6 — Bonzi Wells\n\nTwo facts explain why Wells was the easy choice: In his third NBA season, he was talented enough to unseat Olympian Steve Smith as the Blazers’ starting shooting guard. And in his fifth NBA season, Wells scored 45 points at Dallas in a playoff game, which at the time was a franchise record for the postseason.\n\nHe was confrontational, crude and caustic, but when Wells was focused, he was an incredible talent. For a shooting guard, he was a bully. Listed at 6-foot-5, 210, Wells used his backside to punish smaller defenders in the post, where his turnaround from the baseline was his bread and butter. He could dominate on the boards, like in 2000 when he put up 28 points and 14 rebounds at Detroit, then two games later went for 22 and 10 at Miami. He shot a knuckleball that looked awkward until it swished, and his quick hands and great anticipation led to 123 steals in 2002-03, which no Blazer has come close to reaching since.\n\nWells’ impact also gets overlooked in the infamous crash at the end of the 2000-01 season, when the Blazers led the West on March 6, only to finish seventh and get swept in the playoffs. The demise is often credited to Rasheed Wallace’s volatility and Shawn Kemp’s entering drug rehabilitation, but the real dagger was when Wells tore his ACL at Golden State 11 days before the season ended.\n\nRunner-up: Juwan Howard.\n\nOthers: Michael Holton, Walter Davis, Joe Wolf, Mitchell Butler, Eric Maynor, Shabazz Napier, Nik Stauskas, Jaylen Hoard.\n\nNo. 7 — Brandon Roy\n\nAll you need to know about Brandon Roy and the No. 7 in Portland was revealed on a loading dock in New Orleans this season. It was the night Carmelo Anthony was set to make his Portland debut, and it had recently been revealed that Anthony would wear No. 00 for the Blazers after wearing No. 7 for his past eight and a half seasons in New York, Oklahoma City and Houston. I had yet to interview Anthony and was curious why he changed numbers and whether it was related to the legacy of Roy.\n\nI got my answer as I was entering the arena, when I happened upon Blazers equipment manager Eric Hallman, who handles assigning numbers to players. I asked if No. 7 was made available for Anthony to choose.\n\n“No,” Hallman said. “We don’t offer that number.”\n\nThe franchise has made no mention, at least publicly, that it is considering retiring No. 7, and an email to team president Chris McGowan this week went unanswered. But not making it available to other players is at the very least notable. Since Roy left the Blazers in 2011, the No. 7 has been broached twice. Coby Karl wore it in the 2012 preseason before being cut, and Mo Williams in 2013 created a stir when he chose No. 7 after signing as a free agent. But before the season started, a musical chairs of sorts transpired: Williams went from 7 to 25 and Earl Watson vacated 25 and went to 17.\n\nWhether the Blazers retire Roy’s number doesn’t diminish his impact over his five seasons (2006-2011). He was the Rookie of the Year (2006-07), a three-time All-Star (2008, 2009, 2010), two-time All-NBA (2008-09, 2009-10) and shares the franchise record for steals in a game (10) with Clyde Drexler and Larry Steele. He also engineered some memorable playoff moments, such as his electric fourth quarter against Dallas in 2011 and returning eight days after knee surgery to play against Phoenix in 2008. But more than anything, Roy’s legacy will be guiding a franchise struggling with player misconduct and poor play and reconnecting them it a fan base that had soured.\n\nRunner-up: Kenny Anderson.\n\nOthers: Hank McDowell, Brooke Steppe, Kenny Anderson, Charles Smith, Wesley Person, Dan Dickau.\n\nNo. 8 — Steve Smith\n\nOne of 11 Blazers players who have won a gold medal (2000), Smith was the second-leading scorer behind Rasheed Wallace on the Western Conference finals team of 1999-2000, and the following season, when he lost his starting job to Bonzi Wells. He was a pro’s pro — a crafty scorer who had a bag of tricks to draw fouls and frustrate defenders — and he was particularly leaned on in crucial moments of games.\n\nIn the epic seven-game Western Conference finals, he helped forced Game 7 by scoring a team-high 26 points on 10-of-18 shooting and in Game 7 was the only Blazers player to play the entire fateful fourth quarter. He opened that fourth quarter with a midrange jumper, pushing the Blazers’ lead to 73-58, but he would miss his next four shots, as part of the Blazers’ spectacular unraveling.\n\nRunner-up: Al-Farouq Aminu.\n\nOthers: Charles Jones, Ennis Whatley, Martell Webster, Patrick Mills, Luke Babbitt, Trevor Ariza.\n\n(Photo: Rocky Widner / NBAE via Getty Images)"
