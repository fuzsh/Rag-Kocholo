        "text": "Clive Rose/Getty Images\n\nThe Los Angeles Lakers are expecting big things from their new back-up point guard, Steve Blake, but is he ready to step up to the challenge of leading the Lakers' second unit?\n\nIt's no secret that point guard defense has been one of the Lakers' biggest weaknesses the past two seasons and many people see Blake as the answer to that question.\n\nThere is even some hope that Blake will eventually replace veteran point guard Derek Fisher in the Lakers' backcourt, but has Blake ever proven in his career that he is ready for that responsibility?\n\nBlake has averaged 7.5 points, 4.3 assists, shot 41 percent from the field and 39 percent from the three-point line for his career.\n\nThose are decent numbers, but they don't exactly instill a large measure of confidence in Blake as the Lakers' lead guard either.\n\nHowever, Blake's ability to score is not what made him the Lakers' number one priority during the free agency signing period, at least in the eyes of general manager Mitch Kupchak.\n\nBlake has good size at 6'3 and he has a reputation as a steady, if not spectacular, defensive player. Blake is also an above average ball-handler, who seems to have quickly grasped the intricacies of the triangle offense.\n\nThe triangle lessens the need for a true point guard, since any player is capable of playing the part of distributor. Even though Blake fits the mold of a true point guard, his outside shot will be more valuable than his distribution skills.\n\nBlake's career three-point percentage of 39, was better than anyone else on the Lakers' roster last year. If he can shoot with accuracy from distance, then he will add a different element to the team.\n\nRon Artest, Jordan Farmar, Shannon Brown, Derek Fisher and even Kobe Bryant had their moments from behind the arc last season, but Blake has the potential to do it on a consistent basis.\n\nBlake is often credited with his spirited defensive performances against Bryant while he was a member of the Portland Trail Blazers, but will that translate to stellar defense against point guards who have hurt the Lakers in the past?\n\nBlake has the size to defend the bigger point guards in the Western Conference, but he lacks the foot speed to stay in front of quicker guards, such as Oklahoma City's Russell Westbrook and Houston's Aaron Brooks.\n\nBut, even though opposing guards are capable of hurting the Lakers on the perimeter, there are few, if any, who possess the talent to single-handedly beat the team.\n\nIn order for an opposing point guard to truly hurt the Lakers, another player must also inflict similar damage on the offensive end, which is a tall task considering the Lakers are one of the NBA's top defensive units.\n\nBlake's last two preseason games against the Utah Jazz are perhaps the clearest illustrations of best-case/worst-case scenarios, when it comes to his performance as a reserve guard.\n\nIn the first game against the Jazz, Blake played 19 minutes, while scoring no points and going 0-7 from the floor, including 0-4 from three point range.\n\nThe next game Blake seemed to be much more involved and he tallied 10 points in 22 minutes, while going 4-7 from the floor and 2-3 from three point range.\n\nHopefully, the majority of Blake's games in the regular season will resemble his second effort because his consistency, steady hand and outside jump shot will be critical, if the Lakers hope to repeat.\n\nBlake may never wrest the starting position away from Fisher regardless of how well he plays, since Fisher has earned the trust of coach Phil Jackson and it's hard to envision Blake eclipsing that.\n\nTherefore, Blake may never be able to live up to the hype over his free agency signing, but if he is able to perform in the manner the Lakers hope he can, that sentiment may only be a matter of perception."
