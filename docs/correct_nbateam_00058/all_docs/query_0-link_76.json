        "text": "Former small forward, 17-year veteran, and Portland Trail Blazers legend Jerome Kersey passed away Wednesday at the age of 52. He played 11 seasons for the Blazers, having his best in 1987-88 in which he averaged 19.2 points, 8.3 rebounds, 3.1 assists and 1.6 steals per game.\n\nIn honor of Kersey, Portland point guard Steve Blake will now wear the number 5 jersey, hanging up the number 25, which Kersey wore for the Blazers from 1984-85.\n\nIn a statement from the Trail Blazers, Blake spoke on the switch.\n\n“Jerome Kersey meant a lot to this team and to this city. I’ve known Jerome for a long time now and wanted to honor him and his vast contributions both on and off the court. I consider it an honor to wear the number 25, but this just seemed like the right thing to do.”\n\nBlake received permission to change his number, and will don the number 5 jersey for Portland’s Friday game against the Utah Jazz, which you can watch at 9 p.m. ET on CSNW."
