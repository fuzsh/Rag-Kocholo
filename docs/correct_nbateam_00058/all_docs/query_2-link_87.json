        "text": "steve-blake.jpg\n\nSteve Blake is headed to the Pistons.\n\n(OregonLive.com)\n\nThe Detroit Pistons have acquired veteran point guard Steve Blake in a trade with the Brooklyn Nets, who received Quincy Miller in return, the Pistons confirmed Monday evening.\n\nBlake's contract could fit the Pistons' $2.8 million room exception for cap purposes since the deal was finalized before Reggie Jackson signs his five-year, $80 million contract. Blake is scheduled to make $2.1 million this season, the final year of his contract.\n\nBlake gives the Pistons a fourth point guard and veteran insurance against the possibility that Brandon Jennings may not be healthy to begin the season. Jennings suffered a torn Achilles on Jan. 24, after which the Pistons traded to acquire Jackson. Spencer Dinwiddie is the fourth point guard.\n\nBlake, 35, enters his 13th NBA season and the Pistons will be his eighth team. He has played 812 regular-season and 49 playoff games. He was a star collegian at the University of Maryland, which he led to a 2002 NCAA championship.\n\nHe has averaged 6.7 points, 4.0 assists and 1.4 turnovers, and been a consistent 3-point threat during his career.\n\nBlake ranks in the NBA's all-time top 100 among qualifying players in 3-pointers made (985, 82nd), attempted (2,558, 96th), and percentage (38.5, 71st).\n\nBlake played 81 games last season for the Portland Trail Blazers -- his third stint with the team -- who traded him to Brooklyn on June 25, the night of the NBA draft, along with Rondae Hollis-Jefferson, for Mason Plumlee and Pat Connaughton.\n\nHe also has played for the Washington Wizards, Milwaukee Bucks, Denver Nuggets, Los Angeles Clippers, Los Angeles Lakers and Golden State Warriors.\n\nMiller, 22, is on a non-guaranteed $981,000 contract with the Pistons which allows him to be released by July 15 for $50,000. The Nets likely will release Miller, though they could bring him to camp and release him by Nov. 15 for only another $50,000 commitment.\n\nMiller was called up by the Pistons from the NBA Development League's Reno Bighorns last year. He played 58 minutes in four late-season games."
