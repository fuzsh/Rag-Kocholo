        "text": "NBA rosters are fluid by nature, but the Damian Lillard experience went way beyond the norm.\n\nBy the time the Portland Trail Blazers point guard laced up for the start of the 2015-16 season, four of the five starters with whom he’d won 51 games during the previous regular season were gone. Small forward Nicolas Batum had been traded to the Charlotte Hornets in late June, and free agents LaMarcus Aldridge (San Antonio Spurs), Wesley Matthews (Dallas Mavericks) and Robin Lopez (New York Knicks) followed soon thereafter.\n\nThe ripple effect, one that is much easier to deal with because these new-look Blazers are playing so well, is a reunion game schedule that never seems to stop.\n\n“It has been kind of different, because it seems like each team we go to there’s a guy I used to play with,” Lillard, who is sixth in the league in scoring at 24.3 points per game to go with his team-leading seven assists per, told USA TODAY Sports recently. “We go to San Antonio, and then New York comes to us and then Dallas comes to us and then we go to Charlotte. We just went to Brooklyn (Nets forward Thomas Robinson played in Portland the past two seasons, but was traded to Philadelphia in February and signed with the Nets in July), Detroit comes to us (veteran point guard Steve Blake played for Portland last season).\n\n“When you look at it, it’s like, ‘Man, he was on our team last year. He was on our team last year.’ And then you look around, and it’s like, ‘Man, we’ve got a completely new roster. It’s been fun to be a part of this group, though. I really appreciate the vibe that we have every day, the kind of guys that we have, and the fact that we put ourselves in a position to make the playoffs.”\n\nThe Blazers are currently eight in the Western Conference, 1 ½ games back from the seventh-seeded Houston Rockets. They haven’t fared well against the new teams of their former starters, as they lost to San Antonio, New York and Dallas before beating Charlotte late last week. The next game on this unique tour on March 1 at the Knicks, followed by a March 17 game at San Antonio, and back-to-back meetings with Dallas (at the Mavericks on March 20, at home on March 23) to end that stretch.\n\n“I say hello to the guys before the game … see how they’re doing and how they like their new situation,” Lillard said. “And then it’s time to play. The offseason is for us to catch up and get much deeper into the discussion, but at the time, usually before a game, I’ll say ‘What’s up?’ and all of that but I’ve never been the guy to have a whole, whole lot of interaction with anybody before a game.”\n\nThe one guy who he certainly wishes were still around is Aldridge, the five-time All-Star who is believed to have left in large part because Lillard’s shadow had grown too large.\n\n“I really don’t (understand why Aldridge left),” Lillard said. “I don’t understand, but I look back on it and I see, you see what people say, and you see comments, and I’ve always been able to see things for what they are. I think LA (Aldridge) was at the point in his career where he wanted to win a championship. He was a fan of what the Spurs organization was about, and it seemed like that’s something he was willing to do.\n\n“I would have loved nothing more than to have him back, to have another All-Star on the team was good for me. I was happy with it. I reached out to him a bunch of times (before and during free agency), but I think he had got to the point where he thought maybe the organization was choosing me over him. And to this day, I still tell people that it’s not my team, it’s (owner) Paul Allen’s team, and I was willing to be the best complement I could to LaMarcus Aldridge. I expressed that to him multiple times, but I think it just came down to him being ready to move on to a new situation.”\n\nMeanwhile, the ones left behind are better than expected so far."
