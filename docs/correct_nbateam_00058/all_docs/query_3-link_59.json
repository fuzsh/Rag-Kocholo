        "text": "Editor’s note: Andy Kamenetzky is recounting memories and observations of Lakers players he has covered over the years. He began with Von Wafer and Kwame Brown.\n\nOne of the simultaneously exciting and frustrating parts of roster construction is never knowing exactly how the pieces will fit. On paper, harmonious skill sets and personalities are easily identified, but even the greatest basketball minds make mistakes. There are too many variables and human elements to know exactly how an upcoming game will unfold, much less the entire season. Unpredictability is what makes sports compelling, but by definition, guessing games include wrong ones, whether by front offices making deals, superstars pushing for certain teammates or media types making prognostications like me.\n\nWhen the Lakers signed Steve Blake in the summer of 2010, I thought the point guard was a perfect fit for Phil Jackson, the triangle offense and the upcoming three-peat quest. More of a luxury backup than an ideal starter, he nonetheless ran offenses quite capably. Per 36 minutes, Blake averaged six assists for his career and, against just 2.1 turnovers, he took great care of the ball. But just as importantly in Jackson’s system, Blake was proficient off the ball and spotting up. In four previous seasons, he shot 39 percent or higher from behind the arc and only once connected below 37 percent.\n\nPlus, he was a feisty pest, which was ideal for a group that won consecutive championships with a defensive mindset. In theory, Blake was a younger (maybe even better) version of Derek Fisher. At worst, he simply represented an upgrade over Jordan Farmar, whose game never meshed with the triangle. Plus, Blake joined a bench unit with Shannon Brown and Matt Barnes, and their “Killer B’s” nickname was fun. I felt very confident about a smooth transition.\n\nI was wrong.\n\nFor reasons that never quite made sense, Blake spent his lone season under Jackson ill at ease. Perhaps it was the byproduct of playing catchup in a new system with new teammates, the majority of whom enjoyed a shorthand after several years together. Or it could’ve been the team-wide malaise, including Jackson’s growing disconnect to the players. Or maybe it was the “on paper” fit simply not jelling with reality.\n\nWhatever the case, Blake’s production and aggressiveness cratered: Four points per game, 35.9 percent shooting from the field, a reluctance to even put up shots. He averaged just seven field goal attempts per 36 minutes, easily the lowest of any rotation player. (It was also a career low for any full season with the same team.)\n\nBlake had never been a shot hunter, but he seemed uncomfortable with the prospect of actually shooting. That reticence is well illustrated by a nice assist percentage (15.0, barely behind Pau Gasol and Lamar Odom) juxtaposed against a usage rate of just 11.3, besting only Theo Ratliff, who played a grand total of 71 minutes. In other words, unless he was specifically setting up a basket, Blake was mostly just getting rid of the ball, and those hot-potato instincts made him an offensive afterthought.\n\nI didn’t see this coming, and I imagine the Lakers were equally surprised.\n\nBlake eventually played much better when Mike D’Antoni arrived (as guards typically do), and he’s hardly the first player to ever endure a down year. But it’s still strange that Blake regressed so dramatically under Jackson. Timing is everything, and Blake might have succeeded if he arrived two years earlier. Perhaps he just needed more time to get acclimated. Or maybe his fit was was just incorrectly projected. Whatever the case, Blake’s first season with the Lakers has always reminded me why the NBA remains largely difficult to forecast. That’s ultimately for the best, even with the potential ramifications.\n\nA few more memories of Blake’s Lakers stint.\n\n1. Kobe Bryant was a huge Steve Blake fan. Huge. He bestowed several nicknames upon the guard, including “Vino Bianco,” “Temper,” “Problem Child,” “8 Mile,” “B Rabbit,” and “Lil’ Feisty.” When Blake was traded to the Warriors in a 2014 deadline deal, Bryant expressed his displeasure on Twitter. Were I to peg the biggest reason Kobe appreciated Blake, it would be his toughness. He was a tough (or as Bryant put it, “psycho”) competitor but also tough in the most literal sense. Despite a slight frame and relative lack of size, Blake developed a league-wide reputation for “No. Really. He will fight you.” Ask Kenneth Faried. Or Jason Terry. Or Maryland teammate John Gilchrist. Blake, who was MMA-trained, was absolutely unafraid of confrontation.\n\nWith that in mind, consider how after missing a game-winner in the 2012 Western Conference semifinals, Blake and his family received death threats from fans over social media. Beyond the awfulness of this behavior and the utter lack of perspective and humanity, from a purely pragmatic standpoint, this was among the last players you would want to test by getting personal. He didn’t seek out fights, but Blake was nonetheless quite capable of beating the crap out of your average Twitter egg. Those idiots were extremely fortunate to have never encountered him after crossing this line.\n\n2. Throughout his Laker tenure, Blake constantly battled injuries, a couple of which were memorably weird. During the 2012 offseason, he suffered a foot puncture after stepping on a parking lot spike strip. Often with professional athletes, a “nothing good ever happens after 2 a.m.” lesson emerges to explain such a bizarre event. Here, not so much. Blake apparently managed to do this while clearheaded, which made it even stranger.\n\nBlake also caught the chicken pox in 2011, as random as sicknesses get for NBA players who aren’t nine years old. And given his legendary ability to play through anything, I used to joke that Kobe must have been pissed Blake ended up the one battling chicken pox instead of him. No disrespect, but let’s be real: This ailment was wasted on a role player. Ain’t nobody tuning in to see Steve Blake’s “chicken pox game.” But everybody would watch The Mamba’s, dammit! C’mon, now! As such, I kept expecting to hear stories of Bryant storming Blake’s house demanding to get breathed on.\n\n3. Blake was quite nice, but he was never the chattiest fellow. While cooperative with the media, his desire to conclude interviews ASAP was always palpable. Still, even with that caveat, his 2011 exit interview was hilariously non-verbal. The whole thing lasted less than three minutes, including several seconds of uneasy silence before the Q&A kinda petered out. For a player of Blake’s stature, that’s an exceptionally fast session. I mean, Devin Ebanks talked for six minutes and didn’t even average six minutes per game! Yet after only a couple minutes, without being rude about it, Blake basically willed the room into becoming too self-conscious for followup questions.\n\nAs a huge fan of awkward comedy, I found this quite amusing.\n\n(Photo: Noah Graham / NBAE via Getty Images)"
