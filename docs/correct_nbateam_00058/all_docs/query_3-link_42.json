One day while reading the LA Lakers media guide I was surprised to read that he had Coach Gabe Corchiani listed as his high school coach.He never really played for Gabe.Steve’s father was a golf pro and he would give Gabe  Sr. golf lessons in return Gabe would train Steve Blake. Gabe Sr is a great example of a father who worked hard with his son’s to make them into stars on the basketball court and he also helped Steve Blake become a better player and play in the NBA. Chris Corchiani at barely 6 feet tall played for three different NBA teams. Gabe Jr a star at U. of New Orleans.The Corchiani family a great basketball family. More than that nice people. Gabe passed a few months after retiring from the DCPS system. A good friend.\".",
