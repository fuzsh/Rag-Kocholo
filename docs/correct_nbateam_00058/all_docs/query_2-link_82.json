        "text": "Canadian Jamaal Magloire is headed west.\n\nThe Milwaukee Bucks traded the centre to the Portland Trail Blazers for guard Steve Blake, forward Brian Skinner and centre Ha Seung-Jin on Monday.\n\nMagloire, 28, averaged 9.2 points and a team-high 9.5 rebounds for Milwaukee last season. Magloire, a Toronto native, was the only player on the team to start in all 82 games.\n\nHe was seventh in the NBA in total rebounds (778) and 10th in rebounds per game.\n\nBucks general manager Larry Harris said the transaction allowed his team to add depth to the frontcourt and backcourt.\n\nBlake, 26, played in 68 games for Portland last season and averaged 8.2 points per game, a career high. He ranked third in the NBA in assist-to-turnover ratio and 16th in three-point field goal percentage (.413). The guard has career averages of 6.4 points, 3.1 assists and 1.8 rebounds in four NBA seasons.\n\nSkinner, 30, has averaged 5.2 points and 4.9 rebounds in 405 career games with six teams.\n\nSkinner, who has played in the NBA for eight years, averaged a career-best 10.5 points along with 7.3 rebounds and 1.09 blocks in helping the Bucks reach the playoffs in the 2003-04 season.\n\nHe spent part of last season in Sacramento and another part with Portland, averaging 2.9 points and 3.5 rebounds in 65 games.\n\nHa Seung-Jin appeared in 21 games for Portland last season, his third in the NBA. He registered 1.6 points and 1.8 rebounds per game. Ha, who will turn 21 on Friday, is the first South Korean to play in the NBA. The Trail Blazers chose him in the second round of the 2004 draft.\n\nMagloire spent five seasons with the Hornets before joining Milwaukee during last year's off-season. He averaged 9.5 points and 7.8 rebounds in 425 career games."
