        "text": "Through four seasons with the Lakers, Steve Blake has never publicly uttered any criticism about a teammate, coach or his role.\n\nSo he’s not about to gripe about his reduced playmaking. a result of Kobe Bryant’s return to the lineup after staying sidelined for the past eight months.\n\n“You kind of defer a little bit more,” Blake said. “I won’t be getting every outlet pass as I was and dictate the offense right now. I’ll get back to running into the corners a little bit more.”\n\nBlake entered the Lakers’ game Tuesday against the Phoenix Suns averaging 9.8 points and 7.6 assists this season, partly because Mike D’Antoni’s offense taps into his playmaking instincts. But with injuries to Steve Nash (back) and Jordan Farmar (strained left hamstring), D’Antoni has assigned Bryant point guard duties to accommodate his diminished athleticism.\n\n“It’s going to be a little bit of a challenge,” Blake said. “But I was doing that a little bit earlier in the year when Nash was playing. So I’m going to have to get comfortable with that situation.”\n\nD’Antoni sounds receptive toward adjustments, too.\n\n“I don’t want to lose Steve because I think he should (handle the ball). They’ll split,” D’Antoni said. “But Kobe is going to have the ball a lot and is going to make a lot of plays.”\n\nHow should that dynamic play out?\n\n“Steve will bring it up. He’s the point guard. But if Kobe rebounds, he’ll push it,” D’Antoni said. “If the ball is swung around, it’ll be in Kobe’s hands and he’ll be making a play. They just have to play off each other.”\n\nRoad map\n\nTo maximize his health, Bryant has embraced plenty of conservative measures that he’d scoff at under normal circumstances.\n\nPlay reduced minutes? Sure. He’s only playing 26-28 minutes per game Become a passer instead of a scorer? No problem. Bryant still needs to round into form.\n\nSitting on the second night-of-back to backs? Let’s not get ahead of ourselves.\n\n“He wouldn’t do that knowing his character,” D’Antoni said. “I don’t expect that.”\n\nSaid Bryant: “It’s my job. I’m going to show up and play.”\n\nThe Lakers will have a hefty challenge in managing Bryant’s playing time when they begin a four-game trip this week in five nights with stops in Oklahoma City (Friday), Charlotte (Saturday), Atlanta (Monday) and Memphis (Tuesday).\n\nThe Lakers are also unsure if Nash will return for the trip, let alone travel with the team.\n\n“He’s still trying to get there,” D’Antoni said. “He’s doing everything possible and works out 85 times a day and will try to get back as soon as he can. He’s still in the process of seeing how he feels.”\n\nMemory lane\n\nSuns coach Jeff Hornacek played on the Utah Jazz team that eliminated the Lakers in the 1997 NBA playoffs after an 18-year-old Bryant had four airballs at the end the series clinching Game 5 loss. Hornacek saw that as a positive sign.\n\n“Step one in being a great player is having the guts to take the shot and not fearing it,” Hornacek said. “He never feared getting the ball at the end of the game.”"
