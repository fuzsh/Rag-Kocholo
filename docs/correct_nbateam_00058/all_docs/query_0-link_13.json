        "text": "Chris Haynes: So, 2014 happens, 2014 comes around, and we’re about to get right into the 2014-15 season, and Jerome calls me and tells me, ‘Hey, the Blazers are signing Steve Blake.’ And I’m like, ‘Okay, cool, Steve Blake is coming back. He’s a fan favorite in Portland,’ I’m like, ‘Okay, that’s a nice pickup, a nice backup to Dame.’ He was like, ‘They’re giving him No. 25.’ And it’s still not registering to me. He was like, ‘That’s my number, man.’ I was like, ‘Oooooh.’ He was like, ‘They still ain’t put—‘ like, he was hurt. He was hurt. This is 2014-15 season. He was hurt that they gave Blake his number, No. 25, and basically saying that there’s no immediate plans to retire his jersey.\n\nArenas recalled a story from when he and Blake were teammates on the Washington Wizards during a recent episode of his ‘No Chill Gil’ podcast. They got into a fight at practice and how Blake reacted afterward took Arenas by surprise. “During practice I elbowed Steve Blake and he swung at me,” Arenas said. “I was like ‘damn, wait hold on.’ Oh, really? Did [he] just throw a punch at me? Is that how we’re working here? We’re going through it, like wrestling on the floor. Practiced ended. He’s like ‘alright, man, y’all want to go to Legal Seafood?'”\n\nArenas couldn’t believe Blake wanted to break bread and eat shrimp that soon after a fight. “What are you talking to me like that for? Don’t be talking to me like that. He was like ‘let’s go to Legal Seafood, food on me; let’s go through these plays,'” Arenas said. Arenas explained how those who knew Blake better had to fill him in. That’s just how he rolls.\n\nWilliams declined to explain why Blake and Greer are no longer on the staff. “The details of it all, I don’t want to get into,” Williams said. “Organizations go through change and there are times where guys have to make decisions that are best for them and their families. It’s a tough loss to not have those guys, but those decisions have to be made and as a leader, I have to respect what’s best for the organization and what’s best for the individuals.”"
