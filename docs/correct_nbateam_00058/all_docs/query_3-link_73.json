        "text": "As he again prepared to don the familiar purple-and-gold, but this time as a 36-year-old warrior leading the NBL’s Sydney Kings, Blake saw the NBA tip-off yesterday without him for the first time since 2003.\n\nInstead he is in Sydney, admitting he knows little about the NBL but plenty about Australian basketballers.\n\nHe teamed last season with Aron Baynes in Detroit, played with Andrew Bogut at Milwaukee Bucks, then again at Golden State Warriors, and also had Patty Mills as a team-mate at Portland Trail Blazers — his other favourite NBA destination — before the Aussie Olympian was signed by San Antonio.\n\n“I love the guy,” Blake said of Baynes.\n\n“I enjoyed playing with him, he understands the game really well and I loved running the pick-and-roll with him.\n\n“Bogut was a good team-mate and such a great passer for a big guy, which guards like me particularly appreciate.”\n\nBlake said he did not expect the Dallas Mavericks, where Bogut was traded to accommodate Golden State acquiring Kevin Durant from Oklahoma City Thunder, to challenge for the 2016-17 championship.\n\n“The teams everyone expects to be in it at the finish are the ones I expect as well,” he said.\n\n“That’s Cleveland, Golden State, the Clippers, the Spurs — those teams are great and I can’t pick one (to win it all).\n\n“I think the Durant signing will work for Golden State.\n\n“They’re team-orientated guys.”\n\nBlake had NBA stops at Washington Wizards (2003-05), Portland Trail Blazers (2005-06), Milwaukee Bucks (2006-7), Denver Nuggets (2007), back to Portland Trail Blazers (2007-10), Los Angeles Clippers (2010), Los Angeles Lakers (2010-14), Golden State Warriors (2014), back to Portland Trail Blazers (2014-15) and finally Detroit Pistons (2015-16).\n\nHis 923 total NBA games easily make him the most experienced player from The Show to suit for an NBL club.\n\nHe has played alongside NBA giants such as Kobe Bryant, Pau Gasol, Steve Nash and Dwight Howard, and has no doubt Gasol will have a huge impact this season in San Antonio.\n\n“The Spurs will be really good and he makes them a serious contender,” Blake said, Sydney’s new guard also complimentary about what Gregg Popovich-coached teams can achieve.\n\nAs for our NBL?\n\n“I’m looking forward to this opportunity with Sydney,” he said.\n\n“It looks like a good team and going well.”\n\nThere’s a huge upside, of course, with the Kings’ colour scheme too.\n\n“I had a lot of shoes made when I was playing for the Lakers so I’ll be able to wear them here,” he said."
