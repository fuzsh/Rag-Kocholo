        "text": "There was a familiar face from the past in the gym when the Portland Trail Blazers opened training camp on Tuesday: Steve Blake.\n\nThe 13-year NBA vet and three-time Blazers guard is now a part of Terry Stotts' staff as a coaching intern as he transitions from his playing career into the coaching trade.\n\n\"I've always appreciated the players' point of view,\" Stotts said Tuesday, \"so in coaches meetings I'll ask him his opinion on something because he has a unique perspective and I respect that.\"\n\nStotts said Blake joined the staff in an intern role in September after previously expressing interest in possibly getting into coaching.\n\n\"It's a good way for him to kind of transition into coaching and figure out if it's something he wants to do,\" said Stotts.\n\nFor Blazers point guard Damian Lillard and his teammates, Blake, whose last NBA season came with the Detroit Pistons in 2015-16, offers a a natural bridge between the coaches and players.\n\n\"I think having Steve around is good, because it comes from a different lens than the coaches,\" Lillard said. \"They're telling it kind of as enforcers -- 'you should have been here, you need to do this, this is what we wanted' -- but with Steve it's more him teaching. He wants to see you improve, see you do better.\n\n\"He's also a vet ... he's been a starter, played good minutes as a backup, he's been on winning teams and losing teams. Just having him here, I think, is really helpful for the players.\"\n\nIn the video above, Stotts and Lillard discuss what Blake brings to the staff from the coaching and player perspectives."
