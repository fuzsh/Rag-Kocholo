        "text": "The Portland Trail Blazers are an American professional basketball team based in Portland, Oregon. The Trail Blazers play in the Northwest Division of the Western Conference in the National Basketball Association (NBA). The franchise entered the NBA in 1970, and is the only major league franchise in Oregon. The Trail Blazers sold out 814 consecutive home games from 1977 through 1995, the longest such streak for American professional sports teams.[1] The team has played their home games at the Rose Garden Arena since the 1995–96 NBA season. The Trail Blazers are owned by Paul Allen, and Kevin Pritchard, a former Trail Blazers head coach, is their general manager.[2][3] Since the team joined the NBA in 1970, it has won one NBA championship, three conference championships, four division championships, and has appeared in the NBA playoffs twenty-six times.[4]\n\nThe team has advanced to the NBA Finals three times, winning the NBA Championship once, in 1977. The other NBA Finals appearances were in 1990 and 1992.[5] The team has qualified for the playoffs in 25 of their 36 seasons, including a streak of 21 straight appearances from 1983 to 2003.[6] Four Hall of Fame players have played for the Trail Blazers (Lenny Wilkens, Bill Walton, Clyde Drexler, and Drazen Petrovic),[7] as well as one player (Scottie Pippen) who was recognized as one of the league's 50 greatest but is not yet eligible for the Hall. Bill Walton is the franchise's most decorated player; he was the NBA Finals Most Valuable Player (MVP) in 1977, and the regular season MVP the following year.[5][8] Three Blazer rookies (Geoff Petrie, Sidney Wicks, and Brandon Roy) have won the NBA Rookie of the Year award. Two Hall of Fame coaches, Lenny Wilkens and Jack Ramsay, have coached the Blazers, and two others, Mike Schuler and Mike Dunleavy, have won the NBA Coach of the Year award with the team.[7]\n\nThe Blazers have set several team and individual league records. They are the only team to have held a team scoreless during overtime on two separate occasions. In a game that went to four overtime periods, the Blazers and the Chicago Bulls combined to commit 87 personal fouls. In another four-overtime game, the Blazers and the Utah Jazz collected a combined 106 defensive rebounds. The Blazers set two records against the Golden State Warriors: the record for combined three-point field-goal attempts by both teams and the record for the most three-point field-goal attempts by one player.
