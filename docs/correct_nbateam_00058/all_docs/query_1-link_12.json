        "text": "Raj Mehta-USA TODAY Sports\n\nComing off a forgettable 2015-16 with the Detroit Pistons, veteran point guard Steve Blake is working out in hopes of signing with a new team before NBA training camp gets underway.\n\nContinue for updates.\n\nBlake Staying in Basketball Shape\n\nWednesday, Sept. 14\n\nOn Wednesday, Ramona Shelburne of ESPN.com reported Blake is training at the Portland Trail Blazers' training facility in hopes of landing a new deal.\n\nBlake has played parts of five seasons in Portland, most recently in 2014-15.\n\nThe 36-year-old appeared in 58 games (two starts) for the Pistons last season, averaging 4.4 points and 3.4 assists per game. After shooting under 40 percent for the third straight year, he has spent the summer hanging out on the free-agent market.\n\n\"I want to play one more year,\" Blake said in April, per David Mayo of MLive.com. \"I want to go out there and play 14 years, and I think I'll be ready to ride off after that.\"\n\nBlake has played for eight franchises in his 13 NBA seasons. After starting early in his career, Blake settled into a role as a backup who can come in and space the floor. His mediocre athleticism has waned to the point where it's affected his defense, and a vast majority of his shots have come from beyond the three-point line in recent years.\n\nBut Blake is nonetheless a veteran presence who knows where to go on both ends of the floor and doesn't make many mental mistakes. There's value in having him around, even if it's as a guy who will be wearing a suit on most nights.\n\nIf he finds a job, it could be in Portland. Shabazz Napier is the only point guard on the roster behind starter Damian Lillard. Napier's been a disappointment through his first two NBA seasons, so Blake could find a job with the Blazers if the former Connecticut Huskies star struggles in camp.\n\nOtherwise, Blake might have to wait until an injury opens up a role elsewhere in the league."
