The archaic medical practice of recognizing mental illness and "idiocy" based on appearance

"As we progress in our study of insanity, we are constantly reminded of the physical changes that take place in the patients ... Disease of the brain makes itself known by well-marked bodily symptoms that are, in themselves, almost as important as the many variations of disordered mental action," wrote Allan Hamilton, MD, in 1883's Types of Insanity: An illustrated guide to the physical diagnosis of mental disease.

This was a time when "the insane" -- which included "idiots, imbeciles, and lunatics" -- were committed to asylums in courts of law. Hamilton outlines legislation in every state regarding the process.

In other states, physicians' testimony was required. This text was meant, then, to be of earnest use in making that commitment process more accurate.

He provides several illustrated examples, which accompany colorful descriptions in the full text:

IMBECILITY

IDIOCY

CHRONIC MANIA ("Is clownish in his behavior, and sings at the top of his voice.")

CHRONIC MELANCHOLIA

MANIA OF A VIOLENT TYPE ("Her hair is coarse and becomes erect when she is excited.")

DEMENTIA

GENERAL PARESIS ("Has delusions of wealth, but is demented and stupid.")

If a friend is keeping a hand inside his jacket, maybe he is depressed?

Hamilton was also keen on handwriting analysis:

This text was written with certainty and authority, 140 years ago. It doesn't go as far as to say a diagnosis could be based entirely on physical appearance, though it would have done no favors for an eccentric person who found himself in front of a judge and happened to have a hand in his coat.
