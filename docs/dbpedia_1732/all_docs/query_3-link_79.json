        "text": "Adults with disabilities report experiencing frequent mental distress almost 5 times as often as adults without disabilities. Call your doctor if your mental health gets in the way of your daily activities for at least 14 days in a month.\n\nDecember 3rd is International Day of Persons with Disabilities. In the United States, up to 1 in 4 adults have a disability. Many people will experience a disability at some point during their lives. Disabilities limit how a child or adult functions. These limitations may include difficulty walking or climbing stairs; hearing; seeing; or concentrating, remembering, or making decisions.\n\nAlthough “people with disabilities” sometimes refers to a single population, this is a diverse group of people with a wide range of needs. Two people with the same type of disability can be affected in very different ways. Some disabilities may be hidden or not easy to see.\n\nMany Adults with Disabilities Report Frequent Mental Distress\n\nA CDC study found that adults with disabilities report experiencing more mental distress than those without disabilities.1 In 2018, an estimated 17.4 million (32.9%) adults with disabilities experienced frequent mental distress, defined as 14 or more reported mentally unhealthy days in the past 30 days. Frequent mental distress is associated with poor health behaviors, increased use of health services, mental disorders, chronic disease, and limitations in daily life.1\n\nDuring the COVID-19 pandemic, isolation, disconnect, disrupted routines, and diminished health services greatly impacted the lives and mental well-being of people with disabilities.2\n\nCall your healthcare provider if stress gets in the way of your daily activities for several days in a row. Free and confidential resources can also help you or a loved one connect with a skilled, trained counselor in your area.\n\nIt’s Okay Not to Feel Okay\n\nEveryone reacts differently to stressful situations. How you respond to stressful situations, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, can depend on your background, your support systems (e.g., family or friends), your financial situation, your health and emotional background, the community you live in, and many other factors.\n\nPeople with disabilities or developmental delays may respond strongly to the stress of a crisis, particularly if they are also at higher risk for serious illness from COVID-19 and other respiratory viruses (for example, older people and people of any age with certain underlying medical conditions).\n\nHow Are You Feeling?\n\nWe are often asked this question, and many of us say we’re “fine.” But this has been a difficult time lately, and emotions can be complex. You may be feeling sad, worried, or stressed.\n\nIt helps to stay positive and remind yourself of your strengths. Visit How Right Now for inspiration and resources to find what helps.\n\nHealthy Ways to Cope with Stress\n\nKnow what to do if you are sick and are concerned about COVID-19. Contact a health provider before you start any self-treatment for COVID-19.\n\nKnow where and how to get mental health treatment and other support services and resources, including counseling or therapy (in person or through telehealth services).\n\nTake care of your emotional health. Taking care of your emotional health will help you think clearly and react to urgent needs to protect yourself and your family.\n\nTake breaks from watching, reading, or listening to news stories, including those on social media. Hearing about the pandemic repeatedly can be upsetting.\n\nTake care of your body.\n\nTake deep breaths, stretch, or meditate\n\nTry to eat healthy, well-balanced meals\n\nExercise regularly\n\nGet plenty of sleep\n\nAvoid excessive alcohol and drug use\n\nMake time to unwind. Try to do some other activities you enjoy.\n\nConnect with others. Talk with people you trust about your concerns and how you are feeling. During times of increased social distancing, people can still maintain social connections and care for their mental health. Phone calls or video chats can help you and your loved ones feel socially connected, less lonely, or isolated.\n\nConnect with your community- or faith-based organizations. While social distancing measures are in place, consider connecting online, through social media, or by phone or mail.\n\nImproving the Mental Health of People with Disabilities\n\nCDC provides funding for two National Centers on Disability that focus on improving the quality of life for people living with disabilities.\n\nSpecial Olympics’ Inclusive Health programming focuses on improving the physical and social-emotional well-being of people with intellectual disabilities by increasing inclusion in health care, wellness, and health systems for Special Olympics athletes and others with intellectual disabilities.\n\n“I learned relaxation techniques and now always try these when I find myself overwhelmed. I would recommend these strategies to others, too. A strong mind is an important part to a happy body,” shares Kayte Barton, a Special Olympics athlete from Minnesota. Barton was a part of the Special Olympics committee to help develop emotional health programming for Special Olympics athletes across the world in its flagship Special Olympics Healthy Athletes® program.\n\nSpecial Olympics’ Strong Mindfulness program offers free, 1-hour mindfulness sessions for people with intellectual disabilities and their families. Participants learn deep breathing techniques, body awareness and progressive muscle relaxation, mindful movement, and guided meditation. They also receive a Strong Minds Activity Guide designed to help them develop their coping skills in everyday life.\n\nThe National Center on Health, Physical Activity and Disability (NCHPAD) seeks to help people with disabilities and other chronic health conditions achieve health benefits through increased participation in all types of physical and social activities. NCHPAD’s M.E.N.T.O.R program, which stands for Mindfulness, Exercise and Nutrition to Optimize Recovery, takes a holistic approach to restoring, improving, and protecting health. The program divides health into three domains: physical, mental, and emotional. Through this program, people who have acquired a new disability (e.g., spinal cord injury, stroke, traumatic brain injury), a new diagnosis (e.g., multiple sclerosis, Parkinson’s disease), or have a congenital condition (e.g., cerebral palsy, spina bifida) learn the many ways life can be enhanced through health and wellness activities.\n\nDisability and Mental Health Resources\n\nCoping with Stress\n\nHealthy Living\n\nNational Centers on Disability\n\nCDC Disability and Health Promotion\n\nCDC National Center on Birth Defects and Developmental Disabilities\n\nAs CDC honors International Day of Persons with Disabilities, we ask that you join us in being a part of the global movement to change attitudes toward, and promote the inclusion of, people with disabilities.\n\nReferences\n\nCree RA, Okoro CA, Zack MM, Carbone E (2020).
