        "meta_description": "Otalgia (ear pain) is a common presentation in the primary care setting with many diverse causes. Pain that originates from the ear is called primary otalgia, and the most common causes are otitis media and otitis externa. Examination of the ear usually reveals abnormal findings in patients with primary otalgia. Pain that originates outside the ear is called secondary otalgia, and the etiology can be difficult to establish because of the complex innervation of the ear. The most common causes of secondary otalgia include temporomandibular joint syndrome and dental infections. Primary otalgia is more common in children, whereas secondary otalgia is more common in adults. History and physical examination usually lead to the underlying cause; however, if the diagnosis is not immediately clear, a trial of symptomatic treatment, imaging studies, and consultation may be reasonable options. Otalgia may be the only presenting symptom in several serious conditions, such as temporal arteritis and malignant neoplasms. When risk factors for malignancy are present (e.g., smoking, alcohol use, diabetes mellitus, age 50 years or older), computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, or otolaryngology consultation may be warranted.",

When risk factors for malignancy are present (e.g., smoking, alcohol use, diabetes mellitus, age 50 years or older), computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, or otolaryngology consultation may be warranted.\n\nThe physician should start the examination by asking the patient to localize the pain, which may reveal a secondary cause (e.g., localization to the temporomandibular joint [TMJ], myofascial pain localized to the mastoid process). Physical examination should include inspection of the auricle and periauricular region, as well as an otoscopic examination to visually inspect the tympanic membrane and the external auditory canal. Specific otoscopic examination findings for the etiology of otalgia are listed in Table 15,7 and Table 2.5,8 Detection of a middle ear effusion with moderate to severe bulging of the tympanic membrane, new-onset otorrhea not caused by otitis externa, or mild bulging of the tympanic membrane with recent onset of ear pain (less than 48 hours), especially with erythema, is key in the diagnosis of acute otitis media. The tympanic membrane is normally mobile, translucent, and intact. A tympanic membrane that has normal color and mobility is not typical for acute otitis media.9 Patients with otitis externa typically have pain, redness, swelling, and inflammation along the external auditory canal.\n\nThe complex embryologic development of the ear results in neural connections to several cranial and cervical nerves. These nerves provide sensory innervation to regions of the head, neck, chest, and abdomen, which can result in referred pain to the ear 14 (Figure 1 and Table 25,8 ). Referred pain from the trigeminal nerve (cranial nerve V) is the most common source of secondary otalgia stemming from TMJ syndrome, dental infections, trigeminal neuralgia, sinusitis, and mandibular osteomyelitis or tumor.4 Herpes zoster can affect cranial nerve VII to a lesser degree than in Ramsay Hunt syndrome, which can also cause ear pain associated with Bell palsy and an unremarkable ear examination.4 Cranial nerve IX can refer pain caused by tonsillitis, pharyngitis, pharyngeal tumor, or glossopharyngeal neuromas.4 The vagus nerve affects many systems as inferior as the colon and can be activated by any vagal stimulation. Otalgia has been reported as the presenting symptom of myocardial ischemia from irritation of the vagus nerve.20\n\nCopyright Â© 2018 by the American Academy of Family Physicians.\n\nThis content is owned by the AAFP.
