Early syphilitic infection of the CNS can either heal spontaneously (in the majority of cases) or persist as asymptomatic or symptomatic syphilitic meningitis in the first weeks and months after infection. Tertiary central nervous syphilis is the most important form of late manifestation of syphilis. It is significantly more frequent than the cardiovascular form of late syphilis (Landry T et al. 2019). Untreated, the central nervous system infection can usually progress to meningovascular syphilis (endarteritis obliterans the small vessels of the meninges, brain and spinal cord) about 5-12 years after the primary stage, or to the parenchymatous form of neurosyphilis (tabes dorsalis, paralytic neurosyphilis) after 18-25 years. In about 30% of syphilis-infected patients, neurosyphilis as a manifestation of the tertiary stage is asymptomatic. It is then a pure liquor-serological diagnosis. In a few cases, ocular symptoms (syphilitic uveitis: unspecific anterior uveitis, acute syphilitic posterior placoid chorioretinitis, panuveitis, indications of neurosyphilis (Gutierrez B et al. 2019). In other cases the vascular involvement leads to an unusual apoplexy symptomatology occurring in middle-aged patients.\n\nAsymptomatic neurosyphilis is often also observed in HIV-infected patients with low CD4 cell counts (Hobbs E et al. 2018). Thus, in HIV-positive patients with a positive syphilis serology, the \"European Guidelines of Syphilis\" recommend a lumbar puncture for clarification.\n\nClassification\n\nThis section has been translated automatically.\n\nNeurosyphilis has various forms of manifestation:\n\nSyphilitic meningitis\n\nMeningovascular syphilis (involvement of the small vessels of the meninges, brain and spinal cord)\n\nRare: Isolated syphilitic meningomyelitis\n\nRare: Isolated spinal vascular neurosyphilis\n\nAsymptomatic syphilis: asymptomatic neurosyphilis is defined when there is positive syphilisserology, lymphocytic pleocytosis and CSF protein elevation and/or positive VDRL test in CSF, but no clinical symptoms (AWMF guidelines).\n\nParenchymatous neurosyphilis\n\nTabes dorsalis\n\nProgressive paralysis\n\nSyphilitic gummata\n\nYou might also be interested in\n\nAdvertisment\n\nDermatology\n\nPincers-nail\n\nPathological transverse curvature of the usually thickened nail plate, which, when fully developed, embrace...\n\nOccurrence/Epidemiology\n\nThis section has been translated automatically.\n\nThere are no current data on the actual incidence of neurosyphilis.\n\nBefore the introduction of antibiotic therapy, neurosyphilis(tertiary syphilis) was a common complication of syphilis. About 25 to 30% of infected persons developed neurosyphilis. Of these patients, about 30% each had asymptomatic neurosyphilis or tabes dorsalis; about 10% had progressive paralysis. However, the neurosyphilitic tertiary stage is still found in developing and emerging countries with inadequate health care (Elmouden H et al. 2019).\n\nClinical features\n\nThis section has been translated automatically.\n\nThe clinical symptoms of syphilitic CNS infestation vary depending on the stage of the disease and the pattern of infestation. In the secondary stage, meningitis, polyradiculitis and rarely vascular brain stem syndromes are possible. Syphilitic meningitis is characterized by meningism, headache and cranial nerve lesions (optionally N. VIII, VII and III).\n\nMeningovascular neurosyphilis: Meningovascular neurosyphilis is predominantly an endarteritis obliterans the small and medium-sized vessels of the meninges, brain and spinal cord. Furthermore, obliterating endarteritis may be present, affecting the medium-sized vessels at the base of the brain (A. cerebri media and branches of A. basilaris). Meningovascular neurosyphilis occurs 5-12 years after the primary stage. Since it can affect any part of the brain, the symptoms are varied. Involvement of cerebral vessels leads to arterial occlusion and a corresponding failure symptomatology (Shi M et al. 2019).\n\nNote: The angiitic infestation of the A. cerebralis media can lead to its occlusion and to apoplectic insult (unusual apoplectic symptoms in medieval patients). Psychiatric changes may precede an occlusion symptomatology.\n\nParenchymatous neurosyphilis\n\nIn parenchymatous neurosyphilis there is a progressive breakdown of nerve tissue in the brain and/or spinal cord. Parenchymatous neurosyphilis appears 18-25 years after the primary stage as progressive paralysis or tabes dorsalis.\n\nProgressive par alysis (paralytic neurosyphilis; dementia paralytica; general paresis): Progressive paralysis has become rare due to the current diagnosis and therapy of syphilis. It represents a chronic progressive encephalitis and is characterized by progressive dementia. Typical are psychotic symptoms such as delusions (especially megalomania) and personality disorders. Further severe depression, tongue tremor, speech disorders, headache and dizziness, abnormal pupil reaction (Argyll-Robertson sign with reflex pupil rigidity and often exuberant convergence reaction), \"mimic tremor\", epileptic seizures, reflex anomalies, urinary and fecal incontinence, marasmus.\n\nTabes dorsalis: The tabes dorsalis (tabes = putrefaction, decay) describes a syphilitic demyelination of the posterior spinal cord strands and the dorsal roots with chronic leptomeningitis. Untreated, tabes dorsalis occurred in about 30% of all patients with neurosyphilis. Today, this advanced form of parenchymatous syphilis is rare in industrialised countries, but should be considered for differential diagnosis in developing countries (Elmouden H et al. 2019). The symptoms appear 25-30 years after the primary infection. Lancing pain of the lower extremity and abdomen, cramps, ataxias, paresthesias, loss of depth and vibration sensitivity, loss of muscle reflexes, optic nerve damage are essential symptoms of this disease. Due to the sensitivity disorders, there is an incorrect loading of joints and plantar surfaces with consecutive mutilations (Charcot joints). The Argyll-Robertson phenomenon (a reflex pupil rigidity) is detectable in 60-70% of infected patients.\n\nSyphilitic gums: Gums as circumscribed, space-occupying granulomas are very rare today. They develop from the meninges at the brain convexity (Soares-Fernandes et al. 2007). Depending on their location, they are clinically silent or cause focal symptoms. A polytopic appearance of the gums is called \"gummy neurosyphilis\".\n\nDiagnosis\n\nThis section has been translated automatically.\n\nThe suspicion of neurosyphilis results either from anamnestic information about a previous syphilitic sexually transmitted disease or from a reactive treponemenserology with concomitant neurological and/or psychiatric symptoms. Note: Clinically decisive is to know that a negative treponema-specific syphilis screening test (e.g. TPPA or FTA-abs test) in serum definitely excludes neurosyphilis! Furthermore, it is important that all patients who have been serologically diagnosed with active, late-manifest syphilis must be examined for the presence of neurosyphilis. A lumbar puncture (LP) is indicated to clarify this.\n\nFurthermore, LP is indicated in the following constellations: VDRL titre>1:32 in late latency, in HIV-positive patients in late latency, in serologically positive patients with neurological or psychiatric symptoms independent of the stage of syphilis. Note: in HIV infected patients, in rare cases, the TPPA, FTA-Abs and VDRL tests may be false negative, making the diagnosis of neurosyphilis more difficult. CSF testing is not indicated for early syphilis unless neurological, ocular or psychiatric symptoms are present.\n\nThe following diagnostic measures and examination steps are necessary to confirm the diagnosis of neurosyphilis:\n\nImaging procedure (cMRI)\n\nLumbar puncture with determination of cell count, total protein, cerebrospinal fluid lactate\n\nCSF serology: Synchronous analysis of CSF and serum to calculate the L/S ratios for albumin, IgG, IgA, IgM and an antibody index for treponema antibodies (e.g. ITpA index). Once the diagnosis of a confirmed syphilitic CNS infection has been established, the clinical activity of the process is checked.\n\nVDRL test: positivity in CSF is considered diagnostic evidence of neurosyphilis. The sensitivity of the VDRL test in CSF is 70% with a high specificity of 99%.\n\nTreponema-specific antibody tests (TPPA; FTA-abs test): CSF positivity is not diagnostic evidence. However, CSF negativity speaks against the presence of neurosyphilis.\n\nLiquor chemistry: Pleocytosis (cell count >5-10 leukocytes / μl) as well as an elevated cerebrospinal fluid protein (>0.4g/l) are regarded as markers for an inflammation of the cerebrospinal fluid space.\n\nITpA index (iTpA=intrathecal produced T. pallidum antibodies): The iTpA index is calculated as the quotient of T. pallidum specific antibody titer in serum and CSF. ITpA>2.0 - neurosyphilis probable, ITpA>3.0 - indicating neurosyphilis.\n\nOther CSF indices are:\n\nIgG Index: IgG (CSF)/IgG(Serum)x Albumin(Serum)/Album (CSF): IgG Index >0.7 =increased\n\nIgM index: IgM(CSF)/IgM(serum)x Albumin(serum)/Album (CSF): IgM index >0.1 =increased\n\nThe following signs indicate the activity of the infection:\n\nTreponemia-specific IgM detectable in serum (and no therapy performed in the last 12 months)\n\nMononuclear pleocytosis in cerebrospinal fluid\n\nVery high pathogen-unspecific antibody titers in serum and CSF, e.g. VDRL test (Veneral Disease Research Laboratory) positive in CSF\n\nITpA index>2.0 - neurosyphilis probable, ITpA>3.0 - proving neurosyphilis.\n\nProgression of neurosyphilis-typical symptoms (increase in cognitive deficits, increase in lanzinating pain or posterior strand ataxia)\n\nDifferential diagnosis\n\nThis section has been translated automatically.\n\nThe differential diagnosis must be adapted to the different stages of the disease:\n\nIn the secondary stage \"aseptic\" meningitis of other aetiology must be excluded. Co-infections of syphilis and HIV are of increasing importance because of overlapping risk groups.\n\nHerpes virus infections (herpes simplex, varicella zoster, cytomegaly, Epstein Barr) must be excluded in the case of cranial nerve lesions (diagnosis: CSF PCR, intrathecal antibody synthesis).\n\nIn case of meningovascular neurosyphilis, a septic-embolic herd encephalitis must be excluded!\n\nFurthermore a zoster vasculitis, a Borrelia vasculitis, vasculitides in mycoplasmas and others, vasculitides in autoimmune diseases, a tuberculous meningitis.\n\nIn progressive paralysis: all chronic encephalitis courses including multiple sclerosis, progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy, CMV encephalitis and Whipple's disease.)\n\nIn tabes dorsalis: funicular spinal disease in B12 avitaminosis, \"pseudotabes\" diabetica, uremica, porphyrica and alcoholica (AWMF Guidelines 2010).\n\nTherapy\n\nThis section has been translated automatically.\n\nThe first-line therapy for neurosyphilis is penicillin G in crystalloid solution, administered intravenously at 18- 24 million IU/d (4 x 6 million, 5 x 5 million or 3 x 10 million IU per day, corresponding to 3-4 million IU every 4 hours) for 14 days (minimum 10)(AWMF Guideline 2020).\n\nAssessment of treatment success by:\n\nclinical (improvement of symptoms if present)\n\ndecrease of CSF parameters (pleocytosis, CSF protein), repetition approx. 6 months after therapy.\n\nVDRL test (in serum and CSF) quarterly, in this case usually a drop of 3 - 4 titer levels (with successful therapy) within one year.\n\n(from S1 Guideline - Neurosyphilis, 2020)\n\nAlternative: 2g Ceftriaxon/day(initial dose 4 g) for 10-14 days\n\nAlternative: doxycycline 2 × 200mg for 28 days. However, tetracyclines are contraindicated in pregnancy and children up to 8 years of age.\n\nAdjunctive therapy: Epileptic seizures are treated according to anticonvulsant therapy guidelines.\n\nLancinating pain (it is mostly refractory to usual analgesics): carbamazepine, gabapentin, pregabalin, amitryptiline or flupirtine.\n\nHydrocephalus (very rare late complication): shunt implantation.\n\nPsychotic episodes and confusion syndromes: anxiolytics and/or neuroleptics.\n\nNote a Jarisch-Herxheimer reaction which, however, occurs in neurosyphilis in only 1-2% of cases. The Jarisch-Herxheimer reaction occurs 12-24 hours after the start of antibiotic treatment (fever, headache or muscle pain, fatigue, tachycardia, leukocytosis and relative lymphopenia). Furthermore, seizures and/or worsening of neurological deficits may occur.\n\nSee also p.11 of the current guidelines of the STI Society.\n\nLiterature\n\nThis section has been translated automatically.\n\nKlein M., Weber J. et al, Neurosyphilis, S1 guideline, 2020, in: German Society of Neurology (ed.), Guidelines for diagnosis and therapy in neurology.
