        "text": "Depression ranges in seriousness from mild, temporary episodes of sadness to severe, persistent depression. Clinical depression is the more-severe form of depression, also known as major depression or major depressive disorder. It isn't the same as depression caused by a loss, such as the death of a loved one, or a medical condition, such as a thyroid disorder.\n\nTo diagnose clinical depression, many doctors use the symptom criteria for major depressive disorder in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5), published by the American Psychiatric Association.\n\nSigns and symptoms of clinical depression may include:\n\nFeelings of sadness, tearfulness, emptiness or hopelessness\n\nAngry outbursts, irritability or frustration, even over small matters\n\nLoss of interest or pleasure in most or all normal activities, such as sex, hobbies or sports\n\nSleep disturbances, including insomnia or sleeping too much\n\nTiredness and lack of energy, so even small tasks take extra effort\n\nReduced appetite and weight loss or increased cravings for food and weight gain\n\nAnxiety, agitation or restlessness\n\nSlowed thinking, speaking or body movements\n\nFeelings of worthlessness or guilt, fixating on past failures or self-blame\n\nTrouble thinking, concentrating, making decisions and remembering things\n\nFrequent or recurrent thoughts of death, suicidal thoughts, suicide attempts or suicide\n\nUnexplained physical problems, such as back pain or headaches\n\nSymptoms are usually severe enough to cause noticeable problems in relationships with others or in day-to-day activities, such as work, school or social activities.\n\nClinical depression can affect people of any age, including children. However, clinical depression symptoms, even if severe, usually improve with psychological counseling, antidepressant medications or a combination of the two.\n\nTinnitus and antidepressants\n\nNervous breakdown: What does it mean?\n\nSee more Expert Answers"
