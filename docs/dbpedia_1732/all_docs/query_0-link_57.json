        "text": "A9 Non-invasive respiratory support in endoscopic surgery with High Flow Nasal Cannula in patients affected by Legionella Pneumophila: a case report\n\nA. Scalvenzi, M. Del Prete, M.E. Porcelli, F. Coppolino, V. Pota, P. Sansone, M.B. Passavanti, M.C. Pace\n\nUniversità degli Studi della Campania L. Vanvitelli, Napoli, Italy\n\nCorrespondence: A. Scalvenzi\n\nJournal of Anesthesia, Analgesia and Critical Care 2023, 3(Suppl 1):A9\n\nIntroduction\n\nLegionella Pneumophila is one of the most important causes of respiratory infections in humans and it is the cause of about 30% of nosocomial infections.\n\nAnastomotic leakage following the intervention of esophageal resection presents one of the surgical complications with the highest morbidity and mortality.\n\nCase reports\n\nFor the past year we have faced a case of anastomotic leakage post esophageal resection, treated through the application of an endoprosthesis esophageal in a patient affected by L. Pneumophila.\n\nThe main problem for the anesthetist during this procedure is identifying the most inadequate perioperative management.\n\nIn this specific case, the patient, affected by L. Pneumophila, presented a PO2/FiO2 ratio between 100mmHg and 200mmHg, giving rise to a moderate ARDS panel according to Berlin Criteria (Image 1).\n\nFor this reason, we decided to use a non-invasive periprocedural ventilation mode, specifically the High Flow Nasal Cannula (HFNC), to reduce the risk of postoperative pulmonary complications due to invasive ventilation through endotracheal intubation (ETI).\n\nThe parameters set during the entire procedure remained stable: Flow 60 L/min, FiO2 100%, Temperature 37 °C.\n\nThe patient, opportunely mixed with the current type of anesthesiological procedure and immediately after signing the Informed Consensus, is premedicated with intravenous Midazolam 0.05mg/Kg, while sedation is effected with an initial bolus of Propofol at 0.5mg/Kg. Successively, sedation is maintained whit Propofol in continuous infusion at 3.5mg/Kg/h.\n\nThe approximate duration of the procedure is 25 minutes. The patient's vital parameters are stable for all the duration of the intervention, with a SpO2 > 95%, and a MAP > 70 mmHg.\n\nAfter the procedure, the patient is returned to the Intensive Care unit where he has completed the course of antibiotic therapy, with a progressive reduction of the need for oxygen therapy.\n\nConclusion\n\nAirway management in patients with L. pneumophila can be a problem, aggravated by a series of additional risks related to ETI, such as pulmonary damage from mechanical ventilation, contamination of the ventilator, delayed weaning and an increase in hospital stay days. The use of HFNCs in endoscopic procedures allows to avoid these risks, eliminating the operating field conflict with the surgical procedure and guaranteeing a higher oxygen saturation compared to other oxygenation devices.\n\nA10 Mortality and thrombotic events in SARS-CoV-2 positive patients after urgent or emergency surgery\n\nG. Sudano, M. De Riso, F. Sbaraglia, G. Concina, T.C. Caputo, D.M. Micci, A.M. Scarano, A. Vergari, M. Del Vicario, M. Rossi\n\nFondazione Policlinico Agostino Gemelli IRCCS-Università Cattolica del Sacro Cuore, Roma, Italy\n\nCorrespondence: G. Sudano\n\nJournal of Anesthesia, Analgesia and Critical Care 2023, 3(Suppl 1):A10\n\nBackground\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic led to significant changes in the management of surgical patients. Elective surgery underwent a strong reshaping, whereas urgent and emergency procedures continued.\n\nThe aim of this retrospective study was to evaluate postoperative mortality rate and thrombotic events in SARS-CoV-2 positive patients undergoing urgent or emergency surgery.\n\nMaterials and Methods\n\nAfter local Ethic Committee’s approval, we reviewed all records of the SARS-CoV-2 positive patients who underwent urgent or emergency surgical procedures between April 2020 and October 2022 in the emergency department of IRCCS Fondazione Policlinico Universitario Agostino Gemelli of Rome.\n\nWe included patients who tested positive for both antigenic and molecular SARS-CoV-2 specimens in the time range that goes from 5 days before to 1 day after surgery.\n\nPostoperative mortality rate and the percentage of thrombotic events were evaluated. Mortality rate was specifically assessed on the first postoperative day, between the second and the fifth postoperative day and after 5 postoperative days.\n\nSurgical procedures are summarized in Table 1.\n\nResults\n\nFrom April 2020 to October 2022, 6387 patients underwent urgent or emergency surgery, 160 of which reported a positive SARS-CoV-2 test. Our patients’ mean (SD) age was 57 (23) years old.\n\nA total of 40 SARS-CoV-2 positive patients died after surgery so the overall mortality rate was 25%: 16 patients died on the first postoperative day (40%), 11 patients died between the second and fifth postoperative day (28%) and 13 patients died after the fifth postoperative day (13%). Dead patients’ mean (SD) age was 73 (15) years old.\n\nPostoperative thrombotic events occurred in 11 patients (7%).\n\nThe distribution of fatality and thrombotic events per year are reported in Figure 1 and Figure 2.\n\nConclusions\n\nDespite the lack of comparison our study provides evidence of what happened during the pandemic period in a high volume COVID-19 hospital.\n\nSARS-CoV-2 positive patients undergoing urgent or emergency surgical procedures during the pandemic had a high risk of mortality and of postoperative thrombotic events.\n\nEven though the highest distribution of SARS-CoV-2 positive patients occurred in 2022, the mortality rate per year resulted higher in 2020, probably due to a lower sensitivity and specificity of the tests used at the beginning of the pandemic and also to the lockdown condition that significantly reduced access to emergency departments.\n\nThe results of this study emphasize the importance of carefully evaluating risks and benefits of performing urgent or emergency surgery in SARS-CoV-2 positive patients and the need to implement strict postoperative monitoring to prevent the complications to which these patients are highly susceptible.\n\nA11 Preliminary data on the efficacy and safety of intrathecal analgesia within a multimodal analgesia strategy for patients undergoing open liver surgery\n\nE.

Schirru\n\nJournal of Anesthesia, Analgesia and Critical Care 2023, 3(Suppl 1):A11\n\nBackground\n\nERAS guidelines recommend multimodal analgesia strategy for patient undergoing liver surgery and individuate intrathecal opiates as a viable alternative to thoracic epidural analgesia (TEA) with less associated hemodynamic instability [1].\n\nIntrathecal opiates administration reduces the need for systemic opiates that have more undesired side effects, including postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV), itching and respiratory depression. The use of atropine also seems to contribute to reduction of PONV [2].\n\nMaterials and Methods\n\nWe conducted an observational retrospective study, including patients over 18 years of age undergoing laparotomic liver surgery. Our objectives were: to compare intrathecal morphine (100-200 mcg) versus TEA and total intravenous analgesia in terms of pain intensity and need for rescue analgesics in the postoperative period; evaluate the incidence of side effects such as PONV, itching and respiratory depression in patients undergoing laparotomic liver surgery after administration of intrathecal morphine.\n\nData were collected at 0, 3, 6, 12, 24 and 48 hours after surgery. To assess the intensity of pain (static and dynamic) we used the NRS scale, dividing the patients into 4 groups with no (NRS 0), mild (NRS 1-3), moderate (NRS 4-5) and severe pain (NRS>5).\n\nResults\n\nData from 171 patients were analyzed. Eighty-seven patients received only intravenous analgesia, seventy intrathecal morphine and fourteen TEA.\n\nWe found no significant difference in static NRS between the three groups of patients; we recorded significant difference in dynamic NRS between intrathecal opioid group and total intravenous analgesia group, while we didn’t find significant difference in dynamic NRS between intrathecal opioid group and TEA group. There was no significant difference in incidence of side effects (e.g. PONV) between the three groups of patients.\n\nNo major complication followed intrathecal morphine administration.\n\nConclusions\n\nIntrathecal analgesia has shown to be effective in post-operative pain control in the first 24-48 hours after surgery. Dosages of 100-200 mcg of morphine seem to be safe and also it seems that using atropine as adjuvant could be useful to reduce side effects such as PONV.\n\nIn conclusion somministration of intrathecal opioid seems to be a valid alternative to TEA and a better analgesia strategy than total intravenous analgesia.\n\nData were collected from elettronic-database, patients expressed informed consent to data collection in University-hospital\n\nReferences\n\n[1]\n\nJoliat et al.

Schirru\n\nJournal of Anesthesia, Analgesia and Critical Care 2023, 3(Suppl 1):A12\n\nBackground\n\nOpioid administration remains the mainstay of therapy for post-surgical pain; still these drugs have undesired side effects, including postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV), delayed recovery of bowel function, itching and respiratory depression. Multimodal analgesia is recommended by ERAS guidelines as a strategy to reduce side effects and obtain a better pain control [1]. Spinal analgesia has a high efficacy and relatively low complications [2]. The use of atropine as adjuvant could reduce PONV [3].\n\nMaterials and Methods\n\nWe conducted an observational retrospective study, including patients over 18 years of age undergoing major abdominal surgery who received intrathecal analgesia with morphine at a dose of 100-200 mcg. Analgesic effects were evaluated by means of the VAS score (NRS scale) for pain intensity and need for rescue analgesics. In addition, the incidence of PONV and respiratory depression were collected.\n\nData were registered at 0, 3, 6, 12, 24 and 48 hours after surgery. NRS scale was used to divide the patients into 4 groups with no (NRS 0), mild (1-3), moderate (4-5) and severe pain (>5).\n\nResults\n\nData from 700 patients were analyzed. Graphic 1 and 2 summarize the results on analgesia and Graphic 3 shows the incidence of PONV. No major complications were recorded and 26 patients (3.71%) experienced pruritus.\n\nConclusions\n\nIntrathecal morphine has shown to be effective in post-operative pain management during the first 48 hours after surgery. Dosages of morphine of 100-200 mcg seem to be safe in terms of respiratory depression.\n\nData were collected from elettronic-database, patients express informed consent to data collection in University-hospital.\n\nReferences\n\n[1]\n\nTan M, Law LS, Gan TJ.

Ricci 3,4\n\n1 Università di Siena, Siena, Italy; 2 Università di Perugia, Perugia, Italy; 3 Università di Firenze, Firenze, Italy; 4 AOU Meyer, Firenze, Italy\n\nCorrespondence: M.T. Pizzo, L. Saccarelli\n\nJournal of Anesthesia, Analgesia and Critical Care 2023, 3(Suppl 1):A13\n\nCurrent pediatric preoperative fasting guidelines have recommended conservative fasting regimes for many years without significant updates in the last decades. Recent publications have employed more liberal fasting regimes with no evidence of increased aspiration or regurgitation rates. The development of a liberal protocol with a strict application may warrant a shorter period of fasting before pediatric surgery. Essentially, we allowed clear fluid fasting within 1 hour, mother's milk within 3 hours, non-human milk and 'light breakfast' within 4 hours and last meal within 6 hours. The aim of this study was to evaluate the actual times of clear fluid fasting in children undergoing surgery in an institution where fasting was standardized according to the recent European guidelines. A retrospective analysis of fasting times according to local monitoring forms was conducted in a 6 months period. The local ethics committee approved the study. Overall 1000 patients were enrolled in the study. Median (interquartile) age was 7 (3-12) years. All surgeries except cardiac were included. The first 421 children were selected as initial protocol application (group START) in the first 2 months after protocol publication and providers training. START children data were compared to the remaining cases in order to verify if adherence to the protocol tended to improve (group APP). Clear fluid fasting was 180 min (110-342) in START group and 160 (96-320) in group APP (p=0.08) (figure 1).\n\nThe improvement was slightly more evident when patients scheduled after the first case (i.e., after 9.30 AM) were analyzed: in this case clear fluid fasting was 207 min (120-345) in START group and 180 (105-306) in group APP (p=0.028). There were 84 adverse events (i.e., hypotension/bradycardia at induction and difficulty to achieve venous access) related to preoperative fasting. At logistic regression these events showed a significant association with duration of clear fluids fasting (OR 0.12 95%CI 0.09-0.17; p=0.02) with a median fasting time in children with presence of adverse events of 377 (210-660) minutes vs 170 (100-351) in children without. Our study showed several important information: 1) in an institution were clear fluids fasting is allowed up to 60 minutes before surgery, median times do not tend to decrease below 2-3 hours. This is essentially due to unwillingness of patients and relatives to provide fluids and to the scarce explanation of the involved healthcare providers to consistently explain this aspect to the patients. 2) Interestingly, some tendency to improvement was observed between START and APP. Then, apparently, fasting times are not influenced by the time of scheduled surgery, even if the APP group seemed to improve with respect to START in the subgroup of 'later' cases. 3) Clear fluid fasting is indeed associated with adverse events related to fasting and this further underlines the importance of respecting protocol times. Further monitoring of fasting times will allow us to appraise if the slight trend to improvement in the APP population will achieve a significant value in the next months and if practices to endorse such improvement will need to be considered.\n\nA14 Evaluation of intra-abdominal pressure during postoperative CPAP with helmet\n\nP.

Priani (paolo.priani@edu.unife.it)\n\nJournal of Anesthesia, Analgesia and Critical Care 2023, 3(Suppl 1):A14\n\nBackground\n\nPostoperative respiratory complications are a major cause of mobidity and mortality during the postoperative period. The PRISM trial investigated the effect of postoperative CPAP via helmet device on PPCs. Although the PRISM trial did not found any statistically significant difference in terms of PPCs [1], CPAP is still widely used in the treatment of respiratory failure during postoperative period. The effect of CPAP via helmet on intra-abdominal pressure still not well investigated.\n\nMaterials and Methods\n\nAfter obtaining informed consent, as a sub-study of the PRISM trial, we enrolled 22 patients that underwent major abdominal surgery and we started CPAP via helmet device according to the PRISM study protocol. We performed arterial BGA and measured intra-bladder pressure through urinary catheter as an indirect measure of intra-abdominal pressure [2]. The measures were obtained before starting CPAP (T0), after 30 minutes (T1) and 4 hours (T2) of CPAP.\n\nResults\n\nAll of the patients underwent CPAP via helmet for at least 4 hours. The median level of PEEP administered was 7.5 cmH2O [5-7.625]. At T0, 5 patients (22%) had an IAP equal or grater than 12 cmH2O (cutoff value for defining Intra-abdominal Hypertension [3]). At T1 and T2, 10 (45%) and 12 (55%) patients respectively met the criteria for IAH. 6 patients (27%) with normal IAP values at T0 developed grade 1 or 2 IAH at T1 and/or T2. The mean IAP was 8.57±3.82 at T0, 10.20±4.36 at T1 and 11.16±4.16 at T2. We found a statistically significant increase in the IAP between T0 and T2 (p=0.0012). We found a statistically significant increase in P/F ratio between T1 and T2 (p=0.023) but not between T0 and T1 (p=0.27). No statistically significant variations were found in creatinine levels before and after the CPAP (p=0.48).\n\nConclusions\n\nIAP was significantly higher after 4 hours of CPAP. In 6 cases, IAP increased from normal values to over 12 cmH2O during CPAP.\n\nReferences\n\n1.\n\nPRISM trial group.

Badino, T. Domenichetti, E.G. Bignami\n\nAnesthesiology, Intensive Care and Pain Medicine Division, Department of Medicine and Surgery, University of Parma, Parma, Italy\n\nCorrespondence: M. Panizzi\n\nJournal of Anesthesia, Analgesia and Critical Care 2023, 3(Suppl 1):A15\n\nBackground\n\nPerioperative anxiety is one of the most impacting aspects on the patient's quality of life in the perioperative period. This pilot study, which started on February 7, 2019 and ended on January 29, 2020, has as primary objective to investigate the role of anxiety in the context of general anesthesia during elective abdominal surgery in adult patients, clarifying the correlation between the extent of anxiety state and the level of pain in the postoperative period.\n\nMaterials and Methods\n\nThis is a prospective, observational, single-centre study. Participants were adults patients undergoing videolaparoscopic cholecystectomy. Informed consent was obtained for each patient. Anxiety before surgery and 1 day postoperatively were measured using the APAIS (Amsterdam Preoperative Anxiety and Information Scale) questionnaire, while pain was investigated by using NRS (Numeric Rating Scale) and VAS (Visual Analogue Scale). Along with these, other clinical variables were recorded (Fig. 1).\n\nResults\n\n31 patients were included in the pilot study, 22 female and 9 male. Mean age was 57 years. An average score of 11.06 on the APAIS scale was observed in the postoperative period versus an average score of 13.38 in the preoperative period, highlighting how patients tended to have less anxiety in the postoperative phase than in the preoperative one. Correlating the APAIS questionnaire score with the postoperative pain by NRS scale and setting a value greater than/equal to 4 as a cut-off, 21 out of 31 patients (67.74%) had an NRS greater than or equal to 4, and of these 15 had an APAIS score greater than or equal to 14 (above the calculated mean); at the opposite, 10 out of 31 patients had an NRS less than or equal to 3, of these 8 had an APAIS score less than or equal to 13 (below the calculated mean).\n\nConclusions\n\nThe results of this study show that highly anxious patients tend to present more pain postoperatively, while moderately anxious patients present less pain postoperatively. It becomes therefore important to create perioperative programs that can not only manage pain in the postoperative phase with the existing pain services but also recognize, investigate, and treat the patient's anxious state preoperatively, in order to create more patient-centered pathways.\n\nIn addition, this pilot study may give the basis for further studies to understand the pathophysiological processes that correlate anxiety with pain, such as inflammatory status and/or other perioperative variables.\n\nA16 Multimodal prevention strategy for high-risk postoperative nausea and vomiting: a case report\n\nV.

Rossi\n\nFondazione Policlinico Agostino Gemelli IRCCS - Università Cattolica del Sacro Cuore, Roma, Italia\n\nCorrespondence: V. Nussbaum\n\nJournal of Anesthesia, Analgesia and Critical Care 2023, 3(Suppl 1):A16\n\nBackground\n\nPostoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) is a condition that can occur in the immediate postoperative period up to 24 hours after surgery. PONV is usually a self-limited adverse event, treated without sequelae, but it could lead even to severe complication [1]. This condition is still underestimated but a comprehensive multimodal approach should be indicated facing high-risk patients.\n\nCase report\n\nA 42-years old woman scheduled for elective bilateral breast implant replacement, ASA score I, BMI 23.03, nonsmoker, reported previous episodes of severe PONV following general and neuraxial anesthesia and motion sickness. She was considered a risk 4 based on simplified Apfel score. She refused a loco regional anesthesia, so a multimodal strategy was proposed to reduce the risk of PONV.\n\nIn pre-anesthesia, premedication was given iv with ondansetron 4 mg and dexamethasone 4 mg while magnetic beads were positioned on the surface of both ears’ skin, in antiemetic points (Figure 1).\n\nIn the operating room, after multiparametric monitoring, general anesthesia was induced with propofol in Target Controlled Infusion (TCI) 3 mcg/ml and remifentanil TCI 2 ng/ml. Intraoperative maintenance was ensured by a bolus of fentanyl 100 mcg, remifentanil TCI (2-3 ng/ml), ketamine 0.8 mg/kg and midazolam 10 mg both in refracted doses. Towards the end of the surgery, acetaminophene 1g, ketorolac 30 mg, and metoclopramide 10 mg were administered. In the emerging phase, remifentanil was discontinued and propofol was reduced to 1 mcg/ml until the patient resumed spontaneous breathing. The patient was successfully extubated and propofol infusion terminated.\n\nThe patient stayed under observation for about 45 minutes in the Recovery Room. She wasn’t agitated and denied PONV.\n\nDuring the 24 hours after surgery, the patient didn't experienced either nausea or vomiting or pain and was in complete well-being for the discharge.\n\nConclusion\n\nPreventing PONV in high-risk patients should require a multimodal strategy to reach a safe postoperative recovery. In our case we provide a multimodal strategy based on three cornerstones. Total intravenous anesthesia technique with opioid sparing approach is nowadays considered the gold standard technique [2]. The use of pharmacological prevention and homeostasis maintenance during surgery has been proved as effective in reducing emetic stimulus [3]. We add in this case a non-pharmacological approach using acupuncture technique, useful for PONV managing [4]. In view of this multimodal strategy, we hope that in the future acupuncture approach will be more used as well as the pharmacological approach.\n\nInformed consent to publish had been obtained.\n\nReferences\n\n[1]\n\nSbaraglia F, Saviani M, Timpano JM, Rossi M.

Malatesta\n\nJournal of Anesthesia, Analgesia and Critical Care 2023, 3(Suppl 1):A17\n\nBackground\n\nThe Newborn Infant Parasympathetic Evaluation (NIPE) is a Heart rate variability-based technology, developed in 2015, for assessing pain and comfort in neonates under 2-years-old, including premature infants. It is an adaptation of the Analgesia Nociception Index (ANI), developed for monitoring adults and children > 2 years, during surgery under GA. NIPE estimates HR, HF oscillations (> 0.15 Hz), reflecting parasympathetic activity. The monitor displays 2 values, ranging from 0 to 100: the instant-NIPE (NIPEi) and the mean-NIPE (NIPEm). A decrease in NIPE score is interpreted as indicating an increased stress level, whereas an increase in NIPE score indicates improved comfort. According to the manufacturer, NIPE value <50 is indicative of either discomfort, stress, or pain.\n\nLittle is known about the performance of the NIPE in anesthetized neonates and infants.\n\nThe aim of this study was to investigate the effectiveness of NIPE in predicting painful stimuli, in newborns undergoing GA, and the impact on the need of postoperative analgesia.\n\nMethods\n\nIn this single center, prospective, observational pilot study, 28 infants, aged <15 months and weighting <10Kg were recruited for correction of craniosynostosis. Patients were compared in two groups: the NIPE group received Fentanyl (1-2 mcg/Kg) according to the NIPE value (NIPE score< 50); the Control group received Fentanyl (1-2 mcg/Kg) relying on changes in heart rate and blood pressures, together with other clinical signs such as sweating or movements. The primary endpoint was to investigate the ability of the NIPE and heart rate to detect an insufficient antinociception. The secondary endpoint was the correlation between NIPE values and heart rate and the amount of postoperative analgesia.\n\nResults\n\nFor statistical analysis Student’s T test was used for unpaired data. A p=0.05was considered statistically significant. A reduction in the use of fentanyl in the NIPE group is evident, with a mean of 12 mcg versus the 22mcg of the control group (Figure 1).\n\nA wide inter-variability was found in the control group. The Pearson’s chi-square test was used for the secondary objectives. NIPE group showed a tendency to match heart rate values and NIPE value reduction at various times of surgery with no significant statistically difference.\n\nConclusion\n\nThis study provisionally suggests the ability of the NIPE to detect insufficient antinociception and is valuable in reducing the amount of opioids really needed by the infant.\n\nReferences\n\n1.\n\nUpton HD, Ludbrook GL. “Intraoperative “Analgesia Nociception Index” guided fentanyl administration during sevoflurane anesthesia in lumbar discectomy and laminectomy: a randomized clinical trial.” Anesth Analg 2017; 125: 81-90.\n\n2.\n\nSzental JA, Webb A. “Postoperative pain after laparoscopic cholecystectomy is not reduced by intraoperative analgesia guided by analgesia nociception index (ANI®) monitoring: a randomized clinical trial.” Br J Anaesth 2015; 114: 640-5.\n\n3.\n\nGruenewald M, Herz J. “Measurement of the nociceptive balance by Analgesia Nociception Index and Surgical Pleth Index during sevoflurane-remifentanil anesthesia.” Minerva Anesth 2015; 81: 480-9.\n\nA18 Perioperative cardiocirculatory arrest in a young woman with undiagnosed OSAS: a case report\n\nS.

Pilloni\n\nJournal of Anesthesia, Analgesia and Critical Care 2023, 3(Suppl 1):A18\n\nBackground. Obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS) is a frequent pathology: it is estimated that 25% of all patients admitted for elective surgery suffer from OSAS and that more than 80% of them are unaware of it. OSAS is known to be responsible of serious postoperative complications, especially respiratory and cardiovascular, including deaths that are often referred generically to cardiac arrest.1 Guidelines propose decision-making flow charts to manage the most critical aspects of the perioperative path, guiding the screening and identification of patients with suspected OSAS and guiding the planning of pre-, intra- and post-operative care levels.2\n\nCase report. A 35-year-old female with grade I obesity (BMI 35.5) and no other comorbidities underwent videolaparoscopic cholecystectomy. The medical history did not report neither snoring nor daytime sleepiness, and the STOP-Bang questionnaire showed a mild risk for OSAS (score 3).\n\nAccording to the SIAARTI 2019 OSA screening score, she was classified among patients with a mild risk of OSA (score 1), with a BMI > 35 but with gynoid-type obesity, a neck circumference of 37 cm, and a negative SpO2 test (SPO2 >90% in sitting and supine positions). Moreover, the risk associated with the surgical and anesthetic procedures was moderate (interventional procedure under general anesthesia, score 2). Considering these factors, the risk to be attributed to the patient was to be considered not increased (score 3). After the surgical procedure, the patient was discharged to the ward with SpO2 monitoring, and about 10 minutes after discharge she undergoes cardiocirculatory arrest caused by respiratory arrest. ROSC was obtained rapidly and recovery of consciousness as well, without neurological deficits. On the first postoperative day, episodes of arterial desaturation during sleep were observed, and, in the suspicion of OSAS, pneumologist indicated a polysomnography that confirmed a severe OSAS.\n\nConclusions. STOP-Bang questionnaire is a good screening tool, but it does not identify all undiagnosed cases of OSAS. Therefore, even in patients at not-increased/low risk for OSAS, the measurement of SpO2 is useful during the post-operative time especially if the risk associated with the surgical and anesthetic procedures is moderate/high. In these situations, the increased levels of analgesia/sedation can have a negative impact on predisposed patients.\n\nInformed consent to publish had been obtained.\n\nReferences\n\n1.\n\nFouladpour N et al.

Perioperative continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) is advised for moderate/severe OSA to avoid respiratory failure.\n\nObesity Hypoventilation Syndrome [2] is a respiratory consequence of morbid obesity characterized by alveolar hypoventilation during sleep and wakefulness. It involves an interaction between impaired respiratory mechanics, ventilatory drive and sleep-disordered breathing.\n\nAIM\n\nIn our Hospital we currently submit the STOP-BANG questionnaire [3] to all candidates for bariatric surgery, to identify moderate/high risk for OSA in order to direct them to specialistic evaluation and start CPAP treatment. Patients with the clinical features of OHS undergo blood gas analysis: if hypoxemia and hypercapnia (>45mmHg) are present, then CPAP treatment should be considered (Figure 1).\n\nMETHODS\n\nRetrospective observational study (Jan. 2021 - Dec. 2022). 156 adult patients enrolled (M 33, F 123), undergoing laparoscopic bariatric surgery. Mean BMI for women: 40.96 (min 31,56; max 54,11), for men: 41.86 (min 32,53; max 53,07). Of these subjects, 70 (45%) had or received a diagnosis of OSA/OHS, and perioperatively used CPAP (Table 1).\n\nRESULTS\n\nNo patient receiving perioperative CPAP and undergoing LBS (sleeve gastrectomy) had respiratory complications nor showed respiratory issues during the induction of general anesthesia, and none of them was admitted to ICU for postoperative care due to respiratory insufficiency.\n\nCONCLUSIONS\n\nBased on our experience, we can argue that an adequate perioperative ventilation strategy is useful in patients with OHS/OSA candidates for bariatric surgery [4], also for ERAS (Enhanced Recovery After Surgery) protocol applicability [5]. We should preoperatively investigate these pathologies in order to direct patients to the appropriate treatment to minimize the risk of respiratory failure.\n\nInformed consent for the publication of these clinical data has been obtained from the participants.\n\nA20 Perioperative intravenous (I.V.) lidocaine in Laparoscopic Bariatric Surgery (LBS) Improves quality of recovery: an observational retrospective study\n\nC.

Galmarini, Tradate, Italy\n\nCorrespondence: C. Gobbi\n\nJournal of Anesthesia, Analgesia and Critical Care 2023, 3(Suppl 1):A20\n\nBACKGROUND\n\nAs known in the literature, opioids, due to their breath-depressing effect, can be dangerous for obese patients, who often suffer from disorders such as obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) and hypoventilation syndrome (OHS) [1,2,3].\n\nAt recommended doses [4,5], perioperative i.v. lidocaine is considered safe and effective in ensuring adequate pain control in patients undergoing laparoscopic bariatric surgery (LBS), without the aid of opioids [5,6].\n\nAIM\n\nThe present observational retrospective study aims to address the feasibility of opioid free anesthesia OFA with i.v. lidocaine, evaluating its safety and effectiveness in LBS.\n\nMETHODS\n\nClinical data of all patients undergoing LBS at L. Galmarini Hospital (Tradate, Italy) between Jan 2021 and Dec 2022 were retrospectively collected. We entrolled 156 adult patients (M 33, F 123). Mean BMI for women: 40.96 (min 31,56; max 54,11), for men: 41.86 (min 32,53; max 53,07).\n\nWe tested a protocol of opioid free anesthesia OFA using i.v. lidocaine (Figure 1).\n\nAll patients were evaluated in terms of postoperative pain control according to the Numerical Rating Scale (NRS). Adequate control of postoperative pain was considered reached with NRS lower equal to 4 (24/48 hours).\n\nRESULTS\n\nThe protocol used ensured adequate anesthesia and pain control.\n\nOf all patients, 3% did not require post-operative analgesia, 21% required i.v. paracetamol only on the first day at a dose of 1 g every 8 hours, the remaining percentage (76%) required i.v. paracetamol 1g every 8 hours and from 1 to 3 doses of i.v. ketorolac, exclusively during the first day (Graphic 1).\n\nNo adverse effects related to i.v. lidocaine were noted during the perioperative time.\n\nCONCLUSIONS\n\nBased on our experience and supported by the literature, we can state that the use of i.v. lidocaine in LBS seems to be safe and effective in reducing consumption of opioids, improving quality of recovery [5].\n\nThe results obtained (considering the advantages of an opioid free anesthesia OFA, the easy and safe applicability of the protocol, and the reduced adverse effects associated with the use of i.v. lidocaine) encourage further studies.\n\nThe opioid sparing effect of systemic i.v. lidocaine could be a significant criterion to better investigate its efficacy for the applicability of ERAS (Enhanced Recovery After Surgery) protocols [7].\n\nInformed consent for the publication of these clinical data has been obtained from the participants.\n\nA21 Postoperative severe acute pancreatitis after propofol anesthesia: a case report\n\nT.A.

Giacon\n\nJournal of Anesthesia, Analgesia and Critical Care 2023, 3(Suppl 1):A21\n\nCASE REPORT\n\nA 75 years old patient whose characteristics are reported in Table 1 was admitted for a programmed laparotomic radical cystectomy due to bladder cancer.\n\nGeneral anesthesia was obtained with target controlled infusion (TCI) of Propofol with Eleved Model [1], TCI of Remifentanil [2], Midazolam, Ketamine and Rocuronium. Other drugs administered are reported in table 1. The patient remained normothermic and hemodynamically stable, even though due to blood loss > 1 l and anemization he was transfused.\n\nAt awakening the patient was extubated and transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU) for postoperative monitoring with optimal haemodynamic, neurological and antalgic control.\n\nA few hours after the admission in ICU he reported a blunt abdominal pain, mainly on the right side, nausea and the exams showed increased amylase levels, urologists excluded any surgical involvement of pancreatic tissue and suspected a transient sphincter of Oddi dysfunction [3]. After one night in ICU he was transferred to the urology ward due to his clinical stability, even though Amylase peaked at 2340 U/l. Two days later abdominal pain increased to severe, with characteristics of peritonism and increased inflammatory markers. An abdomen-thorax CT scan revealed acute pancreatitis (AP) (Figure 1) and he was transferred to ICU. He started a standard treatment for acute pancreatitis and antibiotic therapy [4].\n\nOn postoperative day nine, due to general deterioration of clinical conditions and further anemization that required blood transfusion, he underwent an emergency laparotomy, in which propofol was not used as an anesthetic drug, that found a completely necrotic pancreas. The following day he faced a multi organ failure (MOF) which rapidly led to death. Consent to publish the case report was accorded by the family.\n\nAcute pancreatitis (AP) Is a complex and severe disease with a high mortality rate [4]. Propofol, is a common anesthetic drug which is widely used in daily practice for sedations and general anesthesia [5], few cases of Propofol Induced AP have been published, in which the diagnosis has been made excluding more common causes [6].\n\nIn fact, Propofol is listed as a possible cause of AP, class Ib, based on the classification of Badalov et al. [7]. Following the scheme proposed by the systematic review by Haffar et al for Propofol induced AP [6] we could confirm that our hypothesis is plausible. He satisfied the American College of Gastroenterology criteria for AP [8,9] and it is classified as severe acute pancreatitis according to the Revised Atlanta Classification with peripancreatic necrotic fluid collection [10]. Marshall score [11] after admission was two and Naranjo et al [12] probability scale for drug adverse reaction was three, meaning that the adverse reaction is possible. Latence according to Badalov et al [7] has been short or intermediate. Exclusion of other plausible causes, timing of pancreatitis symptoms and previous cases in literature support our hypothesis of propofol induced pancreatitis.\n\nInformed consent to publish had been obtained.\n\nA22 SpO2 reduction, methemoglobinemia and generalized bluish skin discoloration following intradermal administration of patent blue v in breast reconstruction with diep flap: a case report\n\nG.

Gazzè\n\nJournal of Anesthesia, Analgesia and Critical Care 2023, 3(Suppl 1):A22\n\nBackground\n\nPatent Blue V (PBV) is used in plastic surgery for sentinel lymph node identification in breast cancers and cutaneous melanomas. Other less allergenic molecules are often preferred over this dye. Currently, propelled by the widespread adoption of lymphatic reconstruction techniques, the use of PBV is strongly re-emerging in clinical practice.\n\nCase report\n\nThe patient of our clinical case report is a 60-year-old woman (ASA 2, no history of allergies) admitted to the plastic surgery unit of the IRCCS -Regina Elena National Cancer Institute, Rome, undergoing removal of the left breast prosthesis, debridement of homolateral axillary scar tissue and total breast reconstruction with bipedicled deep inferior epigastric perforator (DIEP) and lymph node flaps. During the procedure, approximately 30 minutes after the intradermal injection of 2 ml of 2.5% PBV sodium salt (50 mg) in the right lower limb, the patient experienced a slight reduction in SpO2 (from 100% to 96%), unresponsive to increased inspiratory fraction of oxygen, and methemoglobinemia was detected in blood gas analysis (maximum value 4.5%), which did not require any treatment. Additionally, a generalized bluish skin discoloration and bluish-greenish urine were observed. No significant hemodynamic, respiratory or hemogasanalytic changes were observed during the procedure; therefore, the decision was made to continue with the surgical intervention. At the end of surgery, the patient was transferred conscious, alert, and cooperative to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) for postoperative monitoring. The postoperative course in ICU was uneventful and the patient was transferred to the plastic surgery department the following day.\n\nConclusions\n\nThe frequency of allergic reactions to PBV has been estimated to be between 0.2% and 2.7% [1]. Preoperative antiallergic prophylaxis does not prevent anaphylactic reactions but it may reduce their severity.\n\nWhen administering blue dyes, including PVB, the SpO2 value measured by pulse-oximetry may falsely decrease; therefore, in such cases, serial arterial blood gas analysis is recommended to assess any respiratory exchange abnormalities [2]. Blood gas tests may show falsely elevated methemoglobin values when measured by spectrophotometry [3]. False SpO2 values and methemoglobinemia appear to manifest only when their evaluation is performed in the presence of moderate-to-high blood concentrations of blue dyes using the photometric method. Finally, it is worth noting that in a limited number of cases described in the literature, after the administration of Patent Blue V, the appearance of methaemoglobinemia has occurred, which sometimes has also required treatment.\n\nInformed consent to publish had been obtained.\n\nReferences\n\n1.\n\nYusim Y, Livingstone D, Sidi A.

Sciusco\n\nJournal of Anesthesia, Analgesia and Critical Care 2023, 3(Suppl 1):A23\n\nIntroduction\n\nWe aimed to investigate the positive effects of low-flow sevoflurane anesthesia on the emergence and recovery periods in pediatric patients undergoing adenotonsillectomy.\n\nMaterial and Methods\n\nThe study was performed after obtaining informed consent. Sixty children of ASA I-II aged 2-10 years who were scheduled for adenotonsillectomy were included in the study. Patients were randomly assigned to either low-flow anesthesia or high-flow anesthesia. Heart rate, mean arterial pressure, peripheral oxygen saturation, inspiratory oxygen concentration, end-tidal carbon dioxide, and Bispectral index values of the patients were recorded in the operating room. Spontaneous breathing effort and extubation time were recorded while emergence from anesthesia. Heart rate, mean arterial pressure, peripheral oxygen saturation, pain, and agitation scores were also recorded in the recovery room. The day after surgery, the parents were called to investigate whether the unwanted effects occurred.\n\nResults\n\nHemodynamic variables were not different between the groups at all times (p> 0.05). There was no difference between the groups in bispectral index values (p> 0.05). Spontaneous respiration time and extubation time were not different between the groups (p> 0.05). Pain and agitation scores were lower in the low flow group (p <0.05). No side effects were observed in any of the groups. Mean arterial pressure and heart rate were similar between groups in our study. However, both of them were decreased during the operation, although they did not drop lower than normal limits. These decreases might have been due to the effect of sevoflurane on cardiorespiratory reflexes, which seemed to be clinically unimportant. Adverse reactions were not detected in any patient in our study indicating that low flow anesthesia does not increase adverse reactions in low flow sevoflurane anesthesia in children.\n\nThis study has some limitations. One limitation is the number of participants. Although the numbers are enough to compare groups statistically it would be better if the number of participants had been higher. As we performed routinely in our clinic, we assumed that intravenous paracetamol would be enough for the early postoperative period during which we measured severity of pain which may be another limitation of the study. It could be better if we had planned to give rescue analgesia.\n\nConclusion\n\nLow flow anesthesia may reduce emergence delirium and postoperative pain even in short-term operations like adenotonsillectomy with no increase in the incidence of adverse events, and with no change in hemodynamic and respiratory parameters in pediatric patients.\n\nA24 Face mask in the presence of the parents may improve acceptance during inhalation induction induction in pediatric anesthesia\n\nC.

Sciusco\n\nJournal of Anesthesia, Analgesia and Critical Care 2023, 3(Suppl 1):A24\n\nIntroduction\n\nFace masks are commonly used during the induction phase of pediatric anesthesia. The present study investigated whether the use of a mask in the presence of the parents improved mask acceptance before the slow induction of anesthesia in pediatric patients.\n\nMethods\n\nThe study was performed after obtaining informed consent.\n\nThis prospective, randomized controlled trial enrolled patients aged 2–10 years who were scheduled to undergo surgery under general anesthesia. Patients were randomly assigned to mask induction with Air/O2/Sevoflurane without the presence of parents (control group) or in the presence of parents (experimental group). The primary outcome was the mask acceptance score, rated on a validated 4-point from 1 point (not afraid; easily accepts the mask) to 4 points (afraid of a mask; crying or struggling). The secondary outcome was heart rate assessed by pulse oximetry in the pediatric ward before transfer to the operating room (OR), at the entrance to the OR, at the patient notification of mask fitting by the anesthesiologist, and after mask fitting.\n\nResults\n\nSeventy-seven patients were accessed for eligibility, with 67 enrolled in the study: 33 in the experimental group and 34 in the control group. Mask acceptance was significantly greater among patients aged 2–3 years in the experimental than in the control group (p < 0.05) (Figure 1).\n\nThe mask acceptance score was significantly lower in the experimental than in the control group in patient group 1 (p<0.05)\n\nConclusions\n\nThe use of a mask in the presence of parents can improve acceptance before anesthesia induction with a parental presence in pediatric patients aged 2–3 years.\n\nA25 Implementation of a Multimodal Prehabilitation program for patients undergoing major upper gastrointestinal surgery: the preliminary experience of the University of Florence Prehabilitation Center\n\nF.

Firenzuoli\n\nJournal of Anesthesia, Analgesia and Critical Care 2023, 3(Suppl 1):A25\n\nBackground\n\nMultimodal Prehabilitation (MP) before major upper gastrointestinal surgery has shown to improve preoperative functional capacity (FC) and facilitate surgical recovery [1]. Neoadjuvant therapy (NAT), frequently indicated for these patients, is associated with loss of lean body mass (LBM) and deterioration of FC [2]. This cohort study aims at describing the preliminary experience of the University of Florence MP program recently implemented as standard of care for these patients.\n\nMaterial and Methods\n\nFrom May 2022 to May 2023, high-risk patients were referred to the University of Florence MPC, in preparation for their surgery. The six-Minute Walking Test, the Fried physical frailty criteria, Patient-Generated Subjective Global Assessment (PG-SGA), bioimpedentiometry, and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale were used to assess physical, nutritional, and psychological status. A personalized MP program was then prescribed for at least 4 weeks, and patients revaluated before and 30 and 90 days after surgery. MP consisted of medical, functional, nutritional, and psychological optimization, including correction of preoperative anemia, optimization of geriatric conditions, and a smoking cessation interventions.\n\nResults\n\nSixty-two patients were referred to the MPC. Of these, 24 received the intended surgical intervention. Eighteen patients (75%) received NAT (chemotherapy n=14, chemo-radiation n=4) (Table 1).\n\nMP characteristics and interventions are reported in (Table 2).\n\nOverall, there was a clinically meaningful improvement [3] of preoperative FC (six-minutes waking distance, 6MWD), more pronounced in patients who received NAT (Figure 1).\n\nSimilarly, preoperative LBM increased; this improvement was mainly driven by an increment of LBM in patients treated with NAT (Figure 1). Compared to baseline, FC decreased after surgery, but return above baseline 90 days after surgery. In contrast, there was a postoperative loss of LBM up to 90 days after surgery. The proportion of sarcopenic, frailty and malnourished patients after MP decreased (baseline vs preoperative: 29% vs 17%, 21% vs 8%, 92% vs 33%, respectively). However, the proportion of anemic patients increased (Figure 2).\n\nConclusions\n\nMP improved preoperative FC and LBM in oncologic patients undergoing major upper gastrointestinal surgery. FC was maintained throughout the perioperative period, despite the loss of LBM that persisted up to 90 days after surgery. Moreover, in patients treated with NAT, MP prevented the loss of function and LBM commonly observed after NAT. Finally, MP modified several preoperative risk factors associated with postoperative morbidity, mortality and poor functional recovery.\n\nReferences\n\n1.\n\nMinnella EM, Awasthi R, Loiselle SE, Agnihotram RV, Ferri LE, Carli F.

Del Santo\n\nJournal of Anesthesia, Analgesia and Critical Care 2023, 3(Suppl 1):A26\n\nBackground\n\nRapid sequence induction (RSI) is an anesthesia technique for tracheal intubation in patients at high risk of aspiration of gastric content. As manual ventilation is not recommended in RSI, pre-oxygenation is a fundamental strategy to ensure an adequate period of safe apnea [1]. The current standard for pre-oxygenation entails spontaneous facemask ventilation (FM) delivering a fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 100% at 15 L/min flow such as to reach an end tidal O2 (EtO2) of at least 90% prior to the administration of induction medications and myorelaxants. The use of High Flow Nasal Oxygen (HFNO) may offer some advantages over the standard technique [2].\n\nPatients and methods\n\nAfter obtaining informed consent, patients undergoing anesthesia with indication for RSI were randomized for FM or HFNO. Patients belonging to the FM-group were pre-oxygenated with an anesthesia mask for 5 minutes (15 L/min, FiO2 of 1). After the anesthesia induction, the mask was left in place during the apnea time and removed during the intubation. Patients of the HFNO-group were pre-oxygenated for 5 minutes with HFNO at 40 L/min and FiO2 1. Oxygen flow was increased to 70 l/min after the anesthesia induction and the cannula was left in place during the apnea time and the intubation (figure 1).\n\nPaO2, PaCO2, SpO2 and oxygen reserve index (ORi) were measured before, at 5 minutes of pre-oxygenation and immediately after intubation. Apnea time was measured in each patient. The variables considered were compared. For each patient, the variation of PaO2 and PaCO2 during apnea was related to the apnea time to obtain and compare the mean variation per second during apnea of these variables.\n\nResults\n\nWe enrolled 50 patients and randomized 25 for each group. There was no difference in the baseline patient characteristics and basal SpO2, PaO2 and PaCO2. Patients in the HFNO group showed a lower decrease in PaO2 during the apnea time (p=0.0009). In a sub-population with apnea time greater than 300 seconds, PaO2 at intubation was significantly higher in the HFNO group (p=0.046) than in FM-group. Differently, there were no differences between the two groups in PaCO2 (table 1-2).\n\nConclusions\n\nHFNO might increase the safe apnea compared to the standard method for the pre-oxygenation of patients undergoing RSI offering additional safety especially when the intubation procedure needs more time. In addition, ORi can be a useful non-invasive monitoring of the patient oxygen status during RSI. There was no evidence in CO2 clearance under HFNO.\n\nReferences\n\n1.\n\nEl-Orbany M, Connolly LA.

This is detected at the splanchnic level in children undergoing corrective surgery for craniostenosis.\n\nThe main purpose of this study is to identify timely transfusion indications. 2\n\nThe study also aims to evaluate any correlations between sSO2 and metabolic acidosis markers such as lactate and base excess.\n\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\n\nThis no profit observational study involves the Catholic University of the Sacred Heart as the sole participating center.\n\nAn INVOS oximeter ( Somanetics, Troy, USA) was used for the study.\n\nThis instrument emits light at two wavelengths (730 and 810 nm) in order to measure the concentration of oxygenated and deoxygenated hemoglobin in the microcirculation.\n\nThe study examines nineteen patients ages less than 15 months, weighing less than 10 kg, undergoing cranioplasty procedures for the correction of primary craniostenosis. All these patients had a postoperative course in the Pediatric Intensive Care Unit (PICU). Patients with known comorbidities and/or suffering from syndromic craniosynostosis (Crouzon syndrome, Pfeiffer syndrome or Apert syndrome) were excluded from the study.\n\nAll patients included in the study underwent the same anesthetic protocol. Plasma expanders were used to replace the lost blood volume. Albumin 5 % was administered in boluses at the initial dose of 20 ml/kg, which could be adjusted according to blood loss.\n\nConversely, concentrated red blood cells were administered when signs and symptoms of hypoperfusion were observed, considering a hemoglobin cutoff value of 7 g/dL.\n\nAt the end of the surgery, the patients were transferred to the Pediatric Intensive Care Unit (PICU), for postoperative monitoring and management of the surgical case.\n\nRESULTS\n\nData were analyzed using the median and quartiles as the distribution was non-normal (non-Gaussian). From the data analysis, a linear regression was performed between the absolute value (a.v.) values of regional oxygen saturation (rSO2) and hemoglobin (Hb), revealing a significant but weak linear relationship (p=0.001, r2=0.15). On the other hand, the correlation between rSO2 and lactate levels and base excess (BE) values was not statistically significant (p value = 0.97).\n\nCONCLUSIONS\n\nNIRS has proven to be a non-invasive method that could provide valid data for the correct management of perioperative anesthesia. In the pediatric field we could have great benefits in terms of blood saving strategies.\n\nREFERENCES\n\n1.\n\nJobsis FF.

Barbani 1, F. Livi 1, T. Piazzini 3, S. Romagnoli 1, G.

Cocci\n\nJournal of Anesthesia, Analgesia and Critical Care 2023, 3(Suppl 1):A28\n\nBackground: Prehabilitation (PreHab) refers to individualized preoperative interventions aiming at improving preoperative functional capacity and optimize modifiable risk factors to better overcome surgical stress and better recover to daily activities1. Measuring adherence to a medical intervention is essential for accurately determining its efficacy. It is unclear how adherence to PreHab is currently measured and reported. The aim of this systematic review is to determine how PreHab adherence is measured and reported, and if possible, determine whether high adherence rates are associated with better outcomes.\n\nMaterials and methods: PRISMA guidelines for systematic reviews were followed. Medline, Embase, Cochrane Library databases were searched for Randomized Controlled Trial, Clinical Trial, and retrospective studies, from January 1999 to March 2023, and that evaluated PreHab interventions in adult patients awaiting for major or moderate elective surgery. As there is no standardized and unambiguous definition of PreHab, it was decided to search and include trials evaluating any unimodal preoperative intervention including physical exercise, nutritional, and cognitive/psychological support, or multimodal interventions combining at least 2 of the forementioned treatments. Only preoperative treatments that started at least 7 days before surgery were included. Studies aiming at optimizing individual surgical risk factors, such as smoking cessation or anemia were excluded. Included studies were analyzed to investigate 1) how adherence to PreHab interventions was reported and defined 2) the association between adherence to PreHab and preoperative and postoperative outcomes.\n\nResults: Of the 21.313 studies identified from Medline, 246 studies were included for the analysis. PreHab was unimodal in 210 studies (exercise-based PreHab n=127, nutrition-based PreHab n=47, and psychological PreHab n= 36) and multimodal in 36 studies (Table 1).\n\nDifferent type of prehabilitation interventions were identified (Figure 1).\n\nOverall, adherence to PreHab was reported in 125 of the studies included (50.8%). Of these, 103 (82.4%) defined it. Multimodal PreHab studies that reported adherence to each component of the multimodal intervention prescribed were only 8 (40%); when not entirely reported, adherence to the exercise intervention was the most reported. Parameters used to define adherence were frequency (n=92), intensity/dose (n=1) or duration (n=2) relatively to the PreHab prescription. Sixteen trials used more than 1 of these parameters to define adherence to PreHab (Figure 2).\n\nDue to the high degree of heterogeneity in defining and reporting PreHab adherence it was not possible to assess and establish whether high rates of Prehab adherence are associated with better outcomes.\n\nConclusions: these preliminary results show that PreHab adherence was not reported in half of the study identified. It was mainly reported describing the frequency of the intervention, relatively to PreHab parameters prescribed. Due to a high degree of heterogeneity defining and reporting PreHab adherence, it was not possible to establish its association with postoperative outcomes. Future studies should better define and report adherence to PreHab, not only describing how frequent the intervention occurred, but also assessing if the intensity/dose and the duration of the intervention are achieved. This will help to better understand the efficacy of PreHab.\n\nReferences\n\n1.\n\nCarli F. Prehabilitation for the Anesthesiologist.

We used Hemosphere platform (Edwards Lifesciences, Irvine-California, USA, AcumenIQ sensor) as hemodynamic monitor in both groups. In the Control group, we administered fluids and vasoactive drugs based on Stroke Volume Variation (SVV) and Mean Arterial Pressure (MAP) changes. For the Intervention group, in fluid responders patients, we gave fluid or vasoactive drugs administration according to arterial dynamic Elastance (Eadyn), added to the treatment algorithm. The primary endpoint was the lactate levels at the end of surgery. Secondary endpoints were fluid amount, vasoactive drugs usage and clinical and surgical postoperative complications.\n\nResults: Fourty-six patients were analyzed. No differences beetween the two groups have been noticed in lactate levels at the end of surgery (control group Lac 2.5 mmol/L vs intervention group 2.6 mmol/L p=0.63). The preoperative and intraoperative variables significantly associated with anastomotic leak were: hemodynamic protocol (rho= -0.546; p=0.071), preoperative albumin (rpbi=-0.373; p=0.011), preoperative hemoglobin (rpbi= -0.516; p=0.0001) and total crystalloids amount (rpbi= -0.560; p=0.0001). A logistic regression showed that preoperative hemoglobin (p=0.025) was the only independent predictor of anastomotic leak (Log-Likelihood=-10.01; Likelihood Ratio chi2 =28.14; p<0.0001) (fig. 4). Post-regression receiver operating characteristic analysis (ROC) showed an area under ROC curve of 0.88 and there was a significant association between anastomotic leak and hospital length of stay (rpbi=0.692; p<0.0001).\n\nConclusions: the addition of arterial dynamic elastance to hemodynamic protocol did not change the lactate levels at the end of major abdominal surgery but it produced a significant effect on fluid balance and vasoactive drugs.\n\nA30 Clevidipine and inhibition of hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction: a case report\n\nE.

Bertoli\n\nJournal of Anesthesia, Analgesia and Critical Care 2023, 3(Suppl 1):A30\n\nBackground\n\nClevidipine is a new intravenous calcium channel blocker with favourable pharmacokinetic properties approved for perioperative management of hypertension. We described a case of reversible hypoxemia caused by clevidipine-induced pulmonary vasodilatation in a patient who developed hypertension after abdominal surgery. Written informed consent for the publication was obtained by the patient.\n\nCase report\n\nA 62-year-old man was admitted in our ICU after gastrectomy for spontaneous gastric rupture. His medical history revealed systemic artery hypertension in medical treatment. After weaning from mechanical ventilation and extubation, the patient was treated with high-flow nasal cannula for hypoxemia due to postoperative bilateral lung consolidations diagnosed by computerized tomography. The respiratory function gradually improved until reaching a PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 250 mmHg. The following clinical course was complicated by onset of severe hypertension (190/100 mmHg). Because of esophago-jejunal anastomotic leakage, the patient could not assume oral medications, so we decided to start intravenous clevidipine with a prompt control of pressure (140/80 mmHg) at infusion rate of 2 mg/h. However, immediately after initiation of clevidipine’s infusion the patient developed hypoxemia (PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 130 mmHg). The echographic lung examination excluded new causes of hypoxemia (pneumothorax, pulmonary edema) but confirmed bilateral consolidations similar to previous computerized tomography control. A bedside transthoracic echocardiogram did not revealed right heart dilatation or intracardiac shunting. Having ruled out other obvious causes of hypoxemia, we hypothesized that the clevidipine inhibition of hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction (an important compensation mechanism in our patient in consideration of his bilateral lung consolidations) magnified pulmonary shunt and it was the probable explanation of sudden hypoxemia. In fact the following discontinuation of the drug infusion promptly resolved hypoxemia and the patient reached a PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 250 mmHg. We reported this case as a suspected adverse drug reaction.\n\nConclusion\n\nBased on our case report and analogue ones described in literature [1], we suggest that clinicians must be aware of the possibility of hypoxemia during clevidipine infusion. The probable/possible mechanism involved is the shunt due to clevidipine-induced pulmonary vasodilatation like other dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers [2]. We believe that clevidipine infusion should be used carefully in patients with hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction.\n\nReferences\n\nA)\n\nShort JH, Fatemi P, Ruoss S.

Battista\n\nJournal of Anesthesia, Analgesia and Critical Care 2023, 3(Suppl 1):A31\n\nBackground\n\nHigh-Flow Nasal Cannula Oxygenation (HFNCO) is an open-loop oxygenation system that uses flows of up to 70 L/min of 100% oxygen through the Optiflow THRIVE TM apparatus (Fisher and Paykel Healthcare Ltd, Auckland, New Zealand), increasingly used as an alternative to tracheal intubation in patients undergoing short-term general anesthesia.\n\nThe efficacy of HFNCO in apnoic patients undergoing laryngeal surgery is debated: on the one hand it allows minimal manipulation of the airways, it expands the surgical field and it proved to be not inferior to tracheal intubation in maintaining oxygen saturation, on the other, it has been associated with a higher incidence of hypercarbia, acidosis and need for rescue maneuvers of airway management.\n\nMethods\n\nPatients aged 18 to 69 years, American Society of Anaesthesiologists (ASA) status I and II undergoing laryngeal microsurgery under general anesthesia and neuromuscular blockade were randomized to either apnoic oxygenation (THRIVE group) or tracheal intubation (Control group).\n\nPrimary aim will be evaluation of changes in frontal cerebral tissue oxygen saturation (SctO 2 ) through Near-Infrared Spectroscopy (NIRS) technology in the two groups. Secondary objectives will be the noninferiority of THRIVE compared to tracheal intubation in term of success rate of the technique. Success rate will be defined as partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO 2) <= 65 mmHg and/or peripheral oxygen saturation (SpO 2 ) >= 94% throughout the procedure in the absence of\n\nadverse events.\n\nResults\n\nFirst 10 patients of 30 expected at completion of the study were included in this preliminary analysis.\n\nPatients characteristics are listed in Table 1;\n\nno significant differences were observed in both groups. Median (IQR) surgery and anesthesia duration, as well as baseline StcO 2, SpO 2, PaCO 2 and hemodynamic parameters were comparable between the two groups (Table 2).\n\nFor the primary outcome StcO 2 values were significantly different and higher in the THRIVE group compared to the Control group, consistently with the higher flows of O 2 received (mixed-effect linear regression model, P < 0.001).\n\nFor the secondary outcome, success rate of THRIVE was 60% compared to 100% for tracheal intubation. No patient in both groups showed SpO 2 <= 94%; median (IQR) peak PaCO 2 was 61 (60, 61) mmHg in the THRIVE group compared to 43 (41, 45) mmHg in the Control group. Two (40%) patients reached PaCO 2 levels > 65 mmHg and 100% of patients in the THRIVE group developed transient respiratory acidosis with no hemodynamic instability during surgery compared to none in the Control group.\n\nNo patient in both group reported dyspnoea at the end of anesthesia; no complication occurred during hospital stay and all patients were discharged on first postoperative day.\n\nConclusion\n\nTHRIVE oxygenation should be used with cautious monitoring during laryngeal microsurgery under general anesthesia and neuromuscular blockade. THRIVE was successful in maintaining oxygen saturation but incidence of hypercarbia and transient respiratory acidosis were more frequent during HFNCO compared with tracheal intubation.\n\nA32 Systematic review about improvement strategies for the prevention of postoperative AKI in elderly patients undergoing major surgery\n\nL.

Baccari\n\nJournal of Anesthesia, Analgesia and Critical Care 2023, 3(Suppl 1):A32\n\nBackground\n\nAcute kidney injury (AKI) is a well-known and frequent complication in elderly patients after major surgery, causing significant morbidity and mortality, as well as increased health care costs. AKI is a frequent complication in elderly surgical population because it presents a reduced renal functional reserve. While preoperative AKI risk factors (hypertension, diabetes mellitus, known chronic kidney disease) and pathophysiological mechanisms of AKI are well understood, the management of perioperative AKI is still a matter of debate because the therapeutic interventions are often implemented late, particularly only after clinical evidence of decreased urine output, elevated serum creatinine levels or decreased glomerular filtration rate. In any case, all the delayed therapeutic approaches act on already existing organ damage.\n\nMaterials and methods\n\nThis systematic literature review aims to identify relevant literature from 2010 to 2022, published on the English-language PubMed database, gathering quantitative, qualitative and mixed information. The inclusion criteria of the studies examined were based on the collection of AKI prevention strategies to reduce morbidity and mortality in elderly patients undergoing major surgery.\n\nResults\n\nBased on the inclusion criteria, 143 articles were identified including 32 review articles, 18 systematic reviews, 31 randomized trials, 28 meta-analyses, 14 case-control studies, 32 clinical trials of which 18 were multicentres.\n\nThe scientific literature reviewed identified preoperative, intraoperative, and postoperative strategies for meaningful prevention of AKI. Among the preoperative ones literature detects:1. evaluation of the pharmacological therapy that the elderly patient takes with particular attention to NSAIDs and ACE inhibitors;2. preoperative fluid therapy plan which must aim at a hydrated and euvolemic patient; 3. encourage patients to drink clear fluids up to 2 hours before induction of general anesthesia. Among the intraoperative strategies, literature detects: 1. goal direct fluid therapy guided by hemodynamic monitoring with study of the patient's reactivity to fluids; 2. hemodynamic stability with MAP > 65 mmHg; 3. use of crystalloids and balanced hydroelectrolyte solutions and reduction of physiological solutions to 0.9%; 4. close monitoring of intraoperative blood glucose, avoiding excessive glycemic variability. Among the postoperative ones:1. postoperative fluid therapy plan with the aim of avoiding postoperative hypotension 2. avoiding the use of contrast media 3. early oral fluid intake 4. function monitoring. Furthermore,the scientific literature has shown that efforts should also be focused on early diagnosis through the use of point of care.\n\nConclusions\n\nThe scientific literature has demonstrated that efforts should be focused on prevention through preoperative, intraoperative and postoperative strategies in association with an early diagnosis of AKI. The KDIGO Care Bundle will be guided by careful monitoring of renal function through the traditional markers of renal function (serum creatinine, eGRF and diuresis),but also through the use of urinary and blood biomarkers which allow for the diagnosis of stress before organ damage has occurred: Insulin-like growth factor binding protein 7 (IGFBP) and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-2 are two urinary biomarkers of cell cycle arrest that can be used to predict risk of developing AKI after major surgery (AKI risk assessment), Proenkephalin A119-159, neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL), interleukin-18, proteinCbinding factor and soluble thrombomodulin.\n\nA33 To be or not to be: a score for the evaluation of surgical and intensive care pathway in the perioperative multi-organ oncological patient\n\nL.

Andresciani\n\nJournal of Anesthesia, Analgesia and Critical Care 2023, 3(Suppl 1):A33\n\nIntroduction\n\nMultiorgan oncological patient’s therapeutic pathway needs usually both surgical complex techniques and anesthesiologic and intensive-care support due to provide its effectiveness; in this specific setting, also the choice of a mild-high risk surgical approach could be challenged according to patient’s clinical conditions.\n\nMoreover, current literature lack in evaluation’s score useful for the whole perioperative period’s assessment: this need creation and validation of a new tool, named PERIDIA-score, developed by a multidisciplinary team, from the Cancer Institute Giovanni Paolo II in Bari.\n\nPrimary Data acquired from PERIDIA01-study, a retrospective-perspective and still ongoing study, showed the cut-off of 13.5/48 points for complications’ onset (1) with a good sensitivity and specificity; statistical analysis performed on a larger sample strongly confirmed this cut-off and strengthened the idea of its predictivity role in the decision-making process.\n\nMaterials and methods\n\nA cohort of 199 patients who underwent elective, non-palliative, turaco-abdominal-peri diaphragmatic-sovramesocolic surgery in the surgical ward of our Institute and who needed Post-Operative ICU care was extracted from the 2018-2019 data collection.\n\nAccording to previous investigation, a ROC analysis was accomplished to confirm both comprehensive PERIDIA-score’s and PERIDIA-partials’ (PERIDIA pre, intra and post) predictability. The same methodology was also applied to single items for their significance assessment and to the sum of PERIDIA-pre and intra for their complications’ onset predictivity evaluation.\n\nFinally, a multivariate logistic regression was implemented which underlined the most significant items.\n\nResults\n\nPrimary results highlighted a quite good score’s predictivity of complications’ occurrence during surgical ward stay (NPV 0.765 and AUC 0.805). Also, the ROC analysis performed on the PERIDIA score in the pre intensive period (expressed as PERIDIA-pre + PERIDIA-intra) showed good predictivity value with a threshold of 12.5/32 points for complications’ onset in post-operative ICU stay (NPV 0.722, AUC 0.749).\n\nMoreover, the multivariate logistic regression performed on this sample confirmed statistical significance of HR and Breathing but underlined Frailty as potentially significant item in predicting complications’ onset instead of Nutritional Status.\n\nDiscussion\n\nThe overall PERIDIA score showed quite good complications’ predictivity for oncological patient in this surgical setting; therefore, this data could support the score application in clinical practice as a useful evaluation’s tool of the whole care pathway in the specific setting of cancer patient.\n\nMoreover, the predictivity of pre intensive PERIDIA could be focused as a guide to support some clinical choice and to achieve tailored treatments in post-operative ICU.\n\nThus, future steps of this work require single items’ improvement of each assessment (pre intra and post operative phase) to increase their significance and strengthen the overall score’s predictivity, also suggesting a possible role in the decision-making process not only for peri diaphragmatic sovramesocolic oncological surgery, but also for major oncological surgery pathway.\n\nEthical Approvement\n\nThe study was reviewed and approved by the Ethic Committee of IRCCS Istituto Tumori Giovanni Paolo II- Bari, Italy (Prot.

Trimarchi\n\nJournal of Anesthesia, Analgesia and Critical Care 2023, 3(Suppl 1):A34\n\nBackground. 83-year-old patient, BMI 31, history of hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, aortic-myocardial disease, mild mitral and aortic insufficiency, chest pain exacerbated efforts for about 8 years, in treatment with Prasugrel and Cardio-Asa, reaches the Emergency Department for angina/dyskinetic symptoms, with diagnosis of NSTEMI. Blood chemistry tests show elevation of specific myocardial enzymes: Troponin T 966 pg/ml, Myoglobin 151 ng/ml. Performs coronarography that highlights severe obstructive, calcific and coronary disease, with critical stenosis of the common trunk, multiple critical stenosis in the proximal and middle anterior descending artery and the first marginal branch. During the stay he presents intestinal obstruction from paralytic ileum on left crural hernia clogged, painful and not reducible manually. The surgical evaluation indicates the treatment in an unavoidable emergency by vascular compression of the loops in prison.\n\nCase Report: The patient arrived in S.O. alert and collaborating, in spontaneous breath, VAS 5. HR 92 b/min, NIBP 145/75 mmHg, spo2 94%. Signed the informed consent, we proceed to Trasversus Abdominis Plane Block (TAP block anterior) to anesthetic dosage, performed by ultrasound with linear probe with ultrasonic needle 100 mm, made difficult by large abdominal meteorism. Fast-acting local anaesthetics (AL) (Mepivacaine 1%, 20 ml) and long-acting anaesthetics (Ropivacaine 5%, 20 ml) were used and 4 mg of dexamethasone and 70 mcg of clonidine were added as adjuvants to increase the duration of the sensory block. Verified the effectiveness of the block with both tactile and pain stimulation, the surgeon proceeds with the repair of crural hernoplasty with open technique. Patient alert and collaborating, in spontaneous eupnoic breath in ambient air enriched in O2 through nasal goggles with FiO2 28%. Hr 84 b/min, NIBP 145/75 mmHg, spo2 97%. VAS 3 despite viscera manipulation and numerous attempts at manual bowel reduction. At the end of the procedure, the patient is returned to UTIC for the rest of the stay.\n\nConclusions. Because of the patient’s comorbidities both neuroaxial and general anesthesia would have required hospitalization in an intensive/resuscitation environment for the risk of massive intra or post-operative cardiac failure. With the single execution of the TAP block the disconfort of the patient was derisory, tied mostly to the manipulation of the intestinal loops, than to the surgical act itself. At 24 hours from the procedure, the patient was hemodynamic stability, with VAS 1, without request for analgesics in the postoperative stay, treatable abdomen with the presence of peristalsis.\n\nInformed consent to publication was obtained together with consent to the anesthesiology procedure.\n\nA35 Case report: subarachnoid anesthesia with the use of ropivacaine in a pediatric patient with favism\n\nU.

In these subjects the first reaction of the pentose phosphate pathway is not carried out efficiently, resulting in a lack of NADPH (Nicotinamide-Adenine-Dinucleotide-Phosphate).\n\nPatients with G6PD deficiency can be very sensitive and vulnerable to oxidative stress caused by ingestion of broad beans, some drugs, infections, metabolic imbalances. with clinical manifestations such as haemolytic anemia in adults and severe jaundice in newborns.\n\nCLINICAL CASE\n\nPatient of 16 years, female, weight 55 kg, affected by favism, with surgical indication for umbilical hernioplasty.\n\nIt was decided to practice subarachnoid anesthesia, performed with a 27G Withacre needle at the L2-L3 level, with Ropivacaine 12 mg in a volume of 2.2 ml since general anesthesia in these patients often makes it difficult to identify a haemolytic crisis because symptoms such as hypotension, could be attributed to other causes.\n\nFurthermore drugs such as Isoflurane, Sevoflurane and Bupivacaine are able to inhibit the G6PDH enzyme in vitro as well as Benzodiazepines; for this reason its use is not recommended.\n\nDuring the operation, the vital parameters were always stable and normal. The surgery was performed with excellent compliance on the part of the little patient and the duration of anesthesia was estimated to be more than two hours. The post-operative course was also free from complications and the patient was discharged from the hospital on the third day.\n\nUpon discharge, the patient was provided with the telephone number to contact the anesthesiologist in case of problems since the haemolytic crisis can occur up to 7 days. after anesthesia.\n\nDISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS\n\nThe most effective perioperative management strategy is to prevent hemolysis by avoiding general anesthesia and bupivacaine in the subarachnoid if possible. For postoperative pain, it is advisable to use codeine/codeine derivatives, fentanyl and ketamine.\n\nCONFLICTS OF INTEREST\n\nNone of the authors have conflicts of interest.\n\nInformed consent to publish had been obtained\n\nReferences\n\n1.\n\nCicvaric A et al.: Management of Anesthesia and Perioperative Procedures in a Child with Glucose-6-Phosphate Dehydrogenase Deficiency - J Clin Med . 2022\n\n2.\n\nC L Smith, et al.: Anesthesia and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency.

Piccione\n\nJournal of Anesthesia, Analgesia and Critical Care 2023, 3(Suppl 1):A36\n\nBackground\n\nAs surgical techniques and pharmacology advance, pain management in orthopedic surgery patients continues to evolve [1]. Multimodal analgesic regimens that target numerous pain pathways may provide the best pain management and reduce opioid use and related side effects [2]. Adjuvants in spinal anesthesia have been used to prolong the quality and duration of its effect, including analgesic one [3,4]. This study aims to prove that intrathecal injections of Midazolam, binding gamma-aminobutyric acid-A (GABAA) receptors in the spinal cord, lead to the potentiation of analgesia.\n\nMaterials and methods\n\nThis is a retrospective comparative study performed at the Department of Orthopedics and Traumatology of the AOU Federico II in Naples, Italy. Data about patients who underwent spinal anesthesia between September 2022 and April 2023 were retrieved from the department's archive. Inclusion criteria were patients scheduled for elective major orthopedic surgery with spinal anesthesia, aged from 18 years on with a body mass index of 18 – 45 kg/m2 and an American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status classification of I to IV. After obtaining informed consent, patients were clustered into two groups: “Midazolam group” (12 mg Bupivacaine + 150 μg Morphine + 2 mg Midazolam) and “Control group” (12mg Bupivacaine + 150 μg Morphine). In both groups, postoperative pain management included the administration of 1 g intravenous Paracetamol every 8 hours and as rescue analgesia (VAS greater than or equal to 5) 30 mg Ketorolac or, in renal impairment, 10 mg Oxycodone. The study's primary outcome was postoperative pain estimated with Visual Analogue Scale (VAS)[5]. Postoperative pain, itching, nausea, and vomiting were assessed immediately after (T0) the end of the surgery and then after 6 (T6), 12 (T12), 18 (T18), and 24 hours (T24). Furthermore, the level of intraoperative sedation with the Richmond Agitation-Sedation Scale (RASS) were evaluated [6].\n\nResults\n\nIn the selected cohort, 20 (57%) patients were included in the Midazolam group (MG) and 15 (43%) patients in the Control group (CG). Average VAS scores were slightly lower in MG (3 at T18) than in CG (4 at T18) (Figure 1). Only 15% of the patients needed rescue analgesia. The level of intraoperative sedation was the same in both groups. The incidence of itching was 30% in both groups, while the incidence of nausea and vomiting was 35% in MG and 40% in CG.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe addition of intrathecal midazolam didn’t lead to statistically significant differences in the management of postoperative pain. The adjuvant neither produce an increase in the level of intraoperative sedation, nor a decrease of the incidence of side effects.\n\nReferences\n\n1.\n\nGiesa, M., Jage, J., & Meurer, A. (2006).

Various methods have been used to ensure clear visibility during surgery but controlled hypotensive anesthesia is still the most effective method. However, risks associated with reduction in cardiac output and cerebral perfusion which could result in serious cardiovascular events.\n\nClevidipine is an ultrashort-acting intravenous dihydropyridine that inhibits L-type calcium channels with high clearance, low distribution and a rapid shift to inactive metabolites by blood esterases. It was developed for short-term intravenous control of blood pressure through a selective effect on arterioles(2).\n\nThe purpose of our study is to provide the efficacy and safety of clevidipine to maintain controlled hypotension during shoulder arthroscopy in beach chair position in patients undergoing regional anesthesia and sedation.\n\nMaterials and Methods: The study is an open label, interventional study. All patients undergoing shoulder arthroscopy are eligible. Informed consent was collected. Interscalenic US-guided brachial plexus block and sedation (Propofol 0.5 mg/Kg/h) are administered. Information regarding clevidipine include the initial infusion rate, the average infusion rate, and the duration of administration. Hemodynamic information include the MAP, HR and NIRS (to evaluate cerebral oxygenation) during clevidipine infusion. Data were collected every 15 minutes.\n\nResults: 8 patients were enrolled, age 52-76 years. Clevidipine infusion was started at 4 ml/h and tritrated until a target MAP of 60-65 mmHg was reached. The average maintenance infusion rate was 6.9 ml/h.\n\nWe found a significant reduction in MAP equal to an average of 20 mmHg from baseline, with no significant changes in HR and NIRS.\n\nIntraoperative clevidipine infusion was stopped in 2 patients for excessive hypotension, with resetting of MAP and NIRS to baseline values almost 15 minutes after discontinuation. In one of these there was a significant decrease in NIRS (from 61 to 48), without neurological syntoms.\n\nConclusion: Clevidipine results effective and safe in maintaining controlled hypotension during shoulder arthroscopy without significant decreases in NIRS. Its haemodinamic profile allows arteriolar vasodilation without action on venous vasculature, thus maintaining cardiac output that is already reduced by the beach chair position. Both the onset and offset of action on MAP are rapid. These are preliminar results since only a few patients are enrolled in the study at this time, so further enrollments are necessary to confirm our data.\n\nReferences\n\n(1)\n\nKim JY, Song SH, Cho JH, Cho HR.
