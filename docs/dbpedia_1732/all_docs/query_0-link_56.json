        "text": "25.1 Autoimmunity\n\nRudolf Gruber, Lothar Thomas\n\n25.1.1 Mechanisms of autoimmunity\n\nThe critical function of the immune system is to discriminate self from non self. Tolerance against self-antigens is a highly regulated process and, in order to maintain it, the immune system must be able to distinguish self-reactive lymphocytes as they develop /1/.\n\nA dynamic process of self-nonself discrimination is the basis of immune tolerance.Two distinctive types of immune cells, T and B cells are the hallmark of antigen-specific adaptive immunity. T cells orchestrate immune responses /30/:\n\ndirectly, by killing foreign and infected tissues through cellular and soluble mediators.\n\nindirectly by providing soluble and and membrane-associated signals that promote the survival, expansion, and differentiation of B cells.\n\nIn a parallel system regulatory Tcells (Tregs) recognize self-peptides, and when activated, control self-reactive pathogenic T cells. This complex, dynamic process of self-nonself discrimination is the basis of immune tolerance.\n\nT cells recognize foreign antigens through a unique, highly diverse set of T cell receptors designed to mediate immunity without collateral damage of destroying native tissues.\n\nFailure of self-tolerance and defective elimination and control of self-reactive lymphocytes are the fundamental abnormalities in autoimmune diseases. However, it is generally accepted that autoimmune diseases are the result of a complex interaction between genetic and environmental factors, most of which have not been identified /2/.\n\nAutoimmune diseases\n\nFrom a pathogenetic point of view autoimmune diseases are characterized by a chronic activation of the immune system, which leads to tissue inflammation. The innate immune system activates the adaptive immune response which, in turn, is responsible for the inflammatory process /3/.\n\nA significant clinical problem of autoimmune diseases are /2/:\n\nTheir prevalence in the younger population\n\nThe chronic nature\n\nDiseases vary greatly in the organs they affect and in their clinical manifestation\n\nSome being limited to particular tissues and others being systemic or disseminated\n\nMost patients present with clinical disease during the propagation phase, which is characterized by progressive inflammation and tissue damage\n\nIt is often difficult to evaluate the factors responsible for the initiation of disease\n\nPatients may carry antibodies many years before they manifest clinical symptoms\n\nIn autoimmune diseases a large number of antibodies in serum are directed against structures and functional components of the cell e.g., nucleic acid, nuclear molecular receptors and components of the cytoplasm can be detected. The antibodies play an important role in the diagnosis and differentiation of the autoimmune disorders. They were considered synonymous of autoimmune disease, but that is not always the case, because other conditions are associated with their presence e.g., acute tissue damage and cancer /3/.\n\nIdentified auto antigens are /3/:\n\nDNA molecules and the bound histones\n\nAnti histone antibodies directed against H2A and H2B\n\nAnti-centromere (expressed or activated during specific phases of the cell cycle)\n\nAuto epitopes of the nucleus , called extractable nuclear antigens (ENA)\n\nAnti Scl70 antibodies directed against topoisomerase\n\nAnti-Sm, snRNPs, SSB and SSA antibodies found in SjÃ¶grenâs syndrome.\n\nThe prevalence of systemic and organ specific autoimmune diseases in the population is 3â5%. This includes common diseases such as diabetes mellitus type I, rheumatoid arthritis and autoimmune thyroid disease, as well as rare diseases such as connective tissue diseases, immune mediated inflammatory diseases of the gastrointestinal tract (atrophic gastritis, celiac disease, Crohnâs diseases, and ulcerative colitis) or diseases of the central and peripheral nervous system (e.g., autoimmune neuropathies).\n\nThere are associations between MHC alleles (HLA genes) of an individual and various autoimmune diseases (Tab. 25.1-1 â HLA associations with autoimmune diseases). Some HLA alleles significantly increase the risk of contracting a specific autoimmune disease. The highest relative risk for ankylosing spondylitis (Bekhterevâs disease) is seen in HLA-B27 positive individuals. These persons are 80 times more likely to develop ankylosing spondylitis than HLA-B27 negative individuals. Approximately 95% of patients with ankylosing spondylitis are HLA-B27 positive. Although 8% of the German population have the HLA-B27 allele, only a small proportion of these individuals develop ankylosing spondylitis.\n\nAutoimmunity and primary immune deficiency disorders\n\nPrimary immune deficiency diseases consist of a group of over 200 genetic defects, all of which can ultimately lead to an ab errantly functioning immune system and predispose individual to recurrent, chronic, atypical, or severe infections. Primary immune deficiencies are often associated with autoimmune diseases due to deregulation of the immune system as a whole /4/.\n\nSome primary immune deficiencies have autoimmunity as a defining feature /4/. Refer to Tab. 25.1-2 â Primary immune deficiencies with autoimmunity as a defining feature.\n\nAuto inflammation and autoimmunity\n\nThe immune system is categorized broadly as innate and adaptive. Disorders of the immune system may be due to impaired activation or hyper activation of either the innate or the adaptive immune system. Disorders of the innate immune system with no or little involvement of T and B cells are called auto inflammatory syndromes and are characterized by recurrent episodes of fever and systemic inflammation. An ex aggregated activation of the adaptive immune system results in the generation of self-reactive lymphocytes, auto inflammation and high-titre antibodies that are typical features of autoimmune diseases /8/. In auto inflammation the innate immune system directly causes tissue inflammation, whereas in autoimmune disease the innate immune system activates the adaptive immune system which, in turn, is responsible for the inflammatory process. Auto inflammatory diseases refer to a group of rare hereditary recurrent, unprovoked inflammatory disorders which occur in the absence of infection. Patients affected with auto inflammation do not have autoantibodies or auto reactive antigen specific T cells driving the disease process /3/.\n\nRefer to Tab. 25.1-3 â Classification of auto inflammatory and systemic autoimmune diseases.\n\n25.1.2 Clinical characteristics of autoimmunity\n\nClinically, autoimmunopathies are categorized on the basis of organs or organ systems affected. At one end of the spectrum are systemic autoimmune diseases, such as systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), in which several organ systems are affected primarily, while the other end represents autoimmune diseases that remain restricted to a single organ, such as Hashimotoâs disease, in which only the thyroid is affected. In most autoimmune diseases the degree of manifestation is between these two extremes (i.e., the disease predominantly manifests in a single organ system, but also affects other organs).\n\nRefer to Tab. 25.1-4 â Spectrum of autoimmune diseases.\n\n25.1.3 Antibody testing of autoimmune diseases\n\nGeneral laboratory testing comprises for determining activity, organ involvement and drug side effects (Tab. 25.1-5 â Laboratory workup for suspected systemic autoimmune diseases). Depending on the manifestation, various causes, above all infections, must be considered when making a differential diagnosis. This may required extensive laboratory testing.\n\nThe titers of disease specific autoantibodies rarely (e.g., in the case of anti-dsDNA antibodies in SLE or anti-PR3 antibodies in Wegenerâs granulomatosis) correlate with the prognosis, the severity and the treatment response in autoimmune diseases. Therefore, disease and treatment monitoring focuses mainly on measuring inflammatory parameters.\n\nIn addition, in some cases inflammatory markers are measured e.g., cytokines such as IL-6 (especially in pediatrics), or procalcitonin to help differentiate a bacterial superinfection from a flare-up.\n\nIn principle, all large molecule structures in the body may act as auto antigens /9/. The spectrum of autoantibodies includes:\n\nNucleic acids (DNA, RNA)\n\nProteins (structural proteins, receptors, intracellular enzymes)\n\nGlycoproteins (Î²2-glycoprotein I)\n\nPhospholipids (cardiolipin)\n\nGlycosphingolipids (gangliosides).\n\nThe autoantibodies specifically directed against these antigens can be detected in serum, body fluids and tissues. Serum antibodies of diagnostic relevance are IgG and, sometimes, IgA class antibodies. IgM class autoantibodies are usually of little diagnostic significance, since they are very nonspecific and can often also be found in healthy individuals, where they represent physiological auto reactivity.\n\n25.1.3.1 Indication\n\nSuspected systemic autoimmune disease (e.g., when there is an inflammatory reaction that cannot be explained by an infection)\n\nDifferential diagnostic workup of systemic diseases, especially for differentiating such diseases from drug allergy or para neoplastic disease\n\nDiagnostic and differential diagnostic workup of inflammatory organ diseases such as stomach, bowel, liver, muscle, bullous skin diseases, and diseases of the endocrine system and the central and peripheral nervous system\n\nPrognosis of autoimmune diseases (e.g., connective tissue disease and myositis).\n\nImportant autoantibodies in predominantly systemic autoimmune diseases are listed in Tab. 25.1-6 â Autoantibodies in systemic autoimmune diseases.\n\nAutoantibodies in organ specific diseases are listed in Tab. 25.1-7 â Autoantibodies in organ specific autoimmune diseases.\n\n25.1.3.2 Method of determination\n\nScreening for autoantibodies is often performed by indirect immunofluorescence test (IIFT). If autoantibodies are detected, their specificities are determined with immunoassays:\n\nEnzyme immunoassay (ELISA, EIA)\n\nLuminescence, chemoluminescence or electrochemoluminescence assay\n\nImmunoblot (Western blot)\n\nDot/line immunoblot\n\nArray techniques (laser/bead array)\n\nImmune electrophoresis, rarely used today\n\nRIA (FARR assay for anti-dsDNA, otherwise rarely used).\n\nNote: the disadvantage of IIFT is its low specificity. The test often produces false positive results in the absence of a corresponding clinical picture.\n\nIf an immunoassay with a specific panel of auto antigens is used as a screening test, the positive predictive value will be higher due to better diagnostic specificity, since only the antibodies specifically directed against the antigens employed in the assay are measured. The negative predictive value is often lower than in the IIFT, since rare auto antigens are not included and thus not detectable in the immunoassays. To exclude false negatives, several methods should be used in parallel for clinically critical diagnoses such as Goodpasture syndrome or ANCA-associated vasculitides /9/.\n\nThe most commonly requested diagnostic autoantibody tests are:\n\nAntinuclear antibodies\n\nAnti phospholipid antibodies\n\nRheumatoid factors\n\nAnti cyclic citrullinated protein/peptide antibodies (ACPA, anti-CCP).\n\n25.1.3.3 Specimen\n\nSerum: 1 mL\n\n25.1.3.4 Reference interval\n\nDepending on the assay and the specific antibody.\n\n25.1.3.5 Clinical assessment\n\nSystemic autoimmune diseases are classified into two main groups:\n\nAutoimmune arthritis\n\nRheumatoid arthritis\n\nSpondyloarthropathy\n\nConnective tissue diseases\n\nSystemic lupus erythematosus\n\nSystemic scleroderma\n\nSjÃ¶grenâs syndrome\n\nPolymyositis/dermatomyositis\n\nMixed connective tissue disease, Sharpâs syndrome\n\nAnti-phospholipid syndrome\n\nANCA associated vasculitis\n\nGoodpasture syndrome/pulmonary-renal syndrome.\n\nThe common pathogenic principle in systemic autoimmune disease is the loss of natural immunological tolerance to self structures. Activation of the relevant mechanisms results in immunoreactive inflammation of tissues with impairment of various organ functions. Systemic autoimmune disease should be considered if there is inflammatory or ischemic involvement of several organs along with obvious general symptoms.\n\nIn most cases the disease begins with nonspecific symptoms such as arthralgia, myalgia, weight loss or nocturnal hyperhidrosis. For a definite diagnosis to be made, the following must be present /10/:\n\nCardinal clinical symptoms such as polyarthritis\n\nCharacteristic laboratory findings such as autoantibodies\n\nTypical lesions on high resolution imaging studies (e.g., characteristic erosions on joint sonography).\n\n25.1.3.5.1 Autoantibodies in organ specific autoimmune diseases\n\nRefer to Tab. 25.1-7 â Autoantibodies in organ specific autoimmune diseases.\n\n25.1.3.5.2 Systemic autoimmune diseases\n\nRefer to:\n\nTab. 25.1-8 â Systemic autoimmune diseases\n\nTab. 25.1-9 â Laboratory workup for arthritis spectrum disorders\n\nTab. 25.1-10 â Classification criteria for rheumatoid arthritis\n\nTab. 25.1-11 â Classification criteria of systemic lupus erythematosus.\n\nReferences\n\n1.

ANA are helpfull markers in the diagnosis of ANA associated rheumatic diseases including the following autoimmune diseases: systemic lupus erythematosus, systemic sclerosis, SjÃ¶gren syndrome, connective tissue disease.\n\nIf there is a positive ANA result the serum titer, the nuclear pattern of fluorescence (homogenous, centomere, speckled and reticular) is reported and specific antibodies (extractable nuclear antigens; ENAs) are searched for. Specific antibodies are of high clinical relevance as they are associated with particular diseases.\n\nANA and ENA identify a group of autoimmune diseases for which they are important diagnostic and classification criteria. The titer of ANA and their different specificities (target structures) must be taken into account when making a differential diagnosis. The diagnostic sensitivity and specificity of these antibodies for different diseases can vary significantly.\n\n25.2.1 Indication\n\nSuspected connective tissue disease:\n\nSystemic lupus erythematosus (SLE)\n\nSjÃ¶grenâs syndrome (SiS)\n\nScleroderma, including CREST syndrome\n\nMixed connective tissue disease (MCTD, Sharpâs syndrome)\n\nPolymyositis/dermatomyositis\n\nDrug induced lupus erythematosus\n\nTreatment with TNF-Î± blockers\n\nSuspected autoimmune hepatitis\n\nJuvenile idiopathic arthritis.\n\n25.2.2 Method of determination\n\nFor the diagnosis of ANA indirect immunofluorescene assay (IIFT) on Hep-2 cells is still considered the reference method because of its high sensitivity /1/. The main clinical nuclear patterns include /2/:\n\nhomogenous pattern, is associated with antibodies to double standed DNA\n\nspeckled pattern is associated with antibodies to SjÃ¶gren syndrome type antigen (SSA) or SjÃ¶gren syndrome type B antigen SSB2, U1-small ribonucleoprtein (RNP), Smith (Sm), Mi-2 antigen ribonucleic acid RNA polymerase III, Ku antigen, antibodies to fibrillarin, Polymyositis/scleroderma (PMScl), Th/To antigen\n\ncentromere pattern is associated with anticentromere protein B antibodies\n\nnucleolar pattern.\n\nPatterns initiative promoted harmonization and understanding of Hep-2 IIFT staining pattern nomenclature and promoted their use in patient care by providing interpretation for Hep-2 IIFT results.\n\nAn International Consensus (ICAP) on ANA patterns /1/ and an Italian publication recommend /3/:\n\nthe term disease association should be replaced by clinical relevance\n\na sample with a nuclear homogenous HEp-2 IFA pattern stands high chances of having antibodies against double stranded DNA, nucleosome or histones\n\nICAP is still lacking the associations between some Hep-2 IIFT patterns and a distinct disease, but the clinical relevance may help clinicians to define disease criteria and drive decision strategy\n\nOne great advantage resulting from ICAP nomenclature is the consideration of the cytoplastic pattern as an ANA pattern\n\nthe reported pattern should express the morphological interpretation of the topographic distribution of the autoantibody binding to various HEp-2 cell domains\n\ntechnicians and clinical pathologists can use the ICAP classification tree and the embedded clinical immunological information to guide the interpretation\n\nthe correct classification of the pattern should be inserted in the final report\n\nregarding the definition of HEp-2 IFA patterns there is some concern at ICAP on the subtypes of the speckled nuclear patterns with positive staining of the mitotic chromatin. These variants should be differentiated from the nuclear dense fine speckled (DFS) pattern that has well established clinical relevance and immunological association with anti-DfS 70 antibodies.\n\nICAP has established a consensus nomenclature and classification frame work that has been adopted worldwide.\n\nRefer to:\n\nTab. 25.2-1 â Target antigens and associated diseases for nuclear patterns\n\nTab. 25.2-2 â Target antigens and associated diseases for cytoplasmic patterns\n\nTab. 25.2-3 â Target antigens and associated diseases for mitotic patterns.\n\n25.2.2.1 Indirect immunofluorescence test (IIFT)\n\nThe IIFT uses HEp-2 cells fixed on slides. The cells should contain a sufficient number of mitotic cells to enable adequate pattern recognition. HEp-2 is a cell line originally derived from epithelial cells from a larynx carcinoma. This cell line expresses almost all ANA antigens at levels that allow most ANA to be detected with high sensitivity. Only SSA/Ro antigens are expressed at low levels. Some manufacturers therefore offer genetically modified cells with over expression of SSA, although there is no clear evidence that this is of additional diagnostic advantage. The detection antibody (conjugate) should consist of fluorochrome labelled anti-human IgG-specific antiserum, either FITC or another validated new-generation fluorochrome. The optimal screening dilution of 1 : 100 or 1 : 160 is often found to be suitable /1/.\n\nIn the case of a positive ANA test it is recommended that the pattern and the highest dilution to demonstrate reactivity be reported /1/.\n\nThe IIFT shows whether the relevant patient serum contains ANA and, if so, at what titer levels (serum dilution). Based on the fluorescence pattern, the relevant cell structures and, to some extent, the antigen to which the ANA bind can be derived. Since some ANA specificities are relatively highly associated with a certain disease, some fluorescence patterns (e.g., antibodies to centromeres, nuclear dots and few nuclear dots) may provide clues to the underlying disease process. Other fluorescence patterns can be described (e.g. speckled or homogeneous nuclear fluorescence), but the relevant target structure cannot be assigned. Many cytoplasmic target structures, such as ribosomes, lysosomes, Golgi apparatus, actin, vimetin and Jo-1, can be assumed based on the fluorescence pattern, but often cannot be clearly assigned. Depending on the clinical relevance of the suspected autoantibodies, a differentiation should be made.\n\nIn diagnosis and differentiation of rheumatic diseases ANA pattern and ANA titer have great significance.\n\n25.2.2.2 Determination of specific antibodies\n\nWhen the ANA titer is elevated, a differentiating analysis of ANA specificity is performed with specific antigens.\n\nRefer to:\n\nTab. 25.2-4 â Prevalence of antibody findings in systemic autoimmune diseases\n\nTab. 25.2-5 â Prevalence of ANA and association with disease.\n\nMost screening ENA tests utilize the single-well antigen cocktail approach, emphasizing efficiency and cost containment. The profile approach allows a more focused evaluation for defined clinically relevant autoantibodies /3/. Based on the original methodology of this differentiation, a subgroup of antigens that are derived from saline extracts of isolated nuclei are often defined as extractable nuclear antigens (ENAs) /4/. This crude nuclear extract contains mainly the Sm, RNP, SSA and SSB antigens. These antigens produce a speckled pattern in the IIFT.\n\nThe assays are based on highly purified native antigens or genetically produced recombinant antigens. The advantage of recombinant antigens is easy availability and better standardization.\n\nThe following immunoassays are used for detecting specific autoantibodies:\n\nEnzyme immunoassay (ELISA, EIA)\n\nLuminescence, chemiluminescence or electrochemiluminescence assay\n\nImmunoblot (Western blot)\n\nDot/line immunoblot\n\nArray techniques (laser/bead array)\n\nRIA (FARR assay for anti-dsDNA, otherwise rarely used).\n\nBoth IIFT screening tests and immunoassays routinely detect IgG autoantibodies. There is insufficient evidence of the diagnostic value of IgM and IgA ANA/ENA.\n\n25.2.3 Specimen\n\nSerum, plasma: 1 mL\n\n25.2.4 Thresholds\n\nIndirect immunofluorescence test (IIFT)\n\nWhen using HEp-2 cells, the titration of the serum is started with a dilution of 1 : 80 or 1 : 100 or, for children, with a dilution of 1 : 40. When interpreting the titer, the patientâs age and sex and well as the fluorescence pattern should be taken into account. An ANA-IFA titer â¥ 1 : 320 is generally interpreted as positive. However, in young adults, titers as low as 1 : 80 or 1 : 100 must be interpreted as weakly positive, and in children even titers as low as 1 : 40 can indicate an autoimmune disease. Older people (> 60â¯years) frequently have titers â¥ 1 : 320 without a disease correlate.\n\nImmunoassay\n\nThe thresholds are specified by the manufacturer and are not standardized and thus cannot be compared between assays. There is a quantitative standard published by the WHO only for anti-dsDNA antibodies.\n\n25.2.5 Clinical significance\n\nBesides autoimmune diseases for which ANA testing is indicated, ANA can be detected in patients with malignant or infectious diseases as well as in healthy subjects. In the general population some individuals with a positive ANA test by IIFT do not have an autoimmune disease and are unlikely to develop one. Various drugs can induce the production of ANA (drug induced LE), usually transiently and without clinical manifestations of Lupus erythematosus. High titers of ANA are seen in up to 30% of patients receiving TNF-Î± inhibitors, often without a demonstrable reaction to a specific antigen.\n\nRefer to:\n\nTab. 25.2-5 â Prevalence (%) of antibody findings in systemic autoimmune diseases\n\nTab. 25.2-5 â Prevalence of ANA and association with disease.\n\nThe ANA assay is not a screening test for autoimmune diseases, as is often incorrectly assumed. ANA should be ordered only if there is clinical suspicion for one of the autoimmune diseases listed in\n\nTab. 25.1-8 â Systemic autoimmune diseases.\n\nThe workup of an incidentally detected elevated ANA titer is stressful for the patient and requires the exclusion of a rheumatoid disease. The positive predictive value of an incidentally detected elevated ANA titer is less than 5%. However, in some cases ANA may precede the clinical onset of disease for many years. A positive ANA result should therefore not be ignored, but should be monitored.\n\n25.2.5.1 Assessment of positive ANA result\n\nANA are of particular diagnostic relevance if they are high titer, high avidity IgG type antibodies of defined specificity.\n\nSignificantly elevated titers (â¥â¯1â¯:â¯1,000) are mainly found in systemic autoimmune diseases such as connective tissue disease, autoimmune hepatitis, and juvenile idiopathic oligoarthritis, a subgroup of juvenile idiopathic arthritis /6/, or after treatment with TNF-Î± inhibitors. The higher the titer or antibody concentration, the higher the likelihood of autoimmune disease being present. Depending on the stated criteria, every positive ANA finding, even if detected incidentally, should thus be followed by a thorough check of the patientâs medical history, a clinical investigation, and further diagnostic and follow up tests.\n\nIn healthy individuals, the prevalence of ANA varies between 3% and 30%, depending on age, sex and titer. The fluorescence patterns are mainly homogeneous or speckled. The titers usually remain constant during the monitoring period. For example, individuals with an initially high ANA titer still showed the same high titer result 4â¯years later, and individuals with an initially low ANA titer (1 : 80 or 1 : 100) showed a decline, sometimes to undetectable levels, during the same period /7/. Various publications point out that irrelevant ANA may be differentiated based on the pattern and the reactivity to certain antigens, especially against DSF70 (dense fine speckled) /8/.\n\nAssessment of IFA titers â¥ 1 : 320, a diagnostic specificity of 95% can be achieved.\n\nDiagnostic sensitivities of the IFA /9/:\n\n95% for SLE\n\n85% for scleroderma (systemic sclerosis)\n\n75% for SjÃ¶grenâs syndrome.\n\nCertain immunofluorescent patterns can be due to defined antibody specificities and can thus help narrow down the differential diagnosis.\n\nRefer to Tab. 25.2-4 â Autoantibodies and target antigens associated with systemic autoimmune diseases; especially connective issue diseases).\n\nAntibody specificities should be differentiated when the ANA titer is â¥ 1 : 320 or, if there is a high clinical suspicion, even when the titer is as low as 1â¯:â¯100 or the ANA screen is negative. Knowing the fluorescence pattern does not replace testing of specific antibodies. In connective tissue diseases, the immune response is often directed against several antigens rather than just a single one.\n\nThis is particularly apparent in SLE (Tab. 25.2-5 â Prevalence of antibody findings in systemic autoimmune diseases).\n\n25.2.5.2 Assessment of negative ANA results\n\nA negative ANA result excludes the diagnosis of SLE with a diagnostic specificity of more than 95%. The previous concept of ANA negative SLE was based on ANA testing on rat liver sections. However, if the ANA test is negative but SLE continues to be strongly suspected, specific antibody testing by immunoassay must be performed.\n\nTreatment with immunosuppressants and glucocorticoids has little influence on the ANA titer, although false negatives are possible in isolated cases. In addition, no plasmapheresis or treatment with immunoglobulin should have taken place prior to blood collection.\n\nSome ENAs can be missed on IFA, such as anti-SSA/Ro and anti-SSB/La antibodies. In addition, anti-Jo1 antibodies are not excluded in the case of negative IFA because Jo1 is a cytoplasmic antigen. In a study /10/ of 291 samples negative on IFA (serum diluted 1 : 40) 12 showed anti-ENA reactivity on luminescence immunoassay. The authors argue that when clinical suspicion for rheumatic connective tissue disease is present, testing for ENAs should be performed.\n\nIf ANA-IFA is negative one should not proceed to defining anti-dsDNA antibodies. On the other hand, certain IFA patterns (e.g., homogenous) are suggestive of anti-dsDNA antibody /1, 12/.\n\n25.2.6 Comments and problems\n\nIndirect immunofluorescence assay (IIFT)\n\nMany antibody specificities lead to nuclear, nucleolar and cytoplasmic fluorescence patterns, but only few are strictly antigen specific. If HEp-2 cells are used as a substrate, they should show sufficient mitotic stages. During the metaphase the chromosomes are more accessible to the autoantibodies.\n\nPatients often have autoantibodies to several antigens. Some antigens are masked. For example, a speckled fluorescence pattern can be masked by homogeneous fluorescence at low serum dilution and only become prominent at a higher dilution.\n\nThe ANA titer is generally interpreted to be higher when the fluorescence pattern is non homogeneous (e.g., speckled). This is due to the fact that non homogeneous fluorescent staining patterns are of higher contrast, which can be misinterpreted as higher brightness.\n\nBecause ANA-IIFT is not standardized, the ANA titers determined by different laboratories are only moderately comparable. To achieve comparability, there are various initiatives that seek to establish general standards /2/. When monitoring titers, physicians should be aware that a variation of one titer level, including 1 : 100 and below, is of no significance and may merely be due to inaccurate reading.\n\nImmunoassays as screening for ANA\n\nImmunoassays used as screening tests often employ nuclear lysates of HEp-2 cells or a mixture of recombinant antigen specificities. The threshold of various manufacturersâ immunoassays that use nuclear lysates corresponds approximately to the detection limit of IIFTs at a titer of 1 : 100. Tests using nuclear lysates offer the advantage of a high degree of automation, but lack specificity /11/.\n\nIf assays with defined mixtures of recombinant antigens are used for screening, only autoantibodies directed against the antigens contained in the mixture can be detected. Often, antigens of rare antibodies (e.g. PM-Scl) are not included in the test and can therefore not be detected. However, the number of false positive results is lower than that produced by test systems using nuclear lysates or by the IIFT.\n\nSpecimen\n\nAnalysis from synovial fluid or cerebrospinal fluid is of no significance in routine diagnosis.\n\nImmunoassays, especially multiplex assays, often require no more than 10â20â¯Î¼L of sample to identify more than 10, and in the future several hundred, antibody specificities. This is of particular interest in cases where only very small volumes of sample can be collected (e.g., in pediatrics and small animal medicine).\n\nStability\n\n1â¯day at room temperature, 10â¯days at 4â8 Â°C, several years at â20 Â°C. Because antibodies and thus autoantibodies are very stable proteins, the time periods stated can usually be exceeded multiple times without loss of reactivity, although this has generally not been validated.\n\nReferences\n\n1.

Its primary clinical manifestation is inflammatory arthritis. RA is a systemic disease in association with multiple coexisting conditions.\n\nClinical findings\n\nIn clinical practice RA is characterized by /1/:\n\nsymmetric, polyarticular pain and swelling, typically involving the small joints of hands and feet\n\nassociated with multiple coexisting conditions and extraarticular manifestations\n\nInflammatory synovitis resulting from the interactions of genetic factors and environmental exposures\n\nthe disease starts before the clinically apparent arthritis and manifests as continuum that originates with asymptomatic immune dysfunction and progresses through various stages before the disease is classified as rheumatoid arthritis.\n\nThe preclinical stages of seropositive rheumatoid arthritis are characterized by /1/:\n\ndisordered immunity, often associated with mucosal surfaces, including the oral cavity, gastrointestinal tract, and lungs\n\nlocal and systemic generation of anti-citrullinated autoantibodies (ACPAs) and rheumatoid factors (RFs). ACPAs can be measured in serum about 4.5 years before the onset of arthritis; the risk of arthritis increases over time as autoantibody levels increase.\n\nLaboratory findings\n\nACPAs and RFs are important laboratory markers in rheumatoid arthritis. RFs are autoantibodies that bind to the Fc portion of IgG molecules. The classic RF is an IgM isotype and most commonly seen in patients with RA. RFs were, in fact, so important that clinically diagnosed RA without evidence of RF was referred to as seronegative RA, and RFs were the only laboratory parameter to be listed as a main criterion in the RA classification criteria set up by the American College of Rheumatology (ACR criteria). With the advent of ACPAs, which have considerably more diagnostic specificity at similar diagnostic sensitivity and have been included in the latest version of the ACR criteria, RF has become less important /2, 3/.\n\nThe HLA-DR locus is the most important genetic association. In the hypervariable region of the HLADRβ chain (amino acids 70â74) known as the âshared epitopeâ are associated with an increased risk. HLA -DR is involved in antigen presentation to CD4+T cells and could increase susceptibility through its ability to bind and present specific arthritogenic peptides /1/.\n\n25.3.1 Indication\n\nMain indications:\n\nRheumatoid arthritis\n\nMixed cryoglobulinemia (type II).\n\nFurther indications:\n\nNonspecific arthritis\n\nVasculitis\n\nSerositis\n\nConnective tissue disease (suspected SjÃ¶grenâs syndrome).\n\n25.3.2 Method of determination\n\nImmunonephelometry and immunoturbidimetry\n\nPrinciple: see Section 52.1.6 â Indirect measure of antigens and antibodies.\n\nEnzyme immunoassay,luminescence immunoassay\n\nPrinciple: see Section 52.1.8 â Assays with labeling of a reactant.\n\nLatex agglutination test\n\nPrinciple: human IgG molecules bound to latex particles are used as an antigen. See Fig. 25.3-1 â Principle of rheumatoid factor determination by latex enhanced immunoassay.\n\nWaaler-Rose test\n\nPrinciple: direct hemagglutination of erythrocytes coated with animal (usually rabbit) anti-IgG by rheumatoid factors in the sample. Principle: see Section 52.1.6.\n\n25.3.3 Specimen\n\nSerum, plasma, synovial fluid: 1 mL\n\n25.3.4 Threshold value\n\nDepending on the reagent and assay manufacturer. The threshold is usually 10â20 kU/L related to the international reference preparation /4/. The test used for the measurement must have a diagnostic specificity of more than 95% /5/.\n\n25.3.5 Clinical significance\n\nRFs occur transiently in infectious diseases, in particular in viral infections and viral hepatitides. Similar to ANA, RF increases in prevalence with age, without any clinical significance. Low levels of RF can be found in rheumatoid and non rheumatoid diseases (Tab. 25.3-1 â Prevalence of rheumatoid factors in rheumatic diseases).\n\n25.3.5.1 Rheumatoid arthritis (RA)\n\nThe signs and symptoms of RA typically result from synovitis, the inflammation of the synovial membrane within joints. A complex, interactive network of cells and cytokines are involved in the pathogenesis of RA, particularly in the recruitment, activation, and effector functions of immune cells. The synovial layer becomes neovascularized and infiltrated with macrophages and fibroblasts, in addition to an influx of B and T lymphocytes, plasma cells, mast cells, dendritic cells and neutrophils /6/.\n\nRA is the most frequent inflammatory rheumatic disease with a prevalence of 0.5 to 0.85% in the adult population. The current guidelines demand /7/:\n\nDisease modifying treatment in the first 3 months\n\nContinuous monitoring of disease activity\n\nRemission as treatment goal\n\nManagement by a multidisciplinary team\n\nThere is an association with MHC class II antigens. RFs can be found in 70â90% of patients with RA. RF is often detected years before clinical symptoms develop, and RF positive healthy individuals have a 5â40-fold higher risk of developing RA than RF negative individuals /8/. High titers are common in patients with rapidly progressing joint destruction and in those with extra-articular manifestations such as rheumatoid nodules, polyneuropathy, vasculitis, serositis or Sicca syndrome.\n\nAlthough the RF titer usually decreases following initiation of anti-inflammatory treatment, there is no strict correlation with disease activity.\n\nThe RF test is useful in the diagnosis of rheumatoid diseases, since patients with rheumatoid diseases relevant for differential diagnosis, such as psoriatic arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, gout, reactive arthritides, polymyalgia rheumatica and arthroses do not show an elevated prevalence of RF compared to the healthy population /9/. RF is an important criterion of the ACR criteria and therefore must be assayed at least in all RA patients involved in treatment studies.\n\nAccording to the 2010 rheumatoid arthritis classification criteria the classification as definite RA is based on /3/:\n\nThe confirmed presence of synovitis in at least one joint\n\nAbsence of an alternative diagnosis better explaining the synovitis\n\nAchievement of a total score of 6 or greater (of a possible 10) from the individual scored in four domains: number and site of involved joints (range 0â5), serological abnormality (range 0â3), elevated acute-phase response (range 0â1) and symptom duration (range 0â1).\n\nRefer to Tab. 25.1-10 â The 2010 rheumatoid classification criteria.\n\n25.3.5.2 Mixed cryoglobulinemia type II and type III\n\nApproximately 40â60% of patients with hepatitis C infection develop cryoglobulinemia, women more often than men (Section 18.11 â Cryoglobulins and cryofibrinogen). In all cases there is RF activity, which is almost always due to a monoclonal IgM Îº-type and precipitates readily at 4 Â°C /1/. The IgM RF is complexed with polyclonal IgG in the cryoprecipitate from the serum of these patients. Since monoclonal RF do not always have the same specificity as the RF typical of RA, there may not always be a detectable reaction with rabbit IgG (Waaler-Rose test).\n\n25.3.5.3 IgG and IgA type rheumatoid factors\n\nThere is no consensus on the diagnostic value of class-specific RF tests. IgA RF are more specific than IgM RF, comparable to the value of anti-CCP antibodies, but have a diagnostic sensitivity of only 50â60%. Even when measuring all RF classes, approximately 10% of RA patients remain seronegative. A positive result for all three RF classes is considered specific for RA. In isolated cases, elevated IgA RF and IgG RF have been ascribed prognostic value with regard to the progression of joint erosions in rheumatoid patients. Extra articular manifestations of RA are thought to be associated with IgA RF /9, 10/.\n\n25.3.6 Comments and problems\n\nMethod of determination\n\nImmunonephelometry, immunoturbidimetry /11/: RF is measured by latex enhanced assays, usually with latex particles coated with human IgG. Most assays detect only IgM RFs, because their pentameric shape allows them to cause sufficient agglutination of the latex particles. Turbidimetric methods are used on the clinical chemistry analyzers. It must be kept in mind that, compared to ELISA, this method is more susceptible to nonspecific reactions. Since the turbidity is proportional to the concentration of RF, a quantitative result is generated (in kU/L).\n\nELISA assays are predominantly used to measure RF of the IgG and IgA isotypes.\n\nDetermination of RF in synovial fluid\n\nIn RA, the results correspond to those obtained in serum in almost all cases /12/. No valid statement can be made on a positive synovial fluid test with a negative result in serum, since a false positive reaction due to the matrix effects in the synovial fluid is more likely than a false negative result in serum. RF in synovial fluid should therefore not be part of routine diagnostic testing.\n\nInterference\n\nRFs pose a technical problem in the laboratory, as they can interfere with specific antibody immunoassays (Tab. 52.1-4 â Factors interfering with immunoassays).\n\nReferences\n\n1.

Citrullinated peptides (CCP) are peptides and proteins in which arginine residues have been converted to citrulline residues. Testing for anti-CCP antibodies in undifferentiated arthritis allows prediction of approximately 80% of patients who will fulfill the criteria for RA /1, 2/.\n\n25.4.1 Indication\n\nSuspicion of /3/:\n\nRheumatoid arthritis\n\nSeronegative (RF negative) rheumatoid arthritis\n\nUndifferentiated arthritis\n\nEarly RA, to determine indications for RA specific treatment (e.g., TNF-Î± inhibitors).\n\nIn addition:\n\nDifferentiation of nonspecific arthritides with demonstrable rheumatoid factor\n\nMarker for the prognostic evaluation of RA in combination with other criteria\n\nPrognostic parameter in juvenile idiopathic arthritis (group of RF positive polyarthritides).\n\n25.4.2 Method of determination\n\nImmunoassays using anti-cyclic citrullinated peptides (anti-CCP) as antigens /4/ e.g., an immunoassay based on the biotin streptavidin technology employing an IgG capture assays format. The format uses biotinylated peptides that are recognized by anti-CCP antibodies from patient samples and a ruthenium labeled monoclonal antibody that recognizes aggregated human IgG. The resulting immune complexes immobilize at the streptavidin coated magnetic microbeads. The measured electrochemiluminescence signal is proportional to the anti-CCP-IgG antibody concentration in the sample.\n\n25.4.3 Specimen\n\nSerum, plasma: 1 mL\n\n25.4.4 Reference interval\n\nDepending on the manufacturer of the commercial assay. Some manufacturers use the cut-off 17 U/mL, a few others use 25 U/mL.\n\n25.4.5 Clinical significance\n\nThe 2010 American College of Rheumatology/European League Against Rheumatism classification criteria for RA validate rheumatic factor (RF) and anti-CCP with identical score in patients with synovitis /1/. Refer to Tab. 25.1-10 â The 2010 rheumatoid classification criteria.\n\nAccording to a systematic review of 151 studies investigating the accuracy of anti-CCP for diagnosing RA the sensitivity range was 12â93% and specificity range 63â100%. In a cohort study that investigated anti-CCP antibodies in patients with early rheumatoid arthritis (< 2 years), summary sensitivity and specificity were 57% (95% CI 51 to 63%) and 96% (95% CI 93â97%), respectively. Case-control and cross-sectional studies and studies of patients with established RA all overestimated sensitivity. Anti-CCP had greater specificity than RF (96% vs. 86%) with similar sensitivity. Evidence was insufficient to ascertain whether the combination of anti-CCP and RF provides additional benefit over anti-CCP alone /5/.\n\nLike RF positivity, the presence of anti-CCP is associated with severe disease and thus a significant prognostic factor /6/. Tab. 25.4-1 â Prevalence of anti-CCP antibodies in diseases shows the prevalence of ACPA in different diseases /7/.\n\nCombining ACPA and IgM-RF tests allows a better accuracy in the diagnosis of RA. In a study population at risk for RA, the positive predictive value (PPV) of anti-CCP and IgM RF for RA was 61% and the negative predictive value (NPV) 92% in each case. When both biomarkers were positive, the PPV increased to 98%; when both were negative, the NPV was 92.5%. Combining the two tests therefore markedly increases the PPV. A higher diagnostic specificity (increase from 82â90% to 98%) was also achieved by combining anti-CCP and IgA-RF /8, 9/.\n\nAnti-CCP antibodies can be detected with a diagnostic sensitivity of 40â70% in the early stages of RA, sometimes even up to 10 years before the onset of clinical symptoms /10/. Due to the high diagnostic specificity of anti-CCP antibodies , all positive patients without corresponding clinical symptoms must be counseled and monitored. Although some studies have reported a decrease in anti-CCP antibodies titers in patients receiving immunosuppressive treatment, there is no clear evidence to use antibody titers for monitoring of the disease activity.\n\nAnti-CCP antibody positive patients have a higher risk of developing progression of joint damage within 5 years than Anti-CCP antibody negative patients, when evaluating radiographic joint damage using Sharp scores /11/.\n\n25.4.6 Comments and problems\n\nMethod of determination\n\nACPA can be assayed using the standardized first commercial ELISA (anti-CCP-1 i.e., first generation). A lot of data was obtained with anti-CCP-1 assays. Using the anti-CCP-2 assay increased the diagnostic sensitivity at the same specificity. Although all commercially available anti-CCP assays contain the same highly standardized peptides, various studies showed intra assay variations of 0.5â19% and inter assay variations of 0.4â22%. At a fixed diagnostic specificity of 98.5%, the sensitivities of different assays for RA ranged from 41% to 74%. The most false positives are seen in viral infections /12/. A diagnostic advantage of other ACPA tests (e.g., anti-MCV) over anti-CCP-2 tests could not be demonstrated, as the results from comparative studies vary /13/.\n\nSpecimen\n\nThe test can be performed with sample volumes as low as 100 Î¼L, allowing it to be used even in cases where only low test volumes are available (e.g., in pediatrics).\n\nAssaying anti-CCP antibodies in synovial fluid barely increases the diagnostic sensitivity for RA and should not be part of routine diagnostic testing due to the technical issues (tests not validated, matrix effects).\n\nStability\n\n10 days at room temperature, four weeks at 4â8 Â°C, several years at â20 Â°C.\n\n25.4.7 Pathophysiology\n\nAntibodies to citrullinated protein/peptide antigens (anti-CCP antibodies) are directed against an individualâs own citrullinated proteins and peptides. For the measurement of anti-CCP antibodies cyclic citrullinated peptides (CCP) are used in immunoassays.\n\nCitrulline is a modified amino acid. It is produced as a by product of the enzymatic deamination of the essential amino acid arginine (i.e., positively charged amino groups are hydrolyzed to a neutral oxygen group) (Fig. 25.4-1 â Removal of the arginine residue of a peptide by the enzyme peptidylarginine deiminase). The deamination of arginine in peptides and proteins is catalyzed by four known peptidylarginine deiminases (PAD 1â4), which exhibit a tissue specific distribution. PADs are also referred to as PADIs.\n\nPhysiologically, only few proteins are citrullinated by the enzyme PAD (e.g., vimentin, filaggrin, fibrin, Î±-enolase). Citrullination may be enhanced in certain situations. For example, the protein filaggrin is citrullinated during the late phase of differentiation of epidermal cells, and fibrin is citrullinated during joint inflammation in RA. In addition, antibodies to CCP are produced in the inflamed synovia, and the concentration of IgG antibodies to CCP in the pannus is multiple times higher than in synovial fluid or serum /14/. It is well established that antigen stimulated B cells produce IgG antibodies to CCP in the joints of RA patients and that this occurs locally in the inflamed joint rather than as a systemic process.\n\nThere is evidence to suggest that abnormal citrullination may play role in RA. For example, single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the PADI 4 gene which may lead to a more stable mRNA and thus higher activity of the enzyme have been associated with RA /15/. The altered self hypothesis is also being discussed in relation to the formation of anti-CCP antibodies. In RA, autoantibodies to the enzyme PAD 4 were found. Other recently described autoantibodies with a potential for diagnostic use is also directed against âaltered selfâ. They are directed against carbamylated proteins and are called anti-CarbP /16/.\n\nSimilar to celiac disease, here, too, the association with certain HLA alleles is a major factor in the exaggerated immune response. In RA there is a high association with the shared epitope, a peptide sequence in the HLA-DR that occurs in the alleles previously called HLA-DR4 and now known as HLA-DR*0401, 0404, as well as in HLA-DR*0101. Citrullinated peptides have been shown to induce a particularly strong T cell response when presented by cells with the shared epitope /17/. The abnormal response is triggered or at least amplified by external triggers. Smoking is a major risk factor for RA. Carriers of the shared epitope have a higher risk of developing RA, and smoking increases this risk dramatically /18/.\n\nReferences\n\n1. Aletaha D, Neogi T, Silman AJ, Funovits J, Felson DT, et al.

Based on etiopathogenesis one may distinguish among the following myopathies /1, 2/:\n\nHereditary degenerative (e.g., muscular dystrophy, congenital dystrophy, and sarcopenia)\n\nHereditary metabolic (e.g., glycogen storage myopathy, lipid storage myopathy, mitochondrial myopathy)\n\nIdiopathic inflammatory myopathies\n\nInflammatory ; autoimmune (polymyositis, dermatomyositis, immune-mediated necrotizing myopathy) and infectious (e.g., viral, bacterial, and fungal genesis)\n\nMedicinal-toxic genesis (e.g., statins, steroids, and alcohol)\n\nEndocrine (e.g., hypothyroidism)\n\nNeoplastic infiltrative (e.g., rhabdomyosarcoma) and para neoplastic (e.g., dermatomyositis)\n\nMechanically (e.g., march rhabdomyolysis)\n\nHereditary myopathies have a slow course and start early in life, acquired myopathies have a fast course and start later in life.\n\n25.5.1 Idiopathic inflammatory myopathies\n\nIdiopathic inflammatory myopathies (IIMs) are a diverse group of autoimmune inflammatory conditions with multi-organ system involvement /13/. Extra-muscular involvement, include lungs, skin, joints, and the gastrointestinal tract. Interstitial lung disease (ILD) has been associated with IIM and is also associated with myositis-specific autoantibodies The spectrum of IIMs has further evolved since the discovery of myositis-specific autoantibodies. Currently IIMs are differentiated into dematomyositis, immune mediated necrotizing myopathy, inclusion body myositis, and overlap syndrome, which are further subcategorized on the basis of individual myositis specific autoantibodies. A high prevalence of renal tubular injury is found in patients with IIM. Half of the patients had estimated GFR below 90 [ml Ã minâ1 Ã (1,73 m2)â1]. Five urine biomarkers (NGAL, KIM1, Activin A, CD163, and Cystatin C ) are reliable biomarkers in early diagnosis of kidney involvement in IIM /14/.\n\nClinical manifestations: The clinical manifestations of IIMs are heterogenous and can present with acute, subacute, or chronic symptoms.Typical are complaints of symmetrical proximal muscle weakness, however, the initial presentation of IIM can be clinically amyopathic.\n\nRefer to Tab. 25.5-1 â Idiopathic inflammatory myopathies.\n\n25.5.1.1 Myositis-associated autoantibodies\n\nMyositis-associated autoantibodies can help to diagnose IIMs and define subgroups of patients in terms of clinical or pathological phenotypes, prognosis, and response to treatment.\n\nAntisynthetase antibodies\n\nAnti-histidyl-ARN-t-synthetase (Jo-1)\n\nAnti-threonine-ARN-t-synthetase (PL7)\n\nAnti-alanine-ARN-t-sythetase (PL12)\n\nAnti-complex nucleosome remodeling histone deacetylase (Mi2)\n\nAnti-Ku\n\nAnti-polymyositis/systemic scleroderma (PMScl)\n\nAnti-topoisomerase 1 (SCL70)\n\nAnti-signal recognition particle (SRP).\n\nRefer to:\n\nTab. 25.5-1 â Muscle specific autoantibodies in idiopathic inflammatory myopathy (IIM)\n\nTab. 25.5-2 â Muscle associated autoantibodies in idiopathic inflammatory myopathy (IIM)\n\nTab. 25.5-3 â Anti-sythetase antibodies in anti-synthetase syndrome.\n\n25.5.1.2 Indication\n\nDiagnosis of idiopathic inflammatory myopathy (IMM) and to define subgroups of patients.\n\n25.5.1.3 Method of determination\n\nMost of the commercial kits are line immune assays in which several antigens are coated on a strip. Some ELISA are also developed.\n\n25.5.1.4 Sample\n\nSerum: 1 ml\n\n25.5.1.5 Reference interval\n\nDepending on the manufacturer of the commercial assay.\n\n25.5.1.6 Clinical significance\n\nBased on clinical and pathological descriptions one may distinguish among idiopathic inflammatory myopathies (IMM) a heterogenous group of myopathies in their pathophysiologic features and prognosis: dermatomyositis, polymyositis, overlap myositis, inclusion body myositis, immune-mediated necrotizing myopathy and other nonspecific myositis /4/.\n\nThe emergence of myositis specific autoantibodies suggests that subgroups of patients with IMM may be differentiated /3, 4/.\n\n25.5.1.6.1 Idiopathic inflammatory myopathy (IMM)\n\nThe IMM are a group of acquired myopathies characterized by muscle inflammation that are associated with motor weakness of varying severity. They are rare autoimmune diseases and heterogeneous in their muscle phenotype and extra muscular manifestations /3/.\n\nThe symptoms are muscle weakness and sometimes pain, often but not always symmetrical and proximal, are limited to the trunk, neck, and limbs /4/. These symptoms are accompanied by signs of muscle damage: the enzymes CK, AST and LD are elevated.\n\nEpidemiology\n\nThe IIM has a prevalence of about 60 per 1 million and the incidence is 1.9â7.7 per 1 million in the general population of Caucasians /5/. The most common form of IIM is dermatomyositis (DM), followed by inclusion body myositis and Polymyositis (PM). Inclusion body myositis accounts for 10% of IIM cases in general, and for up to 25% of IIM cases in older patients. DM and PM are 2â3 times more common in women than in men; in childhood, both sexes are affected approximately equally. Juvenile DM is the most common presentation, followed by far fewer cases of juvenile PM, overlap myositis, and inclusion body myositis /6/. Myositis overlap syndromes are 5â10 times more common in women than in men.\n\n25.5.1.6.2 Subgroups of idiopathic inflammatory myopathies\n\nThe major inflammatory subgroups of idiopathic inflammatory myopathies (IIM) are /4/:\n\nOverlap myositis\n\nDermatomyositis\n\nImmune mediated necrotizing myopathy\n\nInclusion body myositis.\n\nA new classification system for IIM based on clinical manifestations and myositis specific antibodies defined the following subgroups /3/:\n\nAnti synthetase syndrome; presence of anti-Jo-1 antibodies or anti-PL7 antibodies\n\nDematomyositis; presence of anti-Mi2 antibodies, anti-melanoma differentiation-associated protein 5 (MDA5) antibodies, or anti-transcription intermediary factor 1Î³ (TIF1Î³) antibodies\n\nImmune mediated necrotizing myopathy; presence of anti-SRP antibodies or anti-3-hydroxy-3-methyl glutaryl-coenzyme A reductase (HMGCR) antibodies\n\nInclusion body myositis; presence of cytosolic 5â nucleotidase antibodies (anti-cN1A).\n\nRefer to:\n\nTab. 25.5-2 â Muscle associated autoantibodies in idiopathic inflammatory myopathy (IIM)\n\nTab. 25.5-3 â Anti-sythetase antibodies in anti-synthetase syndrome.\n\nThe IMM subgroups share some common characteristics in terms of phenotype and pathogenesis.\n\n25.5.1.6.3 Laboratory tests\n\nPatients with muscular complaints should primarily undergo the following basic tests:\n\nBlood count and differential count\n\nInflammatory markers (e.g., C-reactive protein, ESR)\n\nMuscle enzymes (e.g., creatine kinase, serum myoglobin) which have a diagnostic sensitivity of 90%, but low specificity for IIM\n\nAnti-CCP or rheumatoid factor to differentiate rheumatoid arthritis\n\nAntinuclear antibodies (ANA), since elevated ANA are found in 40â80% of patients, depending on the clinical group of myopathies\n\nOrgan specific laboratory tests: kidney function (creatinine), liver damage (ALT), focus on organ damage (LD), lactate and TSH to differentiate metabolic and endocrine myopathies.\n\n25.5.2 Polymyalgia rheumatica\n\nPolymyalgia rheumatica is an inflammatory disorder that causes muscle pain and stiffness especially in the shoulders and hips /13/. Most people who develop polymyalgia rheumatica are older than 65 years, people under 50 are rarely affected. The prevalence in women is 21.8/100,000 versus 12.8/100,000 in men. Polymyalgia rheumatica is an inflammatory condition and the second most common cause of inflammatory rheumatic disease in older people. The European Alliance of Associations for Rheumatology (EULAR) and the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) have created the classification criteria (Tab. 25.5-4 â EULAR/ACR criteria for the diagnosis of polymyalgia rheumatica).\n\nLaboratory findings: CRP and blood sedimentation rate are increased, rheumatic factor negative.\n\nReferences\n\n1.

The following autoantibodies are differentiated:\n\nAutoantibodies targeting neuronal cell-surface antigens. These antibodies suggest a direct pathogenic effect and cause neuronal damage and neuronal death /3, 4/. They have been identified in patients presenting with neurological symptoms resembling para neoplastic syndromes.\n\nAutoantibodies targeting intracellular antigens do not appear to be directly pathogenic, but may be used as diagnostic biomarkers of cancer.\n\nAutoantibodies are diagnostically relevant in /5/:\n\nSyndromes of the central nervous system\n\nSyndromes of the peripheral nervous system\n\nSyndromes of the neuromuscular junction and muscle.\n\nRefer to Tab. 25.6-1 â Neurological syndromes.\n\n25.6.1 Paraneoplastic neurological syndroms\n\nParaneoplastic neurological syndroms (PNS) are a diverse group of disorders that can occur with any type of malignancy and can affect any part of the central nervous system. Many PNS are immune-mediated and are triggered when tumors express proteins that are normally restricted to immune privileged neurons /6/.\n\nThe immune responses often manifest as anti neuronal antibodies that can be measured in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and serum. Anti neuronal antibodies also referred as onconeural antibodies or para neoplastic antibodies are directed against intracellular neuronal antigens. Onconeural antibodies are commonly associated with small cell lung cancer (SCLC), ovarian cancer, breast cancer, neuroendocrine tumors, thymoma and lymphoma. The antibodies serve as markers of the para neoplastic neurologic syndromes and, in some cases, of the presence of specific types of tumors /6/.\n\nRefer to:\n\nTab. 25.6-2 â Diagnostic criteria for paraneoplastic neurological syndromes.\n\nOnconeural antibodies are also seen in cancer patients without PNS or in patients without cancer. Therefore, other neurological causes should be considered in the differential diagnosis, even if an onconeural antibody is present.\n\nMost PNS have a prevalence of far less than 1%, with the exception of the following /6/:\n\nParaneoplastic cerebellar degeneration\n\nLimbic encephalitis\n\nParaneoplastic sensory neuropathy\n\nAnti-N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor encephalitis\n\nPNS is suspected in the following cases:\n\nSigns of classical PNS\n\nSub acute neurological symptoms which cannot be diagnosed with regular neurological investigations or laboratory tests\n\nCancer patients whose symptoms cannot be neurologically explained by either the primary tumor, its localization and metastatic spread, or by cytostatic treatment.\n\nRefer to Fig. 25.6-1 â Diagnostic approach to suspected paraneoplastic neurological syndrome.\n\nThe history, symptoms and progression of PNS are generally as follows:\n\nMost PNS occur in patients with previously unknown cancer\n\nPNS has an acute or subacute onset and progresses over weeks to months before stabilizing.\n\n25.6.1.1 Paraneoplastic antibodies (PNA)\n\nAntibodies that occur in paraneoplastic syndromes have been divided in two categories depending on the location of the antigen. Intracellular antibodies are directed against intracellular neural proteins. Extracellular antibodies are directed against extracellular (surface) proteins. Antibodies to intracellular neural proteins, also called classical para neoplastic antibodies (PNA) or onconeural antibodies are well characterized PNA and their detection almost always indicates the presence of an underlying cancer /1/.\n\nThese PNA include:\n\nAnti-neuronal antibody type 1 (ANNA-1), anti-Hu\n\nAnti-neuronal antibody type 2 (ANNA-2), anti-Ri\n\nAnti-amphysin\n\nAnti-collapsin response mediator protein type 5 (anti CRMP5)\n\nAnti-Purkinje cell cytoplasm antibody type 1 (anti-CA-1), anti-Yo\n\nAnti-para neoplastic neuronal antigen Ma2 (anti-Ma2)\n\nAnti-recoverin.\n\nPNA are usually of the IgG isotype and rarely found in healthy individuals. In patients with paraneoplastic syndrome, the antibodies are generally found in high titers in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Although the PNA titer does not correlate with the severity of disease, the antibodies are more common in patients with cancer and neurological symptoms than in patients with cancer alone.\n\nLow PNA titers are also seen in cancer patients without neurological symptoms. The presence of PNA without neurological symptoms is thus not necessarily diagnostic of PNS.\n\nAlthough PNA are sensitive markers of PNS, they are only diagnosed in up to 50% of PNS patients. They are also detected in 16% of cancer patients, even though the patients have no neurological symptoms. Up to 30% of patients with PNS have several paraneoplastic neurological syndromes. PNA can be detected as early as 20 months before the cancer is diagnosed.\n\nRefer to:\n\nTab. 25.6-3 â Paraneoplastic antibodies against neuronal intracellular antigens\n\nTab. 25.6-4 â Non paraneoplastic antibodies against neuronal intracellular antigens.\n\n25.6.2 Antibodies in syndromes of the central nervous system (encephalitis/cerebellitis)\n\nEncephalitis associated with autoantibodies account for approximately 8% of encephalitis cases. Targets of autoantibodies include /4/:\n\nIonotropic receptors; N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR), Î±-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid receptor (AMPAR), Î³-amino butyric acid (GABA)A receptor and glycine receptor (GlyR)\n\nMetabotropic receptors; GluR1, GluR5, GABABR\n\nProteins belonging to the voltage-gated potassium channel (VGKC) complex, namely Lgi1 and Caspr2.\n\nRefer to:\n\nTab. 25.6-5 â Antibodies targeting extracellular cell-surface/synaptic neural antigens\n\nTab. 25.6-6 â Encephalitis/cerebellitis associated disorders.\n\n25.6.3 Antibodies in immune-mediated neuropathies\n\nThe evaluation of immune-mediated polyneuropathies can be challenging and considers careful consideration because these neuropathies vary in their spectrum. Symptoms of distal numbness, tingling and pain, and weakness are common complaints. The diagnosis is based on clinical, electrophysiological, and immunological features of the syndrome. One important finding of the antibody associated polyneuropathy are autoantibodies directed against targets of glycolipids or proteins with a receptor or ion channel function /7/.\n\nImmune mediated neuropathies comprise:\n\nNeuropathies phenotypically associated with anti-ganglioside antibodies (Tab. 25.6-7 â Neuropathies phenotypically associated with anti-ganglioside antibodies)\n\nParaproteinemic neuropathy; associated with antibodies to myelin associated glycoprotein\n\nCryoglobulinemic neuropathy, associated with the presence of cryoglobulins (Section 18.11 â Cryoglobulins and cryofibrinogen).\n\nAntibodies detectable in immune mediated neuropathies are listed in Tab. 25.6-8 â Antibodies in immune-mediated polyneuropathies. Of diagnostic relevance are anti-ganglioside antibodies, the structure of which is shown in Fig. 25.6-2 â Structure of the gangliosides.\n\n25.6.3.1 Guillain-BarrÃ© syndrome (GBS)\n\nGBS is an acute, self-limiting motor dominant polyneuropathy, often preceded by an infection. The annual incidence has been estimated at 1â2 per 100,000 population and is the most common form of polyneuropathy in Europe and in North America, accounting for 85â90% of cases. GBS includes the acute inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (ADIP) and the acute axonal neuropathy (AMAN) /8/. The mortality rate in the acute phase is 3.5â12%, and 20% of patients are left with residual complaints.\n\nGBS represents the prototype of immune-mediated polyneuropathy. In GBS, the body launches an autoimmune attack on nerve roots of the spinal cord in a primarily healthy individual without any other autoimmune disease being present. The inflammation leads to demyelination of nerve segments, causing ascending paralysis which usually begins in the legs. This is sometimes preceded by an infection of the upper respiratory tract or the gastrointestinal tract. The main pathogens are Cytomegalovirus, Epstein-Barr virus, Mycoplasma pneumoniae and Campylobacter jejuni. This bacterium is thought to share certain structurally similar components with the peripheral nervous system.\n\nBesides the classical GBS several variants are differentiated (Tab. 25.6-7 â Neuropathies phenotypically associated with anti-ganglioside antibodies).\n\nClinical presentation\n\nGBS is difficult to diagnose in the initial stages, since patients usually have vague symptoms such as weakness, neck or back pain before the classic clinical picture is evident /9/. The latter manifests as quadriplegia, possibly with weakness of the respiratory muscles as well as facial and bulbar weakness. By definition, the progression of muscle weakness in two or more extremities to a nadir occurs within 4 weeks. Sensory symptoms are usually mild. The acute phase is followed by a variable plateau phase and then spontaneous remission.\n\n25.6.3.1.1 Anti-ganglioside antibodies\n\nAnti-ganglioside antibodies, mostly IgG type, are present in sera of about 60% of patients in the acute phase of GBS and are a characteristic feature. The serum antibodies in GBS are subdivided into the following types: anti-GM1 (40%), anti-GD1a (20%), anti-GalNAc-GD1a and anti-Asialo-GM-1 (17%), respectively /10/.\n\nInterpretation\n\nRefer to Tab. 25.6-7 â Neuropathies phenotypically associated with anti-ganglioside antibodies.\n\nCerebrospinal fluid\n\nThe cell count is normal or slightly elevated (up to 50 cells/Î¼L, predominately lymphocytes, monocytes). Total protein is initially normal and later elevated, the QAlb can be up to 50 Ã 10â3, no oligoclonal bands.\n\n25.6.3.2 Miller Fisher syndrome (MFS)\n\nAcute immune-mediated immunopathies include GBS, MFS, MFS variants, and Bickerstaffâs brainstem encephalitis. MFS is characterized by acute onset of ophthalmoplegia, ataxia and areflexia, and is the most common variant of GBS. The syndrome also includes patients with cranial nerve involvement and can show overlap with GBS. The annual incidence has been estimated at 0.09 per 100,000 population, accounting for about 5â10% of GBS cases. MFS patients have anti-GQ1b IgG antibodies during the acute phase of the illness. Many patients with elevated titers of anti-GQ1b IgG antibodies report about respiratory tract infection preceding the onset of neurological symptoms.\n\nThe anti-GQ1b IgG antibodies can be positive in Bickerstaffâs brain stem encephalitis. These patients have opthalmoplegia, areflexia or hyporeflexia and also show impaired consciousness, which is not common in MFS /11/.\n\n25.6.3.3 Acute motor axonal neuropathy (AMAN)\n\nAMAN is a multi focal demyelinating neuropathy characterized by a slowly progressive, predominantly distal, asymmetric weakness. Weakness begins distally in upper extremity in 80% of patients. The diagnosis depends on the presence of persistent, focal motor conduction block in one or more nerves at sites not prone to compression. AMAN involves at least two motor nerves for at least one month. The disease mostly affects the arms; tendon reflexes are weak or absent. Sensory disturbances are absent or mild. There is no cranial nerve involvement. AMAN runs a chronic course, lasting years /12, 13/.\n\n25.6.3.3.1 Laboratory findings\n\nMild elevation of total protein in CSF, but never above 1 g/L /13/. High titer serum anti-GM-1 IgM antibodies in 75â80% of patients. Another 10â15% of patients have serum IgM binding to GalNAc-GD1a ganglioside. The IgM antibodies may be polyclonal or monoclonal. On immunofixation electrophoresis 10â20% of AMAN patients have a serum IgM monoclonal protein /7/.\n\n25.6.3.4 Chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP)\n\nCIDP is a chronic neuropathy characterized by more than 2 months of progressive weakness, sensory loss and decreases or absent tendon reflexes. At clinical presence of neuropathy or in neuromuscular centers, CIDP accounts for approximately 20% of patients with initially undiagnosed neuropathies. The polyneuropathy is characterized by symmetric proximal and distal sensory and motor polyneuro radiculopathy. It is an autoimmune disease that involves the peripheral nerve sheaths. T cell deregulation is thought to play a role in the pathogenesis. CIDP runs a chronic progressive or relapsing remitting course.\n\nA non inflammatory, similar condition occurs in diabetes mellitus and type 1 Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (CMT1). In the general population the prevalences of CIDP and CMT1 are 5/100,000 and 10/100,000, respectively /14/. Autoantibody testing is of little value in CIDP.\n\nCerebrospinal fluid\n\nTotal protein approximately 450 mg/L and a cell count 10/Î¼L (albumino cytologic dissociation) are seen in 83â95% of patients. Albumino cytologic dissociation can also occur in diabetic neuropathy and in GBS /15/.\n\n25.6.3.5 Paraproteinemic neuropathy (PPN)\n\nIgM paraproteinemic neuropathy\n\nThe most common types of PPN are those with demyelinating neuropathy and without non neurological symptoms /16/. The neuropathy is defined as demyelinating if it satisfies electrophysiological criteria for chronic inflammatory demyelinating neuropathy (CDIP). If there are subtle features of demyelination not meeting these criteria, further investigations should be considered to confirm the evidence of immune mediated demyelination. Patients with IgM MGUS often develop PPN. Most patients with IgM PPN have the acquired demyelinating symmetrical clinical phenotype of predominantly distal, chronic (duration over 6 months), slowly progressive, symmetric, predominantly sensory impairment, with ataxia and relatively mild or no weakness, and often tremor /14/.\n\nPatients with IgG and IgA PPN usually have proximal and distal motor and sensory weakness that is clinically and electrophysiologically indistinguishable from CIDP.\n\nIf a multiple myeloma is present, the neuropathy can be of heterogeneous etiology (amyloidosis, metabolic and toxic damage, nerve root compression).\n\nThe Guidelines of the European Federation of Neurological Societies recommend /14/:\n\nPatients with PPN should be investigated for a malignant plasma cell dyscrasia\n\nThe paraprotein is more likely to be causing the neuropathy if the paraprotein is immunoglobulin (IgM), antibodies are present in serum or on biopsy, or the clinical phenotype is chronic distal neuropathy\n\nPatients with IgM PPN usually have predominantly distal and sensory impairment, with prolonged distal motor latencies, and often anti-myelin associated glycoprotein antibodies\n\nIgM PPN sometimes responds to immunotherapies\n\nIgG and IgA PPN may be indistinguishable from CDIP clinically, electrophysiologically, and in response to treatment\n\nFor POEMS syndrome, local irradiation or resection of an isolated plasmacytoma, or melphalan with or without corticosteroids, should be considered, with hemato-oncology advice.\n\n25.6.3.5.1 Laboratory findings\n\nAnti-Myelin associated glycoprotein (MAG) antibodies are found in the serum of 50% of patients with IgM PPN in high titers (above 1 : 6,400) more commonly associated with kappa than lambda light chains. Patients with IGM PPN and no anti-MAG antibodies should be tested for IgM antibodies to other neural antigens such as the gangliosides and sulfatides /14/. Cerebrospinal fluid analysis shows elevated total protein in 75â86% of PPN patients /14/.\n\n25.6.3.6 CONAMAD\n\nThe syndrome of chronic ataxic neuropathy with opthalmoplegia, IgM monoclonal gammopathy, cold agglutinins and ganglioside IgM antibodies (anti-GD1b and anti-GQ1b) is a rare neuropathy. CONAMAD is similar to the chronic form of Miller Fisher syndrome, with mixed demyelinating and axonal electrophysiology. Ataxia is profound, severely impaired function, but motor strength remains relatively spared /15/.\n\n25.6.3.7 POEMS\n\nThe acronym POEMS refers to polyneuropathy, organomegaly, endocrinopathy, M protein and skin changes. Some of these elements my be lacking. The syndrome is also known as osteosclerotic myeloma. Neuropathy is the main feature of this syndrome and often precedes the diagnosis of osteosclerotic myeloma. Patients with POEMS typically have IgG or IgA monoclonal gammopathy of the lambda type /17/, the paraprotein level is usually below 2 g/L. Half the patients have thrombocytosis and polycythemia. The vascular endothelial growth factor level is diagnostically useful.\n\n25.6.3.8 Amyloidosis\n\nPrimary amyloidosis can be present in up to 10% of patients with multiple myeloma, predominantly of the IgG class and lambda type. Approximately 20% of these patients have an axonal neuropathy /14/. Refer to Tab. 22-26 â Findings in amyloidosis.\n\n25.6.4 Syndromes of the neuromuscular junction and muscle\n\nNeuromuscular diseases affect the nerves that control the voluntary muscles. Neurons send the messages that control these muscles. Most diseases causing muscle weakness that can lead to twitching, cramps, aches, pains and joint problems result from disorders of neuromuscular transmission and are associated with autoantibodies.\n\nRefer to:\n\nTab. 25.6-9 â Autoantibodies in immune-mediated muscular disease\n\nFig. 25.6-3 â Frequency of autoantibodies in immune- mediated muscular disease.\n\n25.6.4.1 Neuromuscular transmission\n\nEach muscle fiber is supplied by only a single axonal branch and has one neuromuscular junction. In the junction the presynaptic nerve terminal and the postsynaptic muscle membrane are separated by a 50 nanometer space. The nerve terminals contains an abundance of synaptic vesicles. Each vesicle contains about 5000â10.000 acetylcholine (ACh) molecules. When an electrical nerve impulse invades the motor nerve terminal, it causes voltage gated calcium channels in the nerve terminal to open, allowing Ca2+ to enter. When ACh is released from the motor nerve terminal, it crosses the synaptic cleft and binds to the acetylcholine receptor (AChR) at the muscle membrane. This induces a rapid increase in permeability in Na+, K+, as well as Ca2+ and Mg2+. The main function of ACh transmission at the neuromuscular junction is to trigger contractions of skeletal muscle.\n\nVoltage gated channels perform a unique role in excitable cells. By gating Ca2+ influx in response to depolarization, voltage gated Ca2+channels couple changes in membrane potential to numerous intracellular mechanisms regulated by Ca2+, including neurotransmitter release, muscle contraction, gene expression and cellular differentiation /16/.\n\n25.6.4.2 Neuromuscular junction disorders\n\nA range of antibody mediated disorders of the neuromuscular junction have been described (Tab. 25.6-9 â Autoantibodies in immune-mediated muscular disease), each associated with an autoantibody to a specific ligand gated receptor, voltage gated ion channel or related protein /17/. Besides autoantibodies directed against postsynaptic AChR (e.g., in myasthenia gravis) and autoantibodies that interfere with acetylcholine release at motor nerve terminals (e.g., in Lambert-Eaton myasthenia syndrome) autoantibodies against voltage gated calcium channels are of importance.\n\n25.6.4.3 Lambert-Eaton myasthenia syndrome (LEMS)\n\nLEMS is a presynaptic disorder of neuromuscular transmission characterized by reduction of ACh which is released from the synaptic vesicles of the nerve terminals in response to a nerve impulse. This process requires the influx of Ca2+ through voltage gated Ca2+channels into the nerve terminals. In LEMS, these channels are blocked by autoantibodies. Whereas at rest there is still sufficient release of acetylcholine into the synaptic cleft, this is not the case during muscle activity resulting in muscle weakness /18/.\n\nLEMS is an autoimmune disease mediated by autoantibodies against P/Q-type Î±1a voltage gated Ca2+ channel (VGCC) at motor nerve terminals. LEMS is a para neoplastic myasthenic syndrome and usually occurs in association with small cell lung cancer (SCLC). The antigenic stimulus for anti-VGCC autoantibody production with SCLC-LEMS appears to be tumor VGCC. About 40% of patients do not have a malignancy. It is believed that proteins of the SCLC provide the antigenic stimuli for autoantibody synthesis. The trigger for the production of anti-VGCC antibodies in individuals with LEMS without detectable lung cancer is unknown. The SCLC develops from cells that ontogenetically originate from the neural crest and form neuroectodermal peptides. The SCLC cells also have Ca2+ channels that are blocked by autoantibodies to voltage gated Ca2+channels /19/.\n\nClinical presentation\n\nLEMS accounts for 1% of myasthenic syndromes and develops in 3% of patients with SCLC. A frequent initial symptom is proximal muscle weakness, more commonly affecting the muscles of the lower extremities. Patients complain of feeling increasingly exhausted when walking and especially when climbing stairs. Further symptoms are clumsy movements, horizontal diplopia, ptosis and dysphagia. Autonomic disturbances usually begin with dry mouth.\n\n25.6.4.3.1 Laboratory findings\n\nAnti-VGCC autoantibodies are detected in 85% of patients using an immunoprecipitation assay with 125J-conotoxin-labeled MVIIC-VGCC.\n\n25.6.4.4 Neuromyelitis optica\n\nNeuromyelitis optica (NMO), or Devicâs syndrome, is an inflammatory demyelinating disorder of the CNS with lesions predominantly in the optic nerve and spinal cord /20/. It can cause blindness and/or paralysis. The longitudinally extensive transverse myelitis is more than three vertebral segments in length. The interval between optic neuritis and transverse myelitis can be several years. NMO can be monophasic or relapsing. The latter is more common in women.\n\n25.6.4.4.1 Laboratory findings\n\nThe anti-AQP4 antibody test has a diagnostic sensitivity of 99% and a specificity of 90%. The anti-AQP4 antibody concentration increases as the disease progresses and may not be pathological during the initial stage of clinical symptoms /20/. Anti-AQP4 antibodies may also be present in SLE, SjÃ¶grenâs syndrome and myasthenia gravis. Cerebrospinal fluid shows lymphocytic or neutrophil pleocytosis.\n\n25.6.4.5 Myasthenia gravis\n\nThe nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (AChR) belongs to the super family of neurotransmitter gated ion channels /21/. The transmitter of the neuromuscular interaction is acetylcholine (ACh). This is stored in the synapses of the motor nerve terminals and released into the synaptic cleft upon a nerve impulse. On the muscle membrane, ACh activates the AChR, causing the ion channel to open and the motor end plate to depolarize. The AChR is a glycoprotein with a molecular weight of 300 kDa.\n\nMyasthenia gravis is caused by autoantibodies to the muscle nicotinic P/Q-type AChR /22/. This leads to reduced membrane depolarization and weakened muscle action /21/.\n\nClinical presentation\n\nThe prevalence of myasthenia gravis is 40â50 per 1 million population. The early onset form of the disease is mainly seen in women aged 20â30 years, while the late onset form is more common in men aged over 50 years. Symptoms include skeletal muscle weakness, diplopia due to ocular myasthenia, ptosis, fatigable chewing due to pharyngeal muscle weakness, difficulty lifting arms and climbing stairs due to muscle weakness in limbs /22/. Most patients do not receive a clinical diagnosis until two years after symptoms first appear. Some patients are primarily given a psychiatric diagnosis. Most patients with myasthenia gravis have an abnormal thymus, 15% of them have a thymoma /23/.\n\nThere are various forms of myasthenia gravis:\n\nGeneralized myasthenia\n\nOcular myasthenia\n\nNeonatal myasthenia. Due to anti-AChR antibodies crossing the placenta into the fetal circulation, 12â20% of newborns to mothers with myasthenia gravis will have myasthenic symptoms such as difficulty swallowing, but these usually disappear within the first six months as the antibody concentration decreases.\n\nParaneoplastic myasthenia gravis. The disease is usually associated with thymic hyperplasia; in the paraneoplastic form there is a thymoma.\n\nCongenital myasthenia; is not of autoimmune origin and therefore autoantibody negative.\n\nRelevant autoantibodies in myasthenia are /23/:\n\nAnti-acetylcholine receptor antibodies (anti-AChR)\n\nAnti-muscle specific tyrosine kinase antibodies (anti-MuSK)\n\nAnti-ryanodine receptor antibodies\n\nAnti-titin antibodies.\n\nRefer to:\n\nFig. 25.6-4 â Antibody testing for suspected myasthenia gravis\n\nTab. 25.6-10 â Prevalence of antibodies in myasthenia gravis.\n\nNicotinic acetylcholine receptor antibodies (anti-AChr) and muscle-specific tyrosine kinase antibodies (anti-MuSK) are highly specific markers of myasthenia gravis detected in about 80â85% and 5â7% of patients, respectively /58/.\n\n25.6.4.5.1 Anti-acetylcholine receptor (anti-AChR)\n\nThe antibodies are detected in serum using an radioimmunoassay. The upper reference value is 0.25 nmol/L; a concentration above 0.4 nmol/L is indicative of myasthenia gravis /24/. A positive anti-AChR antibody test is diagnostic of myasthenia gravis; a negative test does not exclude the disease, since 10â20% of patients, in particular adolescent patients, are seronegative. However, two thirds of patients with anti-AChR antibodies have autoantibodies to muscle specific tyrosine kinase (MuSK).\n\nA commercial biochip (fixed CBA) using indirect immuno- fluorescence (IIF technology) has become available. The fixed CBA does not provide quantitative values but may represent a reliable alternative to RIPA as a first step for autoantibodies detection in m"
