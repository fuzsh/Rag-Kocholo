        "text": "Disease Overview\n\nSummary\n\nFatal familial insomnia (FFI) is a rare genetic degenerative brain disorder. It is characterized by an inability to sleep (insomnia) that may be initially mild, but progressively worsens, leading to significant physical and mental deterioration. Affected individuals may also develop dysfunction of the autonomic nervous system, the part of the nervous system that controls involuntary or automatic body processes – which are things that happen without a person thinking about them, such as body temperature regulation, sweating, breathing or regulating the heart rate. Specific symptoms depend on the part of the autonomic nervous system that is affected by the disease. In all instances, FFI is caused by an abnormal variant in the prion-related protein (PRNP) gene, although sometimes, the disorder occurs randomly, without a variant PRNP gene (sporadic fatal insomnia, or SFI). The PRNP gene regulates the production of human prion protein. Alterations in this gene lead to the generation of abnormally shaped (misfolded) prion protein, also known simply as a “prion”, which is toxic to the body. In FFI, the abnormal prions build up primarily within the thalamus of the brain. This leads to the progressive loss of nerve cells (neurons) and the various symptoms associated with this disorder. There is no cure, but investigators are researching ways to best treat and manage FFI.\n\nIntroduction\n\nFFI is classified as a transmissible spongiform encephalopathy (TSE) or a prion disease. Prion diseases are caused by the accumulation of misfolded prion proteins in the brain. Two other prion diseases, Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease and Gerstmann-Straussler-Scheinker syndrome, may also occur because of variations of the PRNP gene, although some prion diseases occur in the absence of a genetic variation. Generally, prion disorders are characterized by long incubation periods and short clinical duration, which means the abnormal prions may accumulate for many years without causing symptoms (long incubation period), but once symptoms begin the disorder rapidly worsens.\n\nView Full Report Show Less\n\nPrint / Download as PDF\n\nNext section >\n\n< Previous section\n\nNext section >\n\nSynonyms\n\nFFI\n\n< Previous section\n\nNext section >\n\n< Previous section\n\nNext section >\n\nSigns & Symptoms\n\nThe characteristic symptom in FFI is progressive insomnia. Insomnia often begins during middle age, but it can occur earlier or later in life. Insomnia may first be mild, but it then becomes progressively worse until an affected individual gets very little sleep. Insomnia usually begins suddenly and can rapidly worsen over the next few months. When sleep is achieved, vivid dreams may occur. The lack of sleep leads to physical and mental deterioration and the disease ultimately progresses to coma and death.\n\nAlthough insomnia is usually the first symptom, some individuals may present with progressive dementia, in which there are worsening problems with thought, cognition, memory, language and behavior. Initially, the signs may be subtle and include unintended weight loss, forgetfulness, inattentiveness, problems concentrating or speech problems. Episodes of confusion or hallucinations can eventually occur.\n\nSome affected individuals experience double vision (diplopia) or abnormal, jerky eye movements (nystagmus). There may be problems with swallowing (dysphagia) or slurred speech (dysarthria). Some individuals eventually have trouble coordinating voluntary movements (ataxia). Abnormal movements including tremors or twitchy, jerking muscle spasms (myoclonus), or Parkinson’s-like symptoms may also develop.\n\nAdditional symptoms involving dysfunction of the autonomic nervous system often develop. Specific symptoms can vary from one person to another based on the specific part of the autonomic nervous system affected. Common symptoms can include fever, rapid heart rate (tachycardia), high blood pressure (hypertension), increased sweating (hyperhidrosis), increased production of tears, constipation, variations in body temperature and sexual dysfunction including erectile dysfunction. Anxiety and depression are common findings as well.\n\n< Previous section\n\nNext section >\n\n< Previous section\n\nNext section >\n\nCauses\n\nFFI is caused by an abnormal variant (gene mutation) of the PRNP gene. Genes provide instructions for creating proteins that play a critical role in many functions of the body. When a mutation of a gene occurs, the protein product may be faulty, inefficient, absent or overproduced. Depending upon the functions of the protein, this can affect many organ systems of the body, including the brain.\n\nIn rare instances, the change (variation) in the PRNP gene in individuals with FFI occurs spontaneously, without a family history of the disease. This is called a new or de novo variant. The gene variation has occurred at the time of the formation of the egg or sperm for that child only, and no other family member will be affected. The disorder is usually not inherited from or “carried” by a healthy parent. However, the person who has this de novo variant could pass on the variant gene to their children in an autosomal dominant manner.\n\nDominant genetic disorders occur when only a single copy of a mutated gene is necessary to cause the disease. The mutated gene can be inherited from either parent or can be the result of a changed gene in the affected individual. The risk of passing the mutated gene from an affected parent to a child is 50% for each pregnancy. The risk is the same for males and females.\n\nSome individuals have developed fatal insomnia (FI) without a variation in the PRNP gene. These individuals are said to have sporadic fatal insomnia (SFI) and although this is a non-genetic form of FFI, the underlying trigger for its development is unknown. Thus, SFI occurs randomly, by chance, with a much rarer occurrence than FFI.\n\nThe PRNP gene produces a protein called prion protein, or PrP. The exact function of PrP in the body is not fully understood. However, because of the variant gene, the PrP that is produced develops an abnormal 3-dimensional shape that is described simply as “misfolded”. The misfolded PrP is toxic to the body, especially cells of the nervous system. In FFI, misfolded PrP is primarily found in the thalamus, which is a structure deep within the brain that helps to regulate many functions of the body including sleep, appetite and body temperature. As the misfolded PrP builds up in the thalamus, it results in a progressive destruction of nerve cells (neurons), which leads to the symptoms of the disorder. The damage to brain tissue may appear as sponge-like holes or gaps when examined under a microscope, which is why prion diseases like FFI are called transmissible spongiform encephalopathies.\n\nThe term “prion” was coined to designate a “proteinaceous infectious agent” to explain the transmissible nature of prion diseases. Extensive research has shown that a prion is essentially the misfolded PrP. However, it is important to know that FFI is not contagious in the traditional sense because the only way to transmit prion disease to a healthy individual is through direct exposure to disease-affected brain tissue, perhaps by ingestion or injection. If a person without an underlying genetic abnormality develops a prion disease because of exposure to prions from an external source, they are said to have an ‘acquired’ form. For example, variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease occurred in the United Kingdom when people ate prion-contaminated beef. A lesser-known example is kuru. Kuru is a virtually extinct prion disease that occurred in the Fore people of Papua New Guinea. The disease spread throughout this population because of the villagers’ practice of eating the brains of deceased kuru-affected tribesmen (ritualistic cannibalism). All other forms of prion disease are considered “sporadic” and occur spontaneously in a patient.\n\n< Previous section\n\nNext section >\n\n< Previous section\n\nNext section >\n\nAffected populations\n\nFFI is an extremely rare disorder. The exact incidence and prevalence of the disorder is unknown. The sporadic form of FFI, known as sporadic fatal insomnia (SFI), is extremely rare and has only been described in the medical literature in a few dozen people. Collectively, prion disorders affect 1 to 2 persons per million people in the general population per year. Genetic prion diseases are thought to make up about 15% of all individuals with prion diseases. Because rare diseases often go undiagnosed or misdiagnosed, it is difficult to determine their true frequency in the general population. FFI affects males and females in equal numbers. The average age of onset is 45-50 years old, although the disorder has been described in individuals in their teens and as late as their 70s. FFI has been described in populations around the world.\n\n< Previous section\n\nNext section >\n\n< Previous section\n\nNext section >\n\nDisorders with Similar Symptoms\n\nSymptoms of the following disorders can be similar to those of FFI. Comparisons may be useful for a differential diagnosis.\n\nOther prion disorders may have symptoms similar to those seen in FFI. There are five major additional prion diseases that have been identified affecting humans. These include kuru, Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, Gerstmann-Sträussler-Scheinker syndrome, and variably protease-sensitive prionopathy. These disorders are characterized by nerve cell loss and damage to the brain. Prion diseases also affect animals including bovine spongiform encephalopathy (mad cow disease) in cows and scrapie in sheep. Variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease has been acquired from eating beef contaminated with the abnormal prions that cause bovine spongiform encephalopathy.\n\nFrontotemporal degeneration is a group of varied disorders that are characterized by neurodegenerative changes that affect the brain, especially the frontal and temporal lobes, which control behavior and language. The clinical presentation of frontotemporal degeneration is diverse. Affected individuals can experience gradual changes in their behavior and personality, and they may have difficulties thinking and communicating effectively. The progression and the specific symptoms that develop can vary from one person to another. Generally, the clinical symptoms of these disorders can be broadly grouped into three categories which include changes in behavior, language and/or motor function. Frontotemporal degeneration is caused by progressive damage and loss of nerve cells in the frontal and temporal lobes of the brain. In most people, this is accompanied by a buildup of one or the other of two proteins, tau or TDP-43. In FTD these proteins are misfolded, which leads to their inappropriate buildup within brain cells and eventual disruption of the normal function of these cells. The FTD clinical subtypes can also be classified as ‘tauopathies’ or TDP43-opathies, depending on which misfolded protein accumulates in the brain. In about 10% of cases, a third protein, FUS, accumulates instead of tau or TDP43. The accumulation of tau protein or TDP-43 protein can also be observed in other neurological disorders. (For more information on this disorder, choose “frontotemporal degeneration” as your search term in the Rare Disease Database.)\n\nAlzheimer’s disease is a progressive condition of the brain that affects memory, thought, and language. The degenerative changes of Alzheimer’s disease lead to plaques, or clumps, of misfolded protein in the brain and the accumulation of misfolded protein inside the neuron (neurofibrillary tangles). Memory loss and behavioral changes occur because of these protein accumulations in brain tissue. Alzheimer’s disease is usually a slow progressive illness that is more common over the age of 65, in contrast to frontotemporal degeneration, which is more common in midlife and under age 65. Difficulty with short-term memory is usually the first symptom and early behavioral changes may not be noticed. As the disease progresses, memory loss increases and there are changes in personality, mood and behavior. Disturbances of judgment and concentration occur, along with confusion and restlessness. The type, severity, sequence and progression of mental changes vary widely. Long periods with little change are common, although occasionally the disease can be rapidly progressive.\n\nAdditional disorders can cause signs and symptoms similar to those seen in prion diseases like FFI including Huntington disease, progressive supranuclear palsy, dementia with Lewy Bodies, corticobasal degeneration, Hashimoto encephalopathy, paraneoplastic syndromes and multiple system atrophy. (For more information on these disorders, choose the specific disorder name as your search term in the Rare Disease Database.)\n\n< Previous section\n\nNext section >\n\n< Previous section\n\nNext section >\n\nDiagnosis\n\nA diagnosis of FFI is based upon identification of characteristic symptoms, a detailed patient history, a thorough clinical evaluation and a variety of specialized tests.\n\nClinical Testing and Workup\n\nMolecular genetic testing can confirm a diagnosis in some patients. Molecular genetic testing can detect an abnormal variant in the PRNP gene known to cause the disorder, but such testing is available only as a diagnostic service at specialized laboratories. In all cases of FFI, there will be an abnormal PRNP variant that is detectable, although negative genetic testing does not rule out SFI.\n\nPolysomnography, also called a sleep study, may be performed to demonstrate a reduced amount of time sleeping and difficulties transitioning through the various sleep stages.\n\nPositron emission tomography or PET scan is an advanced imaging technique that can be useful in diagnosing FFI or SFI. During a PET scan, three-dimensional images are produced that reflect the brain’s metabolic activity and can show reduced activity within the thalamus (thalamic hypometabolism), as a characteristic feature.\n\nOther neuroimaging techniques include computerized tomography (CT) scanning and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). CT scanning is not useful in the diagnosis of FFI or prion disease, while the MRI can show some abnormalities in the scan that may support prion disease, although its application to diagnose FFI is not well characterized. However, MRI and CT may be helpful in ruling out other conditions that may mimic FFI or prion disease. During CT scanning, a computer and x-rays are used to create a film showing cross-sectional images of certain tissue structures. An MRI uses a magnetic field and radio waves to produce cross-sectional images of organs and body tissues.\n\nTests may be ordered to detect the presence of the 14-3-3 protein. This is a normal protein produced when nerve cells die. Sometimes in individuals with FFI, levels of this protein increase substantially in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). CSF is the colorless fluid that surrounds the brain and spinal cord and provides protection and support. Elevated levels of 14-3-3 in the CSF do not always occur, and normal levels of this protein does not rule out FFI. The tau protein is also often elevated in the CSF of prion disease, although because of the rarity of FFI, the usefulness of testing for tau in FFI is not fully understood. More recently, a test called RTQuIC (real-time quaking induced conversion), that helps to detect low levels of prions in CSF, is now being used to assist in the diagnosis of prion disease and may be useful for FFI, but there is currently not enough data on that.\n\n< Previous section\n\nNext section >\n\n< Previous section\n\nNext section >\n\nStandard Therapies\n\nTreatment\n\nThere is no cure for FFI. Treatment is directed toward management of the specific symptoms that are apparent in each individual. Treatment may require the coordinated efforts of a team of specialists. Neurologists, psychiatrists, psychologists, pain specialists, social workers and other healthcare professionals may need to plan treatment systematically and comprehensively. Psychosocial support for the entire family is essential as well. Genetic counseling is recommended for affected individuals and their families.\n\nThere are no standardized treatment protocols or guidelines for affected individuals. Due to the rarity of the disease, there are no treatment trials that have been tested on a large group of patients. Various treatments have been reported in the medical literature as part of single case reports or small series of patients. Treatment trials would be very helpful to determine the long-term safety and effectiveness of specific medications and treatments for individuals with FFI.\n\nSymptomatic treatments include anti-seizure (anti-epileptics) medications for seizures or clonazepam for twitching movements (myoclonus). Affected individuals may be advised to discontinue any medications that worsen confusion, memory or insomnia.\n\n< Previous section\n\nNext section >\n\n< Previous section\n\nNext section >\n\nClinical Trials and Studies\n\nAs of July 2023, there are currently no specific therapeutic trials for FFI. Only quinacrine, an antimalarial agent, was studied in a controlled clinical trial of prion disease but failed. A clinical trial to assess the safety and potential benefit of an agent against prion disease in general, is currently being planned to start within the near future.\n\nInformation on current clinical trials is posted on the Internet at https://clinicaltrials.gov/.
