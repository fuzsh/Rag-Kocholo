Instead, direct fluorescent antibody test for T. pallidum should be used on such specimens.\n\nICD code(s)\n\nICD-11 code(s)\n\n1A61, 1A62\n\nICD-10 code(s)\n\nA51, A52\n\nComments\n\nEach category is mutually exclusive.\n\nThe possibility of a prozone reaction should be considered in individuals who are suspected of having secondary syphilis but whose non-treponemal test is non-reactive.\n\nA prozone reaction refers to a false-negative response resulting from overwhelming antibody titres that interfere with the proper formation of the antigen-antibody lattice network that is necessary to visualize a positive flocculation test.\n\nReferences\n\nCase definitions for diseases under national surveillance.
