The results are shown in Table 1. As a control the same tests were applied to the spinal fluid from twenty-nine patients unquestionably suffering from psychoses other than general paresis. The fluids were obtained by lumbar puncture, about 10 c.c. being removed as a rule. The patients were kept in bed for twenty-four hours after the operation and no dangerous results occurred. Headache, dizziness, backache, and sometimes nausea followed, but no more severe symptoms were noted.
