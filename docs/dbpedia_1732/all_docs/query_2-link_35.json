These repositories now need to accommodate data coded with the Tenth Revision (ICD-10-CM). Database users wish to retrieve relevant data regardless of the system by which they are coded. We demonstrate how a terminology repository (the Research Entities Dictionary or RED) serves as an ontology relating terms of both ICD versions to each other to support seamless version-independent retrieval from the Biomedical Translational Research Information System (BTRIS) at the National Institutes of Health. We make use of the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services’ General Equivalence Mappings (GEMs) to reduce the modeling effort required to determine whether ICD-10-CM terms should be added to the RED as new concepts or as synonyms of existing concepts. A divide-and-conquer approach is used to develop integration heuristics that offer a satisfactory interim solution and facilitate additional refinement of the integration as time and resources allow.\n\nIntroduction\n\nMany patient diagnoses are recorded in electronic databases using codes from the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision (ICD-9-CM, or I9 for short).1 When these data are included in longitudinal databases, such as clinical data repositories, challenges arise with each annual I9 update. For example, when searching for patients with septic shock, a researcher looking for data prior to 2008 would need to use the I9 codes 785.59* and 998.02 (Shock without mention of trauma, not elsewhere classified and Postoperative shock, septic, respectively). However, a longitudinal study of patient records coded with the I9 code 785.59 would show a sharp decrease in incidence in 2008. Unfortunately, this is not due to development of effective measures for the prevention of septic shock but rather due to the addition of the I9 code 785.52 (Septic shock), with a concomitant change in the implicit meaning of 785.59 and a corresponding decrease in its use to code data. Researchers are often unaware of how such changes impact their work.2 Mitigating impact of updates on the use of data repositories requires special measures.3\n\nSuch challenges are likely to be even greater for US researchers when, in 2014, I9 is replaced by the International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision (ICD-10-CM, or I10 for short).4 I10 is much larger than I9; some of this increase is due to more finely grained terms (for example, Postoperative Shock, Septic is being replaced by the three terms Postprocedural septic shock, initial encounter, Postprocedural septic shock, subsequent encounter, and Postprocedural septic shock, sequela). I10 also contains terms that are similar, but not synonymous, with I9 terms (for example, Septic shock is being replaced by Severe sepsis with septic shock). Past I9 updates, involving dozens or hundreds of changes pale in comparison to the change that I10 brings, with tens of thousands of new codes.\n\nWe have previously described a method for coping with annual I9 updates through the use of a controlled terminology resource that maps multiple external terminologies to a single, coherent terminology for use within a single institutional clinical data repository.3 This paper describes the application of that methodology to adapt to the inclusion of I10 data into a repository that contains patient diagnostic data coded in part with I9.\n\nBackground\n\nThe Biomedical Translational Research Information System (BTRIS)\n\nBTRIS is a repository of clinical research data collected at the Clinical Center, a 240-bed hospital on the National Institutes of Health campus in Bethesda, Maryland. It includes data from electronic health records and clinical trials management systems dating back to 1953. Along with clinical notes, laboratory test results, procedure reports, vital sign measurements, medication administration records, electrocardiograms, radiologic images, mass spectrograms, and exome data, BTRIS includes 1.9 million discharge diagnoses assigned to hospital admissions, coded in I9.5\n\nThe Research Entities Dictionary (RED)\n\nThe RED is a terminology repository modeled after Columbia University Medical Center’s Medical Entities Dictionary (MED).6 The RED contains all the terms from the various controlled terminologies that are used by each of the BTRIS data sources to code their data. Each term is mapped to a corresponding concept in the RED, usually in a one-to-one manner, although where terms from multiple sources are clearly synonymous, they may be mapped to single concepts. Each concept is assigned a unique identifier (the “RED Code”), which is stored with the source data in BTRIS.\n\nRED concepts are organized in a directed acyclic graph of hierarchical is-a relationships that can be used to query BTRIS in a class-based manner. Using a single RED code, one can find all patients with a diagnosis of any infectious disease, any foodborne infectious disease, any disease caused by the infectious organism Salmonella, or a particular disease (e.g., typhoid fever). Terms from disparate data sources are organized into the same classification structure so that, for example, a query for a disease term will retrieve data coded with I9 codes from the current EHR and previous Clinical Center EHRs, rare disease terms coded by the Medical Records Department, and problem list terms from one of the clinical trials management systems. shows an example of the RED hierarchy.\n\nRED maintenance is an ongoing task, involving two full-time ontologists. Changes to source terminologies must be characterized as changes in syntax and/or semantics. For example, if a data source changes the name of a term (syntax), a determination must be made as to whether the change reflects a minor name change (no change in meaning, requiring a simple update to the term information assigned to the corresponding RED concept) or a major name change (a change in meaning, requiring retirement of the existing RED concept the creation of a new one).3\n\nThe addition of a new data source to BTRIS usually requires addition of one or more new terminologies in the RED. Here the task is somewhat different. The first priority is to make sure there is a RED concept that corresponds to each source term; this allows data to be stored in the BTRIS database and supports simple queries (e.g., “get all the patient diagnoses”). The second priority is to place the new concepts into the existing RED hierarchy, or add new hierarchical concepts, as appropriate to the meaning of the terms; this supports the more sophisticated class-based queries (as described in ). Ideally, if the new term is synonymous with an existing source term, it will be added as a synonym to an existing RED concept. However, this usually requires time-consuming manual review and is actually the lowest priority. Redundant concepts clutter the RED and might confuse a user looking for terms with which to search BTRIS, but they do not adversely affect retrieval of data and can be corrected retroactively by merging concepts in the RED and replacing RED Codes in BTRIS.\n\nGeneral Equivalence Mappings (GEMs)\n\nThe National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) has developed a bidirectional general equivalence mapping (GEM) system to assist users of I9 and I10 in deciding how to change their coding practices and understand how data coded in I9 and I10 relate to each other. NCHS, together with the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) has published files that can be used as the basis for translating between I9 and I10 terms.7\n\nThe GEM mappings consist of two files, one in which each I9 code is listed at least once, with a set of flags associating it with one or more I10 codes, and one in which each I10 codes is listed at least once, with a set of flags associating it with one or more I9 codes.8 The flags consist of five digits, with meanings as shown in .\n\nMethods\n\nOur general approach to adding I10 terms to the RED is to examine the pairings with I9 codes provided in the GEMs and use the flags to suggest synonymy with or relationships to existing RED concepts. Relationships can include “child” (added to the hierarchy under the existing concept), “parent” (inserted into the hierarchy above the existing concept), or “sibling” (added to the hierarchy under the parent(s) of the existing concept). Using a “divide and conquer” approach,9 we partitioned GEM mappings according to the following steps:\n\nGEM flags were used to create four partitions: 00000 – potential synonyms; 10000 (“similar” flag set) – potential children, parents or siblings; 101xx (“combination” flag set) - potential children, parents or siblings; and 01000 (“no mapping” flag set) – new concept\n\nWe divided the 10000 (“similar”) partition into four partitions based on the cardinality of terms involved the I10-to-I9 mappings: one-to-one mappings, one-to-many mappings, many-to-one mappings and many-to-many mappings (note that the “potential synonyms” partition is by definition one-to-one and the “combination” partition is by definition one-to-many or many-to-many but was not further subdivided; thus, the fourth and fifth flags were not considered further, as their complexity requires case-by-case review)\n\nEach of the above partitions (except the new concept partition, in which there are no corresponding I9 terms) were further divided into based on the whether any of the I10 or I9 terms contained the word “other” or the phrase “not elsewhere classified”; this was done because the semantics of these terms can never be precisely determined (even the GEM mappings state that identical term names are not synonymous if they are “other” terms10); the phrases “not otherwise specified” and “other and unspecified” were excluded from this consideration since they actually equivalent to the generic class terms; regardless of their original partition, “other” mappings were evaluated as potential children, parents or siblings\n\nWithin each of the resulting partitions (except the new concept partition, in which there are no corresponding I9 terms), we performed automated comparisons of the I10 and I9 terms names for similarity:\n\n○ Name match: exact match between terms; treated as potential synonyms\n\n○ Normalized name match: terms were normalized as follows prior to comparison: all letters capitalized, punctuation removed, words replaced with preferred forms using a set of previously described word synonyms,11 stop words (“A”, “AN”, “AND”, “OR”, “THE”, “UNSPECIFIED”, and “WITH”) removed, and remaining words sorted alphabetically; for example, “Typhoid meningitis” becomes “MENINGITIDES TYPHOID”; treated as potential synonyms\n\n○ Non-name match: no exact match between original names or normalized names; treated as potential children, parents or siblings\n\nWe manually examined each partition to identify patterns of semantic relationships between the I10 and I9 terms. For example, we did not automatically assume that I10 and I9 terms were synonymous just because their GEM mapping was “00000” if the names (or normalized names) did not match. Similarly, we did not assume that terms were not synonymous just because their GEM mapping was “10000” if their names (or normalized names) matched and they were not “other” terms.\n\nThese manual examinations of each partition led to development of general decision rules, or heuristics, to apply to each I10-I9 pair. Based on the decions, the following actions were taken:\n\nsynonym - I10 term code and name added to existing I9 RED concept\n\nchild - new term added as child of existing I9 RED concept (new leaf node in hierarchy)\n\nsibling - new term added as new leaf node child of the parent(s) of the existing I9 RED concept\n\nparent - new term added as parent of existing RED concept (inserted into hierarchy above I9 concept).\n\nOnce the general rule was established, we began to manually review these decisions to find exceptions. This process allowed us to add I10 terms to the RED in bulk fashion with subsequent review and, where appropriate, correction (split synonyms into new and old concepts, merge synonymous concepts, and reclassify new concepts).\n\nResults\n\nGeneral RED Inclusion Rules for Partitions of GEM Mappings\n\nshows the size of each of the partitions of GEM mappings. Also shown are the initial mapping decisions for each partition, plus any decisions made based on manual review to date. shows examples of each of these mappings.\n\nTable 1:\n\nGEM FlagsI10 to I9

GEM “synonymous” (00000) mapping were initially considered to be synonyms. After manual review, we agreed with these mappings for all pairs in which the names (or normalized names) matched. shows an example of a synonym mapping in the RED. However, our manual review of the “non-name match” partition discovered 95 pairs that we considered to be non-synonymous, such as the I10 term Newborn (suspected to be) affected by maternal hypertensive disorders (P00.0) and the I9 term Maternal hypertensive disorders affecting fetus or newborn (760.0); we understand the I9 term as a diagnosis that is applied to the parent of the newborn and the I10 term as a diagnosis that is applied to the newborn itself.\n\nAn example of combination mappings can be found with the I10 term Salmonella sepsis (A02.1), which has a GEM map of 10111 to the I9 term Salmonella septicemia (003.1) and a GEM map of 10112 to the I9 term Salmonella sepsis (995.91). In this example, there is only one scenario (fourth flag) with two choices (fifth flag). In this case, we determined that the I10 term should be added as a new concept in the RED and placed in the hierarchy under the existing concepts for both of the I9 terms.\n\nRepeating Patterns of Many-to-One Mappings\n\nBy far, the largest partition is the many-to-one approximate (10000) mappings, with 57,236 I10 codes mapping to 4192 I9 codes. Our initial assessment was that most of these mappings represent a refinement of an I9 term into many I10 terms. However, when we reviewed specific sets of mappings, we noticed recurring patterns. For example, 996 of the I9 codes map to exactly two I10 terms. In 261 cases, one of these is an “other” term and the other is not. More broadly, the mappings to 768 I9 terms (18.3%) include exactly one “non-other” I10 term. Examination of these sets shows that, in general, if the I9 term is represented as “X”, one I10 term can be represented as “Other specified X” and the remaining I10 terms are more specific forms of X. If this is true for all such “one ‘other’ and many ‘non-other’” patterns, we can with confidence add all of these I10 terms as children of their corresponding I9 term. A similar rule may apply for the 2498 (59.6%) I9 terms that have no “other” I10 terms in their set of maps.\n\nClass-Based Retrieval of BTRIS Data across ICD Versions\n\nThe ultimate purpose of all this work is to support the storage and retrieval of BTRIS data in as accurate and seamless a manner as possible. A perfect ontology is probably impossible, given all the subtle nuances of the differences among and between I9 and I10 codes. Recoding all the I9 data with I10 codes is not practical and would likely lead to inaccuracies. Requiring users seeking to retrieve data to select a code from each terminology version might be accurate but would be confusing and awkward. The I10 update we are applying to the RED provides a practical solution. shows an example of the new hierarchy of RED concepts that include mappings to I9 and I10 terms. BTRIS supports class-based queries so that a user could, for example, query for the RED concept Herpes Zoster Complicated and retrieve all data coded with the I9 codes 053.8, 053.2 and 053.29 and with the I10 codes B02.30, B02.31 and B02.34.\n\nDiscussion\n\nA clinical data repository that combines I9 and I10 data without a coordinated terminology solution has two options: either re-code all the old I9 data with I10 or force users to query using both I9 and I10 terms. Our use of a single repository terminology, the RED, provides significant benefits to our users: they use a single terminology to perform queries that includes not only I9 and I10 terms but several other local diagnosis terminologies. The RED also provides the benefit of multiple hierarchies, so that users are not restricted to either of the single hierarchies of in I9 or I10, and they can still query for specific I9 or I10 terms if desired. The ontology approach – regardless of how the maintenance is accomplished - reduces the need to include multiple terms in queries. While this probably improves query execution somewhat, the real saving is a reduction in the BTRIS user’s effort to construct a comprehensive query.\n\nRED maintenance requires significant human effort. The manual integration of a new terminology of I10’s magnitude would require many months of work, much of it mind-numbing and prone to error. The GEM mappings have been of tremendous benefit for providing a first approximation of synonymy and classification of I10 terms. The result is that I10 terms can be added quickly and be made useful immediately for both storing and retrieving patient data. Where revisions are required to merge redundant terms, split ambiguous ones, or reorganize the hierarchy, the amount of effort needed is no more that would be needed if we were to try to get everything “right” prior to loading I10 into the RED. Meanwhile, our use of GEM-based heuristics allows us to have a working, integrated repository while proceeding with “tuning” the RED. We now have the luxury of prioritizing our reviews based on the I10 terms as they actually start appearing in patient records.\n\nIn addition to continued work at reviewing and revising the I10 additions to the RED, we will continue to study the patterns of the many-to-one “similar” GEM mappings to determine if they can be used to improve the relationships between I9 and I10 terms. We will also need to make changes as updates to I10 occur; one of these has taken place already.\n\nWhile the GEMs are obviously limited to use with I9 and I10, their existence raises the possibility of similar approaches to other mappings, such as between various drug terminologies or between I10 and the Systematized Nomenclature of Medicine (SNOMED-CT). The actual methods used and level of effort needed to develop the GEMs is not published, but it is interesting to consider whether similar tools could be developed for other term mappings.\n\nWhen our ontology-based method for coping with I9 changes was originally published in 1996, Tuttle and Nelson praised it in an accompanying editorial but lamented the need for having to carry out “reverse engineering”. They went on to say:\n\nSuch methods should be viewed as necessary short-term expedients only, and all parties concerned should work toward an incremental plan by which the intent of changes to controlled health-care vocabularies can be made both explicit and machine processible. Only then can the comparability of patient descriptions be sustained.12\n\nWe, too, await such changes.13 In the meantime, while the GEMs are not machine processable, they are at least machine readable and appear to be based on sound terminologic principles. Furthermore the ontologic approach of mapping terms to concepts and then coding data based on those concepts has proven to be a valuable precedent that continues to provide value in dealing with local and standard terminologies alike.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe practice of using an ontology that integrates disparate clinical terminologies has proven to be a powerful method for meeting the challenges of adapting a clinical data repository to include I10 data while maintaining the value of legacy I9 data. Our approach is able to take advantage of the GEM mappings from CMS to provide a rapid solution that can evolve gracefully.\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nDrs.
