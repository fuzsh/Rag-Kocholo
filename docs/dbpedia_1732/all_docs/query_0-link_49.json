Mariani, A. De Simone, R. Villani\n\nAorn A. Cardarelli, Napoli, Italy\n\nCorrespondence: M. Mariani\n\nJournal of Anesthesia, Analgesia and Critical Care 2023, 3(Suppl 1):A1\n\nSedation may be defined as a drug-induced depression in the level of consciousness. The purpose of sedation and analgesia is to relieve patient anxiety and discomfort, improve the outcome of the examination, and diminish the patient's memory of the event. Inadequate sedation/analgesia is to be avoided at any cost, given it may result in undue patient discomfort or patient injury because of lack of cooperation. In most cases, it can affect the endoscopist’s ability to successfully complete the procedure.\n\nOverall, there is no consensus on optimal depth of sedation or sedative agents, however, when it comes to routine, low-risk and moderate endoscopic procedures the administration of propofol in unintubated patients, termed “monitored anesthesia care (MAC)”, paired with benzodiazepine and/or opioids, is one of the most common sedation methods for GI procedures in North America and Europe. On the other hand, Emergency upper GI endoscopy is often prolonged and complex, performed during high-risk conditions, like acute upper GI hemorrhage, sub-acute bowel obstruction/ileus, food bolus, achalasia, Morbid obesity and SpO2 < 95% with supplemental oxygen. In these patients, the upper GI endoscopy is intrinsically aggravated by the increasing risk for airway compromise and sedation can, in addition, put patients at risk of entry into general anesthesia, rendering them unconscious and potentially incapable of protecting their airway, patients may require assistance in maintaining a patent airway, and spontaneous ventilation may be inadequate.\n\nScarce literature can be found providing guidance on the anesthesiologic conduct during upper GI endoscopy in Emergency, and despite the above-mentioned risks, the present retrospective study conducted on 100 patients treated in the Emergency Gastroenterology Unit at AORN Cardarelli aim at demonstrating that deep sedation obtained with the administration of propofol, benzodiazepine and opioids is a safe and viable option when it comes to complex upper GI endoscopy, especially in those patients where the risk-benefit ratio for general anesthesia is not optimal. The present study can address some of the current literature’s shortages on this topic, however further studies are needed to better support these results.\n\nA2 Oral procedural sedation in an ambulatory service dedicated to the healthcare of people with disabilities\n\nE.

Valeri\n\nJournal of Anesthesia, Analgesia and Critical Care 2023, 3(Suppl 1):A2\n\nIntroduction: Morbidity and mortality of people with disabilities are significantly higher than in the general population, this is due to the difficulty in accessing care. People with disabilities die 20 years earlier than the average of people without disabilities from causes unrelated to the cause of the disability, 30 years earlier in the case of severe intellectual disability.\n\nThe difficulty in accessing treatment is often due to the lack of collaboration and low tolerance towards the healthcare environment and for this reason physical restraint has been and is often used to provide services, even non-invasive or minimally invasive. This increases the resistance and fear of patients towards the healthcare environment, with greater difficulties in subsequent accesses.\n\nSince 2000 with the DAMA Project (Disable Advanced Medical Assistance) and since 2017 in Tuscany with the PASS project (Assistance Paths for People with Special Needs) dedicated paths have been created to facilitate access to care for people with disabilities.\n\nTools: The DAMA-PASS clinic has been active in the ASL Toscana Centro, at the S. Giuseppe hospital in Empoli, managed by a multidisciplinary team made up of anesthesiologists, internists, facilitator nurses, and specialists who are involved case-by-case. The presence of the anesthetist is essential for those patients for whom it is not possible to obtain collaboration in any way except with sedation, absolutely avoiding physical restraint.\n\nWith the consent of the legal administrator, non-cooperative patients are subjected to oral sedation in the NORA regimen, this may be necessary for the execution of non-invasive tests or it may be preparatory to obtaining a venous access in order to carry out continuous sedation with intravenous drugs for invasive procedures. Oral sedation is performed with midazolam, mixed with a drink the patient likes, in the range of 0.3 mg/kg to 1.3 mg/kg.\n\nResults: Since 2015 we have taken care of 438 patients (250 males, 188 females). Of these, 164 patients required sedation. Oral sedation involved 64 males (25.5% of the total males) for a total of 103 oral sedations and 21 females (11.2% of the total females) for a total of 28 oral sedations.\n\nThe mean midazolam dose used was 0.7 ± 0.2 mg/kg body weight in males, 0.6 ± 0.2 mg/kg body weight in females. We obtained, with an onset of 20-25', a moderate-deep sedation (RASS - 3/ - 5) which allowed the positioning of the venous access and the subsequent procedures without restraint. Complete awakening occurred spontaneously after 60-90' in 50% of the patients, for others flumazenil 0.5-0.8 mg was administered IV.\n\nSide effects are rare: one case of bronchospasm, one case of paradoxical reaction to midazolam and three cases of resistance to midazolam. Only one case required hospitalization for observation.\n\nConclusions: The DAMAPASS of the San Giuseppe di Empoli hospital has guaranteed the provision of care to patients with specific needs in an appropriate and non-traumatic way, thus restoring the real right to health and dignity.\n\nOral sedation with midazolam has been shown to be acceptable to the patient, repeatable, predictable, reliable and safe.\n\nA3 Virtual outpatient sedation and vascular implants in oncological patients\n\nP.

Mignone\n\nJournal of Anesthesia, Analgesia and Critical Care 2023, 3(Suppl 1):A3\n\nBACKGROUND\n\nPatient pain is usually managed with analgesic therapy. However, recent studies have focused on non pharmacological treatments and, among them, virtual reality hypnosis - VRH - (i.e. digital sedation) is an innovative technique that reduces pain and anxiety in clinical practice. During VRH patients wear virtual lens and headphones through which they are conducted in a virtual reality, an immersive virtual experience that combines a 3D video with music, sounds and/or voice. Immersion session follows standard phases of hypnosis. During the induction phase, subjects are over the surface of the sea. They are invited to induce progressive relaxation in their body. The guidance phase brings the subjects slowly under the water. During the deepening phase, subjects follow a soothing underwater experience. The realtering phase brings the subjects progressively back into reality.\n\nMATHERIALS AND METHODS\n\nOur clinical experience has focused on the positioning of implanted vascular devices (PICC, PICC-PORT, FICC-PORT) in oncological adult patients (30 px control) and the combined use of VRH (30 px study).\n\nWe have previously collected informed consent, monitored vital parameters (NIPB, HR), and started VRH in the study group during the positioning of the vascular device.\n\nAt the end of the procedure we have collected a satisfactory questionnaire reported to the scale of anxiety (Hamilton Scale Anxiety).\n\nWe have also timed the procedure in both groups.\n\nRESULTS\n\nWe have noticed that patients in the study group have evaluated virtual reality as a pleasant experience, reducing their feeling of anxiety. Vital parameters presented less variability in study group (HR started from 100 HR average to 65 HR average during the surgical procedure), meanwhile in the control group the average HR was 90 during the procedure.\n\nIn the study group the time required to carry out the procedure was shorter than control group (30 minutes in study group vs 45 minutes in control group).\n\nCONCLUSIONS\n\nVirtual Reality Hypnosis can improve performance combined with surgical practice, increasing patients’ compliance and reducing time necessary to carry out the procedures, that can help the cut of healthcare costs.\n\nAuthors have no conflict of interest\n\nREFERENCES\n\nVirtual reality hypnosis in the management of pain: Self- reported and neurophysiological measures in healthy subjects Floriane Rousseaux et al.

Bortone, C. Ferialdi, M. Cacciapaglia\n\nOspedale SS Annunziata, Taranto, Italy\n\nCorrespondence: G. Bortone\n\nJournal of Anesthesia, Analgesia and Critical Care 2023, 3(Suppl 1):A4\n\nBackground\n\nIntranasal application of drugs is widely used in pediatric anesthesia, especially for surgical premedication or diagnostic non-painful procedures [1,2]. Midazolam [3,4] and recently Dexmedetomidine [5-6] are most common drugs used as a single intranasal sedative in pediatric population. This retrospective study seeks to evaluate the efficacy and safety of intranasal dexmedetomidine plus midazolam (IN) as a sedatives for diagnostic Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) examinations in children.\n\nMethods\n\nChildren 3 to 10 years of age (Table 1), ASA 1-2, undergoing sedation for brain MRI with contrast were enrolled.\n\nA combination of Dexmedetomidine (4 mcg/kg) plus midalozam (0,2 mg/kg) was administered IN before the procedure. The IN cohort (32 children) was matched and compared to a cohort of subjects (44 children) who underwent sedation with IN dexmedetomidine (4mcg/kg) plus endovenous midazolam (0,05-0,1 mg/kg)(EV). MRI was started when subjects reached a deep sedation, according to University of Michigan Sedation Scale (UMSS). We included only good or excellent image quality, with no or almost absent motion artifacts. We evaluated adverse events, i.e. bradycardia, desaturation, nausea, interventions and procedure times. Children were required to have a UMSS of 0 or 1, an Aldrete score > 9 to discharge.\n\nResults\n\nAll 32 children of IN group were successfully sedated; there were no significant differences in the rate of observed adverse events/interventions in comparison to the EV cohort (Table 2).\n\nFurthermore, the IN group had a shorter onset time (Table 3) when compared to the EV cohort (p < 0.003), which had a significant effect on procedure and recovery times (p < 0.001).\n\nConclusions\n\nTotal intranasal sedation may be used for children undergoing MRI scans. The IN combination of Dexmedetomidine and Midazolam is a safe and effective form of sedation in pediatric patients showing faster onset and discharge times.\n\nWritten informed consent was obtained from the parents of included children.\n\nReferences\n\nFantacci C, Fabrizio G C, Ferrara P, Franceschi F, Chiaretti A.

Zanusso, G.M. De Benedictis, L. Bellini\n\nDepartment of Animal, Production and Health, University of Padova, Legnaro, Italy\n\nCorrespondence: F. Zanusso\n\nJournal of Anesthesia, Analgesia and Critical Care 2023, 3(Suppl 1):A5\n\nLocal perfusion on the measurement site affects the accuracy of pulse oximetry to estimate arterial hemoglobin oxygen saturation [1]. Using the ratio of pulsatile to non-pulsatile blood flow detected by the probe, the CO-oximeter measures the Perfusion Index (PI) that quantifies local perfusion [2]. Moreover, multi-wave CO-oximetry can estimate arterial partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) between 100 to 200 mmHg calculating the Oxygen Reserve index (ORi) based on the simultaneous measurement of arterial and venous blood light absorption using a similar technology of traditional pulse oximetry [3,4]. This prospective observational study investigates if changes in PI affect the ability of ORi to estimate PaO2 in anaesthetized dogs.\n\nThirty anaesthetized and mechanically ventilated dogs undergoing elective procedures were connected to a multi-wave pulse CO-oximeter by a probe wrapped around the tongue to measure ORi and PI. As the pulse signal was judged stable, an arterial blood sample was analysed to obtain the PaO2. The residuals calculated from the regression model that plotted ORi over PaO2 were analysed with a linear regression to investigate the correlation between the PI measured by the device and the PaO2 measured by the blood gas analyser. To identify a range of PI with the strongest correlation between ORi and PaO2, paired measurements, organized according to ascending values of PI, were subset evenly into 4 groups containing 21 paired values (PI1, PI2, PI3, PI4), and the correlation analysis was recalculated for each.\n\nA total of 84 paired measurements were collected, and PaO2 ranged between 72 and 288 mmHg. The median PI value was 1.41 (0.23-3.40). The correlation between ORi and PaO2 was moderate (r=0.69, p<0.001), and the residuals calculated from the regression line moderately correlated with PI (r=0.47, p<0.001). In groups PI1, PI2, PI3 and PI4, the obtained PI ranges were 0.23-0.80, 0.84-1.40, 1.41-1.90, and 2.00-3.40, respectively. No significant differences were observed in PaO2 values among groups (p=0.836). The strongest correlation between ORi and PaO2 was detected in the PI2 (r=0.89, p<0.001), while in PI4, the correlation was not significant (r=0.42, p=0.060).\n\nIn anaesthetized healthy dogs, the ability of ORi to estimate the PaO2 correctly was lower if the CO-oximeter displays a PI >2, likely because changes in the pulsatile and non-pulsatile component of lingual blood flow alter the performances of the probe. The value of PI should be taken into consideration if ORi is used to titrate oxygen therapy.\n\nReferences\n\nSchallom L, Sona C, McSweeney M, Mazuski J Comparison of forehead and digit oximetry in surgical/trauma patients at risk for decreased peripheral perfusion Heart Lung. 2007;36(3):188-94.\n\nGayat E, Aulagnier J, Matthieu E, Boisson M, Fischler M.

Serpieri\n\nJournal of Anesthesia, Analgesia and Critical Care 2023, 3(Suppl 1):A6\n\nBackground\n\nThe presence of pain in rabbits leads to increased recovery times, stress, decreased gastrointestinal motility with reduced appetite and fecal output [1]. Composite pain scales, such as CANCRS (Centro Animali Non Convenzionali Rabbit Scale), are useful tools for pain assessment in rabbits [1,2]. NSAIDS such as meloxicam and carprofen have analgesic effects and are commonly used after elective surgical procedures; although meloxicam is a well-tested NSAID in rabbits, carprofen has been evaluated to a lesser extent [3,4]. The aim of this study was the comparison between the post-operative effects of meloxicam and carprofen after ovariectomy in rabbits.\n\nMaterials and methods\n\n16 mixed-breed domestic rabbits, undergoing elective ovariectomy, were included in this study and divided in 2 Groups, consisting of 8 subjects each. A signed informed consent was obtained. A mix of ketamine, medetomidine and butorphanol (20, 0.4, and 0.2 mg/kg) was administered IM to obtain anesthesia, and ovariectomy was performed. The NSAIDs were post-operatively administered for three days, SQ SID: Group M, 1 mg/kg meloxicam; Group C, 2 mg/kg carprofen. All rabbits received 5 mg/kg enrofloxacin SQ SID and 1 mg/kg metoclopramide SQ BID for three days.\n\nRabbits were evaluated using CANCRS at 5 time points (T0: baseline, T1-T4: respectively, 6 h after surgery and at 9 am, 1.30 pm, and 6 pm the day after). Also, time of spontaneous feeding and fecal output after recovery were recorded. Statistical analysis was performed with R (v. 4.3.0), considering a significance level of p<0.05. Anova for repeated measures with Bonferroni post-hoc test was used for the analysis of the CANCRS score over time; Mann-Whitney U test was used for comparisons of CANCRS final scores and for times of spontaneous feeding and fecal output between Groups.\n\nResults\n\nThere were no significant differences between Groups in CANCRS final score between groups at any time point (Table 1), and in times of spontaneous feeding and fecal output (both p=0.63) (Table 2).\n\nConclusions\n\nThe absence of differences in final scores between Groups suggests that both NSAIDs had similar effects in alleviating post-operative pain, although maximum time to fecal output was shorter in group C. The greater final score for CANCRS was at T1: however, it was beneath the score indicating pain during rabbit gastrointestinal syndrome. Meloxicam and carprofen are therefore both suitable alternatives for post-surgical pain management in female rabbits undergoing ovariectomy.\n\nReferences\n\nMiller AL, Leach MC.

Mirra\n\nJournal of Anesthesia, Analgesia and Critical Care 2023, 3(Suppl 1):A7\n\nBackground\n\nMethylphenidate, an inhibitor of dopamine and norepinephrine reuptake transporters, has been suggested to shorten and improve anesthesia recovery [1-3]. In a previous study, we have demonstrated its lack of effect when administered at the end of anesthesia in experimental pigs. The aim of the present research was to evaluate if its administration at extubation would enhance anesthesia recovery.\n\nMaterials and methods\n\nSixteen healthy pigs, 10.0 ± 0.6-week-old (mean ± standard deviation), weighting 28.9 ± 4.7 kg, and of mixed sex (ten females and six castrated males) were included in this experimental, randomized study. A sole propofol infusion was started at a rate of 10 mg/kg/hour and increased by 10 mg/kg/hour every 15 minutes, until reaching an electroencephalographic suppression ratio (SR; as calculated by the SedLine monitor) >80%. Afterwards, propofol was stopped and the pig let recovery. Immediately after extubation, either saline (group SL) or methylphenidate 20 mg/kg (group MP) was administered IV. The following parameters were assessed at baseline, 5 (TP5), 10 (TP10) and 15 (TP15) minutes after methylphenidate administration: heart rate, respiratory rate, diastolic (DAP), mean (MAP) and systolic (SAP) blood pressure, nociceptive withdrawal reflex thresholds, patient state index (PSI), suppression ratio, spectral edge frequency 95% right (SEF r) and left (SEF l). Moreover, time to return of palpebral reflex and jaw tone, and time to return to a PSI of 50, 60, 70 and 80 was calculated. Comparison among groups was performed using the two-way repeated measure ANOVA followed by the Bonferroni test in case of parametric data and the Kruskal-Wallis test followed by the Dunn's Method in case of non-parametric data.\n\nResults\n\nSignificantly higher DAP was found at TP5 in group MP compared to group SL (p=0.046). Significantly higher SEF r values were found at TP5 in group MP compared to group SL (p=0.038). No other significant differences were found.\n\nConclusions\n\nThe present research confirms the results of our previous study. No clinically relevant improvements in anesthesia recovery were achieved when administering methylphenidate at extubation in experimental pigs.\n\nEthical approval (protocol 32015) was obtained from the committee for animal experiments, canton Bern.\n\nReferences\n\nChemali JJ, Van Dort CJ, Brown EN, Solt K.

Levionnois\n\nUniversity of Bern, Vetsuisse Faculty, Bern, Switzerland\n\nCorrespondence: A. Mirra\n\nJournal of Anesthesia, Analgesia and Critical Care 2023, 3(Suppl 1):A8\n\nBackground\n\nDue to the lack of antagonists, recovery from anesthesia relies on drugs clearance. The difficulty of controlling such a delicate phase leads to increased risks for the patient, costs and prolonged recovery. Different than pharmacological antagonization, the inhibitor of dopamine and norepinephrine reuptake transporters methylphenidate has been shown to stimulate arousal pathways [1–3]. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the effect of methylphenidate on anesthesia recovery from propofol in experimental pigs.\n\nMaterials and methods\n\nFive healthy pigs, 10.4 ± 0.5-week-old (mean ± standard deviation), weighting 25.8 ± 1.8 kg, and of mixed sex (one female and four castrated males) were included in an experimental, randomized, cross-over study. Each pig was anesthetized three times, ensuring a wash-out period of at least 36 hours. Sole propofol was administered intravenously (IV) to effect until intubation. A continuous IV infusion was simultaneously started at 20 mg/kg/hour and increased every ten minutes by 6 mg/kg/hour, together with an additional IV bolus of 0.5 mg/kg. Once electroencephalographic suppression ratio (as calculated by the SedLine monitor) reached a value between 10% and 30%, propofol was stopped and either saline (group SL), methylphenidate 10 mg/kg (group MP10) or methylphenidate 20 mg/kg (group MP20) was administered IV. The following parameters were assessed at baseline, 5 (TP5), 10 (TP10) and 15 (TP15) minutes after methylphenidate administration: heart rate, respiratory rate, diastolic (DAP), mean (MAP) and systolic (SAP) blood pressure, nociceptive withdrawal reflex thresholds, patient state index (PSI), suppression ratio, and spectral edge frequency 95% right and left. Moreover, time to extubation, time to return of palpebral reflex and jaw tone, and time to return to a PSI of 50, 60, 70 and 80 were calcualted. Comparison among groups was performed using the two-way repeated measure ANOVA followed by the Bonferroni test in case of parametric data and the Kruskal-Wallis test followed by the Dunn's Method in case of non-parametric data.\n\nResults\n\nSignificantly higher MAP (p=0.042) was found at TP10, and significantly higher SAP (p=0.049) at TP15 in group MP10 compared to group SL. Significantly longer time was needed in group MP20 compared to group SL (p=0.015) to regain jaw tone, and in group SL compared to group MP10 (p=0.039) to reach a PSI of 80. No other significant differences were found.\n\nConclusions\n\nMethylphenidate does not shorten or improve anesthesia recovery in experimental pigs. Cardiovascular parameters seem to be only marginally affected.\n\nEthical approval (protocol 32015) was obtained from the committee for animal experiments, canton Bern.\n\nReferences\n\nChemali JJ, Van Dort CJ, Brown EN, Solt K.

Scalvenzi\n\nJournal of Anesthesia, Analgesia and Critical Care 2023, 3(Suppl 1):A9\n\nIntroduction\n\nLegionella Pneumophila is one of the most important causes of respiratory infections in humans and it is the cause of about 30% of nosocomial infections.\n\nAnastomotic leakage following the intervention of esophageal resection presents one of the surgical complications with the highest morbidity and mortality.\n\nCase reports\n\nFor the past year we have faced a case of anastomotic leakage post esophageal resection, treated through the application of an endoprosthesis esophageal in a patient affected by L. Pneumophila.\n\nThe main problem for the anesthetist during this procedure is identifying the most inadequate perioperative management.\n\nIn this specific case, the patient, affected by L. Pneumophila, presented a PO2/FiO2 ratio between 100mmHg and 200mmHg, giving rise to a moderate ARDS panel according to Berlin Criteria (Image 1).\n\nFor this reason, we decided to use a non-invasive periprocedural ventilation mode, specifically the High Flow Nasal Cannula (HFNC), to reduce the risk of postoperative pulmonary complications due to invasive ventilation through endotracheal intubation (ETI).\n\nThe parameters set during the entire procedure remained stable: Flow 60 L/min, FiO2 100%, Temperature 37 °C.\n\nThe patient, opportunely mixed with the current type of anesthesiological procedure and immediately after signing the Informed Consensus, is premedicated with intravenous Midazolam 0.05mg/Kg, while sedation is effected with an initial bolus of Propofol at 0.5mg/Kg. Successively, sedation is maintained whit Propofol in continuous infusion at 3.5mg/Kg/h.\n\nThe approximate duration of the procedure is 25 minutes. The patient's vital parameters are stable for all the duration of the intervention, with a SpO2 > 95%, and a MAP > 70 mmHg.\n\nAfter the procedure, the patient is returned to the Intensive Care unit where he has completed the course of antibiotic therapy, with a progressive reduction of the need for oxygen therapy.\n\nConclusion\n\nAirway management in patients with L. pneumophila can be a problem, aggravated by a series of additional risks related to ETI, such as pulmonary damage from mechanical ventilation, contamination of the ventilator, delayed weaning and an increase in hospital stay days. The use of HFNCs in endoscopic procedures allows to avoid these risks, eliminating the operating field conflict with the surgical procedure and guaranteeing a higher oxygen saturation compared to other oxygenation devices.\n\nImage 1 (abstract A9).\n\nA10 Mortality and thrombotic events in SARS-CoV-2 positive patients after urgent or emergency surgery\n\nG.

Sudano\n\nJournal of Anesthesia, Analgesia and Critical Care 2023, 3(Suppl 1):A10\n\nBackground\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic led to significant changes in the management of surgical patients. Elective surgery underwent a strong reshaping, whereas urgent and emergency procedures continued.\n\nThe aim of this retrospective study was to evaluate postoperative mortality rate and thrombotic events in SARS-CoV-2 positive patients undergoing urgent or emergency surgery.\n\nMaterials and Methods\n\nAfter local Ethic Committee’s approval, we reviewed all records of the SARS-CoV-2 positive patients who underwent urgent or emergency surgical procedures between April 2020 and October 2022 in the emergency department of IRCCS Fondazione Policlinico Universitario Agostino Gemelli of Rome.\n\nWe included patients who tested positive for both antigenic and molecular SARS-CoV-2 specimens in the time range that goes from 5 days before to 1 day after surgery.\n\nPostoperative mortality rate and the percentage of thrombotic events were evaluated. Mortality rate was specifically assessed on the first postoperative day, between the second and the fifth postoperative day and after 5 postoperative days.\n\nSurgical procedures are summarized in Table 1.\n\nResults\n\nFrom April 2020 to October 2022, 6387 patients underwent urgent or emergency surgery, 160 of which reported a positive SARS-CoV-2 test. Our patients’ mean (SD) age was 57 (23) years old.\n\nA total of 40 SARS-CoV-2 positive patients died after surgery so the overall mortality rate was 25%: 16 patients died on the first postoperative day (40%), 11 patients died between the second and fifth postoperative day (28%) and 13 patients died after the fifth postoperative day (13%). Dead patients’ mean (SD) age was 73 (15) years old.\n\nPostoperative thrombotic events occurred in 11 patients (7%).\n\nThe distribution of fatality and thrombotic events per year are reported in Figure 1 and Figure 2.\n\nConclusions\n\nDespite the lack of comparison our study provides evidence of what happened during the pandemic period in a high volume COVID-19 hospital.\n\nSARS-CoV-2 positive patients undergoing urgent or emergency surgical procedures during the pandemic had a high risk of mortality and of postoperative thrombotic events.\n\nEven though the highest distribution of SARS-CoV-2 positive patients occurred in 2022, the mortality rate per year resulted higher in 2020, probably due to a lower sensitivity and specificity of the tests used at the beginning of the pandemic and also to the lockdown condition that significantly reduced access to emergency departments.\n\nThe results of this study emphasize the importance of carefully evaluating risks and benefits of performing urgent or emergency surgery in SARS-CoV-2 positive patients and the need to implement strict postoperative monitoring to prevent the complications to which these patients are highly susceptible.\n\nTable 1 (abstract A10).\n\nPatients characteristicsN=160Age of SARS-CoV-2 positive patients57 (23)Age of dead patients73 (15) Surgical procedures Abdominal-pelvic surgery67 (42%) Orthopedic surgery25 (16%) Neurosurgery15 (9%) Otolaryngology-thoracic surgery13 (8%) Endoscopic procedures13 (8%) Vascular surgery9 (6%) Other procedures18 (11%)\n\nFig. 1 (abstract A10).\n\nFig. 2 (abstract A10).\n\nA11 Preliminary data on the efficacy and safety of intrathecal analgesia within a multimodal analgesia strategy for patients undergoing open liver surgery\n\nE.

Schirru\n\nJournal of Anesthesia, Analgesia and Critical Care 2023, 3(Suppl 1):A11\n\nBackground\n\nERAS guidelines recommend multimodal analgesia strategy for patient undergoing liver surgery and individuate intrathecal opiates as a viable alternative to thoracic epidural analgesia (TEA) with less associated hemodynamic instability [1].\n\nIntrathecal opiates administration reduces the need for systemic opiates that have more undesired side effects, including postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV), itching and respiratory depression. The use of atropine also seems to contribute to reduction of PONV [2].\n\nMaterials and Methods\n\nWe conducted an observational retrospective study, including patients over 18 years of age undergoing laparotomic liver surgery. Our objectives were: to compare intrathecal morphine (100-200 mcg) versus TEA and total intravenous analgesia in terms of pain intensity and need for rescue analgesics in the postoperative period; evaluate the incidence of side effects such as PONV, itching and respiratory depression in patients undergoing laparotomic liver surgery after administration of intrathecal morphine.\n\nData were collected at 0, 3, 6, 12, 24 and 48 hours after surgery. To assess the intensity of pain (static and dynamic) we used the NRS scale, dividing the patients into 4 groups with no (NRS 0), mild (NRS 1-3), moderate (NRS 4-5) and severe pain (NRS>5).\n\nResults\n\nData from 171 patients were analyzed. Eighty-seven patients received only intravenous analgesia, seventy intrathecal morphine and fourteen TEA.\n\nWe found no significant difference in static NRS between the three groups of patients; we recorded significant difference in dynamic NRS between intrathecal opioid group and total intravenous analgesia group, while we didn’t find significant difference in dynamic NRS between intrathecal opioid group and TEA group. There was no significant difference in incidence of side effects (e.g. PONV) between the three groups of patients.\n\nNo major complication followed intrathecal morphine administration.\n\nConclusions\n\nIntrathecal analgesia has shown to be effective in post-operative pain control in the first 24-48 hours after surgery. Dosages of 100-200 mcg of morphine seem to be safe and also it seems that using atropine as adjuvant could be useful to reduce side effects such as PONV.\n\nIn conclusion somministration of intrathecal opioid seems to be a valid alternative to TEA and a better analgesia strategy than total intravenous analgesia.\n\nData were collected from elettronic-database, patients expressed informed consent to data collection in University-hospital\n\nReferences\n\nJoliat et al.

Schirru\n\nJournal of Anesthesia, Analgesia and Critical Care 2023, 3(Suppl 1):A12\n\nBackground\n\nOpioid administration remains the mainstay of therapy for post-surgical pain; still these drugs have undesired side effects, including postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV), delayed recovery of bowel function, itching and respiratory depression. Multimodal analgesia is recommended by ERAS guidelines as a strategy to reduce side effects and obtain a better pain control [1]. Spinal analgesia has a high efficacy and relatively low complications [2]. The use of atropine as adjuvant could reduce PONV [3].\n\nMaterials and Methods\n\nWe conducted an observational retrospective study, including patients over 18 years of age undergoing major abdominal surgery who received intrathecal analgesia with morphine at a dose of 100-200 mcg. Analgesic effects were evaluated by means of the VAS score (NRS scale) for pain intensity and need for rescue analgesics. In addition, the incidence of PONV and respiratory depression were collected.\n\nData were registered at 0, 3, 6, 12, 24 and 48 hours after surgery. NRS scale was used to divide the patients into 4 groups with no (NRS 0), mild (1-3), moderate (4-5) and severe pain (>5).\n\nResults\n\nData from 700 patients were analyzed. Graphic 1 and 2 summarize the results on analgesia and Graphic 3 shows the incidence of PONV. No major complications were recorded and 26 patients (3.71%) experienced pruritus.\n\nConclusions\n\nIntrathecal morphine has shown to be effective in post-operative pain management during the first 48 hours after surgery. Dosages of morphine of 100-200 mcg seem to be safe in terms of respiratory depression.\n\nData were collected from elettronic-database, patients express informed consent to data collection in University-hospital.\n\nReferences\n\nTan M, Law LS, Gan TJ.

Pizzo 1, L. Saccarelli 2, E. Schirru 3, S. Giacalone 4, P. Serio 4, D. Colosimo 4, Z. Ricci 3,4\n\n1 Università di Siena, Siena, Italy; 2 Università di Perugia, Perugia, Italy; 3 Università di Firenze, Firenze, Italy; 4 AOU Meyer, Firenze, Italy\n\nCorrespondence: M.T. Pizzo, L. Saccarelli\n\nJournal of Anesthesia, Analgesia and Critical Care 2023, 3(Suppl 1):A13\n\nCurrent pediatric preoperative fasting guidelines have recommended conservative fasting regimes for many years without significant updates in the last decades. Recent publications have employed more liberal fasting regimes with no evidence of increased aspiration or regurgitation rates. The development of a liberal protocol with a strict application may warrant a shorter period of fasting before pediatric surgery. Essentially, we allowed clear fluid fasting within 1 hour, mother's milk within 3 hours, non-human milk and 'light breakfast' within 4 hours and last meal within 6 hours. The aim of this study was to evaluate the actual times of clear fluid fasting in children undergoing surgery in an institution where fasting was standardized according to the recent European guidelines. A retrospective analysis of fasting times according to local monitoring forms was conducted in a 6 months period. The local ethics committee approved the study. Overall 1000 patients were enrolled in the study. Median (interquartile) age was 7 (3-12) years. All surgeries except cardiac were included. The first 421 children were selected as initial protocol application (group START) in the first 2 months after protocol publication and providers training. START children data were compared to the remaining cases in order to verify if adherence to the protocol tended to improve (group APP). Clear fluid fasting was 180 min (110-342) in START group and 160 (96-320) in group APP (p=0.08) (figure 1).\n\nThe improvement was slightly more evident when patients scheduled after the first case (i.e., after 9.30 AM) were analyzed: in this case clear fluid fasting was 207 min (120-345) in START group and 180 (105-306) in group APP (p=0.028). There were 84 adverse events (i.e., hypotension/bradycardia at induction and difficulty to achieve venous access) related to preoperative fasting. At logistic regression these events showed a significant association with duration of clear fluids fasting (OR 0.12 95%CI 0.09-0.17; p=0.02) with a median fasting time in children with presence of adverse events of 377 (210-660) minutes vs 170 (100-351) in children without. Our study showed several important information: 1) in an institution were clear fluids fasting is allowed up to 60 minutes before surgery, median times do not tend to decrease below 2-3 hours. This is essentially due to unwillingness of patients and relatives to provide fluids and to the scarce explanation of the involved healthcare providers to consistently explain this aspect to the patients. 2) Interestingly, some tendency to improvement was observed between START and APP. Then, apparently, fasting times are not influenced by the time of scheduled surgery, even if the APP group seemed to improve with respect to START in the subgroup of 'later' cases. 3) Clear fluid fasting is indeed associated with adverse events related to fasting and this further underlines the importance of respecting protocol times. Further monitoring of fasting times will allow us to appraise if the slight trend to improvement in the APP population will achieve a significant value in the next months and if practices to endorse such improvement will need to be considered.\n\nFig. 1 (abstract A13).\n\nA14 Evaluation of intra-abdominal pressure during postoperative CPAP with helmet\n\nP.

Priani (paolo.priani@edu.unife.it)\n\nJournal of Anesthesia, Analgesia and Critical Care 2023, 3(Suppl 1):A14\n\nBackground\n\nPostoperative respiratory complications are a major cause of mobidity and mortality during the postoperative period. The PRISM trial investigated the effect of postoperative CPAP via helmet device on PPCs. Although the PRISM trial did not found any statistically significant difference in terms of PPCs [1], CPAP is still widely used in the treatment of respiratory failure during postoperative period. The effect of CPAP via helmet on intra-abdominal pressure still not well investigated.\n\nMaterials and Methods\n\nAfter obtaining informed consent, as a sub-study of the PRISM trial, we enrolled 22 patients that underwent major abdominal surgery and we started CPAP via helmet device according to the PRISM study protocol. We performed arterial BGA and measured intra-bladder pressure through urinary catheter as an indirect measure of intra-abdominal pressure [2]. The measures were obtained before starting CPAP (T0), after 30 minutes (T1) and 4 hours (T2) of CPAP.\n\nResults\n\nAll of the patients underwent CPAP via helmet for at least 4 hours. The median level of PEEP administered was 7.5 cmH2O [5-7.625]. At T0, 5 patients (22%) had an IAP equal or grater than 12 cmH2O (cutoff value for defining Intra-abdominal Hypertension [3]). At T1 and T2, 10 (45%) and 12 (55%) patients respectively met the criteria for IAH. 6 patients (27%) with normal IAP values at T0 developed grade 1 or 2 IAH at T1 and/or T2. The mean IAP was 8.57±3.82 at T0, 10.20±4.36 at T1 and 11.16±4.16 at T2. We found a statistically significant increase in the IAP between T0 and T2 (p=0.0012). We found a statistically significant increase in P/F ratio between T1 and T2 (p=0.023) but not between T0 and T1 (p=0.27). No statistically significant variations were found in creatinine levels before and after the CPAP (p=0.48).\n\nConclusions\n\nIAP was significantly higher after 4 hours of CPAP. In 6 cases, IAP increased from normal values to over 12 cmH2O during CPAP.\n\nReferences\n\nPRISM trial group.

Panizzi\n\nJournal of Anesthesia, Analgesia and Critical Care 2023, 3(Suppl 1):A15\n\nBackground\n\nPerioperative anxiety is one of the most impacting aspects on the patient's quality of life in the perioperative period. This pilot study, which started on February 7, 2019 and ended on January 29, 2020, has as primary objective to investigate the role of anxiety in the context of general anesthesia during elective abdominal surgery in adult patients, clarifying the correlation between the extent of anxiety state and the level of pain in the postoperative period.\n\nMaterials and Methods\n\nThis is a prospective, observational, single-centre study. Participants were adults patients undergoing videolaparoscopic cholecystectomy. Informed consent was obtained for each patient. Anxiety before surgery and 1 day postoperatively were measured using the APAIS (Amsterdam Preoperative Anxiety and Information Scale) questionnaire, while pain was investigated by using NRS (Numeric Rating Scale) and VAS (Visual Analogue Scale). Along with these, other clinical variables were recorded (Fig. 1).\n\nResults\n\n31 patients were included in the pilot study, 22 female and 9 male. Mean age was 57 years. An average score of 11.06 on the APAIS scale was observed in the postoperative period versus an average score of 13.38 in the preoperative period, highlighting how patients tended to have less anxiety in the postoperative phase than in the preoperative one. Correlating the APAIS questionnaire score with the postoperative pain by NRS scale and setting a value greater than/equal to 4 as a cut-off, 21 out of 31 patients (67.74%) had an NRS greater than or equal to 4, and of these 15 had an APAIS score greater than or equal to 14 (above the calculated mean); at the opposite, 10 out of 31 patients had an NRS less than or equal to 3, of these 8 had an APAIS score less than or equal to 13 (below the calculated mean).\n\nConclusions\n\nThe results of this study show that highly anxious patients tend to present more pain postoperatively, while moderately anxious patients present less pain postoperatively. It becomes therefore important to create perioperative programs that can not only manage pain in the postoperative phase with the existing pain services but also recognize, investigate, and treat the patient's anxious state preoperatively, in order to create more patient-centered pathways.\n\nIn addition, this pilot study may give the basis for further studies to understand the pathophysiological processes that correlate anxiety with pain, such as inflammatory status and/or other perioperative variables.\n\nFig. 1 (abstract A15).\n\nA16 Multimodal prevention strategy for high-risk postoperative nausea and vomiting: a case report\n\nV.

Rossi\n\nFondazione Policlinico Agostino Gemelli IRCCS - Università Cattolica del Sacro Cuore, Roma, Italia\n\nCorrespondence: V. Nussbaum\n\nJournal of Anesthesia, Analgesia and Critical Care 2023, 3(Suppl 1):A16\n\nBackground\n\nPostoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) is a condition that can occur in the immediate postoperative period up to 24 hours after surgery. PONV is usually a self-limited adverse event, treated without sequelae, but it could lead even to severe complication [1]. This condition is still underestimated but a comprehensive multimodal approach should be indicated facing high-risk patients.\n\nCase report\n\nA 42-years old woman scheduled for elective bilateral breast implant replacement, ASA score I, BMI 23.03, nonsmoker, reported previous episodes of severe PONV following general and neuraxial anesthesia and motion sickness. She was considered a risk 4 based on simplified Apfel score. She refused a loco regional anesthesia, so a multimodal strategy was proposed to reduce the risk of PONV.\n\nIn pre-anesthesia, premedication was given iv with ondansetron 4 mg and dexamethasone 4 mg while magnetic beads were positioned on the surface of both ears’ skin, in antiemetic points (Figure 1).\n\nIn the operating room, after multiparametric monitoring, general anesthesia was induced with propofol in Target Controlled Infusion (TCI) 3 mcg/ml and remifentanil TCI 2 ng/ml. Intraoperative maintenance was ensured by a bolus of fentanyl 100 mcg, remifentanil TCI (2-3 ng/ml), ketamine 0.8 mg/kg and midazolam 10 mg both in refracted doses. Towards the end of the surgery, acetaminophene 1g, ketorolac 30 mg, and metoclopramide 10 mg were administered. In the emerging phase, remifentanil was discontinued and propofol was reduced to 1 mcg/ml until the patient resumed spontaneous breathing. The patient was successfully extubated and propofol infusion terminated.\n\nThe patient stayed under observation for about 45 minutes in the Recovery Room. She wasn’t agitated and denied PONV.\n\nDuring the 24 hours after surgery, the patient didn't experienced either nausea or vomiting or pain and was in complete well-being for the discharge.\n\nConclusion\n\nPreventing PONV in high-risk patients should require a multimodal strategy to reach a safe postoperative recovery. In our case we provide a multimodal strategy based on three cornerstones. Total intravenous anesthesia technique with opioid sparing approach is nowadays considered the gold standard technique [2]. The use of pharmacological prevention and homeostasis maintenance during surgery has been proved as effective in reducing emetic stimulus [3]. We add in this case a non-pharmacological approach using acupuncture technique, useful for PONV managing [4]. In view of this multimodal strategy, we hope that in the future acupuncture approach will be more used as well as the pharmacological approach.\n\nInformed consent to publish had been obtained.\n\nReferences\n\nSbaraglia F, Saviani M, Timpano JM, Rossi M.

Tosi, R. Festa, F. Sbaraglia, A. Pusateri, M. Spanò, F. Antonicelli, M. Rossi\n\nFondazione Policlinico Agostino Gemelli IRCCS - Università Cattolica del Sacro Cuore, Roma, Italy\n\nCorrespondence: C. Malatesta\n\nJournal of Anesthesia, Analgesia and Critical Care 2023, 3(Suppl 1):A17\n\nBackground\n\nThe Newborn Infant Parasympathetic Evaluation (NIPE) is a Heart rate variability-based technology, developed in 2015, for assessing pain and comfort in neonates under 2-years-old, including premature infants. It is an adaptation of the Analgesia Nociception Index (ANI), developed for monitoring adults and children > 2 years, during surgery under GA. NIPE estimates HR, HF oscillations (> 0.15 Hz), reflecting parasympathetic activity. The monitor displays 2 values, ranging from 0 to 100: the instant-NIPE (NIPEi) and the mean-NIPE (NIPEm). A decrease in NIPE score is interpreted as indicating an increased stress level, whereas an increase in NIPE score indicates improved comfort. According to the manufacturer, NIPE value <50 is indicative of either discomfort, stress, or pain.\n\nLittle is known about the performance of the NIPE in anesthetized neonates and infants.\n\nThe aim of this study was to investigate the effectiveness of NIPE in predicting painful stimuli, in newborns undergoing GA, and the impact on the need of postoperative analgesia.\n\nMethods\n\nIn this single center, prospective, observational pilot study, 28 infants, aged <15 months and weighting <10Kg were recruited for correction of craniosynostosis. Patients were compared in two groups: the NIPE group received Fentanyl (1-2 mcg/Kg) according to the NIPE value (NIPE score< 50); the Control group received Fentanyl (1-2 mcg/Kg) relying on changes in heart rate and blood pressures, together with other clinical signs such as sweating or movements. The primary endpoint was to investigate the ability of the NIPE and heart rate to detect an insufficient antinociception. The secondary endpoint was the correlation between NIPE values and heart rate and the amount of postoperative analgesia.\n\nResults\n\nFor statistical analysis Student’s T test was used for unpaired data. A p=0.05was considered statistically significant. A reduction in the use of fentanyl in the NIPE group is evident, with a mean of 12 mcg versus the 22mcg of the control group (Figure 1).\n\nA wide inter-variability was found in the control group. The Pearson’s chi-square test was used for the secondary objectives. NIPE group showed a tendency to match heart rate values and NIPE value reduction at various times of surgery with no significant statistically difference.\n\nConclusion\n\nThis study provisionally suggests the ability of the NIPE to detect insufficient antinociception and is valuable in reducing the amount of opioids really needed by the infant.\n\nReferences\n\nUpton HD, Ludbrook GL. “Intraoperative “Analgesia Nociception Index” guided fentanyl administration during sevoflurane anesthesia in lumbar discectomy and laminectomy: a randomized clinical trial.” Anesth Analg 2017; 125: 81-90.\n\nSzental JA, Webb A. “Postoperative pain after laparoscopic cholecystectomy is not reduced by intraoperative analgesia guided by analgesia nociception index (ANI®) monitoring: a randomized clinical trial.” Br J Anaesth 2015; 114: 640-5.\n\nGruenewald M, Herz J. “Measurement of the nociceptive balance by Analgesia Nociception Index and Surgical Pleth Index during sevoflurane-remifentanil anesthesia.” Minerva Anesth 2015; 81: 480-9.\n\nFig. 1 (abstract A17).\n\nA18 Perioperative cardiocirculatory arrest in a young woman with undiagnosed OSAS: a case report\n\nS.

Pilloni\n\nJournal of Anesthesia, Analgesia and Critical Care 2023, 3(Suppl 1):A18\n\nBackground. Obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS) is a frequent pathology: it is estimated that 25% of all patients admitted for elective surgery suffer from OSAS and that more than 80% of them are unaware of it. OSAS is known to be responsible of serious postoperative complications, especially respiratory and cardiovascular, including deaths that are often referred generically to cardiac arrest.1 Guidelines propose decision-making flow charts to manage the most critical aspects of the perioperative path, guiding the screening and identification of patients with suspected OSAS and guiding the planning of pre-, intra- and post-operative care levels.2\n\nCase report. A 35-year-old female with grade I obesity (BMI 35.5) and no other comorbidities underwent videolaparoscopic cholecystectomy. The medical history did not report neither snoring nor daytime sleepiness, and the STOP-Bang questionnaire showed a mild risk for OSAS (score 3).\n\nAccording to the SIAARTI 2019 OSA screening score, she was classified among patients with a mild risk of OSA (score 1), with a BMI > 35 but with gynoid-type obesity, a neck circumference of 37 cm, and a negative SpO2 test (SPO2 >90% in sitting and supine positions). Moreover, the risk associated with the surgical and anesthetic procedures was moderate (interventional procedure under general anesthesia, score 2). Considering these factors, the risk to be attributed to the patient was to be considered not increased (score 3). After the surgical procedure, the patient was discharged to the ward with SpO2 monitoring, and about 10 minutes after discharge she undergoes cardiocirculatory arrest caused by respiratory arrest. ROSC was obtained rapidly and recovery of consciousness as well, without neurological deficits. On the first postoperative day, episodes of arterial desaturation during sleep were observed, and, in the suspicion of OSAS, pneumologist indicated a polysomnography that confirmed a severe OSAS.\n\nConclusions. STOP-Bang questionnaire is a good screening tool, but it does not identify all undiagnosed cases of OSAS. Therefore, even in patients at not-increased/low risk for OSAS, the measurement of SpO2 is useful during the post-operative time especially if the risk associated with the surgical and anesthetic procedures is moderate/high. In these situations, the increased levels of analgesia/sedation can have a negative impact on predisposed patients.\n\nInformed consent to publish had been obtained.\n\nReferences\n\nFouladpour N et al.

Gobbi\n\nJournal of Anesthesia, Analgesia and Critical Care 2023, 3(Suppl 1):A19\n\nBACKGROUND\n\nIn morbid obesity, central fat accumulation pushes a significant load on the respiratory system, with decreased of lung volumes, lung/chest wall compliance and increased airways resistance.; all contributing to higher breathing work and shorter safe apnea time.\n\nObstructive Sleep Apnea [1] affects 2/3 of morbidly obese individuals undergoing bariatric surgery. Perioperative continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) is advised for moderate/severe OSA to avoid respiratory failure.\n\nObesity Hypoventilation Syndrome [2] is a respiratory consequence of morbid obesity characterized by alveolar hypoventilation during sleep and wakefulness. It involves an interaction between impaired respiratory mechanics, ventilatory drive and sleep-disordered breathing.\n\nAIM\n\nIn our Hospital we currently submit the STOP-BANG questionnaire [3] to all candidates for bariatric surgery, to identify moderate/high risk for OSA in order to direct them to specialistic evaluation and start CPAP treatment. Patients with the clinical features of OHS undergo blood gas analysis: if hypoxemia and hypercapnia (>45mmHg) are present, then CPAP treatment should be considered (Figure 1).\n\nMETHODS\n\nRetrospective observational study (Jan. 2021 - Dec. 2022). 156 adult patients enrolled (M 33, F 123), undergoing laparoscopic bariatric surgery. Mean BMI for women: 40.96 (min 31,56; max 54,11), for men: 41.86 (min 32,53; max 53,07). Of these subjects, 70 (45%) had or received a diagnosis of OSA/OHS, and perioperatively used CPAP (Table 1).\n\nRESULTS\n\nNo patient receiving perioperative CPAP and undergoing LBS (sleeve gastrectomy) had respiratory complications nor showed respiratory issues during the induction of general anesthesia, and none of them was admitted to ICU for postoperative care due to respiratory insufficiency.\n\nCONCLUSIONS\n\nBased on our experience, we can argue that an adequate perioperative ventilation strategy is useful in patients with OHS/OSA candidates for bariatric surgery [4], also for ERAS (Enhanced Recovery After Surgery) protocol applicability [5]. We should preoperatively investigate these pathologies in order to direct patients to the appropriate treatment to minimize the risk of respiratory failure.\n\nInformed consent for the publication of these clinical data has been obtained from the participants.\n\nFig. 1 (abstract A19).\n\nTable 1 (abstract A19).\n\nA20 Perioperative intravenous (I.V.) lidocaine in Laparoscopic Bariatric Surgery (LBS) Improves quality of recovery: an observational retrospective study\n\nC.

Gobbi\n\nJournal of Anesthesia, Analgesia and Critical Care 2023, 3(Suppl 1):A20\n\nBACKGROUND\n\nAs known in the literature, opioids, due to their breath-depressing effect, can be dangerous for obese patients, who often suffer from disorders such as obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) and hypoventilation syndrome (OHS) [1,2,3].\n\nAt recommended doses [4,5], perioperative i.v. lidocaine is considered safe and effective in ensuring adequate pain control in patients undergoing laparoscopic bariatric surgery (LBS), without the aid of opioids [5,6].\n\nAIM\n\nThe present observational retrospective study aims to address the feasibility of opioid free anesthesia OFA with i.v. lidocaine, evaluating its safety and effectiveness in LBS.\n\nMETHODS\n\nClinical data of all patients undergoing LBS at L. Galmarini Hospital (Tradate, Italy) between Jan 2021 and Dec 2022 were retrospectively collected. We entrolled 156 adult patients (M 33, F 123). Mean BMI for women: 40.96 (min 31,56; max 54,11), for men: 41.86 (min 32,53; max 53,07).\n\nWe tested a protocol of opioid free anesthesia OFA using i.v. lidocaine (Figure 1).\n\nAll patients were evaluated in terms of postoperative pain control according to the Numerical Rating Scale (NRS). Adequate control of postoperative pain was considered reached with NRS lower equal to 4 (24/48 hours).\n\nRESULTS\n\nThe protocol used ensured adequate anesthesia and pain control.\n\nOf all patients, 3% did not require post-operative analgesia, 21% required i.v. paracetamol only on the first day at a dose of 1 g every 8 hours, the remaining percentage (76%) required i.v. paracetamol 1g every 8 hours and from 1 to 3 doses of i.v. ketorolac, exclusively during the first day (Graphic 1).\n\nNo adverse effects related to i.v. lidocaine were noted during the perioperative time.\n\nCONCLUSIONS\n\nBased on our experience and supported by the literature, we can state that the use of i.v. lidocaine in LBS seems to be safe and effective in reducing consumption of opioids, improving quality of recovery [5].\n\nThe results obtained (considering the advantages of an opioid free anesthesia OFA, the easy and safe applicability of the protocol, and the reduced adverse effects associated with the use of i.v. lidocaine) encourage further studies.\n\nThe opioid sparing effect of systemic i.v. lidocaine could be a significant criterion to better investigate its efficacy for the applicability of ERAS (Enhanced Recovery After Surgery) protocols [7].\n\nInformed consent for the publication of these clinical data has been obtained from the participants.\n\nFig. 1 (abstract A20).\n\nGraphic 1 (abstract A20).\n\nA21 Postoperative severe acute pancreatitis after propofol anesthesia: a case report\n\nT.A.

Other drugs administered are reported in table 1. The patient remained normothermic and hemodynamically stable, even though due to blood loss > 1 l and anemization he was transfused.\n\nAt awakening the patient was extubated and transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU) for postoperative monitoring with optimal haemodynamic, neurological and antalgic control.\n\nA few hours after the admission in ICU he reported a blunt abdominal pain, mainly on the right side, nausea and the exams showed increased amylase levels, urologists excluded any surgical involvement of pancreatic tissue and suspected a transient sphincter of Oddi dysfunction [3]. After one night in ICU he was transferred to the urology ward due to his clinical stability, even though Amylase peaked at 2340 U/l. Two days later abdominal pain increased to severe, with characteristics of peritonism and increased inflammatory markers. An abdomen-thorax CT scan revealed acute pancreatitis (AP) (Figure 1) and he was transferred to ICU. He started a standard treatment for acute pancreatitis and antibiotic therapy [4].\n\nOn postoperative day nine, due to general deterioration of clinical conditions and further anemization that required blood transfusion, he underwent an emergency laparotomy, in which propofol was not used as an anesthetic drug, that found a completely necrotic pancreas. The following day he faced a multi organ failure (MOF) which rapidly led to death. Consent to publish the case report was accorded by the family.\n\nAcute pancreatitis (AP) Is a complex and severe disease with a high mortality rate [4]. Propofol, is a common anesthetic drug which is widely used in daily practice for sedations and general anesthesia [5], few cases of Propofol Induced AP have been published, in which the diagnosis has been made excluding more common causes [6].\n\nIn fact, Propofol is listed as a possible cause of AP, class Ib, based on the classification of Badalov et al. [7]. Following the scheme proposed by the systematic review by Haffar et al for Propofol induced AP [6] we could confirm that our hypothesis is plausible. He satisfied the American College of Gastroenterology criteria for AP [8,9] and it is classified as severe acute pancreatitis according to the Revised Atlanta Classification with peripancreatic necrotic fluid collection [10]. Marshall score [11] after admission was two and Naranjo et al [12] probability scale for drug adverse reaction was three, meaning that the adverse reaction is possible. Latence according to Badalov et al [7] has been short or intermediate. Exclusion of other plausible causes, timing of pancreatitis symptoms and previous cases in literature support our hypothesis of propofol induced pancreatitis.\n\nInformed consent to publish had been obtained.\n\nTable 1 (abstract A21).\n\nSexMaleAge (years)75Height (cm)176Weight (kg)82BMI26.47AllergiesNoneSmoking habit20 cigarettes/day for 60 yearsAlcohol consumption2 to 3 doses daily, strongly reduced in preoperative period (6 months)PathologiesArterial Hypertension, Dyslipidemia, COPD Gold 1, Low back pain, minimal mitral and tricuspidal rigurgitation, carotid stenosis (50% R, 30% L), mixed anxiety- depressive disorder, irritable bowel syndrome,bladder Cancer stadium T1N0M0 HgPrevious operations:Videolaparoscopic Cholecistectomy, appendicectomy, Epigastric Hernia Repair, endovascular prosthesis for subclavian steal syndrome, in situ melanoma exeresis,Home therapyClopidogrel, Perindopril , Indapamide, Symvastatin, venlafaxine and pantoprazolAPACHE II score10 at first ICU admission16 at second ICU admission23 after esplorative laparotomySAPS II score22 at first ICU admission30 at second ICU admission75 after esplorative laparotomyCharlson Comorbility Index6Propofol infusion time (hours)~ 7Propofol total infused dose (mg)~ 3300Drugs administered intraoperativelyPropofol, Remifentanil, Ketamine, Rocuronium, Midazolam, Cefazolin Dexamethasone, Pantoprazole, Ketorolac, Paracetamol, Sugammadex, MgSO4, Ropivacaine\n\nFig. 1 (abstract A21).\n\nA22 SpO2 reduction, methemoglobinemia and generalized bluish skin discoloration following intradermal administration of patent blue v in breast reconstruction with diep flap: a case report\n\nG.

Gazzè\n\nJournal of Anesthesia, Analgesia and Critical Care 2023, 3(Suppl 1):A22\n\nBackground\n\nPatent Blue V (PBV) is used in plastic surgery for sentinel lymph node identification in breast cancers and cutaneous melanomas. Other less allergenic molecules are often preferred over this dye. Currently, propelled by the widespread adoption of lymphatic reconstruction techniques, the use of PBV is strongly re-emerging in clinical practice.\n\nCase report\n\nThe patient of our clinical case report is a 60-year-old woman (ASA 2, no history of allergies) admitted to the plastic surgery unit of the IRCCS -Regina Elena National Cancer Institute, Rome, undergoing removal of the left breast prosthesis, debridement of homolateral axillary scar tissue and total breast reconstruction with bipedicled deep inferior epigastric perforator (DIEP) and lymph node flaps. During the procedure, approximately 30 minutes after the intradermal injection of 2 ml of 2.5% PBV sodium salt (50 mg) in the right lower limb, the patient experienced a slight reduction in SpO2 (from 100% to 96%), unresponsive to increased inspiratory fraction of oxygen, and methemoglobinemia was detected in blood gas analysis (maximum value 4.5%), which did not require any treatment. Additionally, a generalized bluish skin discoloration and bluish-greenish urine were observed. No significant hemodynamic, respiratory or hemogasanalytic changes were observed during the procedure; therefore, the decision was made to continue with the surgical intervention. At the end of surgery, the patient was transferred conscious, alert, and cooperative to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) for postoperative monitoring. The postoperative course in ICU was uneventful and the patient was transferred to the plastic surgery department the following day.\n\nConclusions\n\nThe frequency of allergic reactions to PBV has been estimated to be between 0.2% and 2.7% [1]. Preoperative antiallergic prophylaxis does not prevent anaphylactic reactions but it may reduce their severity.\n\nWhen administering blue dyes, including PVB, the SpO2 value measured by pulse-oximetry may falsely decrease; therefore, in such cases, serial arterial blood gas analysis is recommended to assess any respiratory exchange abnormalities [2]. Blood gas tests may show falsely elevated methemoglobin values when measured by spectrophotometry [3]. False SpO2 values and methemoglobinemia appear to manifest only when their evaluation is performed in the presence of moderate-to-high blood concentrations of blue dyes using the photometric method. Finally, it is worth noting that in a limited number of cases described in the literature, after the administration of Patent Blue V, the appearance of methaemoglobinemia has occurred, which sometimes has also required treatment.\n\nInformed consent to publish had been obtained.\n\nReferences\n\nYusim Y, Livingstone D, Sidi A.

Sixty children of ASA I-II aged 2-10 years who were scheduled for adenotonsillectomy were included in the study. Patients were randomly assigned to either low-flow anesthesia or high-flow anesthesia. Heart rate, mean arterial pressure, peripheral oxygen saturation, inspiratory oxygen concentration, end-tidal carbon dioxide, and Bispectral index values of the patients were recorded in the operating room. Spontaneous breathing effort and extubation time were recorded while emergence from anesthesia. Heart rate, mean arterial pressure, peripheral oxygen saturation, pain, and agitation scores were also recorded in the recovery room. The day after surgery, the parents were called to investigate whether the unwanted effects occurred.\n\nResults\n\nHemodynamic variables were not different between the groups at all times (p> 0.05). There was no difference between the groups in bispectral index values (p> 0.05). Spontaneous respiration time and extubation time were not different between the groups (p> 0.05). Pain and agitation scores were lower in the low flow group (p <0.05). No side effects were observed in any of the groups. Mean arterial pressure and heart rate were similar between groups in our study. However, both of them were decreased during the operation, although they did not drop lower than normal limits. These decreases might have been due to the effect of sevoflurane on cardiorespiratory reflexes, which seemed to be clinically unimportant. Adverse reactions were not detected in any patient in our study indicating that low flow anesthesia does not increase adverse reactions in low flow sevoflurane anesthesia in children.\n\nThis study has some limitations. One limitation is the number of participants. Although the numbers are enough to compare groups statistically it would be better if the number of participants had been higher. As we performed routinely in our clinic, we assumed that intravenous paracetamol would be enough for the early postoperative period during which we measured severity of pain which may be another limitation of the study. It could be better if we had planned to give rescue analgesia.\n\nConclusion\n\nLow flow anesthesia may reduce emergence delirium and postoperative pain even in short-term operations like adenotonsillectomy with no increase in the incidence of adverse events, and with no change in hemodynamic and respiratory parameters in pediatric patients.\n\nA24 Face mask in the presence of the parents may improve acceptance during inhalation induction induction in pediatric anesthesia\n\nC.

The present study investigated whether the use of a mask in the presence of the parents improved mask acceptance before the slow induction of anesthesia in pediatric patients.\n\nMethods\n\nThe study was performed after obtaining informed consent.\n\nThis prospective, randomized controlled trial enrolled patients aged 2–10 years who were scheduled to undergo surgery under general anesthesia. Patients were randomly assigned to mask induction with Air/O2/Sevoflurane without the presence of parents (control group) or in the presence of parents (experimental group). The primary outcome was the mask acceptance score, rated on a validated 4-point from 1 point (not afraid; easily accepts the mask) to 4 points (afraid of a mask; crying or struggling). The secondary outcome was heart rate assessed by pulse oximetry in the pediatric ward before transfer to the operating room (OR), at the entrance to the OR, at the patient notification of mask fitting by the anesthesiologist, and after mask fitting.\n\nResults\n\nSeventy-seven patients were accessed for eligibility, with 67 enrolled in the study: 33 in the experimental group and 34 in the control group. Mask acceptance was significantly greater among patients aged 2–3 years in the experimental than in the control group (p < 0.05) (Figure 1).\n\nThe mask acceptance score was significantly lower in the experimental than in the control group in patient group 1 (p<0.05)\n\nConclusions\n\nThe use of a mask in the presence of parents can improve acceptance before anesthesia induction with a parental presence in pediatric patients aged 2–3 years.\n\nFig. 1 (abstract A24).\n\nA25 Implementation of a Multimodal Prehabilitation program for patients undergoing major upper gastrointestinal surgery: the preliminary experience of the University of Florence Prehabilitation Center\n\nF.

Firenzuoli\n\nJournal of Anesthesia, Analgesia and Critical Care 2023, 3(Suppl 1):A25\n\nBackground\n\nMultimodal Prehabilitation (MP) before major upper gastrointestinal surgery has shown to improve preoperative functional capacity (FC) and facilitate surgical recovery [1]. Neoadjuvant therapy (NAT), frequently indicated for these patients, is associated with loss of lean body mass (LBM) and deterioration of FC [2]. This cohort study aims at describing the preliminary experience of the University of Florence MP program recently implemented as standard of care for these patients.\n\nMaterial and Methods\n\nFrom May 2022 to May 2023, high-risk patients were referred to the University of Florence MPC, in preparation for their surgery. The six-Minute Walking Test, the Fried physical frailty criteria, Patient-Generated Subjective Global Assessment (PG-SGA), bioimpedentiometry, and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale were used to assess physical, nutritional, and psychological status. A personalized MP program was then prescribed for at least 4 weeks, and patients revaluated before and 30 and 90 days after surgery. MP consisted of medical, functional, nutritional, and psychological optimization, including correction of preoperative anemia, optimization of geriatric conditions, and a smoking cessation interventions.\n\nResults\n\nSixty-two patients were referred to the MPC. Of these, 24 received the intended surgical intervention. Eighteen patients (75%) received NAT (chemotherapy n=14, chemo-radiation n=4) (Table 1).\n\nMP characteristics and interventions are reported in (Table 2).\n\nOverall, there was a clinically meaningful improvement [3] of preoperative FC (six-minutes waking distance, 6MWD), more pronounced in patients who received NAT (Figure 1).\n\nSimilarly, preoperative LBM increased; this improvement was mainly driven by an increment of LBM in patients treated with NAT (Figure 1). Compared to baseline, FC decreased after surgery, but return above baseline 90 days after surgery. In contrast, there was a postoperative loss of LBM up to 90 days after surgery. The proportion of sarcopenic, frailty and malnourished patients after MP decreased (baseline vs preoperative: 29% vs 17%, 21% vs 8%, 92% vs 33%, respectively). However, the proportion of anemic patients increased (Figure 2).\n\nConclusions\n\nMP improved preoperative FC and LBM in oncologic patients undergoing major upper gastrointestinal surgery. FC was maintained throughout the perioperative period, despite the loss of LBM that persisted up to 90 days after surgery. Moreover, in patients treated with NAT, MP prevented the loss of function and LBM commonly observed after NAT. Finally, MP modified several preoperative risk factors associated with postoperative morbidity, mortality and poor functional recovery.\n\nReferences\n\nMinnella EM, Awasthi R, Loiselle SE, Agnihotram RV, Ferri LE, Carli F.

Del Santo\n\nJournal of Anesthesia, Analgesia and Critical Care 2023, 3(Suppl 1):A26\n\nBackground\n\nRapid sequence induction (RSI) is an anesthesia technique for tracheal intubation in patients at high risk of aspiration of gastric content. As manual ventilation is not recommended in RSI, pre-oxygenation is a fundamental strategy to ensure an adequate period of safe apnea [1]. The current standard for pre-oxygenation entails spontaneous facemask ventilation (FM) delivering a fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 100% at 15 L/min flow such as to reach an end tidal O2 (EtO2) of at least 90% prior to the administration of induction medications and myorelaxants. The use of High Flow Nasal Oxygen (HFNO) may offer some advantages over the standard technique [2].\n\nPatients and methods\n\nAfter obtaining informed consent, patients undergoing anesthesia with indication for RSI were randomized for FM or HFNO. Patients belonging to the FM-group were pre-oxygenated with an anesthesia mask for 5 minutes (15 L/min, FiO2 of 1). After the anesthesia induction, the mask was left in place during the apnea time and removed during the intubation. Patients of the HFNO-group were pre-oxygenated for 5 minutes with HFNO at 40 L/min and FiO2 1. Oxygen flow was increased to 70 l/min after the anesthesia induction and the cannula was left in place during the apnea time and the intubation (figure 1).\n\nPaO2, PaCO2, SpO2 and oxygen reserve index (ORi) were measured before, at 5 minutes of pre-oxygenation and immediately after intubation. Apnea time was measured in each patient. The variables considered were compared. For each patient, the variation of PaO2 and PaCO2 during apnea was related to the apnea time to obtain and compare the mean variation per second during apnea of these variables.\n\nResults\n\nWe enrolled 50 patients and randomized 25 for each group. There was no difference in the baseline patient characteristics and basal SpO2, PaO2 and PaCO2. Patients in the HFNO group showed a lower decrease in PaO2 during the apnea time (p=0.0009). In a sub-population with apnea time greater than 300 seconds, PaO2 at intubation was significantly higher in the HFNO group (p=0.046) than in FM-group. Differently, there were no differences between the two groups in PaCO2 (table 1-2).\n\nConclusions\n\nHFNO might increase the safe apnea compared to the standard method for the pre-oxygenation of patients undergoing RSI offering additional safety especially when the intubation procedure needs more time. In addition, ORi can be a useful non-invasive monitoring of the patient oxygen status during RSI. There was no evidence in CO2 clearance under HFNO.\n\nReferences\n\nEl-Orbany M, Connolly LA.

This is detected at the splanchnic level in children undergoing corrective surgery for craniostenosis.\n\nThe main purpose of this study is to identify timely transfusion indications. 2\n\nThe study also aims to evaluate any correlations between sSO2 and metabolic acidosis markers such as lactate and base excess.\n\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\n\nThis no profit observational study involves the Catholic University of the Sacred Heart as the sole participating center.\n\nAn INVOS oximeter ( Somanetics, Troy, USA) was used for the study.\n\nThis instrument emits light at two wavelengths (730 and 810 nm) in order to measure the concentration of oxygenated and deoxygenated hemoglobin in the microcirculation.\n\nThe study examines nineteen patients ages less than 15 months, weighing less than 10 kg, undergoing cranioplasty procedures for the correction of primary craniostenosis. All these patients had a postoperative course in the Pediatric Intensive Care Unit (PICU). Patients with known comorbidities and/or suffering from syndromic craniosynostosis (Crouzon syndrome, Pfeiffer syndrome or Apert syndrome) were excluded from the study.\n\nAll patients included in the study underwent the same anesthetic protocol. Plasma expanders were used to replace the lost blood volume. Albumin 5 % was administered in boluses at the initial dose of 20 ml/kg, which could be adjusted according to blood loss.\n\nConversely, concentrated red blood cells were administered when signs and symptoms of hypoperfusion were observed, considering a hemoglobin cutoff value of 7 g/dL.\n\nAt the end of the surgery, the patients were transferred to the Pediatric Intensive Care Unit (PICU), for postoperative monitoring and management of the surgical case.\n\nRESULTS\n\nData were analyzed using the median and quartiles as the distribution was non-normal (non-Gaussian). From the data analysis, a linear regression was performed between the absolute value (a.v.) values of regional oxygen saturation (rSO2) and hemoglobin (Hb), revealing a significant but weak linear relationship (p=0.001, r2=0.15). On the other hand, the correlation between rSO2 and lactate levels and base excess (BE) values was not statistically significant (p value = 0.97).\n\nCONCLUSIONS\n\nNIRS has proven to be a non-invasive method that could provide valid data for the correct management of perioperative anesthesia. In the pediatric field we could have great benefits in terms of blood saving strategies.\n\nREFERENCES\n\nJobsis FF.

Barbani 1, F. Livi 1, T. Piazzini 3, S. Romagnoli 1, G. Baldini 1\n\n1 School of Anaesthesia and Critical Care, University of Florence, Azienda Ospedaliero-Universitaria Careggi, Florence, Italy; 2 University of Florence, Florence, Italy; 3 Biomedical Library, University of Florence, Florence, Italy\n\nCorrespondence: G. Cocci\n\nJournal of Anesthesia, Analgesia and Critical Care 2023, 3(Suppl 1):A28\n\nBackground: Prehabilitation (PreHab) refers to individualized preoperative interventions aiming at improving preoperative functional capacity and optimize modifiable risk factors to better overcome surgical stress and better recover to daily activities1. Measuring adherence to a medical intervention is essential for accurately determining its efficacy. It is unclear how adherence to PreHab is currently measured and reported. The aim of this systematic review is to determine how PreHab adherence is measured and reported, and if possible, determine whether high adherence rates are associated with better outcomes.\n\nMaterials and methods: PRISMA guidelines for systematic reviews were followed. Medline, Embase, Cochrane Library databases were searched for Randomized Controlled Trial, Clinical Trial, and retrospective studies, from January 1999 to March 2023, and that evaluated PreHab interventions in adult patients awaiting for major or moderate elective surgery. As there is no standardized and unambiguous definition of PreHab, it was decided to search and include trials evaluating any unimodal preoperative intervention including physical exercise, nutritional, and cognitive/psychological support, or multimodal interventions combining at least 2 of the forementioned treatments. Only preoperative treatments that started at least 7 days before surgery were included. Studies aiming at optimizing individual surgical risk factors, such as smoking cessation or anemia were excluded. Included studies were analyzed to investigate 1) how adherence to PreHab interventions was reported and defined 2) the association between adherence to PreHab and preoperative and postoperative outcomes.\n\nResults: Of the 21.313 studies identified from Medline, 246 studies were included for the analysis. PreHab was unimodal in 210 studies (exercise-based PreHab n=127, nutrition-based PreHab n=47, and psychological PreHab n= 36) and multimodal in 36 studies (Table 1).\n\nDifferent type of prehabilitation interventions were identified (Figure 1).\n\nOverall, adherence to PreHab was reported in 125 of the studies included (50.8%). Of these, 103 (82.4%) defined it. Multimodal PreHab studies that reported adherence to each component of the multimodal intervention prescribed were only 8 (40%); when not entirely reported, adherence to the exercise intervention was the most reported. Parameters used to define adherence were frequency (n=92), intensity/dose (n=1) or duration (n=2) relatively to the PreHab prescription. Sixteen trials used more than 1 of these parameters to define adherence to PreHab (Figure 2).\n\nDue to the high degree of heterogeneity in defining and reporting PreHab adherence it was not possible to assess and establish whether high rates of Prehab adherence are associated with better outcomes.\n\nConclusions: these preliminary results show that PreHab adherence was not reported in half of the study identified. It was mainly reported describing the frequency of the intervention, relatively to PreHab parameters prescribed. Due to a high degree of heterogeneity defining and reporting PreHab adherence, it was not possible to establish its association with postoperative outcomes. Future studies should better define and report adherence to PreHab, not only describing how frequent the intervention occurred, but also a"
