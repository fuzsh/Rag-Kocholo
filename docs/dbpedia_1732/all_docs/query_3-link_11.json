        "text": "What is neurosyphilis?\n\nNeurosyphilis is a potentially life-threatening complication of syphilis, a sexually transmitted infection (STI). Neurosyphilis happens when the Treponema pallidum bacterium (the bacterium that causes syphilis) invades your brain and/or spinal cord. Not everyone who has syphilis develops symptoms of this complication.\n\nNeurosyphilis and syphilis are distinct — but related — conditions. Neurosyphilis affects your central nervous system (CNS) and causes neurological symptoms. Syphilis is an STI with different signs and symptoms.\n\nUntreated neurosyphilis can result in serious medical complications, including permanent paralysis, dementia and death. Seeking treatment as soon as syphilis or neurosyphilis symptoms appear is essential.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCleveland Clinic is a non-profit academic medical center. Advertising on our site helps support our mission. We do not endorse non-Cleveland Clinic products or services. Policy\n\nWhat are the forms of neurosyphilis?\n\nThere are five forms of neurosyphilis. Researchers break them up into two groups: early neurosyphilis and late neurosyphilis.\n\nEarly neurosyphilis\n\nEarly forms of neurosyphilis include:\n\nAsymptomatic neurosyphilis (ANS): This form doesn’t cause any neurological symptoms. It occurs before you develop symptoms of syphilis, too. Healthcare providers diagnose this form when a cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis finds evidence of syphilis but you don’t have symptoms. If you have syphilis and don’t receive treatment, ANS generally occurs between the first few weeks to the first few years of getting the infection.\n\nMeningeal neurosyphilis: This form happens when the syphilis bacteria cause inflammation of your meninges — the three layers of tissue that protect your brain and spinal cord. It causes symptoms such as headache, nausea and vomiting. If you have syphilis and don’t receive treatment, this form can occur within the first few months to several years after infection.\n\nMeningovascular neurosyphilis: This form happens when the syphilis bacteria cause inflammation of your meninges arterial walls (endarteritis). This causes thrombosis (when blood clots block veins or arteries) and obstructs blood flow to brain tissue. It causes a variety of issues, including stroke. If you have syphilis and don’t receive treatment, this form can develop within the first few months to several years after infection.\n\nLate neurosyphilis\n\nLate neurosyphilis (parenchymal) forms include:\n\nGeneral paresis: This form happens due to chronic inflammation of your meninges (meningoencephalitis), resulting in a breakdown of brain tissue. It causes a variety of psychological symptoms and conditions. Early symptoms include mood disturbances and personality changes. If you have syphilis and don’t receive treatment, this form can occur three to 30 years after the initial infection.\n\nTabes dorsalis: This is the most severe form of neurosyphilis. It results from the breakdown of the posterior (dorsal) column and roots of your spinal cord. It causes a variety of symptoms, including movement issues, nerve pain and bladder dysfunction. If you have syphilis and don’t receive treatment, tabes dorsalis can occur anywhere from five to 50 years after infection.\n\nWho does neurosyphilis affect?\n\nNeurosyphilis can affect anyone who has a syphilis infection, especially if you don’t receive treatment for syphilis for months or years.\n\nPeople who have unprotected sex are at high risk for the transmission of syphilis. Men who have sex with men (MSM) account for about 80% of syphilis cases in the United States.\n\nPeople with HIV tend to develop symptoms of neurosyphilis sooner than people without HIV. Researchers aren’t sure why this happens, but they think it might be because people with HIV have weakened immune systems.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHow common is neurosyphilis?\n\nIt’s difficult for researchers to determine how common neurosyphilis is because the reporting of cases is inconsistent. But they do know how common syphilis is — there were over 133,000 cases in the U.S. in 2020. It’s one of the most common STIs.\n\nAsymptomatic neurosyphilis is the most common form of neurosyphilis. General paresis and tabes dorsalis are less common than the other forms due to medical advancements in the prevention, screening and treatment of syphilis.\n\nWhat are the symptoms of neurosyphilis?\n\nNeurosyphilis symptoms mainly affect your nervous system. They’re distinct from symptoms of syphilis.\n\nThe symptoms of neurosyphilis depend on its form. The earliest form — asymptomatic neurosyphilis — has no symptoms.\n\nMeningeal neurosyphilis symptoms\n\nSymptoms of meningeal neurosyphilis include:\n\nHeadache.\n\nNausea and vomiting.\n\nNeck stiffness.\n\nLight sensitivity (photophobia).\n\nVision or hearing issues.\n\nCranial nerve dysfunction.\n\nMenigovascular neurosyphilis symptoms\n\nMenigovascular neurosyphilis symptoms include those of the meningeal form in addition to:\n\nVertigo.\n\nStroke.\n\nMuscle weakness or loss (atrophy), especially in your legs.\n\nGeneral paresis symptoms\n\nHealthcare providers divide general paresis symptoms into early and late symptoms. They can develop gradually or suddenly.\n\nEarly symptoms of general paresis include:\n\nMood disturbances, such as irritability.\n\nPersonality changes.\n\nChanges in sleeping habits.\n\nForgetfulness.\n\nLate symptoms of general paresis include:\n\nMood swings (labile mood).\n\nMemory loss.\n\nImpaired judgment.\n\nConfusion.\n\nDelusions.\n\nSeizures.\n\nIt can also cause psychiatric conditions, including:\n\nDepression.\n\nDelirium.\n\nMania.\n\nPsychosis.\n\nTabes dorsalis symptoms\n\nSymptoms of tabes dorsalis include:\n\nAtaxia.\n\nNerve pain.\n\nBladder control issues.\n\nAbnormal sensations, such as burning or tingling (paresthesia).\n\nVision changes.\n\nEye issues, such as pupil abnormalities (Argyll Robertson pupils) and ocular palsies.\n\nLoss of coordination and reflexes.\n\nNeuropathic arthropathy (Charcot joint).\n\nProblems walking.\n\nWhat are the symptoms of syphilis?\n\nSyphilis symptoms vary depending on the stage of the infection.\n\nIn the first phase, a chancre (small, painless sore) develops on your genitals.\n\nDuring the second phase of syphilis, a pink, bumpy, rough rash appears on your skin. It usually appears on the palms of your hands or soles of your feet. You may also have flu-like symptoms, such as:\n\nFatigue.\n\nFever.\n\nSore throat.\n\nMuscle aches.\n\nIt’s important to seek medical care as soon as possible if you develop these symptoms. If you find out a sexual partner has tested positive for syphilis, you should get an STI test.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat causes neurosyphilis?\n\nA bacterium called Treponema pallidum causes neurosyphilis. More specifically, the bacterium invades your central nervous system (CNS), causing neurological symptoms. This is the same bacterium that causes syphilis. The bacteria can enter your body through your anus, vagina, penis, mouth or broken skin.\n\nNeurosyphilis can occur during any stage of syphilis.\n\nResearch suggests that in the majority of people who have syphilis, bacterium infect their CNS — often before they experience symptoms of syphilis. However, for some people, the infection of their CNS can spontaneously (randomly) go away without causing inflammation and neurological symptoms.\n\nSyphilis, however, won’t go away without antibiotic treatment. Your risk of developing symptomatic neurosyphilis increases the longer you have an untreated syphilis infection.\n\nIs neurosyphilis contagious?\n\nNeurosyphilis itself isn’t contagious. It’s a complication of syphilis.\n\nBut syphilis is contagious. It spreads through sexual contact with someone who has the infection. Having unprotected vaginal, anal or oral sex increases your chances of getting syphilis.\n\nHow is neurosyphilis treated?\n\nStopping neurosyphilis and preventing it from getting worse involves treating the syphilis infection.\n\nHealthcare providers use antibiotics to treat syphilis and other bacterial infections. They most commonly prescribe penicillin — either by an IV in your vein or intramuscular injections (shots). Another common antibiotic for syphilis treatment is ceftriaxone.\n\nAfter treatment, you’ll need several follow-up blood tests at different intervals, such as at three months and six months, to make sure the infection is gone. You’ll also need follow-up lumbar punctures for cerebrospinal fluid analysis every six months to make sure the infection isn’t present in your central nervous system.\n\nYour healthcare provider will give you information about these follow-up tests. Don’t be afraid to ask them questions about the process.\n\nCan neurosyphilis damage be reversed?\n\nAntibiotic treatment stops the progression of neurosyphilis. But treatment may not be able to reverse the neurological damage that has already occurred.\n\nPeople who have asymptomatic or meningeal neurosyphilis generally return to their original health if they receive proper treatment. People with meningovascular neurosyphilis, general paresis or tabes dorsalis may have an improvement in their symptoms after treatment. However, they usually don’t return to their original health."
