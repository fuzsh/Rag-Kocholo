(Smithers-Sheedy et al 2014). This codelist did not attempt to identify underlying conditions which may be included within cerebral palsy definitions: we searched for a record of cerebral palsy or a direct synonym, as the aim was to describe people who would be identified as eligible for COVID-19 vaccination due to a record specifically of cerebral palsy.\n\nIncluded codes were kindly reviewed by Cally Tann at LSHTM.\n\nReferences\n\nCarter, B., Verity Bennett, C., Bethel, J., Jones, H.
