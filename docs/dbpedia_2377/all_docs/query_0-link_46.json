        "text": "With a population of around 450,000, Canberra is the capital and seventh largest city in Australia. The still young capital – it will celebrate its 100th anniversary in 2027 – is located in its own small state, the Australian Capital Territory (ACT), and was designated in 1908 as a compromise solution between the rival cities of Melbourne and Sydney. In the following years, the “planned city” was built on a greenfield site; geometric motifs such as circles, triangles, hexagons and visual axes determine its structure.\n\nIn Canberra everything is “national”; the Museum of Australia, the National Library, the Science and Technology Centre Questacon, the National Gallery and the High Court of Australia. The architecturally impressive Parliament House sits on a hill high above the city. From up here, the view falls on Anzac Parade, a boulevard flanked by 14 war memorials, at the end of which is the massive Australian War Memorial.\n\nThe individual destinations are quite far apart; there is no classic city centre or even a historic old town. It’s almost impossible to walk around the city; the best way to explore it is by bike. There are large parks between the various institutions, which allows a relaxed driving away from the traffic."
