        "text": "A government department has been charged with failing to meet safety standards at the National Science and Technology Centre known as Questacon over an incident that seriously injured a child.\n\nThe nine-year-old child was allegedly burned on the hand and wrist when they touched a plasma globe during a July 2022 visit to the Canberra centre.\n\nAn investigation found the child had used the supplied alcohol-based hand sanitiser, which then ignited when the child touched the plasma globe.\n\nKnow the news with the 7NEWS app: Download today\n\nIt has been alleged the federal Department of Industry, Science and Resources, which runs Questacon, could have eliminated or minimised the risk to the child.\n\nProsecutors allege staff should have provided non-alcohol based sanitisers or soap to reduce the risk of fire and removed the globes when they found there was a risk.\n\nThey also allege management should have limited the operation of plasma globes to trained workers and warned visitors about spark ignition and the risk of fire.\n\nThe Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions has charged the department with a category two criminal offence under the Worker Health and Safety Act, carrying a maximum penalty of $1.5 million if convicted.\n\nThe department said it is committed to maintaining Questacon as a safe place for visitors.\n\nIt said, following the alleged incident, the plasma globes were removed and a range of actions taken.\n\n“Safety of both visitors and staff at the centre is of paramount importance to Questacon,” a spokesperson said.\n\nThe matter will be heard in the ACT Magistrates Court in September."
