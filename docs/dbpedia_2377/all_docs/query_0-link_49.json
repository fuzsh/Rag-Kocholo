Our Robotic Future examines the similarities and differences between humans and machines.\n\nIn the Fundamental gallery, explore classic science in exciting ways.\n\nExperience the power and beauty of our planet in Awesome Earth, as you feel the force of an earthquake, watch a tornado form or let lightning spark your imagination.\n\nUnleash your inner scientist with an array of intriguing experiments, engaging demonstrations and interesting displays at Q Lab. The Questacon Beehive is the new home for more than 10,000 of nature’s hardest workers and lets you see their busy and buzzy activity up close.\n\nIn the Mars gallery, gaze at Questacon’s 7-metre Mars globe and discover the landscape of the red planet.\n\nNo visit is complete without watching a Spectacular Science Show.
