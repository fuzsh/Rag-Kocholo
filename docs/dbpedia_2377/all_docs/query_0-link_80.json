        "text": "If you are Arachnophobic like me, your first instinct may be to give the Spiders exhibition at Questacon a wide berth – but don’t worry – they won’t bite! The whole family is going to love this fascinating, hands-on exploration into the the Spider world! One of our favourite family museums to visit has to be Questacon, The National Science and Technology Museum in Canberra. If you’ve never been – or even if you are a repeat offender – these school holidays are a great time to visit, because their current feature exhibit is the absolutely fascinating – Spiders!\n\nYou’ll find the Spiders exhibition on the very top floor of Questacon (admission prices listed at the end of this article) – but the real fun begins in the Questacon entrance with a huge, hairy, black funnel web! If this doesn’t creep you out enough, wait until he rears-up and shows off his motorised, waving legs! Cute! (Shudder!) Needless to say, he’s a huge hit with the kids.\n\nNow my two girls are the type that scream “Spider” at a teeny little piece of fluff a mile away from them, but they both just loved this whole exhibition, from start to finish, and we spent a good hour going through everything.\n\nBrooke and Samantha loved all the hands-on opportunities to examine spiders up close, and learn about their remarkable capabilities – how they see, what they eat, how they catch their prey – you can even watch huge videos of attacking spiders….charming!\n\nSteel yourself – the only real ones are behind glass!\n\nIt really is all creepily spell-binding, and by the time you get to the glass case full of real-life large spiders, you’ll be almost desensitised….almost! Don’t worry – all these spiders in this glass case don’t harm humans…well, not seriously!\n\nThe kids really enjoyed the hands-on investigations into what makes spiders – well – what they are – eight-legged freaks! No, no I don’t really mean that – by the end of the exhibit even I had grown far more respect and admiration for spiders. (Now I tend to stifle the impulse to whip out the bug-spray whenever I see one – well, at least for half the time!)\n\nSpeaking of bug spray, it would take a very big can to do away with this huge version of a funnel web! Press play on this quick video – if you dare!\n\nWhen you’ve had your fill of the Spiders exhibit, you can work your way down through all the other floors of Questacon’s action-filled tower of science – you’re going to need another couple of hours for a good look around.\n\nCheck out the Questacon Spider show\n\nMake sure to catch one of the Questacon live shows too, located in the downstairs theatre. .\n\nAn assortment of ever-changing Questacon science shows run throughout the day. Playing for around 20 minutes, these interesting and fun live shows will have you and the kids loving learning about science! We saw the Spiders show, presented by Sam. He was very entertaining and kept the kids really engaged. We emerged from the show positively brimming with impressive spider knowledge!\n\nStill want more? Take a pet spider home with you!\n\nDon’t forget to drop into the Questacon shop before you go to get a cuddly tarantula, remote control spider or even a $3 plastic “pet” spider complete with scan-able coaster – this works with a special (free download) Spider app so that you can project spiders onto yourself – or at least, on your mobile phone! They even play ball – awwww!\n\nQuestacon is tons of fun for both kids and adults any day of the week, but with the added attraction of Spiders, you really should scuttle on down there before the whole exhibit up-and-crawls away – don’t worry, there’s still plenty of time – the Spiders exhibit ends in October 2016.\n\nQuestacon National Science and Technology Museum Info\n\nAdmission prices (as at April 2016)\n\nAdult $23.00 Concession $17.50 Child (4 – 16 years) $17.50 Child (Under 4 years) Free Family (2 Adults + 3 Children) $70.00 ($8.00 for each additional child)\n\nLocation King Edward Terrace, Parkes, Canberra, Australian Capital Territory, Australia.\n\nOpening hours Open daily between 9.00 am and 5.00 pm – closed 25 December.\n\nContact details Phone: +61 02 6270 2800 Official website – http://www.questacon.edu.au/\n\nHow to get there On Foot – Questacon is approximately 30 minutes walk from the city centre (Civic)\n\nBy Car – Paid parking is available next-door to Questacon\n\nBy Bus – Action buses are the Canberra bus service around the city.
