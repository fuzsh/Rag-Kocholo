        "text": "Here is everything you need to know about our excursion to Questacon, run as part of our science weeks.\n\nWhere and what\n\nQuestacon! We will tour selected parts of Questacon, and we spend time in Mini Q – a hands-on science exhibition for children under 6 years old. Sometimes we get to see a science show too.\n\nWhen\n\nDate as per our email to families.\n\nTimings and transport\n\nFamilies arrange their own transport to drop off children at Questacon. Here is a map to find Questacon.\n\nPlease bring your child to the Questacon admission desk at 9:15am, where one of the teachers will welcome you. If you are running late, please ring the GAP mobile on 0481 590 656.\n\nThe staff and children will return to the GAP by ACTION bus. We will leave Questacon on ACTION Bus #1 at 12:20 pm, or Bus #3 at 12:37pm. Arriving at GAP by 1:30pm latest, we’ll resume our normal program there.\n\nAs usual with public buses, there are no seatbelts and children are required to remain seated while the bus is moving.\n\nPick up is at 3:30 at the GAP, as usual.\n\nCost\n\nExcursion fees cover any tour guide or entry fees and logistical costs, and are added to your statement on the day of the excursion. This excursion is approximately $22 per child.\n\nWhat to bring\n\nPlease pack all your child’s belongings in one backpack or bag (clearly labeled with their name) that he/she can carry home on the bus by himself/herself. Please pack a morning tea (separate from lunch) which can easily be eaten at Questacon (eg rice crackers or fruit; not yoghurt). Please keep in mind that we won’t have access to a refrigerator while on the excursion.\n\nStaff and parent volunteers\n\nThere will be three or more GAP teachers/director supervising this excursion.\n\nParent volunteers are needed. No siblings are allowed on this excursion – volunteers will have their hands full with the GAP children.\n\nWe will maintain a 4:1 ratio of children:adults for this excursion. (A class of 22 children requires 6 adults.)\n\nPermission\n\nPlease sign the Excursion Authorisation Signature Sheet when you drop off your child on the day of the excursion.\n\nContingency plans\n\nIf we are running late returning to GAP, we will ring the Playschool management to let them know. In the highly unlikely event the bus has a break-down which would cause us to arrive at GAP after pick up time, the Playschool will notify parents directly."
