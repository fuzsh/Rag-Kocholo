Aimed primarily at children it explains many scientific \"mysteries\" such as how electricity is generated, why we have two eyes and two ears and why air pressure sucks the roof off a house. One of the primary focuses of Questacon is to inspire young children to learn about science, involving them in a series of interactive exhibitions that allows learning by experience. View volcanic eruptions, experience a realistic earthquake and wander among the wonderworks of some of Questacon's favorite exhibits - entertainment is guaranteed."
