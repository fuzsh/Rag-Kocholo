        "text": "Decade-long partnership focuses on providing education opportunities to Australia’s next generation of engineers\n\nRaytheon Australia and Questacon, Australia’s National Science and Technology Centre, have marked 10 years of partnership by announcing the development of a pilot of the Engineering is Elementary program for Australian schools.\n\nThe new program draws from a highly successful science, technology, engineering and math, or STEM, initiative created by the prominent S. based Museum of Science. The Australian Engineering is Elementary program will provide teachers with a framework to deliver content aligned with the Australian Curriculum that engages teachers using hands-on problem solving through engineering solutions. Raytheon’s sponsorship will fund the professional learning for up to 40 teachers in Canberra and South Australia who will implement the program. Teachers will participate in a series of workshops and be given resource kits, in-class support and access to online support materials including activities and class observation videos.\n\n“As Australia’s leading systems integrator, we play a critical role in motivating young people to continue their studies in science, technology, engineering and mathematics,” said Michael Ward, managing director of Raytheon Australia. “This expansion of our partnership with Questacon will help to develop the next generation of Australian engineers and ensure the nation’s future workforce has the skills they need to be successful.”\n\nFollowing the initial phase of the program, a Teacher Educator Institute Workshop will be rolled out to additional teachers who will receive training, resources and materials to facilitate their own Engineering is Elementary program in their schools.\n\n“Every year Questacon continues to engage, connect and inspire all Australians through programs delivered across the country,” said Professor Graham Durant AM, director of Questacon. “Raytheon’s investment in Engineering is Elementary will support primary school teachers in delivering real-world STEM examples and challenges for students to solve in the classroom.”\n\nRaytheon Australia has demonstrated its commitment to STEM education through other Questacon programs such as, Innovation Factory – Invent and Play, a travelling exhibition which toured science centres around Australia attracting over 600,000 visitors and the Schmidt Studio, Questacon’s state-of-the-art digital broadcast studio which has reached 13,512 students at 387 schools.\n\nThe company is also committed to working with the Australian Government to deliver opportunities for Australian students in STEM education. Raytheon Australia is supportive of the Australian Government’s National Innovation and Science Agenda which states that: “The nature of work is changing. Around 75 per cent of the fastest-growing industries require skills in science, technology, engineering and maths (STEM).”"
