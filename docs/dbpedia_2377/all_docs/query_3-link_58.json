        "text": "Hello!\n\nItâ€™s Wednesday again and Iâ€™m sharing a great adventure we had in Canberra recently. It was amazing fun sharing hands-on science experiments with my daughter and two of my grandchildren.\n\nTaking little ones to Questacon\n\nWhen I say â€˜little onesâ€™ I mean a one year old and a three year old.\n\nNot really old enough to engage with science yet, you might question. But think again. Questacon is a fabulous place to explore science and learn through play, even oldies like me can learn new things!\n\nWhat is Questacon?\n\nQuestacon â€“ the National Science and Technology Centre is an interactive science communication facility in Canberra, Australia. It is a museum with more than 200 interactive exhibits relating to science and technology. It has many science programs that are intended to inspire the children of Australia to love science. Source\n\nIt was officially opened in November 1988. I remember taking our three girls there for workshops and fun in the school holidays when they were at primary school. Canberra is a 3 hour drive away for us, so we were obviously keen to help them enjoy learning about science! Itâ€™s even better these days than it was back then.\n\nThat all might sound a bit dry and boring but I can assure you it was action packed, exciting few hours, full of amazing stuff to play with.\n\nThere are several â€˜galleriesâ€™ available to visit and we only did a few, but weâ€™ll definitely visit again!\n\nExcite@Q\n\nWe loved the Excite@Q gallery which was full of high energy and high impact activities like the Thermal Camera which captured us dancing using our body heat. Hereâ€™s a photo of the Mathematician dancing â€“ a rare event at any time!\n\nWe also played air hockey with a robot â€“ it was very good! We all loved the Whoosh activity, watching and waiting to catch the colourful scarves as they were whooshed through the air tubes to flutter down on us.\n\nI enjoyed the Rototron â€“ a tunnel of LED lights that picked up on movement. If you look closely in this photo you can see me taking the photo.\n\nMini Q\n\nMini Q is aimed at the 0-6 year olds and was full of budding little scientists on the day we were there. Water play, balls flying in the air, a construction zone complete with hard hats, a play vet clinic, a pretend shop, and so much more. The little ones loved it!\n\nFun for 0-6 year olds is a custom-built environment for little scientists. Each zone in Mini Q encourages carers and their young children to explore their environment through a process of observation, prediction, testing and refining. These processes are used by little (and big) scientists to learn about the world around them, inspire imagination, and develop confidence. Source\n\nAwesome Earth\n\nIn this gallery we experienced an earthquake in the earthquake lab, played with the plasma ball, listened to the sounds of the sea and had trouble dragging the kids away from the gravity well! It was all so exciting.\n\nChildren and Science\n\nI would not have thought there would be so much to entertain little ones aged 1 and 3 but it was hard to drag them away from it all in the end, we were all enjoying ourselves so much.\n\nI like this from Questaconâ€™s website\n\nChildren are naturally curious and inquisitive and Questacon values the importance of young children playing and exploring scientifically. Our early childhood learning programs provide meaningful opportunities for young children and their carers to have fun engaging with science whilst building their scientific thinking and understanding, and developing positive attitudes towards science learning. Source\n\nEverywhere we went there were (masked) attendants ready to help, explain, and show us how to use the equipment and nothing was too much trouble., everything was hands-on and was being wiped down as soon we left each station.\n\nThe cost isnâ€™t prohibitive â€“ under 4 years of age are free, adults cost $24.50 and those on a concession card cost $18.90. We had to book online which was easy to do and could have stayed much longer but our one year old needed a sleep!\n\nMore information on Questacon and all they offer can be found here â€“ Questacon\n\nWednesdays are for sharing some amazing moments â€“ this visit was mine for the week. #wakeupandbeamazingwednesday\n\nHave an amazing day â€“ donâ€™t forget, youâ€™re amazing!\n\nDeb ðŸ™‚\n\nAll my Wordless Wednesday posts can be found by clicking this link\n\nComing Up:\n\nOur monthly linkup Whatâ€™s on Your Bookshelf (WOYBS) is coming up Friday 20 May. Itâ€™s where we share what weâ€™ve been reading, watching or simply enjoying. Hope to see you!\n\nYou can also find Debâ€™s World in lots of other places â€“ stay in touch by clicking any of the buttons below.\n\nContact Deb here\n\nCopyright Â© 2021 debs-world.com â€“ All rights reserved"
