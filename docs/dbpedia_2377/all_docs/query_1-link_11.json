        "text": "With eight themed galleries and over 200 interactive exhibits, Questacon has something to engage and excite people of all ages.\n\nMini Q—fun for 0-6 year olds encourages children to explore and splash in areas especially designed for our youngest scientists.\n\nBe shaken by an earthquake and witness a lightning strike in Awesome Earth or lie back and stare up at Mars. Discover the fascination of scientific inquiry and watch live science demonstrations in Q Lab.\n\nQuestacon’s Excite@Q exhibition provides you with energetic experiences focusing on spectacular scientific phenomena. Excite@Q is a complete hands on, minds on experience that tests your reflexes, skills and perceptions! Compose a musical masterpiece using lights and sensors, free fall down a 6.7 m slide or test your reaction time in a game of Batak.\n\nQuestacon also has its own unique brand of science theatre which allows you to sit back and watch crashes and explosions as you enjoy the fun and excitement of live science performances.\n\nOpen 9.00 am to 5.00 pm every day except 25 December. Admission fees apply."
