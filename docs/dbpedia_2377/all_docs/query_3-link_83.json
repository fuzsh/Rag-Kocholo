        "text": "In short:\n\nThe Department of Industry Science and Resources is facing a single charge of breaching work, health and safety laws which carries a maximum fine of $1.5 million.\n\nIt's alleged a nine-year-old child was touching a plasma globe in one of the galleries when the incident happened, leaving them with burns to their hands and wrists.\n\nWhat's next?\n\nThe matter is listed for a mention in the ACT Magistrates Court on September 12.\n\nAn Australian government department has been charged after a child's hands allegedly caught fire at Questacon leaving them with serious injuries.\n\nCanberra-based Questacon, also known as the National Science and Technology Centre, offers a range of \"hands-on'' activities to help young people engage with science, technology and innovation.\n\nProsecutors allege the nine-year-old child was touching a plasma globe in one of Questacon's galleries when the incident happened in July 2022, leaving them with burns to their hands and wrists.\n\nA Comcare investigation found a spark from the globe had ignited the alcohol-based hand sanitiser the child had used, which had been supplied by Questacon.\n\nThe Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions has filed a single charge in the ACT Magistrates Court, alleging the Department of Industry, Science and Resources (DISR) failed in its work, health and safety duties, which carries a maximum fine of $1.5 million.\n\nProsecutors allege the department could have eliminated or minimised the risks of the incident by:\n\n• Removing the plasma globes after discovering the fire risk from alcohol-based hand sanitiser\n\n• Limiting the use and operation of the plasma globes to trained Questacon workers\n\n• Providing a non-alcohol-based sanitiser or portable soap and water handwashing stations\n\n• Warning visitors about spark ignition and the risk of fire\n\nThe matter is listed for a mention in the ACT Magistrates Court on September 12.\n\nA DISR spokesperson said they were unable to comment on the details of the incident because the matter was before the courts.\n\n\"Safety of both visitors and staff at the centre is of paramount importance to Questacon and we are committed to maintaining Questacon as a safe place for Australians to visit,'' the spokesperson said."
