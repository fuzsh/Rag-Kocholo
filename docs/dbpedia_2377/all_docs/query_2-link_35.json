        "text": "Students in this course develop their science communication skills in authentic science engagement settings, creating real-world impact and building networks and pathways to support career development. The course allows students to choose from a range of one-year intensive fieldwork placements at some of Australia’s leading science engagement organisations. Students explore the fundamental theory that underpins science communication in such settings, then apply it to deliver, evaluate and improve existing programs, develop novel programs and work on other suitable priorities of the fieldwork host – including working alongside and learning from their staff.\n\nTo see current fieldwork placement opportunities see the 'Class' tab. For more details, see all work-integrated learning opportunities the Australian National Centre for the Public Awareness of Science.\n\nLearning Outcomes\n\nUpon successful completion, students will have the knowledge and skills to:\n\nImplement, analyse and critique common activities of science communication organisations such as program design, delivery and evaluation.\n\nDesign, implement and critically evaluate novel science communication activities in real-world settings.\n\nDemonstrate high-level proficiency and theoretical understanding of science communication techniques including presentation, facilitation, online and in-person engagement, and creation of equipment/resources.\n\nEffectively and inclusively communicate science to audiences of varied ages and backgrounds, including youth, families, culturally and linguistically diverse communities and minoritised groups.\n\nIdentify, utilise and formulate bidirectional relationships between the theory and practice of science communication.\n\nOther Information\n\nCurrent fieldwork hosts can be found in the class scheduling information. Please visit the Centre for the Public Awareness of Science website for further details of what fieldwork placements may involve and the application process. If you are a science communication organisation that would like to host ANU students, or a potential applicant with a suggested fieldwork host, please contact the course convenor.\n\nAs placements are limited, students must apply by September 30 (round 1) or November 30 (round 2 - only run if spaces remain) in the year prior to study by submitting:\n\na CV including (1) any experience/qualifications relevant to the fieldwork placement (however these are not mandatory), and (2) contact details (phone and email) for two referees, preferably relevant to the placement.\n\na one A4 page statement noting which fieldwork placement they are applying for, why they would be a valuable and effective person for the preferred fieldwork placement, and anything else they think the panel should know.\n\nPlease email to graham.walker@anu.edu.au and cpas@anu.edu.au; NOTE for students applying for a degree program at the same time please also upload these documents via the relevant Application Portal.\n\nLate applications may be considered, please contact the course convenor.\n\nFollowing review of applications, there will be an interview process including a short science communication audition activity (e.g. a brief talk or demonstration). Applications and interviews will be assessed on applicant's creativity and originality, motivation for applying, existing skills and knowledge, qualifications, interpersonal skills, past experience, ambition and adaptability. Contact the course convenor for more details.\n\nIndicative Assessment\n\nDelivery of science communication activities (video recordings, reflections, reports, oral presentations, etc.) (30) [LO 1,2,3,4,5]\n\nJournal Paper - evaluation/research and refinement of an existing science communication activity (35) [LO 1,3,4,5]\n\nCreative Project Plan (design/develop novel science communication projects) (10) [LO 1,2,3,4,5]\n\nCreative Project Report and Artifact (deliver and evaluate a novel science communication project) (25) [LO 1,2,3,4,5]\n\nThe ANU uses Turnitin to enhance student citation and referencing techniques, and to assess assignment submissions as a component of the University's approach to managing Academic Integrity. While the use of Turnitin is not mandatory, the ANU highly recommends Turnitin is used by both teaching staff and students. For additional information regarding Turnitin please visit the ANU Online website.\n\nWorkload\n\nThis course is to be enrolled in as 12 units + 12 units across two consecutive Semesters, commencing in Semester 1 and concluding in Semester 2 of the same year, in one fieldwork placement.\n\nThe expected workload will consist of approximately 260 hours per semester of which approximately 10% consists of lectures and other ANU-led teaching, with the rest split between team/location-based activity with the fieldwork host and independent self-study, assignments, fieldwork specific lectures and workshops, and individual/team fieldwork – the exact split of this will depend on the nature of fieldwork tasks.\n\nInherent Requirements\n\nDuring this course, students learn skills associated with science engagement activities. This includes:\n\nPresenting programs to schools and the public (e.g. interactive science shows, exhibitions, nature tours/walks, and hands-on workshops).\n\nSafely demonstrating and facilitating hands-on and/or or location-based science experiments, activities and experiences.\n\nMonitoring activities for potential hazards and responding dynamically to audience needs.\n\nStudents who cannot meet these requirements will not be able to pass compulsory assessment tasks and therefore will not be able to pass the course.\n\nDuring this course, students must participate in work-integrated learning which may include science engagement programs, events and other activities organised by our fieldwork hosts. In order to participate in these activities, students are required to:\n\nObtain ACT Working with Vulnerable People registration and pass additional checks for other States and Territories as deemed appropriate by the course convenor and/or fieldwork host.\n\nBe available for activities after hours and on weekends (by negotiation).\n\nStudents who cannot complete these requirements will not be able to participate in the work-integrated learning and therefore cannot pass the course.\n\nStudents are also typically expected to contribute to the practical operations of the fieldwork hosts activity by:\n\nAssisting to set-up and pack down equipment.\n\nFor selected hosts, working in outdoor locations with sometimes limited accessibility such as nature reserves and botanic gardens.\n\nStudents who cannot meet these requirements will need to have an exemption approved by the course convenor. As this cannot be guaranteed in all circumstances, students are strongly encouraged to discuss their circumstances with the course convenor before enrolling in this course.\n\nRequisite and Incompatibility\n\nTo enrol in this course you must be enrolled in the Master of Science Communication program. This course must be taken twice in consecutive semesters (12+12) within the same calendar year and with the same fieldwork host. Students must be concurrently enrolled in or have completed SCOM8014, which provides deeper conceptual background to enhance the fieldwork placement. This course is incompatible with SCOM6004, SCOM8004A and SCOM8004B. These requirements may be flexible in very specific circumstances, permission must be sought from the course convenor.\n\nYou will need to contact the Centre for the Public Awareness of Science to request a permission code to enrol in this course.\n\nPrescribed Texts\n\nNone\n\nAssumed Knowledge\n\nExperience in real-world science communication activities as a volunteer or professionally is helpful but by no means essential - thorough tuition and training will be provided."
