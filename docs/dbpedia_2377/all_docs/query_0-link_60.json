The International Embassies in Canberra are regularly built in the traditional architectural style of the nation so you can go on an international architectural tour without leaving the city. The National Gallery has an international collection with a fantastic range of contemporary indigenous art. Questacon, an interactive science and technology centre, is fantastic fun for the whole family.\n\nEating out\n\nVisit vineyards and breweries, dine outdoors or with a view, and enjoy the strong fine food and wine culture with over 300 restaurants, cafés and pubs. There are regular food and wine festivals including a moving feast featuring local vineyards and local produce and a truffle festival.\n\nBeyond Canberra\n\nSurrounding Canberra are stunning landscapes: alpine peaks, parks, reserves, clean air and pure water. You could go for a bushwalk through Namadgi National Park and explore the indigenous rock art and shelters, go to the Tidbinbilla Nature Reserve and see animals in their natural habitat. Or just explore the vineyards, galleries and rural retreats surrounding the city.\n\nKaren Prosser:\n\n\"The Gorman House Arts Centre Markets are on every Saturday, you can go along and listen to live music, eat delicious multicultural food and browse through beautiful local and handmade products.\"\n\n\"Canberra and its surrounds is one of the best places in Australia to see kangaroos, wallabies and wallaroos, particularly in the grounds of Government House!\"\n\nDiscover more at visitcanberra.com.au"
