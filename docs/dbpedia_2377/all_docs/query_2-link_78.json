Whether it’s on your year six excursion to Canberra or during the school holidays, it is a fun vibrant place where kids can learn about all things science and technology. However, a lesser known fact about the well-known tourist attraction is that it’s wide range of staff are all members of the APS.\n\nFrom working at the information desk, presenting science shows and even chatting about science in the galleries, each and every member of Questacon is playing their role in creating inspiration for not only children across Australia, but the APS as well.\n\nIn this episode we are joined by three members from Questacon, The National Science and Technology Centre; Deputy Director and General Manager Kate Driver, Exhibition Designer Rachel Ball and Learning Programs Content Development Leader, David Cannell. Listen as they discuss a truly different side to working in the APS."
