        "text": "A very insightful essay* in Psychology Today by Samuel Wilson (Associate Professor of Leadership, Swinburne University of Technology) on \"Responsible Social Innovation and the Public Good: What does it mean to innovate for the public interest?\". Link to essay here: https://lnkd.in/gyXz7TGv (*Based on a presentation given at the 15th International Social Innovation Research Conference in Guimaraes, Portugal.) Wilson takes the reader through definitions and debates around \"public good\", and arrives at the following point, namely that: \"... there is no single, determinate public good, then what we are left with is the search for the public good .... And if clashing perspectives are an inevitable characteristic of the public good, then the search for the public good always occurs in the context of uncertainty, complexity, and contestation.\" With this in mind he offers \"three principles that might guide the search for the public good in pluralistic contexts\", that are presented below (extracted from his essay): ------------ Principle 1: Be open to heterodox views on the public good In pluralistic societies, there are reasonable differences of opinion about what is the right, just, or fair thing to do. It is, therefore, imperative to be tolerant of plural, even heterodox, perspectives as part of the search for common ground and a shared sense of the public good. Principle 2: Cultivate both/and thinking Living with paradox requires us to do something that, in descriptive terms, is quite simple: namely, accept that there is no black and white, no right and wrong, and that two logically incompatible positions might well be true .... However, practically speaking, living and working with paradox is difficult and calls on us to eschew either/or thinking and instead foster both/and thinking. Principle 3: Embrace “clumsy” solutions Shared power contexts call on all of us to hold our worldviews and preferred solutions more lightly than we may prefer. To address complex challenges in complex contexts, it is therefore vital to eschew “elegant” solutions—those that reflect the perspectives of single worldviews—and instead embrace “clumsy” solutions—those that experimentally combine different perspectives .... ---------- A highly recommended read, especially for those curious about current language and assumptions around the role of public universities as being for the public good, and whether the conditions exist within them to genuinely cultivate the principles he espouses.

We therefore once again teamed up with other Nordic actors in Brussels, to deliver the high-level workshop, “Knocking on the door of higher education institutions – the AU-EU innovation agenda and the involvement of Nordic actors”. We were involved in the project on behalf of our partner organisation Chalmers University of Technology. Some of the key messages to come out of the September workshop were that: - Collaborations are long-term initiatives that require predictable long-term funding to be effective - Universities and Higher Education Institutions are key co-creators of any future AU-EU innovation policy - Social innovation is an engine for transformational change and should be invested in - The application/reporting process of EU funding regarding AU-EU cooperation needs to be simplified/less bureaucratic If you are interested in reading about the event, the collaborative projects presented, or the conclusions from the event, you can now read about it in the event report published on the event website.\n\n𝐄𝐮𝐫𝐨𝐩𝐞𝐚𝐧 𝐋𝐄𝐀𝐃𝐄𝐑 𝐂𝐨𝐧𝐠𝐫𝐞𝐬𝐬 𝟐𝟎𝟐𝟒 – 𝐀𝐠𝐞𝐧𝐝𝐚 𝐢𝐬 𝐎𝐔𝐓 !
