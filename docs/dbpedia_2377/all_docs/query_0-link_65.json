        "text": "Home to more than 200 interactive exhibits, Questacon is a celebration of science and technology with a family-friendly edge. It’s one of Canberra’s most popular tourist attractions and is dedicated to inspiring kids to fall in love with science. It’s easy to get lost in the colourful exhibitions which spotlight everything from zoology to astronomy.\n\nThe centre’s eight interactive exhibitions are packed full of fun activities, from shadow freezing walls and earthquake simulators to robot air hockey and outer space adventures. There’s something for all ages, with a focus on experiential play. When it’s time to take a break, Questacon’s Mega Bites Café is a great place to recharge.\n\nJust a short 30-minute walk from Canberra’s city centre, Questacon is easy to reach by foot. It’s located on the southern shore of Lake Burley Griffin, with local buses stopping nearby. Paid parking is also available alongside the building for those arriving by car.\n\nQuestacon owes its existence to Professor Mike Gore, a legendary physics lecturer from the Australian National University. Since opening in 1988, Questacon has been passionate about introducing kids to the magic of science and technology. It’s underpinned by a belief that science should be fun, interactive and relevant, which shines through in every one of its dynamic exhibitions."
