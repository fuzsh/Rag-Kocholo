        "text": "Putting on a big 30th birthday bash for Questacon wasn't exactly rocket science... well, it sort of was.\n\nSubscribe now for unlimited access .\n\nor signup to continue reading\n\nAll articles from our website & app\n\nThe digital version of Today's Paper\n\nBreaking news alerts direct to your inbox\n\nInteractive Crosswords, Sudoku and Trivia\n\nAll articles from the other in your area\n\nWith astronauts wandering around and the institution's latest addition, the stunning suspended replica moon, space exploration was definitely one of the themes as Questacon looks ahead to next year's 50th anniversary of the moon landing.\n\nBubble master, Liam Johnson, entertains kids at the 30th birthday event for Questacon on Saturday. Photo: Elesa Kurtz\n\nBut Saturday was about celebrating everything the National Science and Technology Centre has become in its 30 years at its magnificent Parkes location.\n\nQuestacon was born out of ANU Professor Mike Gore wanting to bring a science museum to Australia after taking his family to experience the wonders of the Exploratorium in San Francisco.\n\nFrom its humble beginnings as a 15 exhibit show at the old Ainslie Public School, the past 30 years has seen Questacon grow into one of Australia's most visited attractions, beloved by the young and the young at heart.\n\nVisitors took a moment to lounge beneath the new moon exhibit. Photo: Elesa Kurtz\n\nEach year the centre records 250,000 drops from its famous free fall exhibit.\n\nVisitor services manager Adam Robbins said while Questacon's aspirations had remained the same for 30 years the biggest change had been its reach.\n\n\"What we've always tried to do is inspire and engage people in science,\" Mr Robbins said.\n\n\"Our reach has changed dramatically, we're not just local anymore. With our virtual tours we've gone international.\"\n\nThe Questacon Science Circus is a travelling show of 40 exhibits that traverses the length and breadth of Australia stopping primarily in regional centres to bring the joy of Questacon to as many people as possible.\n\nLos Angeles based rocket scientist John Bucknell with his son Emory. Photo: Elesa Kurtz\n\nMr Robbins added the centre maintained a strong focus on hands-on learning for children, which is why their exhibits always encouraged people to physically interact with them.\n\nAfter experiencing the countless exhibits featured on Saturday, that sprawled outside the building into the brilliant sunshine, many visitors found their way to the centre of Questacon's large spiral walkway.\n\nQuestacon's new and captivating exhibit is an inflatable replica of the moon, the only one of its kind in the southern hemisphere. It measures seven metres in diameter and is suspended above a darkened room where visitors lounge around beneath and take in the wonder of the moon's surface up close.\n\nIt, along with the new LEDUSA - a series of more than 45,000 hanging LED lights - were both unveiled in the past week.\n\nQuestacon got the tick of approval from a real life rocket scientist John Bucknell, who helped develop the Raptor engine for Elon Musk's company SpaceX.\n\nQuestacon took out the gong for tourist attractions in the Canberra Region Tourism Awards on Friday night and will represent the ACT in the category at the national awards in Launceston in March.\n\nDAILY DURING PARALYMPICS\n\nThe Paralympic Breakfast\n\nGet the best news and analysis from the Paris Paralympic Games in a daily update.\n\nDAILY\n\nYour morning news\n\nToday's top stories curated by our news team.
