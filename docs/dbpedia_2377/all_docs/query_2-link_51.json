        "text": "From the small to the seemingly impossible, science is all around us and National Science Week, running from 10-18 August this year, is a time to celebrate all the wonders of the field. Here in the nation’s capital, we relish the chance to meet scientists, discuss hot topics and celebrate our natural environment.\n\n“Science is everywhere in everything that we do, everything that we use, we are surrounded by science all the time. It is important for people to see the impact of science and understand how amazing our world is. National Science Week is a great opportunity to bring that to the forefront,” says Dr Chloe Lim, Director of Twistyfic.\n\nHolding a PhD in medical science, the trained molecular biologist and professional balloon artist is passionate about making science accessible and fun. Across three different days and locations, Dr Lim shares her children’s book What Makes You Unique (which she wrote in a single day) in The Twisty Science Show.\n\n“My book talks a lot about DNA and how that brings out different things we can see like hair, skin and eye colour, so I will be making at least a couple of people to show the diversity. I will also be making balloon DNA, the double helix structure, to show what DNA looks like under the microscope. I like to make a balloon microscope to give them [the children] an idea of how our cells are really tiny, but we have things like microscopes to help us see beyond our naked eye,” smiles Dr Lim.\n\nThe first day of The Twisty Science Show also sees attendees slip into a doctor’s coat of their own. Believing that children learn best when they are engaged, Dr Lim will be teaching children how to identify DNA themselves.\n\n“A DNA extraction from strawberries – fruit is a great source, all living things have DNA… The idea is getting hands-on with understanding how you can extract DNA from strawberries and see that goopy DNA at the end,” she smiles.\n\nEncouraging locals to get out and enjoy science throughout the week, Dr Lim says we all need to stay curious and make the time to revel in the marvels of our world.\n\n“It is important to show to everyone that anyone can do science. It’s not limited to the super smart; it’s about making science accessible to everyone. It is important to have that time to learn how things work and have a greater appreciation for science,” says Dr Lim.\n\nNot sure where to start? You don’t have to go far to find experiments, robotics, parasites or even dinosaurs as science comes to you while you shop. All major shopping centres across the region – Westfield Belconnen and Woden, South.Point Tuggeranong, Cooleman Court, Gungahlin Marketplace and the Canberra Centre – will be hosting scientific experts to share their knowledge.\n\nExperiments, workshops and fun hands-on activities will be conducted by institutions and groups like the ANU Parasitology, Young Engineers Canberra, Icon Water, Canberra Reptile Zoo, Geoscience Australia, Canberra Daleks & Robots, The National Dinosaur Museum and more.\n\nThe ever-popular underground exploration of Australian Parliament House (APH) returns with the Unconformity Tour. Above ground, at APH the great hall transforms into the GSG STEM Expo where you can meet scientists, engineers, researchers, mathematicians and technologists. In-depth events focus on particular fields such as the ASO Eye Surgery Showcase.\n\nThere will be talks, walks, comedy shows, pub night discoveries, workshops in creative computing, stargazing at Mt Stromlo Observatory and more science than you shake a stick at across the nine days.\n\nThe home of science, Questacon, has a revolving door of events throughout the week, ranging from talks to shopping centre activations and a special guest visit from the Australian Federal Police (AFP). Join the AFP as the forensic team shares the secrets to facial identification, fingerprint matching and how to uncover clues at crime scenes.\n\nEach year, the celebration of science has a school theme, a gentle guiding hand for learners around the country. This year, the theme is ‘Species Survival – More than just sustainability’. Students and educational facilities are encouraged to examine the important role science and innovation play in ensuring the survival and adaptation of different species in changing environments.\n\nWe can’t talk about species survival around Canberra and not mention the work being done at Mulligans Flat Woodland Sanctuary, where natural fauna and flora are being reintroduced to our region. National Science Week at Wildbark invites the community to explore traditional indigenous knowledge in the areas of science and technology. Want to learn more about nature? Jump on a Threatened Species Themed Walk at the Australian National Botanic Gardens and get up close with some of the rarest plants in the country.\n\nDelve into a world of exploration this National Science Week right across the Canberra region from 10-18 August, full program; scienceweek.net.au"
