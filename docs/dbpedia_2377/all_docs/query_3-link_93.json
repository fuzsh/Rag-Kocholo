        "text": "Questacon is deliberately more of a science discovery centre than a museum. It doesn’t have any fabulous old artefacts (although it has commissioned some fantastic new ones – my favourite is the Clockwork Universe), but it concentrates on its core mission of promoting a greater understanding of science and technology in the community. So here is the rating compared with our standard criteria.\n\n1. The Museum must engage and excite – Despite having been here quite a few times now (and having seen many of the standard exhibits, we still found lots of things to interest us. The exhibits change every now and again, so only one of the seven galleries was exactly as it had been when we last visited. And there was a really good mix of exhibits where you could press buttons to see something happen, and more thoughtful exhibits that made you step back and think. 9/10.\n\n2. The exhibits must work and not baffle – We found exactly one exhibit that didn’t work, out of the whole centre, which was clearly labelled. So refreshing after the Powerhouse! And there were a lot of exhibits that needed to work. And in quite a few places there were explainers hanging around to help you work out what you should learn from an exhibit. As a bonus, one of us told us that Helium was the only element that was not discovered on earth (it was discovered by looking at the sun’s spectral signature) 10/10.\n\n3. A play area should not substitute for teaching science in the museum. Questacon does have a special gallery for the under 6s (which we didn’t investigate this time) but which includes lots of water mazes, building games etc. In the museum itself, though, while you could run around just playing (particularly the ground floor room which has the Free fall big slide and a couple of table hockey games) it does take a bit of effort to avoid seeing what they are trying to teach you. 9/10.\n\n4. Televisions and computers are no longer, in themselves, cool, or more generally, everything should be up to date. We carefully checked the periodic table – it did seem to be up-to-date with the latest elements (unlike, again, the Powerhouse). The advantage of having a fairly moveable bunch of exhibits is that they are refreshed and reviewed reasonably regularly. I didn’t see anything that was seriously out-of-date, and most of the exhibits didn’t rely on an obvious coolness factor of getting you to play a computer game. 9/10.\n\n5. Museums should tell a story. As a family we were divided on this one. In my view Questacon did a good job with each gallery (various different themed rooms). But we have seen science museums that were better at taking you through the science – it probably depends how much the museum is trying to teach, versus give a taste of a scientific experience. You have to do more work for yourself here than at some other places, in order to tease out the story. 7/10.\n\nOverall 44/50\n\nAnd for the practical things:"
