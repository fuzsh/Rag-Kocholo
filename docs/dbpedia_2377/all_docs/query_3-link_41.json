        "text": "Questacon – the National Science and Technology Centre, is located on the southern shore of Lake Burley Griffin in Canberra. It is a large centre with more than 200 interactive exhibits relating to science and technology.\n\nThe centre is split up into seven galleries on different floors, accessed by a spiral ramp around the 'drum'. As of November 2009, the seven galleries are:\n\n- Terrorsaurus with anamatronic dinosaurs.\n\n- Sideshow, perhaps the most popular exhibition, looking at the science of the circus. Several popular exhibits include Free Fall, a giant slide with a six metre and seventy centimetre drop, and Track Attack, a simulated roller coaster.\n\n- MiniQ, an exhibition designed for children between the ages of 0 and 6. Exhibits include a water play area, a sensory space, and a quiet area.\n\n- Wonderworks, looking at light and sound. The exhibitions features displays on Polarised light, Fresnel lenses, and holograms.\n\n- Awesome Earth, looking at natural disasters and geology. Features a Tesla coil and an earthquake simulator.\n\n- Perception Deception explores how your brain can mix up what you see and hear.\n\n- Measure Island, makes measurement adventurous and fun.\n\nThe galleries are staffed by paid staff, as well as a team of about 60 volunteers. The volunteers occasionally will make use of Discovery Trolleys, featuring smaller, hands-on exhibits related to the gallery.\n\nThe Centre also features a number of performance spaces, used for presentations for general public and student audiences by Questacon's in-house theatre troupe, the Excited Particles. The Excited Particles also perform puppet shows for young children and more serious talks on science and current events.\n\nText source: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Questacon\n\nPhoto source: http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Questacon.jpg"
