        "text": "When Alison and Amelia Clark drove across the country to escape homelessness, Shoalwater was the affordable suburb where they start to put down roots.\n\nSix years later they're again facing homelessness as prices rise even in one of Perth's cheaper suburbs, almost an hour's drive from the CBD.\n\nA state-wide housing shortage has sent prices in the area up about 30 per cent over the last year – among the largest jumps in the nation according to property data firm CoreLogic.\n\nEven with three months' warning their landlord was selling for their own reasons, the mother and daughter haven't been able to find anywhere else.\n\n\"Six years ago when we came here it was because this place, WA, had a bunch of affordable, available housing,\" Amelia said, surrounded by the boxes the duo is packing their lives into.\n\nLoading...\n\n\"And now, you know, even here has the same issue as places like the Gold Coast and Sydney.\n\nReforms take effect, but it's still a landlord's market\n\nReforms to WA's rental laws took effect a week ago, with the government promising greater \"stability and certainty\" for renters.\n\nThat's somewhat true, with tenants able to plan further ahead as rent increases are limited to once a year.\n\nBut Alison and Amelia, who are kept company by a dog and two cats, don't feel the changes are much help.\n\n\"In this market the landlords can choose the best of the best, so no landlord's probably going to choose to have pets if they can not have pets,\" Alison said.\n\nTenants fear enforcing rights because of tight market\n\nAs principal lawyer for tenancy at community legal centre Circle Green, Alice Pennycott is no stranger to the pressures Alison and Amelia have experienced.\n\nShe said the state's vacancy rate – which is about one-sixth of what it should be – impacts many of the cases her team sees.\n\n\"At the moment, they're all kind of coloured with this threat of eviction that people face and knowing that there's not really any other affordable properties for them or appropriate properties,\" Ms Pennycott, who is also spokesperson for the Make Renting Fair campaign said.\n\nThe government has promised to look at further changes, but that's unlikely to happen before the state election in March 2025.\n\nWhen it does though, Ms Pennycott and the campaign want the amount rent can be increased by to be capped and no grounds evictions removed.\n\nWA remains the only state planning to keep no fault evictions – which allow landlords to kick tenants out without providing a reason – after New South Wales announced plans to outlaw the practice last week.\n\nCommerce Minister Sue Ellery previously said the government was concerned about scaring off landlords from an already squeezed market by doing the same.\n\nDebate over further reforms\n\nMs Pennycott and others are sceptical that would happen and say it hasn't elsewhere when the law has changed.\n\nCore Logic's head of research, Eliza Owen, reached a similar conclusion last week, writing: \"Dynamics in the rental market still seem overwhelmingly driven by broader economic and demographic factors of supply and demand, rather than tweaks to tenancy laws\".\n\nBut the Real Estate Institute of WA continues to warn it is a risk.\n\nProperty manager and REIWA Deputy President Suzanne Brown said a key concern of her clients was reforms \"eroding their rights by having no say in the property\".\n\nShe said that was the case even though they accounted for a small fraction of overall evictions.\n\n\"Private investors do a very big job for the job for the government in the heavy lifting and providing accommodation for desperate people out there,\" Ms Brown said.\n\nMs Brown said while the market remained tight, there were early signs the pressure which has afflicted West Australians for the last four years is starting to ease, including fewer people attending home opens.\n\n\"Investor lending has increased, and they're aware of the reforms coming in, so that's really positive signs that investors aren't too spooked about the reforms,\" she said.\n\n'It's not a moral failing': Alison\n\nBut that's little help for Alison and Amelia, who are now staying in a cottage they've been offered for a week or two.\n\n\"The only thing we have thought of is to save up for a caravan and then ask people if there's a property we could put it on,\" Alison said.\n\nIt's brought back memories of the last time they were homeless, which they both say affected them for years.\n\n\"I remember having to go to public bathrooms and get toilet paper to stuff the one pillow that I had, that had almost completely run out of stuffing,\" Amelia said.\n\nIn the years since, 57-year-old Alison has also battled a number of health issues and struggled to find work.\n\n\"After being homeless we have PTSD, there was a lot of issues with anxiety and not feeling part of society and feeling unsafe,\" she said.\n\n\"And so now we feel like we're stronger and we are part of a community and we believe now that we're ready to get over our health conditions and start working and really helping other people.\"\n\nShe wants to return to work, as well as study domestic violence responses.\n\nAmelia has work lined up too and wants to study psychology at university.\n\nBut their plans have been put on hold while they manage what Alison describes as the \"full time job\" of being homeless.\n\nShe hopes it won't be for long, but wants people to understand their situation.\n\n\"It's not a moral failing,\" she said.\n\nCredits:"
