In collaboration with Geoscience Australia and Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC), we have reimagined Earthquake House to provide an immersive and educational experience. Geoscience Australia’s National Earthquake Alerts Centre provided crucial technical support to Earthquake House, providing valuable input to modelling hypothetical earthquakes and replaying real seismic events. Using state-of-the-art special effects to replicate the sensations of a seismic event near Canberra, our team has integrated more than 30 advanced practical and audiovisual effects to this exhibit. 🌋📚 We are proud to continue our tradition of innovation and education, making Earthquake House a standout feature in our Awesome Earth gallery. The exhibit is included with general admission, and we invite you to experience this seismic adventure as part of your visit. We look forward to welcoming you for a unique and educational experience!\n\nWe’re thrilled to announce that our Engineering is Elementary team is on the move again for Term 3! 🚗✨ After an incredible Term 2 in QLD and WA, we are excited to bring our FREE professional learning workshops for teachers to NT, SA, and online this August and September. These workshops are designed to enhance teachers' skills, build confidence in teaching STEM, and provide a fantastic opportunity to connect with fellow educators. Join us to explore innovative teaching strategies, engage in hands-on activities, and discover new ways to inspire your students in STEM.

Their innovations have truly been #EnhancedByEngineering.👩🔬 Did you know, textile engineering merges science, technology, engineering and mathematics to create everything from clothing to industrial fabrics. First Nations women and people have long been pioneers in this field, using natural and renewable materials to weave baskets, fish traps, and more—skills passed down through generations. 🌱🐟 From crafting string-strong textiles to knotting intricate designs, First Nations women and people have been the thread that ties innovation with tradition. Their weaving wonders—from baskets to biofabrics—showcase a seamless blend of STEM, culture, and sustainability. 💚 At Questacon, we aim to inspire educators to spark STEM curiosity in the classroom through our educator programs, connecting them with opportunities to engage with country through STEM. Learn more about it here: https://bit.ly/3xhjyd7. Be sure to watch this space for a NEW unit from our Engineering is Elementary program on Textile Engineering 👀 Join us in celebrating these loom-inous ladies and all women engineers who keep the world stitched together with their brilliance! 🧶✨\n\nNine of Questacon’s wonderful science communicators have made the trip to Perth for the Australian Science Communicators conference. The Questacon team is soaking up the opportunity to connect with a range of science communication experts and practitioners. This enriching experience with a broad community of science writers, policy informers and research experts is bound to inspire new ideas and ways of working. We are looking forward to hearing their stories. Make sure to say hello if you see one of our friendly Questacon team 👋\n\nWith the King’s Birthday coming up this Monday, we can't help but reminisce about his unforgettable visit to Questacon in 1985! Picture this: a young Prince Charles, wide-eyed and captivated by our dazzling science demos with our founder, Mike Gore, at Ainslie School. This June long weekend, Questacon is open 9am to 5pm every day. It is one of our busiest times of the year, so make sure to pre-book your tickets online to avoid missing out. Limited tickets are available per session. If you can't get pre-booked tickets and you're not a member, please be prepared for a possible wait to enter.
