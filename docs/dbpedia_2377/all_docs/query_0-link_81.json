        "text": "Canberra, the vibrant capital of Australia, is home to an exciting array of kid-friendly museums and galleries to inspire inquisitive young minds. From art to science and history, these attractions help little ones learn about the world around them â€“ with plenty of fun along with way!\n\nFrom interactive science exhibits to captivating stories of Australiaâ€™s history, these iconic museums and galleries offer the perfect balance of education and entertainment. Whether youâ€™re an ACT local or visiting Canberra with the kids, this guide will share the top 10 educational attractions that are worth seeing.\n\nDonâ€™t miss these ten Canberra museums and art galleries for an inspiring family day out.\n\nRoooooaaaaarrrrr! See T-Rex and his friends at the National Dinosaur Museum in Nicholls, which boasts the largest permanent display of dinosaur paraphernalia in the country. As well as colourful exhibits and interactive areas, it has a gift shop with an impressive array of souvenirs. If your kids are really brave, you can also book to explore the museum by torchlight on a night tour.\n\nMilitary uniforms, guns, medals, war diaries, letters, bombers, helicopters and rare army vehicles are among the historic artefacts on display at the Australian War Memorial, which charts the nationâ€™s involvement in conflicts such as World War I and II and the Vietnam War. Make sure you stick around for the Last Post Ceremony in the courtyard at 4.45pm. Itâ€™s best to book your free tickets in advance to guarantee entry.\n\nStep back to the days of slate boards, chalk and inkwells in Canberraâ€™s first schoolhouse, next to St Johnâ€™s Church at Reid. It was built of rubble and locally-quarried bluestone in the first half of the 19th century to educate workersâ€™ children. The St Johnâ€™s Schoolhouse Museum is staffed by volunteers and is open on Wednesdays from 10am to 12pm and on weekends from 2pm to 4pm.\n\nGet 10 per cent off the best available rate if you mention Out & About with Kids when booking a room at East Hotel Canberra. Located between the buzzing shopping and restaurant hubs of Kingston and Manuka, the family-owned and operated hotel has special family rooms. The two-bedroom apartments have bunk beds, Xbox One consoles, games, bean bags and dress-up clothes. There are also free lollies in the lobby and kidsâ€™ mini bars. Its Italian restaurant, Agostinis, has a kidsâ€™ menu including pizza or pasta, gelato and a soft drink for $20. It also offers free bike hire to explore the area."
