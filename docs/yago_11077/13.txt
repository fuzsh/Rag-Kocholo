Bert Haanstra, one of the most important and well-known Dutch directors, was a master of unique documentary shorts that blended free improvisation with precise and delicate shots, while their poetic cinematography was complimented by rich humor. Haanstra cared not only about the landscape of his country, but also its deeper connection with society, as well as the contradiction between nature and the rapid modernization of Dutch cities. He also focused on the relationship between humans and animals - in Zoo (1962) he experiments with hidden cameras to humorously look at the subject from both sides. Throughout his career, the director received many accolades. His film Mirror of Holland (1950) won the Short Film Palme d'Or at the 1951 Cannes Film Festival, while Glass (1958) won the Academy Award for Documentary Short Subject. Haanstraâs filmography is not limited to documentary shorts though - his documentary The Human Dutch (1963) and the comedy Fanfare (1958) are amongst the most successful feature films in Dutch history. This short retrospective of Haanstraâs documentary shorts will provide a chance to get acquainted with his authentic view of his surroundings, the people and the architecture, as well as the modernization of society. This point of view is incredibly rich - ironic, but gentle and poetic, and, most importantly, seeking to observe reality with never ending wonder.
