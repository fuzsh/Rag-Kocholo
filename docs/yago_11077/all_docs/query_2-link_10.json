        "text": "This documentary probes the close connection between animals and humans. Naturalist Charles Darwin’s “survival of the fittest” theory continues to define the animal kingdom with the continuance of life frequently coming at the expense of other lives. Nevertheless, nature has provided living creatures a variety of methods to survive their environment: some assume the color and even texture of their surroundings, some are translucent, others can adjust their size. Still other species, such as the penguin, have adapted in different ways, their wings used no longer used for flying but as paddles for swimming underwater through strenuous currents of frigid water with agile ease and for tobogganing across the snow and ice on land. Across the African plains, numerous species live side by side, each having adapted to different food requirements that do not encroach on the others. Zebras, buffalos and gnus graze on grass while elephants and giraffes with their particular physical attributes eat tree leaves and grains. The ability of nature to adapt to its surroundings has always been remarkable, an example being the dung beetle, which lays its egg in a buffalo dropping and a reptile who shreds the patty in search of the egg. These and many other creatures thrive in hot and cold climates, in arid or frozen wastelands. An element of major disruption throughout all areas is man, who has, over the centuries, hunted numerous species into extinction. Man’s interactions with animal life are complicated, because he has domesticated several species as workers and companions, while torturing and abusing others for food or sport. While some cultures revere some animals, others just as easily kill and consume the same animals without thought. Yet while animals are in most ways superior to humans physically, humans have developed the ability to use their hands and their minds to make both weapons and tools. Although humans often consider themselves unique in the development of these items, scientific studies have demonstrated that several species use primitive tools for help in acquiring food. Chimpanzees have long been known to use tools for gathering food. Other species have likewise applied tools to get food, such as the archerfish that will squirt jets of water at bugs on leaves above them until the bug drops onto the water where the fish can consume it. Likewise, several birds who feed on the eggs of others fling rocks onto the eggs to break the shells. The sea otter hunts for shell fish while carrying a flat rock on which it will beat and break the shell. A decisive difference between man and animals is the ability to record our experience and pass it on to next generations. Part of the knowledge passed on is gained by mankind’s slaughter of animals in order to study them, which presents another conflict in man’s relationship to the creatures of the wild. Animals that live in herds do so primarily for protection against prey. Mothers instruct their young how to stay close to them, for a lost baby will usually be abandoned by other adults and quickly become a victim to waiting prey. In many instances, different varieties of wildlife use the abilities of others to their benefit, such as desert or African wild dogs and vultures living off the remains of prey killed by more powerful animals like cheetah or lions. These instincts are mirrored in the human desire to organize groups and communities in which security and strength are gained. In mating rituals as well, wild life and human behavior are often remarkably mirrored. Various species of male birds use dance-like movement or colorful displays of plumage to attract females. Walrus males clash in frequently violent displays of strength to impress females. Certain male fish will confront each other over boundaries which, once set, are always respected, even when a fertile female enters the area. In Antarctica, the albatross, with its impressive nine-foot wing span, displays his wings in a dance on land that, if successfully received by a female, results in a monogamous, life-long bond. Meanwhile, emperor penguins, who travel, hunt and mate in vast colonies that can number up to thousands, each develop a distinctive call that all family members will recognize over the cries of others. Males and females have an elaborate, ritualized courtship and after mating, produce in an egg after five days. Over the next fifty-four days, males will sit on the egg while the female hunts at sea, returning after the new chick is born to take over parental duties. From then on, the male and female take turns hunting and providing for their offspring, who, like all species, must be protected from natural enemies as well as the harsh environment. This dedication and effort can be seen in the familial structure of humans. Similarly in Tanzania, observation of the common chimpanzee reveals a complex social system of rank, where, under a strong alpha male intricate manners of behavior are maintained. While studies prove that animal social structures, mating rituals and family organization have parallels in human activities, other studies show other similar and more disturbing features. Animals deprived of contact with their own kind can sometimes form attachments to surrogates, even if those are not actual living beings. Some birds raised in solitude will bond with an object, just as infant monkeys will cling to an object covered in synthetic fur. Upon reaching adulthood, however, these animals are unable to form relationships with others of their own kind and are frequently violent and disruptive. In the event that mothers reject their young, if the offspring survive at all, they are usually aggressive and unable to fit into their natural social dynamic. These same reactions are frequently noted in human behavior when children are deprived of proper social contact or have a fractured family situation. All these examples demonstrate that behavior so similar to that of humans cannot be simply accidental. While humans have developed their mental abilities to such heights that they have devised methods of extending their environment and even prolonging life, that knowledge has frequently been gained at the loss not only of wild life, but of the planet’s resources. Can life continue its evolution and development even as humans contribute to their own destruction?"
