        "text": "Glas, a 1959 Oscar-winning short subject documentary film made by Bert Haanstra explores the visual beauty which is inherent in the traditional process of glassblowing and elicits a comparison between the scrupulous method-based craftsmanship of the glassblowers and the automatic process of the machines making glass bottles. This 10 minutes 30 seconds documentary film is shot in the glass factories of Leerdam and Schiedam. Along with some peppy jazz music, a ballet of working hands and the mechanical work of the machines is amalgamated in a synchronized manner which enhances the beauty of the film. By showing the little glitch in machine work wherein many bottles break, it presents the precision and perfection of the work of the glassblowers and brings out the fact that machines can’t work as efficiently as the workers do.\n\nThe film seems to have been divided into four parts. The first part presents the workers blowing glass in the factory efficiently. Their actions seem to go with the music as it flows, playing around with molten glass with a certain sense of comfort, ease and perfection in glassblowing. The second part is taken over by the machines where bottles were being manufactured by machines in bulk in the absence of workers. As a bottle gets stuck on the belt, many other bottles break as they fall. This particular scene brings out the importance of the glassblowers. The third part is an amalgamation of the work of the glassblowers and the machines, glimpses of the process of glass-making is shown along with the jazz music. In the fourth and the last part, music takes over. Instead of the sand, fire and smoke, the cheeks, fingers and movements of the glassblowers are focused on which run along with the music.\n\nMusic plays a vital role in this documentary. Music lightens up the film and gives it a distinctive quality. Each part has music of its own. The music is soft and easy in the first part whereas in the second part when machines take over, the music changes to a digital/robotic tone signifying automation. The third part manifests the playing of various instruments such as saxophone, piano, etc. In the fourth part, the actions of the glassblowers are shown in such a way that it seems like they are playing the instruments. Their actions brilliantly follow the rhythm of the Jazz music. For instance, when saxophone plays in the film, one of the glassblowers is shown blowing the glass which looks similar to playing the saxophone and when the piano plays the focus is on the glassblower’s fingers working to make glass. The music seamlessly merges with the activities of the glassblowers giving it a bit of humoristic and beautiful tone."
