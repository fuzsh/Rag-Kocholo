        "text": "As I have repeatedly mentioned before, film has a large role in commenting on and shaping the perceptions of a specific location – a city, a building, anything really on top of which we can add layers and layers of narratives – the real ones that we create through everyday life, and those narratives that are consciously placed there by film makers. As an extension of my last blog post and in preparation of our final presentation, I have looked a little more extensively at the interesting phenomenon of Amsterdamned in comparison with its American predecessor Puppet on a Chain.\n\nAgain linking my observations back to the horror city as described by Sanders, I found the different ways that a city can be portrayed as crime city interesting. Sanders of course talks about New York, but one aspect was particularly appropriate to my topic today:\n\nGiven the film’s insistence on realism, it was not surprising that The Naked City depicted a community that, while not crime-free, was essentially a place of civic order. This image was nothing less than accurate at a time when, by almost any standard, the city was astonishingly safe. (Sanders 368)\n\nWhen looking at both Amsterdamned and Puppet on a Chain, and other similar movies, it seems to me that in those depictions of Amsterdam, the city is stuck in precisely this pre-horror city condition: that crime is not embedded within the city itself, but rather an exception. This becomes especially obvious when seeing how everyday life goes on around the crimes. During the speedboat chase in both movies, we can see people go about their normal business – or, possibly, stopping to watch the chase of the criminal seemingly without understanding the severity of the situation. Instead, the crime/action sequence is regarded as a spectacle – inside, but also outside of the movie. This departs heavily from what we have in film and television nowadays, where the cities tend to be so ridden with crime that it has become the norm: where people do not even look up anymore when someone gets mugged, shot, stabbed, anything. And this fits in very well with the outsider perspective of Amsterdam as a quiet, cute, adorable and relaxing place.\n\nThere are a few decisive differences in the two films, but the main one, in my opinion, is the way the directors actually make use of the city. The chase scenes are extremely similar, but have a slightly different agenda that changes all. While Puppet on a Chain takes itself seriously, making use of the chase scene in a way that suspense is created especially in the interaction of the two men that is not technically part of the chase. The murderer lies in wait to shoot his chaser, and the chaser tries to sneak up to him to return the favour. Amsterdamned on the other hand does not take itself that seriously: director Dick Maas includes many humorous references in this scene, such as cameo appearances of the film critic Simon van Collem or the award-winning director Bert Haanstra, who is directing a band on a boat, a reference to his film Fanfare whose theme song is also played there.\n\nThis illustrates well how a single scene, even if shot in almost exactly the same way, can have very different agendas and effects. The tongue-in-cheek humour that Dick Maas uses in Amsterdamned relies heavily on Dutch intertextuality and is therefore aimed explicitly at a Dutch instead of an international audience. As an outsider, you do not have access to this kind of cultural knowledge, which makes the scene a very different one from what it’s actually supposed to be. This phenomenon of Amsterdamned can be best summed up by Jaap Kooijman:\n\nAlthough AMSTERDAMNED also relies heavily on the often clichéd genre conventions of Hollywood, the film does not, however, disguise itself as American, but explicitly recognizes its local character, appropriating Hollywood within its own Dutch context, rather than trying to be a mere imitation of the American original. (Kooijman 190f.)\n\nWorks Cited:\n\nKooijman, Jaap, ‘Amsterdamned Global Village: A Cinematic Site of Karaoke Americanism’, in: Mind the Screen.
