        "text": "Please read an update of this analysis at: https://uglytruththailand.wordpress.com/ In this paper, in 2017, I wrote that the Thai military junta was in the process of changing their relationship with the monarchy after the death of Pumipon. Three years later, events have shown that things are more complicated. Firstly, the “National Strategy” turned out to be not so important because Prayut and his junta friends managed to fix the electoral rules and ensure that they stayed in power after the sham elections. Secondly, royalist military officers are attempting to uncouple the institution of the monarchy from the person of Wachiralongkorn. They are hoping that they can promote the importance of the monarchy while trying to ignore Wachiralongkorn.\n\nFor the last forty years the Thai ruling class has maintained its power through the Military, the Monarchy and occasionally by the use of an electoral system dominated by the money politics of business controlled political parties. The naked coercive power of the Military and other state institutions is complemented by the ideology of the Monarchy. This is achieved by imposing and socialising the belief among the population that the King is an all powerful god who is to be loved or at least feared. This belief is a complete myth, but at various times it has been effective in serving the interests of the conservative ruling elites."
