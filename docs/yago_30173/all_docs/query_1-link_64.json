S. birth certificate was Baby Songkla as his parents had to consult his uncle King Rama VII (Prajadhipok), who was the then head of the House of Chakri, to suggest a name for him.\n\nBhumibol was the only monarch to be born in the United States as at the time of his birth, his father was enrolled in a public health program at Harvard University.\n\nIn 1928, Bhumibol came to Thailand from the United States.\n\nIn September 1929, his father died of kidney failure when Bhumibol was less than 2 years old.\n\nWhen he was nine years old, his elder brother became king; however, they stayed in Switzerland, and a council took care of things back in Thailand.\n\nHe attended a school in Bangkok for a while, but then his mother took him and his siblings to Switzerland in 1933.\n\nHe became a Jazz enthusiast in 1942 and started playing saxophone when he was fourteen.\n\nApart from saxophone, he liked playing other instruments like the saxophone, clarinet, trumpet, guitar, and piano.\n\nHe learned music when he was young. At first, he only played classical music, but then he started playing jazz because he liked to make up his tunes.\n\nWhen he was 18, he started writing his music. He played with famous jazz musicians like Benny Goodman and Lionel Hampton.\n\nHe wrote 49 songs in his life, some were jazz and some were other types of music.\n\nIn his youth, Bhumibol had a great interest in firearms. He kept a carbine, a Sten gun, and two automatic pistols in his bedroom, and he and his elder brother, King Ananda Mahidol, often used the palace gardens for target practice.\n\nHe had a great interest in photography and was filled with enthusiasm when he was given a camera in 1934.\n\nThey visited Thailand for a short time in 1938. After the end of the Second World War, he returned to Thailand along with his family.\n\nHe studied science at the University of Lausanne but changed his major to law and politics when he came back to Thailand after World War II.\n\nOn 9 June 1946, he ascended the throne after his elder brother, Ananda Mahidol, died of a mysterious gunshot wound.\n\nHe went back to Switzerland before the official mourning period was over. His uncle was in charge until Bhumibol was ready to be king.\n\nIn the initial days of his tenure as the King of Thailand, he had no real political powers and was merely a ceremonial king.\n\nHis famous songs were Candlelight Blues, Love at Sundown, and Falling Rain, which he wrote in 1946.\n\nOn 4 October 1948, he lost vision in his right eye when he met an accident while driving a Fiat Topolino on the Geneva-Lausanne road.\n\nHe was the 9th monarch of Thailand and was considered as world’s longest-serving head of state (from 9 June 1946 to 13 October 2016).\n\nIn 1950, he met his future wife Mom Rajawongse Sirikit Kitiyakara in Paris who was the daughter of a Thai Ambassador to France.\n\nHis coronation took place at the Royal Palace in Bangkok on 5 May 1950, when he became the Crowned King of Thailand.\n\nDuring his reign, there were big changes took place in Thailand’s government and the role of its king.\n\nBhumibol rarely revoked legislation, but on occasion, such as in 1954 and 1976, he refused to sign laws passed by Parliament.\n\nHe worked with musician Benny Goodman in Thailand in 1956 and even went to play at Goodman’s home in New York in 1960.\n\nIn 1957, the military of Thailand led by Field Marshal Plaek Phibunsongkhram took over the rule of the country from the government and accused them of various wrongdoings.\n\nThis event changed how the king and the military should work together, with some thinking the king supported the military’s harsh actions.\n\nAt the start of his reign, King Bhumibol did not have much power because Thailand was ruled by a military leader named Plaek Phibunsongkhram.\n\nIn 1957, another military leader, General Sarit Thanarat, accused Phibunsongkhram of disrespecting the king. This led to Sarit seizing power with the king’s support, and he imposed martial law.\n\nDuring Sarit’s rule, the king’s influence grew, and traditional ceremonies associated with the monarchy were restored.\n\nAfter Sarit’s death, General Thanom Kittikachorn took over the power.\n\nOne of his biographies titled The Devil’s Discus (1964) is available in Thai and English.\n\nBhumibol loved sailing. He won a gold medal in a sailing competition in 1967. He sailed across the Gulf of Thailand in a small boat he built himself.\n\nIn 1973, some protests against his regime turned violent, and the king intervened, leading to Thanom’s resignation.\n\nAfter that, the situation worsened, and the king supported a military coup in 1977, which was followed by a crackdown on disagreement.\n\nDuring these political changes, the role of the Thai king shifted, sometimes associating with the military and at other times, trying to maintain neutrality.\n\nThe lèse-majesté laws are supposed to apply to current kings. However, these laws still protected him even after his demise.\n\nThe laws ‘lèse-majesté’ became stricter after the Thammasat University Massacre in 1976, when the country was under the rule of a leader named Thanin Kraivichien, who supported the monarchy and was against communism.\n\nUnder these laws, Thai citizens were not allowed to criticize any member of the royal family, royal projects, the royal institution, the Chakri Dynasty, or any past king.\n\nIn 1979, during an interview with the BBC, the king said that the monarchy should stay neutral and get along with everyone peacefully.\n\nIn 1980, General Prem Tinsulanonda became the leader of Thailand after General Kriangsak.\n\nIn 1981 and 1985, there were attempted military coups which the king refused to support.\n\nBy 1989, the king became the world’s longest-reigning living monarch after the Emperor of Japan passed away.\n\nSome academics noted Bhumibol’s indirect political involvement through a “network monarchy,” with Privy Council President Prem Tinsulanonda.\n\nThis network was said to have established political influence in the 1990s and utilized benefits like the judiciary to exercise extra-constitutional powers.\n\nIn 1991, General Suchinda Kraprayoon, a coup, became prime minister. This caused protests in Thailand and the event was named Black May as it led to many deaths.\n\nIn 1992, Thailand faced a crisis during its move towards democracy.\n\nAmid increasing violence, the king intervened and brought both sides together. He urged for peace.\n\nAfter that Suchinda resigned, and a civilian government was formed.\n\nHe was inspired by famous jazz musicians like Louis Armstrong and Benny Carter.\n\nSome of his music is kept at the Library of Congress. Bhumibol learned music while he was in Switzerland, and when he came back to Thailand, he started a band called Lay Kram.\n\nHe was also a radio enthusiast and had a radio station at his palace where he played with his band. He used to play music at universities and wrote songs for some of them.\n\nBhumibol played a key role in 1992, in the transition of Thailand to a democratic system.\n\nHe liked designing boats. He made different kinds of sailboats and got patents for some inventions like the machine that cleans water.\n\nBhumibol was the only monarch of Thailand who held a patent. In 1993, he obtained a patent for a wastewater aerator named ‘Chai Pattana.’\n\nIn 1999, he was granted a patent for his ‘sandwich’ rainmaking technique and the ‘supersandwich’ patent in 2003.\n\nDuring his reign as the King of Thailand, he was served by 30 Prime Ministers.\n\nHe liked painting, composing songs, and doing photography in his leisure time.\n\nHe was an author and translator who wrote the book Phra Mahachanok, based on a traditional Jataka story of Buddhist scripture. He also wrote the book The Story of Thong Daeng, which was about his dog, Thong Daeng.\n\nIn 2005, during his birthday speech, Bhumibol said that people could criticize him. He said that it was okay to point out when he made mistakes because it helped him improve.\n\nHe believed that kings could make mistakes because they were human, like everyone else. However, after this statement, he faced many criticisms, and the number of people being prosecuted for criticizing the king increased.\n\nTwo English-language books provide extensive detail about Bhumibol’s life, especially his early years and his entire reign. The Revolutionary King (2001) by William Stevenson and The King Never Smiles (2006) by Paul M. Handley are these two books.\n\nThe biography, “The Revolutionary King,” was written by William Stevenson in 2001. Stevenson had access to the royal court and family. Some people said Bhumibol suggested the idea for the book. Bhumibol supported the book, but it was not officially allowed in Thailand. The Bureau of the Royal Household warned the media not to talk about it.\n\nPeople criticized the book “The Revolutionary King” for sharing wrong facts and not showing respect to Bhumibol (it called him by his nickname “Lek”), and suggesting a strange theory about the death of King Ananda. Stevenson said Bhumibol warned him that the book could be dangerous for both of them.\n\nBhumibol was a creative person who excelled in music, art, and invention.\n\nAfter disputed elections, the king called for new ones as allegations of a plot against the king emerged. The king urged the judiciary to resolve the crisis, and new elections were held.\n\nHe had the authority to pardon criminals. The pardoning of convicted child rapists in 2006 sparked controversy.\n\nOn the evening of 19 September 2006, the Thai military took over Bangkok and cancelled the upcoming elections. It banned protests and political meetings.\n\nThey accused the former prime minister, Thaksin, of various crimes, including disrespecting the monarchy. They said they were loyal to King Bhumibol.\n\nAfter that, the king’s role in the coup was widely speculated upon, but discussing it was banned in Thailand.\n\nAfter the coup, the military dissolved political parties and banned their leaders from politics.\n\nLater, the military tried to use the king’s image to gain support for their new constitution.\n\nBhumibol faced various health issues over the years. In July 2006, he underwent surgery for lumbar spinal stenosis.\n\nIn October 2007, he was hospitalized for a blood shortage in his brain. He also received treatment for heart problems and other ailments.\n\nIn 2008, there was another political crisis, and the king appointed people involved in past coups to key positions.\n\nIn September 2009, he was hospitalized again for flu and pneumonia. It was revealed in 2011 that he also suffered from Parkinson’s disease and depression.\n\nHe was diagnosed with diverticulitis in November 2011 and treated for minute subdural bleeding in his brain in July 2012.\n\nIn 2012, the government of Abhisit Vejjajiva made a two-minute-long documentary about his creativity, which was screened at all branches of the Major Cineplex Group and SF Cinema City, the two largest cinema chains in Thailand.\n\nIn 2013-2014, there was another coup, and the king officially appointed the military leader to run the country.\n\nSome experts believe that the monarchy has played a role in damaging democracy in Thailand by supporting military coups.\n\nHis health continued to deteriorate, and he faced kidney failure requiring dialysis by October 2016. He was placed on a ventilator, and his condition was described as unstable.\n\nDuring this time, concerns about succession arose, as Crown Prince Vajiralongkorn was less respected than his father.\n\nSome people speculated that Princess Maha Chakri Sirindhorn might be positioned to take the throne due to her popularity among the people.\n\nOn 13 October 2016, his death was announced by the royal palace. On 14 October, his body was taken in a motorcade to the Grand Palace for a traditional bathing ceremony.\n\nAfter that, the royal procession arrived at the Grand Palace, where Crown Prince Maha Vajiralongkorn, his son and heir, supervised the bathing ritual.\n\nA royal cremation ceremony took place over five days at the end of October 2016. The cremation, which was not aired on television, occurred on the evening of 26 October 2016.\n\nAfter cremation, his ashes were placed at various locations, including the Chakri Maha Phasat Throne Hall, the Royal Cemetery at Wat Ratchabophit, and the Wat Bowonniwet Vihara Royal Temple.\n\nThe mourning period officially ended at midnight on 30 October 2016, after which Thais resumed wearing regular clothing. They then awaited the future coronation of King Vajiralongkorn, which took place between 4-6 May 2019.\n\nDuring his rule, Bhumibol imposed power in Thailand, partly due to his huge popularity and sometimes vague interpretation of his powers drafted in the Thai constitution. For instance, a controversy arose in Thailand after the appointment of Jaruvan Maintaka as Auditor-General."
