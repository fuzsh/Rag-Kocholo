In 1917, she was granted a scholarship provided by Prince Mahidol and went to the United States to continue her studies. There she met Mahidol and married him in 1919. She helped her husband reform health care in Thailand.\n\nIn 1929, Prince Mahidol died of chronic health problems. Upon Mahidol's death, his widow continued to provide scholarships to medial students and supplemented the salary of young medical specialists. She also continued to play a significant role in the field of nursing. Srinagarindra build nursing schools, established the Thailand Nursing Association and organized the first nursing convention in the country.\n\nTo recognize Srinagarindra's contributions, her birthday was officially designated as National Nurses' Day."
