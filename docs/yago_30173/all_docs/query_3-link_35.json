        "text": "Launching JPOD @ Philadelphia: Accelerating Health-Care Innovation at Pennovation Center\n\nOn November 1, Penn President Amy Gutmann and EVP Craig Carnaroli welcomed Johnson & Johnson executives, including William Hait, global head, external innovation, as well as Philadelphia Mayor Jim Kenney, venture capitalists, entrepreneurs and other guests to the grand opening celebration of JPOD @ Philadelphia. J&J’s new innovation accelerator hub is the first of its kind in the world and is located at Penn’s Pennovation Center. Innovation is a central pillar in President Gutmann’s Penn Compact 2020. She said we can only imagine the future breakthroughs that will come out of this partnership. The hope is “to advance knowledge for good in the world,” she said.\n\nThere were 90-second pitches from the seven new JPOD @ Philadelphia resident companies who presented on their technologies and why they are excited about being part of this collaborative ecosystem. Several of these companies have Penn connections: Some are leveraging nanotechnology developed at Penn, some have Penn faculty as advisors and others include Penn alumni.\n\nThere was also a panel discussion on the Future of HealthTech.\n\nJPOD is a collaboration between Penn, Johnson & Johnson Innovation, and JLABS that offers resident companies and innovators training, mentoring and networking programs to equip them with a mix of resources to enable their success. JPOD @ Philadelphia will serve as a regional resource, amplifying Philadelphia’s innovation ecosystem. JPOD taps into the existing nexus of science, laboratory and entrepreneurial efforts taking place at the Pennovation Works and the region’s life sciences community to accelerate health-care innovation. The JPOD is a networking hub, which includes a secure telecommunications conferencing system to connect regional innovators to the J&J Innovation network. The goal is to identify and accelerate the development of early-stage health-care solutions from the life science ecosystem that address significant unmet patient and consumer needs in medical devices, pharmaceuticals, consumer and health technologies. The JPOD will support those innovators with training, mentoring and networking programs designed to equip them with a mix of resources.\n\nNew Penn Medicine Center: Bringing Immunotherapy Research to Brain Tumor Treatment\n\nPenn Medicine announced the newest Translational Center of Excellence (TCE) in the Abramson Cancer Center, which will be focused on Glioblastoma Multiforme, the most common and lethal form of brain cancer. The team will investigate new immune therapies for glioblastoma and, in particular, design and test new CAR T cell therapies. This involves engineering patients’ T cells (the cells that act on behalf of the immune system) to attack tumor cells. The world’s first gene-based cancer therapy, immunotherapy—or CAR T cell therapy—was pioneered at Penn Medicine, and it became the nation’s first FDA-approved personalized cellular therapy for cancer in August 2017 (Almanac September 12, 2017).\n\nRoughly 15,000 people are diagnosed with glioblastoma each year, with a median survival rate of only 15 months. It has recently been in the news with regard to Senator John McCain, who died 13 months after his glioblastoma diagnosis (Almanac September 11, 2018). Penn Medicine is on the frontlines in the fight against brain tumors like glioblastoma, with the Penn Brain Tumor Center performing the most brain tumor surgeries in Pennsylvania.\n\n“Penn Medicine is at the cutting-edge of research and clinical care for patients with glioblastoma, and our TCE will help accelerate this mission-critical work,” said Donald M. O’Rourke, John Templeton, Jr., MD Associate Professor in Neurosurgery in the Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania. “Immunotherapy is a game-changer for aggressive forms of cancer, and Penn is the only institution in the United States researching this kind of combined CAR T and checkpoint inhibitor therapy for glioblastoma right now.”\n\nThe TCE, a partnership of the Abramson Cancer Center and the department of neurosurgery, is led by Dr. O’Rourke and brings together multidisciplinary teams across Penn, including investigators from pathology and laboratory medicine, systems pharmacology and translational medicine, medicine, neurosurgery, radiation oncology, and medicine and pathobiology at the School of Veterinary Medicine.\n\nIn addition to novel treatment options like immunotherapy, the Abramson Cancer Center and Penn Brain Tumor Center have a full arsenal of medical and surgical approaches for treating glioblastoma, including more traditional methods such as radiation therapy, chemotherapy and surgical resection, as well as new innovations such as TumorGlow and proton therapy.\n\n“The real cutting-edge breakthroughs are coming from immunotherapy,” said M. Sean Grady, chairman of the department of neurosurgery. “Getting to a cure is going to be difficult, there is no way around that. However, in the 32 years I have been a neurosurgeon, this is the first time I’ve thought ‘Yes, we can actually beat brain cancer.’”\n\nStatement from the Alice Paul Center and Gender, Sexuality and Women’s Studies Program\n\nDear Members of the University of Pennsylvania Community:\n\nOn October 21, 2018, The New York Times published an article that describes a leaked memo from the Trump Administration that aims to define “gender as a biological, immutable condition determined by genitalia at birth.”\n\nThe effort, spearheaded by the Department of Health and Human Services, is the latest in a long series of attacks upon LGBTQ communities in the US and around the world. The most recent move from the Trump Administration, however, is one that seeks to erase an entire population. As scholars of gender and sexuality, as professors of transgender students, and as members of this University community, we cannot stay silent.\n\nWe cannot stay silent because we know that our students, who identify as trans, as non-binary, as gender-queer, are in need of our support and solidarity. Title IX, which is the specific target of the Administration’s memo, was enacted to ensure that all university students, regardless of gender, are able to receive an education free from discrimination. We intend to help keep that promise by supporting all students, and particularly those who identify outside of the gender binary, in whatever ways we can.\n\nWe cannot stay silent because we know that already vulnerable members of the transgender community now find themselves at increasing risk. As Penn alum and trans scholar C. Riley Snorton puts it succinctly: “Trans people existed before state recognition, but this latest federal proposal...will intensify the relationship between transness and premature death for the most vulnerable among us, in prisons, hospitals, schools and homeless shelters.”\n\nMoreover, we cannot stay silent when decades of gender and sexuality scholarship, together with medical expertise and our own lived experiences, have taught us that a reinforced naturalized gender binary harms everyone.\n\nWe hope you will join the Alice Paul Center and the Gender, Sexuality and Women’s Studies Program in speaking out strongly against this injustice and working actively to mitigate its effects.\n\n—Kathleen M. Brown, David Boies Professor of History\n\nDirector, Alice Paul Center and Gender, Sexuality and Women’s Studies Program\n\n—Anne Esacove, Associate Director, Alice Paul Center for Research on Gender, Sexuality and Women\n\n—Gwendolyn Beetham, Associate Director, Gender, Sexuality and Women’s Studies Program\n\nFor support: LGBT Center at Penn (215) 898-5044, Trans Lifeline (877) 565-8860\n\nReport of the Ad Hoc Consultative Committee for the Selection of a Dean of the School of Veterinary Medicine\n\nThe Ad Hoc Consultative Committee for the Selection of a Dean of the School of Veterinary Medicine was convened by President Amy Gutmann on September 7, 2017. During its three months of work, the full Committee met on nine occasions and reported its recommendations to the President on December 5, 2017. The Committee members were:\n\nChair: Steven J. Fluharty, Dean and Thomas S. Gates, Jr. Professor of Psychology, Pharmacology, and Neuroscience, SAS\n\nFaculty: Marisa Bartolomei, Professor of Cell and Developmental Biology, PSOM\n\nDe’Broski Herbert, Associate Professor of Pathobiology, Vet\n\nOlena Jacenko, Professor of Biochemistry and Associate Dean of Faculty Affairs and Diversity, Vet\n\nChristopher Lengner, Associate Professor, Department of Biomedical Sciences, Vet\n\nPhillip Scott, Professor of Microbiology and Immunology and Vice Dean for Research and Academic Resources, Vet\n\nDeborah Silverstein, Associate Professor, Department of Clinical Studies Philadelphia, Vet\n\nLouise Southwood, Associate Professor, Department of Clinical Studies New Bolton Center, Vet\n\nStudents: Stefan Gallini (V’20)\n\nEmma Price (V’19)\n\nAlumni: Mindy Heyer, Chair of Penn Vet Board of Overseers\n\nJuan Luis Ferrer Perez, Penn Vet Overseer\n\nEx Officio: Joann Mitchell, Senior Vice President for Institutional Affairs and Chief Diversity Officer\n\nThe search was supported by Adam P. Michaels, Deputy Chief of Staff in the President’s Office and Philip Jaeger, Gregory Esposito and Sherlene Parsons of the executive search firm Isaacson, Miller.\n\nThe Committee and its consultants conducted informational interviews and consultative meetings with individuals and groups throughout the Penn and Penn Vet communities, as well as many informal contacts, in order to better understand the scope, expectations and challenges of the Dean’s position and the opportunities facing the University in the years ahead. These consultative activities included full Committee meetings with Dean Joan C. Hendricks and members of the Penn Vet leadership team, including the vice and associate deans and department chairs. In addition, the Chair and the Committee members held open meetings for faculty, staff and students on both campuses. The consultants interviewed administrators from the central administration and from Penn Vet and sought nominations from academics and practitioners across the nation and the world as well as from leaders in government, foundations, academic societies and other organizations. Finally, members of the Committee engaged in extensive networking with Penn faculty and students, as well as colleagues at other institutions. The Committee also solicited advice and nominations from all Penn Vet faculty, Deans and senior administrators via email and reviewed a variety of documents about the school.\n\nBased upon these conversations and materials, the Committee’s charge from the President and the Committee’s own discussions, a comprehensive document was prepared outlining the scope of the position and the challenges a new Dean will face, as well as the qualities sought in a new Dean. The vacancy was announced (and input invited from the entire Penn community) in Almanac (Almanac September 19, 2017).\n\nOver the course of its three-month search process, the Committee and its consultants contacted and considered more than 140 individuals for the position. From this group, the committee evaluated an initial pool of 25 nominees and applicants and ultimately selected eight individuals for semi-finalist interviews with the entire Committee. Based on voluntary self-identifications and other sources, we believe the initial pool of 25 contained eight women and 17 men, and one person of color. The five individuals recommended for consideration to the President included one woman and were selected from this group of eight semi-finalists.\n\nOn February 28, 2018, President Gutmann and Provost Pritchett announced the selection of Dr. Andrew Hoffman as Dean of Penn Vet. Dr. Hoffman is an acclaimed researcher, clinician, teacher and mentor who previously served as director of the Regenerative Medicine Laboratory and professor of large animal internal medicine at Cummings School of Veterinary Medicine at Tufts University. He assumed his office on August 1, 2018 after ratification by the Trustees at their June meeting.\n\n—Steven J. Fluharty, Dean and Thomas S. Gates, Jr. Professor of Psychology, Pharmacology and Neurosciences, School of Arts and Sciences Chair, Consultative Committee on the Selection of a Dean of the School of Veterinary Medicine\n\nPenn Medicine and Wharton: Launching Executive Health Care Leadership Program\n\nLessons in organizational change management, team-building and negotiation are on the agenda in a new program designed to fortify leaders in academic medicine and health care for success in an uncertain environment for the field. Penn Medicine and Wharton Executive Education at the Wharton School are joining forces to launch an executive health care leadership program that will offer participants a strategic toolkit to cement their ability to lead at a time when science, technology and economics are reshaping the practice of medicine and altering the field’s economic landscape.\n\nThe program, known as Leadership in a New Era of Health Care, is designed for senior-level leaders in health care and academic medicine—doctors, nurses, scientists and executives—from across the world. Beginning with its first four-day course in March 2019, the program will provide participants with targeted leadership development experiences and practical skills to drive visionary change in their organizations.\n\n“A commitment to innovation is at the core of everything we do at Penn Medicine, and we’re dedicated to instilling that same passion for improvement and evolution in our approach to leadership,” said J. Larry Jameson, executive vice president of the University of Pennsylvania for the Health System and dean of Penn’s Perelman School of Medicine. “Health-care leaders today need a broader skill set: They must be strong negotiators, keen students of business and have the emotional intelligence necessary to lead diverse teams who are evolving our approaches to patient-centric care and ensuring that our health systems continue to thrive in an era of some uncertainty for our field.”\n\nLeadership in a New Era of Health Care will be led by faculty from both Wharton and Penn Medicine. Presenters will include deans and CEOs from the nation’s top academic medical centers, chairs of large clinical departments, nursing leaders and senior executives who have built dynamic academic-industry partnerships and overseen transformative new facility projects. Participants will also learn from renowned experts in organizational development and conflict resolution.\n\n“Wharton Executive Education excels at providing a holistic approach to leadership development,” said professor Jagmohan S. Raju, vice dean of Wharton Executive Education. “The US spends more than 18% of its GDP on health care and nearly one in every eight Americans are employed in this sector. Today’s health-care sector requires leaders who are interdisciplinary thinkers with the capability to envision the future, and this program is going to help them do just that.”\n\nParticipants will have the opportunity to develop advanced leadership skills through a combination of interactive workshops and dynamic presentations. Areas of focus will include organizational and cultural change, negotiation and conflict resolution, relationship management, coalition-building, communication and strategic decision-making. The program is also designed to support quick-start change management. Through a unique, real-time health-care challenge, participants will get feedback from peers and faculty to help tackle their most pressing on the job issues and be prepared to initiate new plans when they return to their institutions.\n\n“We need to help our health-care leaders stay agile and build their capacity to pivot and respond strategically to changes in the field, from new digital health advances to changes in reimbursement,” said Caryn Lerman, vice dean for Strategic Initiatives in the Perelman School of Medicine and John H. Glick Professor in Cancer Research. “Today’s academic medicine leaders and health-care executives are highly knowledgeable and motivated. We’ve designed this program to leverage those qualities and arm them with the high-impact skills required to drive real change in the organizations they lead.”\n\nThe program builds on ideas Dr. Lerman and Dr. Jameson outlined in the New England Journal of Medicine in June 2018, when they called on academic health systems to make leadership development an organizational priority – an emphasis that they say will also pay off in improved patient satisfaction and clinical outcomes.\n\nFor more information, visit WhartonPennMedLeadership.com\n\nLucy Hackney, Children’s Advocate\n\nLucy Judkins Durr Hackney, wife of Penn President Emeritus Sheldon Hackney, died October 26, at her home in Vineyard Haven, Massachussetts, following a prolonged period of declining health. She was 81.\n\nMrs. Hackney was born in Montgomery, Alabama, to prominent civil rights activists. Her father was one of the attorneys who helped Rosa Parks make bail after she was arrested for refusing to leave her seat on a Montgomery bus. Mrs. Parks was a family friend and also a talented seamstress who helped with the alterations on Lucy Hackney’s wedding dress. Mrs. Hackney’s uncle, US Supreme Court Justice Hugo Black, took part in the Brown v. Board of Education decision to end racial segregation in public schools.\n\nLucy Durr met Sheldon Hackney in high school and later left college to marry him. After having three children, she returned to school to earn her bachelor’s degree from Princeton and a law degree from Tulane. Ms. Hackney was a board member for the Children’s Defense Fund and served as a Juvenile Law Center staff attorney. In the early 1990s, she founded the Pennsylvania Partnership for Children, a broad-based advocacy center for children, and she served as the PPC board chair for many years. She was also a strong supporter of Camp Jabberwocky, where her daughter, Virginia, had been a camper.\n\nDuring her husband’s tenure at Penn, she was very involved on campus. She served on the 1988 President’s Forum Committee to address the futures of children; she led a session during the 1990 Peak Week on child health at CHOP; and gave talks on other topics such as the Handicapped Act. She interviewed Sadie Alexander and Margaret Wettlin for the Women’s Oral History Project, which documented the experiences of over 100 prominent female University of Pennsylvania students, administrators, faculty and faculty family members; both taped interviews are held in the University Archives.\n\nIn 1993, when her husband retired from his position as Penn President (he later came back as a professor of history, as he was a noted historian of the American South), the Sheldon and Lucy Hackney Professorship in History was created by the Trustees in honor of their many years of dedicated service to Penn. Appointees have included Thomas Childers, Michael Katz and most recently Warren Breckman (Almanac February 20, 2018). At the 1993 Commencement ceremony, Mrs. Hackney was also awarded an honorary doctor of laws degree by the University (Almanac May 18, 1993).\n\nIn 2001, Mrs. Hackney was named a Distinguished Daughter of Pennsylvania, an award that recognized “her efforts [that] resulted in health coverage for 100,000 previously uninsured young people in the Commonwealth. As staff attorney at the Juvenile Law Center, she was tenacious in her work on behalf of numerous children’s health, welfare and justice programs. She also had been active on the boards of numerous regional, state-wide and national educational institutions.”\n\nThe Hackneys moved to Martha’s Vineyard after Dr. Hackney retired from Penn. He died in 2013 (Almanac September 24, 2013). Mrs. Hackney is survived by a son, Fain, and daughter, Elizabeth McBride.\n\nFrom the Senate Office: Faculty Senate Executive Committee Actions\n\nThe following is published in accordance with the Faculty Senate Rules. Among other purposes, the publication of SEC actions is intended to stimulate discussion among the constituencies and their representatives. Please communicate your comments to Patrick Walsh, executive assistant to the Senate Office, either by telephone at (215) 898-6943 or by email at senate@pobox.upenn.edu\n\nFaculty Senate Executive Committee Actions\n\nWednesday, October 31, 2018\n\nChair’s Report. Faculty Senate Chair Jennifer Pinto-Martin reported that the Senate is in early planning stages for a Mini Teach-In during Spring 2019 that will follow on the successful Knowledge Teach-In held in March 2018. The Mini Teach-In will comprise one session at a public, off-campus location in which members of the Philadelphia community will be encouraged to engage with Penn faculty, students and staff. Faculty interested in helping to plan this event are encouraged to contact the Senate Office.\n\nPast Chair’s Report. Past Chair Santosh Venkatesh reported on the work of the Capital Council. Professor Venkatesh will deliver a more in-depth report on Penn’s annual budget planning effort at a future SEC meeting.\n\n2018 Senate Nominating Committee. SEC members voted to adopt a membership slate for the 2018 Senate Nominating Committee. The slate will be published in a future issue of Almanac for comment by Standing Faculty members.\n\nModerated Discussion. Two topics were identified for focused attention by the SEC throughout the remainder of the year. On the first topic of improving Penn’s academic diversity pipeline, SEC members agreed to assemble a set of best practices that can be shared with Penn schools and departments, and to consider ways these practices could be implemented and tested at Penn. On the second topic of improving Penn’s faculty climate, SEC members discussed factors that may lead faculty to feel undervalued in their work at Penn. They also discussed initiatives at peer institutions that could serve as models for data collection on climate-related factors.\n\nWellness at Penn. Vice President for Public Safety Maureen Rush and Chief Wellness Officer Benoit Dubé provided a number of updates on wellness and security at Penn:\n\n(1) The Department of Public Safety has been working closely with Jewish centers and groups on campus, as well as other places of worship at Penn, to ensure security in the aftermath of the synagogue shooting in Pittsburgh on October 27.\n\n(2) Penn community members are encouraged to contact Public Safety (by calling 511 or 911) to report any suspicious activity they observe.\n\n(3) Public Safety runs a federal liaison vetting program for any persons from federal or state investigatory agencies wishing to speak with faculty members in an official capacity.\n\n(4) A pilot program of the Medical Emergency Response Team known as the Alternative Response Unit was launched this fall; the program is staffed by Penn paramedical staff who provide on-site medical assistance between 5 p.m. and 3 a.m., Wednesdays through Sundays. To encourage students to call in emergency situations, no bill is sent to students or their families. The University’s Office of Alcohol and Other Drugs follows up with students who are treated for alcohol- or drug-related poisoning and offers to connect the student with counseling.\n\n(5) To increase access to mental health services by students in crisis, students may now reach a licensed counselor 24 hours per day, 7 days per week, at Counseling and Psychological Services (CAPS) by phoning 898-HELP and pressing 1. If a student calls when CAPS is closed, the counselor will work with the student to address the situation and, if needed, will transfer the student to the care of a CAPS counselor when CAPS reopens.\n\n(6) A platform for students—the Student Wellness Advisory Group (SWAG)—will be created to supplement existing student committees and resource groups. SWAG will be comprised of 10-15 students ambassadors from representative groups including, but not limited to, the LGBT Center, the United Minorities Coalition and the Women’s Center. Similar groups of faculty and staff will also be convened, although planning for these groups is still in the early stages.\n\n(7) A “big idea” contest will be launched in January to crowd-source novel wellness initiatives at Penn.\n\nPrinciples of Responsible Conduct—A Reminder to the Penn Community\n\nThe Principles of Responsible Conduct promote the highest standards of integrity and ethics at Penn. To remind the Penn community of the basic expectations that should guide our work at Penn, the Principles of Responsible Conduct are published annually and are found below. Everyone at Penn is expected to be familiar with and adhere to the Principles of Responsible Conduct, which can be found on the Office of Audit, Compliance and Privacy website at: http://www.upenn.edu/audit/oacp_principles.htm\n\nThe mission of the University of Pennsylvania and its Health System is to offer a world-class education to our students, train future leaders, expand and advance research and knowledge, serve our community and society both at home and abroad, and provide the most expert and outstanding health care for our patients. In pursuing this mission, and to ensure the continued excellence of the University and its reputation, all members of the University community need to understand and uphold both legal requirements and the highest ethical standards.\n\nIn the following Principles of Responsible Conduct, we articulate the basic expectations that should guide each of us in our work at Penn. These Principles are embedded within many policies and practices identified throughout University and Health System handbooks, manuals, websites and other materials. We have endeavored to distill these policies, rules and guidelines for easy review and access. The Principles are not intended to be a comprehensive catalogue of all applicable rules and policies of the University and the Health System. Rather, these Principles set forth the underlying expectations that we have for the conduct of University and Health System activities with the highest standards of integrity and ethics. Useful references to relevant policies and resources are included.\n\nWe urge you to read these Principles closely and familiarize yourself with both the expectations and the resources provided.\n\n—Amy Gutmann, President\n\n—Wendell Pritchett, Provost\n\n—Craig Carnaroli, Executive Vice President\n\n—J. Larry Jameson, Executive Vice President of the University for the Health System and Dean of the Perelman School of Medicine\n\nPenn has many policies that govern the behavior of all Penn faculty, administration and staff. The ethical expectations contained in these policies are highlighted in the text of the ten principles that follow, and supporting policies, statements and guidelines are available for each at the corresponding web link.\n\nPrinciples of Responsible Conduct\n\n1. Ethical and Responsible Conduct. Penn’s faculty, administration and staff should conduct themselves ethically, with the highest integrity, in compliance with all applicable laws, regulations and University policies, in all aspects of their work. They should be fair and principled in University and Health System business transactions and other related professional activities, acting in good faith when dealing with both internal constituents and external entities.

Avoidance of Conflict of Interest. As more fully stated in Penn’s conflict of interest policies, Penn’s faculty, administration and staff should avoid conflicts of interest in work at Penn. As a non-profit institution, it is imperative, for both legal and ethical reasons, that University and Health System employees do not improperly benefit from their positions of trust at Penn. Financial conflicts must be appropriately disclosed in accordance with conflict of interest and conflict of commitment policies, so that they can be reviewed, and as appropriate, managed or eliminated. Faculty, administrators and staff are responsible for identifying potential conflicts and seeking appropriate guidance.\n\nhttp://www.upenn.edu/audit/oacp_principles3.htm\n\n4. Responsible Conduct in Research. As members of a complex research university, Penn faculty, administrators and staff have significant responsibility to ensure that research is conducted with the highest integrity, and in compliance with federal, state, and local laws and regulations, as well as University and Health System policy.\n\nhttp://www.upenn.edu/audit/oacp_principles4.htm\n\n5. Responsible Stewardship and Use of Penn Property, Funds and Technology. Penn faculty, administration and staff are expected to ensure that Penn property, funds and technology are used appropriately to benefit the institution, consistent with all legal requirements as well as University and Health System policies.\n\nhttp://www.upenn.edu/audit/oacp_principles5.htm\n\n6. Environmental Health and Safety. Penn is committed to the protection of the health and safety of the University community and the creation of a safe working environment. To accomplish this end, Penn provides training in health and safety regulation and policy, and Penn faculty, administration and staff are expected to comply with sound practices and legal requirements.\n\nhttp://www.upenn.edu/audit/oacp_principles6.htm\n\n7. Respect for Privacy and Confidentiality. In their various roles and positions at Penn, faculty, administration and staff become aware of confidential information of many different types. Such information may relate to students, employees, faculty, staff, alumni, donors, research sponsors, licensing partners, patients and others. Penn faculty, administration and staff are expected to inform themselves about applicable legal, contractual and policy obligations to maintain the confidentiality of such information, so as to protect it from improper disclosure and to protect the privacy interests of members of our community.\n\nhttp://www.upenn.edu/audit/oacp_principles7.htm\n\n8. Appropriate Conduct with Respect to Gifts, Travel and Entertainment. Penn faculty, administration and staff are expected to conduct themselves so as to ensure that their positions are not misused for private gain, with respect to acceptance of gifts and the undertaking of University-related travel and entertainment.\n\nhttp://www.upenn.edu/audit/oacp_principles8.htm\n\n9. Appropriate Use of the University Name and Logos.
