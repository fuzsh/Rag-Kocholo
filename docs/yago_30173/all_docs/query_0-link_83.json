        "meta_description": "Bhumibol was born at the Mount Auburn Hospital in Cambridge, Massachusetts, in the United States on 5 December 1927.[15] He was the youngest son of HRH Prince Mahidol Adulyadej, the Prince of Songkla, and his commoner wife Mom Sangwan (later HRH Princess Srinagarindra, the Princess Mother). His US birth certificate reads simply \"Baby Songkla\", as the parents had to consult his uncle, King Rama VII (Prajadhipok), then head of the House of Chakri, for an auspicious name. The king chose Bhumibol Adulyadej, meaning \"Strength of the Land, Incomparable Power\" (from Sanskrit भूमिबलः अतुल्यतेजस्). His father was enrolled in the Public Health program at Harvard University, hence his unusual place of birth for a Thai monarch. He is the only monarch to be born in the U.S.[16] Bhumibol had an elder sister, Princess Galyani Vadhana, and an elder brother, Prince Ananda Mahidol.\n\tBhumibol came to Thailand in 1928, after Prince Mahidol obtained a certificate from Harvard. The father died of kidney failure in September 1929, when Bhumibol was two years old.[17] He briefly attended Mater Dei school in Bangkok but in 1933 his mother took the family to Switzerland, where he continued his education at the Ecole Nouvelle de la Suisse Romande in Lausanne. In 1934 Bhumibol was given his first camera, which induced his lifelong enthusiasm for photography.[18] When Bhumibol's childless uncle Prajadhipok abdicated in 1935, his 9-year-old brother Ananda became the new King Rama VIII. However, the family stayed in Switzerland and the affairs of the head of state were conducted by a regency council. They returned to Thailand for only two months in 1938. In 1942, Bhumibol became a jazz enthusiast, and started to play the saxophone, a passion that he has kept throughout his life.[19] He received the baccalauréat des lettres (high-school diploma with major in French literature, Latin, and Greek) from the Gymnase Classique Cantonal of Lausanne, and by 1945 had begun studying science at the University of Lausanne, when World War II ended and the family returned to Thailand.[20]",
