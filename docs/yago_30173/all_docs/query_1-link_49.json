        "text": "Since 1959, His Majesty King Bhumibol Adulyadej The Great and Her Majesty Queen Sirikit had performed various royal duties as well as establishing relationship with Europe, USA, Australia and Asian countries. Having vast insights from visiting countless rural areas, the Royal Development Project was a direct result of his devotion to rural development and Thai people’s wellbeing..His Majesty had patronized over 2,000 projects, spanning various sectors such as medical care, public health, agriculture, irrigation, land development, education, Buddhism, culture, transportation and economy. All reflect his resolute commitment to his people. He also alleviated urban issues like traffic congestion, flooding, and water pollution. Moreover, he involved in social welfare initiatives and dedicated to preserving Thai elephants..Indeed, His Majesty’s dedication was unwavering. Even during his hospitalization, he continued working tirelessly to alleviate the suffering of his people. Even while working under the scorching sun, his sweat seemed to turn into a divine blessing, transforming arid lands into thriving ones..His Majesty’s Remarkable TalentHis Majesty’s profound love and dedication to his people are a shining example to the world. He had received numerous honorary degrees in recognition of his outstanding contributions across various fields. His musical talent is equally impressive; he composed 47 melodious songs from a young age, some of which have been performed both in Thailand and internationally, earning him an honorable membership from the Austria Music Academy..In addition to his musical achievements, His Majesty also displayed remarkable athleticism, earning a Gold medal in the Sea Games. He was honored as the “Great Artist” by his artistic prowess extended to paintings and literary works, many of which are treasured national assets. Notable among them is his translation of “A Man Called Intrepid” and his book, “The Story of Mahajanaka” which imparts valuable moral lessons on perseverance and tolerance, offering guidance to his people on their path to achieving their goals. His multifaceted talents and contributions continue to be a source of inspiration and pride for Thai people..In the Rattanakosin Bicentennial Celebration, His Majesty gave a royal guidance of four virtues to Thai people: - Be honest and sincere, committing to actions that bring about goodness and righteousness. - Be able to control oneself in order to do good.- Be patient, tolerant and careful in order to remain truthful in all circumstances.- Refrain from all forms of evil and corruption, and be willing to sacrifice for the benefit of others and the nation..If everyone maintains and develops these four virtues, our nation will be happy and peaceful, having stability and further progress.In remembrance of His Majesty King Bhumibol Adulyadej The Great, the “Father of Thailand” who had extended his greatest kindness, becoming our role model throughout 70 years of his reign, we would like to bring up his guidance and speeches as followings:\n\n“Unity is meant for the benefits of the nation. We have to do everything to strengthen the nation. This includes having sympathy for each other, performing duties with integrity, helping each other and not spoiling other’s work. We have to talk for better understanding. Be honest and serve for the interests of society as a whole.”“Whether our country is going to progress or decline, it depends on the people’s education. The result of today’s education will define the future of the nation. It’s the responsibility of you all. Therefore, as teachers, you have to fulfil your role.” Although His Majesty King Bhumibol Adulyadej The Great had passed for seven years, he is always in the hearts of all Thais. .."
