        "text": "\"Adulyadej\" and \"Rama IX\" redirect here. For his father, see Mahidol Adulyadej. For the ruler of Cochin, see Rama Varma IX.\n\nBhumibol Adulyadej[lower-alpha 4] (5 December 1927 – 13 October 2016), posthumously conferred with the title King Bhumibol the Great,[lower-alpha 5][2][3][4][5] was the ninth king of Thailand from the Chakri dynasty, titled Rama IX, from 1946 until his death in 2016. His reign of 70 years and 126 days is the longest of any Thai monarch, the longest of an independent Asian sovereign and the third longest verified reign of any monarch of a sovereign state in history after Louis XIV and Elizabeth II.[6][7]\n\nQuick Facts King of Thailand, Reign ...\n\nClose\n\nBorn in the United States, Bhumibol spent his early life in Switzerland, in the aftermath of the 1932 Siamese revolution which topped the centuries' old Thai absolute monarchy ruled by his uncle King Prajadhipok (Rama VII). He ascended to the throne in June 1946, following the death of his brother King Ananda Mahidol (Rama VIII), who died under mysterious circumstances. Bhumibol oversaw Thailand through the Cold War as an important US ally and oversaw the Thai economic boom of the late 20th century; between 1985 and 1994, Thailand was the world's fastest growing economy according to the World Bank[8] and many international journalists in the 1990s proclaimed Thailand as the next \"Asian Tiger\",[9] which ended due to the 1997 Asian financial crisis and Thai political instability since the 2000s.[9] Bhumibol's reign saw the emergence of a Thai urban middle class and the emergence of mass political participation in Thai electoral politics. Under Bhumibol's rule, between the 1940s and 2010s, Thailand experienced periods of gradual democratization accompanied by frequent military coups, the last of which occurred in 2014.\n\nForbes estimated Bhumibol's fortune—including property and investments managed by the Crown Property Bureau, a body that is neither private nor government-owned (assets managed by the Bureau were owned by the crown as an institution, not by the monarch as an individual)[10]—to be US$30 billion in 2010, and he headed the magazine's list of the \"world's richest royals\" from 2008 to 2013.[11][12][13] In 2014, Bhumibol's wealth was again listed as US$30 billion.[14]"
