        "text": "The important moments throughout the lifetime of Somdet Phra Srinagarindra Boromrajajonani, or the Princess Mother of Thailand, will be recounted in an exhibition that kicks off on Wednesday and runs until Oct 28 at the Lifestyle Hall, 2nd floor of Siam Paragon.\n\nHeld to mark her birthday anniversary, which falls on Oct 21, the 21st edition of the \"Remembering Of The Late Princess Mother\" exhibition will feature the theme \"Love And Fond\" to honour and recapture her grace that has made her a role model for the young generations.\n\nDivided into seven parts, the exhibition presents the important chapters in her life in a chronological order. It starts from her childhood to when she became a royal servant to Princess Valaya Alongkorn, daughter of King Rama V, and enrolled as a student at the Siriraj School for Midwifery and Nursing where she was selected to receive a scholarship to study nursing in the US. This is a major turning point in her life and her marriage to Prince Mahidol Adulyadej.\n\nVisitors will learn more about her life as a widow taking care of their two sons and a daughter after the passing of her husband, how she trained her children to be moral and responsible, and why she has been called \"Somdet Ya\" by all Thais.\n\nHer efforts to solve the poverty, increase incomes and improve the quality of life of the hill tribe people is also featured in the exhibition with the focus on her royally-initiated Mae Fah Luang Foundation and Doi Tung Development Project.\n\nThe last part recounts the day on June 9, 1970, where King Bhumibol Adulyadej royally granted her the title of HRH Princess Srinagarindra, the Princess Mother.\n\nBesides the exhibition, a number of quality products under the \"Doi Tung\" brand will be available for sale. Items include handicrafts, premium Arabica coffee and plants of various kinds from the Mae Fah Luang Garden.\n\nThere will also be a DIY terrarium workshop and on creating bookmarks from dried flowers. It will be held all day long everyday, free of charge."
