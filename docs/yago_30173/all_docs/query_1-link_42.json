        "text": "1. In commemoration of the 125th Anniversary of the Birth of HRH Prince Mahidol of Songkla and the 25th Anniversary of the Prince Mahidol Award 1\n\n2. The 1st of January marks the birthday anniversary of His Royal Highness Prince Mahidol of Songkla who is considered the Father of Modern Medicine in Thailand. More than 90 years ago, the Prince played an active role in laying foundations for public health and medical care in Thailand, with strong determination to raise the standard of living of all Thais. His life and work exemplify what we can do to help mankind and inspire people to give back to society. Celebrating its 25th anniversary this year, the Prince Mahidol Award was created to reward efforts to develop medicine and public health—fields which the Prince made significant contributions to in Thailand. Some of his outstanding contributions included providing scholarships to study abroad for Thai medical and nursing students, personal funds to develop the country’s first hospital—Siriraj Hospital—on par with hospitals in developed countries, and efforts to coordinate assistance from the Rockefeller Foundation to develop Thai medicine. These are just a small part of what the Prince achieved for the benefit of Thailand. Functioning without political affiliation, Prince Mahidol Award is a truly international award since it is given to individuals or institutions, regardless of race or nation. From 1992 to 2016, 74 individuals or institutions received the award for their beneficial accomplishments proven to improve lives across the world. “True success is not in the learning, but in its application to the benefit of mankind,” as His Royal Highness Prince Mahidol of Songkla reminded us, perfectly summing up what the prestigious Prince Mahidol Award represents. The legacy that the Prince left behind has had a great impact on public health and medicine in Thailand today. Let us carry on his legacy by doing good deeds and honouring those who work for the benefit of others to ensure a better, safer world. Her Royal Highness Princess Maha Chakri Sirindhorn Chairman, Board of Trustees and President, Prince Mahidol Award Foundation 2\n\n3. Prince Mahidol Aduladej served at the Navy Ministry in 1915. 125th Anniversary of His Royal Highness Prince Mahidol of Songkla His Legacy Continues On H is Royal Highness Prince Mahidol of Songkla was the 69th child of King Chulalongkorn and the 7th of Queen Savang Vadhana. The Prince was born on 1 January 1892 at the Grand Palace in Bangkok amidst significant changes in the Kingdom at a time when Thailand was in transition to keep up with developed countries. When he was young, the Prince’s health was not good, probably due to over-crowdedness and poor air ventilation in the Grand Palace. He was very thin and fell ill several times in his childhood. The Prince was sent to England to study at Harrow School in 1906 and to the Royal Prussian Military Preparatory College at Potsdam in Germany around a year later, following King Chulalongkorn’s wish to send his sons abroad to pursue their studies. The King intended them to return to Thailand to assume important positions in the government and contribute to their motherland. The Prince’s Early Life After the Royal Prussian Military Preparatory College at Potsdam, the Prince moved to Berlin to study at the Royal Prussian Military College, Gross Lichterfelde, before continuing his military education at the Imperial German Naval Academy at Flensburg- Mürwik following the wish of his half-brother, King Vajiravudh from 1911-1914. Since he was very young, the Prince was known for his down-to-earth attitude and benevolence. He gave a scholarship from his own money to a Thai student to study Medicine in Europe when he was less than 19 years old. Prince Mahidol of Songkla returned to Thailand in 1915 shortly after World War I erupted to a commission in the Royal Thai Navy. While serving in the navy, the Prince saw nutrition- related problems of naval officers and became interested in public health – the field he later pursued vigorously. Just 10 months after joining the navy, the Prince resigned due to a conflict with senior naval officers. Queen Savang Vadhana and her children.

P rince Mahidol of Songkla left the navy came to be interested in medicine and public health after Prince Rangsit, his half-brother who was close to him, invited him to observe Siriraj Hospital whose medical college was then supervised by Prince Rangsit. This medical college—the first one in Thailand—was still rudimentary and lacked proper infrastructure. When the Prince realised that the country was in dire need of knowledgeable personnel and funding for the development of medicine and public health, he was more determined to work in the fields and to raise the standard of life of Thai people. “Public health is of great importance. It enhances the quality of life in the country and brings the benefit to mankind.” Change of Course: From Naval Officer to Medical Doctor The Prince prepared himself for medicine and public health by studying them in depth. At first he went to the University of Edinburgh to study public health but later changed to Harvard Medical School, Harvard University in the United States. The Prince’s determination to raise the standard of life of people in Thailand – the main reason he decided to pursue medical study – was evidenced in an interview he gave a reporter while he was staying in Gloucester. “I think that the government’s budget should be spent for the benefit of the general public. I prefer building a hospital to a battleship. I have chosen to pursue my studies in public health because I think this field will open up opportunities for me to help people as much as possible.” 4\n\n5.

A t Harvard Medical School, Prince Mahidol of Songkla was laying out plans to support the affairs of Siriraj Hospital and its medical college while studying hard. One of his early contributions was a scholarship program for medical and nursing students – one of them Miss Sangwan Talabhat who was his future wife and mother of two future kings of Thailand – King Ananda Mahidol (Rama VIII) and King Bhumibol Adulyadej (Rama IX). The Prince and his wife had three children: • Her Royal Highness the late Princess Galyani Vadhana, Kromma Luang Naradhiwas Rajanagarindra (6 May 1923 – 2 January 2008) • His Majesty the late King Ananda Mahidol, King Rama VIII (20 September 1925 – 9 June 1946) • His Majesty the late King Bhumibol Adulyadej, King Rama IX (5 December 1927 – 13 October 2016) The Prince received a Certificate in Public Health in 1921 and graduated with a medical degree in 1928. After he returned to Thailand in 1928, he became active in the development of modern medicine and public health with an interest in the prevention of diseases which seriously affected Thailand at that time, including malaria, amoebic dysentery and pneumonia. The Prince was also the Director- General of the University Department under the Ministry of Education and taught basic sciences and medicine. Father of Modern Medicine and Public Health of Thailand The development of Siriraj Hospital was probably the Prince’s most prominent achievement. He sought support from and cooperation with the Rockefeller Foundation for the hospital and for the overall development of Thai medicine. The Prince even offered some of his private funds for the construction of new buildings on Siriraj Hospital’s grounds according to sketches he made himself. A huge amount of his personal funds went to scholarships and salaries of medical personnel. It was estimated that the total funds the Prince dedicated to the development of the country’s medicine and public health amounted to approximately 1.4 million baht at that time, equivalent to billions of baht today. In 1929, the Prince was suggested by Doctor Cort, the director of the missionary-run McCormick Hospital in Chiang Mai, to conduct research into the diseases and work as a resident doctor. At the hospital, the Prince worked tirelessly and even intended to donate his blood to patients who needed it. However, he spent only three weeks working at the hospital before returning to Sra Pathum Palace where his chronic kidney disease aggravated shortly afterwards. The Prince spent his last months at the palace but never stopped working for public health and medical affairs in the country. Prince Mahidol of Songkla passed away on 24 September 1929 at 37. 5\n\n6.

Prince Mahidol Award Youth Program P rince Mahidol of Songkla once said that “true success is not in the learning but in its application to the benefit of mankind.” This is what he strongly believed and put into practice throughout his life. To carry on the Prince’s altruism and legacy, the Prince Mahidol Award Foundation under the Royal Patronage initiated the Prince Mahidol Award (PMA) Youth Program on 20 November 2008. The programme is aimed at inspiring and facilitating young Thai medical students to pursue their studies abroad for the benefit of mankind, following the footsteps of Prince Mahidol of Songkla. Applicants qualifying for the scholarship should currently study in the 5th year of medical school at any university in Thailand, with the age of less than 30 years old. They must be proficient in English and able to spend one year abroad. Most importantly, they must have a determination to dedicate their life to solve pre-specified Thai health problems of interest. They should feel the need to obtain significant study/ research experience abroad that will help their work in the future. Each year, the programme’s steering committee, the working committee, andtheselectioncommitteewillselect up to five qualified applicants and nominate them for the scholarship. The Board of Trustee of the Prince Mahidol Award Foundation, chaired by Her Royal Highness Princess Maha Chakri Sirindhorn, will make a final decision. The successful candidates will be granted a scholarship for training or studying abroad with full support from the foundation for 12 months. Their training/studying period abroad is considered as a part of their three- year contract time after they graduate from a medical school. The PMA Youth Program scholars will be taken care of by the formally arranged international mentor once they start their training/study abroad. The scholars are required to send back their progress report every six months and after they complete their training/study. After they return to Thailand, they will present their projects at the PMA Youth Program Conference, scheduled to take place in January each year in parallel with the PMA Conference. Another invaluable benefit of the scholarship is lifetime mentoring from their international and Thai mentors with strong support from the working committee. 16\n\n17.
