        "text": "Here are a few more image from our river trip from The Grand Palace to our hotel. It is interesting to note that the Thai King at the time , Bhumibol was an avid photographer and in most of the images we saw of him when he was not in uniform, he had a Canon SLR around his neck (image #6). There was a pavilion at the Grand Palace built to display his images. An interesting short video can be found on the website: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQC5mMIYc2o\n\nKing Bhumibol Adulyadej, of Thailand, who sadly passed away last year (2016), was a man of many talents. As well as being a musician, an inventor, and inspiration to the people of Thailand for 70 years, he was also a very talented photographer.\n\nFor most of his adult life, whether visiting up country rural Thailand, or attending the most regal of royal events, he was rarely seen without carrying a camera.\n\nAs part of the country’s many events to mark the great King’s passing, is an exhibition of his photography, at the Bangkok Art and Cultural Centre. The exhibition contains around 200 of the King’s photographs, many of which have never been seen before. More information can be found from http://en.bacc.or.th/events/exhibitio...\n\nKing Bhumibol was born in the United States, on 5 December 1927. He was the youngest son of Prince Mahidol Adulyadej, the Prince of Songkla, and his commoner wife Mom Sangwan (later Princess Srinagarindra, the Princess Mother). His father was enrolled in the public health program at Harvard University. His father died of kidney failure in September 1929, when King Bhumibol was less than two years old. In 1933 his mother took her family to Switzerland, where he continued his education at the École nouvelle de la Suisse romande in Lausanne. In 1934 King Bhumibol was given his first camera, which ignited his lifelong enthusiasm for photography.\n\nWhile finishing his degree in Switzerland, King Bhumibol visited Paris frequently. It was in Paris that he first met Mom Rajawongse Sirikit Kitiyakara, daughter of the Thai ambassador to France (Nakkhatra Mangala) and a great-granddaughter of King Chulalongkorn and thus a cousin of King Bhumibol. She was then 15 years old and training to be a concert pianist.\n\nOn 4 October 1948, while King Bhumibol was driving a Fiat Topolino on the Geneva-Lausanne road, he collided with the rear of a braking truck 10 km outside Lausanne. He injured his back, suffered paralysis in half of his face and incurred cuts on his face that cost him the sight of his right eye. While he was hospitalised in Lausanne, Queen Sirikit visited him frequently. A quiet engagement in Lausanne followed on 19 July 1949, and they were married on 28 April 1950, just a week before his coronation.\n\nFor additional images and narrative of Bangkok and the Royal Grand Palace, Please see my previous posts:\n\nhttps://www.uglyhedgehog.com/t-768406-1.html#13795578\n\nhttps://www.uglyhedgehog.com/t-768562-1.html\n\nhttps://www.uglyhedgehog.com/t-768812-1.html#13804761\n\nhttps://www.uglyhedgehog.com/t-769022-1.html#13808589\n\nhttps://www.uglyhedgehog.com/t-769193-1.html\n\nhttps://www.uglyhedgehog.com/t-769453-1.html#13818213\n\nhttps://www.uglyhedgehog.com/t-769626-1.html#13822238\n\nhttps://www.uglyhedgehog.com/t-770065-1.html#13831334\n\nhttps://www.uglyhedgehog.com/t-770254-1.html#13834827\n\nhttps://www.uglyhedgehog.com/t-770440-1.html#13838500\n\nhttps://www.uglyhedgehog.com/t-770741-1.html#13844097\n\nhttps://www.uglyhedgehog.com/t-770923-1.html#13847788\n\nhttps://www.uglyhedgehog.com/t-771092-1.html#13851315\n\nI hope you enjoy these!\n\nMark\n\nHere are a few more image from our river trip from...
