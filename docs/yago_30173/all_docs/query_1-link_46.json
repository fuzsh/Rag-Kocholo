Having breakfast outside while watching the river flow past is truly relaxing! Our villa was set on the river, with our own garden, veranda and pool with Jacuzzi in, i could've stayed there for months! everything was laid out exactly where you wanted everything, and so so quiet. To break the silence, there is a good strong free Wi-Fi signal.\n\nThe breakfast was perfectly acceptable without going overboard. Strong coffee and omelet made to order, plus the usual bread, rolls croissants, meats and cheeses etc., and some local food as well. The Italian (fine dining) restaurant served excellent Italian food and Pizza's and with an extensive wine list.\n\nAll in all i would have no hesitation in recommending the hotel to anyone after a nice relaxing stay in a beautiful part of the world, i would visit again in a heartbeat.”\n\n“The Legend is a boutique resort and spa and the studios are set in beautifully maintained gardens. We had booked a superior studio which looked very nice but decided on arrival to upgrade to the 1 bedroom pool villa. It is situated on the riverfront with its own private garden and spectacular view. It has its own private pool and Jacuzzi and outdoor living area with seating and bar. The bedroom is spacious and has a work desk, a day bed and a CD/DVD music system. Separate toilet, luggage room and a walk in dressing room with plenty of storage space. A nice touch are the bathrobes and slippers. Coffee, tea and bottled water replenished every day. A welcome bowl of fruit on arrival. The refrigerator is also very useful.”\n\n“We started our 5 day big bike tour with a first stop at The Legend Resort in Chiang Rai and that was the best choice we could have made. The Resort is luxurious while retaining the North Thailand charm. It has Villas and small blocks of rooms. The first night there was also a beautiful wedding with a very nice and charming setting that made it very romantic and many guests watched this wedding. The room was extremely well appointed and even had two small electrical heaters as this time of year it gets cold at night. Bathroom was large and well set up TV safe etc. all very well laid out obviously by professionals and good management. Breakfast was awesome with a large choice of Thai and International foods. Simply delicious. We also indulged in an outdoor massage that was really excellent. Pool water was too cold to try but the set up was excellent. We also had a dinner in their Italian restaurant and again simply one of the best Italian meals I have had for a long time and I am told the Chef is Thai but trained in Italy! Grazie mille for this delicious meal and for a blissful stay. I will be back! Thank you.”"
