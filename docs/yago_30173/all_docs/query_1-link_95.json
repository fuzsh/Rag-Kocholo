Published a few days after the king's passing, the original caption of the picture read, \"The Siamese Succession well provided for\" (Illustrated London News 1910). The eleven sons of Chulalongkorn shown in the picture are neatly posed according to their heights, in a way that suggests their ages and thus perhaps their places in the line of succession. However, this latter assumption would be a misconception. In Thailand royal succession was not based on age alone. Rather, a prince's place in the line of succession depended on a number of factors, one of them being one's mother and her status. Through the time of Chulalongkorn Thai kings, and the Thai political elite more generally, practised polygyny. The sons of Chulalongkorn shown in the picture taken at Eton had several different mothers. (1) They embodied the political importance of polygynous marriage under the pre-1932 absolute monarchy. And yet another well-known picture of Chulalongkorn shows the king with a very different kind of family: a monogamous one. The photograph portrays Chulalongkorn with Queen Saowapha and their five sons. No reference allows the viewer even to suspect that the king could have any other wives. This picture of the royal family seems to be in line with monogamous notions of a nuclear family.\n\nThese two very different pictures show that the king both practised polygyny and performed monogamy. They appear to represent a transitional stage in a country undergoing wide-ranging modernization. The monogamous family only performed by King Chulalongkorn was apparently transformed into practice by the kings that succeeded him and adopted by law in 1935. With the legal adoption of monogamy, Thailand's modernization process as it related to the family seemed to have reached its conclusion. Nevertheless, almost a century later the Thai political elite continues to straddle polygyny and monogamy. Family pictures of politicians today feature only two to three children who share the same parents. Most contemporary politicians seemingly have monogamous marriages. Yet, time and time again, newspapers report on politicians' allegedly having minor wives. Is the Thai political elite practising monogamy or polygyny? Do the family portraits of contemporary politicians represent reality? Or are they just examples of the \"Thai regime of images\", which Peter Jackson characterizes as a form of power that polices and controls actions and discourse in the public sphere, while leaving the same actions unchallenged if they take place in private (Jackson 2004)? If so, the family pictures of politicians' could present the public image of a heterosexual monogamous life, while polygyny and non-normative sexualities are tolerated when politicians practise them in private and they do not come to the attention of the public. Polygyny and monogamy would in that case coexist as multiple truths.\n\nThis article seeks to resolve these questions through an examination of the institution of marriage as members of the Thai political elite have practised it since the promulgation of the 1935 law. It draws both on textual evidence such as memoirs, cremation volumes and newspaper articles and on extensive interviews with Thai politicians and their relatives. I conducted ninety-five interviews during two stretches of fieldwork, February-August 2010 and May-August 2011. The majority of interviews were semi-structured interviews conducted either at parliament in Bangkok or at the offices or homes of politicians. Participant observation during the 2011 election campaign, weddings and funerals also offered the opportunity for less formal interviews. The main objective of fieldwork was to investigate kinship politics in Thailand. The role of politicians' marriages emerged as a significant theme during the interview process. Politicians may represent a narrow social group. But the political elite is uniquely suited to the focus of this study, as the regime of images is a part of Thai political culture. To investigate the members of the group most firmly entrenched in that culture is only logical. (2)\n\nI argue that even up to the present day the marriages of members of the Thai political elite alternates between polygyny and monogamy. Further, the \"Thai regime of images\" cannot explain the performance of monogamous marriages in some situations and the practice of polygyny in others. Rather, one should understand this behaviour as an instance of radical contextualization, in which politicians aim to maximize their own political advantages and to minimize those of their opponents. It is not a form of embedded power that governs politicians' simultaneous adherence to varying marital norms, but rather the conscious utilization of these norms for their operational power.\n\nBefore the wide-ranging modernization of the country's political and bureaucratic system starting at the end of the nineteenth century, polygynous marriages fulfilled a number of political functions. As the adoption of notions of family influenced by notions prevalent in Victorian England coincided with these administrative reforms, monogamy increasingly was portrayed as the ideal. It later became the legal norm, too. However, monogamy did not simply replace polygyny; rather, the former was and remains superimposed on the latter. To preserve formal independence, Thailand had to accept economic dependence. One marker of what Michael Herzfeld calls crypto-colonialism has been an \"[aggressive] national culture fashioned to suit foreign models\" (Herzfeld 2002, p. 900).\n\nAccordingly, Thailand has seen the performance of monogamous marriage alongside the continued practice of polygyny. The ideal of monogamy has found most acceptance among members of the urban middle class. The middle class has been instrumental to the creation of the modern nation-state and crypto-colonialism (Herzfeld 2010, p. 175). I would thus argue it is also most marked by the two. The political elite occupies a social position above that of the middle class. Less influenced by such norms, members of that elite enjoy the freedom to continue the practice of polygyny. The urban poor and the majority of the rural population have, if to varying degrees, likewise escaped the influence of crypto-colonialism.\n\nThese considerations mean that the reception of polygyny and monogamy is highly context dependent, and the superimposition of monogamy on to polygyny enables male politicians to alternate between the two forms of marriage to maximize political advantage. This alternation represents a balancing act whose outcome can be uncertain. The ability successfully to juggle these apparently contradictory forms of marriage is nonetheless a powerful political tool.\n\nThe Thai Regime of Images\n\nThe concept of the Thai regime of images seeks to explain the apparent discrepancy between practice and image in Thai society, in particular with regard to sexuality. However, it falls short as a means of understanding the political function and operational power inherent in the practice of polygyny. The \"Thai regime of images\" represents a form of power, in the Foucauldian sense. Embedded in Thai society and social practice, this power polices actions and discourses in what is culturally defined as the public sphere. Public actions and discourse are thus subject to a higher degree of control than private ones. Utterances or practices that do not conform to cultural ideals will confront the exercise of legal and cultural modes of power and removal from public visibility. Those norms and ideals are not, however, enforced in the private realm. Only when behaviour that breaches cultural norms becomes public do policing and the construction of an image take place. Often these latter are achieved through the denial of such practices by official sources (Jackson 2004).\n\nAccording to Jackson, the regime persists because \"intrusive, inquisitorial concerns with 'saving souls' or ensuring the inner purity of a person's 'spiritual essence' [is] alien to Thai religious culture\" (Jackson 2004, p. 201). Therefore, norms need not be enforced in the private realm. Only when certain behaviours become public and are visible to others, potentially foreigners, is the construction of an image necessary. Official sources create such an image through the denial of such practices. Jackson argues that this denial is based on an \"epistemological multiplicity, which should not be equated with duplicity\" (ibid.). In other words, Thais do not share the Western ideal that outward appearance should reflect the inner being. The creation of \"separately contextualized 'time and space' domains of operation to the different public and private cultural logics\" (Jackson 2004, p. 202) resolves the disparity between the public and the private. One adapts one's behaviour to the context of each time and place, and the result is the \"high degree of internal differentiation and contextualization of Thai culture. This means that different representations of \"reality\" may coexist, with the Thai episteme providing for multiple forms of 'truth'\" (ibid.).\n\nJackson's classification of the public and the private represents a weakness in his argument about the regime of images. His emphasis on the international audience in defining the public realm dodges the needs to reckon with the complexity of Thai society. Polygyny is a good example of this dodge. Jackson gives us the impression that the existence of a man's multiple households is denied to the foreign scholar only (ibid., p. 195). However, in many cases a husband will maintain an image of a monogamous relationship with each of his families, whose members often can only suspect that he has one or more additional households. (3) The dichotomy between foreign and Thai is untenable. Various publics and privates also comprise Thai society itself. They include politicians and voters, the urban and the rural populations, the upper and lower strata of society. While this list of possible publics and privates is not complete, each of these spheres has its own cultural logic according to which a politician must act. The result is a range of performances that match each of the respective logics.\n\nFurther, the separation of private and public is in itself also a performance. In Thai politics the public and the private have always been intertwined, with no clear separation between these two spheres. Private spaces, such as the home of a politician, can become public--as the location of meetings, as campaign headquarters and as a point of contact for voters. Private affairs like personal relationships and marriages can affect politics. This lack of separation of private and public sphere is not, however, obvious, as politicians create an image of a separation of the two spheres. Politicians portray themselves as rational actors who act for the benefit of the state and of voters. They thus greatly downplay the importance of private relationships. The purpose of the image that they foster is to preserve, in turn, the image of Thailand as a modern state, in which officials and politicians are devoted to institutional rather than personal benefits. The importance of these images stem from the perception that the impact of private affairs on politics represents a threat to the state, one that could challenge its underlying principles (Eriksen 2010, p. 128). Simultaneously, this enactment of the separation of spheres legitimizes politicians' positions and power.\n\nThe objective of the performance of a separation of spheres and of an institutional state is to portray the country as modern to a foreign audience. To be sure, the Eurocentric ideal of the impersonal, institutionalized state is the standard against which the modern state is measured. In order to safeguard its independence in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, the country subscribed to the separation of spheres. This fashioning of politics to suit foreign models made and continues to make political sense on the international level. Nevertheless, for the majority of Thai politicians, the primary point of reference is local--not, in the first instance, necessarily even national--rather than international. In the day-to-day activities of politicians, the international audience has little relevance. Their performances are therefore for the consumption at the local and, by extension, national scales. Politicians stage the performance of the separation of spheres or the performance of monogamous marriage for other Thais, and not for foreign observers.\n\nOf course, some groups in Thai society have adopted the foreign ideals of the impersonal state and monogamous marriages as their own more than others. Members of the former group may have adopted monogamy as the ideal form of marriage, while others are aware of the function of polygyny and embrace the practice. A politician must thus perform on various levels at the same time, behaviour that leads to an apparent multiplicity of truth.\n\nIf we accept the idea of multiple truths put forward by Jackson (2004), we are presented with a dilemma, one that becomes very clear when we look at politicians' marriages. According to the logic of multiple truths, one man can be both monogamous and polygynous at once. How is that possible? How can such antithetical concepts persist in the same society or even mind of the same person? Penny van Esterik, upon whose work, with that of others, Jackson bases his concept, attempts to explain the time-place domains. She refers to the layer of meaning that underlies the regime of images as palimpsests. A palimpsest is, she writes, \"a parchment or slate from which old writing has been erased to make room for new writing\" (van Esterik 2000, p. 41). Thus, the new writings or concepts would have visible traces of the older notions.\n\nThe idea of the palimpsest, however, is also insufficient as an explanation for the regime of images. Traces of the old might always be visible on a palimpsest, but it is still one more or less consistent piece of work. Out of a dialogue of old and new, one new concept arises. The traces of the old do not necessarily make sense on their own, just as the new cannot stand alone. The idea of the palimpsests does not allow for the multiple truths of the regime of images because only one norm and one reality emerges. There is no need to create an image. The palimpsest fails, therefore, to accommodate multiple truths or the simultaneous existence of polygyny and monogamy.\n\nRather than to force multiple truths into the palimpsest, we should distinguish between actual practice and performance. A polygynous marriage will always be a polygynous marriage. The minor wives will not disappear just because the politician creates the image of a monogamous relationship. The practice is unaltered. However, the politician can choose to perform a polygynous or monogamous marriage, depending on the context in which he finds himself. Performance does not become truth. But it is not the truth that is most important. Nor is the unity of inner self and outward performance the significant issue. What matters more in Thai society is to comply with the norms that govern any given social context.\n\nVan Esterik (2000, pp. 36-41) refers to this compliance with reference to kalathesa or time--space domains, each of which has its own set of rules. These rules are often recent inventions, representing an imitation of courtly manners on the part of the urban middle class. What I propose here is slightly more radical. Context matters in a profound way. The practice remains relatively constant, but performances must change radically to fit into each time--space domain of Thai society. A breach of the rules of any of these contexts is an act of power.\n\nThe concept of multiple truths rests on the mistaken supposition that surface performances become the self and thus truth in Thai society. Citing a long list of authors--including Mulder (1985 and 1997), Morris (2000), and Van Esterik (2000)--Jackson (2004) argues that Thai society is preoccupied with surface appearances. Such appearances encompass proper dress and speech as well as the denial of widespread practices such as prostitution. Accordingly, appearances matter more than factual proof. They become a person's identity and part of official discourse. While I agree with the notion of the fundamental importance of surface and appearance rather than factual evidence, I argue that this importance does not translate into self, identity or truth. A denial of certain practices does not mean that the parties involved take that denial at face value. A performance has two sides: the performer and the audience. The performer knowingly chooses to portray polygyny or monogamy to achieve his political goals. The audience is, not unlike a theatre audience, aware that they are witnessing a performance that may not reflect the underlying truth beneath it. The audience can choose to consume the play or to challenge it. In Thailand, challenges to the performance represent social misbehaviour, but in political circles they are not uncommon. Politicians often deliberately spread rumours about alleged sexual promiscuity to undermine their opponents' reputations and electability. Performance, as well as challenges to it, is a weapon of the powerful.\n\nChange and Continuity in the Institution of Marriage\n\nBefore the legal adoption of monogamy in 1935, polygyny fulfilled numerous political functions in Siam, today's Thailand. Historically, politics depended heavily on personal relationships enforced through marriage relationships. The practice of polygamy allowed for a large number of such relationships. The practice thus integrated the kingdom politically and connected the centre to the periphery. The numerous offspring of polygamous marriages enforced the social hierarchy and the stability of succession to the throne. Polygamy was also a vital part of Thai political culture, which equated a man's having numerous wives with leadership skills and prowess (Loos 2006, pp. 114-16).\n\nWith the modernization of the state in accordance with Eurocentric notions, many of the functions of polygyny became obsolete. King Chulalongkorn introduced an increasingly centralized form of government, westernized the administrative structure and separated military from civilian offices. The local administration was now--with the introduction of salaries and regular transfers --increasingly dependent on the central government (Wyatt [1983] 2003, pp. 166-209; Terwiel 2005, pp. 203-6). This centralization also integrated formerly largely independent tributary states into the central administration and thus created the country in its modern shape. With the increased centralization of the state, the need to create alliances with tributary kingdoms through polygynous marriages gradually disappeared. Furthermore, changing attitudes towards inheritance and an approach to succession that now increasingly favoured primogeniture made the production of a large number of offspring unnecessary to guarantee the security of the royal line. (4) The expansion of government agencies opened up more and more bureaucratic positions and made it impossible to rely largely on members of the nobility to fill them. Polygyny could thus no longer enforce social hierarchy (Loos 2006, pp. 113-14).\n\nThe apparent obsolescence of polygyny contributed to the inscription of monogamy as the only form of marriage into the legal code. As polygyny had gradually lost its political importance, it had become a constant topic of discussion, something criticized by both Thai and foreign commentators alike. Controversy about the advantages and disadvantages of polygyny extended over several decades, preventing the adoption of a modern family law. Finally, in 1935, the parliament adopted a modern family law enshrining monogamy as the legal norm for marriage (Barme 2002, pp. 162-66; Loos 2006, pp. 100-29; Reynolds 2006, pp. 185-212). However, the law failed to outlaw polygyny. Under the new law, a man could only register marriage with one woman. But there was no punishment for his violating this law and registering more than one wife. And it was only possible to dissolve registered polygynous marriages when the first legally registered wife appealed in court to annul any subsequent marriage registrations. Subsequent family laws did not change these provisions. Even today, there are no legal consequences, such as fines or imprisonment. The registration of multiple marriages is thus practically free of risk (Falk 2007, p. 36). This situation reflects Thailand's crypto-colonial situation, as the country has adopted a legal notion favoured by foreign powers but at the same time allowed for the continued practice of polygyny.\n\nThe introduction of monogamy was far from only a legal measure. The state has propagated it as the basis of a well-functioning society; some sections of society adopted it as a moral ideal. The Eurocentric concept of a monogamous nuclear family is, however, a very recent arrival to Thailand. Thai kings rarely administered their subjects through the family as an institution, unlike the monarchs not only of Europe but also of Asian countries such as China and Japan. The situation changed during the reign of King Vajiravudh, who passed legislation based on the concept of the family and encouraged his officials to lead orderly family lives. This policy was seen as an integral part of building a strong country that could hold its own against outside pressures. The family became linked to the continuity of the country itself, a notion that has been part of Thai political discourse ever since (Chalidaporn 2012, pp. 88-91). Given the perceived importance of family and marriage to the society and the country, the government strongly promoted the notion of the monogamous nuclear family. This effort proved most fruitful among members of the urban middle class, who have adopted it as part of their moral compass and who measure politicians against it.\n\nLegal and Social Definitions of Wives\n\nWhen monogamy became the official form of marriage in Thailand, the legal status of wives--including minor wives--changed drastically. It became, as it remains, very difficult to determine a woman's position. We must draw a clear distinction between the legal framework relating to marriage and the social practice. Thai family law today recognizes only one wife, and no regulations accommodate the continuing practice of polygyny. In social practice, however, the continuity of polygyny is recognized, and two distinct statuses for wives are referred to: major wife (mia luang) and minor wife (mia noi). People classify women into these categories in the social context, and the two categories are neither static nor exclusive.\n\nThe major wife is the principal spouse, often the one who is officially registered as such. A registration of her marriage provides the woman with legal recognition. In practice, however, not all major wives register their marriages. The factor that defines a major wife's status of superiority in relation to other wives lies in the husband's esteem for her; confirming a woman's uxorial status may thus be difficult. According to the Royal Institute Dictionary (Ratchabanditsathan 1999, p. 875), \"a major wife is respected as the superior wife\". Outward signs of the high esteem that a man has for his wife include the formal registration of the marriage, a public wedding ceremony and the appearance of the wife at official and public events.\n\nThe importance of the recognition of a marriage by other members of society is far more significant than legal registration of that marriage, as the cases of former prime ministers Chuan Leekpai and Yingluck Shinawatra show. Each was married in a wedding ceremony, had a long-term relationship with his or her spouse and had a child with that spouse. But neither ever officially registered the marriage (Rerngsak 1992, pp. 113-25; Buk thu yu 2013, p. 389). (5) Their partners, however, are known to the public as their spouses. A term for this phenomenon has been coined: wife or husband outside of marriage (pharaya nok somrot or sami nok somrot) (Khom chat luek 2009). Its use makes clear that the lack of a marriage certificate does not necessarily mean that a couple is not married in the eyes of Thai society. As long as one presents a woman or man publicly as one's spouse and as some form of wedding ceremony has taken place, a couple is considered married. In practice, this reality also means that a wife whose marriage has been legally registered, but who is not publicly presented as such, is not a major but a minor wife.\n\nA minor wife (mia noi) is, according to the Royal Institute Dictionary (Ratchabanditsathan 1999, p. 875), \"a woman who is supported like a wife by a man\" but who does not \"have the same prestige as a major wife\" and is \"rarely legally registered\". The issue of minor wives is rarely the topic of public discussion, and it is difficult and often impossible to deliver proof that a woman is a man's minor wife. Having given birth to a child is the one definite proof of being a minor wife that is beyond dispute. Nevertheless, minor wives are seldom displayed in public.\n\nThe categories of major and minor wife are fluid and complex; they have changed over time. Their definition involves attention to criteria such as the length of relationships and commitment to the union as reflected in official registration, public appearances, financial support and the birth and acceptance of children. A woman's status can change from a minor wife to a major wife. A minor wife's taking part in official events and being photographed in such contexts represent a challenge to the major wife. The minor wife is attempting to achieve public recognition, and, if she is successful, she becomes the major wife.\n\nPolitical Functions of Marriage\n\nThe enshrinement of monogamy as the legal form of marriage meant that the major wives of politicians gained in importance. The official spouse of a politician is particularly important, as she is known to the public and thus represents both her husband and his family. She is expected to possess skills that enable her to serve as a hostess and as the political partner of her husband (Rangsivek 2013, pp. 170-78). However, apart from such skills, it is also crucial that the relationship between husband and wife be portrayed as a loving and healthy one. As one member of parliament states, a politician's family can influence voters' decisions to support his candidacy.\n\n[The family is] important, because it is a fundamental value in the Thai society. People think that a person who is responsible towards the family is the best. That means that this person is a good leader, who can look after the people. (6)\n\nBoth members of parliament and voters recognize the importance of a warm family to electoral success, as it serves as evidence of a politician's leadership qualities. But a warm family here refers to a monogamous family in which the married couple and their children behave in accordance with social ideals and their respective gender stereotypes. If any member of a politician's family deviates significantly from the perceived ideal, the assumption is that voters will be discouraged from supporting him. If a politician's family life is not in order, or he cannot raise his children properly, how can he look after his constituency? Thus, a man's ability to maintain a warm family home with only one wife is closely connected with his being perceived as a good leader.\n\nThis view represents a marked shift from the perceptions of leadership before the implementation of legal monogamy in Thailand. A multitude of wives previously indicated the qualities of a good leader. Now, the success of a monogamous marriage does so. In both cases, however, it is a man's ability to manage his private life that sets him apart as a skilled leader. The main message is that the man who is able to lead in private can do so in public. Further, marriage is closely related to a man's masculinity and potency. An unmarried man who enters the political realm very quickly faces accusations that he is gay, a point to which I return below.\n\nPoliticians are aware of the importance of a smoothly functioning and warm family in defining their images. They thus aim to maintain that image and to perform accordingly. The memoirs and posthumous accounts of politicians' lives often describe their marriages as marriages of love, even when political advantages might also have played an integral part in matches. One such example is the marriage of Field Marshal Thanom Kirtikachon (1911-2004) to his wife Chongkon in 1929. Thanom's son-in-law Suwit Yodmani related the story as follows.\n\nLady Chongkon was the daughter of a military officer, a major. At that time generals were very few. A major already had a lot of power. Chuap Krabuanyut was Lady Chongkon's father. He had been Field Marshal Thanom's commanding officer before. They had served together and got to know each other. But the two people fell in love by themselves. The parents did not object, even though the father and, especially, the mother of Field Marshal Thanom had already chosen a woman.... Field Marshal Thanom loved whom he loved. Nobody was able to say anything.... Therefore, they really loved each other. They loved each other for over 70 years, were married for over 70 years. (7)\n\nThis narrative portrays the future prime minister's marriage as a love marriage in which he defied his parents, who already had made a different choice of wife for their son. Love is a recurring theme for Thai politicians; all marriages are portrayed as love-matches made without reference to prudence or calculation. Often, however, such marriages served to increase political advantages or access to resources, as was the case in Field Marshal Thanom's marriage.\n\nMarriage bonds serve to create alliances that allow politicians to further their ambitions and to prevent conflicts with potential rivals. Marriage can win a politician inclusion in networks to which he has had no previous access. Such was the case in the marriage of General Chatchai Choonhavan (1920-98) to Bunruean in 1944. Bunruean was the first cousin once removed of the Princess Srinagarindra--the widow of Prince Mahidol Adulyadej and mother of King Bhumibol Adulyadej--and served the latter as a lady-in-waiting before her marriage (Kanlayaniwatthana 2016, p. 9). That marriage thus gave the future prime minister Chatchai connections to the palace that undoubtedly helped advance his political career. (8)\n\nIn similar fashion, marriages can also serve to prevent conflict between politicians. One prime example was the marriage between the children of Field Marshal Thanom and Field Marshal Praphat Charusathian (1912-97). The marriage of Narong Kittikachon to Suphaphon Charusathian joined the families of two of the most influential political figures of their time. It took place shortly after the military coup on 16 September 1957 that put Field Marshal Sarit Thanarat (1908-1963) and his clique at the pinnacle of power in the Thai state. Thanom and Praphat were leading members of that clique; Thanom appeared to have the upper hand. The marriage of their children in May 1958 made the two in-laws and thus transformed a situation of possible competition into one of at least some degree of alliance (Thanom and Chongkon 1981, p. 15). (9) It played a strategic role in preventing conflict and to centralize power, not least as the two senior officers would end up governing Thailand in partnership during 1963-73.\n\nMarriages can also serve to secure talented successors or to increase the political potential of a family. The establishment of monogamy as the legal norm effectively limited the number of a politician's recognized offspring. Children not born to the major wife would endanger their father's image. To have successors, politicians must therefore rely on fathering capable children, preferably sons, by their major wives. But some men only had daughters, or found that their children had no interest in politics. Sons-in-law could meet the need thus created. Talented sons-in-law could also serve to increase a family's political strength and to broaden its field of activity. Field Marshal Phin Choonhavan (1891-1973) entered politics after leading the Thai coup of November 1947. He had five children, four of whom were girls, with his major wife. His only son, Chatchai, would serve as prime minister during 1988-91. Of his four daughters, two married military officers, one a high-ranking civilian bureaucrat and one a businessman (Phin 1973; Praman 2010, p. 267). (10) This combination of sons-in-law gave Phin's family the opportunity to weather political storms and changes in circumstances. It also enabled Phin to secure his political legacy by helping two of his sons-in-law into politics.\n\nDespite the change in the institution of marriage, it has nevertheless retained many of its functions. The legal norm for marriage has changed from polygyny to monogamy and transformed the representation of marriage among politicians, who now apparently practice monogamy. Still, marriage as an institution has continued to create alliances, secure talented successors and contribute to the politician's image as an able leader and a potent male. Yet, because monogamy limits the number of connections that one person can build, it also must be seen as largely performative. Politicians continue to engage in polygynous lifestyles.\n\nPolygyny as a Double-Edged Sword\n\nNotwithstanding the status of monogamy as the official, legal form of marriage, polygyny continues in Thai society today. In political circles, it is generally accepted and even expected that male politicians have many women and wives. Informants related to me that politicians find women made available to them wherever they go. Encounters can become regular; when the politician starts to like a woman, she will receive a house or apartment and become financially dependent on the man. The relationship slowly evolves and, at some point, the woman is likely to be seen as the man's minor wife.\n\nThe most notorious case of a politician's having minor wives was that of Field Marshal Sarit Thanarat, who served as prime minister from 1958 to 1963. The strongman was surrounded by beauty queens and \"his unsatisfiable sexual appetite has been an open secret\" (Thak [1989] 2007, p. 224). When, shortly after Sarit's death, the full magnitude of his potency became known, the public was shocked. At least eighty-three women claimed to be his wife or minor wife, and five offspring surfaced (Dom et al. 1964, p. 130; Sayam nikon, 19 February 1964). (11) The shock was particularly great because Sarit's private life became entangled with issues of alleged corruption. Many of his proclaimed or actual wives made claims to his inheritance, which amounted to 2,874,009,794 baht (Thak [1989] 2007, p. 224). A long investigation into the origin of his fortune made clear that Sarit had used official funds for private purposes. Media reports focused on the sensational aspects of his corruption. They repeatedly emphasized that some of the fortune that Sarit had embezzled ended up in the land, houses, and cars of his minor wives (Dom et al. 1964). (12) The media thus help to create a clear association between wives, above all minor wives, and corruption. This notion remains widespread even today, and many of my informants asserted that a wife can lead her husband into corruption.\n\n[If] the wife has a \"demand\" and the husband is afraid of his wife, then the wife can guide her husband to do such things [as committing corruption and accepting bribes]. (13)\n\nA common perception is that women demand material goods from their husbands, that they thus have the potential to lead their husband into amoral behaviour. Only a man's not being \"afraid\" can head off this risk, and a strong and masculine man with the ability to exert leadership over his wives is moral. The more wives a man has, too, the greater the danger that one of them could dominate him.\n\nTraditionally, however, men had many wives, in reflection of their potency and leadership skills (Loos 2006, pp. 114-16). To have several wives can, even today, benefit a politician, in particular in the eyes of members of the society that have not completely adopted the idealized concept of the warm family. Sarit's case illustrates the importance of minor wives in reinforcing a politician's image of prowess. Thai society associates minor wives with the satisfaction of sexual needs. Sexual desire is perceived as the main motivation for any man to take minor wives. It follows that a man with many wives must have a strong sexual drive and that, the more wives a man has, the more potent and masculine he must be. Society, again, associates these latter traits also with leadership and power. His having numerous wives also suggests that a man is capable of attracting women in competition with other men. The perceived desirability of the women involved amplifies these assumptions and sets the man in question apart from others. It highlights his extraordinary abilities and legitimates his power. Seen in this light, Sarit's preference for beauty queens was reasonable. He surrounded himself with some of the most attractive women in the country. In this way, he manifested his own prowess, demonstrated in his ability to win these women and to manage them. The precise nature of his relationships was less relevant. It did not matter if these relationships were sexual. The mere assumption that they were, proved sufficient to boost his reputation as a strongman.\n\nDespite common assumptions, Sarit did not in fact take minor wives primarily to satisfy his sexual desire. Considering the number of his \"wives\" in relation to the number of his offspring make clear that something is amiss. At a time before effective birth control, one would expect him to have more than seven children. In comparison, King Chulalongkorn had 77 children and 152 wives. While it is impossible to know for certain why Sarit did not have more children, two reasons seem to be most plausible. His unhealthy lifestyle may have left him infertile. The majority of his children were born to the wives that he took early in life, long before he became prime minister. His first two wives alone gave birth to four of his children (Dom et al. 1964, pp. 124-40; Phim thai 1964, p. 1). Thus, it is possible that he experienced a sharp decrease of fertility or even impotence later in life. But the youngest of his children was born only shortly before his death (Dom et al. 1964, pp. 158-59; Phim thai 1964, p. 1), rendering reasons of health an unlikely explanation for the paucity of his offspring. It is also possible that Sarit did not regularly engage sexually with all of his wives. The accounts of his minor wives noted that it was not uncommon for several of his minor wives to keep his company at the same time (Dom 1964, p. 189); sexual relations were thus unlikely. Whatever the case, it can be surmised that Sarit did not have sexual intercourse with all of his wives on a regular basis and that the satisfaction of sexual desire was perhaps not the main reason for his taking minor wives. His practice of polygyny was to some extent a performance rather than a practice.\n\nMinor wives serve to create lasting links between politicians, as did the polygynous marriages of the Thai elite in the time of the absolute monarchy. This role is not restricted, that is, to marriage with major wives. Patron-client networks retain fundamental importance in Thai politics, and marriage can serve to reinforce relationships in those networks. Polygyny allows politicians more possibilities to create relationships between patrons and clients. They may keep an eye open for good-looking women who might appeal to certain other politicians. They may then present women to politicians of higher standing to create an alliance not entirely different from an actual marriage alliance. Even if the woman becoming the minor wife of the politician is not a daughter or niece of the \"wife giver\", a strong sense of the need to reciprocate is engendered in the recipient politician. Crucially, the relationship between giver and recipient politician is not likely to end as long as the latter's relationship with the woman continues. Similarly, the \"given woman\" may be grateful for the social advancement that she and potentially her family have gained out of the connection with the recipient politician. Contemporary practice thus recalls the custom that saw high-ranking noble families or wealthy Chinese present their daughters as consorts to the Thai kings in the hope of social advancement for their families (Loos 2006, pp. 110-14; Pornsiri 2009, pp. 51-70; Wyatt 1994, pp. 123-26). An example is Kamningnit Wongwatthana, the minor wife of Field Marshal Po Phibunsongkhram (1897-1964). Kamningnit was born in the late 1930s in the Northeastern province of Udon Thani. She was working at a bank in the province when she was discovered by Luean Buasuwan, a figure closely associated with the Soi Ratchakhru political faction of the Phibun regime. Luean sponsored Kamningnit as a contestant for the title of Miss Thailand 1954. While unsuccessful in the beauty pageant, with Luean serving as matchmaker she became Field Marshal Po's minor wife (Jarun 1959, pp. 227-36). Another example is Raphiphan Lueangaramrat, better known by her nickname Chingrit and the minor wife of Chatchai Choonhavan. (14)\n\nIronically, minor wives can also endanger alliances between politicians through major wives. In November 2008, a video of then prime minister Somchai Wongsawat became public. It showed him with two different young women, on two separate occasions. On one occasion, Somchai took a young woman out for lunch. The second incident shown in the clip involved Somchai and another woman. They are shown entering a hotel, having lunch and shopping together. While the video depicted no sexual contact, little imagination was needed to guess what happened in the hotel. Somchai later admitted that he was the man in the video, but he claimed that it had been manipulated to discredit him. While he claimed to know who was behind the manipulation, he did not want to pursue legal recourse options (Manager Online 2008). While he gave the appearance of being honest, he thus frankly denied having a minor wife. It was up to the viewer to decide what to believe, but the episode certainly damaged Somchai's image. Beyond that damage, a further possible goal of the person making and releasing the video was to weaken the relationship between Somchai and his in-laws. Somchai was married to former prime minister Thaksin Shinawatra's sister Yaowapha. He had just become Thailand's prime minister in order to secure the Shinawatra family's political interest when the video was released. The footage seemed to date from March 2006, long before its release. If the purpose of that release had merely been to harm Somchai's image, those behind the release could have acted much earlier. They waited, however, for the moment when it would have the biggest possible impact. By releasing the video after Somchai became prime minister, the damage to his image was only a side effect. It was his relationship with the Shinawatras that was more likely to have been the target. It remains unknown whether this attack was effective or not, as Somchai a month later lost his seat as prime minister and was banned from politics.\n\nThe ability of rumours about minor wives to affect politicians' relationships with their major wives and the alliances made though marriages to them depends on a number of factors. These include the power relations within a family. If for example a relatively junior politician is married into a very influential family, rumours concerning minor wives could be very damaging. The character of the couple involved is also a factor. If the major wife is powerful in her own right and not favourably inclined towards the idea of her husband having a minor wife, the outcome could be fatal. Laiat Phibunsongkhram was, for example, allegedly involved in an unsuccessful plot to assassinate her husband's minor wife (Jarun 1959, pp. 97-126). Under such circumstances it should be of little surprise that politicians can resort to performing monogamy even to their major wives. The major wife becomes the audience of the politician's performance, in another test of the understanding of public and private with which this article is concerned.\n\nAs noted above, the image of a warm and functioning family has become integral to a politician's perceived leadership abilities. However, it is the urban middle class that most strongly embraces this ideal. Its members have adopted a moral compass influenced by Eurocentric values and state propaganda. In their view, a politician's polygyny would not only breach the ideal but also prove him amoral and possibly corrupt. Therefore, rumours about minor wives are often publicized to tarnish politicians' characters. One such example was a rumour about Phin Choonhavan's son-in-law police general Phao Sriyanond (1910-60) that surfaced in the late 1950s. Newspapers reported on his alleged love life in his Swiss exile. It was reported that he had left his wife Udomluck in order to tour Europe with two minor wives (Sanseri, 25 March 1959). As Phao had fallen from power at the time of Sarit's 1957 coup, the purpose of this rumour was evidently to destroy his reputation and thus to prevent his political comeback. Udomluck's narration of romantic walks by Lake Geneva later refuted these rumours (Phao 1970; Udomluck 1981).\n\nIn contrast to the logic of the regime of images, the men involved tend to ignore rumours about minor wives. The regime would suggest that politicians must strongly deny rumours concerning minor wives and even resort to legal measures in order to try to push them out of the public realm into the private one. But, no, denial of such rumours would destroy the perceived prowess of the politician, while acknowledgement of their truth would harm his image with some part of society. To remain quiet allows the politician to use the rumour to his own advantage. In the rare case in which a politician comments on an alleged relationship with a minor wife, it is often in the same fashion as Chatchai Choonhavan. His minor wife, Raphiphan Lueangaramrat, was well known to the public. He did not deny the relationship, but he made it known that it was a pure and platonic relationship, one not polluted by sexual desire (Thai rat, 7 May 1998, p. 5). Hence, while acknowledging the relationship, Chatchai tried to scrub it of all amoral connotations that might harm him.\n\nPoliticians have to walk a thin line between portraying monogamy to some sections of society and mobilizing polygyny when to do so is beneficial. Polygyny provides a politician with an important political tool. He can use his minor wives to create alliances and to enforce his prowess. These benefits are, however, largely limited to political circles. Alliances forged tie a politician to other male politicians, and it is among politicians that having numerous wives is appreciated. On the other hand, minor wives have the potential to damage alliances that are made through the major wife, as well as result in loss of support from her and her family. In the eyes of voters, in particular those in the urban middle class, polygyny is amoral--evidence of a politician's corrupt nature. They value the image of a monogamous warm family, and presenting that image is in that context beneficial to a politician. Whether, then, a politician presents an image marked predominantly by the portrayal of monogamy or of polygyny is context-dependent.\n\nThe Danger of Not Getting Married\n\nThat marriage is such a balancing act might make it appear that a good choice for a politician is to remain unmarried. However, that option is not without risk either. In Thai society there is a close association among sexual desire, masculinity and power. A strong sexual drive makes men more masculine, and in turn more powerful. Men in powerful positions, such as politicians, are therefore assumed to be more masculine and more sexually active. While sexuality is not limited to married relationships, it is seen as abnormal and suspicious for a man in power to remain unmarried. Members of the Thai society at large and of political circles in particular are quick to presume that an unmarried man in a powerful position is gay.\n\nRumours about the homosexuality of male politicians are widespread. The most prominent political figure rumoured to be homosexual is General Prem Tinsulanon, prime minister from 1980 to 1988 and now president of the Privy Council. The basis of these rumours is his never having been married and his having long surrounded himself with often much younger male officers. A rumour of homosexuality is very damaging. Despite the frequent portrayal of Thailand as a homosexual's paradise, that is far from the case. As long as men's sexual preferences remain unknown--that is, never displayed in public--they do not face criticism. However, once they have made their homosexuality publicly known, they face criticism--being \"considered to be foreign, strange, potentially dangerous, or even criminal, and a perverted form of manhood\" (Jackson 1999, p. 238).\n\nMarriage is one way for a politician to demonstrate his sexuality and to avoid suspicion regarding that sexuality. When rumours suggest that a politician is gay, listeners lose any possibility of refuting them. Being gay as a sexual preference is not necessarily displayed openly. It often remains behind closed doors and unmentioned. Someone who hears a rumour, without knowing the subject of the gossip in person, has no way of knowing if it is true. When a rumour is not outwardly refuted, a chance that it could be true remains. But one type of evidence of a politician's sexuality is his involvement with numerous women. In this context, rumours about minor wives or other sexual engagements can be an advantage. This is also one reason that very few Thai politicians remain unmarried. General Prem is one of the few exceptions.\n\nConclusion: Between Polygyny and Monogamy\n\nThe two photographs of King Chulalongkorn and members of his family discussed at the beginning of this article demonstrate his alternation between the practice of polygyny and the performance of monogamy as different contexts require. More than a century later, Thailand's political elite is still in a similar situation. Despite marked outward change in the marriages of members of Thailand's political elite, there has also been a pronounced continuity in the political functions of marriages. Historically, polygynous marriages secured succession, created alliances and enforced a leaders' potency as well as masculinity. With the change to the family law in 1935, monogamy became the legal norm and many of the functions of marriages seemingly disappeared. However, politicians conformed with the new legislation only in the view of some parts of the public. In private, their engagement in polygynous marriages continued. This practice made it possible for politicians to solidify alliances by means of marriages to several women, and to manifest their masculinity and potency. Today, they perform monogamy mainly for the urban middle class whose members have adopted Eurocentric values concerning the monogamous nuclear family. Marked by crypto-colonialism, Thailand's elite has adopted monogamy, the form of marriage suited to foreign values, as the legal norm. Yet at the same time its members have not been willing to give up the political advantages of polygynous marriages. The continued practice of polygyny and the selective performance of monogamy in various contexts allow politicians to use the function of both to the fullest. The political function of marriage, as well as the highly contextualized use of performance, clearly shows that in Thai politics the separation of public and private sphere has not come to pass.\n\nContrary to the assertions associated with the idea of the Thai regime of images, the performance of monogamy does not become truth. Despite government propaganda advocating monogamous nuclear families, polygyny remains an accepted part of society. Discrepancies between the legal framework and social practice are not seen as contradiction. Rather the perception is that the legal framework strengthens the institution of family, while the practice of polygyny reflects human nature. Law and practice apply to different contexts in society. The use of rumours also shows that politicians and their audience alike recognize the performative nature of monogamy and challenge it to their own advantage. Rumours about a politician's minor wives or sexual orientation aim to damage his reputation and political career. The strategic timing of such rumours, disseminated at times when they are most harmful, demonstrates politicians' conscious use of challenges to the performance of monogamy as a tool. It also shows that to some extent politicians are aloof from the social constraints of moral norms of contextualized behaviour. For, if they challenge the legal framework by practising polygyny, they also challenge the performances of other politicians by spreading rumours. They are, that is, not subject to the power of the regime of images. They use performances and challenges to performances as instrumental forms of power.\n\nKatja Rangsivek is Research Fellow, Chulalongkorn University Social Research Institute, Fifth Floor, Visid Prajuabmoh Building, Phaya Thai Road, Bangkok 10330, Thailand; e-mail: [email protected].\n\nNOTES\n\n(1.)
