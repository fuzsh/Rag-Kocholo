        "text": "Across the Chao Phraya River from Chinatown are old neighbourhoods steeped in history. Over a hundred years ago, one of them was the home and playground of a goldsmith's daughter who decades later become the mother of two beloved monarchs. But the late Princess Srinagarindra was not the only historical figure who once called this area home.\n\nNot so far from the Princess Mother Memorial Park, which is dedicated to Princess Srinagarindra, sits Wat Anongkharam where she used to study. The temple was built during the reign of King Rama III by Thanphuying Noi, wife of then-Phraya Si Phiphat Ratchakosa (Tat Bunnag) who ordered a major renovation of another temple nearby now known as Wat Pichaiyat, or officially Wat Pichaya Yatikaram.\n\nDuring the following reign, Phraya Si Phiphat Ratchakosa was promoted to become Somdet Chao Phraya Borom Maha Pichaiyat, overseeing the capital as well as overseas trade. He was one of the only four persons in history to attain the Somdet Chao Phraya rank. This explains why the road that cuts through these areas, as well as the canal running side by side with it bear the name Somdet Chao Phraya. The Chao Phraya River, however, has nothing to do with this. The name has been used since the Ayutthaya Period.\n\nBack to Princess Mother Memorial Park, the area next to it used to house a community of Muslims from Pattani and India, among them were the forefather of the Nana family, which donated the land for the park. Near the park's entrance there is a big arched gate bearing the initials RBMCO, which stands for Randery Braramakran Company. It's the real estate business of the Nana family, which was established in 1913. Some of those Muslim immigrants were craftsmen who work with gold hence the lane they lived in is called Soi Chang Nak (goldsmith lane).\n\nBut, of course, this part of Klong San also was home to Thai and Chinese people. Apart from the mentioned temples, there are still a few more, each with interesting history and architectural art. Among them are Wat Thong Nopphakhun and Wat Thong Thammachat.\n\nIn the past, the communities were linked by small criss-crossing waterways, which is why the area is called Klong San, which means woven canals. These days, they are connected by small roads and alleyways that make it convenient to explore on foot.\n\nMany residents are newcomers but there are also those who never left. During one of my visits, I met an old man who told me about the people's reaction during the Manhattan Rebellion in 1951 against Field Marshal Plaek Pibunsongkhram who was the prime minister at that time. He recalled that he was very young and the sounds of gunfights from the Memorial Bridge were loud and frightening. On the latest trip to the area, a man who was collecting fallen tree branches told me about a beautiful Chinese mansion nearby. I followed the directions he provided, found the place but only took pictures of its intricately embellished gable from outside.\n\nLike other old parts of Bangkok, the more I visit this side of Klong San, the more I learn about the Thai society and history. The area is safe and easy to get to. Who knows, you might find it one of your favourite places too.\n\nTRAVEL INFO"
