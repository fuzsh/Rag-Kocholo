        "text": "Sunday 22nd of June 2014 and I'm off to an Urban Safari with Bangkok Photographers. I spoke with my friend the organiser and there would be around 40 Photographers joining the urban safari. Plenty professionals to learn from. We will met under the Sapan Taksin Bridge at 2 o'clock in the afternoon. We will take a River Taxi boat to the Memorial Bridge. We will then walk across the bridge to the Thonburi side of the river to begin our walk.\n\nMy friend was sick so no boxing today and I was not very happy about it, but shit happens.\n\nI took a taxi to the Sapan Taksin (Taksin Bridge) sky train where we were going to meet at 2 o'clock. I was 25 minutes early and I had time to walk around the area.\n\nThere are a ferry station (Sathorn Ferry Station) under the bridge.\n\nThere was one stop for the “long tail” boats and there was a jetty for boat serving the hotels on the Thonburi side of Chao Phraya River\n\nFishing in the canal and we can only imagine how clean the water is\n\nFour different colours on the flags on the boats leaving Sathorn Ferry Station\n\nAnd we can see that the green flagged ferry have this station as the start station going up Chao Phraya River\n\nOur route up the Chao Phraya River to Memorial Bridge\n\nWith 6 stops on the way as we can see on the map\n\nThe best Chao Phraya Express boat map I have found - From http://www.theydrawandtravel.com\n\nArtist: Yanika Keeratipaibul Facebook and you can see more of her work at http://ishshii.tumblr.com\n\nClick HERE for bigger map!\n\nI also learned how to see the difference between the different boats leaving from our jetty. We are going to Memorial Bridge and we will have to take the boat flying an orange flag. There are four different colours.\n\nI crossed the small canal and I bought a bottle of water from one of the vendors. Luckily enough they didn't had any Diet MAX for sale\n\n- We have Coke Zero\n\n- I would rather drink the water from the Canal\n\nSo I bought a bottle of water and I was walking back to Sathorn Ferry Terminal and I was soon talking with a girl.\n\nIt didn't take long before she wanted to take a picture of Mr. Handsome. Well, who am I to say no. But of course, I took a picture of her taking my picture.\n\nI'm walking around the jetty looking for a waste paper basket to throw my empty water bottle.\n\nIt was not easy to find any trash bin and I had to carry my bottle. I was hanging around when I guy came up to me. He asked if I was with the Bangkok Photographers. Must have been my camera that gave me away.\n\nI had suspected several of the people at Sathorn Ferry Terminal to be members of Bangkok Photographers. But I'm not the kind of guy walking up to strangers starting a spontaneous conversation. So it was nice when the British guy came up to me. We talked away some time and we could soon see the others in the group outside Sapan Taksin Exit #2 and we moved over to them.\n\nChao Phraya River looking North from Sathorn Ferry Station\n\nChao Phraya River looking South from Sathorn Ferry Station\n\nBangkok Photographers meet outside Sapan Taksin Exit #2\n\nBangkok Photographers meet outside Sapan Taksin Exit #2\n\nWe were about 40 people joining the Urban Safari “Hidden Gem” walk. I didn't recognise any of\n\nThe Memorial Bridge\n\n(Thai: à¸ªà¸°à¸à¸²à¸à¸à¸à¸¡à¸à¸£à¸¡à¸£à¸²à¸à¸²à¸à¸¸à¸ªà¸£à¸à¹) is a bridge over the Chao Phraya River in Bangkok, in Thailand, connecting the districts Phra Nakhon and Thonburi.\n\nThe bridge was opened on 6 April 1932, by King Prajadhipok (Rama VII) in commemoration of the 150th anniversary of the Chakri Dynasty and the foundation of Bangkok, shortly before the Siamese Coup d'Ã©tat on 24 June 1932. In English the bridge is commonly known as Memorial Bridge, however in Thai it is most commonly known as Phra Phutta Yodfa Bridge (à¸ªà¸°à¸à¸²à¸à¸à¸£à¸°à¸à¸¸à¸à¸à¸¢à¸­à¸à¸à¹à¸²), after King Buddha Yodfa Chulaloke (Rama I), the first king of the Chakri Dynasty.\n\nConstruction of the bridge was started on 3 December 1929 by Dorman Long, Middlesbrough, England. The bridge used to have a moving mechanism, which is now disused.\n\nOn 5 June 1944 as part of the bombing of Bangkok in World War II, a force of B-29 Superfortresses, in a test of their capabilities before being deployed against the Japanese home islands, were targeted against the bridge. The bombs fell over two kilometres away damaging no civilian structures, but downed some tram lines and destroyed a Japanese military hospital and the Japanese secret police headquarters. It was not until 1947 that Thai authorities learned of the intended target.\n\nFrom Wikipedia\n\nthem from my previous meetup meetings with Bangkok Photographers. But it seemed to be a nice group today. Our 2 Guides held an informative meeting and we were ready to go.\n\nThey were afraid that we would have to take 2 boats, but we were lucky, the boat was empty when arriving to the jetty and all of us got on board and we were soon on our way to the Memorial bridge and ferry station #6 where we will get off the boat and cross the bridge by foot. Well, this will be fun so hang on!\n\nWe left Sathorn ferry station and the Taksin Bridge behind and we made 5 stops on the way. I was soon to learn that a whistle meant that we were coming up to a ferry station. The Deck boy had a whistle in his mouth and he jumped ashore and he put the rope on the bollard on the jetty. He whistle one more time when the rope was made fast. I never understood this, the boat was still making speed ahead when he made fast the rope.\n\nNow it is easy to imagine what happened when the boat came to a full stop. I was almost flying across the boat. Thanks to my lightning fast reflections I had the time to grab a rail. But the girl selling the tickets felt together with more of the passengers.\n\nAnd they told me it was a nice ride today, it was usually much worse according to the frequent travellers. Well, I have only been on these boats once before, almost 25 years ago. A nice view of the city and the Chao Phraya River. But a taxi is the safest way to get around.\n\nWell, I got some pictures of the river and now I don't have to go on any Express boats for another few years.\n\nWe got off the boat and we were soon on the Memorial Bridge walking across Chao Phraya River towards the Thonburi side.\n\nCrossing the Memorial Bridge\n\nCrossing the Memorial Bridge\n\nSomdedprapokklaojaoyuhau Bridge from the Memorial Bridge\n\nBangkok River Park Condominium on the left hand side\n\nCrossing the Memorial Bridge\n\nTug steaming up the river with empty barges\n\nAnd they will most likely disturb the guests at our hotel in Bang-Pa-In with the noise\n\nTuk Tuk coming up on the Memorial Bridge from the Thonburi side\n\nIt was a beautiful bridge, not one of those new constructions made out of concrete only to keep it cheap. I stayed a wee bit extra on the bridge to get a picture of a tug and her tow of empty barges passing under the Somdedprapokklaojaoyuhau Bridge next to the Memorial Bridge. Steaming North and they will pass the hotel we lived at in Bang Pa In disturbing the guests with the noise.\n\nWe left the bridge as soon as we reached the Thonburi side. There is a small park on the left hand side coming over the bridge and I think it is a part of the Chaloem Phrakiat Forest Park. I left the bridge coming down the corner and the group was sitting in the stairs waiting for all of us to have crossed the bridge for a group picture.\n\nI ran in to a group picture\n\nI ran in to a group picture\n\nI ran in to a group picture\n\nClick HERE for bigger picture\n\nWe're ready and we can continue\n\nOur first stop will be at the Goowatil Islam Mosque next to the Princess Mother Memorial Park not far away from the Memorial Bridge. But before getting to the Goowatil Islam Mosque we will have to cross a small Canal and walk through an area with housing so this promise to be interesting.\n\nWe left the Memorial Bridge and we walked down Phaya Mai Rod until we reached the Uthai Alley and we crossed the small Canal. We turned left at the intersection. There was a lot of interesting stuff to ge ton picture, but the most fun was the Photographers taking pictures.\n\nWe're passing under the Somdedprapokklaojaoyuhau Bridge\n\nWe're passing under the Somdedprapokklaojaoyuhau Bridge\n\nBird cages with election posters\n\nBird cages with election posters\n\nStopping for something to drink\n\nWalking over the Canal\n\nWalking over the Canal\n\nA tree that have been growing through the bridge over the Canal\n\nNo need to go to Cambodia to see the “tree through the house” temple\n\nWalking over the Canal\n\nWe reach the Goowatil Islam Mosque\n\nGoowatil Islam Mosque\n\nGoowatil Islam Mosque\n\nGoowatil Islam Mosque\n\nMemorial and Somdedprapokklaojaoyuhau Bridge\n\nWe can also see the Chao Phraya Express Boat ferry station #6\n\nLong tail boat on Chao Phraya River\n\nPhotographers at Goowatil Islam Mosque\n\nGoowatil Islam Mosque\n\nWe reached the Goowatil Islam Mosque and we had to enter through a very small door. 120cm and not many cm wide, but thanks to my fruit diet I passed through the door without any problem.\n\nI had been looking around the Mosque and I decided to go out to wait for someone coming out through the door. Might be a good picture. I came out through the door and the first thing I ran in to was a girl taking my picture. So she had been coming up with the same idea and she was lucky, must have been hilarious to see me squeezing through the small door.\n\nShe left, of course, this was a once in a life time picture she got, a cubic ton getting through the small door. I took a few pictures, but there was only small to normal built people passing through the door so I lost interest. The mosque was just next door to the Gong Wu Shrine opposite from the Princess Mother Memorial Park.\n\nThere was another Chinese temple or shrine in the area, the Chao Pho Suea Shrine. So I went to explore while waiting for the others to be ready at the Goowatil Islam Mosque. Well, there were quite a few of them members walking up the street towards the Chao Pho Suea Shrine.\n\nOne of the organizers outside the Princess Mother Memorial Park\n\nWe can see the Chao Pho Suea Shrine up the road\n\nWalking towards the Chao Pho Suea Shrine\n\nWalking towards the Chao Pho Suea Shrine\n\nThai or Chinese, never mind, just throw the garbage were you standing\n\nPassing a barber shop on my way to the Chao Pho Suea Shrine\n\nPassing a barber shop on my way to the Chao Pho Suea Shrine\n\nWalking towards the Chao Pho Suea Shrine\n\nClothes out for drying\n\nReaching the Chao Pho Suea Shrine\n\nChao Pho Suea Shrine\n\nChao Pho Suea Shrine\n\nChao Pho Suea Shrine\n\nWe take yet another group picture before going to the Gong Wu Shrine\n\nA group picture outside Princess Mother Memorial Park\n\nI ran in to yet another group picture coming back from the Chao Pho Suea Shrine.

I don't know, for sure looks the same. We had a few other members we had to wait for before we could take the group picture.\n\nIt was an interesting area and there was a lot to look at. We had a few people wandering off and they had hardly been able to find the way back.\n\nWe took the picture outside the Princess Mother Memorial Park and the Gong Wu Shrine was just on the opposite side of the road. There was a recycling place outside the Gong Wu Shrine and there were 2 guys handling empty bottles. Good to see that something is getting recycled. They were also keeping a bonfire a live at the place. And that didn't smell too good.\n\nGong Wu Shrine\n\nGong Wu Shrine\n\nGong Wu Shrine - And we can see the smoke from the bonfire on the left hand side\n\nGong Wu Shrine\n\nGong Wu Shrine\n\nGong Wu Shrine\n\nGong Wu Shrine\n\nWe met outside the Gong Wu Shrine and when everybody was ready with the Gong Wu Shrine we\n\nThe Princess Mother Memorial Park\n\nThai: à¸­à¸¸à¸à¸¢à¸²à¸à¹à¸à¸¥à¸´à¸¡à¸à¸£à¸°à¹à¸à¸µà¸¢à¸£à¸à¸´à¸ªà¸¡à¹à¸à¹à¸à¸à¸£à¸°à¸¨à¸£à¸µà¸à¸à¸£à¸´à¸à¸à¸£à¸²à¸à¸£à¸¡à¸£à¸²à¸à¸à¸à¸à¸µ, often shortened to à¸ªà¸§à¸à¸ªà¸¡à¹à¸à¹à¸à¸¢à¹à¸²à¸¯, Suan Somdet Ya) is a park in Bangkok, Thailand. It was established in 1993, and opened on January 21, 1997, by King Bhumibol Adulyadej, in remembrance of his mother, Srinagarindra, the Princess Mother.\n\nThe park contains gardens and a reproduction of the royal mother's childhood home, as well as two exhibition halls showing memorabilia of the princess and the royal family and a pavilion with a statue of the princess. There is also a souvenir shop which sells items from charitable foundations and social welfare organisations which used to be under her patronage; the profits go to help the poor and the destitute.\n\nFrom Wikipedia\n\n+++++++++\n\nIn 1993, His Majesty the King made known his wish to renovate the area around the Princess Mother's childhood home in Thonburi. Unfortunately, it was soon discovered that the building the Princess Mother knew as a child, which apparently was dilapidated in her time, no longer existed. However, there were some similar buildings nearby, which the owners gladly donated to the King for His project.\n\nMost of the land is devoted to open space, with beautiful gardens incorporating crumbling elements of the old structures. Two exhibition halls were constructed, which now display photographs and mementos from the Princess Mother's life. The first hall displays well-signed photographs chronicling her life. The first large photograph shows the young princess at age 14, with long untamed hair and looking not a little wild. The photos and text carry you through her education in Bangkok, her meeting with the young Prince Mahidol, the birth of her three children, and finally her death in 1995 and elaborate cremation ceremony in 1996.\n\nThe second hall displays pictures of her active life, her many projects, and even some very personal items such as Buddha images she sculpted for the royal family and a Mickey Mouse needlepoint apparently meant for the King.\n\nBehind the exhibition halls is a large park space. Off to one side is a reconstruction of the Princess Mother's childhood home in the neighbourhood. There's also a small elevated gallery showing rotating exhibitions of photography by Thai artists. A gazebo shelters a statue of the Princess Mother and a small shop near the reconstructed house sells refreshments manufactured by some of her projects.\n\nFrom http://bangkokforvisitors.com\n\nentered the Princess Mother Memorial Park. I had pretty much expected an ordinary park so I was pleasantly surprised when I discovered old ruins and some museums. It was a beautiful place and it was kind of cool in the shadows under the trees.\n\nI have never heard of the park before but I understood that it was something special with the ruins in the park. And if you ever think about going to Cambodia to see the “tree growing through houses” temple you can save the money and come here instead.\n\nI was walking around and there was a house and I didn't paid any attention to it. Another souvenir shop? I was wrong, it was a house with glass walls and they showed how the inside of a Thai home looked like 100 years ago. There were some Thai people there and we started to talk.\n\nThere were also a museum and I stepped inside. Someone told me that I had to take of my shoes. Well, I skipped the museum. And yes, I can understand why they take of their shoes in respect for holy building etc. But I cannot understand why the same people worshipping a building can come right out from the building throwing garbage all over the place. No respect for the earth and this is our home. And more important, this is the place where your children will live.\n\nEntrance to the Princess Mother Memorial Park\n\nPrincess Mother Memorial Park\n\nRuins in the Princess Mother Memorial Park\n\nAnd we can see the tree growing through the roof, so no need to go to Cambodia\n\nPrincess Mother Memorial Park\n\nPrincess Mother Memorial Park\n\nTree through the roof in Princess Mother Memorial Park\n\nNo need to go to Cambodia\n\nOutside Princess Mother Memorial Park - Father and son?\n\nOutside Princess Mother Memorial Park - Father and son?\n\nOutside Princess Mother Memorial Park - Enjoying the day\n\nI'm wandering around outside Princess Mother Memorial Park while waiting for the others\n\nAnother interesting “Off the beaten track” in Bangkok\n\nI'm wandering around outside Princess Mother Memorial Park while waiting for the others\n\nMaking small omelettes and the children called me LARDASS\n\nI'm wandering around outside Princess Mother Memorial Park while waiting for the others\n\nMaking small omelettes and the children called me LARDASS\n\nI'm wandering around outside Princess Mother Memorial Park while waiting for the others\n\nInteresting way to wear the eye patch\n\nThis shirt must have won some kind of prize\n\nI was wandering around checking out the area around the Princess Mother Memorial Park. It is really nice just to walk around Bangkok, always people moving around and they live their daily life just outside the door steps. And most of them are very friendly.\n\nThe rest of the group were still in the Princess Mother Memorial Park but they started to come out one by one. We started to walk up Somdet Chao Phraya Soi 3 towards the Somdet Chao Phraya Road. I was very hungry and I had asking the family making the omelette where I could buy Pineapple. They had offered me omelette but I told them that I was on diet and the children started to call me LARDASS immediately.\n\nWell, I was really looking for something to eat, a few weeks ago and I would have bought a snickers bar in the MOM & PAP shop. But as I'm on to something here I wanted fruit only.\n\nThe rest of the group is coming\n\nThe girls found something interesting to take picture of\n\nThe girls found something interesting to take picture of\n\nSomdet Chao Phraya Soi 3\n\nSomdet Chao Phraya Soi 3\n\nSomdet Chao Phraya Soi 3\n\nSomdet Chao Phraya Soi 3\n\nHe had been studied at Lund's University - But he didn't spoke Skånska\n\nSomdet Chao Phraya Soi 3\n\nWe reach Somdet Chao Phraya Road\n\nWe reach Somdet Chao Phraya Road\n\nWaiting for the bus at Somdet Chao Phraya Road\n\nCats on Somdet Chao Phraya Soi 3\n\nWe walk down Soi Chang Nak\n\nA fantastic wooden house - Looks like wallpaper or like the window covers are a paintwork\n\nWe walk down Soi Chang Nak and the sky turns black\n\nBangkok River Park Condominium sticking up\n\nWe walk down Soi Chang Nak and the sky turns black\n\nBlack sky and approaching rain with strong winds.

Should have been a hard hat area with all the garbage flying around. After 10 minutes it started to pour down and I had to seek refugee in a laundry shop. I was joined by 2 other girls from the group after a minute or so. The rain gave up after 5 minutes and we continued towards Princess Mother Memorial Park.\n\nMost of the group members had left us when we reached the Somdet Chao Phraya Road and we were around 8 people remaining, all of us taking shelter in the MOM & PAP shop because it was pouring down again. And no sign of any taxi. We were really of the beaten tracks and I expected to have to wait here until the rain stopped so we could walk to the main road.\n\nI saw a taxi coming down the small Soi, but the “FREE” light was off. But I decided to wave at him just to make him aware that here was a customer waiting when he had dropped his passenger.\n\nI don't know how long time it was, but I saw another taxi coming down the small Soi, and the “FREE” light was off. I gave it a try and he stopped and I was surprised to see that the taxi was empty. Obviously the “FREE” light was broken and we were soon off towards Sukhumvit Soi 23.\n\nTime for a VISA run, I'm on overstay so I will have to pay a fee at the airport Immigration.
