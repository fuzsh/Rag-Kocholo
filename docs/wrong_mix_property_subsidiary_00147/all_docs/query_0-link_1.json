(You can select Manager for a contingent worker assignment only if the HR: Expand Role of Contingent Worker user profile option is set to Yes.)\n\nBy default, the first assignment entered is the primary assignment, and the Primary box is automatically checked. If you are now entering a secondary assignment, you must ensure that the Primary box is unchecked.\n\nCheck the Primary check box to update a secondary assignment to Primary.\n\nSee: Changing Primary Assignments, Oracle HRMS Workforce Sourcing, Deployment, and Talent Management Guide\n\nIf you use Oracle Services Procurement to provide purchase order information for contingent worker assignments, the purchase order line may include the projected assignment end date.

This special ceiling overrides the ceiling defined for the grade scale.\n\nTo enter a billing title for an employee or contingent worker (Oracle Projects only)\n\nChoose the Project Information tabbed region.\n\nNote: The Project Information tabbed region displays only if you have installed Oracle Projects.\n\nEnter a billing title.

The list of contracts is limited to those entered for the employee that have start dates on or before the assignment start date.\n\nSelect the agreement grade structure for the collective agreement. A window shows the grade factors for that grade structure.\n\nEnter values for the grade factors. Or, choose the Combinations button and enter search criteria for one or more grade factors to display the reference grades that meet those criteria.\n\nIf you enter values directly into the grade factor fields, they must correspond to an existing reference grade unless the Override Allowed check box in the Agreement Grades window is checked.\n\nNote: Any new combinations of values that you enter are unavailable for reuse with other assignments. To reuse a combination, you must define it as a reference grade in the Agreement Grades window.\n\nContact Information\n\nContact Information Overview\n\nOracle HRMS enables you to record the ways in which you communicate with the people in your enterprise and the people whom they have a relationship with, such as an employee's partner.\n\nEntering People as Contacts\n\nYou enter people as contact records to identify:\n\nPeople to contact in an emergency\n\nDependents of the employed person\n\nBeneficiaries of certain benefits, such as insurance policies or stock purchase plans\n\nIndividuals who receive a wage attachment payment\n\nEntering Contact Information\n\nEntering contact information includes entering contact details for the people in your enterprise, such as their home address.

For example, in the Netherlands you must record a person's house number for social insurance reporting.\n\nEntering Addresses (Address Window)\n\nYou can enter as many addresses as necessary for each person, using the Address window.\n\nNote: You cannot enter or update address information in the Address window for a contact who is also an employee or contingent worker. Instead, update the relevant employee or contingent worker record.\n\nTo enter an address for a person\n\nSelect a national address style and click in the Address field.\n\nIf a local address style exists for your country, it is displayed as the default. Otherwise, the international style is displayed.\n\nAustralia Users: There is a choice of Australia address style and Australia (International) address style. If you want change from Australia (International) address style to Australia address style, you can by running the Upgrade Australia Address Style process. This is an optional step.\n\nFinnish Users: To display the postal code and post office on the same row in line with the Finnish Address standard, the application displays them in the same field, separated by a space. If you are not using Finnish postal codes upload functionality, you must enter postal codes and post offices manually. See: Entering Postal Codes, Oracle HRMS for Finland Supplement\n\nDutch Users: When you record foreign addresses, ensure you use the Dutch International address style. This address style enables you to report the address in the wage report in the required format.\n\nUS and Canadian Users: There is a choice of US address style and International address style if you have Vertex geocode data installed. If you are not maintaining DTW4 data and do not want to enforce the strict tax validation, then you can disable this using the HR:Enable DTW4 Defaults profile option.\n\nUS Payroll Users: If the Address Validation Using Vertex Web Services feature is enabled, then Vertex Web Services validates addresses in the Address window.
