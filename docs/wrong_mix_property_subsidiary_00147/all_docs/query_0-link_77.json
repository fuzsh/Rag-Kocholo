But it hasn't been immune to the struggles facing the tech industry in recent years. Salesforce announced in January that it would be cutting 700 more jobs after slashing thousands in 2023.\n\nThis story is available exclusively to Business Insider subscribers. Become an Insider and start reading now. Have an account? .\n\nOn July 2, Salesforce shareholders voted against a proposed compensation plan that would keep Benioff's base pay the same but bump his total to $39.6 million, up from $29.9 million in 2023.\n\nBenioff has outlasted multiple co-CEOs at Salesforce — including one who reportedly tried to go for the top job. He and his wife Lynne are known for donating millions to charity.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHere's how Benioff, whose estimated net worth now stands around $10 billion, worked his way onto the national stage.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMarc Russell Benioff, 59, was born in San Francisco on September 25th, 1964, the son of Joelle and Russell Benioff.\n\nBenioff is something of an anomaly among Silicon Valley CEOs — he was actually born and raised in the San Francisco Bay Area. He graduated from Burlingame High School in 1982, Bloomberg reported.\n\nHis father, Russell Benioff, owned a local department store in San Francisco. \"I learned my work ethic from him,\" Benioff once said, according to SFGate.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEarly on, Benioff was interested in tech and being an entrepreneur.\n\nBenioff got his first job at a jewelry store to save for his first computer. He was eventually fired for cleaning the floors with the wrong soap. While in high school, Benioff sold his software — \"How To Juggle\" for the TRS-80 Model 1 computer — to a computer magazine for $75.\n\nAt age 15, Benioff founded Liberty Software, a one-man company making games for the Atari 800 computer. Titles included \"King Arthur's Heir,\" \"The Nightmare,\" \"Escape from Vulcan's Isle,\" and \"Crypt of the Undead,\" Entrepreneur reported.\n\nBy age 16, Benioff was pulling in $1,500 a month — enough that he was able to pay for his own tuition at the University of Southern California.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile at USC, Benioff took a summer internship with Apple.\n\nHe worked as a programmer in the Macintosh division under cofounder Steve Jobs. \"That summer, I discovered it was possible for an entrepreneur to encourage revolutionary ideas,\" Benioff would later write in his book \"Behind the Cloud: The Untold Story of How Salesforce.com Went from Idea to Billion-dollar Company — and Revolutionized an Industry.\"\n\nJobs became one of Benioff's mentors. \"There would be no Salesforce.com without Steve Jobs,\" Benioff said in 2013, according to Entrepreneur.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBenioff graduated with a B.S. in Business Administration in 1986.\n\nUSC named him an honorary Doctor of Humane Letters in 2014. He now sits on the University's Board of Trustees.\n\nBenioff planned to stay in programming for the rest of his career, but a USC professor suggested he might have a mind for business. So he took a customer support role at high-flying database company Oracle right out of college, according to his \"Behind the Cloud\" book.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBenioff rapidly rose up the ranks at Oracle after starting in 1986.\n\nAt age 23, Benioff was named Oracle's \"Rookie of the Year.\"\n\nBy age 26, he was named a vice president — the youngest person to attain the role in the company's history, according to his bio on Salesforce.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile at Oracle, Benioff caught the attention of its founder Larry Ellison. The two became very close, with Ellison mentoring the younger Benioff.\n\n\"They sailed to the Mediterranean on Ellison's yacht, visited Japan during cherry blossom season, spent Thanksgiving together, and even double-dated,\" according to Fortune.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAfter 13 years with Oracle, Benioff started itching for something new.\n\nWith Ellison's permission, Benioff took a sabbatical to travel the world. He spent part of that time studying meditation in Hawaii.\n\nBenioff came up with the idea for Salesforce while swimming with dolphins. He soon started working on the company with a few other Oracle veterans, Entrepreneur reported.\n\nSalesforce was a revolutionary idea in 1999.\n\nThe big idea behind Salesforce was that while most companies — including Oracle — sold enterprise software that companies had to install on their own servers, Salesforce could let people access business software from a web browser. For the late nineties, this was revolutionary, Benioff wrote in \"Behind the Cloud.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAt first, Ellison was supportive of Benioff.\n\nEllison even gave Salesforce $2 million in funding from his own pocket to get it started and sat on its board of directors.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut things turned sour between Ellison and Benioff.\n\nBenioff found out that Oracle was working on a direct competitor to Salesforce, the Mercury News reported in 2000. Benioff tried to force his mentor to quit the company's board. Instead, Ellison forced Benioff to fire him — meaning Ellison kept his shares in Salesforce.\n\nIt kicked off an epic rivalry, with the two taking shots at each other in the press. Note the Salesforce jet shooting down the Oracle biplane in this early Salesforce ad from 2001.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe dot-com bust of the early 2000s was a difficult time for Salesforce, but the company rebounded.\n\n\"Suddenly everything around us was falling apart,\" Benioff's cofounder Parker Harris said, according to the Australian Financial Review. However, several clients remained, and Salesforce survived and kept growing, becoming one of the earliest and biggest companies in the modern cloud computing market.\n\nAnd in June 2004, Salesforce held its IPO, raising $110 million at $11 per share.\n\nThat year, the company had about 767 employees.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBenioff personally donated $250 million to the University of California, San Francisco in 2010 to found UCSF Benioff Children's Hospitals.\n\nIn 2016, Benioff fought against proposed bills in Indiana and Georgia that would allow discrimination against gay people. He rallied other business leaders to the cause, with a positive result, according to Time.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBenioff is also a big believer in corporate philanthropy.\n\nUnder his leadership, Salesforce invented the \"1-1-1\" model, where the company gives 1% of employee time as volunteer hours, 1% of its profits, and 1% of its resources to charitable causes.\n\nSan Francisco Mayor Ed Lee declared March 7 \"Global 1/1/1 Day\" in honor of Salesforce's 15th birthday in 2014. Benioff keeps a copy of the proclamation in his office, Forbes reported.\n\nBenioff's philanthropic efforts focus on children's health, the environment, public education, and homelessness, according to his biography on Salesforce's website.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn 2016, Benioff and his wife launched the Benioff Ocean Initiative at the University of California, Santa Barbara to study marine life.\n\nBenioff also serves on the World Economic Forum's Board of Trustees. He credits former Secretary of State Colin Powell and the Hindu guru Mata Amritanandamayi — whom he met on a trip through India — with encouraging him to put Salesforce's resources to work helping others.\n\nAnd while he may not have the globetrotting playboy reputation that his mentor Ellison has, Benioff has lots of friends in the celebrity and political worlds.\n\nBenioff has earned a reputation as one of Silicon Valley's most boisterous CEOs. He rarely appears in public without his custom cloud sneakers.\n\nOver the years, Benioff has spent some of his billions on \"Star Wars\" desk trinkets, according to Forbes, and an extensive tech-themed shoe collection.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Benioffs have several homes and acres of Hawaiian land that they've donated.\n\nOver the past few years, Benioff has bought up land in an agricultural and largely native Hawaiian town called Waimea. He lives in a beachside mansion nearby.
