        "text": "Embodiment\n\nThrough being provided for developing and adopting the platform of telephony feature, overcome the above-mentioned and other defect in the method for existing telephone system based on electric network according to the system and method for various embodiment as application service.\n\nProvide the phone application service method to utilize the following fact according to an embodiment: through using service offering platform (SDP) also through realizing various services being provided based on the method for Service-Oriented Architecture Based (SOA).SDP realizes utilizing various enablers providing some reusable functional, such as calling out the control enabler, and the CCF that it enables to carry out and from these functions of basic network abstract.The media server enabler allows to be independent of functional how actual the realization and the media server that provides is functional, such as the derived session function or flow functional.SDP can also comprise the enabler such as the voice access enabler, and it allows voice dialogue to add application to.\n\nSDP is not absolute necessary, because the widget that on heterogeneous networks, makes up also is suitable.And the use of enabler is neither embodiment of the present invention necessary.In this application, should not be construed and limit the invention to embodiment with SDP and/or enabler.\n\nYet, take this notion to next aspect according to the system and method for various embodiment.Said method can utilize assembly (such as API; API) set up calling between two end points (such as two users or user and equipment), or carry out other functions such as connecting five people in the Conference Calling or handling Multimedia session or the receipt of call notice.\n\n\" widget \" through instead defining Multimedia session (for example, call out, include but not limited to each function of telephony feature property) obtains various advantages.Each widget all can provide such as following function, for example calling or Multimedia session forwarding, calling refusing, urgent call initiation, meeting, calling hunting (hunting), message transmission, charging profile or the like.Each widget all can be a code or a light part of using, and its calling that is positioned at SDP is controlled on the enabler so that telephony feature property or other Multimedia session functions to be provided.Thereby these widgets not only can provide session to control, and the logic that can be used to handle session and other networks (for example IN) function or the like can also be provided.Widget can also provide logic to be used for medium (and multimedia) control, message is sent, chargeed and the visit detailed to the user.\n\nLike this, use or serve and to make up these widgets to provide multimedia, phone and other IN functional.For example; Application can adopt a group window widget with the sender of authentication communication (promptly; Based on a) voucher; B) profile (for example pre-payment or back paying, company, honored guest, common or the like) or c) user of prestige (for example bill/account revenue and expenditure and bill payment/clearing situation)) and confirm for signal post's expectation task (for example based on subscription profile, such as serve for which the user is provided with, setting and like).After confirming this information, the logic in the widget can be used for confirming how to handle communication, such as in voice mail or meeting, call out, notify from a phone call correlation reception person, send message, to service charging, initiate Multimedia session or the like.\n\nThereby the realization of phone application service can adopt widget as construction unit to carry out traffic signaling, allow the abstract of signaling and basic signaling.In case this way is provided, can make up various application carrying out each function, such as multimedia and call forward, calling refusing, call monitoring or the like.Use SDP as required the synthesis window widget so that full ripe phone application or application service to be provided.For example, can create VoIP and use, extremely where it confirm forwarded call based on various factors, such as having information, user preferences or the like based on the active user.In another example, can create dedicated packet switched (PBX) and use, it allows user real time or determines to call out with the mode of pre-programmed where be forwarded to, or the like.It is synthetic to use any proper technology to accomplish, such as Java or BPEL (Business Processing effective language).Can synthesize these widgets so that new phone or multimedia application or application service to be provided.\n\nThereby, according to the realization of an embodiment one group window widget being provided, it can be synthesized so that phone application or application service to be provided.This group window widget can be from the technology of basic network (for example; PBX, the last SIP of IMS; Or the like) abstract comes not only to demonstrate to call out control ability or the media server ability also has other to relate to the functional of calling, such as the forwarding of calling out, obtain about information, authenticated calling, target hunting, the inspection of calling out have information, based on this information directed call or the like.Then, can make up full ripe application, use such as PBX through synthesizing of different single window widgets.\n\nDo not reusing a) widget b) stride agreement c) under the situation of IT practice with the synthesis window widget, currently will provide these functional through proprietary realization.These functions will be not open as can arbitrarily synthesizing to make up the individual call processing widget of using.Use synthetic widget that multiple advantage is provided, such as having on the level of appropriate time-delay calling out the very fast ability of reaction, or the like, because will replacing using correctly to handle, logic calls out, so it is not crucial to the speech of application when calling out.\n\nAnd a lot of having now used, and uses the employing similar functionality such as VoIP and virtual PBX, even but these application also are to make up separately in equivalent environment.This method causes the repetition of code, thereby wastes resource and increased wrong probability.Use method described here, in appropriate environments such as Java or BPEL, for example, use original function or widget are synthetic as those functions, can be used to make up the application of expectation such as the assembly of calling out the control enabler.\n\nNow example implementation will be described; It concentrates on concrete technology and two particular aspects; Comprise how being integrated into IMS or the PSTN/IN characteristic that provides on the SIP, and if basic function is provided, such as VoIP, virtual PBX, SCIM, SIP AS, existence, to the adapter of network, call out control, media server control, voice access, medium and multimedia application (for example IPTV, video, Web meeting, calling; Or the like) and the message transmission, so how the phone application service is provided.Should be appreciated that these aspects only are exemplary, and many other assemblies can use, replace and/or make up to carry out these and other task.Part in these is described elsewhere and/or is advised, under the prompting of this specification and accompanying drawing, these will be clearly to those of ordinary skills.\n\nPossibly realize a kind of like this system, wherein service can be deployed on a lot of networks (current tradition, future and change) and their are coexisted.\n\nFor example, Fig. 1 (a) and Fig. 1 (b) show according to an operable exemplary framework 100 based on service offering platform (SDP) of embodiment.In the exemplary architecture 100 of Fig. 1 (a), SDP comprises platform level, measured, it is with basic network resource abstract and observe Service-Oriented Architecture Based (SOA).In one embodiment, SDP adopts the horizontal SOA platform based on Java 2 platform, enterprise edition (J2EE).SDP comprises that it comprises that SOA SIP AS, OSA AS and phone AS are as the J2EE aggregation container based on the aggregation container (converged container) of Java code requirement JSR 116/289 and JSR 32.SDP also appeared move, voice and other communication enabled devices.\n\nIn Fig. 1 (b), SDP configuration 150 is shown on the basic J2EE core that application server was provided, to realize the functional of expectation.Have the common identity of striding all elements and network management and be valuable about the common view of all data of main body.The basic skills that the service offering platform is provided (for example, J2EE) begins and make this platform become carrier-class, and expansion surpasses HTTP(Hypertext Transport Protocol) to the agreement such as SIP, Diameter and Parlay with measured IT (information technology) platform.In order to support the key protocol relevant with telecommunications, for example, SDP can provide support for SIP/ISC, Diameter and Parlay common object request broker architecture (CORBA) and to the adapter of messaging gateway.Standard method can be used to use for example JCA 1.5 (J2EE connector architecture 1.5), is building up to the adapter of any other resource or agreement.Provide enabler as reusable assembly, it is with Internet resources and standard northbound interface abstract.IT/SOA can be used to provide service then, such as the extra earning service, adopts strategy and business rule (for example, from the third party) based on SOA.Platform can be provided as the integrated SDP of providing based on SOA of system and service then.Realize third party's content and service provider disclosed (exposure) with open, integrated and implementation strategy by SOA.SOA can also be used for supporting and rationalization tactical management and assessment in whole service provider environment.\n\nOn SIP, Parlay or IN agreement, can provide and realize one group of enabler.These enablers can comprise, for example, disclose enabler, and it observes OMA SIP/SIMPLEPresence, XDM and RLS enabler standard so that the output of boxlike (box) IMS open server and SIP/SIMPLE open server to be provided.Can also assemble open (for example network is open) and provide north orientation Parlay X interface open from other networks under the situation that does not add open network, to use for using.Use extendible public data model, position data can be modeled as open attribute.Enabler can, for example, allow the multimedia on SIP (the Internet and IMS) and the Parlay to control with Multi-Way Calling.Media server control enabler and voice access enabler as the MRFC function of MRF can be controlled various speech XML servers, IVR, announcement servers and media server (for example MSML, MSCML, MSCP and MGCP).The outer disabled agreement of box can be structured on the SIP AS or use JCA 1.5.\n\nSoftware application can be given an order in unified user profiles (UUP), to create New Account.The UUP assembly can make workflow-initiating; It can be made up of one or more Business Processing, and Business Processing and operations support systems/operational support system (OSS/BSS) are alternately to initiate the renewal to one or more knowledge base (repository) that OSS/BSS was had.In case the OSS/BSS knowledge base is updated, UUP proceeds so, make the renewal that produces in the OSS/BSS knowledge base be reflected among data hub (hub) and the UUP (or any through UUP visible/other knowledge bases of assembling).UUP is the virtual view in other data knowledge storehouses, makes that the view of acquiescence also is updated when data are updated.Alternatively, from knowledge base synchronously/copy data.In this case, processing automation between OSS/BSS knowledge base and the UUP appears.Yet if not automation well correctly is reflected among the UUP in order to ensure changing, workflow can be responsible for triggering and duplicate.The final result of seeing through application is identical, but the action of any correspondence is safeguarded by workflow.Another alternative has with the Update Information UUP assembly of data in the library component of SOA data managing capacity, and wherein database component self can trigger the workflow of creating with the mutual Business Processing of OSS/BSS.\n\nFig. 2 shows the realization 200 of use based on SDP; Through (for example using such as the device of strategy execution device (PE) and Web service and other bindings; The standard northbound interface), how arbitrarily-shaped domain (SP, terminal) can be connected to the resource among operator, terminal, service provider or the like.Strategy execution device 202 can pass through SDP and carry out the strategy (combination in any of condition and action) on all message, and carries out such as application factor business rule and the function of carrying out the SOA arrangement.In the territory 204 or outer application or other resources can utilize these resources through the assembly of SDP because between the third party of the application that SDP can the domain of definition \" interior \" and territory \" outward \" or other application alternately.SDP can comprise assembly 206, and such as above-mentioned various enablers and/or Parlay X or Parlay API assembly, it can be inherent function property reusable of the expectation discussed below having and/or the assembly that can synthesize.Assembly 206 can be communicated by letter with resource then, such as IMS and non-IMS resource, and Parlay/OSA resource (GW/FW/SCS) and non-Parlay/OSA resource, allow the realization coexistence on the heterogeneous networks.Thereby the Parlay assembly can be used on the level identical with enabler and on SIP, realize, forms OSA AS.\n\nFig. 3 shows the example that the SDP that utilizes Fig. 2 realizes operable enabler 300.In this example; Enabler 300 is reusable and/or J2EE (Java 2 platform, enterprise edition that can synthesize; Can obtain from Sun Microsystems, Inc.) object; It can appear useful inherent function, such as calling out control, open, message transmission, charging, media server control, voice access, unified user profiles (UUP), resource management be provided, or the like.Enabler can also adopt the north orientation API of standard to be used for Java and/or Web service; For example; Can be via adapter abstract resource to network and platform element; Provide network abstract, platform to extract and standard technique,, have the mode of predictable low delay and high-throughput such as SIP or JCA 1.5.Enabler can also be enabler framework 302 a part or based on enabler framework 302 or one group of common functionalities, it can provide continuation, high availability, management, daily record.\n\nEnabler and enabler framework can provide SOA in whole method based on SDP use is to provide the phone application service; Web service appearing to third party and/or third party's gateway is provided; And application of policies and the realization of arrangement among the BPEL be provided; Comprise functional, such as carrier-class BPEL/SOA.The enabler framework can also provide the use of rule or strategy (PDP), and such as the technology of BAM and Studio: SCE (service creation environment).Use the enabler framework can also allow to use various strategies; Such as OSE PE, OMA PEEM, IETF PDP/PEP, 3PGW or user GW strategy; It can be implemented in based on the framework of SOA utilizing BPEL, regulation engine, Oracle Web service manager (OWSM), or the like.Can use any processor effective language, comprise that not only BPEL also has various other rules, script (script), or the like.Enabler can also provide OSS/BSS/SDP integrated, provides functional such as WS, ESB, SOA, or the like.\n\nAs stated, this method provides integrated with such as the network of IMS and legacy network.Fig. 4 shows the example 400 according to this realization of an embodiment.In this example; Adopt application and adapter or the integrated framework 410 of enabler in the service layer of SDP as stated through being discussed like the application other places; Can visit various resources, such as IMS resource 404, SIP resource 406 and tradition or other Internet resources 408.Framework 410 can comprise that the SIP application service is with visit SIP resource; And the OSA application service to be visiting other Internet resources (use Parlay, JCA (to the IN agreement), or the like), and SIP AS and OSA AS may be used to visit the IMS resource for two kinds; For example, S-CSCF.This realization provides the resource coexistence of across a network, and to smooth migration new or complementary network.This realization can also provide polymerization via the network abstract, allows the service on the arbitrary network, and is used for real polymerization through the Identity Management of SP territory and the integrated OSS/BSS that shares.\n\nShown in the storehouse 500 of Fig. 5, use SDP to allow to be used for phone AS based on the realization of SOA, be independent of network technology and/or manufacturer.As can see, can there be variety of network components and gateway 502, such as PSTN, wireless and IP network assembly.For with various assemblies and gateway communication, network and gateway layer 504 can be used for and network adapter layer 506 combination the part of identical layer (or as).Application Middleware 508 can utilize network adapter layer 506 various functions such as exploitation to be provided, to dispose, move and management, is independent of business rule and concrete network.Can provide SOA infrastructure and business rule as the layer 510 on the middleware layer then, the application of business rule and SOA is provided, comprise function such as PE, rule, arrangement, WSGW (WS gateway) or the like.\n\nFig. 6 shows another example 600 according to the realization of the layering of an embodiment, and it can be used to provide integrated with networking component and gateway 602 (such as the assembly of IMS, NGN, the Internet and legacy network).In this example, networking component and gateway 602, with the assembly (for example, WMG, GGSN, SGSN) of network and gateway layer 604 together, form the IP transport plane.Control plane 606 can be formed on the IP transport plane, and control plane comprises middleware and adapter, comprises other assemblies that S-CSCF, I-CSCF, P-CSCF, HSS, HLR and the application other places are discussed.SDP is deployed on the control plane part as \" service \" plane 608 then, and it can comprise assembly (such as the SOA assembly), uses (such as VoIP and PBX application), enabler framework and such as about described other assemblies of Fig. 2.\n\nService plane among Fig. 6 also comprises SIP servlet (servlet) container, provides functional such as agency, register machine and position functions property.Fig. 7 shows the example of exemplary architecture 700 that is used for using this SIP container according to an embodiment.This in one embodiment realization can be used to provide communication and mobility service device, and it can be used on the equipment such as phone, cell phone, PDA or the like, providing phone AS.This framework is depicted as and comprises some SIP infrastructure enablers 702.A this enabler is open enabler, is used to provide public information such as SIP/SIMPLE, Presence, XDM, RLS and gathering.Other enablers can comprise the agency that is used for the SIP route, be used for public address is mapped to the register machine enabler of active user's information, the position enabler that is used for confirming active user SIP network site, application router or the like.This framework also comprises application session component 704, allows SIP and HTTP servlet, for example, shares session status via application.According to the needs of objective network and gateway component, this framework can also comprise container and the protocol component that is used for HTTP, SIP and other agreements.\n\nIn one embodiment; SIP container among Fig. 7 is the compatible container of JSR-116 or JSR-289; Its application support that polymerization is provided (for example; Click-to-dial (click to call)), radius support (for example, special-purpose login module) and integrated AAA database and session traversal entity are used for NAT (STUN) support.Container can also be for database is integrated provides support with the ENUM that is used for number translation (E.164 number mapping).Container can with Diameter (Sh, Ro, Rf...) compatibility, and cross-platform availability can be provided, such as Linux, SUN, Solaris, HPUX, AIX, Windows or the like.\n\nThis in one embodiment communication and mobility service device can provide support for extendible agency of trademark registration machine and the location-based service that is used for the VoIP application and the VoIP/ video/IM client of branding again.Server can also be that IMS is compatible, can be deployed as IMS sip application server and/or IMS open server.Open server can be deferred to SIP/SIMPLE, and can provide XDM (XML file management), RLS (resource list server) and open the gathering to support.Open server can also be OMA (Open Mobile Alliance) and defer to IMS.\n\nFig. 8 shows the framework 800 about the said framework of Fig. 7 that is similar to according to an embodiment, but in this situation, provides the network connectivity server to realize, perhaps OSA AS target architecture.In this example, various other enablers 802 are provided, comprise that charging, message are sent, media server is controlled and the voice access enabler, like desired various other combinations can be provided certainly.Open enabler can be used for network is openly appeared for via the user situation of Parlay from HLR.Multi-Way Calling control enabler can be used for Parlay, SIP and other.The OSAAS assembly can be provided, and it can comprise that for example Parlay 5.1 Java realize and ParlayX 2.1 WS.OSA AS can also provide tradition and IMS compatibility, and can administer and maintain the Parlay gateway registration.Can also comprise some adapters, such as JCA 1.5 adapters with to the Parlay JCA adapter of Parlay gateway (Corba) and other Internet resources.\n\nThis network connectivity server can allow to develop next generation network (NGN) and use, and it operates on the current network, and the smooth migration of the service from the tradition to IMS/IP is provided.Comprising network adaptation layer provides the connectivity based on JCA 1.5 of Parlay gateway, and it all is extendible for any resource, and the OSA among the J2EE is provided AS, and use Parlay/Parlay X realizes API and is operated on JCA 1.5 and the SIP.This layer also provides support of many application servers and high-performance.For example, Fig. 9 shows the view according to the realization of the OSA AS assembly 900 of Fig. 8 of an embodiment, and it strictly observes Parlay 5.1 Java and realizes (J2EE is local) and Parlay X 2.1 WS.When the enabler in this realization can be shared northbound interface with ParlayJR/X, enabler can be not limited to other local simple Parlay assemblies of being discussed like the application.\n\nAs stated, this method can be used to provide the phone application service, and it can be adopted by some different application and technology.In one example, can provide VoIP to use, it utilizes the realization according to various embodiment.For example; Figure 10 shows example 1000; The interface 1002 that wherein is used for VoIP application 1 004 is depicted as and allows the user such as operator, visits and utilizes this system to come and devices communicating such as soft VoIP/ videoconference client, terminal adapter and the soft client of third party.This VoIP use can the synthesis window widget selection so that various functions to be provided; Such as audio call, video call, the instant message transmission that comprises audio message, call history, customization offer for subscription and issue, open tactical management, many account managements, contacts list management, customization installation procedure, brand skin and theme and high quality audio and Video Codec, comprise G.711, G.729, H.261 and H.263.VoIP uses and can also on SDP, expand, and various functions are provided, such as open and instant message (for example, the interoperability of open+VoIP/ video, open+VoIP+ video SIP-and X10 and the open+VoIP+ on the PSTN stop (exhalation)).This application can also provide following function property such as incoming call, SMS to go out, SMS goes into, two the tinkle of bells, video-mail, bell sound, location-based RBT or the like call back.This VoIP uses can comprise various characteristics; Such as Lawful Interception, 5 class features, PSTN and voice mail route, call forward, caller's privacy and/or identity, incoming call and outgoing call forbid, PSTN prefix, ENUM route, address translation, local number route, emergency services route, ACR/DCR (characteristics of management) and Lawful Interception (CALEA with similarly), be structured in industrial standard platform (such as J2EE) and go up and on commercial hardware, move.\n\nFigure 11 shows the realization 1100 according to another example, provides virtual PBX functional via phone AS here.This application can provide for example IP-based and autonomous PBX service to the enterprise customer.This application can the synthesis window widget selection be structured in (such as J2EE) on the industrial standard platform and operate in functional on the commercial hardware to provide;
