A work award is offered to students as part of their financial package and is determined annually by the FAFSA.\n\nFirst, identify if you have a work award assigned for the academic year. Students can do this by accessing SIS (the Student Information System) and following the steps listed below.\n\nGo to SIS.\n\nClick Financials.\n\nIn the drop down menu in the upper right corner, select ‘financial aid online’ and click the green ‘GO’ button.\n\nClick ‘connect to faid.stolaf.edu’\n\nUsing the menu in the upper left hand corner, select ‘Award Details’\n\nScroll to bottom under “student employment” – If an award is listed, a work award has been assigned and accepted. If no award is listed, check from the previous dropdown menu to determine if an award is offered AND accepted. If no award is offered, the student must contact financial aid to request a work award.\n\nIf you do not have a work award assigned, you may make a request with Financial Aid (finaid@stolaf.edu) to have a work award added. If your financial profile does not allow for a work award to be added, you will NOT be eligible to participate with the student employment program.\n\nStudents are required to complete safety training each academic year and summer they work on campus. Trainings are administered by the Office of Environmental Health and Safety.\n\nTo complete training, please visit Safety Training Moodle Course\n\nMoodle Course Directions: Click “Enroll me” at the bottom of the page.

If you are an employee of the college, your pay stub will be from “St. Olaf College.”\n\nHow can I document and track my time off?\n\nStarting January 1, 2024, all time will be tracked in Oracle, our new St. Olaf enterprise system. This coincides with staff employed by the college (such as hourly employees and student employees) entering their time into Oracle starting the new year. View Oracle updates at stolaf.edu/oracle.\n\nThis new time recording process is being created as an addition into our Oracle system and will be available for you to enter your sick/safe time use sometime in January (not yet prepared for January 1).\n\nHow much sick and safe time can employees earn with this new benefit?\n\nAn employee earns one hour of sick and safe time for every 30 hours worked and can earn a maximum of 48 hours each year.\n\nTransportation information can be found here – Getting Around Northfield\n\nOles-Go\n\nOles-Go provides daytime transportation in Northfield for students to get to volunteer, medical appointments, pharmacy trips, or work locally.
