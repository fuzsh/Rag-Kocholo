        "text": "NEW YORK, April 17, 2023 — Deloitte today announced the expansion of its operating system for health care to include implement, operate and advisory services for Oracle, a leading provider of operational and clinical technology for hospitals and health care systems worldwide. Deloitte’s expanding health care technology offerings, Deloitte Health – Oracle Accelerated, are designed to keep pace with the changing world of health care, which is moving into broad ecosystems and platforms, and shifting from being driven by hospitals, providers, or insurance companies to being driven by patients.\n\nAs the industry transforms from responsive sick care to proactive wellness, the medical field needs to meet patients where they are — through mobile access and data portability and supporting providers looking to overcome thin margins and workforce challenges. In the current environment, the health care delivery system can benefit from Deloitte’s industry know-how and Oracle’s extensive portfolio of technology, which is uniquely positioned to become the operating system for health care.\n\nA long-time Oracle PartnerNetwork (OPN) member, Deloitte is working with Oracle Health to provide clients a future-ready health care delivery system through five immediate priority initiatives created to:\n\nModernize the Core: assisting health care organizations as they implement, operate and support a modern electronic health record (EHR) platform.\n\nRationalize and Enable Cloud Evolution: migrating clients to Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI), and rationalizing infrastructure and applications.\n\nImprove Performance and Automate Workflows: leveraging Deloitte assets and capabilities to achieve full potential of OCI and data to improve operational and clinical workflows and outcomes.\n\nRealize Business/Operations Efficiencies: improving the back-office by integrating enterprise resource planning, clinical and human resources data together to provide operational insights.\n\nDrive AI-powered Insights and Actions: enable operations of an intelligent health system with optimized digital-provider and consumer workflow experiences.\n\nSome of these initiatives are already having tangible market impacts. A large health system, and an innovative leading specialty center are engaging Deloitte Health – Oracle Accelerated for EHR, back-office transformation, AI, data, analytics and insights.\n\n“As health care continues to shift toward patient-driven, wellness care, we believe it’s important to align our offerings with the future of health care, and to lead our Oracle clients toward increasing degrees of digital transformation and human-centric, intelligent care delivery,” said Hashim Simjee, global Oracle health care leader, and principal, Deloitte Consulting LLP. “Our goal is to empower consumers to control their own health care journeys while giving providers the means to deliver both better human and financial outcomes.”\n\n“Collaboration across the entire ecosystem will be critical to making health care more efficient, holistic, accessible and equitable,” said Stephanie Trunzo, senior vice president and general manager, Oracle Health. It takes organizations like Deloitte, and communities, organizations, innovators to empower health care clinicians to provide better care.”\n\nFor additional information on how organizations could make the shift to building interconnected forward-looking digital systems, and how Deloitte’s health care and technology experience accelerates the potential for organizations to transform into modern health care delivery systems, powered by Oracle technologies, visit us here.\n\nAbout Oracle\n\nOracle offers integrated suites of applications plus secure, autonomous infrastructure in the Oracle Cloud.
