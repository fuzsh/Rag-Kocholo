We exist to count everyone and are on a mission to systematically embed inclusion and diversity into all aspects of our workforce, measurement and products. We enthusiastically invite candidates who share that mission to join us.\n\nWe are proud to be an Equal Opportunity/Affirmative Action-Employer, making decisions without regard to race, color, religion, gender, gender identity or expression, sexual orientation, national origin, genetics, disability status, age, marital status, protected veteran status or any other protected class. Our global non-discrimination policy covers these protected classes in every market in which we do business worldwide.\n\nPlease note: If you are a qualified individual with a disability, you may request a reasonable accommodation if you are unable or limited in your ability to complete an online application. Please contact us to inform us of your needs.\n\nNotice on Fraudulent Job Offers\n\nIt has been brought to our attention that there have been fraudulent job offers, purporting to be from Nielsen and/or its affiliates. These individuals are contacting people with fraudulent employment opportunities and often asking for sensitive personal information, including making financial payments. This is a practice known as recruitment fraud.\n\nWhat is recruitment fraud?\n\nRecruitment fraud is a sophisticated scam offering fake job opportunities to job seekers. This type of fraud is typically carried out through online services such as false websites or fake e-mails or another form of communication claiming to be from the company. The fraudsters often request confidential personal information and to make financial payments as part of their fake recruitment process.\n\nHow to identify recruitment fraud?\n\nThere is an early request for personal information such as address details, date of birth, CV, passport details, bank details etc.\n\nCandidates are requested to contact other companies/individuals such as lawyers, bank officials, travel agencies, courier companies, visa/immigration processing agencies etc.\n\nCorrespondence may contain typographical and grammatical errors.\n\nE-mail correspondence is often sent from (or to) free web-based e-mail accounts such as Yahoo.com, Yahoo.co.uk, Gmail.com, Googlemail.com, Live.com, WhatsApp, Telegram, etc.\n\nThe perpetrators frequently use mobile telephone numbers instead of official company numbers.\n\nThe perpetrators may even offer to pay a percentage of the fees requested and ask the candidate to pay the remaining amount.\n\nThere is an insistence on urgency for the applicant to act on the correspondence received.\n\nIf you believe you have been a victim of a fraudulent job offer, we advise that you contact the appropriate local authorities.\n\nNielsen does not collect any financial commitment from candidates as a pre-employment requirement. All Nielsen applicants are required to only apply for Nielsen jobs through www.nielsen.com/careers/\n\nNielsen bears no responsibility for any fraudulent employment offer and advises following the above-mentioned guidance."
