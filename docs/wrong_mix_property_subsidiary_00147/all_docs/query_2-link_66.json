        "text": "Give feedback\n\nThe National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) prohibits the use of equipment manufactured by a limited set of Chinese manufacturers. Read on for details on how to work with the Office of Information Assurance to discontinue use of products from banned manufacturers.\n\nBackground\n\nBeginning in 2019, The National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) introduced prohibitions on the use of equipment manufactured by a limited set of Chinese manufacturers.\n\n2020 Update: More Manufacturers Added\n\nThis set of companies was expanded in the most recent 2020 NDAA. A list of banned companies is below.\n\nWhy NDAA Compliance Matters: Effects on Funding\n\nAny organization acting as a contractor for any federal agency must comply with this prohibition in order to receive any funding from the federal government.\n\nThis prohibition is not limited to programs that perform contracted work, but to UC San Diego’s entire enterprise. A UC systemwide memo on this matter has been published by the Office of the President at: https://researchmemos.ucop.edu/index.php/site/memoDetail/memo_id/RPAC-20-05.\n\nYour Role: Work with OIA to Discontinue Use of Prohibited Equipment\n\nThe Office of Information Assurance (OIA) uses information drawn from network management data to identify equipment on the UC San Diego network in violation of this prohibition. When identified the individual responsible for the equipment will be contacted and a remediation plan developed. In general such equipment must be promptly removed from the network.\n\nIf you are using equipment manufactured by any of the prohibited companies, please contact us immediately before removing it. The regulations can be difficult to interpret and we can assist in the determination of whether your equipment is covered.\n\nFor assistance please contact oia-rc@ucsd.edu.\n\nAdditional Information\n\nThis prohibition extends to the use of cell phones manufactured by the prohibited vendors for university business. This is primarily significant for staff members using Huawei phones. These may not be used for university business.\n\nVideo surveillance or security cameras are explicitly mentioned in the NDAA. Please consider this when purchasing any new video equipment.\n\nIn addition, the use of Kaspersky software, a common producer of commercial anti-virus software, has been prohibited since 2017. In order to ensure continued compliance, In October the campus will implement a network block preventing updates to Kaspersky servers from taking place.\n\nAdditional Resources\n\nhttps://www.getscw.com/knowledge-base/the-ban\n\nhttps://researchmemos.ucop.edu/index.php/site/memoDetail/memo_id/RPAC-20-05.\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/19/business/huawei-us-court.html\n\nhttps://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2020/07/14/2020-15293/federal-acquisition-regulation-prohibition-on-contracting-with-entities-using-certain\n\nProhibited Manufacturers\n\nOIA strives to maintain a list of prohibited manufacturers; however, the federal government adds companies on a continuing basis. Consider the list below provisional – it may be over- and under-inclusive in some respects. UC San Diego personnel are responsible, at the time of equipment purchase, to refer to the list and ensure the manufacturer has not been added. Contact oia-rc@ucsd.edu if you’re unsure or have other questions.\n\nHuawei Technologies Company\n\nSource: Business databases, Huawei Investment & Holding Co., Ltd., 2017 Annual Report\n\nAmartus, SDN Software Technology and Team\n\nBeijing Huawei Digital Technologies, Co.
