Now, he's also the world's seventh richest man and has a net worth of $160 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.\n\nThe billionaire's fortunes have surged by $14 billion thanks to spiking demand for generative AI. The windfall puts him ahead of tech execs like Google cofounder Sergey Brin and former Microsoft chief executive Steve Ballmer.\n\nThe 79-year-old started Oracle in 1977, and decades later he's still one of the top dogs in Silicon Valley despite living in Hawaii full time — and owning an entire island. Ellison has also been a major investor in Tesla, Salesforce, and even reportedly had a seat on Apple's board of directors for a while.\n\nThis story is available exclusively to Business Insider subscribers. Become an Insider and start reading now. Have an account? .\n\nOutside the office, the billionaire boasts an impressive watch collection and indulges in hobbies like yacht racing. His children have made their own names in the film industry, and his son David Ellison is set to become the CEO of Paramount after its merger with his Skydance Media production company.\n\nHere's a look at the life and career of Ellison so far.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLawrence Joseph Ellison was born in the Bronx on August 17, 1944, the son of a single mother named Florence Spellman.\n\nWhen he was 9 months old, Larry came down with pneumonia, Vanity Fair reported. His mom sent him to Chicago to live with his aunt and uncle, Lillian and Louis Ellison.\n\nVanity Fair reported that Louis, his adoptive father, was a Russian immigrant who took the name \"Ellison\" in tribute to the place in which he entered the US: Ellis Island.\n\nEllison is a college dropout.\n\nEllison went to high school in Chicago's South Side before attending the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. When his adoptive mother died during his second year at college, Ellison dropped out. He tried college again later at the University of Chicago but dropped out again after only one semester, Vanity Fair reported.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn 1966, a 22-year-old Ellison moved to Berkeley, California — near what would become Silicon Valley and already the place where the tech industry was taking off.\n\nHe made the trip from Chicago to California in a flashy turquoise Thunderbird that he thought would make an impression in his new life, Vanity Fair reported.\n\nEllison bounced around from job to job, including stints at companies like Wells Fargo and the mainframe manufacturer Amdahl. Along the way, he learned computer and programming skills.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn 1977, Ellison and partners Bob Miner and Ed Oates founded a new company, Software Development Laboratories.\n\nThe company started with $2,000 of funding.\n\nEllison and company were inspired by IBM computer scientist Edgar F. Codd's theories for a so-called relational database — a way for computer systems to store and access information, Britannican said. Nowadays, they're taken for granted, but in the '70s, they were a revolutionary idea.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe first version of the Oracle database was version 2 — there was no version 1.\n\nIn 1979, the company renamed itself Relational Software Inc., and in 1982, it formally became Oracle Systems Corp., after its flagship product.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn 1986, Oracle had its initial public offering, reporting revenue of $55 million.\n\nAs one of the key drivers of the growing computer industry, Oracle grew fast. The company is responsible for providing the databases in which businesses track information that is crucial to their operations.\n\nEllison became a billionaire at age 49. Now, he has a net worth of roughly $152 billion, according to Forbes, after racking up $50 billion in gains thanks to Oracle and Tesla stock. That makes him the seventh-richest person in the world.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStill, in 1990, Oracle had to lay off 10% of its workforce, about 400 people, because of what Ellison later described as \"an incredible business mistake.\"\n\nOracle reported a loss of $36 million in September 1990 after admitting that it had miscalculated its revenue earlier that year, The New York Times reported.\n\nIt didn't get the decade off to a great start. After adjusting for that error, Oracle was said to be close to bankruptcy. At the same time, rivals like Sybase were eating away at Oracle's market share.\n\nIt took a few years, but by 1992, Ellison and Oracle managed to right the course with new employees and the popular Oracle7 database.\n\nEllison is known for his willingness to trash-talk competitors.\n\nFor much of the '90s, he and Oracle were locked in a public-relations battle with the competitor Informix, which went so far as to place a \"Dinosaur Crossing\" billboard outside Oracle's Silicon Valley offices at one point, Fortune reported in 1997.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHis financial success has led to some expensive hobbies.\n\nWith Ellison as Oracle's major shareholder, his millions kept rolling in. He started to indulge in some expensive hobbies — including yacht racing. That's Ellison at the helm during a 1995 race.\n\nHe also partly financed the BMW Oracle USA sailing team, which won the America's Cup in 2010, according to Bloomberg.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEllison was an early investor in Salesforce.\n\nIn 1999, Ellison's protégé, Marc Benioff, left Oracle to work on a new startup called Salesforce.com. Ellison was an early investor, putting $2 million into his friend's new venture.\n\nWhen Benioff found out that Ellison had Oracle working on a direct competitor to Salesforce's product, he tried to force his mentor to quit Salesforce's board. Instead, Ellison forced Benioff to fire him — meaning Ellison kept his shares in Salesforce.\n\nGiven that Salesforce is now a $267 billion company, Ellison personally profits even when his competitors do well. It has led to a love-hate relationship between the two executives that continues to this day, with the two taking shots at each other in the press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe dot-com boom of the late '90s benefited Oracle.\n\nAll of those new dot-com companies needed databases, and Oracle was there to sell them. Although investors lost out in the dot-com crash, Oracle came out of it stronger due to its acquisitions and the demand for software solutions.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWith the coffers overflowing, Ellison was able to lead Oracle through a spending spree once the dot-com boom was over and prices were low.\n\nIn 2005, for example, Oracle snapped up the HR software provider PeopleSoft for $10.3 billion.\n\nAnd in 2010, Oracle completed its acquisition of Sun Microsystems, a server company that started at about the same time as Oracle, in 1982. That acquisition gave Oracle lots of key technology, including control over the popular MySQL database.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEllison has also spent lavishly over the years, so much so that his accountant, Philip Simon, once asked him to \"budget and plan,\" according to Bloomberg.\n\nEllison has expensive taste. Over the years he's built up an impressive collection of Richard Mille watches, an expert previously told BI.
