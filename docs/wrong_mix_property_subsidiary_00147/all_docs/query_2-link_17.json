        "text": "Since 1993, our 100% organically grown fiber backbone has powered the world’s biggest brands. From startup to Fortune 500, we have the scalability, reach and reliability for your business to thrive.\n\nOur fiber network spans 75,000 kilometers across Europe, North America, and Asia, providing a direct connection to more than 2,750 wholesale customers and a single hop to critical Internet routes. And with 450 local access partners worldwide, we are the backbone of your business.\n\nWe have a world-class Net Promoter Score (NPS) score of 72 and once our customers connect with us, they rarely leave - a testament to our unwavering customer service?\n\nBy taking full ownership from order to operation, and with intimate local knowledge of the markets we serve, our global delivery team works hard to ensure our services work seamlessly for you - wherever you are.\n\nMulti-cloud adoption leverages the unique value proposition of different cloud providers. To do this successfully, though, complex connectivity solutions towards the various cloud providers should be avoided. Only then can best possible infrastructure for developers and DevOps teams be realized.\n\nFounded in 2001, Ankama, the online gaming production company and one of France’s top digital companies, has been a long-standing Arelion customer. The company chose to use Cloud Connect to help with full-migration to AWS.\n\nFor the most demanding end-users in the world, G-Core Labs set out to build the most advanced content delivery network in the world. But to do it, they would need to balance high-performance on a massive scale with the flexibility to adapt to unpredictable growth and demand.\n\nDiscover how we helped a global bank elevate its operations in Europe and US with an integrated global connectivity solution that delivers smart, predictable performance – with the granular visibility and centralized control it needs.\n\nIP Transit is a wholesale Internet access service which facilitates access for AS networks to the rest of the Internet via the border gateway protocol (BGP). This guide explains how it works.\n\nThe public Internet is a complex mesh of almost one hundred thousand different, but ‘open’ network. At the core of the Internet is the Internet backbone provider. Here you can find out more about its fundamental principles.\n\nDWDM has played an important role in optical networks, and increased the data capacity and utilization of the physical fiber dramatically. DWDM technology is based on the combination and transmission of multiple optical signals, with dedicated wavelengths simultaneously using the same fiber cable. Here’s how it works…\n\nCloud Connect is a secure and reliable connection between an organization’s IT infrastructure and cloud computing services. Organizations access cloud resources (such as storage, computing power, and applications) seamlessly using a private connection, just as if they were using their own data centers.\n\nDDoS attack stands for \"Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attack\" and refers to a bombardment of an Internet entity with a huge amount of data traffic in order to destabilize the system and disturb regular data flow.\n\nBorder Gateway Protocol (BGP) is effectively the universal navigation system of the Internet, a digital postal service that provides the necessary routing information for public Internet networks, or autonomous systems (AS) to steer traffic to each other.
