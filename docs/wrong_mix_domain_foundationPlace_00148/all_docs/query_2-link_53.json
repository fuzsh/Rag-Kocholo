        "text": "As the citizens of southeastern Turkey and other affected countries struggle to survive the ravages of a 7.8 magnitude earthquake that struck earlier this week — the region’s biggest quake in over a century — now, more than ever, it becomes crucial to support our global communities. We are deeply saddened for all of those affected by this disaster, and, as in the past, we are doing all we can to help those in need. At Acronis, we have begun our immediate response efforts to help, including a fundraising campaign with the Acronis Cyber Foundation Program and our charitable partner Groundbreaker.\n\n“We join the world in mourning the lives lost and the devastation caused by the 7.8 magnitude earthquake which affected southeastern Turkey and other countries in the region,” said Acronis CEO Patrick Pulvermueller. “We have over 100 employees in Turkey and have reached out to confirm that all are safe. Many of you have asked if we will be mobilizing our Foundation team to support those in need, and the short answer is YES.”\n\nThis earthquake claimed thousands of lives while injuring and displacing several thousand others. The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) gives this disaster a 78% chance of causing more than $1 billion in damages, mainly due to buildings and structures not being built to withstand high-magnitude earthquakes. Humanitarian efforts are especially critical right now as this region is suffering financial and political hardships, hindering government efforts to supply sufficient aid. This is where we come in — with your help.\n\nHumanitarian Aid:\n\nThe Acronis Cyber Foundation Program altogether with the Antalya Governorship Provincial Directorate of Migration Management will support more than 1,000 people by providing beds, blankets, pillows, sheets, clothes, boots, raincoats, diesel, water, tents, electric cookers, and more necessary supplies. These materials will be distributed among survivors as they start to rebuild their lives. Local Acronis team members are currently organizing these efforts in Istanbul together with our partner, Arena Bilgisayar A.S., who is helping with logistics.\n\nAcronis employees have gathered in Turkey to volunteer with the Acronis Cyber Foundation Program. Together, they have helped to buy supplies for kitchens that will serve food to victims of the earthquake. Volunteers have assisted in sorting and loading trucks at the Ataşehir Municipality Disaster Coordination Center. All goods are currently on the way to four of the impacted cities, including Hatay, Adiyaman, Kahramanmaras and Malatya.\n\nWe are addressing the humanitarian aid request by the Investment Office of the Presidency of the Republic of Turkey by supplying mattresses to 1,000+ people who lost their homes. We are working closely with Ministry of Interior Disaster and Emergency Management Presidency (“AFAD”) on this initiative.\n\nAnd together with our Turkish partner, Komtera, we are organizing container shelters — a quick and flexible solution for families who lost everything from the earthquake tragedy. About 100 people will have access to temporary, climate-controlled homes equipped with a sanitary facility, kitchen and sleeping space to stay warm during the freezing winter days and nights.\n\nFundraising:\n\nAs mentioned above, we are teaming up with our local partners and government agencies to provide essential supplies to support the humanitarian aid efforts. The Acronis Cyber Foundation Program and Groundbreaker have setup a donation page that allows you to contribute financially in USD or Euros.\n\nClick here to donate in USD.\n\nClick here to donate in Euros.\n\nRecurring donations are accepted and encouraged. With the help and generosity of others, this region can rebuild from this disaster. Together we can give much-needed relief and aid to those who are injured or have lost family or housing.\n\nWe appreciate the unwavering support and exceptional work from Acronis employees and partners as we do everything in our power to assist in humanitarian efforts during this difficult time.\n\nTo those countries and communities affected, we are here for you.\n\nUpdate:\n\nNow, in this second week of March, the Acronis Cyber Foundation Program continues to stand with Turkey. When the world seems darkest, there are always those whose compassionate actions light a path to happiness and prosperity. Below are the stories of two Acronis employees and what they have done to make these hard times easier for those most affected:\n\nAcronis Senior Software Developer Nikolay Petrov's story: from active cave rescuer to responder."
