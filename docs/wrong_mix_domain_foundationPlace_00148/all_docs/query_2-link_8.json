        "text": "It’s always nice to mark special occasions with friends and family. Acronis was reminded of that pleasure today as we held the first of several celebrations to mark our 15th Anniversary. Surrounded by our partners, customers and a host of special guests, we hosted a gala event at our newly expanded corporate headquarters in Schaffhausen, Switzerland.\n\nNot every company successfully competes – let alone leads – in their industry for 15 years, so Acronis is pleased to take a few moments to celebrate our successes.\n\nFounded in Singapore in 2003 and incorporated in Switzerland five years later, Acronis has since grown into a global leader in cyber protection, delivering backup, recovery, hybrid cloud storage and cutting-edge data protection to businesses and home users around the world.\n\n“Since the release of our first product in 2003, we’ve focused on making data protection easy, reliable, efficient, secure, private, and accessible to all. Today we are celebrating 15 years of Acronis, which has been filled with innovation and market-leading solutions, providing exceptional cyber protection to millions of users worldwide,” said Acronis co-founder and CEO Serg Bell.\n\nLots of friends gathered for Acronis' 15th Anniversary kick-off event\n\nOur headquarters in Schaffhausen is vital to the company’s ability to compete, giving members of our executive team the global perspective needed to enhance the company’s position worldwide. As we celebrate our 15th Anniversary, its role becomes even more important, which is part of the reason this event was held there.\n\nAnother reason was that the Swiss gala was planned to coincide with the Formula E Zürich ePrix. Given Acronis’ long-standing involvement with motorsports – including its partnership with the Renault e.dams Formula E team – it was a great opportunity to have team members among the specially invited guests, so they could talk about why data is so critical to motorsport, and how Acronis’ solutions are helping them compete on the track.\n\nAcronis President John Zanni with Renault e.dams Formula E driver Sebastien Buemi\n\nAnyone interested in exploring the company’s history can review Acronis’ technological and corporate milestones on a new 15th-anniversary website, which launched as part of the Schaffhausen event.\n\nThe anniversary site also includes a section for congratulations where we share well wishes that customers, partners, and colleagues have offered for its 15 years of success. You can read the messages and watch videos submitted by our partners. There’s even a way to send your own greetings.\n\nIn addition to celebrating Acronis’ past accomplishments, the anniversary gala in Schaffhausen saw the announcement of an exciting new project.\n\nCalled Singularity City, the new Acronis initiative proposes to build a university, research center and technology park to promote industry-driven research and computer science. The university will focus on artificial intelligence, quantum computing, and blockchain; and the technology park will provide incubation for startups.\n\nThe Swiss celebration was also an opportunity for Acronis to introduce customers and partners to the recently announced Acronis Foundation. Created in honor of Acronis’ 15-year anniversary, the non-profit organization supports initiatives around the world designed to stimulate education to gain and protect knowledge.\n\nBell explained that the Foundation’s mission is a direct reflection of the company’s founding. “Acronis is founded on the principle of optimism that all evils are caused by insufficient knowledge. Knowledge is data, and by protecting data Acronis protects knowledge.”\n\nThe Foundation’s first project, the Acronis Schools Initiative, will commemorate the company’s 15-year anniversary by funding the construction of 15 new schools in underserved communities around the globe during the next three years.\n\nOther programs the Foundation is supporting includes IT training for prisoners in Singapore to help reduce recidivism, educational programs in communities where the company has R&D facilities, and university programs in the fields of science and technology.\n\nAttendees got the chance to learn about the recently launched Acronis Foundation\n\nWhile the Swiss gala was the first-anniversary event, the company plans other celebrations throughout the year, including another gala at Acronis’ international headquarters in Singapore this September.\n\nThe gathering in Singapore will be timed around the Singapore Formula 1 Grand Prix. As part of the festivities, our partners from Williams-Martini Formula 1 Racing will join us as we discuss how artificial intelligence and big data are changing the world of motorsport. It’ll be a great networking opportunity and unique race experience, as attendees get the chance to meet Formula 1 drivers, IT engineers, Acronis executives and R&D scientists all in one place.\n\nStay tuned for more news as Acronis celebrates 15 years of protecting data."
