        "text": "Acronis, a global leader in cybersecurity and data protection, today announced that Paul Maritz has been appointed as the Chairman of the Board of Directors, effective 21 September 2021. Maritz will be responsible for the governance and leadership of Acronis as it strengthens its position in the service provider market preparing for significant growth in the future.\n\nEarlier this year, Acronis raised $250M at a $2.5B valuation and announced former GoDaddy’s partner business president, Patrick Pulvermüller, as the new chief executive officer. The strengthened management team will use the momentum to provide Acronis’ partners with the tools that they need to deal with a rapidly changing digital world.\n\nThe challenge of providing MSPs with effective tools to manage the environments of their customers is becoming increasingly complex, particularly in a world where security is becoming an overwhelming issue. Security can no-longer be handled by having an SMB end customer put together a plethora of individual tools. Modern threats have exposed the need for an integrated approach and automated cyber protection that solves the safety, accessibility, privacy, authenticity and security (SAPAS) challenges of the modern digital world.\n\nAcronis Cyber Protect provides all the management tools of the future that service providers need to do an effective job for their customers to help them grow their business. As well as developing its own technology, Acronis will continue to make acquisitions to become one of the world’s major players of providing the most innovative backup, security and management tools on the market. Over 12,000 service providers trust Acronis Cyber Protect to manage over 2,000,000 workloads around the world, positioning Acronis for even more company growth in the future.\n\n“Paul brings a wealth of experience developing products to meet market demands and take companies to the next level. Him becoming Chairman represents another step forward for Acronis in solidifying its position as a global leader in cyber protection. Paul’s experience with innovations at scale will help us to continue delivering easy, efficient and secure cyber protection to service providers and their customers of any size,” said Patrick Pulvermüller, Acronis CEO.\n\n“With its strength in backup and security, Acronis is well positioned to build a platform for a comprehensive list of management tools, helping service providers deliver modern cyber protection to their customers today and in the future. Acronis Cyber Protect is a great example of what can be done. Acronis will continue extensive research and development in this direction, helping partners optimise their operations and stay ahead of the competition,” said Paul Maritz, Acronis Chairman of the Board.\n\nMaritz first joined the Acronis Board of Directors in May 2021, bringing 40 years of experience in computer science and software to the cyber protection company.\n\nIn his previous executive roles, Paul served on the Executive Staff of Microsoft, was the CEO of VMware and was CEO and Founder of Pivotal Software. Paul currently is an active investor and serves on the Boards of several start-up technology companies.\n\nPaul graduated with a degree in Mathematics and Computer Science from the Universities of Natal and Cape Town. He is active in the nonprofit world, served for ten years on the Board of the Grameen Foundation, which supports financial inclusion and technology in the developing world and supports conservation efforts in Africa.\n\nPaul Maritz replaces René Bonvanie, whose leadership helped Acronis develop an effective strategy to expand global presence and deliver easy, efficient and secure cyber protection to customers of any size. Acronis wishes to thank René Bonvanie for his contribution to the company development and growth."
