        "text": "The Escuela Official Urbana Mixta San Antonio is a school center consisting of one preschool, one primary school, and two secondary schools. Previously, the school’s 525 students shared just 10 classrooms, leading to significant overcrowding. In 2019, the Acronis Cyber Foundation along with Cloudfest extended the existing school building with the construction of five new classrooms. This did a lot to relieve overcrowded classes, but the school was still limited on spare room and lacked modern facilities.\n\nIn 2021, we went even further with some help from our friends at GoDaddy Pro, building four additional classrooms, a toilet unit, and proper stairs for the school’s 525 students.\n\nHowever, the Acronis Cyber Foundation knows that the best way to set students up for lifelong success is with a modern education — and that means access to technology. Our next goal is to establish a computer classroom for the school, so that the children can receive educational resources and opportunities that will change their lives and the lives of their families. Join us in our mission and donate today to bring a brighter future to the kids in Guatemala!\n\nAntigua Guatamala is known as one of the best-preserved Spanish colonial cities in Central America. It has been designated as a UNESCO World Heritage site. The historical town, with its cobblestone streets at every turn, handicraft shops, and good restaurants and coffee places, is worth at least a few days visit.\n\nTip: The city is 40 minutes from Guatemala International airport by car/taxi and it’s wise to go there right after arrival.\n\nPhoto: Unsplash\n\nThe best view of Lake Atitlan is from the San Pedro Volcano, 3,000 meters above sea level. The hike is quite challenging and takes about five hours, round trip. The entrance costs 100 quetzales, which includes a local guide.\n\nTip: There are many mosquitos on the hiking trail. Don’t forget about proper clothes and repellents. Even if you travel on a hot day, it might be cool and windy at the top of the volcano and a long-sleeve jacket is worth bringing.\n\nPhoto: Pexels"
