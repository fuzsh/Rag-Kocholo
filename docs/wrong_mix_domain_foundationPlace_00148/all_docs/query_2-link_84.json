        "text": "Diversity promotes higher employee engagement and reduces employee turnover. A safe and inclusive environment makes employees feel safe and more productive, which is in turn, beneficial for the company.\n\nAs a part of our series “How Diversity Can Increase a Company’s Bottom Line”, I had the pleasure of interviewing Aliona Geckler, the SVP of Business Operations and Chief of Staff at Acronis.\n\nAs SVP of Business Operations and Chief of Staff, Aliona is responsible for the CEO’s operations and rhythm of business, overseeing internal communications, Acronis culture, corporate initiatives, and special cross-company projects. With a passion for diversity and inclusion, Aliona launched multiple programs to elevate women’s careers, create opportunities, and grow talent within the Acronis community. Before joining Acronis in early 2019, Aliona spent 11 years at Microsoft, serving as a Chief of Staff for Global Services at Microsoft HQ and leading several divisions including Microsoft Services and Microsoft Business Solutions.
