        "text": "This June, the Acronis Cyber Foundation opened a new school in Nuevo Chimbote, Peru. This is the sixth school Acronis has helped open. The Virgen de las Gracias school will provide a quality educational environment, including free education, learning materials, uniforms, and lunch for about 230 children, chosen from among the neediest in the community.\n\nThe Virgen de las Gracias school will now have eight classrooms that will provide educational services to 100 new students. Additionally, their new school will house one meeting room, proper sanitary facilities for boys, girls, and teachers, and an improved schoolyard for sport, dance, and theater lessons. The school was constructed with durable materials to withstand the extreme local weather conditions and ensure sustainability into the future.\n\nCompared to other Latin American countries, education in Peru falls short. There are many reasons for this, including the high costs of matriculation and school uniforms, the lack of sanitary facilities, early pregnancies, child labor, and poor learning outcomes. Only 548 educational institutions in the region are in good condition, and only 18 percent of those schools in good condition are located in Santa and Nuevo Chimbote.\n\nThe Acronis Cyber Foundation supports programs around the world that create, spread, and protect knowledge. The Foundation’s School Initiative helps provide underserved communities with the educational infrastructure they lack. The Acronis Cyber Foundation has pledged to construct 15 school buildings in three years."
