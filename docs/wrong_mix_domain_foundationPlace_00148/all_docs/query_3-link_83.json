I’ve enjoyed my time at Saracens and made some lifelong friendships and great memories. Thank you to all of the fans for their unwavering support and best wishes for when I have been away on international duty.”\n\nDirector of Rugby Alex Austerberry also thanked Moore for her efforts in a Saracens shirt.\n\n“People’s time at Saracens last for different amounts of time. I really wish Grace the best in the next phase of her career. I truly believe she has all the attributes to take her game to another level and I look forward to seeing her and doing combat with her next season as she makes the move to Trailfinders.”"
