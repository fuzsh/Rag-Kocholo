        "text": "Agriculture\n\nFinca Alta Gracia is a one-of-a-kind resource both environmentally and culturally in the Dominican Republic. The farm spans about 230 acres, offering a refuge for wildlife, like the threatened Bicknell Thrush. It is also the start of the most important watershed on the island, offering an incredible educational and stewardship opportunity (from mountains to sea). Coffee, macadamia, citrus, bamboo, among other plants grow on our farm.\n\nThe Mariposa Mountain School\n\nWith the assistance of RNT Rausch and the Acronis Cyber Foundation, we built a first-class educational center in Los Maranitos using our model of girls education to support girls and help them break the cycle of generational poverty through education. Programming includes academic courses, academic tutoring, and environmental education, including a teaching garden."
