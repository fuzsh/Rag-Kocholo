        "text": "Acronis, the global leader in cyber protection, today reconfirmed its commitment to supporting local communities through its corporate social responsibility (CSR) programs and providing volunteering opportunities to its employees, developing their personal and professional growth.\n\nWhen a company is committed to becoming an integral part of the community, it seeks various avenues to contribute. Acronis has actively engaged in developing educational initiatives and supporting learning worldwide. In Bulgaria, our local team has established connections with educational organizations, donating books and providing training. This year our company contributed 25 laptops to “GEO Milev” secondary school in Tran and another 25 laptops to “Bratya Miladinovi” Third Primary School in Gotse Delchev.\n\n“I express gratitude on my behalf and on behalf of ‘GEO Milev’ Secondary School in Tran for the generous donation made to benefit our teachers and students. The 25 laptops donated by you, which ‘GEO Milev’ Secondary School in Tran received as a charitable gift from Acronis Bulgaria Ltd., will contribute to a better education for our students and enrich their opportunities for professional development. Your philanthropic gesture demonstrates your concern for the future of children and proves that those who invest in education are investing in the future. Thank you for extending your hand and for your care towards our students!” said Tsvetislava Tsvetkova, Mayor of Tran Municipality.\n\n“On behalf of all students and teachers, I express our immense gratitude for the generous donation! The laptops will support the educational process and contribute to the development of students in the field of information technology. Thank you for your attention!” said Nikola Jingarov, Director of III “Bratya Miladinovi” Primary School in Gotse Delchev.\n\nAs technology advances rapidly, companies often find themselves with surplus hardware. When these devices, such as laptops, reach the end of their lifecycle, many are still in perfect working condition. Here at Acronis, rather than disposing of them, we have chosen to donate these functional devices to local schools, benefiting children in need. This in turn forms a crucial part of our commitment to reduce our ecological footprint by reducing e-waste and supporting the local community.\n\nAcronis also provides a number of volunteering opportunities to employees who are looking for opportunities to engage in community projects as part of the Acronis Cyber Foundation Program.\n\nTo mark the Day of the Bulgarian Enlighteners on November 1st, Acronis volunteers joined forces to set up informative boards at the elementary and secondary School 34, ‘Stoyu Shishkov,’ in Sofia. These boards showcased the remarkable discoveries of Bulgarian scientists, each of which left an indelible mark on the world.\n\nEarlier this year, Acronis volunteers held a professional orientation day for primary school children, had multiple days out cleaning the area around Vitosha Mountain and Kambanite Park, and ran a craft workshop to raise funds for supporting a local orphanage.\n\nTo celebrate the holiday season and mark Acronis’ 20th anniversary, Acronis is running a special campaign to grant the wishes of 20 underprivileged children, pledging to double each donation.
