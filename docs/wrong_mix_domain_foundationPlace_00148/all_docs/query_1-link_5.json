        "text": "1 September, 2017. Just one week from now, the M100 Young European Journalists Workshop will begin! We look forward to inspiring workshops by our Trainers on the topic of “How to finance Independent Journalism – Education, Platforms, Business Models”. Our 15 participants from the Eastern Partnership countries Armenia, Azerbaijan, Belarus, Georgia, Moldova, and Ukraine, as well as from Russia, face challenges with freedom of press and independent journalism in their home countries. We therefore aim to support them and provide them with information about the financing options available in their home countries and on models that are suitable for their ideas and potential readers, enabling them to realise their journalistic projects and support democratic processes. For more information, find here the agenda of the #M100YEJ.\n\nThese are our amazing Workshop Trainers:\n\nBrigitte Alfter is a German-Danish journalist and covered European affairs for two decades on local, national and European level.
