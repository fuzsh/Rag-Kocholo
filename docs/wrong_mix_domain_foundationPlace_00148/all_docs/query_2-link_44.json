        "text": "October 2018\n\nSince Summer 2018, San Stefano Plaza has new tenants – the R&D network of Acronis, a global leader in cyber protection and hybrid cloud solutions. The cyber protection giant is trusted by more than 5 million consumers and 500,000 businesses worldwide, including 79 of the top 100 most valuable brands.\n\nOn October 16, the Bulgarian Deputy Prime Minister Tomislav Donchev and the Mayor of Sofia Municipality Yordanka Fandakova expressed greetings to Acronis at the grand opening of Acronic new European office. With the strategic location in the heart of Sofia, the innovative multifunctional complex San Stefano Plaza offers its new tenant great opportunities for growth while working with local universities and community organizations.\n\n“Acronis has continuously invested in research and development (R&D) to ensure providing customers with the best protection for their data, apps and systems using cutting-edge technologies. Now that R&D network is even larger since we just opened our new European office and R&D center in Sofia, Bulgaria. The strategic location will not only help us serve our European-based customers better, but the central location enables us to draw on the well-educated and dedicated technical talent pool the continent offers more easily“, Plamen Toshev, the Managing Director of Acronis Bulgaria, said.\n\nAcronis Bulgaria\n\nPreviewed earlier this year when Acronis committed to invest $50 million and create 300 high-tech jobs over the next three years in Sofia, the new Acronis Bulgaria office focuses on cyber protection technology, data center operations, and development of Acronis’ products and services. Like the company’s other Cyber Security Operations Centers located around the world, the Bulgarian office will monitor multiple data protection environments and provide vital intel to R&D engineers regarding the newest threats.\n\nDeveloping new tech talent\n\nThe team in Sofia currently consist of 30 engineers, but Acronis Bulgaria plans to expand that staff to 50 people by the end of 2018. As Acronis Bulgaria Managing Director Plamen Toshev explains, the goal is to draw on local talent, providing the necessary training and guidance to help the team members have a successful career as they grow into senior roles within the company.\n\n“We are set for growth as we offer unique software development opportunities in Sofia. We are looking for local talent and willing to help people reach their true potential,” Toshev said. A list of the positions currently open at the new office is available online.\n\nInternships and mentoring\n\n„As part of the launch of Acronis Bulgaria, we are also working with local universities and community organizations to run joint education projects. We’ve already engaged with Sofia University, and are looking to expand our academic partnerships. Run as an initiative of the Acronis Foundation, a non-profit focused on creating educational opportunities as a way to spread and protect knowledge, we’ll be offering internships and mentoring to software engineering and science students. Not only will these programs help students be more prepared to apply their skills in the real world, it will also create opportunities for new graduates who are looking for a career with a global IT company“, added Mr. Toshev. -.\n\n“Our goal is to get local students to work for us in Sofia instead of looking to work abroad. We offer great pay, a productive working environment, and incredibly interesting engineering problems. We are very likely to surpass our initial commitment to invest $50 million and create 300 jobs in Sofia. This office is going to become one of the company’s most important outposts along with those in the U.S., Switzerland, and Singapore,” Serguei Beloussov, co-founder and CEO of Acronis said.\n\nThe search is on"
