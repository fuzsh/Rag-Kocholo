        "text": "On January 1, 2024, while many of us around the world rang in the new year, a 7.6 magnitude earthquake left a path of destruction along the western coast of Japan. Citizens across Noto Peninsula faced devastating loss accompanied by the aftershocks and tsunami that followed.\n\nWith heavy hearts, Acronis Cyber Foundation Program and Groundbreaker wanted to help. Together, we launched a fundraising campaign to aid the recovery, clean up and rescue efforts in affected Ishikawa Prefecture communities. All proceeds collected from the campaign will directly benefit relief essentials, including shelter, food, clothes and hygiene products, for families and individuals who lost their homes in the wreckage.\n\nIf you’re interested in contributing to the campaign, please use the links below:\n\nDonate Now (For USD) or Donate Now (For EUR)\n\nIt’s in our DNA to help, and in what better way than in the industry we know best: cyber protection.\n\nTo support organizations affected by the 2024 Noto Peninsula Earthquake, Acronis is providing free deployment licenses for Acronis Snap Deploy, a product designed for larger enterprise OS deployment, disk imaging and kitting tools.
