Good evening,

How would you describe a company that's incorporated in the Seychelles islands?

2) A Seychelles company

2) A Seychellois company [pronounced in a French manner]

An example:

1) I'd like to set up a Turkish company that will fully belong to a Seychelles holding company / Seychellois holding company.

With kind regards,

JW

I'd say "a Seychelles company".

I believe Seychellois is the demonym, so you could use it, but it's not very commonly used as far as I know.

I've already noticed whenever I say "Seychellois" (as I'd say it in French) people do not really seem to understand what I'm even talking about. Either "Seychellois" or my French raises eyebrows.

(In fact, when I say "Seychelles" I give people a couple of seconds to recall what "Seychelles" is. The most common reply is "What's that" or "Sea shell what?").

In this case, I think "Seychelles company" is easier to understand. I'll stick to it.

Thank you.

Either. With many countries they'd be about equally common: a Mauritius company = a Mauritian company. The problem is just whether everyone knows the word 'Seychellois'. With more familiar countries we'd usually use the adjective, but as you go to less familiar, it becomes more difficult to know what the adjective is.
