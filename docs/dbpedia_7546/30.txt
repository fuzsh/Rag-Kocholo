The Seychelles, an archipelagic state in the Indian Ocean, is a nation that is as diverse as it is beautiful and its inhabitants – People of the Seychelles, known as Seychellois, number around 90,000, primarily residing on just three out of the country’s 115 islands. The capital and largest city, Victoria, situated on the main island of Mahé, is home to 90% of the total population, followed by Praslin and La Digue.

The Seychellois people can trace their roots to a rich blend of ethnic and national backgrounds, predominantly Creole descent, including influences from France, Africa, the UK, India, and China. This multicultural heritage has shaped a peaceful and harmonious society, where everyone stands on equal footing.

The Seychellois society reflects modern societal norms, similar to those in Europe, albeit with a more relaxed pace of life. It is common for children to be raised by their grandparents while their parents are employed professionally. Three official languages can be heard in the Seychelles: Creole, English, and French. Seychellois Creole, also known as Seselwa, is the most spoken. It is a blend of African languages like Swahili and Malagasy, with strong French influences.

The Seychellois Lifestyle

When it comes to clothing, comfort is key in Seychelles. Given the tropical climate, Seychellois people typically favor casual and comfortable attire like loose shirts, shorts, sundresses, and flip-flops. Bright and colorful clothes, often inspired by the islands’ stunning natural beauty, are also common.

However, the relaxed dress code does shift when it comes to religious services, particularly in Christian churches, which a majority of Seychellois attend. In the Seychelles, a harmonious coexistence of religions exemplifies the country’s rich cultural tapestry. Although predominantly Christian, Seychelles also cherishes significant Hindu and Muslim communities. The Hindu faith, brought by Indian immigrants, is vividly present in festivals like Diwali, while Islamic traditions, introduced by Arab traders, are respectfully observed. These faiths, alongside Christianity, coexist peacefully, fostering an atmosphere of mutual respect, thereby showcasing Seychelles’ spirit of religious harmony. During religious services, more formal attire is generally expected. Women often wear dresses or skirts, while men might opt for trousers and a button-down shirt.

The culture and lifestyle of the Seychellois people are marked by a relaxed approach to life, strong female presence in both the domestic and business environments, and a preference for casual and comfortable attire. These elements, combined with the islands’ natural beauty and serene environment, create a unique cultural blend that sets Seychelles apart from many other nations.

Traditions and Hobbies

Seychellois culture is a vibrant blend of many traditions and influences, creating a unique and lively cultural tapestry that is uniquely Seychellois. The people of Seychelles hold their traditions and hobbies close to their heart, making them an integral part of their everyday life and society as a whole.

Creole Traditions and Festivals

One of the most striking aspects of Seychellois culture is the vibrant Creole traditions, a synthesis of European, British, African, Indian, and Moorish influences. This rich cultural heritage is reflected in their language, Seychellois Creole, or Seselwa. The language was officially recognized in 1981 and is celebrated annually on Creole Day, part of the International Creole Festival, a week-long event that celebrates Creole heritage and traditions.

Festivals are an essential part of Seychellois life, with the people celebrating a plethora of events throughout the year. The Seychelles Carnival, a cultural extravaganza that attracts performers and tourists from across the globe, is one such festival. It is a vibrant celebration of diversity, featuring music, dance, colorful floats, and delicious local food.

Music and Dance

Music and dance are vital to Seychellois culture, with a rich tradition that dates back centuries. These art forms are used for storytelling, celebrating, and expressing emotions. The rhythms and melodies are often reminiscent of their African and European heritage.

One of the distinctive traditional instruments is the “zez,” a stringed instrument similar to a zither, played by plucking or strumming the strings. The “bonm,” a large drum made from hollowed tree trunks covered with stretched goat skin, provides a powerful rhythmic accompaniment. The “makalapo,” a stringed instrument made from a bamboo tube, and the “tam tam,” a small handheld drum, add to the rich musical tapestry.

The Moutya dance, performed to the rhythm of these traditional instruments, is a popular Seychellois dance style. The dancers move their bodies rhythmically to the beat, with rhymed chants providing a narrative or theme to the dance. This dance style often depicts stories of love, life, and the struggles of their ancestors.

Victoria Market and Local Crafts

Fishing is not just a hobby but a way of life in the Seychelles. As an archipelago, the islands are surrounded by rich marine life, making fishing both a popular pastime and a vital part of the local economy. From deep-sea fishing to traditional line fishing, the Seychellois have honed their skills over centuries. These fishing activities not only provide a livelihood for many locals but also contribute to the vibrant and fresh cuisine of the Seychelles.

The Seychellois people’s traditions and hobbies offer a fascinating insight into their rich cultural heritage, a blend of different cultures shaped by the islands’ history and environment. This rich cultural life is a testament to the Seychellois’ resilience and creativity.
