        "text": "Geography\n\nThe Seychelles are an archipelago in the Indian Ocean about 1500 km east of the African mainland. The dwarf state has a total area of only 460 km² (178 mi²) and a total coastline of 491 km (305.1 mi). This land area is about 2.6 times the size of Washington, D.C. The Seychelles are thus one of the smallest countries in Africa by area and ranked 202nd worldwide. More than half of all residents (58%) live within cities. More than every fifth resident lives in Victoria.\n\nThe highest elevation in the country (Morne Seychellois) is 905 meters. The archipelago consists of 115 islands. The Seychelles have no direct neighbors. The distance between New York City and the Capital Victoria is about 13,600 km (8,451 mi)."
