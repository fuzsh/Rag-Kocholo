        "text": "The Australian High Commission is pleased to announce that the Australian Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs, Senator the Honourable Amanda Vanstone has decided that from 1st November 2005, applications for student visas for Australia from holders of Seychelles passports will now be assessed against Student Assessment Level 2. This is a reduction of Assessment Level from 3 to 2.\n\nThis reduction will mean that students from Seychelles wishing to study in Australia will no longer have to sit an exam to show their English language proficiency before being considered for a student visa to Australia.\n\nThe reduction in Assessment Level reflects the fact that students from Seychelles are highly regarded by Australian authorities as well as recognising the high levels of English language fluency of the Seychellois people.\n\nWe note this issue was raised at senior levels with the Australian High Commissioner, H.E. Mr Ian McConville during his introductory calls in the Seychelles in 2004, and we are very pleased to be associated with this positive outcome.\n\nAny enquiries can be directed to the Australian High Commission in Mauritius on: telephone – +230 202 0160; or email – [email protected].\n\nPort Louis\n\n8 November 2005"
