        "text": "In Seychelles, seagrass is not only a nature-based solution to climate change – it’s a national treasure.\n\nIn 2021, Seychelles made a bold commitment to protect all of the seagrass in its national waters by 2030, as part of its climate commitment to the Paris Agreement. Seagrass meadows are known as nursery and foraging grounds for many marine species, as buffers against storm surges, and for their ability to lock carbon away in ocean sediments for hundreds of years.\n\nIn support of the country’s climate commitment, Seychelles launched a research project to produce the first field-validated map of all the country’s seagrass, with an accompanying carbon stock assessment.\n\nOne missing link remained – there were no unique words in the local language for seagrass. After a grass-roots national campaign led by the Seychelles Conservation and Climate Adaptation Trust, relevant and culturally appropriate words for seagrasses were added to the Seychellois Creole dictionary, the native language of Seychelles.\n\nThe video above highlights Seychelles’ successful campaign to protect its seagrass."
