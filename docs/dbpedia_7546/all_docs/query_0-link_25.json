        "text": "This page provides an overview of the key characteristics of Seychelles along its likely (or Current Path) development trajectory. The Current Path forecast from the International Futures forecasting (IFs) platform is a dynamic scenario that imitates the continuation of current policies and environmental conditions. The Current Path is therefore in congruence with historical patterns and produces a series of dynamic forecasts endogenised in relationships across crucial global systems. We use 2019 as a standard reference year and the forecasts generally extend to 2043 to coincide with the end of the third ten-year implementation plan of the African Union’s Agenda 2063 long-term development vision.\n\nThe Republic of Seychelles consists of 115 islands in the Indian Ocean. In addition to the 115 listed islands in the Constitution of Seychelles, there are additional seven reclaimed islands: Ile Perseverance, Ile Aurore, Romainville, Eden Island, Eve, Ile du Port and Ile Soleil. The country is found along the coastline of Somalia, with its capital, Victoria, 1 500 km east of mainland Africa. Its closest neighbours are the islands of Mauritius, Madagascar, Comoros and Reunion. The climate is tropical rain forests with annual rainfall ranging from 2 900 mm in Victoria to 3 600 mm on the mountain slopes.\n\nBefore gaining independence in 1976 from the UK, the country was colonised by the French, and fell into British control during the Napoleonic Wars. Following attempted coups d’état in 1981 and 1986, the constitution was revised in 1993 to adopt a multiparty system. In October 2020, the opposition leader Wavel Ramkalawan won the presidential election, marking the first peaceful transfer of presidential power between different political parties since independence in 1976. Seychelles is a member of the Southern Africa Development Community (SADC). In 2007, it concluded an Economic Partnership Agreement (EPA) with the European Union (EU), one of six countries in Eastern and Southern Africa together with Comoros, Madagascar, Mauritius, Zambia and Zimbabwe. The three official languages of Seychelles are French, English and Seychellois Creole, with Seychellois Creole the most widely spoken.\n\nSeychelles is the least populous sovereign country in Africa with a population of 97 500 in 2019. It has a high life expectancy at 74.6 years, low infant mortality rate of 9.8 deaths per live births, and low fertility rate of 2.46 live births per woman in 2020. People in Seychelles predominantly live in urban areas with an urbanisation rate of 58% in 2019, which will rise to 74% by 2043 owing to rural–urban migration and the growth of the urban population.\n\nThe US$1.6 billion economy is dominated by the service sector, accounting for 78%, and the manufacturing sector, accounting for 10.3% in 2019. With its beautiful islands and favourable climate, the tourism sector is undoubtedly the most important service sector, contributing 50% of GDP and 70% of total foreign exchange earnings. Its GDP per capita is the highest in Africa at US$30 673 in 2019, making it the only high-income economy in the continent. Despite a low unemployment rate at 8.3%, the poverty rate at US$22.70 per day (the World Bank poverty rate for high-income countries) is high at 48.2% of the population in 2019.\n\nSeychelles has had a long period of rapid economic growth since the 1960s, cumulating into a large output. In 1990, GDP (MER) was only US$534 million and almost tripled to US$1.5 billion in 2019. This was followed by a dip to US$1.3 billion in 2020 due to the devastating effect of the COVID-19 pandemic. In the Current Path forecast, total output for Seychelles is expected to reach US$2.2 billion in 2043, representing an additional US$1 billion compared to 2020.\n\nEconomic growth has been driven by growth in the tourism sector, especially in accommodation and food services. Due to the country’s reliance on the tourism sector, negative global shocks are readily transmitted into poor growth performance. In the wake of the 2008/09 global financial crisis, the economy shrank by 2.1% and 1.1% in 2008 and 2009, respectively. From 2010 to 2019, the country grew at an average rate of about 5% per annum, reflecting the lack of adverse global shocks and the thriving tourism sector. However, in 2020, the economy shrank by −13.8% due to the travel restrictions and lockdowns associated with the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nThe IFs platform uses data from the Global Trade and Analysis Project (GTAP) to classify economic activity into six sectors: agriculture, energy, materials (including mining), manufacturing, service and information and communication technologies (ICT). Most other sources use a threefold distinction between only agriculture, industry and services with the result that data may differ.\n\nGiven its large tourist industry, the economy of Seychelles is predominantly a service economy. The service sector accounted for 77.1% of GDP in 2015 and 78% in 2019 before the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. The pandemic hit the travel and tourism industry very hard, leading to the service sector’s contribution falling to US$1.08 billion, equivalent to a 6.9 percentage point drop in its share of GDP. In the Current Path forecast, the service sector’s share of GDP will remain at about 75% until 2043. Its dollar contribution will, however, increase to US$1.74 billion.\n\nThe manufacturing sector is the second largest contributor to output at 10.3% (US$0.17 billion) in 2019. In the Current Path forecast, both the share and amount of the manufacturing sector’s contribution will rise even as the economy marginally reduces its dependence on services. The ICT sector, the third contributor to output, will double from US$0.06 billion to US$0.12 billion in 2043. The share ICT for Seychelles (4.6%) is below the average for high-income economies of 6.3%. Agriculture, the smallest contributor to output, will decline in importance to 3.1% in 2043 from 3.7% in 2019.\n\nThere are numerous methodologies for and approaches to defining poverty. We measure income poverty and use GDP per capita as a proxy. In 2015, the World Bank adopted the measure of US$1.90 per person per day (in 2011 international prices), also used to measure progress towards the achievement of Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 1 of eradicating extreme poverty. To account for extreme poverty in richer countries occurring at slightly higher levels of income than in poor countries, the World Bank introduced three additional poverty lines in 2017:\n\nUS$3.20 for lower middle-income countries\n\nUS$5.50 for upper middle-income countries\n\nUS$22.70 for high-income countries.\n\nBeing a high-income economy, extreme poverty is measured at US$22.70 per day and Seychelles has generally a very large proportion of the population that is poor. In 2015, 50 000 people, or 48.2% of the population, were considered to be in extreme poverty. This already high poverty rate increased significantly between 2016 and 2020 by 10.5 percentage points, or 12 000 more people into poverty. However, the Current Path forecast of poverty for Seychelles indicates that poverty will fall back to 49.7%, or 52 000 people, in 2043. Comparatively, Seychelles is a more unequal society than an average high-income economy with a 0.11-point difference in 2019. The higher level and slower decline of poverty in Seychelles compared to other high-income countries is a result of its relatively higher level of inequality and slower economic growth.\n\nThe IFs platform forecasts six types of energy, namely oil, gas, coal, hydro, nuclear and other renewables. To allow comparisons between different types of energy, the data is converted into billion barrels of oil equivalent (BBOE). The energy contained in a barrel of oil is approximately 5.8 million British thermal units (MBTUs) or 1 700 kilowatt-hours (kWh) of energy.\n\nIn 2019, Seychelles produced most of its energy from coal (45.5%), followed by gas (27.3%) and oil (27.3%). By 2043, the relative share of gas will increase significantly to 42.9% while coal production will reduce to 23.8% and oil production remains more or less the same at 28.6%. Other renewable energy sources such as wind and solar energy will comprise 5% of energy production in the Current Path forecast.\n\nSeychelles’ 2010–2030 energy policy envisions 15% renewable energy production by 2030. However, production is not the same as energy use. Despite its energy production, Seychelles is a net importer of energy at 12% of energy demand in 2019, though this rate reduces to 5.8% in 2043. The country is, therefore, more energy independent than the average high-income economy, which will import half of its energy demand in 2043 in the Current Path forecast.\n\nThe Stability scenario represents reasonable but ambitious reductions in risk of regime instability and lower levels of internal conflict. Stability is generally a prerequisite for other aspects of development and this would encourage inflows of foreign direct investment (FDI) and improve business confidence. Better governance through the accountability that follows substantive democracy is modelled separately.\n\nThe intervention is explained here in the thematic part of the website.\n\nThe Stability scenario generally signifies increased political stability and reduced internal conflict leading to high FDI inflows and improved accountable governance. After independence in 1976, President René came to power through a coup d’état the year thereafter and stayed in power until 2004. Although he survived at least two attempted coups d’état, Seychelles gained a reputation as one of the most stable African countries. Nevertheless, the country generally enjoys a very high level of government security. In 2019, the governance security index was 0.88, lower than the average for high-income economies of 0.94. In the Current Path, the governance security index will improve by 0.2 points to 0.9 in 2043. In the Stability scenario, the governance security index will increase more rapidly to 0.93 in 2043, though this will still be below the average for high-income economies. High-income economies include mainly mature democracies and the world’s most politically stable nations, hence their high average governance security index of 0.97.\n\nThis section presents the impact of a Demographic scenario that aims to hasten and increase the demographic dividend through reasonable but ambitious reductions in the communicable-disease burden for children under five, the maternal mortality ratio and increased access to modern contraception.\n\nThe intervention is explained here in the thematic part of the website.\n\nDemographers typically differentiate between a first, second and even a third demographic dividend. We focus here on the contribution of the size of the labour force (between 15 and 64 years of age) relative to dependants (children and the elderly) as part of the first dividend. A window of opportunity opens when the ratio of the working-age population to dependants is equal to or surpasses 1.7.\n\nSeychelles is already in the midst of its demographic dividend. In 2019, the ratio of the working-age population to dependants in Seychelles was 2.2 to 1, meaning that there were about 2.2 working-age persons for each dependant in the country; and that rate will decline to 1.7 to 1 in 2043. This is slightly above the average of 1.9 for high-income economies, which declines more rapidly to 1.5 to 1 in 2043. Seychelles should, therefore, gain more from the contribution that labour makes to economic growth compared to the average contribution to high-income countries should its working-age population have the same levels of health and education.\n\nThis section presents reasonable but ambitious improvements in the Health/WaSH scenario, which include reductions in the mortality rate associated with both communicable diseases (e.g. AIDS, diarrhoea, malaria and respiratory infections) and non-communicable diseases (NCDs) (e.g. diabetes), as well as improvements in access to safe water and better sanitation. The acronym WaSH stands for water, sanitation and hygiene.\n\nThe intervention is explained here in the thematic part of the website.\n\nIn 2019, total deaths from communicable and non-communicable diseases were 100 and 600, respectively, lower than the average high-income country. In Seychelles, the entire country has access to improved sanitation (as early as since 2014) and universal health coverage is free of charge in the public sector. Seychelles’ ministry of health is now shifting direction to quality healthcare by promoting patient-centred care that provides tailor-made services to individual patients.\n\nBecause Seychelles has high levels of basic infrastructure and good healthcare, the Health/WaSH scenario has limited impact compared to its effect in other African countries. For example, access to safe piped water supply was at 95.5% and improved sanitation at 100% in 2019.\n\nAt birth, the life expectancy for the average Seychellois was 74.6 years in 2019, compared to the average of 81 years in high-income economies and 65.8 years in Africa. Females have a much higher life expectancy at birth (78.2 years) than males (71.2 years). The Health/WaSH scenario increases life expectancy to 78.1 years by 2043, above the Current Path forecast of 77.4 years.\n\nThe Agriculture scenario represents reasonable but ambitious increases in yields per hectare (reflecting better management and seed and fertiliser technology), increased land under irrigation and reduced loss and waste. Where appropriate, it includes an increase in calorie consumption, reflecting the prioritisation of food self-sufficiency above food exports as a desirable policy objective.\n\nThe intervention is explained here in the thematic part of the website.\n\nThe data on yield per hectare (in metric tons) is for crops but does not distinguish between different categories of crops.\n\nOnly 3.5% of land in Seychelles is used for crops and 4% for grazing, with much of the remaining land covered by forests. Agriculture therefore contributed only 3.8% of the GDP of Seychelles and employed about 5 000 people in 2019. Its share of GDP and the number of workers in the sector will fall by 2043. The small size and poor performance of the agriculture sector in Seychelles is attributable to the country’s geography, the collapse of the plantation economy, the stigmatisation of agriculture as a job for uneducated people, and the lack of preferential treatment to access to finance, inputs, and markets. Moreover, in 2008 the liberalisation of the meat and meat products market sent many livestock sector actors out of business.\n\nIn 2019, the average yield per hectare for crops was 3.5 metric tons per hectare, far below the average of 5.4 metric tons per hectare for high-income economies. In the Current Path forecast, yields will increase to 4.6 metric tons per hectare by 2043. In the Agriculture scenario, the average yield will be 7.3 metric tons per hectare, which is above the 2043 forecast of average yields per hectare of 5.3 for high-income economies. This means that if the country can adopt modern farming methods, including the use of fertiliser and improved seeds, there will be an extra 2.7 metric tons per hectare compared to the Current Path forecast in 2043.\n\nThe Education scenario represents reasonable but ambitious improved intake, transition and graduation rates from primary to tertiary levels and better quality of education. It also models substantive progress towards gender parity at all levels, additional vocational training at secondary school level and increases in the share of science and engineering graduates.\n\nThe intervention is explained here in the thematic part of the website.\n\nSeychelles is the first African country to meet all goals of UNESCO’s education for all (EFA) initiative in 2014. Key to its success in the education sector was the implementation of a free education system in 1981. Education free and compulsory up to the age of 16 and through secondary education up to 18. Learners do not have to pay for books and tuition fees. In 2019, the mean years of education were 9.5 years, three years more than the average African country, and it will increase to 10.36 in 2043 in the Current Path forecast. In the Education scenario, as the government intervenes in primary, secondary, and tertiary education indicators, the average years of education will increase to 10.4 years, which is still lower than the mean years of schooling of 12.8 years for high-income economies.\n\nThe gender gap in mean years of education was skewed in favour of males in 2019 (mean years of schooling were 9.7 years for males compared to 9.4 for females). In the Education scenario, Seychelles will attain gender parity in years of education at 9.9 years for both males and females in 2032. By 2043, females will have 0.20 more years of education than their male counterparts.\n\nThe Manufacturing/Transfers scenario represents reasonable but ambitious manufacturing growth through greater investment in the economy, investments in research and development, and promotion of the export of manufactured goods. It is accompanied by an increase in welfare transfers (social grants) to moderate the initial increases in inequality that are typically associated with a manufacturing transition. To this end, the scenario improves tax administration and increases government revenues.\n\nThe intervention is explained here in the thematic part of the website.\n\nChart 30 should be read with Chart 8 that presents a stacked area graph on the contribution to GDP and size, in billion US$, of the Current Path economy for each of the sectors.\n\nBecause of the importance of tourism, the economy of Seychelles is dominated by the service sector that contributed 78% to GDP in 2019 (equivalent to US$1.26 billion), followed by the manufacturing sector that contributed 10% (equivalent to US$162 million) and ICT at 4.6% (equivalent to US$74 million). Although the service sector will make the most significant additional contribution to GDP in the Manufacturing/Transfer scenario compared to the Current Path forecast (equivalent to US$0.12 billion in 2043), its contribution to GDP will decline by 0.15 percentage points compared to the Current Path forecast. The manufacturing sector – the second largest contributor to GDP – will add US$30 million to GDP in the Manufacturing/Transfer scenario compared to the Current Path in 2043, representing a 0.47 percentage point increase. The third largest contributor to GDP in 2043 will be the ICT sector, with an additional contribution of US$10 million or 0.03 percentage points more compared to the Current Path forecast. The contribution of the agriculture sector will decline by 0.19 percentage points to 2.9% of GDP with the result that its size in 2043 will be similar to that in 2019.\n\nThe Leapfrogging scenario represents a reasonable but ambitious adoption of and investment in renewable energy technologies, resulting in better access to electricity in urban and rural areas. The scenario includes accelerated access to mobile and fixed broadband and the adoption of modern technology that improves government efficiency and allows for the more rapid formalisation of the informal sector.\n\nThe intervention is explained here in the thematic part of the website.\n\nFixed broadband includes cable modem Internet connections, DSL Internet connections of at least 256 KB/s, fibre and other fixed broadband technology connections (such as satellite broadband Internet, ethernet local area networks, fixed-wireless access, wireless local area networks, WiMAX, etc.).\n\nThe ICT sector was the third largest contributor to GDP in Seychelles. In 2019, Seychelles had 22.2 fixed broadband subscriptions per 100 people, the second highest Internet penetration rate in Africa after Mauritius (at 23 per 100). In the Current Path forecast, fixed broadband subscriptions will increase by more than 100% to 48.6 in 2043. The Leapfrogging scenario will lead to an additional 1.4 subscriptions per 100 people compared to the Current Path forecast in 2043. Across the forecast horizon, fixed broadband subscriptions in Seychelles will be lower than the average for high-income economies.\n\nThe Free Trade scenario represents the impact of the full implementation of the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA) by 2034 through increases in exports, improved productivity and increased trade and economic freedom.\n\nThe intervention is explained here in the thematic part of the website.\n\nThe trade balance is the difference between the value of a country’s exports and its imports. A country that imports more goods and services than it exports in terms of value has a trade deficit, while a country that exports more goods and services than it imports has a trade surplus.\n\nSeychelles imports all machinery, equipment, food, fuel and a range of consumer goods. It exports mainly canned tuna fish. Its major trading partners are the UK, France, Germany, and South Africa. It is a member of a host of regional economic communities that seek to promote trade through integration, such as SADC, the Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa (COMESA), the Indian Ocean Commission (IOC), the Tripartite Free Trade Area, an EPA with the EU, and the World Trade Organization (WTO).\n\nLike many African economies, Seychelles is a net importer of goods and services and the impact of the Free Trade scenario is that the combined value of exports and imports increases by 48% in 2043. In 2019, Seychelles’ trade deficit came to 7.1% of GDP. The country will begin to see an improvement in its trade balance both in the Current Path forecast and in the Free Trade scenario. In the Free Trade scenario, Seychelles will sustain a trade surplus until 2043, when its trade balance is 7.5% of GDP. The Free Trade scenario will lead to a more significant abundance on the trading account than the Current Path forecast during the decade of 2024–2034; after that, the Current Path forecast has a larger trade surplus than the Free Trade scenario. This suggests that the full implementation of the AfCFTA will, in the long term, worsen the trade balance of Seychelles compared to its Current Path forecast pointing to the need for additional measures, such as those reflected in the Leapfrogging and Manufacturing/Transfers scenarios. Because Seychelles trades more with non-African countries, an AfCFTA scenario will lead to more trade diversion than trade creation, leading to a worsening of the current account in 2043.\n\nThe Combined Agenda 2063 scenario consists of the combination of all 11 sectoral scenarios presented above, namely the Stability, Demographic, Health/WaSH, Agriculture, Education, Manufacturing/Transfers, Leapfrogging, Free Trade, Financial Flows, Infrastructure and Governance scenarios. The cumulative impact of better education, health, infrastructure, etc. means that countries get an additional benefit in the integrated IFs forecasting platform that we refer to as the synergistic effect. Chart 55 presents the contribution of each of these 12 components to GDP per capita in the Combined Agenda 2063 scenario as a stacked area graph.\n\nThe scenarios with the greatest impact on GDP per capita by 2043 are the Free Trade and Manufacturing/Transfers scenarios. In these two scenarios, GDP per capita increases by US$1 612 and US$1 142 above the Current Path forecast in 2043, equivalent to an increase of almost 5% in both instances. The scenarios with the least impact on GDP per capita are Health/WaSH and Demographics, which is understandable since Seychelles already does well in the delivery of healthcare and WaSH infrastructure and is already experiencing a demographic dividend. The impact of the interventions in both instances is therefore small. The synergistic effect of all scenarios is an extra addition to GDP per capita of US$741, different from the effects of the individual scenarios."
