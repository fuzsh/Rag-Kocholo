        "text": "Travelling Overseas\n\nSeychellois travelling abroad should ensure they have up-to-date information for their travels, including the latest information on entry requirements for Coronavirus, safety and security, and travel warnings.\n\nVisa Information\n\nThe Seychelles passport is one of the most powerful passports in the region; meaning that bearers may travel to more countries without requiring a visa before arrival. The Foreign Affairs Department is continuously engaging for further visa-waiver agreements.\n\nThe following list are provided solely as a guide for Seychellois travelling abroad. Every effort has been made to ensure that the information on visa requirements is correct and up to date. Given that these requirements often change at short notice, you should check with your travel agent or your Consular Office before departure, to ensure that the information is accurate for your specific purpose.\n\nList of Countries that Seychellois Do Not Require Visa to Enter\n\nList of Countries that Seychellois Require Visa to Enter\n\nReturning to Seychelles\n\nSeychellois nationals returning to Seychelles must apply for entry through the Travel Authorisation (TA) platform at seychelles.govtas.com. The TA is mandatory for all individuals, including nationals and foreign nationals entering Seychelles by air, and the following documents are required.\n\nValid Seychelles passport\n\nSelfie or passport-type photo\n\nContact information\n\nDetails of your arrival flight into Seychelles\n\nSeychellois citizens travelling on a foreign passport should still apply using the Seychellois Citizen option on the TA platform to avoid paying the EUR 10 fee. In addition to their foreign passports, a copy of one of the following documents proving Seychellois citizenship should be uploaded in the Required Documents section.\n\nSeychelles passport (expired passports are also acceptable)\n\nNational Identity Card\n\nBirth certificate\n\nCertificate of Citizenship\n\nThe passport used to complete the TA should be the same one used to travel to Seychelles.\n\nGeneral Consular to Seychellois Distressed Abroad\n\nThe Consular Office can provide information, advice and consular assistance to Seychellois nationals. The Consular Office is supported by Seychelles Embassies, High Commissions and Consulates around the world.\n\nWhat we can do\n\nWe can issue Emergency Travel Documents (ETD) if you have lost your passport overseas.\n\nWe can request financial assistance on your behalf from your friends or relatives.\n\nWe can notify your friends or relatives if you have been injured abroad.\n\nWe can assist in arranging the repatriation of the remains and personal belongings of the deceased.\n\nWe can assist in the event of natural disasters, civil disorder, or terrorist attacks in a foreign country.\n\nWhat we cannot do\n\nWe cannot pay for your medical, accommodation, or travel expenses.\n\nWe cannot provide you with loans or cash (including for repatriation of remains or personal effects).\n\nWe cannot intervene in civil or commercial disputes.\n\nWe cannot act as your guarantor or sponsor.\n\nArrest and detention abroad\n\nOne should always be mindful of and respect foreign countries’ local laws and customs, which may differ from those in Seychelles.\n\nThe Consular Office shall ensure that you have access to a consular representation ensuring humane treatment and confirm that you are not denied any legal assistance to which you may be entitled.\n\nWe will assist you with a list of lawyers abroad and pass on information on the progress of your case to your family.\n\nHowever, we cannot pay your legal fees, including fines or posting bail. We will not intervene in your legal case and disregard the host-country’s laws to ensure your release.\n\nTravel Insurance\n\nSeychellois travelling abroad are strongly advised to subscribe to international travel insurance matching the various risks attributed to their destination and purpose of travel."
