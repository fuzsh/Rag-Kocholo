        "text": "I never thought I’d have the pleasure of saying I went on holidays to Seychelles – but I’m happy to report that the journey there is worth every minute and every cent. It’s complete and utter paradise and is laden with pristine beaches, white sand and beautiful mountain ranges in the background. If you want to island hop, that’s also easy and a good chance to see some variation in scenery. Some islands, such as La Digue, are super small and not heavily populated.\n\n“She sells seashells by the seashore.”\n\n(I don’t know why but as a child I often associated that tongue twister with this country. Did you?)\n\nThe island of La Digue is a fascinating place. (Wiki page click here.) With a population of only 2000 people, apparently, everyone knows everyone. For that reason, it makes for a fantastic day trip. We were based at the Hilton Northolme on the main island of Mahe and they were ever so kind and arranged an EPIC day trip for us of beautiful (albeit long) proportions.\n\nLa Digue, an island of striking beauty where tall coconut palms and gigantic boulders cradle glorious white sandy beaches. La Digue also offers a real insight into the life of the Seychellois people. After disembarkation at the jetty you will be greeted with a warm welcome typical of the island people unspoiled by the pressures of the modern world.\n\nProceed to l’Union Estate with its majestic colonial house. At l’Union Estate watch coconuts being processed into copra and oil and admire the giant tortoises in their pen close to one of the Seychelles largest granite boulders. Time for swimming at lovely Anse Source d’Argent Beach. Late afternoon, head back to the jetty for return journey to Praslin Island and subsequently to Mahe.”\n\nTo book with 7 Degrees South tour company, click here.\n\nWe went with 7 Degrees South: a company mentioned above and everything was organised from the bus pickup and transfer to the boat, lunch, all the sights on La Digue and the other spectacular island of Praslin. I’d highly recommend using that company for a good day trip to the surrounding islands in Seychelles.\n\n(*NB* We paid for everything and this is an unsponsored trip.)\n\nOrevwar! (This means goodbye in the Seychellois Creole language which is very similar to French. Although the locals will tell you they prefer to speak English as real French grammar is too difficult. Click here to find out more about their native language.)\n\nLooking for more Seychelles inspiration?
