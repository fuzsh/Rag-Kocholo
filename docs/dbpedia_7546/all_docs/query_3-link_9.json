        "text": "The least populated sovereign country in Africa, Seychelles, has slowly begun to take its place amongst other African countries after being known for their warm personalities and increased tourist activity, especially after the pandemic in 2020.\n\nSeychelles is an archipelago of about 115 islands in East Africa on the Western Indian Ocean. The country has two main island groups: Mahé group, comprised of more than 40 mountainous islands located towards the country’s center, and a second group known as Praslin, with more than 70 flat coralline islands on the outer banks.\n\nThe Seychellois are particularly popular for the country’s unique diversity and even more for their culture, enriched very deeply by African, Asian, and European influence, which It has managed to meld in a very harmonious manner.\n\nSeychelles Population\n\nEven while experiencing massive growth in the past few years, the population of Seychelles is only a minuscule 99,967 making them one of the least populated African countries. Still, it is very understandable due to the size of the country.\n\nOf the 115 islands that make up the country, eight (8) are inhabitable. Most of the country’s population lives on the main island, Mahé, followed by Praslin and La Digue.\n\nListed below are the significant ethnicities in Seychelles:\n\nSeychellois Creole: accounts for about 90% of the total population on the Islands, and Seychellois are said to be people of mixed origin, which may include French, British, Middle Eastern, Chinese, and African roots.\n\nIndo-Seychellois: this is a minority ethnic group of people of Indian descent who comprise about 6% of the total population. The majority of them are Hindus who hail from Tamil Nadu. Others include Indian Jains, Muslims, Christians, etc.\n\nSino-Seychellois: also a minority ethnic group, these Chinese immigrants moved from Mauritius to the island in the 18th century. Their population is estimated at 1,000 individuals, which makes them one of the minor Chinese groups in Africa.\n\nReligion\n\nAs a country influenced by multiple cultures and different societies, it is common knowledge that the populace practices a multitude of religions. This is allowed by the Seychelles government, as the constitution guarantees the freedom of religion and expression. It is also important to note that the Seychelles government doesn’t favor any religion. There is freedom of expression and choosing the religion of one’s choice without pressure from the government or people.\n\nMost people in Seychelles practice Christianity. Roman Catholicism is the largest denomination in the country (82% of the population), with other minor denominations like the Anglican Church (6.4% of the population), Seventh-day Adventists, Pentecostals, and various Protestant denominations also present.\n\nThe second largest religion in Seychelles is Hinduism, which can be credited to the Indo-Seychellois populace of the country. They make up around 2.5% of the Seychellois population, closely followed by Islam, which is practiced by about 1.6% of the population, about 900 people.\n\nFamily Life in Seychelles\n\nIn contrast to most African countries, the Seychelles basic family unit is matriarchal, and the woman holds superior status to the man in the working class. But while women control many of the economic resources in the homes, domestic violence is still quite common, especially with women being on the receiving end.\n\nIn Seychelles, education is highly valued, and families are encouraged to give their children an opportunity to get a good education. The Seychelles government provides free education for children until they reach the age of 18, and families are urged to enroll their children.\n\nSeychelles is a country that prioritizes community and social cohesion, which is evident in how families connect. Weddings and funerals are crucial family gatherings and festivities, and families frequently assemble to celebrate and support one another.\n\nArt and Architecture of Seychelles\n\nAs a group of islands influenced by European, Middle Eastern, Asian, and African traditions, the art and architecture of Seychelles bear a unique touch that can only be found in a country with many multiethnic influences acting upon it.\n\nOne of the most critical aspects of Seychellois arts is music and dance, which are essential to their tradition. An example is Moutya, a traditional dance initially started during the slave trade era to signify resisting servitude and social injustice.\n\nIt resembles Sega but contains more energetic and suggestive dance steps.\n\nThe impact of colonialism on Seychelle’s architecture is indelible; listed below are some of the unique architectures in the country.\n\nCreole architecture: This is a style of architecture that is unique to Seychelles, and it combines elements of African, French, and British architecture. The houses are made of wood and have steep roofs, wide verandas, and colorful shutters. They are painted in bright colors such as pink, blue, and green, while the shutters are painted in contrasting colors to provide a decorative touch.\n\nFrench colonial architecture: Seychelles was a French colony from 1756 to 1814. The influence of French colonial architecture can still be seen in buildings such as the Seychelles Supreme Court and the Clock Tower in Victoria.\n\nSeychellois Food\n\nSeychelles is a part of the world with a distinct cultural mix, evident in its cuisine. Seychellois cuisine is a fusion of African, French, Indian, and Chinese cuisines, with many regional specialties. The following are some examples of Seychellois specialties:\n\nPoison ek Diri: is a traditional dish from Seychelles that translates to “poison and rice,” To most, it is the most popular dish in the country and consists of a fish called the lionfish, cooked and served with rice.\n\nGrilled fish: Seychelles is known for its local fish, and grilled fish is among the country’s most famous dishes. Typically, the fish is braised in a combination of Creole spices before being grilled to perfection.\n\nOctopus Curry: Fresh octopus is cooked in a spicy curry sauce and served with rice or breadfruit.\n\nLadob: A sweet dish with bananas, sweet potatoes, and coconut milk. The ingredients are combined and cooked until a thick, creamy substance forms, flavored with vanilla and cinnamon.\n\nShark chutney: made from smoked shark flesh, grated coconut, and a spice blend. Chutney is traditionally eaten with rice or toast.\n\nFashion in Seychelles\n\nLike every aspect of this country, the people’s fashion is also heavily influenced by many multicultural traditions, stretching from Africa to Asia and even Europe.\n\nKoste is a traditional looping skirt worn by women in Seychelles. A rectangular cloth is wrapped around the waist and fastened at the side to make the skirt. The fabric is typically vividly colored and patterned, and it can be manufactured from a range of textiles such as cotton, silk, and synthetic mixes.\n\nIt is generally paired with a blouse or shirt, a shawl or scarf, and jewelry such as necklaces, bracelets, and earrings. The skirt is an essential aspect of Seychellois culture and is frequently worn at weddings, festivals, and cultural events.\n\nKazak and Penwar are traditional Seychelles men’s dress styles. A kazak’ is a loose-fitting shirt made of lightweight cotton or linen. It is frequently created in bright colors and is worn untucked.\n\nA penwar is a pair of pants worn with a Kazak shirt. The pants are loose-fitting and comfy, with an elastic waistband or drawstring fastening. Penwar’s are often composed of lightweight cotton or linen fabric and can be simple or patterned.\n\nSeychelles Holidays and Celebrations\n\nBelow are some of the most significant holidays and celebrations in Seychelles apart from the standard set of holidays known and celebrated worldwide.\n\nSeychelles Carnival, which takes place in April\n\nNational Day (June 18): National Day celebrates Seychelles’ culture and identity, marked with music, dance, and traditional food.\n\nIndependence Day (June 29)\n\nFestival Kreol (October): Festival Kreol celebrates Seychellois Creole culture\n\nSub Indian Ocean Seychelles (SUBIOS) underwater festival takes place in November.\n\nCommon Seychellois Language Expressions and their Translation\n\nSeychelles Creole is the most spoken language in the country and the best and most advisable way to connect with the local audience.
