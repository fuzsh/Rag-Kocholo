        "text": "Seychelles comprises 115 islands in the Indian Ocean, located off the coast of East Africa. The main islands are about 1,600 kilometres east of Kenya and roughly 1,100 kilometres northeast of Madagascar. Seychelles is best known for its pristine beaches, lush vegetation and kaleidoscopic marine life.\n\nBecause of its close proximity to East African countries like Kenya and Tanzania, it’s very easy to combine your beach holiday in Seychelles with a Big 5 safari! Our Travel Experts always recommend the best destinations for your tailor-made itinerary based on easy access and exciting activities. And a bush and beach holiday is one of our most common combinations.\n\nAs a foreign visitor, you will need a passport which is valid for a minimum of six months after the planned length of your visit. You do not need a visa to enter Seychelles. However, this can change so you should always check the entry visa requirements before departing.\n\nCitizens arriving from Sierra Leone, Liberia, and Guinea-Conakry are the only ones who need visas. There are no visa requirements for all other nationalities and they will be issued with a three-month visitor's permit on arrival.\n\nHow long will it take to issue my visa?\n\nEnquire at the Seychelles’ embassy in your country for the most up-to-date visa information.\n\nWhat are the visa requirements?\n\nAll visitors need to show certain documents in order to obtain immigration clearance at the Seychelles International Airport. Visitors will need the following:\n\n- A valid passport: for the date of entry and exit from the Seychelles\n\n- A return or onward ticket\n\n- Proof of accommodation (including contact details of the establishment)\n\n- Sufficient funds for the length of your stay\n\n- German minors who have \"Kinderausweis\" in lieu of a passport will be permitted entry provided that it contains a photo of the minor concerned.\n\nFor how long should my visa be valid?\n\nEnquire at the Seychelles’ embassy in your country for the most up-to-date visa information.\n\nPlease ensure that you verify this information independently with the relevant embassy, high commission or consulate as your consultant cannot be held liable for any errors.\n\nMotorists in the Seychelles drive on the left side of the road. Speed restrictions are 40km/h in towns, 65km/h on the open road and 80km/h on the highway between Victoria and the airport. An EU/international driving license is expected when hiring vehicles although some companies will accept a national driver’s license.\n\nThe most convenient place to rent your car would be at the airport. The main roads in the Seychelles are paved, well-signed, and in good condition. Roads are predominantly sandy tracks in the rest of the country. Petrol stations tend to close at varied times in the evening. We recommend filling your tank in the day to avoid any inconveniences.\n\nNo other islands apart from Mahé and Praslin have car rental services. A car would be convenient for visitors who really want to experience Mahé and Praslin, although public transport on these islands is decent and most resorts offer shuttle services to points of interest nearby.\n\nWhile it may not be as fast as the internet in Europe and America, Wi-Fi is becoming increasingly more accessible in Seychelles. Mahé has a number of internet cafes, although they become scarce once you leave the capital. Travellers who are visiting Seychelles for an extended period of time may want to buy a USB stick from the local mobile provider that they can load with airtime and plug into their laptop.\n\nThe international dialling code in the Seychelles is +248, and coverage can be found on the islands of Mahé, La Digue, Praslin and Silhouette. There are several foreign mobile services that have coverage in the Seychelles but be warned — roaming fees can be quite high. Visitors who have ‘unlocked’ GSM phones can buy prepaid SIM cards at Cable and Wireless or Airtel. Top-up cards are widely distributed and easily bought."
