        "text": "PROJECT OVERVIEW\n\nUnderstanding the biology of manta rays is incredibly important when it comes to designing management strategies aimed at protecting them; this information can help direct our efforts and resources to locations that will most effectively conserve their populations. With global manta ray populations under severe threat from unsustainable fishing pressures, understanding how these charismatic rays are using and moving through their marine environment is of utmost importance if we are to ensure their protection long into the future.\n\nThe Seychelles is an island nation in the Western Indian Ocean consisting of 115 small, tropical islands, and a little-studied reef manta ray (Mobula alfredi) population. Despite historic records of manta ray fishing around the populous Inner Islands of the archipelago, mobulid sightings throughout this region are now infrequent, and this has made the population difficult to research. When it was discovered that reliable aggregations of reef manta rays occur at locations within the Outer Islands Group of Seychelles, the Manta Trust was provided with a unique opportunity to study the population dynamics and movement patterns of these animals not only in Seychelles, but in the absence of the human impacts and tourism pressures that are typically associated with similar locations around the world.\n\nReaching these mantas however is no mean feat. With the islands of Seychelles encompassing just 459 of the 1.4 million square kilometre Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) of the country, there is a lot of ocean for these reef manta rays to move through! Fortunately, the Seychelles Manta Ray Project found its home in the Outer Islands in 2013 when - in collaboration with the Save Our Seas Foundation (SOSF) - the Research Centre on D’Arros Island became the field base for the project's research.\n\nSince establishing the project, we’ve been striving to learn as much as possible about the manta ray aggregation at D’Arros Island and throughout the wider Seychelles, by accumulating data about the population size, movement patterns, feeding behaviour and genetics of these animals. This process involves the use of numerous research techniques including; photo-ID, acoustic and satellite telemetry, tissue sampling, as well as lots of time in the water observing the mantas. While we have already made great progress in better understanding this unique reef manta population, the research team still has a lot to learn and an exciting future for the project remains ahead.\n\nProject Leader - kim chang-pen-tive\n\n'I grew up on the eastern coast of Mahe, the main island of Seychelles. For me, watching shark pups, and rays and marvelling over butterfly and sergeant fishes within the safety of shallow reefs was so familiar, until it wasn't. To experience that change within a short time stayed with me, however, conservation was not a first choice.\n\nIt was only after my very first dive on the island around a small islet called St. Pierre that I truly learned to appreciate the ocean in all its splendour. I was incredibly enticed and impressed by the synergy between the organisms that you only have a theoretical knowledge of. I loved finding small organisms and observing their interaction on the reef. I found that they were truly the building blocks of a thriving ecosystem and incredibly underrated. I was both fearful and amazed by the movement of sharks, and my curiosity grew to want to always be in the water and observe.\n\nA few internships and dreams later, from school to becoming a Divemaster I find myself in one of the most beautiful places in Seychelles identifying mantas. Manta rays are so dear to me because it was a dream for me to witness at least one in the wild. It never ceases to amaze me how graceful yet massive these creatures are, and I am incredibly fortunate to be a part of this project.’"
