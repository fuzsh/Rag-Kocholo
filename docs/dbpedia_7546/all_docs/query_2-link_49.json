        "text": "The president is chief of state and head of government; the winning candidate is directly elected for up to two five-year terms. The president nominates cabinet ministers and a vice president, all of whom require approval from the National Assembly.\n\nThen vice president Danny Faure became president when James Michel of the People’s Party (PL) resigned as president in 2016. In late 2019, Faure was endorsed by the PL, renamed United Seychelles (US), to contest the October 2020 presidential election. Faure lost to Seychelles Democratic Alliance (LDS) candidate Wavel Ramkalawan. The election marked the first opposition victory in a presidential contest in Seychellois history.\n\nMembers of the unicameral National Assembly are directly elected in 26 constituencies, while up to 9 additional seats are assigned by parties according to a proportional calculation of the vote.\n\nThe LDS won 25 seats in the October 2020 elections, which were held concurrently with the presidential contest. US won the remaining 10. Observers called the elections free and fair, though they did receive reports alleging misuse of state resources.\n\nThe Electoral Commission (EC) has faced criticism from opposition parties and others for enforcing its mandates inconsistently. In 2018, then president Faure approved an Elections Act amendment establishing a permanent chief electoral officer. The amendment was intended to alleviate concerns about the efficiency of the previous system, in which a chief electoral officer was appointed a few months before an election.\n\nElectoral-law amendments that, among other things, provide a clearer definition of what is considered a spoiled ballot, were approved in 2020.\n\nThere are no restrictions on the right to organize political parties or other competitive political groupings. However, during the 2015 presidential election, several opposition parties claimed the government was engaged in systematic harassment and intimidation of candidates.\n\nPolitical party One Seychelles, which was founded in 2019, fielded presidential and legislative candidates in the 2020 elections.\n\nThe LDS, an alliance of opposition parties, became the first political group to defeat the PL and gain a legislative majority in 2016, reflecting increasing political pluralism in Seychelles. In October 2020, Ramkalawan became the first non–US candidate to win a presidential election.\n\nThe constitution mandates equal suffrage for adult citizens. Early voting procedures are designed to encourage the participation of some groups, including pregnant people, the elderly, and those with disabilities.\n\nThere are still no mechanisms to allow citizens living abroad to vote. Few women hold senior political office because of factors including longstanding traditional beliefs about the role of women. Women hold approximately 23 percent of National Assembly seats. Political life is dominated by people of European and South Asian origin.\n\nConcerns about government corruption persist, but significant improvements have been made in recent years. In 2016, the National Assembly passed an anticorruption law that established the country’s first independent Anti-Corruption Commission (ACC) and strengthened Seychelles’s legal anticorruption framework. In 2019, the National Assembly amended the anticorruption law to increase the number of ACC commissioners, clarify its strength, explicitly give it investigative powers, and enhance its law enforcement provisions.\n\nSeychelles, which was previously included in an EU list of foreign tax havens, was removed from that list in October 2021. At the time, EU finance ministers cited the government’s progress regarding the country’s taxation regime.\n\nIn November 2021, Seychellois authorities arrested businessman Mukesh Valabhji and his wife on suspicion of embezzling a $50-million donation provided by the United Arab Emirates (UAE) in 2002. Former first lady Sarah Zarqani-René also faces charges related to her alleged involvement in the scheme. The case was ongoing at year-end 2022.\n\nLaws allowing public access to government information have been inconsistently followed. Some government officials are required to declare assets, but they do not always comply. However, since the passing of the Access to Information Act in 2018; the creation of the Information Commission in 2019; and the election of President Ramkalawan in 2020, the government has made significant progress in operating with openness and transparency. The Information Commission published guidelines for citizens on how to obtain public information under the Access to Information Act in 2020.\n\nThe Seychelles Media Commission Act of 2010 establishes relatively strict guidelines for journalists. Several newspapers exist besides the state-owned daily, the Seychelles Nation. A publicly owned broadcaster provides television and radio programming alongside a private television station and two private radio stations. The law prohibits political parties and religious organizations from operating public radio broadcasts.\n\nIn the past, media workers practiced a degree of self-censorship to protect their advertising earnings and to avoid the application of strict—but rarely enforced—defamation laws. However, self-censorship has declined in recent years. In October 2021, the National Assembly decriminalized defamation.\n\nReligious freedom is generally respected. The government grants larger religious groups programming time on state radio, subject in most cases to advance review and approval. Smaller religious groups do not have access to dedicated broadcast time. Non-Catholic students in public schools providing Catholic instruction have no access to alternative activities during those classes.\n\nThe charter of the University of Seychelles enshrines academic freedom, while the constitution indirectly references academic freedom. A 2016 study from the International Labour Organization (ILO) and the United Nations Education, Scientific, and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) recognized Seychelles as having high compliance in institutional autonomy, tenure, individual rights, and democratic structure in the country’s two universities.\n\nIn the past, some activists have claimed that educators have had to demonstrate at least nominal loyalty to the PL, which previously controlled the executive and legislative branches, to reach senior bureaucratic positions. Since the 2020 transition of power, no reports of such behavior have emerged.\n\nAs the government seeks to protect the tourism sector, many sensitive subjects are considered off limits. Individuals who criticize the government publicly or privately sometimes suffer reprisals, such as harassment by police or the loss of jobs or contracts.\n\nThe freedom of assembly is protected by the constitution. Additionally, the government passed a revised public-assembly law in 2015, which several observers credited with allowing a more open and free political environment. However, the law still contains some restrictive provisions, including the need to give five days’ notice to the police for assemblies. It also empowers the head of police to disperse public meetings on grounds of preserving public health, morality, and safety, and sets conditions on the timing and location of large gatherings.\n\nUnions are permitted, but only about 15 percent of the workforce is unionized, and collective bargaining is relatively rare. Workers have the right to strike, but only if all other arbitration procedures have been exhausted.\n\nJudges sometimes face interference in cases involving major commercial or political interests. Seychelles, which has few legal professionals, relies on expatriate judges who serve fixed-term contracts on the Supreme Court. The government controls the negotiations and renewal of expatriate contracts, potentially allowing officials to compromise the impartiality of the non-Seychellois magistrates. The judiciary also lacks budgetary independence from the executive and can be subject to external influence. The Supreme Court remains a target of political threats and intimidation.\n\nWhile constitutional rights to due process are generally respected, prolonged pretrial detention is common. The courts introduced new systems in 2016 to expedite the processing of cases, but their effect has been limited.\n\nIn June 2022, the National Assembly voted in favor of a 10th amendment to the constitution, giving the Seychelles Defence Forces (SDF) the right to enforce domestic law. In effect, this amendment removes the separation between the police and the military. The country’s Ombudsman, the Seychelles Human Rights Commission (SHRC), and the Bar Association of Seychelles expressed concern that the amendment may undermine due process, the rule of law, and human rights; the groups petitioned the Constitutional Court in September for a review of the new amendment’s constitutionality. The court had not issued a ruling on the case as of year’s end."
