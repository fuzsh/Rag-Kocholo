        "text": "Renowned local artist, George Camille, urges visitors to explore further and take the opportunity to “access and immerse themselves in our lived experiences, our way of life, our unique culture.”\n\nCamille’s art is influenced by and represents that Creole culture. “I try to depict and showcase various aspects of our culture, our colonial Creole architecture, small modest wooden houses surrounded by lush green vegetation, village scenes showing people living in harmony with nature. A lot of my work depicts traditional Creole scenes of people going about their daily life, - fishing, going to market, harvesting fruits from their garden or just having a good gossip over a few beers at the end of the day.”\n\nCredit: George Camille\n\nThe term “Creole” refers both to the people and the culture, to the French-based language - and the food. An enjoyable way to access the Creole culture is through the local cuisine, a tasty combination of African, Chinese, European and Indian flavours. Not surprisingly, fresh seafood is prominent in the local diet and on menus. It might be wrapped in a banana leaf, grilled or cooked in a curry, perhaps with Island-style coconut rice spiked with cardamom, and accompanied by fresh fruit juices, coconut water, palm wine, rum or a locally brewed beer.\n\nThe local markets are a fine place to experience the hustle and bustle of life, and to buy local fruit, fish and spices (the islands were a hub of the 18th century spice trade). Sample exotic starfruit, breadfruit, jackfruit and the corossol, which tastes like a cross between pineapples and strawberries. The more familiar fruits like bananas, avocados, mangos and coconuts, are abundant, too. Victoria’s colourful Sir Selwyn Selwyn-Clarke Market is a vibrant place to look for clothes, crafts and souvenirs.\n\nCredit: George Camille\n\nLike the food, the music of the Seychelles reflects the nation’s history. Sega music is traditionally performed with simple instruments like rattles and hand drums. The accompanying dancers’ feet stay firmly rooted to the ground, as the body sways and the arms undulate. Moutya is similar, but the dancers move more freely and also join in the singing, traditionally around a campfire, the tempo increasing and the dancing gaining momentum. In modern times, local musicians have blended the traditional sega and moutya forms with reggae, pop and other European influences, instruments and arrangements.\n\nMany Seychellois painters and sculptors welcome visitors to their own private galleries, where they show and sell their artwork. Camille’s gallery, Kaz Zanana (Pineapple House), in Victoria, displays his paintings, etchings and multimedia work in a traditional wooden house more than a century old, built entirely of local hardwood, with carved pineapple motifs in its balustrades. On a shady veranda visitors can linger over lunch or a drink before heading back into the streets to further explore the capital and its people."
