        "text": "Why and how are causes of death monitored?\n\nUnderstanding the reasons why people die helps with the understanding of how they lived, in order to improve health services and reduce preventable deaths in every country, responding effectively to changing circumstances. Annual monitoring of causes of death allows countries to address their causes and adapt health systems to react effectively.\n\nThe leading causes of death are statistical estimates based on available data. These estimates are produced using data from multiple sources, including national vital registration data, latest estimates from WHO technical programmes, United Nations partners and inter-agency groups, as well as the Global Burden of Disease and other scientific studies. Before publishing, they are reviewed by WHO Member States through consultation with national focal points and WHO country and regional offices.\n\nThe top ten causes of death are statistical estimates based on available data. Multiple years of death registration data is available for Seychelles, however the data has low completeness and/or moderate quality issues with cause-of-death assignment which likely affects estimated deaths by cause. Use these estimates for programme evaluation with caution, as improvements in the national vital registration system may affect trends in cause-specific mortality. Comparisons among countries should be interpreted with caution.\n\nWhat are the triple billion targets?\n\nThe WHO Triple Billion targets measure impact on people's health to ensure that more people are enjoying better health and wellbeing, are benefitting from Universal Health Coverage (UHC) and are better protected from health emergencies.\n\nThe estimates are underpinned by 46 outcome indicators. They include 39 Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) indicators and seven non-SDG indicators. These offer a flexible approach to each of the Triple Billion targets, allowing countries to prioritize certain indicators based on their national health strategy, ensuring the Triple Billion strategy remains relevant for all Member States and their unique health challenges."
