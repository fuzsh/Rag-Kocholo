        "text": "Demographic features of the population of Seychelles include population density, ethnicity, education level, health of the populace, economic status, religious affiliations and other aspects of the population.\n\n\"Seychellois\" redirects here. For the ethnic group, see Seychellois Creole people. For other uses, see Seychellois (disambiguation).\n\nAbout 90% of the Seychellois people live on the island of Mah√©. Most of the rest live on Praslin and La Digue, with the remaining smaller islands either sparsely populated or uninhabited.\n\nMost Seychellois are descendants of early French settlers and East Africans who arrived in the 19th century. Tamils, along with other South Indians and Chinese (1.1% of the population) account for the other permanent inhabitants. About 1,703 (2000) expatriates live and work in Seychelles. In 1901, there were roughly 3500 Tamil speakers out of the country's population of 19,237. Tamil immigrants arrived in Seychelles as early as 1770 and were among the first settlers to the originally sparsely inhabited island nation.\n\nSeychelles culture is a mixture of French and African (Creole) influences. The local Seychellois Creole (Kreol), a creole language derived from French and African tongues, is the native language of 91.8% of the people; but English and French are also commonly used. English remains the language of government and commerce."
