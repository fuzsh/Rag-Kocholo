        "text": "The Republic of Seychelles is an archipelago of 115 islands northeast of Madagascar. The country has a total population of 120,581, three-quarters of whom live on the main island of Mahé. Seychelles has Africa's highest gross domestic product (GDP) per capita, at $15.8 billion (2022). Its economy is highly dependent on tourism and fisheries, and climate change poses long-term sustainability risks.\n\nPolitical Context\n\nIndependent since 1976, the Seychelles is a relatively young democracy. The first multiparty presidential election was held in 1993 after adopting a new constitution. The latest presidential and parliamentary elections took place in October 2020, bringing an opposition candidate, Wavel Ramkalawan, to the Presidency for the first time since the introduction of democratic elections. Ramkalawan’s Linyon Demokratic Sesel party also won the most seats in the national parliament. With well-established democratic institutions, Seychelles' political environment is expected to remain stable. The next general election will take place in 2025.\n\nEconomic Developments and Outlook\n\nSeychelles is the most prosperous nation in Sub-Saharan Africa. The economy remains highly dependent on tourism, accounting for 31% of GDP and 41% of exports, making it highly vulnerable to external shocks. The fisheries sector is the second pillar of the economy, with growing investor interest in the blue economy sector.\n\nGrowth reached 8.9 % in 2022 and is expected to moderate to 3.3 % in 2023, driven by modest increases in tourism, particularly from key markets in Europe impacted by tight monetary conditions and the war in Ukraine. In 2023 Q3, employment decreased by 0.2%, while average earnings saw a 4.8% increase compared with the same quarter in 2022 due to an upward revision to public sector wages. Heavy rainfall, landslides, floods in the north of Mahé island, and a massive explosion in a critical industrial zone damaged commercial buildings, houses, and public infrastructure at the end of 2023. This incident has impacted growth and increased household vulnerability in the affected areas.\n\nThe appreciation of the rupee and moderation in global commodity prices in 2023 contributed to declining domestic prices, with year-end inflation of -2.7 %. However, inflation is projected to increase to 3.4% in 2024, averaging 2.5% in the medium term, reflecting increases in domestic utility tariffs to be implemented in 2024. The Seychelles government remains committed to fiscal prudence after successive consolidation efforts implemented since 2021, which has improved the economy’s resilience in addressing external shocks. Public debt is on a sustainable path and has declined to 60.1% of GDP in 2023. The banking sector has remained liquid and well-capitalized, with a slight increase in non-performing loans to 8.1% in December 2023 (from 7.6% in December 2022), reflecting the removal of COVID-19 pandemic forbearance measures on businesses. The current account deficit narrowed to an estimated 5.6% of GDP in 2023. The deficit is financed by foreign direct investments, equivalent to 13.8% of GDP, primarily from investments in hotels and resorts. The country’s foreign exchange reserves increased to $681 million in 2023, equivalent to 3.8 months of imports.\n\nDevelopment Challenges\n\nSeychelles faces development challenges centered on enhancing productivity and boosting overall economic performance to foster greater shared prosperity. Labor earnings have been central to reducing poverty, yet labor and skills shortages and a growing rate of teenage pregnancy, as well as drug and alcohol addiction, constrain further advances. Some related institutional challenges are notable barriers to starting and operating businesses, inefficiencies in public sector management, such as limited statistical capacity, scope for a more strategic and sustainable approach to social protection, and the need to broaden access to quality education and skills development. Climate change adaptation is also essential through improvements in disaster preparedness systems and enhanced coastal management. Near-term priorities include maintaining debt sustainability and continued reform of the social protection system to support the most vulnerable. In the medium term, the focus will be increasing revenues and boosting capital expenditures to invest in climate change mitigation. As part of the structural reform agenda, revenue administration, public financial management, and governance could be prioritized, including a digitalization strategy and the reform of state-owned enterprises.\n\nLast Updated: Apr 08, 2024\n\nThe overarching objective of the World Bank Group’s (WBG) Seychelles Country Partnership Framework (CPF) FY18-FY23, prepared in close consultation with the government, private sector, and other development stakeholders, is consolidating the country’s path to inclusive and sustainable prosperity. The strategy delineates the two mutually reinforcing focus areas of shared prosperity and inclusion and public-sector performance. This entails retooling the fisheries and tourism core economy for sustainability and inclusion along the lines of the government’s flagship Blue Economy Program and strengthening the management and resilience of natural resources, including a better understanding of disaster and climate risks and building capacity to manage them.\n\nThe CPF supports a shift in focus towards building the human capital of the bottom 40% of the population to enable them to participate in new, expanding opportunities. Finally, it seeks to consolidate resilience in public finances by increasing efficiency, improving the state's regulatory capacity to foster space for the private sector, and setting the foundations for transparency and accountability.\n\nThe World Bank portfolio in Seychelles stands at $80 million (including national projects and budget support) as of February 2024. The active advisory and knowledge portfolio includes one Reimbursable Advisory Services (RAS) on Financial Sector Development. The World Bank is also preparing a Public Expenditure Review, which provides further reforms (including suggestions on refining existing measures) to create fiscal space, improve spending efficiency, and strengthen resilience. A Country Economic Memorandum is also planned to focus on jobs and raising productivity to meet the needs of an increasingly knowledge-based economy while promoting resilience. The World Bank is working with the Government to prepare a Solid Waste Management Project that aims to improve the financial and environmental performance of the waste management sector. It also seeks to strengthen the private sector to better engage in the circular economy.\n\nLast Updated: Apr 08, 2024\n\nTo support the country’s response to the social and economic fallout caused by COVID-19, the World Bank disbursed a $7 million Catastrophe Drawdown Loan (Cat-DDO) in April 2020 and provided an additional $15 million credit from the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD) in July 2020. The Development Policy Lending was utilized to enhance the country’s response mechanisms in health, social protection, and the private sector and to support the country’s post-crisis recovery through strengthened financial systems and climate resilience. Further budget support has been provided through the Seychelles Fiscal Sustainability and Climate Resilience Development Policy Financing series of three operations that aim to (i) strengthen medium‐term fiscal sustainability, (ii) build resilience, and (iii) promote policies for inclusive and sustainable growth. A combined total of $85 million has been disbursed under the first (FY2022), second (FY2023), and third (FY2024) operations.\n\nUnder the Southwest Indian Ocean Fisheries Governance and Shared Growth Program (SWIOFish3), the Bank supports managing and conserving marine protected areas, sustainable fisheries, and seafood value chains in the Seychelles. The project draws on the proceeds of the Seychelles Blue Bond ($15 million). It is supported by a $5 million guarantee and $5 million loan from the IBRD, a $5 million concessional loan, and a $5,292,110 grant from the Global Environment Facility (GEF). The Government of Seychelles issued this first-ever sovereign Blue Bond in October 2018. The Blue Bond is an innovative financing mechanism to mobilize private sector investment to support the blue economy. The proceeds are used to capitalize a Blue Grants Fund ($3 million) managed by the Seychelles Conservation and Climate Adaptation Trust (SeyCCAT) and a Blue Investment Fund) managed by the Development Bank of Seychelles (DBS).\n\nLast Updated: Apr 08, 2024"
