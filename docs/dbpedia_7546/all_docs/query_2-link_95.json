        "text": "A large part of the work of the Members of the National Assembly takes place in Committees, that are constitutionally empowered; where policy issues are considered, the work and expenditure of the Government is analysed and proposals for legislation examined and investigated. But how are Committees constitutionally empowered?\n\nHon. Flory Larue, Hon. Wilbert Herminie, Hon Paul Ernesta, Hon Sebastien Pillay and Hon Churchil Gill explain the work of Committees and how the Constitution guides this work!\n\nArticle 77 of our Constitution states that ‘there shall be a National Assembly of Seychelles’ and Article 85 states that ‘the legislative powers of the Seychelles is vested in the National Assembly’. But what does this all mean?\n\nHon Ahmed Afif , Hon Francois Adelaide , Hon Stephen Pillay , Hon Clifford Andre and Hon Audrey Vidot explain the legislative powers of the institution and how this is done in accordance with the Constitution."
