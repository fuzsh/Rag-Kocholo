        "text": "Like many island nations, Seychelles is densely populated with 186 people per square kilometers (483/sq mi), which ranks 60th in the world. The capital and largest city, Victoria, has a population of 25,000, or more than 25% of the country's population.\n\nSeychelles Demographics\n\nDuring the British control of Seychelles, French upper class were allowed to retain their land, and both French and British settlers used African slaves and later indentured Indian servants, despite the British prohibition on slavery in 1835. This led to a small minority population of Indians on the island, as well as Chinese, and the Gran'bla (\"big whites\") of French origin controlling politics and the economy.\n\nToday, there are descendants of the Indian, Chinese and Gran'bla making up ethnic communities in Seychelles, although most people are of black African origin, often with mixed European or Asian heritage. Seychelles has no indigenous population, and the current population is composed of immigrants and their descendants.\n\nThe ethnic breakdown is 93% Seychellois Creole, 3% British, 1.8% French, 0.5% Chinese, 0.3% Indian and 1.2% other.\n\nMost Seychelles are Christians, with 82% of the population adhering to Roman Catholicism. 2% of the population practices Hinduism while 1% practices Islam."
