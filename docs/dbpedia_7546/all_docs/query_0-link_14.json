Either \"Seychellois\" or my French raises eyebrows.\n\n(In fact, when I say \"Seychelles\" I give people a couple of seconds to recall what \"Seychelles\" is. The most common reply is \"What's that\" or \"Sea shell what?\").\n\nIn this case, I think \"Seychelles company\" is easier to understand. I'll stick to it.\n\nThank you.\n\nEither. With many countries they'd be about equally common: a Mauritius company = a Mauritian company. The problem is just whether everyone knows the word 'Seychellois'. With more familiar countries we'd usually use the adjective, but as you go to less familiar, it becomes more difficult to know what the adjective is."
