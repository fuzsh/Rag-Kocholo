        "text": "Arkansas: Liam Hemsworth and John Malkovich star in trailer\n\nKill Bill Vol 3 is a sequel Quentin Tarantino has said he’d like to make on a number of occasions. The movie would follow the grown-up daughter of Copperhead who witnessed Uma Thurman’s Beatrix Kiddo murder her mother as a child in the opening of Kill Bill Vol 1. The Bride told little Nikki Bell that if she wanted to seek revenge one day, she’d be waiting.\n\nNow Copperhead actress Vivica A Fox, who was promoting her new movie Arkansas, has revealed exclusively to Express.co.uk that she would “absolutely” love to feature in flashback scenes for a Kill Bill Vol 3.\n\nAnd initially, she backed the child actress from Kill Bill Vol 1's opening to play her daughter again, but this time all grown-up.\n\nThe 55-year-old said: “I think they should go after the young girl who did it, Ambrosia Kelley.\n\n“She’s beautiful, I hope she’s still acting.”\n\nREAD MORE: Once Upon A Time In Hollywood: THIS star had a ‘DISASTROUS audition’\n\nBut then Fox added: “If not, if I could have my dream daughter? Zendaya. She’s tall, she’s got those long legs; she would kick ass!”\n\nThe actress shot the incredible fight scene at the start of Kill Bill Vol 1 in just four days, after training for six months.\n\nThey destroyed a different part of the house every day and Fox did most of her stunts.\n\nShe said: “I pretty much did everything except for crashing into the glass table.”\n\nInvalid email\n\nWe use your sign-up to provide content in ways you've consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Fox).\n\n“Swin settles into his day job but, against orders, takes up a relationship with a local woman (Eden Brolin), while Kyle spends his nights trying to discover Frog’s identity.\n\n“As they begin to grapple for control of the lucrative underworld operation, Swin and Kyle soon find themselves under Frog’s deadly crosshairs. Who will live to survive as the boss of Arkansas’ fierce drug trade?”\n\nArkansas is available on Digital Download July 13 & DVD July 20 from Lionsgate UK."
