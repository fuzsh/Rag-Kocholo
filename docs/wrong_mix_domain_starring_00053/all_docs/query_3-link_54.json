        "text": "Any music fan knows that it’s almost impossible to replicate the feeling of attending a music festival. The sheer joy of seeing bands perform on a massive stage is hard to beat, but when a music festival is too far away or too pricy, we have great music movies to fill the void. The best music movies remind us of the joy that music brings us and also the way that the music industry can swallow up many of the stars it creates.\n\nOf course, it also helps if these movies have really good music to back them up. Ultimately, though, these music movies serve as inspiration for every aspiring musician. Whether they’re actually true stories or they just feel like true stories, every great music movie should leave you moved and excited about the possibilities of music.\n\nHere are the best music movies to stream now.\n\nRecommended Videos\n\nAlmost Famous (2000)\n\n90%\n\n7.9/10\n\nr\n\n122m\n\nGenre\n\nDrama, Music\n\nStars\n\nPatrick Fugit, Billy Crudup, Kate Hudson\n\nDirected by\n\nCameron Crowe\n\nWatch on Paramount+\n\nWhat more needs to be said about Cameron Crowe’s Y2K classic? The film takes place in ’73 and follows an aspiring young music journalist during the heyday of Rolling Stone magazine. The classic rock songs written for make-believe band Stillwater feel as though they could be the work of Zeppelin, Skynyrd, or the Allman Brothers. And Kate Hudson’s character, Penny Lane (inspired by Pennie Trumbull), is as delightful and freewheeling as they come.\n\nAlmost Famous (2000) Trailer #1 | Movieclips Classic Trailers\n\nThis Is Spinal Tap (1984)\n\n92%\n\n7.9/10\n\nr\n\n82m\n\nGenre\n\nMusic, Comedy\n\nStars\n\nChristopher Guest, Michael McKean, Harry Shearer\n\nDirected by\n\nRob Reiner\n\nWatch on Amazon\n\nThis examination of fake English glam-hair-metal band Spinal Tap is absolutely hilarious. One of writer Christopher Guest’s greatest gifts to the public, the 1984 film is as absurd and intoxicating as ever. The scuzzy music steals the show, but the outstanding wardrobe, stage layouts, and picture-perfect depiction of rock star ridiculousness aren’t far behind.\n\nSummer of Soul (...or, When the Revolution Could Not Be Televised) (2021)\n\n96%\n\n8/10\n\npg-13\n\n117m\n\nGenre\n\nDocumentary, Music\n\nStars\n\nStevie Wonder, Lin-Manuel Miranda, Jesse Jackson\n\nDirected by\n\nQuestlove\n\nWatch on Disney+\n\nThe summer of 1969 is often remembered for the legendary performances that took place at Woodstock. Meanwhile, an amazing festival unfolded in Harlem, drawing some of the best talent of the time. This powerful and wonderfully scored music doc breaks down the Harlem Cultural Festival, a true showcase and celebration of Black music that drew 300,000 people over the course of a single summer. We’re talking Stevie Wonder, Gladys Knight, B.B. King, and so many more. Better, it’s a fantastic directorial debut from musician Questlove.\n\nSingles (1992)\n\n71%\n\n6.7/10\n\n99m\n\nGenre\n\nComedy, Drama, Romance\n\nStars\n\nBridget Fonda, Campbell Scott, Kyra Sedgwick\n\nDirected by\n\nCameron Crowe\n\nWatch on Amazon\n\nThe ’92 film is another by Crowe and paints a lovely portrait of love and music during Seattle’s most famous era to date. Actual stars like Chris Cornell (RIP) and Eddie Vedder enter the mix, and the vignettes of struggling relationships capture perfectly what it’s like to try to grow up without losing the part of yourself that loved going to shows and being rebellious. It’s a rom-com that swaps the cheese for the best of Gen X noise.\n\nPurple Rain (1984)\n\n55%\n\n6.5/10\n\n111m\n\nGenre\n\nDrama, Music, Romance\n\nStars\n\nPrince, Apollonia Kotero, Morris Day\n\nDirected by\n\nAlbert Magnoli\n\nWatch on Amazon\n\nThe grandaddy of them all, Purple Rain is pretty much the role model for great music films. Here, Prince shows his unrivaled ability as a dynamic pop-rock god, part sweet-talking, bike-riding crooner, part electric-guitar-wielding badass. The barn-burning 1984 movie is like one long music video, drenched in purple and never easing off the gas. After you watch it, you’ll wish you could be even 10 percent as cool as Prince was then.\n\nThe Sound of Music (1965)\n\n63%\n\n8.1/10\n\ng\n\n175m\n\nGenre\n\nDrama, Family, Music, Romance\n\nStars\n\nJulie Andrews, Christopher Plummer, Eleanor Parker\n\nDirected by\n\nRobert Wise\n\nWatch on Disney+\n\nThe iconic 1965 film is too vital not to include, even if it’s very obviously a musical. It raked in five Oscars and is typically included in every “best films of all time” shortlist, music-themed or otherwise. A triumph of singing over not, culture over Nazis, and Julie Andrews over anything, The Sound of Music makes you want to frolic through the countryside with reckless abandon. And the Rodgers and Hammerstein score is both pure joy and one of the most successful soundtrack LPs ever.\n\nThe Sound of Music (1965) Trailer #1 | Movieclips Classic Trailers\n\nHigh Fidelity (2000)\n\n79%\n\n7.4/10\n\n113m\n\nGenre\n\nComedy, Drama, Romance, Music\n\nStars\n\nJohn Cusack, Iben Hjejle, Todd Louiso\n\nDirected by\n\nStephen Frears\n\nWatch on Hulu\n\nReleased in 2000, High Fidelity is high on the list of the best John Cusack movies of all time. It’s a film with scenes that burrow deep into your psyche and likely inspired millions of thoughtful mix tapes assembled for love interests across the globe. Apparently, settling on a soundtrack was one of the hardest parts of production, which is unsurprising given that the film focuses on a music snob as its main character. But the sonic backdrop does the film proud, featuring the likes of Bill Callahan, Roky Erickson, the Beta Band, Bob Dylan, and more. If you didn’t have a vinyl collection before watching this movie, you’ll surely start one after.\n\nHigh Fidelity (2000) Trailer #1 | Movieclips Classic Trailers\n\nInside Llewyn Davis (2013)\n\n93%\n\n7.4/10\n\n104m\n\nGenre\n\nDrama, Music\n\nStars\n\nOscar Isaac, Carey Mulligan, Justin Timberlake\n\nDirected by\n\nJoel Coen, Ethan Coen\n\nWatch on Hulu\n\nThere are countless films that deal with the plight of folk singer-songwriters, but this happens to be one of the best. Tempting as it was to include Crazy Heart, it was 2013’s Inside Llewyn Davis that ultimately earned this particular slot. Maybe it’s the Coen brothers’ mystical effect, or maybe it’s the understated soundtrack. It’s a gorgeous take on the art scene of Greenwich Village circa 1961, led by up-and-coming Oscar Isaac (who performed many of the songs himself). With T. Bone Burnett as the executive music producer, the film also has a folk-infused soundtrack that feels both contemporary and of its time. Llewyn Davis is not always sympathetic, but that doesn’t make Inside Llewyn Davis any less compelling.\n\nA Star Is Born (2018)\n\n88%\n\n7.6/10\n\n136m\n\nGenre\n\nMusic, Drama, Romance\n\nStars\n\nLady Gaga, Bradley Cooper, Sam Elliott\n\nDirected by\n\nBradley Cooper\n\nWatch on Amazon\n\nIt’s not often that a film can prove that an actor can be a musician and vice versa. La La Land is a great example of the former, but A Star Is Born does both swimmingly. Lady Gaga flexes her acting muscles, while Bradley Cooper shows that in another life, he could have just as easily been a drunken country-rock legend. Cooper’s downfall, in particular, is so gripping — and unfortunately so commonplace among great rock stars — that you just might contemplate setting down the beer for good. Better still, original tracks like “Shallow” and “Maybe It’s Time” would be hits even if they were written just for headphones and speakers. It’s not the first time this story has been filmed (and probably not the last), but the 2018 version is far and away the best.\n\nLove & Mercy (2015)\n\n80%\n\n7.4/10\n\npg-13\n\n120m\n\nGenre\n\nDrama, Music, History\n\nStars\n\nErin Darke, John Cusack, Joanna Going\n\nDirected by\n\nBill Pohlad\n\nWatch on Amazon\n\nIn a masterful biopic of the great Brian Wilson of the Beach Boys, John Cusack and Paul Dano team up to embody the early and late stages of his life, full of turmoil and mental imbalance. Switching between different times in Wilson’s life, we witness an adaptation of a younger Wilson (Dano also magnificently performs the songs himself) as he quits touring to produce the timeless album Pet Sounds, slipping slowly and steadily into psychosis. Cutting to the future, Cusack plays an older and broken Wilson, psychologically limited and trapped under controversial 24-hour therapy tactics from the infamous Dr. Eugene Landy. Beautiful and tragic, we witness the many shattered pieces of Wilson’s psyche as he single-handedly competes with the world-famous Beatles to create some of the best music ever written. This movie should not be missed by any music lovers.\n\nLove & Mercy Official Trailer #1 (2015) - Brian Wilson Biopic HD\n\nWhiplash (2014)\n\n88%\n\n8.5/10\n\nr\n\n107m\n\nGenre\n\nDrama, Music\n\nStars\n\nMiles Teller, J.K. Simmons, Paul Reiser\n\nDirected by\n\nDamien Chazelle\n\nWatch on Amazon\n\nThis excellent 2014 film spotlights a percussionist, one of the least-featured musician types in all of cinema. The movie’s focus is on the brutality that often feels necessary for greatness, and it instantly puts Damien Chazelle on the map. J.K. Simmons is at his best, playing a merciless, drill-sergeant-like instructor at a music academy. It’s intense, immensely dramatic, and filmed beautifully.\n\nWhiplash TRAILER 1 (2014) - J.K. Simmons, Miles Teller Movie HD\n\nA Hard Day's Night (1964)\n\n88m\n\nGenre\n\nComedy, Music\n\nStars\n\nJohn Lennon, Paul McCartney, George Harrison\n\nDirected by\n\nRichard Lester\n\nWatch on Amazon\n\nA Hard Day’s Night is a mockumentary musical comedy film starring The Beatles in their feature film debut. It follows a fictionalized version of a “typical” two days in the lives of the band members John, Paul, George, and Ringo. The film portrays the chaos and excitement surrounding The Beatles’ meteoric rise to fame. It uses a mockumentary approach, blending scripted scenes with candid moments and glimpses into the behind-the-scenes world of the band. While there’s not a complex plot, the film hilariously depicts the challenges they face dealing with a demanding manager, escaping screaming fans, trying to write new songs amid the frenzy, and Paul’s mischievous grandfather adding to the mayhem. The lighthearted and fun film captures the energy and cultural phenomenon of The Beatles in the early 1960s.\n\nBird (1988)\n\n78%\n\n7.1/10\n\nr\n\n161m\n\nGenre\n\nDrama, Music\n\nStars\n\nForest Whitaker, Diane Venora, Keith David\n\nDirected by\n\nClint Eastwood\n\nWatch on Amazon\n\nBird chronicles the incredible life of Charlie Parker, arguably the greatest sax player of all time. It’s a Clint Eastwood joint, released in 1988 with Forest Whitaker playing the lead. Even if you’re not a jazz nut, you’ll adore the atmosphere of it all, with a backdrop of smoky lounges and Parker wowing the audience with his unmatched chops and improvisational wizardry.\n\nBird (1988) - Trailer - Clint Eastwood\n\nRocketman (2019)\n\n69%\n\n7.3/10\n\nr\n\n121m\n\nGenre\n\nMusic, Drama, History\n\nStars\n\nTaron Egerton, Jamie Bell, Richard Madden\n\nDirected by\n\nDexter Fletcher\n\nWatch on Amazon\n\nThis biopic of epic proportions follows the extraordinary rise of Elton John. There’s partying, drugs, wild performances, amazing wardrobe displays, and some truly incredible acting from Taron Egerton. It’s hard to imagine a time when Elton wasn’t an international sensation at the top of his game, but this movie reveals those early, raucous days in hyper-entertaining fashion.\n\nThe Doors (1991)\n\n62%\n\n7.2/10\n\nr\n\n140m\n\nGenre\n\nMusic, Drama\n\nStars\n\nVal Kilmer, Meg Ryan, Kyle MacLachlan\n\nDirected by\n\nOliver Stone\n\nWatch on Paramount+\n\nThere’s hardly a more captivating personality in music history than Jim Morrison, and that’s saying something. The Doors focuses on the poetic and eccentric frontman, played expertly by Val Kilmer. As an Oliver Stone flick, it feels very authentic, set in the heyday of psychedelic surf rock, AKA Venice, California in the ’60s. The movie unapologetically embraces all of the cliches associated with rock stardom, from the sex and drugs to the pompousness and anti-establishment leanings. And you’re even treated to some excellent supporting work from Meg Ryan.\n\nThe Doors (1991) Official Movie Trailer\n\nStraight Outta Compton (2015)\n\n147m\n\nGenre\n\nDrama, Music, History\n\nStars\n\nO'Shea Jackson Jr., Corey Hawkins, Jason Mitchell\n\nDirected by\n\nF. Gary Gray\n\nWatch on Apple TV+\n\nOne of the surprise hits of its year, Straight Outta Compton was an unflinching portrait of how N.W.A. became one of the biggest rap groups in the country. Featuring astounding performances from its young ensemble, Straight Outta Compton is also about the way the West Coast hip-hop scene was heavily influenced by the War on Drugs and by the mistreatment each of these men experienced at the hands of the police. It’s a shocking, gripping film that became an enormous sensation and launched several members of its young cast to stardom.\n\nStraight Outta Compton - Official Trailer (HD)\n\nMovie images and data from:\n\nMark Stock is a writer from Portland, Oregon.
