He was portrayed by Wax.\n\nInformation on the rapper\n\nQuentin Jerome Tarantino was born on March 27th, 1963, in Knoxville, Tennessee. He is a film director, screenwriter, cinematographer, producer, and actor.\n\nTarantino's films are characterized by non-linear storylines, satirical subject matter, an aestheticization of violence, and extended scenes of dialogue, and categorized by the genres of neo-noir film, crime dramas, war films, and spaghetti Westerns. Some of his most renowned works are movies such as Reservoir Dogs, Pulp Fiction, Kill Bill Vol. 1 & 2, Inglourious Basterds, and Django Unchained.\n\nTarantino has also starred in several films, including From Dusk till Dawn, which he wrote the screenplay for, and Four Rooms, which he co-directed. He has also made several cameos in his own films as minor characters or as a narrator. In Pulp Fiction, he portrayed Jimmie Dimmick, a friend of Jules Winnfield, who assists him and Vincent Vega in disposing of a dead body.\n\nTarantino's work has garnered both critical and commercial success. He has received many industry awards, including two Academy Awards, two Golden Globe Awards, two BAFTA Awards, and the Palme d'Or, and has been nominated for an Emmy and a Grammy. He was named one of the 100 Most Influential People in the World by Time in 2005, and filmmaker and historian Peter Bogdanovich called him \"the single most influential director of his generation\".\n\nLyrics\n\nCut!
