        "text": "Born as German bombs rained down on Liverpool, England, on October 9, 1940, John Lennonâs life was remarkable, if not controversial, from day one. Best known as the founder of The Beatles, who many claim, perhaps misguidedly, created rock-and-roll as we know it, Lennon became equally regarded for his hot takes on politics, religion, and even his own bandmates.\n\nThroughout the forty-plus years since Lennonâs untimely death, his place in pop culture has morphed from beloved musician to god-like figureâa full-circle status for a man who once got himself into some hot water for proclaiming that The Beatles were âbigger than Jesus.â\n\nIn celebration of what would have been Lennonâs 81st birthday, weâre sharing some fun, quirky, and downright unbelievable facts about one of musicâs most legendary personalities.\n\nHe Was Raised by His Aunt, Who Discouraged Him From Pursuing Music\n\nAfter his parents separated when he was four years old, Lennon was sent to live at his Aunt Mimiâs house, where he spent his childhood getting into trouble, creating art, and developing a keen interest in music.\n\nThough his father was absent in his life, Lennon would frequently visit his mother, Julia, who taught him how to play the banjo and bought him his first guitar behind her sisterâs back. Mimi did not support his musical interests, famously telling him, âthe guitarâs all very well, John, but youâll never make a living out of it.â\n\nOn July 6, 1957, Lennon was playing a show with his skiffle band, The Quarrymen, when one of his bandmatesâ friends rolled up on his bicycle, introducing himself as Paul McCartney.\n\nThough McCartney was two years younger, the two quickly bonded over their love of music. McCartney taught Lennon how to tune a six-string guitar and joined the band only two weeks later, shortly before introducing Lennon to another friendâGeorge Harrison.\n\nBy 1960, The Quarrymen had dropped a few members, picked up Ringo Starr, and changed their name to The Beatles.\n\nLennon's âteddy Boyâ Antics Got Him Kicked Out of Art School\n\nBy fall of that year, Lennon was splitting his attention between the band and attending Liverpool College of Art, where Aunt Mimi pulled some strings to get him in despite failing his exams.\n\nA self-described Teddy Boy , Lennon wore the Edwardian-era style menswear, complete with drainpipe trousers and drape jackets, with an attitude to match. His wit and disruptive nature werenât exactly welcomed in the classroom, resulting in Lennon spending a lot of time in detention, being excluded from classes, and ultimately being given the boot in his final year.\n\nThough he didnât leave with a diploma, he did leave with a serious girlfriendâCynthia Powell, with whom he had a son.\n\nLennon Had a Violent Streak and Almost Beat His Close Friend to Death\n\nThough he was transformed into a symbol of peace and love in the wake of his death, Lennon was no saint while living and was especially prone to violent outbursts in his younger years.\n\nOn June 18, 1963, Lennon attended McCartneyâs 21st birthday party at the Cavern Club, where disc jockey and close friend of The Beatles, Bob Wooler, made a joke at Lennonâs expense. In a blind drunken rage, Lennon gave Wooler a brutal beating , kicking him in the ribs and hitting him with a stick as he lay stunned on the ground. According to Lennon, he stopped the attack because he realized he was going to kill him.\n\nThis was no isolated incident, as Lennon didnât reserve his outbursts for his friends. Lennon was known to have a nasty temper and became enraged with jealousy very easily, physically and verbally lashing out at his wife and young son.\n\nLennon acknowledged his violent history in a Playboy interview that took place two days before his death, saying, âI used to be cruel to my woman and physicallyâ¦ any woman. I was a hitter. I couldnât express myself and I hit. I fought men and I hit women. That is why I am always on about peace, you see. It is the most violent people who go for love and peaceâ¦ I am a violent man who has learned not to be violent and regrets his violence. I will have to be a lot older before I can face in public how I treated women as a youngster.â\n\nLennonâs son, Julian, was only five years old when his father left him and Powell after falling in love with Yoko Ono. Having experienced the dark side of Lennon firsthand, Julian has referred to his father as a hypocrite, saying, âDad could talk about peace and love out loud to the world, but he could never show it to the people who supposedly meant the most to him: his wife and son.â\n\nLennon Hated the Sound of His Own Voice and Was Deeply Dissatisfied With the Beatles' Records\n\nDespite being consistently named one of the greatest singers and songwriters of all time, Lennon hated his voice and was extremely critical of his work with The Beatles.\n\nEver self-deprecating, Lennon would frequently double-track his vocals and ask producer George Martin if he could âsmother it with tomato ketchup or something.â\n\nOne day in particular always stood out to Lennon as the day that ruined his voiceâFebruary 11, 1963. The Beatles spent the entire day recording 10 songs for their debut album, Please Please Me. At the end of the session, it was time to take on âTwist and Shout,â which Lennon said nearly killed him and his already-hoarse voice.\n\nâMy voice wasnât the same for a long time after; every time I swallowed, it was like sandpaper. I was always bitterly ashamed of it because I could sing better than that.â\n\nLennon was so critical of The Beatlesâ work that at one point, he told Martin he wanted to re-record every song theyâd ever done, âespecially Strawberry Fields.â\n\nLennon Was a Notoriously Terrible Driver\n\nIt should come as no surprise that the man who Martin said â couldnât change a lightbulb â wouldnât be great at operating a vehicle.\n\nIn 1969, just a few years after getting his license at the ripe old age of 25, Lennon panicked while driving in Scotland with Julian, Ono, and her daughter Kyoko, crashing his Austin Maxi in spectacular fashion.\n\nLennon, Ono, and Kyoko all ended up needing stitches on their faces, with Ono suffering a back injury as well. Julian was treated for shock but was otherwise unscathed in the accident.\n\nAfter being released from the hospital five days later, Lennon told reporters, âIf youâre going to have a car crash, try to arrange for it to happen in the Highlands. The hospital there was just great.â\n\nAll jokes aside, the event affected Lennon deeply and moved him to surrender his license once and for all.\n\nThough he couldnât drive it, he did keep his famous psychedelic Rolls Royce Phantom V until donating it to the Smithsonian Institutionâs Cooper-Hewitt Museum in 1977 as a form of settlement for a $250,000 tax bill.\n\nThe car remained at Cooper-Hewitt until 1985, when it was sold at auction to our very own Jim Pattinson for $2.29-million, making it the most expensive car in the world.\n\nAfter being on display at various Ripleyâs Believe it or Not museums, the car landed at the transportation-themed Expo â86 in Vancouver before Pattinson donated it to the province of British Columbia in 1987. The car is now valued at $7 million.\n\nLennon's Vietnam War Protests Landed Him on Nixon's Enemy List\n\nLennon was passionate about using his platform to bring awareness to issues he believed in, such as the need for America to end its war with Vietnam.\n\nCapitalizing on their place in the pop culture zeitgeist, Lennon and Ono arranged their honeymoon as a â Bed-In for Peace ,â during which they stayed in a bed at the Amsterdam Hilton Hotel for a full week while giving the press the chance to ask questions between 9 a.m. and 9 p.m. each day.\n\nThree months later, they performed another Bed-In, this time at the Queen Elizabeth Hotel in Montreal, during which the couple wrote the iconic protest anthem, âGive Peace A Chance.â\n\nThe Bed-Ins may not have changed any war policies, but it did get Lennon put on Nixonâs enemy list. When Lennon and Ono moved to the U.S. in 1971, Lennon unintentionally thrust himself into an ongoing battle with immigration services, which claimed their hesitation was due to a 1968 drug conviction.\n\nAfter Lennonâs death, historian Jon Wiener filed for the FBI to declassify government documents revealing that the Nixon administration was directly responsible for Lennonâs constant threat of deportation in response to his anti-Vietnam views.\n\nLennon's Final Concert Appearance Was the Outcome of a Lost Bet With Elton John\n\nAfter recording âWhatever Gets You Thru the Nightâ with Elton John in 1974, the pair made a bet with John saying the single would reach #1 in the U.S. and Lennon agreeing to do a performance with John at Madison Square Garden if he lost.\n\nOn November 16, 1974, the song topped the Hot 100 chart, setting the stage for Lennon to join John on stage only 12 days later for renditions of âLucy in the Sky with Diamondsâ and âI Saw Her Standing There.â It was the last time Lennon ever performed in a concert setting.\n\nOne of the Last Photos Ever Taken of Lennon Alive Was With His Murderer\n\nPerhaps the last photograph of John Lennon was taken on December 8, 1980, as he signed a copy of Double Fantasy for a fan. That fan just so happened to be Mark David Chapman, who would return to murder Lennon outside of his home in New Yorkâs Upper West Side only five hours later.\n\nLennonâs final words before Chapman shot four bullets into his back were in response to Ono asking him if he wanted to go out for dinner, to which he replied, âNo, letâs go home because I want to see Sean (their son) before he goes to sleep.â\n\nRather than hosting an elaborate funeral to honor her famous husband, Ono quietly had Lennonâs body cremated and never disclosed where his ashes were scattered â although it was likely somewhere in New Yorkâs Central Park.\n\nAnd in the Endâ¦\n\nThe world quickly caught wind of the public assassination, with masses flocking to his home to pay tribute to Lennon and the media portraying him through rose-colored glasses as a peace-loving family man who changed the world through music. As Paul McCartney put it in the â80s, âSince his death, heâs become Martin Luther Lennon.â\n\nIn reality, Lennon was a walking contradiction and dynamic personality whose biting sense of humor, overload of talent, and distinct self-awareness turned a critic of idolization into one of the most worshipped musicians in the world.\n\nâEveryone always talks about a good thing coming to an end, as if life was over. But Iâll be 40 when this interview comes outâ¦ weâre all relatively young people. The game isnât over yet.â â John Lennon to Playboy , December 7, 1980."
