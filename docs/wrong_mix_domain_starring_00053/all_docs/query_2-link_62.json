Tess wants dominion over low-key wine nights and cats, and Meredith wants to be the goddess responsible for avenging wronged women. Fitting!\n\nThey move on to reveal the early winner in the head-to-head showdown between our two new product releases â€” Delve Deck: Joy Edition and Delve Deck: Venting Edition. The victor may surprise you!\n\nThe episode wraps up with them answering questions from each new deck â€” \"what aspect of getting older do you look forward to most?\" from Joy Edition, and \"what food do you hate to buy because you know it will go bad before you finish it?
