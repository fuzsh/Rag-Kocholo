The girls end up wrecking the Mopar to get revenge on Stuntman Mike (Kurt Russell). The film ends without ever acknowledging what happens to Lee— a disturbing fact when you consider that Jasper is played by Jonathan Loughran, the very same actor who played the trucker attacker in Tarantino's Kill Bill Volume 1. Add to this the fact that Lee's friends tell Jasper that she's an ‘adult film’ actress, and it's a set-up for a bad ending. Plus, even if Jasper's a good guy, when he finds out his car was destroyed he's going to lose it. There’s a very good chance that Lee meets her maker in Death Proof, and Tarantino's all the more the master for letting the thought - intentionally or not - linger on in our minds.”\".",
