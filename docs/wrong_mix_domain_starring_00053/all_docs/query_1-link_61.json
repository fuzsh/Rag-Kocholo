Now, at this time of year when brahma is in brahma… The day of brahma is set to last one thousand years and its night is of equal length. Well, for us human beings, this is the end of the year now and our minds turns towards what is laughably called the future. No mind can comprehend the infinite and absolute anon munsch mars stunvelly humpff, as we say in the Himalayas. Now let me tell you, my resolution of the year 1979 is to renounce complete everything, but complete luxury and self indulgence.\n\nNow I suggest this is going to be very, very difficult, very difficult indeed. I feel it’s my duty, not only as a human being but as a person or was it not George Formby who said there are four billion three hundred and twenty million mortal or earth years which is one day of brahma. So, one way of looking at it is simply not to look at it at all. And that’s exactly what we’re going to be doing now. You are settled down, deeply, I hope, and comfortably in an easy chair and then, lay back, put the incense on, light the candles and give yourself a hard time.\n\nMucho Mungo\n\nMucho Mungo, sweet thing\n\nSweetest little thing I’ve ever seen\n\nMust have been a sweet dream brought you here\n\nBrought you through the sorrow and the tears\n\nC’est la, c’est la, c’est la vie\n\nSail upon the ocean, sail with me\n\nSail into the moment every day\n\nSail into the sunshine through the haze\n\nSatire 1\n\nLord, take this make-up off of of me\n\nI said, “Lordy, lordy, lordy, take this makeup off of me”\n\nIt’s bad enough on the beach\n\nBut it’s worse in the sea\n\nBecause I’m knocking on heaven’s door\n\nBecause I’m looking for my ma\n\nI said, “Ma, take these guns away from me”\n\nI said, “Ma, take these guns away from me”\n\nI got so thin now, they’re dragging me down to my knees\n\nOh yeah, man, do you Mr. Jonestown\n\nNow I’ve been here so long, I almost forgot my name\n\nI said, “Lord I been here so long I almost forgot my name”\n\nBut as long as I keep touring\n\nI’ll always be in the game, fame, brain, shame, game, game, fame, fame\n\nSatire 2\n\nWell, thank you, Mr. Jitters\n\nThank you, Mr. Jitters\n\nThe official soviet newspaper said, the temple members have protested the mindless arms race from the filthy war in Vietnam. And were persecuted and finally forced to seek refuge in another country. Wow. Sounds like a ballad to me, oh man Bankok, Thailand, they’ve launched an air-sea search for a fishing boat carrying some four-hundred Vietnamese refugees, the boat was towed back out to sea for a ride in Thailand. Sources said that because of a breakdown in communication. Oh lord, the boat was towed into Thai waters by a German freighter and the Thai navy are unaware that the refugees have been guaranteed a resettlement and worse Germany took the boat out to sea after providing all passengers with provisios\n\nHey, that’s deep man\n\nThe Chinese newspapers have made the first reference to the country’s current wall poster campaign quoting vice premier Cheng Hao Xe Ping. And said that the country’s stable and its leaders are confident and planning modernisation and programs.\n\noh this should get me in the village bar\n\nCheng gave blessing to the campaign but he commented not all the opinions of the masses are carefully thought out nor can we demand that they all be correct. Adding this is nothing terrible. It’ bad enough, but its not terrible. From a prison, Richard Nixon, on his second trip outside the United States, sent his resignation with a smiling hand shaking politician again. Greeting crowds outside his hotel, and trying a little French he sure as hell didn’t try it on Pam Nixon, Mr. Nixon is in Paris and inside this suite to be interviewed on French television. Before of going on to deliver a speech in England, he’ll participate in the French call-in program and said he will answer questions in welsh\n\nThat’s pretty big Mr. M.\n\nAhhh, I’m so cynical, I could just keep on doing this forever because, you know, they ain’t gonna be looking for my golden bunions in a hundred years from now. They’re gonna be selling my socks like Judy Garland. And I hope that they get a good price. I mean, with the inflation and the price of rice. Man, I shouldn’t worry, I own all my songs and I wrote them myself too. I got 24 children, 14 wives, 3 mistresses, 59 accountants, 105 lawyers, 2,000,000 fans, a postage system that never fails to land me in jail. And look through my mail. Perhaps have a garage sale. And you know, go save the whale, and you know, get a boat and go for a sail, and, and, oh, oh, oh, how do you get out of this hell? Stuck inside of a lexicon with the Roger’s thesaurus blues again\n\nSometimes I wish I was just George Harrison, you know got all the answers, oh my god, oh my god\n\nSatire 3\n\nJust a minute! I’m just getting my pyjamas\n\nI’d just want to leave you with this message.\n\nThey say that the best things in life are free, except for on TV\n\nSean’s “In the Sky”\n\n“Daddy, when did we have no house?”\n\n“When?”\n\n“When, when did we have no house and we rented this house?”\n\n“In 1973, we didn’t have this house, yet that’s when we bought this house”\n\n“Oh”\n\n“Two years before you were born”\n\n“Oh, and I wasn’t coming with you to find this house?”\n\n“No, you weren’t born yet, you were still in the sky”\n\n“Oh, and when I came back down here, what did I land in, on?”\n\n“A, a, a little, a little cardboard box with a little blanket in, little teeny tiny, teeny tiny, little Sean Chan in a little tiny cardboard box it used to have apples in it and it used to be just here”\n\n“I never heard of an apple box”\n\n“Well, a little cardboard box, like this like they the bring groceries in and it’s you instead of the groceries”\n\nIt’s Real\n\nInstrumental"
