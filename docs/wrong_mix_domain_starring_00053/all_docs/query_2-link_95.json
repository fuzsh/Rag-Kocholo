        "text": "tl; dr\n\nJohn Lennon himself would be slightly perturbed. He was murdered, and that was a crime, but making a martyr out of him... it's like taking notice of his death rather than his life. His life can't just be summed up by \"give peace a chance\", sorry to say.\n\nNeeds more pictures.\n\nthere is no way i'm reading all of that... esp if its not about britney, ryan gosling or jeffy\n\nHe abandoned his son and wife and then chose to restart with a new son and wife. Everyone goes on about what a great man he was? Bullshit.\n\nI agree. His concern for his fellow humans seemed to have skipped right over Julian.\n\nAre his two sons interviewed for this? I'd think not since both have said he was not the best father.\n\nThen again, how would Sean really know. He was 5 when his dad died and at least John was around for the few years he had with Sean.\n\nJullian was screwed though. He was born in '63 when the Beatles hit it big and barely got to see his dad and they once John left he never, if rarely, saw John. Only right before he died was John making the effort. Quite sad.\n\nActually Sean said in an interview I read (I'll see if I can find it online again) that John didn't really look at him either, even though he lived in the house.\n\nJohn was great because he was REAL. He freely admitted that he had made mistakes. He was very into trying to make people's lives better, but neglected the people closest to him. Except for Yoko, of course, who screeched for everything she felt she was entitled (and still does).\n\nEhh..he and Yoko's relationship wasn't as great as a lot of people believed either. I truly believe that they wouldn't still be together if he was still alive.\n\nJohn Lennon was a hero whose time was cut way to early by a complete fuckin physco.\n\nSometimes I feel like I'm the only person in the world who doesn't like The Beatles, and that makes me feel sad.\n\nhis 1974 \"lost weekend\" phase\n\nI am so tired of every journalist toting that phrase around just waiting for an opportunity to use it. And they almost always use it incorrectly. There's so much drama and legend fed into this \"lost weekend\" bit that it makes you think he shot heroin into his eyeballs and shot up an Olive Garden (well, the 1974 equivalent). He got completely wasted and fucked his assistant. The end (more or less).\n\nThe dude had amazing talent and I love him in the way you love a really great musician you never met. That being said, we all know he could be an asshole, a this, a that. I mean, we're all like that. I hate sugar-coated product that is, seemingly, so obvious.\n\nI don't know.. nevermind.\n\nHe was a man who made several mistakes, often big ones, just like EVERY OTHER HUMAN BEING ON THE FACE OF THE EARTH. He was a human being, not a saint, and although I love him I still think it is wrong to portray him only in a positive light - he made several decisions in his life that I disagree with vehemently, all things that should be included with the things I celebrate him for.\n\nI posted this i thoguht.\n\n\"which had to do with Chapman, a psychotic nerd and homicidal asshole, deciding that Lennon had to pay the price for withdrawing from being the courageous and nervy \"John Lennon\" of legend and turning into a house-husband, abandoning his musical career, ceasing his political activism, etc. \"\n\nWTF? That's new. Chapman was nuts. He thought he was Holden Caulfield and felt Lennon was the epitome of everything bad about fame. That's why he killed him. None of this \"paying the price for withdrawing... from political activism\" garbage.\n\nThat's giving MDC a lot more credit that he deserves. The dude was nuts.\n\nI was really excited for this movie, but statements like that make me not so much. If it turns into a John Lennon propaganda piece, I won't be able to handle it. The guy wasn't saint...just a gifted songwriter who had issues. I mean I love the guy, but that reason alone is one of the reason I do like him so much.\n\ndon't tell me.\n\nyou can comment on the blog directly at hollywood-elsewhere.com\n\nyou have to sign up but its free and easy.\n\n(no subject) - (Anonymous)\n\num, maybe you dont remember john and george openly opposing the war in '66? he started acting out before the 70s; more like '68. and he wasnt even using LSD when they met. it doesnt have anything to do with yokos \"manipulative nature\" like most idiots want to believe, it had to do with his character. read any lennon biography and you'll know he has always been rebellious and acted in this nature from his beginning.\n\nI've been a huge Lennon fan for many years (and not the sanitized version of him) and I agree a lot with your second paragraph. Well, the description of what happened between him and Yoko & his state of mind after years of past daily LSD use. I still think too many people villainize her though and try to make her more evil and even project some of John's bad traits onto her so they can see him as more wonderful and less human than he was. He wanted someone to take that sort of control, and for that I think their relationship was totally consensual and mutual - him wanting direction and her wanting to give it.\n\nThat being said, I speculate that she had fallen out of love with him already by the time he died and was stuck with the role of grieving widow for a man she might not have even stayed married to, hence her treating him like a commodity now and less like a beloved lost husband (I may be wrong, and I'm sure she misses him to some degree.) It sells better for John's image to be the saint and so that is how he is promoted, and bothers me because that's not the person I am interested in seeing or learning about. So I too will stay away from the documentary.\n\nOk, I talk too much.\n\ni think its idiotic that this guys wants to bring all this stuff up. sure he wasnt a saint, no one is and anyone with half a brain knows he was a contradictary man. this guy obviously just gets off to being a stupid asshole and ragging on some poor dead guy and a suffering widow. any widow would want to defend her husbands name, and if they have the power to do so, can you blame them? either way, what good would this documentary do in pointing out the flaws in lennons PERSONAL life? it hasnt nothing to do with his role as an activist.\n\nthe author obviously doesnt even care for lennons music or his role in society, so writing some trashy review is totally pointless. he probably just feels that way because he knows all he can write is trash like this.\n\nAND chapman didnt kill lennon because he hated him! when will people get this? he was obsessed with him, thought he was lennon, and the only way to rid himself of his demons was to kill lennon. jesus.\n\ni would just like to add that this is a documentary on lennons actvism and what resulted from it, not on his life and of course good things will be shown - its purpose isnt to show a bio. personally i think lennon was human and i hate how people love to act like he is either a saint or rag on him because he wasnt perfect (yes, we all know his relationship with cyn and his sons; that doesnt make him a wholly bad person.)"
