(Photos by Rob Grabowski/Invision/AP, left, and Evan Agostini/Invision/AP)NEW YORK – Paul McCartney is finally ready to write his memoirs, and will use music — and a Pulitzer Prize-winning poet — to help guide him. Irish poet Paul Muldoon is editing and will contribute an introduction. The Rolling Stones' Keith Richards has been equally open about himself, but his 2010 memoir “Life” still sold millions of copies.\n\nThis Nov. 19, 2019 booking photo provided by the California Department of Corrections shows Phil Spector. Spector, the eccentric and revolutionary music producer who transformed rock music with his \"Wall of Sound\" method and who later was convicted of murder, died Saturday, Jan. 16, 2021. But while Spector made his mark as a revolutionary music producer, the stories of him waving guns at recording artists and being convicted of murder overshadowed his artistry. The reaction to Spector’s death resurrected some mixed feelings about his life and legacy. Some lauded his early contributions to rock music, while others struggled to forgive his volatile past.\n\nPhotos, flowers, and candles have been left at Strawberry Fields in New York's Central Park to remember John Lennon, Tuesday, Dec. 8, 2020.

(AP Photo/Mark Lennihan)NEW YORK – Fans remembered John Lennon with flowers, candles and songs Tuesday, the 40th anniversary of the former Beatle's death after being shot outside his New York City apartment building. It was Dec. 8, 1980, when the world-famous musician was with his wife, Yoko Ono, and was shot by Mark David Chapman outside the Dakota apartments on Manhattan’s Upper West Side. After 40 years, Sean, Julian and I still miss him,\" Ono said, referring to Lennon's two sons.\n\nNEW YORK – A New York City man was arrested after he let a friend charged with shooting a Massachusetts state trooper stay at his place in the Bronx and then lied when U.S. marshals arrived, authorities said Monday. The encounter Friday resulted in a gunfight in which the fugitive, Andre K. Sterling, was killed and two deputy U.S. marshals were injured. The judge described the deputy marshals as “two of our own\" because they protect the Manhattan courthouse and its occupants. Marshal Ralph Sozio called the deputy marshals' actions heroic. When the marshals entered, Sterling began shooting at them, leading to his death when the marshals returned fire, the complaint said.\n\nThe two deputy marshals injured in the 5:30 a.m. confrontation at a Bronx apartment were treated at a hospital and were expected to recover. One was hit in the leg and another was struck in his arm and leg, according to federal officials. Andre Sterling, 35, was killed in the shootout and his gun was recovered at the scene. Sterling was wanted for the Nov. 20 shooting of a trooper during a late-night traffic stop in Hyannis, on Cape Cod. Massachusetts U.S. Attorney Andrew Lelling said the deputies were executing a fugitive warrant his office issued for Sterling when they were confronted with gunfire.\n\nFILE - Stevie Nicks performs at the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame induction ceremony in New York on March 29, 2019.

(AP Photo/Petr David Josek)NEW YORK – Like many other events, an annual John Lennon tribute concert that takes place in his adopted city of New York on his Oct. 9 birthday has been forced online because of the coronavirus pandemic. Raiola and other friends began their informal tribute to Lennon in 1981, less than a year after the former Beatle was shot to death.\n\nChapman said he was seeking glory and deserved the death penalty for the despicable act. (New York State Department of Corrections via AP, File)ALBANY, N.Y. – The man who killed John Lennon in 1980 says he was seeking glory and deserved the death penalty for a \"despicable” act. As in previous parole board hearings, the now 65-year-old inmate expressed remorse for gunning down the former Beatle outside the musician's Manhattan apartment building. At the time I deserved the death penalty. When you knowingly plot someone’s murder and know it’s wrong and you do it for yourself, that’s a death penalty right there, in my opinion,” he said.\n\nFILE - In this May 3, 2018 file photo, Toots Hibbert of Toots and the Maytals performs at the New Orleans Jazz and Heritage Festival in New Orleans. Hibbert, frontman of Toots & the Maytals, had been in a medically-induced coma at a hospital in Kingston since earlier this month. Grammy nominations for Hibbert included best reggae album of 2012 for “Reggae Got Soul” and best reggae album of 2007 for “Light Your Light.” Hibbert was ranked No. Married to his wife, Doreen, for nearly 40 years, Hibbert had eight children, including the reggae performers Junior Hibbert and Leba Hibbert. Frederick Nathaniel Hibbert (\"Toots\" was a childhood nickname) was born in May Pen, Parish of Clarendon.\n\nALBANY, N.Y. The man who gunned down John Lennon outside his Manhattan apartment in 1980 was denied parole for an 11th time, state corrections officials said Wednesday. Mark David Chapman was denied after being interviewed by a parole board Aug. 19, according to corrections officials. Chapman shot and killed the former Beatle on the night of Dec. 8, 1980, hours after Lennon autographed an album for him. I was too far in, Chapman told a parole board in 2018. Look at this, he signed it, just go home. But there was no way I was just going to go home.Chapman's next parole hearing is scheduled for August 2022.\n\nKatz, a Pulitzer Prize winning journalist who recently led the AP's coverage of Brexit and the election of Boris Johnson as prime minister, died Monday, June 22, 2020.

With a graying, close-cropped beard and a series of stylish hats, the soft-spoken Katz exuded an air of relaxed sophistication. A lifelong New York Yankees fan, he would stay up late at night to listen to Yankees games on the internet from London. He wont listen, Katz wrote.\n\n(AP Photo/Petr David Josek)The outbreak of the coronavirus has dealt a shock to the global economy with unprecedented speed. That's a 17 percentage point and 9 percentage point improvement over April, respectively. Lands' End said it is cutting about 10% of its corporate staff in the second quarter. Dick's Sporting Goods swung to a loss in the first quarter and sales declined, but the sporting goods retailer is seeing sales improve as stores reopen. While consolidated same-store sales fell 29.5% in the first quarter, they are only down 4% through the first four weeks of the second quarter.\n\nIn New York City, an 11 p.m. curfew was originally put in place this week for what appeared to be the first time in nearly 80 years. On an overall calmer night in New York City, de Blasio said the relative quiet was due partly to the curfew. \" New York City has used curfews in specific locations like parks sometimes with controversial results. New York City on Monday found out an unintended consequence of a curfew is keeping away law-abiding protesters. It also sends a subtle message, said New York City Council member Ydanis Rodriguez.\n\nPastor Bill Minson, a close friend of Little Richard's, told The Associated Press that Little Richard died Saturday morning. “Little Richard? That’s rock ‘n’ roll,” Neil Young, who heard Richard’s riffs on the radio in Canada, told biographer Jimmy McDonough. “I am the architect of rock ‘n’ roll!” Little Richard crowed at the 1988 Grammy Awards as the crowd rose in a standing ovation. In late 1955, Little Richard recorded the bawdy “Tutti Frutti,” with lyrics that were sanitized by a New Orleans songwriter."
