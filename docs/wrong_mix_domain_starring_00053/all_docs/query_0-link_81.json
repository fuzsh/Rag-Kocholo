        "text": "Stephen King and Yoko Ono are weighing in on the ongoing debate about whether civilians should have the right to own assault weapons.\n\nKing, a gun owner himself, published an e-book on Amazon.com called Guns shortly after the Sandy Hook Elementary School shootings,in which he cautioned observers to not blow the debate out of proportion. With Congress now debating the proposed assault weapons ban, King revisited the argument in a recent guest editorial in the Bangor Daily News. \"I'm dead against repeal of the Second Amendment, since I'm a gun owner myself,\" King said. \"[But] a deer hunter who feels it necessary to go into the woods armed with a 30-round AR-15 must either have poor aim or is afraid the deer are going to fight back.\"\n\nTV Scorecard: What's renewed? What's canceled?\n\nWhile some claim the proposed bill aims to take away Americans' guns, King says that's \"simply not true.\" The author advocates for universal background checks and a ban on semi-automatic assault rifles and large capacity magazines. \"All I want is to make it a little more difficult for the Adam Lanzas and James Seevakumarans [who allegedly was planning an attack on the University of Central Florida's campus this week] to kill unarmed civilians and innocent children,\" King writes. \"Why in the name of God should that be controversial?\"\n\nAlso commenting on the issue was Ono, who experienced gun violence firsthand when she witnessed her husband John Lennon's murder in 1980. On Wednesday, which would have been her and Lennon's 34th wedding anniversary, Ono tweeted pictures of the Beatles frontman's bloody glasses, with the captions \"Over 1,057,000 people have been killed by guns in the USA since John Lennon was shot and killed on 8 Dec 1980,\" and \"31,537 people are killed by guns in the USA every year. We are turning this beautiful country into war zone.\"\n\nReturning Spring TV: Where we left off with Game of Thrones and more\n\n\"The death of a loved one is a hollowing experience. After 33 years our son Sean and I still miss him,\" Ono added.\n\nWhere do you stand on the debate over banning assault weapons?\n\nView original Celebs on Gun Control: Yoko Ono Shares Photo of John Lennon's Bloody Glasses at TVGuide.com\n\nOther Links From TVGuide.com"
