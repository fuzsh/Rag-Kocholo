        "text": "So I got to do some serious thinking about this a couple of days ago: what if John had never met Yoko?\n\nAs discontent as he seemed to be with his marriage to Cynthia, would he have gone through with a divorce? It has been noted that he was in a state of emotional turmoil during his trip to India because he was tortured by his love for Yoko and his moral responsibility of having a wife and child. If Yoko–a woman whose level of infatuation could never be matched by another–had never been in the picture, do you think John would have let his moral obligations get the best of him and consequently choose to stay in an unhappy marriage? Or would he have gone through with a divorce and gone through life (for a time) as a single man?\n\nWould his music be different? It is well known that his musical style and direction changed drastically after the band’s break-up, but could this possibly be accredited solely to Yoko? They recorded the avant-garde atrocity Two Virgins in May of 1968 directly before the recording of The Beatles (The White Album ); would the avant-garde experimentation used on “Revolution 9 ” even exist had Yoko never been present in John’s life? Would he have ever gone through Primal Scream Therapy, an experience that heavily inspired the solo album Plastic Ono Band, had the two never met? And what about his last two studio albums, Double Fantasy and Milk And Honey ? Without Yoko’s contributions, what kind of songs—if any—would have been used to fill their spaces? How would the overall mood/message of the albums differ?\n\nAnd what about his styles of protest? Would he have gone through with his famous “Bed-In For Peace” had it not been for Yoko: would he have even given the idea consideration? Better yet, would he have even thought of that bizarre means of protest without his bizarre artist of a wife? And what about Bagism? Would the world have ever been introduced to such an eccentric and abstract approach to interrogation if not for their combined power?\n\nWhat about his personality? Do you attribute his progression in personality to personal maturation, or do you consider it to be directly swayed by Yoko’s ever-steady influence upon him?\n\n*It should be noted that this topic is in no way meant to be associated with Yoko bashing: it was simply created to be a consensus of what we all believe John may have been like in his later years had he never met the love of his life.*\n\nIf John hadn’t met Yoko and things had gone the way they were from 1966 on, he would have probably died a lot sooner. I say that not as a negative thing about John or a positive thing about Yoko. John seemed to be severely depressed in the mid to late 60s. He was in the dumps and out of his mind a lot. Though I’m not much of a Yoko fan, I have to admit that she energized John.\n\nJohn was notorious for needing something to believe in, and he needed someone to focus all his/her attention on him. It’s not so surprising that he brags about Paul choosing him over Paul’s own father. When Paul no longer needed John as much as he had before, I think John saw that as a complete betrayal. He needed someone else to fill that role, and Yoko was more than willing to. They had the clingiest relationship I believe I’ve ever heard about, and it’s no surprise that Yoko needed a break by 1973. May, while nice, wasn’t as strong as Yoko when it came to John. She couldn’t provide the security that John seemed to need. I like May better, but she just wasn’t what John needed.\n\nI differ from you, Sun King , in that I don’t think John and Paul would have ever formed a successful writing partnership again. They may have written together occasionally, but John wouldn’t have had Paul’s full attention. You can hear it in that interview John did when he said something to the effect of Paul having a million kids and a million albums…when would he have had time to talk to him? He was a Jealous Guy , and I don’t think he could have stood seeing Paul manage a fairly successful career, as well as a happy family, while John was not able to, without resenting it sooner or later.\n\nJohn and Cynthia would live separately after John finally being fed up ( although it’s Cynthia who should have felt that way), I don’t see them having a divorce in a long time. John seems to be kind of lazy in that sense; why bother divorcing when you can have a steady, loving little wife and as many lovers as you care for to boost? The drifting apart from Cynthia is caused mainly by his increasing drug use and psychedelic “hobbies”.\n\nGranting Paul will still meet up with Linda, rifts are bound to happen in the band. John is likely to feel insecure without a “companion” ( how many Paul McCartneys and Yoko Onos are there in the world?) and will probably suffer from some sort of depression considering the lack of support and the amount of pressures he has to withhold as a beatle. It is possible, though, that Brian will dot die from sleeping pills overdose if John will have more time in his hands to encourage him ( although his relationship with Yoko wasn’t as intense in the beginning so this theory is left open for much speculation). In any case, should Brian continue managing the Beatles, the group dynamism may hold better than it did. With the possible aid of Brian and lack of Yoko Ono, the Beatles will continue longer to be a “band”, resulting in possible return to live stages, and, unfortunately, less experimental music. George does want to get his compositions in the limelight, though, so White Album may happen- but not as we know it today.\n\nThe Beatles will probably break up sooner or later, perhaps a year later than it actually did. McCartney’s involvement in the happy family life with Linda and kids is likely to be the last straw-for John, at least.\n\nJohn will not die from a gunshot since there is no reason for him to move to New York but his drug addiction might go from bad to worse if there is no one to guide him; Julian might be the one who will waken him from his torpor if his father instincts kick in.\n\nIt’s a certainty that many of John’s greatest songs would never have been written; as a result, he would’ve left the Beatles in ’69 due to a temporary lack of inspiration. I think John might still have gotten involved in the visual art world, although probably not the conceptual bagism/bed-in stuff. He found filmmaking a bore so he wouldn’t have gone that route – at least not as an actor – but I can see him wanting to work in television, he loved it so. (Imagine him appearing on “Sesame Street”!) I’d say his marriage to Cynthia would’ve lasted until, I dunno, 1973 or so. I can’t imagine who his next love interest would’ve been; I’d like to imagine it’d be someone with whom he could collaborate and not just some supermodel. Would he have still discovered heroin? Yes, same as his Dirty Mac bandmates Keith and Eric and too many other musicians in those days. Fortunately, he’d later conquer the addiction (as well as a 1980s flirtation with cocaine.) Despite their historic reunion performance at Live Aid in ’85, The Beatles would never reform, but John and Paul would make occasional appearances on each others albums, as well as co-starring in a memorably funny sketch on the “Kenny Everett Video Show” in 1979. In 2000, John’s “In My Life : A Musical Memoir” would become a #1 bestseller, and eventually the world’s best-selling musical autobiography. Following a 2004 cancer scare, John would finally successfully quit smoking.\n\nThe White Album would be a very different beast, I reckon it would still be a double album, but much of John’s input would be different without the songs about Yoko or heroin. It would probably contain Mean Mr Mustard and Polythene Pam (as they are in the Anthology series), and several other acoustic numbers John wrote in his extended stay in India, as well as Dear Prudence , Sexy Sadie , Glass Onion , Monkey (maybe), Cry Baby Cry , Bungalow Bill, and probably some slight variation on Revolution I. I don’t know if John would have been interested in writing some “dirtier” songs to “replace” Yer Blues and such. Not Guilty would have had John’s full attention and would probably have made the album.\n\nThere are, as I see it, two possibilities- John continues taking LSD heavily, and ends up down the Syd Barrett route, or he moves onto cocaine and then heroin, introduced by Clapton or Richards. I don’t think he’d be able to cope with addiction as “well” as those two did and he’d probably have died in the 70s anyway.\n\nIf he had survived/stayed sober for long enough to have a solo career, then it would probably be unrecognisable. Remove songs about peace and Yoko, or songs written with Yoko, and very little remains.\n\nThe Walrus said\n\nThere are, as I see it, two possibilities- John continues taking LSD heavily, and ends up down the Syd Barrett route, or he moves onto cocaine and then heroin, introduced by Clapton or Richards.

Remove songs about peace and Yoko, or songs written with Yoko, and very little remains.\n\nI agree with this. John’s dependent and addictive tendencies would certainly have gotten the better of him had Yoko not coaxed him out of the psychedelic phase and into the peace craze, and I feel he wouldn’t have had the strength to leave Cynthia and would have remained in the unhappy marriage, doing nothing but sitting about eating acid every day. Hopefully the trip to India and time with the Maharishi would help, but I feel that the disillusionment with the Maharishi’s ethic after they left Rishikesh would plunge him straight back into that destructive lifestyle of constant tripping and his work with the Beatles would consequently have diminished.\n\nfabfouremily said\n\nHow can you back that up? Why was it Yoko’s fault that he died? He was killed by a mentally disturbed man, that’s nobody fault.\n\nWell, fabfouremily, I think we need to accept from the outset that the question is a hypothetical, so any answer is speculation. In the same way if a person said John would still have died – that would be speculation – because no one knows for sure what would have happened if John had never met Yoko. That’s the point of the question – that we speculate.\n\nMy answer is based on that it is reasonable to assume that they had never met, the trajectory of John’s life would have been so drastically altered that it would have significantly reduced the likelihood that John and his killer would ever crossed paths on that fateful day.\n\nI believe that to be a reasonable assumption, thus if he was still alive, Julian who lost his father (remember if John had not met Yoko there would be no Sean) Julian would still have his dad. Just my 2 cent answer to the question.\n\nrobert said\n\nJohn would still be alive and if I were Julian that would be enough.\n\nI am very confused as to what you mean by “…and if I were Julian, that would be enough”. Can you please explain what exactly it is that you’re trying to say?\n\nAnd as for the whole theory of John not dying the way he did if he had never met Yoko, I’m not so sure about that likelihood…Because Chapman lived in Hawaii, he had to purchase a plane ticket to New York in order to carry out the assassination. Therefore, I think there’s a high probability that he would have attempted to kill John no matter where he lived. Because he had to travel to get to John, Mark David Chapman–if he was dead set on going through with the murder (which, based on the fact that he had traveled to NYC in October of that same year with the intention of carrying out his bloody scheme, he was)–would have been liable to buy a plane ticket to any place John was. Consequently, I believe John might have died at Chapman’s expense no matter where life led him."
