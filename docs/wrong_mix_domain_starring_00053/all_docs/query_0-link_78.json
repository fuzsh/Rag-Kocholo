        "text": "Grammy night’s most nominated artist this year has arrived: SZA brought “Snooze” and “Kill Bill” to the 2024 awards ceremony.\n\nPerforming at the Crypto.com Arena in Los Angeles, the artist appeared onstage in a black hat and matching leather trench coat, backed by dumpsters full of fire and vintage trash cans. She slashed a dude looming behind her as “Snooze” wrapped, the perfect signal for “Kill Bill.”\n\nAs the cover star of Rolling Stone’s Grammy Preview issue in October, SZA said she was preparing for this very moment. She considered performing at the Grammys among “things that I would normally say ‘Fuck no’ to because I’m terrified,” she said at the time, but “I’m thinking that I’m going to say yes to because it might change my life.”\n\nTrending\n\n“You perform at the Grammys, you do excellent, you’re bigger,” she went on. “You perform at the Grammys, you win Grammys, you’re extra big… all of those things, what they mean together, is terrifying.”"
