        "text": "For the accompanying visuals to her chart-topping smash single “Fancy”, Iggy Azalea re-imagined ’90s teen popcorn flick Clueless, with help from Charli XCX. Now, she returns with a video for “Black Widow”, and this time she’s paying homage to Quentin Tarantino and his bloody action thriller Kill Bill. Not only that, but she’s recruited actor Michael Madsen, who starred in Kill Bill Vol. 1, to play the villain in her video.\n\nAs you’ll see, Iggy takes on the role of Uma Thurman’s character, disguising herself as a waitress as she plots revenge against Madsen’s “Hollywood royalty” character. The compelling video also features appearances from T.I. and Paul Sorvino (Goodfellas, Nixon, Romeo & Juliet). Watch all the action below.\n\nRelated Video\n\n“Black Widow” is the latest single off Iggy’s debut LP, The New Classic. She’ll perform the song live at the 2014 MTV Video Music Awards on August 24th."
