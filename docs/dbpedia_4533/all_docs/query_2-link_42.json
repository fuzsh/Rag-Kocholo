        "text": "Celebrities say 'Come on England!' ahead of final\n\nEd Sheeran, Little Simz, Kate Beckinsale and Sir Patrick Stewart are among dozens of celebrities and sports stars who have sent personal messages of support to England ahead of the team's Euro 2024 final later.\n\nThe messages will feature in a montage during a pre-match special on BBC One and BBC iPlayer, hosted by Gary Lineker.\n\nAmong them are contributions from Ricky Tomlinson, who played football manager Mike Bassett, Al Murray as the Pub Landlord, and Craig David singing \"we got the Euros in our hands\".\n\n'More emotional than wedding'\n\nRomesh Ranganathan said while watching Bukayo Saka equalise against Switzerland he \"felt more emotional than I did on my wedding day, when I watched the first ten minutes of UP [and] when I listen to Stevie Wonder songs\".\n\n\"One more game, one more push,\" said Goodness Gracious Me actor Sanjeev Bhaskar.\n\n\"Come on you Three Lions. In fact, come on you 11 Lions. Actually plus substitutes... 16 Lions... Come on you pride of lions, come on England!\"\n\n\"Can we get an earlier goal please? All these late goals - they make my hair fall out!\" Little Britain's famously bald Matt Lucas joked.\n\nComedian and lyricist of the football anthem Three Lions David Baddiel called England midfielder Cole Palmer a \"genius\".\n\n'Come on, England!'\n\nEd Sheeran, spotted in the stands at the semi-final, said \"everything is coming together at the right point\".\n\nSinger Ellie Goulding wished the boys \"all the luck in the world\" while Sam Smith sent the team love and kisses.\n\nPop star Kylie said \"it's coming home\" in a BBC Radio 2 interview.\n\nRapper Little Simz said \"we're nearly there\" and that \"the whole country's got your back\".\n\nSinger-songwriter Mabel also donned an England jersey, saying she's watched \"every minute on the edge of my seat\".\n\nCraig David sang \"we got the Euros in our hands\" to the team from his recording studio with a pet goldfish swimming beside him. \"What a time to be alive,\" he shared before breaking into song again.\n\nUK garage music DJ Spoony said Gareth Southgate's team had \"put a smile back on the face of English football\".\n\nIndie band Blossoms lead singer Tom Ogden said \"what you've achieved so far has been amazing\" and that watching Ollie Watkins's 90th minute goal together with his family was one of his \"favourite ever football memories\".\n\nSpice Girl Melanie C told the team they had \"the whole country united\".\n\nWolverine predicts England triumph\n\nHollywood stars weighed in. At the Deadpool & Wolverine premiere in London this week, Hugh Jackman predicted: \"This place is going to go ballistic on Sunday. England is going to win 3-1.\"\n\nHe and Ryan Reynolds think Wolverine rather than Deadpool would be a more likely potential addition for the England squad.\n\nActress Kate Beckinsale recited a reimagined Lord's Prayer, saying \"give this day our jammy win and forgive us for criticising your tactics\".\n\nSir Patrick Stewart celebrated England's young players, calling them \"extraordinary\"."
