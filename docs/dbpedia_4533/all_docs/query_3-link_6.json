        "text": "In the whole field of TV and movie portrayals of Holmes and Watson few actors have come in for more criticism that Nigel Bruce for his portrayal of Watson in 14 movies with his good friend Basil Rathbone. How often have you seen Bruce mentioned in print without the word ‘bumbling’ being present? In my opinion though whatever was lacking in accuracy was made up for in sheer likeability. Many of us grew up with Rathbone and Bruce and for all the faults of the movies (and there were many) it’s worth remembering how popular they were and how lasting their influence. Rathbone is still considered, and rightly so, one of the finest Holmes (some believe the finest) and their Hound Of The Baskervilles is probably the best version ever made. Then they appeared in around 200 radio performances which were all well worth listening to. Even when Rathbone decided to hang up the deerstalker Bruce continued as Watson with Rathbone soundalike Tom Conway as the detective.\n\nWillian Nigel Ernie Bruce (always known as Willie to his friends) was born in Mexico in 1895. Despite appearances Bruce was 3 years younger than Rathbone. He usually played characters that were non-too-bright but kind, decent and honourable. He appeared in the first fully technicolour movie Becky Sharp in 1935 and the first 3D film Bwana Devil in 1952. Bruce was liked by all and was a leading figure in the Hollywood British emigre community. Cricket was a great love of his (like Rathbone.)\n\nHe bought warmth and humour to the role which producers wanted to offset the cold rationality of Rathbone’s Holmes. Of course there were far better Watson’s in terms of accuracy of performance (Burke, Hardwick, Stock, Morrel to name but 4) but none were more likeable. And for that I think he deserves a little more credit than he tends to receive.\n\nBruce died of a heart attack in Santa Monica in 1953 at the age of 58."
