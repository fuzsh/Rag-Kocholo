Don't miss your chance to catch him live as he heads to a venue near you!\n\nEmmy-Award winner Hannah Gadsby is a name you should probably know, or if you don't you will soon enough!

A sold-out Edinburgh Fringe run and multiple Netflix specials later, Hannah Gadsby returns to the road for a North American tour following her fourth special with Netflix from 2024, the Gender Agenda, which united gender queer comedians from around the world.\n\nSarah Silverman embarks on her brand new US tour, 'Sarah Silverman: Postmortem'. She may have become known for her no-holds-barred exploration of taboo subjects, but an incisive and brave performer lives underneath all that controversy. She rose through the stand-up ranks in the 00s, and created her own eponymous Comedy Central show, The Sarah Silverman Program. Be warned though - no subject is taboo for this leading comedian!\n\nRising comedian Taylor Tomlinson is hitting the road once again this year!

The \"perfect balance of sophisticated writing and physicality\" (Wall Street Journal), Brian fills theaters nationwide with fervent fans that span generations. His clean language and sharp, sarcastic observations on everyday life have led him to be known as the \"comedian's comedian\".\n\nCan we say YouTube Legends? Uk duo Dan and Phil amassed over 17.6 million subscribers since opening their channel in 2009, are leaving their computers behind and returning to stages across the country on 'The Terrible Influence' tour. Following on from 2 very successful previous tours, Dan and Phil return to rant, roast, battle each other, and give their fans a sneak peek into their lives with their funny anecdotes."
