        "text": "This may be hard to believe, but the first Bring It On movie came out over 20 years ago, and boy, does that make us feel old! Yep, in 2000 fans everywhere were first introduced to the film series and since then, five additional cheerleading flicks have been released.\n\nOver the years, some pretty major stars got their acting start in the seriously iconic movies. That’s right, Kirsten Dunst, Gabrielle Union, Hayden Panettiere, Francia Raisa, Ashley Benson, Cassie Scerbo and Christina Milian have all flipped and danced into our hearts during one of the Bring It On films, and now, there’s talks of bringing back the original cast for a possible reboot in the near future.\n\nDuring an August 200 interview with Insider, the OG movie’s director Peyton Reed said he’s “definitely been talking about” another film that includes the original cast. “I think there’s a great version to be done,” he explained, noting that the cheerleader movie has become a cultural phenomenon. “It means different things to different people.”\n\nPeyton continued, “It may sound weird now, but 20 years ago I wanted this movie to feel like things are advancing.”\n\nIn a YouTube livestream that same month with Kirsten and Gabrielle to celebrate the 20th anniversary, Peyton and the actresses shared their own ideas for a possible reboot or sequel. “Whatever that we may, one day, come up with, I don’t know. Kirsten maybe we’re, like, coheads of the PTA,” Gabrielle joked. Kirsten added, “Or we run a cheer school like [Netflix’s] Cheer. Who knows? It has to be a competition against somebody.”\n\nThen, Gabrielle appeared on The Late Late Show With James Corden in September 2020, and said another movie is “absolutely” happening. “We have [talked about it]. We actually did a public panel a couple of weeks ago and they asked about it, and we all were like, ‘We’re in. We’re absolutely in.’”\n\nThe actress added, “We kind of want to see where these people would be 20 years later.”\n\nBefore a new movie comes out, we need to know what all the former on-screen cheerleaders are up to now, right?! The stars of all the Bring It On movies are still getting a chance to show off their spirit fingers in Hollywood! Between their recent roles and personal lives, click through our gallery for a full breakdown of what all the cheerleaders from the Bring It On movies are up to now."
