        "text": "***/**** Image A Sound B- Extras C\n\nstarring Walter Brennan, Walter Huston, Anne Baxter, Dana Andrews\n\nscreenplay by Dudley Nichols, based on the novel by Vereen Bell\n\ndirected by Jean Renoir\n\nby Walter Chaw Jean Renoir’s Swamp Water stands out as an example of how an artist’s genius can assert itself even when his product has been taken away from him, re-edited and in some places reshot. Renoir’s insistence on actually shooting on location in Georgia’s Okefenokee, declared a Federal Wildlife Refuge by FDR in 1937, resulted in a grassroots movement lobbying Darryl Zanuck to hold the premiere locally. It was an artistic choice Godard would later say “revolutionized Hollywood.” I’m not sure what Okefenokee residents must have thought of the picture, one that is equal parts offensive cornpone melodrama and haunted, gravid Romanticism. There’s an indelible, hard-to-quantify melancholy to the film that’s at odds with its boilerplate narrative; it feels like a Joseph Conrad, even if it reads like a Vereen Bell. It’s an interesting case study, too, because it might never have happened were Renoir’s masterpiece The Rules of the Game not savaged by critics and audiences in his native France, where it would go on to be radically recut, twice-banned, and destroyed in a bombing raid. I like this story, because I think Americans get a bad rap for not recognizing the fruit of their creativity. I like it even more because the French get a lot of credit for being the ones who do.\n\n*/**** Image B Sound C+ Extras B\n\nstarring Ingrid Bergman, Gregory Peck, Michael Chekhov, Leo G. Carroll\n\nscreenplay by Ben Hecht, suggested by Francis Beeding’s novel The House of Dr. Edwardes\n\ndirected by Alfred Hitchcock\n\nby Walter Chaw It’s tempting to give Hitchcock’s Spellbound a pass because there’s a good chance the whole thing was intended as either a childish, depressive prankster’s most expensive prank or a passive-aggressive jab at Selznick (or, more than likely, both). Tempting, because like all of Hitchcock’s films, its qualities are directly relatable to Hitch’s own inconquerable peccadilloes. In a movie that’s essentially about an individual’s ability, or lack thereof, to banish his or her personal demons, Spellbound gets a little credit just for being so damned ironic for the fact of it. It’s successful, in other words, if its intention was to be a disaster–a grenade offered up to a hated creative rival (Hitch would pretend the camera was broken whenever Selznick visited the set, only to have it spring back to life upon his departure) as a gambit to not only get closer to getting out of his seven-year contract with Selznick, but also provide celluloid testimony to the fact that, contract or not, he’s nobody’s bitch. It makes sense, too, to recruit Ben Hecht–he of Lifeboat and later Notorious, it’s true, but of His Girl Friday and The Shop Around the Corner as well–to write a script packed to the gills with bad screwball and Catskills Freud bits, the better to put David O.’s much-ballyhooed therapy out there formulated to the motion picture frame. This is Hitchcock ridiculing his boss on the most conspicuous stage one could imagine and, here’s the punchline, using that same boss’s money to do so. Let’s feel safe in surmising that when Hitch told Selznick he had the perfect idea for a movie about Selznick’s new psychotherapy jones (brought on in part by his affair with Jennifer Jones, no doubt), he wasn’t suddenly, spontaneously displaying compassion and the desire to collaborate with Selznick.\n\nby Bill Chambers It's been fun to skylark about a Blu-ray release of vintage Looney Tunes since the format's inception, but until Warner announced this \"Platinum Collection\" box set, I don't think anybody truly expected it to happen. And while the DVD transfers that graced the \"Golden Collection\"s were more than adequate, the truth is that a taste of Bugs, Daffy, et al in standard-def–via recycled \"Behind the Tunes\" featurettes–after seeing them in all their HiDef splendour is a lot like Dorothy's unintentionally depressing return to Kansas at the end of The Wizard of Oz. Presented pillarboxed in their original 1.37:1 aspect ratio, these shorts pop like never before but have not, unlike Disney's animated features, undergone a digital repainting–though I remain skeptical of a radioactive shade of green that crops up in Daffy's Robin Hood outfit and on the bars of Tweety's cage in Tweetie Pie (to cite two examples), because it looked so revisionist when applied to the title character of \"How the Grinch Stole Christmas\" on Warner's Blu-ray version of same. Nevertheless, the restorers use a gentle touch, dustbusting and correcting damage to the prints while leaving grit trapped between the cels alone. The dark Scaredy Cat is dotted with so much white you might think the background plate doubled as a coke tray.\n\n****/**** Image B+ Sound B+ Extras C+\n\nstarring Laurence Olivier, Joan Fontaine, George Sanders, Judith Anderson\n\nscreenplay by Robert E.

Schooled in German Expressionism, Curtiz, by the time of Casablanca, had lost much of anything like a distinctive visual style, and on this film, a troubled production from the start, there's a lack of imagination to the direction that contributes, at least in part, to the way that Casablanca just sort of sits there for long stretches. For all of its magnificent performances (Claude Rains, best here or in Alfred Hitchcock's Notorious; Peter Lorre, a personal favourite; and let's not forget Sydney Greenstreet), Casablanca is curiously sterile: its politics are topical, but its love story is passionate by dint of history rather than proximate ardour. Ingrid Bergman arguably gave off more heat in Victor Fleming's Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde and inarguably did so in Gregory Ratoff's Intermezzo. Casablanca is legendary, and that forgives a lot of its blemishes.\n\n***½/**** Image A Sound A Extras B-\n\n\"Puss Gets the Boot,\" \"The Midnight Snack,\" \"The Night Before Christmas,\" \"Fraidy Cat,\" \"Dog Trouble,\" \"Puss N' Toots,\" \"The Bowling Alley-Cat,\" Fine Feathered Friend,\" \"Sufferin' Cats,\" \"The Lonesome Mouse,\" \"The Yankee Doodle Mouse,\" \"Baby Puss,\" \"The Zoot Cat,\" \"The Million Dollar Cat,\" \"The Bodyguard,\" \"Puttin' On The Dog,\" \"Mouse Trouble,\" \"The Mouse Comes To Dinner,\" \"Flirty Birdy,\" \"Quiet Please!,\" \"Springtime For Thomas,\" \"The Milky Waif,\" \"Trap Happy,\" \"Solid Serenade,\" \"Cat Fishin',\" \"Part Time Pal,\" \"The Cat Concerto,\" \"Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Mouse,\" \"Salt Water Tabby,\" \"A Mouse in the House,\" \"The Invisible Mouse,\" \"Kitty Foiled,\" \"The Truce Hurts,\" \"Old Rockin' Chair Tom,\" \"Professor Tom\"\n\nby Jefferson Robbins They're phenomenally enjoyable, but the conflict in Warner's Roadrunner cartoons comes down to a lively protagonist pitting himself against something that's not a character, nor even a \"force of nature.\" Nature, in fact, is suspended; Wile E. Coyote is struggling with a quantum impossibility. When he sets out after his prey, he finds laws of matter, energy, and motion suspended and reversed. (At times, the Roadrunner appears to move at lightspeed or beyond.) The Coyote applies Acme™ science to the chase, but discovers science doesn't apply. The Roadrunner has no obvious inner life or larger goals, and seems to exist just to frustrate his pursuer. The Universe simply does not want the Coyote to catch this blankly-smiling creature with a void howling behind its eyes, and so he never will.\n\n***/**** Image A- Sound B+ Extras A-\n\nstory direction Perce Pearce and story adaptation Larry Morey, from the story by Felix Salten\n\nsupervising director David D. Hand\n\nby Bryant Frazer Bambi is just 70 minutes long, but it's one of the more versatile features in the Disney canon. It's a cute circle-of-life story, sure, populated by talking rabbits, nominally sweet-smelling skunks, and wise old owls (not to mention the adorable chipmunks that the owl, for some reason, hasn't preyed upon). But look what else is going on in this slice-of-wildlife film: an attempt at an animated nature documentary; a tract in opposition to sport hunting; and the impetus for generations of children to weep in terror at the prospect of losing their mothers.\n\nFANTASIA\n\n***/**** Image A Sound A- Extras B+\n\nstory direction by Joe Grant and Dick Huemer\n\ndirected by James Algar, Samuel Armstrong, Ford Beebe, Norm Ferguson, Jim Handley, Thornton Hee, Wilfred Jackson, Hamilton Luske, Bill Roberts, and Paul Satterfield\n\nFANTASIA 2000\n\n*½/**** Image A Sound A Extras B+\n\ndirected by Pixote Hunt, Hendel Butoy, Eric Goldberg, James Algar, Francis Glebas, Gaetan Brizzi, Paul Brizzi, and Don Hahn\n\nby Bryant Frazer More than twenty years ago, I sat in Stan Brakhage’s office at the University of Colorado, handling original frames of 65mm IMAX film stock that the avant-garde filmmaker had hand-painted with swirling layers of colour. He explained that IMAX had commissioned him to create an abstract film specifically for presentation on the huge screens of their theatres. It was a great idea, and I wondered when the film had screened. Never, Brakhage told me. The IMAX people eventually lost interest in the idea, and “Night Music” was shown instead in 16mm prints, drastically reduced from the large-gauge film stock. Although IMAX were bold enough to approach Brakhage in the first place, the company got cold feet when it came time to actually exhibit non-narrative cinema–even for only 30 seconds!–for a paying audience.\n\n****/****\n\nDVD – Image A Sound B+ Extras A+\n\nBD – Image A- Sound A- Extras A\n\nstarring Humphrey Bogart, Walter Huston, Tim Holt, Bruce Bennett\n\nscreenplay by John Huston, based on the novel by B. Traven\n\ndirected by John Huston\n\nby Walter Chaw John Ford isn’t America’s Akira Kurosawa, John Huston is, and The Treasure of the Sierra Madre, an intimate epic that unfolds against the backdrop of the Mexican Revolution, is Huston’s Throne of Blood. Huston also draws comparisons to Ernest Hemingway, not just for being a man’s man in life, but for his precision and economy in art. There isn’t any flab on The Treasure of the Sierra Madre–it’s as sleek as a dancer in its waltz between complex character drama on the one side and broad social commentary on the other. There haven’t been many better American films (it’s Huston’s best film next to Fat City and maybe The Misfits, and it boasts of Humphrey Bogart’s best performance without question), and when it’s spoken of, it’s spoken of in terms of one of those films that decided careers in the cinema for generations of filmmakers.\n\nROMAN HOLIDAY (1953)\n\n[CENTENNIAL COLLECTION]\n\n***½/**** Image B- Sound B Extras C\n\nstarring Gregory Peck, Audrey Hepburn, Eddie Albert, Hartley Power\n\nscreenplay by Ian McLellan Hunter and John Dighton\n\ndirected by William Wyler\n\nSABRINA (1954)\n\n[CENTENNIAL COLLECTION]\n\n**½/**** Image B Sound B Extras C\n\nstarring Humphrey Bogart, Audrey Hepburn, William Holden, Walter Hampden\n\nscreenplay by Billy Wilder, Samuel Taylor and Ernest Lehman, based on Taylor’s play\n\ndirected by Billy Wilder\n\nLOVE IN THE AFTERNOON (1957)\n\n[TCM GREATEST CLASSIC FILMS COLLECTION: ROMANCE]\n\n½*/**** Image C Sound B\n\nstarring Gary Cooper, Audrey Hepburn, Maurice Chevalier, John McGiver\n\nscreenplay by Billy Wilder and I.A.L.

It’s one of those seminal moments that movies provide the culture with now and again, like the swoop up a little rise to an impossibly fresh John Wayne in Stagecoach, or the intervention of a fortuitous steam vent in The Seven Year Itch, this introduction we have to Audrey Hepburn as she’s whirled around in a barber chair in William Wyler’s Roman Holiday to reveal the pixie-cut heard ’round the world. That she’s adorable is a given–the real issue is whether she’s an actress or just a bundle of inexplicable charisma, a ganglion of celluloid starlight that evaporates under the slightest critical scrutiny. I love Roman Holiday, but I vacillate between indifference and actual dislike of the rest of Hepburn’s films. I don’t find her winsome in Breakfast at Tiffany’s, am irritated by her in Charade, think she’s appallingly twee in Love in the Afternoon. She doesn’t hold her own against Sean Connery in Robin and Marian and gets blown off the screen by Albert Finney, Alan Arkin, and Rex Harrison in Two for the Road, Wait Until Dark, and My Fair Lady, respectively. If you ask me, Audrey isn’t an actress so much as someone you would like to have known and maybe had the opportunity to cuddle, which makes her mega-stardom in the Fifties and Sixties all the more testament to her ineffable appeal. Happening right when Method was rendering personalities like Hepburn déclassé, she was making a career of being terminally anachronistic. It’s Ozzie’s Harriet, sashaying while Rome burns. Instant nostalgia; even when she was introduced for the first time, it must have seemed like ages ago.\n\nSherlock Holmes and the Voice of Terror (1942)\n\n***½/**** Image A- Sound A-\n\nstarring Basil Rathbone, Nigel Bruce, Evelyn Ankers, Reginald Denny\n\nscreenplay by Lynn Riggs & John Bright, based upon the story \"His Last Bow\" by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle\n\ndirected by John Rawlins\n\nTHE SPIDER WOMAN (1944)\n\n**/**** Image B- Sound B-\n\nstarring Basil Rathbone, Nigel Bruce, Gale Sondergaard, Dennis Hoey\n\nscreenplay by Bertram Millhauser, based on a story by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle\n\ndirected by Roy William Neill\n\nby Ian Pugh My introduction to Basil Rathbone's Sherlock Holmes came courtesy of MPI's recent double-feature DVD, and as introductions go, one could certainly do worse. Plucking the detective from Fox's Victorian backdrop and throwing him unceremoniously into World War II, Universal's take on the Holmes series comes across as hell-bent on forging its own continuity and, moreover, its own sense of context. The first entry in this new cycle, Sherlock Holmes and the Voice of Terror, begins with a title card explaining why the film makes such a dramatic departure from the previous two:\n\nALONG CAME JONES (1945) **½/**** Image B+ Sound C+\n\nstarring Gary Cooper, Loretta Young, William Demarest, Dan Duryea\n\nscreenplay by Nunnally Johnson\n\ndirected by Stuart Heisler\n\nMAN OF THE WEST (1958) ****/**** Image A- Sound B-\n\nstarring Gary Cooper, Julie London, Lee J.

The way he carried Hollywood on his shoulders from the silents through the talkies to the threshold of the New Wave, you'd expect him to be broader. Instead, he was the definition of lanky. Where his centre of gravity lay was in his Rushmore of a face: in close-up, he's an impossible granite monument, like that ever-unfinished Crazy Horse memorial in South Dakota; in full shot, in his prime years, he's a broomstick supporting a boulder.\n\n***/**** Image F (colorized)/B+ (b&w) Sound B Extras C\n\nstarring Maureen O'Hara, John Payne, Edmund Gwenn, Gene Lockhart\n\nscreenplay by George Seaton, based on the story by Valentine Davies\n\ndirected by George Seaton\n\nby Alex Jackson George Seaton's Miracle on 34th Street isn't my Christmas movie of choice. My most potent movie memory of Christmas is actually watching the Star Wars trilogy when it was broadcast on the USA network however many years ago. Accordingly, I make it a point of marking the holiday by watching some kind of Star Wars-like \"deep reality\" science-fiction or fantasy film, such as The Lord of the Rings, or Blade Runner. A couple years back, I watched The Passion of the Christ. But I digress. Of all the major Christmas movie cults–including those surrounding A Christmas Story, It's a Wonderful Life, Elf, and 1951's A Christmas Carol–the Miracle on 34th Street cult is the one with which I'd most want to spend the holidays. The film manages to be irreverent without becoming sacrilegious and sentimental without becoming saccharine. It's a pretty silly film, but I guess you could say that it's serious about being silly. It values silliness for its restorative, therapeutic quality.\n\nCAT PEOPLE (1943)\n\n****/**** Image B Sound C+\n\nstarring Simone Simon, Kent Smith, Tom Conway, Jane Randolph\n\nscreenplay by DeWitt Bodeen\n\ndirected by Jacques Tourneur\n\nTHE CURSE OF THE CAT PEOPLE (1944)\n\n****/**** Image B+ Sound B\n\nstarring Simone Simon, Kent Smith, Tom Conway, Jane Randolph, Ann Carter\n\nscreenplay by DeWitt Bodeen\n\ndirected by Gunther V.

It’s not too much to speak of Val Lewton as the American Jean Cocteau. An enigmatic figure with his hand, like Cocteau, in more than one media (a novelist, he often did uncredited work on the screenplays for his films), the movies produced under his RKO watch are a repository of dream sleep, enough so that an overview of his key pictures–something made possible by Warner’s rapturous DVD collection of his horror fare–uncovers a treasure trove of indelible nightmare images. Where Cocteau affected a studiedly casual mien and came to film in his sixties, however, Lewton (who died at 47) seems the product of financial expediency and, perhaps more impressively, stamped the products of his hand despite roadblocks placed in his way. Yet the similarities are striking: Above and beyond the dreamscapes affected, there’s a common fascination with masks and false identities; an obsession with budding sexuality turned subtly aberrant; and a cycle of seduction tied to corruption in the move from innocence to experience. I see in these recurrent themes a man fascinated by the blinds that men throw before them to deny the unknowable tides governing their emotions and actions. It’s that illusion of civilization that informs Lewton’s pictures; the horror of them is in the ripping away to expose the insect underneath.\n\nCHANDU THE MAGICIAN (1932)\n\n***½/**** Image B- Sound C Extras A-\n\nstarring Edmund Lowe, Bela Lugosi, Irene Ware, Henry B.

I confess to feeling a little insecure while reading the entry for Chandu the Magician in Leonard Maltin’s Movie & Video Guide, wherein the learned film historian derides Chandu as “disappointing” and “not as good as most serials in this genre, and even sillier.” The suggestion is that he’s wholly sympathetic to the material and was actually hoping to see a good movie before being “disappointed.” Mr. Maltin may very well be in a better position than me to determine the relative merits of Chandu the Magician. Speaking as a layman, I found it to be sublime pulp fiction. Prototypical of George Lucas’s Indiana Jones and Star Wars franchises, the film is remarkably shameless in its goofiness, never veering into self-deprecation or camp. It’s one of those rare pop entertainments that genuinely make you feel like a kid again.\n\nON THE TOWN (1949)\n\n**/**** Image C Sound B-\n\nstarring Gene Kelly, Frank Sinatra, Betty Garrett, Ann Miller\n\nscreenplay by Adolph Green and Betty Comden, based on the play\n\ndirected by Gene Kelly and Stanley Donen\n\nTAKE ME OUT TO THE BALL GAME (1949)\n\n**/**** Image B+ Sound A- Extras C\n\nstarring Frank Sinatra, Esther Williams, Gene Kelly, Betty Garrett\n\nscreenplay by Harry Tugeno and George Wells\n\ndirected by Busby Berkeley\n\nANCHORS AWEIGH (1945)\n\n**/**** Image C+ Sound B- Extras D\n\nstarring Frank Sinatra, Kathryn Grayson, Gene Kelly, Dean Stockwell\n\nscreenplay by Isobel Lennart\n\ndirected by George Sidney\n\nby Alex Jackson One of the cinema's most startling moments in recent years was a close-up of Paul Dano early on in There Will Be Blood. Dano was never meant to get that friendly with the camera. I'm not sure I can properly convey this notion, but his close-up created a dissonant effect. It felt as though director Paul Thomas Anderson had broken some unstated rule of filmmaking. I think the reason it's so jarring is that the Close-Up wasn't designed for actors like Paul Dano. It was designed for somebody like his co-star, Daniel Day-Lewis. To put it as delicately as possible, Dano wasn't blessed with a \"movie star\" face. He's a bit strange-looking. In contrast, Daniel Day-Lewis is traditionally handsome and truly \"belongs\" on the silver screen. In and of himself, he's as cinematic as anything you're ever going to find in the movies.\n\nMAURICE MAETERLINCK’S THE BLUE BIRD (1940)\n\n**½/**** Image C Sound B-\n\nstarring Shirley Temple, Spring Byington, Nigel Bruce, Gale Sondergaard\n\nscreenplay by Ernest Pascal\n\ndirected by Walter Lang\n\nTHE LITTLE PRINCESS (1939)\n\n**½/**** Image B Sound B\n\nstarring Shirley Temple, Richard Greene, Anita Louise, Ian Hunter\n\nscreenplay by Ethel Hill and Walter Ferris, based on the novel by Frances Hodgson Burnett\n\ndirected by Walter Lang\n\nSTAND UP AND CHEER!

In an attempt to beat MGM at their own game, Fox bought the rights to playwright Maurice Maeterlinck’s “L’Oiseau Bleu” (“The Blue Bird”) with an eye on Temple for the lead. Ironically, The Blue Bird became her very first box-office dud and signalled the end of her career as a child actress.\n\nMR. SKEFFINGTON\n\n½*/**** Image B Sound B Extras B\n\nstarring Bette Davis, Claude Rains, Walter Abel, Richard Waring\n\nscreenplay by Julius J. Epstein & Philip G. Epstein\n\ndirected by Vincent Sherman\n\nTHE STAR\n\n*/**** Image B Sound B Extras D\n\nstarring Bette Davis, Sterling Hayden, Natalie Wood, Warner Anderson\n\nscreenplay by Katherine Albert and Dale Eunson\n\ndirected by Stuart Heisler\n\nby Walter Chaw Biographers and geeks would be right to point out that Bette Davis spent her late career–on screen and, abortively, on stage–getting in her own way, while cynics and realists would be right to point out that the one most probably led to the other, if we're to take \"the other\" as autobiographical. Even people resistant to the auteur theory tend to recognize that matinee idols shoulder at least a fair share of the blame for picking vanity pieces and assorted flaming trainwrecks from the piles of projects offered them. If there's a fair modern, distaff analogue to Bette Davis's embarrassing epilogue in self-abnegating camp artifacts, it's Burt Reynolds's own squandering of his status as the biggest thing on planet Hollywood for a series of vainglorious redneck \"gorsh!\" spectacles that tied him eternally with Dom DeLuise and, oh my, Hal Needham. Consider that both have earned a small, rabid band of indefatigable defenders of their late, self-inflicted careers (gay men for Bette, assholes for Burt) for nothing more than confirming their respective lifestyles of bitchy flamboyance on the one side and dimwitted macho rebellion on the other. They're cults of personality by the very definition of \"cultism,\" founded on the shale of limited appeal and the arrested desire to emulate someone you admire. (See also: the army of SAHMs shuffling after Oprah.) I guess you could say that although I get it, I'm not down with the cult of Bette.\n\nTHE BRIDE AND THE BEAST\n\n***/**** Image B+ Sound B\n\nstarring Charlotte Austin, Lance Fuller, Johnny Roth, William Justine\n\nscreenplay by Edward D. Wood, Jr.\n\ndirected by Adrian Weiss\n\nTHE WHITE GORILLA\n\n***/**** Image C+ Sound B+\n\nstarring Ray Corrigan, Lorraine Miller, George J. Lewis, Francis Ford\n\nscreenplay by Jo Pagano\n\nwritten and directed by Harry Fraser\n\nby Alex Jackson It would be easy to dismiss The Bride and the Beast and The White Gorilla, sight unseen, as dated trash encapsulating the lamentable racist attitudes of the era in which they were produced. Both films belong to a sub-genre of pulp fiction in which great white hunters penetrate the jungles of darkest Africa and quickly conquer the continent's great beasts, much to the awe of the childlike natives. Told directly and on the level, it's possible for this material to have a raw, primal power–this is the stuff of myth, right? The hero slaying the dragon and bringing peace to the land. I don't find the \"White Man's Burden\" position nearly as offensive as I find films like Jungle Goddess, where the white saviour passively conquers an African civilization and then just as passively leaves it behind. Certainly, you should be able to have a romantic fiction without marginalizing an entire race of people."
