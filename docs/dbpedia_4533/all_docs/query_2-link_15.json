        "text": "01 of 10\n\nKirsten Dunst (Torrance Shipman)\n\nKirsten Dunst played the perky Torrance Shipman, captain of the Rancho Carne Toros cheerleading team. After learning that the team's previous routines were all stolen, Torrance tries to reinvent the squad and win a sixth national cheerleading title.\n\nAfter the success of Bring It On, Dunst scored the blockbuster role of Mary Jane Watson in the mid-2000s Spider-Man films opposite Tobey Maguire. She also starred in Wimbledon (2004), Elizabethtown (2005), and Marie Antoinette (2006), and won the Best Actress award at Cannes for Melancholia (2011). Dunst was nominated for Golden Globe awards for her performances on FX's Fargo and Showtime's On Becoming a God in Central Florida. In 2021, Dunst costarred with her husband Jesse Plemons in The Power of the Dog, which landed her another Golden Globe nod, as well as her first Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actress.\n\n02 of 10\n\nEliza Dushku (Missy Pantone)\n\nThe Buffy star played transfer student Missy Pantone, who — despite hating cheerleaders — joins the Toros and helps Torrance lead the team to nationals with her gymnastics skills.\n\nDushku returned to TV with the early-2000s supernatural drama Tru Calling and Dollhouse in the late-2000s, which reunited the star with Buffy creator Joss Whedon. The Albanian American actress directed the documentary Dear Albania (2015) — where she and her brother travel throughout the country to explore its history and culture — and voiced She-Hulk in the animated series Hulk and the Agents of S.M.A.S.H. Dushku then had a stint on the courtroom drama Bull with costar Michael Weatherly, but left the show after making sexual harassment allegations against Weatherly.\n\n03 of 10\n\nGabrielle Union (Isis)\n\nGabrielle Union joined Bring It On as Isis, the captain of the rival East Compton Clovers. After watching the Toros copy their routines for the past several years, Isis decides to fight back and leads the Clovers (SPOILER ALERT!) to their first national championship.\n\nUnion followed up Bring It On with movie roles in Bad Boys II (2003), The Honeymooners (2005), Think Like a Man (2012), Top Five (2014), Breaking In (2018), and Cheaper by the Dozen (2022). In 2014, she starred on the BET show Being Mary Jane, which concluded in 2019 with a movie finale, and continued to earn TV roles on L.A.'s Finest and Truth Be Told.\n\n04 of 10\n\nJesse Bradford (Cliff Pantone)\n\nJesse Bradford played Cliff, Missy's brother and Torrance's romantic interest in Bring It On. Cliff woos Torrance with a mixtape of a song he wrote for her: \"Oh Torrance, can't stand your cheerleading squad, but I love your pom-poms. I'll feed you bonbons all night,\" and develops a surprising passion for the sport of cheerleading.\n\nIn 2002, Bradford starred in Clockstoppers, a sci-fi comedy, and Swimfan, a thriller opposite Erika Christensen. In 2006, he appeared in Clint Eastwood's critically acclaimed Flags of Our Fathers and had a major role in 2009's I Hope They Serve Beer in Hell, based on Tucker Max's best-seller of the same name. He also starred on NBC's short-lived 2012 series Guys With Kids and Crackle's streaming show Sequestered; had an arc on USA's Shooter; and appeared in the films The Year of Spectacular Men (2017), California No (2020), and Merry Kiss Cam (2022).\n\n05 of 10\n\nNatina Reed (Jenelope)\n\nNatina Reed played Jenelope, one of the East Compton cheerleaders who challenges the Toros.\n\nReed and her costars Shamari DeVoe and Brandi Williams were part of the girl group Blaque, whose single \"Bring It All to Me\" peaked at No. 4 on the Billboard chart in 1999. The band was preparing for a comeback in 2012 before Reed tragically died after being struck by a car as she was crossing the street.\n\n06 of 10\n\nLindsay Sloane (Big Red)\n\nThe Sabrina the Teenage Witch actress played Big Red, the former captain of the Toros. Before graduating and handing the baton over to Torrance, Big Red led the team to several titles by secretly recording and stealing East Compton's routines.\n\nSloane returned to the big screen in She's Out of My League (2010), A Good Old Fashioned Orgy (2011), Horrible Bosses (2011) and its 2014 sequel, and Endings, Beginnings (2019). Throughout the years, Sloane's also made several guest appearances on TV shows like That '70s Show, The West Wing, Entourage, Psych, How I Met Your Mother, and Playing House. She was a series regular on CBS' The Odd Couple, which ran from 2015 to 2017.\n\n07 of 10\n\nIan Roberts (Sparky Polastri)\n\nIan Roberts' screen time in Bring It On was short but memorable. He played choreographer Sparky Polastri, who's hired by the Toros to choreograph a new routine for the squad. The routine failed, but the spirit fingers will live on forever.\n\nThe Upright Citizens Brigade alum was a regular on Late Night With Conan O'Brien, appearing in many of his sketches.
