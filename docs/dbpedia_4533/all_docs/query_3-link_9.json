        "text": "The Ten Best Basil Rathbone Sherlock Holmes Movies\n\nBy Randall Stock\n\nBasil Rathbone made 14 Sherlock Holmes movies from 1939 to 1946. He remains the iconic image of the great detective to many. While all these films are worth watching, some are better than others. This list ranks the Rathbone movies, provides details about each film, recommends the best DVD version, and suggests how to build a Rathbone collection.\n\nThe Top 10 Basil Rathbone Sherlock Holmes Movies\n\nMovie Score 1. The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes 100 2. The Hound of the Baskervilles 92 3. The Scarlet Claw 90 4. The Pearl of Death 80 5. The Spider Woman 69 6. Sherlock Holmes Faces Death 68 7. The House of Fear 63 8. Sherlock Holmes and the Secret Weapon 57 9. The Woman in Green 43 10. Terror by Night 33\n\nSee also my list of the Year's Best Sherlock Holmes movies and TV on DVD & Blu-ray.\n\nRanking, Reviews, and Scores\n\nThere are plenty of places on the Internet that provide movie reviews and rankings. However, they all have various limitations, and to get a really good assessment you should check several different sources and then somehow combine their selections. All of that can take a lot of time, so I've done the research and analysis for you and put it all in a single list.\n\nYou can read the details of the ranking process below. Scores provide a simple value for comparing the relative positions of each movie.\n\nThere are many cheap and low-quality versions of these movies on DVD and VHS. Don't waste your time or money. I've listed high-quality DVDs below, and called out a few as \"highly recommended\" based on the picture/sound quality, movie ranking, extras, and price. See the key to movie entries for more details.\n\nThis page includes details on all 14 movies (with DVD notes), a description of DVD Double Feature and Box sets, and my overall recommendation for DVDs.\n\nMy website also has lists of the Year's Best Sherlock Holmes books and DVDs, the best Holmes gifts for new fans, and information about an excellent book about the Basil Rathbone Holmes movies.\n\nTop 10\n\nOverall Best Rathbone DVD Choice\n\nTop 10\n\nRecommended Rathbone DVD Essentials\n\nTop 10\n\nBest Choice for the Rathbone Enthusiast\n\nTop 10\n\nBasil Rathbone Movie Information\n\nDetails on all of the Sherlock Holmes movies with Basil Rathbone, listed in rank order.

Bertram Millhauser wrote the screenplay for five of the films, including three of the top four Universal movies. The best Universal film, The Scarlet Claw, had a screenplay by Edmund L. Hartmann and Roy William Neill based on a story by Paul Gangelin and Brenda Weisberg.\n\nTop 10\n\nDouble Feature and Boxed Sets of Sherlock Holmes DVDs\n\nWhile other collections of Rathbone films do exist, the ones below (and The Complete Sherlock Holmes Collection) are generally considered to provide the best picture quality and extras. Scores in this section only apply within a collection type. The Double Feature DVDs are a better value than the 4-DVD Boxed sets, but they do put two movies on a single disc. I recommend getting the Double Feature DVDs.\n\nTop 10\n\nTop 10\n\nTop 10\n\nTop 10\n\nTop 10\n\nTop 10\n\nTop 10\n\nTop 10\n\nRanking and Scoring Process Details\n\nThis list is based on many hours of research both on the Internet and at libraries. Internet sources are convenient but have many limitations. For example, the Rathbone films at Amazon and Yahoo have only a small number of user reviews, and thus can be swayed by just a few people. The IMDB is better, but printed reviews, especially those by informed critics who are not trying to sell something, can be even more valuable.\n\nAfter considering half a dozen ways to combine various reviews, I determined the best approach was to select a set of the most credible sources and then apply a weighted voting scale to their choices. This is similar to the approach described in my December 1999 Baker Street Journal article \"The Best of the Best\" to determine the best Sherlock Holmes stories.\n\nSince there are 14 Rathbone films, a source's highest-ranked choice got 14 points and the lowest-ranked choice got 1 point. Ties split the points for the associated ranks. I added the points for all sources for each movie, and the movie with the highest number of points was ranked first on my list.\n\nI then computed a \"score\" for a movie by dividing each movie's point total by the number of points received by the highest-ranked movie and multiplying by 100. That provides a score of \"100\" for the highest-ranked film and makes it simple to compare the relative positions of the others.\n\nFor double features and boxed sets, I added the raw points for each movie in the set and used the total to establish a relative score for the two-film or four-film collection. Note that this score only reflects the movies in the set; it does not account for any extras or packaging.\n\nScores only apply to similar items. You can compare standalone films to other standalone films, and double features to other double features, but the scores don't let you compare a double feature to a 4-movie collection.\n\nI also checked all the sources for outliers â€“ movies that some important source rated well above the overall rank. When it seemed appropriate I've listed these possible exceptions in the film notes for each entry.\n\nTop 10\n\nMore Information\n\nNow that you have the best Basil Rathbone DVD and movie information, including the ten best Basil Rathbone DVDs, check out some related pages on this site about the following topics:\n\nInformation about an excellent book about the Basil Rathbone Holmes movies\n\nBasil Rathbone and Sherlock Holmes Make 1950s TV History\n\nA Basil Rathbone Sherlock Holmes Film Festival at the Stanford Theatre\n\nThe 10 Best Sherlock Holmes Gifts and Recommended Recent Releases and Publications\n\nThe Best Sherlock Holmes Stories"
