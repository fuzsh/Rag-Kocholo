Have an account? .\n\nThe cheer film \"Bring It On\" has become a cultural phenomenon since its release in 2000.\n\nKirsten Dunst almost wasn't cast as Torrance and the film was originally called \"Cheer Fever.\"\n\nThe movie has also been adapted into a Tony-nominated musical written by Lin-Manuel Miranda.\n\nVisit Insider's homepage for more stories.\n\nSign up to get the inside scoop on today’s biggest stories in markets, tech, and business — delivered daily.

Even 20 years later it's still a favorite among many for its major sass and killer choreography — but even fans may not know everything about it.\n\nThis story is available exclusively to Business Insider subscribers. Become an Insider and start reading now. Have an account? .\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe iconic opening cheer almost didn't make the cut.\n\nFans of the movie know \"I'm sexy, I'm cute, I'm popular to boot\" as the raunchy opening dream sequence of the movie, but this cheer was almost cut entirely. Screenwriter Jessica Bendinger said she fought to keep it in the script.\n\nSpeaking to HuffPost, Bendinger said, \"I was like, 'If you cut this cheer, then it's just a dumb movie! Who cares?' You need to let everybody know your tongue is in your cheek. There needs to be self-awareness.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThere are six \"Bring It On\" movies total.\n\nAfter its subsequent success, \"Bring It On\" went on to have five spin-off films.\n\nThe films featured different storylines and characters, but each had the same amount of attitude and cheerleading at the forefront.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEvery actor who auditioned had to have a cheer prepared.\n\nWhen auditioning for the film, actors needed to perform a cheer for casting directors.\n\nDirector Peyton Reed told DVD Talk the producers \"needed to know [the actors] at least had some sense of rhythm and coordination because not only did they need to act, but they needed to meet the physical demands of the roles.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDunst was not originally cast as Torrance.\n\nActress Marley Shelton (\"Never Been Kissed,\" \"Uptown Girls\") was actually in talks to play Torrance.\n\nThe film's director revealed to MTV that after a few meetings with Shelton, she turned down the role to pursue a part in the \"rival cheerleader movie\" of the time called \"Sugar, Spice, and Semi-Automatics.\"\n\nThey then offered the role of Torrance to Dunst, who turned it down a few times before accepting.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Toros and the Clovers had different choreographers.\n\nThe film's choreographer, Anne Fletcher hired, another choreographer named Hi-Hat who she assigned to choreograph the routines performed by the Clovers.\n\nReed told BuzzFeed, \"When Hi-Hat choreographed 'Brr, It's Cold In Here' for the Clovers, Anne had a great time choreographing the really stiff, white-girl version for the Toros.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe film's screenwriter also wrote \"Stick It,\" \"Aquamarine,\" and episodes of \"Sex And The City.\"\n\nIn addition to penning \"Bring It On,\" Bendinger has writing credits on \"Sex And The City,\" \"Stick It,\" and \"Aquamarine.\"\n\nBendinger explained that although she knows she is known for teen movies, she considers her films \"more as coming of age stories.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDunst improvised Torrance's bedroom dancing.\n\nBecause the film wanted to pay tribute to the athleticism of cheerleaders, most of the scenes were choreographed in advance.\n\nOne that was not prepared in advance, however, was when Torrance hears Cliff's music for the first time and dances on her bed.\n\nIn an interview with BuzzFeed, Reed said of the scene, \"We knew the idea and the emotion we wanted, but I think we only did a few takes. That was really all Kirsten.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJames Franco and Jason Schwartzman auditioned for the role of Cliff.\n\nBoth James Franco and Jason Schwartzman auditioned for the role of Cliff, but Jesse Bradford was eventually cast.\n\nReed told MTV that although both Franco and Schwartzman brought interesting perspectives to the character, they were a little more \"off-beat\" whereas Bradford offered the full package.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe film was initially going to be named \"Cheer Fever.\"\n\nWhile the film was in its early stages, it was referred to as \"Cheer Fever,\" Reed told MTV.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nUnion almost didn't appear in the film.\n\nUnion, who played Isis, almost appeared in the 2001 cheer movie \"Sugar and Spice\" instead of \"Bring It On.\"\n\nSpeaking to MTV, Union said her decision partially came down to which film she felt was more committed to diversity.\n\n\"There were a ton of teen movies at the time that I passed on that were not committed to getting it right. The reason why I even took the table read of 'Cheer Fever' was because the cheerleading movie I wanted about bank robbing [\"Sugar and Spice\"] — they didn't want to go black on any of the characters,\" she told the network.\n\n\"So it's interesting, the group that didn't want to commit to diversity didn't seem to do well and the movie that was about righting the wrongs did well, and that included diversity,\" she added.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe audition song cost producers $40,000 to license.\n\nReed told BuzzFeed that Warrant's hit \"Cherry Pie\" cost the studio $40,000 to license.\n\nThe song was used during the audition sequence, and according to Reed, \"it was so perfect for that scene; it needed to be raunchy and inappropriate.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDushku's work on \"Buffy the Vampire Slayer\" played a role in her casting.\n\nDushku, who played Missy in \"Bring It On,\" was previously the most well-known for playing Faith on \"Buffy The Vampire Slayer.\"\n\nReed said that, prior to casting, the film's producers were fans of \"Buffy,\" and familiar with Dushku's work.\n\nWhen casting the role of Missy, Reed explained they wanted someone totally opposite of Dunst, saying, \"I loved the idea that physically those two looked different: one's a blonde, one's a brunette. Almost like a second Archie comic in a way, there's Betty and Veronica. And she just seemed to be that character.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe \"Bring It On\" girls were somewhat inspired by Gwen Stefani.\n\nBendinger told MTV she had a picture of No Doubt's Gwen Stefani hanging on her computer while writing the script and she drew on her sassy sense of empowerment for Torrance and the girls.\n\nThe screenwriter also told Austinist using Stefani as inspiration helped her \"make cheerleading cooler than it was.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"Bring It On\" became a Broadway musical that Lin-Manuel Miranda worked on.\n\nThe beloved film was adapted for the stage in 2011 with the help of \"Hamilton\" creator Lin-Manuel Miranda.\n\nMiranda wrote all of the music for the show and earned two Tony nominations for best musical and best choreography.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTorrance is the role Dunst feels closest to in real life.\n\nSpeaking with Julianne Moore for Gotham Magazine, Dunst talked about the strong connection she felt with her \"Bring It On\" character and her background in cheer.\n\n\"When I was 16 and did 'Bring It On.' I was that girl. It was like me being in high school as myself. It wasn't a stretch at all,\" she said. \"I was a cheerleader, my best friend was a cheerleader. I wasn't in competitions, but I watched them on TV.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRead next\n\nAdvertisement"
