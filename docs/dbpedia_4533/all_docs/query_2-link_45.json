        "text": "Past Productions\n\nFor 50 years, Ford’s Theatre has produced plays and musicals exploring the American experience and celebrating Lincoln’s legacy.\n\nAs a premier cultural destination in Washington, D.C., Ford’s Theatre brings politically and socially vital plays to the stage, entertaining both locals and out-of-towners with a full season each year from September to May. By commissioning new plays like The Guard as well as Lincoln-based world premieres The Heavens Are Hung In Black and Necessary Sacrifices, Ford’s Theatre is making its mark on American theatre and bringing history to life through the power of theatre. For it’s artistic work, Ford’s Theatre received the National Medal of Arts in 2008, the highest award given by the U.S. government to artists, arts institutions and arts patrons."
