        "text": "Post by Ish Kabbible on\n\nI thought a general free-wheeling movie thread could get enough participation to be lively. It could be about a movie you've seen,an actor,actress or director you'd like to discuss or a genre in general.In my mind,a classic movie,at this point in time,is before the 90s but if it turns out to include whats in the cinema now then so be it.So feel free to tell us what you've enjoyed or despised lately.I know we have many interesting observations and factoids out there\n\nPost by Hoosier X on\n\nI saw The Shootist a few days ago on TCM. It was on a little later than I usually watch movies, but I started watching just to see how it was. And it was pretty darn good! So I stayed up and watched it.\n\nI'm a big fan of John Wayne's movies. I think Stagecoach is one of the best movies ever made. I also like Fort Apache, Sands of Iwo Jima, They Were Expendable and also those hour-long movies he made in the 1930s for Republic.\n\nThe Shootist was Wayne's last movie, and I've never heard anybody make a big deal of it or say it was any good, so I never made any effort to watch it. My mistake.\n\nHe's actually acting instead of behaving. He's a different guy in The Shootist, and the same John Wayne he is in most of his other movies. And he's supported by Jimmy Stewart, Lauren Bacall, John Carradine, Ron Howard, Richard Boone and Scatman Crothers.\n\nIf you're a John Wayne movie fan and you've never seen The Shootist, consider this an endorsement.\n\nAnd I saw part of McClintock yesterday. I've seen it before, and that section reminded that I'm not overly fond of this movie. Yvonne DeCarlo is good, and so is Maureen O'Hara, but O'Hara's role is written so over-the-top shrewish that there is no way she can be sympathetic and Wayne's role immediately becomes the only sane alternative for the audience's sympathy because O'Hara's character is so rude and snobbish. Also, McClintock is kind of stupid in many other ways.\n\nPost by Jesse on\n\nI'm a big fan of John Wayne's movies. I think Stagecoach is one of the best movies ever made.\n\nI watched John Ford's Stagecoach awhile ago and really enjoyed it. Great action and the archetypal characters still hold up today, except maybe the drunk doctor which comes off more silly now. Although that same archetype was used well by Mel Brooks in Blazing Saddles and made that much more lovable by the exaggerated performance & charm of Gene Wilder.\n\nPost by Ish Kabbible on\n\nHe's actually acting instead of behaving. He's a different guy in The Shootist, and the same John Wayne he is in most of his other movies.\n\nJohn Wayne knew at the time that he was dying and the Shootist would be his last film.Not to be morbid but it would be an interesting list of films were the lead actor/actress knew it would be their last.I rank The Shootist as one of the best of those films.Love him or hate him,its an essential movie\n\nPost by Hoosier X on\n\nI'm watching the end of A Stolen Life right now. It's from 1946 and it stars Bette Davis. She plays two sisters, and the evil one is in love with the good sister's husband. When the good one dies in a boating accident, the evil one takes her place!\n\nI'm a big Bette Davis fan (ever since I was about 8 when I saw Whatever Happened to Baby Jane? in the middle of the night in the slot where they usually showed Lugosi and Karloff movies) but I've never seen this one. I wish I'd seen it from the start. Glenn Ford is the husband and Charles Ruggles is in it as well. (If they had made it in the 1930s, I could see Herbert Marshall or Ralph Bellamy or Pat O'Brian in the Glenn Ford role.)\n\nIt is such a perfect Bette Davis role! I can't even fairly judge whether it's any good or not because Bette is perfect in a movie like this without even hardly trying.\n\nPost by Hoosier X on\n\nHe's actually acting instead of behaving.

Anti-war Vietnam veterans wanted to talk to him at the GOP convention in Miami in 1968 and he wouldn't even give them the time of day. Shameful.\n\nPost by Ish Kabbible on\n\nJohn Wayne knew at the time that he was dying and the Shootist would be his last film.Not to be morbid but it would be an interesting list of films were the lead actor/actress knew it would be their last.I rank The Shootist as one of the best of those films.Love him or hate him,its an essential movie\n\nI love a lot of his movies, but I'm not too fond of the man himself.

Shameful.\n\nBeing one of those long-haired hippies back then,I wasn't fond of him either.But as I got older I was able to put that aside and just enjoy the films he did. No getting around the fact he was an American icon. I read in many different sources that when he worked on the set with those who had politically hard-left radical leanings,he was cordial and polite.Those people had nothing bad to say about him\n\nPost by Hoosier X on\n\nI'm a big fan of John Wayne's movies.

And despite that, the characters are all so great that they surpass how we've come to view these archetypes. Claire Trevor is the hooker with the heart of gold. Andy Devine is the goofy sidekick. John Carradine is the Southern gentleman.\n\nAnd that drunken doctor is the ever-amazing Thomas Mitchell! He's Uncle Billy in It's a Wonderful Life! He's Scarlett's dad in Gone with the Wind! He's Sheriff Pat Garrett in The Outlaw!\n\nIt's the first movie to use Monument Valley and I think it's the first movie where the protagonists are saved by the cavalry!\n\nSuch a great movie.\n\nPost by Hoosier X on\n\nI love a lot of his movies, but I'm not too fond of the man himself.

It is so over-the-top insanely stupid that it's hard to believe it was intended as a serious attack on the Communist threat. It is hysterical! And one of the Communists is Hans Conried, best known for providing the voice for Snively Whiplash."
