        "text": "â€˜THE SPIDER WOMANâ€™\n\nPlease feel free to comment on my review.\n\nBasil Rathboneâ€™s Sherlock and Nigel Bruceâ€™s Watson vs. the Spider Woman\n\nSadly itâ€™s not Spider-Woman as you might know her from the Spider-Man universe. That Spider-Woman hadnâ€™t been invented in the 1940s. Though it would have been nice to see her in this film! ðŸ™‚\n\nâ€˜The Spider Womanâ€™ is the seventh film of the Basil Rathbone/Nigel Bruce series of â€˜Sherlock Holmesâ€™ film. I would like to think that these â€˜Sherlock Holmesâ€™ films have become better under Universal Pictures.\n\nItâ€™s amazing how many â€˜Sherlock Holmesâ€™ films Basil Rathbone and Nigel Bruce made together from 1939 to 1946! They must have had a lot of momentum to keep these films made during the war years.\n\nIn â€˜The Spider Womanâ€™, Sherlock Holmes fakes his own death when he and Watson are holidaying in Scotland. It turns out Holmes is engaged in a battle of wits that concern the suicides of wealthy men.\n\nâ€˜Pyjama suicidesâ€™ as theyâ€™re called in the film. But Sherlock is convinced that the suicides are actually murders. With Watsonâ€™s help, Sherlock Holmes comes up against the very beautiful Adrea Spedding.\n\nSheâ€™s responsible for the murders of wealthy men which involve planting deadly spiders into their rooms. Will Holmes and Watson uncover the mystery on how and why Adrea Spedding is doing this?\n\nApparently, this film is based on certain elements from certain works by Conan Doyle. They include the 1890 novel â€˜The Sign of the Fourâ€™ and certain short tales like â€˜The Adventure of the Devilâ€™s Footâ€™.\n\nâ€˜The Final Problemâ€™, â€˜The Adventure of the Empty Houseâ€™ and â€˜The Adventure of the Speckled Bandâ€™ are also involved. They help to suit the contemporary tale happening in this â€˜Sherlock Holmesâ€™ film. ðŸ™‚\n\nI like how Basil Rathboneâ€™s Sherlock comes back from the dead in a disguise to fool Watson. Again, I donâ€™t believe Benedict Cumberbatchâ€™s Sherlock does disguises the same way as Basil Rathbone does.\n\nIt was very funny when Nigel Bruceâ€™s Dr. Watson assumed Arthur Hohl as Adam Gilflower was Sherlock Holmes in disguise and he turned out to be wrong. Thatâ€™s a favourite moment of mine here.\n\nFun fact: in â€˜Sherlockâ€™ with Benedict Cumberbatch, the episode â€˜The Empty Hearseâ€™ paid homage to â€˜The Spider Womanâ€™ when Watson mistook a genuine client for Holmes. Iâ€™ve yet to see that episode.\n\nGales Sondergaard stars as Adrea Spedding, the titular â€˜Spider Womanâ€™ and the villainess of the film. In many ways, sheâ€™s like a female version of Moriarty and can be quite intimidating and threatening.\n\nI argue sheâ€™s better than Missy from â€˜Doctor Whoâ€™. ðŸ˜€ Dennis Hoey also returns to play Inspector Lestrade in the film. Lestrade becomes helpful to Holmes and Watson when they are investigating. ðŸ™‚\n\nBasil Rathbone and Nigel Bruce continue to deliver amazing performances as their characters. Basilâ€™s Sherlock seems to have pre-planned everything out whilst Nigel Bruceâ€™s Watson is kept in the dark. ðŸ™‚\n\nThe film also features Vernon Downing as Norman Locke, Alec Craig as Radlik, Mary Gordon as Mrs. Hudson, Teddy Infuhr as Larry and Angelo Rossitto as the Pygmy. All the cast are amazing in the film.\n\nThere are also uncredited actors in the film like Harry Cording as Fred Garvin and Robert Milasch as Carnival Barker. Why these people should be uncredited in the cast list at the end, Iâ€™m not very sure.\n\nIt did get tense when Sherlock was trapped in a rotating shooting gallery, and Watson and Lestrade were about to open fire with .22 rifles. This does remind me of a 1960s â€˜Batmanâ€™ story that I watched.\n\nIncidentally, the moving targets in the shooting gallery are Hitler, Mussolini and Hirohito cartoons. This was to indicate that these films were made during World War II, like previous films did before. ðŸ™‚\n\nAs indicated, there are many allusions to the â€˜Sherlock Holmesâ€™ canon regarding these films. I canâ€™t claim to be a â€˜Sherlock Holmesâ€™ expert, but the filmmakers seem to acknowledge the original books.\n\nApparently, Gale Sondergaard went on to appear in a similar role in the misleadingly-titled â€˜The Spider Woman Strikes Backâ€™. Sadly, Sherlock Holmes didnâ€™t return and she had a different name in it.\n\nâ€˜Spider Womanâ€™ has been an engaging and gripping â€˜Sherlock Holmesâ€™ film to watch. I like how Basilâ€™s Sherlock and Nigelâ€™s Watson tackled the villainous Spider Woman and solved the mysterious deaths.\n\nThe DVD special features are as follows. Thereâ€™s the â€˜Restoring Sherlock Holmesâ€™ featurette, production notes by Richard Valley, a photo gallery and an original theatrical trailer.\n\nâ€˜The Spider Womanâ€™ rating â€“ 8/10"
