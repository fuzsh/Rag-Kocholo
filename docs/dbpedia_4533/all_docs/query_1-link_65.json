        "text": "The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes\n\nPage Two\n\nA video clip with Sherlock Holmes and Professor Moriarty\n\n\"The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes is an attempted whodunit on a high scale but with most of the thrills of the 'B' mystery thrillers missing, and as such becomes rather tame screen fare.\" Hollywood Reporter, September 2, 1939\n\n\"'The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes' is a slick, ornate, and cunningly involved who-perpetrated-it variation of the ordinary garden variety of whodunit. Its defiance of logic in plot cause and effect and character behavior is shrugged off with the weird and exciting fascination that hold unflagging attention.\" Daily Variety, September 2, 1939\n\nHolmes: \"Your father was murdered on May 11?\"\n\nThey race to the park to save Lloyd Brandon.\n\n\"Fine atmospheric production that catches admirably the spirit of the classic Sherlock Holmes tales of sleuthing. Basil Rathbone is admirable as the famous detective, and Nigel Bruce is perfect as his helper, Dr. Watson.\" The Film Daily, September 5, 1939\n\n\"Despite a far-fetched plot, this murder mystery melodrama is pretty exciting, mainly because of the excellent production values. The settings, lighting, photography, and music, in addition to the usual stock tricks, are of considerable aid in creating an eerie atmosphere, putting the spectator in a receptive mood for a story of this type. There are several situations that hold one in tense suspense.\" Harrison's Reports, September 9, 1939\n\n\"Smooth script, a well told story, a flexible tale which is neither handicapped by age nor held down by London's housetops ... Holds the imagination and interest throughout.\" Ward Marsh, Cleveland Plain Dealer, September 5, 1939\n\n\"Extraordinary good sense and skill have gone into the making of The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes ... at once an exciting thriller and a faithful re-creation of a famous literary figure.\" Howard Barnes, New York Herald Tribune, September 2, 1939\n\nThey arrive too late to save Lloyd.\n\nHolmes: \"Do you observe anything singular about these footprints?\"\n\n\"If you enjoyed Basil Rathbone doing his Sherlock Holmes sleuthing in Hound of the Baskervilles, you're sure to enjoy even more the new chapter, The Adventures of sherlock Holmes. Definitely the swankiest of the whodunits, The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes has excellent production value, in fact Gene Markey and 20th Century Fox have given the picture so much class that it is difficult to recognize another of those 'who got the jewels?' plots Rathbone is smooth and suave. Nigel Bruce continue the best Dr. Watson of either stage or screen. Ida Lupino is appealing and Alan Marshal well helps her carry the love interest.\" The Los Angeles Examiner, August 24, 1939\n\n\"Eerie, foggy settings heighten suspense. Fine characterizations.\" The Educational Screen, October 1939\n\n\"The first of three possible endings had Holmes explaining how the vengeful Mateo believed that Ann's father had been responsible for the death of his own, and had stolen the mine that made the Brandons rich; meanwhile, Brandon family lawyer Jerrold's shifty behavior had been caused by his desire to shield Ann form the truth about her dead father. None of this crucial background information is conveyed in the finished piece.\" Alan Barnes, Sherlock Holmes on Screen, 2002\n\n\"Basil Rathbone and Nigel Bruce are as good a team as could have been chosen to play the parts of Holmes and Watson.\" Motion Picture Reviews, September 1939\n\nHolmes realizes that Moriarty has shaved.\n\n\"Moriarty concocted that Brandon case with all its fantastic convolutions expressly to divert my attention at the time the Star of Delhi was delivered.\"\n\n\"Rathbone was again [as in The Hound of the Baskervilles] excellent; his timing and phrasing seemed to echo the Holmes of Conan Doyle's pages, while he cuts a figure reminiscent of the Paget drawings.\" David Stuart Davies, Holmes of the Movies, 1968\n\n\"One can't help liking the new Holmes film, ... with Basil Rathbone in the calabash and a swirl of fog standing by for its entrance cues.\" Frank S. Nugent, The New York Times, September 2, 1939\n\nCANDID PHOTO GALLERY:\n\nBasil Rathbone and Nigel Bruce taking a tea break\n\nThe film playing at the Roxy in New York City\n\nAlfred Werker, Basil Rathbone, Ida Lupino, Nigel Bruce, Leon Shamroy\n\nBasil Rathbone and Ida Lupino study their lines between takes.\n\nNigel Bruce, George Zucco, and Basil Rathbone with unidentified visitors to the studio.\n\nThe Drive Leader, M. A. Levy, and Roger Ferri are caught by the cameraman on the set of The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes. Seated at left is director Al Werker. Standing, center, is Basil Rathbone in character, and at right, Nigel Bruce, who plays Dr. Watson.\n\n(\"The Drive\" refers to the S. R. Kent Drive, named after Sidney R. Kent, head of Fox Film Corporation in 1932. 1939 was the seventh annual S.R. Kent Drive. Fox merged with 20th Century in 1935.)\n\nBack to Page One\n\nGo to Page Three (posters, lobby cards and promo photos)"
