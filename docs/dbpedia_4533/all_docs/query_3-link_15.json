        "text": "Basil Rathbone, creator of radio’s version of Doyle’s famous sleuth, sees character as part of old England. The following is an article written by Basil Rathbone. Titled “On Playing Sherlock Holmes,” it was published in the March 1940 issue of Radio Varieties. Many persons ask me what is the difference in your feeling when you face the NBC microphone as Sherlock Holmes and when you face the camera. I would be only too willing to oblige them through Radio Varieties except that there is really no difference. In either case, I feel Holmes to be as real as my Dr. Watson, Mr. Nigel Bruce. Like countless millions of Holmes’ admirers throughout the world, I see him as a very part of old England. As I conceive him, and my concept may differ radically with those of Editor Wilton Rosenthal’s readers, Holmes was a man with tremendous powers of concentration. His absorption in his calling was extraordinary. Very properly, he never associated with women; evinced no interest in them. (Imagine what a hell it would have …\n\nOriginally posted on Once upon a screen…:\n\nIn honor of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle (1859-1930). ♦ The New Adventures of Sherlock Holmes was an old-time radio show which aired in the USA from October 2, 1939 to July 7, 1947. Originally, the show starred Basil Rathbone as Sherlock Holmes and Nigel Bruce as Dr. Watson. Together, they starred in 220 episodes which aired weekly on Mondays from 8:30 to 9:00pm. Bromo Quinine sponsored some of the earlier programs on the NBC Blue Network and for a period Parker Pen was the sponsor. The show first aired on the Blue Network but later moved to the Mutual Broadcasting System. Basil Rathbone’s last episode as the famous detective was “The Singular Affair of the Baconian Cipher.” He was eager to separate himself from the cast type of Holmes, and even though the show’s sponsor Petri Wine offered him generous pay to continue, he decided to move on. Once he did, the sponsor did as well, and Tom Conway took the starring role, though Nigel Bruce got top…\n\nNeve’s note – This article first appeared in EVERYBODY’S DIGEST, in 1946. Rathbone was to quit Holmes, Hollywood and his friendship with Bruce within a few months of it going to press. Click on the pdf button to download a copy of the original article Elementary My Dear Rathbone By Jules Archer (Everybody’s Digest, 1946) Basil Rathbone was about to give the business to Dr(sic) Moriarty in another Sherlock Holmes film, when Denis Conan Doyle, scion of the world’s most famous whodunit writer visited the set. Rehearsals were stalled, while Doyle threw his weight around, passing unsolicited judgments on the props, costumes and sets. Rathbone gnawed his fingernails. “Hmmm,” deliberated the visitor, scrutinizing the Hollywood version of Baker Street. “Ya-as, it’s veddy much like my fahthah’s description, veddy much indeed!” Nigel Bruce, more widely recognized as Dr Watson made ominous sounds. Unable to stand any more, he whispered something in Rathbone’s ear. The razor-nosed film sleuth reacted with amusement. “Sounds rather silly,” he said, “but let’s do it.” Rehearsals finally began, with Doyle shunted tactfully …\n\nSo it’s Halloween!… Light your pumpkin lantern, extinguish the lights (if you’re in lower Manhattan you can skip this step), throw a log on the stove, get a glass of wine and a slice of pie and settle down for a selection of reader-nominated excerpts of The Baz at All Hallow’s… First, suggested by Cinegeek, some music…. Are the candles flickering a little? The drapes billowing as a draft buffets the window? Excellent. Next up, and nominated by Tim is Baz reading THE TELL-TALE HEART by Edgar Allen Poe, with very cool visuals and effects… Change of tone for the next offering, suggested by femgirl, a clip from THE BLACK SLEEP(1956). It was Lugosi’s last film, and Basil looks as if he wishes it was his. Lon Chaney jr plays someone known as Mongo, and Tor Johnson is locked in the cellar. Truly terrifying, but not in a good way. I suffered additional cognitive dissonance the first time I saw this clip as I thought Basil was shouting “Taxi!” and briefly wondered if he’d lost …\n\nWell, here it is – The Baz’s Last Bow as Holmes. Filmed in early 1946. After completing it he would refuse to renew both his radio and his Universal contracts, tarnish his long friendship with Nigel Bruce (who, according to his daughter didn’t like “the way it was done” and blamed Basil’s wife). He’d up sticks and flee Hollywood for New York. The following year he’d star in THE HEIRESS on Broadway and win the Tony for Best Actor. He wouldn’t make another movie for eight years. And that would be CASANOVA’S BIG NIGHT a venture I suspect this patrician gent undertook for the money alone. Why, exactly, did he take such a massively extreme step? Did he really feel the need to pull the plug on his entire movie career just to rid himself of Sherlock Holmes? Or did he feel as if Holmes had already wrecked him for other movie parts anyway? If he’d stayed in Hollywood would he have been offered work, or would he have languished? Was the ‘curse’ of Holmes …\n\nAs it’s THE Week we have MORE Sherlock caps… The Hound is the second-best outing of the Baz as Sherlock, and was his own favorite (for what that’s worth). In his autobiography he said something to the effect that if he’d only made this one Holmes movie he’d have ended up a lot less famous, but much happier as a creative artist. (Baz, you were such a snob in some ways, much as I love you). The movie is notable – or notorious – to movie buffs for two egregious or strange omissions. 1.There’s no soundtrack music. None. At All. 2. Rathbone was second-billed below Fox’s new contract-player, Richard hello I’m talking wallpaper Greene! – Ah the fine madness that was Hollywood’s Golden Age! Anyhow, here are the captures… As a slideshow: And in the Gallery… CLICK…. ON THE PIC\n\nApparently it’s Sherlock Holmes week. Why does no one tell me these things? If you are running a Basil Rathbone blog then you literally have to take notice of this. I mean I think there’s actually a law about it. So, Baz – if you’re around – I’m sorry. I know you were ambivalent (at best) about your identity as Holmes, but that doesn’t change the fact you were one of the greatest Sherlocks of all time (arguably THE greatest). You looked like the Paget drawings come to life (though prettier). You did restless, cerebral brilliance better than any actor I can name (apart from Jeremy Brett). And I am going to fecking say so whether you like it or not. This week is going to be Sherlock Week on The Baz. Entirely by coincidence (really truly) a guy I know at uni is working on an animation project – based on The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes, and today he let me have a bunch of the fairly high-res captures he’s been making. So…Synchronicity is …"
