        "text": "The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes\n\n(1939), 85 minutes b&w\n\n\"The Struggle of Super-Minds in the Crime of the Century!\" reads the tagline for The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes. The second of the 14 Sherlock Holmes movies starring Basil Rathbone and Nigel Bruce, this one is my favorite. It is exciting, and fast-paced, with a clever mystery story. Like The Hound of the Baskervilles, The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes is an evocative period adventure, which never goes out of style. This popular film is loosely based on a play called Sherlock Holmes, written by William Gillette. Rathbone is a perfect Sherlock Holmes, and George Zucco is superb as the evil mastermind, Professor Moriarty. For many fans George Zucco is their favorite Moriarty; Rathbone's personal favorite was Henry Daniell (The Woman in Green).\n\nThe setting is 1894 gas-lit Victorian London. Due to lack of evidence, Holmes' nemesis Moriarty has just been acquitted of a crime although everyone believes him guilty. Leaving the courthouse, Holmes and Moriarty share a cab and some witty dialogue. Holmes tells his enemy, \"You've a magnificent brain, Moriarty. I admire it. I admire it so much I'd like to present it pickled in alcohol to the London Medical Society.\" Moriarty brags that he will pull off the most incredible crime of the century right under Holmes' nose, and the humiliation will break Holmes. Thus begins a battle of wits between the two men.\n\nMoriarty concocts a puzzling, intriguing case to absorb Holmes' interest and to divert his attention from Moriarty's real crime: stealing the crown jewels. Miss Brandon (Ida Lupino) comes to Holmes for help. Her brother has received a strange note, which is just like one their father received before he was killed. Therefore, she fears for her brother's life  and rightly so! Before Holmes can get to him, Mr. Brandon is killed on the street. Almost immediately, Miss Brandon also receives the same, strange, death-portending note. Miss Brandon's fiancé follows her and acts suspiciously, but is only the red herring in this story. Just as Moriarty planned, Holmes becomes completely occupied with the Brandon case, and he ignores a threat to steal the Star of Delhi, a precious emerald arriving by ship the next night.\n\nMoriarty knows Holmes cannot be in two places at once, so while Holmes is protecting Miss Brandon, Moriarty proceeds with his plan to steal the crown jewels. Having replaced the policemen assigned to guard the emerald, and wearing their uniforms, Moriarty and his men escort the Star of Delhi to the Tower of London. Holmes has sent Watson to help guard the emerald, but Watson fails to recognize the now beardless Moriarty. Professor Moriarty stages an unsuccessful attempt to steal the emerald. While the tower guards are chasing Moriarty's associates, the Professor hides inside the chamber containing the crown jewels. Watson recovers the Star of Delhi, and thinks that he has foiled Moriarty.\n\nMeanwhile, at Mrs. Jameson's garden party Holmes, disguised as a \"music hall chap,\" does a song and dance routine while keeping an eye on Miss Brandon. As far as I know, this is the only film in which we hear Basil Rathbone sing. It isn't great singing, but good enough for the character, and a great disguise for Holmes. Later, Holmes hears Miss Brandon's screams coming from the garden. He rushes to her, arriving just in time to see a man about to hurl a Patagonian bolas (a weapon made of long strands of rawhide with leather-coated lead balls on the ends). Holmes knocks Miss Brandon to the ground as the deadly bolas flies by and decapitates a nearby statue. When Holmes learns from the would-be killer that Moriarty is behind this, he figures out what Moriarty is really up to, and he and Watson rush off to the Tower of London in time to thwart Moriarty's theft of the crown jewels. A hand-to-hand battle between Holmes and Moriarty ensues atop the Tower, ending with Moriarty falling to his apparent death below. (Moriarty never really dies. He returns in Sherlock Holmes and the Secret Weapon and again in The Woman in Green.)\n\nIn the final scene, while Holmes and Watson are dining in a restaurant and reading of Ann Brandon's marriage to Jerrold Hunter, Holmes begins to pluck at a fiddle to find the note that will annoy the flies and make them leave. Watson demonstrates to Holmes the better way to eliminate fliesWHACK! with a newspaper.\n\nThis ending was not in the original script for the film. The first ending features a scene in Inspector Bristol's office, in which Mateo (the murderous Indian with the bolas) explains why he tried to kill Miss Brandon. He claims that Miss Brandon's father killed his father years ago, and stole the mine that made the Brandon family rich. Mateo swore vengeance against Brandon and his family. (One wonders what Moriarty had to do with this.) While this scene does tie up some loose ends, director Alfred Werker felt the lengthy explanatory scene was too anticlimactic and replaced it in the final edit with the shorter restaurant scene.\n\nThe success of The Hound of the Baskervilles as brought to the screen by 20th Century-Fox induced the studio to plan a series of Sherlock Holmes pictures, with Basil Rathbone in the role of the famous detective and Nigel Bruce as Dr. Watson. The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes, taken from the William Gillette play, is the second in the series. In a surprising move after the success of The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes, 20th Century-Fox decided not to produce more Holmes films. According to Scarlet Street editor Richard Valley, the Conan Doyle estate was displeased with The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes, and as a result, demanded that the studio adapt the original tales instead of using non-Canonical tales. 20th Century-Fox was unwilling to agree to these demands; thus the plan for a series of Holmes films was shelved. (See Scarlet Street, No. 13, Winter 1994, p. 33.)\n\nAbout two years later Universal Studios acquired the film rights to the Sherlock Holmes stories, and Universal placed Basil Rathbone, Nigel Bruce and Mary Gordon (Mrs. Hudson) under contract for four years.\n\nThe Adventures of Sherlock Holmes began filming on June 3, 1939, immediately upon completion of The Hound of the Baskervilles.\n\nAccording to Rathbone's contract with 20th Century Fox (signed October 25, 1938), he was paid $5000 per week to play Sherlock Holmes in The Hound of the Baskervilles and The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes.\n\nBasil Rathbone is again superlative in the role of Sherlock Holmes, infusing the detective with the color, mystery and genius which have made the character a byword all over the world.\n\nNigel Bruce likewise is outstanding in the same character he portrayed in The Hound of the Baskervillesthe grumpy, lovable and sometimes blundering confidant of the master criminologist.\n\nGeorge Zucco also appeared as Richard Stanley in Sherlock Holmes in Washington. In 1920 Zucco joined the New Shakespeare Company in Stratford upon Avonthe same acting company that Basil Rathbone had been in earlier. By 1920 Rathbone was no longer with the company.\n\nHolmes Herbert, who played the Justice of the Court in the opening scene, appeared in several other Sherlock Holmes films: Sherlock Holmes and the Secret Weapon, The Pearl of Death, Sherlock Holmes in Washington, The House of Fear, and Dressed to Kill.\n\nArthur Hohl (Bassick) was also in The Scarlet Claw (Emile Journet) and The Spider Woman (Adam Gilflower).\n\nThe Exhibitor (June 21, 1939) and Variety (July 26, 1939) both list Lionel Atwill as one of the cast, right after Terry Kilburn, who played Billy. George Zucco's name is further down the cast list, indicating that he had a smaller part. It seems likely that Lionel Atwill was the studio's first choice to play Professor Moriarty. For some unknown reason, he couldn't do it (probably a schedule conflict), and George Zucco was then given the part.\n\nThis was one of Ida Lupino's early films, and her performance was superb. She went on to earn fame not only as an accomplished actress, but also as a director, producer and screenwriter. According to a Scarlet Street interview (issue #13, p. 48), Lupino had fun during the filming of The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes and liked to call her co-star \"Basil Bathrug.\"\n\nIn another Scarlet Street interview, Terry Kilburn said, \"[Basil Rathbone] was a great gentleman and an extremely pleasant person. Everybody liked him very much. Of course, in those days, he was more famous for playing villains, and he couldn't have been more different. He was a gentle and really very charming man, and he was indeed very, very well liked by everybody.\" (See Scarlet Street, No. 13, p. 53.)\n\n.\n\nNigel Bruce wrote the following in his memoirs:\n\n(posted on the Scarlet Street forums)\n\nMiss Brandon consults Holmes about a garden party.\n\nNigel Bruce, Ida Lupino, Basil Rathbone, and Henry Stephenson\n\nAbout Nigel Bruce, Basil Rathbone wrote: \"There is no question in my mind that Nigel Bruce was the ideal Dr. Watson, not only of his time but possibly of and for all time. There was an endearing quality to his performance that to a very large extent, I believe, humanized the relationship between Dr. Watson and Mr. Holmes.\" (In and out of Character, p. 181)\n\n\"Rathbone and Bruce were fine as the Baker Street residents.\" Michael B. Druxman, Basil Rathbone: His Life and His Films\n\n\"The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes is in so many ways a superior film that to criticize it seems carping. Yet Moriarty's grand scheme is so complicated and unwieldy that it is embarrassing to see it almost work.\" Chris Steinbrunner and Norman Michaels, The Films of Sherlock Holmes\n\n\"Amusing, exciting, and faithful to the traditions established by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle.\" Elsie Finn, Philadelphia Record, August 26, 1939\n\n\"Basil Rathbone outshines his previous performance in Hound of the Baskervilles. With this second picture, it looks as if the series will prove to be well established. It is clever and the suspense holds up effectively throughout the picture.\" The Los Angeles Times, August 24, 1939\n\n\"Basil Rathbone and Nigel Bruce, repeating in their respective Holmes-Watson roles, are excellent in type and delivery.\" Box Office, August 26, 1939\n\nBasil Rathbone singing \"I Do Like to Be Beside the Seaside\"\n\nSee more pictures and reviews on Page Two.\n\nSee Posters, Lobby Cards and Promo Photos on page 3.\n\n.\n\nImages on this page, Page Two and Page Three are from the film The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes, copyright 20th Century Fox."
