        "text": "Let me tell you a little story about trying to get a wooden sign made for one of my clients. üôÑ Because y'all...it was a JOURNEY. It was a simple wooden sign for Shawn Vieth's flower cart, and I wanted to make sure my client had it before this past weekend. And I thought it would be easy. I called a sign maker I knew. He wasn't able to help. I called a person he referred. He said he miiiiight be able to help‚Äîand then sat on the request for weeks before telling me he couldn't help me. I was running out of time, and then a thought popped in my head: Etsy. A day later, an Etsy vendor and wooden sign-maker from Utah was able to confirm that yes, he'd be able to help me. My client immediately ordered three identical signs. Why am I telling this story? Two reasons, actually: ‚úîÔ∏è The creative industry is a bunch of small businesses that are all links on a chain. If one link breaks, it's hard for others to operate, too. ‚úîÔ∏è Etsy is an untapped resource for creative needs. In my research, I was amazed at how many vendors were offering templates and other resources.

Thanks for the large caller summation to my bureau space, Igor!!\" ‚Äîd r Get it from Enjoy The Wood from Amazon Handmade for $49.99+ (available successful 5 colors and 5 sizes). #innovation - #management - #technology - #creativity - #futurism - #startups\n\nA warm cozy post totally unrelated to GenAI, but equally magical to me ü•∞ Back when I was 14, I really wanted to be a toy designer so I taught myself how to crochet via YouTube, and then progressed to learning how to design stuffed animals, launching the first three at 17 (the duck, then dragon, then fox). I never turned it into a business because back then I had no idea, and also I was too stressed about getting carpal tunnel after noticing my wrists starting to hurt after making so many! First time making all three together again in over a decade! üêâüê•ü¶ä For those of you interested, here's a super geeky list of technical things that brought a silly amount of joy (upgrades to the original patterns): üé® The complimentary colours, especially that gorgeous electric blue scarf on the yellow duck, just eep. Yayy colour theory (and yarn options). üëÄ The french knot eyes of the duck (make a loop of yarn, thread the needle, wrap yarn around several times, pull back through the loop and pull tight). ü™° Sewing the noses and bellies by weaving between the stitches instead of the typical blanket stitch. This leaves the raw outside edge exposed which looks so crisp and neat (perfectly circular nose circles on the dragon for example). üåÄ Spiral pattern on the dragon's wings and foxes feet and arms. This is my favourite, and is done by crocheting into the front loops only, so the back loops leave a spiral line that looks stunnnnning. ü•∑ Seamless join. I used a gazillion pins to line up limbs and noses before sewing them very precisely through existing crochet holes so that they look seamless. Every now and then I need to go offline and make stuff with my hands. This was so much joy ü•∞ü§©üòÑ (finding the right emojis for that list was also joy ü§£) #amigurumi #crochet #throwback #crafts #handmade"
