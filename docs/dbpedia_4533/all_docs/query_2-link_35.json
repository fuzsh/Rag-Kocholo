Making the yuletide gay since 2018, this glorious collaboration from two of RuPaul's DragRace's most glittering alumni is the perfect tonic for the hysteria of the holiday season, with boozy holiday cheer infused with good old razzle-dazzle song and dance numbers, copious amounts of eggnog and classic carols with a cheeky drag twist. If you're Nutcracker-phobic then this double act has your alternative holiday entertainment sorted, Jinkx will spice things up and Dela will cover them in sugar!\n\nYou may know him from his hilarious farm chore videos on Tik Tok or his series 'Confessions with Matt', but here's your chance to see him live and in person as Matt Mathews steps off the farm and onto the stage on his first-ever live tour!
