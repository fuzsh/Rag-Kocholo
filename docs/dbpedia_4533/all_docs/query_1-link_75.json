When it comes to superior Sherlocks, Brett stands at the head of the class, but it's a crowded field.\n\nMore than 100 actors have played Holmes on screen over a span of more than 100 years. Since the first known movie version in 1905, there have been more than 250 films featuring Holmes. That doesn't count the dozens upon dozens of TV episodes featuring everyone from Ronald Howard in the 1950s to Brett in the '80s and '90s to today's prime-time Sherlocks,\n\nand Jonny Lee Miller on CBS.\n\nThat's good enough for the Guinness World Records, which gives Holmes the title of\n\nHere's a quick trip through Holmesian history with 33 notable screen Sherlocks:\n\nWilliam Gillette --\n\nThe American actor was the first great interpreter of Holmes, having played the detective in a Doyle-authorized stage play since 1899. A 1916 film version was long thought to be lost. It was announced a month ago that a copy found in France is being restored and will get an American premiere next year.\n\nEille Norwood --\n\nThe British actor played Holmes in 47 silent films made over a two-year span starting in 1921. His Sherlock run included 45 short subjects and two features: \"The Hound of the Baskervilles\" (1921) and \"The Sign of the Four\" (1923).\n\nJohn Barrymore --\n\nThe Great Profile played the great detective in a 1922 silent film that featured Roland Young (\"Topper\") as Watson and a young William Powell (the future star of \"The Thin Man\" making his screen debut).\n\nClive Brook --\n\nThe British actor played Holmes in three Hollywood films: \"The Return of Sherlock Holmes\" (1929), \"Sherlock Holmes\" (1932) and \"Paramount on Parade\" (a 1930 revue that included a segment with Holmes and other detectives).\n\nRaymond Massey --\n\nThe American actor best known for playing Abraham Lincoln on stage and film in \"Abe Lincoln in Illinois\" portrayed Holmes in the 1931 British movie \"The Speckled Band.\"\n\nArthur Wontner --\n\nThe London native portrayed Holmes in five films: \"The Sleeping Cardinal\" (1931), \"The Missing Rembrandt\" (1932), \"The Sign of Four\" (1932), \"The Triumph of Sherlock Holmes\" (1935) and \"Silver Blaze\" (a 1937 release also known as \"Murder at the Baskervilles\").\n\nReginald Owen --\n\nThe British star was one of a handful of screen Sherlocks also to have played Watson.
