        "text": "Using the pseudonym Francis Iles with the 1932 crime novel Before the Fact, Anthony Berkeley Cox wrote what became the underpinning for the movie Suspicion (1941). The movie offers an interesting mixture of Alfred Hitchcock‘s perspectives of film noir, romance and psychological thriller. It’s our belief that you should watch the movie Suspicion.\n\nSuspicion establishes setting and character when eligible, handsome and financially irresponsible Johnnie Aysgarth meets Lina McLaidlaw on a train traveling in England. Johnnie aims to initiate conversation with a suspicious insult meant as a means of beginning the desire for communication. When Lina later overhears her parents mentioning that they believe Lina will never marry, she lashes out by kissing Johnnie in defiance. Cary Grant portrayed Johnnie Aysgarth. Joan Fontaine, winner of an Academy Award for the performance, portrayed Lina McLaidlaw.\n\nThe kiss to spite her parents leads to an afternoon date between Lina and Johnnie, which Johnnie cancels before vanishing. Things eventually turn around, with a proposal for marriage that Lina’s wealthy father opposes with decided strength. Cedric Hardwicke and May Whitty portrayed General McLaidlaw and Mrs. Martha McLaidlaw, parents to Lina, respectively.\n\nThis escalating romance eventually leads to the couple’s decision to elope, thus making the wealthy couple’s daughter Lina McLaidlaw Aysgarth. The story escalates into an increasingly thrilling set of actions that become decidedly film noir when the state of Johnnie’s finances come to light with the notion for how to pay for a luxurious wedding and living arrangements come into focus. The selling of family heirlooms to cover gambling debts are simply the beginning.\n\nThings get deeper when a financial ambitions, including financial shenanigans that eventually escalate to confirm that a desperate times can call for desperate measures. Lina perceives a confidence play on a land deal between Johnnie and the good-natured Gordon Cochrane ‘Beaky’ Thwaite. Things really get elevate after Beaky travels to Paris, France. Nigel Bruce portrayed ‘Beaky’ Thwaite, and unwittingly points to some fascinating suspense for how the film ultimately resolves itself.\n\nThe intrigue throughout Suspicion resonates with me, 90-years after the book and 81-years after the movie. What will become of the romantic couple? Are the looks that are legitimate and suspect really what is about to happen? Is there even a chance that the truth isn’t what we suspect? That these are the questions leads to my granting Suspicion as directed by Alfred Hitchcock 4-stars on a scale of 1-to-5.\n\nMatt – Saturday, June 4, 2022"
