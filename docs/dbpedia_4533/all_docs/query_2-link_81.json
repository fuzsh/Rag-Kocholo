        "text": "One of the Vanderploonk triplets and a neighborhood friend of Edwina. He is incredibly accident-prone and twists his ankle in the first scene. Lars has many prat falls before he actually twists his ankle. Casting an actor with good physical comedy skills would be helpful (always remember that any staged fall or injury should be carefully choreographed and rehearsed to prevent a real injury. Safety first!). You may want to consider having Lars return to the stage a little while after his injury in a wheelchair, a cast or leg brace, or on crutches. This adds to the comedy of the play and opens up the casting of Lars for the actor who wants to be in your show so badly but isn't exactly Baryshnikov.\n\nOne of the 'letter readers' in The Dear Edwina Show. They each have vocal solos (aside from the Marching Band, who only sing backup vocals) whereby they explain their dilemmas in hopes of receiving Edwina's advice. Consider casting these roles from your ensemble or you can have any of the other characters above perform one of the roles.\n\nOne of the 'letter readers' in The Dear Edwina Show.

Johnny and The Queen act out the story in the lyrics. They are not required to sing, but to merely speak in rhythm during the song. Be sure you cast someone who can 'feel the beat.'
