        "text": "LIMELIGHT again. A decent bit of stagecraft: Chaplin wants Calvero to feel he’s in the way, so he has him overhear a love scene between Terry and Neville. Since they chat on the doorstep, as young lovers have done since the doorstep was invented by Alexander Graham Doorstep, and Calvero has passed out inside the door, it works quite naturally (although I had assumed that he was leaning against the door of his own room, not the lodging house’s front door, but there’s the letterbox — invented by Thomas Alva letterbox — so I was mistaken).\n\nThe next day, Calvero tells her she’s wasting her youth on him — the noble bit. Good composition with old CC in foreground and young CC in picture on wall in bg. There’s rather a lot of mantelpiece posing in this scene, though, which adds to its staginess.\n\nI feel like young Chaplin, who thought in gags, could have made a feature film where a third of the action happens in a single lodging house. He made entire short films confined to single spaces, or nearly so. Old Chaplin does not have the skill set to make a movie come alive with just a couple of characters in a single space, especially without gags. There is some decent subtle camera movement in this scene, but the atmosphere is the opposite of fraught. It’s all too poised.\n\nScene with Norman Lloyd and Nigel Bruce. NB is dissatisfied with Calvero’s clowning and has asked the agency to send a replacement. “I don’t care if he’s Calvero himself.” NL reveals Calvero’s identity (he’s been appearing incognito) and NB agrees Calvero can keep his job. This unmasking is a bit of set-up for the eventual charity performance, but it’s primary purpose is to set up the misunderstanding that follows…\n\nCalvero meets an old chum — and learns that the clown has been sent to replace him. He doesn’t know, of course, that this idea has been called off. It ought, by narrative law, to trigger a fantastic drinking spell with tragic consequences, rushing into our end scene. Instead, it causes Calvero to disappear — possibly to get drunk, we don’t know. Since he vanishes, Terry has no choice but to get on with her career — montage of foreign tours — a bit of plot seemingly borrowed from Chaplin’s real childhood sweetheart appearing in Moscow when he looked for her in London. (If Chaplin’s fixation on teenagers came from his early, thwarted passion for a girl who died young, it’s curiously reminiscent of Humber Humbert’s sentimental backstory — I’m not sure I believe it as a piece of Freudian scene-setting, though it seems to have happened, all right.)\n\nWhile Terry dances, Calvero has been busking. I wonder how much of an influence ST MARTIN’S LANE had on this film? Possibly a great deal.\n\nChance unites Neville with Calvero (as if Chaplin, feeling himself too old to get the young girl any more, must cede the role to his direct descendant, Sydney, keeping it in the family) as Neville prepares to leave for WWI. Just as the movie ought, by normal dramatic laws, be accelerating into the third act, these delaying factors crop up — Calvero’s disappearance, Terry’s tour, Neville’s enlistment.\n\n“How are you doing?” asks Neville.\n\n“Never felt better in my life,” replies Calvero, who will be dead in 29 minutes of screen time.\n\n“I don’t mind coincidence,” said Chaplin, “but I despise convenience.” But here comes Nigel Bruce again, by complete chance, to liven up a dead scene. “There’s something about working the streets I like,” says Calvero. “It’s the tramp in me I suppose.”\n\nNext scene — Terry bumps into Calvero, entirely by coincidence (though I guess she’s looking for him). Chaplin COULD have had either Postant or Neville tell her where to find her old rescuer, but he doesn’t bother to establish this. He would need to get rid of them again if he did that, I suppose. Now the prospect of the benefit show is introduced — it could have been done one scene earlier, as Postant is the natural person to propose it, but Chaplin wants a teary scene with Terry and Calvero. It’s true that the relationship stuff needs working out before we can get to the big finale —\n\nI really like Chaplin’s acting at the end of the scene, where he starts distracting himself from his tears by talking about the comedy act he’s been working on with his friend (Buster, as yet unglimpsed). “I would like a chance just to show them that, that I’m not through yet. I’ve still got ideas, you know! I’ve been working one, been working on one. A comedy act. Myself and my friend. Sort of a musical satire.”\n\n(It’s the stumbles and false starts and repetitions I like — the most naturalistic speech Chaplin ever gave onscreen, I think.)\n\n“And eh, he’s a very good pianist, and, eh, me with the violin.”\n\n“Wonderful!”\n\n“A lot of funny, really very very funny business…”\n\nWe fade out as he’s saying this, his expression suggesting he’s trying his best to persuade himself that it’s true. He looks worried, not exultant. It’s beautifully done. I don’t know if he wrote it with all those little hesitations in mind, or if they came as inspirations, or happened because he wasn’t sure of his lines, and it worked. It’s usually best to assume that anything that’s good in a film is the result of talent and bloody hard work, especially with Chaplin, but the stuff that’s best in any film is when you can’t quite believe it didn’t just happen spontaneously.\n\nTO BE CONCLUDED\n\nWith this title card, LIMELIGHT jumps ahead.\n\nNice shots in the Empire Theatre’s bar — Chaplin at his most Felliniqsque as the camera pans after various characters in relay fashion, then tracks with one demimondaine past intervening pillars. A nice bit of interplay between another woman and a dapper older gent who silently makes it clear that he’s not a prospective client.\n\nTerry is dancing in the chorus and HELLO! Here’s Norman Lloyd, doing a fine English accent. Of course I have to mention again that Norman Lloyd married Fiona and I when he was 98, and the marriage has lasted better than most unions officiated over by non-nonagenarians.\n\nI’m always touched to see Norman in anything, and usually impressed, too. Was there anything he couldn’t do?\n\nNorman played tennis with Charlie, which is probably how this casting came about — the Orson Welles connection need not be invoked. His character name, Bodalink, is interesting. A made-up name, presumably hinting at foreign roots (Norman was Jewish.) And of course this is never used to imply anything stereotypical about the character. It’s just a fact: the theatre embraces all kinds of people.\n\nCalvero plays with the buskers! This establishes his violin-playing, which will be important come the climax, and gets him onscreen for one last time with Snub Pollard and Loyal Underwood, so that’s good. This is the last time he’d work with pals from the silent era. (And we have Buster to look forward to.)\n\nCalvero is drunk. By his own estimation, this is necessary for him to be funny. It’s heavily implied that Calvero is caught in a horrible dilemma — to earn a living, and for life to be worthwhile, he needs to make people laugh, and for this to happen he needs to drink — but the drinking is killing him.\n\nThis is there in the film, but it’s not foregrounded, except in this one scene. It should be one of the main sources of tension throughout. I guess treatment of alcoholism was subject to censorship, but Chaplin’s approach here is serious enough that it shouldn’t have been a major problem. (And totally lighthearted dipsomaniacs were pretty common in American cinema…) THE LOST WEEKEND, of course, is recent enough that Chaplin would have to be careful not to tread the same ground, in the same way…\n\nThe best thing about this scene is that the sour-faced landlady (Marjorie Bennett) is also plastered, which brings out her human side. She’s an affable drunk, one of those people who should constantly be boozed up, except it’s not a good idea. She should learn to be human without the aid of artificial relaxants. But it’s fun to see her loosen up here.\n\nNice theatre scene where Calvero tells Terry that he’s scored the role of clown in her ballet. Great big wide shot. The dialogue is straight exposition but it’s neat that they sit down on a prop park bench, one scene after Calvero has bemoaned the likelihood of his ending up as a homeless drunk on a bench, and just a few scenes after we’ve seen an example of the same. Maybe it’s too obvious, but in this case it helps keep the drama alive while mere information is exchanged.\n\nReenter Sydney, now in the present tense, and enter Nigel Bruce.\n\nOne thing about Bodalink, and now Bruce’s character, the impresario Postant (another made-up name) being likeable chaps — it’s not very helpful for the drama. Calvero’s tetchy relationship with his agent is very useful, it simmers with tension and makes his predicament more intense. Because the director and producer of this show are such thoroughly decent chaps, very little imperils our protags’ happiness, and what little tension there is gets dissipated without it ever eventuating into a real SCENE. It also stops these very capable actors from doing anything very entertaining.\n\nTerry’s successful audition ends with a dramatic track-in on Calvero (a device used more here than in any other Chaplin film), along with a couple of nice lighting changes in the theatre, which seems to indicate that he sees her potential success as something that will doom their relationship — on the other hand, Calvero will work hard to persuade Terry, and us, that the relationship is a mere friendship. So maybe he KNOWS he’s in love with her, but doesn’t intend to do anything about it — he only hopes to maintain the status quo.\n\nThe dissolve from the haunted face to an empty frame is very nice. And it’s not even a scene change, really: we’re still in the theatre. This kind of slightly awkward continuity entered Chaplin’s cinema in MONSIEUR VERDOUX — he lacks the knack for compressing everything into continuous bits of action separated by changes of locale, so he’s forced to pull off time-jumps within his sets. But here it’s rather lovely, and the fact that Terry has had time to get changed while Calvero is just sitting and brooding makes a point about his state of mind.\n\nTO BE CONTINUED\n\nTHIS ABOVE ALL turns up, unnamed, as a reference in Anthony Burgess’s novel of Excalibur, Any Old Iron, which is what got me thinking about it. And then the idea of doing something on Anatole Litvak came up, and the two things dovetailed.\n\n(The novel also features a US serviceman turned novelist called Irwin Roth, who seems to be a nasty joint portrait of Irwin Shaw and Philip Roth. Oddly, Shaw was a writer for Litvak: he authored the source play OUT OF THE FOG derives from, and later co-scripted ACT OF LOVE. This started me wondering if Burgess, who did a lot of writing on unfilmed movies, ever brushed up against Litvak. Actually, this story is a bit like ACT OF LOVE, pitting love against war, but without any of the bite.)\n\nTHIS ABOVE ALL features, asides from the elaborate studio recreations of the blitz which Burgess remarks upon, some good atmospheric blackout stuff at the start. The romance seems interesting, but then the film goes on, and on… Ty Power, of course, is playing it American, despite his character being English. He has PTSD and is a deserter, an interesting set-up for a propaganda film. I’m assuming it was conceived and shot before Pearl Harbour, so it’s allowed to be pro-Britain but a bit anti-war. Power’s problems have potential, but only come up intermittently: everything kind of drags on. Wartime movies usually bring a tear to my eye: I’m easy. This felt like watching Paul Muni shove a piano up a hill.\n\nJoan Fontaine has good moments, bad moments, and truly awful moments which seem more like aeons while they’re happening. At her worst, that woman could simper for England: here, she does.\n\nLitvak is seemingly at sea in this increasingly turgid morass. He tries a few zip pans, but they seem unmotivated, forced. Like trying to get a conga line going at a funeral reception. The action is far from zippy. Incredibly, the source novel is by Eric Knight, whose fast-paced hardboiled thriller You Play the Black and the Red Comes Up would have made a far better subject for this director. Knight also write Lassie Come Home. This one is tonally stranded in no man’s land between the two, a strange place to be. R.C. Sherriff, the poet laureate of Hollywood England, doesn’t seem to have found a workable cinematic structure in his adaptation.\n\nActors keep turning up, people we like. Thomas Mitchell, speaking truth to Power, essays a gratuitous Scottish accent, which is not disgraceful. It’s identifiably East coast, though it wanders up and down the shoreline a bit. Nigel Bruce does something rustic. You need these guys around because the central couple aren’t doing it. Whenever they were alone together after the half-hour mark, we prayed for an interloper to interlope them.\n\nTHIS ABOVE ALL stars Leonard Vole; Mrs. de Winter; Uncle Billy; Lord Willoughby; Doctor Watson; Mrs. Higgins; Professor Sorel; Mrs. Midget; Woodrow Wilson; Ethel Rogers; High Sheriff of Nottingham; Claire Lennartz; Dr. John Lanyon; Reverend Cyril Playfair; Inspector Lestrade; Old Tom; Leuwen Grayle; Uncle Arn; California Carlson; and Dai Bando."
