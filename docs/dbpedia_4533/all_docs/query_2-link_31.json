        "text": "So you've binge watched \"America's Sweethearts\" and are left wondering what the talented members of the Dallas Cheerleaders squad are up to these days, huh? We totally get it.\n\nSince the Netflix docuseries debuted in June, it's captivated viewers and sparked online debates.\n\nWith training camp for the 2024 season already underway, we're taking a look at what some of the stars of the docuseries have been up to since filming wrapped.\n\nKelcey Wetterberg\n\nKelcey Wetterberg, a five-year veteran and first-group leader, is featured prominently in \"America's Sweethearts.\" Off the field, she's seen working as a pediatric nurse and getting engaged to her longtime boyfriend, Nate Crnkovich.\n\nAt the end of the docuseries, Wetterberg announces that she won't be auditioning for another season. However, her Dallas Cowboys cheerleaders journey isn't really over.\n\nIn a follow up interview with Netflix, she notes that she's \"retired\" as a regular squad member but will still be involved in a new capacity.\n\n\"I actually am gonna come back as an All Star next year, which (means) you keep your uniform and do (a) performance here and there. But I'm excited for that,\" Wetterberg said, adding that she'd \"love to get into coaching or a little bit more performance in the dance world\" one day.\n\nWetterberg also continues to work as a nurse and is busy planning her wedding, which will take place this year.\n\nWhile appearing on TODAY on the Fourth of July, she said it was \"hard at first\" to show her personal life on TV.\n\n\"We wanted to lead with vulnerability because vulnerability is so beautiful and there's so much more to us than what's on the outside. So we all really tried to go 100% in,\" she said.\n\nReece Weaver\n\nIn \"America's Sweethearts,\" Reece Weaver auditions for the Dallas Cowboys cheerleaders and becomes a new member of the squad.\n\nAs a \"rookie,\" she experiences the intense training schedule for the first time and adjusts to living in a new state with her fiancé, Will Allman. The couple first met at the University of Alabama and got engaged in 2023.\n\nWhile appearing on TODAY in July 2024, Weaver revealed that she's currently going through the same training camp as she did last year and hoping to be a member of the cheer squad again for the 2024 season.\n\n“This past year has been incredible. I’ve been so blessed to have the best teammates ever and (am) excited for hopefully another season,” she said.\n\nWeaver also opened up about the pressure to up the ante now that she's auditioning for her second year on the squad.\n\n\"You have to not become complacent. And you have all this amazing talent coming in and it's so inspiring. But we also want to keep that standard,\" she said.\n\nVIctoria Kalina\n\nCheerleading is in Victoria Kalina's blood. After all, her mother was part of the Dallas Cowboys cheerleaders squad in 1989.\n\nThroughout the docuseries, Kalina shares her experience as a fourth-year veteran, auditions for another year and reveals that she'd like to be a group leader.\n\nKalina also gets personal, opening up about the body image struggles and an eating disorder she experienced during her time on the squad. At one point, she calls her \"dream\" of being on the squad \"the thing that hurts me.\"\n\nAt the end of the series, Kalina reveals that she won't be auditioning for another season. In a follow up interview with Netflix, she announced that she was pursuing new opportunities in New York and said she hopes her move \"will open so many more doors.\"\n\n\"There are so many opportunities up there, whether it’s (the) Radio City Rockettes, which I would absolutely love to keep kicking with those legs. They are not done kicking,\" she said. \"I know there's Broadway up there, theater. Whatever aspect it is, I know my performance tank is not empty. I still have so much to give.\"\n\nWhile talking with Glamour, Kalina said she's excited to embark on the next phase of her life.\n\n“I feel like since I went straight from high school to the Cowboys, this is my time that I’m finally going away for college, but for life now,” she said. “It’s definitely going to be different, but I seriously cannot wait.”\n\nKalina is also excited to have more time to date and make conncetions.\n\n“DCC is so time consuming, where I didn’t want to put that effort into dating when I was a cheerleader because you just never knew when an appearance would come up or when a special show would come up,” she said. “So my whole life I ‘dated’ DCC. I’m excited to find that time in my new routine, new schedule, new life in New York City to go out with girls, to go out and about and meet some people.\"\n\nCharly Barby\n\nFor many viewers, one of the hardest moments to watch during the docuseries occurred when Charly Barby got cut from the last round of training camp. The rookie hopeful's dedication was evident, but coaches felt that she had a bit more work to do before she was ready to join the squad.\n\nThe Arizona State University alum graduated in May 2023 with a bachelor of science in communications and a minor in media analysis.\n\nAfter she was cut from training camp, Barby shared a video montage of herself practicing for the squad. She captioned it with an uplifting message about her experience, calling it \"the most challenging, rewarding & amazing process I have ever had the chance to be a part of.\"\n\nBarby continued in the caption that she was \"so honored\" to be a part of training camp and met \"the most incredible, kind & genuine group of people and grew so incredibly close in such a short time.\"\n\nThroughout her training camp experience, Barby said she grew \"not only as a dancer, but as a person\" and called it \"the experience of a life time.\" She also vowed to try out again for the 2024 season.\n\nOver the last year, Barby has posted several photos and videos from her travels. The Dallas Cowboys cheerleaders Instagram page also listed her as one of their 2024 rookie candidates in late June 2024.\n\nAnna Kate Sundvold\n\nAnna Kate Sundvold had a good idea of what she was getting into when she auditioned for the Dallas Cowboys cheerleaders because her sister Caroline Sundvold had recently finished her time with the squad.\n\nThe siblings' close bond was on full display throughout the series, with Anna Kate Sundvold making it onto the squad as a rookie for the 2023 season. Throughout the series, Caroline Sundvold struggled with feeling aimless after her time as a cheerleader had ended.\n\nWhen Anna Kate Sundvold finished the 2023 season and received her squad ring, she shared a photo on Instagram alongside the following caption: \"Thank you @kellifinglass and @dcc_judy for giving me the opportunity of a lifetime. This season has been nothing but a dream and I am so fortunate for all the experiences I have been able to have through @dccheerleaders! This organization has brought me some of my closest friends and I am grateful for all the memories.\"\n\nAnna Kate Sundvold appears to be trying out for the squad once again and recently appeared to be auditioning in a joint Instagram post with the Dallas Cowboys cheerleaders.\n\nSophy Laufer\n\n\"America's Sweethearts\" was filmed during Sophy Laufer's second year on the cheerleading squad. During the season, she was featured prominently when a photographer allegedly touched her inappropriately while she was dancing on the field during a game.\n\nLaufer spoke with police but they later found that there wasn't enough on-camera evidence to charge the photographer with any crime.\n\nLaufer's Dallas Cowboys cheerleader bio describes her as a dance instructor and lists why she decided to audition for the squad.\n\n“After my senior year in high school, the DCC recruiter reached out to me on my social media, and after talking to her, I was ready to make my dream of becoming a DCC a reality,” she said.\n\nLaufer appears to be chasing another season with the squad and recently appeared to be auditioning in a joint Instagram post with the Dallas Cowboys cheerleaders.\n\nIn July, Laufer traveled to New York City to appear on TODAY alongside her fellow members of the squad."
