        "text": "This story is available exclusively to Business Insider subscribers. Become an Insider and start reading now. Have an account? .\n\n\"Bring It On\" premiered 22 years ago and, since then, the teen flick has inspired 5 sequels.\n\nEven avid fans may not have caught all these details and hidden gems throughout the 2000s rom-com.\n\nTorrance's room is filled with fun trinkets and posters visible in the background of some scenes.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTorrance drove at least two hours to break up with Aaron in person.\n\nThe college that Aaron goes to, California State University Dominguez Hills, is actually a real school. The university has a cheer squad too, so Torrance would have been able to continue her cheerleading career if she followed him there.\n\nHowever, since \"Bring It On\" takes place in San Diego, Torrance potentially lives about two hours from the college, so her decision to drive there just to break up with Aaron seems to require a lot of dedication.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCourtney and Whitney have matching backpacks.\n\nWhen Aaron drops Torrance off at school, Courtney and Whitney are sporting matching blue backpacks.\n\nWe don't see the other cheerleaders wearing them, which seems to indicate that Courtney and Whitney chose to coordinate their bags on their own.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe cheerleading murder plot Torrance mentions actually (sort of) happened.\n\nAfter Torrance's mother berates her for spending more time cheering than studying, Torrance comments that some mothers have killed to get their daughters on cheer squads.\n\nHer mom's quick reply that the mother in question \"didn't kill anyone\" and, instead, just \"hired a hit man\" seems like a dark throwaway joke, but this comment could be referring to a real-life true-crime incident that occurred a few years before the movie was filmed.\n\nIn 1991, a Texas woman was convicted of solicitation of capital murder for attempting to hire a hit man to kill the mother of her daughter's cheer rival, the Los Angeles Times reported.\n\nThis case later inspired a made-for-TV movie called \"Willing to Kill: The Texas Cheerleader Story\" (1992).\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe lyrics to Rancho Carne High's school song are hanging in the gym.\n\nTorrance and her cheer team attend Rancho Carne High School. The school name and mascot were made up for the movie, but details and decorations in the background make it feel more realistic.\n\nThe most noticeable example of this may be the Toros decals and stuffed mascots that can be seen throughout the movie, but viewers can also catch a glimpse of Rancho Carne's alma mater (the school song) written out on a board in the gym.\n\nSome of the made-up lyrics read, \"Rancho Carne High/We pledge our loyalty/Our alma mater's pride/Lives on in victory!\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe banners in the gym are hung in a seemingly random order.\n\nLike many real high schools, Rancho Carne High has several banners hanging in the gym indicating the years that different sports teams placed at state competitions.\n\nHowever, the banners don't seem to be in any easily recognizable order.\n\nInstead of being hung chronologically, there are banners from 1999, 1980, and 1956 all next to each other. There also appear to be some identical banners for 1999 and 1956 that appear at least twice in the same row.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe actor who played \"Ballet Boy\" is a professional choreographer.\n\nDuring the cheer tryout scene, one student performs an elaborate ballet routine. The actor, Brandon Henschel, is credited as \"Ballet Boy,\" and he also went on to appear as a dancer in \"Bring It On: Fight to the Finish\" (2009).\n\nHenschel's dance moves during the scene look quite polished, which makes sense since he's actually a professional choreographer who's trained in multiple styles of dance.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOne girl loses her shirt during cheerleading tryouts.\n\nOne of the girls who tries out for the cheerleading team does an elaborate dance to Warrant's \"Cherry Pie,\" which reportedly cost producers $40,000 to license.\n\nWhile she's standing on the gym floor at the beginning of her tryout, she's wearing a colorful halter-neck shirt. But when she proceeds to dance on a table, she's almost instantly wearing a bright-purple bikini top that she seemingly had on underneath.\n\nWe never see her remove her top, so it seems like more of a continuity issue, but it also may have been purposefully cut to avoid raising the film's content rating.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMissy's fake tattoo in \"Bring It On\" looks similar to the one actress Eliza Dushku wears in another role.\n\nEliza Dushku starred on 20 episodes of The WB's \"Buffy the Vampire Slayer,\" many of which aired just before \"Bring It On\" was released.\n\nDushku's first appears as Missy in \"Bring It On\" during cheer tryouts, where she cheekily wipes away her temporary tattoo with her middle finger.\n\n\"Buffy\" fans may recognize the ink since it looks a lot like the one Dushku's TV character Faith has.\n\nWhether or not Dushku actually brought one of her own Faith tattoos to the set of \"Bring It On,\" the actress did tell Entertainment Weekly in 2015 that fans always reenact the tattoo smear for her.\n\n\"People do the middle-finger tattoo smear, which is odd because they're giving me the finger,\" she said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMissy seems to pull her cheer application out of nowhere.\n\nWhen Missy walks into the gym, she isn't holding anything. We can also clearly see that she doesn't have anything in her hands when she wipes her fake tattoo away.\n\nHowever, seconds later, when she is asked for her application papers, she holds them up as if they materialized out of thin air.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTorrance has a lot of interesting decorations in her bedroom.\n\nWhen Torrance's bedroom is first shown at the beginning of the movie, viewers can see a lot of paraphernalia featuring her school's mascot, the Toros, behind her bed. This includes a Toros stuffed toy, Toros stickers, and a ribbon that could be from a previous Toros' cheer win.\n\nTorrance also has a ton of characters from \"The Wizard of Oz\" sitting on a shelf, including Dorothy, the Lion, the Scarecrow, the Tin Man, and Glinda.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThere's a \"Don't Quit\" sign in the background when Torrance thinks about quitting her role as cheer captain.\n\nAfter the squad embarrassed themselves at the regional cheer competition, Torrance considers stepping down from her role as captain.\n\nShe thinks this over as she listens to the tape Cliff made her and goes from moodily lying on her bed to cheerfully dancing on it — which was apparently improvised by actress Kirsten Dunst.\n\nOnce Torrance is up on the bed, the camera has zoomed out enough to reveal an ironic \"Don't Quit\" sign on her bedroom wall. This subtly foreshadows the next scene, in which Torrance announces that she refuses to give up her position as captain.\n\nBonus: This scene is one of the few moments from the movie that were recreated in Ariana Grande's \"Thank U, Next\" music video in 2019.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCourtney wears the same shorts in two different scenes.\n\nCourtney dons a pair of white shorts with a floral print in two different scenes of the movie.\n\nShe wears them with a red sports bra during the first cheer practice, and she's seen in them again, this time with a blue shirt, while trying to take over as cheer captain.\n\nThis wouldn't exactly be an odd occurrence for a real high-school student, but it's not something rom-com fans see often.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTorrance seems to have a signature necklace.\n\nTorrance is first seen wearing her blue, beaded choker necklace when Aaron picks her up for school at the beginning of the movie. Later on, she wears the same necklace while asking her dad to help raise money for the Clovers to go to nationals.\n\nOther characters have consistent accessories throughout the movie as well, such as Cliff, who wears the same watch and necklace in multiple scenes.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCliff and Missy's parents are never shown.\n\nDespite there being multiple scenes set in Cliff and Missy's large house, their parents are never shown.\n\nThe only mention of them seems to be when Missy tells Torrance that her parents are staying out late at a benefit. This explains why they aren't shown during the sleepover scenes that night, but their parents are never at the house at any other point in the film either.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Clovers and the Toros are the only cheer teams at nationals with midriff-revealing uniforms.\n\nThe scenes at nationals show dozens, if not hundreds, of cheerleaders in the background practicing and performing their routines.\n\nSome of the teams shown have sleeveless uniforms while others have long-sleeved ones, but none of the background teams seem to have uniforms that show their stomachs — making the Clovers and the Toros the only cheerleaders with visible midriffs.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe name of the cheer association changes slightly throughout the film.\n\nThe banners at nationals read, \"Universal Cheer Association Nationals,\" which is also how the event is subtitled on the screen during the film.\n\nHowever, when the Clovers receive their prize money, the check is from the \"Universal Cheerleading Association.\"\n\nIt's only a subtle change in the film, but both of the iterations of the name are made up. There is, however, a real-life global cheer group called the Universal Cheerleaders Association.\n\nRead More:\n\nRead next\n\ndetails you missed Movie Movies\n\nAdvertisement"
