        "text": "Since 2018, the Premier US National All Girl Team has fallen short to Team Finland at the ICU World Cheerleading Championships. In this six-episode limited series, REDEMPTION: USA Cheer vs. The World, we follow the team from its inception to the 2023 ICU World Cheerleading Championship. The team is on their journey to take back the gold medal, and it is not an easy road.\n\nThis film shows cheerleading on a whole other level. I am obsessed!! -Maddy Brum, Netflix CHEER Season 2\n\nIn this documentary, you can expect the raw, unfiltered, and true version of what the training experience is like for the athletes and coaches. Every cheerleader responds differently when they hear \"cheerleading isn't a sport\" but for these girls, they prove that cheerleaders are athletes too.\n\nTo be the best in the world at something, it doesn't come with ease. Many are used to seeing the US National Teams take the mat with excellence, but it did not start out that way. The journey ahead after naming the team is a challenging one, and only the mentally strong will survive.\n\nBuckle Up for an emotional roller coaster; this shows the true dedication of blood, sweat, and tears! -Morgan Simianer, Netflix CHEER\n\nBeing put on mat in the beginning of training does not solidify your position through the end. Changes are made only days before taking the mat, and the coaches have tough decisions to make to ensure that the right combination take the floor at ICU in Orlando. Let's meet some of the characters in REDEMPTION: USA Cheer vs. The World.\n\nHead coach Tony Nash is one of the best cheerleading coaches in the world, and he even was a part of innovating cheerleading in the United States. But what many do not know is that Tony is facing a medical battle that puts life into perspective for him and his family. Tony is not only a coach, but a dedicated father and husband whose main focus in life is to be the best he can be for his family. While searching for redemption on the mat, he is also searching for answers when it comes to his health.\n\nMark Coleman, head coach of Morehead State University, is a mentor coach for Team Finland. Mark also has athletes on the USA All Girl team that cheer for him at Morehead. This seems to be a conflict of interest for Tony and his team.\n\nMadelyn is from the University of West Georgia and the USA Cheer training process is pretty tough on her both physically and mentally. Madelyn is also facing challenges outside of cheer, and something happens right before Finals at ICU in 2022 that could take over her whole demeanor.\n\nJourney is a powerhouse athlete, but even the best of the best face tough challenges. Journey's back is a constant struggle for her, and ultimately it affects her ability to be able to compete. This results in a chain reaction of events for the team at the 2022 ICU World Cheerleading Championship.\n\nYou will learn that USA All Girl assistant coach, Asia, was also an athlete on the team before becoming a coach. Her first year in 2018 was the first time the team did not win a Gold medal. Asia has never won Gold before, so her will to win is at an all time high.\n\nAssistant coach, Lindsey, was also an athlete on the team before becoming a coach. But Lindsey has won a Gold medal before, so she knows what it feels like for all of your hard work to be worth it. She is determined to help the team get back to the top where they belong.\n\nCora never imagined herself on a team like USA. From being an alternate, to the opportunity to compete, big dreams come true for this NC State athlete.\n\nBlake isn't just the teams' choreographer, but a close friend of head coach Tony. Blake is close to Tony's family and ultimately helped Tony get through a tough stage of his life.\n\nPaige and Michaiah are two strong leaders and exceptional athletes. They help hold the team together through tough practices, not just by their words, but by their actions. They may be teammates on USA, but in the college world of cheerleading they are rivals!\n\nWatch REDEMPTION: USA Cheer Vs The World on FloCheer July 4th for FREE.
