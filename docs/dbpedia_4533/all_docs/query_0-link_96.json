        "text": "The Film Noir Odyssey\n\nWriter: Thomas Job\n\nBased on the play by Martin Vale\n\nDirector: Peter Godfrey\n\nCast: Humphrey Bogart, Barbara Stanwyck, Alexis Smith, Ann Carter, Nigel Bruce\n\nCinematography: J. Peverell Marley\n\nMusic: Franz Waxman\n\nStudio: Warner Bros.\n\nRelease: March 4, 1947\n\n“The Two Mrs. Carrolls” is unusual in how terrible it is.\n\nUsually when I don’t like a movie, I can pinpoint a few parts of the production which caused the awfulness. But this is one of… perhaps the only?… time during this entire Odyssey when I have seen so many otherwise-competent filmmakers collectively shit the bed.\n\nThe plot concerns a tortured artist named Geoffrey (Humphrey Bogart) who, while vacationing in Scotland, falls head over heels for Sally (Barbara Stanwyck). The only problem is that he’s already got a wife and daughter Beatrice (Ann Carter) at home. So he buys poison from a local chemist (Barry Bernard) under an assumed named and kills his wife by administering the poison in her milk. Then he marries Sally, moves into her idyllic English country estate… and begins lusting after family-friend-twice-removed Cecily (Alexis Smith). And thus the cycle begins again. But will Sally figure it out in time to stop another murder from taking place… her own?\n\nIf you are reading that and thinking that it sounds eerily similar to noir films “Gaslight” and “Suspicion,” you would be correct. This is a blatant rip-off, but without the technical prowess of “Suspicion” or the emotional trauma of “Gaslight.” There’s even a motherfucking glass of poisoned milk delivered by the husband! I’m surprised it wasn’t glowing.\n\nScreenwriter Thomas Job (“Escape in the Desert”) assumes the viewer is a fool and that he has to repeat every pertinent bit of information to the plot at least three times in order for us to pick up on things. This includes small stuff, like when Geoffrey buys the poison from the chemist and uses a fake name. The Chemist repeats the fake name “Fleming” three times, each more intensely than the last… and the third is after Geoffrey leaves as he repeats the name while stroking his chin, suspicious of the name for literally no understandable reason except to make sure the audience understands that this story development will come back later.\n\nThen there are the big things, like the explanation of what Geoffrey is doing. It’s not enough that we see what he’s up to. No, we need recaps every few minutes during the second half. First Sally has a ten-minute conversation (not hyperbole) with Beatrice where the little girl handily explains everything her father was doing to his first wife and how that is being repeated now while Sally cringes in terror. But then, a few moments later, we get a scene where Sally is alone in her bedroom, haunted by voiceover of what we just heard while cringing and connecting the dots for us. But then, at the climax, Geoffrey stops just short of killing Sally and instead re-explains for four minutes (again, not hyperbole) what he is doing and why he is doing it.\n\nPlay a drinking game if you watch the film – every time information is repeated three times in dialogue, take a shot. You’ll be blacked out by the end of the third reel.\n\nThat said, to be clear, you shouldn’t watch the film.\n\nBogart and Stanwyck are grossly miscast in the lead roles, both hamming it up to a shocking extent, complete with hair-pulling, grabbing their foreheads as they struggle with something mentally and screaming for no apparent reason. It’s kind of baffling how they were both roped into such a stinker and honestly look embarrassed in certain scenes. There’s a coda where the filmmakers turn the entire proceedings into a joke (because of course they do) where Geoffrey asks the police arresting him if they want some milk, and you can all but see Bogart cringing onscreen trying to deliver the line. Smith is given nothing to do but slink around with obvious mustache twirling… why was she even cast in such a throwaway role? Carter is unfortunate playing the unfortunate clam of the little who speaks like an adult, and Nigel Bruce is also on hand to do a mustachioed version of his bumbling Doctor Watson… obviously cast because he was also in “Suspicion.”\n\nThe director is Peter Godfrey, who made the almost-good “Cry Wolf” and the almost-terrible “Woman in White.” Was he napping for the entire shoot? Or was he the guy encouraging Bogart and Stanwyck to overact? Whatever the case – how dare you, sir! His cinematographer is J. Peverell Marley, who is a good cinematographer elsewhere in movies like “Whiplash” and “Hound of the Baskervilles.” But here? Even a thunderstorm looks boring under his lens. In the entire (much too long) 100 minute running time, there is only one memorable shot – when Geoffrey breaks through the window into Sally’s room at the climax, but even that is undercut by having Geoffrey immediately start to monologue after.\n\nIt doesn’t help that the set-design is also terrible. Sally is supposed to be well off, not rich (as underlined three times in the screenplay), but we get essentially a castle for her and Geoffrey to live in… way overdesigned to the point where it’s funny. You can tell great care was taken at crafting it – all for naught. Hell, it doesn’t even shoot well, so maybe it wasn’t all Marley’s fault.\n\nDear reader, there were many, many moments where I considered turning off “The Two Mrs. Carrolls” because of its ineptitude. The only reason I made it through is to write this article. But you? You don’t have to put up with this torture. Run far, run fast… just run.\n\nScore: ½*\n\nThe Film Noir Odyssey\n\nWriter: John Van Druten, Walter Reisch and John L. Balderston\n\nBased on the play by Patrick Hamilton\n\nDirector: George Cukor\n\nCast: Ingrid Bergman, Charles Boyer, Joseph Cotton\n\nCinematography: Joseph Ruttenberg\n\nMusic: Bronislaw Kaper\n\nRelease: May 4, 1944\n\nStudio: MGM\n\nGene Tierney in “Leave Her to Heaven.”\n\nJoan Crawford in “Mildred Pierce.”\n\nBarbara Stanwyck in “Double Indemnity.”\n\nGloria Swanson in “Sunset Blvd.”\n\nIngrid Bergman in “Gaslight.”\n\nIf you were to ask me what the definitive lead female performances are in film noir, I would point you to these five roles. Bergman, who in most films gives off an air of strength and resolve, here implodes before the viewer’s eyes. “Gaslight” is perhaps the most excruciating portraits of a nervous breakdown ever put on film. I have rarely felt such righteous anger at an antagonist as I do every time I watch this masterpiece.\n\nBergman stars as Paula, niece and heir to a famous opera singer & composer who was murdered years prior. The singer owned legendary jewels that were never found after the killing. Now Paula is newly wed to Gregory (Charles Boyer), who systematically begins, well, gaslighting her… cutting her off from the outside world and all but trapping her in her home while making her feel like she’s going insane. But to what ends? Also in play is a Scotland Yard detective named Cameron (Joseph Cotton) who suspects the gaslighting and the family’s maid Nancy (Angela Lansbury), who Gregory flirts with and seems to hate Paula.\n\nThe film is an adaptation of a famous stage play (Vincent Price played the Boyer role on Broadway) and a remake of a 1940 British film. I’ve seen both, which are quite good, but they focus more on the husband. This version understands that the story is about Paula, and that she is the most interesting character. That shift in focus is what makes the movie transcendent. Near the climax of the movie, Gregory and Cameron have an intense fist fight… a battle between good and evil that we’ve seen so many times in movies like this. The difference here is that we stay with Paula, watching her react to the violence… meanwhile the men bicker and brawl off camera.\n\nThe screenplay is by John Van Druten (“One Night in Lisbon”), Walter Reisch (“The Mosquito”) and John L. Balderston (“The Mystery of Edwin Drood”), and they consistently shift their focus away from what we expect from this type of movie. There is a mystery, I guess, but instead of playing up the mystery of if Gregory is guilty, as most movies of this type would, the screenplay focuses instead on why he is doing it. There is never any question of whether he’s a mentally abusive asshole. And thank God for that.\n\nInstead, every scene and sequence after Paula and Gregory moves into the house plays like psychological warfare. Sometimes Gregory is more subtle about the abuse. Other times he just unleashes his anger, belittling Paula in any way he can. He uses the servants against her – in one cringe-inducing sequence he hides a painting then, when Paula says she didn’t take it, brings the servants in and makes them kiss the bible after saying they didn’t steal it. In another, Paula rallies enough to go to a party and he makes her have a meltdown in the middle of a piano concerto. I wanted to scream at the screen during these moments and so many others… the tension the filmmakers conjure is astonishing.\n\nIt’s also a great way to show how strong Paula is as a human. Bergman cries a lot in this movie, going to pieces multiple times. And yes, we remember those big moments. But what we also remember are those little moments where she stands her ground. Fights back. Speaks the truth even though she knows she’s about to be smacked down. She’s a fighter, which makes her easy to root for. And Bergman exceeds expectations in every moment she’s asked to push herself. It’s hard to watch, but it’s also amazing to watch.\n\nThe climactic moment is not the aforementioned battle, nor the moment Gregory attempts to attack Paula. It takes place after Gregory has been bound by the police and Paula asks for a few moments with her husband before he is hauled away. Gregory, still thinking he has some control over his wife, tells her to grab a knife in a drawer and cut him free so he can escape. This is the moment Paula takes back her power, and it is one of the most cheer-worthy moments in film history. “I can’t find the knife,” she says as she picks it up, “you must have imagined it.” She screams at him and reminds him of the thousands of ways large and small he demeaned her. She unleashes all the anger and frustration that has been building in her for a year. I have never seen the movie in a theater, but I can only imagine a standing ovation after this scene takes place. It’s that good.\n\nBergman’s performance is one for the ages, but the rest of the cast ain’t half bad either. I run hot and cold on Boyer, but he is excellent here, warping his princely persona beautifully. Cotton’s character is barely around until the third act, but he makes every one of his moments count, and his big scene where he helps pull the scales from Paula’s eyes is a stunner. This was Lansbury’s debut, and she is very good, but I have to say I’m kind of surprised about the Oscar nomination.\n\nGeorge Cukor directed, and adds another classic film to his already-stacked resume. In the history of film, no one got career-best female performances from his actors like Cukor did, and that is the case here as well. He could pull off excellent work in any genre (“The Philadelphia Story,” “My Fair Lady,” “The Women”), but made several excellent noir films, including “A Woman’s Face” and “A Double Life.” This is better than all of them.\n\nIgnore the period costumes, the regal set-design and the good-natured busybody neighbors. They may make you think this is a neutered movie. But it’s not. “Gaslight” is a savage portrait of mental abuse unparalleled in all the years since its release. It’s as potent today as it was then, and remains one of the best films of all time.\n\nScore: *****\n\nAwards: Bergman won Best Actress (also nominated: Barbara Stanwyck in “Double Indemnity”). The Film also won Best Art Direction and Interior Decoration (also nominated: “Address Unknown” and “Laura”). It was nominated for Best Picture along with “Double Indemnity” but both lost to “Going My Way.” Boyer was nominated for Best Actor but lost to Bing Crosby in “Going My Way.” Angela Lansbury was nominated for Best Supporting Actress but lost to Ethel Barrymore in “None But the Lonely Heart.” The film, along with “Double Indemnity” and “Laura,” were nominated for Best Screenplay, but lost to “Going My Way.” The film was nominated for Best Cinematography along with “Double Indemnity,” but both lost to “Laura.”\n\nThe Film Noir Odyssey\n\nWriter: Warren Duff\n\nBased on the book by Margaret Carpenter\n\nDirector: Jacques Tourneur\n\nCinematographer: Tony Gaudio\n\nMusic: Roy Webb\n\nCast: George Brent, Hedy Lamarr, Paul Lukas, Olive Blakeney\n\nRelease: December 29, 1944\n\nStudio: RKO\n\nPercent Noir: 50%\n\n“Experiment Perilous,” which was released a few months after George Cukor’s iconic “Gaslight,” tells a similar story, but makes the odd decision to switch the hero’s point-of-view away from the woman in distress and instead to a rando doctor who decides he’s going to save her. The shift damages the movie on a fundamental level, wasting two great female performances and an abundance of atmosphere on a story you really could care less about.\n\nGeorge Brent puts you to sleep as Dr. Huntington Bailey (oy.), who meets odd duck Cissie (Olive Blakeney) on a train into town one rainy night. She’s going on and on about moving out of her brother Nick’s house. Later that day, Cissie is dead but no one seems to care. Later in the week, Bailey meets Nick (Paul Lukas) in person, as well as his wife Allida (Hedy Lamarr). Nick keeps telling Bailey that Allida is crazy, but there’s more to the story than that, says anyone who has seen “Gaslight” or “Undercurrent” or “The House on Telegraph Hill” or… well… stop me before I get started.\n\nThe saddest part about “Experiment Perilous,” which has perhaps the worst title of any film I have encountered yet on my noir odyssey (with apologies to “Ride the Pink Horse”), is that it starts off brilliantly. The train (director Jacques Tourneur has a thing for trains, as anyone who has seen “Berlin Express” or “Curse of the Demon” will tell you) struggles through a full-on flood as a storm refuses to let up around it. Water cascades downhill against the train, splashing off it and into camera. We watch, weirdly nervous, as the train’s weight bends a wet wooden bridge when it drives over it. Inside, Blakeney makes an immediate, spectacular impact as Cissie, embodying the part utterly. I can see casting directors high-fiving upon finding her for the role. In just a few lines and awkward mannerisms, Blakeney becomes her character and we imprint on her, despite knowing as soon as she brings up her brother that she’s not going to make it to the third reel.\n\nThings go off the rails soon after that. Brent doesn’t have the charisma to ground the film, and from the moment the characters of Nick and Allida are introduced, we can figure out the rest of the plot, almost point for point. Lamarr is excellent as Allida and, were the circumstances different, could have easily turned in a performance rivalling Bergman in “Gaslight.” But she’s undercut at every turn by Brent and Lukas, with whom she shares zero chemistry.\n\nLukas never convinces you of any aspect of his character. He’s way too old to be paired with Lamarr, so you fundamentally don’t buy their love story despite the over-the-top romantic flashbacks to their courting. And once it’s revealed that (gasp!) he’s the bad guy, he’s never villainous enough to be menacing to the hero or the audience.\n\nBrent doesn’t do much better – his character essentially stalks Allida. He grabs her by the arm a few times to get her to stay and listen to him. He only offers her help within the context that he’ll help her because he loves her and she must love him too, which is – in most respects – just as bad as the situation Allida is already in. With a character like that, Brent already has the deck stacked against him, but it also doesn’t help when he recites exposition in a completely boring manner.\n\nBy the halfway point, it’s obvious that this should have been Allida’s story, but none of the filmmakers seem aware of this fact. If that wasn’t enough, screenwriter Warren Duff (“Appointment With Danger”) structures the movie very poorly. Cissie’s probable murder becomes an afterthought, and just when things are getting interesting he drops about 20 minutes of expressionistic flashbacks to get across information we could have gotten in a quarter-page monologue. A big deal is made about Nick and Allida’s son, but the boy barely gets a scene to make an impact. And poor Allida? Well, she is knocked out by gas poisoning for the climax, an afterthought to her own story.\n\nTourneur (“Out of the Past,” “Cat People”) is obviously a master filmmaker, and his work with cinematographer Tony Gaudio is atmospheric and beautiful. They use water throughout as a metaphor, never better than in one of the flashbacks. After being shaped and courted by Nick for years, he proposes to Allida next to a fountain. Allida stares at her reflection in the pool, then blots it out with her hand – unhappy with the woman she has become. And despite the major logic gaps in the climax (how an explosion and fire in a house with no obvious escape would not kill three people on the third floor), it looks great. Watching the statue fall on Nick, or the aquariums shatter and flood the floor (oh look, more water) are pretty awesome technical feats, and the film is better for them.\n\nBut the problem is that every one of these great moments is an island unto itself. It’s just enough to remind you that you should be in a better movie. But you aren’t – you’re in “Experiment Perilous.”\n\nScore: **\n\nThe Film Noir Odyssey\n\nWriter: Edward Chodorov\n\nBased on the “You Were There” story by Thelma Strabe, published in Women’s Home Companion\n\nDirector: Vincente Minnelli\n\nCinematographer: Karl Freund\n\nMusic: Herbert Stothart\n\nCast: Katherine Hepburn, Robert Taylor, Robert Mitchum\n\nRelease: November 28, 1946\n\nStudio: MGM Pictures\n\nPercent Noir: 50%\n\n“Undercurrent” is one of the most interesting failures I’ve ever seen. Sure, there are fundamental problems with its cast and storytelling, but one can’t help but appreciate the psychological complexity the writers, director and star were going for. Had things gone well, this could have been a classic noir that stands with the best of ‘em. As it is, it’s a mostly forgotten footnote in the careers of all concerned.\n\nThe idea of a woman marrying the man of her dreams only to realize he may be an evil dick was nothing new when this movie being released. Alfred Hitchcock had famously done it in 1941’s “Suspicion” and netted Joan Fontaine an Oscar for it. George Cukor had done it to even more critical acclaim in 1944’s “Gaslight” and netted Ingrid Bergman an Oscar for it. Screenplay adaptor Edward Chodorov and director Vincente Minnelli seem to have approached “Undercurrent” with less interest in the thriller aspects of the story and more in exploring the psychology of the type of woman who would marry such a man.\n\nAnd thus the character of Ann Hamilton was created. Nearing middle-age, she has never been married and never had much interest in clothes, beauty or the like. She tells herself that she’s never going to find love, even though those around her keep bugging her about it. When a man finally does show interest, named Alan Garroway, Ann completely seems to surrender her character to him, investing herself in clothes and a lifestyle she never gave a thought to before. When you read this description, perhaps the last actress you would picture in the role would be Katherine Hepburn, but that is who was cast.\n\nIt’s fascinating to see Hepburn struggle with such a passive character, and she, almost astonishingly, pulls it off. It’s the quieter moments, the half-tender/half-afraid looks she gives, that sell the performance. A major part of this, of course, comes from Minnelli and Chodorov giving her character the space she needs to convince the audience she can pull it off. Minnelli was a master at getting excellent work from his actresses. Sure, he’s most well-known today for his myriad of MGM musical classics like “Meet Me in St. Louis,” “Cabin in the Sky” and “An American In Paris,” but he was just as talented at crafting great character pieces. Look no further than “The Bad and the Beautiful” or the grossly underrated “The Clock,” which has Judy Garland’s best performance. He and Hepburn found the character and made her great…\n\n…but then paired her with Robert Taylor. Whoops.\n\nTaylor (who has no relation to this writer, thank God) is famously one of Hollywood’s least talented leading men, and one of its more notorious a-holes. “Undercurrent” represented Taylor’s return to film after completing the now-imfamous “Song of Russia” and heading into the army for several years, and is the first of a string of underperforming films noir he would make (“High Wall,” “The Bribe” “Conspirator”) before switching to Westerns. To say he was mismatched with Hepburn would be an understatement. To see Hepburn bending over backward to give a grounded, loving performance contrasted with Taylor’s let-the-mustache-do-the-acting-for-me block of wood acting is kind of astonishing. The two actors famously had very disparate views on politics, and Taylor genuinely never seems like he wants to be in the same space as Hepburn, unsure of how to respond to her emotive work.\n\nTaylor’s best scene is the one he shares with his estranged brother Michael, played by Robert Mitchum in an extended three-scene cameo as the black-sheep who really is a good guy. They confront each other in a barn with the wind whipping outside and frightened horses bucking in the stalls, and here Taylor’s lack of emotion is quite impactful. But this is four minutes out of the nearly two hour film.\n\nHepburn’s Ann becomes obsessed with finding out what happened to Michael, and here is the other place the film stumbled badly. She becomes so fascinated with his secrets and goes to such lengths to uncover the truth that some of these scenes come across as humorous. At a certain point, she’s spoken with every single character at length about Michael but there is still more exposition to get out, so they have her talk to the dog (!!!) about him. Oy. The pacing and repetition of these scenes grates and ruins the pacing of the second hour of the film.\n\nVisually, Minnelli and his cinematographer, the iconic Karl Freund (“Metropolis,” “Dracula,” “Key Largo”) shoot the film without the usual noir trappings until an hour in. They bring in the shadows and tension of the situation in an explicit visual way as the story tips to show Alan is a villain. Alan arrives at a house to confront his wife and loses his temper, knocking a lamp over in the process. The shot does not cut when he does this, instead staying on him as the filmmakers suddenly paint the entire house’s canvas in shadows and menace. Suddenly, Hepburn and Taylor have gone from visible to only in profile. It’s one of the greatest shots in all of film noir, and for it alone the film is almost worth the price of admission.\n\nThey stumble a little later in a short scene taken from Ann’s POV with a coffee cup that goes nowhere and the big climactic sequence. In it, Alan and Ann are riding and he attempts to shove her and her horse over the edge of a cliff. The stuntmen are none-too-convincing and the intercutting between close-ups of the actors and the location footage is unfortunately quite bad, as is the moment one of the horses tramples Alan.\n\nIt’s an unfortunate coda to a film that touched greatness often in its running time. The film was incredibly popular at the box office when released, but I have yet to find a single film buff friend who has actually seen it besides myself. And you should see it, especially if you feel like Hepburn was only capable of playing variations on herself in film.\n\nScore: **1/2"
