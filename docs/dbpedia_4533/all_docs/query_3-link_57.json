        "text": "Sherlockian Relics of Stage, Screen, and Radio\n\nFrom Gillette to Brett IV will feature an amazing exhibit of items associated with Sherlockian stage, screen and cinema, including original pieces of wardrobe, stills, posters, autographs. This is an exhibit exclusive to From Gillette to Brett IV! Here is a small preview of the many items that will be on hand!\n\nSherlock Holmes/Jeremy Brett Frock Coat\n\nThe Adventures of Sherlock Holmes (1983)\n\nMany consider Jeremy Brett to be the definitive dramatic Sherlock Holmes of all time. This is his frock coat from the first season of Granada Television's landmark Sherlock Holmes series. The inside label indicates it is from the Morris Angel I Son, Ltd., the major costume supplier for the UK entertainment industry, and says \"J. Brett 5.5.83\", which is approximately one month before shooting began on the first episode shot, \"The Solitary Cyclist.\"\n\nSherlock Holmes/Basil Rathbone Tweed Hat\n\nUniversal Studios Sherlock Holmes Series (1940s)\n\nWhen Universal Studios updated the Rathbone/Bruce film series to the 1940s, Rathbone insisted that for his own image, and to bring a more \"modern\" feel to these films, he would forgo both the deerstalker cap and inverness coat. Instead, his clothes were more up-to-date. This is his actual hero screen worn Irish Donegal Tweed Wool hat used in the series of Universal Studios Holmes mysteries between 1943 and 1946. It was hand-picked from the famous Millars Hatters in Ireland, and has the original Millars label inside, and the original \"B. Rathbone\" written across the lining of the hat in Indian Ink as was the custom. There are some iconic costumes and props that on their own will instantly identify a character or a movie. This is one of them.\n\nDr. Watson/Nigel Bruce Waistcoat\n\nThe Hound of the Baskervilles (1939)\n\nThe Adventures of Sherlock Holmes (1939)\n\nThere are very few true artifacts from the original Rathbone/Bruce Sherlock Holmes films to be found, but here is one of them...Nigel Bruce's early 20th Century Fox series screen-used grey-cream colored vest with beige back. It includes the original United Costumers Inc. label inside with \"Nigel Bruce .1.\" written in it. This vest was worn by Nigel Bruce starting in the very first Sherlock Holmes feature at 20th Century Fox's \"Hound of the Baskervilles\" (1939).\n\nTicket to \"The New Adventures of Sherlock Holmes\"/Rathbone Bruce\n\n\"The April Fool's Adventure\" (April 1, 1946) Radio Show\n\nPetri Wine. Bromo Quinine. Harry Bartell. Any one of these names will, for the Sherlockian, conjure the famous Basil Rathbone/Nigel Bruce radio series, \"The New Adventures of Sherlock Holmes.\" The series aired from October 2, 1939 to July 7, 1947, with most episodes written by the famous team of Dennis Green and Anthony Boucher. Basil Rathbone and Nigel Bruce starred in 220 weekly episodes. This is the only ticket to the series known to exist. This was a ticket to \"The April Fool's Adventure\" which aired on April 1, 1946.\n\nSir Henry Baskerville/Richard Green Costume\n\nThe Hound of the Baskervilles (1939)\n\n\"The Hound Of The Baskervilles\" (1939) was the first in what many still consider the best Sherlock Holmes films ever produced. And of course it didn't hurt that they all starred the legendary Sherlock Holmes, Basil Rathbone (assisted by Nigel Bruce's Dr. Watson). This is the hero screen-used costume worn by Sir Henry Baskerville (played by Richard Greene). It includes pants and a shirt and the original United Costumers - Hollywood labels RICHARD GREENE inked inside.\n\nDr. Watson/Ben Kingsley Tweed Coat\n\nWithout a Clue (1988)\n\nFrom the delightfully twisted all-star cast take on Sherlock Holmes, \"Without A Clue\" (1988), this is Dr. Watson's (played by Oscar winner Ben Kingsley) hero, screen-worn dress jacket. This herring bone wool jacket in perfect condition is from the legendary London costume company, Bermans and Nathans. (Jacket comes with a Bermans and Nathans label with \"Ben Kingsley: Imposter of B.S.\" printed on it. (\"The Imposter of Baker Street\" was the film's working title.)\n\nSherlock Holmes/Paxton Whitehead Deerstalker\n\nThe Crucifer of Blood (Broadway, 1978)\n\n\"The Crucifer of Blood\" is the famous play adapted from the Sherlock Holmes story \"The Sign of the Four.\" This is the deerstalker hat worn by Paxton Whitehead, who played Sherlock Holmes opposite the female character Irene St. Claire, played by Glenn Close. Close had a habit of, just as the last scene ended, taking the hat off of Whitehead and placing it on her own head."
