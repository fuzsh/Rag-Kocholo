        "text": "Anecdotes about\n\nBasil Rathbone\n\nBasil Rathbone touched many lives. Some people knew him well, some only slightly, and most people only saw him on the movie screen or on the stage. On this page you can share your memories of Basil Rathbone, no matter how well you knew him, or didn't know him. Perhaps something amusing happened when you were getting his autograph, or perhaps a particular Rathbone performance inspired you in a special way (to become an actor, for example). No matter what your memory is, if you'd like to share it here with other Rathbone fans, please e-mail me. You may remain anonymous if you wish, or have your name and/or e-mail included. (Please make your wishes clear in your e-mail to me.) And don't be intimidated by David Macklin's delightful reminiscences of Working with Basil!\n\nMarcia Jessen, gisbourne@basilrathbone.net\n\nRichard Valley shared this tidbit:\n\n\"I met Basil Rathbone once when he was promoting his autobiography in a local store's book department. I mentioned THE COMEDY OF TERRORS, which I love. He never forgave me . . . \"\n\nIn a letter to author J.C. Trewin, Aileen Wyse told a story about something that happened during a performance of Paolo and Francesca in 1915. This was when Rathbone was with Frank Benson's company. Basil and Florence Glossup-Harris played the title characters.\n\nQuoted in Benson and the Bensonians, by J.C. Trewin\n\nThe Los Angeles Times (March 9, 1937) reported the following story:\n\nBasil Rathbone, motion picture actor, changed his occupation to detective yesterday long enough to capture a man he suspected of stealing from him, and then helped Hollywood detectives chase the suspect several blocks when he tried to escape.\n\nThe story starts with the discharge by Rathbone of Robert Lee Sapp, 29-year-old butler, some time ago when Rathbone began missing some money, jewelry and clothing. He hired another butler. This week he discovered that the new butler was harboring Sapp in his quarters at Rathbone's residence, 5254 Los Feliz Boulevard, and he fired him, he told officers. Yesterday Rathbone found Sapp in the butler's quarters while the present servant was away, pushed him into a room and locked the door. He called the police.\n\nMeanwhile Sapp had jumped two stories to the ground and began running as Radio Officers Johnson and Fitzpatrick and Detective Lieutenants Smith and Maney arrived. Rathbone and his secretary, Harry Dausman, joined the officers in pursuing Sapp and finally captured him at Harvard Boulevard and Russell Street.\n\nSapp was booked on suspicion of burglary at Hollywood Police Station, Dausman was treated at Hollywood Receiving Hospital for lacerations received climbing fences in the case, and Rathbone returned to his dramatic pursuits.\n\nComedian Hugh Herbert told this story about Basil Rathbone's sense of humor:\n\nsource: Modern Screen, July 1938\n\nAnn Sheridan told a reporter about an embarrassing moment at one of the Rathbone parties:\n\nsource: Modern Screen, July 1940\n\nThis story is from fellow Rathbone fan Larry Clifton:\n\nBasil Rathbone and his wife gave a party for some Hollywood friends. When dinner was over, Mrs. Rathbone announced that her husband would play for the guests. When the guests had been seated, however, Rathbone pleaded that he wasn't in the mood. He begged to be excused while he took a walk in the garden. He returned in a half hour, a serene expression on his face. The guests sat up expectantly as he strode into the room. Rathbone waited until they had quieted down, then walked over over to the phonograph and played it for them!\n\nSource: The Buffalo Evening News, February 9, 1950\n\nThis anecdote concerns the friendship that Basil Rathbone had with tenor Richard Tauber. Tauber's widow, Diana Napier, gave a journalist the following story:\n\nIn his autobiography, Basil Rathbone wrote about his reunion with Corporal Tanner, sixteen years after they had served together in the first world war. The year was 1934, and Rathbone had appeared with Katharine Cornell at the Paramount theater in Toledo, Ohio. He was surprised to learn that his former army buddy had become a policeman in Toledo. They arranged to meet at the Commodore Perry Hotel, and the press reported about the reunion. Here is one newspaper clipping from December 1934. \"Tanner\" is misidentified as \"Turner.\"\n\nThis anecdote is from a college student newspaper called The Stick:\n\nThe following anecdote is from a 1934 newspaper clipping. The name of the newspaper and the date of the article are unknown. What is known is that Basil Rathbone and Katherine Cornell were touring the country in 1934, giving performances of Romeo and Juliet, The Barretts of Wimpole Street, and Candida.\n\nBasil Rathbone, I'm afraid, has lived in Hollywood long enough to expect the worst from rings at his doorbell. Anyhow, shortly after he moved to Bel Air, when he heard a commotion at the front door and glimpsed a red-faced man with his tie under one ear, his first impulse was to cry to the butler, \"Don't let him in!\" Second thought led him to investigateand just as well, too. The red-faced man panted, \"So sorry to trouble you, old man! But you see, I've got this appointment to speak at a banquet. My wife's away and my man has broken his wrist and look here! You're awfully good at this sort of thing. Would youwould you be so kind as to tie my tie for me? Just as a neighborly gesture?\"\n\nBasil shouted, \"Why, of course, of course!\" and started right in to assist the distressed one. But it turned out that he had to call Ouida after all because he discovered that while he can certainly tie a perfect bow under his own personal chin, it's another matter entirely to approach the matter backward, as it were, and tie it under someone else's chin. By the time Ouida arrived the tie was in rags and they had to send upstairs for one of Basil's and by the time that was all attended to, the three of them were fast friends. And the red-faced gentleman turned out to be an important picture executive and everyone in Hollywood knows that it's a fine thing to be fast friends with an executive. There must be a moral somewhere in this.\n\nSource: Hollywood magazine, August 1940, p. 43\n\n\"E.C. Writer,\" a reader of The Baz (a blog about Basil Rathbone), shared this memory of meeting the great actor:\n\nIn 1955, Basil and Ouida stayed in California while Basil was working on a film. They leased their New York City apartment to actress Joan Fontaine for a period of six months. Fontaine wrote the following in her book No Bed of Roses:\n\nOn November 27, 1931, Basil Rathbone appeared on the Nestle Chocolateers radio program (with Nat Brusiloff's Orchestra, NBC). Variety reported the following:\n\nBasil Rathbone sprang a big surprise as guest artist for Nestle. Instead of recounting some of his past stage or screen experiences or relating a few anecdotes relative to his past, as is the custom among straight leading men of stage or screen who go before a mike, Rathbone entertained as a songster.\n\nIn announcing his song numbers, Rathbone mentioned that this was the first time he has warbled on radio since he started to study singing. The actor did three songs, all of them off the beaten track. They were a poem by John Masefield; spiritual \"Deep River,\" and a song announced as written by Ernest Torrence, film actor. Rathbone's singing voice is altogether different than one would imagine from hearing him speak. He sings in a deep baritone. Besides the songs Rathbone handled some light comedy lines with the announcer between numbers. His English accent is not a detriment, as this actor makes the listeners feel the accent is genuine and not a pose.\n\nSource: Variety, December 1, 1931\n\nBernard J. O'Heir, a long-time fan of Basil Rathbone, shared this memory of meeting Robert Quarry (star of two vampire pictures: Count Yorga and The Return of Count Yorga). Quarry was a guest at the Ninth Annual Fanex Science Fiction/Horror Convention, held at the Sheraton in Towson, MD, on July 23, 1995.\n\nThe following story can be found in the September 1938 issue of Screenland magazine:\n\nDavid Leddick, one of Cynthia Rathbone's friends, sent the following memoir:\n\nWes Shank, a long-time fan of Basil Rathbone, shares his memory of a special meeting with the great man:\n\nQuinn O'Hara, an actress who co-starred with Basil in The Ghost in the Invisible Bikini, shares her memories of Rathbone:\n\nIn an article written for the Highland Park News, Chuck Wenk told about a practical joke that broadcaster Bob Elson played on Basil Rathbone. Wenk wrote:\n\nSource: \"Bob Elson: A Broadcast Booth Prankster,\" Highland Park News, October 18, 2012\n\nMichael Hoey, son of British actor Dennis Hoey (Inspector Lestrade), tells how he met Basil Rathbone:\n\n(Excerpted with permission from Michael Hoey's book Sherlock Holmes & the Fabulous Faces: The Universal Pictures Repertory Company. Click here to read more about the book.)\n\nPenny tells this story of meeting Basil Rathbone when she was a little girl:\n\nVisit the Letters from Basil page to read the letter that Penny's mother received.\n\nIn 2004 William Shatner was a featured guest at the 21st William S. Paley Television Festival, The Museum of Television and Radio's annual salute to the history of television. Ron Simon, the curator of the New York branch of the Museum of Television and Radio, introduced Mr. Shatner to the audience. After a presentation of film clips showcasing William Shatner's prolific career, including appearances in live television broadcasts during the 1950s, Ron Simon talked with Mr. Shatner.\n\n\"Sharing a couple of memorable moments of when things did go wrong [in live television] Shatner recounted the story of working with Basil Rathbone in a 1955 Canadian production of the drama Billy Budd. Admitting that he and the other actors were rather intimidated by the idea of working with Mr. Rathbone they all rehearsed extensively. Then on the night of the broadcast Basil Rathbone stepped onstage and right into a bucket. Consequently Rathbone couldn't deliver his next lines as he struggled to free his foot.\"*\n\n*From \"An Evening with William Shatner\" by Jacqueline Bundy, 12 March 2004\n\nhttps://more-shatner.livejournal.com/112000.html\n\nPatrick McNee, Basil Rathbone and William Shatner\n\nIn his autobiography Milton Berle wrote the following about Rathbone:\n\nfrom Milton Berle, An Autobiography (paperback edition) by Milton Berle with Haskel Frankel (Dell Publishing, 1974), 307-308.\n\nDick Cavett, a talk-show host known for his wit and intimate interviewing style, remembers meeting Basil Rathbone and hearing him tell an interesting story:\n\nSource: https://archive.nytimes.com/opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2007/02/13/basil-rathbones-mysterious-message/\n\nA good friend of mine was an actor named Gregory Gaye. He and Rathbone acted together in Pursuit to Algiers and Tovarich*; Gregory Gaye played Russian villains. A close friend of Rathbones, Gregory used to dine with him at his home. He told me that the guests would often end up dueling with swords throughout the house!\n\nGregory Gaye also told me that in Pursuit to Algiers he had to hit Rathbone over the head with a rubber gun. The first two tries were so soft that Rathbone told Gregory, \"You're wasting film. When you hit me, do it like you mean it.\" The next shot Gregory really gave Rathbone a wallop. After the scene Rathbone said, \"Now that's believable, Greg.\" Gregory told me he just didn't want to hurt his old friend.\n\nR. Franks\n\n* In Pursuit to Algiers Gregory Gaye played Ravez, and in Tovarich he played Count Frederic Brekenski.\n\nGregory Gaye\n\nThe following anecdotes about Rathbone are from Nigel Bruce's unpublished memoirs. First, Nigel tells how he got the role of Dr. Watson. He was very depressed after being in a play that was a failure (\"Knights of Song\"). Then he received a telegram.\n\nSource: Sherlock Holmes Journal, Winter 1998\n\nIn 1920 Basil Rathbone starred with Constance Collier in the play \"Peter Ibbetson.\" Eleven-year-old Eugenie Misener, a pupil of Italia Conti, was the understudy for the part of the young girl played by Madeleine Robertson. Her recollection is that the play opened at the Savoy (London), then went down to Brighton, before returning to the Royal Court Theatre. She had to be chaperoned whilst in Brighton but never actually got on stage there or in London as Madeleine was never ill.\n\nLater she went to see Basil as Iago in the \"Othello\" production at the Royal Court Theatre. On that occasion, she went around to the Stage Door and asked to see him, only to be rebuffed by the doorman. Persistent, she waited for Basil to appear, and he immediately recognized her, and called out \"Ah, my little girl!\" You can imagine what delight she took in being invited in, one-up on the doorman and other would-be admirers!\n\nSid Caesar shares this story of Basil Rathbone's appearance on Your Show of Shows, a 90-minute television program that was broadcast live:\n\nCaesar's Hours, by Sid Caesar with Eddy Friedfeld (New York: Public Affairs) 2003. pp. 250-251.\n\nMy father managed Mr. Rathbone during some of his speaking tours during the 1960s. He arranged for several visits that Mr. Rathbone made to South America. My father recalled meeting with Mr. Rathbone and his wife, Ouida, in their NY apartment and how Mr. Rathbone read aloud to him there. He said it was an experience he would never forget and also expressed how extremely gracious both Mr. Rathbone and his wife were to him. Had I not been such a young, dopey kid at the time you can believe I would've begged my father to let me join him. At any rate, I ended up with a personally autographed photo signed, \"Best Wishes, Basil Rathbone alias Sherlock Holmes,\" which I treasure to this day.\n\nRandy Winston, New City, NY\n\nI first heard of Basil when I was around seven years of age in 1972 and this is where I first saw him in Sherlock Holmes films. He really was a great actor in those days and yes I'm a fan of his in Sherlock Holmes movies. I still watched him on TV over and over the years. I already bought a book about him and I do believe apart from his acting he was a good hearted gentleman. he always seemed to have time to meet and talk to anyone.\n\nAn Irish Basil Rathbone supporter,\n\nMr. Ronan Meyler, Dublin, Ireland\n\nI grew up in NYC/Manhattan  the daughter of a prominent physician (who by chance was Basil Rathbone's MD). I had always been a fan of Mr. Rathbone's. . . sooooo, one day (the summer holidays had already started and I was home from boarding school), my dad's secretary called the house saying that my dad wanted me to come by the office (which was quite close to our apartment) for luncheon. I headed over and waited in the patient's waiting room. Ms. Bethany (dad's secretary/nurse) came in and said that my dad was ready to see me... I went into his office and lo-and-behold there standing in the middle of the room was Basil Rathbone!!!! WOW... what a surprise!!!! Ms. Bethany took a picture of me facing him, showing our profiles... I treasure that moment and the picture (which my mum put into a cardboard frame which was then signed [at a later date] by Mr. Rathbone.\n\nPam Taylor\n\nLouise, a fellow Basil fan, shares the following stories:\n\nKaren, a Rathbone fan in England relates this story:\n\n\"My mother knew Basil in England before and after the war, and when I was very little, in about 1963, she took me to visit him for a few days. I don't remember a thing about it, except being in this dark place, with a brightly lit area, which apparently was a movie set, and being picked up by a man in a black coat and tall black hat with silky stuff tied on it, who was showing me round, and talking to me. There was a mirror over a fireplace and some red chairs, and when he put me down he told me not to trip over this big cable running along the ground.\"\n\nIn his biography of Basil Rathbone, Michael Druxman relates an amusing story about Moritz, Basil's German Shepherd:\n\nWorking With Basil\n\nby David Macklin\n\nWhen I came to Hollywood to pursue my own acting career, I left The Basil Rathbone Club and for a while Basil himself behind. I was preoccupied with trying to make it in the movies and simply surviving. A few years passed and the career was going pretty well. I was doing leads and guest star roles on TV and an occasional movie. So, when I received an offer to do a part with little dialogue in a pilot film for 20th called Warbirds I was inclined to turn it down. When my agent, Dorothy Maclin, told me that Basil Rathbone was reprising his role as Major Brand in this proposed series based on the great film \"The Dawn Patrol,\" I jumped at it.\n\nThe year was 1964 and it had been several years since I had last met Basil after one of his Theater Programs and knew he was getting a little long in the tooth. When I spotted him on the set in his chair working on his lines I realized he looked more frail than when I last saw him. I made my way over to him, more than a little nervous, and found that he was rather flustered himself and was muttering \"Damn it Basil...get it right!\" as he went over his lines.\n\nAfter a few moments I decided to jump in and said \"Mr. Rathbone?\" He looked up and said \"Yes?\" I sputtered out, \"I am David Macklin, I used to be David Mortashed and I was President of your fan club.\" He looked at me blankly with no sign of recognition. I continued, \"You remember? I took over the club from Doris Devasier.\" He squinted and then smiled and said, \"Oh! Are you Doris Devasier?\"\n\nWell, you can imagine that I was a little taken aback. I thought I looked pretty butch in my air force uniform. I stuttered onward...\"No, I'm David Macklin...I mean Mortashed...I mean I was David Mortashed....I am David Macklin now but I was Mortashed...David...And was your fan club president AFTER Doris Devasier.\" He looked at me again and laughed. \"Yes, of course dear boy...forgive me. I am getting rather addled these days and I had a terrible flight with bad food (more on that later) and I have this monster speech coming up.\" We talked a bit about the old days: Sherlock Holmes, Errol Flynn and movies versus theater. I told him that I still had the letters* he sent me and that I treasured them.\n\n*Ed. note: These letters can be viewed on the \"Letters from Basil\" page.\n\nI could see he was still concerned about his lines so I asked if I could cue him which he gratefully accepted. It was wonderful. Here I was helping this marvelous actor who had given us so many years of inspiration and enjoyment. I cued Basil Rathbone and we worked on word associations that would spark his memory and soon he was in control and relaxed into the role. It was great to see him as he was in Sherlock Holmes, \"The Dawn Patrol\" and so many of his classic roles. I was so moved that I got tears in my eyes and choked up a bit. He seemed to understand and patted me on the knee and murmured, \"Quite right...quite right old boy.\" Then he laughed and said, \"Doris Devasier indeed!\"\n\nSoon it was time to tackle Basil's big scene. He started off a little shaky, muttering again, \"Damn it Basil...get it right!\" But shortly he had it down and we went for a take. The cameras were rolling and he was doing fine when suddenly he broke wind...a rather prolonged B flat. Like the pro he was, he didn't yell CUT and went on with the scene as did we flyboys who surrounded him. After the take, he broke out laughing and said \"Sorry about the ad lib.\" The whole set laughed with him and when we settled down the sound man said, \"It's OK. We are clear! No overlaps.\" Cheers and laughter rolled over the set. The take was printed, we did the coverage and moved on with a delightful day of shooting.\n\nThe next day I drove Basil as Major Brand around 20th's great back lot in a jeep for some location shots. To tell the truth I had never driven a jeep before and it was a bit of a jerky bumpy ride. Basil remarked, \"Dear boy! You are shaking up my innards a bit.\" I said, \"Sorry Sir, but they didn't teach jeep driving in drama school.\" To which he replied \"Quite right! Carry on!\"\n\nIt was a glorious day and the last time either of us saw the back lot of 20th Century Fox. I remember Basil Rathbone looking wistfully around at the green rolling hills of the lot and saying, \"I have many fond memories of this place. It will all be glass and concrete soon.\" And so it came to pass. After the \"Cleopatra\" debacle 20th sold the back lot and it soon became the great conglomeration of marble and glass known as Century City.\n\nA few years later I was vacationing in Laguna Beach. While lounging on the beach I heard on the radio that Basil Rathbone had died. I went to my motel room and spent the rest of the day there full of sadness and regret. Why hadn't I stayed in contact with Basil? Why didn't I get a photo with him? Why didn't I at least have him autograph my script? Who could ever replace this truly gracious, witty, kind man and magnificent actor?"
