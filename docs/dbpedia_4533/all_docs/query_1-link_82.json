        "text": "Director: Roy William Neill\n\nStarring: Basil Rathbone, Nigel Bruce, Paul Cavanagh\n\nRelease Date: 26th May 1944 (US)\n\nNew Year’s Day 2016, and the BBC broadcast their long-awaited Sherlock special, ‘The Abominable Bride.’ What makes this particular episode so keenly anticipated by fans is its setting in the late Victorian era of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle’s original stories, and they weren’t disappointed – at least to begin with. Yes, they saw hansom cabs, street urchins, and suffragettes, but as ‘The Abominable Bride’ progressed, viewers began to realize the makers of Sherlock had a different game afoot; why, for example, would the 1895 Mycroft Holmes remark upon data viruses?\n\nAs became apparent, ‘The Abominable Bride’ wasn’t set in the 1890s at all, in so far as the Victorian adventures of Sherlock Holmes and Dr Watson were part of ‘our’ Sherlock’s attempt to solve the riddle of his arch-enemy Prof. Moriarty’s seeming return to life. Many viewers confessed themselves baffled at the show’s fractured narrative, scratching their heads as the Victorian Sherlock (Benedict Cumberbatch) made his surmise while looking over modern-day Baker Street: “I have always felt I am a man out of his time…”\n\nHowever, long-time fans of the Great Detective’s screen outings are used to seeing their hero outside of his usual Victorian milieu. Of the fourteen Holmes films starring Basil Rathbone as Sherlock and Nigel Bruce as Dr John Watson, only the first two, The Hound of the Baskervilles and The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes (both 1939), retained the trappings of Conan Doyle’s original stories. These films were made by 20th Century Fox, who although pleased by the films’ success, already had a long-running detective property in the shape of the Charlie Chan films. Fox passed their rights to Universal, who between 1942 and 1946 made twelve Holmes films with a contemporary setting, often pitting Baker Street’s finest against enemies of the Allied Forces. Universal updated the chronology concerned younger members of their demographic would feel alienated by stories set in another time and country, and felt modernization, and having Holmes and Watson in other settings (including the USA), would make the characters more accessible.\n\nDoubtless the traditionalists were outraged, but they need not have worried. For one thing, the characters of Holmes and Watson, like those of Shakespeare, are strong enough to survive such a transference; and second, the Universal films wear their modern traits lightly, and beyond characters using telephones or 1940s-era transportation, there isn’t much to trouble those who hold Conan Doyle’s stories dear to their heart.\n\nBy common consent, the best of the Universal twelve is The Scarlet Claw, an original Holmes story based loosely on ‘The Hounds of the Baskervilles’ (originally published in 1901). Directed by Roy William Neill, who helmed the entire Universal series aside from The Voice of Terror (1942), The Scarlet Claw sees Holmes and Watson again on their travels, this time in Canada. The opening scenes are reassuringly creepy, as although Holmes and Watson are far from 221B Baker Street, the fogbound moor haunted by the doleful tolling of a church bell are straight from the pages of The Strand magazine.\n\nFans may revel in this gloomy scenario, but not so the inhabitants of a village with the unpromising name of La Mort Rouge, gathered in the bar of the Journet Hotel, for it is late at night and no church bell should toll at this hour. A postman named Potts (Gerald Hamer) arrives, too scared by a mysterious light on the moors to continue his duties, and talks to Father Pierre (George Kirby) of the possible identity of the nocturnal campanologist. The villagers, the sort of simple folk who populate B-movies, blame a legendary monster said to stalk the nearby swamps, holding this entity responsible for the recent violent death of farmers’ sheep, but Father Pierre will have none of this: “what we need is more faith and less imagination,” although both amount to the same thing in this agnostic’s personal opinion.\n\nThe postman and the priest leave for the church, where the Father finds an awful sight – the body of a dead woman, her hands still gripping the rope of the church bell.\n\nPotts has continued to Penrose Hall to deliver an urgent letter. There, he learns that Drake (Ian Wolfe), the Penrose family butler, has also seen the strange light, and the two compare their experiences until Father Pierre arrives with the news that the dead woman is none other than Lady Penrose herself. Lord Penrose is out of town, hosting a conference of the Royal Canadian Occult Society in Quebec City. Father Pierre then exits TSC, no great loss as he’s a much worse actor than most Catholic priests.\n\nForget your modern conferences with their tea-making facilities, PowerPoint presentations and mission statement strategy meetings, this conference is high on pipe-smoking and lacquered male solemnity as Lord Penrose (Paul Cavanagh) holds forth on the supernatural, making pointed remarks upon “open minds” and “the facts” in the direction of Sherlock Holmes (Basil Rathbone) and Dr Watson (Nigel Bruce). “Facts,” responds Holmes, “are always convincing. It’s the conclusions drawn from facts that are frequently in error.” Watson pipes up by referencing the Baskerville case “and the adventure of the Sussex Vampire,” but is hushed by Holmes before matters become too self-referential.\n\nLord Penrose claims to possess convincing facts, siting the case of three brutal killings committed in La Mort Rogue a hundred years ago, men with their throats ripped out and no sign of the perpetrator. Holmes is underwhelmed by this ‘evidence,’ causing Lord Penrose to denounce the “ridiculous skepticism” of events “beyond the realm of your comprehension.” Penrose leaves to take a telephone call, and Holmes puts the lord’s behavior down to being “overwrought.”\n\nSadly for Lord Penrose, his wroughtness is wrung yet further with the news Lady Penrose has departed this Earth to conduct her own research into what lies beyond. Forgetting he’s at a conference of the occult, and so can’t be far from a medium, Lord Penrose stoically accepts his wife’s demise and announces the news to the assembled society members, including the pertinent detail that Lady Penrose’s throat was ripped out, so at least they’ve acquired more evidence of supernatural activity. Pausing only for an opportunistic snark at Holmes, Penrose leaves for La Mort Rogue.\n\nThe next morning, Holmes and Watson also prepare to leave Quebec City, with the good doctor complaining they should eat first. “Don’t you think of anything else other than your stomach?” snaps Holmes, one of a number of put-downs the detective aims at his loyal friend. Many versions of Holmes, including the recent BBC series, pick up on Holmes’ anti-social aspects, and how they color his relationship with Watson. The Universal films see Watson often chided or patronized by Holmes, antagonizing fans of Conan Doyle’s stories where Holmes treats Watson with greater respect. However, Nigel Bruce’s Watson isn’t entirely passive in the face of such comments, it’s just that Rathbone’s Holmes is indifferent to Watson’s muted responses. Perhaps this version of Watson sees Holmes’ jibes as a small price to pay for a life of adventure or, as a doctor, Watson senses Holmes cannot help himself in making negative comments to those closest to him.\n\nAs Watson reads the newspaper report of Lady Penrose’s death, Holmes receives a letter – from Lady Penrose. The dead woman had a premonition of her death (“some secret from her past, most probably”) and knowing Holmes was visiting Quebec, attempted to contact the detective but died before her letter reached him. Fascinated by “the tragic irony,” Holmes takes the case, telling Watson “for the first time, we’ve been retained by a corpse.”\n\nLord Penrose is displeased by the visitors to Penrose Manor, believing Holmes has followed him to La Mort Rogue to disprove the supernatural, what with Lady Penrose showing no sign of coming back as a ghost. Holmes shows Penrose his late wife’s plea to investigate her own murder but Penrose, convinced his wife was killed by supernatural forces, dismisses the sleuths.\n\nWhile Penrose is distracted by the telephone, Holmes and Watson take the chance to examine Lady Penrose’s corpse, laid out to rest in an ante-chamber. Watson’s forensic skills come to the fore: “a clumsy job,” reckons the doctor, “just missed the jugular vein, must have bled to death.” Attacked out in the moors, the injured Lady Penrose staggered to the church, ringing its bell to summon help only to die of her wounds. “Just long enough for Lord Penrose to leave and reach Quebec,” supposes Holmes.\n\nPenrose finds Holmes and Watson admiring his dead wife’s body, and with commendable restraint, asks the pair to leave. This they do, before Holmes imparts two facts: “Your wife was murdered, and she was Lillian Gentry.” But who is Lillian Gentry?\n\nPolice Sgt. Thompson (David Clyde) asks the same question, and Holmes explains Gentry (her name surely based on that of famed late-Victorian actress Lily Langtry) toured North America as part of a stage company before disappearing several years ago. Sgt Thompson disagrees the woman, whatever her identity, was murdered as no weapon could cause such injuries, aside from the claws of an animal. No ordinary weapon that is; Holmes examines the five-pronged garden cultivator rather handily placed on Thompson’s desk, used for weeding the garden behind the town jail (when not the scene of horrific murders, La Mort Rogue is a ‘garden behind the town jail’ type of place).\n\nHolmes asks if Thompson is aware of anyone in the town with a police record; no, although the hotel owner, Emile Journet, once worked as a jail guard. Watson, bored of this talk, toys with the sergeant’s collection of rifles, a scandal when he could be petting the adorable German Shepherd dog snoozing by Thompson’s desk. Keen for his own spot of bloodshed, Watson declares he’d “like a bang” at the “prairie chickens” for which the area is famous. ‘Prairie chicken’ is a generic term for several species of grouse, some of which are near extinction in Canada, possibly due to the likes of Dr Watson, who’s reminded by Holmes that shooting farmyard chickens is more his level. Didn’t Watson learn anything from what happened to Cecil the Lion?\n\nTaking a room at the Journet Hotel, Holmes and Watson are greeted by Marie (Kay Harding), Emile’s daughter. The young girl is in tears: “my Papa is going away.” Holmes pokes fun at Watson’s concern: “wouldn’t you be sad if your Papa were going away?” This leads to another of Watson’s rambling grumbles, during which the doctor says “I haven’t seen him in years.” Again, Holmes’ anti-social tendencies result in him hitting upon a touchy subject for his friend with the detective indifferent to, or unable to read, Watson’s emotions. The BBC Sherlock is presented as a ‘high-functioning sociopath,’ and although Holmes’ problems in dealing with people as emotional beings remain an underplayed element in the Universal films, such moments gesture towards the future direction Sherlock writers Steven Moffat and Mark Gatiss would take Holmes.\n\nEmile Journet appears at the reception desk just as Potts delivers the mail, offloading a batch of bills with the sage comment “it costs money to be born, and it costs money to die,” so thank goodness Canada has got a good national health system nowadays. Potts is happily convinced Holmes will fail (“you can’t arrest ghosts and monsters”) and leaves as pleased with life as ever, though bashing his leg against that barroom table might have dented his mood and would normally call for a retake, but damn it there’s a war on, and we all had to keep calm and carry on back then.\n\nLater, Journet is furious with his daughter for letting slip his intention to leave, and slaps her across the face, just as Holmes and Watson enter his office. The hotel owner backtracks, claiming he’d only considered leaving La Mort Rogue for a short spell; as for Marie, “I was just teaching her the difference.” Watson disapproves – “Disgraceful!” – but Holmes interjects, telling his friend it is none of their business. This sounds callous, though it was the opinion of many of the time that how a father disciplines as child was his concern, and his concern only.\n\n“What do you know of Lady Penrose’s death?” asks Holmes of Journet; only that she was killed by a monster, rather like those unfortunate sheep. Holmes believes someone is using the legend of La Mort Rouge as a cover for fresh killings and, finding a garden cultivator in Journet’s office, accuses the hotel owner of wishing to leave due to Holmes’ arrival upsetting his plans. Journet denies this, saying he’s in fear of his life. Holmes tells Journet you can’t run away from yourself, adding he’d be grateful if he’d return the cultivator to Sgt. Thompson, having ‘accidentally’ taken it from the station. Anyone for a ‘plant’ joke here? Still, it’s interesting to see Holmes using modern police methods in his investigations.\n\nThat evening Watson, under instructions from Holmes, mingles with the locals in the hotel bar to find out all he can about the Penrose murder. “Make yourself inconspicuous,” is the detective’s advice and Watson, bless him, does try for several seconds, first seating himself opposite a grizzled old sea-dog whose smile suggests he’s been without human company for a long time and isn’t fussed about what form it comes in.\n\nOverhearing Potts and Drake discussing the history of the supernatural in crime, Watson introduces himself by giving out his full name and address. Drake is drunk, and gets into a bizarre argument with Watson as to whether a bus is said to “hoot” or “honk,” according to which part of the world you’re in. On hearing a bus hooting, or honking outside, Drake departs La Mort Rouge, throat intact, leaving Potts to ponder the fate of his own larynx.\n\nIn Holmes’ room, Journet attempts to wake the detective, only to find his bed full of luggage. Holmes himself is at the police station, consulting with Thompson as to how best to explore the swamps. As for Watson, Holmes describes him as undertaking “research,” and by now will be “magnificently involved.”\n\nI’d say he is, rather like I’m magnificently involved with a four pack of Guinness of a Friday night. Now at the back end of a bottle of red, Watson has the entire bar crowded around his table as he discourses on G K Chesterton’s 1911 Father Brown story ‘The Invisible Man.’ As Watson jokes woozily that the local legends have put everyone on edge, Potts and a fellow bar denizen leave for home; at the same time, Marie sees her father leave and walk the misty streets to who knows where. Taking Potts’ place at Watson’s table is a man who looks like an elf carved out of a turnip. Alas, we don’t get to hear this fellow talk. If he can talk.\n\nSoon, the church bell is tolling once more. Sgt Thompson bursts in; Holmes is not in bed as Watson believed, but out on the moors, and possibly in great danger.\n\nThe sergeant’s concern is justified, as we see Holmes tracked by a strange glowing figure through the marshes. Before this phantom can strike, Holmes turns and fires off a few shots; the figure flees and escapes. Holmes has his clue however, a scrap of luminous substance hooked upon the branch of a tree. The villagers arrive, yet Watson is not among them; the doctor is soon found, belly-deep in a bog, like a latter-day David Hume. Unlike the philosopher, Watson isn’t required to recite the Lord’s Prayer for his rescue, and once extricated, complains he was pushed into the bog by an apparition “spitting fire.” Catching a cold, in the speedy way people tended to in old movies, Watson is taken back by Holmes to their hotel room.\n\nNigel Bruce’s portrayal of Dr John Watson is often derided by fans of Conan Doyle’s work, who point out that in the original Holmes stories, Watson is a man of courage, discretion, and intelligence, whereas Universal’s Watson is frequently a comic buffoon, used for light relief. While it’s true the Watson of Conan Doyle’s stories didn’t make a habit of falling into bogs, getting tipsy with the locals or being the butt of Holmesian barbs (indeed, Watson could be critical of Holmes, especially on the subject of his morphine addiction), we should not underestimate the importance of Bruce’s relationship to the Rathbone version of Holmes. Aside from making for fine popular entertainment, Bruce’s Watson allows the Rathbone portrayal of Holmes greater freedom in a time when the potential psychological complexities of a man like Holmes were ill-understood.\n\nThe emphasis placed on Watson’s avuncular nature leads this scene to serve as an unintentional metaphor for their professional relationship, as the hale and hearty Watson captivates the hotel bar, unknowingly allowing Holmes to follow through on his theorizing elsewhere. The depiction of their relationship in TSC and other Universal films entrances the viewer, easing them into their adventures, for had Bruce portrayed Watson in a dryer fashion, closer to Holmes’ personality, contemporary audiences may have been less engaged in their films. As it is, Bruce’s broad strokes highlight Rathbone’s finer brush work and we should note Bruce was no slouch as an actor, appearing in prestigious films such as Treasure Island (1934), The Charge of the Light Brigade (1936) and Rebecca (1940).\n\nWe see the more serious side of Watson as Holmes queries why his friend placed himself at risk: “I’ve a right to share in your dangers,” comes the reply. When Lord Penrose arrives to check on Holmes’ progress, and describes Watson as Holmes’ assistant, Watson counters “I’m not his assistant.” These comments suggest Watson’s belief in a true partnership, in which he and Holmes compensate for their mutual weaknesses although only Watson can recognize this due to his friend’s radically different mental functioning. For 1944, that’s perhaps as complex as the Holmes-Watson relationship could be portrayed.\n\nDiscussing the case with Penrose, Holmes admits he’s “baffled.” Penrose warns the detective to leave for London before he too dies. Once the lord has left, Holmes notes “he seemed pleased we’d found no evidence,” aware the killer knew he was out on the marshes and tried to scare the detective away.\n\nThe police station sees Holmes and Sgt Thompson examining the scrap of cloth under a microscope. We learn the only material of this kind sold in the La Mort Rouge branch of Harvey Nichols comes in the form of shirts bought only by Judge Brisson, crippled by a stroke soon after retiring to the village a couple of years ago. Judge Brisson lives “in a fortress,” with only a housekeeper and a fierce dog for company.\n\nHolmes and Watson visit Judge Brisson’s the next morning, and are soon acquainted with both the scary dog and the marginally less scary housekeeper, Nora (Victoria Horne). Refused access, Holmes wins over Nora with “you wouldn’t want Judge Brisson’s death on your conscience, would you?” while Watson wins over the dog with “good Fido! Good dog!”\n\nWinning the trust of Judge Brisson (Miles Mander) proves more difficult, as he’s an ornery old cuss packing heat in a wheelchair. Aiming a rifle at Holmes and Watson, Brisson informs the pair he has “the fullest confidence in my own defenses.” Holmes, who’s not so sociopathic that he can’t take a hint, departs regretfully: “I am unable to prevent your death,” accidentally dropping Lady Brisson’s letter as he leaves.\n\nAlert Fox News! Judge Brisson must be a welfare cheat, getting out of his wheelchair to pick up the letter. Holmes catches him in the act, but rather than inform Bill O’Reilly, asks why the deception? “I’m scared of everyone and everything,” admits Brisson, also explaining the reason why I take Seroxat each day. Brisson did suffer a stroke upon arriving in La Mort Rouge (who wouldn’t?), but recovered, continuing the deception as an excuse not to be seen around the village and so keep himself safe.\n\nWith the shirts shifting the blame to Brisson, the judge remembers he magnanimously gave a couple of his cast-offs to a limping workman who, replete in second-hand checked shirts, can claim to be Canada’s first grunge fan.\n\nThere’s only one man in La Mort Rouge with a limp and Holmes, Watson and Sgt Thompson find Jack Tanner camping down inside a derelict hotel which makes Journet’s place look like the Ritz. Tanner, a grimy looking cur, claims he’s been away working down river for two days and objects to “making me out as the murderer of Lady Penrose.” “How do you know she was murdered?” snaps Holmes, blowing out the dingy room’s sole candle. “Holmes, the monster!” cries Watson, on seeing what is plainly a lumberjack’s shirt treated with phosphorous, suitable for murderers posing as ghosts, or Kurt Cobain if he’d gone glam.\n\nRumbled, Tanner thumps Sgt. Thompson, dives through a closed window and completes a spectacular escape by diving into the river below. Watson and Thompson fire off a few rounds and are convinced they’ve plugged the murderer. Holmes performs the unsavory task of searching Tanner’s bedding and is rewarded not by cockroaches, rather half of a ripped photograph of a woman signed “To Alistair Ramsen, a great actor.”\n\n“Watson, have you ever stopped to think the science of detection is very much like stringing a handful of beads?” Had Holmes’ analogy involved booze or tobacco it might have landed home, but for Watson’s benefit, the Great Detective explains further: “you might say I have five beads: Tanner, Journet, Brisson, Lord and Lady Penrose…and this is our thread,” Holmes adds, indicating the torn photograph. With Holmes leaving for Lady Penrose (“the dead can tell us many things”), Watson and Thompson head for the bar to celebrate “the death of the monster.”\n\nHolmes hasn’t gone paranormal on us, merely turning to more direct methods, as Lord Penrose points out when he finds the detective breaking into his personal safe inside Penrose Hall: “the great Sherlock Holmes, a common thief.” Holmes ducks this tricky semantic point by asking “who is Alistair Rumsen?” This does the trick and Lord Penrose explains “he murdered a fellow actor in my wife’s company,” after which Lillian Gentry retired from acting and married Lord Penrose *cough*gold-digger*cough*. Ramsen was sentenced to life imprisonment, only to be shot escaping from jail, his body plunging into the St Lawrence.\n\n“Alistair Ramsen is Tanner,” declares Holmes; Ramsen sent Lady Penrose the other half of the picture of herself to warn of her doom. Jack Tanner, a man who never was, is now no more, while his creator Ramsen is very much alive, posing as any one of the inhabitants of La Mort Rouge. This puts Holmes in the unusual position of knowing the murderer without knowing their identity! Holmes learns Judge Brisson sentenced Ramsen at the end of his trial, and so is at risk.\n\nHolmes telephones Brisson, only an impersonator has beaten him to it, advising the judge to chain up old Fido. Telling Brisson to lock up the doors and windows, Holmes leaves Penrose Hall, hoping he can reach the judge in time to save his life. Brisson, in the meantime, calls out for his housekeeper Nora…\n\nBanging on the door, Holmes calls out for Judge Brisson, who instructs Nora to let the detective in. On her way to the door, Nora pauses to rip out Judge Brisson’s throat with a five-pronged garden cultivator, the sort of action that gives housekeepers a bad name. Holmes breaks in only to discover the Judge has received the death penalty. Finding the real Nora tied up in a cupboard, Holmes phones Journet’s to alert Watson and Thompson to Ramsen’s presence at the rundown hotel, where Ramsen may already be adopting yet another persona.\n\nCreeping up the stairs in the old hotel, Holmes unknowingly sets off an alarm, alerting Rumsen. The actor, armed, his face in the shadows, confronts Holmes, shining a torch into his eyes. The detective takes this chance to make jokes, or as close as Holmes gets to jokes, about being in the spotlight, bringing the curtain down on Ramsen, taking a bow and so on. “Your Tanner and Nora were brilliant,” compliments Holmes, “but why kill Lady Penrose?”\n\n“I see no reason why I shouldn’t tell you,” replies Ramsen, in an oddly helpful yet stilted manner. “I couldn’t bear the thought of another man possessing her.” Ramsen’s a romantic at heart, if only he had one. Having silenced the voice who passed sentence upon him, Ramsen has only one person left to kill – aside from Holmes – and just as he’s about to announce who the lucky person is – crash! Watson has put his foot through a rotten stair, taken a tumble and fired off his gun by accident. Bumbling yes, but Watson’s clumsiness saves Holmes’ life as Ramsen departs in haste.\n\nHolmes suspects Journet, the former prison guard, is next on Ramsen’s sore throat list; Watson reveals the hotel owner has vanished. The sleuths must find Journet before Ramsen!\n\nAll is good cheer back at Journet’s hotel, with the sailors and fishermen enjoying a hearty sing-song. Holmes and Watson ask for Marie; postman Potts hasn’t seen her lately. Entering Journet’s office, Holmes finds out why – Marie is dead, and Watson confirms Ramsen has murdered again. Holmes’ initial reaction to Marie’s death is interesting. As his friend approaches Marie’s body to conduct a medical inspection, Holmes can only comment “don’t touch anything, Watson.” Perhaps written as a line of instruction, Rathbone skillfully turns the dialogue into an expression of muted grief.\n\nWhy did Ramsen kill the girl? Holmes hypothesizes Ramsen, in disguise as someone Marie knew, questioned the girl on her father’s whereabouts, and when Marie became suspicious, Ramsen killed her as viciously as his other victims. There follows an exquisite moment of direction when, leaving the murder scene, Holmes gazes at a caged songbird, as the sound of the singing sailors heightens – then dies off (the viewer’s discomfort increases at the thought of Marie’s brutal death played out to the sound of their carousing).\n\nLate the following evening, Holmes returns to the police station having conducted a fruitless search of every location within a five mile radius, a somewhat optimistic hope even for someone with Holmes’ OCD tendencies. With roadblocks in place, Sgt Thompson is confident Ramsen can’t give police the slip. The phone rings; Holmes answers without saying a word. “Watson, get your hat and coat!” This triggers more mumbling from Watson, of a rather tactless nature: “You’re very rude. You leave me here all day with a very dull inspector, and all you say is ‘Watson, get your hat and coat!'”\n\nThe doctor is still grumbling once they reach Judge Brisson’s, the last place the killer would look for Journet. Indeed, Holmes and Watson find the former prison guard hiding within (Holmes recognized the chimes of Brisson’s clock during Journet’s abortive phone call). Holmes entreats Journet to return to the hotel to lure the killer. “Why should I?” asks Journet. Holmes gives him the terrible news about Marie and Journet swears to kill her murderer himself.\n\nMorning, and Watson prepares to leave the Journet Hotel, saying goodbye to his friend Potts and expressing regret that the killer has escaped justice and fled to the US. Emile leaves for church to pray for Marie, while Sgt Thompson is called to visit Holmes in his room.\n\nPotts catches up with Emile Journet on the moor. “Three murders in three days,” tuts the postman. “It’s a shame Marie had to die,” he adds, as he slips a certain garden implement from his sleeve. Potts is the killer, Alistair Ramsen! He attacks Emile, who isn’t all he seems either – it’s Holmes in disguise. Ramsen reveals he killed the real Potts “when he passed his civil service exam and was assigned to La Mort Rouge.” Poor Potts! Killed in his postal prime, and all that revision for nothing.\n\nHolmes blows a whistle and various policemen and villagers encircle the marshes. Ramsen is hemmed in at every turn, and runs into Emile Journet. The two men fight; Journet overpowers the small, slight actor and turns Ramsen’s own weapon against the killer. “Ramsen’s instrument of death is his own executioner,” states Holmes, while Watson has fallen into another boggy hole. Actually, perhaps Watson is a bit of a chump after all.\n\nOn the ride to the harbor for the voyage home, Holmes rhapsodizes about Canada, “the lynchpin of the English-speaking world…the link between two great branches of the human race.” “Churchill say that?” asks Watson. “Yes, Churchill,” says Holmes, as the triumphant backing music drowns out Holmes’ final words of homage.\n\nIMDB reports the unheard words were ‘God bless him,’ presumably a platitude too far even for the flag-waving standards of wartime. Such homilies played their part however; I well recall cheering with excitement on hearing Inspector Lestrade mention my hometown during one of the British-based Rathbone movies, and that was only during a TV showing in the early 1980s, so I can imagine more than a few Canadian chests swelled with pride as Holmes doffed his deerstalker cap in their direction.\n\nAs for Rathbone himself, the man who for decades was Sherlock Holmes, he gives his customary polished performance as the formidable detective, a swan among starlings, with a character as hard and gleaming as a valuable bust of himself, toning it down by the smallest of notches when needing to act in a more sympathetic manner to those around him. Nonetheless, this is a Holmes who is capable of acting first and thinking later if his deductions get the better of him, as in his dash to confront Ramsen in the abandoned hotel. It’s a great shame Rathbone became bored of playing Holmes, believing him unsympathetic, dull, and cruel towards his friend Watson, as the franchise had the potential to last many more years.\n\nAfter the final Universal Holmes picture, Dressed to Kill (1946), Rathbone moved to New York to continue working on the stage, returning to Hollywood in 1954. Within a few years however, Rathbone’s star was on the wane, eventually appearing in B-grade sci-fi fodder such as Queen of Blood (1966). After this, all that was left for Rathbone was beach movie The Ghost in the Invisible Bikini (1966), feeble horror comedy Hillbillys in a Haunted House (1967) and a Mexican movier co-starring John Carradine, Autopsy of a Ghost (1968). In a sad irony, by the time the latter saw release, Rathbone had already been dead for a year.\n\nThe other central performance, aside from Bruce’s redoubtable Watson, comes from Gerald Hamer as Potts, Tanner, and Ramsen. The postman and river worker are convincingly played as if by two different actors, Potts full of chirpy intelligence, Tanner the surly menace, which makes Hamer’s wooden turn as Ramsen all the more puzzling. It’s as if Hamer decided Ramsen, despite his talent for acting, was a shell of a man, one of those unfortunates who finds it impossible to be himself, but the script isn’t really strong enough on an intellectual level to support this reading. For the most part however, Hamer acquits himself well.\n\nDirector Neill puts in some great work and not just with the fog machine, providing the viewer with some intriguing images, such as the first view of Potts, framed by Marie attending to the birdcage, and Holmes and Watson’s discussion with Penrose, viewed from within the living room fireplace. Neill is aided by some delicious photography from George Robinson, who also worked on several of Universal’s monster films and Abbott & Costello films, including Jack and the Beanstalk (1952).\n\nThe Scarlet Claw is a minor gem, pleasing to look at and easy to enjoy despite a morbid nature which includes the horrific murder of a young girl. An atmospheric and engaging mystery film, TSC is the ideal place to start for anyone wishing to dip into the screen adventures of Conan Doyle’s hero, away from the work of the great writer himself."
