        "text": "Cheers, popular American television comedy series that appeared on NBC for 11 seasons (1982–93), ranking in the top 10 of the year-end Nielsen ratings seven times. A mixture of comedy and soap-opera romance, it followed the lives of the staff and patrons of Cheers, a fictional bar in Boston.\n\nCheers’s bartender-owner Sam Malone (played by Ted Danson), a witty former Major League Baseball pitcher, was forever on the make. Graduate student–waitress Diane Chambers (Shelley Long, 1982–87) was the particular object of his affection, and their sparring, filled with sexual tension, provided plenty of humour over the course of their on-again, off-again relationship.\n\nBritannica Quiz\n\nPop Culture Quiz\n\nJoining Sam behind the bar were the absentminded but lovable Coach (Nicholas Colasanto, 1982–85), an associate from Sam’s days with the Red Sox, and, later in the series, Woody Boyd (Woody Harrelson, 1985–93), a naive, dim-witted Hoosier. Rounding out the staff were tiny acid-tongued waitress Carla (Rhea Perlman) and Rebecca Howe (Kirstie Alley, 1987–93). The bar’s manager and Sam’s boss when Cheers was taken over by a corporation, Howe was later reduced to being a waitress when Sam bought back Cheers.\n\nThe regulars in the bar “where everybody knows your name” were Dr. Frasier Crane (Kelsey Grammer, 1984–93), a haughty, insecure psychiatrist; Dr. Lilith Sternin (Bebe Neuwirth, 1986–93), a frosty psychologist who married and then divorced Crane; occasional accountant Norm Peterson (George Wendt); and his best friend, salt-of-the-earth mailman Cliff Clavin (John Ratzenberger)."
