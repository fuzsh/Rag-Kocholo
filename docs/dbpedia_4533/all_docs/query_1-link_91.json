Thus, leaving most, if not all the humor for Watson to convey, such as the rushing off to a medical emergency, and going across the street, seeing the ape umbrella stand and the scene at the Mesmer Club.\n\nIt has been noted that Basil Rathbone regarded Henry Danielle's Moriarty as being \"delectably dangerous\".\n\nEnd Quote:\n\nI’m thinking of all the women that can come and go in safety on the streets of London tonight.

Pursuit to Algiers is not a favorite among Sherlock Holmes fans. David Stuart Davies writes, \"Pursuit to Algiers showed a decided decline in inventiveness and proved to be the weakest of the series.\" However, even the weakest film in a good series can be good entertainment. I find Pursuit to Algiers very enjoyable.\n\nThe film contains a couple of clever in-jokes for Holmes aficionados in the form of references to famous unrecorded cases for the Great Detective: at one point Watson begins to recite the tale of The Giant Rat of Sumatra (mentioned in Conan Doyle's \"The Adventure of the Sussex Vampire\"); whilst the action takes place aboard the S.S. Friesland (from Conan Doyle's \"The Adventure of the Norwood Builder\", and alluded to as \"a Dutch-American liner\" in his Professor Challenger book \"The Lost World\", though here it has links to Malmö in Sweden). The film also borrows some characters and events from \"The Adventure of the Red Circle.\"\n\nEnd Quote:\n\nHolmes: Yes Watson, let me advise you. If you ever consider taking up another profession, never even think of becoming an actor!\n\nMartin Kosleck (Mierko) from 1980:\n\nBasil and I became great friends on the set of The Mad Doctor. We played partners in crime as well as roommates - very avant garde for the time. He and his wife Ouida gave magnificent parties and all of Hollywood attended them. I was invited until Ouida saw our film together. After that, she was very cold and unfriendly to me. I was very aware of her jealousy regarding Basil and he was helpless to intervene. However, by the time we worked on the Holmes film, it was like old times. Basil and I were a team again, even though my part was nothing. I get emotional thinking about how good a friend he was, always trying to get them to give me more lines. I recall telling him not to bother. I was just so glad to be working with my dear friend that the part was of no importance at all.\n\nWatson, Nicklas, Holmes, Mierko (Martin Kosleck), and Gregor playing shuffleboard\n\n\"You're a gracious loser, Mr. Holmes\"\n\nGreat, thanks for that.\n\nSH#13 – Terror By Night (1946)\n\nDirector and Producer – Roy William Neill\n\nWhen the fabled Star of Rhodesia diamond is stolen on a London to Edinburgh train and the son of its owner is murdered, Sherlock Holmes must discover which of his suspicious fellow passengers is responsible.\n\nThe Players\n\nBasil Rathbone-Sherlock Holmes\n\nNigel Bruce-Dr. John H.

Ronald Adair \"had been engaged to Miss Edith Woodley, of Carstairs.\")\n\nThe idea of a secret compartment could be from \"The Disappearance of Lady Frances Carfax.\"\n\n• It is the shortest of the 14 Sherlock Holmes films with Rathbone and Bruce; it was also the biggest budget of any of the Universal Sherlock Holmes films.\n\n• It was Dennis Hoey's last appearance as Lestrade; and\n\nAlan Mowbray (Duncan-Bleek) played Lestrade in the 1933 film A Study in Scarlet.\n\nThe stolen teapot appears to have come from the Beacon Hotel.\n\nThe title is not a Biblical quotation from Psalms 91:5: \"Thou shalt not be afraid for the terror by night\".\n\nHolmes tells Watson that Lestrade is giving a perfect imitation of Izaak Walton. Walton was an English writer of the 17th century and wrote the book; The Complete Angler.\n\nEnd Quote:\n\nMoran: Very clever Holmes, you got me, but you haven’t got the Star of Rhodesia.\n\nHolmes: Oh, but I have. If in the dark I can substitute a big hulk like Lestrade for you, Colonel Moran, it’s no very great feat to switch a little thing like a diamond.\n\nExcerpt from Michael Hoey’s (son of Dennis Hoey) 2011 book about the music scores used in the Universal Sherlock Holmes series:\n\nWith a tight 60 minute running time, Terror By Night was the shortest of all the Sherlock Holmes films. For some reason it began with an entirely new fanfare, replacing the theme that traditionally played over the Universal letters circling the globe, but then the film reverted to the standard Sherlock Holmes main title music. It is interesting to note that Sherlock Holmes Faces Death was the first film in the series not to have an original music score written. Universal’s attitude regarding the music used in its films seemed to be based largely on economics. Composers were hired to write the music for the studio’s larger budgeted films and the scores would be kept in the music library to be used over and over again in less important films. Frank Skinner wrote the original music for The Voice Of Terror, The Secret Weapon and In Washington. He had been under contract from Universal since 1936 and had written the scores for such films as Son Of Frankenstein (1939), Destry Rides Again (1939) and Tower Of London (1939). In the later years he would compose the music for Frances (1950), All That Heaven Allows (1955) and The Ugly American (1963). All of the nine remaining Sherlock Holmes films reused Skinners compositions, as well as the library music selected from various others composers’ works, that was rearranged and rerecorded with an orchestra to fit the timings for the new films. Skinner’s theme for the Sherlock Holmes main title would be repeated in everyone one of the subsequent films. A musical director would be assigned to select the appropriate music and conduct the orchestra on the scoring session. In later years, studios could use “canned music” to score their TV shows, but in the 1940s the American Federation of Musicians and its leader James C. Petrillo demanded that each score be recorded by an orchestra. At first, these musical directors, most of whom were under contract to Universal and composers in there own right, Hans J. Salter, who was musical director under Faces Death and The Spider Woman.\n\nTowards the end of the series however, the studio began using musical directors who were not predominantly composers such as Mark Levant (The Woman In Green), who had been the concert master for Metro, Edgar Fairchild (Pursuit To Algiers) who had been at the studio for many years and had been Deanna Durbin’s musical director, and Milton Rosen (Terror By Night and Dressed To Kill), who had contributed to many Universal films and serials. By 1946, the studio was in a midst of transition and soon would be controlled by the former president of RKO Pictures, Leo Spitz, and the former 20th Century-Fox executive, William Goetz. Perhaps that was the reason that Milton Rosen chose to have both Terror By Night and Dressed To Kill begin with dramatic new fanfare, replacing the old theme that traditionally played over the Universal logo. By the end of the year, the logo itself would be gone, and an entirely new image would introduce Universal-International Pictures, the studio’s new name, on all it’s forthcoming films. An edict would announce, “henceforth no feature that bore the Universal-International imprimatur would run under 70 minutes.” The day of the studio’s B pictures was coming to an end, but there was still time for one last Sherlock Holmes film that would begin life as Prelude To Murder.\n\nSH#14 – Dressed To Kill (1946) (Prelude to Murder, UK title: Sherlock Holmes and The Secret Code)\n\nDirector and Producer – Roy William Neill\n\nA convicted thief in Dartmoor prison hides the location of the stolen Bank of England printing plates inside three music boxes.

There's a great cameo by Edmund Breon as 'Stinky' Emery, and the glamorous Patricia Morison plays Mrs Hilda Courtney; a villain with a dab hand at disguise. Courtney leads a criminal gang that's in a race against Holmes to recover the Bank Of England's printing plates for £5 notes, hidden somewhere in London by her gaoled accomplice.\n\nReferences to 2 actual Sherlock Holmes stories, A Scandal in Bohemia, and the Solitary Cyclist. The smoke bomb ploy was adapted from Scandal in Bohemia as mentioned by Holmes in the story. Certainly the mention of Irene Adler was to be a metaphor for this story involving Hilda Courtney.\n\nDuring the UCLA Sherlock Holmes Restoration Project (1993-2003) they were unable to find any 35mm elements of the main title for this film. The restored version uses a blow-up from a used 16mm television syndication print which was dissolved into the proper point. The main title of the restored version shows a decrease in resolution, increased grain and a reduction in image registration.\n\nVisiting the Universal commissary for her lunch whilst still wearing Hilda Courtney's cockney disguise, Patricia Morison was sternly ordered by the maitre d' to eat with the rest of the extras at the counter, rather than at the actors' tables.\n\nFinal Quote:\n\nHopkins: I still don’t understand how you solved it, Mr. Holmes.\n\nHolmes: It’s entirely due to Dr. Watson. He gave me the clue when he mentioned Dr. Samuel Johnson.\n\nHopkins: Well congratulations, doctor!\n\nWatson: I don’t think I could have done it entirely without Mr. Holmes’ help, you know."
