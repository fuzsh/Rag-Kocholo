        "text": "1. Philip St. John Basil Rathbone was born in Johannesburg, South Africa in 1892.\n\n2. Basil Rathbone rose to prominence in the United Kingdom as a Shakespearean stage actor.\n\n3. Basil Rathbone fought in the British Army during World War I and was awarded the Military Cross for bravery under fire.\n\n4. Basil Rathbone Is generally considered the greatest swordsman in Hollywood history, superior even to on-screen foes Errol Flynn and Tyrone Power. However, because he was so frequently cast as the villain, he won only two on-screen duels in his career–as Tybalt in Romeo and Juliet (1936), for which he earned an Oscar nomination, and as Capt. Esteban Pascuale against the friar (Eugene Pallette), who was so outclassed by “the Capitan” he was harmlessly disarmed in a matter of seconds, in The Mark of Zorro (1940). His last, filmed when the actor was 63, was with Danny Kaye in The Court Jester (1955). It is considered by some the best sword fight ever filmed."
