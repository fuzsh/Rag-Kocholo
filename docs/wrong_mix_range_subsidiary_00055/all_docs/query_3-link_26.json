        "text": "Automatic labeling of MR brain images through extensible learning and atlas forests.\n\nPubMed\n\nXu, Lijun; Liu, Hong; Song, Enmin; Yan, Meng; Jin, Renchao; Hung, Chih-Cheng\n\n2017-12-01\n\nMultiatlas-based method is extensively used in MR brain images segmentation because of its simplicity and robustness. This method provides excellent accuracy although it is time consuming and limited in terms of obtaining information about new atlases. In this study, an automatic labeling of MR brain images through extensible learning and atlas forest is presented to address these limitations. We propose an extensible learning model which allows the multiatlas-based framework capable of managing the datasets with numerous atlases or dynamic atlas datasets and simultaneously ensure the accuracy of automatic labeling. Two new strategies are used to reduce the time and space complexity and improve the efficiency of the automatic labeling of brain MR images. First, atlases are encoded to atlas forests through random forest technology to reduce the time consumed for cross-registration between atlases and target image, and a scatter spatial vector is designed to eliminate errors caused by inaccurate registration. Second, an atlas selection method based on the extensible learning model is used to select atlases for target image without traversing the entire dataset and then obtain the accurate labeling. The labeling results of the proposed method were evaluated in three public datasets, namely, IBSR, LONI LPBA40, and ADNI. With the proposed method, the dice coefficient metric values on the three datasets were 84.17 Â± 4.61%, 83.25 Â± 4.29%, and 81.88 Â± 4.53% which were 5% higher than those of the conventional method, respectively. The efficiency of the extensible learning model was evaluated by state-of-the-art methods for labeling of MR brain images. Experimental results showed that the proposed method could achieve accurate labeling for MR brain images without traversing the entire datasets. In the proposed multiatlas-based method, extensible learning and atlas forests were applied to control the automatic labeling of brain anatomies on large atlas datasets or dynamic\n\n5.

To describe a technique to measure interspinous process distance using ultrasound (US) imaging, to assess the reliability of the technique, and to compare the US imaging measurements to magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) measurements in 3 different positions of the lumbar spine. Segmental spinal motion has been assessed using various imaging techniques, as well as surgically inserted pins. However, some imaging techniques are costly (MRI) and some require ionizing radiation (radiographs and fluoroscopy), and surgical procedures have limited use because of the invasive nature of the technique. Therefore, it is important to have an easily accessible and inexpensive technique for measuring lumbar segmental motion to more fully understand spine motion in vivo, to evaluate the changes that occur with various interventions, and to be able to accurately relate the changes in symptoms to changes in motion of individual vertebral segments. Six asymptomatic subjects participated. The distance between spinous processes at each lumbar segment (L1-2, L2-3, L3-4, L4-5) was measured digitally using MRI and US imaging. The interspinous distance was measured with subjects supine and the lumbar spine in 3 different positions (resting, lumbar flexion, and lumbar extension) for both MRI and US imaging. The differences in distance from neutral to extension, neutral to flexion, and extension to flexion were calculated. The measurement methods had excellent reliability for US imaging (intraclass correlation coefficient [ICC3,3] = 0.94; 95% confidence interval: 0.85, 0.97) and MRI (ICC3,3 = 0.98; 95% confidence interval: 0.95, 0.99). The distance measured was similar between US imaging and MRI (P>.05), except at L3-4 flexion-extension (P = .003). On average, the MRI measurements were 1.3 mm greater than the US imaging measurements. This study describes a new method for the measurement of lumbar spine segmental flexion and extension motion using US\n\n22.

This extensible language is based on an object oriented design by introducing constraint processing. Any kind of services including imaging in the extensible language is controlled by the constraints. Interactive functions between client and server are extended by introducing agent functions including a request-respond relation. Necessary service integrations are satisfied with some cooperative processes using constraints. Constraints are treated similarly to data, because the system should have flexibilities in the execution of many kinds of services. The similar control process is defined by using intentional logic. There are two kinds of constraints, temporal and modal constraints. Rendering the constraints, the predicate format as the relation between attribute values can be a warrant for entities' validity as data. As an imaging example, a processing procedure of interaction between multiple objects is shown as an image application for the extensible system. This paper describes how the procedure proceeds in the system, and that how the constraints work for generating moving pictures.\n\nAdvanced Forensic Format: an Open Extensible Format for Disk Imaging\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nGarfinkel, Simson; Malan, David; Dubec, Karl-Alexander; Stevens, Christopher; Pham, Cecile\n\nThis paper describes the Advanced Forensic Format (AFF), which is designed as an alternative to current proprietary disk image formats. AFF offers two significant benefits. First, it is more flexible because it allows extensive metadata to be stored with images. Second, AFF images consume less disk space than images in other formats (e.g., EnCase images). This paper also describes the Advanced Disk Imager, a new program for acquiring disk images that compares favorably with existing alternatives.\n\nRadiology and Enterprise Medical Imaging Extensions (REMIX).\n\nPubMed\n\nErdal, Barbaros S; Prevedello, Luciano M; Qian, Songyue; Demirer, Mutlu; Little, Kevin; Ryu, John; O'Donnell, Thomas; White, Richard D\n\n2018-02-01\n\nRadiology and Enterprise Medical Imaging Extensions (REMIX) is a platform originally designed to both support the medical imaging-driven clinical and clinical research operational needs of Department of Radiology of The Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center. REMIX accommodates the storage and handling of \"big imaging data,\" as needed for large multi-disciplinary cancer-focused programs. The evolving REMIX platform contains an array of integrated tools/software packages for the following: (1) server and storage management; (2) image reconstruction; (3) digital pathology; (4) de-identification; (5) business intelligence; (6) texture analysis; and (7) artificial intelligence. These capabilities, along with documentation and guidance, explaining how to interact with a commercial system (e.g., PACS, EHR, commercial database) that currently exists in clinical environments, are to be made freely available.\n\n21.

N.; Looney, P. T.; Young, K. C.; Halling-Brown, M. D.\n\n2015-03-01\n\nRadiological imaging is fundamental within the healthcare industry and has become routinely adopted for diagnosis, disease monitoring and treatment planning. With the advent of digital imaging modalities and the rapid growth in both diagnostic and therapeutic imaging, the ability to be able to harness this large influx of data is of paramount importance. The Oncology Medical Image Database (OMI-DB) was created to provide a centralized, fully annotated dataset for research. The database contains both processed and unprocessed images, associated data, and annotations and where applicable expert determined ground truths describing features of interest. Medical imaging provides the ability to detect and localize many changes that are important to determine whether a disease is present or a therapy is effective by depicting alterations in anatomic, physiologic, biochemical or molecular processes. Quantitative imaging features are sensitive, specific, accurate and reproducible imaging measures of these changes. Here, we describe an extension to the OMI-DB whereby a range of imaging features and descriptors are pre-calculated using a high throughput approach. The ability to calculate multiple imaging features and data from the acquired images would be valuable and facilitate further research applications investigating detection, prognosis, and classification. The resultant data store contains more than 10 million quantitative features as well as features derived from CAD predictions. Theses data can be used to build predictive models to aid image classification, treatment response assessment as well as to identify prognostic imaging biomarkers.\n\nDevelopment of estimation system of knee extension strength using image features in ultrasound images of rectus femoris\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nMurakami, Hiroki; Watanabe, Tsuneo; Fukuoka, Daisuke; Terabayashi, Nobuo; Hara, Takeshi; Muramatsu, Chisako; Fujita, Hiroshi\n\n2016-04-01\n\nThe word \"Locomotive syndrome\" has been proposed to describe the state of requiring care by musculoskeletal disorders and its high-risk condition. Reduction of the knee extension strength is cited as one of the risk factors, and the accurate measurement of the strength is needed for the evaluation. The measurement of knee extension strength using a dynamometer is one of the most direct and quantitative methods. This study aims to develop a system for measuring the knee extension strength using the ultrasound images of the rectus femoris muscles obtained with non-invasive ultrasonic diagnostic equipment. First, we extract the muscle area from the ultrasound images and determine the image features, such as the thickness of the muscle. We combine these features and physical features, such as the patient's height, and build a regression model of the knee extension strength from training data. We have developed a system for estimating the knee extension strength by applying the regression model to the features obtained from test data. Using the test data of 168 cases, correlation coefficient value between the measured values and estimated values was 0.82. This result suggests that this system can estimate knee extension strength with high accuracy.\n\nOpen source database of images DEIMOS: extension for large-scale subjective image quality assessment\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nVÃ­tek, Stanislav\n\n2014-09-01\n\nDEIMOS (Database of Images: Open Source) is an open-source database of images and video sequences for testing, verification and comparison of various image and/or video processing techniques such as compression, reconstruction and enhancement. This paper deals with extension of the database allowing performing large-scale web-based subjective image quality assessment. Extension implements both administrative and client interface. The proposed system is aimed mainly at mobile communication devices, taking into account advantages of HTML5 technology; it means that participants don't need to install any application and assessment could be performed using web browser. The assessment campaign administrator can select images from the large database and then apply rules defined by various test procedure recommendations. The standard test procedures may be fully customized and saved as a template. Alternatively the administrator can define a custom test, using images from the pool and other components, such as evaluating forms and ongoing questionnaires. Image sequence is delivered to the online client, e.g. smartphone or tablet, as a fully automated assessment sequence or viewer can decide on timing of the assessment if required. Environmental data and viewing conditions (e.g. illumination, vibrations, GPS coordinates, etc.), may be collected and subsequently analyzed.\n\nPredictive value of magnetic resonance imaging determined tumor contact length for extracapsular extension of prostate cancer.\n\nPubMed\n\nBaco, Eduard; Rud, Erik; Vlatkovic, Ljiljana; Svindland, Aud; EggesbÃ¸, Heidi B; Hung, Andrew J; Matsugasumi, Toru; Bernhard, Jean-Christophe; Gill, Inderbir S; Ukimura, Osamu\n\n2015-02-01\n\nTumor contact length is defined as the amount of prostate cancer in contact with the prostatic capsule. We evaluated the ability of magnetic resonance imaging determined tumor contact length to predict microscopic extracapsular extension compared to existing predictors of extracapsular extension. We retrospectively analyzed the records of 111 consecutive patients with magnetic resonance imaging/ultrasound fusion targeted, biopsy proven prostate cancer who underwent radical prostatectomy from January 2010 to July 2013. Median patient age was 64 years and median prostate specific antigen was 8.9 ng/ml. Clinical stage was cT1 in 93 cases (84%) and cT2 in 18 (16%). Postoperative pathological analysis confirmed pT2 in 71 patients (64%) and pT3 in 40 (36%). We evaluated 1) in the radical prostatectomy specimen the correlation of microscopic extracapsular extension with pathological cancer volume, pathological tumor contact length and Gleason score, 2) the correlation between microscopic extracapsular extension and magnetic resonance imaging tumor contact length, and 3) the ability of preoperative variables to predict microscopic extracapsular extension. Logistic regression analysis revealed that pathological tumor contact length correlated better with microscopic extracapsular extension than the predictive power of pathological cancer volume (0.821 vs 0.685). The Spearman correlation between pathological and magnetic resonance imaging tumor contact length was r = 0.839 (p <0.0001). ROC AUC analysis revealed that magnetic resonance imaging tumor contact length outperformed cancer core involvement on targeted biopsy and the Partin tables to predict microscopic extracapsular extension (0.88 vs 0.70 and 0.63, respectively). At a magnetic resonance imaging tumor contact length threshold of 20 mm the accuracy for diagnosing microscopic extracapsular extension was superior to that of conventional magnetic resonance imaging criteria (82% vs 67%, p = 0.015). We developed a\n\nNon-Gaussian Distribution of DNA Barcode Extension In Nanochannels Using High-throughput Imaging\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nSheats, Julian; Reinhart, Wesley; Reifenberger, Jeff; Gupta, Damini; Muralidhar, Abhiram; Cao, Han; Dorfman, Kevin\n\n2015-03-01\n\nWe present experimental data for the extension of internal segments of highly confined DNA using a high-Â­throughput experimental setup. BarcodeÂ­-labeled E. coli genomic DNA molecules were imaged at a high areal density in square nanochannels with sizes ranging from 40 nm to 51 nm in width. Over 25,000 molecules were used to obtain more than 1,000,000 measurements for genomic distances between 2,500 bp and 100,000 bp. The distribution of extensions has positive excess kurtosis and is skewÂ­ left due to weak backfolding in the channel. As a result, the two Odijk theories for the chain extension and variance bracket the experimental data. We compared to predictions of a harmonic approximation for the confinement free energy and show that it produces a substantial error in the variance. These results suggest an inherent error associated with any statistical analysis of barcoded DNA that relies on harmonic models for chain extension.

In the field of light microscopy, the Bio-Formats library was designed to translate such proprietary data formats to a common, open-source schema, enabling sharing and reproduction of scientific results. While Bio-Formats has proved successful for microscopy images, the greater scientific community was lacking a domain-independent framework for format translation. SCIFIO (SCientific Image Format Input and Output) is presented as a freely available, open-source library unifying the mechanisms of reading and writing image data. The core of SCIFIO is its modular definition of formats, the design of which clearly outlines the components of image I/O to encourage extensibility, facilitated by the dynamic discovery of the SciJava plugin framework. SCIFIO is structured to support coexistence of multiple domain-specific open exchange formats, such as Bio-Formats' OME-TIFF, within a unified environment. SCIFIO is a freely available software library developed to standardize the process of reading and writing scientific image formats.\n\nMedXViewer: an extensible web-enabled software package for medical imaging\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nLooney, P. T.; Young, K. C.; Mackenzie, Alistair; Halling-Brown, Mark D.\n\n2014-03-01\n\nMedXViewer (Medical eXtensible Viewer) is an application designed to allow workstation-independent, PACS-less viewing and interaction with anonymised medical images (e.g. observer studies). The application was initially implemented for use in digital mammography and tomosynthesis but the flexible software design allows it to be easily extended to other imaging modalities. Regions of interest can be identified by a user and any associated information about a mark, an image or a study can be added. The questions and settings can be easily configured depending on the need of the research allowing both ROC and FROC studies to be performed. The extensible nature of the design allows for other functionality and hanging protocols to be available for each study. Panning, windowing, zooming and moving through slices are all available while modality-specific features can be easily enabled e.g. quadrant zooming in mammographic studies. MedXViewer can integrate with a web-based image database allowing results and images to be stored centrally. The software and images can be downloaded remotely from this centralised data-store. Alternatively, the software can run without a network connection where the images and results can be encrypted and stored locally on a machine or external drive. Due to the advanced workstation-style functionality, the simple deployment on heterogeneous systems over the internet without a requirement for administrative access and the ability to utilise a centralised database, MedXViewer has been used for running remote paper-less observer studies and is capable of providing a training infrastructure and co-ordinating remote collaborative viewing sessions (e.g. cancer reviews, interesting cases).\n\nEMAN2: an extensible image processing suite for electron microscopy.\n\nPubMed\n\nTang, Guang; Peng, Liwei; Baldwin, Philip R; Mann, Deepinder S; Jiang, Wen; Rees, Ian; Ludtke, Steven J\n\n2007-01-01\n\nEMAN is a scientific image processing package with a particular focus on single particle reconstruction from transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images. It was first released in 1999, and new versions have been released typically 2-3 times each year since that time. EMAN2 has been under development for the last two years, with a completely refactored image processing library, and a wide range of features to make it much more flexible and extensible than EMAN1. The user-level programs are better documented, more straightforward to use, and written in the Python scripting language, so advanced users can modify the programs' behavior without any recompilation. A completely rewritten 3D transformation class simplifies translation between Euler angle standards and symmetry conventions. The core C++ library has over 500 functions for image processing and associated tasks, and it is modular with introspection capabilities, so programmers can add new algorithms with minimal effort and programs can incorporate new capabilities automatically. Finally, a flexible new parallelism system has been designed to address the shortcomings in the rigid system in EMAN1.\n\nShading correction algorithm for cone-beam CT in radiotherapy: extensive clinical validation of image quality improvement\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nJoshi, K. D.; Marchant, T. E.; Moore, C. J.\n\n2017-03-01\n\nA shading correction algorithm for the improvement of cone-beam CT (CBCT) images (Phys. Med. Biol. 53 5719{33) has been further developed, optimised and validated extensively using 135 clinical CBCT images of patients undergoing radiotherapy treatment of the pelvis, lungs and head and neck. An automated technique has been developed to efficiently analyse the large number of clinical images. Small regions of similar tissue (for example fat tissue) are automatically identified using CT images. The same regions on the corresponding CBCT image are analysed to ensure that they do not contain pixels representing multiple types of tissue. The mean value of all selected pixels and the non-uniformity, defined as the median absolute deviation of the mean values in each small region, are calculated. Comparisons between CT and raw and corrected CBCT images are then made. Analysis of fat regions in pelvis images shows an average difference in mean pixel value between CT and CBCT of 136:0 HU in raw CBCT images, which is reduced to 2:0 HU after the application of the shading correction algorithm. The average difference in non-uniformity of fat pixels is reduced from 33:7 in raw CBCT to 2:8 in shading-corrected CBCT images. Similar results are obtained in the analysis of lung and head and neck images.\n\nNew NASA Infrared Image of Irma Shows an Angry Eye\n\nNASA Image and Video Library\n\n2017-09-05\n\nHurricane Irma is the strongest hurricane ever recorded outside the Caribbean Sea and Gulf of Mexico. These two images from the Atmospheric Infrared Sounder (AIRS) instrument aboard NASA's Aqua satellite show what Hurricane Irma looked like when Aqua passed overhead just before 1 p.m. local time (10 a.m. PDT) on Sept. 5, 2017. Forecasts at the National Hurricane Center have Irma passing near the major islands to its west before turning northward near Florida this weekend. The first image (top) is an infrared snapshot from AIRS (see Figure 1 for larger image). In orange and red areas, the ocean surface shines through, while blue and purple areas represent cold, high clouds that obscure what lies below. Typical of well-developed hurricanes, Irma is nearly circular with a well-defined eye at its center. The eye is about 25 miles (40 kilometers) in diameter. Careful scrutiny shows a red pixel in the center of the eye, which means that AIRS achieved a bulls-eye with one of its \"looks\" and was able to see to the ocean between the dense clouds in the eye wall. The second image (bottom) shows the view through AIRS' microwave-colored \"lenses\" (see Figure 2 for larger image). Here the ocean surface looks yellow, while green represents various degrees of cloudiness. Blue shows areas where it is raining heavily. The eye is not apparent in this image because the \"pixel size\" of the microwave sounder, about 30 miles (50 kilometers), is larger than the eye and therefore cannot \"thread the needle.\" The infrared sounder, on the other hand, has a pixel size of only 10 miles (16.5 kilometers) and can distinguish the small eye. https://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA21941\n\nEndorectal MR imaging of prostate cancer: Evaluation of tumor capsular contact length as a sign of extracapsular extension.\n\nPubMed\n\nMendez, Gustavo; Foster, Bryan R; Li, Xin; Shannon, Jackilen; Garzotto, Mark; Amling, Christopher L; Coakley, Fergus V\n\n2018-04-25\n\nTo evaluate the length of contact between dominant tumor foci and the prostatic capsule as a sign of extracapsular extension at endorectal multiparametric MR imaging. We retrospectively identified 101 patients over a three-year interval who underwent endorectal multiparametric prostate MR imaging prior to radical prostatectomy for prostate cancer. Two readers identified the presence of dominant tumor focus (largest lesion with PI-RADS version 2 score of 4 or 5), and measured the length of tumor capsular contact and likelihood of extracapsular extension by standard criteria (1-5 Likert scale). Results were analyzed using histopathological review as reference standard. Extracapsular extension was found at histopathological review in 27 patients. Reader 1 (2) identified dominant tumor in 79 (73) patients, with mean tumor capsular contact length of 18.2 (14.0) mm. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve for identification of extracapsular extension by tumor capsular contact length was 0.76 for reader 1 and 0.77 for reader 2, with optimal discrimination at values of 18â¯mm and 21â¯mm, respectively. In the subset of patients without obvious extracapsular extension by standard criteria (Likert scores 1-3), corresponding values were 0.74 and 0.66 with optimal thresholds of 24 and 21â¯mm. Length of contact between the dominant tumor focus and the capsule is a moderately useful sign of extracapsular extension at endorectal multiparametric prostate MR imaging, including the subset of patients without obvious extracapsular extension by standard criteria, with optimal discrimination at threshold values of 18 to 24â¯mm.

Electric field imaging (EFI) technology may be applied to characterize intrinsic or existing electric potentials and electric fields, or an externally generated electrostatic field made be used for volumes to be inspected with EFI. The baseline sensor technology (e-Sensor) and its construction, optional electric field generation (quasi-static generator), and current e- Sensor enhancements (ephemeral e-Sensor) are discussed. Critical design elements of current linear and real-time two-dimensional (2D) measurement systems are highlighted, and the development of a three dimensional (3D) EFI system is presented. Demonstrations for structural, electronic, human, and memory applications are shown. Recent work demonstrates that phonons may be used to create and annihilate electric dipoles within structures. Phonon induced dipoles are ephemeral and their polarization, strength, and location may be quantitatively characterized by EFI providing a new subsurface Phonon-EFI imaging technology. Results from real-time imaging of combustion and ion flow, and their measurement complications, will be discussed. Extensions to environment, Space and subterranean applications will be presented, and initial results for quantitative characterizing material properties are shown. A wearable EFI system has been developed by using fundamental EFI concepts. These new EFI capabilities are demonstrated to characterize electric charge distribution creating a new field of study embracing areas of interest including electrostatic discharge (ESD) mitigation, manufacturing quality control, crime scene forensics, design and materials selection for advanced sensors, combustion science, on-orbit space potential, container inspection, remote characterization of electronic circuits and level of activation, dielectric morphology of\n\nNASA's SDO Shows Images of Significant Solar Flare\n\nNASA Image and Video Library\n\n2017-12-08\n\nCaption: An X-class solar flare erupted on the left side of the sun on the evening of Feb. 24, 2014.

Credit: NASA/SDO More info: The sun emitted a significant solar flare, peaking at 7:49 p.m. EST on Feb. 24, 2014. NASA's Solar Dynamics Observatory, which keeps a constant watch on the sun, captured images of the event. Solar flares are powerful bursts of radiation, appearing as giant flashes of light in the SDO images. Harmful radiation from a flare cannot pass through Earth's atmosphere to physically affect humans on the ground, however -- when intense enough -- they can disturb the atmosphere in the layer where GPS and communications signals travel. This flare is classified as an X4.9-class flare. X-class denotes the most intense flares, while the number provides more information about its strength. An X2 is twice as intense as an X1, an X3 is three times as intense, etc. NASA image use policy.

The images are available at: http://asterweb.jpl.nasa.gov/default.htm. In the image on the left, acquired in November 2000, vegetation can be seen in red. The image on the right, acquired at the same time by a different spectral band of the instrument, is color-coded to show the bottom of the lake around the shoreline. Where the data are black, the bottom cannot be seen. Scientists monitoring the lake's water clarity from boat measurements obtained since 1965 have discovered that the lake along the California-Nevada border has lost more than one foot of visibility each year, according to the Lake Tahoe Watershed Assessment, a review of scientific information about the lake undertaken at the request of President Clinton and published in February 2000. The most likely causes are increases in algal growth, sediment washed in from surrounding areas and urban growth and development. http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA03854\n\nExperimental research on showing automatic disappearance pen handwriting based on spectral imaging technology\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nSu, Yi; Xu, Lei; Liu, Ningning; Huang, Wei; Xu, Xiaojing\n\n2016-10-01\n\nPurpose to find an efficient, non-destructive examining method for showing the disappearing words after writing with automatic disappearance pen.

Hot solar material can be seen hovering above the active region in the sun's atmosphere, the corona. Credit: NASA/SDO More info: The sun emitted a significant solar flare, peaking at 7:49 p.m. EST on Feb. 24, 2014. NASA's Solar Dynamics Observatory, which keeps a constant watch on the sun, captured images of the event. Solar flares are powerful bursts of radiation, appearing as giant flashes of light in the SDO images. Harmful radiation from a flare cannot pass through Earth's atmosphere to physically affect humans on the ground, however -- when intense enough -- they can disturb the atmosphere in the layer where GPS and communications signals travel. This flare is classified as an X4.9-class flare. X-class denotes the most intense flares, while the number provides more information about its strength. An X2 is twice as intense as an X1, an X3 is three times as intense, etc. NASA image use policy.

The scientists used the National Science Foundation's Very Large Array (VLA) radio telescope in New Mexico and the Westerbork Synthesis Radio Telescope (WSRT) in the Netherlands to produce an image of the galaxy M33, known to amateur astronomers as the Pinwheel Galaxy. Doppler-Shift Image of M33's Gas \"An image with the level of detail we have achieved opens the door to learning fundamental new facts about the relationship between massive stars and the galaxy's complicated gaseous environment. This, in turn, will help us better understand how galaxies age,\" said David Thilker, of the National Radio Astronomy Observatory (NRAO) in Socorro, NM. Thilker worked with Robert Braun of the Netherlands Foundation for Research in Astronomy and Rene Walterbos of New Mexico State University in Las Cruces. The scientists reported their findings today at the American Astronomical Society's meeting in San Diego, CA. The VLA and WSRT received radio waves at a wavelength of 21 centimeters that are naturally emitted by Hydrogen atoms. Using this data, the astronomers produced images showing the distribution of neutral atomic Hydrogen in M33. In addition, because the atoms emit at a very specific wavelength, the scientists could detect the galaxy's rotation by tuning the telescopes' radio receivers to receive radio waves whose length has been changed by Doppler shifting. The new images show details of the galaxy smaller than 130 light-years. \"With more computer processing, we will be able to see features as small as 65 light-years,\" Thilker said. \"This, we believe, will allow us to see 'bubbles' in the galaxy's gas that have been inflated as the result of one or more supernova explosions,\" Thilker added. At a distance from Earth of about 2.7 million light-years, M33 is a member of the Local Group of galaxies, which\n\nLEANTO INTERIOR, LOOKING EAST.

As therapeutics have evolved and multiplied in number, the tumor metrics criteria used to characterize therapeutic response have become progressively more varied and complex. The growing intricacies of image-based response evaluation, together with rising expectations for rapid and consistent results reporting, make it difficult for site radiologists to adequately address local and multicenter imaging demands. These challenges demonstrate the need for advanced cancer imaging informatics tools that can help ensure protocol-compliant image evaluation while simultaneously promoting reviewer efficiency. LesionTracker is a quantitative imaging package optimized for oncology clinical trial workflows. The goal of the project is to create an open source zero-footprint viewer for image analysis that is designed to be extensible as well as capable of being integrated into third-party systems for advanced imaging tools and clinical trials informatics platforms.

We retrospectively assessed the ability of this imaging technique to predict side-specific extracapsular extension of prostate cancer. From October 2007 to August 2011, prostatectomy was carried out in 396 patients after preoperative 3.0-Tesla magnetic resonance imaging. Among these, 132 (primary sample) and 134 patients (validation sample) underwent 12-core prostate biopsy at the National Cancer Center Hospital of Tokyo, Japan, and at other institutions, respectively. In the primary dataset, univariate and multivariate analyses were carried out to predict side-specific extracapsular extension using variables determined preoperatively, including 3.0-Tesla magnetic resonance imaging findings (T2-weighted and diffusion-weighted imaging). A prediction model was then constructed and applied to the validation study sample. Multivariate analysis identified four significant independent predictors (Pâ<â0.05), including a biopsy Gleason score of â¥8, positive 3.0-Tesla diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging findings, â¥2 positive biopsy cores on each side and a maximum percentage of positive cores â¥31% on each side. The negative predictive value was 93.9% in the combination model with these four predictors, meanwhile the positive predictive value was 33.8%. Good reproducibility of these four significant predictors and the combination model was observed in the validation study sample. The side-specific extracapsular extension prediction by the biopsy Gleason score and factors associated with tumor location, including a positive 3.0-Tesla diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging finding, have a high negative predictive value, but a low positive predictive value.

In this study, we have addressed the issues on multi-scale image segmentation, especially, in improving the performances for validity of merging and variety of derived region's shape. Firstly, we have introduced constraints on the application of spectral criterion which could suppress excessive merging between dissimilar regions. Secondly, we have extended the evaluation for smoothness criterion by modifying the definition on the extent of the object, which was brought for controlling the shape's diversity. Thirdly, we have developed new shape criterion called aspect ratio. This criterion helps to improve the reproducibility on the shape of object to be matched to the actual objectives of interest. This criterion provides constraint on the aspect ratio in the bounding box of object by keeping properties controlled with conventional shape criteria. These improvements and extensions lead to more accurate, flexible, and diverse segmentation results according to the shape characteristics of the target of interest. Furthermore, we also investigated a technique for quantitative and automatic parameterization in multi-scale image segmentation. This approach is achieved by comparing segmentation result with training area specified in advance by considering the maximization of the average area in derived objects or satisfying the evaluation index called F-measure. Thus, it has been possible to automate the parameterization that suited the objectives especially in the view point of shape's reproducibility.\n\nThis image, looking due south shows the central part of ...\n\nLibrary of Congress Historic Buildings Survey, Historic Engineering Record, Historic Landscapes Survey\n\nThis image, looking due south shows the central part of the north wing of the building, a 2 story facade.

These formats are only able partly to solve problems arising in accessing and handling imags. To solve such problems, an ontology dedicated to the description of data and knowledge involved in the handling and the management of medical images has been designed. The ontology offers a semantic frame of reference to which manipulation tools can refer. It considers various point of view on the data, related to the context of production, the content,and the data quality. It supports several levels of abstraction, going from a declarative level related to the examination type to the implementation level. Moreover, the ontology provides mechanisms allowing the creation and the description of new entities. It can, thus, act as an intermediate language ensuring accurate reuse of the entities. This paper, which presents work in progress, is focused on the description of the ontology and points out how to use it for the description of and the access to DICOM or INTERFILE entities, and for the extension of the DICOM or INTERFILE dictionaries, by adding new entities, in order to describe complex relationships between images.\n\nDorsal midbrain syndrome associated with persistent neck extension: Clinical and diagnostic imaging findings in 2 dogs\n\nPubMed Central\n\nCanal, Sara; Baroni, Massimo; Falzone, Cristian; De Benedictis, Giulia M.; Bernardini, Marco\n\n2015-01-01\n\nTwo young dogs were evaluated for an acute onset of abnormal head posture and eye movement.

This scene memory error, known as boundary extension, has been suggested to occur due to an observer's failure to differentiate between the contributing sources of information, including the sensory input, amodal continuation beyond the view boundaries, and contextual associations with the main objects and depicted scene locations (Intraub, 2010). Here, \"scenes\" made of abstract shapes on random-dot backgrounds, previously shown to elicit boundary extension (McDunn, Siddiqui, & Brown Psychonomic Bulletin & Review, 21, 370-375, 2014), were compared with versions made with extremal edges (Palmer & Ghose Psychological Science, 19, 77-84, 2008) added to their borders, in order to examine how boundary extension is influenced when amodal continuation at the borders' view boundaries is manipulated in this way. Extremal edges were expected to reduce boundary extension as compared to the same scenes without them, because extremal edge boundaries explicitly indicate an image's end (i.e., they do not continue past the view boundary). A large and a small difference (16 % and 40 %) between the close and wide-angle views shown during the experiment were tested to examine the effects of both boundary extension and normalization with and without extremal edges. Images without extremal edges elicited typical boundary extension for the 16 % size change condition, whereas the 40 % condition showed signs of normalization. With extremal edges, a reduced amount of boundary extension occurred for the 16 % condition, and only normalization was found for the 40 % condition. Our findings support and highlight the importance of amodal continuation at the view boundaries as a component of boundary extension.\n\nGenomic patterns in Acropora cervicornis show extensive population structure and variable genetic diversity.\n\nPubMed\n\nDrury, Crawford; Schopmeyer, Stephanie; Goergen, Elizabeth; Bartels, Erich; Nedimyer, Ken; Johnson, Meaghan; Maxwell, Kerry; Galvan, Victor; Manfrino, Carrie; Lirman, Diego\n\n2017-08-01\n\nThreatened Caribbean coral communities can benefit from high-resolution genetic data used to inform management and conservation action. We use Genotyping by Sequencing (GBS) to investigate genetic patterns in the threatened coral, Acropora cervicornis , across the Florida Reef Tract (FRT) and the western Caribbean. Results show extensive population structure at regional scales and resolve previously unknown structure within the FRT. Different regions also exhibit up to threefold differences in genetic diversity (He), suggesting targeted management based on the goals and resources of each population is needed. Patterns of genetic diversity have a strong spatial component, and our results show Broward and the Lower Keys are among the most diverse populations in Florida. The genetic diversity of Caribbean staghorn coral is concentrated within populations and within individual reefs (AMOVA), highlighting the complex mosaic of population structure. This variance structure is similar over regional and local scales, which suggests that in situ nurseries are adequately capturing natural patterns of diversity, representing a resource that can replicate the average diversity of wild assemblages, serving to increase intraspecific diversity and potentially leading to improved biodiversity and ecosystem function. Results presented here can be translated into specific goals for the recovery of A.Â cervicornis , including active focus on low diversity areas, protection of high diversity and connectivity, and practical thresholds for responsible restoration.\n\nThe role of technetium-99m stannous pyrophosphate in myocardial imaging to recognize, localize and identify extension of acute myocardial infarction in patients\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nWillerson, J.

By late 2009, the total number of camera phones will exceed that of both conventional and digital cameras shipped since the invention of photography. Use in mobile phones of applications like visiophony, matrix code readers and biometrics requires a high degree of component flexibility that image processors (IPs) have not, to date, been able to provide. For all these reasons, programmable processor solutions have become essential. This paper presents several techniques geared to speeding up image processors. It demonstrates that a gain of twice is possible for the complete image acquisition chain and the enhancement pipeline downstream of the video sensor. Such results confirm the potential of these computing systems for supporting future applications.\n\nGate crashing arbuscular mycorrhizas: in vivo imaging shows the extensive colonization of both symbionts by Trichoderma atroviride.\n\nPubMed\n\nLace, Beatrice; Genre, Andrea; Woo, Sheridan; Faccio, Antonella; Lorito, Matteo; Bonfante, Paola\n\n2015-02-01\n\nPlant growth-promoting fungi include strains of Trichoderma species that are used in biocontrol, and arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi, that enhance plant nutrition and stress resistance. The concurrent interaction of plants with these two groups of fungi affects crop performance but has only been occasionally studied so far. Using in vivo imaging of green fluorescent protein-tagged lines, we investigated the cellular interactions occurring between Trichoderma atrovirideâ PKI1, Medicago truncatula and two Gigaspora species under in vitro culture conditions. Trichoderma atroviride did not activate symbiotic-like responses in the plant cells, such as nuclear calcium spiking or cytoplasmic aggregations at hyphal contact sites. Furthermore, T.âatroviride parasitized G.âgigantea and G.âmargarita hyphae through localized wall breaking and degradation - although this was not associated with significant chitin lysis nor the upregulation of two major chitinase genes. Trichodermaâatroviride colonized broad areas of the root epidermis, in association with localized cell death. The infection of both symbionts was also observed when T.âatroviride was applied to a pre-established AM symbiosis. We conclude that - although this triple interaction is known to improve plant growth in agricultural environments - in vitro culture demonstrate a particularly aggressive mycoparasitic and plant-colonizing behaviour of a biocontrol strain of Trichoderma.

Objective To investigate the spinal MRI findings of LETM that help differentiate NMO at the acute stage from multiple sclerosis (MS) and other causes of LETM. Methods We enrolled 94 patients with LETM into our study. Bright spotty lesions (BSL), the lesion distribution and location were evaluated on axial T2-weighted images. Brainstem extension, cord expansion, T1 darkness and lesion enhancement were noted. We also reviewed the brain MRI of the patients during LETM. Results Patients with NMO had a greater amount of BSL and T1 dark lesions (p < 0.001 and 0.003, respectively). The lesions in NMO patients were more likely to involve greater than one-half of the spinal cordâs cross-sectional area; to enhance and be centrally-located, or both centrally- and peripherally-located in the cord. Of the 62 available brain MRIs, 14 of the 27 whom were NMO patients had findings that may be specific to NMO. Conclusions Certain spinal cord MRI features are more commonly seen in NMO patients and so obtaining brain MRI during LETM may support diagnosis.

Both open source and commercial packages provide a wide range of functions for image and signal analysis, which are sometimes supported very well by the communities in the corresponding fields. Commercial software packages have the major drawback of being expensive and having undisclosed source code, which hampers extending the functionality if there is no plugin interface or similar option available. However, both variants cannot cover all possible use cases and sometimes custom developments are unavoidable, requiring open source applications. In this paper we describe IQM, a completely free, portable and open source (GNU GPLv3) image and signal analysis application written in pure Java. IQM does not depend on any natively installed libraries and is therefore runnable out-of-the-box. Currently, a continuously growing repertoire of 50 image and 16 signal analysis algorithms is provided. The modular functional architecture based on the three-tier model is described along the most important functionality. Extensibility is achieved using operator plugins, and the development of more complex workflows is provided by a Groovy script interface to the JVM. We demonstrate IQMâs image and signal processing capabilities in a proof-of-principle analysis and provide example implementations to illustrate the plugin framework and the scripting interface. IQM integrates with the popular ImageJ image processing software and is aiming at complementing functionality rather than competing with existing open source software. Machine learning can be integrated into more complex algorithms via the WEKA software package as well, enabling the development of transparent and robust methods for image and signal analysis.

Development of data management infrastructure is further complicated by technical and experimental advances that drive modifications to existing protocols and acquisition of new types of research data to be incorporated into existing data management systems. In this paper, an extensible data management system for clinical neuroimaging studies is introduced: The Human Clinical Imaging Database (HID) and Toolkit. The database schema is constructed to support the storage of new data types without changes to the underlying schema. The complex infrastructure allows management of experiment data, such as image protocol and behavioral task parameters, as well as subject-specific data, including demographics, clinical assessments, and behavioral task performance metrics. Of significant interest, embedded clinical data entry and management tools enhance both consistency of data reporting and automatic entry of data into the database. The Clinical Assessment Layout Manager (CALM) allows users to create on-line data entry forms for use within and across sites, through which data is pulled into the underlying database via the generic clinical assessment management engine (GAME). Importantly, the system is designed to operate in a distributed environment, serving both human users and client applications in a service-oriented manner. Querying capabilities use a built-in multi-database parallel query builder/result combiner, allowing web-accessible queries within and across multiple federated databases. The system along with its documentation is open-source and available from the Neuroimaging Informatics Tools and Resource Clearinghouse (NITRC) site.

Some rivers there are experiencing their worst flooding in more than 50 years. Of particular note, Britain's River Ouse reached its highest levels on record since 1625. Thousands of people have been evacuated from their homes since October 30, when a large low-pressure system brought torrential rains and hurricane-force winds, placing regions around more than 40 rivers across the country on flood alert. Since then, the rains have persisted, keeping water levels high and causing additional rivers to overrun their banks. In all, at least 12 people have been killed and more than 5,000 properties flooded. Some officials estimate damages could reach 500 million pounds (roughly $715 million). These Landsat 7 scenes show a comparison of the region surrounding Exeter, England, before and after the floods. The top image was acquired September 28 and the bottom image was acquired October 30, 2000. Note the extensive flooding along the River Exe in the bottom image (blue pixels). The light bluish-white pixels in the top image are clouds, and the black splotches on the landscape are the clouds' shadows. The reddish-brown shapes are agricultural fields.

All across Siberia fires have been raging, and this Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) image from May 15, 2002, shows extensive, dark burn scars along with actively burning fires (red dots) on the north side of the Amur River, which separates Russia (north) and China (south). The southern Amur region is largely devoted to farming and other agriculture, and these fires may have been set intentionally to prepare the land for the growing season. Fire is often used to clear land of unwanted vegetation, and to return the nutrients stored in vegetation back to the soil. However, fires that are too frequent or severe can devastate the soil, eventually making it unsuitable for farming or grazing. Fires can also escape control and spread into protected areas. In this image, fires are mostly concentrated in a lowland area within the drainage basin of the Zeya River, which drains from the frozen lake at the top of the image.

However, ex-vivo histology images are frequently sectioned into quarters prior to imaging. Aims: This work presents Histostitcherâ¢, a software system designed to create a pseudo whole mount histology section (WMHS) from a stitching of four individual histology quadrant images. Materials and Methods: Histostitcherâ¢ uses user-identified fiducials on the boundary of two quadrants to stitch such quadrants. An original prototype of Histostitcherâ¢ was designed using the Matlab programming languages. However, clinical use was limited due to slow performance, computer memory constraints and an inefficient workflow. The latest version was created using the extensible imaging platform (XIPâ¢) architecture in the C++ programming language. A fast, graphics processor unit renderer was designed to intelligently cache the visible parts of the histology quadrants and the workflow was significantly improved to allow modifying existing fiducials, fast transformations of the quadrants and saving/loading sessions. Results: The new stitching platform yielded significantly more efficient workflow and reconstruction than the previous prototype. It was tested on a traditional desktop computer, a Windows 8 Surface Pro table device and a 27 inch multi-touch display, with little performance difference between the different devices. Conclusions: Histostitcherâ¢ is a fast, efficient framework for reconstructing pseudo WMHS from individually imaged quadrants. The highly modular XIPâ¢ framework was used to develop an intuitive interface and future work will entail mapping the disease extent from the pseudo WMHS onto pre-operative MRI.

A present limitation on the size of the object to be imaged at a given resolution is the frequency bandwidth of the system, since the location is encoded as a frequency offset in ESE imaging. The authorsâ aim in this study was to demonstrate the object size advantage of the multioffset bandwidth extension technique.Methods: The multiple-stepped Zeeman field offset (or simply multi-B) technique was used for imaging of an 8.5-cm-long phantom containing a narrow single line triaryl methyl compound (trityl) solution at the 250 MHz imaging frequency. The image is compared to a standard single-field ESE image of the same phantom.Results: For the phantom used in this study, transverse relaxation (T2e) electron spin-echo (ESE) images from multi-B acquisition are more uniform, contain less prominent artifacts, and have a better signal to noise ratio (SNR) compared to single-field T2e images.Conclusions: The multi-B method is suitable for imaging of samples whose physical size restricts the applicability of the conventional single-field ESE imaging technique.

Assessment is usually accomplished with grid-based digital reference objects (DRO) or, more recently, digital anthropomorphic phantoms based on normal human anatomy. Publicly available digital anthropomorphic phantoms can provide a basis for generating realistic model-based DROs that incorporate the heterogeneity commonly found in pathology. Using a publicly available vascular input function (VIF) and digital anthropomorphic phantom of a normal human brain, a methodology was developed to generate a DRO based on the general kinetic model (GKM) that represented realistic and heterogeneously enhancing pathology. GKM parameters were estimated from a deidentified clinical dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE) MRI exam. This clinical imaging volume was co-registered with a discrete tissue model, and model parameters estimated from clinical images were used to synthesize a DCE-MRI exam that consisted of normal brain tissues and a heterogeneously enhancing brain tumor. An example application of spatial smoothing was used to illustrate potential applications in assessing quantitative imaging algorithms. A voxel-wise Bland-Altman analysis demonstrated negligible differences between the parameters estimated with and without spatial smoothing (using a small radius Gaussian kernel). In this work, we reported an extensible methodology for generating model-based anthropomorphic DROs containing normal and pathological tissue that can be used to assess quantitative imaging algorithms.\n\nNASA Image Shows a Slightly Stronger Emily\n\nNASA Image and Video Library\n\n2011-08-02\n\nNASA Aqua spacecraft continues to track the gradual organization of Tropical Storm Emily, as seen in this image taken Aug. 2, 2011 at 1:05 p.m. EDT. At that time, the storm was located about 270 miles southeast of San Juan, Puerto Rico.\n\nCase Study of Image-Guided Deep Brain Stimulation: Magnetic Resonance Imaging-Based White Matter Tractography Shows Differences in Responders and Nonresponders.\n\nPubMed\n\nO'Halloran, Rafael L; Chartrain, Alexander G; Rasouli, Jonathan J; Ramdhani, Ritesh A; Kopell, Brian Harris\n\n2016-12-01\n\nThe caudal zona incerta (cZI) is an increasingly popular deep brain stimulation (DBS) target for the treatment of tremor-predominant disease. The dentatorubrothalamic tract (DRTT) is a white matter fiber bundle that traverses the cZI and can be identified using diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging fiber tractography to ascertain its precise course. In this report, we compare 2 patient cases of cZI DBS, a responder and a nonresponder. Patient 1 (responder) is a 65-year-old man with medically refractory Parkinson disease who underwent bilateral DBS lead placement in the cZI. Postoperatively he demonstrated >90% reduction in baseline tremor and was not limited by stimulation side effects. Postoperative imaging showed correct lead placement in the cZI. Tractography revealed a DRTT within the field of stimulation, bilaterally. Patient 2 (nonresponder) is a 61-year-old man with medically refractory Parkinson disease who also underwent bilateral DBS lead placement in the cZI. He initially demonstrated >90% reduction in baseline tremor but developed disabling dystonia of his left leg and significant slurring of his speech in the months after surgery. Postoperative imaging showed bilateral lead placement in the cZI. Right-sided electrode revision was recommended and resulted in relief of tremor and reduced dystonic side effects. Tractography analysis of the original leads revealed a DRTT with an atypical anterior trajectory and a location outside the field of stimulation. Tractography analysis of the revised lead showed a DRTT within the field of stimulation. Preoperative diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging fiber tractography imaging of the DRTT has the potential to improve and individualize DBS planning. Copyright ÃÂ© 2016 Elsevier Inc.

DOTA-TATE is an analogue of somatostatin, which shows high binding affinity to somatostatin receptors. We aim to evaluate the 68 Ga/ 177 Lu-labeling DOTA-TATE kit in neuroendocrine tumor model for molecular imaging and to try human-positron emission tomography/computed tomography imaging of 68 Ga-DOTA-TATE in neuroendocrine tumor patients. DOTA-TATE kits were formulated and radiolabeled with 68 Ga/ 177 Lu for 68 Ga/ 177 Lu-DOTA-TATE (M-DOTA-TATE). In vitro and in vivo stability of 177 Lu-DOTA-TATE were performed. Nude mice bearing human tumors were injected with 68 Ga-DOTA-TATE or 177 Lu-DOTA-TATE for micro-positron emission tomography and micro-single-photon emission computed tomography/computed tomography imaging separately, and clinical positron emission tomography/computed tomography images of 68 Ga-DOTA-TATE were obtained at 1 h post-intravenous injection from patients with neuroendocrine tumors. Micro-positron emission tomography and micro-single-photon emission computed tomography/computed tomography imaging of 68 Ga-DOTA-TATE and 177 Lu-DOTA-TATE both showed clear tumor uptake which could be blocked by excess DOTA-TATE. In addition, 68 Ga-DOTA-TATE-positron emission tomography/computed tomography imaging in neuroendocrine tumor patients could show primary and metastatic lesions. 68 Ga-DOTA-TATE and 177 Lu-DOTA-TATE could accumulate in tumors in animal models, paving the way for better clinical peptide receptor radionuclide therapy for neuroendocrine tumor patients in Asian population.\n\nA hierarchical SVG image abstraction layer for medical imaging\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nKim, Edward; Huang, Xiaolei; Tan, Gang; Long, L. Rodney; Antani, Sameer\n\n2010-03-01\n\nAs medical imaging rapidly expands, there is an increasing need to structure and organize image data for efficient analysis, storage and retrieval. In response, a large fraction of research in the areas of content-based image retrieval (CBIR) and picture archiving and communication systems (PACS) has focused on structuring information to bridge the \"semantic gap\", a disparity between machine and human image understanding. An additional consideration in medical images is the organization and integration of clinical diagnostic information. As a step towards bridging the semantic gap, we design and implement a hierarchical image abstraction layer using an XML based language, Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG). Our method encodes features from the raw image and clinical information into an extensible \"layer\" that can be stored in a SVG document and efficiently searched. Any feature extracted from the raw image including, color, texture, orientation, size, neighbor information, etc., can be combined in our abstraction with high level descriptions or classifications. And our representation can natively characterize an image in a hierarchical tree structure to support multiple levels of segmentation. Furthermore, being a world wide web consortium (W3C) standard, SVG is able to be displayed by most web browsers, interacted with by ECMAScript (standardized scripting language, e.g. JavaScript, JScript), and indexed and retrieved by XML databases and XQuery. Using these open source technologies enables straightforward integration into existing systems. From our results, we show that the flexibility and extensibility of our abstraction facilitates effective storage and retrieval of medical images.\n\nAn extension to artifact-free projection overlaps\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nLin, Jianyu, E-mail: jianyulin@hotmail.com\n\n2015-05-15\n\nPurpose: In multipinhole single photon emission computed tomography, the overlapping of projections has been used to increase sensitivity. Avoiding artifacts in the reconstructed image associated with projection overlaps (multiplexing) is a critical issue. In our previous report, two types of artifact-free projection overlaps, i.e., projection overlaps that do not lead to artifacts in the reconstructed image, were formally defined and proved, and were validated via simulations. In this work, a new proposition is introduced to extend the previously defined type-II artifact-free projection overlaps so that a broader range of artifact-free overlaps is accommodated. One practical purpose of the new extensionmoreÂ Â» is to design a baffle window multipinhole system with artifact-free projection overlaps. Methods: First, the extended type-II artifact-free overlap was theoretically defined and proved. The new proposition accommodates the situation where the extended type-II artifact-free projection overlaps can be produced with incorrectly reconstructed portions in the reconstructed image. Next, to validate the theory, the extended-type-II artifact-free overlaps were employed in designing the multiplexing multipinhole spiral orbit imaging systems with a baffle window. Numerical validations were performed via simulations, where the corresponding 1-pinhole nonmultiplexing reconstruction results were used as the benchmark for artifact-free reconstructions. The mean square error (MSE) was the metric used for comparisons of noise-free reconstructed images. Noisy reconstructions were also performed as part of the validations. Results: Simulation results show that for noise-free reconstructions, the MSEs of the reconstructed images of the artifact-free multiplexing systems are very similar to those of the corresponding 1-pinhole systems. No artifacts were observed in the reconstructed images. Therefore, the testing results for artifact-free multiplexing systems designed using\n\nThe structure of S . lividans acetoacetyl-CoA synthetase shows a novel interaction between the C-terminal extension and the N-terminal domain\n\nDOE PAGES\n\nMitchell, Carter A.; Tucker, Alex C.; Escalante-Semerena, Jorge C.; ...\n\n2014-12-09\n\nThe adenosine monoposphate-forming acyl-CoA synthetase enzymes catalyze a two-step reaction that involves the initial formation of an acyl adenylate that reacts in a second partial reaction to form a thioester between the acyl substrate and CoA. These enzymes utilize a Domain Alternation catalytic mechanism, whereby a ~110 residue C-terminal domain rotates by 140Â° to form distinct catalytic conformations for the two partial reactions. In this paper, the structure of an acetoacetyl-CoA synthetase (AacS) is presented that illustrates a novel aspect of this C-terminal domain. Specifically, several acetyl- and acetoacetyl-CoA synthetases contain a 30-residue extension on the C-terminus compared to othermoreÂ Â» members of this family. Finally, whereas residues from this extension are disordered in prior structures, the AacS structure shows that residues from this extension may interact with key catalytic residues from the N-terminal domain.Â«Â less\n\nSOLITARY IDIOPATHIC CHOROIDITIS IN THE SETTING OF EXTENSIVE ANIMAL EXPOSURE.\n\nPubMed\n\nKumar, Vivek; Khoo, Chloe T L; Shields, Carol L\n\n2016-01-01\n\nTo describe solitary idiopathic choroiditis in the setting of extensive animal exposure. A 56-year-old asymptomatic female equestrian with an extensive history of exposure to horses and dogs and a trapper of wild animals and rodents was discovered to have an amelanotic choroidal mass in the macular region and referred for suspicious atypical nevus. Funduscopy revealed a deep yellow mass with overlying retinal pigment epithelial thinning and without visible subretinal fluid or lipofuscin. Mild hyperautofluorescence represented unmasking of scleral autofluorescence. Ultrasonography showed a 1.8-mm-thick echodense lesion. Enhanced depth imaging-optical coherence tomography disclosed a dense, elevated scleral mass with \"volcanic\" configuration, demonstrating choroidal compression and trace overlying subretinal fluid. These features were consistent with solitary idiopathic choroiditis/scleritis. Systemic evaluation for standard cat-related bartonellosis, tuberculosis, sarcoidosis, and syphilis were negative. Horse-, dog-, and rodent-related bartonellosis testing was not available. Observation was advised, and the findings remained stable at 6 months. Solitary idiopathic choroiditis is best imaged on enhanced depth imaging-optical coherence tomography as a scleral lesion with \"volcanic\" configuration and often secondary to previous Bartonella infection. Serologic positivity for cat-related Bartonella decays over time, and testing for horse-, dog-, or rodent-related Bartonella is not commonly used.\n\nFlexion and extension gaps created by the navigation-assisted gap technique show small acceptable mismatches and close mutual correlations.\n\nPubMed\n\nLee, Dae-Hee; Shin, Young-Soo; Jeon, Jin-Ho; Suh, Dong-Won; Han, Seung-Beom\n\n2014-08-01\n\nThe aim of this study was to investigate the mechanism underlying the development of gap differences in total knee arthroplasty using the navigation-assisted gap technique and to assess whether these gap differences have statistical significance. Ninety-two patients (105 knees) implanted with cruciate-retaining prostheses using the navigation-assisted gap balancing technique were prospectively analysed. Medial extension and flexion gaps and lateral extension and flexion gaps were measured at full extension and at 90Â° of flexion. Repeated measures analysis of variance was used to compare the mean values of these four gaps. The correlation coefficient between each pair of gaps was assessed using Pearson's correlation analysis. Mean intra-operative medial and lateral extension gaps were 20.6 Â± 2.1 and 21.7 Â± 2.2 mm, respectively, and mean intra-operative medial and lateral flexion gaps were 21.6 Â± 2.7 and 22.1 Â± 2.5 mm, respectively. The pairs of gaps differed significantly (P < 0.05 each), except for the difference between the medial flexion and lateral extension gaps (n.s.). All four gaps were significantly correlated with each other, with the highest correlation between the medial and lateral flexion gaps (r = 0.890, P < 0.001) and the lowest between the medial flexion and lateral extension gaps (r = 0.701, P < 0.001). Medial and lateral flexion and extension gaps created using the navigation-assisted gap technique differed significantly, although the differences between them were <2 mm, and the gaps were closely correlated. These narrow ranges of statistically acceptable gap differences and the strong correlations between gaps should be considered by surgeons, as should the risks of soft tissue over-release or unintentional increases in extension or flexion gap after preparation of the other gap.\n\nNASA Spacecraft Image Shows Location of Iranian Earthquake\n\nNASA Image and Video Library\n\n2017-12-08\n\nOn April 9, 2013 at 11:52 GMT, a magnitude 6.3 earthquake hit southwestern Iran's Bushehr province near the town of Kaki. Preliminary information is that several villages have been destroyed and many people have died, as reported by BBC News. This perspective view of the region was acquired Nov. 17, 2012, by the Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER) instrument on NASA's Terra spacecraft. The location of the earthquake's epicenter is marked with a yellow star. Vegetation is displayed in red; the vertical exaggeration of the topography is 2X. The image is centered near 28.5 degrees north latitude, 51.6 degrees east longitude. With its 14 spectral bands from the visible to the thermal infrared wavelength region and its high spatial resolution of 15 to 90 meters (about 50 to 300 feet), ASTER images Earth to map and monitor the changing surface of our planet. ASTER is one of five Earth-observing instruments launched Dec. 18, 1999, on Terra. The instrument was built by Japan's Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry. A joint U.S./Japan science team is responsible for validation and calibration of the instrument and data products. The broad spectral coverage and high spectral resolution of ASTER provides scientists in numerous disciplines with critical information for surface mapping and monitoring of dynamic conditions and temporal change. Example applications are: monitoring glacial advances and retreats; monitoring potentially active volcanoes; identifying crop stress; determining cloud morphology and physical properties; wetlands evaluation; thermal pollution monitoring; coral reef degradation; surface temperature mapping of soils and geology; and measuring surface heat balance. The U.S. science team is located at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, Calif. The Terra mission is part of NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C.

His cerebrospinal fluid was xanthochromic with elevation of total protein. Computed tomography (CT) showed mixed-density bilateral ventricular masses. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed multiple nodules in both lateral ventricles; they were heterogeneously enhanced by gadolinium. Diffuse hyperintensity in the right medial temporal lobe and bilateral subependymal area was noted on fluid-attenuated inversion recovery images. Susceptibility-weighted imaging showed low intensity in the masses and cerebellar sulci suggesting hemorrhage and hemosiderin deposition. The preoperative diagnosis was disseminated malignant tumor with recurring hemorrhage. Histological examination of biopsy specimens showed clusters of cells with small uniform nuclei embedded in a dense fibrillary matrix of glial cells and microcystic degeneration. Pseudo-rosettes indicating ependymoma were absent. Microhemorrhages and hemosiderin deposits were noted. Immunohistochemically, the background fibrillary matrix and neoplastic cells were positive for glial fibrillary acidic protein. Mutated isocitrate dehydrogenase-1 was negative. The MIB-1 index was 1.5%. The tumor was pathologically diagnosed as subependymoma containing microhemorrhages and hemosiderin deposits. The extensive multiplicity and hemorrhage encountered in this case have rarely been reported in patients with subependymoma.\n\nDeformable image registration with a featurelet algorithm: implementation as a 3D-slicer extension and validation\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nRenner, A.; Furtado, H.; Seppenwoolde, Y.; Birkfellner, W.; Georg, D.\n\n2016-03-01\n\nA radiotherapy (RT) treatment can last for several weeks. In that time organ motion and shape changes introduce uncertainty in dose application. Monitoring and quantifying the change can yield a more precise irradiation margin definition and thereby reduce dose delivery to healthy tissue and adjust tumor targeting. Deformable image registration (DIR) has the potential to fulfill this task by calculating a deformation field (DF) between a planning CT and a repeated CT of the altered anatomy. Application of the DF on the original contours yields new contours that can be used for an adapted treatment plan. DIR is a challenging method and therefore needs careful user interaction. Without a proper graphical user interface (GUI) a misregistration cannot be easily detected by visual inspection and the results cannot be fine-tuned by changing registration parameters. To provide a DIR algorithm with such a GUI available for everyone, we created the extension Featurelet-Registration for the open source software platform 3D Slicer. The registration logic is an upgrade of an in-house-developed DIR method, which is a featurelet-based piecewise rigid registration. The so called \"featurelets\" are equally sized rectangular subvolumes of the moving image which are rigidly registered to rectangular search regions on the fixed image. The output is a deformed image and a deformation field. Both can be visualized directly in 3D Slicer facilitating the interpretation and quantification of the results. For validation of the registration accuracy two deformable phantoms were used. The performance was benchmarked against a demons algorithm with comparable results.\n\nSU-E-T-428: Feasibility Study of 4D Image Reconstruction by Organ Motion Vector Extension Based On Portal Images\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nYoon, J; Jung, J; Yeo, I\n\n2015-06-15\n\nPurpose: To develop and to test a method to generate a new 4D CT images of the treatment day from the old 4D CT and the portal images of the day when the motion extent exceeded from that represented by plan CTs. Methods: A motion vector of a moving tumor in a patient may be extended to reconstruct the tumor position when the motion extent exceeded from that represented by plan CTs. To test this, 1. a phantom that consists of a polystyrene cylinder (tumor) embedded in cork (lung) was placed on a moving platform with 4 sec/cycle and amplitudesmoreÂ Â» of 1 cm and 2 cm, and was 4D-scanned. 2. A 6MV photon beam was irradiated on the moving phantoms and cineEPID images were obtained. 3. A motion vector of the tumor was acquired from 4D CT images of the phantom with 1 cm amplitude. 4. From cine EPID images of the phantom with the 2 cm amplitude, various motion extents (0.3 cm, 0.5 cm, etc) were acquired and programmed into the motion vector, producing CT images at each position. 5. The reconstructed CT images were then compared with pre-acquired âreferenceâ 4D CT images at each position (i.e. phase). Results: The CT image was reconstructed and compared with the reference image, showing a slight mismatch in the transition direction limited by voxel size (slice thickness) in CT image. Due to the rigid nature of the phantom studied, the modeling the displacement of the center of object was sufficient. When deformable tumors are to be modeled, more complex scheme is necessary, which utilize cine EPID and 4D CT images. Conclusion: The new idea of CT image reconstruction was demonstrated. Deformable tumor movements need to be considered in the future.Â«Â less\n\nNASA SMAP Images Show Texas Soil Moisture Conditions Before/After Hurricane Harvey's Landfall\n\nNASA Image and Video Library\n\n2017-08-29\n\nImages of soil moisture conditions in Texas near Houston, generated by NASA's Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) satellite before and after the landfall of Hurricane Harvey can be used to monitor changing ground conditions due to Harvey's rainfall. As seen in the left panel, SMAP observations show that soil surface conditions were already very wet a few days before the hurricane made landfall (August 21/22), with moisture levels in the 20 to 40 percent range. Such saturated soil surfaces contributed to the inability of water to infiltrate more deeply into soils, thereby increasing the likelihood of flooding. After Harvey made landfall, the southwest portion of Houston became exceptionally wet, as seen in the right panel image from August 25/26, signaling the arrival of heavy rains and widespread flooding. https://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA21926\n\nComparison of Macroscopic Pathology Measurements With Magnetic Resonance Imaging and Assessment of Microscopic Pathology Extension for Colorectal Liver Metastases\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nMendez Romero, Alejandra, E-mail: a.mendezromero@erasmusmc.nl; Verheij, Joanne; Dwarkasing, Roy S.\n\n2012-01-01\n\nPurpose: To compare pathology macroscopic tumor dimensions with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) measurements and to establish the microscopic tumor extension of colorectal liver metastases. Methods and Materials: In a prospective pilot study we included patients with colorectal liver metastases planned for surgery and eligible for MRI. A liver MRI was performed within 48 hours before surgery. Directly after surgery, an MRI of the specimen was acquired to measure the degree of tumor shrinkage. The specimen was fixed in formalin for 48 hours, and another MRI was performed to assess the specimen/tumor shrinkage. All MRI sequences were imported into our radiotherapymoreÂ Â» treatment planning system, where the tumor and the specimen were delineated. For the macroscopic pathology analyses, photographs of the sliced specimens were used to delineate and reconstruct the tumor and the specimen volumes. Microscopic pathology analyses were conducted to assess the infiltration depth of tumor cell nests. Results: Between February 200"
