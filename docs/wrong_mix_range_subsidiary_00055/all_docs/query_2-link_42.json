        "text": "Headquarters 6 St. Paul Street, Baltimore, MD 21202 Area served Baltimore Metropolitan Area Founded April 30, 1970 Fleet size 761 (Bus)\n\n53 (Light Rail)\n\n100 (Heavy Rail) Number of lines 103 (Bus)\n\n3 (Light Rail)\n\n1 (Heavy Rail) Ridership ~130 million (FY2016) Union ATU Local 1300 Website mta.maryland.gov Facebook @mtamaryland Instagram @mtamaryland Twitter @mtamaryland YouTube youtube.com/user/TheMTAMaryland\n\nMaryland Transit Administration (MTA) is the primary transit service provider in Baltimore, Maryland. It directly operates six transit services: local bus, light rail, heavy rail, commuter bus, mobility paratransit, and MARC Train. MARC commuter rail service is administered by MTA Maryland but operated by CSX Transportation and Amtrak. A seventh mode of service in Maryland's Eastern Shore being freight transport is also administered by MTA but operated by a private contractor.\n\nBus\n\nAs of June 18, 2017, the entire bus system underwent a major overhaul. There are 103 bus routes in the system, 66 of those routes are consisted within the Baltimore region (and counties). There are more than 700 buses overall in the current fleet. Commuter BusLINK routes are operated by privately-owned motor coach contractors throughout central Maryland, so MCI buses may not appear in system's fleet roster record. Private contractors operating commuter bus service use some of their own buses that could be seen used in charter service.\n\nRouting Key\n\nThis description gives you the meaning and purpose of the services below.\n\nCityLINK service is provided by twelve high-frequency routes operating 24-hours per day along truncated corridors with high ridership throughout the Baltimore inner-city with some connecting to the surrounding suburbs. All routes are identify by colors [destination signs w/ two-letter acronyms -- to identify the color if spelled-out (13000 through 16000s feature a \"colored box\" with the letters inverted within)] as they are the only lines featuring letters. All lines link with each other throughout the region, rather it's within downtown or in the surrounding area. The LocalLINK routes are identified by two different types of services: Crosstown and Feeder service. Crosstown lines operate from one region to another rather within the city-limits or cross-county (primarily Baltimore county) without connecting through downtown Baltimore. These lines are numbered in the 20s and 30s. Feeder lines operate mostly off truncated corridors along whilst linking to either CityLINK, Metro SubwayLINK or Light RailLINK lines. Some crosstown and feeders routes operate 24-hours per day. These lines are numbered from the 50s through 90s. To better identify the lines, crosstown routes from south-to-north are numbered from lowest-to-highest; feeder routes from east-to-west are numbered from lowest-to-highest. Express BusLINK operates 'direct' route connections throughout the region. Most serve the downtown area to the surrounding suburbs, while three other lines (102, 106 and 107) utilize the Beltway (Interstate 695) to link White Marsh-to-Baynesville-to-Towson (102); Towson-to-Pikesville-to-Owings Mills (106); and Pikesville-to-Woodlawn-to-UMBC & BWI Airport (107). Each express line operates non-stop or limited-stops along their route. Commuter BusLINK service is similar to express service with routes operating to/from downtown Baltimore or downtown Washington, D.C. and/or Silver Spring, MD but provide direct non-stop service at longer distances while connecting to the surrounding suburbs or neighboring counties. One service in particular is the Inter-County Connector, which does not connect to Baltimore nor Washington, D.C. (one route does connect to downtown Silver Spring) but connects the suburbs to major points-of-interest using the Inter-County tollway of MD Route 200 (denoted as \"200s\").\n\nRouting List\n\nCityLINK → Navy NV, Orange OR, Green GR, Blue BL, Pink PK, Silver SV, Lime LM, Red RD, Yellow YW, Purple PR, Gold GD, Brown BR\n\nLocalLINK (Crosstown) → 21, 22, 26, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 36, 37, 38✝\n\nLocalLINK (Feeder) → 51, 52✝, 53, 54, 56, 57, 59, 62, 63, 65, 67, 69, 70, 71, 73, ✈75, 76, 77, 78, 79, 80, 81, 82, 83, 85, 87, 89, 91, 92✝, 93, 94, 95✝\n\nExpress BusLINK → 103, 105, 115, 120, 150, 154, 160\n\nPreakness Shuttle → Rogers Avenue Metro-Pimlico, Poly/Western-Pimlico\n\nCommuter BusLINK (Inter-County Connector) → ✈201, 203, 204\n\nCommuter BusLINK (Anne Arundel County) - 210, 215\n\nCommuter BusLINK (Anne Arundel / Queen Anne's Counties) → 220, 230, 240, 250, 260\n\nCommuter BusLINK (Howard County) → 310, 315, 320, 325, 335, 345\n\nCommuter BusLINK (Harford County) → 410, 411, 420\n\nCommuter BusLINK (Washington / Frederick / Montgomery Counties) → 505, 515\n\nCommuter BusLINK (Charles / Prince George's Counties) → 610, 620, 630, 640, 650\n\nCommuter BusLINK (Saint Mary's / Prince George's Counties) → 705, 715, 725, 735\n\nCommuter BusLINK (Calvert County) → 810, 820, 830, 840, 850\n\nNote:\n\n✝ = Routes operate limited service throughout the day.

The project in the 1960s rapid transit plan was to be a proposed subway line to Friendship Airport (now BWI Thurgood Marshall Airport). Unplanned, the city of Baltimore begin construction in the late-1980s while the first phase of the Metro Subway project was completed. Becoming the first streetcar-type service to run in Baltimore since the switch from rail to rubber-tire vehicles in the 1970s.\n\nThe rail have since been through restructuring phases, such as the double-tracking construction in 2004-05; Expansion to three separate rail lines and transit-oriented development of Hunt Valley Centre Mall.\n\nThe future light rail projects have been moving swiftly through Maryland State Legislation and gaining approval from the \"FTA\" for funding of the two projects. An overall estimated $4 billion project will be the biggest transit development construction since the Chesapeake Bay Bridge construction in the 1950's & 60's.\n\nThe Red Line light rail is a proposed east-west line traveling 14.9 miles basically along U.S. Route 40. There will be two tunnels under \"Cooks Lane\" and \"Downtown/Harbor East\". With 19 stations connecting to all major rail lines, as well creating a new connection from metro subway to MARC. This project was scrapped in 2016 by Governor Larry Hogan, in favor of the BaltimoreLINK plan (Effective June 18, 2017).\n\nThe Purple Line is a proposed east-west line traveling 20+ miles basically along the East-West Highway corridor through Prince George's and Montgomery counties just outside of Washington, D.C. The route will connect New Carrollton, Greenbelt, University of Maryland-College Park, Silver Spring and Bethesda areas respectfully for the first time ever on a one-seat service.\n\nIn June 2017, Sagamore Development Corporation introduced a proposal to extend the light rail east to Port Covington as part of their multi-billion dollar development plan that was approved by the Baltimore City Council in 2016. This new alignment will provide service to the newly-built Under Armour facility and City Garage, as well as, for the future housing & retail development that will take place within the next decade. The extension is to branch-off from the main line north of Westport station, just before the Middle Branch creek (Interstate 95/395 junction), across the currently defunct sway-bridge into Port Covington.\n\nRail Lines\n\nBWI Thurgood Marshall Airport ✈ (to/from) Hunt Valley\n\nCromwell Station/Glen Burnie (to/from) Timonium Fairgrounds or Hunt Valley\n\nBaltimore Penn Station (to/from) Camden Yards\n\nPURPLE Line - Bethesda Metrorail Station (to/from) New Carrollton Metrorail Station\n\nProposed to begin service sometime in 2022 [4]\n\nAll-time roster\n\nFleet number(s) Thumbnail Year Manufacturer Model Motors Notes 5001-5035 1991-1993 ABB LRV\n\nUndergoing overhaul process in 2017-2019 by Alstom\n\n5036-5053 1996 ABB LRV\n\nUndergoing overhaul process in 2017-2019 by Alstom\n\n101-126 2020-2022 CAF Urbos\n\nCurrently in production.\n\nCAF was awarded a USD 200 million contract in 2016.\n\n26 136-foot trainsets for the Purple Line\n\nHeavy Rail (Metro SubwayLINK)\n\nThe \"Metro SubwayLINK\" system to this day was not supposed to be unfulfilled or look like it does in the 1960s rapid transit plan. Baltimore's population was rapidly increasing and industrial businesses were booming since the 1950s after World War II. The load taken on buses throughout the city and surrounding counties was unbearable and a different source was needed to maintain the increase in ridership over ten years or more.\n\nThe planned metro subway system was to consist not only in the Northwest corridor, but throughout all regional points of the city (ex.: north, northeast, south, southwest). While the plan was a good way to solve the congestion on bus travel, it was too expensive for tunneling and separate right-of-ways, also public outcry over heavy rail service traveling throughout communities tarnished the chance. Nearly 10 years of discussion to build the system had passed before a break-through to construct what was planned to be a city-wide rail system project that would have spanned nearly 20 years. The system, to meet costs, was planned in three phrases. The first phase, between Reisterstown Plaza to Charles Center, the Second phase, from Owings Mills to Reisterstown Plaza and the last phase from Charles Center to Johns Hopkins Medical Center that would be completed in 1995.\n\nWith 15+ miles of rail, the metro subway was far under what was planned 20 years before. The northwest corridor is a stub of what was supposed to have been a thriving heavy rail network. This is where the discussion for the expansion of the subway system began. The 2000 regional rail plan was to expand as far as White Marsh and Martin State Airport. Many believed at least having the rail route reach one of the biggest colleges in the city, Morgan State University, would give it a true service mode rather than hanging in a region with moderate ridership to/from downtown. MTA Maryland and Maryland Congress will continue to discuss the possible expansion of service through northeast Baltimore onward to \"Morgan State University\".\n\nRail Line\n\nOwings Mills (to/from) Johns Hopkins Hospital\n\nAll-time roster\n\nFleet Series\n\n(Quantity) Thumbnail Year Manufacturer Model Motors Notes 100-171\n\n(72) 1983-1984 Budd Universal Transit Vehicle 172-199\n\n(28) 1986 Budd Universal Transit Vehicle\n\nCar 199 was unmarried from car 198 and is used for operator training\n\nFuture Order TBD 2022-2023 Hitachi TBD\n\n$400.5 million contract awarded in July 2017 includes 78 railcars and train control system.[15]\n\nWill replace the majority of the Budd cars, which are past their service life expectancy.\n\nCommuter Rail (MARC)\n\nMaryland Area Regional Commuter (previously known as Maryland Rail Commuter) began operation in 1984, taking over commuter rail service previously operated by Conrail. MARC is administered under the Maryland Department of Transportation (MDOT) and MTA Maryland, and is operated under contract by Amtrak and CSX Transportation. With some service on the Penn Line reaching maximum speeds of 125 mph, MARC is considered the fastest commuter railroad in the United States. Traveling throughout central Maryland on 187 miles of railroad tracks, the Brunswick Line is the longest line, Penn Line is the fastest commuter rail line in the United States and most busiest traveling along Amtrak's Northeast corridor and the Camden Line is the oldest commuter rail line still in operation in the United States, beginning operation as far back as 1835.\n\nRail Lines\n\nAll lines terminate at Union Station in Washington, D.C.\n\nPenn Line (47 Trips) - Baltimore Penn Station or Perryville\n\nCamden Line (18 Trips)- Camden Yards\n\nBrunswick Line (19 Trips) - Frederick or Martinsburg, West Virginia\n\nLocomotive roster\n\nActive\n\nFleet Numbers Thumbnail Year Manufacturer Model Engine\n\nhorsepower Gearing\n\ntop speed HEP generator Notes 10-35 2008-09 MPI MP36PH-3C EMD 16-645F3B\n\n3600 hp CAT 68 EMD GP40WH-2 Kept as a reserve unit 70-75 EMD GP39H-2\n\n2300 hp Cummins\n\nRebuilt by Morrison-Knudsen from CR 3062, 3066, 3243; B&O 3703, 3710; MILW 2050.\n\n71 was rebuilt\n\n75 is inactive.\n\nSpotted rehabbed in April 2022[16]\n\n80-87 2018 Siemens Charger Cummins QSK95 4145 1971 EMD GP40FH-2A\n\nEx-Conrail 6607.\n\nEx-New Jersey Transit 4145, acquired in 2018-2019.\n\n4910-4915 1998 Bombardier/Alstom HHP-8\n\nRetired\n\nPassenger car roster\n\nActive\n\nFleet Numbers Thumbnail Year Manufacturer Model Seating Capacity Notes 7716-7725 1991 Sumitomo/Nippon Sharyo MARC-IIB\n\nCoaches 7726-7735 1993 Sumitomo/Nippon Sharyo MARC-IIB\n\nCoaches 7757-7762 1991 Sumitomo/Nippon Sharyo MARC-IIB\n\nCab cars 7791-7799 1991 Sumitomo/Nippon Sharyo MARC-IIB\n\nCoaches Lavatory equipped. 7800-7825 1999 Kawasaki MARC-III\n\nCoaches \"T-Car\" - Trailer car [17] 7826-7834 2000 Kawasaki MARC-III\n\nCoaches Ex-VRE V601-V609; purchased in 2008. 7845-7854 1999 Kawasaki MARC-III\n\nCab cars \"C-Car\" - Cab car with restroom [18] 7855-7858 2000 Kawasaki MARC-III\n\nCab cars Ex-VRE V701-V704; purchased in 2008. 7870-7876 1999 Kawasaki MARC-III\n\nCoaches \"S-Car\" - Trailer car with built-in provision for snack bar.
