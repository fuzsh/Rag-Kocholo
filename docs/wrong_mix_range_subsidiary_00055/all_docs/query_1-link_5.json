        "text": "There’s three different models of Silverliners operating currently in revenue service. Each one of these units during the time were sold to different companies (PRR/RDG/PC/Conrail) back in the day when they were ordered. Their specifications vary per company due to their standards during that period of time, and also these units were manufacture by three different companies as well.\n\nPhoto Courtesy of Brandon S. (Philadelphia Transit Vehicles Manager)\n\nSilverliner II – Built in 1963, by the Budd Company for PRR/Reading companies. These units shared the same characteristics as the Silverliner, however, several changes to note: These units weigh at 101,400 pounds compared to the 89,300 pounds on their previous model. Other changes is that addition of the GE phase angle control system. With higher horsepower motors of 624HP compared to 400HP motors on the Silverliners. Today, there are about 52 of these units left in revenue service, however, there’s only one unit that still has the “Pennsylvania” text engraved on the sides which is unit #269.\n\nPhoto Courtesy of Hermes Yoiti Hinuy,\n\nfrom Sao Paulo SP"
