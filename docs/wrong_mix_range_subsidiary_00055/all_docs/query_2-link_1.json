        "text": "Headquarters 1 Penn Plaza East, Newark, New Jersey Area served New Jersey (statewide), New York, Rockland and Orange counties in New York State, and Philadelphia County in Pennsylvania Founded July 17, 1979 Fleet size 3,707 (bus)\n\n1,081 (commuter rail)\n\n71 (lightrail) Number of routes 253 (bus)\n\n11 (commuter rail)\n\n3 (lightrail) Ridership 133,463,800 (2021)[1] Website NJ Transit\n\nNew Jersey Transit is the public transit provider throughout the state of New Jersey in the United States. New Jersey Transit also provides rail and bus service into New York and Philadelphia, as well as light rail service in certain urban areas.\n\nThe NJ Transit system is the third largest public transit system in the country, behind that of New York City and Los Angeles, and is the largest statewide system. Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, the system was carrying nearly 223 million passengers per year. The ridership number was reduced to almost 110 million in the first fiscal year of the pandemic, from July 1, 2020, to June 30, 2021.[2]\n\nHistory\n\nThe Public Transportation Act of 1979 established New Jersey Transit to act as the statewide transit agency, to \"acquire, operate and contract for transportation service in the public interest.\" New Jersey Transit took over the bus operations of Transport of New Jersey in 1980, and established rail operations in 1983, after freight operator Conrail was prohibited from providing passenger service. In 1984, NJ Transit acquired Mercer Metro, and added its system to its operational portfolio. All three subsidiaries were streamlined following a reorganization of the agency in 1994.\n\nRoutes\n\nNew Jersey Transit operates 236 bus routes, 10 commuter rail routes and three light rail lines using a fleet of over 2000 transit and cruiser buses, 711 locomotive and rail cars, and 45 light rail vehicles.\n\nBus Routes\n\nA list of New Jersey Transit bus routes can be found at https://mybusnow.njtransit.com/bustime/wireless/html/home.jsp.\n\nCommuter Rail\n\nThe ten commuter rail lines are:\n\nNortheast Corridor (Trenton-New York City)\n\nNorth Jersey Coast Line (Bay Head-Rahway)\n\nAtlantic City Line (Atlantic City-Philadelphia)\n\nRaritan Valley Line (High Bridge-New York City)\n\nGladstone Branch (Gladstone-New York City)\n\nMorristown Line (Hackettstown-New York City via Morristown)\n\nMontclair-Boonton Line (Hackettstown-New York City via Boonton and Montclair)\n\nMain Line (Suffern-Hoboken via Clifton)\n\nBergen County Line (Suffern-Hoboken via Rutherford)\n\nPascack Valley Line (Spring Valley-Hoboken)\n\nLight Rail\n\nThe three light rail routes are:\n\nNewark Light Rail (ex-Newark City Subway)\n\nHudson Bergen Light Rail (North Bergen-Bayonne)\n\nRiver LINE (Trenton-Camden)\n\nBus Garages\n\nBus service is divided into three operating divisions, each with a number of bus depots and routes assigned. In addition to the buses directly operated by the company, New Jersey Transit also provides buses to operators providing service on NJ Transit routes under contract, as well as private carriers operating their own routes. This brings the total NJ Transit bus fleet to well over 3,000 buses.\n\nPlease see the New Jersey Transit Garages and Yards page.\n\nParatransit Service\n\nNew Jersey Transit also contracts out its Access Link service, using wheelchair-accessible minibuses and standard automobiles, to a variety of operators including Transdev (formerly First Transit). It is a point-to-point service that is available during regular service hours, and will pick up or drop off within 3/4 mile of a NJ Transit bus route or light rail station.
