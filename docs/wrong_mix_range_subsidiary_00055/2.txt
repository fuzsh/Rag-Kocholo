New Jersey Transit is the public transit provider throughout the state of New Jersey in the United States. New Jersey Transit also provides rail and bus service into New York and Philadelphia, as well as light rail service in certain urban areas.

The NJ Transit system is the third largest public transit system in the country, behind that of New York City and Los Angeles, and is the largest statewide system. Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, the system was carrying nearly 223 million passengers per year. The ridership number was reduced to almost 110 million in the first fiscal year of the pandemic, from July 1, 2020, to June 30, 2021.[2]

History

The Public Transportation Act of 1979 established New Jersey Transit to act as the statewide transit agency, to "acquire, operate and contract for transportation service in the public interest." New Jersey Transit took over the bus operations of Transport of New Jersey in 1980, and established rail operations in 1983, after freight operator Conrail was prohibited from providing passenger service. In 1984, NJ Transit acquired Mercer Metro, and added its system to its operational portfolio. All three subsidiaries were streamlined following a reorganization of the agency in 1994.

Routes

New Jersey Transit operates 236 bus routes, 10 commuter rail routes and three light rail lines using a fleet of over 2000 transit and cruiser buses, 711 locomotive and rail cars, and 45 light rail vehicles.

Bus Routes

A list of New Jersey Transit bus routes can be found at https://mybusnow.njtransit.com/bustime/wireless/html/home.jsp.

Commuter Rail

The ten commuter rail lines are:

Northeast Corridor (Trenton-New York City)

North Jersey Coast Line (Bay Head-Rahway)

Atlantic City Line (Atlantic City-Philadelphia)

Raritan Valley Line (High Bridge-New York City)

Gladstone Branch (Gladstone-New York City)

Morristown Line (Hackettstown-New York City via Morristown)

Montclair-Boonton Line (Hackettstown-New York City via Boonton and Montclair)

Main Line (Suffern-Hoboken via Clifton)

Light Rail

The three light rail routes are:

Hudson Bergen Light Rail (North Bergen-Bayonne)

River LINE (Trenton-Camden)

Bus Garages

Bus service is divided into three operating divisions, each with a number of bus depots and routes assigned. In addition to the buses directly operated by the company, New Jersey Transit also provides buses to operators providing service on NJ Transit routes under contract, as well as private carriers operating their own routes. This brings the total NJ Transit bus fleet to well over 3,000 buses.

Please see the New Jersey Transit Garages and Yards page.

Paratransit Service

New Jersey Transit also contracts out its Access Link service, using wheelchair-accessible minibuses and standard automobiles, to a variety of operators including Transdev (formerly First Transit). It is a point-to-point service that is available during regular service hours, and will pick up or drop off within 3/4 mile of a NJ Transit bus route or light rail station. The vehicles are typically Ford E series chassis with a variety of minibus bodies.

In 2021, NJ Transit anticipated a RFP for 172 more cruiser buses.[15] Amended to 91 buses with 81 options.

Request for Proposal due 6/30/2022 with only proposal coming from MCI.[16]

Contract awarded to MCI on November 9, 2022.[17] The contract is for all 172 buses, no options, and the value of the contract is $142,994,950, plus five percent for contingencies.

Prototype bus was to be built in 3rd quarter 2023, with all buses to be delivered by 1st quarter 2025.

Order was cancelled due to NJ Transit taking back multiple 2017 and 2021-cruiser buses from Academy Bus Lines, DeCamp Bus Lines, Rockland Coaches, and Suburban Transit throughout 2023 and 2024.
