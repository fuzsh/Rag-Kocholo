Roberto Quant, has services in both English and Spanish, to accommodate the needs of the local community. The church operates a school (PK4 to 8) in this church building.\n\nThe church office is open Mon-Fri from 8-12 and 1-5:30. Phone: 405-634-2458 parish@sacredheartokc.org\n\nThe school office is addressed 2700 S. Shartel. Phone: 405-634-5673 principal@sacredheartokc.org\n\nThis is a beautiful brick church, constructed in 1921. The main entrance faces west and has 17 steps up to the entrance. Stepped brick sidewalls flank the staircase. The building has a steep gabled roof with composition shingles. Five large multi-pane arched windows run along the north and south walls of the sanctuary. The brick is accentuated with stone decorative embellishments. The entrance has double metal doors, with a stone surround. Above the entrance, a very large multi-paned arched window rises to a stone sculpture of Christ, and a cross tops the peak.\n\nA brick bell tower rises above the roof on the northwest corner of the building. At the top of the tower a tall slender cone-shaped spire soars to the sky, topped with a cross. At the rear of the church on the east side, the upper level has a brick 8-sided room which projects from the main wall. A two-story brick manse stands south of the church building.\n\nLand for this church was purchased in 1909 from the Mount St. Mary's property to the west. A multi-purpose building stood here from 1911-1919, when work began on this current building. Midnight Mass was first celebrated in this building in 1921, and the building was dedicated on January 2, 1922.\n\nEnglish Services:\n\nSat - 5pm; Sun - 9:15am; Mon-Thurs - 7:15am; Fri - 8:15am\n\nSpanish Services:\n\nSat - 7pm; Sun - 7:30am, 11am, 12:45pm, 2:30pm, 5pm and 7pm\n\nTues-Thurs - 6:30pm\n\nType of Church: ChurchStatus of Building: Actively in use for worshipDate of organization: 01/01/1911Date of building construction: 01/01/1921Archdiocese: Oklahoma CityDiocese: Oklahoma CityAddress/Location:\n\n2706 S.
