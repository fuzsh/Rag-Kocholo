        "text": "This massive tornado, reportedly over a mile and a quarter wide at one point, moved northeast along a 15-mile path from northwest of Newcastle through rural areas between Norman and Moore (through what is now extreme northern Norman and extreme southern Moore), and swept away at least 30 homes. Thirty-three people were killed with 11 people dying in one home, 6 in a second home and 4 in a third home. This tornado was one of at least 5 strong/violent tornadoes in central Oklahoma on this day. This was the second tornado to affect areas near Norman this day with the first one passing just south and east of Norman. The local Norman paper reported that the first tornado \"scared the people of Norman as they never have been scared before.\" In addition, there was a \"general scampering from all parts and a hunt for caves was generally inaugurated.\"\n\nThis tornado formed northwest of the town of Wayne in McClain County near the Canadian River and moved nearly eastward along a hit-and-miss path. In southern Cleveland County, a damage path 3 miles long and 1/4 mile wide was documented. In this area, 3 barns were destroyed, trees snapped, and crops flattened by wind, rain, and hail.\n\nThe tornado continued almost due east and the worst damage was inflicted in a 7-mile-long area near Sacred Heart in southeastern Pottawatomie County and southwestern Seminole County. A tornado was observed 2 miles northwest of Konawa, OK at 6:55 pm CST. Two persons killed and 6 injured in 3 homes which were completely leveled along this path. Many other homes and buildings were damaged. Extensive damage occurred to oil field equipment and a total of 8 rigs were destroyed with losses estimated at $40,000.\n\nOther wind damage was reported near Wetumka, OK, but this damage was probably unrelated to this tornado, and may have been related to another in a series of tornadoes produced by the same parent supercell thunderstorm or another supercell. It is possible that the damage caused in Wetumka was due to straight-line winds.\n\nThis violent tornado was initially observed as it formed in the North Canadian River bottomlands just south of the city of Shawnee OK. Several farmsteads and the Resthaven Cemetery were damaged or destroyed 2 miles east of Shawnee. Several more farmsteads were destroyed and general destruction occurred in the Eoontuohka area. At least 14 farmsteads were destroyed between Prague, OK and Paden, OK at 5:27 pm CST. There was extensive destruction in the area.\n\nThe tornado was described as a huge, white, barrel-shaped cloud that stayed completely on the ground. Northeast of Prague, a million-dollar refinery received about $750,000 in damage. Several company homes were destroyed. Farmsteads were damaged and destroyed all along the rest of the rest of the long path northeastward.\n\nTwo people were killed and eleven injured in the Iron Post area south of Bristow, OK. This tornado caused the most damage as it moved through the west and north portions of Sapulpa, OK at 6:32 pm CST. Three persons were killed and 70 injured, and a total of 1000 people were homeless.\n\nThere were about 300 homes destroyed or damaged. Of this total approximately 100 homes were completely destroyed with 100 more receiving heavy damage and another 100 homes incurring partial damage. A school and 2 churches were also destroyed, and trees and utilities were heavily damaged. The storm covered a 12-15 block area in Sapulpa.\n\nThe funnel lifted northeast of Sapulpa and was observed aloft over Tulsa, OK at 7:00 pm CST. High winds destroyed a house in Tulsa and other general damage was reported. Large hail fell east and northeast of Shawnee, and some hail was observed near the entire path of the tornado.\n\nA parent supercell thunderstorm produced a series of tornadoes from Stratford to Konawa to Wewoka through areas in Okfuskee and Okmulgee counties. The first tornado hit Stratford where considerable damage occurred to 50 homes and several businesses. One person was injured by flying debris in Stratford.\n\nThe next report of a tornado occurred in Seminole County at Konawa where the tornado moved northeastward and cut a 3-blick-wide path of destruction through across the city and through the main business district. About 150 homes and 40 businesses were destroyed or damaged. Seven people were injured in Konawa.\n\nThe same tornado or possibly a new tornado skipped and only produced spotty damage until it reached Wewoka where about 75 houses were damaged in a path the was 2.5 blocks wide and 11 blocks long. Several farmstead were damaged and two people were injured when their car was picked up off OK State Highway 9 about 6 miles west of Wetumka.\n\nMore tornadic damage was evident as several farmsteads, homes, and utility lines were damaged southeast of Pharoah in Okfuskee County and northwest of Henryetta in Okmulgee County, where 1 injury was reported. The last tornado in the series lifted south of Schulter in Okmulgee County.\n\nThe only violent tornado to occur in October in Oklahoma since records began in 1950, did immense damage to the towns of Shawnee and Prague. It formed over Shawnee in Pottawatomie County, and traveled through the center of the town before moving northeast and crossing U.S. Interstate Highway 40 about 6.5 miles northeast of Shawnee. The tornado cut an intermittent path to the northeast and then hit the town of Prague in Lincoln County. The tornado sliced through the southwestern portion of Prague, OK before it dissipated 2 miles north of Paden, in Okfuskee County.\n\nFour persons were killed and another 80 injured in Shawnee. At Prague, four people were injured. In Shawnee, the storm damaged 157 businesses, 564 residential homes, 12 public buildings, 10 churches, and 5 schools. In Prague, 14 homes and 1 business establishment were damaged.\n\nA major severe weather outbreak occurred across western and central Oklahoma from the afternoon of October 4th through the early morning of October 5th, and resulting in 19 tornadoes in the NWS Norman forecast area, straight-line wind damage, hail as large as baseballs, and significant flooding across portions of Lincoln and Noble Counties, where numerous costly bridges were destroyed. A total of 26 tornadoes occurred in Oklahoma during the outbreak, which set a record for the most tornadoes in the state for an autumnal tornado outbreak.\n\nThe 19th and last tornado of the outbreak in the NWS Norman area touched down 5 miles west-northwest of Little, near the intersection of EW 114 Road and NS 351 Road in northwestern Pottawatomie County, where minor tree damage was observed. The tornado, rated F3 in intensity, then increased in size to approximately a 1/2 mile wide as it moved northeast. As it crossed NS 351 Road and then EW 113 Road, a number of outbuildings were heavily damaged, and trees were snapped. Three mobile homes received light damage near the north edge of the path, and 3 other homes received light damage to shingles. The tornado crossed U.S. Interstate Highway I-40 blowing over a truck which was carrying hazardous materials.\n\nThe tornado then continued northeast unroofing a mobile home, causing damage to trees and destroying a number of outbuilding before crossing the North Canadian River into northeast Pottawatomie County. Along EW 110 Road, significant tree damage was observed, and a barn was partially unroofed. The community of Center View near the intersection of OK State Highway 99 and EW 109 Road was then hard hit with most of the damage south and east of this intersection. From the debris pattern, the center of the tornado crossed OK State Highway 99 one-half mile south of EW 109 Road. A house along OK State Highway 99 was unroofed and lost most of its exterior walls. Three homes suffered major damage along EW 109 Road. Two other homes suffered significant damage.\n\nAs the tornado continued moving northeast another home suffered significant roof damage, and the south facing brick wall was buckled. The garage was destroyed. Steel and cinder block from the garage were impaled in a tree. There was also significant damage to large trees. Farther northeast, damage to a roof was noted, and a large number of power lines were downed along NS 357 Road near the intersection of EW 108 Road. One outbuilding was damaged, and light damage was observed in trees just south of EW 107 Road. In total, at least 60 homes or businesses were damaged.\n\nThis tornado formed in rural Pottawatomie County near Independence Road and Drummond Road, or about 6 miles west-northwest of Downtown Shawnee, OK. A few trees were damaged as the tornado moved northeast into the Clarks Heights addition, along U.S. Highway 270, just south of U.S. Interstate Highway I-40. At 45th Street, a portion of a roof was blown off; a nursery was damaged; awnings were destroyed, and trees were downed. As the tornado crossed U.S. Highway 270, the air conditioner was taken off the roof of the El Charro restaurant. Continuing northeast into the West Gate neighborhood, 15 homes suffered significant damage. Three homes were completely unroofed, warranting an F2 rating, and a number of others were partially unroofed. Other homes suffered shingle damage; a number of large trees were downed, and a garage collapsed. Signs were also downed along the interstate adjacent to this neighborhood.\n\nThe next area of significant damage was along the 38800 block of Garrett's Lake Road where a mobile home was destroyed. The frame of the home was blown 50 to 75 yards to the northwest. The disintegration of the mobile home indicated a high F1 or borderline F2 intensity in this area. A few hundred yards to the northeast, the warehouse of Shawnee Light Systems was damaged; one large metal storage building was unroofed, and other buildings were damaged. The tornado crossed Acme Road and struck a number of double-wide mobile homes along Valley View Drive, where one fatality and one serious injury occurred in the same home. The mobile homes most heavily damaged in this area were destroyed, but not disintegrated. To the north, a barn was destroyed, and trees were damaged as the tornado crossed Wolverine Road. The tornado then curved to the north-northwest crossing Acme Road damaging more trees before dissipating.\n\nThis violent tornado touched down a few hundred yards south of the National Weather Center in Norman, OK. The damage intensity increased gradually along the path with significant damage beginning as the tornado approached Lake Thunderbird. This tornado crossed Lake Thunderbird, severely damaging two campgrounds and the marina where about 300 boats were docked.\n\nThe most severe damage occurred from the Little Axe School to the Cleveland/Pottawatomie county line. Trees were stripped of some bark and branches. Large objects were thrown considerable distances, including some concrete pillars. The metal bleachers near the school were tossed or rolled several hundred yards. Some appliances were also lofted as a dryer was found about 50 feet up in a tree. Considerable structural damage also occurred, as some foundation homes were mostly destroyed. In addition to the damage, one person lost their life as a result of the tornado.\n\nThis tornado developed west of SE 120th Avenue between Maguire Road and Cemetery Road. The tornado moved through a mobile home park northeast of SE 120th Avenue and Maguire Road causing significant damage to a number of the mobile homes and injuring 2 people. The tornado continued to cause tree damage as it moved northeast, then heavily damaged the Country Boy IGA grocery store and service station on OK State Highway 9 to the east of Lake Thunderbird. The tornado began to move east-northeast and moved into Pottawatomie County along OK State Highway 9 about one minute before tornado #J1 also crossed into Pottawatomie County at about the same location.\n\nThe tornado moved into Pottawatomie County from Cleveland County and was generally about one mile northeast of tornado #J1 in Pottawatomie County. This tornado continued north of OK State Highway 9 causing tree and roof damage on the west side of OK State Highway 102 before dissipating.\n\nA significant outbreak of severe thunderstorms and tornadoes affected a large part of northern, central, and southern Oklahoma. Tornadoes were most numerous across central and southern Oklahoma, with significant damage occurring over many areas. Severe thunderstorms erupted by midafternoon across northern and western Oklahoma. Given the potent combination of ingredients in place, storms began to produce tornadoes quickly after initiation. Storm motions of 50 to 60 mph were common.\n\nThis tornado lasted for 37 miles and continued into Seminole and Okfuskee counties, with significant damage along almost its entire path. At times, the tornado damage path widened up to a mile. The most significant damage was located north and northeast of Earlsboro near the Pottawatomie/Seminole county border. Here a two-story home was destroyed except for a few interior walls. A pick-up truck was also lofted approximately a quarter of a mile, and a semi-trailer was lofted or rolled approximately 200 yards. Farther east along its path, seven high tension towers were downed. Significant tree damage was reported along the entire track of the tornado, some of them debarked and stripped off all their branches.\n\nAs this tornado continued through Seminole County, it knocked down 7 high tension towers were downed. Several hangers were destroyed at the Seminole Municipal Airport north of Seminole, and one small aircraft was flipped onto one of the destroyed hangers. Two mobile homes were destroyed near the airport and one resident suffered a broken arm. Significant tree damage was reported along the entire track of the tornado, some of them debarked and stripped off all their branches.\n\nThe tornado moved into southwestern Okfuskee County from Seminole County. The tornado snapped or uprooted numerous trees and blew down power poles in Okfuskee County. The estimated peak wind in this segment of the tornado's path based on this damage was 95 mph.\n\nA tornado outbreak occurred over parts of northern and central Oklahoma during the day on May 24th, with violent tornadoes devastating several communities. By the end of the day, one EF-5, two EF-4, and two EF-3 tornadoes destroyed buildings, ripped up trees and power poles, and unfortunately, resulted in 11 deaths. The day began with a strong, upper-level trough ejecting out of the southwest United States. The trough took on a negative tilt as it approached the southern Great Plains. A strong jet stream was located at both the middle and upper levels rotating around the upper trough. At the surface, a low pressure strengthened rapidly over northwest Oklahoma, keeping the low-level flow of warm, moist air to flow east of a dry line that had moved into western Oklahoma. Thunderstorms developed by early afternoon over western Oklahoma, and quickly became supercellular as they moved northeast.\n\nA tornado developed west-southwest of the intersection of Fishmarket Road and Memorial Road to the south-southwest of McLoud. The tornado moved east-northeast where a telephone company building lost its roof, and a number of sheds were damaged. The tornado caused tree damage as it crossed the intersection and Fishmarket and Memorial roads. Extensive tree damage continued northeast of this intersection, at least one home suffered the destruction of an attached garage and a few homes suffered roof and window damage. The tornado turned north-northeast crossing U.S. Interstate Highway I-40 near the Walker Road bridge where it struck and semi-truck, lifting and destroying the trailer, lofting the pieces to the north. The tornado dissipated soon after crossing U.S. Interstate Highway I-40. Although the tornado was very narrow, the rotational velocity of the tornado was observed to be very strong. Monetary damage estimates were not available.\n\nA long track tornado began at 5:00 pm CST (6:00 pm CDT) in Cleveland County in east Norman to the north of Lake Thunderbird along 96th Avenue to the south of Tecumseh Road. The tornado moved northeast, crossing the eastern arm of Lake Thunderbird. A number of homes were significantly damaged as the tornado moved east-northeast through neighborhoods from near Indian Hills Road and 168th Avenue SE to the Pottawatomie County line.\n\nThe large tornado moved east-northeast into Pottawatomie County at 5:20 pm CST then curving northeast as it approached State Highway 102. The tornado moved through a mobile home park north of Independence Road after crossing OK State Highway 102. Just northeast of the mobile home park, a permanent home was destroyed with much of the debris blown well to the northeast. It continued northeast crossing U.S. Interstate Highway I-40 near the intersection of U.S. Highway 177, then curved north-northeast finally dissipating near Wolverine Road and Coker Road at 5:50 PM CST. One fatality occurred in the mobile home park, and another man was killed in his vehicle."
