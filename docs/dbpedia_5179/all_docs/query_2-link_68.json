As of the 2020 census, the population was 72,454.[1] Its county seat is Shawnee.[2]\n\nPottawatomie County is part of the Shawnee, OK Micropolitan Statistical Area, which is included in the Oklahoma City–Shawnee, OK Combined Statistical Area.\n\nHistory[]\n\nPottawatomie County was carved out of land originally given to the Creek and Seminole after their forced removal from Georgia and Florida. After the Civil War, the Creek and Seminole were forced to cede their lands back to the federal government, and the area of Pottawatomie County was used to resettle the Iowa, Sac and Fox, Absentee Shawnee, Potawatomi and Kickapoo tribes.[3]\n\nNon-Indian settlement began on September 22, 1891, when all the tribes except the Kickapoo agreed to land allotment, where communal reservation land was divided and allotted to individual members of the tribes. The remaining land was opened to settlement.[3]\n\nDuring the land run, Pottawatomie County was organized as County \"B\" with Tecumseh as the county seat. In 1892, the voters of the county elected to rename County \"B\" as Pottawatomie County after the Potawatomi Indians.\n\nIn 1895, the Kickapoo gave up their land rights and their land was given away to white settlers in the last land run in Oklahoma.\n\nIn 1930, Shawnee, now bigger in size than Tecumseh, was approved by the voters to become the new county seat. The Pottawatomie County Court House was built in 1934 by the Public Works Administration. The court house project cost $250,000 to complete.[3]\n\nOn May 19, 2013, during an outbreak of tornadoes, a mobile home park was nearly destroyed, killing a 79-year-old man and injuring at least six others as well as damaging at least 35 structures. Frame and brick homes west of Shawnee were also affected.[4]\n\nGeography[]\n\nAccording to the U.S. Census Bureau, the county has a total area of 793 square miles (2,050 km2), of which 788 square miles (2,040 km2) is land and 5.7 square miles (15 km2) (0.7%) is water.[5]\n\nAdjacent counties[]\n\nLincoln County (north)\n\nOkfuskee County (northeast)\n\nSeminole County (east)\n\nPontotoc County (southeast)\n\nMcClain County (southwest)\n\nCleveland County (west)\n\nOklahoma County (northwest)\n\nDemographics[]\n\nHistorical populations Census Pop. %± 1900 26,412 — 1910 43,595 65.1% 1920 46,028 5.6% 1930 66,572 44.6% 1940 54,377 −18.3% 1950 43,517 −20.0% 1960 41,486 −4.7% 1970 43,134 4.0% 1980 55,239 28.1% 1990 58,760 6.4% 2000 65,521 11.5% 2010 69,442 6.0% U.S. Decennial Census[6]\n\n1790-1960[7] 1900-1990[8]\n\n1990-2000[9] 2010-2019[10] 2020 census[1]\n\nAs of the census of 2010,[11] there were 69,442 people, 25,911 households, and 18,227 families residing in the county.
