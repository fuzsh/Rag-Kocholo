        "text": "Welcome to Mass Times.\n\nThe purpose of the Mass Times ministry is to help Catholics get to Mass by helping them find churches and worship times worldwide. We do this by hosting and sharing the most comprehensive database of Catholic churches and worship times in existence. It can be difficult for Catholics to find a Mass when traveling or when it is not practical to attend their regular parishes. Mass Times makes it much easier to search for a Mass by presenting all the possibilities in a geographical area on one page.\n\nMasstimes relies on modern web browser technology. You may get better results in a different web browser (such as Chrome) or by a force-refresh (Ctrl-F5)."
