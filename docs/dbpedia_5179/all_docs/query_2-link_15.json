        "text": "What is the history of the Sacred Heart Cemetery in Konawa Oklahoma?\n\nOnce upon a time – a long, long time ago – what is now the Sacred Heart Cemetery in Konawa, Oklahoma was a convent and girls’ school. It dates as far back as 1876, though it was destroyed by a devastating fire in 1901 and rebuilt. Interestingly, there are still ruins of buildings past on the grounds, which most certainly doesn’t help the allegations of hauntings and spooky goings-on that are said to be afoot.\n\nWhere are some legitimately haunted cemeteries in Oklahoma?\n\nOklahoma is a state that’s been around for a long time. It’s got hundreds (literally HUNDREDS) of ghost towns long forgotten and scattered about, and many of those forgotten places are homes to forgotten cemeteries. How many of those do you bet are haunted? Some allegedly haunted cemeteries in Oklahoma aren’t even in ghost towns; some never ceased operations and are still open and used to this day. Among the most allegedly haunted cemeteries in Oklahoma are spooky hidden gems like the Fort Reno Cemetery, in El Reno, where many dark things are known to have happened over the years. The Enid Cemetery is supposedly so haunted that there are guided ghost tours of it from time to time, and supposedly, a witch buried at Hillside Cemetery in Skiatook in the early 1900s still enjoys making a mess of the place.\n\nWhere is the most haunted place in Oklahoma?"
