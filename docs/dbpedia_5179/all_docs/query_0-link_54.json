        "text": "The tornado formed 3 miles north and 8 miles east of Cleo Springs and moved along an east-southeast path causing only minor damage until it reached OK State Highway 58 about 2 miles north of Ringwood, OK where it destroyed 2 mobile homes. The tornado then grew wider and intensified, producing heavy damage to about a dozen farms in eastern Major County. It leveled all buildings at a farm northeast of Ringwood. About 1 mile east and 1 mile north of Meno, the twister hit a farmhouse as the occupants were trying to flee in a pickup truck. Two people were injured and a girl was killed when she was thrown about 100 yards from the home.\n\nAt 4:55 pm, the tornado moved through the southern and eastern parts of Lahoma, OK. Three mobile homes were destroyed and about 6 more were damaged. Two houses were heavily damaged with others receiving less damage. The high school, town hall and fire department building were also damaged, and minor damage occurred to other numerous structures.\n\nThe tornado weakened and narrowed as it moved east-southeast, striking the Perry Acres housing development west of Enid, OK. A pickup truck was overturned and a van was heavily damaged. Several other vehicles also received damage. A barn was destroyed and several homes received significant damage. The chimneys for at least two homes collapsed within the houses. At one location, a travel trailer was thrown 50 feet in one direction while a stock tank was carried about 0.25 miles in the opposite direction.\n\nThe tornado then moved through the Imo area, about 4 southwest of Enid. One man suffered a heart; attack and died while seeking shelter at a grain elevator near Imo. His two sons were injured while trying to break glass in a window to get access to a telephone. The grain elevator was damaged, and two persons were injured when the structure later collapsed onto their pickup. The tornado then dissipated about 1 mile east of Imo at 5:15 pm. Large hail and heavy rains accompanied the storm.\n\nThe \"Westport\" tornado was the sixth in a series of 9 tornadoes that occurred in Oklahoma during the April 26, 1991 tornado outbreak. This tornado went along a 32-mile path from 1.5 miles west-southwest of Terlton to 1 mile north-northwest of Skiatook. It began at 7:10 pm CST and ended at 8:27 pm CST. The tornado narrowly missed the town of Terlton as it moved east-northeast. Northeast of Terlton and west of State Highway 48, the tornado was weak (F0 damage to trees.) The tornado strengthened as it crossed Highway 48, 0.5 miles south of the Cimarron Turnpike, and produced F1 and F2 intensity damage to structures and power poles. Up to that point it had been one-eighth mile in width.\n\nAfter crossing Highway 48, the tornado widened rapidly to about 1 mile and intensity increased to F4 strength as it crossed the turnpike. Several cars were swept off the turnpike with five injuries and one fatality. A man was killed when his car was overturned.\n\nThe tornado then crossed into the Keystone Airpark at 7:30 pm CST and caused significant damage to four hangers, and seven aircraft were destroyed. Two of the planes were tossed into trees. The fire station at the airport was demolished, with one of the fire engines pushed across the runway and flung into an area of trees about 0.25 miles away.\n\nThe Ridgemont Estates Subdivision 1 mile east of Westport was hard hit, with F4 damage occurring to homes and trees. In the Westport area, 54 homes were completely demolished, 8 homes suffered substantial damage, and 32 homes suffered minor damage. Also destroyed were 70 vehicles, 5 mobile homes, 18 outbuildings, and 3 travel trailers. The community center at Westport suffered damage. There were no fatalities and no reported injuries at Westport. The tornado was 400-yards wide in the Westport area.\n\nThe tornado crossed Keystone Lake into Osage County at 7:44 pm CST, and briefly lifted in the vicinity of New Prue. The tornado then touched down again east-northeast of New Prue, 0.5 miles southwest of the John Zink Scout Ranch and destroyed the lodge there, where a group of Girl Scouts had taken cover. There were no reported injuries among the scouts. All trees along the path of the tornado were snapped off or uprooted, as it continued to the northeast, to the extreme south edge of Skiatook Lake, where some boat docks and a marina were damaged. The tornado continued to 1.5 miles west of Skiatook on Highway 20 where there was damage to a propane company at 8:15 pm CST.\n\nThe tornado moved on to a subdivision 1 mile west-northwest of Skiatook, where 32 homes were destroyed, 11 homes suffered major damage, and 45 homes suffered minor damage. There were 19 injuries in the Skiatook area. The damage was rated at F3 intensity. The tornado continued northeast for a short time and lifted at 8:27 pm CST, shortly before crossing the Tulsa County line. Damage was estimated from this storm at close to $3 million.\n\nThis tornado occurred with an isolated supercell that moved northeastward from Texas across the Red River into southern Love County, and then north- northeastward into Carter County. Air and ground surveys conducted on May 8 (the day after the tornado) revealed a damage path 500 to 700 yards wide and 34 miles long across Love and Carter Counties in Oklahoma, with damage in places consistent with a strong tornado on the high end of the F3 category. Three fatalities and at least 6 injuries are attributed to this tornado.\n\nFollowing the tornado's path as it moved across Oklahoma, the tornado crossed the Red River into Oklahoma at a point 4 miles south-southeast of Leon (or about 3.5 miles south-southwest of Jimtown) at approximately 3:24 PM CST. The tornado moved northeast and remained near F0/F1 intensity until it reached the Red River RV Ranch on the south side of Highway 96 about 1 mile west of Burneyville. At this RV park, 18 RV's, 12 cabins, 1 store, 1 guard shack, 1 equestrian center, 7 outbuildings, 5 single-family homes, and 1 mobile home were destroyed. One other single-family home also suffered minor damage. At the entrance to the park, several vehicles, including a delivery van, were rolled off the highway and flipped over. The damage path at this point was 400 to 500 yards wide, and damage was rated as F2.\n\nFrom there, the tornado crossed Highway 96 to the Falconhead Resort area, where the worst damage was suffered. 20 homes were destroyed and 20 others sustained major or minor damage, including numerous brick homes. At least one of these homes lost all but the northeast exterior wall and a few interior walls in the northeast part of the house. An aircraft hangar and a maintenance building were also destroyed. The damage was rated on the high end of F3 at this point, and the path was measured to be 500 to 600 yards wide.\n\nOne half mile north of the Highway 32/Highway 96 intersection, 2 of the 3 fatalities occurred. An 83-year-old female and her 87-year-old sister were killed when their frame home on the west side of the road was picked up and blown 50 feet into a wooded area on the east side of the road. Less than a mile north of this site, the 3rd fatality occurred. A 78-year-old man was killed in his home, while his wife was severely injured. Widespread tree damage was evident along this entire section of the tornado's path, and the intensity along this stretch was rated as F2.\n\nThe tornado then decreased to F0/F1 strength and continued north-northeastward across the Love/Carter County Line and toward Ardmore. In Carter County, at least 4 homes, 2 businesses, and 1 public building were destroyed. Four other homes, 5 businesses, and 1 public building received major damage, with minor damage at an additional 5 homes, 6 businesses, and 1 public building.\n\nSpecifically, on the southwest side of Ardmore, the tornado strengthened and hit a subdivision of new, well-built homes. The worst damage consisted of 1 or 2 homes that were almost completely unroofed, and had some interior walls down. Damage here was rated at F2. The tornado also hit a high school just north of this subdivision, removing portions of the roof and damaging windows. This damage was rated at the high end of the F1 category.\n\nThe tornado then continued northward, paralleling I- 35 on the west edge of Ardmore, and struck a Uniroyal/Michelin tire plant on the west side of the interstate. Significant damage to the sheet metal exterior and roof were noted; however, no structural damage to the steel frame was apparent. In the parking lot immediately to the east of the plant, dozens of automobiles and pickup trucks were damaged or destroyed. Some were tossed, flipped, and stacked on top of one another. At least 1 semi-truck was flipped over on the southwest side of the plant. Based on the damage to the plant and vehicles, the intensity at this point was rated F2.\n\nImmediately north of the tire plant, witnesses reported that the tornado began to go into its dissipation stage. One or two plate glass windows were blown out at a Love's Truck Stop. The canopies over the pump areas and most signs were also destroyed. Damage was rated at F1 here. An electronics warehouse under construction just north of this truck stop had 3 of 4 exterior walls knocked down. At a point about 2 miles north of the Uniroyal/Michelin plant, the tornado took a sharp east-northeast turn and rapidly dissipated at 4:14 PM CST.\n\nTotal damage across Love and Carter Counties exceeded $100 million dollars, with $75 million dollars' worth of damage in Ardmore alone. Actual damage at the Uniroyal Plant was valued at $45 million, and later production losses due to the damage were estimated at 1.5 million tires.\n\nThis violent, long-lived tornado was the most infamous of nearly 60 tornadoes that struck central Oklahoma during an unprecedented outbreak on this Monday afternoon and evening of May 3, 1999. The tornado was the 9th of 14 tornadoes produced by a supercell thunderstorm during the tornado outbreak. It formed around 526 pm CST about 2 miles south-southwest of Amber, and grew rapidly to monstrous proportions as it headed NE, paralleling I-44. It moved across Bridge Creek and rural parts of northwest Newcastle, causing continuous F4 and sporadic F5 damage. The tornado was estimated to be a mile in diameter in this area.\n\nIt weakened to F2/F3 intensity and narrowed to less than 1/4 mile in width as it crossed I-44 and the South Canadian River northeast of Newcastle and entered far south Oklahoma City SW of 149th and May Ave. around 612 pm CST. But it regained F4/F5 intensity and widened again to 1/2 to occasionally 3/4 mile as it moved northeast across south Oklahoma City, entering Moore just west and north of 12th and Santa Fe.\n\nStill moving northeast and still producing F4 and occasional F5 damage, it crossed I-35 at the Shields Blvd. junction and moved into northeast Moore, at which point it weakened slightly to F3/sporadic F4 intensity and began a gradual turn to the left. This turn took the tornado more to the north-northeast as it crossed I-240 between Bryant Ave. and Sunnylane Rd. It crossed southeastern Oklahoma City and entered Del City as an F4 tornado, width 1/3 to 1/2 mile, along SE 44th between Sunnylane and Sooner Roads, and continued north-northeast to the northwestern part of Tinker Air force Base, near SE 29th and Sooner Rd.\n\nContinuing to turn slowly, it moved almost due north but maintained F4 intensity as it crossed I-40 just east of Sooner Rd. and continued north to between SE 15th and Reno Ave. The tornado then weakened rapidly to F0/F1 intensity as it crossed Reno Ave., and at 648 pm CST dissipated about 3 blocks north of Reno between Sooner Rd. and Air Depot Blvd.\n\nTotals from this tornado include 36 direct fatalities (12 in Bridge Creek, 1 in Newcastle, 9 in southern/southeastern Oklahoma City, 5 in Moore, 6 in Del City, and 3 in Midwest City), 5 indirect fatalities during or shortly after the tornado, 583 direct injuries, numerous indirect injuries (too many to count), 1800 homes destroyed, and 2500 homes damaged. The tornado was also the 100th tornado to strike the Oklahoma City area since 1890. Total damage was estimated at $1 billion.\n\nThis violent tornado, which killed two people, was the last of 20 tornadoes produced by one cyclic supercell thunderstorm which moved over Caddo, Canadian, Kingfisher, Logan, Payne and Noble counties during the May 3, 1999 tornado outbreak. The tornado formed about 7 miles southwest of Crescent and tracked northeast for 39 miles before dissipating east of Perry in Noble County. A very unusual event took place in Logan County where this tornado, and a second tornado produced by another supercell thunderstorm about 80 minutes later, affected much of the same area between Crescent and Mulhall in Logan County. Assessment of damage from the individual tornadoes was difficult, and in some areas nearly impossible, due to overlapping damage paths.\n\nDamage from the tornado was first observed about 2 miles west of the intersection of SH33 and SH74 near Twin Lakes Rd., where 2 homes and other businesses were damaged. The width of damage is believed to have increased to nearly 1 mile as it tracked east of Crescent where numerous homes suffered major damage. Damage to 1 brick residence 3 miles east-southeast of Crescent was rated F4. All walls were knocked down, and part of the foundation was removed.\n\nThe tornado then tracked through the small community of Abell (6 miles southwest of Mulhall), where 1 woman was killed in her home, and 6 people were injured, and then finally through Mulhall. Approximately 60%-70% of Mulhall's 130 homes were severely damaged or destroyed. In addition, Mulhall's primary water source, a water tower, and the Mulhall/Orlando Elementary School were destroyed.\n\nLesser damage continued to about ½ mile west of the Logan/Payne County border where tombstones and fences were blown over. Along Interstate 35 in northwest Payne County, a semi-truck trailer was overturned, and 2 cars were flipped. The driver of one of the cars was killed when his vehicle, parked under the Interstate 35 overpass at mile-marker 176.5, was picked up and dropped on its top.\n\nIn Noble County, the tornado produced major structural damage in the Boonsboro Addition, a mobile home park located along State Highway 86, 6 miles south of Perry. Approximately 20 mobile homes were destroyed, and dozens of others were damaged. Damage continued northward to a location 3 miles east of Perry, where 3 homes suffered major damage on US 64 and 1 critical injury was reported. In total, approximately 25 homes were destroyed in Noble County, and 50 homes were damaged. Total damage was estimated at $13.1 million.\n\nThis tornado began very close to the Caddo/Canadian County border and quickly became a strong/violent tornado. The tornado destroyed numerous trees, many of which were debarked, before crossing U.S. Interstate Highway 40. Three people died in vehicles near the I-40 Calumet exit, and two other fatalities occurred just northeast of that location. Cars were thrown thousands of feet off the roadways. It is believed that the tornado reached its maximum intensity just after crossing I-40, and it was here that a mobile radar measured winds of greater than 210 mph just off the surface.\n\nThe tornado side-swiped the El Reno Oklahoma Mesonet station (located 5 miles west of El Reno) along its path, and the site measured wind gusts of 131 and 151 mph. From this location, the tornado continued northeast, narrowly missing the town of Piedmont. Widespread EF-3, occasional EF-4 damage occurred between El Reno and Piedmont. More widespread EF-4 damage was seen west and north of Piedmont. Especially hard hit was the Falcon Lake neighborhood, near the Kingfisher County border. Two children were killed at this location.\n\nThe tornado entered far southeast Kingfisher County before moving into Logan County. However, EF-3 damage occurred just over the Kingfisher County border, debarking trees and significantly damaging buildings. As the tornado continued northeast, the damage was mainly considered EF-2, with damage to mostly outbuildings and trees. The tornado then continued into Logan County.\n\nThe tornado moved into Logan County and resulted in two additional fatalities (both of whom were outside when the tornado struck) near Cashion. The tornado destroyed several manufactured homes (both double and single-wide) after entering Logan County. Large high-transmission line tresses collapsed. Trees were debarked with only stumps remaining. Several buildings had most of their exterior walls collapse, with only the inner walls remaining. EF-2 to occasionally EF-3 damage occurred as the tornado neared Guthrie. Luckily, most of the town of Guthrie was spared to the tornado as it moved west and then north of the center of the city. Finally, the tornado dissipated northeast of Guthrie with some minor tree damage. The tornado’s path total path length was 63 miles, and it was on the ground for nearly one hour and 45 minutes. This was the first EF-5 tornado to occur in Oklahoma since the Enhanced Fujita Scale was adopted by the National Weather Service in 2007.\n\nThe violent Newcastle-Moore tornado was first observed at 1:56 PM CST (2:56 PM CDT) developing about one-half mile south of Oklahoma State Highway 37 in northwest Newcastle to the east of Rockwell Avenue. EF4 damage was observed soon after the tornado crossed State Highway 37. The tornado continued to expand in size as it approached the Canadian River and moved into Cleveland County.\n\nThe tornado then moved into Cleveland County at 2:04 PM CST from McClain County as it moved northeast across the Canadian River near U.S. Interstate Highway 44. The tornado then turned more east and then east-northeast after crossing I-44. Violent E-F4 damage was again observed as it began to move into progressively higher density residential areas approaching May Avenue.\n\nThe center of the large tornado path passed near SW 149th Street and Western Avenue. After crossing Western Avenue, numerous buildings were destroyed and horses killed at Orr Family Farm. Two storage tanks estimated to weigh approximately 10 tons were lifted from Orr Family Farm and landed about one-half mile east.\n\nMoving east, the tornado destroyed much of Briarwood Elementary School, where the NWS storm survey team rated damage as EF-5. Despite the destruction of this elementary school during school hours, no fatalities occurred at the school. As the tornado continued to move east and east-northeast, it moved through much more densely populated suburban neighborhoods of southwest Oklahoma City and Moore where violent destruction was widespread.\n\nThe width of EF-4 and greater damage was up to 250 yards wide as the tornado moved through neighborhoods east of Western Avenue. The first two fatalities occurred in a house in the neighborhood just east of Briarwood Elementary, with another fatality in a house as the tornado approached Santa Fe Avenue.\n\nAfter crossing Santa Fe Avenue, the tornado moved through more suburban neighborhoods and toward Plaza Towers Elementary School. Damage to the school was extensive and seven children were killed when a wall collapsed at the school. Nine other people were killed in eight different neighborhood homes within one-quarter mile of Plaza Towers Elementary, most occurring just south of the school.\n\nThe tornado turned northeast as it approached Telephone Road, made a loop near the intersection of Telephone Road and 4th Street, then moved southeast crossing the interstate. Three people were killed when a convenience store along Telephone Road was destroyed. Crossing Telephone Road, the tornado inflicted significant damage to the Moore Medical Center, a post office and numerous businesses along Telephone Road and U.S. Interstate Highway 35.\n\nAlthough the tornado was narrower after crossing I-35, it continued to produce EF-4 damage in neighborhoods east of the interstate as it curved east and then again east-northeast. One fatality occurred at a business just east of the interstate, and one final fatality occurred in a home between Eastern Avenue and Bryant Avenue. Consistent EF-4 damage continued until the tornado passed SE 4th Street just east of Bryant Avenue.\n\nMoving east from Bryant Avenue, the tornado continued to produce EF-2 damage with isolated EF-4 damage noted. The density of housing also decreased east of Bryant as the tornado moved east and east-northeast before dissipating at 2:35 PM CST east of Air Depot Blvd. between SE 119th Street and SE 134th Street in southeast Oklahoma City. Overall, over 300 homes experienced EF-4/EF-5 damage along the tornado path.\n\nOn May 31, 2013, an intense, long-track tornado formed southwest of El Reno. This exceptionally wide tornado took a complex path, rapidly changing in both speed and direction. The tornado spared El Reno and its airport from a direct hit, tracking just south of those locations. The tornado damaged numerous homes along with a few businesses near El Reno. Additionally, intense sub-vortices destroyed crops in numerous fields in the area.\n\nThe tornado developed at 5:03 PM CST (6:03 PM CDT) just northeast of the intersection of Heaston and Reuter roads. Initially, the tornado moved to the southeast at 20 to 25 mph. At 5:09 PM CST, the tornado turned to the east, just south of Reno Road between Heaston and Brandley roads. The tornado continued to expand in size just southwest of the El Reno Municipal Air Park, where its speed increased to 30 to 40 mph. As the tornado passed just south of the airport, two satellite tornadoes formed briefly on the west side of the tornado.\n\nAt 5:19 PM CST the tornado crossed Highway 81 near Reno Road as it continued to expand in size. There, the tornado abruptly turned to the north, while also accelerating to greater than 50 mph. From 5:24 to 5:26 PM CST, the tornado reached its maximum in size and intensity near the intersection of Radio and Reuter roads. The tornado, still very large, slowed down as it approached U.S. Interstate Highway 40. From 5:27 to 5:35 PM CST the tornado made a loop just north of the interstate while decelerating to less than 10 mph. After 5:35 PM CST, the tornado moved east once again, and dissipated at 5:42 PM CST near the intersection of I-40 and Banner Road.\n\nEight people were killed in the tornado, all in vehicles. This included three severe storm researchers who were killed east of U.S. Highway 81 as the tornado overtook their position. Additionally, several other people were killed while attempting to escape the tornado near Highway 81. Finally, two people were killed along I-40 while waiting for the storm to pass.\n\nThe monetary damages were estimated. This tornado was well sampled by two separate mobile research radar teams – the University of Oklahoma RaXPol radar, and the Center for Severe Weather Research’s Doppler on Wheels. Both radars captured high temporal and spatial resolution data relatively close to the large tornado. Both radars measured winds in the tornado of more than 200 mph. The RaXPol radar data shows winds of at least 295 mph very close to the surface. These intense winds were present in very small sub-vortices within the larger tornado circulation. An analysis of the high-resolution radar data combined with the results of the ground damage survey indicates that none of these intense sub-vortices impacted any structures in rural Canadian County. So, despite the measured wind speeds, surveyors could not find any damage that would support a rating higher than EF-3 based solely on the damage indicators used with the EF scale.\n\nThe maximum tornado width was 2.6 miles. However, the damaging wind swath was much larger, as non-tornadic downdraft winds extended for at least a mile south of the tornado. Given the difficulty of separating this damage from tornadic damage, the OU RaXPol radar was used to help determine the width.\n\nThe tornado began at 4:29 PM CST (5:29 PM CDT) over open country southwest of a ranch home 3.4 miles southwest of Quapaw, OK. The first damage from the tornado was that ranch home, which lost numerous shingles, a nearby barn was damaged, a mobile home had siding removed, and large tree limbs were snapped in this area. The tornado moved northeast and snapped several power poles and hardwood trees. Based on photographs, the tornado had very little condensation associated with it until it neared U.S. Highway 69a just outside of Quapaw, where it snapped trees and destroyed a barn.\n\nThe tornado then moved into the town, where it severely damaged several metal buildings, including the fire station. Numerous homes were severely damaged, and several had their roofs blown off. Several buildings in town were destroyed. Many areas of damage in Quapaw were rated EF-2.\n\nTwo people were in a vehicle that was parked against one of those buildings, in an attempt to take shelter from the approaching tornado. The brick and concrete walls of the building collapsed on top of the vehicle, crushing it and killing a 68-year-old male and injuring a female.\n\nSeveral other vehicles in this area were damaged from flying debris. About a dozen injuries occurred in town, 7 of which were serious enough to warrant being transported to medical facilities. Numerous trees and power poles were snapped. The tornado continued to move northeast from Quapaw, snapping numerous trees and power poles, and damaging homes and outbuildings.\n\nThe tornado crossed the state line into Kansas at 4:25 PM CST and moved into the town of Baxter Springs, producing a 150-yard-wide swath of damage from southwest to northeast through the center of town. Numerous homes and businesses were damaged or destroyed in Baxter Springs, and 25 injuries were reported. Several areas of EF-2 damage were noted, with areas of EF-0 and EF-1 damage surrounding the more significant damage swath.\n\nThe tornado dissipated at 4:42 pm CST, 2.5 miles northeast of Baxter Springs, KS. Local emergency management in Kansas reported 25 injuries with 9 of those people being hospitalized. The total path of the tornado was 7 miles in Oklahoma and another 4.3 miles in Kansas. The maximum width of the tornado was 325 yards in Oklahoma and 150 yards wide in the Baxter Springs, KS area.\n\nAt about 10:00 PM CST, this tornado touched down in northern Kay County about 4 miles north of Peckham and then moved north into Kansas. No injuries or deaths were reported, and the tornado damage was minimal in Oklahoma. This tornado was produced by the same parent supercell thunderstorm that had generated the violent tornado that struck Blackwell, OK earlier that evening.\n\nThe tornado crossed the Kansas state line due south of Ashton, KS and moved northward across the extreme eastern part of Sumner County to near Oxford, passing along the west side of Geuda Springs. At 10:15 PM CST, the tornado was located five miles south of Oxford. As is moved northward, it swung eastward around the town of Oxford to a farm three miles north-northeast of Oxford where it took the lives of five children of one family.\n\nAt 10:30 PM CST, the tornado plowed into the town of Udall, KS which had population of 500 people in 1955. It almost completely destroyed the town, killing 75 of the inhabitants, causing major injuries to 165 persons, and less serious injuries to 105 others.\n\nAfter exiting Udall, the storm was reported to have moved to the east-northeastward, passing the town of Rock on the south and lifting just north of Atlanta. However, the damage east of Udall may have been caused by downburst winds. The main damage was along a path which varied in width from 1/4 to 1/2 mile. The path was irregular and indicated occasional swinging of the funnel as much as a mile on either side of a smoothed path.\n\nFarm buildings and farm implements sustained heavy damage. No estimate was computed of the amount of crop damage left by this storm. Damage to other property was estimated at $2.225 million. This storm is still the deadliest tornado in Kansas history. Although it is listed as a F5 tornado for Oklahoma, the F5 damage produced by this tornado occurred only in Kansas.\n\nAlthough listed a single tornado, this event was probably a family of tornadoes produced by the same supercell thunderstorm. The initial tornado began in Kay County 6 miles southeast Newkirk, OK at 9:30 pm CST, and only minor damage was reported in this area. This tornado apparently lifted before it reached the Arkansas River.\n\nWhat was probably the second tornado in the series touched down east of the Arkansas River and continued moving northeast. It had a multiple vortex phase as witnesses observed several funnels merged into one southwest of the town of Hardy in Kay County. This violent tornado hit Hardy, and 2 people were injured in Hardy when their home was leveled. Many farm buildings were completely destroyed as well in the area as well. Six cattle and a horse were killed on one of the farms.\n\nThe tornado appears to have crossed the Kansas state line into southeastern Cowley County and moved northeast south of Maple City at 9:45 pm CST. It continued northeast passing 3 miles east of Grenola and ended 5 miles northwest of Howard. No fatalities occurred with this storm, but a total of 25 people were injured including the 2 persons in Oklahoma.\n\nNumerous houses, barns, businesses, and sheds were damaged or completely demolished along the tornado's path. The wind velocities from the tornado were so strong that a plastic belt was driven into a piece of tree by force in Maple City-Otto area. Witnesses reported the tornado as sounding like a loud roar or a whistle. This tornado may have traveled through Kay County in Oklahoma, and Cowley, Chautauqua and Elk Counties in Kansas.\n\nAnother tornado then formed 4 miles southwest of Toronto and struck the Toronto area at 10:58 pm CST. The tornado produced F4 damage to a home 1 mile north of Toronto a killed one person there. The continued to the northeast before turning more to the north and dissipating 2 miles southeast of the town of Gridley in Coffey County. A baby was killed in a home 3 miles south of Gridley and the body was carried for over a mile from the home. West of Toronto, KS a house simply “fell apart” when the tornado hit. Several reports showed that other people were also carried variable distances in the air. In addition to the 2 fatalities, another 4 were injured by this tornado. This violent tornado may have traveled Greenwood, Woodson and Coffey Counties in Kansas.\n\nThis violent tornado formed 2 miles north of Thalia, TX in Foard County. The tornado touched down 1.5 miles southeast of the first tornado produced by the parent supercell thunderstorm, which was still on the ground at 3:20 PM CST. The tornadoes traveled as a pair for 5 miles, with the second tornado continuing into Wilbarger County at about the time the first tornado ended near the Pease River.\n\nThe Wilbarger County tornado moved along and just north of Highway 70 in the Lockett area, causing heavy farm and home damage. The tornado became a killer as it crossed Highway 70 about 1 mile north of Lockett, TX. A female resident of Thalia died when her car was thrown about 200 yards off of the road into a pasture. Automobiles were also to play a major role in many of the tornado deaths later in the afternoon.\n\nAfter striking the Lockett area, the tornado continued its northeastward movement toward Vernon. Photographs from Vernon show that the approaching tornado was very wide, appearing as a giant, boiling cloud on the ground. Tornado spotters had difficulty identifying the storm at first because of its massive size. However, tornado sirens were blown several minutes prior to the storm, an action that alerted many residents to the approaching danger. Fortunately, the tornado just missed the business district, but dealt a crippling blow to southern and eastern Vernon after entering the town at about 3:45 PM CST.\n\nIn southern Vernon, a multi-block residential area was destroyed, with some of the worst damage on Gordon and Atlanta Streets. At least three people were killed in their homes within this area. The tornado then moved into east Vernon where the Sands Motel, Canton cafe, a truck stop, Merchants Motor Freight, and Cardinal Equipment Building Company were all demolished. The Wilbarger Exhibit Building and the Texas Highway Department Warehouse were also destroyed.\n\nSeven people were killed when the tornado swept a number of cars and trucks off Highway 287. The cars were nothing more than compacted masses of twisted metal after being blown off the road. After killing 10 people in Vernon and 1 in Lockett, the tornado crossed the Pease River killing a number of cows on the north bank.\n\nAfter striking Vernon, Texas, the tornado moved northeast and crossed the Red River to the southwest of Davidson, Oklahoma and several miles west of the confluence point of the Pease and Red Rivers at 3:45 PM CST. The tornado moved east-northeast of Davidson and dissipated around 4:00 PM CST. At least 3 homes were destroyed with 5 more sustaining major damage. Many cattle were killed or injured. One man was injured when his car was thrown into a ditch. The tornado was on the ground in Oklahoma for a distance of 8 miles.\n\nIn its wake, the tornado left $27,000,000 in damage, with other damage coming from large hail and strong straight-line winds in the Vernon area. The tornado was on the ground for 26 miles in Texas and 11 miles in Oklahoma, with its parent thunderstorm producing three additional tornadoes in Oklahoma.\n\nThe tornado first touched down at about 3:55 pm in the vicinity of Harrold, Texas, or about 16 miles southwest of Vernon. Two Oklahoma University meteorology students photographed the large tornado, which descended from a rotating wall cloud under the southwest flank of the severe thunderstorm.\n\nThe tornado moved across Highway 287, killing one person 200 yards west of the Texas Farm Road 1763 overpass. An official from the Texas Department of Public Safety stated that a woman had left her car to take refuge under the wheels of a semi-trailer truck when the tornado approached. She was killed when the tornadic winds caused the truck wheels to roll over her. The accident occurred on level ground, and was not the result of faulty brakes.\n\nThe tornado continued moving northeast, and caused light damage before entering Wichita County about 5 miles northeast of Harrold. Additional light rural damage occurred in the miles of Wichita County that the tornado covered. The half-mile wide tornado crossed the Red River into Oklahoma about 9 miles north-northeast of Electra at about 4:10 pm. It then began to intensify and reached maximum strength at the Grandfield Airport at about 4:30 pm. It moved northeast and crossed Highway 5 west of Walters. It continued northeast and crossed US Highway 281/177 about 11 miles south of the Lawton Airport. The tornado passed through the Pumpkin Center area around 5:30 pm and moved across Oklahoma Highway 7, where it damaged homes on both sides of the highway.\n\nThis was a very wide tornado, and 55 miles of its of 64-mile path were traversed in Oklahoma. Large hail was reported with the storm. In the Grandfield area, it damaged or destroyed 8 homes and 4 mobile homes. The Grandfield Airport was demolished, with 8 planes being destroyed and 1 damaged. Near Grandfield, 1 man was seriously injured when he tried to outrun the tornado but was overtaken. Two additional injuries were reported in the area.\n\nNorthwest of Walters, 4 houses and 1 mobile home were destroyed and 4 other homes were damaged. A grain elevator was demolished on Highway 5, and another destroyed near Hulen. In the Pumpkin Center area, 5 homes and 8 mobile homes were destroyed. Some of these homes had been hit by a tornado on April 5, 1978.\n\nThe tornado began of the southwest flank of its supercell thunderstorm about 3 miles east-northeast of Holliday. Witnesses say the several distinct, small vortices were visible during the formative stage of the tornado as it moved along the Fort Worth and Denver railroad into Wichita County. Two oil storage tanks were blown away and several homes were unroofed near Farm Road 2650 as the tornado approached Wichita Falls. Six cross-country steel transmission towers were destroyed just east of Farm Road 2650.\n\nAbout the time the tornado entered town, it changed appearance, becoming one large black cloud of condensation and debris. The tornado was about a half-mile wide when it struck Memorial Stadium, snapping light standards and causing heavy damage to the field house. McNeil Junior High school was next in the path of the tornado and the school was severely damaged. The western portion of the school building was crushed by the intense winds.\n\nThe tornado then moved east-northeast into the Western Hills neighborhood, south of Southwest Parkway. Several apartment complexes and many homes were destroyed, with several of the first deaths occurring in this area. The tornado expanded in size as it crossed Southwest parkway, throwing automobiles about and leveling a number of businesses, including a bank and a fire station.\n\nThe twister was almost a mile wide when it entered the Faith Village neighborhood on the north side of the east-west oriented Southwest Parkway. Most of the homes in Faith Village were demolished. Ben Milam Elementary School was heavily damaged, as the cafeteria-auditorium was completely destroyed and exterior class rooms were pummeled by flying debris. The inner hallways would have been the only relatively safe shelter in the building. Surprisingly, very few fatalities occurred in Faith Village. Most people heeded the warnings and took shelter inside interior, small rooms in their homes. Most of the destroyed homes had some of these interior walls still standing after the tornado.\n\nAfter moving out of Faith Village, the tornado flattened several businesses, including a restaurant, on Kemp Boulevard. Three people were killed in the restaurant. A number of people were also killed or injured in the parking lot of Sikes Senter (sic) Mall, also on Kemp Boulevard. Some of these people attempted to run to their cars from the mall. Inside the mall, portions of the JCPenney store collapsed while other stores sustained light to moderate damage. No one was killed and only several major injuries occurred among the approximately one thousand shoppers who were in the mall. The mall was on the north side of the tornado path and appeared to escape the most violent winds. Near the center of the tornado and about a half mile south of the mall, a church was demolished with one person killed inside the building.\n\nThe tornado then crossed a short span of open fields before moving into the Colonial Park area. More widespread home destruction occurred in Colonial Park and several more apartment complexes were demolished. The heaviest damage in the apartments occurred in the second story of two-story buildings.\n\nThe tornado then swept through the Southmoor area, destroying homes and a shopping center. After crossing Highway 281, the twister then struck the Sun Valley neighborhood and destroyed additional homes, apartments, and businesses on the south side of Highway 287. A large number of cars were smashed and some people were killed along Highway 287. Some of these people had stopped their cars under an overpass on the highway, seeking shelter from the storm.\n\nThe tornado leveled a mobile home park on the north side of Highway 287, but residents had evacuated that area and no fatalities occurred in the park. The tornado then destroyed several industrial plants before moving into Clay County just south of Highway 79.\n\nThe tornado was 1.5 miles wide as it passed through 8 miles of residential area in Wichita Falls. The intense damage averaged between one quarter and one half of a mile in width. Forty-two people were killed outright by the storm and 3 others died as a result of heart attacks.\n\nFurther statistics reveal that 25 of the deaths were auto-related. Sixteen of these 25 were people who entered their cars trying to evade the tornado. Eleven of the 16 people left homes that were not even damaged. Eight persons were killed outside, 4 were killed in homes or apartments, and 4 others died in public buildings. Seventeen hundred injuries were reported in Wichita Falls.\n\nTotal damage in Wichita Falls was estimated at $400,000,000 (in 1979 dollars). Three thousand and ninety-five homes were destroyed and 600 were damaged. One thousand and sixty-two apartment units and condominiums were demolished and 130 damaged. In addition, 93 mobile homes were devastated. It is estimated that 5,000 families, consisting of almost 20,000 people, were left homeless in Wichita Falls.\n\nThe most damaging single tornado in history (as of 1979) continued into Clay County, resulting in no deaths, but 40 additional injuries. About $15,000,000 of damage occurred as the tornado destroyed homes immediately south of Highway 79, from Wichita Falls into the Dean and Petrolia areas.\n\nThe tornado exited Texas about 4 miles east of Byers, and crossed the Red River into Oklahoma at 6:30 pm. Over 200 trees on both sides of the river were uprooted. After crossing the river, the tornado made a gradual turn to the east-northeast and passed just to the southwest of Waurika. It then dissipated to the north-northeast of Waurika at 7:00 pm.\n\nHeavy rain and large hail up to 3 inches in diameter were reported with the storm. The path of the tornado in Oklahoma covered 11 miles. The hardest hit area in Oklahoma was to the southwest of Waurika along Noble Wray Road. Civil Defense officials reported that approximately 20 homes were destroyed or damaged in that area. A new brick home was completely demolished. A pickup truck was lifted off the ground and smashed into a nearby car. Several mobile homes were destroyed. One frame was twisted badly and carried one quarter of a mile to the southwest of its original location.\n\nThe path length of the tornado was 36 miles in Texas, and 11 miles in Oklahoma. Minor wind damage and hail to 2 inches in diameter occurred north of the tornado track in Wichita Falls, in conjunction with the supercell thunderstorm. Also, tornado survivors said that some golf ball size hail fell prior to and immediately after the tornado.\n\nThere is no doubt that hundreds of lives were saved by the news media and siren warnings. Amateur radio storm spotters turned in the first report of the storm, which allowed 5 to 10 minutes of valuable warning time. This followed an earlier warning at 5:08 pm, due to the Rocky Point tornado. Undoubtedly, this earlier warning and the afternoon Vernon tornado had primed the Wichita Falls populace to the threat of additional tornado activity."
