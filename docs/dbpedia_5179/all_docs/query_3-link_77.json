        "text": "Sapulpa first appeared in Catholic records in 1893. The national Catholic Directory also mentions that Father William H. Ketcham, pastor of Muskogee, was making occasional visits to Sapulpa when George Perryman, principal chief of the Creek Nation gave a letter to \"Reverend Father W.H. Ketcham, Roman Catholic\n\nMissionary to the Creeks and Cherokees, dated April 26, 1894, and says simply, \"You are hereby permitted to erect a church building at Sapulpa, Creek Nation, I.T., for the purpose of your religious necessities. \"The Muskogee pastor continued to attend to Sapulpa until 1899 when Holy Family parish was established in Tulsa, and\n\nHoly Family served Sapulpa.\n\nIn 1907 a white frame church building was erected on the corner of Elm and Lincoln. At this time Sapulpa's Sacred Heart Mission was made a parish and a rectory was built later that same year. During this time Fr. Van Eyck was pastor. In 1922, the old church was replaced with a Jacobean Gothic brick structure and the rectory was constructed later in the same year. In 1929 Fr. James Rooney arrived in Sapulpa and was pastor to over 400 families until 1941 when Fr. John Lynch was assigned to Sapulpa. Fr. John Lynch remained in Sapulpa until 1943 when he joined the Armed Services and Fr. Francis Neville came to Sapulpa and in 1947 established a parish school and convent.\n\nThe following dates are cornerstones in the development and progress of Sacred Heart Church and it's parish following Fr. John Lynch's departure to join the armed forces.\n\n1943 – 1964 Fr. Francis X. Neville\n\n1964 – 1965 Fr. Joseph Kolb\n\n1965 – 1972 Fr. Patrick Murtagh\n\n1971 Sacred Heart Catholic School closes\n\n1972 – 1972 Fr. James Greiner\n\n1973 – 1981 Fr. Thomas K. Melton\n\n1982 Sacred Heart's 75th Anniversary\n\n1981 – 1984 Fr. Neal Brogan\n\n1982 Deacon Noel Hollingshead ordained\n\n1984 – 1996 Fr. Daniel C. Keohane\n\n1987 Deacon Francis Decker ordained\n\n1988 Deacon Noel Hollingshead moves to Sand Springs\n\n1989 Deacon Robert Washko ordained\n\nDeacon Robert Schmidt ordained\n\n1989 The new Church dedicated\n\n1991 The Rectory dedication September 22nd\n\n1995 Deacon Bob Schmidt passes away Deacon Robert Washko moves to Gutherie\n\n1996 – 2000 Fr. Jake Males retires\n\n2000 - 2002 Fr. Charles Hewawasam\n\n2001 Deacon Mark Pittman ordained, Our Lady of Lourdes dedicated, Construction of the Stations of the Cross Gardens began\n\n2002 Dedication of the Station of the Cross Gardens\n\n2002 - 2007 Fr. Stuart Crevcour\n\n2007-2014 Fr. Jovita Okonkwo\n\n2014- present Fr. Louis Obirieze\n\n2017 Deacon Vince Greuel ordained - 2021 Reassigned to St. Bernard Parish\n\n2021 Deacon Greg Stice\n\nSacred Heart parish has grown during the past 95 years. From the little \"church building\" that Missionary Fr. W. H. Ketcham was permitted to build, to Fr. Francis Neville establishing a parish school, and the move to Fr. Daniel C. Keohane's \"glorious\" new home on 1777 E. Grayson. Today the parish enjoys Fr. Charles Hewawasam's vision of the serenity of Sacred Heart's beautiful grounds, with Our Lady of Lourdes garden and the Stations of the Cross meditation gardens.\n\nSacred Heart Catholic Church was established the same year Oklahoma became a state. It maintained a vital part of Christianity to Sapulpa and the state of Oklahoma. We thank God for the many priests and religious that have given their guidance, prayers and spiritual leadership to our parish. In 2007 we celebrated our 100th anniversary."
