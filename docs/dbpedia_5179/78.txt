This is a beautiful brick church, constructed in 1921. The main entrance faces west and has 17 steps up to the entrance. Stepped brick sidewalls flank the staircase. The building has a steep gabled roof with composition shingles. Five large multi-pane arched windows run along the north and south walls of the sanctuary. The brick is accentuated with stone decorative embellishments. The entrance has double metal doors, with a stone surround. Above the entrance, a very large multi-paned arched window rises to a stone sculpture of Christ, and a cross tops the peak.

A brick bell tower rises above the roof on the northwest corner of the building. At the top of the tower a tall slender cone-shaped spire soars to the sky, topped with a cross. At the rear of the church on the east side, the upper level has a brick 8-sided room which projects from the main wall. A two-story brick manse stands south of the church building.

Land for this church was purchased in 1909 from the Mount St. Mary's property to the west. A multi-purpose building stood here from 1911-1919, when work began on this current building. Midnight Mass was first celebrated in this building in 1921, and the building was dedicated on January 2, 1922.
