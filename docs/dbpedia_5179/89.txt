Placed on the National Register September 15, 1983

The Sacred Heart Mission is described as "the birthplace of the Catholic church in Oklahoma" in an article published in the NEWS-STAR on Sept. 24, 2004. "Today an active parish sits up the hill from relics of an elaborate monastery and school begun in 1877."

In 1876, the Potawatomie Nation gave 640 acres of fertile land, including bountiful springs for water, to the Benedictine Order so that a school and church could be established for Indian children. The Rev. Isidore Robot, a French Benedictine priest, came to the area and was later designated Prefect Apostolic of Indian Territory.

Structures built on the grounds included St. Mary's Academy (a school for girls headed by the Sisters of Mercy); a bakery, pictured below; a boys' dorm; the abbey and monastery; a granary; carriage house; log cabins; along with elaborate gardens.

A fire broke out in the dining room of the boys' school the night of January 15, 1901 resulting in the loss of of the monastery, boys' school, college, girls' school, convent and the church. A few of the structures were rebuilt, including the Sacred Heart Church picture below which was finished in 1914. It is an active parish at this time.

After the fire the Benedictine community made the decision to build closer to a more populated area and they built in Shawnee. The first building they erected was begun by 1913 and is the present day administration building on the campus of St. Gregory's University.
