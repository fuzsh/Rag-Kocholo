        "text": "Peer-reviewed scientific publications are a source of high-quality and reliable information, especially valuable in today’s world. In this guide to reviewers, I have tried to suggest how to scientifically read a paper and review it. It will be helpful for those who are starting to participate in peer review and I have summarised various questions related to the process. What are the points that should be considered when analysing the title, abstract, introduction, results, discussion and conclusion?\n\nMajor improvements in the teaching and learning of geometry will only come, argues a recent report from the Royal Society and Joint Mathematical Council, through the development of a completely new pedagogy for geometry. This report examines existing models of pedagogy for geometry and considers what research might have to contribute to the development of new approaches. New pedagogic approaches for geometry need to give greater emphasis to work in 3-D, incorporate the effective use of computer technology, especially dynamic geometry, and focus on discursive methods of engagement and methods of assessment so that the pressure on pupils is not solely to rote learn."
