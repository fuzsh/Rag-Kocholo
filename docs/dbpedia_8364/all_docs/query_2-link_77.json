        "text": "The three-time Oscar-winning actress has been married to the American sculptor since 1978.\n\nA spokesperson for Streep told the PA news agency on Saturday: “Don Gummer and Meryl Streep have been separated for more than six years, and while they will always care for each other, they have chosen lives apart.”\n\nStreep shares four children with Gummer, who have followed her into acting.\n\nThey include three daughters, The Good Wife star Mamie Gummer, Mr Robot actress Grace Gummer and The Gilded Age star Louisa Gummer and one son, the musician and actor Henry Wolfe Gummer.\n\nStreep has most recently had roles in comedy murder mystery series, Only Murders In The Building, drama Let Them All Talk and Netflix satire Don’t Look Up.\n\nThe Mamma Mia! and The Devil Wears Prada star has been nominated for a total of 21 Academy Awards.\n\nHer winning Oscar roles include the legal drama Kramer Vs Kramer in 1979 as Joanna Kramer, as the titular character in psychological film Sophie’s Choice in 1982 and as Margaret Thatcher in The Iron Lady in 2011.\n\nWhen accepting her Oscar for The Iron Lady, she mentioned Gummer saying: “First I’m going to thank Don because when you thank your husband at the end of the speech they play him out with the music and I want him to know that everything I value most in our lives, you’ve given me.”"
