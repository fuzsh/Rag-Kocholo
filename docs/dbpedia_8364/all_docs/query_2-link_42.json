        "text": "LOADINGERROR LOADING\n\nMeryl Streep has revealed that she and her husband of 45 years, sculptor Don Gummer, have actually been separated for some time.\n\n“Don Gummer and Meryl Streep have been separated for more than 6 years, and while they will always care for each other, they have chosen lives apart,” a representative for the acclaimed actor said in a statement sent to Page Six and to People this week.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHuffPost has reached out for additional comment.\n\nStreep and Gummer, whose 45th wedding anniversary was last month, were introduced by Streep’s brother in 1978 and got married six months later. In an interview published in 2009, the “Devil Wears Prada” star said a key to the success of the couple’s decadeslong marriage was giving each other space.\n\n“I go to the theatre a lot,” she told The Independent. “My husband doesn’t care if he never goes to the theatre but I don’t berate him because he doesn’t want to go to the theatre ... we’re different.”\n\nThough the two had not announced their split publicly, Page Six noted that the last time they were spotted together was at the Academy Awards in 2018, when Streep was nominated for Best Actress for her role as newspaper publisher Katharine Graham in “The Post.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStreep and Gummer share four adult children; singer-songwriter Henry Wolfe and actors Mamie Gummer, Grace Gummer and Louisa Jacobson.\n\nNews of the separation comes on the heels of Jada Pinkett Smith’s revelation that she and fellow actor Will Smith have been separated since 2016. Pinkett Smith said that they had become “exhausted with trying” to make their romantic relationship work."
