        "text": "All is not well between Meryl Streep and her husband, Don Gummer. They have been secretly separated for six years, reports Page Six. The publication's sources confirmed that the duo have called it quits 45 years after tying the knot.\n\nA spokesperson of Meryl Streep confirmed the news to Page Six and said, “Don Gummer and Meryl Streep have been separated for more than 6 years, and while they will always care for each other, they have chosen lives apart.”\n\nThe ex-couple were last seen together in 2018 when they attended the Academy Awards. Meryl was nominated in the Best Actress category for Steven Spielberg's The Post.\n\nIt was earlier rumoured that Meryl was dating John Cazale, who had starred in films like 'The Godfather' and 'The Deer Hunter'. Unfortunately, John died of lung cancer in 1978. Soon after, Meryl, who was in mourning, met Don Gummer. They got married just six months later. They share four kids - a son Henry Wolfe, and three daughters, Mamie Gummer, Grace Gummer, and Louisa Jacobson.\n\nAt the Academy Awards in 2012, when Meryl had won Best Actress for 'The Iron Lady', she said in her acceptance speech, \"First, I'm going to thank Don because when you thank your husband at the end of the speech they play him out with the music, and I want him to know that everything I value most in our lives, you've given me.\"\n\nOn the work front, Meryl Streep was last seen in Season three of 'Only Murders In The Building'."
