        "text": "If I wasn't acting\n\nWhat if Meryl didn't sleep through her alarm? What if Meryl never pursued acting as a career? What if Meryl wasn't acting? This is NOT real. Everyone knows Meryl Streep and what her life as an actress is...but what if. (I'm going ti attach random songs to each chapter so it may be very old or new. Depends on the mood)...\n\nCompleted Mature\n\nA spark that turned into a fire of love.\n\nIt's going to be my first FF on Meryl and Don's life and this part is going to be Don's point of view of when he saw Meryl for the first time.\n\nForever (Strummer)\n\nJust a fanfiction of what it would've been if Meryl and Don had gotten divorced but fell inlove again anyway. taking this more to mordern and into today. Christmas is coming soon. Will Meryl spend it alone or will the whole family reunite?\n\nCompleted\n\nTo Everything, There Is A Season\n\nJourney with Don, Meryl and Henry Gummer after they heal from the trauma of Kevin Mann and the loss of William Walker as Don and Meryl learn that...To Everything, There Is A Season.\n\nCompleted Mature\n\nLove Is Full Of Surprises\n\nThis story follows That Little Screening Room. It will include the beginning of Don and Meryl's marriage including Henry, Dustin Hoffman slapping her and the ups and downs that come with being a newlywed. Enjoy!\n\nCompleted Mature\n\nHand in Hand\n\nThis story continues All My Life. Journey with Don and Meryl Gummer as they raise their infant twins, Brady and Mags, and continue to be stalwarts for their family including Henry and Mamie and Gracie and Louisa and each other.\n\nCompleted\n\nSome Kind of Wonderful\n\nThis is the second series I'm going to try to write. (Although I don't promise to update regularly at all, like not at all). Just like Serendipity deals with snippets from the later years/present time, this one is going to be flashbacks from the 80s/90s. You know young love, babies and other Strummer-y things. Hope y...\n\nHow Everything Started\n\nThis is my first Strummer Fanfiction. It's based on real events but of course, some parts are totally fictive. English is not my mother tongue, so if there are mistakes please, forgive me. Thank you all. PS: feel free to comment anything you want for me to change something or to give me some ideas.\n\nWhat Comes Next?\n\nIts a beautiful summer in 1980 and Mary has one too many things on her mind but one of them is a boy named Don.\n\nWe Are The Gummers (part one)\n\nthe Gummer's maybe famous but doesn't mean they can't have a not so perfect life. Meryl is the same as any other women she is just well known but can she keep her family from falling to ruins when something Jurassic goes on in the Gummer's household but can she do it and keep herself in binds or will it all fall down...\n\nMature\n\nLove Is There\n\nThe lives of Meryl and Don Gummer. To me, they are the definition of what the word 'Love' truly is. I truly respect their personal relationship and I am in no need of trying to be disrespectful in any way. This will be a glimpse of early years of marriage, present marriage, flashbacks, love, children, award events...\n\nStranded\n\nThe Huston's and The Gummers's are gonna take a trip to the Bahamas , but on the way there the plane crashed will they survive or will they die? Book #1. This book is currently under maintenance. May 2016\n\nCompleted Mature\n\nFrom Italy with Love\n\nDon had been very patient. He'd been nothing but patient towards his wife of more than three decades. But lately, his patience was running thin. Meryl had been snapping at him at every opportunity the woman had. He didn't understand if it was a menopausal thing, the lack or maybe excess of a hormone, or what.\n\nThat Little Screening Room\n\nI have decided to post some of my older stories. I wrote this one about 7 years ago and it follows Don and Meryl from the beginning. Thank you to those who originally helped me with this story so long ago! Hope you enjoy!\n\nCompleted Mature\n\nTheir Next Chapter\n\nThis story follows Love is the Best Medicine. I wrote this about 4 years ago. I only have a few chapters of it done. Don't know if I'll continue or not. But I hope you enjoy the love and drama I have so far.\n\nCompleted Mature\n\nSerendipity\n\nFleeting glances into the lives of one Don Gummer and Meryl Streep. Disclaimer: I do not own any of these awesome people! I have only borrowed them to whet my own appetite and muse. I, in no way intend to mean any harm from this work of fiction. I do respect their need for privacy, that said, they make me believe that...\n\nMature\n\nLove is the Best Medicine\n\nThis is a story of Don's health struggles and the ups and downs before and after the filming on The Iron Lady. All my stories are purely fictional. I originally wrote this story 5 years ago but have reworked it. Thanks to those over on LJ who originally were my soundboards and gave me ideas all those years ago! Hope y...\n\nCompleted Mature\n\nLove Conquers All\n\nI wrote this story about 6 years ago. It falls in between Love is Full of Surprises and An Unforeseen Journey. Thank you to all who helped me with this story the first time around! For all those who like drama it is filled with it! Hope you enjoy!\n\nCompleted Mature"
