        "text": "Meryl Streep and her husband Don Gummer have actually been separated for over half a decade, it has been confirmed.\n\nIn a statement issued to Page Six, a spokesperson for the Postcards from the Edge and the Don't Look Up actress said: \"Don Gummer and Meryl Streep have been separated for more than 6 years, and while they will always care for each other, they have chosen lives apart.\"\n\nIt is reported that the pair were last seen together at the 2018 Oscars ceremony.\n\nRelated: Only Murders in the Building director reveals Meryl Streep's surprising link to character\n\nStreep and Gummer have four children together: singer-songwriter Henry Wolfe, and actresses Marie and Grace, and Louisa Jacobson (known for her role in HBO's The Gilded Age).\n\nThey recently became grandparents for the fifth time, as Grace welcomed her first child with her husband, Mark Ronson.\n\nThe couple were first introduced in 1978, and wed that same year, keeping their relationship mostly out of the spotlights.\n\nRelated: Meryl Streep almost appeared on Will & Grace\n\nRecently, Streep appeared in season 3 of Only Murders in the Building, as struggling actress and love interest Loretta.\n\nAs it turns out, Streep didn't know where her character fit into the murder mystery plot for most of the production.\n\n\"Throughout the season, we keep the scripts pretty tight, even with our main cast,\" the show's boss John Hoffman said. \"I loved watching Meryl be attuned to that and come to that in some way throughout season 3.\n\n\"She kept on wondering, 'Am I going to die? Am I going to be the murderer?' She had to know what was coming up next, it was funny.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Streep said that she would love to return for a third Mamma Mia! film, even though they'd need to bend the rules of nature and logic to bring her character back, considering the second film confirmed that Donna had died.\n\nYou Might Also Like"
