She taught a short while in primary work at Ringold, then in Rome taught art and music in the public\n\nMcCue. was assistant superintendent of the Missouri school, and it was through him that she first became interested.

For thirty years she coached the girls' basketball teams, and during this period many outstanding teams were produced bringing much credit to the school.\n\nSeveral of her former pupils have found her courses in mechanical drawing very valuable to them, now being employed in engineering departments of large corporations. From time to time she has received many letters from them in appreciation of this training.\n\nThe various activities throughout the year given by the students and faculty are made better by her enthusiastic cooperation.\n\nMRS. W. S. GIBBONS In 1904 Miss Nell Adams came to Georgia and Cave Spring' to follow her chosen profession of teaching the deaf. With the exception of the years\n\nSince that time her work has been continuous. It has been thirty-four years since she first came to the Cracker State to teach the deaf. She is now beginning her thirtieth year as a teacher here. She is one of only three of the present teachers who have served under three superintendents, the late W. O. Connor; J. C. Harris, now superintendent emeritus: and the present head of the institution, Mr. Hollingsworth. Hundreds of former students remember her affection.\n\nThe HELPER is especially proud to note that for twenty years she served as its associate editor and is delighted to receive her back on the staff after a brief absence. For ten years she served as local reporter for the Atlanta Journal and for sometime she has been a reporter for the Rome-Tribune keeping the public informed of the happenings of Cave Spring and surrounding territory. She is a member of the board of stewards of the Cave Spring Methodist Church, and an officer of its missionary society.

That these efforts have borne fruit is evidenced by the fact that the buildings of the present plant are being modernized, fireproofed and otherwise made tenantable, safe and convenient for our use. The construction of a unit of the new building program is expected to get under way some time during the year.\n\nAnyone aC<l,.uainted With the meager facilities and the dilapidated and menacing conditions of our present plant can not deny the importance of this building emphasis. This year our enrollment has increased over the 269 enrolled last year, and the waiting list of other eligible pupils is constantly growing larger. But, even\n\nWeare addressing you, fellowworkers, when we say we are profoundly pleased with the opportuni-\n\nties lying before us. We are more than pleased with the spirit in which each of you are applying yourself to your assigned task. It is in this latter that we see our greatest hope. You will find, in the enlarged and enriched course of study offered, opportunities to revitalize and rationalize the deaf boy's and girl's thirst for knowledge. You will use the wider choice of vocational and avocational pursuits offered in the adaptation of learning that 'combines nterest with utility. Acknowledge yourselve to be the most significant and humanistic force in the proper integration of the child's personality into the program.\n\nLet's seek to build healthy minds and bodies through the instrumentality of co-curricular activities that are threaded throughout the pupils\n\nweekly program. We feel that the diversity, the richness and the interrelatedness of our \"out of the classroom\" activities have outmoded the term Extra-Curricular to the substitution of Co-Curricular.\n\nqualifying in this respect not only because of their athletic prowness, but because of gentlemanly qualities and fine abilities as campus activity leaders. Their force will be positive rather than negative. They will contrive to be leaders and influence for good in those all impor-\n\ntant leisure hours that must always be an important phase of the pupil's development.\n\nIn the present endeavor to give major consideration to the task immediately before us it is pertinent to say that the procedure endeavors to tie up into a composite whole, ideas and practice of years ago together with the very latest theories and practice in education. We can no more abolish some of the theories of yesterday than we could the \"Golden Rule.\" Neither can we ignore modern pedagogical practices. To say that the two teachers whom we honor in this issue (see page 2) are working shoulder to shoulder with the young teachers trained in the present era, and all with the single thought and purpose that we forge our school forward to .a superior service for Georgia's deaf children, tells the whole story.\n\nin the face of this building need The stereotyped study hall held\n\ncatastl'ophe that has faced us-and is still facing us-there looms before\n\nus in this the beginning of another school year, the challenging call to serve well the children now enrolled. What greater challenge can engage our attention just now as these\n\nhandicapped children crowd about us seeking that which we are com-\n\nmissioned to give? Despite the fact that Georgia has\n\nneglected her deaf children as regards sufficient and safe h?us~g facilities to the point of publIc dlsgrace, we as teachers and workers must vigilantly guard against lethargy and neglect in the promotion of eternal values not necessarily represented in stone and masonry Rome was not built in a day, neither did Abraham Lincoln neglect his\n\neach evening has been abolished.

Long may the new order live! In the place of the wasted evening hour, the Principal has wisely substituted \"hobby hours\", \"club meetings\", \"society meetings\", picture shows, as visual education projects, \"story\n\nhours\", etc. Yes, the boys and girls like this and will profit greatly by the change while you, as teachers are discovering working conditions and methods compatible with your\n\nIt is with sincere regret that the Georgia School was forced to relinquish Mr. and Mrs. John A.

Federal laws relating to vocational\n\nthe vocational department feels that a better 1;~aohing program could be\n\nof the vocational division of the state department of education. This is an increase of four over last year. In this way a greatly expanded program of training had been started.\n\nIn 1917 Congress passed the Smith-Hughes Act providing federal funds for this type of education in the secondary schools of the United States. Under its terms instruction is given to those fourteen years of age or over and must be of less than college grade. All courses include supervised practice to acquaint the pupil with the problems of the occupation and enable him to develop the necessary skills. This feature has probably done more to set tbis method of training apart and has contributed more to its success than any other feature.\n\neducation place no upper age limit. Problems arise throughout life. One of the chief demands for this training is for the adult groups. An attempt is being made to make out some kind of program for the adult\n\ndeaf of Georgia. Elsewhere in this issue will be found a discussion of surveys being made to locate the deaf n the state and find out something about them.\n\nThis survey of the adult deaf will assist the teacher in organizing a program of instruction for those in school. Special difficulties met with by the deaf can be studied. A vocational teacher realizes that his course is not completed until the pupil is earning a satisfactory living\n\nwith a fair expectation of permanancy.\n\nset up if more were known of the special problems met with by the deaf in the various occupations.\n\nSometimes ago a survey was started to locate the deaf farmers. This is far from complete. It is probable that a plan can be worked out for some work with the adult deaf farmers when this survey is completed. In general education it is felt more and more that the school is not fulfilling its mission when it devotes its entire time to boys and girls enrolled in its regular classes. Because a person has passed what is usually considered as school age is no reason that all of his problems are solved. In fact the problems of life have just started. If the school performs its full duty it will give him assistance at this time.\n\nDuring recent years this program bas been greatly expanded by the\n\nIndustrial Sewing\n\nAs stated elsewhere the vocational department, is now operating largely\n\nGeorge-Deen Act providing additional federal grants.

Mr. Bankston is employed by the Ford Motor Company.\n\nHorace Taylor, his brother, and father went fishing on Labor Day. Horace was all set with rod and reel and other fancy equipment to outshine his brother and dad who had only the common variety of fish pole and worms. However, as the day wore on, Horace was forced to watch his dad and brotther pull in catfish after catfish while he had no luck at all. Finally, as the sun dropped low, Horace cast aside his store bought rod and used the plain fish pole and managed to save his face by catching one fish. Horace says the fish were too dumb to recognize high class fish bait when they saw it.\n\nAtlantians recently enjoyed a program of moving pictures sponsored by the Atlanta Division, r o. 28, N. F. S.

Archer of the Rome Rotary Club; Wallace Grant president of the Rome Chamber of\n\nommerce; R. P. Kennard of the American Legion; O. H. Word, Josh Tumlin, Mrs. S. J. Wester and J.

The old theory of education was to let the child shift for himself after school hours. A newer plan is to have planned activities for all the children and those activities based upon the psychological as well as the physical level of the children. The child is no longer permitted to play in the streets. Playgrounds with equipment suited to every type of child are being built throughout the United States. Men and women trained to take charge of those playgrounds are being placed in charge.\n\nIn ma~y of our schools for the deaf, outside supervision is the weakest link in our system. The ability to \"ride herd\" on those in charge has seemed to be one of the chief qualities desired in a supervisor. Others are placed in the position as supervisors perhaps because of \"pull\"; others because of a slight hearing loss which has barred them from the business world; others because they just happened along at the opportune time when the school needed an extra supervisor.\n\nFortunately the profession as a whole is ,'aking up to the need of men and women trained in physical education and child development. There are very few schools which would not hire at least one person trained to take over supervising duties if they were qualified to place outside activities on a higher plane. Boys and girls have at least one field which is not over-crowded. Graduates from Gallaudet would be at a premium; those that have been trained are at a premium at the present time.\n\nThe added stress that we are placing on our co-curricular activities demands a personnel trained to carryon not only physical education, (or coaching as phystical education has been called) but a multiude of other act'vities such as literary society work; group organization and management; handicraft \\\\lork; puppetry; Boy. Scout work, Girl Scout work and a great many other hobbies. At the present time, almost all of our co-curricular activities are carried on by the teacher after regular work hours when she should be devoting her time to classroom preparation.\n\nOne of the chief causes for lack of trained\n\npersonnel in this department is due to the low\n\nsalaries' which we have been accustomed to\n\npaying. The 'trained s,upervisor should re-\n\nceive as much money as the trained teacher.\n\nThe:.e should be no difference in the amount\n\nof training whether it is in school work or\n\nsllpervision.\n\nWe have training centers for. teachers\n\nthroughout the United States. The supervisor\n\ncomes in contact with the children for a longer\n\nperiod than the' teacher, so why, shouldn't we\n\nhave traming center forsup.ervisors? .If. it\n\n,>;ould be impractical te have sevet:al training\n\ncenters for supervisors, why not have. one\n\ncenterally located center in which a four year\n\ncollege level course in supervision would be\n\ngiven? Going one step farther, why not have\n\nevery supervisor certified just as the teachers\n\nare' certified by the CONFERENCE OF\n\nEXECUTIVES OF AMERICAN SCHOOLS\n\nFOR THE DEAF?\"\n\nBriefly speaking, the 'following suggestions\n\n~re offered:\n\n(1) Place outside supervision on a much high-\n\ner plane; equal to that of the classroom\n\nand vocational departments.\n\n(2) Establish centers for training. supervisors.\n\nThe courses to be offere{l to be similiar to\n\nthose found in any of the large colleges\n\nor universities.\n\n.- ,\n\n(3) Place supervisors on the same' monetary\n\nscale as teachers. .\n\n(4) Certify all supervisors just as the teachere\n\nare certified.\n\nWHAT DO YOU THINK?\n\nThe editor has at last found 'perfe\"ct huriting companions. The e'ditor and Mr. Caple, vocat;onal principal, had the pleasure of being the\n\nguests of Mr. and Mrs. W. M. Powell, of AIphreda, over the Thanksgjving holiqays. Messrs. Gleen and Atwood Powell proc~.eded to show the editor and Mr. Caple the art of bird hunting. hen the editor could find an dPPOl'tunity to shoot at the same bird as the aforementioned men, there was always .the same c. urteous reply, \"1. am certain you killed the bird.

We say, \"Come again, but stay longer next time.\"\n\nPage Four\n\nTHE SCHOOL HELPER\n\nJUDY SAYS\n\n_\n\nDecember, 1938\n\n\"The Sunny South\" evidently refers to thf! sunny smile the people of the South possess rather than to the climatic conditions.\n\nTHE moral, social and physical sides of life in school are just as important as the academic and vocational sides. The opportune time to begin teaching these aspects of life is at birth.\n\nI think that every deaf boy and girl should have the opportunity to come in contact with and become acquainted with as many normal children as possible. It is the responsibility of the teacher to see that such contacts are made.\n\nThe Georgia School for the Deaf has a basketball team that is about ready to take on any of the better teams in the country. Coaches Tollefson and Drake must given the boys \"a shot in the arm.\"\n\nIn a recent article by Roy J. Stewart in the American Deaf Citizen entitled, \"Them Was Real Football Days at Gallaudet,\" he spoke of an argument between John Wurdemenn and Louis Pucci as to which was the greater team, the 1924 team or the 1930 team. There can be no doubt as to which was the greater team. Review the schedule and then compare the two teams. I believe the opening game with St. Johns was a scoreless tie or almost a tie; the score between Maryland and Gallaudet was 14-7 (the referee stole the game ask Monaghan) ; 'the score with rfemple (the home of Pop Warner) 28-7 (another bad official) and I think the game with Washington College ended in a victory for Gallaudet with a score of 57-0 or something like that, (Gallaudet had a good referee that Saturday.) Oh yes, almost forgot the game with Susquehanna University which Gallaudet won 14 to 7. Monaghan will remember that game very well. After the season the team voted that it was the greatest team that Gallaudet ever had or ever would have, and who could dispute an unanimous vote? No, there ain't ever been a good football player since the time of Ringle, Marshall, Johnson, Zieske, Wurdemann and the greatest end of them all, Monaghan. Woe iF; me!

It is believed the leaders in our field. combined with outside educational interests, will conspire to promote these special education problems in a manner affording a more unified program and a more equalized opportunity for all the deaf children in all the states.\n\nand cooperative solution. That some centralized control to unify the general program is of paramount need can not be easily denied.\n\nCan we say there is a national program when no two Or three states can combine as a unit on a standard course of study and a uniform testing program? Or, has there ever been devised testing material intended for and wholly adaptable to our use as a means of measuring the deaf boy or girl? Can individualistic procedure be correct when there is no common measuring stick to define the progress of the individual schools and for making scientific comparative analyses?

A M, A. degree is awarded those successfully completing this course, It is interesting to note that this normal course was the first one accepted as an accredited course by the Conference of Executives of the American Schools for the Deaf.\n\nAn attractive feature of this normal course is the fact that the breadth and comprehensiveness of the training offered is particularil y beneficial to those aspiring to rise\n\nToo much credit can not be tionaL or sectional, accrediting to executive positions in their\n\ngiven the worthy effort of the agency cloaked with authorized chosen profession.\n\nnoble pioneers foundation for\n\nwho laid a real the building of a\n\npower to establish standards to guide the schools in their\n\nand per-\n\nMore than twenty-five graduates from this department are now\n\nsystem for educating the deaf of formances to these standards?\n\nheading various schools for the\n\nour land. Nor, can we fail to recognize the indelible imprint of the \"force of experience\" that must ever be a guiding factor in any progress march. BUtt, the challenge to this generation is; are we wholly keeping the faith? Are we continuing this educational structure in the light of an ever evolving social order under a democracy? Can we even boast of a national system. coherent, objective, and definitely guided on a chartered course?\n\nIt seemingly would be difficult for us to justify the continuation of the present \"crazy quilt\" pattern of our state schools. With all the perplexities involved, and there are many. the whole machinery of the education of the deaf must surely gear itself in an educational pattern thoroughly harmonizing with the demands of this age for organized standardization.\n\nMayhap, the inevitabe solution is national legislation shaped to unify. equalize, and coordinate the\n\ndeaf, A corresponding greater number are in executive positions as principals. It has been our good opportunity to play a part in elevating two graduates of this Normal training Department to executive positions in the past two years, There has also been added to our faculty at the Georgia School during the same interval three deaf people who graduated from the collegiate department of Gallaudet.

Parents coming after their children may get them after noon Wednesday, December 21.\n\nThe regular transportation facilities which must be accepted by all children, whose parents do not call for them, or who have other approved travel arrangments will be on a train arriving in Atlanta about 10 :00 A. M. Thursday, December 22. Supervisors and attendants will accompany this group and see that all are properly distributed from this point.\n\nThe return trip to school will be made January 2. Attendants will again meet all the children in Atlanta. They must have a ticket through to Rome and 25 cents for bus fare on to Cave Spring. Please do not not let your child miss this return schedule.\n\nMany of you are looking forward to a happy reunion with your boy or girl during the Christmas Holidays. Other parents because of shortness of the vacation period, distance to travel etc., will leave their children here at the school for the holidays. In either event, let us make the most of the opportunity and responsibility that is ours.\n\nYou who are sending for your children to .come home by train or bus see that they have the proper fare ~nd. all directions furnished you are explicitly followed. Have them properly clothed for the journey and during the time that they are home exercise all necessary precautions in that colds, over-eating and exposure to contagiouS' diseases are carefully guarded against. Remember that any exposure that your child is subjected to not only endangers your child but all the group who return to school. If you could witness the little epidemic of sickness which usually follows the Christmas vacation period, you would know what I am talking about. Often it is nothing more than bad colds, but even that is something to vigilantly guard against. There is much damage incurred even with an epidemic of common colds.\n\nTo you who will leave your boys and girls at school,.I wish to assure you the best of care for your children; Christmas parties, Santa Claus, presents, and as happy and homelike an atmosphere as loving and attentive teachers and supervisors can provide.\n\nHere's wishing all you parents and your\n\nchildren a very happy and healthful Christ--\n\nmas Season.\n\nVery sincerely,\n\nC.

The Journal has shown a fine spirit of cooperation which we are very thankful.-R. G. P.\n\nThe word \"institution\" has caused more hardship as far as the teaching of the deaf is concerned than almost any other word. It is a far more objectionable word than <I dumb\" . The word \"institution\" is associated by the legislator, who provides the funds for our schools, along with the institutions for the feebleminded, insane and crimminals, \"SO the impluse is to provide equal opportunity with the inmates of the above mentioned institutions. Why not refrain from using the word \"institution\" and call our schools by the correct name?-R. G. P. '\n\nThe New Year brings new hope, new joy and new sorrow. Without new hope and renewed faith in our work, life becomes meaningless and drab. It is well that the year has no more than three hundred sixty-five days. We may take on new courage to carry out the plans we have previously made. We may now erase the slate clean of mistakes and vow not to repeat the same mistakes again.-R. G.
