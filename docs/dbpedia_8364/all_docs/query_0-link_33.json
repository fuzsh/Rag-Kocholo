        "text": "Phew! What a fabulous day I had today visiting The Business Culture HEY Expo. It was great to chat to organiser Tony Bowler. What an inspirational chap you are, Tony! Jane Gough and I had a superb conversation. She is the Director of Dalton Spire that produce Beverley Mag & Hull Mag, amongst other things. I got a hole in one on the Humber HR People’s golf putting game and met Sarah Carvill who was a delight to talk to. I met fellow We Are Wakefielder Andrew Brodie at Hygieia Group Ltd who is doing great work in the field of innovative cleaning equipment. Phil Ward’s business coaching is someone who I can imagine would be hugely influential in growing my business and it was great to meet Elizabeth Roxby from Double Tree by Hilton Hotels. She is a driving force in the events team and a huge talent. My wife, Rachel, is a firefighter so we understand how important fire safety is. Paul Oliver has set up Helix FMS to ensure that fire protection is covered for businesses and government buildings. It’s always great to see the JAMES LEGAL LIMITED team. Today I met the fantastic Anna Bisby & Danielle Turpin. Shame that Nicky Mounsor and Yasmin P. weren’t there today. Hull Adventure carting let me have a go in their duel cart. Great for a team building day! After my virtual coffee chat with Joanna Masters the other day, I’ve now met two other Utility Warehouse partners in James Harris and Paul Schofield. Great guys and very interesting business in UW. Erica Baron has a very interesting company in sales, tendering & business consultancy as does Luke Dunham from Sports Ability who trains PTs and runs various classes including school swimming sessions. He’s got great growth plans for this business. Inspire Images and Samantha Wheeldon is a great photographer I’ve worked with before. She’s also a fabulous cook and is developing high protein training foods with GoFoodie and Christine Bettinson (who I didn’t manage to chat with today). This company might end up being huge! I was hoping to meet Lynn Yates from Athena MIS and Nathan Pidd Pidd from VIP CREATIVE but I ran out of time. Looking forward to the next event with The Business Culture HEY! #thebusinessculture #invaluableadvice #navigationwealthmanagement"
