Which is a red link right now but should be blue soon enough. Einar aka Carptrash (talk)\n\nOkay, I see it on the talk page. Why not on the article page with all the other cats? Carptrash (talk)\n\nThat's because it's a project category, like the \"bla-project articles by importance/class\". The article public art cats applicable here are \"Outdoor sculptures in ...\" & \"Monuments & memorials in ...\". Johnbod (talk)\n\na good example of why I don't indulge much in this stuff. In any case. thanks for the cleaning my recent attempt up, Carptrash (talk)\n\nI added the tag because it makes sense. Carptrash, have you seen the WikiProject Public Art Template? It seems it might make your work more efficient.--RichardMcCoy (talk)\n\nThanks Richard. Making sense, and efficiency, for that matter, are not things that come naturally or easily to me. However I was labeled \"educable\" years ago, thus proving that I can learn. Carptrash (talk)\n\nRichard has asked me to give some thoughts on the categorization of Public art articles (Note: When discussing categories on talk pages, and using the brackets [[ ]], you need to put a colon before the C of \":Category\" (like that), or the cat name won't appear in the text you're writing, but the talk page will show in the category itself).\n\nThe Category:Public art tree at the moment has most of the content in Category:Outdoor sculptures and Category:Fountains. It does not include Category:Monuments and memorials, presumably on the grounds that these are in many forms of which some are not art, and are intangible - Category:Chess memorial tournaments, lectures, scholarships etc.\n\n1) New categories in the \"Public art tree\"\n\nNew categories that might be established include Category:Public art by country, leading down to Category:Public art in the United States etc.; Category:Public art organizations; some form of artists' category, but I think Category:Public artists doesn't sound right, or fit normal usage. I think the first two are unproblematic. The artists are a bit different, as almost all historic sculptors produced at least some public art, and if they were all included the category would be \"Mostly overlapping\" (WP:OCAT) with Category:Sculptors. But there are evidently many artists who now specialize in public art sculpture and installations almost entirely, & for whom this is \"defining\". Category:Contemporary artists making public art might be the way to go, probably with some national subcats like Category:American contemporary artists making public art.\n\nAnother possibility is to set up Category:Works of public art, but this might not be necessary or a good idea. It's another layer, up to which all the works trees would lead.\n\n2) Should \"monuments and memorials be in the tree?\n\nThere is a case for this, despite the fact that some of the categories in the head-cat are non-art, like Category:Chess memorial tournaments, Category:Tributes to John Coltrane & so on. But there are not many of these as far as one can tell. I see that Category:Monuments and memorials in the United States is categorized under Category:Sculptures in the United States, despite containing some things like List of United States submarines designated as memorials.\n\nThe interpretation of policy varies on this sort of question. Some people, especially in the past, demanded a 100% fit between a category & its parents, but I think a more flexible view is now more typical. I think adding the M&M cats to the Public art tree is justifiable. If done, this would be at top level and at any PA by country cats.\n\n3) Over-categorizing\n\nWP:CAT is the main policy on categorization, and there is also WP:OCAT. Both are clear that, as WP:CAT says near the start:\n\n\"Pages are not placed directly into every possible category, only into the most specific one in any branch. This means that if a page belongs to a subcategory of C (or a subcategory of a subcategory of C, and so on) then it is not normally placed directly into C. For exceptions to this rule, see Eponymous categories and Non-diffusing subcategories below.\"\n\nIt is a very common mistake for inexperienced editors to add far too many top level categories; if doing an artist bio for example, categories like \"art\", \"painting\", \"culture\" are added. This is clearly against policy and such top level categories need regular maintenence to \"diffuse\" articles to the correct sub-cats, otherwise the top-level cats become clogged up & less useful. In the case of public art, if an article is in \"Outdoor sculptures in Foo City\", this will automatically be a sub-category in trees leading to \"Culture of Foo City\", \"Foo City\", \"Outdoor sculptures in Foo State\" and ultimately \"Public art\". The sculpture should therefore only be placed in \"Outdoor sculptures in Foo City\", and if appropriate \"Monuments and memorials in Foo City/state\". I was doing some work removing excess categories in the public art tree last night, which many of you will have noticed on your watchlists. If you want to discuss individual changes, let me know, but the basic principles above are not controversial.\n\n4) Other categories\n\nThere are some other categories that might be added, & are typically under-used. By material we have Category:Sculptures by medium (not the best title) with subcats like Category:Bronze sculptures, also steel, concrete, stone, wood etc. Also very under-used are the group in Category:Sculptures by century - only 18 works are currently in the 19th century sub-cat! There are also Category:Installation art works, Category:Sculpture gardens, trails and parks, and probably others. Johnbod (talk)\n\nDiscussion on categories\n\nPlease let's have your thoughts and comments on the above. Johnbod (talk)\n\nThanks for organizing such comprehensive information about how categories might relate to this Wikiproject, Johnbod. I hope to review your ideas in detail very soon. Jgmikulay (talk)\n\nThis is tremendously useful! Thanks, Johnbod! Categories are a part of Wikipedia that I think are rather complicated. I've been think about the need to create specific public art categories to a city and your proposal really give me something to chew on. Like JGMikulay, it will take some time to give a thoughtful response to this, but wanted to let you know my appreciation. --RichardMcCoy (talk)\n\nI'm still not sure I follow all of the details and nuances Johnbod outlines, but here is my response.\n\nNew Categories/Public Art Tree: I agree that the categories you propose (“by country” and “organizations”) would be helpful. An option to get around the awkwardness you note with including artists could be “Public art practitioners.” This category could then include individual artists and organizations.\n\nMonuments and Memorials in the Tree: I would like to see this category as part of the tree. Especially with 19th century public art, and increasingly with contemporary works, memorials are a major emphasis in practice.\n\nOver-Categorizing: Your explanation here is really helpful. I definitely fall into the category of WPians confused by categories!\n\nOther Categories: Media, period and location all seem useful. Jgmikulay (talk)\n\nThanks. One advantage in keeping organizations and artists seperate is that the categories fit better into trees like Category:Arts organizations and Category:Artists. Also the meaning of the names is clearer - \"practitioners\" might throw some people. Johnbod (talk)\n\nAh, I see... good point. I'm learning a lot about the logic of WP categories from you! Jgmikulay (talk)\n\nOne could then combine the two in a “Public art practitioners” cat, but this seems an unnecessary extra layer. Johnbod (talk)\n\nYou are invited to join the discussion at Template talk:Street art#Large-scale events. -- Trevj (talk)\n\nArts portal\n\nPortal:Arts is now up for portal peer review, the review page is at Wikipedia:Portal peer review/Arts/archive1. I've put a bit of effort into this as part of a featured portal drive related to portals linked from the top-right corner of the Main Page, and feedback would be appreciated prior to featured portal candidacy. Thank you for your time, — Cirt (talk)\n\nI'd like to add a more detailed street location (cross streets) into the infobox for public artworks, rather than simply noting the city in which they are installed. Are there infobox guidelines that would prohibit this improvement? Jgmikulay (talk)\n\ni don't believe so. infoboxes tend to include what the creator thought was important; apparently they thought GPS was more specific than street address, and didn;t want to include museum address since they had a blue link. the infobox documentation is silent on the matter here [1] also check out template talk [2]. you could also ask someone to add a address field. Slowking4⇔ †@1₭\n\nCheck out this new addition to Wikimedia Commons - documentation about US public art copyright law. It's \"unofficial\" from folks at WMF legal. See it here: Public art and copyrights in the US -- SarahStierch (talk)\n\nHi everyone. March is Women's History Month and I'm hoping a few folks here at WP:Public art will have interest in putting on events related to women's roles in public art; as subject matter, sculptors, artists, buyers, etc. We've created an event page on English Wikipedia (please translate!) and I hope you'll find the inspiration to participate. These events can take place off wiki, like edit-a-thons, or on wiki, such as themes and translations. Please visit the page here: WikiWomen's History Month. Thanks for your consideration and I look forward to seeing events take place! SarahStierch (talk)\n\nHaymarket affair, which is listed as part of this WikiProject, has been nominated for a community reassessment to determine if it meets the good article criteria and so can be listed as a good article. Please add comments to the article reassessment page. Thank you. — Malik Shabazz Talk/Stalk\n\nsee discussion here [3] Slowking4⇔ †@1₭\n\nHi all, I recently asked this question on the Wiki Loves Monuments list, but I haven't gotten a definitive answer yet. I'm hoping you can help me? I went on a monument photo walk In Washington DC after Wikimania, and was happy with some of the photos I took of the Vietnam Veterans Memorial wall, which I planned to upload during WLM 2012. Then I started looking at the FoP rules in the U.S. and realized I don't think I can upload most of those photos to Commons, given the wall is a statue and is therefore under copyright? Couple questions:\n\nIs this accurate? Is the Wall under copyright? I know there were lawsuits around the Korean War memorial, but I can't find the clear answer for the Vietnam memorial?\n\nIf not, how does the primary photo on the EnWP article qualify to be hosted on Commons? Is the standard in this case de minimus or some other? Or is it a resolution issue? It seems there are various photos of the wall that are on Commons that similarly display the wall without copyright notices or templates, like this one.\n\nAny insight would be appreciated. Thanks! Almonroth\n\nHi, Matthew. Your question is a good one. Members of this WikiProject have been active in attempting to get clarification on such matters for some time. For artworks in copyright, we typically include one low-resolution image in articles about the artworks. In the case of the VVM, it seems that there is precedent for including images of the work in Commons. I'm not sure there is a \"definitive answer\" to your question, but hopefully a few others will share their insight here. If you learn more elsewhere, please let us know! --Jgmikulay (talk)\n\nhi, this is my understanding:\n\n\"the wall\" is assumed to be an architectural feature, so under FoP US, see Wikipedia:Public_domain#Photographs_of_buildings. however, you will note that the \"The Three Soldiers\" is a sculpture, with a picture under \"wp:Fair Use\". the panarama shot added lately could be de minimus but, we havn't had a deletion discussion to get a consensus. see commons:de minimus\n\nthe Korean Memorial case, as you can see at the article, was really about the statue group. pictures of the wall there are FoP, and sculpture \"fair use\".\n\nyes, there are many pre-existing photos with minimal tagging, wrong tagging. i've been going through as i notice them, save them from deletion, but there is no initiative to clean up the mess. when you put two tags on, one for photo one for 3D art, building, much fun ensues. we haven't had the discussion about the difference between architecture, and environmental art (spiral jetty).\n\nso yes you could upload vietnam memorial pics to commons, use FoP US tag. if you have pics of 3D artwork, the copyright status is complicated: pre-1923 = PD; pre-1978 without a copyright notice = PD (check the siris database); all others fair use on en wikipedia. Slowking4⇔ †@1₭\n\nThanks, Slowking4! I knew you would have some insight! --Jgmikulay (talk)\n\nbtw, i believe that's why for US wikiloves monuments is concentrating on NRHP buildings. from their presentation at wikimania, the streamlined upload wizard will have a PD list to choose from. public art is a 'future follow-up' bah. Slowking4⇔ †@1₭\n\nThank you for those insights. I'm happy to read that The Wall is considered an architectural feature and not a sculpture. It was very clear from my (limited) research on the matter that the \"The Three Soldiers\" is a sculpture, but nothing I saw could clarify the architectural feature question you've answered. FYI, I've sent an email and left a voice message with the Communications Director at the Vietnam Veterans Memorial Fund with the same question, and will let you know if he replies. NPS had pointed me to VVMF, saying they were the best ones to answer the question. I think at least a couple the NRHP entries (Korean War Memorial, for instance) will not be admissible for WLM, and we're looking at a way to demarcate this in the special Upload Wizard so noobs don't get too frustrated if their pics of said RHPs are not accepted. In the U.S., this should be a minor inconvenience, but I understand from organizers in Belarus, for instance, that up to 30% of their monuments are estimated to be under copyright. yech Almonroth\n\nI would love to hear if you learn anything new from your inquiries. I agree that it's important to get this somewhat clarified before the deluge of new images from upcoming Wiki Loves... contribution drives. --Jgmikulay (talk)\n\ni don't know of any case law or consensus that draws a clear line between landscape architecture or art though. Maya Lin identifies as architect (doesn't sign work). Isamu Noguchi would be a challenge. the list of NRHP, or monuments that are art is a short one. the two you mention plus Marine Corps War Memorial; American Revolution Statuary; Civil War Monuments in Washington, DC; User:Slowking4/Haymarket Martyrs' Monument. (hmm maybe not as short as i thought) most memorial art is PD-old. more typical of NRHP is Ralph Bunche House (Washington, D.C.). you could almost add a fork to wikiloves monuments to upload \"fair use\" for the few that are close. talk to user:SarahStierch if you want more details, she's busy but she'll talk your ear off at happy hour. Slowking4⇔ †@1₭\n\nThe wall is considered an architectural monument and it's maintained by the National Park Service. The piece is actually not copyrighted as a sculpture, unlike the Korean War Memorial and the Three Servicemen statue, which both are. You can photograph it and use it's images until the cows come home. SarahStierch (talk)\n\nmoooo! Almonroth\n\nand the link from NPS on permits provides some information (h/t SarahStierch). Almonroth\n\nThe Twitter account listed, @WSavesPublicArt, is returning a 404 error. What's up?\n\nOur Twitter handle is @wikipublicart. Thanks for your interest! --Jgmikulay (talk)\n\nIt may seem trivial, but I have found inconsistency between the use of \"WikiProject Public Art\" and \"WikiProject Public art\" in the names of pages, categories and templates. This breaks things such as automated archive page links and talk page templates. I've made some changes to standardise on the former. We'll need an admin to mop up any move-protected templates (e.g. {{WikiProject Public art}}) and pages (e.g. Wikipedia:WikiProject Public art/Style guide).\n\nThanks--this is great! Hmmm.... I wonder if we know any nice admins to help with the template correction??? --Jgmikulay (talk)\n\nDo we want them all to be WikiProject Public Art with the A in caps? If so, I'll make the changes. --FloNight♥♥♥♥\n\nYes, please! It makes so much more sense for it to be in all caps, and seems to have just been a mistake in the first place. Many thanks --RichardMcCoy (talk)\n\nAnything related to the project should be \"WikiProject:Public Art\" (perhaps without the colon). The abbreviation WP:PA won't work - it goes to \"No personal attacks\". WP:PubArt and WP:PArt don't seem to work well. How about just WP:Public Art. Gotta have an abbreviation to be anything around here!\n\nArticles and other places talking about art in public spaces should be List of public art in Lancaster, Pennsylvania or maybe Public art in Joppatown, Maryland. Smallbones (talk)\n\nI vote WP:Public Art.--RichardMcCoy (talk)\n\nAgree on all Smallbones' points. Johnbod (talk)\n\nAnd WT:Public Art to this page. Smallbones (talk)\n\nHi everyone,\n\nI have just (re) launched a site which has parallel though crucially not identical aims to those of the Wikipedia public art project: http://bigartmob.com Our central aim is on mapping public art, with a user experience more akin to an online gallery or museum experience than the more categorical and linear model of the Wikipedia project.\n\nWe will soon be writing a scraping tool which will draw in the wikipedia project pages, drawing in only those which have a lat/long northing/westing or other accurate location data associated with the entry.\n\nWe are a Creative commons non commercial share alike licensed site and for each of the entries pulled in from the Wikipedia project will of course ensure that the extant licenses for each entry are duly respected and reproduction within the Big Art Mob database based on a permissions basis from those licenses.\n\nOf course we will also be looking further afield to municipal authority collections which have very little (if any) XML or other standardisation and so we hope that our scraping tool might become a useful resource for the broader community here.\n\nI guess I'm kicking this discussion off to see if anyone sees and potential conflicts or difficulties with our plan and more broadly to discuss how what we are doing might best complement the work being done here.\n\nBest,\n\nAlfie Dennen. — Preceding unsigned comment added by 4lfie (talk • contribs)\n\n(4lfie (talk) ).\n\nHi Alfie.

Another website to consider picking content from is Save Outdoor Sculpture! content from the Smithsonian Institution. SarahStierch (talk)\n\nIf you use a non-commercial licence, then you're not an open project, and your content can't be freely reused by many, including Wikipedia (and you can't use Wikipedia content under that licence). Also, are you aware that OpenStreetMap already maps pubic art, and is open-licensed?\n\nI'm glad to have Andy's opinion here on this because I'm not aware of the legalities of re-using the content on Big Art Mob. Also, I'm interested to know how OpenStreetMap is mapping public art. Example? Thanks!--RichardMcCoy (talk)\n\nBriefly (I'm just going into a meeting; happy to discus later): http://www.openstreetmap.org/browse/node/950324361\n\nHi guys. We are in the process of reviewing both the CC license type and the overall mapping strategy on BAM. At the very least any work brought into the DB which originated at the WP:Public Art page or SOS would be published with the CC BY SA license in place.I am aware of the OSM approach to public art mapping, it's a very different approach to ours I think.4lfie (talk)\n\nI see you're in the UK (I'm in Birmingham); I'd be happy to have a chat off-line about how you could (I'd argue should) make use of and interoperate with OSM data (which is veering off-topic here). You can find a guide to reusing Wikipedia content (which we really want people to do!) at Wikipedia:Reusers.\n\nI have recently submitted a new WikiProject proposal that ties-in closely with WikiProject Public Art. The proposed project is WikiProject Conservation and Collection Care which, if approved, will aim to create new articles, as well as to gather existing articles, concerning conservation and collection care at museums, libraries, historic locations, archives, and other relevant sites into a collaborative project. I am aware that this project will not always relate directly to WikiProject Public Art as collection care may also include objects outside the public realm. However, I am writing to your group to inform you of my decision to request a new project as I listed you as a related group within my proposal. Furthermore, given the connection between the two projects, and my own inexperience with starting a WikiProject, I am open to suggestions, collaborations, and advice from a well-established group such as your own. Thank you.- AngelKelley (talk)\n\nHi AK, Its great that you want to put effort into writing about his important topic but I do think it may be a little too narrow a focus for a Wikiproject; you might like to consider making it a task-force of an existing project. Either way, do please keep up up-to-date with your progress.\n\nHi and thanks for the reply! Do you by chance have a suggestion for which group you think this project might fall under? I can see where the \"too narrow\" aspect comes into play, but given that collections cover museums, libraries, archives, historic locations, and even private galleries, I have found it difficult to find an exisiting WikiProject that really covers all those areas. If you have suggestions though I'm definitely open to further discussion on the matter :) AngelKelley (talk)\n\nI go for whichever project covers one of those topics (museums, libraries, archives, historic locations, private galleries; an art) and has the greatest synergy; then include a pointer in other related project pages: pragmatism over purism.\n\nI have actually already contacted the major WikiProject groups (museums, libraries, historic landmarks, and art) and both the museum and library groups agreed that placing this topic under one of them would not be appropriate given how broad the topic actually is. Collections care really falls under so many potential categories that it's impossible to simply pick one, especially since the goal of the project is to span them all as best as possible. This was the reasoning behind requesting a separate project group. I do understand where you are coming from, but since we would like to include conservation techniques, collection management policies, disaster preparedness, etc., it becomes necessary to not narrow ourselves to a single type of collection. AngelKelley (talk)\n\nDear everybody,\n\nI would like to invite all of you awesome art-buffs to a project called Wiki Loves Public Art (WLPA)! WLPA is organized as a contest by Wikimedia Sweden, with the help and support from our partner Europeana. The contest is much inspired by Wiki Loves Monument, but instead, as the name suggest, the contest focuses on artworks in the public space. I don't think that I need to tell you guys how much is still needed to be done in this field... However, I believe that this could be a great way of make the situation a bit better by increasing knowledge about our work in this field, foster contacts with GLAMs and with the public and get some awesome tools created to help us in our work.\n\nFrom a practical view, as regulations on what a public space constitutes, and the data available, will most likely differ between countries (and perhaps also between different states and regions?) the material accepted for the contest will also have to differ. I think that it makes sense to have a federalist approach to this. Freedom of Panorama also creates troubles, as this is a contest meant for Wikimedia Commons and not for local uploads (i.e. no fair use!). Hence, some countries will only be able to participate with a more narrow focus (such as for example \"Wiki Loves Public Baroque Art\"). However, on a positive note this could in fact be a rather good way to make the general public aware of the existence and the effect of a rather, IMHO, negative piece of legislation.\n\nThe stated goal with this project, from our Description of Work, is to organize Wiki Loves Public Art in six European countries in 2013. However, I would like to do more and am hoping to make the contest as big as possible with many more countries participating. I know what drive and dedication our communities have and what we can do when we put our stubborn minds into producing great material. If you are interested in public art, enjoy organizing events, think that it is cool and interesting to work with projects that increase cooperation between the Chapters, or would like to work towards GLAM in your country and get some valuable contacts, well then this would be something for you! We are looking for all kinds of volunteers and especially for national coordinators that can help us get things going in the countries and coordinate the volunteer efforts. I therefor urge you to sign up as soon as possible on our list of volunteers! You can find our newly created list here.\n\nAll the best,\n\nJohn Andersson (WMSE) (talk) aka. Jopparn (talk)\n\nAfter looking at the project page, I'd say that May 2013 is likely the earliest date anybody in the US could aim for. The problems here are\n\nThe SIRIS database has too many public sculptures in it, including many that are in no way notable, at the same time\n\nThe SIRIS database doesn't have enough reliable info in it on addresses (much of the time) and no geo-location info\n\nSo lots of dirty, sweaty work on tables would have to be done.\n\nAlso copyright restrictions limit the possibilities of taking photos to those pre-1978, and there is a song and dance about checking for visible copyright marks for post-1923 sculptures. Could we trust newbies to do the song and dance?\n\nAny of these problems could prevent US participation unless there is some brilliant solution. Smallbones (talk)\n\nHi, Smallbones and thank you for your thoughtful comments! I am sorry for my late answer. I have been visiting family during my summer vacation and I really avoided using the computer to much. Now I am however back at work again :). Regarding your thoughts:\n\nHow many objects are we talking about in the SIRIS list? In Wiki Loves Monument in Sweden this year the group organizing the contest have included a database of over 120,000 objects of specific historical value. The objects are then divided on list based on their geographical location (mostly based on the municipalities). Is the SIRIS list larger than that? Regarding notability, I personally believe that all public artworks ideally should have a picture on Commons as Commons does not follow the same notability standards as Wikipedia and all of those pictures would, IMHO, be educational. But I certainly agree with you that a lot of public artworks does not deserve an article of their own. But perhaps I am misunderstanding you here? Are there object in the list that isn't art works?\n\nFrom what I remember you telling me during Wikimania, there are addresses for the artworks in the database (even though it isn't always correct as they are sometimes moved etc.). Do I remember that correctly? The data that is old and incorrect we cannot really do anything about except telling the participants of that possibility in connection to the list. Regarding the lack of coordinates I do believe that to be possible to solve. During Wikimania I talked a bit with user:Colossus from Germany and he told me that he automatically created coordinates for the German list of Monuments for Wiki Loves Monuments, based on the addresses. Perhaps that code could be adopted to do the same thing for this database? Of course addresses that are wrong would generate wrong coordinates, but if we are clear about that risk we could hopefully avoid making people to irritated and we could actually make a thing about the extra contribution they will do when they mark a coordinate as incorrect. If there is neither address nor geo-location info available, I guess there is no real answer than trying to find the answers from other sources, or have a table with missing data but still encourage people to try to find them and take pictures if they can.\n\nRegarding copyright, is there any data in the database about the sculptures age? Based on the U.S. copyright laws we could then mark them in the list with red for the ones that the participants cannot take pictures of, and green for the ones that they can take photos of.\n\nI doubt that any of the solutions presented here could be considered brilliant, but perhaps they are at least sufficient?\n\nAll the best,\n\nJohn Andersson (WMSE) (talk) aka. Jopparn (talk)\n\nthere are 92,350 sculptures on the list,[4] including duplicate editions. there are 2861 with copyright on them [5], including those with copyright not renewed. there are sculptures not on the list, but they are rare, and tend to be after 1993. siris is updating their list based on our articles.\n\naddresses are close, the address to gps is a google map feature. it can be a problem for sculpture parks, where works are widely divergent and under tree canopy, not viewable from satelite view. it will require boots on the ground.\n\nwe do not have a notability consensus on public art, however, smithsonian survey is evidence of such. we have website surveys, and book surveys of public art.\n\nthere is date information, but the database is not searchable by date. up to now people are scrapping data by city and making list articles for each city. US wide would be formidable task. it would require a meetup with siris people and wiki data crew, similar to Walters mass upload.\n\nsimplified upload process is the future, but not can't upload, rather upload fork to english wikipedia under a \"fair use\", and then fork to local museum website without \"wiki rules\", such as Walters. it will require wikidata solution plus some wiki code. up till now it's upload everything and tag, delete copyright vios with some false positives. 198.24.31.123 (talk)\n\nEpic discussion about The Elephant House - please take a gander here, I give up. User_talk:SarahStierch#RE:_Closing_of_Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion.2FThe_Elephant_House_.282nd_nomination.29 and on the talk page for the article itself. SarahStierch (talk)\n\nI'd like to make each of the \"List of pubic art in...\" articles emit hCard microformat metadata, using a template for each row. Other advantages are that all the lists would use the same columns and format; and that any agreed changes to the format could be made by changing just one template. I've made a prototype, at {{Public art row}}. Thoughts?\n\nGood idea Andy!! Go for it. SarahStierch (talk)\n\nI'm also in favor. I notice that your prototype doesn't include all of the columns some of our lists use (like owner/administrator), but I think streamlining things could be beneficial. I'm happy to help sort through any conversion difficulties for the lists I've worked on previously. Thanks for thinking about ways to help organize this information better! --Jgmikulay (talk)\n\nAny others? Should we add those for all instances, or make them switchable? I've used the template on List of public art in Hampshire, as a pilot.\n\nPlease tell me there is more than one public artwork in Hampshire. Heh. SarahStierch (talk)\n\nHeh ;-)\n\nOK, I added |owner= and |dimensions=. Anything else?\n\nThat seems great--thank you! Also, thank you for making it so that my husband had to play me PF's Animals LP during our evening meal. --Jgmikulay (talk)\n\nI knew I should have checked this out earlier! Actually the Hampshire example (10 columns) looks ok. List of public art in Philadelphia only needs 9 columns - I like the pic in column 2 - but it needs a lot more rows. Smallbones (talk)\n\nHm, it seems the Philly example is using the \"owner\" column for a reference number. Any idea what that is? Should it go under |notes=? Any other views on whether the name or image should be the first column? With a template, its easy to change ;-)\n\nI like the image in the first column, and I think the reference number could easily be included in notes. This way, if there is a IAS number from the Smithsonian, or another number from state or municipal surveys/catalogs, that information can easily be included but it doesn't make a big empty square for communities that don't organize their art that way. --Jgmikulay (talk)\n\nDeployment\n\nI've finished converting List of public art in Birmingham, which is a well-popuated list. Please convert your own lists, and report any issues here.\n\nYour list looks great! Is it possible for you to share a simple set of procedures for those who need to \"convert\" our lists or may wish to help others? Thanks! --Jgmikulay (talk)\n\nAny tips on converting lists? --RichardMcCoy (talk)\n\ni have been known to cut and paste into a spreadsheet, and use spreadsheet fill to replicate wikicode.\n\ndo you want to make the artwork title bold in the table?\n\nkeep in mind [[Template:Sort]] and [[Template:Sortname]] to sort artname without the the, and last name of artist. Slowking4⇔ †@1₭\n\nExpansion\n\nGreat to see this happening. For British lists, a |listing= parameter would be handy, and if it can somehow be made so that the sort values are Grade I = 1, Grade II* = 2 and Grade II = 3, even better. Hopefully this and some of the other parameters which wouldn't always be used, such as |owner=, can be made optional? Another I'd like to see is |architect=. (List of public art in Westminster gives you an idea of where I'd like these to go.) Can |notes= be a row below that spans all the columns (except for the image), more or less as at Template:Episode list/sublist, as the notes on the Westminster page are pretty extensive? Ham 18:47, 9 August 2012 (UTC) Ooh, and |type= as well, please! :) Ham\n\n|listing= is UK-specific; |designation= might be better, per {{Infobox building}}. I have concerns about the accessibility of {{Episode list}}. Lets see what the rest of the PA project folk say.\n\nI have no objection to |designation=. Ham\n\nI've added |type= and |designation=, for now. The latter could also be used for UIDs in designation databases. If we do make parameters optional, we should do so for artist, which would allow the template to be used on single-artist lists like William Bloye.\n\nCould others give their views on all this, please?\n\nI agree with |artist= being optional, for the reason given by Andy. Would we have |subject= as optional for lists such as List of statues of Queen Victoria? Ham\n\nthe type and designation fields take up space if not applicable. is there a way to make optional? (collapse column) its spreads the list too far right. see List of public art in Philadelphia. 98.169.254.39 (talk)\n\nI second the request for more optional parameters. I'd like |dimensions=, |coordinates= and |owner= to be optional, and don't object to |type= and |designation= being added to that list. For each area there are different kinds of data available; sometimes it's possible to find the dimensions, sometimes it isn't... and so on. I also think |architect= is a necessary addition for architectural sculpture, statues on columns, or anything else where a sculptor and an architect were involved. That could be another optional parameter, of course. If these things were done I'd happily convert List of public art in Westminster, which I'd like to submit to WP:PR at some point, to the template. Ham\n\nThe Carleton W. Angell and the Bath School disaster articles would really benefit from having a good image of Angell's 'Girl with a Cat'. The statue - which seems to have been quite famous in its day for the sculptor himself, the event it memorializes and the way funds were raised for its production - is presently located behind glass at the Bath School Disaster Museum in the Bath, Michigan Middle School. From what I've seen of the somewhat-poor images available online, the actual statue...well, after you look at it a while, I don't know why, but it is really powerful...and it's just a statue of a little girl with her hair blowing in the wind holding a cat. If anyone can lend a hand with this quest, please post on my talkpage. I've put the Bath School article up for a Wikipedia Good Article nomination and I think a pic of this statue that would really improve it and the Angell articles. Thanks for listening, Shearonink (talk)\n\nAnyone interested in collaborating on the article for this sculpture in Vancouver? This should be a pretty easy article to get to Good status. I will likely continue working on the article on my own even if no one else wants to pitch in, but I thought I'd extend a request in the spirit of collaboration! Feel free to jump right in or leave a note on my talk page if interested! --Another Believer (Talk)\n\nI've made some tweaks; and dropped a couple of suggestions on the talk page.\n\nGreat, thanks! And congrats again on your recent honor. --Another Believer (Talk)\n\n{Cross-posted from the talk page for WP:VAMOS):\n\nThere's currently a lengthy and contentious discussion at Talk:Arts on the Line over the use of non-free images which hasn't resulted in much consensus. However, it has emerged that if individual artworks are notable enough to have their own pages then fair use images are allowed on the individual pages. Many of the artworks have been given sufficient attention to justify individual articles. However, a problem then emerges with naming. Take, for example, Richard Fleischner's untitled work at Alewife station. Untitled (Richard Fleischner) or Untitled (Fleischner) are insufficient because Fleischner has had at least three major untitled works which may be sufficiently notable for their own articles. Untitled (Alewife station) or similar is not viable because there are no less than four untitled artworks at the station which I plan to have articles about. For the time being I'm working with the clunky Untitled (Richard Fleischner artwork at Alewife station). I would very much appreciate suggestions of a better title to move the article to.

RevelationDirect (talk)\n\nI was recently in a discussion with @Another Believer: about the naming of categories such as Category:Sculptures by Daniel Chester French in which I expressed dissatisfaction (in the mildest of manners) with the use of the word “sculptures,” which I felt, and still do, should be just “sculpture.” The word “sculpture” is properly used as a plural or collective noun. For example, Save Outdoor Sculpture! (see discussion above) chose to do it that way, the Smithsonian maintains “the Inventories of American Painting and Sculpture”, the SIRIS data base is set up as “Outdoor Sculpture-Michigan” and there are no doubt other examples. It might be a bit of a haul to bring Wikipedia into the usage that the rest of the world (okay, the USA, but I’ll bet lots of other places too), but isn’t that what we do here? I just looked up my copies of the amazing sculpture (not “sculptures”) survey of the UK and they are all titles something like “Public Sculpture of Glasgow,” etc. I am not sure how to make a formal proposal but let’s start with just talking about it.

This WikiProject aligns closely with the work of the GLAM-Wiki initiative (Galleries, Libraries, Archives, and Museums), a global community of volunteers who assist cultural institutions with sharing resources with Wikimedia. GLAM-Wiki US is a new community initiative focused on organizing cultural collaborations within the United States. GLAM organizations are diverse and span numerous topics, from libraries and art museums to science centers and historic sites. We currently have a backlog of interested institutions- and we need your help!\n\nAre you interested in helping with current or future GLAM projects? Join→ Online Volunteers\n\nWe hope you'll join the growing GLAM-Wiki community in the US. Thank you!\n\n-Lori Phillips (Talk), US Cultural Partnerships Coordinator\n\nFor more information visit→ The GLAM:US portal or GLAM-Wiki on Outreach\n\nTo commemorate International Women's Day, I invite project members to help expand the newly-created article, Fearless Girl. ---Another Believer (Talk)\n\nI invite editors to assist with expanding the article about the recently unveiled Bust of Cristiano Ronaldo. There are additional sources shared on the article's talk page. Thanks! ---Another Believer (Talk)\n\nMoved to draft space: Draft:Bust of Cristiano Ronaldo. ---Another Believer (Talk)\n\nI have submitted a request to have the article's deletion overturned. I invite editors to review Draft:Bust of Cristiano Ronaldo, then share their thoughts at Wikipedia:Deletion review/Log/2017 June 22. Thanks! ---Another Believer (Talk)\n\nThere are discussions on the Art on the Underground, London Underground and Piccadilly Circus tube station talk pages to discuss potential improvements to these pages regarding Art on the Underground and art in the station itself. I would welcome your assistance. 86.13.122.76 (talk)\n\nProject members are invited to create and expand articles about individual statues within the National Statuary Hall Collection. See the following link for discussion: Talk:National_Statuary_Hall_Collection#Standalone_article_for_each_sculpture. Thanks! ---Another Believer (Talk)\n\nPer Lists of public art, I've identified some missing articles:\n\nFeel free to expand this list, or strike entries once articles are created. Thanks! ---Another Believer (Talk)\n\n@Missvain: Pinging just in case you're interested or have any hidden drafts to get the ball rolling. Thanks! ---Another Believer (Talk)\n\nHa! Thanks. I don't have any right now of any of these cities, but we'll see how inspired I become... post-fire binge ;) Missvain (talk)\n\nWell, I found San Francisco. I knew I had one lying around someplace... super incomplete. But, it's a start!

Thanks! ---Another Believer (Talk)\n\nGreetings, project members. The article Bust of Cristiano Ronaldo was deleted last year, but I've resurrected the topic in the form of Draft:Bust of Cristiano Ronaldo, since the artist has created a second bust depicting Ronaldo. I invite WikiProject participants to either make further improvements to the draft, or contribute to this discussion, where I've pinged all editors who were involved in last year's deletion and merge discussions. Thanks! ---Another Believer (Talk)\n\nAnother Believer - I'm genuinely puzzled, having read the objections from both outings. Your draft is high quality and as Notability is determined by coverage, it seems to me that it fully qualifies. I think there's an \"I don't like it\" element to the opposition. I feel the same about bitcoin articles, but I don't stand in their way when they are well sourced. If you'd like me to accept it, I'm happy to do so, although you can, of course, place it in mainspace yourself. Just drop a note on my Talkpage. Best regards. KJP1 (talk)\n\n@KJP1: Thanks. I've never really understood the resistance either. I agree, there seems to be an \"I don't like it\" sentiment, or possibly some of the editors are more interested in sports article standards and not articles about public art and sculpture? I'd love for you to comment at Talk:Cristiano_Ronaldo_International_Airport#Bust_of_Cristiano_Ronaldo,_part_2 and/or move the draft into the main space, if you're willing. I'm fine with the community having this debate again. ---Another Believer (Talk)\n\n@HJ Mitchell: No rush, but just pinging a reminder here since you've indicated a willingness to help move the draft into main space. Thanks! ----Another Believer (Talk)\n\nTo be clear, I tried creating this article before (Bust of Cristiano Ronaldo), and it was redirected. I'm not exactly sure how to merge these, or preserve their histories. Please let me know if you have any questions or concerns. Thanks! ----Another Believer (Talk)\n\n: Moved Thanks! ---Another Believer (Talk)\n\n@Another Believer: (ec) It needed an admin to delete the target page, move it, and then restore the old history, which I've done. The rest is up to you. :) HJ Mitchell | Penny for your thoughts?\n\n@HJ Mitchell: Thanks! ---Another Believer (Talk)\n\nUpdate: The article was redirected. I still invite project members to weigh in on this discussion: Talk:Cristiano_Ronaldo_International_Airport#Bust_of_Cristiano_Ronaldo,_part_2. ---Another Believer (Talk)\n\nPage watchers may be interested in updating the Sam Houston (sculpture) article. I don't really appreciate the comment an editor left on the talk page recently, but regardless, the article could use some improvements. Thanks for your consideration. ---Another Believer (Talk)\n\nPlease see this discussion at WikiProject Visual arts re: the most appropriate title for Andrew Jackson (National Statuary Hall Collection). Thanks! ---Another Believer (Talk)\n\nTemplate:Public art in Washington, D.C. has been nominated for merging with Template:Public art in the United States.

Otr500 (talk)\n\nHello! Wiki Education is developing a guide to help students improve articles related to art history. The handout is meant to supplement other resources that they consult, such as an interactive training and basic editing brochures. We’d love to get some community feedback on the draft here: User:Cassidy_(Wiki_Ed)/Art_history. We're looking to gather feedback by August 16th. Feel free to respond here or on the draft's talk page. Thanks so much! Cassidy (Wiki Ed) (talk)\n\nSee Talk:Mohandas K. Gandhi (sculpture, San Francisco) ---Another Believer (Talk)\n\nHello!
