        "text": "At Rundle College, students become leaders, scholars, scientists, artists, musicians, athletes, humanitarians, philanthropists and more by discovering their passions and potential across a broad range of opportunities. Rundle students thrive in a safe, caring and kind environment.\n\nFollowing Rundle’s Pathways to Learning philosophy, students’ high academic achievement is fortified by a multitude of co-curricular, character, and leadership-building programs.\n\nJoin us on September 25 at our College Open House to learn more. RSVP today!\n\nUnique among independent schools in Canada, Rundle delivers parallel College and Academy programs on two separate campuses. The Academy program meets the needs of students who have a diagnosed learning disability, with or without ADHD. Our students are in the average to above-average range of intellectual functioning but have difficulties with specific academic activities and skills.\n\nRundle Academy is a caring learning community where students have the space to develop confidence, self-esteem and motivation to excel academically and grow in their love for learning.\n\nIt is important for students to connect with others. Rundle Studio provides opportunities for students to reach out and connect with their communities in a variety of ways. By reaching out to help those in need in the community, volunteering for a local organization, or spending time with family and friends, connecting with others is an important piece of a student’s character development.\n\nThrough co-curricular activities, such as esports, students engage in opportunities to collaborate, strategize, communicate, and interact with peers from a variety of places all over Canada and around the world.\n\nDuring TA time, students in small class sizes interact with each other to learn, solve problems, and engage in collaborative projects. Throughout the year, students are given challenges to complete as a group. Students compete in House Teams to earn points, which are collected throughout the school year and provide students with a friendly environment to compete in a fun way with other students.\n\nStudents are encouraged to develop healthy eating habits. Typically, students with complex learning needs exert a lot of mental energy throughout the day as they concentrate and focus on applying personalized strategies while learning. As such, Rundle Studio teaches students the importance of nutrition and its effects on their minds and bodies. In collaboration with their families, students work to plan healthy meals and snacks to optimize their learning experience and potential.\n\nStudent services provides academic guidance and social and emotional counselling to ensure each student is well-supported in all areas of their life. This work aligns with Rundle’s mission to help students discover their potential and prepare them for an ever-changing world.\n\nQualified, knowledgeable, and skilled counsellors are available virtually to support Studio students.\n\nStudent Services works closely with teachers to track student progress, and monitor academic and personal development.\n\nThe department also provides comprehensive career and post-secondary support for students from junior high through high school."
