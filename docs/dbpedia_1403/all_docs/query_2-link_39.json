        "text": "I met with Alex Megelas, Manager of Research Innovation and Business Development at Concordia University's AI Institute to discuss what Concordia University is doing to help springboard organizations forward on AI. He told me about a tantalizing grant program they administer, called PROMPT. PROMPT is a provincial grant intended specifically to link industry and non-profits with researchers and collaborators in order to push the boundary of ethical AI further into the realm of work. Here at Studio 7 Communications we are actively evaluating tools, processes, frameworks, and models for working with AI that we feel could make a demonstratable impact on performance. Our in-house performance consultants have all recently attended AI conferences with multiple use cases explored, and perhaps like many of you, are hungry for more actionable insights guided by research. If you would like to see your organization or enterprise get actively involved in AI tools and AI upskilling there is no better way than to conduct a limited scope project with defined goals and loads of support (did I mention Concordia’s AI Institute has nearly a dozen staff on hand to help move your project forward – incl data scientists and programmers). The grant covers about 50% of costs and can go up to 100% for non-profits. If you are interested in exploring how your organization can leverage AI for Learning and Development, reach out. Together, we can assemble a pilot project that sets you on the road for success - action required - the deadline for grant applications is end of July - let us meet that deadline for you"
