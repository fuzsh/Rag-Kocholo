This can complicate the work of marketers and analysts.\n\nMarketers will have to adjust their campaign tagging methods so that campaign traffic is properly allocated to the new GA4 channel groups.\n\nMeanwhile, analysts now have to create custom channel groups manually and repeat this procedure each time a new report is needed.\n\nIn this article, we cover the GA4 channel grouping features and what to do for those who are accustomed to using custom grouping in their reports.\n\nNote: This post was originally published in Dec 2022 as a comparison between GAU and GA4 and was completely updated in November 2023 for accuracy and comprehensiveness.\n\nWhat is Channel Grouping in Google Analytics (GA4)\n\nChannel Grouping in Google Analytics (GA4) is a method of categorizing traffic into meaningful channels, allowing marketers and analysts to understand the origins and behaviors of their website visitors.\n\nBy default, GA4 provides a set of predefined channels such as Organic Search, Direct, Email, Paid, and Social, but users do have the ability to create custom channel groupings to better align with their marketing strategies.\n\nBenefits of Channel Grouping in GA4\n\nChannel grouping in Google Analytics 4 offers several benefits, including-:\n\nStreamlined Traffic Analysis: Categorizes user interactions into meaningful groups for a clearer view of traffic sources.\n\nImproved Marketing Insights: Identifies the most effective marketing channels, facilitating campaign optimization.\n\nEfficient Resource Allocation: Helps allocate resources more effectively by understanding which channels perform best.\n\nUser Behavior Understanding: Aids in comprehending user behavior, allowing for enhanced engagement strategies.\n\nPersonalized Content: Tailors content to better match audience preferences, leading to improved user experiences.\n\nData-Driven Decision-Making: Enables data-driven decisions, adapting to changing market dynamics for better performance.\n\nGroup traffic by your rules\n\nApply your custom channel grouping to GA4 BigQuery Export or raw unsampled website streaming data with OWOX BI.\n\nStart Free Trial\n\n4.9\n\nChannel Grouping in Google Analytics 4 vs Universal Analytics\n\nIn the transition from Universal Analytics to Google Analytics 4 (GA4), the concept of Channel Grouping remains important but with notable differences.\n\nGA4 channel grouping introduces more advanced machine learning capabilities, enabling it to automatically categorize traffic sources more accurately. This offers a deeper understanding of user behavior and marketing performance.\n\nAdditionally, GA4 allows for greater flexibility in custom channel groupings, making it a more adaptable choice for businesses seeking detailed insights. While Universal Analytics offers standard predefined channel groupings, GA4 provides a more advanced and customizable approach to analyzing and categorizing web traffic.\n\nCompared to Universal Analytics, Google Analytics 4 (GA4) now has 19 more default channel groups:\n\nGoogle Analytics 4Universal AnalyticsDirectDirectDisplayDisplayOrganic SearchOrganic SearchEmailEmailAffiliatesAffiliatesReferralReferralPaid SearchPaid SearchPaid SocialSocialPaid VideoOther AdvertisingCross-networkOrganic ShoppingOrganic SocialOrganic VideoPaid ShoppingAudioSMSMobile Push Notifications\n\nYou can also apply custom channel grouping for Google Ads traffic:\n\nPaid Search\n\nPaid Video\n\nDisplay\n\nCross-network\n\nPaid Social\n\nHere is the list of channels for Display & Video 360 traffic:\n\nDisplay\n\nPaid Video\n\nAudio\n\nPaid Other\n\nAnd last by sometimes important - channels for Search Ads 360 traffic:\n\nPaid Search\n\nPaid Social\n\nSome Google Analytics universal channel groups remain unchanged in GA4, such as Direct or Organic Search.\n\nSome groups in Google Analytics 4 have been given broader definitions, such as Email, Affiliates, and Paid Search.\n\nSome groups were not in Universal Analytics at all, such as Paid Social, Organic Social, and Video.\n\nAdditionally, all of the channels in Google Analytics 4 are divided into four subgroups:\n\nChannels for manual traffic\n\nChannels for Google Ads traffic\n\nChannels for Display & Video 360 traffic\n\nChannels for Search Ads 360 traffic.\n\nWhat else is different about channel grouping in Google Analytics 4?\n\nYou cannot add new channels to the default channel group.\n\nYou cannot edit the rules for the default channel group.\n\nNote: Unlike Universal Analytics, Google Analytics 4 is case-insensitive in UTM tags, so it behooves you to make the tags easy to read and interpret. Keep the tags lowercase. You can also add spaces as long as you make sure that the format stays consistent.\n\nUncover in-depth insights\n\nOWOX UTM Builder\n\nDownload now\n\nBonus for readers\n\nUnderstanding Default Channel Grouping in Google Analytics 4\n\nIn Google Analytics 4 (GA4), default channel grouping classifies incoming traffic into distinct categories, allowing you to analyze the sources of your website visitors. These predefined default channel grouping include:\n\n\"Direct\" (users who enter your URL directly)\n\n\"Organic Search\" (traffic from search engine results)\n\n\"Referral\" (visitors from other websites)\n\n\"Social\" (social media referrals)\n\n\"Email\" (email marketing)\n\n\"Paid Search\" (search engine advertising)\n\n\"Display\" (display advertising)\n\n\"Other\" (uncategorized sources).\n\nThese GA4 default channel groupings provide a quick overview of your website's traffic sources, aiding in understanding user behavior and marketing effectiveness.\n\nThe default channel groups also have dimensions known as\n\nDefault channel grouping- The channels by which users arrive at your site/app\n\nSession default channel grouping- The channels by which users arrive at your site/app when they initiate a new session.\n\nFirst user default channel grouping- The channels by which users first arrive at your site/app.\n\nPlease note, you cannot edit Default Channel Group in Google Analytics 4.\n\nHow to view the Default Channel Grouping Report in Google Analytics 4\n\nOpen Google Analytics 4 and go to the Reports section in the tab on the left.\n\nOpen the reports in the Acquisition section:\n\nChoose the Traffic acquisition report, which contains all summaries of channel groupings:\n\nTo view statistics in terms of channel grouping, select Session default channel group in the drop-down list:\n\nIn this report, you will find:\n\na breakdown of users by channel group by day\n\nthe total number of users by channel group for the selected period\n\na detailed table with data on the main metrics (sessions, users, events, conversions, etc.)\n\nWhat is Custom Channel Grouping in GA4?\n\nCustom Channel Grouping in GA4 enables users to define unique groupings that align with their marketing strategies beyond the default channels. By setting specific rules and conditions, users can categorize traffic to reflect their business goals, allowing for more granular analysis.\n\nCustom channel groups in GA4 can be set as the main dimension in many reports, like Acquisition, and as a secondary dimension in standard reports, such as Events. They are also usable in custom reports, explorations, and for creating audience conditions. Notably, they can reorganize past report data. However, one limitation is their inapplicability in the Conversions paths report, restricting their use in some advanced analysys.\n\nBenefits of Custom Channel Grouping\n\nBy utilizing custom channel grouping in Google Analytics 4 you can customize them according to your own rules; it will be more convenient to analyze their effectiveness and see the whole picture.\n\nWith Universal Analytics, you can set up channel groups according to your UTM structure. Google Analytics 4 is not as flexible — you must adjust the UTM structure to match the channel groups.\n\nObviously, the correct UTM markup will matter more in Google Analytics 4 than in Universal Analytics. And the more employees and partners you have involved in marketing campaigns, the more difficult it will be to bring it all into the right form and a unified structure.\n\nUnlike the GA4 default channel grouping, a custom channel group can be applied to historical data. This way, you can fix possible errors in UTM markup.\n\nLet’s summarize the benefits of custom channel grouping:\n\nTransparency — You can group channels according to your own logic that is understandable to you and not rely on a conditional black box.\n\nFewer problems with UTM tags and possible errors in them\n\nPossibility to change the channel grouping logic for historical data\n\nIf you don't require extensive external reporting or analysis, utilizing API might not be necessary.\n\nWhen is it appropriate to use custom channel grouping?\n\nYou’re using a custom traffic source and/or channel.\n\nGoogle Analytics shows several different referrals for the same channel in reports. For example, Facebook. With the help of GA4 custom grouping, all these referrals can be combined into one Facebook group.\n\nDifferent traffic sources are part of the same marketing channel. For example, Google Analytics can report traffic from email as Newsletter/email, owox.com/referral, and freemail.co.uk/referral.\n\nYour Facebook/CPC campaigns fall into the Paid channel group by default, but you must separate them into a Paid Social group.\n\nYou want Google Analytics reports to be understandable to all employees and partners, even those who are not very familiar with the analytics system/\n\nHow to build custom channel grouping in Google Analytics 4\n\nYou can build a report on Google Analytics 4 data with your own channel grouping in Four ways:\n\nCreate a Custom Channel group in GA4\n\nUse special Exploration Reports in Google Analytics 4.\n\nConnect Google Analytics 4 data to Looker Studio (formerly Google Data Studio) and set grouping conditions there.\n\nUpload data from Google Analytics 4 to Google BigQuery and group channels there.\n\nLet’s take a closer look at each of the methods:\n\nSetting up Custom channel grouping in GA4.\n\nTo set up a custom channel group, you begin by duplicating an existing group and making the necessary adjustments. If you haven't already established any groups, you can initiate the process by replicating the default group. If you've previously created other groups, you can commence by copying either one of those or the default group, depending on your requirements. Current dimensions available to Create Custom Channel Groups on GA4:\n\nDefault Channel Groups\n\nMedium\n\nSource\n\nSource Platform\n\nCampaign ID\n\nCampaign Name\n\nLet us walk you through an example of the process of creating a custom channel group for ‘Sunny Apparel’s summer beachwear campaign, focusing on social media activities, particularly in the Malibu and Bali regions.\n\nStep 1: Navigate to the GA4 admin section and select Channel Groups.\n\nStep 2: Click on “Create new channel group” to start.\n\nWe recommend duplicating the existing group and making edits as it's much easier unless you want something that requires detailed customization.\n\nStep 3: Enter the group name - eg ”Beachwear Promo Social Media”. This name should reflect the group's purpose, which in your case is tracking a specific promotional campaign.\n\nAdd a Description (Optional but Recommended):\n\nInclude a brief description, such as \"This channel group is designed to track and analyze the performance of Sunny Apparel's summer beachwear campaign on social media, with a focus on the Malibu and Bali regions.\" This helps in providing context for the group, especially when multiple custom groups are used.\n\nGiven below are some of the default channel descriptions already available:\n\nSince we are focusing on social media activities, so we will keep the “paid social” channel. We have the liberty to remove the other channels from this group as these arent necessary to track for this scenario.\n\nStep 4: Create New Channel\n\nTo create a new channel, you need to click on “Add new Channel”.\n\nThen you will need to add the channel name and additional details like source, and medium.\n\nHere's how you could rewrite the configuration for new regional channels focusing on Bali and Malibu for your Facebook Market Pages:\n\nFor Bali:\n\nChannel name: Bali\n\nCampaign name exactly matches (=) Summer Swim\n\nSource exactly matches (=) facebook.com/Bali\n\nFor Malibu:\n\nChannel name: Malibu\n\nCampaign name exactly matches (=) Summer Swim\n\nSource exactly matches (=) facebook.com/Malibu\n\nThis setup ensures that your GA4 tracking is specifically tailored to the Bali and Malibu regions, corresponding to your localized content on the respective Facebook Market Pages.\n\nAfter adding these details, you can save the channel and proceed.\n\nStep 5: Click Reorder and drag to reorder the list if you need to change the order of channels. Click Apply.Step 6: When you have all the channel definitions you need, and they're in the order you want, click Save group.\n\nViewing Data Report for the Custom Channel Group\n\nTo analyze the performance of your \"Beachwear Promo Social Media\" campaign, particularly for the Malibu and Bali regions, you can use the following reports:\n\nAcquisition > User Acquisition Report\n\nSelect the \"Beachwear Promo Social Media\" channel group as the primary dimension.\n\nThis report will show user acquisition metrics for the entire channel group.\n\nAcquisition > Traffic Acquisition Report\n\nSimilar to the User Acquisition Report, choose the \"Beachwear Promo Social Media\" channel group as the primary dimension.\n\nThis report provides insights into traffic sources and user behavior within the group.\n\nHow to build an Exploration Report with custom channel grouping in Google Analytics 4\n\nIn Google Analytics 4, you can use Exploration Reports to group channels according to your conditions and view statistics. For example, you can group Facebook sources:\n\nTo do this, open the Explore section.\n\nSelect Free form:\n\nSpecify the settings for the report:\n\nWhere:\n\n1 is the name of the report.\n\n2 is the period for which you want to view statistics.\n\n3 and 5 are parameters in the context of which you will view statistics. To group channels, use the Session source/medium parameter.\n\n4 and 6 are metrics of interest.\n\n7 is the filter by sources to be grouped. On the screen is an example for Facebook. Using the filter and its conditions, you can group any sources.\n\nAfter completing these settings, you will get a table with statistics on grouped channels:\n\nHow to set up custom channel grouping in Looker Studio (formerly Google Data Studio)\n\nAnother way to customize channel grouping is to connect Google Analytics 4 data to Looker Studio (formerly Google Data Studio) with a built-in connector and set grouping conditions there. It won’t be as reliable as Google BigQuery, but if you need a quick solution, you can use this implementation.\n\nTo connect data to a report, open Looker Studio and select Blank Report:\n\nIn the opened window, select the data source. In our case, it’s Google Analytics 4:\n\nSelect a Google Analytics 4 account and resource to connect it to Looker Studio, and click the Add button:\n\nSet grouping conditions:\n\nMethod 1: Use source field settings:\n\nMethod 2: Open the list of report sources:\n\nClick Edit for the Google Analytics 4 source:\n\nAdd a new field:\n\nFill in the settings for the new channel grouping field. To do this, use the CASE WHEN formula (example for grouping Facebook sources):\n\n1 – specify the field name\n\n2 – fill in the grouping conditions\n\n3 – click the Save button to save the new field\n\nExample for grouping different channels:\n\nClick Done and go to the report visualization settings using the new field:\n\nCustom channel grouping in Google BigQuery\n\nIt’s not possible to edit historical data in Google Analytics. Therefore, if your UTM tags were configured incorrectly and you sent traffic data to the wrong channel group in Google Analytics 4, you cannot fix this in the system interface.\n\nLuckily, you can upload the required data to Google BigQuery and use SQL to correctly group channels even for past traffic.\n\nChallenges and Constraints Associated with Channel Grouping in Google Analytics 4\n\nComplex Setup: Customizing channels requires a deep understanding of GA4's rule-based system, which can be daunting.\n\nData Discrepancies: Mismatches can occur between expected and reported traffic due to misconfigured or overlapping rules.\n\nMaintenance: Channels must be regularly updated to reflect changes in marketing strategies, which can be resource-intensive.\n\nHistorical Data: Custom groupings only affect data moving forward, not retroactively, complicating historical comparisons.\n\nIntegration Issues: Difficulties may arise when trying to align GA4 channel groupings with data from other analytics platforms.\n\nLimitations in Segmentation: There might be constraints in how finely traffic can be segmented, affecting detailed analysis.\n\nHow to automate GA4 channel grouping with OWOX BI\n\nAnother advantage of grouping channels in Google BigQuery is the ability to automate the process and significantly save analysts’ time on preparing reports. OWOX BI will help you with this.\n\nWhat is the problem about?\n\nTo build reports, data from different sources must be correctly processed and combined. Data preparation is a process. It’s not enough to prepare a report (or even many). Data must be updated regularly, and changes to reports must be made permanently. All this is now done by the hands of analysts, which takes a long time and requires the help of SQL queries and scripts.\n\nIf you build reports on raw, non-business-ready data, you may encounter many recurring problems: finding errors and causes of discrepancies will take a lot of time, and the channel grouping logic must be constantly duplicated in all SQL queries. If you decide to change the logic — for example, move one channel to another group — then all requests will need to be redone. With data transformation and modeling, this task is solved before a report is built.\n\nHow OWOX solves these issues:\n\nOWOX BI collects raw data and automatically converts it to the format you need according to your company’s data model. Due to seamless data collection and preparation, you don’t have the risk of human errors and poor execution quality. Moreover, you have full control over the whole data flow and can see any errors as they appear.\n\nAutomated no-code SQL-based transformation templates and UI scheduling empower your teams to transform data. No engineering skills or complex tools are required.\n\nIf you need to change the grouping of channels, for example, it’s enough to change the grouping once at the model level, and it will be applied to all reports. You don’t need to change everything and then look for discrepancies manually.In addition, OWOX BI accurately collects traffic sources for each user visit and not just for the first visit, as Google Analytics 4 does. This will give you the flexibility to define conversion sources and channel scoring.\n\nAutomatically import Non-Google ad cost data into Google Analytics 4 with OWOX BI\n\nCurrently, Google offers only a manual way to import ad cost data into Google Analytics 4. You can automate this process and save valuable time using the solution from OWOX BI.\n\nMeasure CPO and ROAS in GA4\n\nAutomatically link your Ad Platforms cost data to Google Analytics 4 conversion data, so you can analyze your marketing KPIs and make fully informed decisions\n\nStart Free Trial\n\n4.9\n\nImportant! If you plan to import advertising costs to Google Analytics 4, you need to add the required parameter utm_id (campaign identifier) to the links of your advertisement campaigns.\n\nKey Takeaways\n\nYou can build a report on Google Analytics 4 data with your own channel grouping in several ways:\n\nBuild a custom channel group in Google Analytics 4\n\nUse special Exploration Reports in Google Analytics 4.\n\nConnect Google Analytics 4 data to Looker Studio (formerly Google Data Studio) and set grouping conditions there.\n\nUpload data from Google Analytics 4 to Google BigQuery and group channels using SQL.\n\nUse OWOX BI Transformation.\n\nThe first few methods involve the manual work of analysts, which must be repeated every time a new report is needed. To automate the process and save time, you can create a data model using OWOX BI Transformation. Use prebuilt SQL transformations (or create your own) to make raw data business-ready and get insights faster.\n\nFAQ\n\nExpand all Close all\n\nWhat is channel grouping in Google Analytics 4 (GA4)?\n\nChannel grouping in GA4 categorizes traffic sources into predefined groups to help users understand the origin of traffic and the performance of different marketing channels.\n\nHow does channel grouping in GA4 differ from Universal Analytics?\n\nGA4 offers new predefined channel groups and is more restrictive in custom channel creation than Universal Analytics.
