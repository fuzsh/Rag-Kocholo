        "text": "The Sci|Art Lab+Studio Summer Institute exposes high school students to the scientific method and artistic processes as complementary tools for rethinking traditional models of exploration and innovation by making connections between scientific research, popular culture, and contemporary arts.\n\nThe program will include lab visits, workshops facilitating hands-on experiments, and lectures with world-renowned artists and scientists. Through engagement, students will be exposed to the work of scientists and artists that explore new forms of creative expression, communication, and collaboration within this multi-disciplinary field.\n\nTo foster academic development, students will develop an original concept for a collaborative final project under the challenge of ‘Imagine the Impossible’. Building off of course material and guided by the assistance and skill of the base Sci|Art Team, student groups will create and deliver a multimedia presentation to share their work and ideas during the program’s closing ceremony.\n\nApplication deadline: June 1, 2024 | Enrollment deadline: June 15, 2024\n\nApplications are reviewed and admission to the program is granted on a rolling basis starting February 15th. Applying at your earliest convenience, prior to June 1st, is highly recommended.\n\nThe program has application requirements for admission. Eligible applicants who successfully submit all requirements will be reviewed and notified via email of an admission decision within 3 weeks.\n\nApplicants are required to provide the following during the online registration process:\n\nAn unofficial transcript from grade 9 to present reflecting a cumulative GPA of 3.2 or higher\n\nIf your school transcript utilizes a different grading system, please submit your transcript as is. If available, please attach a translation/equivalency guide.\n\nINTERNATIONAL STUDENTS: If you are an international student, a transcript refers to your complete secondary academic record. To learn more about converting your grades into a US-based GPA, please click here.\n\nIf your school has a translation/equivalency guide, please also include it with your transcript. If you do not have a translation/equivalency guide, please still submit your most up-to-date transcript as is for staff to review.\n\nValue statement: At the time of registration, ALL applicants will be prompted to submit a few short sentences reflecting on their pursuit of participation in a UCLA Precollege Summer Institute. Please note that students are strongly discouraged from relying on ChatGpt/AI tools for their application responses and are encouraged to submit original and authentic answers.\n\nA 500-word essay from one of the following prompts:\n\nChoose a favorite sci-fi movie or book and tell us what ideas you find exciting within it.\n\nIf you plan to pursue the sciences as a major in college, tell us about your art or music interests.\n\nIf you plan to pursue the arts as a major in college, tell us about your interest in science and technology.\n\nOptional letter of recommendation from a teacher or counselor. Letters of recommendation can be submitted via email to artscicenter@gmail.com after online registration is complete.\n\nDue to the intense nature of the Sci|Art Lab + Studio Summer Institute (In-person) – Session A & C, and the time commitment involved, living in on-campus housing is mandatory.\n\nFor more information on UCLA housing precollege programs, please see the Housing for Minors page.\n\nAll precollege programs with mandatory housing also feature scheduled non-curricular evening and weekend activities that all students are expected to participate in. The nature of these scheduled activities is at the sole discretion of the individual academic department offering the program, and are not operated by UCLA Summer Sessions. To learn more about when your selected program will host such activities, please consult the schedules for each program, or contact the department in question directly: ivanadama@g.ucla.edu.\n\nMost of our precollege programs with mandatory housing will hold check-in on the Sunday before the start of the program between 4-6pm, and hold check-out the Saturday after the final day of class at 11am. Please contact the department in question directly to confirm check-in and check-out times: ivanadama@g.ucla.edu.\n\nThe Sci|Art Lab + Studio Summer Institute (Virtual) – Session B will be conducted virtually (online). All meeting times will take place in Pacific Daylight Time (PDT), unless otherwise noted on program schedule and syllabus. Participants must log-in to virtual sessions at the times indicated on the program schedule.\n\nStudents in the virtual program will not be offered housing.\n\nUCLA Summer Sessions Summer Scholars Support\n\nQualified students attending grades 9th – 11th in Spring 2024 in the state of California may be eligible for Summer Scholars Support, a need- and merit-based scholarship offered by the UCLA Summer Sessions Office. Students must be 15 years old by the first day of Summer Sessions 2024 on June 24th in order to participate in a Precollege Summer Institute and/or apply for Summer Scholars Support. A limited number of full and partial scholarships are available to support enrollment in SCIP/eSCIP, one Summer Course, or a Precollege Summer Institute.\n\nSummer 2024 deadline to apply: March 15.\n\nThe Sci|Art Lab+Studio Summer Institute focuses on interdisciplinary collaborations, exploring the possibilities and implications of scientific and technological innovation through the application of creative methodologies. In this program, we consider how merging science and art cultures can expand the communication of knowledge, enrich approaches to science and technology, as well as foster and build community across disciplines. The advantage of adding an artistic approach to scientific thinking lies in arts ability to address challenges from a wider and more creative thought-process, inspiring alternative ways for dealing with and applying complexities.\n\nThrough historical retrospective, cutting-edge lab visits, guest lectures, field trips, surveys of current art-science collaborations, science fiction movie screenings, and a final project consisting of both science and art research, students are exposed and immersed in the interface of science, art, and culture.\n\nYes, for the final project, students will work collaboratively in small groups under the challenge: “Imagine the Impossible”. Students will focus on one aspect of the course work that they are interested in and work in small groups to expand upon and research their chosen topic. They are asked to develop ideas or methodologies for the application of this information, whether that be in an art project, product proposal, or media design. Instructors work closely with the students on the conceptual and technical development of their ideas. The final works are delivered in a multimedia presentation during our closing ceremony."
