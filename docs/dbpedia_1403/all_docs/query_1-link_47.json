        "text": "Play is one of the most important tools for children in their development as it allows them to explore the world they live in. Through play, children learn and practice new skills, and can socialize, have fun, and relieve stress. At SickKids, we provide unique opportunities for children, youth and their families to play in a safe environment away from their units and clinics, and experience normalcy while at the hospital. We have a variety of family spaces, each designed to create an atmosphere that is welcoming, healing, safe, and fun!\n\nThese spaces share a commitment to offer unique, developmentally appropriate, play-based programming and activities that help patients and families cope by providing distraction and an outlet for their anxiety and other challenging feelings. Giving children the choice to choose an activity or game can help them gain a sense of control. Read more about each of these spaces below and be sure to check out our weekly activity calendar for up-to-date information.\n\nView more information on Family Spaces and Family Programs.\n\nMarnie's Lounge\n\nMarnie's Lounge is a drop-in activity space at SickKids that provides therapeutic programming for inpatients, outpatients and their families. Visitors can engage in expressive art activities, board games, video and arcade games, and spend time together in Marnie’s Nook.

The room is staffed by Child Life Professionals trained in paediatric psychosocial care and child and youth development.\n\nSamsung Space is currently closed due to elevator maintenance.

The 1,725 square-foot Family Room was designed with input from SickKids staff and families.
