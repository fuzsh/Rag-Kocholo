The bus has Ethernet capability.\n\nEach station will have one RFID read/write head.\n\nThe issue comes when I try to add them to the IO tree:\n\nThe RFID bus is what connects to the switch in the control panel and the switch is on our local network.\n\nAdding the bus to the first processor's IO tree was not a problem. It was communicating as intended. I could read and write with the head.\n\nWhen I tried to add the bus to the second processor's IO tree, I was met with error code 16#031b: Rack Connection Refused.\n\nSince each head had its own channel and associated tags in the EDS file, I assumed that I would be able to use a channel for each press.\n\nAm I wrong for thinking this?\n\nAnyone else run into this issue before?\n\nAny help would be greatly appreciated,\n\nThanks!"
