        "text": "The Bachelor of Fine Arts (B.F.A) in Studio Art is a professional studio degree that fosters the development of studio artists and creative thinkers. Students take courses in Foundations, Art History and Studio that include topics ranging from historical through contemporary issues in art, technical demonstrations, and rigorous critiques of student work. Visiting artists, field trips, exhibitions, collaborative projects and community engagement are also important aspects of the program.\n\nThe B.F.A. in Studio Art is comprised of the following areas of concentration: Ceramics, Digital Art + Technology, Painting + Drawing, Photography + Integrated Media, Printmaking, Digital Art + Technology, and Sculpture + Expanded Practice. Students select one of these concentrations to focus on in their last two years of study; however, they are not limited to working in any one specific medium. The program embraces traditional, innovative and cross-disciplinary modes of artmaking, allowing students to pursue and produce research that motivates them. Each student is assigned an advisor within their selected area of concentration and has regular contact with all faculty in that area. Students easily develop community among their peers through regular use of the studio facilities and extra-curricular activities.\n\nIn contrast with a B.A. in Studio Art, the B.F.A. in Studio Art program places stronger emphasis on the development of a body of work that culminates in a thesis exhibition just prior to graduation. During the final year of study, students enroll in four courses that center specifically on the development and final preparation of this exhibition.\n\nScholarships are available for both incoming and continuing students through talent awards, Dean's Scholarships, and Endowed Awards that recognize artistic ability, academic excellence, exemplary leadership and potential. Our students have also been successful in writing grants and receiving awards through the University.\n\nFreshman/First-Year Admission\n\nAll incoming first year students who wish to pursue a degree in Art +Design are encouraged to submit a portfolio for talent scholarship consideration. Students who wish to pursue a BFA degree in Studio Art, Interior Architecture or Graphic Design should submit a portfolio at the time of application. All students will have the opportunity to submit an updated portfolio for program and concentration application during the fall and spring semesters.\n\nChange of Program Policy\n\nCurrent Ohio University Undergraduate students wish to begin pursuing a degree in the School of Art+ Design should complete the application to the BFA programs offered in Fall and Spring. Students who are unsure of BFA concentration can elect to begin their studies through the BA in Studio Art and apply to a concentration the following term. Students who elect to pursue the BA in Studio Art may update their program plan without a portfolio review.\n\nExternal Transfer Admission\n\nAll incoming transfer students who wish to pursue a degree in Art +Design are encouraged to submit a portfolio for talent scholarship consideration. Students who wish to pursue a BFA degree in Studio Art, Interior Architecture or Graphic Design should submit a portfolio at the time of application. All students will have the opportunity to submit an updated portfolio for program and concentration application during the fall and spring semesters."
