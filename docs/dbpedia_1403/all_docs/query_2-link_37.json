Viewing and editing exams and printing reports are available from any connected computer. Included are user configurations and security rights levels allowing the administrator to restrict a number of features, such as, editing and/or removing information.\n\nPractice friendly\n\nMedmont Studio integrates with many Practice Management Systems so you can connect existing patient records and refraction data in Medmont Studio. A DICOM interface is not necessary for device connection, but Medmont Studio is DICOM enabled.\n\nUser friendly\n\nWhether you’re technically inclined or not, Medmont Studio provides logical navigational steps to assist in your workflow. The easy-to-understand icon-based user interface provides simple operation and data insights. The wizard assistant guides you while applying evaluation applications.
