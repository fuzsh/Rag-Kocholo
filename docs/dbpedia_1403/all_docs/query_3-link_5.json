These include on-demand video libraries, complete community platforms where members can connect, and even mobile and smart TV apps that make it possible for your community to stream your content on their favorite platforms — more on this later.\n\nThe best live streaming platforms at a glance\n\nHow to choose a live streaming platform\n\nBefore we dive into each streaming platform, let’s zero in on how to pick the best live streaming platform to match your goals and business needs.\n\nFirst up, deciding whether to stream on a popular social media platform or opt for a dedicated streaming service.\n\nThink of it as choosing between a Swiss Army knife and a specialized tool. Platforms like YouTube Live, Facebook Live, and Twitch are your Swiss Army knife: versatile, easy access to large audiences, engaging social features, and straightforward monetization. However, they come with strict content guidelines and limited customization.\n\nIn contrast, specialized live streaming services may reach smaller audiences but give you greater control over your brand and monetization options.\n\nSo, what’s your priority: reaching the most viewers or monetizing an existing audience through a dedicated platform?\n\nThis article will focus on guiding you through the top dedicated live streaming platforms. By the end, you’ll understand what to consider when choosing a live streaming platform, and whether it is the right fit for your business.\n\nKey considerations for choosing the best live streaming platform\n\nMonetization: Dive into how you can make money with each live streaming platform. Are we talking subscriptions, pay-per-view, or maybe some cool sponsorships? Check out how they split the revenue with you—it could really make a difference to your bottom line!\n\nCustomization and branding: Pick a live streaming platform that lets you spice up your stream’s look and feel, and even embed it on your own website. Keeping your branding consistent helps you look pro.\n\nAudience engagement tools: Go for platforms that support fun ways to interact, like lively chats, engaging polls, Q&A sessions, and playful games. This builds your community and keeps your fans hooked and coming back for more.\n\nIntegration and compatibility: Make sure the live streaming platform easily connects with your existing tech and social media. Smooth cross-posting and hassle-free streaming are a must for a slick operation.\n\nAnalytics and performance tracking: Opt for platforms that let you deep-dive into analytics. Knowing who’s tuning in, from where, and what grabs them helps you tailor your content perfectly.\n\nReliability and support: Check out the platform’s reliability and the customer support on offer. Good tech support can be a game-changer for smoothing out those inevitable live stream snags.\n\nArmed with this guide, you’re all set to pick a live streaming platform that checks all your boxes for tech, community vibes, and content mastery.\n\nNow, let’s take a closer look at the top contenders and see what they bring to the table!\n\nWhy YouTube Live, Facebook Live, and Twitch aren’t a good idea for video live-streaming content creators\n\nMost video content creators start out streaming on social media platforms. It’s easy, accessible, and you’re likely to find your audience.\n\nBut relying on social media platforms to build and grow your community and video content business isn’t a smart idea. As a creator, you’re positioned for less success than you might know and here are 8 reasons why:\n\nYou can’t beat the algorithm: It’s an ongoing challenge that all creators face. Algorithms change rapidly, and the hacks and techniques that may have ranked your content today aren’t guaranteed to work tomorrow. When you own your live streaming platform, you’re no longer at the mercy of algorithmic updates. Your community gets to tune into your content directly.\n\nRetention for the platform, not your brand: Retaining viewers on social media platforms is more about keeping them on the platform than keeping them coming back to your channel. Subscribers can opt-in for notifications, but social media platforms don’t provide critical information that all businesses need to grow today: customer information. You don’t get email addresses, contact numbers, or know who your customers are. This means you can’t promote your content, memberships, or anything else. You’re hands are tied behind your back until your content is ranked in your audience’s feed.\n\nLimited branding: Beyond cover and profile images, you can’t create an immersive brand experience for your audience on most platforms.\n\nFake accounts: Anyone can create a fake account on social media. Worse yet, they can impersonate your brand and extort your audience there’s little to no protection against it.\n\nMaking money is harder: Social media platforms are not built to monetize audiences as easily as live streaming software can through shoppable videos, gated content, and more. You can add links to posts and comments, but those can easily be scrolled passed as your audience gets distracted by other content.\n\nPrivacy is an issue: Social media platforms are synonymous with privacy concerns. While you may have access to a potentially large audience, it can shrink. People who want to maintain their privacy often leave social platforms as a sign of protest, decreasing the size of your potential captive audience.\n\nUnlimited distractions: Meta sees one billion stories shared across its platforms each day. As a live streaming promoting your content, you’re fighting for attention with a large pool of distractions all competing for your audience’s attention.\n\nThe best 7 live streaming platforms\n\nUscreen\n\nBest for: Video content creators looking to scale their membership businesses efficiently.\n\nG2 rating: ⭐️ 4.8 out of 5\n\nReasons to use Uscreen for live streaming:\n\nUscreen is a solid choice if you’re looking to boost your video content game, especially when it comes to building up a membership model.

Uscreen is the platform that will set your digital presence apart from anyone who does what you do. Top notch multimedia, thread and subthread, communities.

It offers straightforward tools for monetization and engagement without needing deep tech skills.\n\nBeyond just live streaming, Uscreen offers a suite of features that greatly enhance a content creator’s toolkit. From distributing content through branded mobile and TV apps to fostering community interaction and enabling in-app purchases, Uscreen simplifies content monetization and audience engagement.\n\nHowever, if you’re budget-conscious, need high customization, or looking to stream gaming or host big live events, Uscreen might feel limited. It’s also not ideal if you like integrating many apps and tools, where a more specialized platform could better serve your needs.\n\nUscreen pricing\n\nUscreen pricing comes in 3 plans:\n\nGrowth: $149 per month + $1.99 per paid member, per month. Best for creators focused on growing a small video membership online.\n\nPro: $499 per month + $0.99 per paid member, per month.

If you’re aiming for ultra-high-definition streams beyond 1080p, need some hefty video editing tools built right in, or need to upload larger file sizes or quantities, Restream might feel a bit restrictive.\n\nAlso, it’s worth noting that some of the coolest perks, like streaming pre-recorded videos and ditching the standard Restream branding, are only available on the pricier plans. So if you’re watching your wallet, you might need to weigh whether these features are worth the extra dough.\n\nRestream pricing\n\nFree plan: Stream up to 2 channels with access to up to 30+ channels.\n\nStandard plan ($19 / month): Stream up to 5 channels.\n\nProfessional plan ($49 / month): Stream up to 8 channels.\n\nPremium plan ($99 / month): Stream up to 15 channels.\n\nVimeo Livestream\n\nBest for: professional content creators needing high-quality, monetizable, large-scale live events.\n\nG2 rating: ⭐️ 4.3 out of 5\n\nReasons to use Vimeo Livestream for live streaming:\n\nIf you’re aiming for a professional-level live stream, Vimeo Livestream is a top choice.

Vimeo Livestream could be just the ticket with its high-quality streaming and robust feature set.\n\nHowever, it’s not all roses; if your needs stretch to deep customization, ultra-detailed analytics, broad marketing integrations, or reaching viewers in tightly regulated regions like China, you might come across some limitations.\n\nAlso, its steeper price and somewhat limited monetization options might not sit well if you’re tight on budget or looking for more creative ways to make money. Before you jump in, really think about your specific streaming needs and financial leeway to see if Vimeo Livestream aligns with your goals.\n\nVimeo Livestream pricing\n\nVimeo’s live streaming capabilities kick in with their Advanced plan, which starts at $65 per month.\n\nFor their Enterprise plan, which also includes live streaming, you’ll need to contact their team directly for details.\n\nBrightcove\n\nBest for: large-scale businesses and media houses that need a robust, high-quality live streaming solution.\n\nG2 rating: ⭐️ 4.0 out of 5\n\nReasons to use Brightcove for live streaming:\n\nIf you’re looking to boost your live video streaming, Brightcove is a solid choice with its high-quality, global broadcasting capabilities.

It’s packed with solid monetization options, extensive customization capabilities, and powerful analytics, all designed to support high-level operations.\n\nHowever, it might be a bit much for the little guys.

Verified user.\n\nPros of using Dacast\n\n✅ Integrated paywall: Seamlessly monetize content with subscriptions, pay-per-view, and advertisements directly through Dacast’s built-in paywall.\n\n✅ Top-tier CDN usage: Utilizes Akamai, ensuring high-quality streaming with excellent global reach, including distinctive access to the challenging market of China.\n\n✅ White-label service on all plans: Complete control over branding across the video player, maintaining a consistent brand identity across all broadcasts.\n\n✅ Extensive API access: Provides robust API capabilities for extensive customization and integration, perfect for technical users.\n\n✅ Real-time analytics and Zoom integration: Offers instant data on viewer engagement and smooth integration with Zoom for easy hosting of webinars and large meetings.\n\nCons of using Dacast\n\n❌ Steep learning curve: The platform’s depth of features may require a significant learning period for new users or those with limited technical resources.\n\n❌ Social media streaming limitations: Does not support direct streaming to social media platforms; requires third-party services for simulcasting.\n\n❌ No ultra low latency: Lacks support for ultra low-latency streaming, which can be critical for real-time interactive content like gaming or live auctions.\n\n❌ No DRM technology: While providing basic security features, Dacast does not offer Digital Rights Management (DRM), potentially a drawback for securing high-value content.\n\n❌ Bandwidth and storage limits: Certain plans have strict bandwidth and storage limits, which could lead to additional costs or constraints for users with high streaming demands.\n\nCons: The bandwidth and storage entitlements (and cost associated with overages/extras) required us to limit our use of the platform to live streaming.

Verified user.\n\nIs Dacast for you?\n\nDacast is a top pick for professional content creators and businesses looking for a feature-packed streaming platform that delivers big on global reach, diverse monetization options, and tight security.
