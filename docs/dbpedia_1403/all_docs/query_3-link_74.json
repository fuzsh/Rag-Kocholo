        "text": "Remember when Netflix was just a mail-order DVD service? Now that VOD platforms all but rule the world, every big entertainment brand is striving for its shot at streaming stardom. With new apps and services landing regularly, it can be hard to tell what platforms to pay attention to. But heed our words, friends: trust in YouTube TV.\n\nSimilar to Hulu With Live TV, Sling TV, FuboTV, and DirecTV Stream, YouTube TV offers linear and on-demand YouTube movies and shows. There are several other perks to enjoy too, and we’ve broken everything down in this complete guide to YouTube TV.\n\nRecommended Videos\n\nYouTube TV is also one of the only options if you want to stream any sort of live TV in 4K resolution. More on that in a minute, along with other YouTube TV tips and tricks. And yes, YouTube TV now is home to NFL Sunday Ticket. That’s a big deal.\n\nWhat is YouTube TV?\n\nIn a nutshell, YouTube TV is a live TV streaming service that’s available in the United States. It’s a replacement for a cable or satellite service that’s streamed through the Internet, available on phones, tablets, TV, and web browsers, and it lets you watch TV pretty much as you always have, from anywhere you have an internet connection, at home or on the go.\n\nYouTube TV was restricted to a relatively small number of locations in the United States when it launched in 2017. That changed in 2019 when a large expansion introduced support for all 210 markets. It has also greatly expanded its collection of channels over the years. YouTube TV now boasts more than 110 channels, including the four major national broadcasters — ABC, NBC, CBS, and Fox. (Like all streaming services, what’s actually available where you live may vary a tad, so you’ll need to check your ZIP code.)\n\nThe line between YouTube TV and YouTube proper remains fairly distinct. You’ll see a bit of the same branding, which makes sense. And YouTube TV is a subdomain of YouTube itself. But you’re not yet seeing things like recommended YouTubers or YouTube Shorts living alongside the likes of ESPN and CNN.\n\nYou may, however, find recommendations for movies and shows available to rent or purchase through YouTube itself. Like we said, the lines are there, but blurring more all the time.\n\nIts biggest competition comes in deciding between YouTube TV and Hulu With Live TV.\n\nYouTube TV price and add-ons\n\nYouTube TV costs $73 a month (plus tax, which takes things up closer to $77 a month).\n\nThat’s not to say that’s all you’ll ever pay for YouTube TV, however. It has a number of optional add-ons that give you more shows and movies and sports to watch — but of course, you’ll pay extra. A big one is an ability to watch some shows and sports in 4K on YouTube TV.\n\nAnd there’s now a separate Spanish-only plan (conveniently called the “Spanish Plan”) that’s available for $25 a month for the first six months, and $35 a month after that. It includes beIN ñ, beIN Xtra en Español, Antena 3, NTN 24, Nuestra Tele, TyC Sports, Discovery en Espanol, Discovery Familia, Baby TV Espanol, ESPN Deportes, Nat Geo Mundo, Estrella TV, Fox Deportes, Cine Latino, Pasiones, WAPA América, Cine Mexicano, Sony Cine, Tastemade, CNN Espanol, Bandamax, De Pelicula, De Pelicula Classico, FOROtv, Telehit, Telehit Urbano, and Tlnovelas.\n\nHere are the optional add-ons available with YouTube TV:\n\n4K Plus ($5 a month for the first 12 months; $10 after): First made available in June 2021, 4K Plus allows you to watch some content on YouTube TV in 4K resolution. Mostly that means shows and series in on-demand form — things like What We Do In The Shadows, Struggle Meals, American Titans, Snowfall, and more. But where it really starts to shine is with live sports from networks like ESPN, Fox Sports, and NBC Sports. Also, 4K Plus adds offline viewing of recorded shows, plus the ability to watch on as many devices as you want at once on your home network.\n\nSpanish Plus ($10 for first six months; $15 after): Additional Spanish-language channels, including Antena 3, Baby TV Español, Bandamax, beIN Sports Español, beIN XTRA en Español, Cine Latino, Cine Mexicano, CNNe, De Película, De Película Clásico, Discovery en Español, Discovery Familia, ESPN Deportes, EstrellaTV, FOROtv, Fox Deportes, Nat Geo Mundo, NTN 24, Nuestra Tele, Pasiones, SonyCine, Tastemade en Español, Telehit, Telehit Música, Tlnovelas, TyC Sports, Universo, and WAPA.\n\nHBO Max ($13 a month): New HBO Max Originals and included networks, plus all the legacy HBO content you know and love.\n\nHBO ($16 a month): HBO, minus all the Max stuff.\n\nNBA League Pass ($15 a month, or $50 a year): Comes with a seven-day free trial.\n\nSports Plus ($11 a month, or $80 annually): Includes NFL RedZone, BeIN Sports, Fox Soccer Plus, VSiN, Outside TV+, PokerGO+, MAVTV, FanDuel TV, Stadium, Billiard TV, SportsGrid, PlayersTV, Fight Network, IMPACT Wrestling. Comes with a seven-day free trial.\n\nEntertainment Plus ($30 a month): Includes HBO Max, Showtime, and STARZ.\n\nShowtime ($11 a month): Premium movies and series. Comes with a seven-day free trial.\n\nStarz ($9 a month): Premium movies and series.\n\nHallmark Movies Now ($6 a month): All the movies and series you love from Hallmark. Comes with a seven-day free trial.\n\nCinemax ($10 a month): Premium movies and series. Comes with a seven-day free trial.\n\nMGM+ ($6 a month): All the best from the legendary studio.\n\nSTARZ + MGM+ ($12 a month): A bundle of the two services.\n\nCuriosityStream ($3 a month): Science-type shows. Comes with a 14-day free trial.\n\nViX+ ($7 a month): Spanish-language content from TelevisaUnivision.\n\nFox Nation ($6 a month): The streaming service from Fox News.\n\nScreenPix ($3 a month): Classic movies from EPIX.\n\nAMC+ ($8 a month): Additional streaming-only content from AMC.\n\nShudder ($6 a month): New and classic horror.\n\nSundance Now ($7 a month): The streaming arm of Sundance Channel.\n\nHere TV ($8 a month): LGBTQ movies and series.\n\nAcorn TV ($7 a month): British hits.\n\nIFC Films Unlimited ($6 a month): The best of indie films.\n\nALLBLK ($6 a month): Inclusively but unapologetically Black content.\n\nDocurama ($5 a month): All the documentaries you could want.\n\nCONtv ($5 a month): Movies, shows, and Comic-Con panels.\n\nDove ($5 a month): Christian movies and shows.\n\nLaw & Crime ($2 a month): Live trials and other courtroom news.\n\nUP Faith & Family ($6 a month): TV shows and movies that are safe for your family and affirm your faith.\n\nFandor ($4 a month): The home for cinephiles.\n\nScreambox ($5 a month): Pure horror.\n\nComedy Dynamics ($5 a month): Independent comedy from the Nacelle company.\n\nVSiN ($4 a month): Sports betting network.\n\nOutside TV Features ($2 a month): Full-length adventure sports films.\n\nThe Great Courses ($8 a month): Learn all the things about all the things.\n\nMovieSphere ($5 a month): Lionsgate hits, cult classics and everything in-between.\n\nMyOutDoorTV ($10 a month): Exclusive series, live events, and more on all things hunting and fishing.\n\nTastemade+ ($3 a month): Even more award-winning food, travel, home design, and more.\n\nPokerGO ($15 a month): Exclusive live poker tournaments.\n\nDekkoo ($10 a month): Gay movies and series.\n\nMagellan TV ($6 a month): Documentaries worth watching.\n\nMagnolia Selects ($5 a month): Films and series from Magnolia Pictures.\n\nATRESplayer ($5 a month): Spanish-language on-demand video from Atresmedia.\n\nGaia ($12 a month): Conscious media, streaming yoga videos, and more.\n\nClassica ($7 a month): All things classical music, jazz, opera and ballet, from Stingray.\n\nTopic ($6 a month): Criminally good TV and film from all over the world.\n\nQuello Concerts ($8 a month): Live music and concerts.\n\nHopster Learning ($5 a month): Making screentime smart for preschoolers.\n\nHi-YAH! ($4 a month): If you love martial arts, you’ll love this.\n\nMHz Choice ($8 a month): The best new international mysteries, dramas, and comedies.\n\nRCN Total ($5 a month): Premiere movies and more.\n\nYouTube TV channels\n\nGenerally speaking, YouTube TV has as competitive a slate of channels — both linear and nonlinear (that is, something other than what you might find on traditional cable TV) — as any of the other comparable offerings. That mostly means Hulu With Live TV, which is the only other streaming service with approximately as many subscribers as YouTube TV.\n\nThe devil, as always, is in the details. If YouTube TV has the channel you want, great! If it doesn’t, you’re going to have to look elsewhere. And that’s OK — it’s how competition works.\n\nHere are the channels you can watch as part of the main YouTube TV plan, as of May 2024:\n\nABC, ABC News Live, ACC Network, AMC, Animal Planet, BBC America, BBC World News, BET, BET Her, Bounce, Bravo, BTN, Cartoon Network, CBS, CBS Sports, Charge!, Cheddar News, CMT, CNBC, CNN, Comedy Central, Comedy.TV, Comet TV, Court TV, Cozi, Dabl, Discovery Channel, Disney Channel, Disney Junior, Disney XD, E!, ESPN, ESPN in 4K, ESPN2, ESPNews, ESPNU, Food Network, Fox, Fox Business, Fox News, Fox Soul, Fox Sports 4K, Fox Sports Plus 4K, Fox Weather, Freeform, FS1, FS2, FX, FXM, FXX, Galavision, Game Show Network, GetTV, Golf Channel, Hallmark Channel, Hallmark Drama, Hallmark Movies & Mysteries, HGTV, HLN, HSN, ID, IFC, ION, JusticeCentral.TV, LiveNOW, Local Now, Magnolia Network, MotorTrend, MSNBC, MTV, MTV Classic, MTV2, Nat Ceo, Nat Geo Wild, NBA TV, NBA TV in 4K, NBC, NBC News Now, NBC Sports 4K, NBCLX, NewsNation, NFL Network ,Nick Jr., Nickelodeon, Nicktoons, OWN, Oxygen True Crime, Paramount, PBS, PBS Kids, Pop, QVC, Recipe.TV, Scripps News, SEC Network, Smithsonian Channel, Start TV, Sundance TV, SYFY, T2, Tastemade, TBD TV, TBS, TeenNick, Telemundo, The CW, The Weather Channel, TLC, TNT, Travel Channel, truTV, TUDN, Turner Classic Movies, TV Land, TYT Network, UniMas, Universal Kids, Univision, USA, VH1, WE tv.\n\nAnd one of the cooler features here is that you can hide a channel on YouTube TV if you want. That’ll help keep your guide free of channels you never watch.\n\nAnd note that your local broadcast channels should be included in the above listings.\n\nYouTube TV and 4K\n\nOne of the coolest things about YouTube TV is that it’s one of the easiest streaming services to use. And it should be, given that it’s from the folks who also run the largest streaming video service on the face of the planet. (That’d be YouTube.)\n\nYou’ve got control over all sorts of things — including the streaming resolution. While 99% of the time you’re going to want to leave things on Auto, you also can downshift the streaming resolution if you want. That also makes it easy to see what’s streaming in 720p, or 1080p. A lot of the time it’s going to be the former, especially if it’s live sports at 60 frames per second. But we’re seeing more and more 1080p video, which is good.\n\nYou also can watch YouTube TV in 4K. Sometimes.\n\nYouTube TV is one of the only first live streaming services in the United States to offer some live content in 4K resolution. (The other is FuboTV.) On the live end of things, you’ll find events from ESPN, Fox Sports, and NBC Sports. There’s also a little bit of on-demand fare available in 4K resolution, too. You’ll find 4K streams from Discovery, FX, Nat Geo, and Tastemade.\n\nAll in all, YouTube TV’s video is pretty comparable to other live services. You might get a lower resolution for a few seconds before the buffer fills out and hits max capacity. And it all depends on the strength of your home network, and the speed of your ISP, in addition to the way YouTube TV and its content providers are offering the show or movie or sport in the first place. There are a lot of moving parts here. It’s also important to note that 4K streaming isn’t available on every single piece of hardware. But to date, you’ll be able to get it on Chromecast with Google TV, 4K-capable Roku devices, the 2021 model of Apple TV 4K (the 2017 model will see improved resolution, but not the full 4K), Amazon Fire TV Stick 4K, NVIDIA Shield, and 4K Android TV smart TVs.\n\nYouTube TV and NFL Sunday Ticket\n\nStarting with the 2023-24 season, YouTube TV (as well as YouTube proper) became home to NFL Sunday Ticket. It’s an optional subscription that gets you access to all out-of-market games, so you don’t have to resort to … other means … to watch.\n\nSunday Ticket isn’t an inexpensive add-on, and that’s by design. The NFL doesn’t want to undercut the broadcast rights by giving you every game for a pittance. So you’re going to pay a few hundred dollars each season. The good news? There is an option to pay over four months, which makes things a little easier. And you can expect discounts if you wait till half the season has gone by.\n\nYou’ll also pay a little more or less depending on whether you subscribe via YouTube proper, or through YouTube TV. The latter already has a monthly fee, of course, and you’ll get a little shaved off your NFL Sunday Ticket subscription.\n\nThere’s also an option for NFL RedZone — basically a live, in-game highlight channel for scoring opportunities. And that’ll add on a couple bucks to your bill.\n\nYouTube TV and multiview\n\nYouTube TV didn’t invent multiview, but it’s made good use of it. The name is fairly self-explanatory. Multiview allows you to watch multiple things at one time. And within YouTube TV, that means sports, news, business, or weather. (Yes, you can watch multiple weather channels at the same time. It’s incredible.)\n\nAnd multiview even — or especially — works with premium sports subscriptions like NFL Sunday Ticket or NBA League Pass, which makes those services even better.\n\nThere’s only one major issue with the current implementation of multiview — you don’t get to pick the channels you watch simultaneously. YouTube TV picks them for you. The good news is it looks like YouTube TV is working on fixing that.\n\nWhat can you watch YouTube TV on?\n\nThe short answer here is that if you’ve got a relatively modern phone, tablet, TV, or computer, there’s a better than even chance that you’ll be able to use it to watch YouTube TV.\n\nMobile is easy — YouTube TV is available on Android (so long as it’s got access to Google’s apps), as well as on iPhones. That extends to tablets, too.\n\nAs more and more smart televisions employ their own operating systems and apps, YouTube TV has kept up with its availability. Native apps are available on TVs from Samsung, LG, Vizio, Hisense, Sharp, and Sony. (And that includes anything that’s using Android TV as the operating system.)\n\nStreaming media players are supported as well, and YouTube TV covers the gamut. It’s available on Roku and Amazon Fire TV, which takes care of the two most popular options in the world. YouTube TV also is available on Chromecast with Google TV and other legacy Android TV devices like NVIDIA Shield. Apple TV also is supported.\n\nGame consoles get love from YouTube, with the service available on Xbox One through the newer Xbox Series X and Series S lines. You also can watch YouTube TV natively on PlayStation 4, PS4 Pro, and on the newer PS5.\n\nYou also can watch YouTube TV in a web browser — including Chrome, Firefox, and, finally, Safari.\n\nAnd if you’re all about the connected home, it’s also easy to watch YouTube TV on the Google Nest Hub and Nest Hub Max.\n\nYouTube TV features\n\nThe ability to watch the same TV channels you’ve always watched is the main feature of a streaming service like YouTube TV. But it’s hardly the only one. You’re also able to watch shows and movies on your own time. You’re able to have customized recommendations, which is a lot more fun than channel surfing. And that’s table stakes — YouTube TV is able to harness the power of Google Assistant and do some other crazy stuff.\n\nHere’s a look at some of the best YouTube TV features you’ll definitely want to take advantage of.\n\nUnlimited recordings\n\nOut of all the features baked into YouTube TV, “Cloud DVR” stands out. And not just because it exists — pretty much every service has the capability to “record” a show or movie and allow you to play it back whenever you want. But most of the other services charge an extra fee for their Cloud DVR service, or at least for additional storage.\n\nGoogle, on the other hand, gives unlimited recordings, all for free. So long as you keep your subscription, you keep your recordings for up to nine months. That goes for shows, movies, live sports, and other events. And YouTube TV is smart about it. Most recordings extend one minute past their scheduled end time. Sporting events, by default, record an extra 30 minutes — and YouTube TV can even detect if things are going to run longer and extend things from there.\n\nIt’s also a true recording, meaning that ads are recorded as they were presented live — and that means you can fast-forward right past them if you want.\n\nMultiple users and multiple devices\n\nYouTube TV also is one of the most flexible options you’ll find. By default, you’re able to watch YouTube TV on up to three devices at the same time.\n\nIf you subscribe to the 4K Plus add-on, you’ll also get the benefit of unlimited streams while you’re using your home network.\n\nYouTube TV also allows for up to six user profiles on a single account. That’s important because it affects show and movie recommendations. So you don’t have to see your kids’ recs, and they don’t have to see yours. YouTube TV is tied to your Google account, and the profiles will be available for up to five other family members as designated in your Google account.\n\nOn-demand\n\nMany of the channels included with a YouTube TV subscription let you watch their shows after they initially air, on-demand. It can be a handy way to catch up on older episodes or seasons that aired before you started to record them using the DVR function. The difference between this and DVR is that you won’t be able to skip the commercials.\n\nVoice control\n\nYouTube TV has a cool feature if you own a Google Home speaker, like the Google Nest Mini, and use a Chromecast device to watch YouTube TV: You can use just your voice to control functions like selecting a TV channel to watch live, starting specific shows, recording a show, or using playback functions such as pause, resume, and rewind. Here’s how to set it up.\n\nPicture-in-picture for mobile\n\nOne of the greatest things about mobile video apps is the ability to watch via picture-in-picture. If you’re using an Android or iOS device, you can continue to watch YouTube TV in a minimized window while working on something else in the foreground. It really is a game-changer.\n\nMultiview for sports content\n\nWith the start of the March Madness NCAA games in 2023, YouTube TV introduced a new multiview feature that will let you select up to four sports channels and view them all simultaneously on one TV screen. The feature is currently only for TV-based viewing.\n\nJump\n\nThis feature lets you jump to various segments within select news programs on YouTube TV. Similar to the key plays view for sports, on some programs, you’ll be able to jump to specific news clips within the complete recording. This feature is available on TV apps now and will come to mobile devices soon.\n\nDark mode\n\nDesktop and mobile YouTube TV experiences can choose a darker theme to help with eye strain.\n\nMark as watched\n\nSelect Mark as Watched on desktop and mobile devices for any TV show you’ve already seen.\n\nHow to cancel YouTube TV\n\nYouTube TV, like all other streaming services, is simple to cancel. All you have to do is go to your YouTube TV account on the web, at tv.youtube.com. Go to Settings, then Membership, then Manage, and click Cancel membership.\n\nYour access to YouTube TV won’t be immediately shut off, though. You’ll still get access to YouTube TV on the web and all devices until the end of your billing period. Once you hit that point and the payment doesn’t renew, you’ll lose access to all live TV streaming.\n\nAfter 21 days without payment on the account, you’ll lose all of your recorded programs as well."
