        "text": "Are you an aspiring programmer, or perhaps just interested in learning more about the programming field? Read on to learn more about the hard and soft skills that programmers need to succeed.\n\nTechnology has become the backbone of our everyday lives, and programmers are needed to keep moving that technology forward. The options are endless: an aspiring programmer can bring the next life-changing smartphone app to life, create new worlds in gaming, or craft the way millions of people across the globe interact and communicate online. These are just a few of the ways programmers impact the world around them, but all programmers have certain things in common — the in-demand hard and soft skills that propel their career success.\n\nMany programmers think that data structures and algorithms (DSAs) are just something you have to “get through” in school, but will never need in real life. However, they’re surprised when so many interviews include DSA questions. There are several reasons companies are interested in a prospective employee’s DSA knowledge, and why programmers should be interested in it too.\n\nFor many companies, such as Meta, Google, Microsoft, and Amazon, writing code is just the final step in a long process. The majority of a programmer’s time is actually spent considering the best way to approach a project, including the best data structures and optimal algorithms to employ. These decisions have a real impact on the company’s resource usage and profitability, so it’s no surprise that DSAs figure prominently in their interview process. And, even for companies outside of Silicon Valley, these questions are important because they demonstrate a programmer’s foundational knowledge and problem solving abilities.\n\nOnce a programmer has the position, DSAs still play a role in day-to-day work. Specifically, data structures are a particular way of organizing data so that it can be used most effectively, and there are many to choose from. One of the most commonly used data structures is an array, which holds and indexes items of the same data type such as integers. Additional types of data structures include linked lists, which organize data into linear, sequentially-linked order; and stacks, which allow programmers to access recently placed items first, as if they were picking up the first book in a pile.\n\nAlgorithms, meanwhile, are a set of instructions programmers give to computers to solve a problem, much like the recipe one might give a cook. These step-by-step guidelines can perform a variety of tasks, including searching and sorting data in a way that is ordered and makes sense.\n\nIn addition, many startups, as well as FAANG employers, look for programmers who possess the agility to scale programs and innovate through the use of DSAs.\n\nOne of the basic expectations of any programmer is that they are familiar with core database concepts. This is because data is the fuel companies run on, and it proliferates almost every aspect of every project.\n\nWhile there are many languages used to work with databases, the most common is Structured Query Language (SQL — pronounced “sequel”). Though SQL was developed in the 1980s, it is still the standard language used to communicate with relational databases and is considered critical for modern programmers. In recent years, SQL has been heavily used by PC databases because it facilitates access to distributed databases (e.g., those spread out over multiple computer systems); allowing several local users to access the same network simultaneously. SQL also enables easy storage and organization of data in relational databases (e.g., databases where tables are related to one another through common data).\n\nIf you’re interested in gaining SQL experience, it may be helpful to practice with MySQL. Referred to as a relational database management system (RDMS), this open-source software is based on SQL and many aspiring coders use it to work on developing their own systems, applications, and websites for free.\n\nNoSQL, on the other hand, is a database management system (DBMS) that stores and accesses data using key-values, rather than relationally, which offers some additional flexibility. One example of a NoSQL database is MongoDB, an open-source program which can be used for high-volume document data storage, and deals with document structure variations nicely.\n\nOf course, there are many more systems and software packages to learn when mastering databases, but having a strong foundation in database concepts and SQL is an important first step for all programmers.\n\nOOP languages support a way of programming (sometimes called a paradigm) that relies on classes and objects. Think of classes like groups of similar things, such as fruits, with objects that tell us more about individual items in that class, such as apples. This programming paradigm is important because it allows programmers to easily reuse complex code across programs. For example, if I say “my apple,” it isn’t necessary for me to tell you all the attributes of my apple (i.e., red, round, grew on a tree, belongs to me). Similarly, by using an object (myapple) from a class (fruit), a programmer can easily communicate instructions or information across multiple programs, enabling more effective and efficient coding as a result.\n\nFor this reason, OOP languages such as Java, C++, Python, and Perl are important for programmers, and they need to have at least one in their skill set.\n\nIn addition, such languages as JavaScript and PHP pair well with OOP languages to further enhance efficiencies and functionality.\n\nCombining a variety of developer tools through a single graphic user interface (GUI), IDEs are a workbench for programmers where all the tools they need are laid out and ready for them to use — kind of like a workbench with a saw, drill, nails, and a hammer if you were planning to build a birdhouse.\n\nIDEs are valuable in that by learning one IDE, a developer can become familiar with a variety of tools that work synergistically, rather than learning each tool separately and pulling together the right tools for each coding task. In addition, because all the tools are available through one GUI, the programmer doesn’t have to spend time switching between applications.\n\nIt’s important to note that IDEs are language-specific, meaning that an IDE may be designed to work with one or more programming languages. Here is a quick rundown of some of the more popular IDEs and the languages they work with (listed alphabetically).\n\nCloud computing is experiencing explosive growth, as cloud developers are needed for all businesses who wish to migrate their environments, storage, and digital assets to the cloud. In fact, according to LogicMonitor, 87% of global IT decision makers agree that the COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated cloud migration for most organizations. In addition, once migrated, businesses will need programmers familiar with the technology necessary to work effectively with cloud-native applications. And, as businesses rely more heavily on data science, machine learning, and artificial intelligence, work in the cloud becomes even more important since algorithms and models consume significant resources. The result of these business transitions and needs is that cloud engineers and developers, as well as cloud-savvy programmers, are in high demand.\n\nThe good news is that many of the languages needed for cloud computing are already top languages for programmers, including:\n\nPython\n\nJava\n\nRuby\n\nGo\n\nIn addition, it’s a good idea for programmers to familiarize themselves with cloud platforms, such as:\n\nAmazon Web Services (AWS)\n\nMicrosoft Azure\n\nGoogle Cloud Platform (GCP)\n\nEven focusing on just one, to learn key functionality, will help you gain a better understanding of how the others work, adding value to your skill set.\n\nWith that said, even programmers who don’t plan on working in web development can benefit from understanding the basics. For example, many projects that programmers work on include a web component. With some foundational knowledge of web development concepts, concerns, and constraints, programmers are better able to understand how data will be collected and used, what functionality may be required at a later date, and how enterprise systems may be impacted in the future. Certainly, this knowledge will help programmers have a more comprehensive understanding of not only the best way to develop their own portion of the project, but also how to offer additional solutions to those whose expertise is focused on client-side functionality.\n\nContainers are preconfigured environments that package code and other dependencies an application needs to run, without the need for downloads to a physical computer. Unlike traditional methods where code is developed in a specific computing environment and transferred to a new location resulting in bugs (i.e., virtual machines), containers bundle the application code with related configuration files, libraries, and dependencies which minimizes the potential for bugs. In addition, because the operating system (OS) files are included, containers virtualize the operating system and the application can run anywhere. As a result, programmers are able to develop and deploy applications in a faster and more secure manner.\n\nA basic example of container usage in education is a teacher preparing for their Python programming class. By using a container, they are able to grab the necessary application, libraries, and dependencies (including the OS), making it easier to prepare while ensuring learners will have the necessary access to learn Python from anywhere.\n\nSome of the most popular container management software includes:\n\nDocker\n\nAWS Fargate\n\nGoogle Kubernetes Engine\n\nAmazon ECS\n\nLinux Containers\n\nMicrosoft Azure Container Services\n\n8. Accountability: Many wrongly associate accountability with “blame,” but when used effectively, it is actually something quite different. Accountability begins before a task is assigned or a single line of code is written — it is simply the building of trust between teammates through public discussion of direction, design, and timelines. Specifically, that trust translates into each teammate committing to doing their best work, quickly letting the team know if there is an unanticipated obstacle, and knowing that teammates will work together to address the obstacle in the best way possible. By working transparently and setting collective goals and timelines, accountability is a support — not a sword. Professionals can demonstrate this skill by truly supporting their teammates in a mutual fashion to achieve their overall goals. In fact, the popularity of agile methodology through Scrum project management is an excellent example of the correct application of accountability.\n\nCareer prospects for programmers look bright. According to CareerOneStop, an expected 9,700 U.S. job openings in programming are anticipated each year through 2030 with a median salary of $89,190.\n\nEven better, in the Denver, Colorado, area, programmers can anticipate a median salary of $91,550 and companies such as Meta (formerly Facebook), Intel, Honeywell, Lockheed Martin, and Colorado State University are all actively looking for programmers,\n\nTo take advantage of these great opportunities, you’ll need to acquire the knowledge and skills programmers need to be successful. The good news is that there are several options to choose from — a traditional degree, independent study, or a coding boot camp.\n\nObtaining a degree in computer science is always a popular choice for those interested in pursuing a career in programming. Taking three to four years, these degrees allow learners to explore the theoretical aspects of programming, while pursuing adjacent subject matter and additional interests. Given the significant time and financial commitment required to pursue this type of degree, it’s important to be sure it’s the right path for you. Some learners consider taking an introductory coding course, boot camp, or conducting independent study prior to committing to a degree program.\n\nFor those who lack the time or financial resources required to pursue a traditional degree, or want to explore their options before making a commitment, independent study can be the right choice. Also, many who prefer a slower tempo and self-directed approach pursue independent study of a programming language to enhance their existing skill set. Common options include:\n\nedX\n\nMIT OpenCourseWare\n\nThe Odin Project\n\nInterestingly, many who begin their coding journey in independent study soon progress to enrolling in a coding boot camp. Boot camps are a great place to gain in-demand skills in a practical environment where learners apply their newfound knowledge on real-world projects that will eventually populate their professional portfolios.\n\nRegardless of the educational path you choose, the right combination of in-demand hard and soft skills will fuel your progress toward a rewarding career in programming.\n\nAre you ready to take the next step and gain the in-demand technical skills needed for a successful web development career?
