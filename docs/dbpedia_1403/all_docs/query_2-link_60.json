For example, you could schedule the Work Focus to start at 9 a.m. and end at noon, Monday through Friday. From noon to 1 p.m. you may have no Focus or have a Personal Focus take over. Then, start the Work Focus again from 1 p.m. until 5 p.m., Monday through Thursday.\n\nOpen the Settings app on your Apple Watch.\n\nTap Focus, tap a Focus—Work, for example—then tap “Add new.”\n\nTap the From and To fields and enter the times you want the Focus to begin and end.\n\nScroll down, then choose days when the Focus will be active.\n\nTap in the top-left corner to save the Focus.\n\nRepeat this process to add other events to the Focus."
