        "text": "Moore opened up my professional path. The studios are small and intimate, which allows students and teachers to establish connections. Having teachers who are able to focus on your work and how you can improve was very important to me.\"\n\nMoore’s emphasis on special populations is so valuable and incredibly important, and I knew I wouldn’t be able to get an education remotely similar if I went somewhere else. I valued the freedom and encouragement to study and experience what I felt was important to me. Before I was even done with my student teaching, I was offered a job at a K–12 special populations school. My education at Moore set me up for that success.”\n\nI feel very comfortable using the programs we learned. I especially appreciated the way assignments built on themselves, so that we revisited skills learned in previous classes. I feel confident that I will retain everything because of that.”\n\nMy favorite part of SADI was the sense of community and respect everyone was able to develop. It was cool to watch people make friends, grow into their own, get more comfortable with themselves.”"
