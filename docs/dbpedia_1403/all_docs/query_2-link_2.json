        "text": "While it was true in 2003 (the last time I taught this course) that the AOL IM protocol was open and accessible, AOL has dropped TOC and moved to TOC2. The differences are almost negligible, but many elements of TOC2 are documented without much explanation. They have apparently been reverse engineered and are therefore not so well explained.\n\nFor example, why is the -kentucky string present in the signon message? I tried using -missouri but then the server would not talk with me.\n\nIt also appears that AOL has been discouraging of its competitors connections with its IM server.\n\nHowever, AOL appears somewhat supportive of noncompetitive, open-source clients, so we consider ourselves as such.\n\nI had thought that AOL had been forced to make its protocol public when Time Warner acquiared AOL, but that is either urban legend or no longer the case."
