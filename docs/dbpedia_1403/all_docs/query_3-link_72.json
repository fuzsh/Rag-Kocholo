        "text": "Programmatic advertising is witnessing an impressive growth rate in recent times with global ad spending approachingÂ 557.56Â billion U.S. dollars.Â\n\nIf you're looking to invest in programmatic advertising or optimize your efforts, the first thing on your mind would be to determine the best platform to partner with.Â\n\nThis guide explores 12 of the best programmatic advertising platforms that can help your business achieve marketing success in 2024 and beyond. We'll compare platforms based on several criteria, including pricing, ad inventory quality, audience targeting, and anti-fraud/safety measures.\n\nWhat Is Programmatic Advertising?\n\nHow Programmatic Advertising Works\n\nHere's a great scheme by Publift that sums up how programmatic advertising works:\n\nWhen a user lands on a website with programmatic ad placements, the website sends the visitor's data to an ad exchange.\n\nThe ad exchange evaluates the user's data, including browsing behavior and demographic details. This data is then presented to advertisers in real time, and an auction begins.\n\nAdvertisers, using demand-side platforms (DSPs), review this information and determine the value of displaying their ad to this particular user. They then place a bid based on this evaluation.\n\nOnce the bidding is completed, the ad exchange chooses the highest bid and grants the winning advertiser the ad space.\n\nAlmost instantaneously, the chosen ad loads onto the user's webpage, ideally aligning with the user's interests and behaviors.\n\nAfter the ad is displayed, feedback metrics such as clicks, impressions, and conversions are collected. This data helps advertisers refine their future bidding strategies and targeting criteria.\n\nThe Challenges of Programmatic Advertising\n\nWhile programmatic advertising offers numerous benefits, it also poses substantial challenges. Marketers often face issues with data integration, campaign tracking, and reporting. Here, weâll explore these challenges in more detail and discuss potential solutions.\n\nInconsistent Taxonomy of Marketing Campaigns\n\nOne of the biggest challenges in programmatic advertising is the inconsistent taxonomy of programmatic campaigns. Campaigns can have different naming conventions and UTM structures, making it hard to accurately measure the effectiveness of marketing efforts, optimize campaigns, allocate budgets effectively, and make data-driven decisions.\n\nA solution to this challenge would be the integration of an automated campaign data management solution like Marketing Data Governance.Â\n\nMarketing Data Governance is an AI-powered platform that monitors adherence to campaign, operational, and business guidelines and alerts you to any issues and anomalies. For instance, Marketing Data Governance validates naming conventions, UTM markup, targeting, frequency cap and other campaign settings.Â\n\nAll rules are set with natural-language input, plain English, and nothing else.\n\nDifficulties Pulling Data from Numerous Ad Accounts\n\nItâs common for marketers to run programmatic campaigns across multiple ad accounts and platforms, each with its own unique data format and API. This makes data collection and consolidation challenging.\n\nAs a result, marketers spend up to 30% of their time manually pulling data from multiple ad accounts, which can be a tedious and error-prone process. Moreover, it leads to delays in data processing and reporting, making it difficult to spot important trends and timely optimize campaigns.\n\nLack of Cross-Channel Performance Visibility\n\nThe inability to analyze both organic and paid performance in a single view is a strong disadvantage of programmatic advertising platforms. Usually, teams are limited to the platformâs native analytics tools that donât take data from other channels into consideration. Thatâs why marketers have to manually aggregate data from organic and paid channels to get the complete picture of the customer journey.\n\nMarketing analytics platforms are invaluable for teams that need to track the performance of their efforts across different channels. Improvado, for example, helps teams automate data collection across channels and provides ready-made dashboard templates for cross-channel analysis.\n\nTop Programmatic Platforms by Category\n\nProgrammatic advertising relies on four categories of platforms to function: Demand-Side Platforms (DSPs), Supply-Side Platforms (SSPs), Ad Exchanges, and Data Management Platforms (DMPs).\n\nAdvertisers make use of DSPs to bid for digital ad space, while publishers make use of SSPs for selling their ad spaces.Â\n\nAn ad exchange serves as a marketplace for connecting advertisers and publishers through their respective platforms. A DMP collects all kinds of data related to an advertiser's ideal customer.\n\nNow, letâs explore some of the best programmatic ad platforms in each category.\n\nDemand-Side Platforms (DSPs)\n\nA DSP allows advertisers to bid for ad impressions on publisher websites. It also enables advertisers to filter their target audience based on specific criteria like location, age, past online behavior, gender, and more.\n\nHere are some of the most popular programmatic DSPs:\n\nAdobe Advertising Cloud DSP\n\nAdobe Advertising Cloud DSP prides itself as âthe only omnichannel programmatic DSP that supports connected TV, video, display, native, audio, and search campaigns.â\n\nMentioned as a leader in the Gartner Magic Quadrant for Ad Tech, Adobe provides features that help advertisers launch, manage, and optimize campaigns. This includes inventory management, personalized marketing, search management, and more.\n\nPricing:Â Custom. Pricing depends on different factors like company size, requirements, and the number of tools purchased\n\nSupported Ad Inventory:Â Display, video, audio, mobile apps, Digital out of Home (DOOH), TV, native, and social\n\nAudience Targeting:Â Audience segment, device type, location, browser, and more\n\nAnti-fraud/Safety Measures: Offers page screening for detecting faulty inventory and pre-bid filtering for detecting fraud, suboptimal viewability, and brand violation.\n\nMediaMath\n\nLaunched in 2007, MediaMath is one of the best programmatic advertising platforms (DSPs) in the industry. Today, it partners with over 3,500 advertisers to help them run omnichannel campaigns across mobile, display, OTT, native, video, audio, and more.\n\nIts SOURCE ecosystem is designed to help advertisers achieve better supply-path optimization and algorithm decision. MediaMath is also recognized as a leader in the Gartner Magic Quadrant for Ad Tech.\n\nPrice:Â Custom\n\nSupported Ad Inventory:Â Connected TV, display, mobile, video, audio, native, and DOOHÂ\n\nAudience Targeting:Â Audience segment, contextual, first-party data, site list, location, daypart, technology, video, and audio.\n\nAnti-fraud/Safety Measures:Â Uses its SOURCE ecosystem to ensure supply-chain trust through pre-bid IVT protection and onboarding tools.\n\nAdRoll\n\nAdRoll is known for its simplicity and the quality of its ad templates. The platform focuses on helping brands expand their reach through video, social ads, display, native, email, and more.\n\nRecognized as a leader in the Gartner Magic Quadrant for Ad Tech, AdRoll uses a broad spectrum of data to determine where and when to deliver ads to prospects.\n\nPrice:Â Offers aÂ free packageÂ for starters as well as a custom pricing package for enterprises\n\nSupported Ad Inventory:Â Video, social ads, display, native, and email\n\nAudience Targeting:Â Contextual, lookalike, demographic, interest, lookalike, and CRM targetingÂ\n\nAnti-fraud/Safety Measures:Â Has a Trust and Safety Team for automatically and manually filtering invalid traffic\n\nSupply Side Platform (SSP)\n\nAn SSP focuses on helping publishers (website owners) sell ad space on their apps, websites, and other digital properties.\n\nThese platforms use automation to determine the optimal price for each ad space and sell to the best bidder. SSPs work with ad networks to connect publishers to a broader pool of advertisers.\n\nLetâs take a look at a few of the leading SSPs in the industry.\n\nPubMatic\n\nPubMatic offers services for both media buyers and publishers. As an SSP, it provides an impressive collection of tools to help publishers optimize the monetization potential of all their digital assets.\n\nThis includes tools for header bidding, RTB advertising, Private Marketplaces (PMP), and ad quality.\n\nSupported Ad Inventory:Â CTV,Â OTT, display, video, addressable, mobile, native, and more\n\nAnti-fraud/Safety Measures for Publishers:Â Uses real-time scanning and strategic partnerships to safeguard publisherâs audiences across ad formats, channels, and screens\n\nGoogle Ad ManagerÂ\n\nProgrammatic publishers utilize an average of 6 SSPs to sell ad space to advertisers. Despite this, Google remains the most popular SSP among publishers, claiming 51% of the industryâs market share.\n\nIn fact, 75% of ad impressions in the US come from Google Ad Manager. More insights in the Twitter thread below.\n\nGoogle Ad Manager exists for large publishers with significant direct sales. Some of the tools it offers include server-side header bidding, managed PMPs, advanced dashboard and reporting system, and more.\n\nSupported Ad Inventory:Â Video, mobile, display, and native.\n\nAnti-fraud/Safety Measures for Publishers:Â Google supports popular safety standards, initiatives, and protocols such as the IAB ads.txt standard, SafeFrame, and HTTPS to protect against unsuitable ads and invalid activity\n\nCriteo\n\nCriteo offers a retail media service to help publishers monetize their site content by leveraging first-party data and audiences.\n\nUnlike Google Ads Manager, Criteo makes its services available to publishers with lower traffic numbers. As an SSP, Criteo focuses more on retargeting.\n\nMore info in the thread below:\n\nSupported Ad Inventory:Â Social media, video, display, web, and mobile\n\nAnti-fraud/Safety Measures for Publishers: Criteo uses advanced image recognition technology to filter unsafe content from publishersâ digital properties\n\nAd Exchanges\n\nAd Exchanges position themselves as the intermediary between advertisers and publishers.Â\n\nPublishers come to ad exchanges to submit ad impressions which are then presented to advertisers for bidding in real-time.\n\nHere are some of the best ad exchanges in the industry.\n\nXandr\n\nOriginally called AppNexus, Xandr is a leading programmatic advertising company offering a full stack of programmatic advertising services. This means it provides services, such as a DSP, SSP, and an Ad Exchange.\n\nAs an Ad Exchange, Xandr serves over 11.4 billion ad impressions daily.\n\nOne of its most notable features is its header bidding wrapper, which makes header bidding more convenient and efficient for publishers. The platform supports different ad inventory, including video, banner, audio, native, and more.\n\nXander partners with White Ops, an MRC-accredited company, for ensuring brand safety across its marketplace.\n\nSmartyAds\n\nSmartyAds provides a white-label ad exchange platform, Smart Hub, which has recorded over 25,000 publishers and 2 billion impressions daily.\n\nIt also serves as a full-stack programmatic ad tech platform, offering services as a DSP and SSP to both advertisers and publishers. The platform is compatible with a wide range of traffic types and ad formats, including video, banner, audio, native, push, pop, and more.\n\nCompared to Xandr, SmartyAds offers a more comprehensive collection of security and anti-fraud features and partnerships to make the marketplace safer for publishers and advertisers.\n\nPubMatic\n\nPubMatic makes a second appearance in this guide, thanks to its incredible capabilities as a full-stack ad tech platform.\n\nAs an ad exchange, PubMatic has established itself as an industry leader with over 171 billion ad impressions per day. Publishers benefit from its ease-of-use, DMP integrations, and open-source header bidding.\n\nOn the advertisers' side, PubMatic offers integration with various security tools to prevent fraudulent practices and ensure brand safety.\n\nData Management Platforms (DMPs)\n\nDMPs are less talked about in programmatic advertising platforms realm. But they're equally as important. Advertisers use all kinds of data when developing a campaign strategy to ensure their ads are relevant to their prospects.\n\nDSPs automatically place bids for ad spaces in the marketplace, but to ensure that the purchased ads are aimed at the right demographic, these platforms take advantage of data supplied by DMPs. Publishers, on the other hand, use DMPs to store and analyze user data to get a better understanding of their website visitors.\n\nHere are some of the most popular DMPs in the industry.\n\nAudience Studio by Salesforce\n\nSalesforce is widely known for its CRM system. However, the company also offers a Data Management Platform for advertisers.\n\nFormerly known as Salesforce DMP, Audience Studio allows advertisers to capture data from any source and segment this data using machine learning algorithms. It also offers a native consent management framework to help advertisers maintain transparency and trust with their customers.\n\nLotame\n\nLotame is an industry-leading DMP that offers a wide range of services, including audience management, data marketplace, and identity resolution.\n\nIt allows its users to access first-party data from sources like emails, CRMs, social media, apps, and more. It also provides the opportunity to expand on available data through its data marketplace.\n\nLotameâs DMP, however, lacks live reporting features and loads relatively slowly.Â\n\nThe Trade Desk\n\nAlongside a DSP, The Trade Desk offers a DMP to help advertisers and publishers collect, manage, and activate their data in one place.\n\nOne of its most popular features is its lookalike modeling which allows you to discover new audiences based on insights from your existing audiences. It also offers a data marketplace where users can access high-quality audiences from data providers.\n\nTheTradeDesk is actively expanding in the DMP sector. For example, TikTok and theTradeDesk launched a partnership not long ago. This collaboration will drive more brands to the platform and stimulate the growth of advertising on TikTok.\n\nMoving Forward: Automating Programmatic Analytics\n\nProgrammatic advertising, with its variety of platforms and ad placement options, generates a large chunk of data that marketing teams have to work with.
