        "text": "As live video streaming becomes more prevalent in our day-to-day lives, many businesses are experimenting with broadcasting. For those new to live streaming, this involves learning to deal with the many technicalities involved in streaming live video. Some of them are calibrating live streaming settings according to optimal video bitrates and managing stream output quality, sound output quality, and CPU usage when you record videos.\n\nOBS, or Open Broadcaster Software, is one such tool that makes the technical side of streaming simpler to manage. Why do broadcasters need to learn OBS bitrate streaming settings? Because knowing the best OBS studio settings is how you can elevate your live streams to professional-grade broadcasts. Learning to play around with OBS studio settings for streaming also gives you greater control over the elements that make up your streaming content, such as video resolution, rather than relying on the default settings alone.\n\nIt’s pretty easy to create high-quality live streams today, but successful live broadcasts require a little know-how and technical experience or understanding. Learning output quality settings and how they impact your video content enables you to create better live streams within the internet latency and set-up capabilities you have available.\n\nOne critical technical topic related to broadcasting is live stream encoding software and the encoding process. Encoding is essential to professional live streaming for several reasons.\n\nThis guide walks you through the best OBS studio settings for streaming and professional broadcasting. We’ve put together our top tips for optimizing OBS settings for live streaming. First, we’ll review what OBS and Studio mode is and what it does.\n\nOnce we’ve covered the basics, we’ll outline the best stream settings for OBS Studio broadcasts.\n\nWe updated this tutorial in March 2024 to reflect the best OBS Studio settings for the latest version.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nWhat is Encoding?\n\nWhat is OBS Studio?\n\nWhy Do OBS Settings Matter?\n\nHow to Configure Your OBS Studio Settings\n\nBest OBS Studio Settings for Streaming Audio and Video\n\nOBS Studio vs. Streamlabs OBS\n\nFAQ\n\nConclusion\n\nWhat is Encoding?\n\nEncoding refers to the process of converting analog video signals from a camera into digital signals that can be transmitted over the internet to viewers. It allows broadcasters to take raw video footage and prepare it for live streaming.\n\nSimply put, encoders allow you to convert your video files from RAW to digital to prepare them for transmission from your camera to your live streaming platform host. Along with a recording device and reliable internet, a functional encoder is a must for broadcasters.\n\nThe analog video signals your camera generates will be converted into digital signals that can be transmitted over the internet to a CDN (content delivery network) and then to your viewers.\n\nWithout encoding, you can’t transfer your live streaming content from your device to your viewers over the internet. The encoded content is decoded on the viewer’s end and this helps them watch your content.\n\nEncoders come in the form of both software and hardware. Software encoders are typically free or low-cost, but hardware encoders can get quite expensive.\n\nResearch shows that 67% of viewers rank video output quality as the most important factor in a live stream. As a broadcaster, you can ensure high-quality video content for your viewers by choosing the best OBS settings before you go live.\n\nAnd that’s because your video bitrate determines the live stream audio and video output quality that the viewers will see. So, you need to get your OBS studio bitrates right to deliver quality content to your viewers.\n\nWhat is OBS Studio?\n\nOBS Studio is a community-developed, open-source live streaming encoding software application.\n\nOBS stands for Open Broadcaster Software, and it’s an invaluable resource for anyone looking to maintain exceptional video recording quality in the content they create. For broadcasters and content creators, regardless of their experience level in video-making, OBS studio is easy to use for multi-platform full screen recording, casting and streaming. The only investment required is the time to learn optimal OBS studio settings for streaming and video recording.\n\nOBS Studio is a free, open-source RTMP-enabled encoder software perfect for new and experienced broadcasters. This open-source live streaming software allows users to capture and stream live video from any Mac, Windows, or Linux computer.\n\nRTMP stands for “Real-Time Messaging Protocol,” and it is part of the technology that makes live streaming possible. RTMP’s primary role is to deliver content from an encoder to an online video host. This RTMP function is referred to as “ RTMP ingest.” For OBS, the RTMP protocol bridges the gap between its encoding and streaming functions.\n\nAs we mentioned, professional live streaming requires either a software or hardware encoder. This equipment works to encode a live video feed into the correct format for streaming through your online video platform (OVP).\n\nOBS Studio offers many great features for new broadcasters just getting the hang of live streaming. The software has a set of OBS-specific system requirements to ensure the most optimal live broadcasting experience. These settings include mixing multiple sources with custom transitions, using audio/video filters and correction tools, and more.\n\nThe latest version of OBS is OBS Studio 30.0.2 was released on December 11th, 2023. It is free to download for macOS 11 or newer and supports both macOS(Intel) and macOS(Apple Silicon), Windows 10 and 11, and Ubuntu 20.04 operating systems or newer. For the Linux version, FFmpeg is required.\n\nOBS Studio is especially easy to use for Dacast users since we’ve created a custom OBS Studio portal that is free to access. But before we learn how to configure the best OBS settings, let’s understand why they matter in the first place.\n\nWhy Do OBS Settings Matter?\n\nChoosing the right OBS settings can make a huge difference in the output quality of your recording. If your settings are too low, your video may be blurry, pixelated, or choppy. On the other hand, if your settings are too high, your video may be too large, take up too much space, or be difficult to upload and share. Finding the right balance is key.\n\nIt’s particularly important to get your OBS settings right when you’re planning on live streaming using it. That’s because live streams should be light enough for your viewers to watch them in real-time. If you set up OBS to only upload the stream in the highest settings, there’s a good chance your viewers will have to contend with dropped frames or worse, long periods of buffering.\n\nBy default, OBS opts to drop video frames to keep your stream playing instead of having it buffer. This happens when your connection to your live streaming service isn’t stable or is unable to keep up with your set bitrate. And that’s where full control over the OBS studio bitrate comes in. By choosing the right bitrate settings, you can ensure your audio and video output quality are the best possible for the viewers based on their data speeds.\n\nHow to Configure Your OBS Studio Settings\n\nThere is a precise way to configure the OBS Studio settings for live streaming on an HTML5 live channel. Here’s a quick tutorial on optimizing OBS settings for streaming:\n\nFirst, open the OBS Studio settings by clicking the “Settings” button in the bottom-right area of the application window.\n\nThe first tab, labeled “General”, doesn’t have anything too critical to review. However, you can choose your language and a light or dark theme here.\n\nThe first tab, labeled “General”, allows you to tweak the software’s overall behavior and settings. For instance, you can choose your language and a theme, including light, dark, or gray, here. You can also activate the system tray for easy application access on your taskbar, tweak Preview and Multiview options, as well as the types of layouts used in Studio Mode.\n\nNext up is the “Stream” tab, where the magic happens. The streaming tab is where you can select your streaming service, in our case, Dacast. To access it, click on the next tab labeled “Stream” in the OBS Studio settings window.\n\nFor “Stream Type”, you should see “Custom…” by default. If not, please select it.\n\nNext, you need to enter the streaming credentials provided by your online streaming service including the stream URL (server), stream key, username, and password. You can find these credentials on your OVP’s streaming encoder setup page.\n\nOn Dacast, fetching these credentials looks like this:\n\nGo to your Dacast account, and open or create the channel you want to live stream with OBS. Open your “Encoder Setup”.\n\nYou will choose “Stream Name”, click on copy and go back to OBS to paste the key in the Stream Key field.\n\nYou have to do the same for “Server”, copied in the Stream URL. Repeat this for the username and password.\n\nIf you still have questions about configuring your OBS Studio settings, check out our OBS quickstart tutorial or watch our video on choosing the best OBS Studio settings.\n\nOption with iFrame Embed Code:\n\n<iframe src=”https://iframe.dacast.com/vod/3b67c4a9-3886-4eb1-d0eb-39b23b14bef3/08cebf46-2960-07df-89bf-4479e6b4be0e” width=”590″ height=”431″ frameborder=”0″ scrolling=”no” allow=”autoplay” allowfullscreen webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen oallowfullscreen msallowfullscreen></iframe>\n\nOption with JS Embed Code:\n\n<script id=”3b67c4a9-3886-4eb1-d0eb-39b23b14bef3-vod-08cebf46-2960-07df-89bf-4479e6b4be0e” width=”590″ height=”431″ src=”https://player.dacast.com/js/player.js?contentId=3b67c4a9-3886-4eb1-d0eb-39b23b14bef3-vod-08cebf46-2960-07df-89bf-4479e6b4be0e” class=”dacast-video”></script>\n\nOption with Share link:\n\nhttps://iframe.dacast.com/vod/3b67c4a9-3886-4eb1-d0eb-39b23b14bef3/08cebf46-2960-07df-89bf-4479e6b4be0e\n\nBest OBS Settings for Streaming Audio and Video\n\nTo stream with the best quality output possible, it is essential to choose the best OBS settings for your video encoder. Changing quality settings to optimize streaming is easy with OBS Studio; just use the Video tab and Audio tab to configure these settings.\n\nYour encoder is responsible for the audio output quality recorded from multiple sources: your external microphone and audio track. It also ensures the video output quality of your live streams is as high as possible, depending on the CPU usage preset.\n\nHere are a few of the best OBS settings for streaming audio and video content, including the bitrate settings.\n\n1. OVP-Specific Setting Requirements\n\nDifferent online video platforms have different encoder setting requirements. That’s because each video or multi stream platform uses different technology to bring streams to life. Another reason is differences in requirements such as stream output quality, video resolution, and the built-in CPU usage preset in the broadcaster’s system. That’s why selecting your OVP according to your needs and desired output as a broadcaster is important.\n\nDacast, for example, has a few required OBS settings that apply to this and any other encoding software you may use.\n\nThese required live encoder settings include:\n\nVIDEO CODECH.264 (x264 may work)FRAME RATE25 or 30KEYFRAME INTERVAL3 secs (or 3x frame rate)SCANNINGProgressiveENCODING BITRATEConstant Bitrate (CBR)AUDIO CODECAACAUDIO BITRATE128 KbpsAUDIO CHANNELS2 (Stereo)AUDIO SAMPLE RATE48 kHz (48,000 Hz)\n\n2. OBS Output Settings\n\nTo change your OBS Studio settings, you must open the “Output” tab in your OBS Studio account. Here, you’ll find settings related to streaming and recording where you can set your bitrate for the video and audio, type of encoder, recording quality, recording format, and the recording path, among other things. You can also choose the output mode.\n\nIn the default settings, the selected output settings tab is selected as “Simple”. To optimize your OBS settings for streaming and to ensure your live stream is stable and fully functional, we recommend you follow the configuration settings shared in the “Encoder Setup” window, pictured below:\n\nCustomizing these settings through the Video and Audio tabs will ensure higher video quality and audio quality for your stream. In the Output mode, you only need to focus on the video bitrate and the audio bitrate to optimize output resolution.\n\nBy default, the OBS audio and video bitrate settings will be in low definition. Here, you can control your stream quality by selecting the optimal video bitrate to broadcast high-quality video.\n\nOur suggested video OBS bitrate settings for different resolutions include:\n\nULDLDSDHDFHDNameUltra-Low DefinitionLow DefinitionStandard DefinitionHigh DefinitionFull High DefinitionVideo Bitrate (Kbps)350350 – 800800 – 12001200 – 19001900 – 4500Resolution Width (px)42664085412801920Resolution Height (px)2403604807201080H.264 ProfileMainMainHighHighHighAudio Bitrate (Kbps)6464128256256\n\nLet’s take a look at the audio settings now. You can easily customize these settings from the Audio tab. You can add any audio device, such as desktop audio or external microphone. If you are only streaming audio, you can get away with OBS bitrate settings as low as 64 Kbps. However, you should up your audio bitrate settings to 192-320 Kbps for better audio quality output.\n\nThe higher the bitrate for your audio, the crisper your live stream’s sound will be for the listeners. This is particularly important when they’re streaming videos in higher resolutions, and that’s why the audio bitrate needs to keep up with the video bitrate as the resolution increases.\n\nWe recommend downloading OBS Lua, which is an OBS-specific bitrate calculator. It’ll help you find the best OBS settings for your streaming needs.\n\n3. Bitrate and Internet Speed\n\nAs you manipulate your bitrate settings, it is essential to consider your internet connection.\n\nYour internet speed must be at least double your OBS bitrate if you want to produce a high-quality stream. Otherwise, you’ll run into buffering issues. Video quality isn’t the only element that defines the overall experience your content delivers to your viewers. Streaming with no buffering should also be as equally important as high video and audio quality output.\n\nFor example, if your internet upload speed is 2000 Mbps, then your OBS setting for streaming, audio, and video bitrates should not exceed 1000 Mbps.\n\nYou can search “internet speed test” on Google and click “RUN SPEED TEST” to test how fast your internet is.\n\nAdditionally, you can test your internet connection speed by going to the website testmy.net. By getting your bitrate right, you can ensure that the viewers won’t have to face constant interruptions for buffering when they’re watching your videos.\n\nIt’s equally important to consider your target audience when you’re determining the bitrate for your audio and video files. Are they going to watch your content on their smartphones or laptops? If they’re going to watch them while on the move, you might have to give them the option to lower the bitrates as their data speeds could fluctuate.\n\nAlternatively, you can opt for adaptive bitrate streaming, which enables you to dynamically change the bitrate of your live stream based on the data speed of the viewer. This way, they won’t have to face prolonged buffering periods and will have a smooth streaming experience.\n\n4. Advanced Output Mode\n\nAdvanced settings and rate control can also be accessed and changed through the Output tab to produce better-quality streams. If you select the “Advanced” output mode, you’ll get access to more options for the best OBS settings.\n\nSome of the settings available here include options for streaming, recording, audio, and replay buffer. You can set your bitrate, choose your encoder, set your CPU usage, and more. To ensure a quality stream output, you should use the following settings:\n\nPay close attention to ensure that your output mode is set to “Advanced”, the rate control is set as “CBR”, or constant bitrate, and the keyframe interval is equal to 3. You can also choose ABR (adaptive bitrate), VBR (variable bitrate), and CRF (constant rate factor). ABR is particularly helpful in situations where your viewers have fluctuating internet speeds.\n\nThe other setting on the Output OBS Studio settings page relates to recording your broadcast. This feature enables you to record the live stream to a local drive as you stream.\n\nWe recommend enabling this setting if you haven’t set up an auto-archiving feature with your live streaming platform. Use “mp4” for recording format, and “x.264” for the encoder.\n\n5. Hotkeys\n\nHotkeys allow you to set up different scenes within your live stream encoding software. That way, you can switch between the scenes during your live broadcast.\n\nHow you configure your hotkeys will depend on your specific needs. For example, you could set up unlimited number of hotkeys for specific overlays and inputs.\n\nThere are several default hotkeys on OBS Studio, but they are turned off by default. You can check out the documentation for using hotkeys for streaming with OBS Studio on GitHub.\n\n6. Video Sources\n\nTo add a video source, click on the “+” button in the “Sources” widget. You can select a display capture, screen recorder, video capture device, image, recorded video, etc. When you’re ready to stream live, click “Start Streaming”.\n\n7. OBS Recording Settings\n\nRecording streaming video and audio is a handy feature that lets broadcasters re-use live-streamed content with OBS Studio. Accessing this tool is very easy. Users must simply click “Start Recording” in OBS Studio’s Controls widget, located in the lower right-hand corner.\n\nTo access your stream recordings, click “File” on the top left-hand side of the screen and choose “Show Recordings”. If you’re using Windows, it’ll send the stream recording directly to your computer’s “Videos” folder.OBS Studio vs. Streamlabs OBS\n\nOBS Studio vs. Streamlabs OBS\n\nWhile we’re on the streaming software and the best OBS studio settings, let’s quickly discuss Streamlabs OBS, which is software similar to OBS Studio.\n\nStreamlabs OBS is a free and open-source streaming software designed for stream layout editing, replay buffer, selective recording, and remote streaming control.\n\nIt enables you to multistream to various platforms like YouTube, Facebook, Twitch, and TikTok. You also have the option to create an RTMP server to live stream to any endpoint of your choice. This helps you reach a wider audience as viewers across different platforms can watch your streams as they happen.\n\nYou can also invite guests to join your live streams through the Collab Cam feature. It enables you to bring much-needed engagement to your streams, with the free plan permitting 1 guest, while the paid plan allows up to 11 guests or cameras. Streamlabs OBS also offers lots of customizable transitions and overlay themes that you can add to your live stream to change its look.\n\nAdditionally, Streamlabs OBS offers a highlighter that lets you create highlight videos for short video formats like YouTube Shorts, TikToks, and Reels.
