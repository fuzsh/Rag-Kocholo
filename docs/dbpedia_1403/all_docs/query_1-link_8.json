This can be a news bulletin, a weather forecast, a talk show, a quiz show, an entertainment program, a sports program, etc.\n\nDepending on the number of spectators and on the type of activities involved, studios can be very big or small (as is the case for news and weather forecast programs).\n\nThere are two types of studios: real and virtual.\n\nReal Studio\n\nReal studios are furnished according to the type of show, with furniture such as: sofas, cabinets, desks, tables, video walls, scenery sets and so on.\n\nIt is essential that real studios be at least 3 or 4 meters high, so as to be able to install all the equipment needed for lighting the scene and creating special effects without disturbing close-ups and half-length shots.\n\nDepending on the size of the room, cameras can be installed either in front of or around the scene, mounted on tripods for regular shots, or on tracks or jibs for more spectacular ones.\n\nIn some cases, when the type of the show requires it, it is possible to install robotic cameras on tracks on the ceiling, crossing the scene from above.\n\nApart from the cameras, monitors should also be installed, allowing both the hosts and the audience to know what is actually being aired. This is useful, for example, when commercials are about to end and the director is about to take the studio cameras on the air again.\n\nOften, all of the camera signals are sent to specific monitors, allowing for a multiview. This is incredibly useful to directors, as they can easily decide what to do - during interviews where several guests are in the studio, for instance.\n\nOn the other hand, when the speakers are joined externally - a news correspondent, or a sports journalist attending a football match - then large monitors or video walls are installed and recorded live in the studio.\n\nLoud speakers are also necessary, so as to have a good overall acoustic within the studio, resulting in high-quality communication. This is especially important in the case of big studios, so that the guests can clearly hear each other as well as the external speakers.\n\nVirtual Studio\n\nA virtual studio is realized using the chroma key technique.\n\nWalls and floor are painted in a special green color. Alternatively, green screens can be hung all over the room.\n\nThanks to the video mixer, it will then be possible to edit the images, substituting the green background with anything the director wishes to insert: a clip, an image, a virtual studio.\n\nWhen using the chroma key technique one must pay special attention to a few essential details that will make the recording a successful one.\n\nFirst of all, the lighting must be evenly spread across all of the Cartesian axes. If any shadows were present, then these would be wrongly interpreted by the software that edits the green color, creating very unprofessional effects.\n\nAlso, both the hosts and the guests should wear clothes that bear no resemblance to the green tint. The better the contrast, the more realistic the result.\n\nStudio Control Room\n\nWe have now come to the technical area, involving all the essential operators who are \"behind the scenes\" and make things possible.\n\nThe Control Room is the room where all the camera and microphone signals converge. It will be then up to the director and the audio technician to manage each signal, using equipment that we are going to illustrate below.\n\nEditing Room\n\nApart from the control room, there are other types of rooms such as the editing ones, where recordings are edited before being aired.\n\nFinal Master Control Room\n\nFor complex stations, where there are several television studios, it is necessary to have what is known as the 'Master Control Room'.\n\nThis is where all the signals from all the studios converge. From here, one can chose where to send each signal.\n\nOnce out of the master control room, the signal is then sent - via matrixes and video links - to the transmission systems, the loggers, the editing studios or the streaming server.\n\nBack Stage and Make-up Room\n\nThis is the room that has been specifically set for the make-up of hosts, guests and stars.\n\nWhat type of staff typically operates in a studio?\n\nIn order to properly function, a television studio normally needs the following professionals:\n\nTechnical director\n\nAudio mixer operator\n\nVideo mixer operator\n\nLighting operator\n\nChoreographer\n\nDirector\n\nCameraman\n\nHost\n\nMake-up artists\n\nFurther members of staff are:\n\nPresenters\n\nJournalists\n\nGuests\n\nHow many cameras do I need in a video or television studio?\n\nYou need at least one or two cameras on a tripod stand - to be handled by a cameraman during the recording, following the director's instructions - and several PTZ cameras placed around the studio.\n\nWhere should I place my cameras?\n\nYou can place them in different spots and at different heights: some higher up, others lower down.\n\nIt also depends on whether there is an audience or not: in that case, you may think about using a rotating camera to move around the audience.\n\nCould I use just one camera to move around the studio?\n\nIf you wish to move freely and safely around the studio with your camera, then you need a very high-quality PTZ camera - which is, of course, very expensive.\n\nGenerally, you need more than one camera - and they don't have to be top-quality. You first position and point each camera in the desired direction, to then control it through the mixer.\n\nIt is very important to bear in mind that trying to do everything with one piece of equipment means taking a great risk.\n\nIf that piece of equipment breaks down or just stops functioning while you are streaming, then there is nothing you can do and you're out. This is something that people often do not realize, and this is why having spare or extra components - extra chargers, spare batteries, more than one camera - could be vital to the success of your broadcasting.\n\nWhat is NDI technology?\n\nNDI is non other than the conversion of video camera signals to computer signals - ID - from a LAN network.\n\nThe NDI protocol was invented in the USA and it is a very efficient protocol, especially from a compression point of view: it can offer a very high quality.\n\nThere are two types of NDI. The NDI HX type, used by small cameras, has a small latency, while the Full NDI type has little to no latency - meaning there is no delay during data acquisition -, allowing you to do pretty much whatever you wish."
