        "text": "Live streaming is one of the most popular forms of entertainment and content creation out there today. In fact, of all the video content watched around the world, nearly 25% is dedicated to livestreams.\n\nThe live streaming industry continues to grow, and with it, so do the number of live streaming apps. With so many choices out there, how do you choose the best live streaming app? We’ve sorted through the options and compiled a definitive list of the best live streaming apps in 2024.\n\nWhat is a live streaming app?\n\nThere are a few different kinds of live streaming apps.\n\nGenerally, a live streaming app is a platform on which you can watch and share streamed content. Think YouTube Live and Twitch: You can stream natively on these platforms and you can watch other creators stream.\n\nThere are also live streaming apps that allow you to embed your content onto your website, or apps that allow you to watch streams but not upload them. These aren’t social platforms, but more like content creation platforms or branded apps for businesses. This category could technically also include video conferencing apps like Zoom or Google Meet.\n\nAdditionally, many apps can enhance your live streaming creation. That means apps that help you to create better, more exciting livestreamed content, apps that allow you to reach more people, and so on. These apps typically allow you to stream to platforms like YouTube Live, but via their interface, so that you can have control over the output of the livestream.\n\nThese companion apps — that is, apps that make livestream creation possible — are some of the popular types of live streaming apps.\n\nWhat is Multistreaming?\n\nOnce you begin considering live streaming apps, you’ll encounter the term “multistreaming” (or occasionally, “simulcasting”). Multistreaming refers to live streaming to multiple platforms at one time, e.g., YouTube Live and Twitch. Multistreaming is something that can only be done through a live streaming app — you can’t natively stream to multiple platforms without the aid of an app that has multistreaming functionality.\n\nHow to choose a live streaming app\n\nLet’s say you’re a new creator looking for a live streaming app (or apps). With so many options to consider, how do you choose? Naturally, it depends on your goals, your audience, and your content: If you’re a podcaster hoping to grow your audience, you might not have the same goals as a boutique hoping to sell products and earn money with their live videos. So let's look at 16 of the best live streaming apps in 2024 to compare their features and functionalities.\n\nBest native live streaming apps in 2024\n\nYouTube Live\n\nYouTube is without a doubt one of the most popular video platforms ever, with well over two and a half billion users worldwide. Anyone can sign up for a YouTube account, and you can livestream (or upload recorded videos) from a computer or a mobile device. There are innumerable categories of video content on YouTube, so it’s a great platform for almost any kind of content creator.\n\nYouTube is considered the second-largest search engine in the world, so there's a clear opportunity to reach the people who truly care about your content. However, the majority of the video content on YouTube is video on demand (VOD), not livestreams, so even though YouTube is a preeminent platform with tons of benefits, there are still some downsides for streamers.\n\nPros\n\nIn-depth analytics and reporting\n\nMassive audience and robust search algorithm\n\nIntegration with Google means that YouTube videos show up in Google search results\n\nYouTube Partner Program offers built-in monetization tools like Super Chat, Super Stickers, and channel memberships\n\nCapability to share long-form and short-form videos on the same platform\n\nAbility to archive previous streams and videos on demand\n\nCons\n\nLive content isn't the platform's priority\n\nYouTube controls who advertises on your content\n\nIt can be hard for new creators without an established audience to get noticed on such a huge platform\n\nMembership in the YouTube Partner Program (i.e., monetization) requires 1,000 subscribers and 4,000 hours of watch time\n\nUses\n\nNews\n\nGaming\n\nSports\n\nLive vlogs\n\nInterviews\n\nProduct announcements\n\nTutorials\n\nWebinars\n\nEverything in between\n\nFacebook Live\n\nLike YouTube, Facebook is a huge platform with plenty of opportunities for live streaming. Facebook is the most popular social media platform with over three billion monthly users (as of 2024). Facebook also offers the opportunity to share longer content and short-form content on the same platform with their Reels and Stories features. Creators can stream from desktop or mobile to a professional page, personal profile, or Facebook group, which supports audience growth and cultivation.\n\nPros\n\nPrioritized live content: Followers are notified when you go live\n\nBuilt-in chat moderation settings\n\nReal-time livestream performance analytics\n\nMonetization from in-stream ads\n\nCons\n\nMaximum livestream length of 8 hours\n\nNo content indexing, meaning that Facebook Live videos don’t appear in search engine results\n\nComplicated interface\n\nLimited community engagement tools\n\nStreaming in HD is restricted to members of Level Up (Facebook’s gaming creator program) and managed partners\n\nUses\n\nGaming\n\nLive shopping\n\nLive events and performances\n\nIndustry updates\n\nLive Q and As\n\nProduct announcements\n\nLinkedIn Live\n\nLinkedIn is a unique social media platform. It’s been around for two decades and has always focused on business professionals. There are significantly fewer LinkedIn users than there are YouTube and Facebook users … but the platform is used by millions daily to network, find jobs, and engage with industry thought leaders. LinkedIn also offers four premium pricing tiers, to which a whopping 39% of users subscribe.\n\nPros\n\nLinkedIn Live offers a unique opportunity to share content relevant to a particular industry or niche\n\nStreams can be directed to LinkedIn profiles, Pages, or Events\n\nLinkedIn Lives are public and recorded by default — after a stream ends, the recording stays on your LinkedIn profile or Page\n\nRobust analytics\n\nCons\n\nLinkedIn Live access is restricted to members and Pages with more than 150 followers, among other criteria\n\nLinkedIn doesn't support streaming natively, so creators need to use a third-party broadcast tool to create a LinkedIn Live.\n\nThe maximum livestream duration is four hours\n\nContent generally relates to industry news and professional interests, so the platform won’t support every type of creator\n\nLimited livestream viewership compared to other platforms\n\nUses\n\nCompany announcements\n\nRecruitment\n\nWorkshops\n\nIndustry updates\n\nLive events\n\nQ&As\n\nInstagram Live\n\nAlongside Facebook, Instagram is a Meta-owned social media platform with a huge number of members: more than two billion monthly active users. An estimated 100 million people watch Instagram Live content every day. Instagram is most popular with younger audiences and is considered the number one platform for engaging with businesses. Instagram began as a mobile app, and though many of its features are now available on desktop, some (including live streaming) remain mobile-only.\n\nPros\n\nPlatform prioritizes live video and takes steps to notify potential viewers: Followers are notified when livestreams begin; live videos appear in the super-visible Stories section; and profile icon UI adjusts to indicate when a livestream is in progress\n\nPast livestreams stay in a profile’s Stories section for 24 hours\n\nInstagram Live allows you to invite guests or collaborators to join your stream\n\nBecause Instagram is owned by Meta, it’s simple to crosspost streams on Facebook Live\n\nCons\n\nThe maximum livestream duration is four hours\n\nLive streaming is only possible on the mobile app\n\nVideo quality is dependent on your wireless connection and mobile phone used\n\nLivestream monetization (via Badges) is only available for creators with over 10,000 followers\n\nUses\n\nVlogs\n\nLive events\n\nNews coverage\n\nQ&As\n\nProduct reviews\n\nCasual chats\n\nTwitch\n\nTwitch has been around for over a decade, and unlike every other live streaming app we’ve mentioned so far, Twitch is fully dedicated to streaming. There are about seven million active streamers on Twitch, and tens of millions of hours of content are streamed each month. While there are plenty of different kinds of content on Twitch, it’s primarily focused on gaming streams, and many of its creator tools are geared toward gamers.\n\nPros\n\nPopular, established platform purely for live streaming\n\nStrong monetization potential, including subscription tiers and unique donation features\n\nCommunity-building tools make Twitch one of the easiest platforms on which to grow your audience\n\nLarge dedicated support team\n\nPowerful channel analytics tools\n\nCons\n\nMore narrow audience content interests than other platforms\n\nMonetization options are restricted to Twitch Affiliates and Partners, which have some barriers to entry\n\nTwitch Affiliates and Partners cannot multistream Twitch content to other platforms under their Terms of Service\n\nStrict rules for streaming content and accounts can get banned without warning\n\nUnbalanced gender distribution: While most social platforms have a base of around 50% of users identifying as men and 50% of users identifying as women, Twitch is drastically different, with roughly 80% of users identifying as men and 20% of users identifying as women\n\nUses\n\nGaming/eSports\n\nTutorials\n\nTech events\n\nLive vlogs\n\nKick\n\nKick is the new kid on the block in the live streaming space founded in late 2022. Created as a competitor to Twitch, it’s best known for being backed by the online casino stake.com and for its comparably low revenue split of 95% of earnings given to the streamer and 5% to the platform. Kick has made headlines by signing well-known streamers such as xQc to lucrative partner deals. Like Twitch, Kick’s primary focus is on gaming and IRL streams.\n\nPros\n\nPopular, up-and-coming platform purely for live streaming\n\nGenerous 95-5% revenue split between creator and platform\n\nLooser TOS restrictions when compared to platforms like Twitch\n\nInnovative Kick Creator Incentive Program\n\nCons\n\nMore narrow audience content interests compared to other platforms\n\nMonetization options are restricted to Kick Affiliates which have some barriers to entry\n\nNew platforms experience bugs and technical issues more than most\n\nNo TV App is currently available\n\nKick being backed by a gambling company can be considered an ethical dilemma for some\n\nUses\n\nGaming/eSports\n\nIRL/Just Chatting\n\nMusic\n\nTutorials\n\nTech events\n\nTikTok\n\nTikTok exploded onto the scene in the last few years with its emphasis on short videos, usually set to popular music or sound clips. TikTok is especially popular among younger audiences and now has over one billion active monthly users. Many other social platforms, like YouTube, Facebook, and Instagram have attempted to capitalize on TikTok’s popularity by adding the ability to create and share short, vertical-only videos.\n\nPros\n\nCollaborative tools allow streamers to invite other content creators to join their videos\n\nThe option of sharing standard short-form videos on the same platform supports new creators in growing their audience\n\nThe increasing popularity of the platform worldwide means an ever-growing potential audience\n\nCons\n\nLack of moderation can result in low-quality content on the platform\n\nMonetization is limited to donations via TikTok coins\n\nMinimum of 1,000 followers to use TikTok Live\n\nUses\n\nVlogs\n\nLive events\n\nQ&As\n\nProduct reviews\n\nVimeo\n\nVimeo is a platform that supports video hosting and sharing. Its primary feature is a video player embed, plus basic video creation tools and templates.
