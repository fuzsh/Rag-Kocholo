        "text": "Ok so first off Iâd like to mention that this app is actually really good and itâs all free and I really appreciate that and Iâm pretty sure you can watch like anything that comes out on Lifetime on this app well except for movies but Iâm pretty sure they have another app thatâs for specifically lifetime movies but anyway thatâs not the point this app is really great and but I just like to mention that thereâs a lot of ads like so many like itâs just gets repetitive you know and itâs kind of annoying how many ads there are and also the ads just go on for like so long and you know sometimes I feel like thereâs more ads and there is video but other than that it really is a great app and if you donât mind ads then I would really recommend it and this is no hate to the app itâs just constructive criticism Iâm just mentioning things that could be improved and obviously yes I do know that companies canât stop the ads because this is what keeps them able to make everything free but itâs just I feel like there could be a just a tad bit less ads Iâm not saying completely no ads at all Iâm just saying less ads Iâd also be really nice if they could add like different ads in there instead of just all the same ads over and over again it would just make it so much better but yeah thatâs all thanks for ltakimv your time to listen to my review.\n\nI love this app, all of the shows are free with is amazing! One thing that Iâd like to point out is the ads. I know apps canât stop ads cause that what keeps the ads free cause there advertising the app or company but thereâs a lot of flaws about how the ads run etc. For example, Iâm watching my show and thereâs ads. I usually donât have problems with ads but with these there repeating themself in a row and not just after the last add the show had but right after that ad. To be more specific the same car ad or stop and shop ad keep popping up repeatedly and it gets boring after seeing an ad replete itâs self frequently. Another thing about this ad problem is that there going on for a long time and there multiple ads in one sequence so it gets the person aggravated cause they just want to watch the rest of there show. One more thing Iâd like to point out about the ads is that they keep pausing with a reload sign after almost every ad and it shows the first scene and then switches to a totally different ad and it gets annoying cause people that have perfect internet get annoyed cause the ads keep having to pause then switch. If people are fine with ads popping up constantly then get the app cause otherwise itâs great! But if u hate ads like me, donât get this app.\n\nSo I would rate this a three because the ads that keep coming on the same ones over and over and itâs really hard for me to watch my shows and especially they get really annoying the ads that go over and over I would at least like to have ads that are different but Iâm also giving it a three because I love watching dance moms I can watch it clearly hear everything nicely so there was no other problem other than those ads I really would like this app to change the way the ads are because itâs very annoying that I just keep coming and coming and theyâre the same ones over and over I really donât like the fact about the ads that come on and I see every like kind of review they say that they donât like that the ads are just going and going and Iâm pretty sure Iâm not the only one whoâs annoyed here I really hate the fact that I just keep going and going same ones over and over and I just wanted to say if youâre going to download this app you have to make sure you like adds a lot like come on always and always and always I tried doing something to stop the ads but itâs not capable so"
