        "text": "Summer Art Studios classes are broken into the following age brackets: Youth classes ages 7â10, 10-13, 11-14 as well as Teen classes ages 14â18. The curriculum for each class has been developed to fit the skill level of the student in that specific age range. As such, class selections should be based on each studentâs age, rather than on his/her artistic ability. Please register your child according to his/her age (no exceptions to this policy are allowed).\n\nSummer Art Studios classes can be rigorous, focused, and require skills sets (both physical, verbal, and cognitive) that might not be appropriate for all youth and teens. If your child has any learning challenges or special needs, or if you have any questions or concerns about the appropriateness of a class for your child before registering them please reach out.\n\nAll faculty and staff will be parking off-site in order to maximize space for you and our other patrons. We encourage you to arrive early to find a parking space prior to checking your student(s) in or out. Friday will be particularly hectic mid-day because of Friday Finale, and we strongly suggest that you arrive early and/or find off-site parking. If the Ursuline parking lot is full, you may also park at the Central Public Library Parking Garage or in one of the paid parking lots along our perimeter. Unless you are a member, please refrain from parking in the lot belonging to Club Giraud.\n\nParents, relatives, and friends are invited to join us for FRIDAY FINALE every Friday afternoon from Noon - 1:00pm! Friday Finale provides a great opportunity to have lunch with your child and view the artwork that has been produced during the week across all of the Summer Art Studios classes. Itâs also a chance to meet your childâs new friends, chat with other parents, and get to know our instructors. Health and safety precautions will be followed during this event. Masks will be required to be worn and social distancing will be enforced."
