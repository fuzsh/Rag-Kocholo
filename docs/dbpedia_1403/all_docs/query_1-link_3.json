Television\n\nOriginal releaseNetworkNBCReleaseSeptember 18, 2006 ( ) –\n\nJune 28, 2007 (2007-06-28)\n\nStudio 60 on the Sunset Strip is an American comedy-drama television series created and primarily written by Aaron Sorkin. The series was about the production of a live comedy series similar to Saturday Night Live. Produced by Warner Bros. Television, Studio 60 on the Sunset Strip ran on NBC for 22 episodes, from September 18, 2006, to June 28, 2007.\n\nOn May 14, 2007, NBC canceled the series after one season. This is Sorkin's only series not to air for more than one season.\n\nPlot\n\n[edit]\n\nThe series takes place behind the scenes of a live sketch comedy show (also called Studio 60 on the Sunset Strip or Studio 60) on the fictional television network NBS (National Broadcasting System), whose format is similar to that of NBC's Saturday Night Live. The show-within-a-show is run by executive producers Matt Albie (Matthew Perry) and Danny Tripp (Bradley Whitford). Matt serves as the head writer and Danny produces the show.\n\nCast and crew\n\n[edit]\n\nStudio 60 features an ensemble cast portraying the personnel involved in the production of a late-night comedy show.\n\nMajor roles\n\n[edit]\n\nDanny Tripp (Bradley Whitford) is a former segment producer for Studio 60 who is asked to return as showrunner/executive producer when executive producer Wes Mendell is fired. He works closely with Matt Albie, his longtime friend. He is a recovering drug addict and alcoholic.\n\nMatt Albie (Matthew Perry) is a former writer for Studio 60 who takes over production along with long-time friend Danny Tripp, as executive producer and head writer. He is also Harriet's ex-boyfriend.\n\nJordan McDeere (Amanda Peet) is the recently hired president of entertainment programming of network National Broadcasting System, of which Studio 60 is the flagship show.\n\nHarriet Hayes (Sarah Paulson) is a \"multi-talented\"[1] performer, a devout Christian, and one of the \"Big Three\" main stars of Studio 60. She is also Matt Albie's ex-girlfriend. She also dated Luke Scott, a former writer (and Matt's rival) at Studio 60, now a big-time director. The character of Harriet is partially based on Kristin Chenoweth, whom Sorkin previously dated before she worked on The West Wing.[2]\n\nTom Jeter (Nate Corddry) is another of the show's \"Big Three.\" He is from the Midwest, and his brother is serving as an airman in the US Air Force who is deployed in Afghanistan.[3] During the course of the show, he begins dating Lucy Kenwright, one of the staff writers.\n\nSimon Stiles (D. L. Hughley), the final member of the \"Big Three\", became an alumnus of the Yale School of Drama after a troubled youth. His original intention was to become a dramatic actor, rather than a comedian.\n\nJack Rudolph (Steven Weber) is the chairman of the National Broadcasting System, and Jordan's boss. During the course of the show, he and his wife separate.\n\nCal Shanley (Timothy Busfield) is the director of Studio 60. He has two children and is a military history buff. (Busfield also directed several episodes of the series, as he did for Sports Night.)\n\nSecondary roles\n\n[edit]\n\nJeannie Whatley (Ayda Field) is a member of the show's ensemble. She is Matt's occasional lover and Harriet's close friend and is a bit of a gossip on the set.\n\nAlex Dwyer (Simon Helberg) is a member of the show's ensemble; he is recognized as the complement to Harriet Hayes, being the premier male impressionist in the cast. He has at least one recurring sketch, The Nicolas Cage Show, in which he plays the title character, and has also portrayed Tom Cruise and Ben Stiller.\n\nDylan Killington (Nate Torrence) is a rookie member of the show's ensemble. Dylan plays a number of different characters in the show-within-a-show. During \"Nevada Day Part – II\", Simon goes to Nevada with Tom, Danny, and Jack; Matt then asks a reluctant Dylan to fill in for Simon in News 60. He has a crush on Jeannie.\n\nSamantha Li (Camille Chen) is a member of the show's ensemble.\n\nRicky Tahoe (Evan Handler) is a former co-executive producer of the show and former co-head of the writers' room. In \"The Option Period\", he and Ron leave Studio 60 to pursue a pilot show for Fox called Peripheral Vision Man – based on a character from an old Studio 60 sketch; Ricky's departure is marked by a hostile shouting match with Matt.\n\nRon Oswald (Carlos Jacott) is a former co-executive producer of the show and former co-head of the writers' room. In \"The Option Period\", he leaves the show with Ricky to pursue a pilot show for Fox called Peripheral Vision Man – based on a character from an old Studio 60 sketch.\n\nWilson White (Edward Asner) is the head of TMG (Tunney Media Group), the conglomerate that owns the NBS network.\n\nLucy Kenwright (Lucy Davis) is a junior writer on the show and the only pre-Matt and Danny writer to remain after Ricky and Ron's departure. Lucy and Darius are supposed to get their first sketch on the air in \"B-12\". The sketch is about a bungling hostage taker, but it is cancelled when a real-life hostage-taker kills his entire family and then himself just after that evening's show starts. During the course of the show, Lucy begins dating Tom Jeter.\n\nDarius Hawthorne (Columbus Short) is Matt's assistant writer. Matt and Simon hire Darius after seeing his stand-up act in \"The Wrap Party\". During \"The Harriet Dinner\" he argues with Simon because Darius passed a sketch pitched by Simon to Lucy.\n\nAndy Mackinaw (Mark McKinney) is introduced in \"B-12\" after Ricky and Ron's departure when Matt needs an extra writer's help. Andy is a former writer whose tenure on Studio 60 predates Matt and Danny's initial departure. Since that time, Andy's wife and daughter have died in a car accident. Andy is very serious and has only been seen smiling once.\n\nSuzanne (Merritt Wever) is a former production assistant on the show who becomes Matt's assistant in the episode \"B-12\". She confronts Matt about his drug use in the episode \"Breaking News\".\n\nHallie Galloway (Stephanie Childers) is the vice-president of alternative programming (a.k.a. reality TV) for NBS and has developed an adversarial relationship with Jordan. She first appears in the episode \"Monday\". McDeere has expressed her fear that Galloway is being groomed to take her place after the rocky start to McDeere's tenure as president of the network.\n\nMary Tate (Kari Matchett) is a lawyer from law firm Gage Whitney Pace who is hired by NBS and has a sexual interest in Matt. Between \"Breaking News\" and \"What Kind of Day Has It Been\", Mary is used as a second option to get Tom's brother out of the hostage situation.\n\nShelly Green (Wendy Phillips) is head of publicity for NBS.\n\nGuest appearances\n\n[edit]\n\nWes Mendell (Judd Hirsch) is the creator of Studio 60 who is fired by Jack Rudolph after going on a long on-air rant against the current state of television. Although he appears only in the pilot, Wes is referred to as a big influence on Matt and Danny.\n\nMartha O'Dell (Christine Lahti) is a Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist working on a story for Vanity Fair about the new leadership of Studio 60. In \"The West Coast Delay\" and \"The Long Lead Story\" she ends up easily uncovering almost every detail of the cast and crew's personal lives. Martha's character is based on the columnist Maureen Dowd, who once dated Sorkin.[4]\n\nKim Tao (Julia Ling) guest starred in five episodes (\"Nevada Day Part 1,\" \"Nevada Day Part 2,\" \"Monday,\" \"Harriet Dinner Part 1,\" \"Harriet Dinner Part 2\") as a viola prodigy who speaks five languages. She is the official translator for her father during the Macau deal. Kim claims to be Tom's biggest fan, and, because of this, she wants to pursue a career in improvisational comedy against her father's wishes.\n\nEli Weinraub (Eli Wallach) appeared in \"The Wrap Party.\" An old mischievous man with an interesting – and familiar – past. Wallach was nominated for an Emmy for this role.\n\nRobert \"Bobby\" Bebe (John Goodman) is a Pahrump, Nevada judge in \"Nevada Day Part 1\" and \"Nevada Day Part 2\". Goodman won an Emmy for this role.\n\nKevin Eubanks appeared as himself in \"The Christmas Show\".\n\nFelicity Huffman, Lauren Graham, Allison Janney, Masi Oka, Howie Mandel, Jenna Fischer, Jason Alexander and Rob Reiner appeared as themselves as celebrity hosts in various episodes.\n\nProduction\n\n[edit]\n\nDevelopment\n\n[edit]\n\nStudio 60 on the Sunset Strip was tentatively titled Studio 7 on the Sunset Strip during its development stage. The series prompted NBC and CBS to engage in an intense bidding war for the rights to the show in October 2005, with NBC agreeing to a \"near-record license fee\" in order to obtain the rights.[5] It was the show most anticipated by media buyers prior to the network upfront presentations, according to MediaLife.[6] Among the online public the show was also highly anticipated, receiving the most online \"mentions\" and the most positive sentiment of any new 2006 show.[7]\n\nInfluences on the show\n\n[edit]\n\nSorkin drew from his own experience as a writer in creating the characters (the Harriet/Matt relationship was based on Sorkin's relationship with Kristin Chenoweth, who played Annabeth Schott on The West Wing).[8] In Studio 60's pilot, one of the reasons that Matt and Harriet broke up was Harriet's decision to appear on The 700 Club to support her Christian music album. In 2005, Chenoweth made a similar appearance on The 700 Club, sparking a negative reaction from some of her gay fans because of the views of 700 Club host Pat Robertson.[9] Unlike Matt and Harriet, Sorkin and Chenoweth did not work together on The West Wing. Sorkin left after The West Wing's fourth season and Chenoweth joined the cast during season six.\n\nThe Jordan McDeere character was loosely based on former ABC Entertainment President Jamie Tarses, who was a consultant on the show.[10]\n\nThe conflict between NBS and the FCC regarding uncensored language of American soldiers in Afghanistan parallels the decision by a small number of PBS affiliates to air the Oscar-nominated documentary Operation Homecoming: Writing the Wartime Experience in full, despite potentially hefty fines for unedited obscenities used by American soldiers describing their experiences in Iraq.[11]\n\nFollowing Sorkin's trend of putting real-life behind-the-scenes conflict into the writing of the show, the latter episodes of the series focus on Matt and Danny having to come up with more money for the show. The duo determine that they could raise extra money by remaking the stage as a form of product placement. This mirrors the real-world struggle of the show and its constant attempts to reduce the budget of the show and also generate more money. The new stage and its advertisements would have generated money for Studio 60, the fictional show, as well as the real life Studio 60 program. This last-ditch attempt was not enough to save the show.\n\nSimilarities to 30 Rock\n\n[edit]\n\nTwo shows debuting on 2006–07 NBC lineup, 30 Rock and Studio 60 on the Sunset Strip, revolved around the off-camera happenings on a Saturday Night Live-analogue sketch comedy series. Similarities between the two led to speculation that only one of them would be picked up. 30 Rock co-star Alec Baldwin said, \"I'd be stunned if NBC picked up both shows. And ours has the tougher task, as a comedy, because, if it's not funny, that's it.\"[12] Kevin Reilly, then president of NBC Entertainment, was supportive of 30 Rock creator, writer, producer and star Tina Fey, describing the situation as a \"high-class problem\":\n\nI just can't imagine the audience would look at both shows, choose one and cancel the other out. In some ways, why is it any different than when there have been three or four cop shows on any schedule, or Scrubs and ER, which are tonally very different?[13]\n\nEvidence of the overlapping subject matter between the shows, as well as the conflict between them, arose when Aaron Sorkin asked Lorne Michaels to allow him to observe Saturday Night Live for a week, a request Michaels denied.[12] Despite this, Sorkin sent Fey flowers after NBC announced it would pick up both series, and wished her luck with 30 Rock.[14] Fey said that \"it's just bad luck for me that in my first attempt at prime time I'm going up against the most powerful writer on television. I was joking that this would be the best pilot ever aired on Trio. And then Trio got canceled.\"[12]\n\nAlthough 30 Rock's first-season ratings proved lackluster and were lower than those of Studio 60,[15] Studio 60 was more expensive to produce.[16] Studio 60 was canceled after one season while 30 Rock was renewed, and would ultimately last for seven seasons and 138 episodes, the last of which aired during the 2012–13 season.\n\nEpisodes\n\n[edit]\n\nStudio 60 consists of a single season of 22 episodes. Its pilot episode was written by series creator Aaron Sorkin, and directed by executive producer Thomas Schlamme. Its pilot was ostensibly based on Sorkin and Schlamme's experience on The West Wing.[17] Sorkin wrote or co-wrote all of the episodes. Schlamme directed four episodes, a total exceeded only by Timothy Busfield, who directed five episodes and co-directed a sixth.\n\nThe series includes two two-part episodes (\"Nevada Day\" and \"The Harriet Dinner\") and concludes with a story arc featuring a three-part episode \"K & R\" (kidnap & ransom) that is capped off with a fourth and final episode (\"What Kind of Day Has It Been\").\n\nNo. Title Directed by Written by Original air date Guest host &\n\nmusical guest 1\"Pilot\"Thomas SchlammeAaron SorkinSeptember 18, 2006 ( )Felicity Huffman\n\nThree 6 Mafia\n\nThe executive producer of a late night sketch comedy show sparks a media frenzy when he has an on-air meltdown during a live broadcast. The newly appointed network president, Jordan McDeere, has to scramble to make things right by hiring back two former prized employees to become the new executive producers of her network's flagship program. She hires writer Matt Albie and former sketch producer, now director Danny Tripp, who had both left the show years before on terms that were not amicable. Meanwhile, Matt and ex-girlfriend Harriet Hayes come to terms with having to work on the show together very soon after their breakup.\n\n2\"The Cold Open\"Thomas SchlammeAaron SorkinSeptember 25, 2006 ( )Mark Wahlberg[18]\n\nThe White Stripes[19][20]\n\nMatt and Danny have five days to put together their first show, which is receiving enormous media attention and Harriet tries her best to work with Matt. In the meantime, Jordan puts her new job on the line by facing down pressure due to a controversial sketch amidst criticism from sponsors and affiliates scared of alienating Christians. Also, staff writers Ricky and Ron — who were catalysts to Matt and Danny's initial departure — express their dismay at being made to work for Matt.\n\n3\"The Focus Group\"Christopher MisianoAaron SorkinOctober 2, 2006 ( )Rob Reiner\n\nGwen Stefani[19]\n\nA network focus group sends a scare through the company that the ratings success of Matt and Danny's first show might have been a one-time thing. Harriet expresses her jealousy at Matt having spent the night with Jeannie so shortly after breaking up, accusing him of rubbing it in her face. The team is pleased to have had a high rating for their opening week with Matt and Danny's return, but fear they won't retain momentum in the ratings in the follow-up show. Jeannie is disappointed by the focus group's score for her sketch \"Commedia Dell'Arte\". Matt makes a deal with Jeannie regarding the success of the sketch on the live broadcast.\n\n4\"The West Coast Delay\"Timothy BusfieldMark Goffman & Aaron SorkinOctober 9, 2006 ( )None Featured\n\nJordan is approached by Vanity Fair columnist Martha O'Dell (guest star Christine Lahti), requesting access to Studio 60 to write a long lead story about the rebirth of the show.

This causes a dispute in which Tom injures a man protesting against Harriet. Through a unique series of events, Tom is later arrested. Following this, a variety of cast and staff from NBS travel to Pahrump, a small town in Nevada, to get Tom out of jail in time for his show that night.

Harriet contemplates doing a lingerie photo spread in a magazine, which Tom and Simon advise her against for the sake of her professional image.

The final image in the show's run is the entire cast of Studio 60 looking back on the day's events, ready to start all over again come Monday.\n\nReception\n\n[edit]\n\nCritical reaction\n\n[edit]\n\nTelevision critics named Studio 60 their \"Best Overall New Program\" in a poll conducted by Broadcasting and Cable,[22] based on the pilot episode. In their 2006 year-end issue, the New York Daily News listed Studio 60 as number 6 on their best \"Series of the Year\" list, and it was also listed in best standout performances as number 9 for Matthew Perry.[23] Glenn Garvin of the Miami Herald named Studio 60 as number 2 on his list of best \"Series of the Year.\"[24] Studio 60 earned a collective rating of 75 out of 100 based on 33 reviews by TV critics and received 8.2 out of 10 from 276 votes by users on Metacritic.[25]\n\nThe pilot was seen by an average of 13.4 million total viewers in its initial airing on NBC, although it experienced significant viewer falloff from the first half-hour to the second half-hour,[26] and the second episode's Nielsen ratings were down by 12% from the pilot.[27] The erosion continued through episode 5, with a 43% viewer drop off from its premiere, but subsequently leveled off.\n\nOn October 27, 2006, NBC gave a conditional \"vote of confidence\" by ordering three additional scripts on top of the initial order of 13.[28] Despite the order, Studio 60 performed poorly in the ratings, which led to speculation that the network was seriously considering canceling the show.\n\nGossip blogger Roger Friedman of Fox News reported on October 30, 2006, that cancellation of the show was imminent.[29] This was denied the next day by an NBC representative who stated that the show \"is profitable at this point\" and that, rather than a cancellation, it was more likely that the timeslot would change.[30]\n\nOn November 9, 2006, NBC announced that the show had been picked up for a full season, citing its favorable demographics as the reason. According to NBC's press release: \"Studio 60 has consistently delivered some of the highest audience concentrations among all primetime network series in such key upscale categories as adults 18–49 living in homes with $75,000-plus and $100,000-plus incomes and in homes where the head of household has four or more years of college.\"\n\nIn its December 17, 2006, issue, Time listed Studio 60 as one of \"5 Things That Went From Buzz to Bust\", sharing the distinction with other \"phenomena that captivated the media for a spell, then turned out to be less than huge.\"[31] Entertainment Weekly named Studio 60 the worst TV show of 2006.[32] Comedy writers were largely disdainful of Studio 60, with comments like \"People in television, trust me, are not that smart\", \"[Sorkin] wants to get big ideas across and change people's minds. No comedians work that way. They go for the laughs first and the lesson second\", and \"[Saturday Night Live] is so dark, they could never show what actually happens there.\"[33]\n\nThe New Yorker described the short-lived Studio 60 on the Sunset Strip as a show people loved to hate-watch, as \"it was bad in a truly spectacular way—you could learn something from it, about self-righteous TV speechifying and failed satire and the dangers of letting a brilliant showrunner like [Aaron] Sorkin run loose to settle all his grudges in fictional form\".[34]\n\nOn July 19, 2007, the Academy of Television Arts & Sciences announced their nominations for the 2007 Primetime Emmy Awards. Studio 60 was nominated in five categories. The pilot episode earned three nominations: Outstanding Directing (Thomas Schlamme), Outstanding Cinematography for a Single-Camera Series, and Outstanding Casting in Dramatic Series. Both John Goodman and Eli Wallach were nominated Outstanding Guest Actor in Dramatic Series.[35] Studio 60 Emmy nominations surpassed several other shows, such as Friday Night Lights and Dexter, which got two and three, respectively. The show also tied with CSI and 24.\n\nU.S. scheduling\n\n[edit]\n\nOn December 2, 2006, NBC announced that Studio 60 would be sharing the Monday at 10 p.m. timeslot with The Black Donnellys; as a result, Studio 60 was on hiatus from December 4, 2006, to January 22, 2007.[36] It then aired intermitently until February 26, 2007, when it was scheduled to take another hiatus.[37]\n\nOn February 13, 2007, NBC announced that Studio 60 would go on hiatus one week early, and that the last episode would air on February 19, 2007; at least partially due to the show's delivering its lowest ratings to date on the Monday preceding the announcement.[38]\n\nDuring the hiatus on NBC, The Black Donnellys (premiered February 26), Thank God You're Here (premiered April 9), The Real Wedding Crashers (premiered April 23, after Thank God You're Here moved to Wednesdays),[39][40] and Law & Order: Criminal Intent (aired its last two episodes of the season starting May 14) occupied the Monday 10 p.m. time period.\n\nOn April 2, 2007, NBC announced that Studio 60 would not reclaim its Monday at 10 p.m. time slot at the conclusion of The Black Donnellys run and that The Real Wedding Crashers, a reality show based on the popular movie, would occupy the timeslot from April 23, 2007, through the end of the TV season. However, on April 26, NBC announced that Studio 60 would return from its hiatus on Thursday, May 24, at 10:00 p.m.\n\nStudio 60 was canceled on May 11, 2007, during the NBC upfront presentation.[41]\n\nAfter cancellation\n\n[edit]\n\nIn a 2011 reference to the cancelled Studio 60, Aaron Sorkin appeared in \"Plan B\", a fifth-season episode of 30 Rock; he played himself, depicted as looking for work alongside an also-struggling Liz Lemon. He refers to his achievements, such as The West Wing and The Social Network, but when Liz Lemon mentions Studio 60, he quickly replies, \"Shut up!\" During the March 2012 promotion of Bent, an NBC romantic comedy series starring Amanda Peet, Peet commented on what the issue was with Studio 60, saying it was \"too expensive and there was too much anticipation. I guess all together we seemed like this arrogant monolith, but individually, none of us felt very arrogant.\"[42]\n\nIn later years, the show gained more positive recognition,[43] with critics praising Perry's performance in particular following the actor's death.[44][45] Writing in The Guardian, Jack Seale said Perry \"was better than anyone at nailing Sorkin’s turbo-speed dialogue and adept at finding subtler, gentler notes in the gaps between the lines than was possible in a sitcom. But the soul of Perry’s performance was in its closeness to his own personality.\"[46]\n\nTelevision ratings\n\n[edit]\n\nU.S. ratings\n\n[edit]\n\nWeekly rankings based on Fast National ratings.[47][48][49][50]\n\nSeason One (2006–2007) # Episode Air Date Rating Share 18–49 Demographic Viewers\n\n(in millions) Rank 1 \"Pilot\"\"Pilot\" 01September 18, 2006 8.6 14 5.0 13.14 # 22 2 \"Cold Open, The\"\"The Cold Open\" 02September 25, 2006 7.5 12 4.4 10.82 # 33 3 \"Focus Group, The\"\"The Focus Group\" 03October 2, 2006 6.0 10 3.5 8.85 # 47 4 \"West Coast Delay, The\"\"The West Coast Delay\" 04October 9, 2006 5.8 9 3.8 8.66 # 51 5 \"Long Lead Story, The\"\"The Long Lead Story\" 05October 16, 2006 5.3 8 3.1 7.74 # 55 6 \"Wrap Party, The\"\"The Wrap Party\" 06October 23, 2006 5.1 8 3.2 7.72 # 60 7 \"Nevada Day (1)\"\"Nevada Day (1)\" 07November 6, 2006 4.8 8 3.3 7.67 # 56 8 \"Nevada Day (2)\"\"Nevada Day (2)\" 08November 13, 2006 5.0 8 3.2 7.58 # 58 9 \"Option Period, The\"\"The Option Period\" 09November 20, 2006 4.7 8 3.1 7.17 # 60 10 \"B-12\"\"B-12\" 10November 27, 2006 4.8 8 3.3 7.27 # 60 11 \"Christmas Show, The\"\"The Christmas Show\" 11December 4, 2006 4.9 8 3.0 7.33 # 52 12 \"Monday\"\"Monday\" 12January 22, 2007 5.3 8 3.2 7.25 # 48 13 \"Harriet Dinner – Part I, The\"\"The Harriet Dinner – Part I\" 13January 29, 2007 4.8 7 3.0 6.86 # 53 14 \"Harriet Dinner – Part II, The\"\"The Harriet Dinner – Part II\" 14February 5, 2007 4.6 7 3.2 7.00 # 59 15 \"Friday Night Slaughter,The\"\"The Friday Night Slaughter\" 15February 12, 2007 4.3 7 2.8 6.39 # 68 16 \"4AM Miracle\"\"4AM Miracle\" 16February 19, 2007 4.1 7 2.6 6.10 # 63 17 \"Disaster Show, The\"\"The Disaster Show\" 17May 24, 2007 2.7 5 1.7 3.90 # 76 18 \"Breaking News\"\"Breaking News\" 18May 31, 2007 2.9 5 1.6 4.08 n/a 19 \"K&R – Part 1\"\"K&R\" 19June 7, 2007 3.1 5 1.7 4.35 # 66 20 \"K&R – Part 2\"\"K&R – Part II\" 20June 14, 2007 3.0 6 1.7 4.25 n/a 21 \"K&R – Part 3\"\"K&R – Part III\" 21June 21, 2007 3.0 5 1.8 4.42 # 53 22 \"What Kind of Day Has It Been\"\"What Kind of Day Has It Been\" 22June 28, 2007 2.7 5 2.0 4.20 n/a\n\nKey: Rating is the estimated percentage of all TVs tuned to the show, share is the percentage of all TVs in use that are tuned in.

These ratings, called \"live plus seven\", include all viewers who use a DVR to record the show and then watch it within a week of its initial airing.\n\nAccording to Nielsen, Studio 60 added nearly 11%, or almost a million viewers, to its total every week as a result of these \"live plus seven\" viewers.[53]\n\nAccording to Medialife Magazine, \"The live-plus-seven-day rating for NBC's Studio 60 on the Sunset Strip is 136% higher than its live rating in DVR homes.\"[54]\n\nAwards\n\n[edit]\n\nWins\n\n[edit]\n\n2006\n\nBroadcasting and Cable pool — Best Overall New Program.\n\n2007\n\nBanff World Television Festival — Continuing Series – for the episode \"Pilot.\"\n\nEmmy Awards — Outstanding Guest Actor in a Drama Series – John Goodman\n\nNominations\n\n[edit]\n\n2006\n\nSatellite Awards — Outstanding Actor in a Series, Drama – Matthew Perry\n\nSatellite Awards — Outstanding Actor in a Series, Drama – Bradley Whitford\n\nSatellite Awards — Outstanding Actress in a Series, Drama – Amanda Peet\n\nSatellite Awards — Outstanding Actress in a Series, Drama – Sarah Paulson\n\n2007\n\nEmmy Awards — Outstanding Directing for a Drama Series: Pilot, directed by Thomas Schlamme\n\nEmmy Awards — Outstanding Cinematography for a Single-Camera Series: Pilot\n\nEmmy Awards — Outstanding Casting for a Drama Series\n\nEmmy Awards — Outstanding Guest Actor in a Drama Series – Eli Wallach\n\nWriters Guild of America Awards — Best Overall New Program\n\nWriters Guild of America Awards — Episodic Drama – for the episode \"Pilot\", written by Aaron Sorkin\n\nDirectors Guild of America Awards — Outstanding Directorial Achievement in Dramatic Series, Night: for the episode \"Pilot\", directed by Thomas Schlamme\n\nGolden Globe Awards — Best Performance by an Actress in a Supporting Role in a Series, Mini-Series or Motion Picture Made for Television – Sarah Paulson\n\nArt Directors Guild — Excellence in production design single camera television series – for the episode \"Pilot\", Production Design by Carlos Barbosa\n\nAmerican Society of Cinematographers — episodic television – Thomas Del Ruth\n\nICG Publicists Awards — Outstanding Television Series\n\nHome media\n\n[edit]\n\nDVD release\n\n[edit]\n\nOn June 27, 2007, the day before the airing of the show's final episode, Warner Home Video announced an October 16 release date for the Studio 60 on the Sunset Strip: Complete Series DVD set.[55]\n\nAlternative availability\n\n[edit]\n\nNBC made the pilot episode of Studio 60 available on DVD to Netflix subscribers on August 5, 2006.
