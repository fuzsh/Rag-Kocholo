        "text": "The Art and Art Education program at Teachers College, Columbia University is dedicated to preparing art educators, teacher educators, and leaders in visual arts education. Our curriculum is designed so you can teach and lead programs wherever you go, whether that’s in a P-12 classroom, a museum, a community art center, a university, or beyond. Our dedicated studios—from drawing and painting to sculpture and new media and digital technologies—allow you to actively create art while you continue your studies. In fact, all of our degree tracks require studio work. We believe it’s in the studio that you develop new ways seeing, experiencing, and responding to the world allowing you to expand your expertise in teaching others to do so as well. This focus on the studio as teaching laboratory distinguishes our program within Teachers College Columbia University, one of the leading graduate schools of education in the world.\n\nStudents who wish to work with education initiatives in museums in the US and around the world may complete the Museum Education area of focus. This area of focus explores the art museum as a civic and educational institution, examines the role of museum education departments, and introduces students to innovative museum education programs and pedagogical practices.\n\nLearn More\n\nStudents who seek to sharpen their expertise designing pedagogically sound, imaginative studio art learning opportunities may complete the Art Pedagogy area of focus.
