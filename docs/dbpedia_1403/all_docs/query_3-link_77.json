        "text": "In 2024, there are plenty of open source chatbot platforms to choose from. The best one for you will depend on your chatbot-building needs - your experience, coding language, desired capabilities, and specific use case.\n\nWe've put together a list of the top open source chatbot platforms. Whether you're building on your own or for a company, you'll find a platform here that suits your project.\n\nWhat is an open-source chatbot?\n\nOpen-source chatbots are messaging applications that mimic human conversation. Open-source means the original code for the software is distributed freely and can easily be modified.\n\nOpen-source software leads to higher levels of transparency, efficiency, and control through shared contributions. This allows developers to create software of higher quality while increasing their knowledge of the software platforms themselves.\n\nâ\n\nAlternatively, there are closed-source chatbots software which we have outlined some pros and cons comparing open-source chatbot vs proprietary solutions.\n\nNow, letâs take a look at some of the best open-source chatbots in 2024.\n\n1. Botpress\n\nBotpress is an open-source conversational AI software that supports many Natural Language Understanding (NLU) libraries.\n\nBotpress is designed to build chatbots using visual flows and small amounts of training data in the form of intents, entities, and slots. This vastly reduces the cost of developing chatbots and decreases the barrier to entry that can be created by data requirements.\n\nBotpress has a visual conversation builder and an emulator to test your conversations. The built-in JavaScript code editor allows you to code actions that can be used to perform specific tasks. The NLU module lets you define intents, entities, and slots. This is how your conversational assistant can understand the input of the user.\n\nBotpress actively maintains integrations with the most popular messaging services including Facebook Messenger, Slack, Microsoft Teams, and Telegram.\n\nThe platform is primarily built for developers who need an open system with maximum control. However, it is also easy for a conversation designer to take over and collaborate with a developer on a project, thanks to the visual conversation builder.\n\nBotpress allows specialists with different skill sets to collaborate and build better conversational assistants.\n\nYou can read a comprehensive review of Botpress on G2 and Chatimize.\n\n2. Microsoft Bot Frameworkâ\n\nMicrosoft Bot Framework (MBF) offers an open-source platform for building bots.\n\nThe Microsoft approach is primarily code-driven and aimed exclusively at developers. The MBF gives developers fine-grained control of the chatbot building experience and access to many functions and connectors out of the box.\n\nThe MBF offers an impressive number of tools to aid the process of making a chatbot. It can also integrate with Luis, its natural language understanding engine.\n\nMicrosoft has also acquired Botkit, another open-source platform. Botkit is more of a visual conversation builder with a greater focus placed on the UI actions available to the user.\n\nMBF cannot be considered entirely open-source as the NLU engine it uses, Luis, is proprietary software. This may be an issue for you depending on your situation to have more control.\n\nA disadvantage of the NLU engine not being open-source is that it cannot be installed on-prem. This again is understandable from Microsoft as the MBF and Luis are products built-in part to promote the use of its Azure platform. Luis is a service that you pay for each API call, which can translate into a steep monthly bill.\n\n3. Botkitâ\n\nBotkit is now part of the Microsoft Bot Framework. It's known for being a code-centric platform made for developers.\n\nBotkit is just one part of a bigger set of developer tools and SDKs that encompass the Microsoft Bot Framework. The Bot Framework SDK provides the base upon which Botkit is built. It is available in multiple programming languages!\n\nIt has a large number of plugins for different chat platforms including Webex, Slack, Facebook Messenger, and Google Hangout.\n\nBotkit has recently created a visual conversation builder to help with the development of chatbots which allows users that do not have as much coding experience to get involved.\n\nBotkit uses Luis as its underlying NLU engine. However, it can be integrated with other NLU engines if necessary.\n\n4. Rasa\n\nRasa is an open-source bot-building framework that focuses on a story approach to building chatbots. Rasa is a pioneer in open-source natural language understanding engines and a well-established framework.\n\nThey focus on artificial intelligence and building a framework that allows developers to continually build and improve their AI assistants.\n\nInstead of defining visual flows and intents within the platform, Rasa allows developers to create stories (training data scenarios) that are designed to train the bot.\n\nRasa is on-premises with its standard NLU engine being fully open source. They built Rasa X which is a set of tools helping developers to review conversations and improve the assistant. Rasa also has many premium features that are available with an enterprise license.\n\nEvery chatbot platform requires a certain amount of training data, but Rasa works best when it is provided with a large training dataset, usually in the form of customer service chat logs. These customer service chats are parsed, organized, classified and eventually used to train the NLU engine.\n\nOne potential issue with the story approach is it can be difficult to predict what the bot is going to say at a given moment as no one has access to the underlying logic, it is a black box. The risk of this happening is reduced by having large amounts of high-quality training data.\n\n5. Wit.ai\n\nWit.ai is an open-source chatbot framework that was acquired by Facebook in 2015. Being open-source, you can browse through the existing bots and apps built using Wit.ai to get inspiration for your project.\n\nWit.ai has a well-documented open-source chatbot API that allows developers that are new to the platform to get started quickly.\n\nSince it is owned by Facebook, Wit.ai is a good choice if you are planning to deploy your bot on Facebook Messenger. Facebook makes it simple to deploy Wit.ai chatbots on Messenger.\n\nThe Natural Language Processing (NLP) engine in Wit.aiâs chatbot framework is robust and capable when compared to its competitors like Microsoft, Amazon and IBM.\n\nThe SDK for Wit.ai is available in multiple languages such as Python, Ruby, and NodeJS.\n\nWit.ai easily integrates with different platforms like Facebook Messenger, Slack, Wearable devices, home automation, and more.\n\nOne of the downsides of this framework is that the training can be quite laborious. It lacks the necessary amount of slots and parameters. To compensate for this you will need to use business logic to handle unstated information.\n\n6. OpenDialog\n\nOpenDialog is an enterprise-scale, open-source, conversational AI platform that started in 2018.\n\nWith OpenDialog you can deploy, integrate and train efficiently. Their smart conversation engine allows users to customize and integrate as required. The flexible NLU support means that you can use the best AI techniques for the problem at hand.\n\nOpenDialog also features a no-code conversation designer that allows users to design and prototype conversations quickly.\n\nYou can manage and future-proof your conversational AI strategy.\n\nThe open-source and easily extendable architecture supports innovation while the reusability of conversational components across solutions makes this a tool that scales with your team.\n\nOpenDialog's main features include:\n\nIts ability to perform real-time STT processes\n\nLow memory usage (Less than 64MB for 20,000 words)\n\nThe ability to produce N-best/Word-graph output\n\nThe ability to work as a server unit.\n\nWith this software, you can build your first conversational application easily without having any previous experience with a coding language.\n\nOpenDialog is a no-code platform written in PHP and works on Linux, Windows, macOS. OpenDialog is licensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0.\n\n7. Botonic\n\nBotonic is a react framework to build a conversational app. It is more than creating simple text-based chatbots.

Golem\n\nGolem is a python framework for building chatbots. It is built for python developers and it can easily extract entities from existing messages.\n\nIt features its own web GUI for ease of testing and can interact with messages from Messenger and Telegram.\n\nGolem is a language analysis technology with a linguistic universal approach. This positioning is significantly different from the two most common approaches in the NLU today:\n\nThe statistical approach (training of artificial neural networks)\n\nThe grammatical approach.\n\nThese two approaches have their strengths and their weaknesses.\n\nGolem.ai offers both a technology easily multilingual and without the need for training. The AI already has a knowledge of linguistics understanding, common to all human languages. The configuration only consists of describing the format of the expected elements (what are the purposes of action or interpretation, in the given context) and providing the specific business vocabulary. This technology has been developed after many years of experimentation, to find the easiest and most efficient way to configure an NLU AI.\n\nGolem is written in Python and works on Linux, Windows, and macOS. Golem is licensed under GPL-3.0 License.\n\nHow to Choose the Best Open-Source Chatbot Software for You?\n\nBefore deciding on the chatbot software you want to invest time and money in, you should understand how you plan on using it and what are the functionalities required for that. One of the great advantages of open-source is that you can experiment with the product before making a decision.\n\nWhile some companies have listed different use cases for their platform, it's not always the case. We highly recommend visiting the various chatbot forums and search for what you want to build. Chances are, someone else is doing it too. If not, ask questions.\n\nA summary is not enough information for you to make a decision, but it's a great starting point to perhaps eliminate some of the contenders and understand what are the strengths and weaknesses."
