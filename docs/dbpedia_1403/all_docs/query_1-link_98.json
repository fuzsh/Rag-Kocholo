We have millions of scanned pages, so user reports are incredibly helpful for us to identify places where we can improve and update the metadata.\n\nPlease describe the issue below, and click \"Submit\" to send your comments to our team! If you'd prefer, you can also send us an email to mhdl@commarts.wisc.edu with your comments.\n\nPlease describe the issue:\n\nWe use Optical Character Recognition (OCR) during our scanning and processing workflow to make the content of each page searchable.
