        "text": "Beneath the Gantry\n\nGumji Kang and Henry Williams\n\nStudio Description\n\nThe manufactured physicality of cities and the intensive material demands of contemporary human life stand in contrast with the immaterial labour of knowledge economies. For two centuries places of production have been migrating to the peripheries of our cities, addressing detrimental environmental impacts while disrupting many cultural and economic symbioses. In this research-driven studio students will critically appraise the challenges and opportunities of the reintegration of places of production into cities.\n\nStudio Outcomes\n\nAn initial research phase will encourage students to consider several theoretical/analytical viewpoints, each framing the project in a unique way;\n\nLive/work utopian speculation from the Industrial Revolution to the present;\n\nthe evolution of industrial typologies;\n\nurban human ecosystems\n\nIn parallel, students will work collaboratively to prepare a detailed investigation of the existing site, revealing evolving patterns of occupation and activity, a taxonomy of physical forms and traits, and a record of diverse narratives.\n\nFollowing these two preparatory phases students will undertake an individual design project within the broader studio site.\n\nStudio Leader\n\nGumji Kang is an architect based in Melbourne and has taught a number of architectural design studios at the University of Melbourne. Her interest lies in the architectural design strategies and interventions in the public space, and public architecture with a strong focus on research-driven practice.\n\nHenry Williams is a multi-disciplinary designer based in Adelaide and Melbourne working across architecture, exhibition, and object design. He previously worked for Sir David Chipperfield and Stanton Williams Architects in London, and between 2019 and 2021 was Architecture Lead at Snøhetta’s Australasian studio. Henry sits on the Design Review Panel at the Office for Design and Architecture SA (ODASA).\n\nReadings & References\n\nAldo Rossi, The Architecture of the City (MIT Press, 1984)\n\nAnthony Vidler, Claude-Nicolas Ledoux: Architecture and Utopia in the Era of the French Revolution (Birkhauser, 2021)\n\nJohn Ruskin, Unto This Last (J. Wiley & Sons, 1872)\n\nRobert Owen, A New View of Society and Other Writings (Penguin, 1991)\n\nABPL90438 Design Studio D is an Early start subject. An in-person Studio Presentation Day event will be held in the Hercus Theatre (L05), David Caro Building from 1pm-2pm on Tuesday 16th July followed by one-hour Q&A Session with Studio Leaders and Subject Coordinators in the MSD building. The Studio Ballot will be held online at the beginning of O-week, opening from 3pm Tuesday 16th July and closing at 3pm Wednesday 17th July. The outcome of Studio Allocation will be announced on Canvas before the end of Friday 19th July. There will be subject preparatory online work to be completed during this period before the semester commencement.\n\nSchedule:\n\nMonday 6:15pm-9:15pm in MSD 142\n\n&\n\nThursday 9:00am-12:00pm in MSD 142"
