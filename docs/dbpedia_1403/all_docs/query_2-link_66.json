        "text": "Know which language you registered for. All students registered for CSE1321/L will learn Python. Students registered for CSE1322/L will either learn Java (section names with a J in them, such as J01, WJ1 etc), or C# (Section names with a # in them such as #01, W#1 etc).\n\nFor online courses, you should be able tolog into D2L. Go ahead and log in.\n\nBuy a webcam if you do not already have one equipped on your computer or laptop.\n\nTheexpected workload of these courses is between 6-10 hours per week for a 16-week period. For summer courses, you canexpect to double that. Make sure you have (scheduled) time to complete the course.\n\nFind abackup Internet connection - which is critical for exam days! Some set up their phone as a \"hotspot\" while others hit the local coffee shop. You only have 2 hours for an exam, so think about this ahead of time.\n\nYou have a different lecture professor and lab instructor. Find out who both of them are and what their contact information is - which should be found in D2L.\n\nInstall an IDE (Integrated Development Environment) Right now, we're using PyCharm for Python, Visual Studio for C# arnd IntelliJ for Java.\n\nExplore this website - and pay special attention to the Resources page. Understand that we have tutoring, office hours, advising and so on. We also have additional help there.\n\nRead the syllabus and look at ourAcademic Policies. We have a really interesting Final Exam policy that you might like.\n\nGet familiar with the tech.\n\nGradescope is how you'll submit yourassignments and labs. We'll automatically add you, you don't have to do anything.\n\nD2L is what we use as the \"shell\" for the course. You should be able to log into that if you're enrolled in the class. You should see a syllabus quiz there,so complete that.\n\nOnline exams useRespondus andLockdown Browser, sowatch this 2-minute video.\n\nPractice coding; you'll start to see patterns. Yes, we have a practice bank. Becoming a good programmer is like becoming a good piano player. You can't just watch a teacher play, you have to play the instrument yourself. Practice builds confidence for exams as well.\n\nCheck your email. We send you things and you need to know about them.\n\nStart assignments early. Assignments are easier at the beginning of the semester than the end of the semester - becoming progressively harder. You'll have a higher shot at success if you start early.\n\nAsk questions. If you get stuck, ask questions. A rule of thumb is if you can't make even small progress in about 30-45 minutes, you should ask for help.\n\nDon't cheat. If things go well, you're going to graduate in 4 or 5 years. Chances are high that you'll have a technical job interview where they ask you to write code. If you didn't learn what you needed to in these classes, this will be a highly embarrassing time for you. We want you to get that high-paying job!\n\nLearn all you can andmaster the content to the point you can teach others. If you know the content and can teach others, consider becoming a Teaching Assistant (TA) here in the College of Computing and Software Engineering!\n\nThis course is an introductory computing principles course. Instruction centers on an overview of the history, scope, and impact of computing as well as critical, algorithmic and computational thinking on problem decomposition and fundamental programming concepts.\n\nStudents who complete this course successfully will be able to:\n\nSynthesize how software has influenced innovations in other fields and helped people, organizations, and society to solve problems.\n\nUse computational thinking to ask questions and find different ways to solve problems.\n\nDesign a solution to a problem as an algorithm and convert the algorithm into a procedural program.\n\nDescribe the differences between computing disciplines and identify possible job opportunities in the computing field."
