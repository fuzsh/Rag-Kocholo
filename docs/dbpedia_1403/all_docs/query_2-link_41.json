Previous challenges have been posed by organizations as diverse as the Robin Hood Foundation, Sidewalk Labs, Medium, Weight Watchers and Bloomberg.\n\nIn Startup Studio you and a team of your classmates will develop your own new product or startup idea. You’ll experience the entire process, from developing your idea, to prototyping and testing, to pitching to investors. You can even apply for a Startup Award that will provide funding and other support to help you turn your Startup Studio project to a real business.\n\nInnovating within a big company (BigCo) means building for millions and even billions. And that requires navigating complex cultures, pitching to the people who control budgets, and building projects to scale. You’ll learn these skills and more in this groundbreaking course, taught by execs from Google and Etsy, as you build, pitch, and present a working product to a real BigCo.\n\nIn PiTech Studio, you and a team of your classmates will have the opportunity to focus specifically on product development and business models that accelerate positive change— in public, non-profit, for-profit, and hybrid sectors. You will develop your own new product or start up idea with a societal lens, with a focus on under-resourced communities and needs in domains like education, public health, financial empowerment, poverty alleviation, climate change, and democracy.\n\nIn Startup Ideas you’ll go through the process of developing and refining thousands of business ideas in a mixed group of classmates from across Cornell Tech’s graduate programs, finally choosing one to pursue with your team in the Startup Studio.\n\nThis studio-based course covers the foundations of product development and management that you’ll put to immediate use in your Startup Studio projects. In each session, you’ll learn about a different aspect of product management, product design, or technology development."
