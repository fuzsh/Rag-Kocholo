        "text": "Shōgun, one of the most anticipated series of the year, is living up to the hype. The historical drama stars Hiroyuki Sanada (John Wick: Chapter 4) as Lord Yoshii Toranaga, a powerful daimyo in seventeenth-century feudal Japan who is involved in a power struggle for control of the country. The story is based on James Clavell’s 1975 novel. “It’s the next step in my life,” Sanada told Esquire about wrapping production on the FX series last spring. “It’s like I got a movie diploma.”\n\nAs Toranaga battles his political rivals, he starts an auspicious relationship with an English sailor named John Blackthorne (Cosmo Jarvis). Blackthorne offers to help him gain the shogunate and become the de facto ruler of Japan. Anna Sawai (Pachinko) also costars as Toda Mariko, a translator and devout Catholic who questions her faith after she develops feelings for the new arrival. Shōgun was last adapted back in 1980, with legendary Japanese actor Toshiro Mifune at the helm.\n\nFor more info about the ten-episode limited series, travel with us to the turn of the seventeenth century below.\n\nWhat Is Shōgun About?\n\nSimilar to Silence, the 1966 novel that Martin Scorsese adapted into a 2016 film, Shōgun begins with the introduction of Christianity to Japan. Blackthorne sails to the island nation to disrupt its relationship with Spanish and Portuguese Christians. The Englishman crosses paths with Toranaga after his ship is marooned off the coast of Japan. Toranaga’s rivals view Blackthorne as a heretic due to his Protestant faith—and his mere presence disturbs the group of elders who block the lord’s path to the shogunate.\n\nAfter episode 8, Toranaga’s back is up against the wall. His brother betrays him and forces him to surrender to the Council. But the war isn’t over. In episode 9, Toranaga sends Mariko to unleash his master plan on Osaka Castle. Now that we’re out of dead-bird controversies, we can finally reach the big finale.\n\n“I want to be a bridge between East and West,” Sanada told Esquire this past spring. “That’s my mission.”\n\nHow Can I Watch Shōgun?\n\nThe ten-episode limited series premiered its first two episodes on February 27. Each new episode is available to stream on both Hulu and Disney+ at 12:01 A.M. ET on its respective release date, before its FX premiere at 10:00 P.M. ET. The final episode airs on April 23. For a full schedule, check out the release dates of Shōgun’s episodes below.\n\nEpisode 1: “Anjin” — February 27\n\nEpisode 2: “Servant of Two Masters” — February 27\n\nEpisode 3: “Tomorrow Is Tomorrow” — March 5\n\nEpisode 4: “The Eightfold Fence” — March 12\n\nEpisode 5: “Broken to the Fist” — March 19\n\nEpisode 6: “Ladies of the Willow World” — March 26\n\nEpisode 7: “A Stick of Time” — April 2\n\nEpisode 8: “The Abyss of Life” — April 9\n\nEpisode 9: “Crimson Sky” — April 16\n\nEpisode 10: “A Dream of a Dream” — April 23"
