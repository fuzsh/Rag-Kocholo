But maybe that happens on all platforms?\n\nVerified G2 Review\n\nOur Experience\n\nSocialPilot is one of the best social media scheduling tools that lets users plan and schedule posts for multiple social media networks from a single dashboard. All its features are designed to simplify social media posting by automating the content publishing process. The platform’s user-friendly interface and cost-effective pricing make it a go-to scheduling tool among social media agencies and growing businesses, with over 13,000 users.\n\nHere are some of the advanced scheduling and publishing features that make it effortless to plan your content for all major social media networks.\n\nSeamless Social Media Publishing:\n\nSocialPilot has stood out as an ideal social media scheduling tool, offering advanced and seamless features for publishing content on all major networks. SocialPilot’s standout feature is an automated scheduling system, enabling automated content publishing through customized timetables. Using these pre-set scheduling slots automates the whole scheduling process. Rather than manually adding the date and time for a post, you can queue them, and the tool will post them at one of these ideal times. Other than this, staggered posting and repeating specific posts allow users to fully utilize their content’s worth on social media. Browser Extension from SocialPilot adds a layer of convenience to social media management. Users can quickly share and schedule posts directly from their browser, eliminating the need to switch between tabs or applications.\n\nAdvanced Content Calendar and Bulk Scheduling:\n\nRegarding content planning, Visual Content Calendar provides an intuitive overview, making it immensely helpful for users to manage their posts and reschedule with just a drag-and-drop. With these features, SocialPilot simplifies social media publishing, making it efficient and highly effective.\n\nWhile the calendar gives an overview of a month’s worth of content, bulk scheduling allows users to create and schedule several month’s worth of content. All SocialPilot needs is for users to upload a CSV file containing their content, account information, publishing dates, and times. After this, the tool will automatically schedule all your posts accordingly.\n\nAI Assistant and Content Management:\n\nSocialPilot’s AI Assistant elevates content creation and scheduling to new heights. This feature offers intelligent suggestions for post captions and well as hashtags, helping users craft engaging and relevant posts effortlessly. You can direct the AI-powered content generation with social-network specific prompt templates, tonal filters, language selection and much more. The hashtag generator comes close to suggesting contextually accurate in accordance to your caption to give it more reach and engagement.\n\nActing as the centralized archive is the Content Library that allows users to store, organize, and categorize their media files, ensuring easy access and retrieval. This feature supports various content formats, including text, images, and videos, and integrates seamlessly with the scheduling tools. Users can create content groups and tag media files for better organization.\n\nFlexible Approvals on the Go\n\nSocialPilot’s Approvals on the Go feature offers unparalleled flexibility for instantaneous content review and approval. This mobile-friendly tool allows users to review and approve posts from anywhere, ensuring a smooth workflow even when on the move. It supports real-time notifications and updates, keeping users informed of pending approvals. The feature integrates with the scheduling and content management tools, ensuring a seamless process. This flexibility makes SocialPilot an excellent choice for teams and agencies needing efficient and reliable content approval solutions.\n\nSocialPilot Pricing\n\nSocialPilot offers a 14-day free trial and access to all premium features (no credit card required &cancel any time). Choose a plan that fits your needs.\n\nAgency+\n\n$170.00/mo\n\nBilled annually\n\n50 Social Profiles\n\nUnlimited Users\n\nUnlimited Clients\n\nClient Approval\n\nContent Library\n\nWhite Label\n\nTRY FOR FREENo CC Required\n\nMOST POPULAR\n\nAgency\n\n$85.00/mo\n\nBilled annually\n\n30 Social Profiles\n\n6 Users\n\nUnlimited Clients\n\nClient Approval\n\nContent Library\n\nTRY FOR FREENo CC Required\n\nSmall Team\n\n$42.50/mo\n\nBilled annually\n\n20 Social Profiles\n\n3 Users\n\nContent Library\n\nTRY FOR FREENo CC Required\n\nProfessional\n\n$25.50/mo\n\nBilled annually\n\n10 Social Profiles\n\n1 User\n\nTRY FOR FREENo CC Required\n\nFinal Verdict:\n\nSocialPilot is the perfect solution for social media teams, businesses and agencies. With advanced scheduling features and collaborative workflows, users can manage their daily social media activities much efficiently.\n\nHootsuite\n\n$249\n\nfor 3 users\n\nBest social media scheduling tool for:\n\nProfessionals, Small teams, Small and medium-sized businesses, and Enterprises\n\nRatings:\n\n4.2/ 5 (G2), 4.4/ 5 (Capterra)\n\nApps:\n\nWeb, iOS, and Android versions\n\nIntegrations:\n\nFacebook, Instagram, X (Twitter), TikTok, LinkedIn, YouTube, Pinterest, Threads, Google Business Profile\n\nKey Features:\n\nSocial media content calendar\n\nBulk content scheduling\n\nBest time to post recommendations\n\nAI-assisted caption ideation generation\n\nHashtag suggestions\n\nCanva integration\n\nContent discovery\n\nEvergreen content recycling\n\nProgrammed holiday calendar\n\nPros\n\nAdvanced scheduling capabilities simplify content planning and posting, saving a significant amount of time.\n\nHootsuite’s AI integration gives recommendations to users during the process of content drafting.\n\nMartin Abdael C.\n\nHootsuite’s stream feature allows me to easily follow topics of interest and industry leaders. I currently have a stream for each of our social networks and find it extremely helpful to use! However, what I enjoy the most about Hootsuite is that it allows me to plan my month’s content by allowing me to visualise and schedule posts with its planner feature. Additionally, I save a lot of time by uploading content to multiple platforms and making edits on its publishing tool.\n\nVerified G2 Review\n\nCons\n\nThe feature-rich dashboard of the platform has a steep learning curve for beginner-level users.\n\nThe price for adding more users to your Hootsuite account more than doubles the cost of the current plan.\n\nSharon B.\n\nThe pricing is a lot higher. I do not see options to lower the social media profiles connected to a subscription. If you want to add someone to your profile you have to choose a subscription for three people per profile.\n\nVerified G2 Review\n\nOur Experience\n\nOver time, Hootsuite has evolved into a complete marketing suite, but at its core, the tool is still a social media scheduling app. It supports content publishing on all the major social media platforms, so users do not have to think about going to multiple websites to post their content.\n\nInitially, it’ll ask you to connect all those accounts (only public ones, not private ones) to Hootsuite. Once thats done, you can move on to creating those posts.\n\nThe tool comes up with the best time to post recommendations. If you schedule your post for this time, the probability is that your posts will get maximum reach and engagement. The calendar interface is another noteworthy feature in Hootsuite which is extremely useful to visualize your long-term content plan. Hootsuite being one of the best, boasts bulk scheduling of up to 350 posts on social media.\n\nSimilar to many of its competitors, Hootsuite has incorporated artificial intelligence into its platform with Owlywriter AI. This tool not only generates captions but also provides content ideas when inspiration is lacking. Hootsuite further supports users with visual content through Canva integration and an inbuilt stock image library.\n\nHootsuite offers a wealth of content possibilities for its users. Simply input a blog link, and the tool will transform it into social media posts. It can also analyze your content history to find top-performing posts and rephrase them for reposting, maximizing their impact. Additionally, with Hootsuite’s built-in list of holidays and festivals, you can effortlessly plan your content around key dates, ensuring you never miss an opportunity to engage your audience.\n\nPricing:\n\nHootsuite offers two pricing tiers after a 30-day trial, ranging from $99/month to $249/month. The custom plan caters to enterprises that can support upto 50 accounts to start with.\n\nOverall verdict:\n\nHootsuite is a capable social media scheduling tool that allows users to create and keep track of their content plan for multiple social accounts. It is equipped with many advanced features, like advanced scheduling, AI-assisted content generation, bulk scheduling, and more. However, its UI is less than user-friendly and has a steep learning curve. Also, Hootsuite proves to be well out of budget for solopreneurs and small businesses on a tight budget.\n\nBuffer\n\n$120\n\nfor 10 profiles\n\nBest social media scheduling tool for:\n\nSocial media managers, professionals, entrepreneurs, and small businesses\n\nRatings:\n\n4.3/5 (G2), 4.5/5 (Capterra)\n\nApps:\n\nWeb, iOS, Android App, Chrome Browser Extension\n\nIntegrations:\n\nFacebook, Google Business Profile, Instagram, LinkedIn, Mastodon, Pinterest, Shopify, Threads, TikTok, Twitter / X, YouTube\n\nKey Features:\n\nContent boards\n\nAI assistant for content ideation and creation\n\nContent categorization\n\nIntegration with Canva, Giphy, DropBox, One Drive, and Google\n\nCollaboration on content\n\nAutomated scheduling plan\n\nScheduling calendar\n\nCustom post creation\n\nPros\n\nThe easy-to-navigate post-publishing dashboard in Buffer requires little to no training to use efficiently.\n\nThe free AI integration in Buffer makes writing captions very easy and saves a lot of time.\n\nTracy W.\n\nBuffer is extensively used in our company in marketing and corporate communication departments. It enables users to schedule and track scheduled posts across all major social networks. The analytics are great that show the performance of each post and aslo buffer is pretty affordable.\n\nVerified G2 Review\n\nCons\n\nSome users have problems bulk-scheduling their posts with Buffer.\n\nVictory J.\n\nThe mobile app isn’t as seamless as the web version. I guess this isn’t an issue for many as most people prefer to work on their computers. I do a lot of repetitive tasks on the move so it kind of is a big deal for me.\n\nVerified G2 Review\n\nOur Experience\n\nIf you want to automate your content publishing activities on the maximum number of social media platforms, Buffer is a good option to go with. It’s a simple and straightforward social media scheduling tool ideal for beginners to manage their content publishing.\n\nOnce you connect all your social profiles to Buffer, creating posts is quite simple. The post composer allows you to create different versions of the same content for different social media channels with some help from the AI Assistant. The generative AI feature can tweak your content to cut it short, make it longer, or make different iterations. The hashtag manager also enables users to create, save, reuse, and optimize groups of hashtags for specific social media networks.\n\nThe recent update to Buffer has segregated content creation and publishing dashboards into two. Users can now create posts or save ideas, tagging them under custom categories. This makes the content creation process much swifter. Additionally, you and your team can openly collaborate on the whole process of content creation.\n\nThe scheduling dashboard in Buffer has content queues based on different categories. You can either see drafts or posts for every social account connected to the tool under separate tabs or access them according to their status; they are queued, drafted, or waiting for approval. The scheduling flow from this view is a bit confusing as it’s not very straightforward.\n\nThe calendar dashboard gives a bird’s eye view of all the drafts and scheduled posts in your queues. You can drag and drop items from one slot to another in case you want to reschedule a post. Here, you can create new posts, filter the view in different ways to locate gaps in your plan and mend them.\n\nPricing:\n\nBuffer provides a range of four pricing options along with a 14-day trial period for each. There is a free plan for beginners. Paid plans range from $6 a month for one account to a monthly $120 for 10 accounts.\n\nOverall verdict:\n\nBuffer is an uncomplicated, user-friendly tool with sufficient scheduling capabilities. However, the AI Assistant within the post composing window makes the experience of making posts within the tool highly convenient, with captions and ideas readily available. However, the restricted users in the plans on the lower tier are a bit of a problem. And the pricing which charges users per account can prove to be unsustainable for managing a higher number of social accounts.\n\nSendible\n\n$249\n\nper month\n\nBest social media scheduling tool for:\n\nMid-sized businesses, mid-sized agencies, and some enterprise brands.\n\nRatings:\n\n4.5/5 (G2), 4.6/5 (Capterra)\n\nApps:\n\nWeb, iOS, and Android versions\n\nIntegrations:\n\nTikTok, Instagram, Facebook, X (Twitter), LinkedIn, Google Business Profile, YouTube\n\nKey Features:\n\nMulti-format post scheduling\n\nGrouped posts for custom scheduling queues\n\nBulk scheduling content\n\nAI Assist for Caption generation\n\nContent management with social media calendar\n\nHoliday calendar\n\nIn-app image editor\n\nCanva support\n\nContent curation feeds\n\nContent approval workflow\n\nPros\n\nSendible’s shareable calendar simplifies collaborative planning and tracking of your social media strategy.\n\nSendible suggests optimal posting times, helping users schedule their social media content for maximum reach.\n\nDaisy R.\n\nI love that Sendible not only allows you to schedule content, but it also provides you with the most optimal posting times and can generate reports for you. My favourite feature about Sendible is also that it allows you to create a specific calendar preview for each of your clients.\n\nVerified G2 Review\n\nCons\n\nThe mobile version of Sendible lacks some of the advanced features available in the web version.\n\nThe tool does not support scheduling content on Pinterest.\n\nJessica E.\n\nSendible used to have Pinterest scheduling but the feature was taken away. I also wish that you could build reports that covered longer periods rather than just 90 days.\n\nVerified G2 Review\n\nOur Experience\n\nAt first glance, Sendible comes across as a very user-friendly tool that is simple to understand for beginners. It has some elaborate pricing plans that try to cater to a variety of users, be it individual creators or enterprises and agencies. The app comes across as one of the most intuitive options among social media scheduling tools, having the ability to publish social posts as well as blog posts.\n\nThe calendar is the first view users see upon signing in, displaying a summary of upcoming scheduled posts. With various filters, you can view content by profiles, creators, scheduled queues, etc., and segregate the calendar to show published posts, scheduled posts, or drafts. Additionally, the calendar highlights holidays, allowing users to click and access a smart compose box with ready-to-use images and hashtags for quick post creation.\n\nSmart queues are another one of Sendible’s notable functions. They are basically groups or categories of posts under which you can add content relevant to the queue. Now, each of these lists or queues can be set to auto-publishing, either in a shuffled or repetitive format.\n\nEach piece of content you create in Sendible can be assigned to a smart queue or saved in the content library. This library keeps stock of all types of content you save, including captions, hashtags, posts, ideas, or even blog posts. You can make these items into social media posts or publish blogs right from Sendible’s dashboard.\n\nBulk scheduling is another one of the advanced features in Sendible, which lets users create and schedule multitudes of posts. Sendible also offers content curation abilities where you can select categories to explore, blogs and news feeds, offering fresh content regularly to keep up your posting consistency.\n\nSendible’s AI Assist elevates the content creation process by generating well-crafted social media captions. For visual content, Sendible integrates with multiple platforms, including Canva, Google Drive, Dropbox, Pexels, and Giphy, allowing you to create or import images seamlessly into your posts.\n\nThe platform supports effective teamwork with features like task assignments, calendar sharing, and approval workflows, ensuring accountability and smooth task management. This is particularly beneficial in agency settings with multiple stakeholders involved in content approval.\n\nPricing:\n\nSendible provides five paid plan options, and instead of offering a free plan, it provides a 14-day free trial period. The plans range from Creator, priced at $29, Traction for $89, Scale for $199, Advanced for $240, to the last plan, Enterprise plan, which is priced at $750.\n\nOverall verdict:\n\nThere is no doubt that Sendible is one of the more intuitive social media scheduling tools. The multitude of features it provides for content management and maintaining posting frequency streamlines the user’s work and saves time on manual content creation. The only hiccup is that to work as a team and access those advanced features, you will need to pay a considerable amount. Also, the flow of storing content and using those items can be simplified a lot more to avoid confusion.\n\nAgorapulse\n\n$99\n\nfor 10 profiles\n\nBest social media scheduling tool for:\n\nAgencies, eCommerce, and Social Media-based businesses\n\nRatings:\n\n4.5/5 (G2), 4.6/5 (Capterra)\n\nApps:\n\nWeb version, Android and iOS apps\n\nIntegrations:\n\nFacebook, Instagram, X (Twitter), LinkedIn, Pinterest, TikTok, YouTube and Google Business Profile, Google Analytics\n\nKey Features:\n\nMulti-network scheduling\n\nCollaboration for content publishing\n\nAI Writing Assistant\n\nContent queues\n\nInstagram visual planning\n\nFirst comment scheduling\n\nPlatform-specific customizations\n\nPublishing in bulk\n\nCustom fields\n\nFacebook boost posting\n\nPros\n\nThe user-friendly interface simplifies the process of planning and scheduling content across various platforms, all within one central location.\n\nThe bulk scheduling feature saves lot of time for users by allowing them to schedule up to 200 posts in one go.\n\nSandra H.\n\nAgorapulse is incredibly intuitive and user-friendly, making it easy for me to schedule posts, engage with our audience, and track performance across multiple platforms. The reporting features are also robust, providing valuable insights.\n\nVerified G2 Review\n\nCons\n\nThe mobile app of Agorapulse is not as effective as its web version.\n\nThe platform often logs users out without them knowing, hindering the usage on the go.\n\nVerified User\n\nAgorapulse is incredibly intuitive and user-friendly, making it easy for me to schedule posts, engage with our audience, and track performance across multiple platforms. The reporting features are also robust, providing valuable insights.\n\nVerified G2 Review\n\nOur Experience\n\nAgorapulse is one of the more advanced social media scheduling platforms which can support overall social media marketing activities of businesses and agencies. It provides an integrated space for uniting all social profiles into one dashboard so the user can streamline post scheduling and publishing.\n\nHere’s our take on Agorapulse’s scheduling and publishing capabilities.\n\nAs far as dashboards go, Agorapulse has one of the most intuitive yet simple-to-use scheduling dashboards out there. After creating the original draft of the content, users can switch to the post preview of each social platform selected and make changes and customize it.\n\nWhen you set a post’s date and time, you can choose to recycle it. This means you can set multiple dates or the frequency of repeat posting. The calendar has several filters that help you clearly see what kind of content has been scheduled for which profile and what the status of these posts is.\n\nTo maintain consistency in publishing, Agorapulse allows you to create highly customized content groups or queues. You pre-set a schedule for each of these queues so that once you add content to them, Agorapulse keeps publishing these posts on autopilot. You can either add posts manually to these smart queues or import CSV files at once. Like many of its competitors, Agorapulse also allows bulk actions within the scheduling workflow, including bulk scheduling, bulk approvals, bulk assigning and deleting posts from the list view in the calendar dashboard.\n\nStaying current with trends, Agorapulse has integrated AI capabilities to save users time. Besides generating posts from prompts, it can refine manually written captions by adjusting the tone or changing the length. However, the tool has not yet developed the ability to generate posts or campaign ideas.\n\nWe all know just how important it is to publish error-free content on social media. Agorapulse has an in-built workflow that allows the creator of a post to assign it to other members of his team or even clients to approve their content. Until these assignees approve the relevant posts, they will not be ready to publish and remain stuck in the creation funnel. During the approval process, team members can communicate and exchange feedback with each other right within Agorapulse.\n\nPricing:\n\nAgorapulse offers one free plan and four paid plans with a 30-day free trial for each. The four paid plans are called Standard, Professional, Advanced, and Custom, ranging from $69 for Standard, $99 for Professional to $149 for Advanced, managing 10 social profiles. Additional profiles cost $15 each for every plan.\n\nOverall verdict:\n\nAgorapulse has many advanced publishing capabilities that help users create content and categorize it into publishing queues, which would automatically keep publishing content. The shared calendars, approval workflows and selective permissions make for seamless teamwork within the app. However, users do not have access to essential features such as the content library, publishing queues, and bulk publishing till they pay $149 under the Advanced plan. This somewhat hinders the users under the lower budgeted plans from leveraging the tool completely.\n\nSprout Social\n\n$249\n\nper user/month\n\nBest social media scheduling tool for:\n\nSocial media consultants, Mid and large-sized businesses, and enterprises\n\nRatings:\n\n4.4/5 (G2), 4.4/5 (Capterra)\n\nApps:\n\nWeb, iOS, Android versions and Sprout Social Chrome Extension\n\nIntegrations:\n\nFacebook, X, Instagram, LinkedIn, Threads, Pinterest, TikTok and YouTube\n\nKey Features:\n\nAI-enhanced caption suggestions\n\nOptimal publishing time options with ViralPost\n\nCollaborative calendar sharing\n\nAsset Library for content storage hub\n\nContent calendar download and share\n\nGlobal timezone selection for scheduling\n\nContent tagging\n\nOn-draft collaboration\n\nPros\n\nThe platform’s interface allows for the scheduling and content publishing of muti-le social media accounts which saves a lot of time for users.\n\nThe publishing feature provides various tools to easily optimize your posting schedule across multiple social media networks.\n\nKathryn R.\n\nWe LOVE that we can access all platforms of social media through Sprout Social and that we are able to manage our posts & quickly and easily! We don’t have to have multiple windows open and the process has been so seemless compared to the way we used to have to manage our pages! The support is amazing and we use Sprout Social all throughout our day and week – We are so thankful it has been a smooth transition and has been simple for our colleagues to understand how to post as well. Thank you!\n\nVerified G2 Review\n\nCons\n\nThe pricing model, based on a per-user rate, can be costly and may not be ideal for large companies.\n\nThe interface does not support the reuse of content across different social media platforms, limiting customization options.\n\nChelsea S.\n\nA LOT of features (including some of the best features Sprout has to offer) are hidden behind levels of payment. It’s super pricey, even just for basic plans with basic features. Plus, the mobile app needs help. It seems there’s always a glitch with the mobile app – captions not copying when you go to IG to post, long loading time for mobile publisher posts.\n\nVerified G2 Review\n\nOur Experience\n\nSprout Social is a versatile tool which is capable of publishing content across multiple social media platforms from a central dashboard. It has multiple tools to boost social selling with paid campaign management, product promotion and ROI tracking. But as far as content creation and auto-scheduling goes, this was our experience with the Sprout Social.\n\nSprout Social’s content calendar and scheduling posts feature provide a comprehensive view of upcoming and published content, even those not created on Sprout Social. Users can create, edit, and reschedule posts using multiple filters, though it lacks drag-and-drop functionality for easy rescheduling.\n\nThe composing window allows customization for various platforms, but options are limited, and captions cannot be tailored differently for each platform. The Optimal Send Times feature, leveraging 16 weeks of audience data, significantly boosts content visibility by pinpointing the best times to post for maximum engagement.\n\nContent curation and Sprout Queues enhance content strategy by offering the Find Content feature, where users can browse categories or search keywords to find and repost relevant content. Monitoring feeds for hashtags, X (Twitter) feeds, and RSS feeds provides additional content streams. Integration with Canva, Google Drive, and other resources allows seamless export of visual assets for posts, though it lacks stock image integration. Sprout Queues enable users to create custom publishing plans for each connected account, automating post publishing.\n\nCollaborative features in Sprout Social support larger teams with custom workflows, including an approval process and a shared content calendar. These calendars can be downloaded, shared, and scheduled for external collaborators, ensuring effective teamwork and a consistent content strategy.\n\nThe platform’s AI capabilities assist in content creation but are limited compared to competitors. The AI Assist can create three iterations of a caption and adjust the tone in three ways, though it doesn’t aid in content ideation. Despite this, Sprout Social offers valuable tools for managing and optimizing social media content across multiple platforms.\n\nPricing:\n\nSprout Social has three paid plans starting from $249 per user every month to manage five social profiles. The other two plans come at $399 and $499 per user/month to manage an unlimited number of social profiles.\n\nOverall verdict:\n\nIn essence, Sprout Social’s scheduling and publishing features are more than adequate for any social media marketer to manage their content publishing for multiple platforms. However, the absence of advanced AI assistance, dynamic post customization, and stock media assets somewhat hinders the seamlessness of content creation. Also, some of the most essential features of the tool, like bulk scheduling, feed publishing, content tagging, and the best time to post recommendations, are not available in the Standard plan, which puts some users on a tight budget, making it unsuitable for smaller businesses.\n\nCoschedule\n\n$54\n\nmonth for 10 profiles\n\nBest social media schduling tool for:\n\nIndividuals, SMBs, and Agencies\n\nRatings:\n\n4.5/5 (G2), 4.4/5 (Capterra)\n\nApps:\n\nWeb, iOS, and Android versions\n\nIntegrations:\n\nFacebook, Instagram, X (Twitter), LinkedIn, Pinterest, TikTok, Google Business Profile, Mastodon, Bluesky\n\nKey Features:\n\nIntuitive social media content calendar\n\nAI social assistant\n\nDrag-and-drop rescheduling\n\nRequeing for consistent publishing\n\nBulk social post upload\n\nMulti-format project management\n\nPros\n\nThe Marketing Calendar from Coschedule is excellent for crafting and managing multiple marketing campaigns in a single location.\n\nMultiple team members can access and work on the calendar together, facilitating easier collaboration and communication about content.\n\nThis tool integrates seamlessly with WordPress, simplifying the planning, publishing, and promotion of blog posts and social media messages.\n\nVerified User\n\nOne of the standout features of the CoSchedule Marketing Suite is the content calendar. This tool allows me to plan ahead and organize my content in one place, making it easy to see what’s coming up and ensure that I’m staying on track with my publishing schedule. I also appreciate the ability to collaborate with team members on the calendar, which helps ensure everyone is on the same page.\n\nVerified G2 Review\n\nCons\n\nThe calendar overview can become cluttered when tracking scheduled posts across multiple platforms and accounts, making navigation difficult.\n\nThe steep learning curve can pose a challenge for established teams, making adoption more difficult.\n\nCamila C.\n\nThe calendar dashboard makes it easy to see visually where your social posts are and how full your days are. This platform is good if you don’t have a lot of social channels to monitor or send out a lot of posts. I found it difficult to keep track of what platforms had posts scheduled on a specific date when there were a lot of posts scheduled. We color-coded our posts for each platform, but I wish there was an easy way to filter them.\n\nVerified G2 Review\n\nOur Experience\n\nCoSchedule, primarily a calendar tool, offers extensive functionality, including social media post-scheduling, team collaboration, project management, and marketing strategy organization. Focusing on CoSchedule’s social calendar, it excels in social post-scheduling and management.\n\nThe AI Social Assistant on the other hand , it crafts engaging posts with over 500 AI-generated prompts. These prompts aid in developing creative campaign and ad copies, tailored for different audiences and objectives. Pre-designed templates simplify the process of creating cohesive and professional social campaigns, catering to various post types and ensuring a consistent brand voice across all channels.\n\nThe Social Campaigns feature, available in higher customizable plans, allows users to categorize and group social media posts into separate campaigns. This segmentation aids in monitoring ventures and their outcomes, making it easier to measure strategy effectiveness.\n\nThe biggest asset of CoSchedule is its highly intuitive calendar dashboard, enabling users to visualize their entire social strategy in one place. Adjustments can be made with simple drag-and-drop actions, efficiently optimizing the content timeline. Users can change the view to selective time frames, create and schedule posts, and add notes and to-do tasks all from the calendar.\n\nContent pieces scheduled natively, not through CoSchedule, will also appear on the calendar if the social account is connected, allowing complete control over all marketing ventures. Users can create pre-planned posting plans and schedule up to 365 posts at once, ensuring consistency across all social media pages without the need for regular manual posting.\n\nCoSchedule’s ReQueue feature is exceptional, as it intelligently suggests the best times to repost evergreen, top-performing content. This maximizes the content’s lifespan and engagement without requiring manual intervention. By automating this process, ReQueue significantly reduces users’ workloads and enhances content publishing consistency.\n\nPricing:\n\nCoSchedule offers a free plan and three paid subscription. The Marketing Calendar plan, priced at $29 per month, allows you to connect up to 10 social media profiles. You will need to contact its customer support to opt for its Content Calendar plan and Marketing Suite plan.\n\nOverall verdict:\n\nAs far as versatility goes, CoSchedule is limited to content management. However, as one of the social media scheduling tools, it is excellent in cetralizing all your content related tasks into one user-friendly dashboard. Along with having all the functions needed by marketers, it also comres at very convenient prices, although some of its more advanced features are only available for the enterprise level plans which have a considerably higher price.\n\nZoho Social\n\n$320\n\nmonth for 5 users\n\nBest social media scheduling tool for:\n\nSmall to medium-sized businesses, digital marketing agencies\n\nRatings:\n\n4.6/5 (G2), 4.7/5 (Capterra)\n\nApps:\n\nWeb, iOS, and Android versions\n\nIntegrations:\n\nFacebook, X (formerly Twitter), LinkedIn, Instagram, Google Business Profile, YouTube, Pinterest, TikTok, and Mastodon\n\nKey Features:\n\nIntuitive social media planner\n\nCollaborative draft editing\n\nSmartQ for optimal posting times\n\nRSS feed integration\n\nBulk post scheduling\n\nStreamlined team collaboration\n\nAI-powered content creation\n\nPros\n\nEffortless post customization for each social media channel.\n\nThe SmartQ feature identifies the optimal time slots for scheduling social media posts.\n\nZoho Social streamlines the content approval process, reducing time spent on back-and-forth communication when collaborating with a team.\n\nShane O.\n\nIt’s a one-stop shop for all your social media needs. They also do a fantastic job of attempting to give you a one-size-fits-all option for posting, and if the image or text body is too long, they will let you know what social media platform will have an issue and a solution to fix it.\n\nVerified G2 Review\n\nCons\n\nThere are a few glitchs in the tool when bulk scheduling is concerned.\n\nFor small businesses, the pricing structure is not as accommodating and affordable.\n\nDonzell R.\n\nThe formatting for mass post scheduling uses wonky formatting for the date that isn’t organic to excel.\n\nVerified G2 Review\n\nOur Experience\n\nZoho Social is a versatile tool for businesses and agencies managing multiple clients and social media accounts. It features tiered pricing plans and a simple design, making it easy for new users to navigate. Zoho Social streamlines creating, scheduling, and publishing custom posts across various channels.\n\nThe calendar view lets you see all drafted and scheduled content, allowing easy drag-and-drop reorganization. The platform supports direct scheduling with unique publishing times or pre-set schedules. The SmartQ feature analyzes audience engagement to recommend the best times to post, optimizing reach by timing posts for peak activity.\n\nThe platform enhances team collaboration, enabling multiple users to manage tasks effortlessly. Users can assign roles, manage permissions, and approve posts to ensure a consistent brand voice. Team members can collaborate on drafts, with all relevant communication contained within Zoho Social. Clients can be included in the workflow with restrictive access via read-only calendars, and team members stay updated with convenient in-app notifications.\n\nZoho Social integrates Zia, Zoho’s AI assistant, offering advanced features like creating custom posts for each platform, rephrasing pre-written copies, and generating multiple variations for captions. Zia suggests apt images matching keywords within the text and optimal replies to user comments, maintaining active engagement without manual input. This comprehensive approach makes Zoho Social a powerful tool for efficient and effective social media management, catering to diverse user needs while ensuring a consistent and engaging online presence.\n\nPricing:\n\nZoho Social has divided its pricing plans into two segments – Businesses and Agencies. The lowest plan starts at $15/month, while the highest plan goes up to $460/month.\n\nOverall verdict:\n\nZoho Social comes equipped as a complete social media scheduling platform. It has many advanced tools to streamline the process of creating, customizing, and scheduling your posts to be published at the best times to get the highest engagement. The usage of the tool also is much easier than many of its kind. However, the agency and enterprise plans that allow more users to work as a team in a Zoho Social account are not easily affordable for smaller or growing businesses.\n\neClincher\n\n$65\n\nmonth for 10 profiles\n\nBest social media scheduling tool for:\n\nSmall teams, Small-medium businesses, and Enterprises\n\nRatings:\n\n4.6/5 (G2), 4.7/5 (Capterra)\n\nApps:\n\nWeb, iOS, and Android versions\n\nIntegrations:\n\nFacebook, Instagram, X (Twitter), LinkedIn, Pinterest, Google Business Profile, Pinterest, YouTube, TikTok\n\nKey Features:\n\nScheduling and automated publishing\n\nConsolidated content library\n\nContent discovery and curation\n\nCollaboration workflow\n\nBusiness listing management\n\nLocal SEO optimization\n\nPros\n\neClincher provides a comprehensive suite of features designed to support multiple facets of social media management, making it a highly versatile tool.\n\nThe approval feature in eClincher simplifies the process of obtaining client approvals for content, ensuring timely publication.\n\neClincher integrates with numerous tools to enhance workflow efficiency and create a more seamless experience.\n\nScott W.\n\neClincher has the widest selection of features.

Once we got to that point, the system was always buggy, and the support started to lack. We’d have problems and issues, and support couldn’t help us out. Most times, it felt like we’d ask them something, and they couldn’t comprehend what the issue was; it was kind of frustrating.\n\nVerified G2 Review\n\nOur Experience\n\neClincher is a multi-purpose tool which is especially equipped to help local and multi-locational businesses to strengthen their search engine discoverability and social presence.

Forget cumbersome spreadsheets and shared drives, Sked has not only been a time-saver but is also an exceptional way to streamline the social media scheduling process. I love how user friendly it is and their support staff are great also. I frequently use Sked to schedule post across multiple companies and platforms.\n\nVerified G2 Review\n\nCons\n\nThe pricing model can get costly for users wanting to manage higher number of accounts with Sked Social.\n\nThere are occasional failures in publishing Instagram posts with tags and alt texts.\n\nGeorgia H.\n\nI dislike that I can’t choose a frame from a Reel to post to Instagram. I don’t post Reels using SKED because I have to do the finishing touches manually.\n\nVerified G2 Review\n\nOur Experience\n\nSked Social is a popular social media scheduling tool that offers a wide range of publishing and content automation features, including post-scheduling, AI post creations, team collaboration, and more. It boasts a few Instagram-specific publishing features but is equally proficient with maintaining consistency on other platforms as well.\n\nSked Social’s scheduling features simplify managing social media content across multiple platforms. Users can create and customize content for each network and schedule posts simultaneously, with options to set specific dates and times for auto-publishing to optimize audience engagement.\n\nThe intuitive, user-friendly scheduler interface streamlines maintaining an active social media presence. With customizing posts for multiple channels, users can tailor captions, links, and other elements to suit each platform, enhancing engagement. Features like Instagram’s First Comment and TikTok’s cover tile selection maximize post impact.\n\nThe visual planning with calendar view helps users visualize content plans, reschedule posts by dragging and dropping, and import regional holiday calendars for timely festive posts. The calendar also aids team collaboration, allowing shared work on drafts and timely approvals. The Instagram grid view enables users to plan and rearrange posts for aesthetic appeal.\n\nSked Social’s Captivate AI supports content creation by generating ideas, content pillars, and captions. It can rephrase older posts and pull ideas from competitors for high-performing campaigns. Sked Social also helps locate user-generated content using mentions and tags, repost viral posts with trending hashtags, and gain added engagement.\n\nThe social media team collaboration & approvals tool offers a customizable workflow for teams and agencies managing client accounts. It includes multiple stages of approval, tracking content every step of the way, and facilitating communication through exclusive threads linked to particular posts or drafts. Comments can be shared with the team or clients, making it ideal for larger teams with complex review requirements.\n\nPricing:\n\nThe starting plan in Sked Social costs $59 per month to manage three social accounts. The next two higher plans range from $199 to $349 per month for six and ten accounts, respectively.\n\nOverall verdict:\n\nSked Social is an excellent social media scheduling software that allows teams to collaboratively create and publish content for their own brand or for clients. The content creation, customization, and robust collaboration capabilities make for a great user experience. The tool does not limit users in regards to the number of team members they can add to their Sked Social account. However, the number of social accounts is limited, and connecting additional profiles costs more. This pricing model might not be sustainable for smaller teams and agencies functioning on a tight budget.\n\nLater\n\n$80\n\nper month for 6 users\n\nBest social media scheduling tool for:\n\nCreators, freelancers, agencies, social media managers, and small businesses.\n\nRatings:\n\n4.5/5 (G2), 4.4/5 (Capterra)\n\nApps:\n\nWeb, iOS, and Android versions\n\nIntegrations:\n\nInstagram, TikTok, Facebook, Pinterest, YouTube, LinkedIn, and X (Twitter)\n\nKey Features:\n\nAuto publishing and bulk scheduling\n\nBest time to post recommendations (for Instagram and TikTok)\n\nMedia library with content labeling\n\nHashtag suggestions\n\nInstagram Visual planner\n\nCuration of UGC\n\nPros\n\nLater enables users to schedule months’ worth of content in one go which saves a lot of time and effort for users.\n\nThe ability to upload and store media assets like images and videos in bulk to be used later makes for great content management.\n\nJulianna O.\n\nI love using Later for social media scheduling! My small business uses it for Instagram ad Facebook scheduling daily. Thanks to Later, we are able to schedule out a months worth of content in just a few hours saving us hours and hours every week. It’s so easy to use, easy to check the traction of a post, and helps us stay sane during busy season when social media is the last thing we want to worry about.\n\nVerified G2 Review\n\nCons\n\nLater interrupts video posting when there are size issues, requiring users to manually edit the videos outside the platform and reschedule them.\n\nLater does not provide adequate analytics for Facebook and LinkedIn.\n\nHayley S.\n\nI love the ease of use, the calendar feature, the option to copy a post to another channel, the option to filter through unused photos, analytics and the option to see all posts our company has been tagged in.\n\nVerified G2 Review\n\nOur Experience\n\nLater can be called a complete social media scheduling tool but the truth is that it hosts a whole package of Instagram-specific features which it does not provide for other platforms. Although as far as social media scheduling is concerned, it more or less is capable enough to handle post publishing on all platforms.\n\nBy allowing users to drag and drop media directly into a calendar, it makes scheduling easy. This feature helps organize and automate post publishing at optimal times, ensuring a consistent online presence without the need for real-time posting.\n\nBulk posting is another important aspect of scheduling through Later. Users can create and record hundreds of social media posts within a CSV file which then can be fed into Later’s scheduler. This leads you all these posts being scheduled into your social accounts in just a few clicks.\n\nThe Instagram Visual Planner tool lets you curate your social media feeds aesthetically by visually arranging upcoming posts. This feature is essential for Instagram marketing, where the visual layout of the feed influences viewer engagement. You can drag and drop posts to preview how they’ll look before they go live, ensuring your feed maintains a cohesive visual style.\n\nMedia Library is a dedicated space in the app where you can upload and store your images, graphics, and videos and access them from all your devices where Later is logged in to create a posts with them. You can label these assets to organize and access them better.\n\nLater allows users to access user generated content across Instagram using tags, mentions or social profiles. You can also track posts published by other accounts with trending or relevant hashtags which they can repost for boosting the reach and engagement of their own content.\n\nThe hashtag suggestions in Later can come up with effective options for you to add to your posts rather than using the same hashtags everytime. You can give the tool a few of your go-to hashtags and it will come up with many recommendations with their relevance levels helping you make the right choice.\n\nPricing:\n\nLater presents three subscription choices, each accompanied by a 14-day complimentary trial period. The system presents a no-cost option, followed by paid levels starting with Starter, valued at $25, Growth at $45, and the final choice, the Advanced option, priced at $80.\n\nOverall verdict:\n\nLater, with its streamlined UI and robust scheduling features helps in automating social media publishing. Its UGC content curation capabilities help users leverage online trends and also analyze the audience sentiments about their brand. However, its more advanced capabilities are centered around Instagram which might prove insufficient for brands looking to establish an omnipresent image on all social networks. Also for teams and agencies using the tool, they might feel the lack of collaboration workflows which are necessities to efficiently work together.\n\nPlanable\n\n$26\n\nfor 10 accounts\n\nBest social media scheduling tool for:\n\nMulti-locational brands, Agencies and multi-brand teams\n\nRatings:\n\n4.6 (G2)\n\nApps:\n\nWeb version\n\nIntegrations:\n\nInstagram, Facebook, X (Twitter), LinkedIn, Google Business Profile, YouTube, TikTok Pinterest\n\nKey Features:\n\nContent Calendar\n\nInstagram grid view\n\nAI caption generator\n\nContent categorization\n\nCustomization of workspace time zone\n\nMulti-platform content publishing\n\nApproval workflows\n\nGranular access control\n\nFeedback and communication thread\n\nSegregated workspace\n\nPros\n\nThe tool is very easy to use right from the get-go.\n\nThe customer support is readily available and tend to quick query resolution.\n\nMichelle C.\n\nThe platform is easy to use, quick to learn and helpful to manage various accounts. You really get your money’s worth with all that you can do with Planable. Customer Support has been helpful when needed and I never have to worry about waiting too long for an answer or assistance. The AI feature to clean up a posts is very helpful and takes the pressure of coming up with attention grabbing captions off of me.\n\nVerified G2 Review\n\nCons\n\nThe platform supports scheduling first comment only for Facebook and Instagram.\n\nA higher number of users and accounts cost considerably more.\n\nVerified User\n\nThere’s some features missing per platform, that I would’ve liked to see. For example: posting a first comment under a post seems to only be available with Facebook and Instagram. Also, adding a linked song to a TikTok-post would be great, since I’m a music artist who’d like to connect each post to their own song within TikTok. But I understand that these are small and quite specific features, so it doesn’t stop me from using Planable. The good outweighs these small shortcomings.\n\nVerified G2 Review\n\nOur Experience\n\nAt first glance, Planable seems like a very focused tool in terms of functionality. All its capabilities revolve around creating, storing, and scheduling content to be published consistently. The main dashboard of Planable, the calendar, is where you will find all of your scheduled content laid out according to its publishing date and time.\n\nYou can change the calendar view into a feed, list or grid view. The grid view for Instagram pages helps users aesthetically visualize their posts on the accrual network after being published. Clicking on a certain date will enable you to create posts and drag and drop functions allow easy rescheduling.\n\nThere are many more filters which you can use such as post status, feedback activity, labels, post type, time period, author, etc. You can control rescheduling with drag-and-drop and the visibility of content with specific filters. You can access the media library, saved posts archieve, access team members, add pages and compose new posts.\n\nThe post-creation process in Planable is quite simple, with all the means and assets readily available. The AI caption writer provides social media-ready content right within the composer, which can be tweaked and edited per requirement, saving a lot of time and brainstorming effort. Although this feature does not provide ideas for campaigns and is not very intuitive with prompts, it gets the job done. A convenient functionality in all this, especially for multi-locational businesses, is that you can set custom scheduling time zones.\n\nPlanable allows custom setup of multiple levels of social content approvals which allows posts generated to be crafted to perfection. Once the approval criteria are met, the scheduled posts can be locked so no more unprecedented changes can be made to them.\n\nPricing:\n\nPlanable’s Basic plan starts from $13 per user managing four social profiles. The Pro plan comes at a cost of $26 per user managing 10 social media profiles.\n\nOverall Verdict:\n\nPlanable is social media scheduling tool for agencies and small businesses which focuses on content and campaign management. The conducive environment where content feedback can be exchanged and their visibility restricted is perfect for teams to work seamlessly. However, the pricing model makes affording the management of multiple accounts possible only for larger businesses.\n\nLoomly\n\n$42\n\nmonth for 10 accounts\n\nBest social media scheduling tool for:\n\nSMBs, franchises, and marketing agencies\n\nRatings:\n\n4.6/5 (G2), 4.7/5 (Capterra)\n\nApps:\n\nWeb, iOS, and Android app versions\n\nIntegrations:\n\nFacebook, X (Twitter), LinkedIn, Instagram, Google Business Profile, YouTube, Pinterest, TikTok\n\nKey Features:\n\nIndividual calendars for various clients\n\nIdeas for content creation\n\nTips for optimizing posts\n\nLoomly’s media library\n\nWorkflow for approvals\n\nPros\n\nThe calendar feature provides an organized and visually attractive overview of your entire month’s posting plan at a glance.\n\nYou can effortlessly categorize your posts into different sections for improved content planning and analysis.\n\nThe tool’s platform-specific customization feature offers essential flexibility.\n\nRebekah N.\n\nThe Calendar view is very nice. It allows you to view your social media posts throughout the month and to drop and drag posts to different days if you find that you are heavy in one area and light in another. It also lets you categorize your posts so that you can get a report of how many posts in each category you have hit throughout the month. It’s also very intuitive and easy to use.\n\nVerified G2 Review\n\nCons\n\nLinkedin document publishing is not available.\n\nThere some problems while posting large media files.\n\nAmanda B.\n\nIt does not full sync with Instagram and some of the platforms. For example, I had a long video that would post just fine to all of the platforms, but not via Loomly. There’s a lot of back and forth.\n\nVerified G2 Review\n\nOur Experience\n\nLoomly is a social media scheduling tool equipped with advanced features for content creation, scheduling automation, performance analytics, and more. Unlike other platforms, Loomly’s basic plan accommodates two users and is available at a very reasonable price.\n\nLoomly streamlines social media publishing with a user-friendly interface for planning and scheduling posts across multiple channels. Its content calendar offers daily inspiration and supports media uploads from Canva and Google Drive.\n\nWith Post Optimization Tips and a built-in image editor, you can refine and enhance your posts directly within the platform.

Real-time collaboration lets multiple users work on posts simultaneously, providing instant feedback and edits. The platform’s media asset management centralizes storage, making it easy to upload, categorize, and organize files, and includes an image and video editor for quick adjustments.\n\nLoomly excels in campaign management by allowing post-categorization with labels and offering visual overviews to track performance using real-time data. Collaboration and approvals are efficient with multi-level custom workflows, real-time commenting, and post-history tracking. Team members can have restricted access, ensuring content standards are met before going live. Additionally, you can get an entire month’s content approved at once, ensuring the timely delivery of perfect posts.\n\nPricing:\n\nLoomly has 4 paid plans, ranging from $42/month to $369/month, catering to different social accounts and user needs.\n\nOverall verdict:\n\nLoomly is a true social media team tool, with even the pricing plans supporting 10 social media profiles and two users under even the most basic plan. Its advanced content creation capabilities help users create the best possible version of their content for higher engagement.\n\nCloud Campaign\n\n$42\n\nmonth for 10 accounts\n\nBest social media scheduling tool for:\n\nAgencies\n\nRatings:\n\n4.9/ 5 (G2)\n\nApps:\n\nWeb version\n\nIntegrations:\n\nX (Twitter), Pinterest, Facebook, Google Business Profile, Instagram, and LinkedIn\n\nKey Features:\n\nDashboard customization\n\nContent recommendation\n\nCanva integration\n\nRSS feed scheduling\n\nBulk content import\n\nPexels stock media library\n\nCategorized drip campaigns\n\nDrag and drop post scheduling\n\nSeamless client approvals\n\nPros\n\nThe platform is easily navigable and straightforward.\n\nThe approval system uncomplicated the client participation into the workflow of social media scheduling.\n\nValerie T.\n\nOur clients love the approval process, it is stellar! Internally, we love the approval proess too; but also, the evergreen function, the ease of use and the continual improvement by adding new features. And, the customer support is outstanding.\n\nVerified G2 Review\n\nCons\n\nUsers have sometimes faced scheduling problems in the calendar interface.\n\nPatrick M.\n\nI like most of it. At times the calendar schedling frustrates me as I want to change times of a post, after I dragged the social on the calendar. Accessing older content is challenging, but then again, I am not a pro.\n\nVerified G2 Review\n\nOur Experience\n\nCloud Campaign is another proficient social media scheduling tool for agencies and smaller businesses. It also integrates into other SAAS software as a social media scheduling and management functionality with a fully customizable appearance.\n\nThe tool has a dedicated caption generation tool, CaptionAI that creates custom content for specific platforms. Content generated from this is crafted in a certain tone, which you can either select or customize by yourself. This AI feature is especially useful for creating drip-campaigns. You can generate multiple versions of the same post and recycle them so fresh content is published on your profiles regularly.\n\nCreating content with Cloud Campaign is a breeze, thanks to its intuitive design and advanced features. RSS feed scheduling allows for consistent auto-publishing, while bulk content uploads into the media library keep your assets organized in neat folders. You can search connected Instagram accounts or use keywords for content recommendations to repurpose and publish.\n\nThe Pexels and Canva integrations provide stock images and custom designs without needing external storage. Custom scheduling sequences make regular content posting effortless. Drag and drop content from the library onto the calendar for optimal posting times or choose specific times for maximum engagement.\n\nClient coordination is simplified with custom approval links, allowing external stakeholders to inspect and approve posts without logging in. Each post includes a dedicated space for feedback and comments, streamlining the approval process.\n\nPricing:\n\nThe starting price of Cloud Campaign is $49 for the Freelancer plan. The advanced plans Studio and Agency cost $229 and $349 respectively.\n\nOverall Verdict:\n\nCloud Campaign is an efficient tool that has a streamlined workflow and helps set up automated scheduling plans that keep publishing content without needing much interference. But Cloud Campaigns lacks some of the vital platform-specific customization capabilities. This can be interpreted as the fact that while the tool is good at automating the social media posting process, users do not have the flexibility to create network-optimized custom posts within Cloud Campaign.\n\nPost Planner\n\n$39\n\nfor 10 accounts\n\nBest social media scheduling tool for:\n\nProfessionals, entrepreneurs, and business owners\n\nRatings:\n\n3.9/5 (G2), 4.1/5 (Capterra)\n\nApps:\n\nWeb, iOS, and Android versions\n\nIntegrations:\n\nFacebook, Instagram, X (Twitter), Google Business Profile, LinkedIn, Pinterest, TikTok, and YouTube\n\nKey Features:\n\nAll-in-one social media management\n\nDirect multi-platform publishing\n\nViral content search\n\nBuilt-in design tools and stock image library\n\nEfficient content categorization\n\nContent queue recycling\n\nSaved text snippets\n\nCustom scheduling queues\n\nContinuous republishing\n\nPros\n\nUsers can create and schedule posts for all their social profiles using Post Planner’s mobile app.\n\nThe curation feature enables users to discover and share industry-relevant content on their profiles.\n\nVerified User\n\nThe best thing for me is being able to schedule multiple channels all at one time. I manage social for several different radio stations and being able to select different channels to post on all at once is great. I also like being able to repeat posts.\n\nVerified G2 Review\n\nCons\n\nThe higher plans also have set limits to the number of users.\n\nThe dashboard is not very user-friendly.\n\nVerified User\n\nPostPlanner is an extremely non-intuitive, difficult, inflexible, stubborn, and impermeable program that has never left me satisfied after use. Moreover, their customer service and use of “fine print” are more than unethical.\n\nVerified G2 Review\n\nOur Experience\n\nPost Planner is one of those social media scheduling tools which focuses all its capabilities on creating and publishing relevant and effective social media posts. It is a very convenient solution for individuals who want to establish a social media presence for their brand.\n\nIts content curation enables users to find and share relevant and trending content across multiple social media platforms. This ensures that users consistently provide valuable and engaging content to their audiences.\n\nFurther facilitating content creation, Post Planner offers robust inbuilt design tools and Canva integration for creating visually appealing posts. These tools help in optimizing images for various platforms and graphic design features tailored to different platforms.\n\nThe social post composer in Post Planner makes it easy to create and publish content across multiple platforms. With its user-friendly interface, you can draft posts, add multimedia, and optimize your text for better engagement. It even lets you save frequently used text pieces like hashtags, CTAs, and signatures for quick use in captions.\n\nPost Planner helps with strategic content planning where you can group content by themes, campaigns, or other topics. These categories act like separate posting queues, so you can schedule an entire category, and the tool will automatically keep publishing from it. Plus, Post Planner lets you recycle evergreen content with just one click, making sure your best posts keep engaging your audience.\n\nPricing:\n\nPost Planner mainly has three plans starting from $11 per month going up to $69 per month. The free plan available for the tool does not give access to any of the advanced features to be useful for social media professionals.\n\nOverall verdict:\n\nAs far as multi-channel content publishing is concerned, Post Planner is an effective scheduling solution. It makes good use of content by recycling and rescheduling top-performing posts to leverage them completely. The lack of bulk scheduling puts the tool at a disadvantage, as this is a vital part of social media automation. However, for individual business owners or social media consultants managing social accounts of smaller brands, Post Planner proves sufficient in addressing all their content automation needs.\n\nWhat Should You Look for in Social Media Scheduling Tools?\n\nYou might have become familiar and a bit overwhelmed with all these tools and their multitudes of functionalities.
