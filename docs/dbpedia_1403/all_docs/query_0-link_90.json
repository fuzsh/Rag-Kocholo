Beginning at Disney, they moved on to develop new techniques, such as watercolor work on paper, and to offer bold political content. They were the first to combine animation with jazz, working with such artists as Ella Fitzgerald, Dizzy Gillespie, and Oscar Peterson. Later they were commissioned by Sesame Street to create television animation for children. The Hubleys received Academy Awards for Moonbird (1960), The Hole (1963), and Tijuana Brass Double Feature (1966). 538 DVD. 590 PFA 0230-01-14035. |aCOPY-SPECIFC DESCRIPTION: 1 videodisc of 1 (64 min.)
