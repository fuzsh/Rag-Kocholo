For as low as $8.99 a month, Prime Video provides a vast library of content—including some pretty nice originals, like Good Omens, The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel, and The Legend of Vox Machina—and that’s a bargain in today’s streaming landscape.\n\nIf you don’t mind some sponsored interruptions, Paramount+’s ad-supported plan is a great deal. For $5.99 a month, you’ll get access to a ton of CBS, Nickelodeon, and original content, including titles from the Transformers, Mission Impossible, and Star Trek franchises. Or you could upgrade to the $11.99 per month ad-free plan and get free access to SHOWTIME (previously a $10.99/month standalone service).\n\nBut the streaming service market is vast, and nearly every service has at least three different plans to choose from. Let’s break it all down.\n\nJump to:\n\nBest on-demand streaming TV services\n\nHead-to-head comparison\n\nIn-depth look at best streaming services\n\nWhat to look for\n\nWhy take our word for it?\n\nHere at CableTV.com, TV is what we do best; we’ve been helping consumers make good choices since 2007.

Almost every major streaming service raised its prices at least once in 2023, and several streamers are trying to cut costs by removing original content and/or restricting password sharing. These constant changes make it much harder to definitively rank each service, but we’re always up for a challenge.\n\nAs of publishing, we think the best deal around is Amazon Prime Video. Its base $8.99-per-month price provides access to its entire library, although you’ll have to sit through some annoying ads unless you upgrade to a higher tier. You can also subscribe to most other streaming services through Amazon Prime Video as an add-on, making it a one-stop shop for the vast majority of streaming content.\n\nThe Paramount+ with SHOWTIME bundle is the next best deal. You’ll get access to two substantial streaming services for the price of one. Just be warned that Paramount+ and SHOWTIME have radically different libraries—the latter focusing on prestige drama and thrillers, and the former focusing on more family-friendly fare.\n\nThe Disney Bundle was once a great deal, providing access to Disney+, Hulu, and ESPN+ in one subscription. However, those prices are increased substantially in October, and now the highest Disney Bundle tier costs $24.99 per month. The standalone prices also went up; ad-free Disney+ and Hulu each went up by three dollars per month. It’s a change that now puts standalone Hulu as the single most expensive streaming service—more so than the previous title holders, Max and Netflix.\n\nBest on-demand streaming TV services in detail\n\nWe’ve given you a high-level rundown of the best streaming services. Now, let’s dig deeper into why we recommend these on-demand streaming services.\n\nAgain, if you’re looking for live TV streaming, check out our expert guide, Best Live TV Streaming Services, for more recommendations.\n\nEditor’s choice: Amazon Prime Video\n\nPrice:\n\n$8.99–$14.99/mo. or $139.00/yr.\n\nSimultaneous streams:\n\n3\n\nFree trial:\n\n30 days\n\nPros\n\nFree shipping and other Prime benefits\n\nGreat original content\n\nOther streaming services available as add-ons\n\nCons\n\nClunky interface\n\nSome legacy content moved to Freevee\n\nOur new favorite streaming service for 2024 is Amazon Prime Video. Hey, we’re as surprised as you are—but with every service committing to sky-high price increases, we think Amazon Prime Video is a pretty good deal.\n\nIf you’re not interested in all of the Prime membership perks, like free shipping, you can pick up an Amazon Prime Video subscription for just $8.99 a month. Unfortunately, whether or not you want the full membership, you’ll have to pay an extra $2.99/mo. to get rid of ads. This is a brand-new policy beginning in late January 2024, and we felt a lot better about recommending Amazon Prime Video before it was announced. But the streaming world moves fast and waits for no reviewer!\n\nEven if you spring for the ad-free plan, some older licensed content, like The Librarian movies, 2008’s The Color of Magic adaptation, and Repo! The Genetic Opera, are only available through Freevee. Freevee is Amazon’s free ad-supported TV (FAST) streaming platform, and we both love and hate it.\n\nWe love that Freevee provides a lot of cult classics to the public for free, but we hate that Amazon Prime Video subscribers don’t get to skip the ads. Of course, you can buy any of these titles outright on Amazon’s Video on Demand (VOD) store, but that feels pretty redundant.\n\nFreevee quibbles aside, though, Prime Video is a solid streaming service.\n\nBest original content library: Netflix\n\nPrice:\n\n$6.99–$22.99/mo.\n\nSimultaneous streams:\n\n2–4\n\nFree trial:\n\nNone\n\nPros\n\nLarge original content library\n\nFree mobile games (PC and TV support incoming)\n\nCons\n\nNo password sharing\n\nFew simultaneous streams\n\nShows often canceled prematurely\n\nNetflix, our old friend and greatest enemy. Many of us have subscribed to Netflix since its DVD days and look back fondly at Netflix originals like The Witcher and Castlevania. We’ve even enjoyed new additions to the service, including Netflix’s impressive library of mobile games like Oxenfree and Moonlighter.\n\nBut Netflix, like many streaming services in 2023, is getting greedy. It took a big risk this year in restricting how many people can access the same account, kicking many users off of their family’s plan. The key here is location; if you live in a different location than the primary account holder, you might have lost access to Netflix.\n\nAd-free account holders can buy additional members for their accounts for $7.99 per month, which is cheaper than every plan except Standard with ads. But that’s still a lot to ask of customers, especially since Netflix is already one of the priciest services on the market (surpassed only by Hulu, Max, and the Disney Bundle). And even this policy has restrictions; Netflix’s current plans only allow up to two add-on members.\n\nWe love Netflix’s content—especially its animation library—and we love how much entertainment it includes in just one platform. But it’s alienating its fanbase with these new password-sharing crackdowns. That, combined with its tendency to kill off shows (like Dead End: Paranormal Park and Warrior Nun) before their time, makes Netflix challenging to love.\n\nBest value: Paramount+ (with SHOWTIME)\n\nPrice:\n\n$5.99–$11.99/mo. or $59.99–$119.99/yr.\n\nSimultaneous streams:\n\n3\n\nFree trial:\n\n7 days\n\nPros\n\nMoney-saving SHOWTIME bundle\n\nLocal CBS live TV stream\n\nCons\n\nUnskippable Paramount+ ads\n\nCan remove originals with little warning\n\nParamount+ leveled up in 2023 by adding SHOWTIME to its premium tier. Subscribers can now get two streaming services for the price of one—a phenomenal deal compared to competitors like Max and Disney+.\n\nParamount+ offers a growing library of movies, original shows, and live channels. Its homepage offers hubs for CBS, Nickelodeon, MTV, BET, Comedy Central, and the Smithsonian Channel, although they could certainly be improved. The MTV hub, for example, includes a lot of non-MTV content, like 1929 and Tulsa King, for some reason. And while the Nickelodeon hub offers a variety of old shows, it needs more currently airing shows like Monster High. (You’ll still need a cable or live TV subscription for those.)\n\nWe like Paramount+ originals like School Spirits, Star Trek: Strange New Worlds, and The Good Fight, but we don’t know if we fully trust Paramount+ to support them. This is because we also liked Grease: Rise of the Pink Ladies for the minimal time it ran on the service. Unfortunately, it was canceled and removed from Paramount+ shortly after the season finale with almost no warning. It’s unclear whether any of the service’s other originals could suffer the same fate.\n\nThe platform has a surprising amount of live channels for an on-demand streaming service, but they may seem redundant to some viewers. Why watch the I Love Lucy channel when you can pick any episode from its library? The live channels might be more enticing for viewers looking for live news and sports, as they offer content beyond what’s airing on CBS. We especially love having access to hundreds of soccer matches, including every UEFA Champions League game.\n\nParamount+’s biggest plus is its bundle with SHOWTIME, which has a very different vibe. While Paramount+ has more of a fun-for-the-whole-family energy, SHOWTIME is more focused on prestige TV and thrillers. With the SHOWTIME hub on Paramount+, you’ll find A24 films, boxing, and exciting originals like Yellowjackets and Billions.\n\nBest for families: Disney+\n\nPrice:\n\n$7.99–$13.99/mo. or $139.99/yr.\n\nSimultaneous streams:\n\n4\n\nFree trial:\n\nNone\n\nPros\n\nNear-complete Marvel, Star Wars, and Pixar collections\n\nNext-day Disney Channel premieres\n\nCons\n\nHuge price hikes\n\nPricey ad-supported plan\n\nNotorious content-remover\n\nDisney+ comes with a pretty hefty price tag for what it is, and that’s only somewhat softened by the Disney Bundle, which offers Disney+, Hulu, and ESPN+ for a slightly lower price. If you want the most affordable option, you’ll have to settle for one of its ad-supported plans.\n\nSo what can you get for all that money? Ignoring the price, Disney+ is a pretty consistent streaming service. It’s super easy to navigate its branded hubs, and we’ve enjoyed quite a few of its original shows and movies. It also provides access to almost all of Disney’s library of content, from Snow White to Strange World. Well, almost.\n\nDisney+ boasts an endless stream of Marvel, Star Wars, and Pixar spinoffs, but it has the same trust problem as Max and Paramount+. In May 2023, it removed dozens of original titles from its platform (significantly more than its competitors, by the way) and failed to replace any of them with video-on-demand (VOD) listings on services like Google Play or Amazon Prime Video.\n\nWe’re fans of several Disney titles, but it feels like its streaming service should have to pick a lane. Either delete content and lower prices, or keep content and raise the prices. Don’t give us the worst of both worlds!\n\nMost simultaneous streams: Apple TV+\n\nPrice:\n\n$9.99/mo.\n\nSimultaneous streams:\n\n6\n\nFree trial:\n\n7 days\n\nPros\n\nAward-winning originals\n\nPlenty of streams\n\nOne low price\n\nCons\n\nComparatively small library\n\nOnly original content\n\nApple TV+ really surprised us. You wouldn’t expect Apple—the company that thrives on planned obsolescence and charging its customers an arm and a leg for every accessory—to provide a good value, but here we are.\n\nWhile Netflix and Max are super stingy about password-sharing, Apple TV+ allows six simultaneous streams for no extra cost. It’s still pretty cheap, and doesn’t even try to charge extra for an ad-free tier.\n\nUnfortunately, Apple TV+ doesn’t have a huge library. It’s produced several award-winning originals, like Ted Lasso and Severance, and has some charming options for kids. There are even live MLB and MLS games; more MLS coverage is available through the MLS Season Pass add-on. But Apple TV+ rarely licenses additional content from other production companies.\n\nBest for next-day streaming: Hulu\n\nPrice:\n\n$7.99–$17.99/mo.\n\nSimultaneous streams:\n\n2\n\nFree trial:\n\n30 days\n\nPros\n\nNext-day streaming for cable shows\n\nBundle with Disney+ and ESPN+\n\nCons\n\nVery expensive\n\nClunky interface\n\nMost expensive ad-free standalone service\n\nHulu is a cornucopia of content. It’s is a great way for cord-cutters to catch next-day releases from channels like ABC and FX. Just keep in mind that other channel libraries may not be comprehensive as more companies claim content for their own streamers.\n\nThere are a few original series like Only Murders in the Building and a surprising amount of Funimation anime like Trigun Stampede, but it’s a cable replacement at its core. Your options will increase exponentially if you shell out the extra cash for Hulu + Live TV, which maybe defeats the purpose of cutting cable to begin with. Peacock, Paramount+, and Discovery+ are also great for scooping up those channels you lost when you quit cable.\n\nFull disclosure, Hulu is majority owned by Disney, so it’s not immune to random original content purges. A moment of silence for everyone who never got around to watching Rosaline or The Princess.\n\nBest horror library: Shudder\n\nPrice:\n\n$6.99/mo. or $71.88/yr.\n\nSimultaneous streams:\n\n1–3\n\nFree trial:\n\n7 days\n\nPros\n\nLow price\n\nHand-curated horror library\n\nCons\n\nNot great as an add-on\n\nResolution only up to 720p\n\nIf you’re into all things horror and supernatural, Shudder is the streaming service for you. Shudder carries 600+ nail-biting movies and TV series and even a handful of podcasts. From vintage slasher flicks to foreign imports to current releases to the culty-ist of cult obscurities, it’s a scream-geek’s paradise.\n\nShudder also features original series and movies, like Creepshow, The Last Drive-In with Joe Bob Briggs, V/H/S/94, and Cursed Films, as well as exclusive movie premieres. If you can’t decide on an on-demand movie or show, you can just click on one of Shudder’s three “live” channels of looping content.\n\nShudder also has the honor of bearing our 2023 Customer Satisfaction award. Horror fans truly cannot get enough of it.\n\nBest anime library: Crunchyroll\n\nPrice:\n\n$7.99–$15.99/mo.\n\nSimultaneous streams:\n\n1–6\n\nFree trial:\n\n14 days\n\nPros\n\nHuge anime library\n\nSimulcasts air one hour after Japan\n\nCustomizable watchlists\n\nCons\n\nNo captions on English dubs\n\nAwkward transition from Funimation\n\nCrunchyroll has the best anime library of any streaming service by far. We’ve been running our anime simulcasts guide for a while now, and Crunchyroll always has the biggest section on the page. If you’re an anime superfan, Crunchyroll is the definitive experience for you.\n\nThe only downside to Crunchyroll is its lack of captions on English dubs. It’s had this problem for years now, and it’s frustrating. Funimation, the competitor Crunchyroll bought up in 2021, never had this problem, but it doesn’t even exist anymore as an alternative. So if you’re looking for dubs for a more mainstream anime like Spy x Family or My Hero Academia, you might be better off streaming with Hulu.\n\nCheapest ad-supported subscription: Discovery+\n\nPrice:\n\n$4.99–$8.99/mo.\n\nSimultaneous streams:\n\n4\n\nFree trial:\n\n7 days\n\nPros\n\nGreat archive of reality TV\n\nNew episodes air simultaneously\n\nSuper cheap\n\nCons\n\nOnly reality TV\n\nNot The One to Watch for HBO\n\nYes, Discovery+ still exists after the HBO Max merger fiasco. If you’re all about reality TV, you won’t do better than Discovery+. Its ad-supported plan is the cheapest on the market, and its ad-free plan is decent as well, although not the cheapest.\n\nWe’re also pleasantly surprised by Discovery+’s user experience. It’s easy to find the latest episodes from your favorite show, whether it’s on HGTV, Food Network, TLC, Investigation Discovery (ID), Animal Planet, OWN, A&E, Lifetime, History, Travel Channel, or Science Channel. Why pay for cable again?\n\nCheapest ad-free subscription: MGM+\n\nPrice:\n\n$6.99/mo. or $58.99/yr.\n\nSimultaneous streams:\n\n4\n\nFree trial:\n\n7 days\n\nPros\n\nLots of movies\n\nCheap\n\nAd-free\n\nCons\n\nOnly a few original releases per year\n\nNo 4K or Dolby 5.1 Surround Sound\n\nMGM+’s main thing is movies. If you want a large, ad-free library of movies at your fingertips, MGM+ (previously EPIX) is the service for you. It’s rare to see a service with only one, low-price, ad-free plan in 2023, but MGM+ and Apple TV+ are both practitioners of The Old Ways. Unfortunately, MGM+ is also behind the times in terms of quality, and has yet to integrate 4K or Dolby 5.1 support.\n\nLooking for shows, not movies? In recent years, MGM+ has been slowly building up a library of originals, including the (somewhat) historical dramas Domina and The Winter King. It’s not enough content to compete with Netflix, but there are still a few titles you might want to catch, including a modern reimagining of War of the Worlds.\n\nOther top providers\n\nThese streaming services might not have won any awards this year, but they’re good to have on your radar. Let’s hear it for the runners-up:\n\nHBO, DC, Studio Ghibli, Adult Swim, and Discovery content: Max\n\nPrice:\n\n$9.99–$20.99/mo. or $99.99–$209.99/yr.\n\nSimultaneous streams:\n\n2–4\n\nFree trial:\n\n7 days (through Hulu or Amazon)\n\nPros\n\nNear-complete HBO and Discovery libraries\n\nGreat for DC and Studio Ghibli fans\n\nCons\n\nExtremely expensive\n\nAwkward blend between Max and Discovery+\n\nTechnical issues and branding woes\n\nHBO Max used to be the cream of the crop, our favorite streaming service to recommend to all of our friends. But then the service started cutting off pieces of itself to sell to free, ad-supported television (FAST) platforms like The Roku Channel and Tubi, raised its prices, and merged with Discovery+ in the worst branding fiasco of the decade.\n\nMax is a decent service for catching up on Adult Swim titles and the newest episodes of House of the Dragon, but we’re skeptical if it’s still worth the steep price, especially without new episodes of Succession and Barry to lean on. And if you’re looking for Kitchen Nightmares and Deadliest Catch? You’d be better off just getting Discovery+.\n\nCatch theatrical releases and next-day NBC, Bravo, USA: Peacock\n\nPrice:\n\n$7.99–$13.99/mo. or $79.99–$139.99/yr.\n\nSimultaneous streams:\n\n3\n\nFree trial:\n\nNone\n\nPros\n\nUniversal Pictures theatrical releases\n\nLive NBC channels\n\nCons\n\nSmall original content library\n\nNo longer the cheap option\n\nPeacock may not have a ton of original content, but it’s an excellent choice for sports and movie-lovers. Most Universal Pictures movies end up here, either soon after their premiere in theaters or, in some cases, simultaneously.\n\nIt’s also the streaming home of marquee NBC Sports coverage, like Sunday Night Football and the Olympics. Plus, there are live WWE, English Premier League, PGA Tour, and Big Ten Conference events. Unfortunately, Peacock isn’t the cute, little free streaming service it was when it began, and both its ad-supported and ad-free tiers are now in line with the prices of other services.\n\nAMC, BBC America, IFC, and Sundance content: AMC+\n\nPrice:\n\n$8.99/mo. or $83.83/yr.\n\nSimultaneous streams:\n\n5\n\nFree trial:\n\n7 days\n\nPros\n\nLive AMC, IFC, SUNDANCE TV, and BBC America channels\n\nOnly one (ad-free) plan\n\nCons\n\nNot a lot of originals\n\nPoor user experience\n\nIf you’re a cord cutter, AMC+ is the best place to watch, you guessed it, AMC content. The service also has a few exclusives of its own, including Anne Rice’s Interview with the Vampire, Anne Boleyn, and Kevin Can F**K Himself, although these make up a very small percentage of the platform.\n\nAMC+ also has a Shudder hub, but our Customer Satisfaction Survey showed that fans vastly preferred the Shudder app itself (which is a separate subscription) for their horror fix.\n\nExclusive live sports: ESPN+\n\nPrice:\n\n$10.99/mo. or $109.99/yr.\n\nSimultaneous streams:\n\n5\n\nFree trial:\n\nNone\n\nPros\n\nRich on-demand library\n\nPlenty of live soccer and college sports\n\nCons\n\nNo regular NFL or NBA games\n\nNo popular ESPN shows\n\nESPN+ isn’t a streaming replacement for ESPN, but it’s a great addition to it. ESPN+ carries live content that its cable counterpart doesn’t, including UFC, NHL, MLB, international soccer, boxing, golf, tennis, and college sports events—all for 11 bucks a month.\n\nBut really, ESPN+’s strength is its deep on-demand library, which includes every 30 for 30 documentary, and original shows like Peyton’s Places, The Ultimate Fighter, and several others. You can even get fantasy league perks through ESPN+ and read exclusive analysis articles from top sportswriters.\n\nKeep in mind that ESPN+ is accessible through ESPN.com and the ESPN app. The setup can be confusing since it combines linear ESPN content with ESPN+ coverage, but you can’t watch that other stuff without a TV provider login.\n\n880+ TV shows and movies: STARZ\n\nPrice:\n\n$10.00/mo.\n\nSimultaneous streams:\n\n4\n\nFree trial:\n\n7 days (only through Hulu or Amazon)\n\nPros\n\nBig movie library\n\nCan bundle with MGM+\n\nCons\n\nSmall original content library\n\nIts competitors HBO and SHOWTIME have hitched themselves to Max and Paramount+, respectively, but STARZ has a different strategy. STARZ is the only one of the big three premium channels still available as a standalone subscription, although it is also available in a thrifty bundle with MGM+.\n\nEven with MGM+, STARZ doesn’t have the library of its competitors, but you’ll want to check it out if you’re a fan of Outlander, Minx, or STARZ’s surprising library of Western films.\n\nFree and cheap streaming services\n\nCan you stream TV for free? Of course. For as many paid streaming services that are available, there are even more free apps. In most cases, you’ll have to put up with ads, but so what? Free is free.\n\nCheck out our Best Free and Cheap Streaming Services guide for some of our favorite budget streamers.\n\nWhat to look for in an on-demand streaming TV service\n\nDoes it have the content you’re looking for?\n\nIf you’ve quit cable and are looking for a replacement, check what channels each streaming service carries. For example, Discovery+ and Max carry shows from Food Network, TLC, HGTV, HISTORY, and Discovery, while Peacock carries shows from NBC, Bravo, Hallmark, and Telemundo.\n\nBut maybe original streaming series are your thing. You’re not alone on that one. Most original streaming content only sticks to its own platform (unless it gets sold off to a FAST service like Tubi). So if you’re looking for Stranger Things and Castlevania, you should go for Netflix, and if you’re looking for Ted Lasso and Severance, you should go for Apple TV+.\n\nThere are also a number of niche services that only air one type of content. Check out our anime, horror, and sports hubs for more information on how to watch your favorite niche content.\n\nDoes the service offer a free trial?\n\nOne of the best perks of streaming TV services is the free trial period. The trial windows are brief (seven days is common) but offer enough time for a dedicated viewer to pull off a marathon or two. Unfortunately, not every service allows this, and most require credit card information, so you’ll have to be quick about hitting that cancellation button.\n\nHow many users does it allow?\n\nWhen we talk about simultaneous streams, we mean how many users can be watching content on the same account at the same time. This isn’t the same thing as the number of devices that can be logged in simultaneously, and a good plan will usually allow three or four. Some services offer budget plans with fewer streams.\n\nIn 2023, Netflix began restricting simultaneous log-ins based on location. If you live in a different household from the account holder, you’ll have to pay a steep fee or get booted. We haven’t seen too many other services follow suit yet, but it’s a big drawback to look out for.\n\nAnd some services don’t allow for more than one profile at all, which is a bummer if you’re sharing an account with someone else. You’ll just have to keep a mental note of which One Piece episode you’re on if you share a Crunchyroll account.\n\nDoes it have ads?\n\nWhile the whole point of streaming was originally to escape cable’s relentless ads, many services now offer a cheaper ad-supported alternative plan to their subscribers. It’s an obvious excuse to raise the price of the ad-free or premium tier, which used to be the norm and much cheaper. We don’t love this practice, but it might be worth it to you if you need to save some cash. Those Disney+ price hikes aren’t messing around.\n\nStreaming service ads can be super annoying, though, especially on content that was never supposed to have ad breaks.\n\nWhat’s the best streaming platform?\n\nWe think the best streaming platform in 2024 is, surprisingly, Amazon Prime Video. It offers a vast library of ad-free content for a reasonable price, and has avoided some of the more frustrating cost-cutting tactics used by its competitors (we’re looking at you, Netflix and Max). And its growing library of original content is nothing to sneeze at, either.\n\nWe’re also really into niche streaming services lately. Horror fans will love Shudder, and Crunchyroll is a must-have for anime fans. And if you can’t get enough reality TV, Discovery+ will be your new best friend.\n\nOn-demand streaming TV FAQ\n\nWhat’s the best streaming service for movies?\n\nAmazon Prime Video is the best movie deal we’ve seen—especially since you can purchase any title it doesn’t already have à la carte—but there are a few other services you should keep an eye out for as well.\n\nMGM+’s whole business is movies, and it does it well. If you can stomach a lack of 4K video, its library is pretty big. If you’re looking for movies from a specific production company, we do have some recommendations as well. Max carries everything from Studio Ghibli; Paramount+ with SHOWTIME carries everything from A24; and Peacock offers Universal Pictures films pretty soon after their premiere in theaters.\n\nWhat’s the best streaming service for TV shows?\n\nFor original TV content, we recommend Netflix and Apple TV+, but if you’re looking for a cable substitute, check out Hulu, Max, Peacock, and Paramount+. They represent all the brands affiliated with ABC, Discovery, NBC, and CBS, respectively.\n\nWhat is the best streaming service to get everything?\n\nWe think you might like Amazon Prime Video, which is more than just its own streaming service—you can also use it to purchase other subscriptions a la carte according to your tastes.\n\nYou also might be thinking of live TV streaming services, which act more like a cable plan (without all the equipment and hassle). Try Hulu + Live TV or YouTube TV on for size.\n\nWhat is the most-watched streaming service?\n\nAccording to our 2024 customer satisfaction survey, Netflix is the most-watched streaming service. Out of 7,130 respondents, 4118 currently have a Netflix account. It also ranked number one in customer satisfaction, despite its high monthly cost!"
