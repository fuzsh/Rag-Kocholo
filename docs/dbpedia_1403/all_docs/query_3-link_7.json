        "text": "Coding YouTube Channels\n\nAcademind\n\nA YouTube channel founded and run by Maximilian Schwarzmüller and Manuel Lorenz, Academind uploads video tutorials on web development to its over 841K subscribers. The videos cover skills like Python, GitHub, and Bootstrap.\n\nTutorials last anywhere from 1-4 hours and include crash courses for beginners, along with more advanced topics. The pair also uploads shorter videos about specific topics, like \"Why Angular, React & Vue Shouldn't Directly Send Database Queries\" and \"What Are Pure Functions and Side Effects?\"\n\nSchwarzmüller and Lorenz also chat about trending topics, tools, and skills in the coding industry. Learners can visit the Academind website, which offers premium online courses and links to the Academind community on Discord — a good way for aspiring developers to connect with others in the same boat.\n\nBest For: Experienced coders who already have a background in tech\n\nMost Watched Video: Visual Studio Code Tutorial for beginners\n\nCS Dojo\n\nYK Sugi, the YouTuber who runs CS Dojo, used to work as a software developer at Google. Now, he shares his expertise with over 1.9 million subscribers through step-by-step tutorials on a whiteboard and easy-to-follow demonstrations.\n\nThe channel has nine playlists, easily dividing the videos so that viewers who want to learn a particular skill can watch all of his videos as if they're a full course. Playlists include \"Building a Real Startup With Python and Javascript,\" \"Python Tutorials for Absolute Beginners,\" and \"How to Learn to Code.\"\n\nBeginners can especially benefit from videos like \"How to Learn to Code - Best Resources, How to Choose a Project, and More!\" and \"What Programming Language Should I Learn First?\" Job seekers may also appreciate videos that help with potential interview questions, like \"How to Crack a Google Coding Interview - An Ex-Googler's Experience.\"\n\nBest For: Experienced coders and those looking for help with interview prep\n\nMost Watched Video: Python Tutorial for Absolute Beginners #1- What are Variables?\n\nDerek Banas\n\nDerek Banas begins his YouTube videos with the friendly welcome, \"Well, hello internet!\" The YouTuber uploads tutorials on all sorts of topics, but his main areas of expertise include programming, web design, and mobile development.\n\nHis early videos focus on foundational languages and coding skills, like HTML, CSS, and SQL. More recently, Banas has built courses on the math of machine learning, Ruby on Rails, and how to make video games.\n\nBanas has also uploaded units on algebra, precalculus, and trigonometry, which can be as helpful for high school students as they are for programmers who need a refresh in their math skills.\n\nBest For: Experienced coders and anyone looking to improve their math skills\n\nMost Watched Video: Python Programming\n\nfreeCodeCamp\n\nThe nonprofit organization freeCodeCamp offers several comprehensive, self-paced courses on coding. Many of these courses incorporate YouTube videos with instructors who walk viewers through different modules.\n\nUnlike some other channels featured on this list, freeCodeCamp uploads videos that learners follow in a specific order to build upon their previous lessons. However, the channel also uploads standalone courses that typically last several hours; while most last 1-5 hours, one of the longest surpasses 17 hours.\n\nTopics vary, although freeCodeCamp is typically true to its name and sticks with coding. Videos cover everything from beginners' tutorials to more advanced topics like \"Linux for Ethical Hackers\" and \"Code a Snake Game With Python and Pygame - Tutorial.\"\n\nThe channel also uploads videos tangential to coding, like \"How to Find Freelance Jobs\" and \"College Algebra - Full Course.\"\n\nBest For: Students looking for more explanation and more in-depth content\n\nMost Watched Video: Learn Python- Full Course for Beginners\n\nJoshua Fluke\n\nSoftware developer Joshua Fluke describes himself as an entrepreneur and content creator who helps people get their start in the tech industry. In addition to offering paid courses through his program Grind Reel, Fluke uploads several free resources on his YouTube channel.\n\nHis channel includes playlists about learning Python, getting motivated to code, and applying for jobs. Fluke also chats about other aspects of the tech field, including how to avoid exploitative jobs in coding, the advantages of remote work, and how to work successfully through freelance gigs or side hustles.\n\nFluke also consistently interacts with his audience through live videos like \"An HR Lady Asks Me Interview Questions\" and \"Mock Job Interviews With Viewers,\" in which he speaks with his viewers directly.\n\nBest For: People who want to learn about the tech industry\n\nMost Watched Video: What a REAL web developer interview is like (Front End)\n\nLevelUpTuts\n\nShort for Level Up Tutorials, LevelUpTuts began in 2013 as a free educational resource for people learning web development. Along with his friend Ben Schaaf, Scott Tolinski started the channel after he suffered an injury while breakdancing and had plenty of time to kill inside.\n\nTolinski continues to run the channel on his own, publishing accessible and user-friendly tutorials with high production value. LevelUpTuts offers over 1,000 free videos on various (and sometimes ultra-specific) topics — for example, \"How I Make 4k Video Intros Without After Effects.\"\n\nThe channel includes several series; most videos don't run over 10 minutes. Viewers can make their way through the \"Meteor 1.4 + React for Everyone\" series in five parts, along with many similar video collections.\n\nLevelUpTuts also runs paid programs with advanced video tutorials in topics like code automation in GitHub, testing with Cypress, and animating React with Framer Motion.\n\nBest For: Those looking for quick, bite-sized content\n\nMost Watched Video: Sketch App Tutorials- Series Introduction\n\nLife of Luba\n\nLuba Yudasina carves out a place for herself in the male-dominated field with her Life of Luba channel. Originally from Belarus, Yudasina has worked as a software engineer, chief of staff, and product manager at Airbnb and Yelp. Now, she also uploads videos related to entrepreneurship in technology.\n\nHer videos include some beginner lessons on coding, like \"How to Learn Code (5 Quick Simple Steps)!\" and the two-minute tutorial \"Get Started With Coding: Learn This Line of Code!\" Many of her videos focus on navigating the tech industry: She speaks about her experience in Silicon Valley, how she landed an internship at Yelp, and how to put together a software engineering resume.\n\nLuba also chats about work and tech topics such as productivity tips, book recommendations for entrepreneurs, digital organization, and coworking spaces.\n\nBest For: People interested in software engineering and working in Silicon Valley\n\nMost Watched Video: A Day in the Life of a Software Engineer at Airbnb\n\nThe Coding Train\n\nDaniel Shiffman describes The Coding Train as a YouTube channel \"dedicated to beginner-friendly creative coding tutorials and challenges.\" Shiffman's playful teaching style uses bright graphics and full-screen demonstrations to cover many topics — he even has a whistle to demonstrate that the Coding Train is departing at the start of his videos.\n\nTopics include the basics of coding variables, conditionals, loops, functions, and more niche topics like building Twitter bots. Shiffman engages his audience with live streams and by collaborating with expert guests. He also encourages viewers to play along with coding challenges, like \"Estimating Pi From Random Numbers With Euclid's Algorithm\" and \"Times Table Cardioid Visualization.\"\n\nInterested viewers can find more resources on The Coding Train's website, including access to a GitHub account.\n\nBest For: Those wanting more high-energy videos with more personality\n\nMost Watched Video: Coding Challenge #3: The Snake Game\n\nThe Net Ninja\n\nRun by U.K.-based Shaun Pelling, The Net Ninja is a YouTube channel with tutorials on foundational, intermediate, and advanced programming skills.\n\nStudents can follow along with several playlists, including a Deno tutorial, a Node.js course, and a Flutter Animation tutorial. If you're looking for information on any coding language or a somewhat under-the-radar programming skill, there's a chance that Pelling has covered it.\n\nUnlike some other channels, Pelling focuses on teaching skills without uploading videos on the tech industry, his personal life, collaborations, or live streaming. For individuals who might prefer straight-to-the-point videos that typically stay under 15 minutes, The Net Ninja delivers.\n\nFollowers can also subscribe to Pelling's Patreon, which gives access to his Udemy courses to supplement the videos found on YouTube.\n\nBest For: Those looking for straight-to-the-point videos on web skills\n\nMost Watched Video: Flutter Tutorial for Beginners #1- Intro & Setup"
