Sprinklr\n\nSprinklrâs social media managementÂ solutionÂ empowers mid-sized and enterprise teams to deliver a consistent brand experience across 30+ digital and social channels. Its in-depth capabilities across publishing, engagement, listening, reporting and analytics, employee advocacy, influencer marketing, and conversational commerce can help you stay organized and do your job efficiently. In addition, generative AI capabilities are deeply integrated into the platform to drive use cases like content ideation, copy creation and review, translation, and more.\n\nð Prominent features\n\nUnified Customer Experience Management (Unified-CXM): Manage your customer experience across various touchpoints, including social media, on a unified platform. This allows for consistent and personalized interactions with your online customers, enhancing their overall experience with your brand.Â\n\nSprinklr AI+ (powered by Sprinklr AI, Google Cloudâs Vertex AI, and OpenAIâs GPT models): With Sprinklr AI+, customer-facing teams can effortlessly utilize generative AI capabilities with just a few clicks, without the need to learn new workflows or constantly switch between multiple screens.Â Â\n\nPersona Apps: These are simplified UI layers purpose-built for different personas, such as social media managers and content managers. This design ensures that users view only the information relevant to their role, eliminating unnecessary features and helping them make the most of the platform.Â Â\n\nGlobal reach and localization: Sprinklr is designed to help businesses with a global presence. Its localization features allow you to tailor your content and messaging so that your brand message resonates with diverse audiences around the world.\n\nOverall verdict\n\nWith capabilities that support listening, publishing, and advertising, not to mention the embedded generative AI functionality, Sprinklr stands out from most social media management tools as it caters to the diverse needs of its users.Â The unified platform enables users to collaborate across notes, queues, and tasks, and it allows the creation of industry-specific workflows across channels, regions, and account groups.Â With the bulk of its customers being large enterprises, Sprinklr is an ideal fit for companies with large marketing and sales teams maintaining multiple social accounts across platforms.\n\nCustomer testimonial\n\nðª Strengths\n\nâSprinklr Social helps us with efficiently planning, posting, and analyzing organic social content in a continuously developing digital landscape. With this solution, we do not only save time in managing our owned social channels but also have high ROI on our content and are able to build social communities. We are able to scale our ROI on content by sharing high-performing content across markets, actively using Sprinklr Insights with Sprinklr Social, and running analyses on our data with easy-to-retrieve reports. Besides, the support from Sprinklr is excellent and based on tailored expertise. They help us with designing use cases relevant to us and our industry to get the most out of the platform.â\n\nð¡ What could be better\n\nâThere are a lot of possibilities within the module. However, the Sprinklr success manager and experts are skilled and support business-fitting use cases. In addition, sometimes features that are available in native platforms are not yet available in Sprinklr. Nonetheless, with an efficient feedback loop through Sprinklr, this normally gets solved after a few development sprints.â\n\nSource\n\nTrusted by: Uber, Microsoft, Wells Fargo, the Prada Group and Boston University\n\n2. Hootsuite\n\nAlong with Sprinklr,Â HootsuiteÂ is one of the most comprehensive social media management tools built for enterprises. It is packed to the hilt with features. For instance, it can tell you when your audience is the most active,Â allowing you to optimize your post timing for maximum engagement. Its integrated AI can assist in crafting copy for your posts and the inclusion of Canva within the platform also speeds up the creation of eye-catching visuals for your content.Â\n\nWhen it comes to engagement, Hootsuite provides a holistic view of customer activities, enabling you to respond swiftly to messages and comments.\n\nð Prominent features\n\nOne dashboard for all accounts: Manage all your social accounts in one place â schedule posts, engage with your audience, and monitor your brand's mentions on various platforms without switching tabs.\n\nOwlyWriter AI: A powerful social media post generator that guides you through content ideation and creation in just a few clicks without you having to leave the Hootsuite dashboard.\n\nApp integrations: With third-party app integration, you can expand the platformâs functionality, essentially customizing it to suit your specific needs.\n\nOverall verdict\n\nHootsuite offers a centralized hub for monitoring your social media presence across more than 35 platforms. Additionally, it provides the convenience of bulk-scheduling posts. Nevertheless, it has a few drawbacks, such as its complexity and a less-than-ideal user experience, despite being in the market for 15 years. Another notable limitation is the absence of a centralized media library for asset storage and sharing, which can be challenging when posting on the go. Plus, its collaboration features, considering its popularity, are surprisingly limited.\n\nWith Sprinklrâs Publisher Console capability, you can track branded content from development through deployment across all digital channels and enable cross-team collaboration and visibility every step of the way â all on a single platform.\n\nCustomer testimonial\n\nðª Strengths\n\nâHootsuite is one of the easiest to use social media scheduling tools out there. It's one of my top choices for small to medium-sized businesses that are looking for an efficient, affordable tool. There are a variety of features to allow users the best social media scheduling options.â\n\nSource\n\nð¡ What could be better\n\nâLately, my gripe with Hootsuite is how sometimes your scheduled post won't go out. It will show an error message and maybe post in the next half hour. When this happens, it also gives you the impression that it posted twice, even when it didn't. This confuses me as I am trying to figure out how many times we've posted on a given day. It would be nice to simply be able to delete those duplicates after the fact.â\n\nSource\n\n3. Reputation\n\nReputationÂ Social SuiteÂ lets you cross-post and respond to comments across major social networks (but it doesn't offer the same extensive channel coverage as Sprinklr). Its integrated scheduling capabilities let you automate the publishing of your social posts like clockwork. Besides, the centralized repository and built-in approval workflows make your job even easier. In addition, you can set alerts for brand mentions and trending keywords so you can be on top of your customer grievances and avert any looming crisis.Â\n\nð Prominent features\n\nSentiment analysis: Monitor and analyze sentiment trends in real time, and gauge public perception and sentiment surrounding your brand or products.Â\n\nCompetitive Dashboard Report: Compare your social media metrics, engagement, and sentiment with those of industry rivals to gain a competitive edge.Â Â\n\nReview management: Streamline the process of addressing customer feedback and managing online reviews, enhancing brand reputation and customer satisfaction.Â\n\nOverall verdict\n\nReputation stands out in this list by allowing you to benchmark your performance against your competition. Similar to Sprinklr, it consolidates your social channels,Â making publishing and customer engagement a seamless experience.Â However, the application lacks AI capabilities for functions like suggesting responses to customer reviews.\n\nWith SprinklrâsÂ review management software, however, your teams can take charge by knowing when and where to deliver support,Â education,Â and care to customers with questions or feedback â enforcing the positivity and loyalty that increases revenue and reduces costs.\n\nCustomer testimonial\n\nðª Strengths\n\nâReputation is the most convenient and effective way to get 5-star reviews across multiple platforms. I can send clients customized text messages and or emails with convenient links to one or more review sites like Google, Facebook, and more that make it so easy for the client to leave a great review. I have great success getting more top-notch reviews using Reputation than any other method.â\n\nSource\n\nð¡ What could be better\n\nâI wish that campaigns work. As of now, I have to schedule all of the campaign posts from my media and it's annoying it doesn't work. I also wish that you could see the times that the posts are scheduled for on the calendar. You have to click on the post in order to see what time it is set for, and it would be easier if it just showed in the corner or something.âÂ\n\nSource\n\n4. SocialPilot\n\nSocialPilot is the ideal choice, especially if you're new to social media management software. Besides handling core tasks like content scheduling, publishing, commenting, reporting, and analytics,Â it can curate topical content from several industries to help ease your content creation efforts.Â Moreover, its comprehensive reports encompass everything from content performance to audience insights, enabling a deeper understanding of your target audience and the creation of more resonant content.Â\n\nWith its user-friendly interface and budget-friendly pricing, SocialPilot is particularly well-suited for smaller enterprises.\n\nð Prominent features\n\nConnect 50+ accounts: Link and oversee over 50 social profiles on major social networks, while also setting up posts for multiple, scheduled publications across all your social media accounts\n\nBuilt-in AI Assistant: Use AI to auto-generate captions and hashtags. Plus, tailor content to each platform, test copy variations and repurpose and translate posts with ease.\n\nCustom feeds automation: Get relevant and evergreen content from across the web and schedule it to reach your target audience. Additionally, you can enable RSS feeds to automate the sharing of your favorite blogs.\n\nOverall verdict\n\nLike most social media management apps, SocialPilot can help you bolster your social media presence with its intuitive features, enabling you to execute a well-planned social media posting schedule quickly. Its cost-effectiveness, user-friendly UI, and exceptional customer support are a bonus. But it does lack comprehensive analytics, advanced targeting options, or additional automation capabilities that you can find in a social media management platform like Sprinklr.Â\n\nSprinklr's listening tool empowers your team with integrated social listening across 30+ digital and social channels. Its AI-driven automated inbound triaging capability categorizes messages by intent, enabling you to target and engage in valuable conversations while boosting your overall productivity.\n\nCustomer testimonial\n\nðª Strengths\n\nâI love that my clients can view their entire month's content calendar, and give me any feedback on anything they would like changed/altered. I really like the calendar view and the fact I can group social channels into groups of clients so one click and I can post to all.â\n\nSource\n\nð¡ What could be better\n\nâI wish I could have an easier way to view the social media messages and comments for all locations in one spot - rather than switching between platforms and locations. With 19 locations on multiple platforms - that becomes quite time-consuming. In analysis, I wish I could easily compare all locations in a leaderboard - and have the ability to see a \"report card\" for each location with all of their activity on each platform in a one-page report.â\n\nSource\n\n5. Sprout Social\n\nSprout Social, just like Sprinklr, allows you to manage all your social accounts in one place, making team collaboration easier. You can track all your social media campaigns and measure their performance with its in-depth reporting and analytics feature. It also comes with an asset library that enables you to share assets with your team members and other stakeholders quickly.Â\n\nBut Sprout Socialâs standout feature is its CRM functionality. With a 360-degree view of your customers, you can gain a deep insight into their interests and expectations, helping you build stronger relationships with them.Â\n\nð Prominent features\n\nSmart Inbox: Centralize all your social media messages and comments from various platforms in one place, making it easier to respond promptly and effectively.\n\nAdvanced reporting: Through in-depth reporting and analytics, understand how well your social posts are performing and gain valuable insights into audience engagement and reach.\n\nTeam collaboration: The application makes collaboration easier â you can assign tasks, review content, and ensure seamless communication within your team, streamlining your social media workflow.\n\nOverall verdict\n\nSprout Social's reports are great out of all social media management apps. They're so well-detailed that they speak for themselves during presentations. Having said that, it's worth noting that the calendar feature has some room for improvement. It lacks a drag-and-drop option and the ability to group posts, which can be frustrating if you are someone who manages multiple posts across various platforms daily. And smaller enterprises might find its pricing on the higher side.\n\nSprinklrâs Unified Calendar, on the other hand, brings all paid and owned activity together in a unified platform â giving your team full visibility into campaign planning and production. This enables you to streamline workflows, eliminate redundancies, and keep your messaging on target on every channel.\n\nCustomer testimonial\n\nðª Strengths\n\nâMy favorite part is scheduling the posts ahead of time. We use LinkedIn, Facebook, Instagram, and X primarily; and I love that I can schedule posts to all these platforms from Sprout. Especially if I'm going to be away for a period of time, to still be able to have posts going out in my absence is awesome!â\n\nSource\n\nð¡ What could be better\n\nâIt can be hard to collaborate in Sprout, and the more people you add to your account, the messier workflows can become. I wish you could designate certain project teams or alter permissions from client to client to keep things more organized.â\n\nSource\n\n6. HubSpot\n\nAlthoughÂ HubSpotÂ is renowned for its CRM capabilities, it also offers robust social media management tools as part of its marketing suite. These tools bring together all your social media accounts and content into a central platform, simplifying your social media efforts. This allows for easy post-scheduling, audience engagement, and in-depth performance analysis. Ultimately, it saves you time and enhances your social media marketing strategy.\n\nAnd hereâs the best part, you can set up keywords to track trends and post content directly from the CRM to your social accounts. Additionally, HubSpot provides a comprehensive summary of clicks, visits, leads, and more to help you assess your overall performance.\n\nð Prominent features\n\nAll-in-one marketing platform: HubSpot offers a comprehensive suite of marketing tools, including email marketing, SEO optimization, and lead generation, in addition to social media management, all integrated into one platform.\n\nMarketing automation: Create automated workflows for lead nurturing, personalized email campaigns, and behavior-based triggers, saving time and improving engagement.\n\nCustomer relationship management (CRM): Effortlessly manage and analyze customer interactions using the application's built-in CRM system. This capability simplifies the organization of contacts, deals, and tasks, ultimately helping you cultivate stronger customer relationships.\n\nOverall verdict\n\nHubSpot is loaded with features, but its unique selling point (USP) is undoubtedly the integrated CRM system. However, its enterprise plan can be quite expensive, starting at $3,600 per month with a one-time onboarding fee of $6,000. The price is high, especially considering the software's absence of AI capabilities. Nonetheless, it does include generative AI that can aid in your content creation efforts.\n\nSprinklr goes a step further with its eight specialized AI models thatÂ can be trained specifically to glean insights from internal data. This leads to better decision-making and enhanced experiences for your teams. You can also leverage the built-in AI-powered budget and bid optimization to improve campaign performance and set up automated content approval paths, ensuring brand compliance.\n\nCustomer testimonial\n\nðª Strengths\n\nâThe thing that we absolutely find most helpful with the Hubspot marketing Hub is that most of what we need resides in one place. We use it for our website, our blog, social posting and calendaring, and email marketing (in addition to the Sales Hub). All of those functions used to be in separate platforms so it has allowed us to seriously simplify our tech stack.â\n\nSource\n\nð¡ What could be better\n\nâWhile I find HubSpot Marketing Hub to be quite useful there are areas where it could be improved. The pricing can be a bit high, for businesses or startups on a tight budget. Additionally, the platform can sometimes feel overwhelming because of its range of features making it take longer to get the hang of. I've also noticed that some of the analytics and automation features are only available in higher-tier plans, which can be frustrating if you're not ready to invest at that level. Overall these are drawbacks, in a comprehensive marketing solution that potential users should keep in mind.â\n\nSource\n\n7. Khoros\n\nKhorosÂ offers an industry-leading social media management platform that can handle publishing, engagement, listening, and analytics with ease. What sets Khoros apart is its updated LinkedIn publishing capabilities.Â\n\nLinkedIn continues to be a pivotal channel for B2B marketers, and if youâre a B2B enterprise, here's some good news. With Khorosâs LinkedIn update, you can create an audience profile you want to target on LinkedIn using filters like geography, job function, industry, and company size. After saving the profile, you can easily target a specific set of audiences on LinkedIn in the future by simply selecting the saved profile, eliminating the need to reconfigure your targeting criteria.\n\nð Prominent features\n\nProactive risk management: Set permissions and restrictions to ensure that only authorized individuals can make changes or post on behalf of your brand. This helps prevent potentially harmful actions on your social media accounts.\n\nLabeling: You can label content by campaign, product, audience, or any other relevant criteria, making it easier to track performance and make data-driven decisions.\n\nSocial redisplay: Collect and showcase content created by your audience, such as user reviews, testimonials, or social media mentions, across any digital touchpoint to drive engagement.Â\n\nOverall verdict\n\nSome of the worldâs biggest companies use Khoros to manage their social media needs. Its UI is user-friendly and easy to navigate, and the application can be customized as per your needs. Having said that, it is prone to glitches, and review forumsÂ are filled with stories of its outdated and complicated analytics layouts. Additionally, the automatic tagging and queuing features have received mixed reviews, with some users finding them less intuitive than expected.\n\nWhereas in Sprinklr, after adding an asset to the Digital Asset Manager (DAM), you can tag it with your approved campaign tags. Then, when youâre crafting an outbound post and uploading the appropriate asset, the entire post will automatically be tagged in the same way as the asset.Â This allows you to tailor reporting to your specific business needs without the need for manual tagging.\n\nCustomer testimonial\n\nðª Strengths\n\nâBy connecting all our social media accounts we are able to plan easily and in advance our publications and be sure to monitor all comments that are related to our brand.â\n\nSource\n\nð¡ What could be better\n\nâOccasional glitches in putting draft holds on the content calendar. Khoros analytics could also go a little more in-depth.â\n\nSource\n\n8. Brandwatch\n\nBrandwatch's (formerly Falcon.io) social media management solution provides everything you need to connect with and engage your audience on social platforms. Its unified calendar brings all your social networks together making your job easier. Managing your community is also simplified through one user-friendly inbox. And the company's official partnerships with Meta, Twitter, TikTok, and other major platforms ensure you can publish on those platforms effortlessly.Â\n\nWith an intuitive interface and comprehensive support services to boot, Brandwatch is all you need to stay on top of all your social media tasks.\n\nð Prominent features\n\nBest-in-class collaboration: Ensure quality and on-brand content across campaigns and teams with Brandwatchâs integrated content calendar and approval flows.\n\nOne smart social inbox: Manage your community in one easy-to-use and customizable inbox, boosting customer loyalty and facilitating team collaboration.\n\nActionable social insights: Listen to consumer conversations and benchmark against your competitors.\n\nOverall verdict\n\nBrandwatch has all the things you expect from a social media management tool and more â customer experience management and a DIY landing page builder. While it's laden with state-of-the-art features, several users have complained about its functionality for TikTok and Instagram public posts. Its sentiment analysis feature, too, isn't very accurate and lacks automation.\n\nIn contrast, Sprinklrâs AI-powered sentiment analysis model excels in accurately identifying sentiment in messages, extracting valuable data that drives critical business decisions. The model is trained using large volumes of pre-labeled datasets, enabling it to predict accurately with almost any type of text. Moreover, Sprinklr provides customized models for various industries, incorporating industry-specific perspectives to meet the distinct requirements of every supported industry.\n\nCustomer testimonial\n\nðª Strengths\n\nâThis is a complete solution allowing you to schedule posts, check performance and easily view and respond to comments. The ability to add tags and filter based on specific tags makes tracking specific posts easy.â\n\nSource\n\nð¡ What could be better\n\nâBrandwatch has a lot of dreams but falls short when it comes to regular use. There were many times when the basic usability just wasn't there such as tagging companies when posting to LinkedIn from the system (which we would then have to go back and add later when published when time allows) as well as issues with posts failing to publish but then publishing later after being deleted from the system. You tend to get handed from person to person when seeking assistance and the chatbot seems to be the go-to when needing any type of support even if you get your own account manager.â\n\nSource\n\n9. Buffer\n\nBuffer, long touted for its user-friendly interface and robust performance,Â may not be as powerful as some of the other products featured in this list but itâs certainly deserving of the âmost intuitive social media management platformâ tag. Itâs been the go-to tool for small businesses and individuals for a long time. At the same time, it can also help enterprises up their social media game with its suite of productsÂ designed to automate tasks including scheduling, engagement, analytics, and landing page creation, all while empowering teams to collaborate more seamlessly.Â\n\nBufferâs customer support is also excellent, with friendly and knowledgeable staff genuinely interested in answering your questions. If youâre looking to optimize your social media management and are on a tight budget, this cost-effective solution is a worthwhile option.Â\n\nð Prominent features\n\nBuffer AI Assistant: Generate ideas with a single click and repurpose your existing content as needed, improving your engagement across all social platforms.\n\nOne dashboard: Get a broad understanding of your performance across multiple accounts and in-depth insights into specific social channels from one intuitive analytics dashboard.\n\nSmart alerts (powered by machine learning): Get instant notifications for posts with questions, negative sentiments, or purchase-related comments.\n\nOverall verdict\n\nWhile Buffer offers numerous advantages, its analytics feature falls short when compared to its competitors, including Sprinklr. Another significant limitation is its lack of support for Instagram. In contrast, Sprinklr excels in this department by enabling active engagement with prospects and customers across more than 30 contemporary channels, including chat and messaging.Â Furthermore, unlike Buffer it also reduces the risks of off-brand engagement with a global compliance framework that includes approvals, governance rules, and moderation processes.\n\nCustomer testimonial\n\nðª Strengths\n\n\"Buffer takes all the stress out of social media management. There's a great draft and approval process along with an easy-to-use asset library. Having multiple platforms in one place but still having the benefit of most of the native apps is well worth the subscription cost.\"\n\nSource\n\nð¡ What could be better\n\nâI wish that the interface were a little more user friendly and make it a little more fun for the users. I also think that would be nice to have a collaboration option (Not sure if this is available now) but it was not available when I used it. And would be very nice to have the option of some kind or included software to review your text or post to have less mistakes when writing.â\n\nÂ\n\nSource\n\n10. CoSchedule\n\nIf you are particular about keeping things neat, tidy, and on schedule,Â theÂ CoScheduleÂ Social CalendarÂ boasts one of the most feature-packed calendars, providing you with a complete view of your entire social strategy. This makes it easy for youÂ to spot gaps in your schedule, add new messages, and change priorities with drag-and-drop rescheduling. Its automated social publishing features let youÂ publish high-quality content,Â optimizeÂ your postingÂ schedule,Â and create reusable social sharing plans to promote your content, blog posts,Â events,Â andÂ other social campaigns.Â\n\nPlanning and publishing aside, you can alsoÂ measureÂ andÂ analyze the performanceÂ of every postÂ using the applicationâsÂ powerful reporting andÂ analytics capabilities.\n\nð Prominent features\n\nAI Social Assistant: Use AI to generate creative ideas and craft engaging social messages effortlessly.\n\nSocial templates: Develop predefined social sharing plans that you can easily reuse for efficient and consistent social media campaigns.\n\nReQueue: Automatically repost your top social posts to get more mileage out of them.\n\nOverall verdict\n\nApart from being a bit pricey, thereâs a cap on the number of social media profiles you can connect with CoSchedule, and that number is 10. A lot of users have pointed out that the toolâs not very user-friendly and easy-to-use,Â which can make user adoption within your team a challenge.Â\n\nSprinklr has a steep learning curve as well. But once you get the hang of it, its powerful features can enhance your social media management capabilities considerably, eventually transforming social engagement from a conversation to a revenue driver for your organization.Â\n\nCustomer testimonial\n\nðª Strengths\n\nâCoSchedule provides a number of features, from a drag-and-drop calendar to a chat system where you can tag your teammates in projects. It allows you to create a list of tasks per campaign or project, and you can tag the appropriate employees to ensure a project is completed. You can also attach photos, files, and other assets to the project to keep everything in one place.â\n\nSource\n\nð¡ What could be better\n\nâWhile CoSchedule Marketing Suite offers a robust set of features, a minor drawback is the learning curve involved in fully harnessing its capabilities, requiring some time to become acquainted with all the functionalities and maximize its potential.â\n\nSource\n\n11.

Furthermore,Â Sprinklrâs planning, publishing, and reporting tools use AI to categorize messages by intent, automatically triage them to the right teams, and power âbest responsesâ at every turn.Â\n\nCustomer testimonial\n\nðª Strengths\n\nâIt's a tool that it's always launching new features - that follows what's trending on social media (like publishing and scheduling reels directly through the platform). Also, it's a great tool to analyze what's performing better.âÂ\n\nWhat could be better\n\nâUnfortunately, the usability it's not so much intuitive - it's necessary to do the trainings and watchingÂ their learning module to full understand how to use the tool.â\n\nSource\n\nNow, that you understand the top social media management tools for 2024, let's move on to the next section on how to find the best social media tool for your business.\n\nHow to find the best social media management software for your business?\n\nIf you want to start your research for a social media management tool, follow the steps below to arrive at your best-fit tool:\n\nResearch and compare\n\nExplore options: Begin by exploring the various social media management tools available in the market.
