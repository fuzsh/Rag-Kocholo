        "text": "Five-camera set anchors studio programming in Miami’s Telemundo Center\n\nPrime real estate in a popular city like Paris is hard to come by, especially during the 2024 Summer Olympics. Telemundo Deportes shared a rooftop studio with NBC News for the Games’ opening weekend but, since then, has opted for a virtual set in Studio L in Miami’s Telemundo Center.\n\n“I couldn’t imagine what this was going to be when our team started working on it,” says Manashi Mukherjee, VP, technical production, Telemundo. “[The final product] has exceeded everything that I could have imagined. It has been a labor of love, but our team enjoys innovating and being creative.”\n\nControlled Environment: Crew Streamlines Programming With Cost-Effective, Improved Set\n\nHeading into this summer, Telemundo Deportes understood that highlighting the picturesque city of Paris was important. Unfortunately, with broadcasters from all over the world flocking to the French capital, available space in front of marquee monuments and vistas would be at a premium. This was part of the consideration as the Spanish-language broadcaster planned its studio programming, but, for providing the unparalleled views to its audience, the perfect solution was an existing virtual studio in Telemundo Center — along with the expertise of Director, Real-Time Graphics, Fabián Albarracín and his team: Technical Artists Osmany Gómez, Edward Tejeiro, Jose Cruz, and Carlos Rivero; Real-Time Specialists Alberto Franca and Diego Soto; and Real-Time Programmer Manuel Romero.\n\n“If you had to build a set in Paris,” says Mukherjee, “there’s a lot of cost involved with aspects like material, time, and labor. We already have this studio setup [in Miami], and Fabián and his team did an amazing job of capturing a photorealistic environment. You feel like you’re walking around a real-life set in Paris.”\n\nTo achieve the high level of authenticity and realism, Albarracín and his crew began work on the virtual studio five years ago. The space was brought online for Telemundo Deportes’ extensive coverage of the postponed Tokyo Summer Olympics — for which the studio made a huge difference given the health and safety restrictions imposed by the city to curb the spread of COVID-19 in 2021. Workflows have been refined and improved over the past half decade, including recent activity during last year’s FIFA Women’s World Cup in Australia and New Zealand. The improved operations also allow other entities within Telemundo Enterprises, including the news division, to leverage the high-quality studio.\n\n“Our technology gives us the ability to show something that looks real without our audience noticing that we aren’t in the host city,” says Albarracín. “Since everything is in a controlled environment, we don’t have to worry about inclement weather, like too much rain or sun. Telemundo Deportes has been our main client, and they’ve been very happy with it.”\n\nReplicating a Parisian Setting: Environment Corresponds to Time, Weather in France\n\nThough not physically in Paris, the crew nevertheless adjusts to conditions there. To mimic the setting, the atmosphere changes to depict current weather or time of day, which includes illuminating the Parisian skyline with its familiar glow. The accurate portrayal of the daily atmosphere in Paris, along with the actual execution of the virtual set, is achieved via Engine 5.3 (an upgrade from Unreal Engine 4.7, which was used for the 2023 FIFA Women’s World Cup), Blackmagic Design’s Ultimatte chroma keyer, Chyron PRIME VSAR (virtual set and augmented reality) graphics, stYpe’s RedSpy for optical tracking, and four cameras: two hard, a Steadicam, and a jib.\n\n“We easily choose between different time zones – including 11 a.m., 2 p.m., 5 p.m., 8 p.m., and late at night — and Unreal Engine will automatically change the lighting of the sun,” Albarracín explains. “We were so focused on the details that we brought in a sculptor to build the statues that we’re using to replicate the Trocadéro in Paris.”\n\nPulling off a virtual studio with hyper-realistic elements takes a fair amount of internal collaboration. This requires not only constant work by Mukherjee, Albarracín, and their respective departments but also a close working relationship with Telemundo’s set-design crew. In addition, features on the set have been altered to broadcast the best look possible.\n\n“We initially had some flowers that were put on set but looked a little strange on the air since they weren’t moving with the background,” notes Mukherjee. “Within a day, Fabián’s team put them in virtually, which shows how versatile and nimble this set is with changes.”\n\nNot only does lighting or specific elements change, but the virtual set populates the background with the correct location of recognizable buildings, such as the Panthéon in the 5th arrondissement or Notre Dame in the adjacent 4th arrondissement.\n\nBreathtaking Realism: Technology Wows Both Viewers and Talent\n\nThe space easily accommodates the cameras’ movements because of the massive height and width of the set’s green screen. There have been no glitches or delays, and the environment presented meshes well with normal workflows used on any other set.\n\n“If I’m a camera operator,” says Mukherjee, “I’m going to use the jib exactly the way I would in a regular space because the tracking technology has been so precise. Our talent also feel like they’re working from a grand space because they look at the composite monitors and forget that the green screen is there.”\n\nOne advantage of the set is the amount of immersion used to capture the attention of viewers. In a real-world setting, there aren’t many cameras that can take the audience up close to landmark like the Eiffel Tower, but, in a virtual space, there are no hindrances to zooming in on this iconic structure.\n\n“We’re able to take a camera and zoom straight in on one of our sculptures and see it in incredible detail,” Mukherjee adds. “We even put tourists on the Eiffel Tower’s observation deck, although small to see, it was a detail we included.”\n\n2026 and Beyond: Studio Workflows Could Impact Future Tentpole Productions\n\nWith four full days of competition remaining, the crew has another four days to showcase this example of technical and creative brainstorming. Since both the technology and the virtual set are evergreen and can be adapted to other events on the sports calendar, Studio L is likely to play a pivotal role in Telemundo Deportes’ production plans.\n\n“It’s going to reduce the material that we use since we don’t have to build anything, as well as allow us to be more flexible with less travel,” says Albarracín. “We raised the bar so high that we need to be on the level of this set for future events.”\n\nBefore the next big event, the team will have time to reflect on this effort and find more efficient ways to enhance the studio programming. A heavy lift like the 2024 Paris Games offers numerous lessons. “We’ve learned a lot by using this new technology and crafting these designs,” says Mukherjee. “Those lessons will be implemented on our next project, and everything compounds on top of itself.”\n\nFor now, it’s important to stay in the moment: the Games of the XXXIII Olympiad.\n\n“I’ve never seen anything like this before,” says Albarracín. “We’re really proud of the work that we’ve done. We’re grateful to have a team that’s capable of creating these virtual environments that not only look extremely real but also run smoothly on the air.”"
