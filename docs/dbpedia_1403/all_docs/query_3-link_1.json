        "text": "Free ad-supported streaming television (FAST) is significantly disrupting traditional media consumption and advertising paradigms. In the U.S., FAST is expected to add 13.3 million new viewers in 2023, contributing to a total viewer base of 157.1 million. FAST offers audiences a wide array of free content without the necessity of account creation while simultaneously providing publishers with revenue streams through targeted advertising.\n\nIf you're looking to navigate this evolving landscape successfully, consider this article your ultimate guide to understanding and leveraging the power of FAST channels in the current media ecosystem.\n\nWhat does FAST mean?\n\nFAST stands for free ad-supported streaming television. As its name implies, this is a business model based on offering video programming for free to the viewer. What differentiates FAST from traditional TV is that FAST encompasses both linear channels and on-demand content. It falls under the FAST category if it's free to the viewer and monetized through ads.\n\nMany often perceive FAST as only including linear television channels, but it's essential to note that FAST also includes Video On Demand (VOD). The defining feature here is not whether the content is linear or on-demand but whether it is free. This differentiates it from services like Hulu, which are subscription-based but include ads.\n\nHow FAST channels work\n\nFAST channels offer viewers a mix of linear and on-demand programming at no cost, relying on advertising for monetization. Here's a breakdown of how these channels operate:\n\nContent curation: The first step is gathering or creating content that will interest the target audience. This could be licensed third-party content or original programming. The key is offering a wide variety to ensure your channel appeals to a broad spectrum of viewers.\n\nScheduling and programming: Like traditional television, FAST channels require meticulous scheduling. The use of dayparting helps target specific demographics at different times. Advanced TV scheduling tools automate this process, allowing for efficient content delivery.\n\nAd integration: Ads are woven into the programming at specified intervals. The exact nature of these ads can range from traditional commercial breaks to shorter, more interactive forms of advertising. Some channels even offer programmatic advertising, where ads are targeted to individual users based on various metrics.\n\nDistribution: The channel is made available on various FAST platforms. Unlike traditional TV, which requires a proprietary set-top box, FAST channels can be accessed via multiple consumer devices, including smart TVs, mobile phones and computers.\n\nAnalytics: Real-time data analytics tools track viewer behavior, helping channel owners understand what's working and what isn't. This data informs future programming decisions and can also be used to attract advertisers.\n\nWhat are the features of FAST channels?\n\nFAST channels come with several features that make them an attractive proposition for both viewers and content owners:\n\nCost-Effective: The most apparent benefit for viewers is that FAST channels are free. The ad-based model enables revenue generation for content owners without needing a large subscription base. Additionally, content owners can leverage many of the FAST platforms' built-in audiences, a point we will elaborate on below.\n\nAccessibility: These channels are easily accessible across various devices, ranging from smart TVs to mobile devices, broadening the potential audience reach.\n\nVariety: FAST channels often offer a wide array of content, from news and sports to movies and specialty shows. This broad selection helps keep audiences engaged.\n\nUser experience: FAST services prioritize user experience by offering high-definition streaming, low ad-load times and a user-friendly interface. They blend linear \"lean back\" content for users who prefer a programmed experience and on-demand programming for those who want to choose what they watch.\n\nTargeted advertising: Advanced analytics allow for more precise ad targeting, making advertising slots on FAST channels increasingly valuable.\n\nDynamic content: With the ability to quickly swap out content, FAST channels can stay current and adapt to audience preferences much more swiftly than traditional TV channels. This flexibility also enables the creation of pop-up FAST channels centered around events, themes or promotions, offering yet another layer of dynamism.\n\nWhy should content distributors care about FAST?\n\nLeveraging the power of FAST can serve as a strategic complement to existing video distribution channels for content creators. FAST opens up immediate reach and engagement opportunities owing to its built-in audiences. The relatively low barriers to entry—often offset by ad revenue—enable content distributors to diversify their portfolio, adding a valuable layer of flexibility to their overall distribution strategy.\n\nBefore exploring the advantages, let's quickly revisit the fundamental distinctions between FAST, AVOD and linear TV to better understand the significance of FAST.\n\nWhat is the difference between FAST, AVOD and linear TV?\n\nFAST and AVOD (Ad-Supported Video On Demand) both employ advertising to monetize content, but they differ fundamentally in their approach. FAST operates as a business model that delivers free content, encompassing linear channels and on-demand options. AVOD, conversely, is not a business model but a delivery method. It pertains to providing on-demand content monetized through advertising, which can be free or subscription-based. The key differentiator is that FAST exclusively offers free content, setting it apart as a distinct business model in contrast to AVOD's delivery methodology.\n\nFAST and Linear TV both combine scheduled live programming with on-demand content, making their programming styles similar. However, there are distinct features that set them apart.\n\nSimultaneous offerings\n\nWhile both offer a mix of linear and on-demand content, how these services deliver the experience can differ. FAST services often employ sophisticated algorithms to curate linear channels around themes or viewer behaviors, thus giving it a more personalized touch.\n\nFinancial implications\n\nFrom a financial standpoint, FAST opens doors for cord-cutters and CTV device users to access a wide range of FAST channel options on their devices. Consumers save as they no longer need to invest in antenna, modems and additional subscription services access to linear bundled PAY TV services.\n\nPortability and convenience\n\nFAST services have the edge in portability. They're typically accessible from various devices, including smartphones, tablets and laptops, allowing users to take their viewing experiences wherever they go. Linear TV is often restricted to set-top boxes and specific locations, thereby limiting mobility.\n\nWhy is FAST streaming important?\n\nFAST streaming empowers content owners with many benefits, including:\n\nRedefining consumer expectations\n\nFAST services are redefining what consumers expect from a streaming platform. Combining the best of both worlds—scheduled programming and on-demand content—they create a hybrid model that suits various viewer preferences.\n\nDemocratization of content\n\nFAST platforms make content accessible to a broader audience by eliminating financial barriers. They offer an avenue for content creators to reach audiences they might have yet to access through traditional channels.\n\nDriving innovation\n\nThe rise of FAST is pushing the entire industry to innovate. Whether creating new advertising models or improving content discovery algorithms, FAST services are continually evolving, pushing Linear TV and other streaming services to adapt and innovate.\n\nFAST, connected devices and viewing times\n\nAccording to recent data by Conviva, Smart TVs are quickly becoming the preferred medium for streaming, marking a 31.4% year-over-year increase in usage globally. FAST channels are primarily consumed on connected devices like Roku boxes, Samsung Smart TVs or Chromecast™ sticks, for reasons including:\n\nChanging landscape\n\nWhile Smart TVs are on the rise, mobile phones are following closely with a 23.9% global increase in year-over-year viewing time. Connected TV devices saw a moderate 7.8% growth, driven by Asia and LATAM, indicating a shift in viewer preferences towards more integrated and convenient streaming options.\n\nAd loads and viewing time\n\nLonger viewing times, irrespective of the device, are a boon for advertisers and content distributors. Many FAST platforms are further sweetening the deal by committing to a reduced ad load of around 8 to 10 minutes per hour, compared to traditional cable’s 10 to 16 minutes. This makes for a better viewing experience and fits well with the modern trends towards reduced advertising interruption, particularly on devices designed for convenience.\n\nConvenience\n\nThe decline in usage of desktops and gaming consoles for streaming (according to Coviva) demonstrates that consumers gravitate towards devices that offer the most streamlined and convenient viewing experiences. Original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) are capitalizing on this trend by providing more TVs with built-in streaming capabilities at competitive prices.\n\nOverall, the dynamic landscape of device usage for streaming directly influences how FAST services are consumed, making it an essential factor for viewers and stakeholders in the industry.\n\nThe evolution of linear TV as an experience\n\nLinear TV as a distribution medium is experiencing a renaissance, largely because of Free ad-supported streaming television (FAST).\n\nFAST's impact on the viewer experience is especially noteworthy. Many operators are now prioritizing FAST channels in their user interface. For instance, some platforms feature FAST linear channels as the first option viewers see upon launching the app, effectively putting linear channels in a prominent position. This design choice mirrors the traditional cable TV experience, where a channel is already playing when you turn on the TV. Such instant access appeals to viewers looking for spontaneous entertainment without the burden of selection.\n\nCompanies like Pluto TV have gone further by offering an interface allowing viewers to channel-surf just like a traditional set-top box. A significant audience still relishes the unpredictability of discovering a show they weren't planning to watch. This implies that the viewer experience is not just about content but also about how it is delivered.\n\nFAST channels are also fueling innovation in the realm of linear TV. With expansive and often niche content libraries, they are attracting audiences that traditional TV channels have been losing. This revitalization of the linear format leads viewers to blend Subscription Video-on-demand (SVOD) services with their preferred FAST channels, thereby diversifying their programming options.\n\nThe FAST Market\n\nLet’s look at the types of FAST services available and some of the major players in the space.\n\nTypes of FAST services\n\nMedia company-owned FASTs\n\nWhat they are: These are FAST services owned by large media conglomerates. They often include content that aligns with the parent company's broader portfolio. Examples: Peacock (owned by NBCUniversal) and Pluto TV (owned by Paramount Global).\n\nAdvantages:\n\nStrong content libraries backed by established media companies.\n\nEasier cross-promotion with other properties owned by the parent company.\n\nThe ability to monetize old library content with little to no investment.\n\nGenerally high production values and better audience targeting due to in-house analytics.\n\nDisadvantages:\n\nMay prioritize content that aligns with the parent company's broader strategy, limiting variety.\n\nPotentially higher ad loads to maximize revenue.\n\nOEM (Original equipment manufacturer) FASTs\n\nWhat they are: These are services that come pre-installed on hardware like smart TVs or set-top boxes. They are often designed to work seamlessly with a particular brand of hardware. Examples: Samsung TV Plus (available on Samsung TVs), LG TV and Vizio WatchFree (found on Vizio TVs).\n\nAdvantage:\n\nOEM enables brands to identify audiences who saw or missed their TV spots and retarget them via mobile, tablet, desktop or OTT using ACR (automated content recognition)\n\nDisadvantages:\n\nLimited to specific hardware, reducing the service's reach.\n\nContent selection can be more restricted compared to more open platforms.\n\nIndependent FASTs\n\nWhat they are: These are stand-alone services that aren't tied to a larger media company or specific piece of hardware. Examples: Plex, Redbox Live TV.\n\nAdvantages:\n\nMore flexibility in content acquisition and partnerships.\n\nOften more innovative in terms of features and user experience.\n\nDisadvantages:\n\nMay struggle with scale and revenue generation without a large parent company.\n\nContent libraries might be less extensive due to budget constraints.\n\nPopular FAST services and possible audience reach\n\nvMVPDs and their role in the FAST landscape\n\nWhile Virtual multichannel video programming distributors (vMVPDs) like Hulu Live TV, Sling TV, YouTube TV, Philo and Frndly TV are not inherently FAST services, some have strategically introduced FAST options into their portfolios. For example, Sling TV offers FAST content as part of its lineup to maintain customer engagement, even during periods when users may have their subscriptions paused. This approach helps vMVPDs retain customer relationships by offering various content that can be accessed freely, serving as an additional touchpoint in the consumer's entertainment ecosystem.\n\nHaving got an overview of the market, now let’s dive into the monetization and technical aspects of FAST.\n\nHow does FAST advertising work?\n\nFAST platforms make their revenue primarily through advertising. Unlike subscription models, where the revenue is generated upfront through subscriber fees, FAST relies on ads to monetize its content. Here's how it generally works:\n\nDynamic ad insertion\n\nOne of the key technologies enabling effective advertising on FAST channels is dynamic ad insertion (DAI). This technology allows for real-time insertion of ads targeted to the viewer based on geography, viewing history and demographics.\n\nAd formats\n\nThe formats can vary, but typical ones include pre-roll, mid-roll, post-roll and pause ads. There's also an increasing trend towards interactive and shoppable ads, which allow viewers to engage directly with the advertisement.\n\nAd load\n\nMost FAST platforms are adopting a reduced ad load strategy. They typically offer around 8 to 10 minutes of ads per hour, compared to traditional linear TV, which can run upwards of 16 minutes per hour. The reduced ad load aims to create a more viewer-friendly experience.\n\nThe value of ad insertion on FAST channels\n\nAd insertion in FAST channels delivers a multifaceted value proposition, encompassing both the advantages to advertisers and the impressive CPMs that channel originators can command.\n\nTargeting capabilities\n\nFAST platforms gather extensive data on user behavior, enabling advertisers to execute highly targeted campaigns. This level of precision is superior to what traditional linear TV can offer, thereby making each ad slot more valuable.\n\nMeasurable ROI\n\nThe digital framework of FAST platforms supports real-time analytics. This allows advertisers to gauge their campaigns' performance across various metrics, such as click-through rates and conversion. This granularity in measurement results in a more calculable ROI.\n\nHigh CPMs\n\nUnlike the estimations in traditional cable channels, which hover between $10 and $25 per 1,000 impressions, FAST channels, with their dynamic and highly targeted ad insertions, can command CPMs ranging from $40 to $50. This translates to approximately $0.60 to $1 per hour of viewership. When you consider that the average person watches more than 5 hours of content daily, the revenue potential becomes evident.\n\nRevenue performance\n\nPlatforms like Pluto have already broken the $3 million a-day mark in ad revenue. Even Hulu, a significant player in the ad-supported content sphere, generates about $15 per month per subscriber in advertising, exceeding their premium, ad-free package rate of $11.99.\n\nCost-effectiveness and speed to market\n\nCreating a FAST channel involves minimal to zero upfront capital investment since you can repurpose your existing content libraries and leverage cloud-based video delivery software. This ease and speed of deployment allow channel originators to start generating revenue quickly, often within days or weeks as opposed to months or years.\n\nThe comprehensive value of ad insertion on FAST channels thus arises from a blend of high targeting capabilities, measurable ROI, impressive CPMs and speed to market. It's a business model that's democratizing the advertising landscape and proving to be increasingly profitable for channel originators.\n\nAre FAST channels profitable?\n\nFAST channels have demonstrated remarkable potential for profitability, carving out their unique niche in the evolving media landscape. Several factors contribute to their revenue-generating prowess:\n\nScale and reach\n\nOne of the prime advantages of FAST channels is their ability to scale and reach a diverse audience rapidly. This broad reach translates into a large inventory of ad slots, thereby attracting advertisers looking for high-visibility opportunities. The result is a better yield for Cost Per Mille (CPM).\n\nMonetization strategies\n\nFAST channels employ a variety of monetization tactics beyond just advertisements. These may include syndication deals, revenue-sharing arrangements and brand partnerships, which can diversify income streams and mitigate risks.\n\nViewer retention\n\nThe reduced ad load strategy employed by most FAST platforms has positively affected viewer retention. Lower ad fatigue means that viewers are likelier to stick around, making the channel more appealing to advertisers and creating a virtuous cycle of increased profitability.\n\nData-driven decision-making\n\nThe robust analytics offered by FAST platforms give channel operators keen insights into viewer behavior, enabling them to optimize content and advertising strategies for maximum revenue generation. These data analytics capabilities significantly contribute to a channel's profitability by improving targeting and enhancing user engagement.\n\nCapital efficiency\n\nThe lean nature of launching and operating a FAST channel, which often involves minimal upfront costs and the ability to repurpose existing content, makes it a capital-efficient venture. Quick speed-to-market times and low operational costs yield a more immediate return on investment.\n\nWhile the landscape is certainly competitive, those who navigate it skillfully will find that FAST channels offer a compelling pathway to profitability, driven by robust advertising revenues, diversified income streams and operational efficiencies. Maintaining agility with an eye on the future can help content distributors outpace the competition.\n\nWhat is the future of FAST channels?\n\nAs the digital landscape undergoes rapid transformations, so too does the world of free ad-supported streaming television (FAST). Previously perceived as the underdog of the streaming ecosystem, FAST channels are now emerging as formidable players. Leveraging breakthroughs in artificial intelligence, data analytics and user experience design, these platforms are not just keeping pace with consumer demands but are also pioneering new formats and revenue models.\n\nAs we stand on the cusp of this evolution, several key trends promise to dictate the future trajectory of FAST channels, elevating them from secondary alternatives to becoming central to our daily entertainment and information diet.\n\nThe advertising evolution\n\nAdvertising on FAST channels is still finding its footing compared to traditional prime-time TV. However, this is expected to change as major streaming platforms like Netflix, Disney and HBO expand their ad businesses. As these platforms attract larger ad-supported audiences, the landscape will shift. Advertisers with substantial budgets may transition their investments to streaming.\n\nAI and voice technology integration\n\nIntegration of AI and voice technology is another transformative trend for FAST channels. These technologies will enhance user experiences, enabling viewers to search for content, control playback and receive personalized recommendations based on their viewing history. This shift promises a more seamless and user-friendly experience, ultimately driving engagement.\n\nNew content formats\n\nEmerging content formats will significantly influence the future of FAST channels. Short-form video content, popularized by platforms like TikTok and Instagram Reels, will continue to grow in prominence. Creators and broadcasters have the opportunity to produce 15 to 30-second ads tailored for FAST channels. These new formats will impact user engagement and create fresh opportunities for advertisers to experiment with different ad types suited to these platforms.\n\nGenerative AI and personalization\n\nGenerative AI can potentially revolutionize personalization in FAST channels. It can personalize everything from programming schedules to recommendations to ads. However, it must be applied judiciously to avoid overwhelming viewers. The challenge lies in striking the right balance between personalization and privacy, ensuring viewers find it helpful rather than intrusive.\n\nBrand suitability and shoppable content\n\nGenerative AI might also address brand suitability concerns. It can identify a context within the content and determine whether it aligns with a brand's image. For instance, a restaurant chain may want to avoid airing ads during scenes involving stomach illnesses. AI can enable shoppable content, allowing viewers to interact with items within scenes, creating a seamless shopping experience.\n\nIn this dynamic landscape, gradual adoption is key, ensuring viewers, advertisers and content providers reap the benefits of a fast-evolving ecosystem. The future of FAST channels is poised to bring us closer to personalized, engaging and innovative content experiences.\n\nTechnology and considerations for launching a FAST channel\n\nIf your organization wants to delve into the growing FAST channel ecosystem, there are some core technology and business decisions you’ll need to make.\n\nAdvanced channel origination\n\nThe first thing you'll need to enter the FAST channel ecosystem is a robust channel origination platform.
