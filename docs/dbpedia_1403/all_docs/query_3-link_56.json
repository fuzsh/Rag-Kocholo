        "text": "Horizontal Integration vs. Vertical Integration: An Overview\n\nHorizontal integration and vertical integration are growth strategies that companies use to consolidate their positions and set themselves apart from their competitors. While both involve acquiring other businesses, either approach can help companies expand.\n\nThere are important differences between the two. In horizontal integration, a business grows by purchasing related businessesâ€”namely, its competitors. In vertical integration, on the other hand, a business acquires another company to give it greater control over the stages in its supply or distribution chain.\n\nKey Takeaways\n\nHorizontal integration is a business strategy where one company takes over another that operates at the same level in an industry.\n\nVertical integration involves the acquisition of business operations within the same production vertical.\n\nHorizontal integrations help companies expand in size, diversify their product offerings, reduce competition, and expand into new markets.\n\nVertical integrations can help boost profits and make companies less dependent on their suppliers or distributors.\n\nHorizontal Integration\n\nHorizontal integration is a growth strategy that many companies use to boost their position within their industries and get an edge on their competition. They do this by taking over another company that operates at the same level of the value chain. This means both companies offer similar (if not the same) goods and services and deal with a similar customer base.\n\nFor example, if a department store chain wants to expand its footprint, buying another chain in a different city, state, or country is one way to go about it. Doing so would provide the purchaser with more revenue and allow it to reach a wider market.\n\nHorizontal integration also allows companies to cut down on their costs by sharing technology, marketing efforts, research and development (R&D), production, and distribution. So, ideally, the expanded department store chain would be more profitable than the two chains were when they operated separately.\n\nHorizontal integration usually works best when two companies have synergistic cultures. The process may fail if there are problems when the two cultures merge.\n\nVertical Integration\n\nVertical integration is a strategy that involves growth through the acquisition of a producer, vendor, supplier, distributor, or other related company that the acquirer may already be doing business with. Companies that choose to integrate vertically do so to strengthen their supply chain, reduce their production costs, capture upstream or downstream profits, or access new distribution channels.\n\nThere are two basic types of vertical integration:\n\nBackward integration occurs when a company decides to buy another business that makes an input product for the acquiring company's product. For example, a car manufacturer pursues backward integration when it acquires a tire manufacturer.\n\nForward integration occurs when a company decides to take control of some aspect of the post-production process. So, that car manufacturer might acquire an automotive dealership to sell the vehicles it produces. This gets the manufacturer closer to the consumer and also provides it with additional revenue.\n\nNote\n\nIn addition to acquisitions and mergers, companies can achieve the goals of vertical integration through internal expansion.\n\nAdvantages and Disadvantages\n\nBoth horizontal and vertical integration have their pros and cons.\n\nHorizontal Integration: Pros and Cons\n\nWhile there can be many benefits to horizontal integration, the primary ones include:\n\nAccess to a larger customer base\n\nGreater revenue\n\nReduced costs through economies of scale\n\nTaking a competitor off the playing field\n\nEven though horizontal integration may make sense from a business standpoint, there are potential downsides for consumers. For that reason, this strategy can face a high level of scrutiny from government regulators, who may invoke antitrust laws to stop it from happening.\n\nSpecifically:\n\nMerging two companies in the same industry cuts down on competition and can reduce the choices available to consumers.\n\nIt may lead to a monopoly where one company controls the availability, prices, and supply of products and services.\n\nThe new, larger company may take advantage of its dominance by raising prices and narrowing product options.\n\nIn addition to those potential obstacles, creating a larger company may result in increased bureaucracy and reduced flexibility. There is also a significant chance of failure if there isn't synergistic energy between the two companies and their cultures clash.\n\nPros\n\nLarger customer base\n\nIncreased revenue\n\nGreater market share\n\nLess competition\n\nEconomies of scale and reduced production costs\n\nCons\n\nHigh level of scrutiny from government agencies\n\nPotential creation of a monopoly\n\nPossibility of higher prices and fewer options for consumers\n\nNew company may be more bureaucratic, less nimble\n\nBreeds a weak competitive environment, complacency, and mediocrity\n\nVertical Integration: Pros and Cons\n\nVertical integration can help a company:\n\nReduce costs across different stages of its production process\n\nMaintain tighter quality control and a better flow of information across the supply chain\n\nIncrease sales\n\nImprove profits\n\nReduce or eliminate the leverage that certain suppliers have over the company (backward integration)\n\nThe drawbacks of vertical integration include:\n\nA concentration of resources in one approach\n\nIncreased risk when market environments are uncertain\n\nHigh costs to coordinate the strategy, including the potential of additional debt\n\nPros\n\nIncreased sales\n\nReduced costs across various parts of production\n\nTighter quality control\n\nBetter flow of information across the supply chain\n\nMore control over production volume\n\nCons\n\nConcentration of resources in one approach\n\nIncreased risk during uncertain times\n\nPotentially high organizational and coordination costs\n\nHorizontal Integration Examples\n\nKroger and Albertsons: In 2023, the grocery company Kroger announced it would acquire the grocery company, Albertsons, with the deal expected to close in 2024. This would create one of the largest national grocery chains, competing with Walmart and Amazon. Additionally, Kroger believes the merger will reduce prices for customers and improve wages for union workers.\n\nCVS and Signify Health: In 2024, CVS acquired Signify Health, a technology and services company that facilitates provider care, allowing clinicians into the homes of customers to facilitate a variety of medical services. This allowed CVS to advance its medical care by directly entering the homes of individuals, bringing them closer to consumers.\n\nWalt Disney Company and 21st Century Fox: Disney's acquisition of 21st Century Fox was finalized in March 2019. The goal was to increase Disney's content and entertainment options, expand internationally, and grow its direct-to-consumer offerings, including ESPN+, Disney+, and the two company's combined ownership stake in Hulu. The deal also included 20th Century Fox (now 20th Century Studios), Fox Searchlight Pictures, Fox 2000 Pictures, Fox Family and Fox Animation, Twentieth Century Fox Television, FX Productions and Fox21, FX Networks, National Geographic Partners, Fox Networks Group International, Star India, and Fox's interests in Hulu, Tata Sky, and Endemol Shine Group.\n\nVertical Integration Examples\n\nAmazon and Whole Foods: In 2017, Amazon purchased the grocery store chain, Whole Foods, allowing it to expand its business offering and enter the grocery retail space. This resulted in lower prices and new products for consumers.\n\nIkea and forests in Romania: The Swedish furniture giant bought an 83,000-acre woodland reserve in northeastern Romania in 2015. It was the first effort the company made at managing its own forest operations. IKEA said it purchased the forest to manage wood sustainably at affordable prices.\n\nNetflix produces its own content: Netflix is one of the most significant examples of vertical integration in the entertainment industry. Prior to starting its own content studio, Netflix was at the end of the supply chain because it distributed films and television shows created by other companies. But Netflix realized it could generate more revenue and be less dependent on others if it created its own programming. In 2013, the company released its first original content.\n\nWhat Is the Basic Difference Between Horizontal and Vertical Integration?\n\nHorizontal integration is an expansion strategy that involves the acquisition of another company in the same business line. Vertical integration is an expansion strategy where a company takes control over one or more stages in the production or distribution of its products.\n\nWhy Are Horizontal and Vertical Integration Important?\n\nBoth horizontal and vertical integration can give a company a competitive edge in the marketplace through strategic acquisitions. The same company can implement both strategies at different times, depending on what its goals are at any particular point. Acquiring another company can also be faster and cheaper than developing similar resources internally.\n\nWhat Is an Example of Horizontal Integration?\n\nAn example of horizontal integration would be if two consulting firms merge. One of the firms offers software development services in the defense industry; the other firm also provides software development in the oil and gas industry. The new company can now do both.\n\nWho Uses Vertical Integration?\n\nCompanies that seek to strengthen their positions in the market and gain greater control over their production or distribution chains use vertical integration.\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nHorizontal integration and vertical integration are two different growth strategies that can help companies expand their business. Although the ultimate goals may be the same, there are important differences between the two strategies. Horizontal and vertical integration also have potential downsides that companies need to consider before embarking on either of them."
